[9899-9916] <samaya-fetishism> [BODY COMMITMENTS AS PHYSICAL RULES]
**Misreading:**
The threefold body samaya (outer: not stealing, inner: not sexual misconduct, secret: not killing) are interpreted as physical rules requiring behavioral compliance.

**Why it arises:**
Legalistic thinking. Rules suggest compliance. Precept-based traditions.

**Primary consequence:**
Behavioral compliance focus. The practitioner obsesses over physical actions.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that samaya is recognition; legalism; missing inner/secret dimensions.

**Cascade effects:**
<legalism> through rule-compliance.
<behavioral-obsession> through physical monitoring.

[9907-9916] <sign-obsession> [DISEASE SIGNS AS PUNISHMENT]
**Misreading:**
The diseases mentioned as signs of broken samaya (limb disease, sense organ disease, etc.) are interpreted as karmic punishments automatically resulting from transgression.

**Why it arises:**
Punishment framework. Disease as divine retribution. Fear of consequences.

**Primary consequence:**
Disease-anxiety. The practitioner fears illness as punishment.

**Secondary consequences:**
Health obsession; missing that "disease" is metaphor for recognition-obscuration.

**Cascade effects:**
<magical-thinking> through disease-causality.
<anxiety-amplification> through punishment-fear.

[9917-9935] <restoration-ritualism> [OFFERING SEVEN STATUES AS MECHANISM]
**Misreading:**
The restoration practices (offering seven statues, seven self-arisen images, seven vajra bells) are interpreted as mechanical procedures that automatically repair broken samaya.

**Why it arises:**
Ritual mechanism thinking. Offerings suggest transaction. Desire for restoration formula.

**Primary consequence:**
Restoration-magic. The practitioner believes offerings mechanically fix samaya.

**Secondary consequences:**
Accumulation obsession; missing that restoration is recognition; ritual formalism.

**Cascade effects:**
<ritual-mechanism> through offering-causality.
<transactional-mindset> through restoration-payment.

[9921-9935] <image-worship> [STATUES AS POWER OBJECTS]
**Misreading:**
The instruction to offer images/statues is interpreted as establishing that statues have inherent power to purify or restore.

**Why it arises:**
Fetishism tendency. Images suggest power. Object-oriented spirituality.

**Primary consequence:**
Statue-fetishism. The practitioner believes statues have purifying power.

**Secondary consequences:**
Object-accumulation; missing that images symbolize recognition; idolatry.

**Cascade effects:**
<fetishism> through object-power.
<materialism> through accumulation.

[9936-9948] <family-body-samaya> [CRITICIZING FAMILY AS SAMAYA-BREAKING]
**Misreading:**
The prohibition against criticizing siblings, parents, and one's own body is interpreted as absolute rule against any evaluation or discernment regarding family.

**Why it arises:**
Family-loyalty absolutism. "Don't criticize" suggests silence. Confusing discernment with disparagement.

**Primary consequence:**
Family-enmeshment. The practitioner cannot set boundaries or leave abusive family.

**Secondary consequences:**
Codependency; abuse-tolerance; missing that samaya concerns view, not family dynamics.

**Cascade effects:**
<enmeshment> through family-obligation.
<boundary-confusion> through absolutism.

[9942-9948] <vehicle-hierarchy> [MAHAYANA/HINAYANA AS VALUE RANKING]
**Misreading:**
The mention of "Mahayana and Hinayana Dharma" is interpreted as establishing hierarchy where Mahayana is superior and Hinayana is inferior.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. "Great" vs "small" suggests ranking. Vehicle-elitism.

**Primary consequence:**
Vehicle-denigration. The practitioner looks down on Hinayana as inferior.

**Secondary consequences:**
Sectarianism; premature Mahayana practice; missing that both are skillful means.

**Cascade effects:**
<sectarianism> through vehicle-hierarchy.
<elitism-error> through superiority-complex.

[9947-9948] <body-deity-fusion> [BODY AS MANDALA AS LITERAL]
**Misreading:**
The teaching that "one's own body is the deity's mandala" is interpreted as literal identity where the physical body is ontologically divine.

**Why it arises:**
Literalism toward sacred statements. Body-mandala suggests divinity. Ontological inflation.

**Primary consequence:**
Body-divinity confusion. The practitioner believes their body is literally divine.

**Secondary consequences:**
Grandiose identification; narcissism; missing that mandala is perceptual frame.

**Cascade effects:**
<grandiose-delusion> through body-divinization.
<ontological-inflation> through literal mandala.
