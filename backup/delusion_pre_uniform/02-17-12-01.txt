**Primary consequence:**
View-intellectualization: treating view as concept. Direct recognition is replaced by philosophical study.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I understand the seven verbal views"
- Missing that view is immediate seeing
- Knowledge-acquisition over recognition

[3706-3708] <rang-gi-lta-ba-ngo-gzung-self-view-identification-fixation> <self-view-identity-attachment>

**Misreading:**
"Identifying one's own view" (*rang gi lta ba ngos gzung ba*) interpreted as view-identity to claim, creating view-identity-fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"One's own" suggests possession. "View" implies identity. Identity-attachment: this is MY view. The practitioner claims view-identity.

**Primary consequence:**
View-identity-fixation: treating view as personal possession. Natural view is obscured by ownership.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "This is my view"
- Missing that view transcends identity
- Possession-over-transcendence

**Cascade effects:**
<rang-gi-lta-ba-ngo-gzung-self-view-identification-fixation> → <view-identity-fixation> [possession claim] → <identity-attachment> [my view] → <transcendence-miss> [ownership over nature]
