**Misreading:**
Trekcho (khregs chod) and thogal (thod rgal) represent a graduation model—complete beginner-level cutting-through to qualify for advanced leap-over teachings.

**Why it arises:**
Educational structure suggests levels. "Cutting through" sounds foundational. Thogal appears advanced. Progression mentality.

[16463-16481] <rainbow-body-validation-seeking> <ja-lus-proof-fantasy>

**Primary consequence:**
Spontaneous perfection becomes stagnation trap. Practitioners use Dzogchen to justify permanent stasis, confusing inertia with nature.
