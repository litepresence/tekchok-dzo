Third: having been introduced, practicing—four visions arise as they are.
Stages unfold naturally, not forced. Like seasons changing—no one makes
spring arrive. Recognition matures into vision.

[4427-4427]
This practitioner thought he had to create visions. Strained until eyes hurt.
Teacher laughed: "Trying to see what is already looking." Four visions arise,
not manufactured.

[4427-4427]
Snang ba bzhi—not sequential achievements but simultaneous aspects of
recognition deepening. Practice is resting in what has been recognized.

[4427-4427]
Practice without fabrication. Vision self-arises. Recognition dawns. Three

recognition.

[4427-4427]
See. Stages unfold naturally when recognition present. Don't chase visions.
Rest in recognition, they self-arise.
