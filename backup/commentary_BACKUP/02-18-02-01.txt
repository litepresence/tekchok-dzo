Listen! From Great Arrangement Chapter Thirty-Two: "Whoever desires to divide the border—body's action self-reverse outward, now wherever engaged, afterward not thus. That itself reverse, body also not abiding, three realms body also not entering!"

This teaching concerns the bodily conduct that requires settling with necessity. The body—running and lying down, rising and moving the limbs, circumambulating and making prostrations, turning the limbs and bowing the head, whatever actions one remembers—dance and mudra transformations, whatever activities one engages in visualization: whoever performs these, through naturally cutting the body's attachment, completely splitting open the body's attachment, by this one becomes the transformative body.

[4193-4198]
Also at first body formation time, speech and mind two relying on that form. First body conduct must be done! Body conduct done, afterward body karma depleted, doing un-enthusiastic, body sins purified purpose exists! From Wheel Arrangement: "Who divided body's border, this samsara's latency exhausted!"

Do you see? Body's border must be divided! Reverse the body's actions! Exhaust samsara's latency!

Emaho! Dividing the body's border!

The body's conduct in Dzogchen is not about physical posture alone. It is about reversing the habitual patterns of body. When the body runs toward objects, we reverse and rest. When the body lies down in sleep, we reverse and remain aware. When the limbs move in daily activities, we reverse and recognize the nature of movement. This is what it means to split open the body's attachment—not to stop moving, but to see movement as the display of awareness.

The purpose is twofold: common and supreme. The common purpose is to purify the obscurations accumulated through bodily misconduct. The supreme purpose is to recognize the body as the kaya, to realize that the body itself is the manifestation of wisdom. Through splitting open bodily attachment for seven days, or eleven, or half a month, external bodily attachment self-reverses, internal body becomes endowed with peaceful discipline, secret illusory body is certainly liberated into clear light.

[4235-4240]
Listen! Voice good-bad difference explained. Briefly, six beings' voices. Mind's mindfulness speech expresses. Here purpose two types: supreme and common divisions.

The voice teaching: the body going and abiding, gathering and various illusory displays, extending and withdrawing the limbs, demonstrating various activities—with mindful consciousness taking hold, the bodily conduct of the six realms—mind takes hold, the body performs. Thus, whoever is able to conduct, through whatever is contemplated, later the continuum ceases.

[4241-4249]
Thus relying on speech's various expressed, three realms samsara continuity ceases. From Supreme Empowerment Tantra: "Fortune possessing, six families' voices, each suitable expressing, six beings' wheel ceases!" As above explained, moment's effort engaged. Great effort, that itself attachment reverse. Ordinary, that itself and appearance all equal, carefree recognition arises.

Do you see? Six beings' voices! Express suitably! Wheel ceases! Recognition arises!

Emaho! Six voices ceasing the wheel!

The speech conduct is equally important. The voice is the expression of mind. When the voice speaks with mindfulness, it becomes the vehicle of dharma. When the voice speaks without mindfulness, it perpetuates samsara. The six beings—gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings, asuras—each have their characteristic voice. But the practitioner learns to use the voice for liberation, not for confusion.

[4289-4293]
Listen! From Vajra Stacked Palace: "Whoever's conceptualized wheel itself, who can turn it? Afterward that one's mind-stream ceases!"

The conceptual wheel turns endlessly. We conceptualize the body, the speech, the mind. We conceptualize enlightenment, the path, the goal. But whoever conceptualizes this wheel—who can turn it? The one who recognizes the conceptual nature is the one whose mind-stream ceases. The conceptual mind, when recognized, relaxes into its own nature. There is no need to stop concepts—there is need to recognize their nature.

[4294-4303]
Then without projection-gathering, natural settling mindfulness' aperture self-ceases! From Glorious Sky Light: "Perception cut, aperture ceases!" Also body speech two without attachment, mind's root cut conduct appropriate. Self-traceless training, liberated from three realms! From Wheel Stacked: "Who divided mind's border, this not turning into mind!"

The natural settling: without projection-gathering, mindfulness's aperture self-ceases. When perception is cut, the aperture ceases. Body and speech without attachment, mind's root is cut—conduct becomes appropriate. Self-traceless training, liberated from the three realms. Who divides mind's border does not turn into mind.

[4304-4308]
Thus dividing border conduct three makes not entering three realms! From Near Empowerment: "Whichever border divided, not turning in three realms, to that natural settling shown!"

Do you see? Divide the border! Mind-stream ceases! Not entering three realms!

Emaho! Dividing the wheel's border!

The three types of conduct—body, speech, mind—each must divide its border. The body's border is the attachment to physicality. The speech's border is the attachment to conceptual expression. The mind's border is the attachment to thought itself. When these borders are divided, one does not enter the three realms. The natural settling is shown: whatever border is divided, to that natural settling leads.

[4335-4338]
Listen! Natural settling ritual also: "This time body speech mind's key point, yogi possessing natural settling do!"

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Natural settling: the ritual is not external—it is the key point of body, speech, mind. The yogi who possesses natural settling does not need elaborate external practices. The key point is this: body rests in its natural state, speech rests in silence, mind rests in awareness. This is the ritual that surpasses all rituals.

[4339-4345]
These purposes two: Common purpose—body speech mind three's obstacles pacified, sins obscurations purified. Supreme purpose—body speech mind three liberated. From that itself: "This purpose two types, supreme common divisions shown!"

The purposes are two. Common purpose: the obstacles of body, speech, mind are pacified, sins and obscurations purified. Supreme purpose: body, speech, mind are liberated. The teaching shows these two types: supreme and common divisions.

[4346-4354]
Meaning two: Actual basis uncontaminated wisdom continuum shown method two. Actual basis word explanation and meaning flow distinction. First, word extreme decided and meaning foremost settling two. First, actual basis four extremes basis, actual not, like seeing palace not seeing king—some Great Perfection, basis approached, body cannot take in hand, dharmadhatu vast, dying time ordinary death.

Meaning is two-fold: the actual basis is the uncontaminated wisdom continuum, shown through two methods. The actual basis word explanation and meaning-flow distinction: first, word extreme decided and meaning foremost settling. First, the actual basis is the basis of four extremes—it is not actual, like seeing a palace without seeing the king. Some Great Perfection approaches the basis, the body cannot take it in hand, dharmadhatu is vast, at dying time ordinary death occurs.

Do you see? Natural settling! Two purposes! Know the distinction!

Emaho! Natural settling of body speech mind!

[4366-4375]
Listen here, you who think wisdom is something you can find! Longchenpa destroys your worldly concept with just one phrase: "Later also meeting this difficult, world behind throwing away!"

What does this mean? The master is saying: When you encounter difficulties in Dzogchen practice, the tendency is to look for some exotic solution, some profound technique from another tradition! But Longchenpa laughs at this - "world behind throwing away" means abandoning ordinary conceptual frameworks entirely!

Don't you see? When practice becomes difficult, your mind immediately starts planning: "Maybe I need a different empowerment, maybe I need special mantra, maybe I need secret technique from ancient text." This is exactly what Longchenpa calls "throwing away the world" - abandoning this very world for some other world!

The sections of space: meditation without meditation, nature without searching, no difference in characteristics—these three. These are gathered into three thousand named tantras, eleven thousand chapters, twenty-two hundred million shlokas, eight hundred thousand recitations. These are gathered into two thousand distinctions, nine hundred proclamations, two thousand essential points, fifty essence spheres. These are gathered into fabricated liberation and posited liberation, liberated-as-is—three aspects.

[4376-4385]
Now the crucial teaching: "Rigpa natural settling actually introduced, vajra hanging-cord's vision seeing called!" What is "natural settling"? It's when awareness simply rests in its own nature, without any effort to maintain or improve it. Like water settling when you stop stirring - clarity happens by itself!

The "vajra hanging-cord" vision - this is profound! When awareness naturally settles, it sees through subtle channels directly. Not some visualization you create, not some technique you practice - it's the natural capacity of rigpa when not disturbed by conceptual mind.

"Also actually cannot be shown, rigpa said common ones expressed but foremost not arrived" - Oh, how this shatters your spiritual materialism! You think realization is something special that only advanced practitioners attain? Longchenpa says NO - rigpa has been expressed to everyone, but "foremost" (most realized) haven't recognized it because they're looking for something else!

"Like Vajra Seat not seeing telling its history, like blind color explaining to others" - This is devastatingly precise! A blind person trying to explain colors reveals their complete misunderstanding. But isn't this exactly what you do when you talk about enlightenment without having recognized it yourself?

Do you understand? Natural settling isn't an achievement - it's the cessation of seeking. Vajra vision isn't a technique - it's the natural clarity when seeking stops. Rigpa isn't something to be expressed - it's what's already present, unrecognized!

Emaho! Stop explaining Dzogchen and just let awareness settle!

[4386-4392]
Listen to this about thoughts! "Sometimes unborn empty rigpa thought, sometimes various dawns thought" - Longchenpa is describing how conceptual mind continues even after recognition! It creates "unborn empty" thoughts and "various dawns" experiences - all still conceptual overlay.

"These two word instruction nicely explained essence empty sky-like, dawning manner not ceasing, like mirror's reflection explained, but now existing-existing!" - The danger here is subtle: You might think "sky-like" means some experience, "mirror reflection" means some realization. Longchenpa says these are just explanations - but awareness itself "now existing" is beyond all concepts!

The method tantra and nature tantra: method tantra is awareness and pith instructions applying its meaning, divided into indicated-method tantra and indicating-method tantra. The essence: awareness pervading all beings, bodhicitta. The definitive term: that very thing, indicated-meaning and realization-basis and liberation-method, therefore called indicated-method tantra. Divisions: emptiness and clarity—two aspects.

Emptiness: awareness-essence empty of thing and mark dharmas in all, free from elaboration extremes, primordially abiding. Clarity: that clarity, not entirely empty, self-light five wisdoms' clear appearance, warmth and coolness and lightness, vast nature chief five elements primordially spontaneously complete, compassion's resonance unceasingly arising, awareness primordially pervading.

[4393-4400]
Listen! Thigle relying liberation signs: thigle subtle coil possessing! Rigpa channel key point relying liberation signs: hanging-cord subtle crooked connection possessing! These three rigpa actual not, but relying on that virtue force key point liberates!

The liberation signs: thigle (bindu) relying liberation signs—subtle coil possessing. Rigpa channel key point relying liberation signs—hanging-cord subtle crooked connection possessing. These three are not actual rigpa, but relying on that virtue force, the key point liberates.

The sections of space in pith instructions: space of play without cessation, space of mind without liberation, space of essence without good or bad. These are gathered into twelve thousand two hundred named tantras, twenty-four thousand chapters, twenty-one hundred million shlokas, eleven thousand recitations, four thousand distinctions, two thousand five hundred proclamations, eighty-seven essence spheres. These are gathered into three aspects: essential points gathered, essential points seen, essential points known.

The tantra essence: awareness and the basis establishing it—the great secret place unable to be added to or subtracted from, decisive. The definitive term: showing family, therefore tantra—that which causes birth in whatever family, therefore continuum. Decisive and unbroken continuity, therefore tantra.

Divisions: nature-meaning tantra and indicating-word tantra. Meaning tantra is: mind-itself luminosity by nature, free from conceptualization stains, abiding permanently in all, therefore tantra, Buddha family, therefore tantra, possessing Buddha characteristics, therefore posited as tantra. Word tantra is: that very thing indicated by name-word-letter nature, divided into chapters, generation stage primarily method, perfection stage primarily wisdom, both equally non-dual union, showing transcendence of all—Great Perfection essential point revealers.

This old wanderer has traversed these teachings. The body, speech, mind conduct—the three doors to liberation. The natural settling is not something you do but something you allow. The elaborate classifications—the three spaces, the thousands of tantras, the countless divisions—all point to the same thing: the nature of awareness, always present, always available, never needing to be achieved because it already is.

Rest in that recognition. The conduct—body, speech, mind—becomes the path when recognized. The elaborate system is the finger pointing. The recognition is the moon. Put aside the finger, see the moon, rest in that seeing.

Now I will explain further the detailed classifications. The text shows how all tantras and teachings are organized. First, the sections of space gathered into three spaces: space of meditation without meditation, space of nature without searching, space of no difference in characteristics—these three. These are gathered into three thousand named tantras, eleven thousand chapters, twenty-two hundred million shlokas, eight hundred thousand recitations, two thousand distinctions, nine hundred proclamations, two thousand essential points, fifty essence spheres. These are gathered into fabricated liberation, posited liberation, liberated-as-is—three aspects gathered into space sections.

All pith instruction sections are gathered into three spaces: space of play without cessation, space of mind without liberation, space of essence without good or bad. These are gathered into twelve thousand two hundred named tantras, twenty-four thousand chapters, twenty-one hundred million shlokas, eleven thousand recitations, four thousand distinctions, two thousand five hundred proclamations, eighty-seven essence spheres, three aspects: essential points gathered, essential points seen, essential points known.

These are gathered into two: oral transmission and scriptures. Though scriptures are many—tantras, scriptures, and pith instruction scriptures—these three gathered. Though pith instruction scriptures are extremely many, there are refutation, accomplishment, intention, and recitation-focused scriptures—four gathered.

The recitation divisions: recitation of intentional-meaning pith instructions, recitation of abiding-nature essence, recitation of philosophical system words, recitation of non-dual samsara-nirvana—four gathered. All of these are gathered into three: spreading essential points, taming proclamations, direct introduction, and establishing directly in one's own essential point.

The nature of tantra sections has three aspects: brief showing of tantra framework, detailed explanation of its nature, determination of explanation method branches. The first has six aspects: tantra essence, definitive term, divisions, reading measure, example, and proof.

The essence of tantra: awareness and the basis establishing it—the great secret place unable to be added to or subtracted from, decisive. The definitive term: showing family, therefore tantra—that which causes birth in whatever family, therefore continuum. Decisive and unbroken continuity, therefore tantra.

The divisions: nature-meaning tantra and indicating-word tantra, two aspects. Meaning tantra is: mind-itself luminosity by nature, free from conceptualization stains, abiding permanently in all, therefore tantra, Buddha family, therefore tantra, possessing Buddha characteristics, therefore posited as tantra. Word tantra is: that very thing indicated by name-word-letter nature, divided into chapters, generation stage primarily method, perfection stage primarily wisdom, both equally non-dual union, showing transcendence of all—Great Perfection essential point revealers.

The reading measure for generation stage: chief, ten aspects—first, basis empowerment and samaya two, deity and mantra two, mandala and offering two, concentration and conduct two, activity and view two, these ten complete, generation stage chief tantra. The perfection stage reading measure: view and result two, conduct and meditation two, mind and wisdom two, experience and instruction two—these eight complete, perfection stage chief reading measure. Non-dual union: both of these must be complete, eighteen. Great Perfection complete: generation and perfection two, perfection stage—lesser elaboration showing channels-winds-bindus, great showing clear light wisdom stage two, great: its reading measure, entering door, empowerment and samaya two, path and recitation two, result and five complete.

Example: like warp threads, depending on many cause threads, woven into cloth, depending on different words, revealing single meaning. Proof: tantra abiding in oneself, showing indicator, therefore proven as tantra. Moreover, depending on word-essential points, meaning-place without error decisively established, realizing, therefore posited as tantra.

The detailed explanation of meaning tantra and word tantra. First: method tantra and nature tantra. Method tantra: awareness and pith instructions applying its meaning. Divisions: indicated-method tantra and indicating-method tantra. First, essence: awareness pervading all beings, bodhicitta. Definitive term: that very thing, indicated-meaning and realization-basis and liberation-method, therefore called indicated-method tantra. Divisions: emptiness and clarity—two aspects.

Emptiness: awareness-essence empty of thing and mark dharmas in all, free from elaboration extremes, primordially abiding. Clarity: that clarity, not entirely empty, self-light five wisdoms' clear appearance, warmth and coolness and lightness, vast nature chief five elements primordially spontaneously complete, compassion's resonance unceasingly arising, awareness primordially pervading. Moreover, awareness clarity-emptiness great wisdom pervading all beings, called indicated-method tantra.

The Pearl Garland says: all Buddhas' method tantra, single basis essence distinction, indicated and indicating. Indicated tantra single pervader, all connected as its following. Pervasion has two aspects: emptiness pervasion and clarity pervasion. Emptiness single cause without thing, transcending all things' dharmas. Actual non-appearance single pervader, all become basis single essence. Pervader itself gathering. Unborn mindfulness exhausted by essence distinction. Empty and appearing, appearing and empty. Actual and non-actual both. Exhausted, therefore primordially empty abiding. Free from causes and conditions, empty object. Pervading vast non-actual essence empty. Stainless and unmixed complete. Without concept empty nature. Emptiness pervading, therefore tantra.

Clarity: clear, nature not ceased. Illuminating appearance and pervader. Clear and warmth and coolness. Vast and moving essence holder. Pervasion and self-resonance self-clear. Liberating ripening seed. From emptiness reverse, therefore clarity pervades. Sudden and self-liberation. Self-arisen clarity connected with body. Stainless and individually clear. Without grasping clear object appearing. Looking far with clarity pervasion, binding the clear expanse of space. Not cut off, pervading sphere. Pervading essential points essential. Signs of seeing completely liberated. Moving and pervading essential points. Spheres connected with body. Pervading signs pervading essential points. Reversing through pervasion.

Here, seeing awareness like a chain, awareness' nature without good or bad, without change, all from that state without other destination, therefore called basis, other wandering impossible. Moreover, awareness bound by wind essential point liberated sign, coming and going, existing, depending on bindu liberated sign, subtle bindu sphere existing, awareness depending on channel essential point liberated sign, chain subtle and curved connection existing. These three, awareness not actual, first instant distinction parted.

This old wanderer has traversed these teachings. The elaborate classification system—thousands of tantras, countless divisions—is not meant to bind you but to free you. Each classification is a finger pointing to an aspect of the one reality. When you understand this, the elaborate system becomes a support, not a chain. The body, speech, mind conduct—these three—are the doors through which awareness displays. When recognized, these displays are the kayas. When not recognized, they are samsara. The division is not in the displays themselves but in the recognition.

Thus, the practitioner rests in natural settling. The body rests in its natural state—not forcing posture, not seeking comfort, just resting. The speech rests in natural silence—not forcing silence, not speaking uselessly, just resting. The mind rests in its own awareness—not controlling thoughts, not following thoughts, just resting. This is the conduct of Dzogchen: natural settling of body, speech, mind.
