First: vital points of body, speech, mind—press them. Lus ngag yid gsum
gyi gnad—body speech mind's crucial points. Gzir ba—pressing, not crushing
but activating. Without pressing, wisdom doesn't know where to arise.

This wanderer spent years avoiding pressure. Thought dzogchen meant doing
nothing. Then his teacher pressed his shoulder: "Here. Feel this. This is
where wisdom waits." The pressing revealed what relaxation concealed.

[4425-4425]
Press the points—not to create wisdom, but to reveal its place. Like
pressing a spring to find water—not creating water, but revealing where
it already flows. Body's channels, speech's resonance, mind's awareness—
each has its pressure point.

[4425-4425]
Press the points. Crucial activation. Recognition dawns. Three words, or
maybe just: Touch. The rest happens by itself.

[4425-4425]
Then wisdom arises in its place—sna shes pa'i sa, the ground of knowing
where wisdom is born. Not somewhere else, not later, but here where pressure
meets recognition. Press. Wisdom knows its own place.
