Second: speech mixing. Ordinary chatter merges with vajra speech, becoming
speech nature. Not learning new words, but recognizing emptiness-resonance
of all words. Like echo in canyon—sound and return not two, yet distinguishable.

This wanderer recited mantras for years, believing certain sounds sacred,
others profane. Then child laughed at his serious face. That laughter—
empty, resonant, immediately gone—taught what no retreat had.

[8724-8724]
Mixing—not blending like colors, but inseparability of water and wetness.
Ordinary speech is vajra speech seen through. Vajra speech is ordinary
speech recognized.

[8724-8724]
Mixing occurs. Nature revealed. Speech liberated. Three aspects of one
process—like inhale, pause, exhale. Not really three separate things.

[8724-8724]
See. Speech nature not achieved—it is nature of all speech, recognized or not.
This recognition is the union.
