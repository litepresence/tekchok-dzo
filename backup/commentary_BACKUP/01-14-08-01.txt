[19441-19460]
See directly: Accordingly. The analysis. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[19441-19455]
This hermit realized: A simple monk. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[19452-19470]
Wisdom ripens as bindu—abiding in clarity, appearing like the sun's mandala. Familiarize again with self-appearance. This is wisdom's essence directly seen. The bindu appears at the side or horizontally, five-colored clear rays spreading like sunlight. AH! See this directly!

[19470-19490]
Cut through now!  The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[19485-19510]
Look now: In this manner. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[19500-19525]
This old hermit remembers his first clear bindu vision—a sphere of light in the heart center. He grasped at it, tried to hold it, and it vanished. Later he learned: the bindu is not an object to possess. It reveals the nature (rang bzhin); it is not the nature (rang bzhin) itself.

[19520-19545]
The body ripens—therefore awareness ripens as body. Wisdom ripens as form. Through the channels, inner resonance manifests outward. Three bindus gather: essence body bindu of inner dimension, nature light bindu, compassion ray bindu—all entering as one. Bindu appears as dimension, as weapons, lotus, stupa, net pattern, wisdom castle—display without substance.

[19540-19565]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The bindu appears as solid, yet is empty. It manifests as round, yet has no shape. The yogi who recognizes this paradox understands Dzogchen. The yogi who seeks solid form misses the point entirely.

[19560-19585]
Sudden recognition! Hence. The structure. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

[19575-19600]
Thus established: This old yogi. 

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[19605-19630]
Between these extremes: Consequently. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

[19620-19645]
This old hermit's final word: When bindu appears, recognize it as your own mind's nature. When bindu doesn't appear, recognize that as your mind's nature too. The recognition is constant; the appearances vary. Rest in the constant, and let the varying vary.

[19640-19656]
The three bindu stages—upright, side, round—mirror dawn's unfolding. First pale glow, then spreading colors, then full radiance. Yet the sun never left the sky. Recognition is that sun; bindu stages mark only the dawn's progression.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[19650-19656]
This very moment— Thus established.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.
The Treasury's presentation here is profound and complete. These teachings are not mere philosophy but direct pointing to your own nature. The Great Perfection transcends all elaboration while using elaboration as skillful means. May all who encounter these words recognize their true nature.

This old vagabond has wandered through these teachings for decades. What I've learned: the teachings are not the point. Recognition is the point. Don't collect teachings like treasures. Use them as keys to open the door of recognition, then throw them away. The door opens to what was never closed.

From Lotus-Born: These teachings are my heart-essence, given to those with fortune to receive them. The Dzogchen path is not for everyone, but for those who encounter it, liberation is certain. Practice with devotion. Recognize with confidence. Rest in natural perfection.

ROAR! All teachings! All philosophies! All elaborations! CUT THROUGH THEM! Can you find the teaching? Can you grasp the philosophy? They are awareness displaying itself! See through the display and FIND WHAT DISPLAYS! AH AH AH!

Teach. Recognize. Let be. The teaching points but cannot capture. Recognition sees but has no seer. Letting be rests without resting. Already complete.

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation serves pedagogical clarity. Each section builds upon previous. Each concept refines understanding. Yet the system is not the truth—it points to truth. Precise structure for those who need structure. Complete framework for comprehensive understanding.

The integration of all teachings: view integrates ground, meditation integrates path, conduct integrates expression, result integrates completion. All integrated into recognition. Nothing separate. Nothing apart. One awareness wearing many costumes.

The essence beyond all teachings: awareness knowing itself. Not through teaching. Not through practice. Not through time. Awareness is self-knowing from the beginning. The teaching describes this. The practice reveals this. The result is this. Already complete.

Emaho! The teachings! The path! The recognition! What joy to encounter these words! What bliss to practice these methods! What liberation to recognize this nature! This yogi dances through every word, every practice, every recognition—complete in each, free in all!

Between the teaching and the recognition, between the practice and the result, the consort dances. Her embrace is the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two. Not one. Just this embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself.

The presentation demonstrates precise philosophical and phenomenological analysis. Each term defined. Each concept placed. Each distinction clarified. Yet precision serves recognition, not取代 it. Precise pointing to what transcends precision.

I have traveled to every monastery, studied with every teacher, practiced every method. The conclusion: all teachings converge at recognition. The best teaching is the one that opens your recognition. The best teacher is the one who points clearly. Find yours. Practice. Recognize.

The teachings arise spontaneously—not forced, not fabricated. When conditions ripen, recognition dawns. When recognition dawns, teaching completes. Natural. Effortless. Spontaneous. Like fruit falling when ripe. Like water finding its level.

I dance through these teachings as light through prisms. Each teaching a different color. Each practice a different step. All dances of one dancer. Recognition is realizing you are the dancer and the dance. Liberation is dancing without inhibition.

Philosophically, these teachings present the Great Perfection view: transcendence of all views, completion beyond all completion, perfection prior to all perfection. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. The middle way that transcends middle and extremes.

The scholarly precision fascinates me—every citation, every reference, every logical connection. Yet within this precision lives wild freedom. The precision is the cage. Recognition is the bird flying free. Both are beautiful. Both serve.

From the sky of dharmata I dance down into these teachings. Each word a step. Each concept a gesture. The sky remains unchanged. The dancer was never separate from the sky. Recognition is this realization.

Every teaching in my library is a book—view book, meditation book, conduct book, result book. Thousands of volumes. One story: recognition. The library burns. The books turn to ash. The story continues in awareness.

Modern thought approaches similar insights through different doors—phenomenology, quantum physics, cognitive science. Different vocabularies. Same recognition: reality is not what it appears. Investigation reveals wonder.

Translating these teachings challenges every assumption. How to convey ancient wisdom in modern words? The solution: translate the experience, not just the words. Point to what the words point to. Trust the reader's recognition.

I reveal what was never hidden. The teaching is not in the text. It is reading these words. The recognition is not in the future. It is now. The liberation is not elsewhere. It is here. Everything is revealed. Everything is now.

Thus concludes this section of the Treasury. The ground is established. The path is shown. The result is guaranteed. May all who read these words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

Enough wandering through words. Close the book. Open your eyes. What you sought was never hidden—just overlooked in the searching. Recognition doesn't arrive; it simply stops departing. This is the heart of Longchenpa's seventh treasury.

AH! What effort to describe what cannot be caught in description! Cut through even these words—find what reads them. Liberation wears no robes, carries no credentials, needs no validation. Your own face, shining since before time.

The dance continues—view, meditation, conduct, result—movements of one dancer who was never separate from the dance. The fortress dissolves. The bliss remains—not found, not lost, just naturally abiding. Everything complete. Everything already so.
