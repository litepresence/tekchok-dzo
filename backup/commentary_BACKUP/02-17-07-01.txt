[3005-3018]
See what is. The dream state—not as escape, not as entertainment, but as the
yogin's path. When water rushes toward you in sleep, when fire burns, when dogs
chase, when enemies attack—recognize. This is the moment. Train now, and
certainty comes.

This old fool spent years chasing dreams. Visions. Prophecies. Special experiences.
One night he dreamed of falling into a river. Panic rose. Then he remembered.
"This is a dream." The river became a path. The falling became flight. Recognition
dawns in an instant—after years of preparation.

[3019-3032]
Three crucial points: training, transformation, cutting. Not separate practices.
One recognition in three aspects. Training builds the foundation.
Transformation deepens. Cutting liberates completely.

During daytime, view all appearances as last night's dream. Hold this intention.
Practice emanation. Practice transformation. The external has no true existence—
see this in every moment. The mind that trains—look at its nature. Free from root.
Free from basis.

[3033-3045]
Thus. The training proceeds: non-grasping, non-fixating, groundless recognition.
Appearances are the nature's display. One-pointed yet relaxed. Unwavering yet
spacious. Gradually, karmic traces dissolve. Deluded perception melts.

Mountain hermit trained for twenty years. Every appearance, he questioned: "Is
this dream or waking?" Finally he could not tell the difference. Day and night
merged into one continuous recognition. The Dharmata wheel never left.

[3046-3058]
Second: transformation. Not rejecting dream appearances, but recognizing their
nature. Transform forms into deity mandalas. Transform emptiness into vast
expanse. Mirror-like reflection displaying Buddha fields. The eight examples of
illusion—alive in dream.

Clouds dissolve in sky. Smoke clears. Deluded appearances become vast
emptiness in an instant. Train in this, and the dream transforms itself.

[3059-3070]
Third: cutting through. However dreams appear, do not grasp. Do not hold the
apprehender. Do not cling to forms. Release self-clear awareness openly,
spaciously, without mental fabrication.

Dreams become coarse, then subtle, then barely remembered, then brief, then
nothing. Rigpa self-clear samadhi. Day-night union—not a state to achieve, but
the natural condition.

[3071-3080]
Between the elaborate techniques and simple recognition, we find the vast middle
way. Not rejecting methods. Not grasping them. The raft carries you across, then
is left behind.

This wandering yogi met a dream master who hadn't dreamed in thirty years.
"What happened to your dreams?" The master laughed. "I recognized the dreamer.
When the dreamer is seen through, what remains? Continuous recognition has no
day or night."

[3081-3090]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: do not make dream yoga into achievement!
Do not collect experiences like trophies! The point is not amazing dreams. The
point is recognizing the dreamer's nature. Stop chasing. Start seeing.

[3091-3100]
Singing yogi's gentle penetration: While you cook, while you walk, while you
laugh—the awareness that knows these is the same awareness that knows
dreams. Never separate. Never apart. Everyday life is the practice.

[3101-3110]
Essence holder's spacious instruction: Rest in the view. Do not try to create
anything. Do not try to stop anything. The resting itself is the path. The path
itself is the result.

[3111-3120]
Ecstatic tertön's urgency: Why wait even a moment? The recognition is available
now. Not tonight. Not in dream. Now, while reading these words. See the nature!

[3121-3130]
Visionary devotee's longing: How I long to recognize the dream as dream! How I
yearn for the guru's blessing that opens the eyes! Devotion itself is recognition
waiting to dawn.

[3131-End]
Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: You want to fly? Visit pure lands? Meanwhile, the
awareness that dreams is always awake. Stop playing. Wake up completely.

Three words. Dream. Recognize. Wake. Hold these. Forget these. Recognition
remains.
