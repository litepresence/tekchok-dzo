Spontaneous presence cannot be the basis of liberation. This is not negation—it is precision. If all were spontaneously accomplished from the beginning, who would need to practice? Who would become liberated? The path would be meaningless.

The text examines each position with surgical precision. First: the position holding that the ground of samsara and nirvana is mere unceasing display. This fails upon analysis. Why? Because if rigpa were merely unceasing display without recognition, it would be unreasonable for samsara and nirvana to arise and cease without any recognition of its own face.

[10548-10557]
This old man once wandered in the mountains, thinking spontaneous presence was enough. I rested in naked awareness, letting everything display without干预. Years passed. Confusion remained. Liberation did not arrive. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

If the basis were merely spontaneous presence, samsara and nirvana would be one. The nature is complete. The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Wherever samsara is, nirvana would be. Wherever nirvana is, samsara would be.

 The pure would be impure. The impure would be pure. The path dissolves into contradiction.

[10548-10560]
Therefore. Thus. We analyze the logical faults. Spontaneous presence as the sole basis fails under scrutiny. Not because it is wrong. Because it is incomplete. Like describing an elephant by its tail alone.

The text gives logical reasons: If cause and effect were both primordially spontaneously accomplished from the very beginning without any dependence on recognition, then cause and effect would necessarily exist simultaneously as one essence, rendering all distinction meaningless. If the cause is established as samsara, the effect would clearly not be able to manifest as nirvana, for they would be identical. If samsara and nirvana were truly one essence, then samsara would necessarily follow wherever nirvana is present. And nirvana following upon samsara would cause those two to be one without distinction—an absurd consequence.

Pure and impure cannot exist simultaneously as cause and effect if they are one substance. This is not philosophical hair-splitting—this is the precise medicine needed for precise diseases of view.

[10561-10584]
From Klongdrukpa: Spontaneous accomplishment being posited as the basis is truly not the correct basis. If it were, sentient beings without effort would never attain liberation. Non-recognition becomes the cause of continued obscuration. If mere awareness were sufficient for liberation, then liberation would not be distinct from ordinary existence. Like charcoal upon black earth cannot be cleaned to appear white. Cause and effect would remain separate without connection.

The tantra speaks in analogies the mind can grasp. Charcoal and black earth—same nature, different appearance. You cannot wash charcoal white. Not because washing fails. Because the nature (rang bzhin) is black. Liberation requires recognition, not just presence.

Samantabhadra declares: This teaching of spontaneous presence exists merely among conventional dharmas known by intellect. It is not the correct essence of the ultimate basis. Even the Primordial Buddha distinguishes between conventional description and ultimate reality.

Thus it is declared: mere unceasing display cannot truly constitute the authentic recognition of realization. If cause and effect were established as truly one without distinction, then recognition and resting in one's own nature would become entirely unnecessary, rendering the direct path meaningless. To merely name unceasing display as the ground without understanding its true relation to primordial purity is not a meaning that can be genuinely understood or established through direct recognition.

[10585-10593]
Second position: uncertainty as the basis. Because awareness is not established as definite entity, it remains uncertain. Because conditions transform it, it remains without fixed nature. The Mind Section teaches: From manifold names given to uncertainty, meaning is merely labels, empty like echoes.

This practitioner once loved uncertainty. It felt spacious. Liberating. No fixed views. No certainties to defend. Then he saw: uncertainty itself becomes a fixed view. The open door becomes another prison.

The Semde teachings say: From the manifold names and designations given to uncertainty, the meaning too is merely labels, empty in themselves like echoes. Because the nature is not determined as singular or fixed, whatever label is applied through convention appears accordingly without inherent reality.

[10594-10607]
Refutation: If the basis were one essence, it could not be non-one—a direct contradiction. If uncertain basis were cause of samsara, it would be determined as confusion. If basis of nirvana, determined as purity. Both cannot be true. If inherently pure, impurity cannot arise. If uncertain, samsara and nirvana mix without distinction. Buddhas would revert to confusion. The basis would become mind's possession rather than nature.

The logic is merciless. Each position examined finds its own destruction. This is not cruelty. It is compassion wearing the mask of destruction. The positions must die so recognition can live.

Further faults: If the basis remains uncertain without any determinate ground or established nature, samsara and nirvana would mutually mix together without distinction, destroying the path and fruition. If the basis is fundamentally uncertain and changes in every regard without any stability, all sentient beings would be liberated without any effort or practice whatsoever, while fully awakened Buddhas would revert to impure confusion, once again engaging with suffering. Moreover, asserting only uncertainty would itself constitute a form of determination, contradicting the original claim.

[10548-10607]
Three words. Spontaneous presence. Uncertainty. Both incomplete. The basis is prior to both. Prior to determination and indetermination. Prior to existence and non-existence. Find that. Rest there.

The Klongdrukpa confirms: The basis taught as fundamentally uncertain and indeterminate—this too cannot truly constitute the authentic basis of reality. I understand at this level of intelligence and analysis that effects must necessarily possess alternation and change, or become endowed with reversion to their cause. The uncertain itself becomes determined through its own existence, and thus the uncertain becomes determined despite claims otherwise. Because uncertainty must exist in itself to be asserted, being determined would be like the exhaustion of all possible action.

[10607]
Between the position and its refutation, the vast middle way opens. Not spontaneous presence alone. Not uncertainty alone. The unity of primordial purity and spontaneous presence. Ka dag and lhun grub as indivisible. This is the authentic Great Perfection.

[10610-10620]
Thus. We proceed.
The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Now the third position arises: Because the essence of awareness does not change in its nature, it is like space itself—pervasive and unchanging. Appearances, being unable to change in their fundamental nature, are accepted as determined and fixed, like the nature of fire and water.

But this too fails logical scrutiny: If the essence of awareness does not change in any way and appearances likewise cannot change, then samsara arising from that unchanging basis is not logically valid, and consequently no one could possibly attain liberation from what never arose. If nirvana existed primordially as an unchanging essence, there would be no difference from the eternalists' view of permanence maintained by non-Buddhist philosophers.

Furthermore, if one accepts that the essence of samsara, already being nirvana in itself, does not change, then if the essence itself is already nirvana without change, liberation through practice would not be necessary at all—just as fire, being hot by its very nature, requires no change or effort to become hot.

If one says this analysis is necessary only regarding mental appearances and not the basis itself, this contradicts the fundamental position that appearances cannot change if the basis is unchanging. Being that the appearance of samsara itself manifests from the basis, if one says it is not the appearance of the basis but something separate, it necessarily follows that that basis would possess duality—appearing and not appearing—which is absurd.

Moreover, if one realizes that basis and accepts determination, it cannot constitute the authentic basis that transcends all extremes. If a basis of realization were to exist inherently before realization itself occurs, then a merely cognizing mind arises independently, and thus realization does not depend upon realizing the basis—making realization meaningless. Yet the basis depends upon the mind of realization to be known, creating circular dependence. Because realization must exist beforehand to realize the basis, this logical error pervades the entire position.

The Klongdrukpa declares: Regarding the determined basis that is taught by some proponents, this too is not the correct essence of the authentic basis. Just as for those with the eye disease of yellowing vision, a pure white conch appears mistakenly as yellow, through the distinction of reversion to oneself and other, self and other are free of the two extremes of determination. Therefore that view too is not correct upon analysis. Because cause is determined and effect is determined as identical, the self becomes no different from the eternalist view of permanence.

Now the fourth position: The essence is not divided into directions or categories in its true nature, while appearances are changeable in whatever manner through conditions. But if the basis were truly changeable in its essence, pure enlightened Buddhas would devolve into impure confusion. Furthermore, whoever accepts this unacceptable consequence follows that sentient beings, without any effort or practice, spontaneously change into Buddhas and are liberated. Also, effect would illogically revert to cause, destroying temporal sequence. Earth and other material elements would become awareness, and awareness would also devolve into matter—absurd consequences.

The reasoning continues: If that which is not divided into categories of essence in the basis itself changes, or if appearances other than essence change, if the essence itself changes, essence cannot coherently be called the basis. Because it would change into a dharma other than the authentic basis. If appearances other than essence change, the essence itself would be damaged by changing somewhere, compromising its integrity.

Does the permanent change, or does the impermanent change in this view? The permanent cannot change by definition, like space which remains unaltered. The impermanent does not need to change through effort, for it has already changed by its very nature. Also, through the reasoning of the three times—past, present, and future—past and future cannot be changed, being non-existent in the present moment. The present has already arisen and immediately ceased, so it cannot be changed. The later part of a moment is not yet born, being non-existent, so there is nothing to change. Because change cannot be perceived in any of the three times, that the basis is changeable in whatever way is not logically valid.

The Klongdrukpa concludes: If one's own state of the basis is held to be changeable, this too is no different from being fundamentally undetermined. Because effect itself reverts to cause without sequence, effort becomes unnecessary for those who hold this view. Because again and again it reverts circularly, who could possibly make matter into awareness? It is not possible by any valid reasoning.

Fifth position: Because awareness, in its essence, has no fixed direction and arises pervasively everywhere, it accepts whatever arises without discrimination. This too fails—if it accepts appearances, does it dwell in the basis as the same essence, or does it not dwell in the basis as separate?
