reveal the fourfold unelaborate—gateway to mind's change! This is the treasury's heart.

First, unelaborate of unelaborate! Through this, fortunate mind changes! Second, unelaborate without elaboration! The method to enter inside shown! Third, very unelaborate without elaboration! Concepts purify, mind changes! Fourth, special unelaborate without elaborate! Meaning of non-duality obtained!

These four empowerments are like four keys to four gates! Each opens deeper than the last! Body, speech, mind, consciousness—each finds bliss through purification!

reveal the three kayas' display! Unelaborate shows nirmanakaya field—aggregates, elements, sense bases emptied! Very unelaborate shows sambhogakaya field—mind's coming and going realized as non-existent! Special unelaborate gives dharmakaya prophecy—samsara and nirvana's attachment, subtle knowledge obscuration purified!

Like a knot untying itself! Like ice melting in the sun! Effortless self-liberation!

Second, self-face difference extensively explained! Four empowerments elaborated! Elaborate-with-elaborate—drink water, outer! Elaborate-without-elaborate—enter mandala, deity shown, name given! Elaborate-with-very-elaborate—sravaka vow, nine complete, breath held! Elaborate-with-special-elaborate—vase certain, body seal perfect!

Progressive like grades in school! Each builds the foundation for the next! You drink, you enter, you receive—each empowerment opens what was closed!

Also vase certain explained! Palace relied upon, deity clear! Student body becomes deity, four elements purified! Substance sun-moon given, consort given, practice certain, sign-meaning-word given!

Like receiving a key to a locked treasure house! Like being given the crown of a king! Receiving opens recognition!

Emaho! The four gates to liberation!

Thus established. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

An old vagabond. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[8841-8841]
See your own face. 

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[8841-8841]
The framework reveals. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who collect empowerments like stamps! Those who count initiations like coins! They miss the point entirely. One empowerment fully received is worth more than a hundred taken casually. The unelaborate is not found in numbers but in recognition.

[8841-8841]
Between elaboration and non-elaboration, the vast middle way opens. The elaborate is not wrong; the unelaborate is not right. They are two aspects of one reality, like two wings of one bird. Fly with both, or don't fly at all.

[8841-8841]
This old hermit received many empowerments in his youth. He kept lists, counted blessings, treasured his certificates. Then one day he lost them all in a fire. At first he wept. Then he laughed—what was lost? Paper. What remained? Recognition. The true empowerment cannot be burned.

[8841-8841]
Analysis proceeds. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
