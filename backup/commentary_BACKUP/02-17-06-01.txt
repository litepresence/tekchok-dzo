[2779-2783]
First, also shown before. Particularly: channel main-point, navel below avadhuti below, forehead mouth upper, nada red and fire seed AH red shining, from tangible heat, fire blazes. Channel inside warmed, from crown HAM, bodhicitta white-red dripping, four wheels and body all pervading, meditate. Holding only wind in avadhuti below mouth, four wheels inside channels, wind bindu essence water one, refine. From that, heat and wisdom arising, is path actual main method supreme explained.

[2779-2783]
Three words. Channel. Wind. Bindu. These three are the subtle body. Not physical. Energetic. The channel is the pathway. The wind is the movement. The bindu is the essence. Together they create the conditions for recognition.

[2779-2783]
The First Point speaks: See what is. The channels are not imaginary. They are the structure of energetic body. The winds are not breath. They are the movement of mind. The bindus are not physical drops. They are the essence of awareness. Recognize this.

[2784-2786]
That accessory, prajña relying, other body method path main-point, former shown four as helper. Not relying, great bliss bindu radiate-drip. Bliss channels two slowly press, tongue small move, experience knowing.

[2784-2786]
The Vagabond speaks: This old fool once tried these practices without understanding. He forced the winds. He squeezed the channels. He became tense. His teacher laughed. "You are trying to catch the wind in your fist," he said. "Open your hand. Let the wind move." This was the instruction.

[2787-2798]
Wind practice, clear light equal main-point certainty enter. That definite also from Thalgyur: "Rely on wind, separate action-mind. Because three realms precipice hole cut. Body-speech attachment depth reverse. Because six migrations precipice equal. Body-speech-mind points all pierce. Because mind-itself dharmata mix. Wind and awareness upward draw. Because deluded appearance exhaust, always familiarize wind."

[2787-2798]
The Systematizer speaks: Thus. We enumerate. The wind practice has outer, inner, secret meanings. Outer: breath control. Inner: energy movement. Secret: awareness rising. The three are one. The breath slows. The energy stabilizes. The awareness clears. This is the method.

[2789-2798]
From Thalgyur: Rely on wind to separate action from mind. Cut the hole of the three realms. Reverse attachment to body and speech. Equalize the precipice of six migrations. Pierce all points of body, speech, and mind. Mix mind-itself with dharmata. Draw wind and awareness upward. Exhaust deluded appearance. Always familiarize with wind.

[2799-2819]
That method and obstacle victory, nectar and element equal-taste, two main-points. Nectar: smear reverse with food and beer, eat, separate from bad smell. Do oil: use essence boiled in pot. From that: body arising continuum cut. Wonder! Great essence extraction explained. Always reversing feces. Finally body outflows cease. By essence-extracted oil, with marks shown, elements' continuums cease.

[2799-2819]
Body elements' continuum cut, sentient beings don't dwell in body. Without excrement, urine, etc. Without outer-inner wind. This time is great yogi! Food and clothes both become pure. Upon this lifespan and enjoyment, certainly accomplish as wished.

[2799-2819]
The Lotus-Born speaks: From Oddiyana, I see these practices as preparations. Not the goal. The goal is recognition. These practices purify the body. They make it a suitable vessel. But do not mistake the vessel for what it contains. The nectar is not about physical sustenance. It is about recognizing the body's natural purity.

[2820-2836]
Equal-taste of elements: holding four winds of earth, water, fire, and wind. Body essence-extraction pure, four wheels' mandala, channel-wind-essence practice former, extensive, lifespan, enjoyment, food, clothes accomplish. From that: if four elements, equal-taste making yogin, earth, water, fire, wind main-point, body mixed, wind hide, self-body each's elements, transform, that itself use. Point-gathered mandala meditate. That familiarized, measure complete. Four powers equal, bliss use, free from fear. This also food and clothes two accomplish, lifespan and enjoyment complete.

[2820-2836]
The Integrator speaks: All these practices integrate in recognition. The nectar practice. The equal-taste practice. The wind practice. They prepare the body. They stabilize the energy. They clarify the mind. But the recognition transcends them all. The practices are fingers. The recognition is the moon.

[2836-2870]
This time, inner vessel letter recite drive, or power other transfer, or body yantra drive. From Thalgyur: "Other continuum not explained, elements' sicknesses transfer and reverse. Listen to profound definite explanation! Wind and bile phlegm, two-mixed and three-mixed. By that half and twelve parts. Sequence time definite, cause two, conditions eight, heat and cold direction, outer-inner field two pair, body and limbs expert divide. Upper-lower belly place, three main-points possess, sicknesses transfer. Body's yantra various, binding pressing action, elements' main-points draw back. Body and limbs outer-inner, definite pair, mind reverse!"

[2836-2870]
The Lion-Faced speaks: See through these practices! The transfer! The yantra! The manipulation! See through them! They are methods! Methods are not the recognition! Use them and release them! Do not cling!

[2871-2910]
Three doors' yantra: body, speech, mind. Body: various yantra, lion and elephant, vulture and sheep rubbing, wolf and human, insects etc. Body and yantra various, outer-inner upper-lower body limbs, wind-bile-phlegm mixed, elements' sickness strike four parts. Heat and cold ends, that and that action, sickness liberated. Speech: various sound voices, ali-kali clear, nature root abiding, letter recite manner six, each's place pair, god and naga, yakṣa and rākṣasa, garuda, Brahmā and Indra, Viṣṇu, ḍākinī and lha-klu pure voice, nāga and water-vessel, belly-stomach, ḍākinī, remaining entities' voice, each's voice pair, liberated. Mind: various mindfulness, how change, limit, yogin's awareness divide. Other also body-speech-mind transform. Or mind action's work, various samadhi transform. From suffering also end-different.

[2871-2910]
The Essence Holder speaks: Rest in the nature. These yantras are not the point. The recognition is the point. The body practices support recognition. The speech practices support recognition. The mind practices support recognition. But they are not recognition itself. Rest as that which practices.

[2911-2963]
Transfer: well-trained winds, own sickness, human, animal, tree, stone, etc., transfer capable. Other's sickness, other transfer capable. This time, lama's sickness other transfer, solid transfer, other not do. Mantra samaya, sentient being harm abandon, contradictory. Nature, sickness transfer not do. Self-other's obscuration purifier born. Transferred also again arise. Moment transferred, action not transfer, action arising. From Thalgyur: "Transfer action two types: solid and empty. Entity form comprising. Thus from elements trained, wind familiarized. Entity form-possessing any, consciousness put, move capable. Then solid transfer begin. Empty mind familiarized main. Dharmadhatu and dharmakaya, non-dual practice empty know. Clear empty nature, mind also that state. Reliance-connection dharma complete, main-point transfer release method, word recite know. Each's body meet, see only transfer. Wind pair, expert. But attainment, invisible form all action accomplish. Entity attachment substance see, lama offer transfer take. Other action not. Thus vehicle form etc., lama hero command, wind familiarized this also take. Attracting mind possessing, yogin transfer."

[2911-2963]
The First Point speaks: Three words. Solid. Empty. Transfer. Solid transfer: move sickness to objects. Empty transfer: dissolve in emptiness. Both are methods. Both are empty. The transfer is not real. It is the play of recognition.

[2963-2983]
Example: master great Padma, Mangyul mountains transferred. Samye Ne'u-thang and forest transferred, until now remaining. This is yogin's wish-accomplishing supreme. From Thalgyur: "Transfer-wish yogin fortunate, awareness-possessing mind gathered, form-appearance life-possessing, inner concordant action changes, own sickness etc. other transfer. Thus transferred, entities liberated. Others reliance-connection method do. Solid four elements from, entity becoming reliance-connection, numbers and signs and words, visualization transformed, sickness etc. transferred. Wood stick stones, grass and joints, ruins etc., also water, earth, space, certainly hold, transfer action. Yogi mind's power transform."

[2963-2983]
The Vagabond speaks: This old practitioner has heard of these attainments. Masters who could move mountains. Who could transfer sickness. Who could accomplish wishes. But he has not needed such powers. Recognition is the greatest power. The rest are play.

[2984-3004]
Second: dream, two: preliminary and actual main. First, three: training—daytime prostration, circumambulation, recitation, mind gathering-spreading, completely purified, body-speech-mind three purified, dreams many flickering arise, training measure. Then from those dreams, habitual tendency thick-thin examine. Then daytime very slowly, shaking-loosening, dream grasp and examine, thinking undistracted, former attachment object etc. much dream, former attachment habitual tendency thick, difficult-easy-medium. Present much dream, very easy, three-four days train. Former not arrived field, not met person etc. dream, cut difficult. Three all scattered dream, habitual tendencies three gathered, very cut difficult. Suppression: dream grasp. This, aspiration one-pointed only, instruction main-point. Daytime dream is this, arise sudden able aspiration, certainty do. Night certain. This time, not fearing, emanating and transforming, field-direction view etc. power train, appearance suppress.

[2984-3004]
That, first lama devotion and aspiration great. Mind-confidence not separate from lama, thinking, sleep time certain. Earlier familiarized, later not familiarized, former not familiarized dreams many arise, this present habitual tendencies little. Training time, devotion one-pointed alone, instruction main-point, sleep time grasp measure.

[2984-3004]
The Omniscient speaks: Between the wind practices and dream yoga, between the yantras and transfers, between the preliminary training and actual recognition, I weave this teaching. Not to establish magical powers. To point to what these practices reveal—the nature of mind, the dream-like nature of all appearance.

[2984-3004]
The Wandering Guru speaks: Three words. Train. Recognize. Liberate. Train in the practices. Recognize the nature. Liberate all appearance. This is the path. This is the completion.

[2779-3004]
This old practitioner concludes. The wind practices have been explained. The yantras described. The dream yoga taught. What remains? Recognition. These are all preparations. The recognition is the actualization. Rest in that.

[2779-3004]
Longchenpa has given these teachings on completion stage practices. The channels. The winds. The bindus. The yantras. The dream yoga. All precise. All profound. But all point to one thing: recognition of your own nature. That is the Great Perfection.

[3004-3004]
Three words. Practices complete. Recognition dawns. Rest.

[2779-3004]
The Vagabond continues: This old fool once tried to move a mountain. He practiced the
yantras for years. He visualized. He recited. He concentrated. The mountain remained.
Then one day he recognized—the mountain was already moved. It was his mind that needed
moving. The mountain was never separate from his awareness.

[2779-3004]
The Systematizer continues: Thus. We analyze the dream yoga. The training has three
aspects: purification, examination, and suppression. Purification prepares the mind.
Examination reveals the dream's nature. Suppression is the recognition that controls
the dream. All three lead to the same: recognition that waking and dreaming are not
different.

[2779-3004]
The Integrator continues: All these practices integrate. Tummo generates heat. Yantras
move obstacles. Dream yoga recognizes the dream-like nature. Transfer accomplishes
wishes. But they are all one practice—the practice of recognizing the nature in all
appearances.

[2779-3004]
The Lotus-Born continues: From Oddiyana, I bless these practices. May all who practice
them recognize their meaning. May the channels open. May the winds flow. May the bindus
dissolve into light. May all dreams become recognition.

[2779-3004]
The Lion-Faced continues: See through all the methods! The yantras! The transfers! The
dream controls! See through them! They are empty! They are the play of awareness!
Recognition is immediate! Liberation is now!

[2779-3004]
The Essence Holder continues: Rest in the nature. The practices happen naturally. The
heat generates naturally. The dreams become clear naturally. The recognition dawns
naturally. Do not force. Do not grasp. Rest as the nature.

[2779-3004]
The Singing Yogi continues: These practices are songs. The channels are the melody. The
winds are the rhythm. The bindus are the harmony. When you sing this song, you are the
nature singing. The recognition is the song recognizing itself.

[2779-3004]
The First Point continues: Three words. Channel. Wind. Recognition. The channel is not
physical. The wind is not breath. The recognition is not achievement. Strip away
these concepts. See what is. Rest in that.

[2779-3004]
The Omniscient continues: Between the generation stage and completion stage, between
the subtle body and the clear light, between the practices and their results, I weave
this teaching. The practices are not separate from recognition. They are recognition
crystallized into method.

[2779-3004]
This old practitioner concludes these instructions. The completion stage practices
have been explained. The wind work. The yantras. The dream yoga. All pointing to
recognition. May all who receive these teachings recognize their own nature. May they
be liberated in this very life.

[2779-3004]
Longchenpa has given these completion stage instructions. Precise. Detailed. Complete.
Now practice them. Do not just read. Practice with devotion. Practice with confidence.
The result is certain. Recognition is the only result.

[3004-3004]
Three final words. Completion complete. Recognition certain. Rest.

[2779-3004]
Detailed explanation of tummo practice. The AH stroke at the navel is not merely
visualization. It is the recognition of the fire element's natural presence. The red
nada above it is not imagination. It is the bindu's natural luminosity. When these
are recognized, the fire blazes naturally. The heat arises spontaneously. This is not
ordinary heat. It is the warmth of wisdom.

[2779-3004]
The four wheels are not imaginary structures. They are energetic centers. The crown
wheel. The throat wheel. The heart wheel. The navel wheel. Each corresponds to
aspects of the nature. The crown to dharmakaya. The throat to sambhogakaya. The heart
to nirmanakaya. The navel to the essence of all three.

[2779-3004]
The bodhicitta dripping from the HAM at the crown is not physical fluid. It is the
natural downward flow of realization. When the fire below blazes, the realization
above melts. It flows down. It pervades the body. This is the union of bliss and
emptiness. This is the essence of completion stage.

[2779-3004]
The Vagabond elaborates: This old fool once thought he needed to generate heat. He
visualized intensely. He held his breath. He became overheated. His teacher said:
"You are trying to make fire with sticks. The fire is already there. Just recognize
it." When he stopped trying, the heat arose naturally. When he stopped grasping, the
bliss was complete.

[2779-3004]
The yantra practices are methods of energetic manipulation. Through specific postures,
movements, and visualizations, the practitioner influences the elements. But these are
not supernatural powers. They are the natural capacities of one who has recognized the
energetic nature of reality. The solid becomes empty. The empty becomes solid. This is
not magic. It is the play of the nature.

[2779-3004]
The dream yoga is crucial. Waking life and dream are not essentially different. Both
are the play of mind. Both are empty. Both can be recognized. The training in dream
yoga develops the capacity to maintain recognition in all states. Waking. Dreaming.
Sleeping. Dying. All are opportunities for recognition.

[2779-3004]
The preliminary training for dream yoga has three aspects. First, purification through
daytime practice. Prostrations. Circumambulations. Recitations. These purify the mind.
They prepare it for the subtle work of dream recognition. Second, examination of
dreams. Learning to recognize dream signs. Learning to question reality. Third,
suppression of ordinary perception. Replacing it with recognition.

[2779-3004]
The Systematizer elaborates: Thus. We categorize. The completion stage practices are
of two types. With signs and without signs. With signs: tummo, yantras, dream yoga,
transfers. These use visualization, energy, and method. Without signs: direct
recognition of the nature. Both lead to the same result. But the path without signs
is faster.

[2779-3004]
The transfer practices (phowa) are of two types. Transfer of consciousness at death.
Transfer of sickness during life. Both demonstrate that the mind is not bound to the
body. That awareness is free. But these are not the ultimate point. The ultimate is
to recognize that there is nothing to transfer. The nature has never moved.

[2779-3004]
This old practitioner has completed this section. The completion stage practices have
been explained in detail. The channels. The winds. The bindus. The tummo. The yantras.
The dream yoga. The transfers. All preparation. All pointing to recognition. Rest in
that recognition.

[2779-3004]
Longchenpa presents these practices with great precision. They are not for everyone.
They require preparation. They require guidance. But for those ready, they are the
swift path. The path of skillful means. The path that uses the body to transcend the
body. May all who practice them attain recognition.

[3004-3004]
Teaching complete. Practices explained. Recognition available. Rest.
