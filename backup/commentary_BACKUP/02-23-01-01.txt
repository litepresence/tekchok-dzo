[12011-12030]
The disturbances of the world fade, and the inner displays become clearer. Yet do not think 'I must have solitude!' The true solitude is the nature (rang bzhin) of mind itself.

The bardo is the intermediate state—the state between death and rebirth, between sleep and waking, between one moment and the next. The word "bardo" comes from "bar" meaning between and "do" meaning two—like a rope connecting two posts. The bardo is that connecting rope, the interval, the gap. In Tibetan, there are many bardos: the bardo of this life, the bardo of dying, the bardo of dharmata, the bardo of becoming, the bardo of dream. All are variations of the same principle: the mind in its naked state, unclothed by concepts.

[12011-12034]
If they lived well and good signs appear, this is appropriate; if they lived badly but good signs appear, it is others' signs affecting them—like finding a rainbow when seeking profit, called "meeting rainbow's meaning." Rest in this understanding.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The Blazing Relics Tantra teaches extensive establishment of bardo's manifest complete buddhahood. Two aspects: general bardo arrangement and specific natures extensively explained.

Bardo's essence: some practitioners think they must have perfect conditions—proper diet, proper place, proper time. This is attachment to method. The displays arise from your own awareness, not from external conditions. Yet do not completely abandon method either—these are skillful means.

The nature of bardo: in primordial purity from the very beginning, the ground of confusion cannot be expressed. If so, what of the unconfused? Thus it is spoken. The bardo is not a place you go—it is the nature of awareness itself. When awareness is not obscured by concepts, it is in bardo. When awareness is obscured, it appears as samsara. The recognition of naked awareness is the bardo of dharmata.

[12011-12035]
The bardo teachings are vast. The outer and inner expanse of manifestation abides in the nature of things. The end too must be delivered to that nature's own state. In the expanse of primordial purity, no intermediate state exists. That very self depends not on other dharmas, before or after. Nor can entry into any interval occur.

This point, if wisdom exists, carries great import. The bardo is not separate from the ground. The ground is not separate from awareness. Awareness, when recognized, is the path. The path, when completed, is the ground. There is no difference between confusion and enlightenment, except recognition.

[12031-12055]
The etymology: "bar" indicates the center. "Do" dwells in the center like a connecting rope joining beginning and end—like the connecting rope at the center of two. The bardo is the center, the interval, the gap. It is not a place but a state—the state between extremes. Like the dream state between sleeping and waking, the bardo is between death and rebirth, between one life and the next.

Some practitioners think they must have perfect conditions—proper diet, proper place, proper time. This is attachment to method. The displays arise from your own awareness, not from external conditions. Yet do not completely abandon method either—these are skillful means. The displays arise when conditions are right—not external conditions, but internal conditions: the state of the channels, the winds, the mind. When these align, the displays arise naturally.

[12035-12075]
The divisions: common and uncommon. Some common vehicles consider birth-death bardo, dream bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo, etc. But uncommon Secret Mantra King here distinguishes: nature-abiding bardo, death-point bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo—four.

First, nature-abiding bardo: bound by the five aggregates of form and so forth, the appearance of the five kayas self-dissolves. Bound by elements and sense-sources, the appearance of light and color self-dissolves. Bound by karma and afflictions, the appearance of pristine cognition and dharmata self-dissolves. Through grasping at outer appearance with inner apprehending mind, one wanders day and night in the depths of the difficult-to-cross rivers of the four perversions, engaging with much karma and latent tendencies.

The four perversions: holding the impermanent as permanent, holding the unreal as real, holding the cause of suffering as pleasure, holding what is empty by nature as entities and marks. These are the root of confusion. The antidotes taught by the Buddha are the Four Dharmas for guiding ordinary individual beings.

Second, death-time bardo: through the disturbance of the body's elements, one experiences the suffering of the outer body. Through the loss of the mental factor's feeling-path, one experiences the suffering of the inner mind. Through the collapse of the ocean of grasping's latent tendencies, one experiences the suffering of separating from this life's appearances though attached. Through remembering non-virtuous karma of harming others, one experiences the suffering of fear of falling into bad migrations. Through the body of cherished grasping being dissolved, one experiences the suffering of fear that the citadel of the aggregate support has collapsed. Thus remaining in the suffering of fearing death through separating the inanimate from consciousness by meaning.

Third, dharmata bardo: abandoning the support of aggregate self-grasping, the dharmata of body and wisdom appears manifest. The connection of karma and latent tendencies cut, one enjoys the dharmata of nature-meditation. The object of faculty and grasping-doer empty, one exercises in the dharmata of self-appearance clear-light.

Fourth, existence bardo: the outer body's existence as mind-body with all faculties complete goes unobstructed. The inner mind's existence thinking in many think-doers, mind enters. The gathered existence of body and mind goes unobstructed in all except the two supports—mind loose. The two supports: the vajra seat accomplished from blessing, and the mother's womb. The vajra seat is that in which all buddhas abide in the door of liberation from suffering in the supreme place of buddhahood in the inner space of primordially-pure unchangeable. The mother's womb is asserted as the impure door of samsara in any of the six realms' birth-places.

The appearances: for three realms generally, afflictions manifest as grasping-fixation. For six realms specifically: gods see nectar in water, humans see water, pretas see pus—one substance, different minds. From Two Truths: "Mind differs, therefore single entity appears as unrealized." One person seen as enemy and friend by different people; happiness-suffering, confusion-non-confusion, attachment-aversion, good-bad, dharma-undharma all appear variously. Future karma's good-bad operates through diverse cause-effect.

Whatever appears to anyone is like good-bad various dreams—though appearing, unestablished, they appear in empty clarity. This is the treasury's heart.

[12081-12105]
The duration of practice should be moderate. Too short, and you make no progress. Too long, and you exhaust yourself. Many short sessions are better than a few long ones. Find your own measure.

When practicing, do not force the gaze. Let the eyes rest naturally in space. The bindus will appear on their own. If you strain, you will develop headaches and eye problems. Be gentle, be natural.

Above all, maintain the recognition of your own nature. This is the life-force of the practice. Without this, you are merely staring into space. With this, every display becomes the path to awakening.

The buddhas of the past practiced thus and awakened. The siddhas of India and Tibet practiced thus and attained rainbow bodies. You too can achieve this if you practice with diligence and devotion.

You who have entered this path of thod rgal, you are most fortunate. In these degenerate times, such teachings are rare. Do not waste this opportunity!

[12181-12200]
The key points are few: recognize your own nature, rest in that recognition, and let the displays arise and liberate naturally. Do not complicate things with too many concepts. The nature of mind is simple—keep it simple.

The nature-abiding bardo's appearance: five aggregates' bondage obscures five kayas' appearance; elements and sense-bases obscure light and color; karma and afflictions obscure wisdom and dharmata.

When you see the lights and forms, remember—they are your own face. When you see the pure lands, remember—they are your own mind's display. When you see the buddhas, remember—they are your own wisdom manifesting. There is no other buddha than your own awareness.

[12201-12220]
The death-time bardo: body's elements disturbed, experiencing outer body's suffering; mental events' path lost, experiencing inner mind's suffering; habitual grasping's dam burst, experiencing this life's appearance's separation though attached; remembering non-virtuous deeds, fearing fall into lower realms. Grasping-fixation's attachment remembers cherished supported body, fearing the collapse of the aggregates' fortress.

Recognition is immediate.  The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Now I will explain further the practice in daily life. The bardo is not only the state after death—it is every moment when awareness is not clothed by concepts. When you fall asleep, you enter the dream bardo. When you wake, you emerge. When you die, you enter the death bardo. When you are reborn, you emerge. The wise practitioner learns to recognize the bardo in this life, so that at the time of death, they are not afraid.

The signs appear in this life as well. When you sit in meditation, you may see lights, forms, colors. These are the same displays that appear at death. The trained practitioner recognizes them as the display of awareness. The untrained person either clings to them as achievements or fears them as hallucinations. Both are mistakes. The lights and forms are neither achievements nor hallucinations—they are appearances in awareness, empty of inherent existence.

The practice is simple: recognize your own nature. Rest in that recognition. Let the displays arise and dissolve without grasping or rejecting. Do not try to create displays, do not try to stop them. Let them be as they are. This is the key to thod rgal.

Some say thod rgal is only for those with high faculties. This is not entirely true. The nature of mind is present in all beings. The displays arise when the conditions are ripe. The conditions are not external—they are internal: the state of the channels, the winds, the mind. When these align, the displays arise naturally. This can happen for anyone, regardless of external circumstances.

The practice should be moderate. Too short, and you make no progress. Too long, and you exhaust yourself. Many short sessions are better than a few long ones. Find your own measure. Some practitioners do one hour morning and evening. Others do several shorter sessions throughout the day. The key is consistency. Regular practice, even if brief, is better than occasional long sessions.

When practicing, do not force the gaze. Let the eyes rest naturally in space. The bindus will appear on their own. If you strain, you will develop headaches and eye problems. Be gentle, be natural. The practice is called "the path of direct crossing"—you cross directly from confusion to enlightenment without stages. But this direct crossing requires preparation: the groundwork of meditation, the empowerment of the lama, the introduction to your own nature.

The displays arise in stages. First, you may see lights—points, lines, colors. Then, you may see forms—deities, mandalas, landscapes. Then, you may experience sensations—heat, bliss, consciousness. All of these are the display of awareness. Do not cling to them, do not fear them. They arise from awareness and dissolve back into awareness. The practitioner rests in the recognition that these appearances are not different from awareness itself.

The nature of bardo is this: the gap between thoughts, the space between breaths, the interval between one moment and the next. This gap is not empty—it is full of awareness. When you rest in this gap, you rest in the bardo. When you recognize this gap as your own nature, you are liberated. This is not a future liberation—it is immediate. The bardo is now. The recognition is now. The liberation is now.

Thus, practice in this life. Recognize the nature of mind. Rest in that recognition. Let the displays arise and dissolve. This is the path of thod rgal, the direct crossing to enlightenment. The buddhas of the past practiced thus and awakened. The siddhas of India and Tibet practiced thus and attained rainbow bodies. You too can achieve this if you practice with diligence and devotion. You who have entered this path are most fortunate. In these degenerate times, such teachings are rare. Do not waste this opportunity!

Now I will speak further on the signs at the time of death. The signs appear according to karma. If one has lived well and good signs appear, this is appropriate. If one has lived badly but good signs appear, it may be others' signs affecting them—like finding a rainbow when seeking profit, called "meeting rainbow's meaning." The signs are not absolute predictions—they are indicators, to be read wisely.

The external phenomena appearing to internal mind's moment: all appearances from inner dharmadhatu are the bardo's state. The display of ka-dag as kayas and wisdoms is the pure dharmata bardo. The confused appearances of the six realms are the impure confusion bardo. Where do pure and impure exist? Between ka-dag's space and emergence, returning to ka-dag must occur, so between ka-dag's nature.

The signs: black sky, rain, steam, wind, hail, dust indicate hell-realm birth. Yellow fading light, dead sun and moon indicate hungry ghost. Dark hazy sky indicates animals. Fierce wind and terrifying clouds indicate asuras. Clear sky with bright luminaries indicates gods. Clear sky with gentle clouds indicates humans.

These signs arrive two or three days before birth in that realm. Without signs, where one takes rebirth is known through their own karma—death-time visions of hell-fire, hunger-thirst fears, confused awareness, or visions of previous human realms, mountains, oceans, god-palaces, gardens, or dawn-like appearances.

The bardo of dharmata is the most subtle. It arises when the winds withdraw from the body. The mind, no longer supported by the breath, experiences its true nature. The displays of light and form arise—not as external phenomena, but as the mind's own radiance. The practitioner who has trained in this life recognizes these displays as their own awareness. They are not afraid. They remain in the recognition of their own nature. This is the moment of liberation.

The bardo of existence is the final bardo before rebirth. The consciousness, drawn by karma, seeks a new embodiment. The appearances become more solid, more concrete. The mind creates a body for itself—a subtle body, visible only to itself. This body can travel through space, pass through walls, see the world of spirits. But it is still not the physical body. It is the bardo body, the dream body, the body of intention.

The bardo teachings are meant to prepare us for this moment. We practice in this life so that at the time of death, we will not be afraid. We learn to recognize the displays of awareness. We learn to rest in the nature of mind. We learn that death is not an end but a transition—a bardo, an interval, a gap. And in that gap, we have the opportunity to recognize our true nature and achieve liberation.

This is the heart of the bardo teachings: recognition. Not suppression of appearances, not clinging to experiences, but recognition. The appearances are not enemies to be defeated or friends to be cultivated. They are appearances—empty of inherent existence, arising from awareness, dissolving back into awareness. The practitioner rests in the middle: neither grasping nor rejecting. This is the supreme conduct.

The path is simple but not easy. It requires practice, patience, perseverance. It requires a qualified teacher who can introduce you to your own nature. It requires devotion to the practice. It requires the willingness to let go of all concepts, all beliefs, all expectations. It requires the courage to rest in naked awareness, with nothing to hold onto.

This old wanderer has walked this path. I have sat in caves, in forests, in mountains. I have seen the displays arise. I have felt the fear that arises when the familiar body begins to fail. I have also felt the recognition that liberates. What I tell you is from my own experience: the path works. The recognition is possible. Liberation is not a fantasy—it is the nature of mind, always present, waiting to be recognized.

Therefore, practice now. Do not wait for death. Recognize your nature in this life, and at the time of death, you will be ready. The displays will arise—they are the same displays you have seen in meditation. The recognition will come—it is the same recognition you have practiced. You will pass through the bardos like passing through rooms in your own house. You will not be afraid. This is the promise of the Dzogchen teachings. This is the gift of thod rgal. This is what the masters have taught, generation after generation, from India to Tibet, from teacher to student. May you practice with diligence. May you achieve the rainbow body. May all beings recognize their own nature and be liberated.

Now I will explain in more detail the nature of the bardos. The first bardo is the nature-abiding bardo. This is the state of ordinary awareness in this very life—the mind as it is, before any practice, before any recognition. We abide in this bardo constantly, but we do not recognize it. We take the appearances of mind to be external realities. We grasp at forms, sounds, sensations as if they were solid things. We create karma, we wander in samsara, we suffer.

The nature-abiding bardo is characterized by the five aggregates. These aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness—bind us to the appearance of a self. We think we are a person, a being, an entity. We identify with our body, our thoughts, our feelings. We cling to what we like and push away what we don't like. This is the bondage of the aggregates.

The aggregates arise from the elements. The elements—earth, water, fire, wind, space—create the world of appearance. We experience these elements through the senses: eyes see forms, ears hear sounds, nose smells odors, tongue tastes flavors, body feels touch. The mind knows all these appearances. But we do not see them as appearances—we see them as realities. This is the bondage of the elements.

The elements arise from karma and afflictions. Our actions create imprints on the mind. These imprints, when conditions arise, produce appearances. The appearances reinforce the imprints. This is the cycle of samsara: karma creates affliction, affliction creates karma, around and around we go. This is the bondage of karma and afflictions.

The four perversions are the root of this confusion: holding the impermanent as permanent, holding the unreal as real, holding the cause of suffering as pleasure, holding what is empty by nature as entities and marks. These perversions are like clouds obscuring the sun. They are not permanent—they can be removed. The Buddha taught the Four Dharmas as antidotes: turning the mind toward dharma, engaging with dharma, accomplishing dharma, and realizing dharma.

The second bardo is the death-time bardo. When the body fails, the winds withdraw. The breath stops. The heart ceases to beat. The mind, no longer supported by the body, experiences its true nature. This is the moment of death—but also the moment of greatest opportunity. The displays of dharmata arise: lights, forms, the clear light of awareness. The trained practitioner recognizes these displays and achieves liberation. The untrained person is carried away by them into the next rebirth.

The death-time bardo is characterized by the dissolution of the elements. The earth element dissolves into water: the body becomes heavy, hard to move. The water element dissolves into fire: the body loses its warmth. The fire element dissolves into wind: the breath becomes thin, irregular. The wind element dissolves into space: all movement ceases. This is the process of dying, experienced by every being.

At each stage, specific experiences arise. First, the outer experiences: the body feels painful, as if being crushed. Then, the inner experiences: the mind feels confused, lost, afraid. Then, the secret experiences: the subtle winds gather at the heart, the clear light arises. This is the moment of death—and the moment of liberation, if recognized.

The third bardo is the dharmata bardo. This is the bardo of reality itself—the state of awareness when all conceptual fabrications have ceased. The mind rests in its own nature, naked, transparent, luminous. The displays of dharmata arise: the five lights, the five wisdoms, the five kayas. These are not external phenomena—they are the very nature of awareness, manifesting spontaneously.

The dharmata bardo is characterized by the absence of grasping. The aggregates have dissolved. The elements have ceased. The karma and afflictions have been cut. The mind rests in its own nature, free from concepts, free from effort, free from doer. This is the state of enlightenment—not a state achieved, but the state that has always been, now recognized.

The fourth bardo is the existence bardo, also called the bardo of becoming. This is the state between death and rebirth. The consciousness, having left the old body, seeks a new embodiment. It creates a subtle body—the bardo body—and wanders in search of a suitable rebirth. This body can pass through walls, travel at will, see the worlds of spirits. But it is still not the physical body.

The existence bardo is characterized by the arising of the six appearances: the appearances of the six realms. The mind, propelled by karma, sees the hell realms, the hungry ghost realms, the animal realms, the asura realms, the god realms, the human realms. These appearances are not external—they are the mind's own projection, created by habit. The mind creates the realm, then enters it.

In the existence bardo, the mind has two opportunities for rebirth: the vajra seat and the mother's womb. The vajra seat is the path of liberation—the opportunity to recognize the nature of mind and achieve enlightenment in the bardo. The mother's womb is the path of rebirth—the opportunity to take a new body in one of the six realms. The choice depends on the practitioner's recognition.

The practice in this life is preparation for the bardos. We practice so that at the time of death, we will recognize the displays. We practice so that we will not be afraid. We practice so that we will have the opportunity to achieve liberation. The practice is simple: recognize your own nature. Rest in that recognition. Let the displays arise and dissolve naturally. This is the path that leads from the bardos to enlightenment.
