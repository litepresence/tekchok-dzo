## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Showing the boundless varieties of vehicles, as many as exist,
Divided into nine vehicles by the mind-investigated path of cause and effect,
Exhausting what is to be discarded and adopted in the manifest luminous expanse—
These excellent teachings are like both existence and peace.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza broadens the teaching to address both vehicles and the expansion of realization. The boundless varieties arise not as an inventory but as a single field where classifications dissolve in the non-dual ground. The nine vehicles are not a taxonomy but a unified vehicle seen through multiplicity, and the mind-investigated path reveals that cause and effect are not sequential but interdependent expressions of the same reality.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Boundless vehicles—not infinite, not unlimited, but the boundless that is the vehicle.
00002| Showing varieties—not display, not types, but the showing that is the variety.
00003| Nine vehicles—not taxonomy, not hierarchy, but the nine that is the vehicle.
00004| Mind-investigated path—not analysis, not road, but the mind that is the path.
00005| Cause and effect—not sequence, not relation, but the cause that is the effect, the effect that is the cause.
00006| Manifest luminous expanse—not visible, not illuminated, but the manifest that is the expanse.
00007| Discarding and adopting—not rejection, not acceptance, but discard that adopts, or adopt that discards.
00008| Exhausting—not depletion, not running out, but the exhaust that is the complete.
00009| Both existence and peace—not two, not duality, but the both that is the neither.
00010| Excellent teachings—not comparison, not similarity, but the teaching that is the excellent.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

As-many vehicle's varieties boundless show
Mind-investigate cause-effect path from vehicle nine divide
Manifest luminous expanse-in discard-adopt exhaust
Teaching excellent these existence peace both like
