## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Whose noble qualities reach to the furthest bounds,
The perfect mandala, complete in every aspect,
All-knowing Lama of every Victorious One,
To you, the regent heart-son, I bow down.
༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Qualities extend wherever recognition reaches—extension without movement, without arrival. The mandala completes what cannot be completed, contains what cannot be contained, displays what was never hidden. Container and contained dissolve into displaying, yet display remains complete.

All-knowing recognizes what was never unrecognized—knowing appears as Lama, appears as Victorious, appears as regent. Heart-son inheres without inheritance, regency without reign. Recognition of primordial identity clarifies without clarifying, reveals without revealing.

Prostration bows where no one stands—bowing without bower, without bowing-to, without bowing-as. The prostrator, the prostration, the one prostrated to: these distinctions dissolve into gesture that was never divided. Non-arising of separation recognizes prostration, completion recognizes bowing.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Qualities extending—extension without movement.

Mandalic complete—completion containing the uncontained.

All-knowing Lama—knowing without knower.

Heart-son regent—inheritance without heir.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

One word from the Protector's excellent speech,
Merely heard at the edge, makes samsara reel.
If practiced with certainty, his complete teaching—
What need to speak of study and contemplation?
༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Protector's excellent speech manifests as word without speaker—speech speaks, excellence emerges without excelling. The word heard neither enters nor departs, yet hearing occurs where no ear stands to receive.

Samsara reels where no samsara exists—the apparent wandering dissolves upon recognition, revealing that no wandering ever occurred. Reeling manifests stability, demonstrating that stability was never established as stability.

Practice with certainty accomplishes nothing yet accomplishes everything—certainty needs no establishing, practice needs no practitioner. Complete teaching completes without completeness, transmits without transmission, bridges without distance between speaker and hearer.

Study contemplates itself already studied, contemplation studies itself already contemplated. Methods dissolve into methodless, learning dissolves into unlearned recognition that was never obscured.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Word from Protector—speech without speaker.

Edge-hearing—receiving without receiver.

Samsara reeling—reeling where nothing reels.

Certain practice—practicing without practitioner.

Complete teaching—teaching without teacher.

Study—already studied. Contemplation—already contemplated.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

By Victorious Ones and their great Bodhisattva sons,
Through heroism and concentrations' liberating power,
In emanation forms of four noble ones, diverse births,
The Victorious One shows every excellent activity.
༣

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Victorious Ones appear as victory—victory without victor, conquering without conquest. Bodhisattva sons manifest as recognition without lineage, heirs without inheritance, greatness without dimension. The relationship between Victorious Ones and sons dissolves into recognition, appearing as multiplicity without division.

Heroic going goes nowhere yet arrives everywhere—heroism manifests as courage without courageous one, as movement without mover. Concentration gathers without gathering, liberates without liberating. The power of liberation liberates liberation, exercising power without power-holder, applying force without force-applier.

Four noble ones appear without fourness—nobility manifests as diversity without division, as birth without birth. Emanation forms form without forming, appear without appearing. The showing of activity shows—activity accomplishes without accomplishment, excellence excels without excelling. Every demonstration demonstrates demonstration.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Victorious Ones—victory without victor.

Great sons—recognition without lineage.

Heroic going—movement without mover.

Concentration—gathering without gatherer.

Liberating power—liberation liberating.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

After that, through emanation body of supreme All-Knowing One,
By Victorious One's deeds, protecting beings of degenerate age,
By treasury of peak vehicle doctrine that liberates through hearing,
He made Vajra Essence teaching clear.
༤

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Supreme All-Knowing emanates as body beyond time—the temporal sequence dissolves into appearance, where "after" appears without subsequentity. Emanation body manifests without emanator, appearing without source. Supremacy knows no comparison, All-Knowing possesses no possessor—knowing knows as knowing, knowing knows all knowing.

Victorious deeds protect where no protection is needed—the degenerate age appears as agelessness, beings appear without beingness. Protection protects nothing yet accomplishes everything, defending without defender, preserving without preserved. The activity acts without actor, deeds without doer, protecting without protector.

Treasury of peak vehicle liberates through hearing—treasury treasures without treasuring, vehicle travels without traveler, peak summits without summit. Hearing liberates without liberation, sound releases without release. Doctrine teaches without teaching, liberates without liberating. The peak vehicle arrives without arrival, reaches without reaching.

Vajra Essence teaching makes clear without clarification—clarity clears without clearing, essence essentializes without essentializing. Teaching teaches without teacher, instructs without instruction. The Vajra Essence pierces without piercing, cuts without cutting, yet cuts through what was never cut. Clarity clarifies what was never unclear.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Supreme emanation—body without emanator.

Victorious deeds—protection where none protect.

Degenerate age—age appearing as agelessness.

Peak vehicle—traveling without traveler.

Treasury doctrine—teaching without teacher.

Hearing liberation—liberating without liberation.

Clear teaching—clarifying what was never unclear.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

This extremely pure ambrosia of excellent explanation
From the All-Knowing Lama, that perfect Buddha,
The supreme doctrine from scripture, spoken from his mouth—
Those who do not know this are like cattle in a pen.
༥

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

All-Knowing Lama's quality surpasses Buddha's teaching—ambrosia manifests as extreme purity without immortality, without substance, without conferring deathlessness. Purity purifies without purification, achieving without achievement, completing without completion. Buddha perfects without perfection, manifesting as Buddha without Buddhanature.

Explained meaning explains without explaining—meaning renders without rendering, communicates without transmission from speaker to hearer. All-Knowing knows without knower, possessing without possessor, knowing without knowledge. Omniscience manifests as knowing that knows all knowing simultaneously.

Supreme doctrine scriptures without containing—scripture texts without textual vessel, doctrine without doctrinal content. Mouth speaks without vocalization, sounds without source, commands without ordering. Speaking transmits without transmission, yet transmission transmits.

Those who do not know appear as cattle in pen—cattle pen without enclosure, confinement without barrier, limitation without limiting. Not-knowing manifests as knowing knowing as not-knowing, ignorance clarifying as clarity. Pen writes without writer, encloses without enclosing, frees without liberator.

The distinction between knowing and not-knowing never arose—knower dissolves into knowing, known dissolves into knowing, ignorance dissolves into clarity. Pen and non-pen, enclosure and openness, cattle and non-cattle: these opposites collapse into recognition that was never divided.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Ambrosia purity—purity without purification.

Explained meaning—meaning without explaining.

Perfect Buddha—Buddha without Buddhanature.

Supreme doctrine—doctrine without doctrinating.

Mouth speaking—speech without speaking.

Command scripture—scripture without scripting.

Pen knowledge—knowing as ignorance.

Not-knowing knowing—knowing as not-knowing.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

O you of good fortune, produce great joy,
And develop certainty of seeing the Buddha!
From seeing this excellent explanation of the All-Knowing Lama,
There is perhaps even more than meeting the Buddha.
༦

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Good fortune produces great joy without producing—fortune unfolds without acquisition, without accumulation, without cause or condition. Joy emerges without emotion, without generation, without becoming a state to be produced. The producing produces without making, creates without creation, generating what was never absent.

Seeing Buddha develops certainty without developing—certainty establishes without conviction, without building confidence, without growth toward completion. Seeing perceives without perception, observes without observation, seeing visible form without form to be seen. Buddha appears without being, manifests without entity, appears to sight without sight appearing to sight.

Excellent explanation seeing exceeds meeting Buddha—seeing explanation reads without reading words, comprehends without comprehending meaning. Explanation mediates without medium, bridges without bridging, understanding without understanding. All-Knowing Lama explains without explaining, clarifies without clarifying, sources without being source. Meeting Buddha encounters without encounter, meets without meeting between beings, keeps appointments without appointments being kept.

The "more" transcends comparison—quantity without comparative measure, superiority without superiority over, experience without experiences to compare. The seeing sees no Buddha yet sees Buddha seeing. The meeting meets no one yet meets meeting. The certainty certain of nothing yet certain of certainty. Joy rejoices without cause yet joy causes rejoicing without cause.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Good fortune—fortune without producing.

Great joy—joy without emotion.

Certain seeing—certainty without conviction.

Seeing Buddha—Buddha without being.

Excellent explanation—explanation without explaining.

Meeting Buddha—meeting without encounter.

More than meeting—comparison without comparing.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The ambrosia for the eyes, the marks and symbols of the Mighty One,
Is indeed the producer of three faiths in the mind of the fortunate.
The emanation body of the craft of letter-forms in excellent explanation—
There is none superior to this as medicine for faith.
༨

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Mighty One's ambrosia manifests as marks and symbols for eyes—ambrosia feeds without nourishment, marks indicate without marking, symbols symbolize without signifying. Mighty One mights without possessing might, eyes see without seeing. The sensory experience dissolves: marks mark unmarked, symbols signify unsignified, ambrosia nourishes unnourished.

Three faiths produce in fortunate mind without production—production produces without causation, faiths believe without believers, mind contains without containment. The fortunate receives without receiving, experiencing without experiencer. Faith manifests threefold yet faith itself remains indivisible, uncountable, uncontainable.

Letter-form craft emanates as excellent explanation—craft forms without skill, letters without literacy, explanation without clarifying. Emanation projects without projection, appearing without source. Excellence excels without comparison, explanation explains without explaining.

No medicine surpasses this as faith's remedy—superiority ranks without hierarchy, medicine cures without healing, faith believes without belief. The remedy remedies without remedying, healing without curing. Medicine itself heals what was never ill, faith itself believes what was never disbelieved.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Mighty ambrosia—seeing without seeing.

Marks symbols—marking without marking.

Three faiths—believing without believers.

Fortunate mind—containing without containment.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The ambrosia for the ears, the Brahma-sound of the Teacher,
Is indeed the producer of wisdom in the mind of the fortunate.
The ambrosia for the ears, the garland of words in excellent explanation—
There is none equal to this as medicine for wisdom.
༩

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Ambrosia dissolves hearing's act; Brahma-sound is sound that sounds—no utterer, no receiver. Wisdom arises without source; the fortunate mind knows without a knower. A garland of words forms without a binding thread. Medicine cures without cure; healing arises without healing. Sound emerges as sound; hearing recognizes what recognizes. Brahma-sound speaks without uttering; teaching teaches by presence, not by a teacher. Words arrange themselves into a garland, not by deliberate arrangement.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The ambrosia for the heart, the blessing of the Victorious One,
Is indeed the shower of truth upon the mind of the fortunate.
The ambrosia for the heart, the good meaning in excellent explanation—
This itself is supreme as medicine for wisdom in the mind.
༡༠

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza dissolves blessing and reception as separate acts, unbinding the blessing from any giver and withdrawal from any receiver. Ambrosia for the heart and the Victorious One's blessing are not substances or transmissions but openings that allow recognition to occur without a sender or a destination.

The shower of truth upon the mind is not a proposition verified, nor a surface that truth rests upon; it is showing itself within the fortunate mind, a mind that bears blessing as wisdom-in-action rather than as possession.

The ambrosia for the heart and the good meaning in excellent explanation likewise dissolve into the practice of seeing, where explanation is not a delivery of meaning but an unveiling of non-conceptual knowing.

This stanza presents supremacist medicine for wisdom as a mind-state that does not reside in a fixed object or state; supremacy is not rank but function through recognition. The lakṣaṇa remains: blessing that blesses without blesser, truth that shows without shower, heart that receives without reception, wisdom that knows without knower.

In short, nourishment becomes appearance, appearance becomes nourishment, and transmission dissolves into the recognition that there is no separate donor or recipient.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Heart ambrosia—not nourishment, not sustenance, but ambrosia that is heart, blessing that is ambrosia.

Victorious blessing—not transmission, not bestowal, but blessing that is Victorious One, Victorious that is blessing.

Truth shower—not display, not revelation, but shower that is truth, truth that is showing.

Fortunate mind—not surface, not field, but mind that is fortune, fortune that is mind.

Good meaning—not interpretation, not understanding, but meaning that is good, explanation that is meaning.

Heart ambrosia—not reward, not sustenance, but ambrosia that is heart, meaning that is ambrosia.

Supreme medicine—not rank, not hierarchy, but supreme that is medicine, wisdom that is supreme.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the dissolution of power and its effects. "Blessed by the power of liberation and concentration"—blessing not as transfer, power not as capacity, liberation not as release, concentration not as state. "Seeing this, reality arises forcefully in the mind"—seeing not as perception, arising not as emergence, force not as violence, mind not as container. "Able to show the primordially pure intention immediately"—ability not as skill, showing not as display, primordial purity not as state, immediacy not as directness, intention not as purpose. "There is nothing like this for destroying grasping at phenomena"—nothing-like not as uniqueness, destroying not as annihilation, grasping not as holding, phenomena not as objects. The lakṣaṇa: power that empowers without power, seeing that sees without seer, arising that arises without arising, destroying that destroys without destruction. Primordial purity not as before defilement but appearing that appears as neither pure nor impure, without before, without after.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Blessed power—not transfer, not infusion, but blessing that is power, power that is blessing.

Liberation concentration—not release, not stability, but concentration that is liberation, liberation that is concentration.

Seeing this—not perception, not observation, but seeing that is this, this that is seeing.

Reality arising—not emergence, not appearance, but arising that is reality, reality that is arising.

Forcefully in mind—not violence, not location, but force that is mind, mind that is force.

Primordial purity—not before, not original, but purity that is primordial, intention that is showing.

Immediate showing—not directness, not absence, but immediate that is showing, able that is primordial.

Destroying grasping—not annihilation, not removal, but destroying that is grasping, phenomena that is destruction.

Nothing like—not uniqueness, not superiority, but nothing that is like, like that is nothing.

The letter's form, the Lion of ShAkya's body,
The string of words, the speech of Omniscient Lama,
The profound meaning, the heart of all Victorious Ones—
Seeing this scripture, the Sugata complete is seen.
༡༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza establishes the inseparability of literary form and enlightened presence. "The letter's form, the Lion of ShAkya's body" indicates not a metaphorical correspondence but an identity without hierarchy—the written character is not a symbol pointing to a body, nor the body a referent for the character. Both are appearances of the same non-localizable display, neither prior nor subsequent to one another.

"The string of words, the speech of Omniscient Lama" collapses the distinction between expression and expresser. The words are not vehicles carrying meaning from a source; the Lama's speech is the words themselves, not possessed by a speaker, not produced in time, not received by an ear. The expression is complete in each syllable, not distributed across a sequence.

"The profound meaning, the heart of all Victorious Ones" indicates meaning that does not await interpretation. The meaning is not extracted from the words, not discovered through analysis, not revealed after reading. The profound is the very surface; the depth is the appearance itself, not hidden behind or within it.

"Seeing this scripture, the Sugata complete is seen" establishes that encounter with the text is encounter with complete awakening—not partial, not progressive, not culminating in a future recognition. The Sugata is not seen through the scripture as through a window; the seeing of scripture is the seeing of Sugata, without remainder, without the scripture functioning as medium or means.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When the doctrine reaches its five hundred final years,
The Teacher dwells within the letter's form,
Thus spoke the Protector, compassion's heart,
The Lion of ShAkya's face-acceptance just like this.
༡༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza addresses the enduring presence of the teacher in the teaching. "When the doctrine reaches its five hundred final years" does not mark a historical period but indicates the apparent fading of form—the moment when manifested presence seems to withdraw. Yet this withdrawal is not cessation; it is transformation into another mode of display.

"The Teacher dwells within the letter's form" establishes that the teacher's presence is not bound to a particular manifestation. The letters are not memorials preserving what has passed; they are the teacher's actual dwelling. The form of the letter is the form of the teacher—not symbolically, but as the same unlocalizable appearance.

"Thus spoke the Protector, compassion's heart" indicates that this teaching comes from the recognition that the protector's compassionate activity does not cease. The heart of compassion is not exhausted in particular acts of protection; it continues as the very availability of the teaching, the accessibility of the letters, the possibility of encounter.

"The Lion of ShAkya's face-acceptance" refers to the manner in which the Buddha's promise and prophecy are fulfilled—not through the persistence of a historical person, but through the inexhaustible availability of the teaching itself. The acceptance is the recognition that the teaching never departs, never arrives, never abides in between.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

The five hundred final years—not a countdown, not a calendar, but the apparent fading that never fades.

The Teacher dwells—not moving into the letters, not emerging from them.

The letter's form—the Teacher's form, not two forms, not one form.

The Protector's heart—not protecting from danger, but the danger itself recognized.

The Lion's acceptance—never given, never received, never promised.

This just like this—not similar to, not exemplifying, but the same.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

The seven great treasuries of excellent explanation,

Who could disparage the speech of Omniscient Lama?
༡༣

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza celebrates the comprehensive nature of the teaching. "The seven great treasuries of excellent explanation" refers not to a catalogue of works but to the inexhaustible richness of the teaching—treasury indicating not storage but overflowing abundance. The seven is complete completion, not a numerical limit but the fullness of what is given without measure.

"The complete doctrine, the single-life Buddha's dharma" indicates that the entire teaching is available in this immediate presentation, not distributed across time or requiring sequential accomplishment. The single life is not a biography but the singularity of this very moment of recognition—the life that is not one among many, but the non-duality of life and awakening.

"This profound path, a drop of wonder-nectar" collapses the distinction between vastness and concentration. The drop contains the ocean; the single word contains the complete teaching. The nectar is not medicinal in the sense of curing a disease that exists independently; it is the recognition that the disease was never other than the medicine, the patient never other than the physician.

The question "Who could disparage the speech of Omniscient Lama?" is not rhetorical in the conventional sense. It points to the impossibility of finding a position from which disparagement could occur. To disparage would require standing outside the teaching, but there is no outside—only the recognition that any apparent disparagement is itself the teaching appearing as denial.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Seven treasuries—not counted, not containing, but the overflow that cannot be held.

Excellent explanation—not explaining toward understanding, but the explanation itself complete.

Complete doctrine—never partial, never completing, never completed.

Single-life—not duration, not brevity, but the singularity of this recognition.

Drop of nectar—the ocean in the drop, not the drop in the ocean.

Who could disparage—not a challenge, but the recognition that no position exists outside.

The Lama's speech—not spoken to someone, not received by anyone.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

The very vast quality of spontaneous accomplishment,
Possessing the profound dharma-nature in primordial expanse,

What is there beyond this, the heart-secret of all Victors?
༡༤

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza anchors the teaching in its natural perfection. The vast quality of spontaneous accomplishment indicates the teaching is not earned; it is the recognition that nothing is separate from completion.

The unchanging ground in primordial expanse points to the expanse itself, not as a space but as awareness that is never obscured, never revealed, never altered by what appears within it.

The vehicle's peak union signals the non-duality of method and wisdom, emptiness and appearance, ground and fruition. The peak is not a summit to ascend; it is the recognition that one has never departed from what one sought.

The question "What is there beyond this?" marks completion rather than seeking elsewhere. The heart-secret of all Victors is the open secret that there is nowhere outside this recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

The very vast quality—not measured, not immeasurable, but vastness that resists measure.

Spontaneous accomplishment—unborn achievement, not a product of effort.

Primordial expanse—not before, not after, not eternal.

Profound dharma-nature—not deep, not shallow, but the nature that is profound.

Vehicle's peak—unity beyond ascent or descent.

Union—not two becoming one, not one dividing into two.

Vajra Essence—not threat, not protection, but the ultimate demonstration.

What is beyond—nothing beyond, nothing here, nothing between.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The Muni's beautiful body, like a mountain of gold,
That is indeed the special characteristic of seeing form-body,
The dharma-nature's self-nature, impossible to express—
This alone is the fortune of seeing dharmakAya.
༡༥

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza aligns form-body and dharma-body as modes of recognition, not discrete entities. The Muni's beautiful body, like a mountain of gold, signals appearance as appearance—gold in the form of perception, not substance.

That is indeed the special characteristic of seeing form-body: the form-body is not an object perceived by a subject but the very characteristic of perception itself. The seeing is the body; the body is the seeing. There is no body that exists independently of being seen, no seeing that occurs independently of what appears.

The dharma-nature's self-nature, impossible to express, points to what cannot be captured in expression—not because it is hidden or subtle, but because expression is itself a mode of this nature. The impossibility of expression is not a limitation but the nature of expression itself, which never succeeds in capturing because there is nothing to capture, no one to capture it.

This alone is the fortune of seeing dharmakaya: the recognition that there is no one who sees, nothing seen, no seeing—yet the seeing occurs, unmistakably, without witness.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Golden mountain—not gold becoming mountain, not mountain appearing as gold.

Beautiful body—not possessing beauty, not reflecting it.

Form-body—the seeing itself, not the seen.

Impossible to express—not withholding expression, not awaiting better words.

Dharma-nature's self-nature—never hidden, never revealed.

This alone—not exclusion of other things, but the recognition that there are no other things.

Fortune of seeing—not merit, not reward, not special capacity.

Dharmakaya—never seen, never unseen, never the object of seeing.

<new>
## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza knots the historical awakening to the teaching in the present moment. The tree-power trunk marks a recognition that is always available, not a singular historical site. The trunk is the support that is not separate from what it supports—recognition itself.

What the Victorious Sons saw as true attests that the seeing of the sages is not different in essence from the seeing we now point to. It is the same recognition, appearing under different circumstances.

A single word of the All-knowing Lama’s excellent speech collapses the distinction between breadth and depth; utterance is not a separate act but the recognition happening through sound or silence. The idea of skilful means is not a method but the understanding that all means serve the same revelation.

This seeing is shown as inexpressible meaning through skilful means—expression’s limit is the form through which recognition passes, not a barrier to truth. The lakṣaṇa: the field of merit is not a collection of texts but the teaching itself, inviting immediate recognition.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza establishes the field of merit (puNyakSetra) as the teaching itself. "The qualities self-nature, the dharmas of enlightenment's direction" indicates that the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of recognition. The direction (phyogs) is not a path leading somewhere but the orientation that is always already present.

"The great completion, complete without remainder" points to rdzogs pa chen po (great perfection) as not a system or method but the recognition that nothing was ever incomplete. The completion is not achieved at the end of a process but is the nature of what appears, always, without interruption.

"Is the offering-field of all Victorious Ones' dharma-body" establishes that encounter with this teaching is encounter with the field where merit is generated. But merit is not accumulated benefit; it is the recognition of offering without offerer, receiving without recipient, gift without giver. The field is not a location but the very possibility of offering.

"There is nothing exceeding this field of merit" is not a comparative claim but the recognition that there is no outside to this field. Any apparent boundary is itself the field appearing as boundary. The exceeding is impossible because there is nowhere to exceed to, nothing to exceed with, no one to do the exceeding.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Qualities self-nature—not possessed, not developed, not expressed.

Enlightenment's direction—not toward, not away, not stationary.

Great completion—not completing, not completed, not to be completed.

Without remainder—not leaving out, not including all, not part and whole.

Offering-field—not a place to make offerings, not receiving offerings.

Dharma-body of Victors—not theirs, not shared, not common property.

Nothing exceeding—not limitation, not maximum, not comparison.

This field—already the offering, already the fruit, already the recognition.

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza celebrates inconceivable qualities of the Sugata as displayed in teaching. The numbers and enumerations are not counts but indicators of inexhaustible richness. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment and similar schemes are here signs of recognition, not sequential steps.

The profound and vast describe a single nature that is unfathomable and all-encompassing; depth and breadth collapse into a non-localizable display.

The self-nature of dharma-nature is not an attribute of something else but the essential nature of all appearance. It cannot be captured by expression, since expression is a moment of seeing itself.

Direct showing—the yogic or direct revelation that does not rely on intermediate steps—unfolds here as the very presentation of what is already present. Skilful means are not a technique to be learned but a recognition that all methods are skillful when they reveal the non-dual ground.

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza grounds ekayAna—the single vehicle—as the teaching itself, not a sequence of steps. Hearing a single word is not a fragment but the complete teaching appearing as a unit, the ocean visible as a drop.

The line about all the Victorious One's dharmas held, read, and accomplished collapses distinctions among engagement modes. Hearing, holding, reading, and accomplishing are not ordered stages; each is complete in itself and contains the others.

Applied practice here is not striving toward a goal; the application is recognition that there is nothing to achieve, nowhere to go, no one to apply. The effort is the effortless nature of what is already complete.

The equality of capacity and ripening reveals the non-duality of cause and result: neither precedes the other; both arise from the same recognition that there were never two to compare.

༢༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the paradox of containment. The "eighty-four thousand dharmas" indicates not a numerical limit but the unbounded expanse of realization (rig pa'i klong) itself. This expanse does not pre-exist as a container waiting to be filled, nor does it arise through the gathering of dharmas. The gathering itself is the expanse; the expanse is the gathering. There is no separation between what is gathered and the space in which gathering occurs.

"When gathered as one, becomes the treatise" indicates that the treatise is not a reduction or condensation of the dharmas, but their complete expression without remainder. The treatise does not represent the dharmas; it is the dharmas appearing as words. The All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching (legs bshad) is not commentary upon the dharmas but their direct utterance—not explanation but embodiment.

"Why should it not be contained in a single verse?" points to the characteristic of non-localization: the vast does not exclude the minute, nor the minute diminish the vast. The single verse is not a summary or abbreviation but the complete dharmas in their uncontracted form. The lakṣaṇa is this: there is nothing to be gathered, nothing that gathers, and no gathering—only the recognition that what appears as multiplicity was never separate from the single utterance that speaks it.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Eighty-four thousand dharmas—this expanse without boundary, without number, without accumulation.

Gathered as one—not reduced but recognized, not condensed but revealed, the many never having departed from the one.

The treatise—words that are not about, words that do not refer, words that are what they speak, speaking without speaker.

All-Knowing Lama's teaching—not possessed wisdom, not transmitted knowledge, but the knowing itself taking form as these syllables.

Single verse—containing not by holding, expressing not by describing, the vastness fitting nowhere, the nowhere vast.

Why not?—because there is no it to contain, no container, no containing; only this verse already complete, already spoken, already heard.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Even meeting for a moment with a mind of faith,
In whoever's heart longing devotion arises,
Afflictions and obscurations are spontaneously released—
This is the All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching: liberation through seeing.
༢༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the immediacy of liberation through seeing (mthong grol). "Even meeting for a moment with a mind of faith" indicates not a duration of time but the timelessness of recognition—the moment that is not a segment within time but the collapse of temporal sequence. Faith here is not belief in something unseen but the direct recognition of what is already present, requiring no duration to establish itself.

"In whoever's heart longing devotion arises" points to the arising that is not conditioned by prior causes. The longing (gdung ba) is not a reaction to separation but the recognition that separation never occurred. This devotion is not directed toward an object; it is the heart's natural response to recognizing its own nature. The one in whom this arises is not a subject experiencing an emotion; the arising itself clarifies the nature of the one in whom it arises.

"Afflictions and obscurations are spontaneously released" indicates not a process of purification but the recognition that afflictions never had the solidity they appeared to possess. The force (shugs) that releases them is not an external power but the natural state itself, which has always been free of affliction. There is no one who releases, nothing released, and no act of releasing—only the recognition that obscurations were never anything other than the clarity they seemed to obscure.

"Liberation through seeing" indicates that liberation is not achieved but recognized. The seeing is the liberation; the liberation is the seeing. There is no interval between seeing and being free, no practice that bridges them, no maturation that brings them together. The lakṣaṇa is this: the non-arising of bondage itself, seen directly without intermediary.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Moment of meeting—no duration, no sequence, this instant outside of time, already complete.

Mind of faith—not believing but recognizing, not hoping but seeing, faith as the seeing itself.

Longing arises—heart's devotion not to another, not from distance, but the recognition that distance never was.

Afflictions released—not purified, not transformed, but seen through, seen as never having been.

Obscurations parted—not removed but revealed as transparency, never having blocked what they seemed to hide.

Liberation through seeing—the seeing is the freedom, the freedom is the seeing, no two, no process, no path between.

This teaching—not words about liberation but liberation as word, freedom speaking itself, seeing recognizing itself.

Even hearing a single word, the dust of conceptual thought
Is completely abandoned, and the samadhi of peace

This is the All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching: liberation through hearing.
༢༣

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through liberation through hearing (thos grol). "Even hearing a single word" indicates that liberation does not depend upon quantity of teaching or duration of study. The single word is not a minimal requirement but the recognition that completeness does not accumulate. What is heard in that instant is not information about something else but the immediate presence of what is always already the case.

"The dust of conceptual thought completely abandoned" points to the abandonment that is not an act of rejection. The conceptual dust was never substantial; its apparent density was the misperception of thought's own nature. Abandonment here is recognition, not elimination—seeing that the dust was never other than clarity, never actually obscured what it seemed to veil.

"The samadhi of peace" indicates not a state achieved or entered but the natural condition recognized when conceptual overlay subsides. Peace (zhi ba) is not the opposite of disturbance but the recognition that disturbance itself has no substantial nature. The samadhi is not a meditative attainment but the seeing of what never departed from stillness.

"Effortlessly arises" indicates that this recognition requires no cultivation, no practice, no gradual maturation. Effort implies distance from what is sought; effortlessness reveals that there was never distance, never anything to traverse. The arising is the recognition of what has always been present, not the generation of something new.

The lakṣaṇa is this: hearing as direct recognition, liberation as the nature of hearing itself—not hearing leading to liberation, but hearing already liberated, already complete.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Single word—completeness not waiting for more, not lacking in less, this syllable already sufficient.

Hearing—not receiving information but recognition occurring, sound meeting silence, silence meeting sound.

Conceptual dust—never substantial, never accumulated, only the appearance of accumulation, seen through.

Abandoned—not cast away but recognized as never having been, never having stayed, never having obscured.

Samadhi of peace—not entered, not maintained, but revealed as what never departed, never disturbed, never still.

Effortless arising—no cultivation needed, no distance to cross, this arising the recognition of always-having-been.

Liberation through hearing—the hearing liberates, the liberation hears, not two, not sequence, not cause and effect.

This teaching—sound as recognition, word as freedom, hearing the nature already free.

<new>
## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza refines non-abiding by attending to reg grol (touching) as immediate recognition, not a disciplined ascent. Harsh intellectual fault-finding is replaced by the recognition that mind does not require top-down control; cool, gentle touch signals contact without fixation; the peace arises when separation is seen through, revealing samsara as liberation rather than a prison.

Samsara's sufferings are not conquered by struggle but disclosed as non-substantial when touched with clarity. The deathless vehicle is not a vehicle you travel to but the recognition that travel itself is the revelation of a limitless base.

The lakṣaṇa: touching as recognition, contact without separation, liberation as the nature of sensation itself.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

<new>
## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through tasting (myong grol). Sweet taste of profound meaning is direct experience, not doctrine to be understood. Each taste is complete; tasting itself is understanding and nourishment.

As much as one tastes indicates not quantity but wholeness in each moment; there is no partial taste—every moment is complete, never diminished by repetition or accumulation.

The body of hearing, contemplation, and meditation becomes direct activity; the three wisdoms merge into compassionate action that requires no separate actor.

Engaging the dharmadhatu is not entering a new realm but recognizing that tasting is the dharma-dimension, and the power of compassion arises naturally when separation is seen through.

The lakṣaṇa remains: tasting as immediate recognition, flavor without separation, liberation as the nature of experience itself.

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the universality of the teaching. The complete teachings are not a scattered collection but the singular expanse; each part is the whole, and nothing exists outside the dharma-body. The treatise is not a hierarchy of texts, but a single meaning taking form as many words across languages. The universality across Aryan and Tibetan dissolves boundaries; there is no first or outside to view completeness. Lakṣaṇa: the one that is many, the many that is one, the path that paths without pathing.

This stanza opens the door of causality’s dissolution and reframes it as non-abiding through non-dual awareness.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the metaphor of the complete body. "All its limbs complete" indicates not a textual completeness in the sense of covering all topics but the organic integrity of the teaching. Limbs (yan lag) are not parts that add up to a whole but the whole manifesting as apparent parts. Complete (yongs rdzogs) here means that nothing is missing because nothing was ever separate from the body of the teaching.

"Like a divine body beautifully adorned" indicates that the treatise is not a composition but an embodiment. The divine body (lha lus) is not a metaphor but the recognition that the text itself has the nature of what it describes. Ornaments (brgyan) do not beautify what would otherwise be plain; they are the natural expression of the body's completeness, not additions but manifestations of what is already present.

"Other scholarly treatises are like scattered pieces" indicates not a denigration of other texts but the recognition of relative incompleteness. Scattered pieces (dum bur 'thor) are not wrong but partial—parts claiming to be wholes, limbs presenting themselves as bodies. This is not criticism but description: the other treatises address partial aspects (phyogs re'i yan lag) from particular perspectives, while this treatise manifests the perspectiveless perspective of completeness.

The lakṣaṇa is this: the teaching as organic unity, not synthetic totality—not parts assembled but whole naturally manifesting as apparent parts.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through royal and divine imagery. "Excellent quality of sublime poetic words" indicates not literary excellence in a conventional sense but the power of words to enact what they describe. Sublime poetry (snyan dngags dam pa) is not aesthetic achievement but the recognition that sound and meaning are not separate—words that carry the force of realization, beauty that is the nature of truth itself.

"Arrayed in the garb of the great meaning of perfect Buddha-teaching" indicates not decoration but embodiment. The garb (kho lag) is not clothing put on but the natural form of the teaching's meaning. Great meaning (don chen) is not profound content but the recognition that all meaning is complete in itself, not pointing beyond itself but fully present. Perfect Buddha-teaching (rgyal bstan rdzogs pa) is not a completed system but the recognition that teaching is complete in every word, every syllable.

"Crest of the excellent peak-vehicle jewel" indicates not superiority to other vehicles but the recognition that all vehicles culminate in this seeing. The peak vehicle (theg rtse, i.e., Atiyoga/Dzogchen) is not the top of a hierarchy but the nature of all vehicles seen from the perspective of non-duality. The jewel (nor bu) is not a precious object but the nature of mind itself, and the crest (thor tshugs) is not an ornament but the summit that is not higher than what it crowns.

"Like the Lord of Deities" (lha yi dbang po, i.e., Śakra/Indra) indicates not divine comparison but the recognition of sovereignty without domination. The Lord of Deities rules not by power over others but by being the nature of what appears; similarly, this treatise does not impose meaning but reveals the meaning that has always been present.

The lakṣaṇa is this: excellence as natural state, not achievement; beauty as truth, not adornment; sovereignty as being, not control.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Excellent words—not literary skill but enactment, sound and meaning not separate, words as realization.

Sublime poetry—not aesthetic but true, beauty as nature, form as what it expresses.

Arrayed in garb—not dressed up but embodied, meaning as form, teaching as appearance.

Great meaning—not profound depth but complete presence, not pointing beyond but fully here.

Perfect teaching—not finished system but completion in every syllable, every word whole.

Crest of peak-vehicle—not hierarchy's top but nature of all, culmination without exclusion.

Excellent jewel—not precious object but mind-nature, not owned but recognizing itself.

Lord of Deities—not powerful ruler but sovereignty of being, rule without control, lordship without subjects.

This treatise—excellence natural, beauty true, sovereignty of presence, like Indra like this.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza tightens non-abiding through an architectural reading. Steps and stairs are not merely a ladder to climb; they are a mode of recognition, each step complete in itself, with the destination already present in the movement.

The load-bearing beams emphasize that the path provides support and structure without becoming a rigid framework. The great secret is not hidden but obvious; ornaments are expressions, not additions, reflecting the body’s completeness.

The blazing peak signals illumination that occurs in the act of travel itself rather than at a distant endpoint. The four kayas are presented not as sequential levels but as aspects that are spontaneously present and interconnected.

Traveling to them makes movement itself become recognition; the palace of Complete Victory is not a place but an expansive mode of awareness in which victory and dwelling are inseparable.

Lakṣaṇa: structure as support without separation; path as travel without distance; palace as dwelling without location; victory without conflict.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Spontaneously majestic like Mount Meru of the ten virtues in the desire realm,
Spreading hosts of peaceful concentration clouds in the formless realm,
Possessing the completed Akanistha of the noble path in the form realm—
These excellent teachings are like the three realms of existence.
༣༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza maps the teaching across the three realms with a concise, non-dual frame. Spontaneous majesty mirrors Mount Meru of the ten virtues in the desire realm—not as geography but as recognition that transcends boundaries. The formless realm hosts peaceful concentration; the form realm hosts Akanishtha; all are seen as facets of a single non-dual field. Lakṣaṇa: the mountain that is not a mountain, the virtue that is not virtue, the realm that is not realm.

Spreading hosts of peaceful concentration clouds signals that extension is not in space but in awareness; clouds are the unfoldment of recognition, not atmospheric phenomena. The nine vehicles are not a taxonomy but the unity of vehicles perceived non-dually. Lakṣaṇa remains: division that divides without dividing; one that is many; many that is one.

The three realms are not separate ontologies; they are natural expressions of the same inseparable awareness. Lakṣaṇa: the teaching that teaches the three realms as the three realms teaching; the excellent that excels as the non-dual, without existence existing or peace peacing.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza shows the teaching’s adaptive capacity and ultimate non-duality through a minimal, crisp framing. The taming (boddhis) is not about subjugation; it’s about recognizing that beings, realms, and aspirations are not discrete, but facets of a single experiential field. The nine vehicles and mind-investigated path are not a hierarchy; they are a non-dual choreography in which cause and effect are not sequential but mutually illuminating. Lakṣaṇa: perception without dualism, the realm without location, the path that is the essence.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Boundaries dissolve; taming is non-dual awareness in action.
00002| The vehicle is not a ladder but a living expression of realization.
00003| Nine vehicles are not a taxonomy but a single vehicle seen through many perspectives.
00004| Mind-investigated path is not road but the mind seeing itself as path.
00005| Cause and effect are not sequential relations but the same ground seen from two angles.
00006| The expanse of equality arises when duality dissolves; there is no space between the two.
00007| The teaching is not a text to study but a living demonstration of non-dual unity.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza broadens the teaching to address both vehicles and the expansion of realization. The boundless varieties arise not as an inventory but as a single field where classifications dissolve in the non-dual ground. The nine vehicles are not a taxonomy but a unified vehicle seen through multiplicity, and the mind-investigated path reveals that cause and effect are not sequential but interdependent expressions of the same reality.

If one knows this meaning, the Vajra Essence path,
The profound key of the secret Heart Essence like a heart—

Though their bodies may be beautiful, are like corpses without hearts.
༣༤

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza uses the heart/corpse metaphor to articulate non-dual awareness: the naked heart is neither absence nor mere presence; the set of terms points to a unity that cannot be captured by ordinary polarities. The Vajra Essence is not an external tradition but the living form of realization appearing as words.

The line about the “other scholarly treatises” shows that superiority and competition drop away when the truth of non-dual awareness is seen. The heart and corpse metaphor reveals the futility of aesthetics as a source of truth; beauty and form do not make the truth, they express it when seen through the veil of conceptuality.

Lakṣaṇa: the knowing that knows without knower, the essence not essential, the path that paths without pathing; the heart that hearts without heart.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Naked straight awareness—not uncovered, not direct, but the naked that is the awareness.

00003| Heart essence—not text, not teaching, but the heart that contains essence.
00004| Form—not shape, not appearance, but the form as awareness.
00005| The path—not method, not sequence, but the essence that is path.
00006| The great door—non-dual, no boundary, all doors together open.

This stanza expresses non-dual realization without reliance on metaphor. The Vajra Essence song, the portrait of realization, and the realization itself are seen as different expressions of the same nondual field. Lakṣaṇa: the song that sings without a singer; the portrait that portrays without a portrayer; the essence that is not essential.

00001| Song of Vajra Essence—not music but the essence singing itself.

00005| Expanse-flowing discourse—not streaming but the flow that reveals the expanse.
00006| Hearing for an instant—not a moment of listening but the instant of recognition.

Whoever undertakes its practice makes this the final existence.
༣༦

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza proclaims the teaching as the ultimate treasury that ends cyclic existence through the authentic Dharma-body. "The Precious Dharma-realm, most profound of profundities"—the precious is not valuable, not jewel-like. The Dharma-realm is not dharmadhātu, not ultimate reality. The most profound is not deepest, not most difficult. The profundity is not depth, not obscurity. The lakṣaṇa is this: the precious that is not precious, the realm that is not realm, the profound that is not profound.

"The sole treasury of realization-blessed wisdom"—the sole is not only, not unique. The treasury is not storehouse, not repository. The realization-blessed is not graced, not empowered. The wisdom is not knowledge, not understanding. The lakṣaṇa is this: the sole that is not sole, the treasury that treasures without treasuring, the blessing that blesses without blesser, the wisdom that wises without wising.

"This teaching, like the actually arisen authentic Dharma-body"—the teaching is not instruction, not doctrine. The likeness is not comparison, not metaphor. The actual arising is not real manifestation, not true appearance. The authentic is not genuine, not true. The Dharma-body is not dharmakāya, not truth-body. The lakṣaṇa is this: the teaching that teaches without teacher, the arising that arises without ariser, the authentic that authenticates without authentic, the body that bodies without body.

"Whoever undertakes its practice makes this the final existence"—the whoever is not anyone, not a subject. The undertaking is not beginning, not engagement. The practice is not exercise, not application. The final is not last, not ultimate. The existence is not life, not being. The lakṣaṇa is this: the whoever that is not who, the practice that practices without practicer, the final that finalizes without final, the existence that exists without exist.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza establishes the teaching's identity with the Three Jewels through the recognition of naked awareness. "The naked, straight awareness of the Omniscient Lama's mind"—the naked is not uncovered, not stripped. The straight is not direct, not honest. The awareness is not consciousness, not knowing. The Omniscient Lama is not all-knowing guru, not perfect master. The mind is not intellect, not thought. The lakṣaṇa is this: the naked that is not naked, the straight that is not straight, the awareness that is not aware, the mind that is not mind.

"This pith instruction showing things bare"—the pith is not essence, not core. The instruction is not teaching, not guidance. The showing is not demonstration, not exhibition. The bare is not naked, not uncovered. The things are not objects, not phenomena. The lakṣaṇa is this: the pith that is not pith, the instruction that instructs without instructor, the showing that shows without shower, the bare that bares without baring.

"Is the actual Buddha, is also the sacred Dharma"—the actual is not real, not true. The Buddha is not awakened one, not enlightened being. The sacred is not holy, not divine. The Dharma is not teaching, not doctrine. The lakṣaṇa is this: the actual that is not actual, the Buddha that buddhas without buddhing, the sacred that sacres without sacring, the Dharma that dharmas without dharma.

"And if devotion arises, is the virtuous spiritual friend"—the devotion is not faith, not reverence. The arising is not emergence, not appearance. The virtuous is not good, not ethical. The spiritual friend is not kalyāṇamitra, not teacher. The lakṣaṇa is this: the devotion that devotes without devotee, the friend that friends without friending, the virtue that virtuouses without virtuous.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza aligns the Fourth Empowerment with a living, nondual perception. The “famed Fourth Empowerment” is not a title but the living wholeness of awareness that completes tantric transmission when recognized directly, not by lineage or lineage names. The non-dual lakṣaṇa remains: the famed that is not famed, the called that is not called, the fourth that is not fourth, the empowerment that empowers without empowering.

The “final reach” of keys from all tantra collections is not a distant achievement but the present recognition of the oneness of all teachings; the empowerment of awareness-power completes the four empowerments and is accessible in the here-and-now, not in a ladder of initiations.

Seeing such excellent teachings, no other exists: the no-other is the recognition that teaching is not a competition but a shared realization across traditions.

The Omniscient Lama's form of illusion-like rainbow body—
Though once dwelling, is not now non-existent.
If able to see, dwells before oneself,
But if obscured by conceptuality, even if manifestly come, what use?
༣༩

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza centers the rainbow body and illusion-like form as the currency of nondual realization. The Omniscient Lama’s form is not a fixed shape but a dynamic embodiment of awakening; illusion-like is not unreal but a rainbow spectrum of display that reveals mind’s true nature. The lakṣaṇa remains: the omnniscient that is not omniscient, the rainbow that is not rainbow, the body that is not body.

The dwelling and the non-existent are one, since the true nature of the mind is neither anchored in place nor in absence. If the mind can see, it dwells before the self; if obscured by conceptuality, even manifestness has no ultimate use. Lakṣaṇa: awareness that remains in the middle beyond conceptualization.

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza tightens the sense that the key point of speech is not an abstract essence but a live, contextual portrait of realization. Speech and portrait are not separate objects; realization arises in the moment when words and meaning display their inseparability. Lakṣaṇa: the key that is not key, the point that is not point, the speech that speaks without speaker, the portrait that portrays without portrayer.

Commitment and devotion seal an ongoing openness; the Lama’s wisdom is present here and now, not as a distant acquisition but as a living presence.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza cultivates the ground where devotion and critical reflection meet, presenting a non-dual recognition that moves beyond the false dichotomy of faith vs. reason. Devotion grounds examination; examination clarifies devotion by revealing its non-separateness from text.

Devotion obtained—no receiving or obtaining, but recognition as the ground for examination. Words and meanings examined—not separate categories, but the display of inseparability.

Duration of meeting—not measured in moments, but the unbroken continuity of recognition. Mind of direct dharmatā—recognition as mind's nature, without mediator. Supreme luminosity—not brightness, but absence of wavering ground.

The question "could wavering be?" dissolves in recognition; the question was never posed by anything capable of wavering.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Other treatises of logic, analyzed thoroughly,
As much as viewed, deluded conceptions grow.
The All-Knowing Lama's scripture, showing what is beyond mind,
Even one word heard generates effortless samādhi.
༤༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the contrast between proliferating analysis and effortless recognition. "Other treatises of logic, analyzed thoroughly" indicates not a rejection of intelligence but the recognition that conceptual proliferation (rtog pa) operates within a closed system. The more thoroughly one analyzes within that system, the more deluded conceptual thoughts increase—not because analysis is wrong, but because it reinforces the framework within which delusion appears as real. The characteristic is this non-liberating thoroughness: not that analysis fails, but that it succeeds within a system that was never the nature of mind.

"As much as viewed, deluded conceptions grow" indicates the automatic nature of conceptual proliferation when the root of separation is not recognized. Deluded conceptions are not errors to be corrected but the inevitable fruit of viewing from a position that was never established. The characteristic is this non-viewing nature of viewing—not that one should stop looking, but that looking from a fixed position generates what it seeks to escape.

"The All-Knowing Lama's scripture, showing what is beyond mind" indicates non-abiding as what cannot be approached through the instrument that approaches. Beyond mind (blo las 'das) is not a distant transcendence but the recognition that mind never was the measure of what is. The Lama's scripture points not to something hidden but to the unobscured nature of what already appears. The characteristic is this non-distant beyond—not somewhere else, not something else, but the absence of any position from which "beyond" could be measured.

"Even one word heard generates effortless samādhi" indicates non-abiding as the non-production of meditative absorption. Effortless (rtsol med) is not ease as opposed to difficulty but the absence of any agent who could make effort. Samādhi generated without effort is not a state achieved but the recognition that there was never any state to achieve, never any wavering from what is. The characteristic is this non-generated generation—not that effort is abandoned, but that effort never arose as a possibility because there was never anyone to make it.

The lakṣaṇa is this: treatises of logic and Lama's scripture, analysis and recognition, effort and effortlessness—not opposed methodologies but the same gesture viewed from positions that either reinforce or dissolve the viewer. The dissolution is not an achievement but the recognition that there was never anything achieved, never anyone to achieve. Lakṣaṇa: nondual simultaneity, absence of ground for wavering.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Logic's treatises—not wrong, not to reject, but recognized as operating within a system that never enclosed what is.

Thorough analysis—not fruitless, but fruitful in the wrong direction, proliferating what was never other than proliferation itself.

Deluded conceptions growing—not an enemy to defeat, but the inevitable display of a position that was never taken.

All-Knowing Lama's scripture—not another view to adopt, but the showing of what has no position, no stance, no view.

Beyond mind—not distant, not difficult, but immediate, already here, never approached because never departed from.

One word heard—not magical, not powerful in itself, but the occasion for recognition, the trigger that reveals what was never hidden.

Effortless samādhi—not achieved, not entered, but recognized as the nature of what never wandered, never needed gathering.

༤༣

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the offering of rest (ngal bso). "In the many scriptures disturbed by logic's intellect" indicates not a criticism of other teachings but the recognition that conceptual disturbance (rtog ge'i dkrugs pa) is the inevitable condition of texts that remain within the framework of subject-object separation. Disturbed here means not emotionally agitated but ontologically fragmented—torn between what is and what is thought to be. The characteristic is this non-restful disturbance: not that such scriptures cause suffering, but that they operate within a system where rest is always deferred, always sought, never recognized as present.

"Wandering and roaming, meaningless, possessed of toil" indicates the nature of conceptual proliferation as endless circulation without arrival. Wandering ('khyams) is not exploration but the repetition of patterns that never reach what they seek because what they seek was never elsewhere. Meaningless (don med) is not a judgment but a description of activity that generates its own conditions without touching what is. The characteristic is this non-arriving wandering—not that the seeker is lazy or misguided, but that seeking itself presupposes a separation that was never real.

"To the resting place of the complete jewel of words and meaning" indicates non-abiding as the recognition of completeness (phun tshogs). The complete jewel is not an accumulation of perfect qualities but the recognition that nothing was ever missing, that words and meaning were never separate. Resting place (ngal stegs) is not a location but the absence of any need to move, to seek, to wander. The characteristic is this non-locational rest—not a place to arrive, but the recognition that arrival was never necessary because there was never any departure.

"Giving rest is the All-Knowing Lama's scripture" indicates non-abiding as the gift of non-seeking. Giving rest (ngal bso sbyin pa) is not the provision of comfort but the recognition that toil was never obligatory, that wandering was never mandatory. The Lama's scripture does not offer rest as a reward for good practice but reveals that rest is the nature of what is, that the exhaustion of seeking is the beginning of recognition. The characteristic is this non-conditional giving—not dependent on merit, not earned through effort, but the natural display of what is when the effort to escape it is seen through.

The lakṣaṇa is this: disturbance and rest, wandering and completion, toil and giving—not sequential stages in a spiritual journey but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which stages could be conceived. The Lama's scripture is not better than other scriptures but the pointer to what is already the case, already complete, already at rest.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Disturbed by logic—not the fault of logic, but the condition of texts that remain within the frame of separation.

Wandering and roaming—not exploration, but circulation without arrival, seeking what was never elsewhere.

Meaningless—not a judgment, but a description of activity that generates its own conditions without touching what is.

Toil possessed—not the fault of the practitioner, but the inevitable result of effort based on the assumption of separation.

Complete jewel of words and meaning—not accumulation, not perfection, but recognition that nothing was ever missing.

Resting place—not somewhere to go, but the absence of any need to go, the recognition that arrival was never necessary.

Giving rest—not a reward, not earned, but the natural display of what is when the effort to escape it relaxes.

All-Knowing Lama's scripture—not superior text, not better teaching, but the pointer to what is already complete, already at rest.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the soaring flight of the great Garuḍa. "By the wing-flutter of partial knowledge like a bee" indicates the limitation of fragmentary understanding. The bee, though industrious, moves from flower to flower gathering nectar without comprehending the garden's entirety. Partial knowledge (phyogs re'i rig pa) is not wrong but incomplete—it operates within a sector without recognizing the whole. The wing-flutter (gshog rlab) suggests frenetic activity that never rises above the immediate. The characteristic is this non-comprehensive fluttering: not that the bee is foolish, but that its mode of knowing cannot access the summit from which all directions are simultaneously visible.

"Desiring to wander the four continents, fruitless, a mere spectator" indicates the endless circulation of partial knowing without arrival. The four continents (gling bzhi) represent all possible worlds, all domains of experience. To desire to wander them is to perpetuate the root separation that makes experience appear as external to the experiencer. Fruitless ('bras med) indicates that this wandering generates no liberative recognition because it never questions the position of the wanderer. The characteristic is this non-fruitful spectacle: not that the viewer sees nothing, but that seeing never transforms into recognition because the seer remains unexamined.

"Having reached the peak of Meru, the Vajra Essence" indicates non-abiding as the recognition from the summit. Meru (ri rab) is the cosmic mountain at the center of all worlds, the point from which all directions are equally visible. The Vajra Essence (rdo rje snying po) is not a thing found at the summit but the recognition that is the summit—the unbreakable, ungraspable nature of mind itself. Reaching this peak is not an achievement but the cessation of all partial reaching, all sectoral fluttering. The characteristic is this non-reached summit: not a destination arrived at, but the recognition that there was never any distance to travel.

"Clearly showing the nine vehicles, like the great Garuḍa King" indicates non-abiding as the spontaneous display of complete perspective. The nine vehicles (theg dgu) represent all possible paths, from the most provisional to the most profound. To show them clearly (gsal ston) is not to catalog them but to reveal their inseparability from the perspective that views them. The great Garuḍa (khyung chen) is the mythical bird that soars above all worlds, needing no ground, carrying the summit with it. The characteristic is this non-grounded soaring: not freedom from gravity but the recognition that gravity was never binding, that the ground was never separate from the sky.

The lakṣaṇa is this: bee and Garuḍa, fluttering and soaring, partial and complete—not a hierarchy of better and worse but a recognition that what the bee seeks in every flower is already the Garuḍa's view, already present, never elsewhere. The Vajra Essence is not a higher teaching but the recognition that all teachings point to what is already the case.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Partial knowledge—not wrong, not rejected, but recognized as fluttering that never rises to the summit where all directions are visible.

Bee's wing-flutter—not fruitless in its own terms, but generating nectar without recognizing the garden's wholeness, the flower's non-separation from ground.

Desiring to wander—not the fault of desire, but the inevitable result of partial view that makes continents appear as separate destinations.

Four continents—not external geographies, but the display of all possible experience, all domains that appear when mind projects its own fragmentation.

Fruitless spectacle—not empty, not meaningless, but without liberative power because the spectator remains unexamined, the viewing never turns back on itself.

Peak of Meru—not a place to reach, not a height to scale, but the recognition that is always the case, always the center, always the summit from which all views are equal.

Vajra Essence—not a thing found, not a quality possessed, but the unbreakable nature of what is, ungraspable because never separate from the grasping.

Nine vehicles clearly shown—not cataloged, not taught sequentially, but simultaneously visible from the summit, all paths recognized as non-departures from what is.

Great Garuḍa King—not a symbol of power, not a mythic ideal, but the recognition of soaring without ground, carrying the summit in every wing-beat, never having left what is.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the contrast between childish debate and the elder's intelligence of equal dharmatā. "Childish treatises possessing the play of debate" indicates not a chronological immaturity but an ontological limitation. Childish (byis pa) here means operating within a framework that has not yet recognized its own assumptions. The play of debate (rtsed mo'i rtsod pa) is not serious intellectual exchange but the endless oscillation between positions that share the same unexamined ground. The characteristic is this non-recognized play: not that debate is wrong, but that it perpetuates itself without questioning the frame within which debate is possible.

"Attached each to their own direction of is and is-not" indicates the automatic nature of conceptual fixation. Each (rang rang) suggests a multiplicity of positions, each equally certain, each equally blind to the ground they share. The attachment to is and is-not (yin dang ma yin) is not philosophical error but the inevitable result of a view that has not recognized equal dharmatā. The characteristic is this non-equal attachment: not that attachment is a moral failing, but that it operates within a system where equality has not yet been recognized.

"Possessing the elder's intelligence of equal dharmatā" indicates non-abiding as the maturity of recognition. Elder (rgan po) is not old age but the ripeness of view that has seen through the play of is and is-not. Equal dharmatā (mnyam pa'i chos nyid) is not a state of cosmic balance but the recognition that no position is ultimately privileged, that the ground of all debate is itself beyond the categories debated. The characteristic is this non-debated equality: not a position among positions, not a view that wins, but the recognition from which all views are seen as equal displays.

"The All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching is strong and firm" indicates non-abiding as unshakable recognition. Strong and firm (gzu bo) is not stubbornness or dogmatism but the stability of recognition that has no position to defend, no territory to protect. The excellent teaching (legs bshad) is not better doctrine but the pointing that reveals what was never hidden. The All-Knowing Lama is not a person with superior information but the recognition itself, the equality that knows no other. The characteristic is this non-defended strength: not maintained through effort, not preserved through vigilance, but the natural condition of what has no opposite, no contradiction, no debate.

The lakṣaṇa is this: child and elder, debate and equality, attachment and firmness—not sequential stages in a developmental process but simultaneous recognitions available in any moment. The Lama's teaching does not make one an elder over time but reveals that the elder's intelligence was never absent, never to be achieved, always already the nature of what debates without knowing it.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Childish treatises—not chronologically young, but view that has not recognized its own assumptions, operating within frames that remain unexamined.

Play of debate—not serious philosophy, not genuine inquiry, but oscillation between positions that share the same blindness.

Is and is-not—not ultimate categories, not real alternatives, but the machinery of thought that generates opposition where there is none.

Each attached to own direction—not moral failing, not weakness of will, but inevitable result of view that has not recognized equality.

Elder's intelligence—not age, not experience, but ripeness of recognition that has seen through the game of positions.

Equal dharmatā—not cosmic balance, not philosophical neutrality, but the recognition that all positions are equally displays of what is never positioned.

Strong and firm—not stubborn, not dogmatic, but stable because there is no position to defend, no territory to protect.

All-Knowing Lama—not a person, not an authority, but the recognition itself, the equality that is the nature of all knowing.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza presents the teaching as a sword of wisdom that severs the net of delusion at the very moment of its arising. "When delusion, ignorance, and doubt arise"—the when is not temporal occurrence, not sequential happening. The delusion is not error, not misconception. The ignorance is not absence of knowledge, not darkness. The doubt is not uncertainty, not hesitation. The arising is not origination, not production. The lakṣaṇa is this: the when that whens without when, the delusion that deludes without deluder, the ignorance that ignores without ignorer, the doubt that doubts without doubter, the arising that arises without ariser.

"Look at these excellent scriptures"—the looking is not seeing, not visual perception. The these is not particularization, not selection. The excellent is not superior quality, not refined nature. The scriptures are not texts, not writings. The lakṣaṇa is this: the look that looks without looker, the these that theses without thesing, the excellent that excels without excelling, the scripture that scriptures without scripturing.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the sword of wisdom"—the all-knowing is not omniscience, not complete knowledge. The excellent teaching is not superior doctrine, not refined instruction. The sword is not weapon, not blade. The wisdom is not understanding, not insight. The lakṣaṇa is this: the all-knowing that all-knows without all-knower, the teaching that teaches without teacher, the sword that swords without sword, the wisdom that wisdoms without wisdom.

"That cuts through the net of delusion"—the cutting is not severance, not division. The through is not penetration, not traversal. The net is not mesh, not entanglement. The delusion is not confusion, not bewilderment. The lakṣaṇa is this: the cut that cuts without cutter, the through that throughs without through, the net that nets without net, the delusion that deludes without deluder.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Delusion arising—not obstacle, not enemy, but the very condition that makes recognition possible, the occasion for wisdom's display.

Ignorance—not absence to be filled, not darkness to be illuminated, but the recognition that what appears as absent is already present.

Doubt—not uncertainty to be resolved, not confusion to be clarified, but the movement of mind that can recognize its own nature.

Look at these scriptures—not study, not analysis, but direct recognition of what is immediately present, what requires no preparation.

Sword of wisdom—not weapon, not destruction, but precision of recognition that severs the root of separation without residue.

Net of delusion—not external constraint, not imposed bondage, but the self-generated web that dissolves when recognized as never woven.

Cutting through—not escape, not liberation achieved, but recognition that there was never any net, never any entanglement, never anything to be freed from.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When dust-clouds of various conceptions are moving,
Look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the vajra of pristine awareness
That destroys the wall of deluded conceptions.
༤༧

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza presents the teaching as a vajra of pristine awareness that shatters the wall of deluded conceptions. "When dust-clouds of various conceptions are moving"—the when is not temporal occurrence, not sequential happening. The dust-clouds are not particles, not obscuration. The various is not multiplicity, not diversity. The conceptions are not thoughts, not ideas. The moving is not motion, not change. The lakṣaṇa is this: the when that whens without when, the dust-cloud that dust-clouds without dust-cloud, the various that variouses without various, the conception that conceives without conceiver, the moving that moves without mover.

"Look at these excellent scriptures"—the looking is not seeing, not visual perception. The these is not particularization, not selection. The excellent is not superior quality, not refined nature. The scriptures are not texts, not writings. The lakṣaṇa is this: the look that looks without looker, the these that theses without thesing, the excellent that excels without excelling, the scripture that scriptures without scripturing.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the vajra of pristine awareness"—the all-knowing is not omniscience, not complete knowledge. The excellent teaching is not superior doctrine, not refined instruction. The vajra is not diamond, not thunderbolt. The pristine awareness is not primordial wisdom, not original knowing. The lakṣaṇa is this: the all-knowing that all-knows without all-knower, the teaching that teaches without teacher, the vajra that vajras without vajra, the pristine awareness that pristine awares without pristine aware.

"That destroys the wall of deluded conceptions"—the destroying is not demolition, not breaking. The wall is not barrier, not enclosure. The deluded is not confused, not mistaken. The conceptions are not thoughts, not constructs. The lakṣaṇa is this: the destroy that destroys without destroyer, the wall that walls without wall, the deluded that deludes without deluder, the conception that conceives without conceiver.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Dust-clouds of conceptions—not particles, not obscuration, but the very display of awareness that appears to move yet never departs from stillness.

Various conceptions—not multiplicity, not diversity, but the various that is the conception, the conception that is the various.

Moving time—not change, not sequence, but the moving that is the time, the time that is the moving.

Look at these scriptures—not study, not analysis, but direct recognition that requires no preparation.

Vajra of pristine awareness—not diamond, not thunderbolt, but the indestructible nature that destroys nothing because nothing was ever constructed.

Deluded conception wall—not barrier, not enclosure, but the self-erected boundary that falls when seen as never built.

Destroying—not demolition, not breaking, but recognition that there was never anything to destroy.

All-knowing teaching—not doctrine, not instruction, but the knowing that is the teaching, the teaching that is the knowing.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Various conceptions dust-cloud moving time
Scripture excellent these look please
Deluded-conception wall what by destroy will
All-knowing excellent-teaching pristine-awareness vajra is

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the fire of recognition. When attachment, aversion, and delusion's pain burn, the path opens to the scriptures as rest and remedy. The lakṣaṇa remains: attachment, aversion, and delusion burn away in the recognition that the ground is nondual and the remedy is the recognition itself.

Lakṣaṇa: the heat of delusion becomes the energy that reveals nonduality; the flame that burns is the beacon of liberation.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Attachment burning—not to be extinguished, not to be cooled, but recognized as the fire that is already its own nature.

Aversion—not rejection of what is, not pushing away, but the heat generated by the attempt to separate from what cannot be separated.

Delusion's pain—not accident, not punishment, but the friction of wanting and rejecting what is never other than the wanting and rejecting.

Excellent scriptures—not escape, not comfort, but the burning itself recognized, the fire seen as never having consumed anything.

Conflagration—not destructive, not purifying, but the recognition that burns the distinction between what burns and what is burned.

Fuel-wood of affliction—not accumulation to be exhausted, not debt to be paid, but the propensities that dissolve when recognized as never having existed as separate entities.

In an instant—not soon, not eventually, but outside time, the recognition that was always already the case, always already burning without fuel.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Attachment-aversion delusion-of pain burn when
Scripture-excellent these look to-be and

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When tormented by places of distraction and weariness,
Look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the supreme medicine of nectar
That heals the elements with the mind of definite emergence.
༤༩

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the medicine of nectar. "When tormented by places of distraction and weariness" indicates the condition of saṃsāric existence as torment. Places of distraction ('du 'dzi'i gnas) are not external locations but the internal proliferation of attention that never rests in what is. Weariness (skyo ba) is not mere boredom but the exhaustion that comes from endless seeking without finding. Tormented (gdung ba) indicates the suffering that arises from the gap between what is sought and what is found. The characteristic is this non-rested seeking: not that the world is inherently tormenting, but that the mind that seeks outside itself inevitably encounters exhaustion.

"Look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the torment to what is already present. The imperative is not an escape but the recognition that the torment is itself the pointer to what is beyond torment. These excellent scriptures are not consolation but the nectar that heals by revealing there was never any wound. The characteristic is this non-consolatory looking: not finding comfort, not seeking distraction, but direct recognition of what is immediately present, what has never been tormented.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the supreme medicine of nectar" indicates non-abiding as healing. The supreme medicine (sman mchog) is not better than other medicines but the recognition that there was never any disease. Nectar (bdud rtsi) is not a substance to be consumed but the nature of what is, unstained by the conditions that appear to stain it. The excellent teaching is not treatment but this healing itself, the recognition that the elements were never out of balance, never needing restoration. The characteristic is this non-treating treatment: not that something is cured, but that the disease is recognized as never having existed as anything other than the display of what it seemed to obscure.

"That heals the elements with the mind of definite emergence" indicates the function of wisdom as restoration of natural harmony. The elements (khams) are not physical components but the basic constituents of experience. Definite emergence (nges byung) is not renunciation of the world but the recognition that there is nothing to hold, nothing that needs to be released. The mind that heals is not a special consciousness but the recognition that was always already the case, always already the healer and the healed. The characteristic is this non-healing healing: not restoration of balance, not return to health, but the recognition that there was never any imbalance, never any departure from what is.

The lakṣaṇa is this: distraction and rest, weariness and emergence, torment and healing—not sequential stages in a therapeutic process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which disease could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior medicine but the pointer to what is already healthy, already whole, already the nature of what appears as wounded.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Places of distraction—not external, not to be escaped, but the internal proliferation that never rests in what is.

Weariness—not boredom, not mere fatigue, but the exhaustion of endless seeking without finding what was never elsewhere.

Tormented—not punished, not victimized, but the suffering that arises from the gap between seeking and finding that was never separate.

Excellent scriptures—not consolation, not comfort, but the nectar that reveals there was never any wound, never any disease.

Supreme medicine—not better treatment, not stronger cure, but the recognition that there was never any disease, never anything to cure.

Definite emergence—not renunciation, not rejection of world, but the recognition that there is nothing to hold, nothing that needs release.

Heals the elements—not restoration, not balancing, but recognition that the elements were never out of balance, never needing healing.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the companion of awareness in solitude. "When dwelling solitary in a place of seclusion" indicates not a physical location but the condition of recognition. Place of seclusion (dben pa'i gnas) is not remote geography but the absence of external reference points, the condition in which the mind has no distraction to flee to. Dwelling solitary (gcig pur gnas pa) indicates not loneliness but the recognition that there is no other, that what appears as multiplicity is already singular. The characteristic is this non-lonely solitude: not isolation, not separation from others, but the recognition that there was never any other to be separated from.

"Look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the activity of recognition in solitude. The imperative is not an instruction for what to do alone but the recognition that solitude is already looking, already seeing what is. These excellent scriptures are not company in loneliness but the revelation that there is no loneliness, no separation that needs to be filled. The characteristic is this non-compensatory looking: not seeking distraction from solitude, not finding comfort in words, but direct recognition of what is already the case, already present, already complete.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the companion of awareness" indicates non-abiding as accompaniment without separation. Companion (skyo grogs) is not someone who keeps one company but the recognition that there is no one who needs company. Awareness (rig pa) is not a faculty possessed by an individual but the nature of what is, never solitary because never separated from what appears. The excellent teaching is not external instruction but this companionship itself, the recognition that there was never anyone who needed to be accompanied. The characteristic is this non-accompanying companion: not someone who walks beside, not something that fills the gap, but the recognition that there was never any gap, never any distance that needed bridging.

"That transcends the day-night cycle through dharma" indicates the timeless nature of recognition. The day-night cycle (nyin mtshan 'khor yug) represents all temporal succession, all coming and going, all arising and passing. To transcend ('da' byed pa) is not to escape time but to recognize that time never enclosed what is. Dharma (chos) is not a teaching to be applied but the nature of what is, the recognition that was always already the case, always already beyond the cycle that appears to contain it. The characteristic is this non-transcending transcendence: not going somewhere else, not rising above, but the recognition that there was never any enclosure, never any cycle that could bind what is.

The lakṣaṇa is this: solitude and companionship, day and night, cycle and transcendence—not opposed conditions but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which separation could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not a better companion but the pointer to what is already accompanied, already complete, already the nature of what appears as alone.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Place of seclusion—not remote location, not hermitage, but the absence of external reference, the condition where mind has nowhere to flee.

Dwelling solitary—not lonely, not isolated, but recognition that there is no other, that multiplicity is already singular.

Excellent scriptures—not company, not distraction, but revelation that there is no loneliness, no separation that needs filling.

Companion of awareness—not someone who keeps company, not presence to fill absence, but recognition that there is no one who needs accompaniment.

Day-night cycle—not mere time, not temporal flow, but all coming and going, all arising and passing, the apparent enclosure of what is.

Transcend through dharma—not escape, not transcendence achieved, but recognition that time never enclosed what is, that dharma is already the case.

Weariness companion—not consolation for exhaustion, not relief from effort, but the recognition that there was never any effort needed, never any weariness that was real.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This batch tightens non-abiding through the key of method, emphasizing the non-seeking aspect of understanding. The mind’s partial investigations exist as a display within a larger non-dual field; the key is that method reveals and dissolves itself as the ground of recognition. Lakṣaṇa: method as appearance, knowledge as display, and the realization that there was never a separate method to master.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Mental investigation—not analysis, not inquiry, but the endless searching that obscures what is never hidden.

Thought—not cognition, not understanding, but the movement that never reaches what is always already present.

Partiality—not bias, not prejudice, but the inevitable result of the discriminating mind that divides what is whole.

Desire—not wanting, not craving, but the fundamental movement away from what is toward what seems to be elsewhere.

Iron fetters—not bonds, not chains, but the apparent constraints that were never binding anything.

True grasping—not wrong view, not error, but the conviction that something is true that is only apparently so.

Philosophical views—not positions, not doctrines, but the endless proliferation of frameworks that obscure the frameless.

Key—not tool, not instrument, but the recognition that there was never any lock, never anything to open.

Method—not technique, not procedure, but the natural functioning of wisdom that is never apart from what is.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through essential pith instructions. "When obstacles of agitation and dullness arise in meditation" indicates the condition of meditative existence as obstacle. Agitation (rgod pa) is not excitement but the mind's resistance to what is always already still. Dullness (rmugs pa) is not torpor but the obscuration of what is always already luminous. Obstacles (gegs) are not hindrances but apparent barriers that were never separating anything. Meditation (sgom) is not practice but the recognition that there was never anything to practice. The characteristic is this non-obstacle obstacle: not that there are barriers to overcome, but that the barriers are themselves the open ground unrecognized.

"Please look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the obstacles to what is already unobstructed. The imperative is not an escape from agitation and dullness but the recognition that these are themselves the clarity and luminosity, obscured only in appearance. These excellent scriptures are not better techniques but the pith instructions that reveal there was never any obstacle. The characteristic is this non-instruction instruction: not receiving teachings, not learning methods, but direct recognition that there was never anything to learn, never any method needed.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the essential pith instructions" indicates non-abiding as essential pointing. Essential (gnad) is not important but the very heart of what is, never apart from the recognition. Pith instructions (man ngag) are not secrets but the direct pointing to what was never hidden. The characteristic is this non-pointing pointing: not that something is indicated, but that the indicated is recognized as never having been elsewhere.

"That excellently produces the peaceful samadhi without defects" indicates the function of wisdom as natural meditative equipoise. Peaceful samadhi (zhi ba'i ting 'dzin) is not concentration but the natural state that never knew disturbance. Without defects (skyon med) is not perfect but the recognition that there was never anything to perfect. The characteristic is this non-producing production: not cultivation of qualities, not development of states, but the recognition that there was never any lack, never anything that needed to be produced.

The lakṣaṇa is this: agitation and peace, dullness and luminosity, obstacles and openness—not sequential stages in a meditative process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which obstacles could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior instruction but the pointer to what was never in need of instruction, never separate from the peace that was always already present.

Agitation—not excitement, not restlessness, but the mind's resistance to what is always already still.

Meditation—not practice, not cultivation, but the recognition that there was never anything to practice, nothing to cultivate.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the nectar that turns to gold. "When illness, suffering, and harm arise" indicates the condition of embodied existence as vulnerability. Illness (nad) is not disease but the apparent disruption of what was never disrupted. Suffering (sdug bsngal) is not pain but the fundamental misrecognition of what is. Harm (gnod pa) is not injury but the belief that something can be lost. The characteristic is this non-vulnerable vulnerability: not that there is health to be protected, but that the illness is itself the health unrecognized.

"Please look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the suffering to what is already whole. The imperative is not an escape from illness but the recognition that the illness is itself the display of what is beyond illness. These excellent scriptures are not healing remedies but the nectar that reveals there was never any wound. The characteristic is this non-healing healing: not finding cures, not seeking relief, but direct recognition that there was never any disease, never anything that needed healing.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the nectar that turns to gold" indicates non-abiding as alchemical transformation. Nectar (bdud rtsi) is not a substance to consume but the nature of what is, unstained by conditions. Gold (gser) is not wealth but the recognition that what appears base was always precious. The characteristic is this non-transforming transformation: not that something changes, but that the unchanging is recognized in what appears to change.

"That transforms adverse conditions and appearances into companions" indicates the function of wisdom as conversion of obstacles into opportunities. Adverse conditions (rkyen ngan) are not obstacles but appearances that seem opposed. Companions (grogs) are not helpers but the recognition that all phenomena are the display of what they seem to oppose. The characteristic is this non-converting conversion: not turning bad into good, not transforming obstacles, but recognizing that there were never any obstacles, never anything that needed transformation.

The lakṣaṇa is this: illness and health, suffering and ease, harm and benefit—not sequential stages in a healing process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which disease could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior medicine but the pointer to what was never in need of healing, never separate from the gold that was always already present.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Illness—not disease, not ailment, but the apparent disruption of what was never disrupted.

Suffering—not pain, not distress, but the fundamental misrecognition of what is.

Harm—not injury, not damage, but the belief that something can be lost that was never possessed.

Adverse conditions—not obstacles, not problems, but the appearances that seem opposed to what is wanted.

Companions—not helpers, not allies, but the recognition that all phenomena are the display of what they seem to oppose.

Nectar that turns to gold—not alchemy, not transformation, but the recognition that what appears as base was always gold, always nectar.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When the experience of realized awareness dynamic blazes,
Please look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the essential extraction
That points out equality in the expanse of Dharmakaya.
༥༥

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through essential extraction. "When the experience of realized awareness dynamic blazes" indicates the condition of advanced practice as luminosity. Awareness dynamic (rig rtsal) is not power but the natural display of what is never apart from itself. Realization (rtogs pa) is not achievement but the recognition of what was never absent. Experience (nyams myong) is not event but the immediate presence. Blazing ('bar ba) is not intensity but the luminous nature that is never dimmed. The characteristic is this non-experiencing experience: not that there is something to experience, but that the experiencing is itself what is sought.

"Please look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the blazing to what is always already present. The imperative is not an increase of experience but the recognition that the blazing is itself the ground. These excellent scriptures are not instructions for development but the extraction that reveals there was never anything to develop. The characteristic is this non-developing development: not cultivating experiences, not increasing luminosity, but direct recognition that there was never any lack, never anything that needed development.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the essential extraction" indicates non-abiding as recognition of freedom. Essential (gnad) is not important but the very core of what is. Extraction (bog 'don) is not removal but the recognition of what is always already free. The characteristic is this non-extracting extraction: not that something is removed, but that the unbound is recognized in what appeared bound.

"That points out equality in the expanse of Dharmakaya" indicates the function of wisdom as direct introduction. Dharmakaya (chos sku) is not a body but the ultimate nature. Expanse (klong) is not space but the non-localized nature. Equality (mnyam nyid) is not sameness but the recognition that all distinctions are equal. Pointing out (ngo sprod) is not instruction but direct recognition. The characteristic is this non-pointing pointing: not indicating something else, but recognizing that there was never anything to indicate, never anything apart from what is.

The lakṣaṇa is this: experience and ground, blazing and natural luminosity, extraction and always-already-free—not sequential stages in a developmental process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which progress could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior extraction but the pointer to what was never in need of extraction, never separate from the Dharmakaya that was always already present.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Awareness dynamic—not power, not energy, but the natural display of what is never apart from itself.

Realization—not achievement, not attainment, but the recognition of what was never absent.

Experience—not event, not occurrence, but the immediate presence that never departs from what is.

Blazing—not intensity, not brightness, but the luminous nature that is never dimmed.

Dharmakaya—not body, not form, but the ultimate nature that is never separate from what appears.

Expanse—not space, not vastness, but the non-localized nature that holds all without holding.

Equality—not sameness, not uniformity, but the recognition that all distinctions are equal in being empty.

Pointing out—not instruction, not teaching, but the direct recognition of what was never hidden.

Essential extraction—not removal, not separation, but the recognition of what is always already free.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Awareness dynamic realization-of experience blazing when
Scripture-excellent these look please
Dharmakaya expanse-in equality pointing-out do
All-knowing excellent-teaching essential extraction is

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the vajra spontaneous song, with an emphasis on the simultaneous emergence of display and ground. The lakṣaṇa rests on the non-arising arising: the happening itself is the non-happening, the natural display that never moves from its source.

Lakṣaṇa: rushing and stillness, spontaneous and natural, song and silence—not sequential stages but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework that would treat experience as something to manage.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Arising spontaneous—not sudden, not unexpected, but the natural display that never departs from its source.
00002| Experience—not occurrence, but the immediate recognition that never leaves its ground.
00003| Appearances—not forms, not objects, but the display that reveals what was never hidden.
00004| Rushing—not haste, not urgency, but the abundant manifestation that never depletes its source.
00005| Attachment-less—not detached, not separate, but the recognition that there was never anything to attach to.
00006| Discipline—not restraint, not control, but the natural conduct that never requires coercion.
00007| Vajra spontaneous song—not melody, not chant, but the self-arising expression that never departs from reality.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza reiterates non-abiding through the peacock playing with poison. The emphasis is on transforming what seems dangerous into a field of revelation. Lakṣaṇa: the poison-play reveals nondual ground; the poison reveals the nectar; the play reveals the knowledge that there was never a separate other.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Peacock poison-play illumining the mind; transformation not fright but fearless recognition.
00002| Desire and attachment transform into wisdom as the poison is recognized as nectar.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza moves the conversation from the polemic of pride and doubt to the balance of non-abiding through nondual equality. The Lakṣaṇa highlights that pride, doubt, and grasping-grasped arise within a framework that is dissolved by equality—there is no separate ground for either side to stand on.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Pride as the subtle elevation that hides equality is seen and dissolved in the eyes of non-duality.
00002| Doubt dissolves when the ground of all phenomena is recognized as empty of intrinsic self.
00003| Grasping-grasped is revealed as the nondual dance of perceiver and perceived.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When very firm reality-grasping and delusion arise,
Please look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the pith instructions of illusion
That destroys the heap of bubbles along with true grasping.
༥༩

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the pith instructions of illusion. "When very firm reality-grasping and delusion arise" indicates the condition of fundamental ignorance as solidity. Reality-grasping (dngos 'dzin) is not belief but the fundamental assumption that something is truly existent. Delusion ('khrul pa) is not confusion but the misrecognition of what is always already clear. Very firm (a 'thas) is not stubborn but deeply entrenched. The characteristic is this non-solid solidity: not that there is something difficult to uproot, but that the uprooting is itself the recognition that there was never anything rooted.

"Please look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the delusion to what is always already clear. The imperative is not an escape from confusion but the recognition that the delusion is itself the clarity. These excellent scriptures are not remedies for ignorance but the illusion's instructions that reveal there was never any reality to grasp. The characteristic is this non-remedying remedy: not curing delusion, not dispelling confusion, but direct recognition that there was never any disease, never anything that needed curing.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the pith instructions of illusion" indicates non-abiding as direct pointing. Illusion (sgyu ma) is not deception but the display that reveals there was never anything displayed. Pith instructions (man ngag) are not secrets but the direct pointing to what was never concealed. The characteristic is this non-pointing pointing: not that something is shown, but that the shown is recognized as never having been hidden.

"That destroys the heap of bubbles along with true grasping" indicates the function of wisdom as simultaneous release. Heap of bubbles (bun long) is not many bubbles but the aggregation of what was never substantial. True grasping (bden zhen) is not correct understanding but the conviction that something is ultimately real. Destroy ('jig) is not annihilation but the recognition that there was never anything to destroy. The characteristic is this non-destroying destruction: not breaking down barriers, not dispelling illusions, but the recognition that there were never any barriers, never any illusions apart from what they seemed to obscure.

The lakṣaṇa is this: reality-grasping and emptiness, delusion and clarity, bubbles and substance—not sequential stages in a purificatory process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which ignorance could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior instruction but the pointer to what was never in need of instruction, never separate from the illusion that was always already recognized as such.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Reality-grasping—not belief, not conviction, but the fundamental assumption that something is truly existent.

Delusion—not confusion, not ignorance, but the misrecognition of what is always already clear.

Very firm—not stubborn, not rigid, but the deeply entrenched habit that seems impossible to uproot.

True grasping—not understanding, not comprehension, but the conviction that something is ultimately real.

Heap of bubbles—not many, not multitude, but the aggregation of what was never substantial.

Illusion—not deception, not trickery, but the display that reveals there was never anything displayed.

Pith instructions—not secrets, not hidden teachings, but the direct pointing to what was never concealed.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through recognition of inexpressibility. "Although the garland of qualities of the All-Knowing excellent teaching, like a jewel treasure, is not possible to measure" indicates the condition of the teaching as infinite display. Jewel treasure (nor bu'i gter) is not wealth but the inexhaustible source. Garland of qualities (yon tan phreng ba) is not attributes but the endless display. Not possible to measure (gzhal du mi spyod) is not vast but the recognition that measurement was always measuring itself. The characteristic is this non-infinite infinity: not that the teaching is beyond measure, but that measure is itself the immeasurable unrecognized.

"If this little that is spoken is not the ultimate" indicates the paradox of expression. Little spoken (cung zad smras) is not insufficient but the recognition that there is nothing more to say. Ultimate (mthar thug) is not final but the recognition that there was never any journey. The characteristic is this non-expressive expression: not that words fail, not that speech is inadequate, but that the inadequacy is itself the recognition of what never needed expression.

"How could the subject of speech be complete?" indicates the function of wisdom as acknowledgment of limit. Subject of speech (brjod bya) is not topic but the inexhaustible that is never exhausted. Complete (rdzogs) is not finished but the recognition that there was never anything incomplete. The characteristic is this non-completing completion: not finishing the topic, not exhausting the subject, but the recognition that there was never any topic, never anything that needed completion.

The author's humility is not false modesty but the genuine recognition that the All-Knowing teaching is beyond any individual's capacity to fully express. Yet the very attempt to express, the very acknowledgment of inadequacy, is itself the perfect expression. The characteristic is this non-humble humility: not pretending to be less than one is, not denying one's capacity, but the genuine recognition that capacity and incapacity are themselves the display of what they seem to limit.

The lakṣaṇa is this: measure and immeasurability, speech and silence, completion and openness—not sequential stages in an expressive process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which expression could appear as something that succeeds or fails. The All-Knowing teaching is not beyond expression but the pointer to what was never in need of expression, never separate from the speech that was always already complete in its incompleteness.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Jewel treasure—not wealth, not riches, but the inexhaustible source that is never depleted.

Garland of qualities—not attributes, not characteristics, but the endless display that never repeats.

Not possible to measure—not vast, not infinite, but the recognition that measurement was always measuring itself.

Little spoken—not insufficient, not incomplete, but the recognition that there is nothing more to say.

Eloquence—not skill, not talent, but the natural expression that never departs from what is.

Ultimate—not final, not highest, but the recognition that there was never any journey, never any destination.

Subject of speech—not topic, not theme, but the inexhaustible that is never exhausted by speaking.

Complete—not finished, not done, but the recognition that there was never anything incomplete.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This batch reinforces non-dual field perception by reframing the 'field of praise' as an all-encompassing ground. The many realms are not separate spaces but facets of recognition; the domain of individual correct knowledge dissolves into a singular field where the ground and display are inseparable. Lakṣaṇa: field as groundless unity; unity as field; no boundary among realms.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Field of praise—groundless, pervading the whole field.

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This batch extends non-abiding by emphasizing the unity of the sky-expanse as field. The nine vehicles are shown not as discrete paths but as aspects of a single field in which recognition occurs without boundary. Lakṣaṇa: field of groundlessness; unity that emerges in multiplicity; transmission through syntactic conveyance rather than naming.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Blazing with the splendor of marks and examples like the splendor of interval clouds,
Remembering the wisdom of gentle glorious hero Manjushri,
Following that, abandoning mind of the three spheres of true existence,
Mix with the realm of complete dedication without aspiration.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza invokes the wisdom of Manjushri for the perfection of dedication. "Blazing with the splendor of marks and examples like the splendor of interval clouds" indicates the luminous display of recognition. Interval clouds (mtshams sprin) are not weather patterns but the natural displays that appear between thoughts. Splendor (gzi) is not brightness but the natural radiance that was never dim. Marks and examples (mtshan dpe) are not signs but the expressions that point to what was never hidden. Blazing ('bar ba) is not burning but the illumination that reveals there was never any darkness. The characteristic is this non-shining shining: not that something is illuminated, but that the illumination is the recognition that there was never anything dark.

"Remembering the wisdom of gentle glorious hero Manjushri" indicates the recollection of primordial awareness. Remembering (dran) is not memory but the recognition that was never forgotten. Wisdom (mkhyen pa) is not knowledge but the natural knowing that was never learned. Gentle glorious hero ('jam dpal dpa' bo) is not a deity but the quality of wisdom that is simultaneously soft and courageous. Manjushri is not a person but the principle of knowing that cuts through without cutting. The characteristic is this non-remembering remembering: not that something is recalled, but that the recall is the recognition that there was never anything to remember.

"Following that, abandoning mind of the three spheres of true existence" indicates the relinquishment of dualistic fixation. Following (rjes bzhin) is not imitation but the natural flow that needs no effort. Abandoning (spongs) is not rejection but the recognition that there was never anything to abandon. Three spheres ('khor gsum) are not categories but the triad of subject, object, and action that was never separate. True existence (bden pa) is not reality but the conviction that something is ultimately real. Mind (blo) is not thought but the grasping that misses the always-already-clear. The characteristic is this non-abandoning abandoning: not that something is given up, but that the giving up is the recognition that there was never anything to possess.

"Mix with the realm of complete dedication without aspiration" indicates the dissolution into uncontrived virtue. Mix (snyogs) is not blend but the recognition that there was never any separation. Realm (dbyings) is not domain but the expanse that has no center or edge. Complete dedication (yongs bsngo) is not total transfer but the recognition that there was never anything to transfer. Without aspiration (smon pa med) is not hopelessness but the natural state that needs no wishing. The characteristic is this non-mixing mixing: not that things combine, but that the combination is the recognition that they were never apart.

The lakṣaṇa is this: cloud and splendor, Manjushri and wisdom, three spheres and abandonment—not sequential stages in a devotional process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which prayer could appear as supplication. The prayer is not a request for something but the recognition that there was never anything to receive, never anything apart from the prayer that was always already answered.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Interval clouds—not weather patterns, not phenomena, but the natural displays that appear between thoughts.

Splendor—not brightness, not shine, but the natural radiance that was never dim.

Marks and examples—not signs, not symbols, but the expressions that point to what was never hidden.

Remembering—not memory, not recollection, but the recognition that was never forgotten.

Wisdom—not knowledge, not learning, but the natural knowing that was never acquired.

Gentle glorious hero—not deity, not being, but the quality of wisdom that is simultaneously soft and courageous.

Three spheres—not categories, not realms, but the triad of subject, object, and action that was never separate.

True existence—not reality, not fact, but the conviction that something is ultimately real.

Complete dedication—not total transfer, not perfect giving, but the recognition that there was never anything to transfer.

Without aspiration—not hopelessness, not despair, but the natural state that needs no wishing.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

From the door-threshold of the vast methods to ripen and liberate
Of the all-knowing lineage with myself also,
Having the three faiths without giving up the begging bowl,
I aspire at the end of samsara for the fortune to look.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza extends non-abiding through the field of unity. The ground is not a place but the recognition that all realms are a single field where awareness and recognition are indistinguishable. Lakṣaṇa: unity of field; boundaryless ground; transmission through syntax rather than naming.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Field and ground merge into one field of recognition.
00002| Unity beyond multiplicity; there is no boundary.
00003| Transmission occurs as the field, not as a teaching.
00004| Recognition arises where boundaries dissolve.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When existence and peace are equally pervaded,
Hollowing out samsara, erecting peace in a vase,
May the expanse of one drop without remainder of samsara and nirvana
Become mixed with the realization of the All-Knowing Guru.
༦༧

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This final batch continues the non-dual transmission to the closing stage. The field of praise becomes the field of liberation; the multiplicity dissolves into unity, and the unity becomes the expressible form of liberation itself. Lakṣaṇa: field as ground; unity as the essence; transmission without naming.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Field and ground converge; unity remains the ground that carries all.
00002| Transmission through syntax, not naming, remains the heart of the message.
00003| The field of the mind is the stage of recognition for all beings.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

When existence and peace equally pervade/
Samsara hollow-out peace vase-in erect/
Samsara-nirvana without-remainder drop one of expanse/
All-knowing guru of realization mix become may/
