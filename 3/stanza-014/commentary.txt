## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza anchors the teaching in its natural perfection. The vast quality of spontaneous accomplishment indicates the teaching is not earned; it is the recognition that nothing is separate from completion.

The unchanging ground in primordial expanse points to the expanse itself, not as a space but as awareness that is never obscured, never revealed, never altered by what appears within it.

The vehicle's peak union signals the non-duality of method and wisdom, emptiness and appearance, ground and fruition. The peak is not a summit to ascend; it is the recognition that one has never departed from what one sought.

The question "What is there beyond this?" marks completion rather than seeking elsewhere. The heart-secret of all Victors is the open secret that there is nowhere outside this recognition.
