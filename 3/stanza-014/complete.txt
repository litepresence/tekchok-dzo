## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The very vast quality of spontaneous accomplishment,
Possessing the profound dharma-nature in primordial expanse,
The vehicle's peak union, the Vajra Essence's dharma—
What is there beyond this, the heart-secret of all Victors?
༡༤

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza anchors the teaching in its natural perfection. The vast quality of spontaneous accomplishment indicates the teaching is not earned; it is the recognition that nothing is separate from completion.

The unchanging ground in primordial expanse points to the expanse itself, not as a space but as awareness that is never obscured, never revealed, never altered by what appears within it.

The vehicle's peak union signals the non-duality of method and wisdom, emptiness and appearance, ground and fruition. The peak is not a summit to ascend; it is the recognition that one has never departed from what one sought.

The question "What is there beyond this?" marks completion rather than seeking elsewhere. The heart-secret of all Victors is the open secret that there is nowhere outside this recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

The very vast quality—not measured, not immeasurable, but vastness that resists measure.

Spontaneous accomplishment—unborn achievement, not a product of effort.

Primordial expanse—not before, not after, not eternal.

Profound dharma-nature—not deep, not shallow, but the nature that is profound.

Vehicle's peak—unity beyond ascent or descent.

Union—not two becoming one, not one dividing into two.

Vajra Essence—not threat, not protection, but the ultimate demonstration.

What is beyond—nothing beyond, nothing here, nothing between.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Spontaneous-accomplishment quality very vast great
primordial-pure expanse in profound-of dharma-nature possessing
union-practice vehicle-peak Vajra Essence's dharma
victorious all heart-secret this from what is
