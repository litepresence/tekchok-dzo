00001| The very vast quality—not measured, not immeasurable, but vastness that resists measure.
00002| Spontaneous accomplishment—unborn achievement, not a product of effort.
00003| Primordial expanse—not before, not after, not eternal.
00004| Profound dharma-nature—not deep, not shallow, but the nature that is profound.
00005| Vehicle's peak—unity beyond ascent or descent.
00006| Union—not two becoming one, not one dividing into two.
00007| Vajra Essence—not threat, not protection, but the ultimate demonstration.
00008| What is beyond—nothing beyond, nothing here, nothing between.
