## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

One word from the Protector's excellent speech,
Merely heard at the edge, makes samsara reel.
If practiced with certainty, his complete teaching—
What need to speak of study and contemplation?
༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Protector's excellent speech manifests as word without speaker—speech speaks itself, excellence emerges without excelling. The word heard neither enters nor departs, yet hearing occurs where no ear stands to receive.

Samsara reels where no samsara exists—the apparent wandering dissolves upon recognition, revealing that no wandering ever occurred. The reeling manifests stability itself, demonstrating that stability was never established as stability to begin with.

Practice with certainty accomplishes nothing yet accomplishes everything—the certainty that certainty needs no establishing, the practice that practice needs no practitioner. Complete teaching completes without completeness, transmits without transmission, bridges without distance between speaker and hearer.

Study contemplates itself already studied, contemplation studies itself already contemplated. The methods dissolve into the methodless, the learning into the unlearned recognition that was never obscured.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Word from Protector—speech speaking itself.

Edge-hearing—receiving without receiver.

Samsara reeling—stability never stable.

Certain practice—practicing without practitioner.

Complete teaching—teaching without teaching.

Study? Already studied. Contemplation? Already contemplated.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Protector that-of excellent-explained word-one of
Corner-edge merely heard-even existence wandering-into
Certainly do-if teaching complete-completion of
Speech to hearing-contemplation doing-plural see-what mention
