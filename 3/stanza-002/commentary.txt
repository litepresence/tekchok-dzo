## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

Protector's excellent speech manifests as word without speaker—speech speaks itself, excellence emerges without excelling. The word heard neither enters nor departs, yet hearing occurs where no ear stands to receive.

Samsara reels where no samsara exists—the apparent wandering dissolves upon recognition, revealing that no wandering ever occurred. The reeling manifests stability itself, demonstrating that stability was never established as stability to begin with.

Practice with certainty accomplishes nothing yet accomplishes everything—the certainty that certainty needs no establishing, the practice that practice needs no practitioner. Complete teaching completes without completeness, transmits without transmission, bridges without distance between speaker and hearer.

Study contemplates itself already studied, contemplation studies itself already contemplated. The methods dissolve into the methodless, the learning into the unlearned recognition that was never obscured.
