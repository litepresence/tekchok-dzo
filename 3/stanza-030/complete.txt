## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Stairs and steps of the cause-and-effect vehicle spread out,
The firm load-bearing beams of the great secret path, blazing peak
For traveling to the spontaneous four kayas—
This excellent treatise is like the Palace of Complete Victory.

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza tightens non-abiding through an architectural reading. Steps and stairs are not merely a ladder to climb; they are a mode of recognition, each step complete in itself, with the destination already present in the movement.

The load-bearing beams emphasize that the path provides support and structure without becoming a rigid framework. The great secret is not hidden but obvious; ornaments are expressions, not additions, reflecting the body’s completeness.

The blazing peak signals illumination that occurs in the act of travel itself rather than at a distant endpoint. The four kayas are presented not as sequential levels but as aspects that are spontaneously present and interconnected.

Traveling to them makes movement itself become recognition; the palace of Complete Victory is not a place but an expansive mode of awareness in which victory and dwelling are inseparable.

Lakṣaṇa: structure as support without separation; path as travel without distance; palace as dwelling without location; victory without conflict.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Stairs and steps—not ladder to climb but mode of unfolding, each step complete, destination in every moment.
00002| Cause-and-effect vehicle—not preliminary but supportive structure, recognition available at every point, no waiting required.
00003| Load-bearing beams—not mere structure but support for what is supported, a secret path holding without clinging.
00004| Great secret—not hidden but obvious, most obvious yet unseen, secret because always present.
00005| Blazing peak—not reached by travel but recognized in traveling, light as illumination, not fire.
00006| Four kayas—not levels achieved but aspects always present, spontaneous without cultivation, never departed from.
00007| Traveling to them—movement as recognition, going as being-there, distance dissolved in the going itself.
00008| Palace of Complete Victory—not a building but an expansive space, dwelling without dweller, victory without battle, complete because nothing excluded.
00009| This treatise—structure supporting, path as peak, palace as this, victory already won.
