## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza tightens non-abiding through an architectural reading. Steps and stairs are not merely a ladder to climb; they are a mode of recognition, each step complete in itself, with the destination already present in the movement.

The load-bearing beams emphasize that the path provides support and structure without becoming a rigid framework. The great secret is not hidden but obvious; ornaments are expressions, not additions, reflecting the body’s completeness.

The blazing peak signals illumination that occurs in the act of travel itself rather than at a distant endpoint. The four kayas are presented not as sequential levels but as aspects that are spontaneously present and interconnected.

Traveling to them makes movement itself become recognition; the palace of Complete Victory is not a place but an expansive mode of awareness in which victory and dwelling are inseparable.

Lakṣaṇa: structure as support without separation; path as travel without distance; palace as dwelling without location; victory without conflict.
