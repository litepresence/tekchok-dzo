00001| Stairs and steps—not ladder to climb but mode of unfolding, each step complete, destination in every moment.
00002| Cause-and-effect vehicle—not preliminary but supportive structure, recognition available at every point, no waiting required.
00003| Load-bearing beams—not mere structure but support for what is supported, a secret path holding without clinging.
00004| Great secret—not hidden but obvious, most obvious yet unseen, secret because always present.
00005| Blazing peak—not reached by travel but recognized in traveling, light as illumination, not fire.
00006| Four kayas—not levels achieved but aspects always present, spontaneous without cultivation, never departed from.
00007| Traveling to them—movement as recognition, going as being-there, distance dissolved in the going itself.
00008| Palace of Complete Victory—not a building but an expansive space, dwelling without dweller, victory without battle, complete because nothing excluded.
00009| This treatise—structure supporting, path as peak, palace as this, victory already won.
