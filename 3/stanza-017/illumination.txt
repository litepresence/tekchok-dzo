## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Qualities self-nature—not possessed, not developed, not expressed.

Enlightenment's direction—not toward, not away, not stationary.

Great completion—not completing, not completed, not to be completed.

Without remainder—not leaving out, not including all, not part and whole.

Offering-field—not a place to make offerings, not receiving offerings.

Dharma-body of Victors—not theirs, not shared, not common property.

Nothing exceeding—not limitation, not maximum, not comparison.

This field—already the offering, already the fruit, already the recognition.
