## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza establishes the field of merit (puNyakSetra) as the teaching itself. "The qualities self-nature, the dharmas of enlightenment's direction" indicates that the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of recognition. The direction (phyogs) is not a path leading somewhere but the orientation that is always already present.

"The great completion, complete without remainder" points to rdzogs pa chen po (great perfection) as not a system or method but the recognition that nothing was ever incomplete. The completion is not achieved at the end of a process but is the nature of what appears, always, without interruption.

"Is the offering-field of all Victorious Ones' dharma-body" establishes that encounter with this teaching is encounter with the field where merit is generated. But merit is not accumulated benefit; it is the recognition of offering without offerer, receiving without recipient, gift without giver. The field is not a location but the very possibility of offering.

"There is nothing exceeding this field of merit" is not a comparative claim but the recognition that there is no outside to this field. Any apparent boundary is itself the field appearing as boundary. The exceeding is impossible because there is nowhere to exceed to, nothing to exceed with, no one to do the exceeding.
