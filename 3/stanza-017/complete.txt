## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The qualities self-nature, the dharmas of enlightenment's direction,
The great completion, complete without remainder,
Is the offering-field of all Victorious Ones' dharma-body—
There is nothing exceeding this field of merit.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza establishes the field of merit (puNyakSetra) as the teaching itself. "The qualities self-nature, the dharmas of enlightenment's direction" indicates that the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of recognition. The direction (phyogs) is not a path leading somewhere but the orientation that is always already present.

"The great completion, complete without remainder" points to rdzogs pa chen po (great perfection) as not a system or method but the recognition that nothing was ever incomplete. The completion is not achieved at the end of a process but is the nature of what appears, always, without interruption.

"Is the offering-field of all Victorious Ones' dharma-body" establishes that encounter with this teaching is encounter with the field where merit is generated. But merit is not accumulated benefit; it is the recognition of offering without offerer, receiving without recipient, gift without giver. The field is not a location but the very possibility of offering.

"There is nothing exceeding this field of merit" is not a comparative claim but the recognition that there is no outside to this field. Any apparent boundary is itself the field appearing as boundary. The exceeding is impossible because there is nowhere to exceed to, nothing to exceed with, no one to do the exceeding.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Qualities self-nature—not possessed, not developed, not expressed.

Enlightenment's direction—not toward, not away, not stationary.

Great completion—not completing, not completed, not to be completed.

Without remainder—not leaving out, not including all, not part and whole.

Offering-field—not a place to make offerings, not receiving offerings.

Dharma-body of Victors—not theirs, not shared, not common property.

Nothing exceeding—not limitation, not maximum, not comparison.

This field—already the offering, already the fruit, already the recognition.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Quality self-nature enlightenment direction-of dharma
without-remainder all-complete completion great is
victorious all-of dharma-body's offering-field is
merit field in this from exceeding not
