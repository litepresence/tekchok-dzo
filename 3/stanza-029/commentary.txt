## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through royal and divine imagery. "Excellent quality of sublime poetic words" indicates not literary excellence in a conventional sense but the power of words to enact what they describe. Sublime poetry (snyan dngags dam pa) is not aesthetic achievement but the recognition that sound and meaning are not separate—words that carry the force of realization, beauty that is the nature of truth itself.

"Arrayed in the garb of the great meaning of perfect Buddha-teaching" indicates not decoration but embodiment. The garb (kho lag) is not clothing put on but the natural form of the teaching's meaning. Great meaning (don chen) is not profound content but the recognition that all meaning is complete in itself, not pointing beyond itself but fully present. Perfect Buddha-teaching (rgyal bstan rdzogs pa) is not a completed system but the recognition that teaching is complete in every word, every syllable.

"Crest of the excellent peak-vehicle jewel" indicates not superiority to other vehicles but the recognition that all vehicles culminate in this seeing. The peak vehicle (theg rtse, i.e., Atiyoga/Dzogchen) is not the top of a hierarchy but the nature of all vehicles seen from the perspective of non-duality. The jewel (nor bu) is not a precious object but the nature of mind itself, and the crest (thor tshugs) is not an ornament but the summit that is not higher than what it crowns.

"Like the Lord of Deities" (lha yi dbang po, i.e., Śakra/Indra) indicates not divine comparison but the recognition of sovereignty without domination. The Lord of Deities rules not by power over others but by being the nature of what appears; similarly, this treatise does not impose meaning but reveals the meaning that has always been present.

The lakṣaṇa is this: excellence as natural state, not achievement; beauty as truth, not adornment; sovereignty as being, not control.
