## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This batch reinforces non-dual field perception by reframing the 'field of praise' as an all-encompassing ground. The many realms are not separate spaces but facets of recognition; the domain of individual correct knowledge dissolves into a singular field where the ground and display are inseparable. Lakṣaṇa: field as groundless unity; unity as field; no boundary among realms.
