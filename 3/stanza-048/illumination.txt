## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Attachment burning—not to be extinguished, not to be cooled, but recognized as the fire that is already its own nature.

Aversion—not rejection of what is, not pushing away, but the heat generated by the attempt to separate from what cannot be separated.

Delusion's pain—not accident, not punishment, but the friction of wanting and rejecting what is never other than the wanting and rejecting.

Excellent scriptures—not escape, not comfort, but the burning itself recognized, the fire seen as never having consumed anything.

Conflagration—not destructive, not purifying, but the recognition that burns the distinction between what burns and what is burned.

Fuel-wood of affliction—not accumulation to be exhausted, not debt to be paid, but the propensities that dissolve when recognized as never having existed as separate entities.

In an instant—not soon, not eventually, but outside time, the recognition that was always already the case, always already burning without fuel.
