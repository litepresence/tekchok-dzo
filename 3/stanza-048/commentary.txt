## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the fire of recognition. When attachment, aversion, and delusion's pain burn, the path opens to the scriptures as rest and remedy. The lakṣaṇa remains: attachment, aversion, and delusion burn away in the recognition that the ground is nondual and the remedy is the recognition itself.

Lakṣaṇa: the heat of delusion becomes the energy that reveals nonduality; the flame that burns is the beacon of liberation.
