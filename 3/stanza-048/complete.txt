## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When attachment, aversion, and delusion's pain burn,
Look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent conflagration
Burns the fuel-wood of affliction in an instant.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the fire of recognition. When attachment, aversion, and delusion's pain burn, the path opens to the scriptures as rest and remedy. The lakṣaṇa remains: attachment, aversion, and delusion burn away in the recognition that the ground is nondual and the remedy is the recognition itself.

Lakṣaṇa: the heat of delusion becomes the energy that reveals nonduality; the flame that burns is the beacon of liberation.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Attachment burning—not to be extinguished, not to be cooled, but recognized as the fire that is already its own nature.

Aversion—not rejection of what is, not pushing away, but the heat generated by the attempt to separate from what cannot be separated.

Delusion's pain—not accident, not punishment, but the friction of wanting and rejecting what is never other than the wanting and rejecting.

Excellent scriptures—not escape, not comfort, but the burning itself recognized, the fire seen as never having consumed anything.

Conflagration—not destructive, not purifying, but the recognition that burns the distinction between what burns and what is burned.

Fuel-wood of affliction—not accumulation to be exhausted, not debt to be paid, but the propensities that dissolve when recognized as never having existed as separate entities.

In an instant—not soon, not eventually, but outside time, the recognition that was always already the case, always already burning without fuel.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Attachment-aversion delusion-of pain burn when
Scripture-excellent these look to-be and
Affliction fuel-wood moment burn cause-of
All-knowing excellent-of conflagration-fire is
