## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through tasting (myong grol). Sweet taste of profound meaning is direct experience, not doctrine to be understood. Each taste is complete; tasting itself is understanding and nourishment.

As much as one tastes indicates not quantity but wholeness in each moment; there is no partial taste—every moment is complete, never diminished by repetition or accumulation.

The body of hearing, contemplation, and meditation becomes direct activity; the three wisdoms merge into compassionate action that requires no separate actor.

Engaging the dharmadhatu is not entering a new realm but recognizing that tasting is the dharma-dimension, and the power of compassion arises naturally when separation is seen through.

The lakṣaṇa remains: tasting as immediate recognition, flavor without separation, liberation as the nature of experience itself.
