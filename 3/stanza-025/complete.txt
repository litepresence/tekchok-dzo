## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Possessing the sweet taste of the nectar of profound excellent meaning,
As much as one tastes, the body of hearing, contemplation, and meditation
Flies with the power of compassion, engaging the dharmadhatu—
This is the All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching: liberation through tasting.

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through tasting (myong grol). Sweet taste of profound meaning is direct experience, not doctrine to be understood. Each taste is complete; tasting itself is understanding and nourishment.

As much as one tastes indicates not quantity but wholeness in each moment; there is no partial taste—every moment is complete, never diminished by repetition or accumulation.

The body of hearing, contemplation, and meditation becomes direct activity; the three wisdoms merge into compassionate action that requires no separate actor.

Engaging the dharmadhatu is not entering a new realm but recognizing that tasting is the dharma-dimension, and the power of compassion arises naturally when separation is seen through.

The lakṣaṇa remains: tasting as immediate recognition, flavor without separation, liberation as the nature of experience itself.
