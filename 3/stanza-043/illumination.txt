## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Disturbed by logic—not the fault of logic, but the condition of texts that remain within the frame of separation.

Wandering and roaming—not exploration, but circulation without arrival, seeking what was never elsewhere.

Meaningless—not a judgment, but a description of activity that generates its own conditions without touching what is.

Toil possessed—not the fault of the practitioner, but the inevitable result of effort based on the assumption of separation.

Complete jewel of words and meaning—not accumulation, not perfection, but recognition that nothing was ever missing.

Resting place—not somewhere to go, but the absence of any need to go, the recognition that arrival was never necessary.

Giving rest—not a reward, not earned, but the natural display of what is when the effort to escape it relaxes.

All-Knowing Lama's scripture—not superior text, not better teaching, but the pointer to what is already complete, already at rest.
