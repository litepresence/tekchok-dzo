## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

In the many scriptures disturbed by logic's intellect,
Wandering and roaming, meaningless, possessed of toil,
To the resting place of the complete jewel of words and meaning,
Giving rest is the All-Knowing Lama's scripture.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the offering of rest (ngal bso). "In the many scriptures disturbed by logic's intellect" indicates not a criticism of other teachings but the recognition that conceptual disturbance (rtog ge'i dkrugs pa) is the inevitable condition of texts that remain within the framework of subject-object separation. Disturbed here means not emotionally agitated but ontologically fragmented—torn between what is and what is thought to be. The characteristic is this non-restful disturbance: not that such scriptures cause suffering, but that they operate within a system where rest is always deferred, always sought, never recognized as present.

"Wandering and roaming, meaningless, possessed of toil" indicates the nature of conceptual proliferation as endless circulation without arrival. Wandering ('khyams) is not exploration but the repetition of patterns that never reach what they seek because what they seek was never elsewhere. Meaningless (don med) is not a judgment but a description of activity that generates its own conditions without touching what is. The characteristic is this non-arriving wandering—not that the seeker is lazy or misguided, but that seeking itself presupposes a separation that was never real.

"To the resting place of the complete jewel of words and meaning" indicates non-abiding as the recognition of completeness (phun tshogs). The complete jewel is not an accumulation of perfect qualities but the recognition that nothing was ever missing, that words and meaning were never separate. Resting place (ngal stegs) is not a location but the absence of any need to move, to seek, to wander. The characteristic is this non-locational rest—not a place to arrive, but the recognition that arrival was never necessary because there was never any departure.

"Giving rest is the All-Knowing Lama's scripture" indicates non-abiding as the gift of non-seeking. Giving rest (ngal bso sbyin pa) is not the provision of comfort but the recognition that toil was never obligatory, that wandering was never mandatory. The Lama's scripture does not offer rest as a reward for good practice but reveals that rest is the nature of what is, that the exhaustion of seeking is the beginning of recognition. The characteristic is this non-conditional giving—not dependent on merit, not earned through effort, but the natural display of what is when the effort to escape it is seen through.

The lakṣaṇa is this: disturbance and rest, wandering and completion, toil and giving—not sequential stages in a spiritual journey but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which stages could be conceived. The Lama's scripture is not better than other scriptures but the pointer to what is already the case, already complete, already at rest.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Disturbed by logic—not the fault of logic, but the condition of texts that remain within the frame of separation.

Wandering and roaming—not exploration, but circulation without arrival, seeking what was never elsewhere.

Meaningless—not a judgment, but a description of activity that generates its own conditions without touching what is.

Toil possessed—not the fault of the practitioner, but the inevitable result of effort based on the assumption of separation.

Complete jewel of words and meaning—not accumulation, not perfection, but recognition that nothing was ever missing.

Resting place—not somewhere to go, but the absence of any need to go, the recognition that arrival was never necessary.

Giving rest—not a reward, not earned, but the natural display of what is when the effort to escape it relaxes.

All-Knowing Lama's scripture—not superior text, not better teaching, but the pointer to what is already complete, already at rest.
