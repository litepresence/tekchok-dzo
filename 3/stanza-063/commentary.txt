## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza invites the listener to dwell in the field of unity, where joy and meaning are inseparable. The Lakṣaṇa focuses on nonduality: the ground and display are not distinct; the domains (castes) of knowledge echo as one field, and the method is the effortless integration of perception and realization.
