## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

This excellent treatise, with all its limbs complete,
Like a divine body beautifully adorned with ornaments—
When compared to this, other scholarly treatises
Are like scattered pieces of partial limbs.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the metaphor of the complete body. "All its limbs complete" indicates not a textual completeness in the sense of covering all topics but the organic integrity of the teaching. Limbs (yan lag) are not parts that add up to a whole but the whole manifesting as apparent parts. Complete (yongs rdzogs) here means that nothing is missing because nothing was ever separate from the body of the teaching.

"Like a divine body beautifully adorned" indicates that the treatise is not a composition but an embodiment. The divine body (lha lus) is not a metaphor but the recognition that the text itself has the nature of what it describes. Ornaments (brgyan) do not beautify what would otherwise be plain; they are the natural expression of the body's completeness, not additions but manifestations of what is already present.

"Other scholarly treatises are like scattered pieces" indicates not a denigration of other texts but the recognition of relative incompleteness. Scattered pieces (dum bur 'thor) are not wrong but partial—parts claiming to be wholes, limbs presenting themselves as bodies. This is not criticism but description: the other treatises address partial aspects (phyogs re'i yan lag) from particular perspectives, while this treatise manifests the perspectiveless perspective of completeness.

The lakṣaṇa is this: the teaching as organic unity, not synthetic totality—not parts assembled but whole naturally manifesting as apparent parts.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Limbs complete—not parts assembled but whole manifesting, nothing missing, nothing separate from body.

Divine body—not metaphor but nature of text, teaching embodied, words as what they speak.

Beautifully adorned—ornaments not additions but expressions, beauty not applied but revealed.

Compare to this—not judgment but recognition, other texts partial not wrong, limbs not bodies.

Scattered pieces—parts claiming wholeness, perspectives claiming completeness, seen through but not rejected.

This treatise—body complete, limbs as whole, teaching as organic unity, not assembled but naturally manifest.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Treatise-excellent this limb-complete-perfect-of
Deity body beautiful ornament-by adorned like
This-with compare-if scholar-of treatise other
