Limbs complete—not parts assembled but whole manifesting, nothing missing, nothing separate from body.

Divine body—not metaphor but nature of text, teaching embodied, words as what they speak.

Beautifully adorned—ornaments not additions but expressions, beauty not applied but revealed.

Compare to this—not judgment but recognition, other texts partial not wrong, limbs not bodies.

Scattered pieces—parts claiming wholeness, perspectives claiming completeness, seen through but not rejected.

This treatise—body complete, limbs as whole, teaching as organic unity, not assembled but naturally manifest.
