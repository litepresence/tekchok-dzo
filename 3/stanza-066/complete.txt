# LITURGICAL TRANSLATION

From the door-threshold of the vast methods to ripen and liberate
Of the all-knowing lineage with myself also,
Having the three faiths without giving up the begging bowl,
I aspire at the end of samsara for the fortune to look.

# TRANSLATOR'S COMMENTARY 

This stanza expresses the aspiration to remain within the all-knowing lineage until the end of samsara. "From the door-threshold of the vast methods to ripen and liberate of the all-knowing lineage with myself also" indicates the inclusive nature of the path. Door-threshold (sgo srang) is not an entrance but the boundary that is no boundary. Vast methods (rgyas pa'i thabs) are not many techniques but the recognition that has no limit. Ripen and liberate (smin grol) are not sequential stages but the simultaneous unfolding that was never bound. All-knowing lineage (kun mkhyen brgyud) is not a historical transmission but the continuity of recognition that was never interrupted. The characteristic is this non-entering entering: not that one joins a tradition, but that the tradition is the recognition that there was never anyone to join.

"Having the three faiths without giving up the begging bowl" indicates the sustaining of essential qualities. Three faiths (dad gsum) are not categories of belief but the confidence that is simultaneously trusting, aspiring, and convinced. Begging bowl (slong phor) is not a monk's bowl but the receptivity that remains open. Without giving up (gtong ba med) is not clinging but the recognition that there was never anything to hold or release. Having (ldan) is not possession but the natural endowment that was never acquired. The characteristic is this non-holding holding: not that one maintains something, but that the maintenance is the recognition that there was never anything to maintain.

"I aspire at the end of samsara for the fortune to look" indicates the timeless aspiration of the bodhisattva. Aspire (smon) is not wish but the natural unfolding of recognition. End of samsara ('khor ba'i mtha') is not a future time but the recognition that there was never any beginning or end. Fortune (skal bzang) is not luck but the capacity to recognize what is always already clear. Look (blta) is not seeing with eyes but the recognition that was never obscured. The characteristic is this non-aspiring aspiration: not that one desires something, but that the desire is the recognition that there was never anything to desire.

The lakṣaṇa is this: door and threshold, method and ripening, faith and begging—not sequential stages in a progressive path but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which aspiration could appear as lack. The aspiration is not for something to be gained but the recognition that there was never anything apart from the aspiration that was always already fulfilled.

# TRANSLATOR'S ILLUMINATION

Door-threshold—not entrance, not boundary, but the limit that is no limit, the recognition that needs no entry.

Vast methods—not many techniques, not extensive practices, but the recognition that has no limit and no exclusion.

Ripen—not mature, not develop, but the natural unfolding of what was never unripe.

Liberate—not free, not release, but the recognition that there was never any bondage.

All-knowing lineage—not historical transmission, not family line, but the continuity of recognition that was never interrupted.

Three faiths—not categories of belief, not types of trust, but the confidence that is simultaneously trusting, aspiring, and convinced.

Begging bowl—not monk's bowl, not vessel, but the receptivity that remains open without grasping.

Aspire—not wish, not hope, but the natural unfolding of recognition that was never apart from fulfillment.

End of samsara—not future time, not final point, but the recognition that there was never any beginning or end.
