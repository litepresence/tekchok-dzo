## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza extends non-abiding through the field of unity. The ground is not a place but the recognition that all realms are a single field where awareness and recognition are indistinguishable. Lakṣaṇa: unity of field; boundaryless ground; transmission through syntax rather than naming.
