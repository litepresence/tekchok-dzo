## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

Qualities extend wherever recognition reaches—extension itself extends, never moving, never arriving. The mandala completes completion itself, containing what cannot be contained, displaying what was never hidden. Container and contained dissolve into displaying, yet the display remains complete.

All-knowing recognizes what was never unrecognized—knowing itself appears as Lama, knowing itself appears as Victorious, knowing itself appears as regent. Heart-son inheres without inheritance, regency without reign. The recognition of primordial identity clarifies without clarifying anything, revealing without revealing anything.

Prostration bows where no one stands—bowing bows to itself, through itself, as itself. The prostrator, the prostration, the one prostrated to: these distinctions dissolve into the gesture that was never divided. Non-arising of separation recognizes itself as prostration, completion recognizing itself as bowing.
