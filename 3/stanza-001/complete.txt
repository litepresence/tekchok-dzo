## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Whose noble qualities reach to the furthest bounds,
The perfect mandala, complete in every aspect,
All-knowing Lama of every Victorious One,
To you, the regent heart-son, I bow down.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Qualities extend wherever recognition reaches—extension itself extends, never moving, never arriving. The mandala completes completion itself, containing what cannot be contained, displaying what was never hidden. Container and contained dissolve into displaying, yet the display remains complete.

All-knowing recognizes what was never unrecognized—knowing itself appears as Lama, knowing itself appears as Victorious, knowing itself appears as regent. Heart-son inheres without inheritance, regency without reign. The recognition of primordial identity clarifies without clarifying anything, revealing without revealing anything.

Prostration bows where no one stands—bowing bows to itself, through itself, as itself. The prostrator, the prostration, the one prostrated to: these distinctions dissolve into the gesture that was never divided. Non-arising of separation recognizes itself as prostration, completion recognizing itself as bowing.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Qualities extending—extension extending itself.

Mandalic complete—completion completing itself.

All-knowing Lama—knowing knowing itself.

Heart-son regent—inheritance inheriting itself.

Prostration—bowing bowing to itself.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Whose-which Victorious-One's quality-merit limit-extended
Without-remainder perfect-complete mandala-circle possessing
All-knowing Lama Victorious-One all-of
Victorious-regent heart-son become-to prostration-offer
