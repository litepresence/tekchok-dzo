## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When very firm reality-grasping and delusion arise,
Please look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the pith instructions of illusion
That destroys the heap of bubbles along with true grasping.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the pith instructions of illusion. "When very firm reality-grasping and delusion arise" indicates the condition of fundamental ignorance as solidity. Reality-grasping (dngos 'dzin) is not belief but the fundamental assumption that something is truly existent. Delusion ('khrul pa) is not confusion but the misrecognition of what is always already clear. Very firm (a 'thas) is not stubborn but deeply entrenched. The characteristic is this non-solid solidity: not that there is something difficult to uproot, but that the uprooting is itself the recognition that there was never anything rooted.

"Please look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the delusion to what is always already clear. The imperative is not an escape from confusion but the recognition that the delusion is itself the clarity. These excellent scriptures are not remedies for ignorance but the illusion's instructions that reveal there was never any reality to grasp. The characteristic is this non-remedying remedy: not curing delusion, not dispelling confusion, but direct recognition that there was never any disease, never anything that needed curing.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the pith instructions of illusion" indicates non-abiding as direct pointing. Illusion (sgyu ma) is not deception but the display that reveals there was never anything displayed. Pith instructions (man ngag) are not secrets but the direct pointing to what was never concealed. The characteristic is this non-pointing pointing: not that something is shown, but that the shown is recognized as never having been hidden.

"That destroys the heap of bubbles along with true grasping" indicates the function of wisdom as simultaneous release. Heap of bubbles (bun long) is not many bubbles but the aggregation of what was never substantial. True grasping (bden zhen) is not correct understanding but the conviction that something is ultimately real. Destroy ('jig) is not annihilation but the recognition that there was never anything to destroy. The characteristic is this non-destroying destruction: not breaking down barriers, not dispelling illusions, but the recognition that there were never any barriers, never any illusions apart from what they seemed to obscure.

The lakṣaṇa is this: reality-grasping and emptiness, delusion and clarity, bubbles and substance—not sequential stages in a purificatory process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which ignorance could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior instruction but the pointer to what was never in need of instruction, never separate from the illusion that was always already recognized as such.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Reality-grasping—not belief, not conviction, but the fundamental assumption that something is truly existent.

Delusion—not confusion, not ignorance, but the misrecognition of what is always already clear.

Very firm—not stubborn, not rigid, but the deeply entrenched habit that seems impossible to uproot.

True grasping—not understanding, not comprehension, but the conviction that something is ultimately real.

Heap of bubbles—not many, not multitude, but the aggregation of what was never substantial.

Illusion—not deception, not trickery, but the display that reveals there was never anything displayed.

Pith instructions—not secrets, not hidden teachings, but the direct pointing to what was never concealed.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Reality-grasping delusion very firm arisen when
Scripture-excellent these look please
True-grasping along-with bubble-heap destroy do
All-knowing excellent-teaching illusion-of pith-instructions are
