## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the universality of the teaching. The complete teachings are not a scattered collection but the singular expanse; each part is the whole, and nothing exists outside the dharma-body. The treatise is not a hierarchy of texts, but a single meaning taking form as many words across languages. The universality across Aryan and Tibetan dissolves boundaries; there is no first or outside to view completeness. Lakṣaṇa: the one that is many, the many that is one, the path that paths without pathing.
