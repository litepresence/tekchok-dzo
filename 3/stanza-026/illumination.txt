00001| Unified teachings—not accumulation but recognition, not all parts but the whole in each part.
00002| The universality dissolves all boundaries, outside, and inside; no outside observer exists.
00003| The wisdom is not a possession but a disclosure, the path as the very essence of being.
00004| The four empowerments are present in the now, not sequential initiations but one ongoing realization.
00005| Existence and non-existence are one, nondual in their indivisible presence.
