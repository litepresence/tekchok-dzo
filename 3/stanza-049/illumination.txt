Places of distraction—not external, not to be escaped, but the internal proliferation that never rests in what is.

Weariness—not boredom, not mere fatigue, but the exhaustion of endless seeking without finding what was never elsewhere.

Tormented—not punished, not victimized, but the suffering that arises from the gap between seeking and finding that was never separate.

Excellent scriptures—not consolation, not comfort, but the nectar that reveals there was never any wound, never any disease.

Supreme medicine—not better treatment, not stronger cure, but the recognition that there was never any disease, never anything to cure.

Definite emergence—not renunciation, not rejection of world, but the recognition that there is nothing to hold, nothing that needs release.

Heals the elements—not restoration, not balancing, but recognition that the elements were never out of balance, never needing healing.
