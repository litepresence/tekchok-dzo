## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When tormented by places of distraction and weariness,
Look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the supreme medicine of nectar
That heals the elements with the mind of definite emergence.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the medicine of nectar. "When tormented by places of distraction and weariness" indicates the condition of saṃsāric existence as torment. Places of distraction ('du 'dzi'i gnas) are not external locations but the internal proliferation of attention that never rests in what is. Weariness (skyo ba) is not mere boredom but the exhaustion that comes from endless seeking without finding. Tormented (gdung ba) indicates the suffering that arises from the gap between what is sought and what is found. The characteristic is this non-rested seeking: not that the world is inherently tormenting, but that the mind that seeks outside itself inevitably encounters exhaustion.

"Look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the torment to what is already present. The imperative is not an escape but the recognition that the torment is itself the pointer to what is beyond torment. These excellent scriptures are not consolation but the nectar that heals by revealing there was never any wound. The characteristic is this non-consolatory looking: not finding comfort, not seeking distraction, but direct recognition of what is immediately present, what has never been tormented.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the supreme medicine of nectar" indicates non-abiding as healing. The supreme medicine (sman mchog) is not better than other medicines but the recognition that there was never any disease. Nectar (bdud rtsi) is not a substance to be consumed but the nature of what is, unstained by the conditions that appear to stain it. The excellent teaching is not treatment but this healing itself, the recognition that the elements were never out of balance, never needing restoration. The characteristic is this non-treating treatment: not that something is cured, but that the disease is recognized as never having existed as anything other than the display of what it seemed to obscure.

"That heals the elements with the mind of definite emergence" indicates the function of wisdom as restoration of natural harmony. The elements (khams) are not physical components but the basic constituents of experience. Definite emergence (nges byung) is not renunciation of the world but the recognition that there is nothing to hold, nothing that needs to be released. The mind that heals is not a special consciousness but the recognition that was always already the case, always already the healer and the healed. The characteristic is this non-healing healing: not restoration of balance, not return to health, but the recognition that there was never any imbalance, never any departure from what is.

The lakṣaṇa is this: distraction and rest, weariness and emergence, torment and healing—not sequential stages in a therapeutic process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which disease could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior medicine but the pointer to what is already healthy, already whole, already the nature of what appears as wounded.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Places of distraction—not external, not to be escaped, but the internal proliferation that never rests in what is.

Weariness—not boredom, not mere fatigue, but the exhaustion of endless seeking without finding what was never elsewhere.

Tormented—not punished, not victimized, but the suffering that arises from the gap between seeking and finding that was never separate.

Excellent scriptures—not consolation, not comfort, but the nectar that reveals there was never any wound, never any disease.

Supreme medicine—not better treatment, not stronger cure, but the recognition that there was never any disease, never anything to cure.

Definite emergence—not renunciation, not rejection of world, but the recognition that there is nothing to hold, nothing that needs release.

Heals the elements—not restoration, not balancing, but recognition that the elements were never out of balance, never needing healing.
