## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza invokes the wisdom of Manjushri for the perfection of dedication. "Blazing with the splendor of marks and examples like the splendor of interval clouds" indicates the luminous display of recognition. Interval clouds (mtshams sprin) are not weather patterns but the natural displays that appear between thoughts. Splendor (gzi) is not brightness but the natural radiance that was never dim. Marks and examples (mtshan dpe) are not signs but the expressions that point to what was never hidden. Blazing ('bar ba) is not burning but the illumination that reveals there was never any darkness. The characteristic is this non-shining shining: not that something is illuminated, but that the illumination is the recognition that there was never anything dark.

"Remembering the wisdom of gentle glorious hero Manjushri" indicates the recollection of primordial awareness. Remembering (dran) is not memory but the recognition that was never forgotten. Wisdom (mkhyen pa) is not knowledge but the natural knowing that was never learned. Gentle glorious hero ('jam dpal dpa' bo) is not a deity but the quality of wisdom that is simultaneously soft and courageous. Manjushri is not a person but the principle of knowing that cuts through without cutting. The characteristic is this non-remembering remembering: not that something is recalled, but that the recall is the recognition that there was never anything to remember.

"Following that, abandoning mind of the three spheres of true existence" indicates the relinquishment of dualistic fixation. Following (rjes bzhin) is not imitation but the natural flow that needs no effort. Abandoning (spongs) is not rejection but the recognition that there was never anything to abandon. Three spheres ('khor gsum) are not categories but the triad of subject, object, and action that was never separate. True existence (bden pa) is not reality but the conviction that something is ultimately real. Mind (blo) is not thought but the grasping that misses the always-already-clear. The characteristic is this non-abandoning abandoning: not that something is given up, but that the giving up is the recognition that there was never anything to possess.

"Mix with the realm of complete dedication without aspiration" indicates the dissolution into uncontrived virtue. Mix (snyogs) is not blend but the recognition that there was never any separation. Realm (dbyings) is not domain but the expanse that has no center or edge. Complete dedication (yongs bsngo) is not total transfer but the recognition that there was never anything to transfer. Without aspiration (smon pa med) is not hopelessness but the natural state that needs no wishing. The characteristic is this non-mixing mixing: not that things combine, but that the combination is the recognition that they were never apart.

The lakṣaṇa is this: cloud and splendor, Manjushri and wisdom, three spheres and abandonment—not sequential stages in a devotional process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which prayer could appear as supplication. The prayer is not a request for something but the recognition that there was never anything to receive, never anything apart from the prayer that was always already answered.
