I have examined both the editorial conventions and the draft translation of Longchenpa's Yid bzhin rin po che'i mdzod with care. The work shows uncommon dedication to the dgongs pa. This is rare. Most translators chase meaning like hunters chasing smoke. You have sat quietly and let the text reveal itself. This matters.
Strengths
Your particle precision honors the Tibetan syntax without forcing English grammar upon it. gzhig as causal connector, kyis strictly instrumental—these details are not pedantry. They preserve the subtle architecture through which Longchenpa transmits recognition. When shugs kyis appears as "by force," you have not softened the blade. Recognition does not arrive gently; it severs. This precision serves samaya.
The commentary's refusal to reify ka dag as "primordial purity" but rendering it as "never established as impure or pure"—this alone shows you have rested with the text. You understand that Longchenpa points to what never required establishment. Many translators miss this and make the ground into another object to be attained. You have avoided that trap.
Your liturgical layer maintains syllabic discipline while allowing meaning to breathe across line breaks. This respects both Tibetan cadence and the oral nature of these verses. When recited aloud, the rhythm supports recognition rather than obstructing it. This is essential.
Concerns
The commentary occasionally collapses too quickly into ultimate view before honoring the relative display Longchenpa himself presents. In stanzas 1–20, he praises the Lama's qualities with genuine devotion. Your commentary immediately dissolves "bower and bowed" into non-duality. This is true—but premature. Longchenpa first establishes devotion as the gateway. Dissolve too early, and the student has no ground from which to recognize groundlessness. Let the praise breathe. Let the student feel the weight of prostration before revealing that no one ever bowed.
Your "human voice" refinements risk importing Western cognitive patterns—lateral movement, asymmetry—into a text whose power lies in its unwavering directness. Longchenpa does not "move laterally." He strikes one note and holds it until recognition dawns. The commentary should mirror this. Varying sentence length for organic flow may please English readers, but does it serve transmission? Test each phrase not by how it sounds to the ear, but by whether it collapses subject-object in the moment of reading. If not, simplify.
Critical Observation
The greatest danger in this work is not error—it is excellence without transmission. These verses require wang, lung, and tri. No translation, however precise, substitutes for the Lama's direct introduction. Your colophon rightly notes this. But the commentary's confidence—"recognition requires no interval"—may mislead students into believing intellectual understanding equals realization. This is the subtle poison. Clarify always: this text is a mirror. Without the face appearing before it, the mirror shows only glass.
Final Assessment
This draft stands among the most precise English renderings of Longchenpa I have seen. The conventions document shows deep reflection on the translator's responsibility. You have honored the root principle: dgongs pa is sovereign.
Before publication:
Allow relative truth its full expression in the praise stanzas. Do not rush the collapse.
Read every commentary paragraph aloud. If any phrase serves "human voice" more than transmission, remove it.
Add a clear warning: these words liberate only when received within lineage transmission. Without it, they become objects of conceptual grasping—the very obscuration Longchenpa cuts.
The work is nearly ready. With these adjustments, it will serve both scholars and practitioners. May it benefit beings without corruption.
