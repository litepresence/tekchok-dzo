## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Whose noble qualities reach to the furthest bounds,
The perfect mandala, complete in every aspect,
All-knowing Lama of every Victorious One,
To you, the regent heart-son, I bow down.
༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Qualities extend wherever recognition reaches—extension without movement, without arrival. The mandala completes what cannot be completed, contains what cannot be contained, displays what was never hidden. Container and contained dissolve into displaying, yet display remains complete.

All-knowing recognizes what was never unrecognized—knowing appears as Lama, appears as Victorious, appears as regent. Heart-son inheres without inheritance, regency without reign. Recognition of primordial identity clarifies without clarifying, reveals without revealing.

Prostration bows where no one stands—bowing without bower, without bowing-to, without bowing-as. The prostrator, the prostration, the one prostrated to: these distinctions dissolve into gesture that was never divided. Non-arising of separation recognizes prostration, completion recognizes bowing.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Qualities extending—extension without movement.

Mandalic complete—completion containing the uncontained.

All-knowing Lama—knowing without knower.

Heart-son regent—inheritance without heir.

Prostration—bowing where none bow.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

One word from the Protector's excellent speech,
Merely heard at the edge, makes samsara reel.
If practiced with certainty, his complete teaching—
What need to speak of study and contemplation?
༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Protector's excellent speech manifests as word without speaker—speech speaks, excellence emerges without excelling. The word heard neither enters nor departs, yet hearing occurs where no ear stands to receive.

Samsara reels where no samsara exists—the apparent wandering dissolves upon recognition, revealing that no wandering ever occurred. Reeling manifests stability, demonstrating that stability was never established as stability.

Practice with certainty accomplishes nothing yet accomplishes everything—certainty needs no establishing, practice needs no practitioner. Complete teaching completes without completeness, transmits without transmission, bridges without distance between speaker and hearer.

Study contemplates itself already studied, contemplation studies itself already contemplated. Methods dissolve into methodless, learning dissolves into unlearned recognition that was never obscured.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Word from Protector—speech without speaker.

Edge-hearing—receiving without receiver.

Samsara reeling—reeling where nothing reels.

Certain practice—practicing without practitioner.

Complete teaching—teaching without teacher.

Study—already studied. Contemplation—already contemplated.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

By Victorious Ones and their great Bodhisattva sons,
Through heroism and concentrations' liberating power,
In emanation forms of four noble ones, diverse births,
The Victorious One shows every excellent activity.
༣

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Victorious Ones appear as victory—victory without victor, conquering without conquest. Bodhisattva sons manifest as recognition without lineage, heirs without inheritance, greatness without dimension. The relationship between Victorious Ones and sons dissolves into recognition, appearing as multiplicity without division.

Heroic going goes nowhere yet arrives everywhere—heroism manifests as courage without courageous one, as movement without mover. Concentration gathers without gathering, liberates without liberating. The power of liberation liberates liberation, exercising power without power-holder, applying force without force-applier.

Four noble ones appear without fourness—nobility manifests as diversity without division, as birth without birth. Emanation forms form without forming, appear without appearing. The showing of activity shows—activity accomplishes without accomplishment, excellence excels without excelling. Every demonstration demonstrates demonstration.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Victorious Ones—victory without victor.

Great sons—recognition without lineage.

Heroic going—movement without mover.

Concentration—gathering without gatherer.

Liberating power—liberation liberating.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

After that, through emanation body of supreme All-Knowing One,
By Victorious One's deeds, protecting beings of degenerate age,
By treasury of peak vehicle doctrine that liberates through hearing,
He made Vajra Essence teaching clear.
༤

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Supreme All-Knowing emanates as body beyond time—the temporal sequence dissolves into appearance, where "after" appears without subsequentity. Emanation body manifests without emanator, appearing without source. Supremacy knows no comparison, All-Knowing possesses no possessor—knowing knows as knowing, knowing knows all knowing.

Victorious deeds protect where no protection is needed—the degenerate age appears as agelessness, beings appear without beingness. Protection protects nothing yet accomplishes everything, defending without defender, preserving without preserved. The activity acts without actor, deeds without doer, protecting without protector.

Treasury of peak vehicle liberates through hearing—treasury treasures without treasuring, vehicle travels without traveler, peak summits without summit. Hearing liberates without liberation, sound releases without release. Doctrine teaches without teaching, liberates without liberating. The peak vehicle arrives without arrival, reaches without reaching.

Vajra Essence teaching makes clear without clarification—clarity clears without clearing, essence essentializes without essentializing. Teaching teaches without teacher, instructs without instruction. The Vajra Essence pierces without piercing, cuts without cutting, yet cuts through what was never cut. Clarity clarifies what was never unclear.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Supreme emanation—body without emanator.

Victorious deeds—protection where none protect.

Degenerate age—age appearing as agelessness.

Peak vehicle—traveling without traveler.

Treasury doctrine—teaching without teacher.

Hearing liberation—liberating without liberation.

Vajra Essence—essentializing without essence.

Clear teaching—clarifying what was never unclear.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

This extremely pure ambrosia of excellent explanation
From the All-Knowing Lama, that perfect Buddha,
The supreme doctrine from scripture, spoken from his mouth—
Those who do not know this are like cattle in a pen.
༥

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

All-Knowing Lama's quality surpasses Buddha's teaching—ambrosia manifests as extreme purity without immortality, without substance, without conferring deathlessness. Purity purifies without purification, achieving without achievement, completing without completion. Buddha perfects without perfection, manifesting as Buddha without Buddhanature.

Explained meaning explains without explaining—meaning renders without rendering, communicates without transmission from speaker to hearer. All-Knowing knows without knower, possessing without possessor, knowing without knowledge. Omniscience manifests as knowing that knows all knowing simultaneously.

Supreme doctrine scriptures without containing—scripture texts without textual vessel, doctrine without doctrinal content. Mouth speaks without vocalization, sounds without source, commands without ordering. Speaking transmits without transmission, yet transmission transmits.

Those who do not know appear as cattle in pen—cattle pen without enclosure, confinement without barrier, limitation without limiting. Not-knowing manifests as knowing knowing as not-knowing, ignorance clarifying as clarity. Pen writes without writer, encloses without enclosing, frees without liberator.

The distinction between knowing and not-knowing never arose—knower dissolves into knowing, known dissolves into knowing, ignorance dissolves into clarity. Pen and non-pen, enclosure and openness, cattle and non-cattle: these opposites collapse into recognition that was never divided.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Ambrosia purity—purity without purification.

Explained meaning—meaning without explaining.

Perfect Buddha—Buddha without Buddhanature.

Supreme doctrine—doctrine without doctrinating.

Mouth speaking—speech without speaking.

Command scripture—scripture without scripting.

Pen knowledge—knowing as ignorance.

Not-knowing knowing—knowing as not-knowing.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

O you of good fortune, produce great joy,
And develop certainty of seeing the Buddha!
From seeing this excellent explanation of the All-Knowing Lama,
There is perhaps even more than meeting the Buddha.
༦

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Good fortune produces great joy without producing—fortune unfolds without acquisition, without accumulation, without cause or condition. Joy emerges without emotion, without generation, without becoming a state to be produced. The producing produces without making, creates without creation, generating what was never absent.

Seeing Buddha develops certainty without developing—certainty establishes without conviction, without building confidence, without growth toward completion. Seeing perceives without perception, observes without observation, seeing visible form without form to be seen. Buddha appears without being, manifests without entity, appears to sight without sight appearing to sight.

Excellent explanation seeing exceeds meeting Buddha—seeing explanation reads without reading words, comprehends without comprehending meaning. Explanation mediates without medium, bridges without bridging, understanding without understanding. All-Knowing Lama explains without explaining, clarifies without clarifying, sources without being source. Meeting Buddha encounters without encounter, meets without meeting between beings, keeps appointments without appointments being kept.

The "more" transcends comparison—quantity without comparative measure, superiority without superiority over, experience without experiences to compare. The seeing sees no Buddha yet sees Buddha seeing. The meeting meets no one yet meets meeting. The certainty certain of nothing yet certain of certainty. Joy rejoices without cause yet joy causes rejoicing without cause.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Good fortune—fortune without producing.

Great joy—joy without emotion.

Certain seeing—certainty without conviction.

Seeing Buddha—Buddha without being.

Excellent explanation—explanation without explaining.

Meeting Buddha—meeting without encounter.

More than meeting—comparison without comparing.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The ambrosia for the eyes, the marks and symbols of the Mighty One,
Is indeed the producer of three faiths in the mind of the fortunate.
The emanation body of the craft of letter-forms in excellent explanation—
There is none superior to this as medicine for faith.
༨

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Mighty One's ambrosia manifests as marks and symbols for eyes—ambrosia feeds without nourishment, marks indicate without marking, symbols symbolize without signifying. Mighty One mights without possessing might, eyes see without seeing. The sensory experience dissolves: marks mark unmarked, symbols signify unsignified, ambrosia nourishes unnourished.

Three faiths produce in fortunate mind without production—production produces without causation, faiths believe without believers, mind contains without containment. The fortunate receives without receiving, experiencing without experiencer. Faith manifests threefold yet faith itself remains indivisible, uncountable, uncontainable.

Letter-form craft emanates as excellent explanation—craft forms without skill, letters without literacy, explanation without clarifying. Emanation projects without projection, appearing without source. Excellence excels without comparison, explanation explains without explaining.

No medicine surpasses this as faith's remedy—superiority ranks without hierarchy, medicine cures without healing, faith believes without belief. The remedy remedies without remedying, healing without curing. Medicine itself heals what was never ill, faith itself believes what was never disbelieved.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Mighty ambrosia—seeing without seeing.

Marks symbols—marking without marking.

Three faiths—believing without believers.

Fortunate mind—containing without containment.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The ambrosia for the ears, the Brahma-sound of the Teacher,
Is indeed the producer of wisdom in the mind of the fortunate.
The ambrosia for the ears, the garland of words in excellent explanation—
There is none equal to this as medicine for wisdom.
༩

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Ambrosia dissolves hearing's act; Brahma-sound is sound that sounds—no utterer, no receiver. Wisdom arises without source; the fortunate mind knows without a knower. A garland of words forms without a binding thread. Medicine cures without cure; healing arises without healing. Sound emerges as sound; hearing recognizes what recognizes. Brahma-sound speaks without uttering; teaching teaches by presence, not by a teacher. Words arrange themselves into a garland, not by deliberate arrangement.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Ambrosia for ears—hearing without hearing.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The ambrosia for the heart, the blessing of the Victorious One,
Is indeed the shower of truth upon the mind of the fortunate.
The ambrosia for the heart, the good meaning in excellent explanation—
This itself is supreme as medicine for wisdom in the mind.
༡༠

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza dissolves blessing and reception as separate acts, unbinding blessing from any giver and withdrawal from any receiver. Ambrosia for heart and Victorious One's blessing are not substances or transmissions but openings that allow recognition to occur without a sender or a destination.

The shower of truth upon mind is not a proposition verified, nor a surface that truth rests upon; it is showing itself within fortunate mind, a mind that bears blessing as wisdom-in-action rather than as possession.

The ambrosia for heart and good meaning in excellent explanation likewise dissolve into practice of seeing, where explanation is not a delivery of meaning but an unveiling of non-conceptual knowing.

This stanza presents supremacist medicine for wisdom as a mind-state that does not reside in a fixed object or state; supremacy is not rank but function through recognition. The lakṣaṇa remains: blessing that blesses without blesser, truth that shows without shower, heart that receives without reception, wisdom that knows without knower.

In short, nourishment becomes appearance, appearance becomes nourishment, and transmission dissolves into recognition that there is no separate donor or recipient.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Heart ambrosia—nourishing the unnourished.

Victorious blessing—blessing without blesser.

Truth shower—showing without showing-to.

Fortunate mind—bearing wisdom as action.

༡༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through dissolution of power and its effects. "Blessed by the power of liberation and concentration"—blessing not as transfer, power not as capacity, liberation not as release, concentration not as state. "Seeing this, reality arises forcefully in mind"—seeing not as perception, arising not as emergence, force not as violence, mind not as container. "Able to show the primordially pure intention immediately"—ability not as skill, showing not as display, primordial purity not as state, immediacy not as directness, intention not as purpose. "There is nothing like this for destroying grasping at phenomena"—nothing-like not as uniqueness, destroying not as annihilation, grasping not as holding, phenomena not as objects. The lakṣaṇa: power that empowers without power, seeing that sees without seer, arising that arises without arising, destroying that destroys without destruction. Primordial purity not as before defilement but appearing that appears as neither pure nor impure, without before, without after.

The letter's form, the Lion of ShAkya's body,
The string of words, the speech of Omniscient Lama,
The profound meaning, the heart of all Victorious Ones—
Seeing this scripture, the Sugata complete is seen.
༡༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza establishes inseparability of literary form and enlightened presence. "The letter's form, the Lion of ShAkya's body" indicates not a metaphorical correspondence but an identity without hierarchy—the written character is not a symbol pointing to a body, nor body a referent for character. Both are appearances of the same non-localizable display, neither prior nor subsequent to one another.

"The string of words, the speech of Omniscient Lama" collapses distinction between expression and expresser. The words are not vehicles carrying meaning from a source; Lama's speech is words themselves, not possessed by a speaker, not produced in time, not received by an ear. The expression is complete in each syllable, not distributed across a sequence.

"The profound meaning, the heart of all Victorious Ones" indicates meaning that does not await interpretation. The meaning is not extracted from words, not discovered through analysis, not revealed after reading. The profound is very surface; depth is appearance itself, not hidden behind or within it.

"Seeing this scripture, the Sugata complete is seen" establishes that encounter with text is encounter with complete awakening—not partial, not progressive, not culminating in a future recognition. The Sugata is not seen through scripture as through a window; seeing of scripture is seeing of Sugata, without remainder, without scripture functioning as medium or means.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

The letter's form—this appearing as form.

The Lion's body—never separate from the syllable.

The string of words—complete in the first character.

The Lama's speech—words themselves.

The profound meaning—this very surface.

The heart of Victorious Ones—already given.

Seeing this scripture—seeing of Sugata.

The Sugata complete—never incomplete.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When the doctrine reaches its five hundred final years,
The Teacher dwells within the letter's form,
Thus spoke the Protector, compassion's heart,
The Lion of ShAkya's face-acceptance just like this.
༡༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza addresses the enduring presence of teacher in the teaching. "When the doctrine reaches its five hundred final years" does not mark a historical period but indicates the apparent fading of form—the moment when manifested presence seems to withdraw. Yet this withdrawal is not cessation; it is transformation into another mode of display.

"The Teacher dwells within the letter's form" establishes that the teacher's presence is not bound to a particular manifestation. The letters are not memorials preserving what has passed; they are the teacher's actual dwelling. The form of the letter is the form of the teacher—not symbolically, but as the same unlocalizable appearance.

"Thus spoke the Protector, compassion's heart" indicates that this teaching comes from the recognition that the protector's compassionate activity does not cease. The heart of compassion is not exhausted in particular acts of protection; it continues as the very availability of the teaching, the accessibility of the letters, the possibility of encounter.

"The Lion of ShAkya's face-acceptance" refers to the manner in which the Buddha's promise and prophecy are fulfilled—not through the persistence of a historical person, but through the inexhaustible availability of the teaching itself. The acceptance is the recognition that the teaching never departs, never arrives, never abides in between.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

The five hundred final years—apparent fading that never fades.

The Teacher dwells—not moving into the letters.

The letter's form—the Teacher's form, neither two nor one.

The Protector's heart—danger itself recognized.

The Lion's acceptance—never given, never received, never promised.

This just like this—the same.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Five hundred final-of doctrine become time

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The seven great treasuries of excellent explanation,
The complete doctrine, the single-life Buddha's dharma,
This profound path, a drop of wonder-nectar—
Who could disparage the speech of Omniscient Lama?
༡༣

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza celebrates the comprehensive nature of the teaching. "The seven great treasuries of excellent explanation" refers not to a catalogue of works but to the inexhaustible richness of the teaching—treasury indicating not storage but overflowing abundance. The seven is complete completion, not a numerical limit but the fullness of what is given without measure.

"The complete doctrine, single-life Buddha's dharma" indicates that the entire teaching is available in this immediate presentation, not distributed across time or requiring sequential accomplishment. The single life is not a biography but the singularity of this very moment of recognition—the life that is not one among many, but the non-duality of life and awakening.

"This profound path, a drop of wonder-nectar" collapses the distinction between vastness and concentration. The drop contains the ocean; the single word contains the complete teaching. The nectar is not medicinal in the sense of curing a disease that exists independently; it is the recognition that the disease was never other than the medicine, the patient never other than the physician.

The question "Who could disparage the speech of Omniscient Lama?" is not rhetorical in the conventional sense. It points to the impossibility of finding a position from which disparagement could occur. To disparage would require standing outside the teaching, but there is no outside—only the recognition that any apparent disparagement is itself the teaching appearing as denial.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Seven treasuries—overflow that cannot be held.

Excellent explanation—explanation itself complete.

Complete doctrine—neither partial nor completing.

Single-life—the singularity of this recognition.

Drop of nectar—the ocean in the drop.

Who could disparage—no position exists outside.

The Lama's speech—not spoken to someone, not received by anyone.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The very vast quality of spontaneous accomplishment,
Possessing the profound dharma-nature in primordial expanse,
The vehicle's peak union, the Vajra Essence's dharma—
What is there beyond this, the heart-secret of all Victors?
༡༤

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza anchors the teaching in its natural perfection. The vast quality of spontaneous accomplishment indicates the teaching is not earned; it is the recognition that nothing is separate from completion.

The unchanging ground in primordial expanse points to the expanse itself, not as a space but as awareness that is never obscured, never revealed, never altered by what appears within it.

The vehicle's peak union signals the non-duality of method and wisdom, emptiness and appearance, ground and fruition. The peak is not a summit to ascend; it is the recognition that one has never departed from what one sought.

The question "What is there beyond this?" marks completion rather than seeking elsewhere. The heart-secret of all Victors is the open secret that there is nowhere outside this recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

The very vast quality—vastness that resists measure.

Spontaneous accomplishment—achievement not from effort.

Primordial expanse—never before, never after.

Profund dharma-nature—the nature that is profound.

Vehicle's peak—unity beyond ascent.

Union—neither two nor one.

Vajra Essence—the ultimate demonstration.

What is beyond—nowhere outside this recognition.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The Muni's beautiful body, like a mountain of gold,
That is indeed the special characteristic of seeing form-body,
The dharma-nature's self-nature, impossible to express—
This alone is the fortune of seeing dharmakAya.
༡༥

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza aligns form-body and dharma-body as modes of recognition, not discrete entities. The Muni's beautiful body, like a mountain of gold, signals appearance as appearance—gold in the form of perception, not substance.

That is indeed the special characteristic of seeing form-body: the form-body is not an object perceived by a subject but the very characteristic of perception itself. The seeing is the body; the body is the seeing. There is no body that exists independently of being seen, no seeing that occurs independently of what appears.

The dharma-nature's self-nature, impossible to express, points to what cannot be captured in expression—not because it is hidden or subtle but because expression is itself a mode of this nature. The impossibility of expression is not a limitation but the nature of expression itself, which never succeeds in capturing because there is nothing to capture, no one to capture it.

This alone is the fortune of seeing dharmakaya: the recognition that there is no one who sees, nothing seen, no seeing—yet the seeing occurs, unmistakably, without witness.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Golden mountain—gold as perception.

Beautiful body—appearance as appearance.

Form-body—the seeing itself.

Impossible to express—expression that is the nature.

Dharma-nature's self-nature—never hidden, never revealed.

This alone—no other things exist.

Fortune of seeing—recognition occurring without witness.

Dharmakaya—never seen, never unseen.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

What the Protector knew at the tree-power trunk,
And what the Victorious Sons saw as true,
By a single word of the All-knowing Lama's excellent speech,
Is shown as the inexpressible meaning through skilful means.
༡༦

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza knots the historical awakening to the teaching in the present moment. The tree-power trunk marks a recognition that is always available, not a singular historical site. The trunk is the support that is not separate from what it supports—recognition itself.

What the Victorious Sons saw as true attests that the seeing of the sages is not different in essence from the seeing we now point to. It is the same recognition, appearing under different circumstances.

A single word of the All-knowing Lama's excellent speech collapses the distinction between breadth and depth; utterance is not a separate act but the recognition happening through sound or silence. The idea of skilful means is not a method but the understanding that all means serve the same revelation.

This seeing is shown as inexpressible meaning through skilful means—expression's limit is the form through which recognition passes, not a barrier to truth. The lakṣa: the field of merit is not a collection of texts but the teaching itself, inviting immediate recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Tree-power trunk—recognition always available.

What the Protector knew—knowledge not accumulated.

Victorious Sons—same recognition appearing.

Single word—recognition through sound or silence.

Inexpressible meaning—expression's limit as passage.

Skilful means—all means serve same revelation.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The qualities self-nature, the dharmas of enlightenment's direction,
The great completion, complete without remainder,
Is the offering-field of all Victorious Ones' dharma-body—
There is nothing exceeding this field of merit.
༡༧

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza declares the comprehensive availability of the teaching. Qualities self-nature indicates that the qualities are not attributes but the nature itself—nature manifesting as qualities, not qualities manifesting as nature.

The dharmas of enlightenment's direction—direction is not directional but encompasses all directions without pointing. Enlightenment is not separate from qualities but is their self-nature.

The great completion, complete without remainder, signals that nothing remains to be completed—completion is not an achievement to be reached but the recognition that was never incomplete.

Is the offering-field of all Victorious Ones' dharma-body—offering is not ritual sacrifice, not giving from one to another. The field is not a location but the range where recognition occurs. The dharma-body is not an entity receiving offerings but the mode in which Victorious Ones appear.

There is nothing exceeding this field of merit—nothing exceeds because the field itself is the complete teaching; to seek elsewhere would be seeking outside recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Qualities self-nature—nature manifesting as qualities.

Dharmas of enlightenment's direction—encompassing all directions.

Great completion—nothing remains to be completed.

Complete without remainder—never was incomplete.

Offering-field—range where recognition occurs.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

By showing the supreme qualities of the Muni's sUtras,
Inconceivable in number, profound and vast,
The self-nature of dharma-nature, profound and vast,
Is directly shown—this quality is also that alone.
༡༨

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza celebrates the inconceivable qualities of the Sugata as displayed in the teaching. The numbers and enumerations are not counts but indicators of inexhaustible richness. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment and similar schemes are signs of recognition, not sequential steps.

The profound and vast describe a single nature that is unfathomable and all-encompassing; depth and breadth collapse into a non-localizable display.

The self-nature of dharma-nature is not an attribute of something else but the essential nature of all appearance. It cannot be captured by expression, since expression is a moment of seeing itself.

Direct showing—the yogic or direct revelation that does not rely on intermediate steps—unfolds here as the very presentation of what is already present. Skilful means are not a technique to be learned but a recognition that all methods are skillful when they reveal the non-dual ground.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Inconceivable qualities—not too many to conceive.

Profound—not deep, not hidden.

Vast—not extended, not spacious.

Self-nature of dharma-nature—not two things, not one thing.

Directly shown—not revealed, not presented.

This quality—that alone, not exclusive.

Therefore, hearing a single word of this scripture,

Applying oneself to hearing, holding, reading, and accomplishing,
The capacity and ripening of merit are equal.
༡༩

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza grounds ekayana—the single vehicle—as the teaching itself, not a sequence of steps. Hearing a single word is not a fragment but the complete teaching appearing as a unit; ocean visible as a drop.

The line about all the Victorious One's dharmas held, read, and accomplished collapses distinctions among engagement modes. Hearing, holding, reading, and accomplishing are not ordered stages; each is complete in itself and contains the others.

Applied practice here is not striving toward a goal; the application is the recognition that there is nothing to achieve, nowhere to go, no one to apply. The effort is the effortless nature of what is already complete.

The equality of capacity and ripening reveals the non-duality of cause and result: neither precedes the other; both arise from the same recognition that there were never two to compare.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Single word—completeness, not fragment.

This scripture—separate from hearing.

All dharmas—one, not many.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza maintains inclusion without reduction; expanse of eighty-four thousand dharmas is not a count but an inexhaustible display. The teaching is not distributed across texts but concentrated in a single theme; the ocean appears as a wave without loss.

The principle applies to this present teaching: the Lama's speech is not lesser due to its later appearance; it is the same recognition appearing differently.

The extraordinary dharma is that the complete is never incomplete; the single word contains what cannot be contained, and the Lama's teaching is not derivative but original appearing as repetition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

༢༠

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through immediacy of liberation through seeing. "Even meeting for a moment with a mind of faith" indicates not a duration of time but timelessness of recognition—the moment that is not a segment within time but collapse of temporal sequence.

Faith here is not belief in something unseen but direct recognition of what is already present, requiring no duration to establish itself. The longing (gdung ba) is not a reaction to separation but recognition that separation never occurred. This devotion is not directed toward an object; it is heart's natural response to recognizing its own nature. The one in whom this arises is not a subject experiencing an emotion; arising itself clarifies nature of one in whom it arises.

"Afflictions and obscurations are spontaneously released" indicates not a process of purification but recognition that afflictions never had solidity they appeared to possess. The force (shugs) that releases them is not an external power but natural state itself, which has always been free of affliction. There is no one who releases, nothing released, and no act of releasing—only recognition that obscurations were never anything other than clarity they seemed to obscure.

"Liberation through seeing" indicates that liberation is not achieved but recognized. The seeing is liberation; liberation is seeing. There is no interval between seeing and being free, no practice that bridges them, no maturation that brings them together. The lakṣaṇa is this: non-arising of bondage itself, seen directly without intermediary.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Moment of meeting—timeless, instant.

Mind of faith—not believing but recognizing.

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Even hearing a single word, dust of conceptual thought
Is completely abandoned, and samadhi of peace
Effortlessly arises in the mind—
This is the All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching: liberation through hearing.
༢༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through liberation through hearing (thos grol). "Even hearing a single word" indicates that liberation does not depend upon quantity of teaching or duration of study. The single word is not a minimal requirement but recognition that completeness does not accumulate. What is heard in that instant is not information about something else but immediate presence of what is always already the case.

"The dust of conceptual thought completely abandoned" points to abandonment that is not an act of rejection. The conceptual dust was never substantial; its apparent density was misperception of thought's own nature. Abandonment here is recognition, not elimination—seeing that dust was never other than clarity, never actually obscured what it seemed to veil.

"The samadhi of peace" indicates not a state achieved or entered but natural condition recognized when conceptual overlay subsides. Peace (zhi ba) is not opposite of disturbance but recognition that disturbance itself has no substantial nature. The samadhi is not a meditative attainment but seeing of what never departed from stillness.

"Effortlessly arises" indicates that this recognition requires no cultivation, no practice, no gradual maturation. Effort implies distance from what is sought; effortlessness reveals that there was never distance, never anything to traverse. The arising is recognition of what has always been present, not generation of something new.

The lakṣaṇa is this: hearing as direct recognition, liberation as nature of hearing itself—not hearing leading to liberation, but hearing already liberated, already complete.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Single word—completeness, not fragment.

Hearing—not receiving information but recognition occurring.

Conceptual dust—never substantial, never accumulated.

Abandoned—not cast away but recognized as never having been.

Samadhi of peace—not entered, not maintained but revealed as what never departed.

Effortless arising—no cultivation, no distance to cross.

༢༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza declares the unprecedented nature of the teaching. "This profound and vast excellent teaching" points to richness that cannot be contained by any number or classification. Profound and vast indicate not depth and breadth in opposition but non-localizable expanse—recognition that defies ordinary measurement.

"Neither ever taught by any learned of two" establishes that the teaching appears without precedent, without transmission line, without historical sequence of teacher to student. The teaching itself is the source; no one transmitted it, no one received it.

"How could India-place pandita have arranged it" indicates that this teaching's appearance defies ordinary causation. Pandita is the second Buddha but here appears as if first—not because of succession but because recognition is outside succession. The arrangement is not an action performed by pandita but recognition appearing as the teaching itself.

"It is beyond even mind of Vajradhara" marks the singularity and completeness that transcend ordinary mind-states. Vajradhara is not a special destination but the very condition of this recognition itself. The lakṣaṇa: teaching that teaches without teacher, appears without source, transcends ordinary mind.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

༢༢

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza points to the immediacy of liberation. "If whoever meets, with a mind of faith even for a moment" indicates that recognition does not require duration; the moment is not a fragment but the complete encounter. Faith here is not belief in something absent but recognition that recognizes what is already present.

"This very teaching of All-Knowing Lama" signals that the teaching is not something to be practiced toward but the teaching itself. The word "very" indicates not comparative superiority but the essential nature of this teaching—nothing exceeds it because nothing can exceed the complete.

"Who would not practice this hearing-liberation?" is not a rhetorical question but a pointing to the obvious. The hearing is already liberation; to practice it would be adding recognition to recognition, practicing recognition as if recognition needed recognition. The question reveals that there is no one who would not practice because recognition is already complete.

༢༣

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza demonstrates non-abiding through the paradox of containment. "If one stanza of the teaching is heard" indicates that the teaching is not transmitted in fragments but encountered as unit. The hearing is not reception of information but recognition occurring; sound meets silence, silence meets sound.

"Conceptual dust is completely abandoned" points to the abandonment that is not a discrete act. The conceptual dust was never substantial; its apparent density was misperception of thought's own nature. Abandonment here is recognition, not elimination—seeing that dust was never other than clarity, never actually obscured what it seemed to veil.

"And samadhi of peace arises effortlessly in the mind" indicates not a state achieved or entered but natural condition recognized when conceptual overlay subsides. Peace (zhi ba) is not opposite of disturbance but recognition that disturbance itself has no substantial nature. The samadhi is not a meditative attainment but seeing of what never departed from stillness.

"What is there to examine about what else?" is not a question seeking alternative but pointing to the obvious. There is nothing to examine because the teaching itself is complete; to seek elsewhere would be seeking outside recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

༢༤

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza declares the inseparability of enumeration from the teaching itself. "The profound teaching of all vehicles' enumeration" indicates not that multiple systems exist separately but that recognition manifests through any teaching of the nine vehicles. Enumeration is not a list or classification but recognition appearing as multiplicity without division.

"In which whatever they enumerate" establishes that however recognition expresses itself, the recognition itself is singular. There is no conflict among vehicles, no contradiction between paths.

"Never does it depart from this excellent speech" signals the inexhaustibility of teaching. The speech is not spoken words that disappear but recognition that continues regardless of utterance. Excellent here is not comparative quality but recognition that recognizes itself as what is needed.

"It is a single excellent teaching without remainder" points to the completeness that cannot be divided—no part is incomplete, no segment is missing. The teaching itself is the enumeration; the enumeration displays the teaching.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

༢༥

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts the unconditioned availability of liberation. "From whomsoever they come" indicates that liberation does not require particular circumstances or conditions—recognition is not bound to any source.

"Whoever listens, obtains the fruit of liberation" shows that the obtaining is not an achievement but a recognition. The fruit is not a result of practice or maturation; obtaining occurs where there is no ear to receive, no practice to do, no time passing. Listening itself is liberation—the ear recognizes without recognizer, the fruit appears without producer.

"This is the secret treasure of all Victorious Ones' hearts" establishes that liberation is not a public possession but the heart-secret that resides in all Victorious Ones. The treasure is not hidden somewhere waiting to be discovered; it is available wherever recognition occurs. The heart is not a location but the very openness of Victorious Ones. Secret here does not mean concealment but unconditioned availability—no one blocks it, no one restricts it.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

"This teaching surpasses all other excellent teachings."
༢༦

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza defends the incomparability of the Lama's teaching. "This profound and vast teaching of All-Knowing Lama" indicates not that profundity comes from analysis but from vastness that contains profundity. The teaching is not composed of insights arranged but is recognition appearing as vast profundity—depth within breadth, profundity within vastness.

"Who would disparage—the speech of one who knows?" is not a challenge to find disparagers but a pointing to the impossibility of disparaging the knower. To disparage would require standing above the knower, but there is no above; the knower dissolves into knowing, the speech dissolves into speech, both are recognition itself.

"Thus speaks the All-Knowing Lama, heart of compassion" reveals that the teaching arises from compassion, not from instruction. The All-Knowing Lama speaks not as teacher instructing but as compassion itself vocalizing. The heart is not an organ that feels but the very center of compassion that radiates without radiating.

"This teaching surpasses all other excellent teachings" is not a comparative claim but recognition that all teachings are this teaching appearing as all, nothing existing outside. All other teachings are this teaching recognized; there is no other to surpass.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

And thoroughly sees reality.
༢༧

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the power of exposition. "Whatever teaching one explains" indicates that the act of teaching itself is elimination of obscurations, not presentation of something new. The teaching does not offer additional meaning; it removes what obscures.

"Eliminates the obscurations of the eighty-four thousand sections" points to the comprehensiveness of this elimination—obscurations that accumulated across eighty-four thousand dharmas are removed by understanding. The eighty-four thousand is not a limitation but an indication of the vast teaching's comprehensiveness. The sections are not obstacles but what was veiled.

"Therefore the mind becomes free from afflictions" shows that liberation occurs through the power of teaching, not through effort. Mind becoming free is not a progressive transformation but recognition of freedom already present. Afflictions are released without an act of releasing; they were never established as afflictions to be released.

"And thoroughly sees reality" indicates that seeing is not gradual but immediate. The thorough seeing is not a method of approaching but direct recognition. Reality is not gradually revealed but appears as what is always present.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza declares completion through containment. "This profound and vast teaching of All-Knowing Lama" we have seen—profound and vast indicating the teaching's nature that contains profundity and vastness.

"In the eight great treasuries is contained" signals that the treasury does not exist as something to be entered but as the teaching itself. The eight is not a count but the complete number; all seven treasuries are present within this teaching, nothing outside to be added.

"The essence of Vajra Essence displayed" indicates that the essence is not hidden behind the teaching but appears as the very teaching. Display occurs not through revelation of what was concealed but through recognition that the essence is the teaching. Vajra Essence is not a substance separate from teaching but the teaching appearing as essence.

"Therefore there is nothing else to seek" marks recognition as complete, not seeking as continuing. The completion is not a goal reached but a recognition that nothing remains outside recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the immediacy of liberation through hearing (thos grol). "If excellent teaching is heard, even if once" indicates that the effect does not depend upon repetition or accumulation. The single hearing suffices; liberation occurs without sequential buildup, without cumulative progress. The teaching is not a gradual training but recognition that appears as complete.

"Vasanas dissolve like cloud in sky" shows that obscurations disappear not through gradual dispersion but through recognition that they never had substance. Vasana here is not a veil to be removed but the appearance itself that seemed to obscure. The dissolution is cloud-like—form without form, dissolution without duration, vanishing without resistance.

"This is the All-Knowing Lama's teaching: liberation through hearing" establishes that hearing is the means of liberation. The hearing is not a step toward liberation but liberation itself. The teaching is not something to be practiced but recognition itself that liberates.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

This profound and vast teaching, which is beyond expression,

The All-Knowing Lama, having attained suchness, teaches,
This teaching—without equal, nowhere found.
༢༪

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the paradox of the inexpressible. "This profound and vast teaching, which is beyond expression" indicates not that the teaching cannot be captured by words but that it is expression itself—the teaching appears as the very articulation of what cannot be said. Profound and vast describe not attributes that exist beyond the teaching but the teaching's nature, which is inexpressible.

"Vasanas vanish like rainbow" shows that obscurations do not fade gradually but disappear as recognition occurs. Rainbow here is not a gradual light but instantaneous appearance without duration; the vanishing is not a process of thinning but recognition that reveals.

"The All-Knowing Lama, having attained suchness, teaches" establishes that the Lama's teaching does not come from analysis or composition but from the recognition that is suchness itself. Having attained suchness is not an achievement reached but the recognition of what always was.

"This teaching—without equal, nowhere found" signals the uniqueness of this teaching. Without equal means there is no comparison—nothing equivalent, nothing similar. Nowhere found means there is no location outside recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Beyond expression—teaching itself inexpressible.

Vasanas vanish like rainbow—instantaneous disappearance.

Is the All-Knowing Lama's heart-secret of Vajra—
What use does speech have, or hearing?
༢༫

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza points to the non-dual nature of teaching that transcends speech. "This teaching, without a word of speech, is the All-Knowing Lama's heart-secret of Vajra" establishes that the teaching does not require verbal transmission. The heart-secret is not spoken but recognized.

"What use does speech have, or hearing?" is not a rhetorical question about need but a pointing to the sufficiency of recognition itself. Speech has use only insofar as hearing occurs; hearing itself is the teaching. There is no function of speech beyond carrying teaching—speech does not add to teaching; it is teaching itself.

"Is the All-Knowing Lama's heart-secret of Vajra" indicates that the secret belongs not to the Lama as possession but to Vajra as the very nature that all Victorious Ones share. Vajra here is not a deity but the indestructible essence that is the heart of all Victorious Ones. Secret here is not concealment but the unconditioned availability of what is always present.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Teaching without word—no verbal transmission.

Through which the four powers accomplish.
༢༬

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza elaborates the four powers as modes of recognition. "The All-Knowing Lama's heart-secret, vast as space" establishes that the secret is not a location to be reached but the very expanse of recognition. Vast as space is not directional expansion but the non-localizable display that is always present everywhere yet nowhere.

"From which speech of four powers radiates—compassion, wisdom, method, and strength" points to the powers as not separate abilities but as the very speech of the teaching. Speech here is not a collection of utterances but the single utterance of the four powers. Compassion radiates, wisdom illuminates, method arranges, strength applies.

"Through which the four powers accomplish" shows that the powers act not as agents but as recognition itself. The four powers are not external to the teaching but the teaching's own capacities for liberation. They accomplish not through effort but through the natural function of what they are.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Clarifies the Vajra Essence directly.
༢༭

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza establishes self-knowing as the mode of recognition. "The All-Knowing Lama's heart-secret, which is self-knowing" indicates not that the secret is something known but the recognition itself—knowing that knows. Self-knowing is not a quality the Lama possesses but the nature of recognition itself.

"Recognizing what appears, without conceiving—" shows that recognition perceives appearance without conceptual mediation. What appears is recognized directly, not through the filter of concept. Conceiving here is not a mental act that adds a layer but the obstacle to direct seeing.

"The excellent teaching, of which this is the essence, clarifies the Vajra Essence directly" points to the identity of teaching and essence. The teaching is not separate from the essence; the essence is not a component of the teaching but the teaching itself appearing as essence. Clarification occurs not through explanation but through direct recognition—Vajra Essence clarifies what it is.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Heart-secret self-knowing—knowing that knows.

Recognizing what appears—direct recognition without conceiving.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts the reciprocal recognition through devotion. "Whoever sees the Lama's excellent speech" establishes that seeing is not exclusive to particular practitioners but open to recognition. The Lama's speech is not a text to be read by some but recognition that appears to whoever sees.

"Faith and devotion arise in that mind" indicates that devotion and faith are not sequential developments but simultaneous arisings. Faith does not cause devotion; devotion does not precede faith—both arise together from the recognition that is already present.

"Devotion causes faith to flourish" shows that faith is not produced by effort but is the natural blooming of recognition itself. The flourishing is not a process of growth but a revelation of what is always already complete.

"The Lama, by devotion, enters the heart" reveals that entry is not an invasion or penetration but recognition that welcomes what is already there. The heart is not a fortress to be breached but the very openness of Victorious Ones.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza grounds the teaching in the capacity to generate faith and ripen merit. "Those with fortune and merit, looking upon this" establishes that encountering the teaching requires fortune (skal ba) and accumulated benefit (bsod naMs). The looking is not a casual glance but the gazing that recognizes the teaching's value.

"The excellent teaching causes faith to arise" shows that the teaching does not create faith through persuasion but through recognition of what is already present. Faith here is not belief in something absent but recognition of what is already evident.

"The field of merit ripens, becomes the path" indicates that merit is not static accumulation but dynamic maturation. Ripening is not a process that requires time but a transformation of quality. The field becomes not a different location but the very ground of the path—merit ripens where it is, the path emerges where merit is.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza grounds ekayana—the single vehicle—as teaching itself, not a sequence of steps. Hearing a single word is not a fragment but complete teaching appearing as a unit.

The line about all Victorious One's dharmas held, read, and accomplished collapses distinctions among engagement modes. Hearing, holding, reading, and accomplishing are not ordered stages; each is complete in itself and contains others.

Applied practice here is not striving toward a goal; application is recognition that there is nothing to achieve, nowhere to go, no one to apply. The effort is effortless nature of what is already complete.

The equality of capacity and ripening reveals non-duality of cause and result: neither precedes the other; both arise from the same recognition that there were never two to compare.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Single word—completeness, not fragment.

This scripture—separate from hearing.

All dharmas—one, not many.

Held, read, accomplished—each complete in itself.

Applying oneself—effortless nature.

Capacity—not potential, not aptitude.

Ripening—not maturation, not fruition.

Equal—neither same nor different.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the paradox of inexpressibility. "Whatever one thinks" indicates that conceptual understanding does not reach where recognition is. The teaching does not go beyond expression because it is expression itself—what cannot be expressed directly appears as the teaching itself.

"Because the excellent teaching is the teaching itself" establishes that there is no separation between teaching and speech. Speech is not about teaching; speech is teaching. The excellent teaching that is the teaching cannot be exceeded because there is nothing outside it.

"There is no limit to this unbounded speech" signals the infinite nature of the teaching. The teaching is not finite; it does not have boundaries, does not diminish, does not exhaust. Unbounded indicates not quantity that can be counted but capacity that cannot be contained.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts the immediacy of liberation through encounter. "Even meeting for a moment with the Lama's speech" indicates that a single encounter suffices for liberation, not prolonged interaction. The meeting is momentary not because it is brief but because recognition occurs instantly outside time.

"Faith and devotion arise in that mind" points to the simultaneity of arisings. Faith and devotion do not develop sequentially but arise together from the recognition that is already present. Devotion does not cause faith; faith arises where devotion already is.

"With such excellent teaching, what use is there for other teachings?" is not a dismissal but a question about relevance. The teaching being such does not make other teachings obsolete; all teachings are this teaching recognized. To ask what use it has is to point to the sufficiency of this teaching—itself serves all purposes.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza dissolves dualistic thinking through deathless recognition. "Whenever with faith a mind of devotion arises" indicates that devotion is not caused by will or circumstance but is natural response to recognition of what is.

"Whatever obscuration and afflictions arise" points to the spontaneous nature of what appears—obscuration does not come from external cause, neither does affliction arise from external agent. Both are manifestations of recognition itself, never separate from recognition, never caused by something else.

"The excellent teaching liberates through hearing" establishes that liberation is not achieved through practice but through hearing—thos grol. The deathless vehicle is not a vehicle that ends existence but recognizes that existence itself is deathless, ending where no ending was needed.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

This stanza enacts liberation through touching as immediate recognition, not a disciplined ascent. "Whoever encounters, through which obscuration and afflictions arise" indicates that liberation does not require climbing toward a summit but recognizes spontaneously.

"The excellent teaching liberates through touching" establishes that touching itself is not a method of purification but direct recognition of what is never separate—contact is recognition, sensation is liberation, there is no interval.

The deathless vehicle is not a vehicle you travel to but recognition that travel itself is revelation of a limitless base. Deathlessness is not a cessation but a recognition that what never had a beginning—recognizing deathless nature as what never had beginning.

This stanza dissolves dualistic thinking through longing recognition. "Whenever longing mind's devotion is born" indicates that devotion is not caused by will or circumstance but is natural arising of recognition of what is.

"Whatever is heard, whether through listening or recollection" points to the non-causal nature of what arrives. The hearing is not an act directed by a listener; it is recognition occurring without agent. Recollection is not a retrieval of memory; it is recognition of what never left.

"All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching arises" establishes that liberation does not require instruction or transmission. The teaching appears without teacher; instruction transmits without instructor; recognition occurs spontaneously when the mind is ready.

This stanza declares availability of teaching in all four directions and all times. "In four directions, at whatever time, the All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching is taught" indicates that teaching appears regardless of when or where—teaching occurs not at a particular hour in a particular place but unfolds as availability.

"Why do learned ones not understand this?" is not a condemnation of those who misunderstand but a question about what prevents recognition. The teaching is not difficult; the understanding is not exclusive to some. To understand this teaching is not to grasp something but to recognize that teaching itself recognizes whoever encounters it.

"Learned ones not understanding this" establishes that learning and comprehension are not sequential achievements but simultaneous recognition. What is learned is not accumulated gradually but understood all at once. Understanding here is not a step toward enlightenment but recognition of what is already complete.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

This is the All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching: three wisdoms merging into one.
༢༨

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-duality of three wisdoms. "The excellent teaching, through which all Victorious Ones' hearts become free" indicates that liberation occurs not through separation but through merging—compassion, wisdom, and method merge into recognition of three as one.

"Compassion, wisdom, and method" are not separate agents acting in concert but aspects of recognition. Compassion does not feel for others; wisdom does not analyze distinctively; method does not apply technique; all three are one recognition, not three different recognitions.

The three wisdoms merge as one: this indicates that wisdom, compassion, and method are not three modes of recognition but three aspects of one recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Compassion, wisdom, method—three wisdoms merging.

No separate agents—recognition as one.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza declares that the teaching is not lost but remains available through recognition. "Whatever teaching one remembers" indicates that the teaching does not depend on memory or forgetting. The teaching is not archived in the past but present wherever recognition occurs.

"All-Knowing Lama, possessing complete liberation" establishes that the Lama's liberation is not an achievement but the recognition of freedom itself. Possessing here is not owning or having; the Lama is not separate from liberation.

"Shows the profound path through explanation" points to the clarity that comes not from elaboration or gradual exposition but from direct pointing. The path is not gradually revealed but shown directly. The teaching is not a complex system to be understood but immediate presence.

"Therefore the field of merit expands" signals that merit is not static but dynamic. The field is not a fixed location but expands wherever recognition occurs. The expansion is not quantitative growth but the radiating generosity of recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Whatever teaching remembered—teaching remains available.

All-Knowing Lama possessing liberation—freedom itself recognized.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts confidence through recognition. "Having confidence in the profound teaching" establishes that confidence is not an emotional state but a recognition that the teaching deserves confidence. The profound teaching is not something to be approached with hesitation but what invites certainty.

"Whatever the mind thinks, that it recognizes" shows that recognition occurs not through conceptualization but through direct knowing. Whatever the mind thinks is not an opinion but recognition itself.

"With excellent teaching of All-Knowing Lama—therefore one will not have fear" points to the complete teaching as sufficient protection. Fear here is not about future uncertainty but about not recognizing what is already present. The excellent teaching is All-Knowing Lama's teaching; to recognize it is to have recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

This stanza resolves doubt through manifestation. "Whatever the mind's thought becomes" indicates that thoughts are not fixed states but transformable. The mind's thought becomes—not the mind changes its nature but the mind recognizes transformation as already its nature.

"All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching manifests" shows that the teaching does not appear through gradual unfolding but through direct presence. The teaching manifests; no process of appearance is required because recognition is always manifesting.

"Therefore the excellent teaching eliminates doubt" establishes that doubt is not removed through argument but through recognition. Elimination occurs not through reasoning but through seeing the teaching. When the teaching manifests, doubt cannot stand.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts the dissolution of obstacles through devotion. "By faith and devotion, all three poisons dissolved" establishes that the three poisons are not separate struggles or sequential victories but disappear together through devotion. The poisons—attachment, aversion, ignorance—are not isolated afflictions but interconnected tendencies.

"And all obstacles vanished" points to the completeness of the teaching's power. The obstacles dissolve not piecemeal but holistically; all hindrances are removed by the teaching.

"By this teaching, one obtains the supreme good" shows that the teaching is not a means to an end but the supreme good itself. Obtaining is not acquiring something external but recognizing what is already present. The supreme good is not a destination but the very nature of recognition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

This stanza establishes availability of teaching in all four directions and all times. In four directions, at whatever time, All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching is taught.

Availability is not about distribution or location. Teaching occurs wherever recognition happens, not bounded to particular direction or particular time.

"Why do learned ones not understand this?" points to characteristic of non-locality: teaching appears without limitation, without boundaries, in all directions simultaneously.

This stanza dissolves affliction through recognition. When four passions blaze in one's mind—passion does not cause separation, flaming does not burn what never was fire. The mind does not become disturbed; awareness recognizes what appears as passion itself without being affected.

"Excellent teaching of All-Knowing Lama—this alone dissolves them" establishes that teaching liberates through direct recognition without method. The teaching is not a technique to be learned but recognition that already liberates.

Passions dissolve—not purified, not transformed, but seen through. Flaming itself—passion that appeared was never fire. Passion—recognized as itself, never as something else.

This teaching—liberates without method, no technique needed.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza addresses spontaneous arising through looking. "However, when looking at this excellent teaching" indicates that observation occurs not as criticism or examination but as recognition of what is always present.

"Whatever faith one has" establishes that faith is not an accumulation or possession. Faith here is not ownership but natural response to recognition. Faith is not directed toward an object; it is natural arising.

"Dharma-nature spontaneously arises" shows that dharma appears not through cultivation but through natural condition. Dharma-nature is not a condition achieved but the nature itself appearing. Wisdom here is not a special state but dharma-nature of recognition that recognizes what is always present as suchness.

"In whichever mind, wisdom arises" points to non-separation of mind and wisdom. The relationship is not a composite of distinct elements but recognition that perceives as inseparable. Wherever mind recognizes wisdom, wisdom is there—no one recognizes without the other, no other appears.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

།

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza dissolves affliction through recognition of movement. "When the thought waves of affliction rock" is not a temporal description but points to the characteristic that affliction is never a process but a manifestation of what is already present. The rocking (rnam rtog) is not a sequence of states but the gesture itself is recognition that has always been stirring.

"And this excellent teaching is looked upon" establishes that the looking is not a casual glance but a recognition of what is already present as appearance. The excellence here is not a quality of the teaching but recognition of what is always available. Looking dissolves into recognition; the excellence seen is recognition itself.

"Afflictions and obscurations are spontaneously released" indicates that the release is not an act but a recognition of what is already free. Afflictions (nyon mongs) were never solid; they appeared to possess solidity that was never established as affliction. The release (shugs) is not an external force but a natural state itself, which has always been free of affliction. There is no one who releases, nothing released, and no act of releasing—only recognition that obscurations were never anything other than clarity they seemed to obscure.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Thought waves of affliction—rocking, not sequencing.

Afflictions released—recognition occurs.

When affliction, ignorance, and grasping arise in mind's three poisons,
This excellent teaching is looked upon—
These three poisons are immediately destroyed.
༢༩

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza dissolves affliction through recognition. The three poisons—affliction, ignorance, grasping—are not separate states that arise and then are destroyed. They are manifestations of non-abiding appearing as toxins, yet recognition reveals their poison as non-substantial.

Affliction is not something accumulated or built up; it appears as manifestation of obscuration. Ignorance is not an absence of knowledge but obscuration of what already is recognition. Grasping is not a holding of objects but attachment to what is never grasped.

Grasping is not a process of clinging; it is manifestation of the same recognition that makes grasping appear possible, yet recognition reveals grasping as non-substantial.

These three poisons are immediately destroyed—destroyed through recognition, not through time or gradual purification. Destruction is not removal of something that was never established; it is revelation that poisons never existed as entities to be removed.

This excellent teaching—looked upon—demonstrates that obscuration and grasping are not obstacles but manifestations of recognition. When teaching is looked upon, afflictions and grasping are recognized for what they are: non-substantial appearances of non-abiding nature. The teaching itself is recognition; looking dissolves the apparent problem into recognition of non-abiding reality.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Affliction—not accumulated, not built, not process.

Ignorance—not absent, not hidden, not obscured.
