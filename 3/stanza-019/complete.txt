## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Therefore, hearing a single word of this scripture,
And all the Victorious One's dharmas held, read, and accomplished,
Applying oneself to hearing, holding, reading, and accomplishing,
The capacity and the ripening of merit are equal.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza grounds ekayAna—the single vehicle—as the teaching itself, not a sequence of steps. Hearing a single word is not a fragment but the complete teaching appearing as a unit, the ocean visible as a drop.

The line about all the Victorious One's dharmas held, read, and accomplished collapses distinctions among engagement modes. Hearing, holding, reading, and accomplishing are not ordered stages; each is complete in itself and contains the others.

Applied practice here is not striving toward a goal; the application is recognition that there is nothing to achieve, nowhere to go, no one to apply. The effort is the effortless nature of what is already complete.

The equality of capacity and ripening reveals the non-duality of cause and result: neither precedes the other; both arise from the same recognition that there were never two to compare.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Single word—completeness, not fragment, not abbreviation, the essence.
00002| This scripture—not separate from the hearing, not the object of hearing.
00003| All dharmas—not many, not one, not a collection.
00004| Held, read, accomplished—not sequential, not equivalent, not merged.
00005| Applying oneself—not effort, not discipline, not practice.
00006| Capacity—not potential, not aptitude, not readiness.
00007| Ripening—not maturation, not development, not fruition.
00008| Equal—not the same, not different, not comparable.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

therefore scripture this-of word single hear and
hold read accomplish all as-many-as victorious-one's dharma
hear and hold read accomplish in apply and
capacity equal and merit ripening equal
