## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza grounds ekayAna—the single vehicle—as the teaching itself, not a sequence of steps. Hearing a single word is not a fragment but the complete teaching appearing as a unit, the ocean visible as a drop.

The line about all the Victorious One's dharmas held, read, and accomplished collapses distinctions among engagement modes. Hearing, holding, reading, and accomplishing are not ordered stages; each is complete in itself and contains the others.

Applied practice here is not striving toward a goal; the application is recognition that there is nothing to achieve, nowhere to go, no one to apply. The effort is the effortless nature of what is already complete.

The equality of capacity and ripening reveals the non-duality of cause and result: neither precedes the other; both arise from the same recognition that there were never two to compare.
