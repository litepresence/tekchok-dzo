## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza moves the conversation from the polemic of pride and doubt to the balance of non-abiding through nondual equality. The Lakṣaṇa highlights that pride, doubt, and grasping-grasped arise within a framework that is dissolved by equality—there is no separate ground for either side to stand on.
