## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Blessed by the power of liberation and concentration,
Seeing this, reality arises forcefully in the mind.
Able to show the primordially pure intention immediately—
There is nothing like this for destroying grasping at phenomena.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the dissolution of power and its effects. "Blessed by the power of liberation and concentration"—blessing not as transfer, power not as capacity, liberation not as release, concentration not as state. "Seeing this, reality arises forcefully in the mind"—seeing not as perception, arising not as emergence, force not as violence, mind not as container. "Able to show the primordially pure intention immediately"—ability not as skill, showing not as display, primordial purity not as state, immediacy not as directness, intention not as purpose. "There is nothing like this for destroying grasping at phenomena"—nothing-like not as uniqueness, destroying not as annihilation, grasping not as holding, phenomena not as objects. The lakṣaṇa: power that empowers without power, seeing that sees without seer, arising that arises without arising, destroying that destroys without destruction. Primordial purity not as before defilement but appearing that appears as neither pure nor impure, without before, without after.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Blessed power—not transfer, not infusion, but blessing that is power, power that is blessing.

Liberation concentration—not release, not stability, but concentration that is liberation, liberation that is concentration.

Seeing this—not perception, not observation, but seeing that is this, this that is seeing.

Reality arising—not emergence, not appearance, but arising that is reality, reality that is arising.

Forcefully in mind—not violence, not location, but force that is mind, mind that is force.

Primordial purity—not before, not original, but purity that is primordial, intention that is showing.

Immediate showing—not directness, not absence, but immediate that is showing, able that is primordial.

Destroying grasping—not annihilation, not removal, but destroying that is grasping, phenomena that is destruction.

Nothing like—not uniqueness, not superiority, but nothing that is like, like that is nothing.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Liberation concentration power-by blessed
This see mind in reality force-by arise
Primordial-pure intention immediate-to show able and
Phenomena possessing grasp destroy to this like not
