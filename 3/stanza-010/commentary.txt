## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the dissolution of power and its effects. "Blessed by the power of liberation and concentration"—blessing not as transfer, power not as capacity, liberation not as release, concentration not as state. "Seeing this, reality arises forcefully in the mind"—seeing not as perception, arising not as emergence, force not as violence, mind not as container. "Able to show the primordially pure intention immediately"—ability not as skill, showing not as display, primordial purity not as state, immediacy not as directness, intention not as purpose. "There is nothing like this for destroying grasping at phenomena"—nothing-like not as uniqueness, destroying not as annihilation, grasping not as holding, phenomena not as objects. The lakṣaṇa: power that empowers without power, seeing that sees without seer, arising that arises without arising, destroying that destroys without destruction. Primordial purity not as before defilement but appearing that appears as neither pure nor impure, without before, without after.
