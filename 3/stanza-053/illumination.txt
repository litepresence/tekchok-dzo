## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Agitation—not excitement, not restlessness, but the mind's resistance to what is always already still.

Dullness—not torpor, not lethargy, but the obscuration of what is always already luminous.

Obstacles—not hindrances, not blocks, but the apparent barriers that were never separating anything.

Meditation—not practice, not cultivation, but the recognition that there was never anything to practice, nothing to cultivate.

Peaceful samadhi—not concentration, not absorption, but the natural state that never knew disturbance.

Without defects—not perfect, not flawless, but the recognition that there was never anything to perfect, nothing to improve.

Essential pith instructions—not secrets, not hidden teachings, but the direct pointing to what was never hidden, never separate.
