## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through essential pith instructions. "When obstacles of agitation and dullness arise in meditation" indicates the condition of meditative existence as obstacle. Agitation (rgod pa) is not excitement but the mind's resistance to what is always already still. Dullness (rmugs pa) is not torpor but the obscuration of what is always already luminous. Obstacles (gegs) are not hindrances but apparent barriers that were never separating anything. Meditation (sgom) is not practice but the recognition that there was never anything to practice. The characteristic is this non-obstacle obstacle: not that there are barriers to overcome, but that the barriers are themselves the open ground unrecognized.

"Please look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the obstacles to what is already unobstructed. The imperative is not an escape from agitation and dullness but the recognition that these are themselves the clarity and luminosity, obscured only in appearance. These excellent scriptures are not better techniques but the pith instructions that reveal there was never any obstacle. The characteristic is this non-instruction instruction: not receiving teachings, not learning methods, but direct recognition that there was never anything to learn, never any method needed.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the essential pith instructions" indicates non-abiding as essential pointing. Essential (gnad) is not important but the very heart of what is, never apart from the recognition. Pith instructions (man ngag) are not secrets but the direct pointing to what was never hidden. The characteristic is this non-pointing pointing: not that something is indicated, but that the indicated is recognized as never having been elsewhere.

"That excellently produces the peaceful samadhi without defects" indicates the function of wisdom as natural meditative equipoise. Peaceful samadhi (zhi ba'i ting 'dzin) is not concentration but the natural state that never knew disturbance. Without defects (skyon med) is not perfect but the recognition that there was never anything to perfect. The characteristic is this non-producing production: not cultivation of qualities, not development of states, but the recognition that there was never any lack, never anything that needed to be produced.

The lakṣaṇa is this: agitation and peace, dullness and luminosity, obstacles and openness—not sequential stages in a meditative process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which obstacles could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior instruction but the pointer to what was never in need of instruction, never separate from the peace that was always already present.
