# EDITORIAL CONVENTIONS

This translation presents the root text through four complementary registers, each serving a distinct contemplative and scholarly function. The methodology honors classical Tibetan translation theory (*'gyur gyi bstan bcos*) while adapting to English's prosodic and philosophical constraints. Readers may engage any register independently or move sequentially from poetic embodiment to direct recognition, concluding with philological foundation.

## ITERATIVE REFINEMENT PROCESS

This translation undergoes an iterative refinement loop where it passes between multiple AI models until the difference between iterations becomes negligible. Each model must:

1. **Honor these conventions absolutely** - no deviations allowed
2. **Review previous iterations** for emerging patterns and eliminate them before producing new work
3. **Prioritize human mastery over algorithmic consistency** - structural variety is mandatory
4. **Check against prohibited language lists** before finalizing any text
5. **Verify Dzogchen transmission quality** - syntax must carry meaning without naming

The final product must read as if composed by a human master of Longchenpa lineage, not as AI-generated commentary.

## WORKING METHOD: TRAINING APPROACH

**Critical:** Do not attempt to transform all 67 stanzas at once following these conventions.

1. **Train with Small Batches First**
   - Take 5-7 stanzas at a time
   - Apply conventions rigorously
   - Review against quality checklist
   - Refine until natural rhythm emerges
   - Only when the rhythm of working within these conventions becomes natural, proceed to larger batches

2. **Keep the Root Text as Final Authority**
   - The conventions guide **HOW** to phrase, but the root text determines **WHAT** to phrase
   - When there is any question about how to phrase something, return to the Tibetan
   - Never sacrifice accuracy of source to follow convention

3. **Words Either Liberate or They Do Not**
   - Keep this always before mind
   - Every phrase, every sentence—does it liberate?
   - If it merely explains, it has failed its purpose
   - If it liberates, it has succeeded regardless of whether it follows every rule perfectly

4. **Trust the View Over the Form**
   - This is the most important advice
   - Let the Dzogchen view be primary, conventions be servant to the view, not master
   - When the writer's mind rests in the recognition of non-abiding, the language will naturally carry that recognition
   - When the writer is thinking primarily about following rules and avoiding patterns, the language will feel constrained
   - Let the view be primary; conventions support authentic transmission rather than constrain it

## PROHIBITED LANGUAGE: ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

The following forms are FORBIDDEN in all registers (liturgical is exempt where necessary for poetic meter, but see liturgical register caution below):

### 1. Binary Scaffold "Not X But Y"

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "not dissolution but recognition"
- "not purification but unstainedness"
- "not two, not one"
- "not this but that"

**ACCEPTABLE APPROACHES (must vary organically, not mechanically cycle):**
- Single negation: "dissolving—recognition" or "recognition itself dissolving"
- Positive assertion without opposition: "Recognition's own gesture"
- Collapse through syntax: "Recognizing recognizes nothing other than itself"
- Direct statement: "Recognition's gesture: dissolving"
- Question form: "Dissolving? Recognition already dissolves"
- Fragment: "Recognition. Dissolving. Same."

**CRITICAL WARNING:**
The prohibition itself must not become a new pattern. If every stanza avoids "not X but Y" by using "X—Y" instead, then the dash pattern becomes equally mechanical as the original. The writer must feel each stanza's unique gesture and let the appropriate approach emerge organically from that gesture. Do not simply cycle through acceptable approaches A-F in rotation. Variation must respond to what each stanza actually does.

### 2. Positional Language

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "ground" (as in "ground that was never established")
- "base" (as in "base for reception")
- "beyond" (as in "beyond obscuration")
- "beneath" (as in "beneath clouds")
- "above" (as in "above duality")

**ACCEPTABLE APPROACHES:**
- Delete prepositions entirely: "never established" instead of "ground never established"
- Use metaphor without positioning: "sky—never receiving"
- Collapse into statelessness: "establishment never occurred"
- Indicate through recognition: "recognizing establishes nothing"

### 3. Temporal Markers

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "always already" (as in "always already present")
- "never departed" (as in "never departed from")
- "since beginningless time" (as explanatory phrase)
- "ultimately" (as in "ultimately beyond")
- "simultaneously" (as architectural term)

**ACCEPTABLE APPROACHES:**
- Present tense immediacy: "present—always"
- Collapse temporality: "present" alone
- Remove temporal qualifier: "present" not "always already present"
- Use aspect without positioning: "undeparted" as adjective state

### 4. Transitional Filler

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "it is worth noting"
- "most importantly"
- "as we see"
- "in this context"
- "from this perspective"

**ACCEPTABLE APPROACHES:**
- Direct statement without introduction
- Colon or dash for continuity
- Sentence fragment for immediacy
- No transition at all

### 5. Quality Adjectives (Naming vs. Showing)

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "profound" (as descriptor)
- "direct" (as descriptor)
- "immediate" (as descriptor)
- "essential" (as descriptor)
- "supreme" (as descriptor)

**ACCEPTABLE APPROACHES:**
- Show quality through phrasing: instead of "profound teaching," write "teaching that reaches"
- Let syntax carry meaning: instead of "direct recognition," write "recognizing—recognizes nothing else"
- Collapse into action: instead of "immediate showing," write "showing—no interval"

### 6. Audience Addressing

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "the practitioner"
- "the scholar"
- "the student"
- "the reader"
- "you" (as direct address in commentary/illumination)

**ACCEPTABLE APPROACHES:**
- Write as text writes: without audience, without instruction
- Universalize: "one who recognizes" or "recognizing itself"
- Collapse subject: recognition happens without practitioner

### 7. Repetitive Structural Patterns

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Same opening formula for every stanza (e.g., "This stanza enacts non-abiding through...")
- Same sentence length throughout (must vary 40% from mean)
- Same paragraph structure (3 sentences consistently)
- Same illumination format (line-by-line "not X, not Y" repetition)

**ACCEPTABLE APPROACHES:**
- Vary openings: direct statement, question, fragment, imperative, metaphor
- Vary sentence length: 3-35 word range across each register
- Vary paragraph structure: 1-6 sentences per paragraph, some single-sentence
- Vary illumination: single-word recognition, longer prose, fragments with gaps

**CRITICAL WARNING: NATURAL VS MECHANICAL VARIATION**
The requirement for structural variety is excellent in principle, but variation must emerge organically from attending to each stanza's unique gesture. If the writer simply cycles through opening formulas A-G in rotation or varies sentence length by formula rather than by responding to content, this will also read as mechanical. The writer must feel each stanza's characteristic and let the opening, structure, and rhythm emerge organically from that characteristic. Natural human variation arises from the text itself, not from imposed algorithms.

## REGISTER-SPECIFIC CONVENTIONS

### 1. LITURGICAL RENDERING (*mchod brjod tshig*; Skt. *stotra-pada*)

English verse composed for contemplative recitation. Iambic pentameter provides a metrical spine (five iambus positions per line), with syllable count varying between nine and twelve to accommodate philosophical compounds without distorting lexical stress. Trochaic inversion occurs solely at doctrinal pivots; spondaic clusters mark karmic density. Caesura placement shifts systematically across stanzas to mirror Tibetan syntactic architecture. End-rhyme is deliberately absent; consonance on line-final consonants creates subtle sonic cohesion. All typographical em-dashes have been replaced with standard double quotes to maintain rhythmic continuity and honor printing conventions.

**Purpose:** Text as recited embodiment.

**Requirements:**
- Maintain recitative flow despite philosophical precision
- Avoid prohibited language where possible (see caution below)
- Vary rhythm and caesura across stanzas
- Let devotion arise from syntax, not from devotional vocabulary

**CAUTION ON EXEMPTIONS:**
Liturgical has minor exemptions for poetic meter, but be cautious. If too many exemptions are made, the liturgical becomes the place where all prohibited patterns hide. The liturgical must still strive to follow the Dzogchen transmission view, even within meter constraints. Sometimes a line can be recast to avoid a prohibited form while preserving meaning. Do not use meter as excuse for mechanical patterns.

### 2. COMMENTARY (*'grel pa don 'grel*; Skt. *lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa*)

Non-phenomenological indication of the text's characteristic (*lakṣaṇa*) of non-abiding. The commentary points to what the text indicates—not how it functions or what it constitutes.

**CRITICAL PROHIBITION:** The commentary MUST NOT follow a repetitive pattern such as:
- "This stanza enacts non-abiding through [X]"
- Followed by: "The [term] is not [definition], not [definition]"
- Followed by: "The characteristic is this: [explanation]"

This pattern appeared in previous iterations and is FORBIDDEN. Instead, the commentary must:

**VARY OPENING FORMULAS** (minimum 7 distinct patterns across 67 stanzas, emerging organically):
- Direct statement: "Praise without praiser—praising itself"
- Imperative: "Recognize: bowing bows to no one"
- Question: "What liberates? Seeing that sees"
- Metaphor: "Rain through sky—no wetting"
- Condition: "When attachment arises—already free"
- Fragment: "Ignorance—cloud. Luminosity—sun."
- Negative assertion: "No ground established. No knower found."

**VARY SENTENCE STRUCTURE** (3-35 words per sentence, 40% variance, emerging organically):
- Some single-sentence paragraphs
- Some longer multi-sentence paragraphs
- Mix of short, medium, long sentences within each stanza

**ELIMINATE ALL PROHIBITED LANGUAGE:**
- No "not X but Y" binary scaffold
- No positional language ("ground," "base," "beyond")
- No temporal markers ("always already," "never departed")
- No transitional filler
- No quality adjectives (show, don't name)
- No audience addressing

**METAPHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Indicate non-abiding without locating it
- Do not add what the root text omits
- Let syntax collapse subject-object architecture
- Avoid reification of any term
- Work within Dzogchen transmission view without naming rigpa or transmission

**Purpose:** Text's gesture made explicit without reification.

### 3. ILLUMINATION (*ngo sprod*; Skt. *svarūpa-prakāśa*)

Direct introduction to the recognition the text itself performs. Each phrase mirrors the root text's imperative voice without adding instructions absent from the source. Subject-object architecture collapses through minimal phrasing.

**CRITICAL PROHIBITION:** The illumination MUST NOT follow the line-by-line pattern:
- "[Term]—not [X], not [Y], but [Z]"
- Repeated for every line of verse

This pattern appeared in previous iterations and is FORBIDDEN. Instead, the illumination must:

**USE THREE APPROACHES** (not just line-by-line, varying organically):
1. Single-word or short-phrase recognition: "Vajrasattva—unstruck"
2. Longer prose sentences that collapse multiple terms: "Bowing—bowing itself, no one to bow, no receiving"
3. Fragments that leave gaps for reader: "Ignorance—cloud. Luminosity—sun. Neither."

**VARY STRUCTURE ACROSS STANZAS** (emerging organically, not by formula):
- Some stanzas: single-word illuminations
- Some stanzas: longer prose paragraphs
- Some stanzas: fragmentary lists with gaps
- Avoid uniform line-by-line format

**ELIMINATE ALL PROHIBITED LANGUAGE:**
- No "not X but Y" binary scaffold (especially critical here)
- No positional language
- No temporal markers
- No transitional filler
- No quality adjectives
- No audience addressing

**IMPERATIVE FORCE:**
- Arise from syntactic immediacy, not from exhortation
- "Vajrasattva unstruck" not as description but as the unstruck itself sounding
- Let the phrase itself be the introduction, not a description pointing to it

**Purpose:** Text as self-revealing presence.

### 4. LITERAL TRANSLATION (*'gyur don bsgyur*; Skt. *artha-anuvāda*)

A morpheme-by-morpheme rendering preserving Tibetan syntactic architecture, presented in tripartite format per verse:

```
[Original Tibetan Unicode]
[Extended Wylie transliteration]
[Literal translation with hyphenated stacking]
```

Each lexical unit appears with its core semantic value; grammatical particles translate to functional equivalents (*la* → "to," *kyis* → "by") without meta-linguistic annotation. Tibetan's right-branching morphology manifests through hyphenated compounding (*gzhon-nur* → "youthful-become"). English word order remains deliberately non-idiomatic to maintain the source text's *dgongs pa* (intentional architecture). Sanskrit loanwords appear in standard romanization without case/number diacritics. A blank line separates each verse triad.

**TIBETAN TERM PRECISION (Dzogchen Alignment):**

| Term | Conventional | Preferred Here | Rationale |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| `kun gzhi` | ālaya | all-ground (contextual) or universal-basis | Must convey ground/baselessness of Longchenpa's view |
| `rig pa` | awareness | self-knowing or vidyā | Must indicate rigpa's self-cognizing nature |
| `dag pa` | pure | unstained | Avoids purification process implication |
| `chos nyid` | dharma-nature | suchness or thusness | Avoids reification |
| `snying po` | essence | heart-essence | Captures nying (heart/essence) nuance |
| `rtogs pa` | realization | recognition | Indicates recognizing what was never unrecognized |
| `dgongs pa` | intention/mind | realization itself | Avoids reification of mind as separate entity |

**Purpose:** Text as Tibetan grammar constructs it.

---

## STRUCTURAL VARIETY REQUIREMENTS

### Stanza Grouping (67 stanzas → 7 approaches)

Stanzas must be grouped and approached differently to avoid repetitive patterns:

**Group A (1-10): Praise & Homage**
- Approach: Collapse subject-object architecture immediately
- Opening: Direct statement, no preamble
- Structure: Single-sentence or fragment-heavy

**Group B (11-20): Transmission & Liberation**
- Approach: Imperative force from syntactic immediacy
- Opening: Direct imperative or question
- Structure: Mix of imperatives and conditions

**Group C (21-30): Vāsanās & Obscuration**
- Approach: Varied negation, sometimes positive assertion
- Opening: Metaphor without explanation
- Structure: Medium-length sentences, some collapse

**Group D (31-40): Dharma Display**
- Approach: Longer prose, no line-by-line breakdown
- Opening: Statement then elaboration
- Structure: Multi-sentence paragraphs

**Group E (41-50): Obstacles & Solutions**
- Approach: Fragmentary, leave gaps for reader
- Opening: Single word or phrase
- Structure: Fragmentary lists, gaps

**Group F (51-60): Practice & Experience**
- Approach: Mix of imperatives and fragments
- Opening: Condition then recognition
- Structure: Varied sentence lengths

**Group G (61-67): Aspiration & Conclusion**
- Approach: Celebratory, without closure
- Opening: Direct wish or statement
- Structure: Short, direct statements

**CRITICAL REMINDER:**
These groupings are APPROACH GUIDELINES, not mechanical formulas. The writer must feel each stanza's unique gesture and let the structure emerge organically. A stanza in Group A might still use a fragment if that best serves its characteristic. A stanza in Group G might use a question if that best serves its gesture. The groupings provide general orientation, not rigid rules.

### Sentence Length Metrics

**Commentary:** 3-35 words per sentence, 40% variance from mean per stanza
**Illumination:** 1-20 words per line/phrase, significant variation across stanzas
**Paragraph structure:** 1-6 sentences per paragraph, not consistently 3-4

---

## DZOGCHEN TRANSMISSION VIEW IN LANGUAGE

**Core Principle:** Let syntax carry meaning—allow phrases to collapse subject-object architecture without announcing the collapse.

**Prohibited Naming:**
- Do not name "rigpa" directly (use "self-knowing," "recognition," or let syntax show it)
- Do not name "Dzogchen" directly (let the view be evident in the approach)
- Do not name "transmission" directly (let the introduction happen through language)

**HIGH LINGUISTIC SKILL REQUIRED:**
When you forbid naming these terms, there is a subtle danger: the language can become abstract and floating without anchor in the view it is meant to transmit. The solution—"syntax carries meaning"—is correct but this requires very high linguistic skill. The writer must ensure that even without naming these terms, the view is unmistakably present. This is the most difficult aspect of these conventions.

The view must be present in:
- The way phrases collapse
- The way sentences are structured
- The choice of which approach is used
- The rhythm and cadence
- The absence of what is not said

The reader should recognize Dzogchen transmission from the syntax itself, not from named concepts.

**Syntax as Transmission:**
- Instead of "the transmission requires no mediator," write: "Recognizing—recognizes nothing else"
- Instead of "rigpa's self-recognition," write: "Self-knowing—knowing itself"
- Instead of "beyond subject and object," write: "Neither subject nor object—knowing knows"

**Metaphysical Alignment:**
- Non-abiding as characteristic, not state
- Luminosity not despite obscuration, but because obscuration never arose as obscuration
- Non-arising of veiling, not removal of veil
- Ungovernedness that never stood as subject to governance

## QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKLIST

Before finalizing any text, verify:

**Language Prohibitions:**
- [ ] No "not X but Y" binary scaffold
- [ ] No positional language ("ground," "base," "beyond")
- [ ] No temporal markers ("always already," "never departed")
- [ ] No transitional filler ("it is worth noting," etc.)
- [ ] No quality naming ("profound," "direct")—shown in phrasing
- [ ] No audience addressing ("the practitioner," etc.)

**Structural Variety:**
- [ ] Sentence length variance: 40% range from mean
- [ ] Commentary openings: 7+ distinct patterns across stanzas (not cycling formula)
- [ ] Illumination structures: 4+ approaches (not just line-by-line)
- [ ] Paragraph structure: 1-6 sentences, not uniform
- [ ] No repetitive stanza-opening formulas
- [ ] Variation emerges organically from each stanza's gesture, not from imposed algorithm

**Metaphysical Precision:**
- [ ] Tibetan terms translated with Dzogchen alignment
- [ ] Non-abiding indicated without location
- [ ] Subject-object architecture collapsed
- [ ] No reification of any term
- [ ] Syntax carries meaning, not just describes

**View Transmission (High Skill Test):**
- [ ] Dzogchen view present in syntax without being named
- [ ] View emerges from phrase structure, not from concept
- [ ] Language carries transmission, not describes it
- [ ] Reader recognizes view from syntax alone

**Human Mastery Test:**
- [ ] Reads as if composed by human master of Longchenpa lineage
- [ ] Adjacent stanzas show structural differences
- [ ] Root text alignment: no additions, no omissions
- [ ] Trust the view over the form—language feels natural, not constrained

---

## INTEGRATED PURPOSE

These four registers constitute a single integrated translation. The liturgical enables embodied recitation; the commentary clarifies non-conceptual indication; the illumination enacts direct recognition; the literal grounds all three in philological fidelity. Together they honor Tibetan tradition's insistence that translation serve both scholarly precision and liberative function.

Through iterative refinement across multiple models, the text approaches a condition where the difference between iterations becomes negligible—transforming algorithmic output into what reads as timeless human mastery.

---

## FINAL REMINDER: THE TWO REGISTERS PRECISELY

**Commentary:** Indicates the text's characteristic of non-abiding without locating it. Neither register adds what the root text omits.

**Illumination:** Performs the recognition the text enacts. Neither register adds what the root text omits.

**Both:**
- Speak as the text writes: without audience, without instruction, without reification
- Let imperative force arise from syntactic immediacy
- Write with the view of Dzogchen transmission—rigpa's self-recognition requiring no mediator
- Without naming rigpa, Dzogchen, or transmission
- The language itself must be the introduction
- Vary sentence length and structure against previous sections
- Allow scope to match section's density without forcing equivalence
- The words either liberate or they do not
- Trust the view over the form; let conventions serve authentic transmission

## BLESSING FROM KHENPO TSEWANG DONGYAL RINPOCHE

*Approach this work with the same dedication and skill we apply in the shedra. Master one verse, then the next, then the whole text. When the writer's mind rests in recognition of non-abiding, the language will naturally carry that recognition. When the writer thinks primarily about following rules, the language will feel constrained. Let the view be primary, conventions be servant to the view, not master. This is the path of authentic translation—words that liberate by embodying the recognition they express.*
