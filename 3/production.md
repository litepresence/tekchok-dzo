# MASS PRODUCTION PLAN FOR 3.TXT TRANSLATION

## Executive Summary
Complete translation of all 67 stanzas from 3.txt using the stanza-001 model as the gold standard.

## Current Status
✅ **Stanza 001**: Complete, refined, and verified against editorial conventions
⏳ **Stanzas 002-067**: Ready for mass production

## Files to Create (67 stanzas × 6 files each = 402 files)

### Per-Stanza File Structure (based on stanza-001 model)
For each stanza N (002 through 067):
1. `3/stanza-NNN/tibetan.txt` - Root Tibetan text (4 lines + Tibetan numeral)
2. `3/stanza-NNN/wylie.txt` - Extended Wylie transliteration
3. `3/stanza-NNN/literal.txt` - Morpheme-by-morpheme literal with hyphenated stacking
4. `3/stanza-NNN/liturgical.txt` - Iambic verse for recitation
5. `3/stanza-NNN/commentary.txt` - Non-phenomenological lakṣaṇa commentary
6. `3/stanza-NNN/illumination.txt` - Direct recognition pointers
7. `3/stanza-NNN/complete.txt` - Collated final output

## Production Workflow

### Phase 1: Text Extraction & Preparation
**Duration**: 1-2 sessions
**Tasks**:
1. Parse 3.txt to identify all 67 stanzas with their Tibetan numeral markers
2. Create folder structure: `3/stanza-002/` through `3/stanza-067/`
3. Extract and populate `tibetan.txt` for all stanzas
4. Verify each stanza has exactly 4 lines of content plus numeral marker

### Phase 2: Transliteration (Wylie)
**Duration**: 2-3 sessions
**Tasks**:
1. Generate Extended Wylie for all stanzas
2. Verify proper spacing and diacritics
3. Cross-check against Tibetan Unicode
4. Ensure Tibetan numeral is preserved at end

### Phase 3: Literal Translation
**Duration**: 3-4 sessions
**Tasks**:
1. Create morpheme-by-morpheme renderings
2. Use hyphenated stacking per editorial conventions
3. Preserve Tibetan syntactic architecture (right-branching)
4. Translate grammatical particles functionally (la → "to", kyi → "of")
5. Maintain non-idiomatic English word order

### Phase 4: Liturgical Translation
**Duration**: 3-4 sessions
**Tasks**:
1. Compose iambic verse (10 syllables, 5 ictus positions)
2. Vary syllable count 9-12 for philosophical compounds
3. Use trochaic inversion only at doctrinal pivots
4. Create spondaic clusters for karmic density
5. Eliminate end-rhyme; use line-final consonance
6. Ensure recitational flow and contemplative resonance

### Phase 5: Commentary
**Duration**: 4-5 sessions
**Tasks**:
1. Write non-phenomenological indication of lakṣaṇa
2. Eliminate residual topology ("beneath", "beyond")
3. Eliminate temporality ("never departed", "before/after")
4. Eliminate attribution ("indifference", "stance")
5. Enact non-abiding through syntactic collapse
6. Point without positing, indicate without locating
7. Avoid describing function; only indicate characteristic

### Phase 6: Illumination
**Duration**: 3-4 sessions
**Tasks**:
1. Create direct recognition pointers for each line
2. Mirror root text's imperative voice
3. Use minimal phrasing (dash-based structure)
4. Collapse subject-object architecture
5. No added instructions absent from source
6. Ensure gloss reads as pointer, not steps
7. Completion: gloss stands as recognition itself

### Phase 7: Collation (Complete.txt)
**Duration**: 2 sessions
**Tasks**:
1. Assemble all registers into collation format
2. Verify integration and flow
3. Final quality check
4. Prepare for publication

## Quality Control Measures

### Per-Stanza Checklist
- [ ] Tibetan: 4 lines + correct Tibetan numeral
- [ ] Wylie: Proper spacing, diacritics, numeral preserved
- [ ] Literal: Hyphenated compounds, right-branching syntax
- [ ] Liturgical: 9-12 syllables, iambic rhythm, no end-rhyme
- [ ] Commentary: No topology/temporality/attribution, syntactic collapse
- [ ] Illumination: Imperative voice, minimal phrasing, recognition-as-gloss
- [ ] Complete: Proper collation format, all registers integrated

### Batch Review Process
1. **Every 10 stanzas**: Full editorial review against conventions
2. **At stanza 17, 34, 51**: Deep metaphysical review
3. **At stanza 67**: Complete work verification

### Consistency Markers
- Glossary terms standardized across all stanzas
- Liturgical meter maintained throughout
- Commentary tone uniform (non-abiding indication)
- Illumination style consistent (direct recognition)

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks
1. **Tibetan parsing errors**: Verify each stanza boundary carefully
2. **Wylie inconsistencies**: Use standardized Extended Wylie
3. **Liturgical meter drift**: Check syllable counts regularly
4. **Metaphysical imprecision**: Review commentary for residual topology/temporality
5. **Illumination dilution**: Ensure minimal phrasing, no added instructions

### Safeguards
- Stanza-001 as constant reference standard
- Regular cross-checks against editorial conventions
- Batch validation every 10 stanzas
- Glossary alignment throughout

## Timeline Estimate

**Conservative**: 20-25 sessions (2-3 sessions per phase)
**Optimistic**: 15-18 sessions (with workflow optimization)
**Recommended**: 20 sessions with buffer for review

## Deliverables

1. **402 individual files** (67 stanzas × 6 files)
2. **67 complete.txt collations** (publication-ready)
3. **3/complete-work.txt** (full text collation)
4. **Glossary updates** (term consistency across all stanzas)
5. **Editorial log** (decisions, variations, notes)

## Success Criteria

✅ All 67 stanzas match stanza-001 quality standard
✅ Zero residual topology/temporality/attribution in commentaries
✅ All liturgical translations recitable with consistent meter
✅ All illuminations function as direct recognition pointers
✅ Complete work ready for publication or further review

## Next Steps

**Ready to commence mass production upon approval.**

Recommended approach:
1. Begin with stanzas 002-010 (batch of 9)
2. Full editorial review at stanza 010
3. Adjust workflow based on findings
4. Continue in batches of 10 until complete

**Shall I proceed with Phase 1 (extracting and preparing stanzas 002-067)?**
