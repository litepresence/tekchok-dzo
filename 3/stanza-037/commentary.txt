## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza establishes the teaching's identity with the Three Jewels through the recognition of naked awareness. "The naked, straight awareness of the Omniscient Lama's mind"—the naked is not uncovered, not stripped. The straight is not direct, not honest. The awareness is not consciousness, not knowing. The Omniscient Lama is not all-knowing guru, not perfect master. The mind is not intellect, not thought. The lakṣaṇa is this: the naked that is not naked, the straight that is not straight, the awareness that is not aware, the mind that is not mind.

"This pith instruction showing things bare"—the pith is not essence, not core. The instruction is not teaching, not guidance. The showing is not demonstration, not exhibition. The bare is not naked, not uncovered. The things are not objects, not phenomena. The lakṣaṇa is this: the pith that is not pith, the instruction that instructs without instructor, the showing that shows without shower, the bare that bares without baring.

"Is the actual Buddha, is also the sacred Dharma"—the actual is not real, not true. The Buddha is not awakened one, not enlightened being. The sacred is not holy, not divine. The Dharma is not teaching, not doctrine. The lakṣaṇa is this: the actual that is not actual, the Buddha that buddhas without buddhing, the sacred that sacres without sacring, the Dharma that dharmas without dharma.

"And if devotion arises, is the virtuous spiritual friend"—the devotion is not faith, not reverence. The arising is not emergence, not appearance. The virtuous is not good, not ethical. The spiritual friend is not kalyāṇamitra, not teacher. The lakṣaṇa is this: the devotion that devotes without devotee, the friend that friends without friending, the virtue that virtuouses without virtuous.
