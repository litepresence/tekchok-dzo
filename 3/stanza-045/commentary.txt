## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the contrast between childish debate and the elder's intelligence of equal dharmatā. "Childish treatises possessing the play of debate" indicates not a chronological immaturity but an ontological limitation. Childish (byis pa) here means operating within a framework that has not yet recognized its own assumptions. The play of debate (rtsed mo'i rtsod pa) is not serious intellectual exchange but the endless oscillation between positions that share the same unexamined ground. The characteristic is this non-recognized play: not that debate is wrong, but that it perpetuates itself without questioning the frame within which debate is possible.

"Attached each to their own direction of is and is-not" indicates the automatic nature of conceptual fixation. Each (rang rang) suggests a multiplicity of positions, each equally certain, each equally blind to the ground they share. The attachment to is and is-not (yin dang ma yin) is not philosophical error but the inevitable result of a view that has not recognized equal dharmatā. The characteristic is this non-equal attachment: not that attachment is a moral failing, but that it operates within a system where equality has not yet been recognized.

"Possessing the elder's intelligence of equal dharmatā" indicates non-abiding as the maturity of recognition. Elder (rgan po) is not old age but the ripeness of view that has seen through the play of is and is-not. Equal dharmatā (mnyam pa'i chos nyid) is not a state of cosmic balance but the recognition that no position is ultimately privileged, that the ground of all debate is itself beyond the categories debated. The characteristic is this non-debated equality: not a position among positions, not a view that wins, but the recognition from which all views are seen as equal displays.

"The All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching is strong and firm" indicates non-abiding as unshakable recognition. Strong and firm (gzu bo) is not stubbornness or dogmatism but the stability of recognition that has no position to defend, no territory to protect. The excellent teaching (legs bshad) is not better doctrine but the pointing that reveals what was never hidden. The All-Knowing Lama is not a person with superior information but the recognition itself, the equality that knows no other. The characteristic is this non-defended strength: not maintained through effort, not preserved through vigilance, but the natural condition of what has no opposite, no contradiction, no debate.

The lakṣaṇa is this: child and elder, debate and equality, attachment and firmness—not sequential stages in a developmental process but simultaneous recognitions available in any moment. The Lama's teaching does not make one an elder over time but reveals that the elder's intelligence was never absent, never to be achieved, always already the nature of what debates without knowing it.
