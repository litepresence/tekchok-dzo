## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Childish treatises—not chronologically young, but view that has not recognized its own assumptions, operating within frames that remain unexamined.

Play of debate—not serious philosophy, not genuine inquiry, but oscillation between positions that share the same blindness.

Is and is-not—not ultimate categories, not real alternatives, but the machinery of thought that generates opposition where there is none.

Each attached to own direction—not moral failing, not weakness of will, but inevitable result of view that has not recognized equality.

Elder's intelligence—not age, not experience, but ripeness of recognition that has seen through the game of positions.

Equal dharmatā—not cosmic balance, not philosophical neutrality, but the recognition that all positions are equally displays of what is never positioned.

Strong and firm—not stubborn, not dogmatic, but stable because there is no position to defend, no territory to protect.

All-Knowing Lama—not a person, not an authority, but the recognition itself, the equality that is the nature of all knowing.
