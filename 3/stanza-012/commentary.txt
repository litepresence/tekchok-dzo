## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza addresses the enduring presence of the teacher in the teaching. "When the doctrine reaches its five hundred final years" does not mark a historical period but indicates the apparent fading of form—the moment when manifested presence seems to withdraw. Yet this withdrawal is not cessation; it is transformation into another mode of display.

"The Teacher dwells within the letter's form" establishes that the teacher's presence is not bound to a particular manifestation. The letters are not memorials preserving what has passed; they are the teacher's actual dwelling. The form of the letter is the form of the teacher—not symbolically, but as the same unlocalizable appearance.

"Thus spoke the Protector, compassion's heart" indicates that this teaching comes from the recognition that the protector's compassionate activity does not cease. The heart of compassion is not exhausted in particular acts of protection; it continues as the very availability of the teaching, the accessibility of the letters, the possibility of encounter.

"The Lion of ShAkya's face-acceptance" refers to the manner in which the Buddha's promise and prophecy are fulfilled—not through the persistence of a historical person, but through the inexhaustible availability of the teaching itself. The acceptance is the recognition that the teaching never departs, never arrives, never abides in between.
