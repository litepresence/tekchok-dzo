## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When the doctrine reaches its five hundred final years,
The Teacher dwells within the letter's form,
Thus spoke the Protector, compassion's heart,
The Lion of ShAkya's face-acceptance just like this.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza addresses the enduring presence of the teacher in the teaching. "When the doctrine reaches its five hundred final years" does not mark a historical period but indicates the apparent fading of form—the moment when manifested presence seems to withdraw. Yet this withdrawal is not cessation; it is transformation into another mode of display.

"The Teacher dwells within the letter's form" establishes that the teacher's presence is not bound to a particular manifestation. The letters are not memorials preserving what has passed; they are the teacher's actual dwelling. The form of the letter is the form of the teacher—not symbolically, but as the same unlocalizable appearance.

"Thus spoke the Protector, compassion's heart" indicates that this teaching comes from the recognition that the protector's compassionate activity does not cease. The heart of compassion is not exhausted in particular acts of protection; it continues as the very availability of the teaching, the accessibility of the letters, the possibility of encounter.

"The Lion of ShAkya's face-acceptance" refers to the manner in which the Buddha's promise and prophecy are fulfilled—not through the persistence of a historical person, but through the inexhaustible availability of the teaching itself. The acceptance is the recognition that the teaching never departs, never arrives, never abides in between.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

The five hundred final years—not a countdown, not a calendar, but the apparent fading that never fades.

The Teacher dwells—not moving into the letters, not emerging from them.

The letter's form—the Teacher's form, not two forms, not one form.

The Protector's heart—not protecting from danger, but the danger itself recognized.

The Lion's acceptance—never given, never received, never promised.

This just like this—not similar to, not exemplifying, but the same.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Five hundred final-of doctrine become time
Speech-collection form-appearance letter forms by
Teacher dwells thus Protector heart-compassion possessing
ShAkya Lion's face-acceptance thus like
