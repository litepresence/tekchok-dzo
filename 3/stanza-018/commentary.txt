## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza celebrates inconceivable qualities of the Sugata as displayed in teaching. The numbers and enumerations are not counts but indicators of inexhaustible richness. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment and similar schemes are here signs of recognition, not sequential steps.

The profound and vast describe a single nature that is unfathomable and all-encompassing; depth and breadth collapse into a non-localizable display.

The self-nature of dharma-nature is not an attribute of something else but the essential nature of all appearance. It cannot be captured by expression, since expression is a moment of seeing itself.

Direct showing—the yogic or direct revelation that does not rely on intermediate steps—unfolds here as the very presentation of what is already present. Skilful means are not a technique to be learned but a recognition that all methods are skillful when they reveal the non-dual ground.
