## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza maintains inclusion without reduction; the expanse of eighty-four thousand dharmas is not a count but an inexhaustible display. The teaching is not distributed across texts but concentrated in the single theme; the ocean appears as a wave without loss.

The principle applies to this present teaching: the lama's speech is not lesser due to its later appearance; it is the same recognition appearing differently.

The extraordinary dharma is that the complete is never incomplete; the single word contains what cannot be contained, and the Lama's teaching is not derivative but original appearing as repetition.
