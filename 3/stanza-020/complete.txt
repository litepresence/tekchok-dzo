## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

If the expanse of the eighty-four thousand sections' meaning
Is certainly included in that expressed theme,
Why would the profound dharma of the All-knowing Lama's excellent speech
Not be included in a single verse-line?

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza maintains inclusion without reduction; the expanse of eighty-four thousand dharmas is not a count but an inexhaustible display. The teaching is not distributed across texts but concentrated in the single theme; the ocean appears as a wave without loss.

The principle applies to this present teaching: the lama's speech is not lesser due to its later appearance; it is the same recognition appearing differently.

The extraordinary dharma is that the complete is never incomplete; the single word contains what cannot be contained, and the Lama's teaching is not derivative but original appearing as repetition.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Eighty-four thousand—not a number, not a catalogue, not a curriculum.

Expanse of meaning—not contained, not distributed, not summarized.

Included—not gathered in, not reduced to, not represented by.

That theme—not selected, not emphasized, not extracted.

Why not—not a question seeking answer, but pointing to the obvious.

Single verse-line—not a part, not a sample, not an example.

Profound dharma—not hidden, not advanced, not requiring preparation.

Already included—never excluded, never needing inclusion.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

eighty-four thousand section-meaning knowledge-of expanse
included in if-certain that of express theme scripture
all-knowing Lama's excellent-explanation profound dharma
verse-line single in what of why not include
