## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Eighty-four thousand—not a number, not a catalogue, not a curriculum.

Expanse of meaning—not contained, not distributed, not summarized.

Included—not gathered in, not reduced to, not represented by.

That theme—not selected, not emphasized, not extracted.

Why not—not a question seeking answer, but pointing to the obvious.

Single verse-line—not a part, not a sample, not an example.

Profound dharma—not hidden, not advanced, not requiring preparation.

Already included—never excluded, never needing inclusion.
