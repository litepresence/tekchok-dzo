## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Even hearing a single word, the dust of conceptual thought
Is completely abandoned, and the samadhi of peace
Effortlessly arises in the mind—
This is the All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching: liberation through hearing.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through liberation through hearing (thos grol). "Even hearing a single word" indicates that liberation does not depend upon quantity of teaching or duration of study. The single word is not a minimal requirement but the recognition that completeness does not accumulate. What is heard in that instant is not information about something else but the immediate presence of what is always already the case.

"The dust of conceptual thought completely abandoned" points to the abandonment that is not an act of rejection. The conceptual dust was never substantial; its apparent density was the misperception of thought's own nature. Abandonment here is recognition, not elimination—seeing that the dust was never other than clarity, never actually obscured what it seemed to veil.

"The samadhi of peace" indicates not a state achieved or entered but the natural condition recognized when conceptual overlay subsides. Peace (zhi ba) is not the opposite of disturbance but the recognition that disturbance itself has no substantial nature. The samadhi is not a meditative attainment but the seeing of what never departed from stillness.

"Effortlessly arises" indicates that this recognition requires no cultivation, no practice, no gradual maturation. Effort implies distance from what is sought; effortlessness reveals that there was never distance, never anything to traverse. The arising is the recognition of what has always been present, not the generation of something new.

The lakṣaṇa is this: hearing as direct recognition, liberation as the nature of hearing itself—not hearing leading to liberation, but hearing already liberated, already complete.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Single word—completeness not waiting for more, not lacking in less, this syllable already sufficient.

Hearing—not receiving information but recognition occurring, sound meeting silence, silence meeting sound.

Conceptual dust—never substantial, never accumulated, only the appearance of accumulation, seen through.

Abandoned—not cast away but recognized as never having been, never having stayed, never having obscured.

Samadhi of peace—not entered, not maintained, but revealed as what never departed, never disturbed, never still.

Effortless arising—no cultivation needed, no distance to cross, this arising the recognition of always-having-been.

Liberation through hearing—the hearing liberates, the liberation hears, not two, not sequence, not cause and effect.

This teaching—sound as recognition, word as freedom, hearing the nature already free.
