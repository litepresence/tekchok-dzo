## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Single word—completeness not waiting for more, not lacking in less, this syllable already sufficient.

Hearing—not receiving information but recognition occurring, sound meeting silence, silence meeting sound.

Conceptual dust—never substantial, never accumulated, only the appearance of accumulation, seen through.

Abandoned—not cast away but recognized as never having been, never having stayed, never having obscured.

Samadhi of peace—not entered, not maintained, but revealed as what never departed, never disturbed, never still.

Effortless arising—no cultivation needed, no distance to cross, this arising the recognition of always-having-been.

Liberation through hearing—the hearing liberates, the liberation hears, not two, not sequence, not cause and effect.

This teaching—sound as recognition, word as freedom, hearing the nature already free.
