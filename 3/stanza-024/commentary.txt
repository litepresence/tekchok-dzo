## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza refines non-abiding by attending to reg grol (touching) as immediate recognition, not a disciplined ascent. Harsh intellectual fault-finding is replaced by the recognition that mind does not require top-down control; cool, gentle touch signals contact without fixation; the peace arises when separation is seen through, revealing samsara as liberation rather than a prison.

Samsara's sufferings are not conquered by struggle but disclosed as non-substantial when touched with clarity. The deathless vehicle is not a vehicle you travel to but the recognition that travel itself is the revelation of a limitless base.

The lakṣaṇa: touching as recognition, contact without separation, liberation as the nature of sensation itself.
