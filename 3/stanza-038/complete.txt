## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

This is the famed so-called Fourth Empowerment,
The final reach of profound keys from all tantra collections—
The empowerment of awareness-power, completing the four empowerments.
Seeing such excellent teachings, no other exists.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza aligns the Fourth Empowerment with a living, nondual perception. The “famed Fourth Empowerment” is not a title but the living wholeness of awareness that completes tantric transmission when recognized directly, not by lineage or lineage names. The non-dual lakṣaṇa remains: the famed that is not famed, the called that is not called, the fourth that is not fourth, the empowerment that empowers without empowering.

The “final reach” of keys from all tantra collections is not a distant achievement but the present recognition of the oneness of all teachings; the empowerment of awareness-power completes the four empowerments and is accessible in the here-and-now, not in a ladder of initiations.

Seeing such excellent teachings, no other exists: the no-other is the recognition that teaching is not a competition but a shared realization across traditions.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Famed so-called—not reputation or designation, but the fame that is the called and the called that is the fame.
00002| Fourth Empowerment—not numerical, but the empowerment that is the fourth.
00003| Final reach—not ultimate, but the reach that is final when realized in awareness.
00004| Profound keys—not deep or instrument, but keys that reveal the profundity directly.
00005| Tantra collections—not texts, but the tantra that is the collection, the collection that is tantra.
00006| Awareness-power—not cognition, but the awareness that is the power.
00007| Completing four—not finishing, but the four that completes without completion.
00008| Seeing such teachings—not perception or comparison, but the seeing that is the teaching itself.
00009| No other exists—not exclusion but absence of separation, the no-other that is the existence itself.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Tantra-collections all's profound key final-reach
Fourth's empowerment called famed this is
Empowerment four complete awareness power's empowerment
Teaching excellent this like see-from other exist not
