## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza aligns the Fourth Empowerment with a living, nondual perception. The “famed Fourth Empowerment” is not a title but the living wholeness of awareness that completes tantric transmission when recognized directly, not by lineage or lineage names. The non-dual lakṣaṇa remains: the famed that is not famed, the called that is not called, the fourth that is not fourth, the empowerment that empowers without empowering.

The “final reach” of keys from all tantra collections is not a distant achievement but the present recognition of the oneness of all teachings; the empowerment of awareness-power completes the four empowerments and is accessible in the here-and-now, not in a ladder of initiations.

Seeing such excellent teachings, no other exists: the no-other is the recognition that teaching is not a competition but a shared realization across traditions.
