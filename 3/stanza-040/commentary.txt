## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza tightens the sense that the key point of speech is not an abstract essence but a live, contextual portrait of realization. Speech and portrait are not separate objects; realization arises in the moment when words and meaning display their inseparability. Lakṣaṇa: the key that is not key, the point that is not point, the speech that speaks without speaker, the portrait that portrays without portrayer.

Commitment and devotion seal an ongoing openness; the Lama’s wisdom is present here and now, not as a distant acquisition but as a living presence.
