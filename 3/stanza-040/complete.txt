## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

This key point of speech is a portrait of realization,
Great wisdom's words and meanings blessed—
Making a truth-word commitment seal for the devoted,
If definitely firm, this Lama is oneself.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza tightens the sense that the key point of speech is not an abstract essence but a live, contextual portrait of realization. Speech and portrait are not separate objects; realization arises in the moment when words and meaning display their inseparability. Lakṣaṇa: the key that is not key, the point that is not point, the speech that speaks without speaker, the portrait that portrays without portrayer.

Commitment and devotion seal an ongoing openness; the Lama’s wisdom is present here and now, not as a distant acquisition but as a living presence.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Key point of speech—not essence, not words, but the point where speech becomes reality.
00002| Portrait of realization—not image, not attainment, but realization as expression.
00003| Great wisdom's words and meanings blessed—no separation between word and meaning.
00004| Making a truth-word commitment—seal for the devoted, binding devotion to the teaching.
00005| If definitely firm, this Lama is oneself—recognition that the lama is the self.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Speech's key-point this realization's portrait is
Wisdom great word meaning blessing-transmitted
Devotion possessing-to truth-word commitment seal make
Definitely firm-if Lama this self is
