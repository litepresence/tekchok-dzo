## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza cultivates the ground where devotion and critical reflection meet, presenting a non-dual recognition that moves beyond the false dichotomy of faith vs. reason. Devotion grounds examination; examination clarifies devotion by revealing its non-separateness from the text.

Lakṣaṇa: the convergence of devotion and analysis; non-temporal duration; non-eventful recognition that remains present in every moment.
