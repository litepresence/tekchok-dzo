## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When devotion's obtained and words are examined well,
For every moment spent with scriptures such as these,
The mind of direct dharmatā recognition,
From supreme luminosity—could wavering be?
༤༡

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza cultivates the ground where devotion and critical reflection meet, presenting a non-dual recognition that moves beyond the false dichotomy of faith vs. reason. Devotion grounds examination; examination clarifies devotion by revealing its non-separateness from text.

Devotion obtained—no receiving or obtaining, but recognition as the ground for examination. Words and meanings examined—not separate categories, but the display of inseparability.

Duration of meeting—not measured in moments, but the unbroken continuity of recognition. Mind of direct dharmatā—recognition as mind's nature, without mediator. Supreme luminosity—not brightness, but absence of wavering ground.

The question "could wavering be?" dissolves in recognition; the question was never posed by anything capable of wavering.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Devotion obtained—not received, but recognized as grounding for examination.

Words and meanings examined—not separated; display of inseparability.

Duration of meeting—not measured in moments, but unbroken continuity of recognition.

Mind of direct dharmatā—recognition as mind's nature, without mediator.

Supreme luminosity—not bright, but absence of wavering ground.

Could wavering be?—the question dissolves in recognition; the question was never posed by anything capable of wavering.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Devotion-reverence obtain after word-meaning examine know if
Scripture-excellent this-like what-much meet-of duration
That-long that mind dharmatā direct-recognition-of
Luminosity-supreme from wavering is indeed
