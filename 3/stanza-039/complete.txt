## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The Omniscient Lama's form of illusion-like rainbow body—
Though once dwelling, is not now non-existent.
If able to see, dwells before oneself,
But if obscured by conceptuality, even if manifestly come, what use?

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza centers the rainbow body and illusion-like form as the currency of nondual realization. The Omniscient Lama’s form is not a fixed shape but a dynamic embodiment of awakening; illusion-like is not unreal but a rainbow spectrum of display that reveals mind’s true nature. The lakṣaṇa remains: the omnniscient that is not omniscient, the rainbow that is not rainbow, the body that is not body.

The dwelling and the non-existent are one, since the true nature of the mind is neither anchored in place nor in absence. If the mind can see, it dwells before the self; if obscured by conceptuality, even manifestness has no ultimate use. Lakṣaṇa: awareness that remains in the middle beyond conceptualization.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Omniscient Lama—not all-knowing, not master, but the omniscient that is the Lama, the Lama that is the omniscient.
00002| Illusion-like rainbow body—not unreal, not phenomenon, but the illusion that is the rainbow, the rainbow that is the body.
00003| Once dwelling—not past, not residence, but the once that is the dwelling, the dwelling that is the once.
00004| Not now non-existent—not present, not absence, but the now that is the existent, the existent that is the now.
00005| Able to see—not capacity, not perception, but the able that is the seeing, the seeing that is the able.
00006| Dwells before self—not staying, not ego, but the dwelling that is the self, the self that is the dwelling.
00007| Obscured by conceptuality—not covering, not thought, but the obscured that is the concept, the concept that is the obscured.
00008| Manifestly come—even if arrived, but the manifest that is the come, the come that is the manifest.
00009| What use—not utility, not purpose, but the what that is the use, the use that is the what.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Omniscient Lama rainbow-body illusion's form
Before dwelling is now not-existent not
