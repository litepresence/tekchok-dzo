## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza centers the rainbow body and illusion-like form as the currency of nondual realization. The Omniscient Lama’s form is not a fixed shape but a dynamic embodiment of awakening; illusion-like is not unreal but a rainbow spectrum of display that reveals mind’s true nature. The lakṣaṇa remains: the omnniscient that is not omniscient, the rainbow that is not rainbow, the body that is not body.

The dwelling and the non-existent are one, since the true nature of the mind is neither anchored in place nor in absence. If the mind can see, it dwells before the self; if obscured by conceptuality, even manifestness has no ultimate use. Lakṣaṇa: awareness that remains in the middle beyond conceptualization.
