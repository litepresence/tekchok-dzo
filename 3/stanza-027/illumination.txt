00001| Door of cause-and-effect—not rejected but opened, opened to what exceeds.
00002| Cause-and-effect vehicle—not wrong but partial; its fullness is immediate presence.
00003| Dimension without cause-and-effect—not other place but same place seen through.
00004| Equal and same—cause not producing other, effect not resulting from separation.
00005| All-Knowing Lama's instruction—not doctrine but direct indication, pointing to what is already.
00006| No second scholar—not claim of uniqueness; no comparison where teaching does not stand.
00007| This instruction—causality as appearance, equality as nature, seeing through the two to the never-having-been-two.
