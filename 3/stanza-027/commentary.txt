## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza opens the door of causality’s dissolution and reframes it as non-abiding through non-dual awareness. The opening line indicates a move beyond linear cause-effect thinking; the door opens into a space that transcends framework. The lakṣaṇa presents non-duality: causality as appearance, equality as nature—neither negating the other; they were never two.
