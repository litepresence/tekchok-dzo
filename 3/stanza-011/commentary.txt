## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza establishes the inseparability of literary form and enlightened presence. "The letter's form, the Lion of ShAkya's body" indicates not a metaphorical correspondence but an identity without hierarchy—the written character is not a symbol pointing to a body, nor the body a referent for the character. Both are appearances of the same non-localizable display, neither prior nor subsequent to one another.

"The string of words, the speech of Omniscient Lama" collapses the distinction between expression and expresser. The words are not vehicles carrying meaning from a source; the Lama's speech is the words themselves, not possessed by a speaker, not produced in time, not received by an ear. The expression is complete in each syllable, not distributed across a sequence.

"The profound meaning, the heart of all Victorious Ones" indicates meaning that does not await interpretation. The meaning is not extracted from the words, not discovered through analysis, not revealed after reading. The profound is the very surface; the depth is the appearance itself, not hidden behind or within it.

"Seeing this scripture, the Sugata complete is seen" establishes that encounter with the text is encounter with complete awakening—not partial, not progressive, not culminating in a future recognition. The Sugata is not seen through the scripture as through a window; the seeing of scripture is the seeing of Sugata, without remainder, without the scripture functioning as medium or means.
