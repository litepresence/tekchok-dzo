## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza shows the teaching’s adaptive capacity and ultimate non-duality through a minimal, crisp framing. The taming (boddhis) is not about subjugation; it’s about recognizing that beings, realms, and aspirations are not discrete, but facets of a single experiential field. The nine vehicles and mind-investigated path are not a hierarchy; they are a non-dual choreography in which cause and effect are not sequential but mutually illuminating. Lakṣaṇa: perception without dualism, the realm without location, the path that is the essence.
