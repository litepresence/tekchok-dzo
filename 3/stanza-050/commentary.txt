## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the companion of awareness in solitude. "When dwelling solitary in a place of seclusion" indicates not a physical location but the condition of recognition. Place of seclusion (dben pa'i gnas) is not remote geography but the absence of external reference points, the condition in which the mind has no distraction to flee to. Dwelling solitary (gcig pur gnas pa) indicates not loneliness but the recognition that there is no other, that what appears as multiplicity is already singular. The characteristic is this non-lonely solitude: not isolation, not separation from others, but the recognition that there was never any other to be separated from.

"Look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the activity of recognition in solitude. The imperative is not an instruction for what to do alone but the recognition that solitude is already looking, already seeing what is. These excellent scriptures are not company in loneliness but the revelation that there is no loneliness, no separation that needs to be filled. The characteristic is this non-compensatory looking: not seeking distraction from solitude, not finding comfort in words, but direct recognition of what is already the case, already present, already complete.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the companion of awareness" indicates non-abiding as accompaniment without separation. Companion (skyo grogs) is not someone who keeps one company but the recognition that there is no one who needs company. Awareness (rig pa) is not a faculty possessed by an individual but the nature of what is, never solitary because never separated from what appears. The excellent teaching is not external instruction but this companionship itself, the recognition that there was never anyone who needed to be accompanied. The characteristic is this non-accompanying companion: not someone who walks beside, not something that fills the gap, but the recognition that there was never any gap, never any distance that needed bridging.

"That transcends the day-night cycle through dharma" indicates the timeless nature of recognition. The day-night cycle (nyin mtshan 'khor yug) represents all temporal succession, all coming and going, all arising and passing. To transcend ('da' byed pa) is not to escape time but to recognize that time never enclosed what is. Dharma (chos) is not a teaching to be applied but the nature of what is, the recognition that was always already the case, always already beyond the cycle that appears to contain it. The characteristic is this non-transcending transcendence: not going somewhere else, not rising above, but the recognition that there was never any enclosure, never any cycle that could bind what is.

The lakṣaṇa is this: solitude and companionship, day and night, cycle and transcendence—not opposed conditions but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which separation could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not a better companion but the pointer to what is already accompanied, already complete, already the nature of what appears as alone.
