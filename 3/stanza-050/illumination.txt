Place of seclusion—not remote location, not hermitage, but the absence of external reference, the condition where mind has nowhere to flee.

Dwelling solitary—not lonely, not isolated, but recognition that there is no other, that multiplicity is already singular.

Excellent scriptures—not company, not distraction, but revelation that there is no loneliness, no separation that needs filling.

Companion of awareness—not someone who keeps company, not presence to fill absence, but recognition that there is no one who needs accompaniment.

Day-night cycle—not mere time, not temporal flow, but all coming and going, all arising and passing, the apparent enclosure of what is.

Transcend through dharma—not escape, not transcendence achieved, but recognition that time never enclosed what is, that dharma is already the case.

Weariness companion—not consolation for exhaustion, not relief from effort, but the recognition that there was never any effort needed, never any weariness that was real.
