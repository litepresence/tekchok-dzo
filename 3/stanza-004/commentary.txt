## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

Supreme All-Knowing emanates as body beyond time—the temporal sequence dissolves into appearance itself, where "after" appears without subsequentity. Emanation body manifests without emanator, appearing without source. Supremacy knows no comparison, All-Knowing possesses no possessor—knowing knows itself as knowing, knowing knows all knowing.

Victorious deeds protect where no protection is needed—the degenerate age appears as agelessness, beings appear without beingness. Protection protects nothing yet accomplishes everything, defending without defender, preserving without preserved. The activity acts without actor, deeds without doer, protecting without protector.

Treasury of peak vehicle liberates through hearing—treasury treasures without treasuring, vehicle travels without traveler, peak summits without summit. Hearing liberates without liberation, sound releases without release. Doctrine teaches without teaching, liberates without liberating. The peak vehicle arrives without arrival, reaches without reaching.

Vajra Essence teaching makes clear without clarification—clarity clears without clearing, essence essentializes without essentializing. Teaching teaches without teacher, instructs without instruction. The Vajra Essence pierces without piercing, cuts without cutting, yet cuts through what was never cut. Clarity clarifies what was never unclear.
