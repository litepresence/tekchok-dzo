Dust-clouds of conceptions—not particles, not obscuration, but the very display of awareness that appears to move yet never departs from stillness.

Various conceptions—not multiplicity, not diversity, but the various that is the conception, the conception that is the various.

Moving time—not change, not sequence, but the moving that is the time, the time that is the moving.

Look at these scriptures—not study, not analysis, but direct recognition that requires no preparation.

Vajra of pristine awareness—not diamond, not thunderbolt, but the indestructible nature that destroys nothing because nothing was ever constructed.

Deluded conception wall—not barrier, not enclosure, but the self-erected boundary that falls when seen as never built.

Destroying—not demolition, not breaking, but recognition that there was never anything to destroy.

All-knowing teaching—not doctrine, not instruction, but the knowing that is the teaching, the teaching that is the knowing.
