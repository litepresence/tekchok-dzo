## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When dust-clouds of various conceptions are moving,
Look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the vajra of pristine awareness
That destroys the wall of deluded conceptions.
༤༧

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza presents the teaching as a vajra of pristine awareness that shatters the wall of deluded conceptions. "When dust-clouds of various conceptions are moving"—the when is not temporal occurrence, not sequential happening. The dust-clouds are not particles, not obscuration. The various is not multiplicity, not diversity. The conceptions are not thoughts, not ideas. The moving is not motion, not change. The lakṣaṇa is this: the when that whens without when, the dust-cloud that dust-clouds without dust-cloud, the various that variouses without various, the conception that conceives without conceiver, the moving that moves without mover.

"Look at these excellent scriptures"—the looking is not seeing, not visual perception. The these is not particularization, not selection. The excellent is not superior quality, not refined nature. The scriptures are not texts, not writings. The lakṣaṇa is this: the look that looks without looker, the these that theses without thesing, the excellent that excels without excelling, the scripture that scriptures without scripturing.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the vajra of pristine awareness"—the all-knowing is not omniscience, not complete knowledge. The excellent teaching is not superior doctrine, not refined instruction. The vajra is not diamond, not thunderbolt. The pristine awareness is not primordial wisdom, not original knowing. The lakṣaṇa is this: the all-knowing that all-knows without all-knower, the teaching that teaches without teacher, the vajra that vajras without vajra, the pristine awareness that pristine awares without pristine aware.

"That destroys the wall of deluded conceptions"—the destroying is not demolition, not breaking. The wall is not barrier, not enclosure. The deluded is not confused, not mistaken. The conceptions are not thoughts, not constructs. The lakṣaṇa is this: the destroy that destroys without destroyer, the wall that walls without wall, the deluded that deludes without deluder, the conception that conceives without conceiver.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Dust-clouds of conceptions—not particles, not obscuration, but the very display of awareness that appears to move yet never departs from stillness.

Various conceptions—not multiplicity, not diversity, but the various that is the conception, the conception that is the various.

Moving time—not change, not sequence, but the moving that is the time, the time that is the moving.

Look at these scriptures—not study, not analysis, but direct recognition that requires no preparation.

Vajra of pristine awareness—not diamond, not thunderbolt, but the indestructible nature that destroys nothing because nothing was ever constructed.

Deluded conception wall—not barrier, not enclosure, but the self-erected boundary that falls when seen as never built.

Destroying—not demolition, not breaking, but recognition that there was never anything to destroy.

All-knowing teaching—not doctrine, not instruction, but the knowing that is the teaching, the teaching that is the knowing.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Various conceptions dust-cloud moving time
Scripture excellent these look please
Deluded-conception wall what by destroy will
All-knowing excellent-teaching pristine-awareness vajra is
