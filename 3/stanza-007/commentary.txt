## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

Mighty One's ambrosia manifests as marks and symbols for eyes—ambrosia feeds without nourishment, marks indicate without marking, symbols symbolize without signifying. Mighty One mights without possessing might, eyes see without seeing. The sensory experience dissolves: marks mark the unmarked, symbols signify the unsignified, ambrosia nourishes the unnourished.

Three faiths produce in fortunate mind without production—production produces without causation, faiths believe without believers, mind contains without containment. The fortunate receives without receiving, experiencing without experiencer. Faith manifests threefold yet faith itself remains indivisible, uncountable, uncontainable.

Letter-form craft emanates as excellent explanation—craft forms without skill, letters without literacy, explanation without clarifying. Emanation projects without projection, appearing without source. Excellence excels without comparison, explanation explains without explaining.

No medicine surpasses this as faith's remedy—superiority ranks without hierarchy, medicine cures without healing, faith believes without belief. The remedy remedies without remedying, healing without curing. Medicine itself heals what was never ill, faith itself believes what was never disbelieved.
