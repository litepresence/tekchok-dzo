## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Illness—not disease, not ailment, but the apparent disruption of what was never disrupted.

Suffering—not pain, not distress, but the fundamental misrecognition of what is.

Harm—not injury, not damage, but the belief that something can be lost that was never possessed.

Adverse conditions—not obstacles, not problems, but the appearances that seem opposed to what is wanted.

Companions—not helpers, not allies, but the recognition that all phenomena are the display of what they seem to oppose.

Nectar that turns to gold—not alchemy, not transformation, but the recognition that what appears as base was always gold, always nectar.
