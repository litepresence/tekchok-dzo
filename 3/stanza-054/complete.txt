## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When illness, suffering, and harm arise,
Please look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the nectar that turns to gold
That transforms adverse conditions and appearances into companions.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the nectar that turns to gold. "When illness, suffering, and harm arise" indicates the condition of embodied existence as vulnerability. Illness (nad) is not disease but the apparent disruption of what was never disrupted. Suffering (sdug bsngal) is not pain but the fundamental misrecognition of what is. Harm (gnod pa) is not injury but the belief that something can be lost. The characteristic is this non-vulnerable vulnerability: not that there is health to be protected, but that the illness is itself the health unrecognized.

"Please look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the suffering to what is already whole. The imperative is not an escape from illness but the recognition that the illness is itself the display of what is beyond illness. These excellent scriptures are not healing remedies but the nectar that reveals there was never any wound. The characteristic is this non-healing healing: not finding cures, not seeking relief, but direct recognition that there was never any disease, never anything that needed healing.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the nectar that turns to gold" indicates non-abiding as alchemical transformation. Nectar (bdud rtsi) is not a substance to consume but the nature of what is, unstained by conditions. Gold (gser) is not wealth but the recognition that what appears base was always precious. The characteristic is this non-transforming transformation: not that something changes, but that the unchanging is recognized in what appears to change.

"That transforms adverse conditions and appearances into companions" indicates the function of wisdom as conversion of obstacles into opportunities. Adverse conditions (rkyen ngan) are not obstacles but appearances that seem opposed. Companions (grogs) are not helpers but the recognition that all phenomena are the display of what they seem to oppose. The characteristic is this non-converting conversion: not turning bad into good, not transforming obstacles, but recognizing that there were never any obstacles, never anything that needed transformation.

The lakṣaṇa is this: illness and health, suffering and ease, harm and benefit—not sequential stages in a healing process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which disease could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior medicine but the pointer to what was never in need of healing, never separate from the gold that was always already present.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Illness—not disease, not ailment, but the apparent disruption of what was never disrupted.

Suffering—not pain, not distress, but the fundamental misrecognition of what is.

Harm—not injury, not damage, but the belief that something can be lost that was never possessed.

Adverse conditions—not obstacles, not problems, but the appearances that seem opposed to what is wanted.

Companions—not helpers, not allies, but the recognition that all phenomena are the display of what they seem to oppose.

Nectar that turns to gold—not alchemy, not transformation, but the recognition that what appears as base was always gold, always nectar.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Illness and suffering harm arisen when
Scripture-excellent these look please
Conditions adverse appearances companion-as transform do
All-knowing excellent-teaching gold-become nectar is
