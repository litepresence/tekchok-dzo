## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The ambrosia for the ears, the Brahma-sound of the Teacher,
Is indeed the producer of wisdom in the mind of the fortunate.
The ambrosia for the ears, the garland of words in excellent explanation—
There is none equal to this as medicine for wisdom.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

Ambrosia dissolves hearing's act; Brahma-sound is sound that sounds itself—no utterer, no receiver. Wisdom arises without source; the fortunate mind knows without a knower. A garland of words forms without a binding thread. Medicine cures without cure; healing arises without healing. Sound emerges as sound; hearing recognizes what recognizes itself. Brahma-sound speaks without uttering; teaching teaches by presence, not by a teacher. Words arrange themselves into a garland, not by deliberate arrangement.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Ambrosia for ears—hearing itself.

Brahma-sound—sound that speaks without a speaker.

Teacher—teaching that is Teacher, sound that is Brahma.

Wisdom producer—production that is wisdom, mind that is producing.

Fortunate mind—mind that is fortune, wisdom that is mind.

Garland of words—not string, but garland that is words.

Equal medicine—not comparison; medicine that is equality, wisdom without equal.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Teacher's Brahma-sound ear-of ambrosia is
Fortune-good mind in wisdom produce is
Excellent-explained word-garland ear-of ambrosia is
Wisdom medicine this with equal not
