## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

Ambrosia dissolves hearing’s act; Brahma-sound is sound that sounds itself—no utterer, no receiver. Wisdom arises without source; the fortunate mind knows without a knower. A garland of words forms without a binding thread. Medicine cures without cure; healing arises without healing. Sound emerges as sound; hearing recognizes what recognizes itself. Brahma-sound speaks without uttering; teaching teaches by presence, not by a teacher. Words arrange themselves into a garland, not by deliberate arrangement.
