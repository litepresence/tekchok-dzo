## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through recognition of inexpressibility. "Although the garland of qualities of the All-Knowing excellent teaching, like a jewel treasure, is not possible to measure" indicates the condition of the teaching as infinite display. Jewel treasure (nor bu'i gter) is not wealth but the inexhaustible source. Garland of qualities (yon tan phreng ba) is not attributes but the endless display. Not possible to measure (gzhal du mi spyod) is not vast but the recognition that measurement was always measuring itself. The characteristic is this non-infinite infinity: not that the teaching is beyond measure, but that measure is itself the immeasurable unrecognized.

"If this little that is spoken is not the ultimate" indicates the paradox of expression. Little spoken (cung zad smras) is not insufficient but the recognition that there is nothing more to say. Ultimate (mthar thug) is not final but the recognition that there was never any journey. The characteristic is this non-expressive expression: not that words fail, not that speech is inadequate, but that the inadequacy is itself the recognition of what never needed expression.

"How could the subject of speech be complete?" indicates the function of wisdom as acknowledgment of limit. Subject of speech (brjod bya) is not topic but the inexhaustible that is never exhausted. Complete (rdzogs) is not finished but the recognition that there was never anything incomplete. The characteristic is this non-completing completion: not finishing the topic, not exhausting the subject, but the recognition that there was never any topic, never anything that needed completion.

The author's humility is not false modesty but the genuine recognition that the All-Knowing teaching is beyond any individual's capacity to fully express. Yet the very attempt to express, the very acknowledgment of inadequacy, is itself the perfect expression. The characteristic is this non-humble humility: not pretending to be less than one is, not denying one's capacity, but the genuine recognition that capacity and incapacity are themselves the display of what they seem to limit.

The lakṣaṇa is this: measure and immeasurability, speech and silence, completion and openness—not sequential stages in an expressive process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which expression could appear as something that succeeds or fails. The All-Knowing teaching is not beyond expression but the pointer to what was never in need of expression, never separate from the speech that was always already complete in its incompleteness.
