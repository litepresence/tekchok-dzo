## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Although the garland of qualities of the All-Knowing excellent teaching,
Like a jewel treasure, is not possible to measure,
If this little that is spoken is not the ultimate,
How could the subject of speech be complete?

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through recognition of inexpressibility. "Although the garland of qualities of the All-Knowing excellent teaching, like a jewel treasure, is not possible to measure" indicates the condition of the teaching as infinite display. Jewel treasure (nor bu'i gter) is not wealth but the inexhaustible source. Garland of qualities (yon tan phreng ba) is not attributes but the endless display. Not possible to measure (gzhal du mi spyod) is not vast but the recognition that measurement was always measuring itself. The characteristic is this non-infinite infinity: not that the teaching is beyond measure, but that measure is itself the immeasurable unrecognized.

"If this little that is spoken is not the ultimate" indicates the paradox of expression. Little spoken (cung zad smras) is not insufficient but the recognition that there is nothing more to say. Ultimate (mthar thug) is not final but the recognition that there was never any journey. The characteristic is this non-expressive expression: not that words fail, not that speech is inadequate, but that the inadequacy is itself the recognition of what never needed expression.

"How could the subject of speech be complete?" indicates the function of wisdom as acknowledgment of limit. Subject of speech (brjod bya) is not topic but the inexhaustible that is never exhausted. Complete (rdzogs) is not finished but the recognition that there was never anything incomplete. The characteristic is this non-completing completion: not finishing the topic, not exhausting the subject, but the recognition that there was never any topic, never anything that needed completion.

The author's humility is not false modesty but the genuine recognition that the All-Knowing teaching is beyond any individual's capacity to fully express. Yet the very attempt to express, the very acknowledgment of inadequacy, is itself the perfect expression. The characteristic is this non-humble humility: not pretending to be less than one is, not denying one's capacity, but the genuine recognition that capacity and incapacity are themselves the display of what they seem to limit.

The lakṣaṇa is this: measure and immeasurability, speech and silence, completion and openness—not sequential stages in an expressive process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which expression could appear as something that succeeds or fails. The All-Knowing teaching is not beyond expression but the pointer to what was never in need of expression, never separate from the speech that was always already complete in its incompleteness.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Jewel treasure—not wealth, not riches, but the inexhaustible source that is never depleted.

Garland of qualities—not attributes, not characteristics, but the endless display that never repeats.

Not possible to measure—not vast, not infinite, but the recognition that measurement was always measuring itself.

Little spoken—not insufficient, not incomplete, but the recognition that there is nothing more to say.

Eloquence—not skill, not talent, but the natural expression that never departs from what is.

Ultimate—not final, not highest, but the recognition that there was never any journey, never any destination.

Subject of speech—not topic, not theme, but the inexhaustible that is never exhausted by speaking.

Complete—not finished, not done, but the recognition that there was never anything incomplete.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

All-knowing excellent-teaching jewel-of treasure like-of
Qualities garland measure-to not possible although
Little spoken this-by my eloquence also
Ultimate not if spoken-subject how complete
