## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

This extremely pure ambrosia of excellent explanation
From the All-Knowing Lama, that perfect Buddha,
The supreme doctrine from scripture, spoken from his mouth—
Those who do not know this are like cattle in a pen.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

All-Knowing Lama's quality surpasses Buddha's teaching—ambrosia manifests as extreme purity without immortality, without substance, without conferring deathlessness. Purity purifies without purification, achieving without achievement, completing without completion. Buddha perfects without perfection, manifesting as Buddha without Buddhanature.

Explained meaning explains without explaining—meaning renders without rendering, communicates without transmission from speaker to hearer. All-Knowing knows without knower, possessing without possessor, knowing without knowledge. Omniscience manifests as the knowing that knows all knowing simultaneously.

Supreme doctrine scriptures without containing—scripture texts without textual vessel, doctrine without doctrinal content. Mouth speaks without vocalization, sounds without source, commands without ordering. Speaking transmits without transmission, yet transmission transmits itself.

Those who do not know appear as cattle in pen—cattle pen without enclosure, confinement without barrier, limitation without limiting. Not-knowing manifests as knowing knowing itself as not-knowing, ignorance clarifying itself as clarity. Pen writes without writer, encloses without enclosing, frees without liberator.

The distinction between knowing and not-knowing never arose—knower dissolves into knowing, known dissolves into knowing, ignorance dissolves into clarity. Pen and non-pen, enclosure and openness, cattle and non-cattle: these opposites collapse into recognition that was never divided.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Ambrosia purity—purity purifying itself.

Explained meaning—meaning meaning itself.

Perfect Buddha—Buddha buddhahooding itself.

Supreme doctrine—doctrine doctrinating itself.

Mouth speaking—speech speaking itself.

Command scripture—scripture scripting itself.

Pen knowledge—knowledge knowing itself as ignorance.

Not-knowing knowing—knowing knowing itself as not-knowing.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

All-knowing Lama perfect Buddha that-of
Excellent-explained ambrosia extremely pure this
Scripture of doctrine supreme mouth-from spoken command
Not-know that cow ox-enclosure possessing
