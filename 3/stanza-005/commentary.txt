## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

All-Knowing Lama's quality surpasses Buddha's teaching—ambrosia manifests as extreme purity without immortality, without substance, without conferring deathlessness. Purity purifies without purification, achieving without achievement, completing without completion. Buddha perfects without perfection, manifesting as Buddha without Buddhanature.

Explained meaning explains without explaining—meaning renders without rendering, communicates without transmission from speaker to hearer. All-Knowing knows without knower, possessing without possessor, knowing without knowledge. Omniscience manifests as the knowing that knows all knowing simultaneously.

Supreme doctrine scriptures without containing—scripture texts without textual vessel, doctrine without doctrinal content. Mouth speaks without vocalization, sounds without source, commands without ordering. Speaking transmits without transmission, yet transmission transmits itself.

Those who do not know appear as cattle in pen—cattle pen without enclosure, confinement without barrier, limitation without limiting. Not-knowing manifests as knowing knowing itself as not-knowing, ignorance clarifying itself as clarity. Pen writes without writer, encloses without enclosing, frees without liberator.

The distinction between knowing and not-knowing never arose—knower dissolves into knowing, known dissolves into knowing, ignorance dissolves into clarity. Pen and non-pen, enclosure and openness, cattle and non-cattle: these opposites collapse into recognition that was never divided.
