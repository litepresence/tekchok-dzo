## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through essential extraction. "When the experience of realized awareness dynamic blazes" indicates the condition of advanced practice as luminosity. Awareness dynamic (rig rtsal) is not power but the natural display of what is never apart from itself. Realization (rtogs pa) is not achievement but the recognition of what was never absent. Experience (nyams myong) is not event but the immediate presence. Blazing ('bar ba) is not intensity but the luminous nature that is never dimmed. The characteristic is this non-experiencing experience: not that there is something to experience, but that the experiencing is itself what is sought.

"Please look at these excellent scriptures" indicates the turning of attention from the blazing to what is always already present. The imperative is not an increase of experience but the recognition that the blazing is itself the ground. These excellent scriptures are not instructions for development but the extraction that reveals there was never anything to develop. The characteristic is this non-developing development: not cultivating experiences, not increasing luminosity, but direct recognition that there was never any lack, never anything that needed development.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the essential extraction" indicates non-abiding as recognition of freedom. Essential (gnad) is not important but the very core of what is. Extraction (bog 'don) is not removal but the recognition of what is always already free. The characteristic is this non-extracting extraction: not that something is removed, but that the unbound is recognized in what appeared bound.

"That points out equality in the expanse of Dharmakaya" indicates the function of wisdom as direct introduction. Dharmakaya (chos sku) is not a body but the ultimate nature. Expanse (klong) is not space but the non-localized nature. Equality (mnyam nyid) is not sameness but the recognition that all distinctions are equal. Pointing out (ngo sprod) is not instruction but direct recognition. The characteristic is this non-pointing pointing: not indicating something else, but recognizing that there was never anything to indicate, never anything apart from what is.

The lakṣaṇa is this: experience and ground, blazing and natural luminosity, extraction and always-already-free—not sequential stages in a developmental process but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework within which progress could appear as real. The All-Knowing teaching is not superior extraction but the pointer to what was never in need of extraction, never separate from the Dharmakaya that was always already present.
