## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza proclaims the teaching as the ultimate treasury that ends cyclic existence through the authentic Dharma-body. "The Precious Dharma-realm, most profound of profundities"—the precious is not valuable, not jewel-like. The Dharma-realm is not dharmadhātu, not ultimate reality. The most profound is not deepest, not most difficult. The profundity is not depth, not obscurity. The lakṣaṇa is this: the precious that is not precious, the realm that is not realm, the profound that is not profound.

"The sole treasury of realization-blessed wisdom"—the sole is not only, not unique. The treasury is not storehouse, not repository. The realization-blessed is not graced, not empowered. The wisdom is not knowledge, not understanding. The lakṣaṇa is this: the sole that is not sole, the treasury that treasures without treasuring, the blessing that blesses without blesser, the wisdom that wises without wising.

"This teaching, like the actually arisen authentic Dharma-body"—the teaching is not instruction, not doctrine. The likeness is not comparison, not metaphor. The actual arising is not real manifestation, not true appearance. The authentic is not genuine, not true. The Dharma-body is not dharmakāya, not truth-body. The lakṣaṇa is this: the teaching that teaches without teacher, the arising that arises without ariser, the authentic that authenticates without authentic, the body that bodies without body.

"Whoever undertakes its practice makes this the final existence"—the whoever is not anyone, not a subject. The undertaking is not beginning, not engagement. The practice is not exercise, not application. The final is not last, not ultimate. The existence is not life, not being. The lakṣaṇa is this: the whoever that is not who, the practice that practices without practicer, the final that finalizes without final, the existence that exists without exist.
