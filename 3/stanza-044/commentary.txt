## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the soaring flight of the great Garuḍa. "By the wing-flutter of partial knowledge like a bee" indicates the limitation of fragmentary understanding. The bee, though industrious, moves from flower to flower gathering nectar without comprehending the garden's entirety. Partial knowledge (phyogs re'i rig pa) is not wrong but incomplete—it operates within a sector without recognizing the whole. The wing-flutter (gshog rlab) suggests frenetic activity that never rises above the immediate. The characteristic is this non-comprehensive fluttering: not that the bee is foolish, but that its mode of knowing cannot access the summit from which all directions are simultaneously visible.

"Desiring to wander the four continents, fruitless, a mere spectator" indicates the endless circulation of partial knowing without arrival. The four continents (gling bzhi) represent all possible worlds, all domains of experience. To desire to wander them is to perpetuate the root separation that makes experience appear as external to the experiencer. Fruitless ('bras med) indicates that this wandering generates no liberative recognition because it never questions the position of the wanderer. The characteristic is this non-fruitful spectacle: not that the viewer sees nothing, but that seeing never transforms into recognition because the seer remains unexamined.

"Having reached the peak of Meru, the Vajra Essence" indicates non-abiding as the recognition from the summit. Meru (ri rab) is the cosmic mountain at the center of all worlds, the point from which all directions are equally visible. The Vajra Essence (rdo rje snying po) is not a thing found at the summit but the recognition that is the summit—the unbreakable, ungraspable nature of mind itself. Reaching this peak is not an achievement but the cessation of all partial reaching, all sectoral fluttering. The characteristic is this non-reached summit: not a destination arrived at, but the recognition that there was never any distance to travel.

"Clearly showing the nine vehicles, like the great Garuḍa King" indicates non-abiding as the spontaneous display of complete perspective. The nine vehicles (theg dgu) represent all possible paths, from the most provisional to the most profound. To show them clearly (gsal ston) is not to catalog them but to reveal their inseparability from the perspective that views them. The great Garuḍa (khyung chen) is the mythical bird that soars above all worlds, needing no ground, carrying the summit with it. The characteristic is this non-grounded soaring: not freedom from gravity but the recognition that gravity was never binding, that the ground was never separate from the sky.

The lakṣaṇa is this: bee and Garuḍa, fluttering and soaring, partial and complete—not a hierarchy of better and worse but a recognition that what the bee seeks in every flower is already the Garuḍa's view, already present, never elsewhere. The Vajra Essence is not a higher teaching but the recognition that all teachings point to what is already the case.
