## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

Good fortune produces great joy without producing—fortune unfolds without acquisition, without accumulation, without cause or condition. Joy emerges without emotion, without generation, without becoming a state to be produced. The producing produces without making, creates without creation, generating what was never absent.

Seeing Buddha develops certainty without developing—certainty establishes without conviction, without building confidence, without growth toward completion. Seeing perceives without perception, observes without observation, seeing visible form without form to be seen. Buddha appears without being, manifests without entity, appears to sight without sight appearing to sight.

Excellent explanation seeing exceeds meeting Buddha—seeing explanation reads without reading words, comprehends without comprehending meaning. Explanation mediates without medium, bridges without bridging, understanding without understanding. All-Knowing Lama explains without explaining, clarifies without clarifying, sources without being source. Meeting Buddha encounters without encounter, meets without meeting between beings, keeps appointments without appointments being kept.

The "more" transcends comparison—quantity without comparative measure, superiority without superiority over, experience without experiences to compare. The seeing sees no Buddha yet sees Buddha seeing itself. The meeting meets no one yet meets meeting itself. The certainty certain of nothing yet certain of certainty itself. Joy rejoices without cause yet joy causes rejoicing without cause.
