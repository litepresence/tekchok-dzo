## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza reiterates non-abiding through the peacock playing with poison. The emphasis is on transforming what seems dangerous into a field of revelation. Lakṣaṇa: the poison-play reveals nondual ground; the poison reveals the nectar; the play reveals the knowledge that there was never a separate other.
