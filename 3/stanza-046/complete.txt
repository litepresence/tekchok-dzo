## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When delusion, ignorance, and doubt arise,
Look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the sword of wisdom
That cuts through the net of delusion.
༤༦

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza presents the teaching as a sword of wisdom that severs the net of delusion at the very moment of its arising. "When delusion, ignorance, and doubt arise"—the when is not temporal occurrence, not sequential happening. The delusion is not error, not misconception. The ignorance is not absence of knowledge, not darkness. The doubt is not uncertainty, not hesitation. The arising is not origination, not production. The lakṣaṇa is this: the when that whens without when, the delusion that deludes without deluder, the ignorance that ignores without ignorer, the doubt that doubts without doubter, the arising that arises without ariser.

"Look at these excellent scriptures"—the looking is not seeing, not visual perception. The these is not particularization, not selection. The excellent is not superior quality, not refined nature. The scriptures are not texts, not writings. The lakṣaṇa is this: the look that looks without looker, the these that theses without thesing, the excellent that excels without excelling, the scripture that scriptures without scripturing.

"The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the sword of wisdom"—the all-knowing is not omniscience, not complete knowledge. The excellent teaching is not superior doctrine, not refined instruction. The sword is not weapon, not blade. The wisdom is not understanding, not insight. The lakṣaṇa is this: the all-knowing that all-knows without all-knower, the teaching that teaches without teacher, the sword that swords without sword, the wisdom that wisdoms without wisdom.

"That cuts through the net of delusion"—the cutting is not severance, not division. The through is not penetration, not traversal. The net is not mesh, not entanglement. The delusion is not confusion, not bewilderment. The lakṣaṇa is this: the cut that cuts without cutter, the through that throughs without through, the net that nets without net, the delusion that deludes without deluder.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Delusion arising—not obstacle, not enemy, but the very condition that makes recognition possible, the occasion for wisdom's display.

Ignorance—not absence to be filled, not darkness to be illuminated, but the recognition that what appears as absent is already present.

Doubt—not uncertainty to be resolved, not confusion to be clarified, but the movement of mind that can recognize its own nature.

Look at these scriptures—not study, not analysis, but direct recognition of what is immediately present, what requires no preparation.

Sword of wisdom—not weapon, not destruction, but precision of recognition that severs the root of separation without residue.

Net of delusion—not external constraint, not imposed bondage, but the self-generated web that dissolves when recognized as never woven.

Cutting through—not escape, not liberation achieved, but recognition that there was never any net, never any entanglement, never anything to be freed from.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Delusion-ignorance doubt arise time
Scripture-excellent these look please
Delusion-of net what by cut will
All-knowing excellent-teaching wisdom sword is
