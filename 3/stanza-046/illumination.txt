## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Delusion arising—not obstacle, not enemy, but the very condition that makes recognition possible, the occasion for wisdom's display.

Ignorance—not absence to be filled, not darkness to be illuminated, but the recognition that what appears as absent is already present.

Doubt—not uncertainty to be resolved, not confusion to be clarified, but the movement of mind that can recognize its own nature.

Look at these scriptures—not study, not analysis, but direct recognition of what is immediately present, what requires no preparation.

Sword of wisdom—not weapon, not destruction, but precision of recognition that severs the root of separation without residue.

Net of delusion—not external constraint, not imposed bondage, but the self-generated web that dissolves when recognized as never woven.

Cutting through—not escape, not liberation achieved, but recognition that there was never any net, never any entanglement, never anything to be freed from.
