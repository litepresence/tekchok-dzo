00001| Arising spontaneous—not sudden, not unexpected, but the natural display that never departs from its source.
00002| Experience—not occurrence, but the immediate recognition that never leaves its ground.
00003| Appearances—not forms, not objects, but the display that reveals what was never hidden.
00004| Rushing—not haste, not urgency, but the abundant manifestation that never depletes its source.
00005| Attachment-less—not detached, not separate, but the recognition that there was never anything to attach to.
00006| Discipline—not restraint, not control, but the natural conduct that never requires coercion.
00007| Vajra spontaneous song—not melody, not chant, but the self-arising expression that never departs from reality.
