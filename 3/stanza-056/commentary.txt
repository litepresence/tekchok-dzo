## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the vajra spontaneous song, with an emphasis on the simultaneous emergence of display and ground. The lakṣaṇa rests on the non-arising arising: the happening itself is the non-happening, the natural display that never moves from its source.

Lakṣaṇa: rushing and stillness, spontaneous and natural, song and silence—not sequential stages but simultaneous recognitions that collapse the framework that would treat experience as something to manage.
