## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza maps the teaching across the three realms with a concise, non-dual frame. Spontaneous majesty mirrors Mount Meru of the ten virtues in the desire realm—not as geography but as recognition that transcends boundaries. The formless realm hosts peaceful concentration; the form realm hosts Akanishtha; all are seen as facets of a single non-dual field. Lakṣaṇa: the mountain that is not a mountain, the virtue that is not virtue, the realm that is not realm.

Spreading hosts of peaceful concentration clouds signals that extension is not in space but in awareness; clouds are the unfoldment of recognition, not atmospheric phenomena. The nine vehicles are not a taxonomy but the unity of vehicles perceived non-dually. Lakṣaṇa remains: division that divides without dividing; one that is many; many that is one.

The three realms are not separate ontologies; they are natural expressions of the same inseparable awareness. Lakṣaṇa: the teaching that teaches the three realms as the three realms teaching; the excellent that excels as the non-dual, without existence existing or peace peacing.
