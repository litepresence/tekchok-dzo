## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

Spontaneously majestic like Mount Meru of the ten virtues in the desire realm,
Spreading hosts of peaceful concentration clouds in the formless realm,
Possessing the completed Akanistha of the noble path in the form realm—
These excellent teachings are like the three realms of existence.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza maps the teaching across the three realms with a concise, non-dual frame. Spontaneous majesty mirrors Mount Meru of the ten virtues in the desire realm—not as geography but as recognition that transcends boundaries. The formless realm hosts peaceful concentration; the form realm hosts Akanishtha; all are seen as facets of a single non-dual field. Lakṣaṇa: the mountain that is not a mountain, the virtue that is not virtue, the realm that is not realm.

Spreading hosts of peaceful concentration clouds signals that extension is not in space but in awareness; clouds are the unfoldment of recognition, not atmospheric phenomena. The nine vehicles are not a taxonomy but the unity of vehicles perceived non-dually. Lakṣaṇa remains: division that divides without dividing; one that is many; many that is one.

The three realms are not separate ontologies; they are natural expressions of the same inseparable awareness. Lakṣaṇa: the teaching that teaches the three realms as the three realms teaching; the excellent that excels as the non-dual, without existence existing or peace peacing.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

00001| Boundless vehicles—not infinite, not unlimited, but the boundless that is the vehicle, the vehicle that is the boundless.
00002| Showing varieties—not display, not types, but the showing that is the variety, the variety that is the showing.
00003| Nine vehicles—not taxonomy, not hierarchy, but the nine that is the vehicle, the vehicle that is the nine.
00004| Mind-investigated path—not analysis, not road, but the mind that is the path, the path that is the mind.
00005| Cause and effect—not sequence, not relation, but the cause that is the effect, the effect that is the cause.
00006| Manifest luminous expanse—not visible, not illuminated, but the manifest that is the expanse, the expanse that is the manifest.
00007| Discarding and adopting—not rejection, not acceptance, but the discard that is the adopt, the adopt that is the discard.
00008| Exhausting—not depletion, not running out, but the exhaust that is the complete, the complete that is the exhaust.
00009| Both existence and peace—not two, not duality, but the both that is the neither, the neither that is the both.
00010| Excellent teachings—not comparison, not similarity, but the excellent that is the teaching, the teaching that is the excellent.
