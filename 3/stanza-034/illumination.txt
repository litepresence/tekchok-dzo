00002| Omniscient Lama's mind—not all-knowing, not intellect, but the mind that perceives omniscience within.
00003| Heart essence—not text, not teaching, but the heart that contains essence.
00004| Form—not shape, not appearance, but the form as awareness.
00005| The path—not method, not sequence, but the essence that is path.
00006| The great door—non-dual, no boundary, all doors together open.
