## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza uses the heart/corpse metaphor to articulate non-dual awareness: the naked heart is neither absence nor mere presence; the set of terms points to a unity that cannot be captured by ordinary polarities. The Vajra Essence is not an external tradition but the living form of realization appearing as words.

The line about the “other scholarly treatises” shows that superiority and competition drop away when the truth of non-dual awareness is seen. The heart and corpse metaphor reveals the futility of aesthetics as a source of truth; beauty and form do not make the truth, they express it when seen through the veil of conceptuality.

Lakṣaṇa: the knowing that knows without knower, the essence not essential, the path that paths without pathing; the heart that hearts without heart.
