## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza dissolves blessing and reception as separate acts, unbinding the blessing from any giver and withdrawal from any receiver. Ambrosia for the heart and the Victorious One's blessing are not substances or transmissions but openings that allow recognition to occur without a sender or a destination.

The shower of truth upon the mind is not a proposition verified, nor a surface that truth rests upon; it is showing itself within the fortunate mind, a mind that bears blessing as wisdom-in-action rather than as possession.

The ambrosia for the heart and the good meaning in excellent explanation likewise dissolve into the practice of seeing, where explanation is not a delivery of meaning but an unveiling of non-conceptual knowing.

This stanza presents supremacist medicine for wisdom as a mind-state that does not reside in a fixed object or state; supremacy is not rank but function through recognition. The lakṣaṇa remains: blessing that blesses without blesser, truth that shows without shower, heart that receives without reception, wisdom that knows without knower.

In short, nourishment becomes appearance, appearance becomes nourishment, and transmission dissolves into the recognition that there is no separate donor or recipient.
