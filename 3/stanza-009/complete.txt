## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The ambrosia for the heart, the blessing of the Victorious One,
Is indeed the shower of truth upon the mind of the fortunate.
The ambrosia for the heart, the good meaning in excellent explanation—
This itself is supreme as medicine for wisdom in the mind.
༡༠

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza dissolves blessing and reception as separate acts, unbinding the blessing from any giver and withdrawal from any receiver. Ambrosia for the heart and the Victorious One's blessing are not substances or transmissions but openings that allow recognition to occur without a sender or a destination.

The shower of truth upon the mind is not a proposition verified, nor a surface that truth rests upon; it is showing itself within the fortunate mind, a mind that bears blessing as wisdom-in-action rather than as possession.

The ambrosia for the heart and the good meaning in excellent explanation likewise dissolve into the practice of seeing, where explanation is not a delivery of meaning but an unveiling of non-conceptual knowing.

This stanza presents supremacist medicine for wisdom as a mind-state that does not reside in a fixed object or state; supremacy is not rank but function through recognition. The lakṣaṇa remains: blessing that blesses without blesser, truth that shows without shower, heart that receives without reception, wisdom that knows without knower.

In short, nourishment becomes appearance, appearance becomes nourishment, and transmission dissolves into the recognition that there is no separate donor or recipient.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Heart ambrosia—not nourishment, not sustenance, but ambrosia that is heart, blessing that is ambrosia.

Victorious blessing—not transmission, not bestowal, but blessing that is Victorious One, Victorious that is blessing.

Truth shower—not display, not revelation, but shower that is truth, truth that is showing.

Fortunate mind—not surface, not field, but mind that is fortune, fortune that is mind.

Good meaning—not interpretation, not understanding, but meaning that is good, explanation that is meaning.

Heart ambrosia—not reward, not sustenance, but ambrosia that is heart, meaning that is ambrosia.

Supreme medicine—not rank, not hierarchy, but supreme that is medicine, wisdom that is supreme.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Victorious-One's blessing heart-of ambrosia is
Fortune-good mind in truth show is
Excellent-explained meaning-good heart-of ambrosia is
Mind in wisdom medicine this itself great
