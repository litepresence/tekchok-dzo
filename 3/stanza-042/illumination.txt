Logic's treatises—not wrong, not to reject, but recognized as operating within a system that never enclosed what is.

Thorough analysis—not fruitless, but fruitful in the wrong direction, proliferating what was never other than proliferation itself.

Deluded conceptions growing—not an enemy to defeat, but the inevitable display of a position that was never taken.

All-Knowing Lama's scripture—not another view to adopt, but the showing of what has no position, no stance, no view.

Beyond mind—not distant, not difficult, but immediate, already here, never approached because never departed from.

One word heard—not magical, not powerful in itself, but the occasion for recognition, the trigger that reveals what was never hidden.

Effortless samādhi—not achieved, not entered, but recognized as the nature of what never wandered, never needed gathering.
