## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the contrast between proliferating analysis and effortless recognition. "Other treatises of logic, analyzed thoroughly" indicates not a rejection of intelligence but the recognition that conceptual proliferation (rtog pa) operates within a closed system. The more thoroughly one analyzes within that system, the more deluded conceptual thoughts increase—not because analysis is wrong, but because it reinforces the framework within which delusion appears as real. The characteristic is this non-liberating thoroughness: not that analysis fails, but that it succeeds within a system that was never the nature of mind.

"As much as viewed, deluded conceptions grow" indicates the automatic nature of conceptual proliferation when the root of separation is not recognized. Deluded conceptions are not errors to be corrected but the inevitable fruit of viewing from a position that was never established. The characteristic is this non-viewing nature of viewing—not that one should stop looking, but that looking from a fixed position generates what it seeks to escape.

"The All-Knowing Lama's scripture, showing what is beyond mind" indicates non-abiding as what cannot be approached through the instrument that approaches. Beyond mind (blo las 'das) is not a distant transcendence but the recognition that mind never was the measure of what is. The Lama's scripture points not to something hidden but to the unobscured nature of what already appears. The characteristic is this non-distant beyond—not somewhere else, not something else, but the absence of any position from which "beyond" could be measured.

"Even one word heard generates effortless samādhi" indicates non-abiding as the non-production of meditative absorption. Effortless (rtsol med) is not ease as opposed to difficulty but the absence of any agent who could make effort. Samādhi generated without effort is not a state achieved but the recognition that there was never any state to achieve, never any wavering from what is. The characteristic is this non-generated generation—not that effort is abandoned, but that effort never arose as a possibility because there was never anyone to make it.

The lakṣaṇa is this: treatises of logic and Lama's scripture, analysis and recognition, effort and effortlessness—not opposed methodologies but the same gesture viewed from positions that either reinforce or dissolve the viewer. The dissolution is not an achievement but the recognition that there was never anything achieved, never anyone to achieve. Lakṣaṇa: nondual simultaneity, absence of ground for wavering.
