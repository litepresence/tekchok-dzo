## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

Victorious Ones appear as victory itself—victory without victor, conquering without conquest. Bodhisattva sons manifest as recognition without lineage, heirs without inheritance, greatness without dimension. The relationship between Victorious Ones and sons dissolves into recognition itself, appearing as multiplicity without division.

Heroic going goes nowhere yet arrives everywhere—heroism manifests as courage without courageous one, as movement without mover. Concentration gathers without gathering, liberates without liberating. The power of liberation liberates liberation itself, exercising power without power-holder, applying force without force-applier.

Four noble ones appear without fourness—nobility manifests as diversity without division, as birth without birth. Emanation forms form without forming, appear without appearing. The showing of activity shows itself—activity accomplishes without accomplishment, excellence excels without excelling. Every demonstration demonstrates demonstration itself.
