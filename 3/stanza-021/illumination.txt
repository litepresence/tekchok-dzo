Eighty-four thousand dharmas—this expanse without boundary, without number, without accumulation.

Gathered as one—not reduced but recognized, not condensed but revealed, the many never having departed from the one.

The treatise—words that are not about, words that do not refer, words that are what they speak, speaking without speaker.

All-Knowing Lama's teaching—not possessed wisdom, not transmitted knowledge, but the knowing itself taking form as these syllables.

Single verse—containing not by holding, expressing not by describing, the vastness fitting nowhere, the nowhere vast.

Why not?—because there is no it to contain, no container, no containing; only this verse already complete, already spoken, already heard.
