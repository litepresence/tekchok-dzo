## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The vast expanse of the eighty-four thousand dharmas,
When gathered as one, becomes the treatise that expresses them,
The excellent teachings of the All-Knowing Lama, this profound dharma—
Why should it not be contained in a single verse?

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the paradox of containment. The "eighty-four thousand dharmas" indicates not a numerical limit but the unbounded expanse of realization (rig pa'i klong) itself. This expanse does not pre-exist as a container waiting to be filled, nor does it arise through the gathering of dharmas. The gathering itself is the expanse; the expanse is the gathering. There is no separation between what is gathered and the space in which gathering occurs.

"When gathered as one, becomes the treatise" indicates that the treatise is not a reduction or condensation of the dharmas, but their complete expression without remainder. The treatise does not represent the dharmas; it is the dharmas appearing as words. The All-Knowing Lama's excellent teaching (legs bshad) is not commentary upon the dharmas but their direct utterance—not explanation but embodiment.

"Why should it not be contained in a single verse?" points to the characteristic of non-localization: the vast does not exclude the minute, nor the minute diminish the vast. The single verse is not a summary or abbreviation but the complete dharmas in their uncontracted form. The lakṣaṇa is this: there is nothing to be gathered, nothing that gathers, and no gathering—only the recognition that what appears as multiplicity was never separate from the single utterance that speaks it.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Eighty-four thousand dharmas—this expanse without boundary, without number, without accumulation.

Gathered as one—not reduced but recognized, not condensed but revealed, the many never having departed from the one.

The treatise—words that are not about, words that do not refer, words that are what they speak, speaking without speaker.

All-Knowing Lama's teaching—not possessed wisdom, not transmitted knowledge, but the knowing itself taking form as these syllables.

Single verse—containing not by holding, expressing not by describing, the vastness fitting nowhere, the nowhere vast.

Why not?—because there is no it to contain, no container, no containing; only this verse already complete, already spoken, already heard.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Eighty-four-thousand dharma-meaning realization expanse
Collected-into certain-if that-of express-doing treatise
All-knowing Lama-of excellent-teaching profound dharma
Word-verse one-to what-of reason-not gather
