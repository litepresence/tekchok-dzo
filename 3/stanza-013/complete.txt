## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The seven great treasuries of excellent explanation,
The complete doctrine, the single-life Buddha's dharma,
This profound path, a drop of wonder-nectar—
Who could disparage the speech of Omniscient Lama?

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza celebrates the comprehensive nature of the teaching. "The seven great treasuries of excellent explanation" refers not to a catalogue of works but to the inexhaustible richness of the teaching—treasury indicating not storage but overflowing abundance. The seven is complete completion, not a numerical limit but the fullness of what is given without measure.

"The complete doctrine, the single-life Buddha's dharma" indicates that the entire teaching is available in this immediate presentation, not distributed across time or requiring sequential accomplishment. The single life is not a biography but the singularity of this very moment of recognition—the life that is not one among many, but the non-duality of life and awakening.

"This profound path, a drop of wonder-nectar" collapses the distinction between vastness and concentration. The drop contains the ocean; the single word contains the complete teaching. The nectar is not medicinal in the sense of curing a disease that exists independently; it is the recognition that the disease was never other than the medicine, the patient never other than the physician.

The question "Who could disparage the speech of Omniscient Lama?" is not rhetorical in the conventional sense. It points to the impossibility of finding a position from which disparagement could occur. To disparage would require standing outside the teaching, but there is no outside—only the recognition that any apparent disparagement is itself the teaching appearing as denial.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Seven treasuries—not counted, not containing, but the overflow that cannot be held.

Excellent explanation—not explaining toward understanding, but the explanation itself complete.

Complete doctrine—never partial, never completing, never completed.

Single-life—not duration, not brevity, but the singularity of this recognition.

Drop of nectar—the ocean in the drop, not the drop in the ocean.

Who could disparage—not a challenge, but the recognition that no position exists outside.

The Lama's speech—not spoken to someone, not received by anyone.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Meaning-good excellent-explanation treasure great seven and-so-on
doctrine all-complete life single Buddha dharma
profound path wonder-arisen nectar drop this
all-knowing Lama's speech in who by disparage
