## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza celebrates the comprehensive nature of the teaching. "The seven great treasuries of excellent explanation" refers not to a catalogue of works but to the inexhaustible richness of the teaching—treasury indicating not storage but overflowing abundance. The seven is complete completion, not a numerical limit but the fullness of what is given without measure.

"The complete doctrine, the single-life Buddha's dharma" indicates that the entire teaching is available in this immediate presentation, not distributed across time or requiring sequential accomplishment. The single life is not a biography but the singularity of this very moment of recognition—the life that is not one among many, but the non-duality of life and awakening.

"This profound path, a drop of wonder-nectar" collapses the distinction between vastness and concentration. The drop contains the ocean; the single word contains the complete teaching. The nectar is not medicinal in the sense of curing a disease that exists independently; it is the recognition that the disease was never other than the medicine, the patient never other than the physician.

The question "Who could disparage the speech of Omniscient Lama?" is not rhetorical in the conventional sense. It points to the impossibility of finding a position from which disparagement could occur. To disparage would require standing outside the teaching, but there is no outside—only the recognition that any apparent disparagement is itself the teaching appearing as denial.
