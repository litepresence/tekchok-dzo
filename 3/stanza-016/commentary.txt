## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza knots the historical awakening to the teaching in the present moment. The tree-power trunk marks a recognition that is always available, not a singular historical site. The trunk is the support that is not separate from what it supports—recognition itself.

What the Victorious Sons saw as true attests that the seeing of the sages is not different in essence from the seeing we now point to. It is the same recognition, appearing under different circumstances.

A single word of the All-knowing Lama’s excellent speech collapses the distinction between breadth and depth; utterance is not a separate act but the recognition happening through sound or silence. The idea of skilful means is not a method but the understanding that all means serve the same revelation.

This seeing is shown as inexpressible meaning through skilful means—expression’s limit is the form through which recognition passes, not a barrier to truth. The lakṣaṇa: the field of merit is not a collection of texts but the teaching itself, inviting immediate recognition.
