Mental investigation—not analysis, not inquiry, but the endless searching that obscures what is never hidden.

Thought—not cognition, not understanding, but the movement that never reaches what is always already present.

Partiality—not bias, not prejudice, but the inevitable result of the discriminating mind that divides what is whole.

Desire—not wanting, not craving, but the fundamental movement away from what is toward what seems to be elsewhere.

Iron fetters—not bonds, not chains, but the apparent constraints that were never binding anything.

True grasping—not wrong view, not error, but the conviction that something is true that is only apparently so.

Philosophical views—not positions, not doctrines, but the endless proliferation of frameworks that obscure the frameless.

Key—not tool, not instrument, but the recognition that there was never any lock, never anything to open.

Method—not technique, not procedure, but the natural functioning of wisdom that is never apart from what is.
