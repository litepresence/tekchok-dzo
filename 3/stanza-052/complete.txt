## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

When partiality and desire arise from mental investigation and thought,
Please look at these excellent scriptures,
The All-Knowing excellent teaching is the key of method
That liberates the iron fetters of grasping at true philosophical views.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This batch tightens non-abiding through the key of method, emphasizing the non-seeking aspect of understanding. The mind’s partial investigations exist as a display within a larger non-dual field; the key is that method reveals and dissolves itself as the ground of recognition. Lakṣaṇa: method as appearance, knowledge as display, and the realization that there was never a separate method to master.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Mental investigation—not analysis, not inquiry, but the endless searching that obscures what is never hidden.

Thought—not cognition, not understanding, but the movement that never reaches what is always already present.

Partiality—not bias, not prejudice, but the inevitable result of the discriminating mind that divides what is whole.

Desire—not wanting, not craving, but the fundamental movement away from what is toward what seems to be elsewhere.

Iron fetters—not bonds, not chains, but the apparent constraints that were never binding anything.

True grasping—not wrong view, not error, but the conviction that something is true that is only apparently so.

Philosophical views—not positions, not doctrines, but the endless proliferation of frameworks that obscure the frameless.

Key—not tool, not instrument, but the recognition that there was never any lock, never anything to open.

Method—not technique, not procedure, but the natural functioning of wisdom that is never apart from what is.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Mental-investigation thought-of partiality-desire arisen when
Scripture-excellent these look please
True-grasping philosophical-view-of iron-fetters liberate do
All-knowing excellent-teaching method-of key is
