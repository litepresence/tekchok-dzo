## Translator's Illumination (ngo sprod)

Moment of meeting—no duration, no sequence, this instant outside of time, already complete.

Mind of faith—not believing but recognizing, not hoping but seeing, faith as the seeing itself.

Longing arises—heart's devotion not to another, not from distance, but the recognition that distance never was.

Afflictions released—not purified, not transformed, but seen through, seen as never having been.

Obscurations parted—not removed but revealed as transparency, never having blocked what they seemed to hide.

Liberation through seeing—the seeing is the freedom, the freedom is the seeing, no two, no process, no path between.

This teaching—not words about liberation but liberation as word, freedom speaking itself, seeing recognizing itself.
