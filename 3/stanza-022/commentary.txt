## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza enacts non-abiding through the immediacy of liberation through seeing (mthong grol). "Even meeting for a moment with a mind of faith" indicates not a duration of time but the timelessness of recognition—the moment that is not a segment within time but the collapse of temporal sequence. Faith here is not belief in something unseen but the direct recognition of what is already present, requiring no duration to establish itself.

"In whoever's heart longing devotion arises" points to the arising that is not conditioned by prior causes. The longing (gdung ba) is not a reaction to separation but the recognition that separation never occurred. This devotion is not directed toward an object; it is the heart's natural response to recognizing its own nature. The one in whom this arises is not a subject experiencing an emotion; the arising itself clarifies the nature of the one in whom it arises.

"Afflictions and obscurations are spontaneously released" indicates not a process of purification but the recognition that afflictions never had the solidity they appeared to possess. The force (shugs) that releases them is not an external power but the natural state itself, which has always been free of affliction. There is no one who releases, nothing released, and no act of releasing—only the recognition that obscurations were never anything other than the clarity they seemed to obscure.

"Liberation through seeing" indicates that liberation is not achieved but recognized. The seeing is the liberation; the liberation is the seeing. There is no interval between seeing and being free, no practice that bridges them, no maturation that brings them together. The lakṣaṇa is this: the non-arising of bondage itself, seen directly without intermediary.
