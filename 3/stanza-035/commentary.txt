## Translator's Commentary (grel pa don 'grel)

This stanza expresses non-dual realization without reliance on metaphor. The Vajra Essence song, the portrait of realization, and the realization itself are seen as different expressions of the same nondual field. Lakṣaṇa: the song that sings without a singer; the portrait that portrays without a portrayer; the essence that is not essential.
