## 1. Liturgical Rendering (mchod brjod tshig; Skt. stotra-pada)

The Muni's beautiful body, like a mountain of gold,
That is indeed the special characteristic of seeing form-body,
The dharma-nature's self-nature, impossible to express—
This alone is the fortune of seeing dharmakAya.

## 2. Commentary ('grel pa don 'grel; Skt. lakṣaṇa-nirdeśa)

This stanza aligns form-body and dharma-body as modes of recognition, not discrete entities. The Muni's beautiful body, like a mountain of gold, signals appearance as appearance—gold in the form of perception, not substance.

That is indeed the special characteristic of seeing form-body: the form-body is not an object perceived by a subject but the very characteristic of perception itself. The seeing is the body; the body is the seeing. There is no body that exists independently of being seen, no seeing that occurs independently of what appears.

The dharma-nature's self-nature, impossible to express, points to what cannot be captured in expression—not because it is hidden or subtle, but because expression is itself a mode of this nature. The impossibility of expression is not a limitation but the nature of expression itself, which never succeeds in capturing because there is nothing to capture, no one to capture it.

This alone is the fortune of seeing dharmakaya: the recognition that there is no one who sees, nothing seen, no seeing—yet the seeing occurs, unmistakably, without witness.

## 3. Illumination (ngo sprod; Skt. svarūpa-prakāśa)

Golden mountain—not gold becoming mountain, not mountain appearing as gold.

Beautiful body—not possessing beauty, not reflecting it.

Form-body—the seeing itself, not the seen.

Impossible to express—not withholding expression, not awaiting better words.

Dharma-nature's self-nature—never hidden, never revealed.

This alone—not exclusion of other things, but the recognition that there are no other things.

Fortune of seeing—not merit, not reward, not special capacity.

Dharmakaya—never seen, never unseen, never the object of seeing.

## 4. Literal Translation ('gyur don bsgyur; Skt. artha-anuvāda)

Muni's beautiful-body gold of mountain like
form-body seeing-of special-characteristic that is indeed
dharma-nature self-nature express toward impossible showing
dharma-body seeing-of fortunate-ones this only is
