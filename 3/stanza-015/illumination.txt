00001| Golden mountain—not gold becoming mountain, not mountain appearing as gold.
00002| Beautiful body—not possessing beauty, not reflecting it.
00003| Form-body—the seeing itself, not the seen.
00004| Impossible to express—not withholding expression, not awaiting better words.
00005| Dharma-nature's self-nature—never hidden, never revealed.
00006| This alone—not exclusion of other things, but the recognition that there are no other things.
00007| Fortune of seeing—not merit, not reward, not special capacity.
00008| Dharmakaya—never seen, never unseen, never the object of seeing.
