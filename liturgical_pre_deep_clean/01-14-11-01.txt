[20147] <prose> First, threefold:
[20148] <prose> Ground, path, and result.
[20149] <prose> First, regarding ground: within the space of the heart center dwell fivefold aggregates of light within space
[20150] <prose> The resonance of the vital channel, the channel of light abiding therein, is Awareness.
[20151] <prose> From the potency of the complete lion
[20152] <prose> Comes the ground-abiding Space and Awareness
[20153] <prose> The path-appearance Space and Awareness
[20154] <prose> And the fruition-conveying Space and Awareness. || 10 ||
[20155] <prose> These twofold Space and Awareness of the ground:
[20156] <prose> Space is the lamp of space
[20157] <prose> Awareness is clear as the vital channel.
[20158] <prose> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20159] <prose> The space of the path dwells in the fortress of five lights
[20160] <prose> Within the channels of the nadis, the body-appearance arises
[20161] <prose> From that very source
[20162] <prose> The path-appearance Space and Awareness
[20163] <prose> Space is the surrounding circumference of light
[20164] <prose> Awareness is taught as the appearance of the five bodies. || 20 ||
[20165] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[20166] <prose> The space of result is original purity's self-appearance, cloudless as the sky
[20167] <prose> Wherein Awareness dissolves internally into that space, appearing only as ground
[20168] <prose> Abiding thus
[20169] <prose> From that very nature
[20170] <prose> The fruition-conveying Space and Awareness
[20171] <prose> Space is self-nature appearance
[20172] <prose> Awareness is shown as body and essence.
[20173] <prose> Therefore Space and Awareness are thus explained.
[20174] <prose> Thus it is declared.
[20175] <prose> To distinguish this essential point of Space and Awareness is supremely precious. || 30 ||
[20176] <prose> Second, the actual measure:
[20177] <prose> Again, from that very source
[20178] <prose> The certain secret meaning of Primordial Wisdom
[20179] <prose> When appearances arise as fragmentary moments
[20180] <prose> The skilled practitioner must thoroughly investigate.
[20181] <prose> When exceedingly subtle movements occur
[20182] <prose> Through familiarity, one must thoroughly abide.
[20183] <prose> When flickering, subtle movements arise
[20184] <prose> Through seeing, one must thoroughly grasp.
[20185] <prose> When rounding, subtle swirling occurs
[20186] <prose> The skilled practitioner maintains absorption free from distraction. || 40 ||
[20187] <prose> When flashing, flaming, bodies appear
[20188] <prose> Through familiarity, grasp non-existent appearances.
[20189] <prose> When all things truly appear
[20190] <prose> The skilled practitioner is taught to gather appearances.
[20191] <prose> When attachment and fixation are absent
[20192] <prose> The skilled practitioner must know the method of grasping.
[20193] <prose> Such are the characteristics of Secret Mantra familiarity.
[20194] <prose> Then, when Primordial Wisdom is stirred
[20195] <prose> The five elements dissolve and become
[20196] <prose> That Primordial Wisdom without attachment. || 50 ||
[20197] <prose> When appearances reach their object
[20198] <prose> Seeing appearances free from delusion
[20199] <prose> When seeing the truth of familiarity
[20200] <prose> Light-appearance union is explained as the view.
[20201] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[20202] <prose> Moreover, when those path-appearance appearances dissolve internally into space
[20203] <prose> The five ultimate elements—warmth, coolness, and so forth—also pervade the expanse of space
[20204] <prose> Elements unsinking
[20205] <prose> Pristine cognition pervading the expanse
[20206] <prose> Wisdom pervading space, pristine cognition moving through the expanse—this definite intention of time and measure. || 60 ||
[20207] <prose> The extensive explanation of the nature of that pristine cognition.
[20208] <prose> Third:
[20209] <prose> The divisions through definite examples
[20210] <prose> And divisions through definite meaning.
[20211] <prose> First.
