[19975] <prose> First.
[19976] <prose> With unwavering eyes in the gaze of interwoven rigpa
[19977] <prose> In that state undistracted through meditation
[19978] <prose> Through conduct in the appearances of interwoven display
[19979] <prose> The stable result of sphere awareness
[19980] <prose> From the Norbu Phra khod
[19981] <prose> In that great manner of abiding
[19982] <verse> The meaning of view is interwoven
[19983] <verse> Though dharmas appearing are numberless
[19984] <verse> In the meaning of reality they are not one || 10 ||
[19985] <verse> E ma the yogin of the continuum of view
[19986] <verse> Looks upon that meaning as changeless
[19987] <verse> That also is the body of interwoven display
[19988] <verse> Directly appearing yet difficult to grasp
[19989] <verse> In that very essence of awareness
[19990] <verse> The example of abiding nakedly without cessation
[19991] <verse> Like planets and stars arising
[19992] <verse> From the clear ocean
[19993] <verse> Without the time of latency
[19994] <verse> Abide as the great naked diversity || 20 ||
[19995] <verse> The yogin of the continuum of view
[19996] <verse> If undistracted in that meaning
[19997] <verse> Without latency and nonlatency
[19998] <verse> Day appearances and night subsiding
[19999] <verse> Are not existing as two appearances
[20000] <verse> The yogin of the continuum of conduct
[20001] <verse> Through the essence of interwoven display
[20002] <verse> If not liberated into the four times
[20003] <verse> Is the yogin of the continuum of conduct
[20004] <verse> Though without the continuum of meditation of selfawareness || 30 ||
[20005] <verse> The yogin of the continuum of meditation arises
[20006] <verse> In all times and nontimes
[20007] <verse> If not liberated from interwoven display
[20008] <verse> Is the yogin of the continuum of meditation
[20009] <prose> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20010] <prose> Second.
[20011] <prose> Also from that
[20012] <prose> E ma ho
[20013] <prose> The yogin of the continuum of view
[20014] <verse> Three kinds of error places exist || 40 ||
[20015] <verse> When looking at emptiness
[20016] <verse> Error into the four formless sense fields
[20017] <verse> Through looking at things as self
[20018] <verse> The seventeen locations of form realms
[20019] <verse> Become error as inert self
[20020] <verse> In the appearances of interwoven display
[20021] <verse> If thoroughly looking at permanence
[20022] <verse> Becoming bound by great attachment
[20023] <verse> Error becomes the locations of six realms
[20024] <verse> The yogin of the continuum of conduct || 50 ||
[20025] <verse> Three kinds of error places exist
[20026] <verse> In all appearances like this
[20027] <verse> If practiced like a crazy one
[20028] <verse> Error becomes demigod
[20029] <verse> If practiced as meaningless mute words
[20030] <verse> Error becomes view of self
[20031] <verse> In all appearances of six collections objects
[20032] <verse> If practiced like a child
[20033] <verse> Error into the undefined location
[20034] <verse> The yogin of the continuum of meditation || 60 ||
[20035] <verse> Three kinds of error places exist
[20036] <verse> If meditating selfless equanimity
[20037] <verse> Error as center darkness appearance
[20038] <verse> If meditating concentration letters
[20039] <verse> Error into the location of attached samsara
[20040] <verse> If meditating nonconceptual emptiness
[20041] <verse> Error as extreme limitless self
[20042] <verse> Though the cause of error is inconceivable
[20043] <verse> There is no great error place from that
[20044] <verse> No error place in interwoven display || 70 ||
[20045] <verse> Error appears in the continuum of path
[20046] <verse> In meaning not even one error place
[20047] <verse> Also cause and result designated
[20048] <verse> Spoken as reason to cut error places
[20049] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20050] <prose> Also that yogin who does not see the direct appearance of awareness and sees through mind path view meditation conduct result though dull power holds extreme grasping all have error places
[20051] <prose> That cut also
[20052] <prose> Having established looking at the gate of sense power together with the radiance of selfclear awareness
[20053] <prose> Free from extremes of conceptual discrimination of intellect existing or not existing
[20054] <prose> Self clear || 80 ||
[20055] <prose> Cutting error places is cutting the definite inner intention of selfdawn view
[20056] <tantra> From the Thalgyur.
[20057] <prose> Seeing the essence of view
[20058] <verse> Not moved by words of intellectual discrimination
[20059] <verse> Thus
[20060] <verse> Though meditating the thigle in the state of selfdawn selfappearing yet not gone into sudden grasping holding as vast open attachment expands producing the essence complete not distracted depth clear pristine cognition face grasp vast meditate no error place
[20061] <prose> From that
[20062] <prose> The meditation of nonerroneous abiding
[20063] <verse> Clear at all gates of sense power
[20064] <verse> Not moved by conceptual mind || 90 ||
[20065] <verse> Mind that discriminates knowing itself
[20066] <verse> Self not lost outwardly
[20067] <verse> Not of clear type and
[20068] <verse> Not gone into separated cut emptiness and
[20069] <verse> Not of bliss continuity and
[20070] <verse> Not gone into dull equanimity and
[20071] <verse> Resting in clear mindful awareness and
[20072] <verse> Not gone into reverse purification and
[20073] <verse> Easy to move grasping part inwardly and
[20074] <verse> The grasping part of clear manner and || 100 ||
[20075] <verse> All who transform color letter
[20076] <verse> If those not fallen into direction
[20077] <verse> The meditation of nonerroneous abiding
[20078] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20079] <verse> If conceptual movement arises in that state
[20080] <prose> Through conduct liberating whatever arises in the part of dual appearance of sense power appearing objects
[20081] <prose> That is cutting its error places
[20082] <prose> Spontaneously arisen arising spontaneously arisen liberating
[20083] <prose> Not entering there between into attachment of accepting and rejecting
[20084] <verse> Not meditating the benefit of showing face to face || 110 ||
[20085] <prose> Through liberating into awareness at the time when appearing there in the time of whatever appears
[20086] <prose> Suddenly dawned without type vast universally bubbled bubbled dawned not entering grasping part into dharmas of two
[20087] <prose> From Seng ge Tsal rdzogs
[20088] <prose> Great perfection ceaseless conduct itself
[20089] <verse> Not become through doing arising
[20090] <break> <verse> Attachmentless self liberated meeting three
[20091] <break> <verse> Thus
[20092] <verse> The result of self complete pristine cognition obtaining is great
[20093] <verse> Primordially not establishing
[20094] <prose> Through deciding by knowing this very fruit as selfabiding awareness seized ground made straying ground cut off || 120 ||
[20095] <prose> From that very
[20096] <prose> Great perfection familiarity indeed existing itself
[20097] <verse> Not arisen through familiarizing
[20098] <break> <verse> Change free thought free four arrived
[20099] <break> <verse> Difficult to realize the meaning of great perfection itself
[20100] <verse> Words of pointing out not found
[20101] <break> <verse> Instructions secret essence two arrived
[20102] <break> <verse> Great perfection awareness thought free itself
[20103] <verse> Not changing through familiarizing realizing

[20105] <break> <verse> Great perfection self arisen primordial wisdom itself
[20106] <verse> Not changing through accomplished accomplishing
[20107] <break> <verse> Certain essence two arrived
[20108] <break> <verse> Great perfection result single pointed itself
[20109] <verse> Not changing through produced complete
[20110] <break> <verse> Attachment free instructions three arrived
[20111] <break> <verse> Thus
[20112] <prose> Third.
[20113] <prose> Awareness and
[20114] <prose> Appearance two || 140 ||
[20115] <prose> Awareness looked at self resonance or recognized self arisen at the time called appearance doorway
[20116] <prose> At that time potency dissolved above ground clarity effusion without gathering spread wide relaxed blazing clear abiding
[20117] <verse> From the Jewel subtle array
[20118] <prose> Arisen through the doorway path
[20119] <verse> Dissolved into the mode of sky equal empty
[20120] <verse> Though primordial wisdom of meaning generally appears
[20121] <verse> Mode complete and mode arisen
[20122] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20123] <verse> Appearance emerged through doorway light and body and sphere etcetera
[20124] <prose> From that very || 150 ||
[20125] <prose> At the time of emerging through doorway
[20126] <verse> Wisdom body of space self nature

[20141] <verse> Meaning of self nature clear in the expanse of sky
[20142] <verse> That very light of mandala self complete
[20143] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20144] <verse> Fourth teaching time and measure certain || 170 ||
[20145] <prose> Showing distinction of ground space awareness and
[20146] <prose> Showing actual measure two
