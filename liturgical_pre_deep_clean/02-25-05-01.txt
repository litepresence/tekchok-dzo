[16436] <ornament> The First:
[16437] <prose> In Dharmatā, from the perspective of that upon which one looks, since the essence of any is not established, it is free from the extremes of elaboration;
[16438] <prose> Since it transcends the grasping of entity identity, it is without arising, ceasing, transference, or transformation;
[16439] <break> <prose> Since the ultimate is directly manifest, Dharmatā is inconceivable.
[16440] <break> <ornament> The Second:
[16441] <prose> Hence, the Dharmakāya pervading all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, possessing twofold purity—pure through the purification of adventitious stains—is That.
[16442] <tantra> From Hevajra:
[16443] <tantra> "Sentient beings are truly Buddhas,
[16444] <tantra> Yet obscured by adventitious stains.
[16445] <tantra> When these are cleared away, they are truly Buddhas." || 10 ||
[16446] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16447] <tantra> From Uttaratantra:
[16448] <verse> "The Perfect Buddha's Body is emanating,
[16449] <verse> Suchness is without distinction,
[16450] <verse> Because of possessing the Lineage, all sentient beings
[16451] <verse> Always possess the Essence of Buddhahood."
[16452] <verse> Thus the portion of direct manifestation is spoken.
[16453] <ornament> The Third:
[16454] <prose> Each vehicle demonstrates Rigpa,
[16455] <prose> Emptiness, || 20 ||
[16456] <prose> And qualities and so forth.
[16457] <prose> Here in the Great Perfection, if divided through miraculous display:
[16458] <prose> Dharmakāya's Dharmakāya fields—inconceivable;
[16459] <prose> Abode—Dharmatā transcending the mind's grasping;
[16460] <prose> Samādhi—great Immovable;
[16461] <prose> Retinue—various self-nature, non-dual;
[16462] <prose> Teaching—indescribable Dharmatā;
[16463] <prose> Time—Dharmatā without transformation at any time.
[16464] <prose> Dharmakāya's Saṃbhogakāya fields—free from dust, without stain;
[16465] <prose> Abode—memory, mind's thought self-dissolved; || 30 ||
[16466] <prose> Samādhi—cessation of mind and mental factors' arisings, wisdom self-abiding;
[16467] <prose> Retinue—empty, self-appearance's agent;
[16468] <prose> Teaching—pure, complete perception;
[16469] <prose> Time—without investigation, great primordial equality.
[16470] <prose> Dharmakāya's Nirmāṇakāya:
[16471] <prose> Fields—emptiness, unbroken space;
[16472] <prose> Abode—arising-basis of all, great self-clarity of depth;
[16473] <prose> Samādhi—unceasing, self-clear;
[16474] <prose> Retinue—pure appearance without class-distinction;
[16475] <prose> Teaching—unfabricated self-nature; || 40 ||
[16476] <prose> Time—essence directly manifest.
[16477] <prose> These too are designated from Dharmakāya's aspect of primordial purity self-abiding.
[16478] <tantra> From Ratnaketu:
[16479] <break> <tantra> "Through self-pure Dharmakāya,
[16480] <break> <tantra> Self-pure without elaboration, in celestial palace,
[16481] <tantra> In appearance-retinue nondual with oneself,
[16482] <tantra> Through markless Speech,
[16483] <tantra> Elaboration-free words
[16484] <tantra> Are emitted from nonabiding self-dissolved Mind.
[16485] <tantra> Without speaking, without having spoken, || 50 ||
[16486] <tantra> Shown in the state of Great Equality."
[16487] <tantra> Thus it is.
[16488] <prose> These too are merely designated as aspects;
[16489] <prose> In meaning, since established nowhere, they abide in Great Perfection free from extremes.
[16490] <tantra> From that very text:
[16491] <tantra> "This abode of 'this,'
[16492] <tantra> The named designated field with its marks,
[16493] <tantra> Whatever form appears nowhere,
[16494] <tantra> Nonexistent emptiness from Dharmodaya,
[16495] <tantra> In the great secret Expanse, || 60 ||
[16496] <tantra> Abiding from the primordial beginning,
[16497] <tantra> Ungrasped, in the manner of abiding,
[16498] <tantra> Great Play arose primordially.
[16499] <tantra> Here none abide.
[16500] <tantra> None make an abode.
[16501] <tantra> Here there is no perfection.
[16502] <tantra> Devoid of dwelling and coming.
[16503] <tantra> Thus, the place of great primordial emptiness,
[16504] <tantra> From nonexistence, the Expanse's field,
[16505] <tantra> Here there is neither outer nor inner. || 70 ||
[16506] <tantra> Above and below, no looking.
[16507] <tantra> In directions and intermediate points, none ever
[16508] <tantra> Has anything to grasp here."
[16509] <tantra> Thus it is.
[16510] <ornament> The Fourth: Extensive explanation of enumerations:
[16511] <tantra> From Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities—five:
[16512] <prose> Dharmakāya's Body—empty-clarity, markless;
[16513] <prose> Speech—indescribable, transcending words and speech;

[16515] <prose> Qualities—never regressing, without transformation; || 80 ||
[16516] <prose> Activities—spontaneous presence, abiding as basis of unceasing manifestation-manner.
[16517] <tantra> From Thalgyur:

[16520] <tantra> Body: emptiness and clarity,
[16521] <tantra> And markless self-nature.

[16530] <tantra> Arising potency, without ceasing,
[16531] <tantra> Without making, without having made."
[16532] <tantra> Thus it is.
[16533] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya extensively explained also comprises
[16534] <prose> Essence,
[16535] <break> <prose> Definitive terminology, || 100 ||
[16536] <break> <prose> Divisions,

[16538] <prose> Essence's defining characteristic: completely perfect in great self-clarity,
[16539] <prose> Essence's abiding manner: unchanging in nature, Kāya of marks and signs, families clearly manifest yet unmoving.
[16540] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's definitive terminology: engaging in appearance as Saṃbhogakāya, in that itself wisdom unceasingly engaging.
[16541] <prose> Kāya: great self-clear display-arrangement.
[16542] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's divisions are four:
[16543] <list> Great element Essence-Kāya;

[16555] <tantra> From Self-Arisen: || 120 ||
[16556] <tantra> "Abiding as light's heart-essence for all,
[16557] <tantra> Thought-free completely pure Dharmadhātu,
[16558] <break> <tantra> The single without rival,
[16559] <break> <tantra> Maṇḍala, retinue, palace,
[16560] <tantra> And awareness, emptiness, and clarity."
[16561] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16562] <ornament> The third:
[16563] <prose> The Saṃbhogakāya of appearance-basis Dharmatā, appearing to sentient beings in the bardo as path, here guiding those to be trained—self-arisen from Dharmakāya's inner Expanse,

[16565] <prose> Maṇḍala, || 130 ||
[16566] <prose> Retinue,

[16571] <prose> Mother,
[16572] <prose> Kāya-colors,

[16574] <tantra> From secret seed-cause,
[16575] <tantra> To nature-appearance, || 140 ||
[16576] <tantra> Nature-Kāya manifests;
[16577] <tantra> Like oneself and reflection.
[16578] <tantra> Three Kāyas: luminosity, emptiness,
[16579] <tantra> Not permanent, without entity,
[16580] <tantra> Not severed: luminosity-Kāya,
[16581] <tantra> Without distinction, without outer-inner."
[16582] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16583] <ornament> The fourth:
[16584] <prose> To those to be trained by Saṃbhogakāya, individually appearing according to family and maṇḍala,
[16585] <prose> Divided through emanation, empowered by those to be trained. || 150 ||
[16586] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's Dharmakāya Vairocana, great ocean,
[16587] <prose> That abiding manner: externally viewed, internally clear;
[16588] <prose> Internally viewed, externally clear;
[16589] <prose> Through thorough openness, without front or back;
[16590] <tantra> From wherever viewed, like showing face—appearance: face in ten directions, completely open.
[16591] <prose> That field: completely adorned ornament-arrangement,
[16592] <prose> At the palm's lotus-top, reigning over twenty-five world-systems.
[16593] <prose> Field: completely pure dense array,
[16594] <prose> Retinue: not other than oneself,
[16595] <prose> Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearing, || 160 ||

[16597] <ornament> This, regarding self-appearance primordially as emanation,
[16598] <ornament> Regarding those to be trained's luminosity, is posited as Saṃbhogakāya through perfection of marks and signs.
[16599] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's Saṃbhogakāya: appearing as five families' principal five.

[16613] <prose> Yet not yakṣa-realm Trāyastriṃśa,

[16627] <tantra> Even to self-arisen six syllables,
[16628] <tantra> Unspoken, shown as great self-arisen."
[16629] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16630] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya means:
[16631] <prose> Through essence, not demonstrating Dharmas as word—thus "unspoken."
[16632] <prose> The six syllables' self-sound heard by those to be trained:
[16633] <prose> Like dream-words, appearing as spoken.
[16634] <tantra> From Six Expanses:
[16635] <tantra> "Without speaking from one's own mouth, || 200 ||
[16636] <tantra> In dream-like defining characteristic,
[16637] <tantra> To retinue's Bodhisattvas,

[16678] <prose> That essence's abiding manner:
[16679] <prose> Liberated from attachment and fixation,

[16681] <prose> Definitive terminology:
[16682] <prose> Since emanated for whomever, whatever is to be trained, — therefore "emanation;"
[16683] <prose> That very form complete with excellent marks, — therefore "Kāya."
[16684] <prose> Divisions: common and uncommon approaches—two:
[16685] <prose> Common vehicle's renowned three: || 250 ||
[16686] <tantra> From Sūtrālaṃkāra:
