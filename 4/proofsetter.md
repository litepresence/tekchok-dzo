# Proofsetter

Divide into **four natural parts** reflecting the text's movement:

1. **Stanzas 1-13**: Establishing the ground—field never established, dharma-body's nature, scripture as mirror
2. **Stanzas 14-28**: Recognition in practice—meeting Buddha now, liberation without interval, cutting elaboration
3. **Stanzas 29-44**: Integration—merging mind/scripture, effortless abiding, cutting proliferation of methods
4. **Stanzas 45-54 + colophon**: Culmination—lineage continuity, Abu Dhraho's humility, simultaneous recognition-liberation

**Presentation flow:**
