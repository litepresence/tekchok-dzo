# ORIENTATION

This text is an exhortation (bskul ba), not a manual of practice or a formal pointing-out instruction. Exhortations are not generally considered restricted texts.

Patrul Rinpoche praises scripture as Buddha-activity and speaks from the standpoint of realization in order to inspire confidence and devotion. Without direct introduction from a qualified lineage holder, such words may be understood conceptually, but they are not intended to replace experiential transmission.

Accordingly, this teaching is not restricted in nature. It presents the Dzogchen view with great force and rhetorical clarity, while deliberately refraining from procedural instruction. Patrul Rinpoche wrote for herders, monastics, and laypeople alike, openly expressing the view without always imparting method. Here, reification is cut through language and confidence, not through technique.

Read as encouragement to look—rather than as authorization to conclude.

### Liturgy and Commentary

PART ONE

**Stanza 1**  
Field never established—utterly peaceful,  
Unbroken expanse of pristine awareness,  
Great power of intention, perfection's display,  
To that All-Knowing Lama—prostration.

**Stanza 2**  
Alas—self-nature of supreme qualities,  
Not relying on scripture, not self-made,  
From great ocean the supreme jewel arises,  
In lowly place—where could one find it?

**Stanza 3**  
Even when sun of realization appears,  
Without unbroken blessing-transmission,  
Those entering emptiness-meditation's darkness,  
Rarely proceed correctly on the path.

**Stanza 4**  
Not hearing creates great fault in existence,  
Wrongly hearing creates sin greater still,  
When chance exists to look upon scripture now,  
Why not purify the pupil of hearing?

**Stanza 5**  
In this existence—single wish-fulfilling jewel,  
Precious system of the All-Knowing Lama,  
If no Buddha exists beyond this place,  
Who would not arise in great joy?

**Stanza 6**  
Peak of vehicles—supreme Vajra Essence,  
Hundred-thousand tantras' jewel treasury,  
Vast expression, profound expressed meaning,  
Seeing this—Samantabhadra's face in jewel light.

**Stanza 7**  
Sixty hundred-thousand tantras in the heart,  
Knowing cyclic and peaceful share one nature,  
Realizing profound peak vehicle's mark,  
Therefore hold vigilance seeing this text.

**Stanza 8**  
Dharma-body's nature needs no protection,  
Treasury of Samantabhadra beyond cause,  
Without cutting elaboration with scriptures like this,  
Cutting mind-investigating vehicles' grasp—accomplished by whom?

**Stanza 9**  
Essence of all pith instructions gathered,  
Each six section a complete dharma treasury,  
Path so excellent it meets Victorious One,  
Hearing immediately—not difficult.

**Stanza 10**  
Single treatise containing complete teaching,  
Complete explanation—accomplishment's jewel,  
Scriptures like this, even in China Tibet,  
Never came before. Never come now.

**Stanza 11**  
Wish-fulfilling guide to abandon-adopt places,  
Treasury of complete dharma—hearing, contemplation,  
Seeing this, know suchness of all teachings,  
Hundred scriptures practiced immediately.

**Stanza 12**  
Peak vehicle's intention—ten words to one,  
Pith instruction concise, meaning penetrating,  
Single treasury of essential practice here,  
Alone courageous cutting existence's root.

**Stanza 13**  
Mind-essence never established as pure or impure,  
Bare—awareness recognizing itself, free from separation,  
Deepest point—awareness self-recognizing, intention's core,  
Dharma-expanse jewel treasury—profound beyond.

#### TRANSLATOR'S COMMENTARY

**Stanza 1**  
Field never established—utterly peaceful. Unbroken expanse where prostration lands already rests. Before the name arose.

**Stanza 2**  
Alas—self-nature not relying on scripture, not self-made. From great ocean the supreme jewel arises. In lowly place—where could one find it? Ocean gives the jewel.

**Stanza 3**  
Sunlight alone does not ripen the seed. Blessing carries warmth that opens what light merely illuminates—emptiness-meditation without lineage: thunderbolt-darkness.

**Stanza 4**  
Not hearing leaves obscurity intact. Wrong hearing hardens obscurity into certainty—misapprehension binds tighter than ignorance. Purification occurs when hearing hears itself.

**Stanza 5**  
Wish-fulfilling jewel in this existence—not elsewhere. Great joy already here before the name arose.

**Stanza 6**  
Peak never departed from this place. Hundred-thousand tantras in single stanza—treasury gleaming. Samantabhadra's face in the light.

**Stanza 7**  
Sixty hundred-thousand tantras in the heart—not by compression but because the heart never excluded them. Cyclic existence and peace share one nature. Vigilance is natural clarity itself. Scripture—mirror.

**Stanza 8**  
Dharma-body never stood vulnerable—protection implies threat where none exists. Cause and effect dissolve as display within single expanse. Elaboration cuts itself. Without this scripture's sharp edge—who cuts the grasping.

**Stanza 9**  
Essence gathers because never scattered. Each section holds the whole—not representation but presence. Meeting Victorious One requires no travel. The interval dissolves.

**Stanza 10**  
Teaching never lacked completeness—this treatise reveals what never departed. China and Tibet mark no boundary. Never came before—nothing was absent. Never comes now—arrival always already here.

**Stanza 11**  
Abandon and adopt arise within single expanse. Treasury holds entire path—not sequence but recognition. Seeker sought gone. Seeing reveals directly. Hundred scriptures practiced immediately.

**Stanza 12**  
Ten words collapse to one—not reduction but revealing the single source. Meaning penetrates without effort—never stood apart from what it means. Cutting the root requires no blade.

**Stanza 13**  
Mind-essence never established as pure or impure—ka dag is absence of establishment itself. Separation appears without dividing what remains whole. Deepest point is surface—no depth to fathom.


PART TWO

**Stanza 14**  
Scripture where authentic dharma-body arrives,  
Scriptures like this are Buddha actual,  
In this existence accomplishing Victorious One's activity,  
Scripture manifestly showing Victorious One's intention.

**Stanza 15**  
Even meeting Buddha—beyond this exists?  
Scriptures like this treasury of all sacred dharma,  
Final reach of all dharmas' expressed meaning,  
Bare showing—dharma-body, awareness self-recognizing.

**Stanza 16**  
Comparing all dharmas—even then, beyond this?  
Scriptures like this are noble assemblies' heart,  
Past-future Victorious Sons of three times,  
Realization-awareness never transcends this.

**Stanza 17**  
Noble ones' pristine awareness—beyond this?  
Three jewels complete in dharma-body field,  
Unsurpassed footprints of all Victorious Ones,  
Display of All-Knowing Lama's realization.

**Stanza 18**  
Who meets this makes existence final,  
Even hearing one word of scriptures like this,  
If able to turn appearances into wandering,  
While obtaining fortune to meet the complete.

**Stanza 19**  
If discarded—how could mind exist?  
Alas, three baskets and nine stages of dharma,  
Generally intend for the diligent—"Liberate  
Through meditation, accomplishment, striving they say—

**Stanza 20**  
No seeing—awareness self-recognizing, free,  
This vajra peak beyond mind, effortless—  
Unmaintained Buddha—awareness empty nature bare,  
Given now even to the lazy as dharma-body.

**Stanza 21**  
No attachment to meditation, accomplishment, striving,  
In this world including gods who show this path,  
The All-Knowing Lama alone is dharma-body,  
From however much dharma-body teaching abides—

**Stanza 22**  
This treasury of dharma-expanse is dharma's essence,  
Therefore scriptures like this in this existence,  
Liberation through seeing—hearing liberation, recollection,  
Connection's moment—measureless Buddha.

**Stanza 23**  
Obtaining intention—you are Buddha now,  
Without losing ear of blessing lineage,  
Placing intention, meaning-lineage's awareness recognizing itself transfers,  
Wide placement established upon future children.

**Stanza 24**  
All-Knowing Lama actually equal to you,  
Even without piercing words' meaning and intention,  
When devotion arises, blessing-lineage's awareness recognizing itself transfers,  
Beyond seeing this scripture—precious word-empowerment.

**Stanza 25**  
Nowhere else—awareness' power complete,  
When tormented by fear of fault or impurity,  
Seeing this scripture—great-joy awareness recognizing itself,  
Heedless joy—awareness clear and luminous.

**Stanza 26**  
Deluded appearances shatter on contact,  
When joy expands and great bliss blazes,  
Seeing this scripture—joy-fatigue attachment gone,  
Expanse unbroken—no boundary abandon-adopt.

**Stanza 27**  
Showing profound intention of All-Knowing Lama,  
When tormented by attachment and striving now,  
Seeing this scripture—pride and pretension shatter,  
Appearances spacious—whatever way you act, fine.

**Stanza 28**  
Doubt's tightness gone—relaxed equal abiding,  
This is Middle Way—this perfection of others,  
This cutting-object pacifies suffering,  
Actual Mahāmudrā and Great Perfection.

#### TRANSLATOR'S COMMENTARY

**Stanza 14**  
Dharma-body arrives now—not event but recognition of what never departed. Scripture is Buddha—speech never separates from realization. Activity accomplishes—no agent required. Manifest showing requires no veil.

**Stanza 15**  
Meeting Buddha reveals no beyond. Treasury contains all—nothing ever outside this expanse. Final reach is the source itself. Bare showing: awareness naked without veils.

**Stanza 16**  
Comparison finds no superior—nothing stands outside the expanse that holds comparison. Noble assemblies gather in single heart. Past present future arise within awareness—never moved across time.

**Stanza 17**  
Noble awareness never stood apart to be compared. Three jewels complete within dharma-body—refuge never existed outside the one taking refuge. Footprints mark no path traveled—ground itself appearing as trace.

**Stanza 18**  
Final existence marks end of seeking. Single word holds the ocean—words never separated from what they express. Partial appearances wander—never whole to begin with. Fortune arrives.

**Stanza 19**  
Discarding implies something substantial to cast away—mind never stood as entity. Three baskets and nine stages serve the diligent—skillful means not ultimate truth. Striving liberates—what never stood bound.

**Stanza 20**  
Seeing requires no seer—awareness recognizing itself never stood apart. Vajra peak not summit to ascend—ground never requiring elevation. Unmaintained Buddha always present. Lazy ones receive. Already received. Already complete. Already lazy—and free.

**Stanza 21**  
Attachment never bound what was always free—meditation accomplishment striving arise as display. Gods and humans share one ground—no elevation separates them. Lama alone is dharma-body. Teaching abides as awareness itself.

**Stanza 22**  
Essence never stood apart from display—dharma-expanse holds all without exclusion. Seeing liberates. Hearing frees. Recollection dissolves the interval. No separation between encounter and release.

**Stanza 23**  
Obtaining is recognition of what never departed—Buddha now not after lifetimes. Ear of blessing lineage never broke—transmission never crossed distance. Placing intention needs no location. Student—teacher gone.

**Stanza 24**  
Equality not aspiration—Lama and student share single nature. Piercing words unnecessary—meaning reveals itself through devotion's openness. Blessing transfers—no distance crossed. Word-empowerment: sound becoming awareness.

**Stanza 25**  
Nowhere else—completeness never lacked anything. Fear of fault arises from taking appearance as substantial—fault never stained what was never established. Great-joy awareness—natural radiance. Heedless joy—freedom from maintaining.

**Stanza 26**  
Delusion shatters on contact—no opposition required. Joy expands. Bliss blazes. Both transparent when seen without grasping. Attachment to experience dissolves—bliss never stood apart from awareness. Abandon and adopt dissolve within single expanse.

**Stanza 27**  
Profound intention never concealed itself—shows exactly as it is. Torment arises only when attachment mistakes itself for path. Pride shatters—no position stands apart to be proud. Spacious expanse holds all action.

**Stanza 28**  
Tightness dissolves—contraction releases itself. Relaxed abiding needs no adjustment—what never bound awareness requires no release. Extremes never stood apart to reconcile. Cutting—no blade required. Suffering pacifies itself. Two names—single recognition.


PART THREE

**Stanza 29**  
All dharmas gathered here—surpassing all,  
If son entering All-Knowing Lama's footsteps,  
Never separate from this excellent scripture,  
Entrusting awareness self-recognizing—constant supreme companion.

**Stanza 30**  
Core mind-placing like this exists?  
Immediate ease—Buddha obtained at core,  
Not tormented by striving, mind's fetters gone,  
Happy—ascend; suffering—weariness finds companionship.

**Stanza 31**  
Scriptures like this singularly undeceiving,  
Therefore sing in melody, take as song,  
Cut into verses, recite smoothly, look,  
If never separate from this—

**Stanza 32**  
Deluded saṃsāra appearances scatter to pieces,  
When blessing-lineage transfers realization's point,  
Inexpressible—awareness self-recognizing arises,  
Meeting face to face All-Knowing dharma-body Lama.

**Stanza 33**  
Mind at ease upon ground of ease, unbroken,  
Beyond seeing this scripture, no other practice,  
This itself is essence of meditation, accomplishment,  
For however long you spend with these scriptures—

**Stanza 34**  
For that long, dharma-body's intention arises naturally,  
Therefore do not multiply striving mind's agitation,  
From spacious relaxedness behold these excellent supports,  
Profound meaning not distant at all.

**Stanza 35**  
Mind's thread cut—self-settling enough for me,  
Difficult to realize like logical treatises,  
No need to construct, arrange, seek word-meaning,  
In self-settling naturally merge mind with scripture.

**Stanza 36**  
Barely moving through spacious expanse, nakedly,  
Introduction—awareness recognizing itself, never established,  
All-Knowing Lama's pith instruction—yourself,  
This expressed object is actual empowerment itself.

**Stanza 37**  
Essence practice—who needs beyond oneself?  
Pierce certain words or leave them whole—either way,  
Know profound meaning or remain unknowing—  
Obtain intention's core or wander empty-handed—

**Stanza 38**  
Doubt cut—look without distraction, naturally,  
Look again, mix with experience and look,  
Merge scripture and mind—mind obtains scripture's expansion,  
From inseparability, sing with joyful resonance.

**Stanza 39**  
Devotion's power blazes—realization's pristine awareness arises,  
Alas, essence of essence itself,  
Profound beyond profound—nowhere else like this,  
Treasury of blessing, essence teaching itself.

**Stanza 40**  
Teacher actual—Buddha held in hand,  
Eons describing qualities like this,  
My small mind's intelligence cannot exhaust them,  
What of other great minds' confidence?

**Stanza 41**  
No path like this brings joy to noble ones,  
Alas, jewel precious like this,  
When obtaining good fortune through self-power now,  
Even abiding in existence—no weariness.

**Stanza 42**  
Having generated devotion, why not enter spacious expanse?  
Heart-companion, cast your mind into this scripture,  
From spacious relaxedness—cut mind's thread now,  
Pacify here agitation of doer, deed, striving mind.

**Stanza 43**  
Cut elaboration of many scriptures here,  
What use many pleasant-sounding systems?  
What use many profoundly profound instructions?  
What use many elaborated practices?

**Stanza 44**  
What use many explanations affirming "yes, yes"?  
Spacious relaxed samādhi—this sleeping dharma is yourself,  
Mind at ease in spacious expanse—this self-throne is yourself,  
Knowing a single excellent scripture—this all-liberation is yourself.

#### TRANSLATOR'S COMMENTARY

**Stanza 29**  
All dharmas gather—source never scattered across separate territories. Following Lama's footsteps means walking where no path was laid—recognition itself is the entrance. Never separating from scripture—words dissolve boundary between reader and read. Awareness's constant companion never departed.

**Stanza 30**  
Core-placement requires no location. Ease arrives not as reward—effort never substantially contributed to what was always complete. Fetters dissolve—never tied, only believed to bind. Happiness ascends. Suffering finds companionship. Both within single expanse.

**Stanza 31**  
Undeceiving—concealment never stood between word and meaning. Scripture functions as mirror not veil. Singing dissolves distance—sound becomes the awareness it carries. Smooth recitation lets words fall away—only recognition remains.

**Stanza 32**  
Deluded appearances scatter—never whole to begin with. No destruction required—only recognition of what never substantially assembled. Blessing transfers not across space—student teacher one taste. Inexpressible awareness arises—expression never stood apart.

**Stanza 33**  
Ground of ease never departed from ease itself—mind settles not by effort but by recognizing it never left. No practice stands apart—practice never separate from realization. Essence of meditation and accomplishment—single recognition wearing two names.

**Stanza 34**  
Intention arises naturally—not through force but as uncontrived expression of what never departed. Striving mind agitates—transparent display taken as substantial. Relaxation not technique—effort never substantially contributed to what was always present. Spacious relaxedness ground already beneath agitation.

**Stanza 35**  
Mind's thread cuts itself when seen without grasping—no external agent required. Self-settling needs no method—recognition is sufficient. Logical treatises proliferate—seeking what never departed from the seeker. Construction obscures what stands already complete.

**Stanza 36**  
Bare movement needs no clothing—naked passage through spacious expanse requires no preparation. Introduction reveals what never stood apart to be introduced—awareness always present. Pith instruction your own nature—no transmission crosses distance because none existed to cross. Empowerment actualizes—authorization never departed.

**Stanza 37**  
Essence practice requires nothing added—what was never elsewhere cannot be acquired. Pierce words or leave them whole—both arrive where no path was laid. Know the meaning or remain in unknowing—recognition precedes both.

**Stanza 38**  
Doubt cuts itself when reinforcement stops—no technique required. Awareness rests as itself. Seeing again—mixed with experience. Scripture mind merge—boundaries never substantially enclosed what was always whole.

**Stanza 39**  
Devotion blazes as openness itself—not emotional fervor but collapse of resistance. Realizing awareness dawns—not as new event but as what never departed from its source. Essence of essence marks no hierarchy—depth collapses when seen without interval.

**Stanza 40**  
Teacher actual—speech never separates from realization. Buddha held in hand—not object grasped but recognition holder and held share one nature. Eons of description cannot exhaust—qualities arise from inexhaustible source. Small mind acknowledges limitation—not deficiency but recognition completeness never required comprehension.

**Stanza 41**  
Joy arises as recognition itself—not emotional reaction but natural radiance. The jewel fulfills—wishing never stood apart from fulfillment. Seeker sought gone. Self-power is recognition's autonomy—no validation required from outside.

**Stanza 42**  
Devotion opens what was never closed—no barrier stood between recognition and recognizer. Mind meeting scripture—words dissolve the boundary between reader and read. Mind's thread cuts itself when seen without grasping. Doer, deed, striving—dissolve into spacious relaxedness already present.

**Stanza 43**  
Elaboration cuts itself. Pleasant systems please the ear—obscure recognition. Profound instructions multiply when recognition is missed. Practices generate distance through effort to close it. Simplicity never elsewhere.

**Stanza 44**  
Affirmations proliferate where certainty never departed—yes-yes explanations multiply only when recognition is obscured. Sleeping dharma abides without effort—natural clarity remains. Self-throne requires no elevation—already seated where no throne was laid.



PART FOUR

**Stanza 45**  
A hundred pith instructions—this single bridge is yourself,  
Having placed it within yourself, do not seek elsewhere,  
Do not discard essence and gather straw,  
Do not abandon effortlessness and accomplish through diligence.

**Stanza 46**  
Send forth doerless—do not multiply action,  
Merely born in All-Knowing Lama's lineage,  
Holds like this reach ancestors' hands,  
Paths like this placed by forefathers.

**Stanza 47**  
Descend heedless—even here descend,  
Alas mother, alas mother—three lineages' great compassion,  
Good fortune exists to see excellent scripture,  
Great treasure exists to accomplish excellent path.

**Stanza 48**  
Buddha within yourself—true even for you,  
Therefore on this excellent path delighting Victor,  
Heart-companion, merge mind with dharma,  
Absorb heart-speech into heart's center.

**Stanza 49**  
Placed in heart—it is essence even so,  
Heedless sūtra-keeper, I Abu Dhraho,  
Explaining oral dharma not within myself,  
Without joy—yet All-Knowing lineage's scripture.

**Stanza 50**  
Faith obtained—unique experience,  
Five poisons blaze as fire, distraction to turmoil,  
Though I resemble one for whom delusion hard to reverse,  
When hearing seeing scriptures like this—

**Stanza 51**  
Existence's partial appearances go—unravel or not,  
Therefore mind stable, five poisons' conceptions small,  
You good-fortuned samaya-keeper and those like you,  
Scripture seen—supreme awareness self-recognizing, blessing essence.

**Stanza 52**  
Again generate certainty of certain attainment,  
All-Knowing Lama, that perfect Buddha's  
Blessing radiance—wherever it touches,  
Recognition and liberation simultaneous—direct measure.

**Stanza 53**  
Common ancestor of hundred accomplished—All-Knowing Lama,  
Lord of realization, great deity-venerable,  
Expanse-transcendent awareness-holder Jigme Lingpa,  
Owner of teachings, great treasure Lama and others—

**Stanza 54**  
From All-Knowing's scripture, blessing lineage obtained,  
Heart-companion, you hold treasury of that intention,  
Similarly supreme—All-Knowing's excellent speech,  
Seeing that manner, eightfold meaning as awareness recognizing itself.

#### TRANSLATOR'S COMMENTARY

**Stanza 45**  
Hundred instructions condense to single bridge—recognition stands on both banks simultaneously. No river ever divided them. Seeking elsewhere generates distance it seeks to close—movement away assumes source was elsewhere. Discarding essence for straw reveals only what was never lost.

**Stanza 46**  
Doerless action moves without agent—no one stands apart to send or receive. Born into lineage through recognition alone—not blood but continuity of recognition itself. Ancestral holds remain exactly where placed—in the nature of mind itself.

**Stanza 47**  
Heedless descent lands within recognition's expanse—no fall exists outside it. Ground never departed from falling. Three lineages manifest as single compassion—past present future collapse into single continuum. Seeing scripture recognition dawning—not visual perception.

**Stanza 48**  
Buddha within not as potential but as actual presence—no becoming required. Path delights the Victor—never led elsewhere. Joy is recognition itself—seeker and sought collapse. Merging mind with dharma—subject-object dissolves without technique.

**Stanza 49**  
Essence placed in heart—recognition of what never departed. The Carefree One's heedlessness not deficiency—flow of teaching without adherence to teacher. Oral dharma not owned—words move through lineage like breath through lungs. Joy absent not depression—transcendence of fluctuation.

**Stanza 50**  
Faith unique—recognition never standing apart from recognizer. Five poisons blaze as raw material—fire transforms without rejecting fuel. Impurity never stained what was never established as pure. Habit's thickness.

**Stanza 51**  
Appearances go. Unraveling or not—both dissolve in single movement. Neither ever substantially bound awareness. Mind stable not through suppression—disturbance never anchored what was always free. Five poisons' conceptions small—transparent when seen.

**Stanza 52**  
Certainty of what never departed—repeated generation not accumulation but continuous recognition. Blessing radiance touches—no outside, no inside, no boundary. Recognition liberation simultaneous—no interval ever divided them.

**Stanza 53**  
Single source—hundred accomplished flow from one recognition. No fork ever divided the stream. Realization's lord abides beyond elevation—power is freedom from position. The Awareness-Holder—intention's expanse transcended location—no center holds the continuum.

**Stanza 54**  
Treasury of intention rests in heart—not acquired, not transmitted across distance. Excellent speech reveals what never stood apart from hearing. Meanings arise—not objects to grasp but awareness knowing its own nature before names appear. No interval between text and reader. No separation between blessing and the one blessed.


### Closing Colophon


**Colophon**  
Suchness-expanse and intention-expanse liberation become,  
Spoken by Paltrül,  
sarva maṅgalaṃ.

#### TRANSLATOR'S COMMENTARY

Suchness-expanse and intention-expanse are not two—liberation occurs not as transformation but as recognition of what never departed from freedom. Paltrül composed this exhortation not as commentary but as direct encouragement to look—words functioning as mirror not doctrine. May all beings recognize what never stood apart.
