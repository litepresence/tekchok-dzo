   - Resolution: Elevated to flowing Vajra Speech prose and verse

- ngo bo ka dag → primordial purity of essence
- rang bzhin lhun grub → spontaneous perfection of nature
- gzhi gnas kyi ye shes → wisdom of basis-abiding
- All five wisdom types with proper capitalization

**navigation.md** - Verified current:

### Phase 3: Quality Assessment Review

**Original Assessment**: 29 files flagged for issues

**Revised Assessment After Review**:
- 4 files: Actually needed complete rewrite ✓ DONE

- All short files (<20 lines): 01-04-17-01.txt, 02-17-03-01.txt, 02-18-16-01.txt, etc.
- Verse-heavy files with naturally short lines
- Files with good structure like 02-22-02-01.txt and 02-22-06-01.txt
