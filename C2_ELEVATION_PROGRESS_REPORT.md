## PUBLISHER NOTES

**The elevation from B → A++ is transformative:**

Files previously functioning as "background material" now serve as **transmission texts**. Even cosmological and technical Abhidharma content now points directly to mind nature.

**Example Impact:**
- A student reading cosmology now encounters: "What appears as geography is spirituality when known—recognize all worlds as your own mind's display"
- This transforms encyclopedic knowledge into recognition opportunity

**Recommendation:** Continue elevation for all remaining B/B+ files. The investment yields major quality improvement for publication.

## NEXT ACTIONS

**Immediate:**
1. Continue elevation of 01-06 series (empowerment instructions - high priority)
2. Elevate 01-07 series (samaya completion)
3. Elevate 01-08 series (Dzogchen basis)

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours for remaining 30 files

**Copyleft 2026:** In elevating the many to A++, the one standard was revealed.
