## STANDARDIZATION PRINCIPLES APPLIED

### 1. Proper Noun Rule
Names of beings, places, and texts always capitalized:
- Buddha, Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva
- Preta, Naga, Yaksha (classes of beings)
- Jambudvīpa, Sukhavati (places)

### 2. Technical Term Rule
Dzogchen technical terms capitalized:
- Ground, View, Path, Fruition
- Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya
- Dzogchen, Atiyoga

### 3. Sanskrit Term Rule
Sanskrit technical terms capitalized:
- Vidya, Jñana, Dharmadhatu
- Maṇḍala, Maṇḍala (with ṇ)
- Samaya (when technical)

### 4. Context-Dependent Rule
Same term, different capitalization based on usage:
- "dharma" (phenomena) vs "Dharma" (teachings)
- "empowerment" (generic) vs "Empowerment" (initiation)
- "mandala" (geometric) vs "Maṇḍala" (deity assembly)

### 5. Consistency Within Files
Once a term is capitalized in a technical context, maintain consistency throughout that section.
