[1740-1743] The text establishes a twofold division of faculties arising from form and wisdom aspects. This structural partition serves as the foundation for subsequent phenomenological analysis. The view register here operates at the interface of Sutric Abhidharma and Dzogchen sensibilities, where the six sense faculties are not merely categorized but positioned within a broader soteriological framework. Translation risks emerge in rendering dbang po as either "faculties" or "powers," with the latter potentially overdetermining the semantic field. Preservation requires maintaining the distinction between gzugs kyi cha and shes rab kyi cha as complementary rather than hierarchical categories.
[1744-1749] The enumeration of the six form-based faculties maps the classical elements to sensory capacities in a precise architectonic. Earth supports the eye through its stable, coarse nature; wind enables the ear through movement; water gathers scent; fire ripens taste; space pervades as the mental faculty; the body aggregates diversity. This elemental correlation reflects a Tantric substrate underlying the apparent Sutric presentation. The mapping requires careful attention to avoid anachronistic physiological interpretations that would displace the cosmological framework.
[1750-1756] The six wisdom faculties shift register from elemental correspondence to epistemic virtues. Faith arises from mental fervor, diligence from sharpness, mindfulness from unbroken attention, samadhi from manifesting emptiness, wisdom from approaching the view, and peace from generating non-conceptuality. This sequence traces a graduated path that could be mistaken for a linear progression rather than a simultaneous perfection. The preservation challenge lies in maintaining the Dzogchen resonance of sems rnam par zhi ba as transcending rather than merely calming mental activity.
[1757-1761] The fifth section introduces subject-object relations as the structural matrix of experience. The bifurcation into gzung ba and 'dzin pa constitutes the foundational illusion that the text will progressively deconstruct. The view here is quintessentially Yogacara in its initial formulation, yet the identification of objects as both apparent phenomena and empty nature begins the dialectical movement toward Madhyamaka. Translation must resist collapsing the distinction between chos can and chos nyid into simple appearance-emptiness dualism.
[1762-1767] The exposition of objects as beyond extremes establishes the middle way epistemology. Objects appear yet transcend reification; the supreme intelligence moves beyond expression. This is the transition point where Sutric analysis yields to Dzogchen directness. The twofold division into objects of phenomena and emptiness requires preservation of the yul/yul ma yin distinction without reducing it to a naive realism.
[1768-1776] The enumeration of apparent objects follows standard Abhidharma categories while preparing for their emptiness. Form, sound, scent, taste, phenomena, tactile appearances, the four elements, and distinct conditions of entry constitute the conventional domain. The structural function here is to exhaust the possible field of sensory engagement before demonstrating its illusory nature. Translation risks include over-literalizing 'byung ba chen po as "great elements" rather than recognizing their processual nature.
[1777-1781] The objects of emptiness encompass all emptinesses and the transcendence of reified consciousness. The second category of non-objects includes what is beyond extremes and what is beyond view. This is the pivot toward Dzogchen where the analysis itself is released. Preservation requires maintaining the apophatic momentum without falling into nihilistic interpretation.
[1782-1786] The text establishes transcendence of extremes and views as the culmination of the preceding analysis. Beyond extremes means not grasping self in phenomena; beyond view means inexpressibility. This is the seal of the Dzogchen view where all philosophical positions are released without being negated. Translation must preserve the performative dimension of these statements as pointing instructions rather than propositional claims.
[1787-1793] The summary verse declares all distinctions to be illusory like magic and dreams, unestablished in their apparent nature, empty of essence, mere appearances of clarity-emptiness delusion. Mind itself, self-arisen wisdom, arises from ignorance yet obscures as essence. When these deluded appearances dissolve, stainless luminosity becomes manifest. This is the crux of the text's soteriological trajectory. The view register is unmistakably Dzogchen with its identification of sems nyid and rang byung ye shes. Preservation requires maintaining the paradox that ignorance gives rise to wisdom's self-obscuration without temporal or causal priority.
[1794-1796] The present condition is established as dependent on karma and afflictions, yet these depend on improper mental engagement resting on the six or seven consciousness groups including the alaya. This itself rests on self-arisen wisdom, the suchness of mind, naturally pure essence. Because this rests on nothing, it is called self-arisen wisdom. The structural function here is the classic Dzogchen reversal: what appears as ground is actually dependent, while what is groundless is foundational. Translation risks include domesticating this reversal into linear causality.
[1797-1810] The citation from Uttaratantra uses the analogy of elements resting on each other without independent ground to illustrate the dependency of aggregates, elements, and faculties on karma and afflictions. These in turn rest on improper mental engagement, which rests on pure mind essence. Yet mind's nature transcends all location. The verse form requires preservation of its pedagogical function without reducing it to mere ornamentation.
[1811-1822] The text shifts to a threefold classification of karma as white, black, and immovable, or alternatively as meritorious, non-meritorious, and unwavering. Meritorious actions produce pleasant samsaric results including the ten virtues. Non-meritorious actions encompass the ten non-virtues and five heinous deeds. Immovable actions propel birth in the upper realms and yield irreversible results. This is standard Sutric karma theory serving as the conventional foundation for subsequent transcendence.

[1902-1906] The section on mistaken paths begins with the enumeration of three hundred sixty views of the perishable composite. The twofold structure presents first the general nature of eternalism and nihilism, then their specific variations. This architectonic reflects the text's systematic approach to philosophical classification. The view register is polemical yet analytical, serving the soteriological function of establishing correct view through the refutation of error.
[1907-1935] The exposition of eternalist views centers on the Samkhya system as the paradigmatic representative. The tripartite nature of primal matter, darkness, and vital force in equal measure constitutes the self, located in the heart in forms proportionate to the body. This is invisible, white, oily, coiled, indestructible, known to itself. The description preserves the internal logic of the opponent's position before refutation. Translation risks include anachronistic imposition of either Vedantic or Buddhist categories onto this distinct system.
[1936-1942] The citation from Madhyamakavatara summarizes the Samkhya view of self as neither agent nor enjoyer, without qualities or actions, established through enumeration. From slight variations in this, heretical systems diverge. This confirms the text's reliance on authoritative Indian sources for its doxography. Preservation requires maintaining the citation's function as both summary and authentication.
[1943-1948] The nihilist position is introduced as the Lokayata view holding that from present perception of pleasure and pain, nothing else exists. No past or future lives, no karma, no cause and result, no liberation. This extreme reduction to immediate sensation represents the dialectical opposite of eternalism. The structural function is to establish the parameters of philosophical error as grasping at either existence or non-existence.
