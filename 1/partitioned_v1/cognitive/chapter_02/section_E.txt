From four great kings to great Brahma similarly. Water destruction: clouds gathered rain fell flooded, below wind maṇḍala supported not sank. Beings there all died. Then fire destruction. Wind destruction: wind maṇḍala upper and lower upper and lower very grinding one above one struck completely destroyed. Last: then container-contents all destroyed. That abiding destruction empty three. Uncommon vehicle here 60 intermediate kalpas equal 180, called first duration kalpa. 180 duration kalpas two intermediate kalpas called second. Intermediate kalpa number infinite said. Thus vessel-content four eons measure elaborated. Now explaining abode vessel-content taming beings retinue.
[1542-1581] 
Vessel and content briefly: first aggregates basis nature, second aspects sense-bases distinctions, third apprehender faculties entity, fourth object subject aspects. First aggregates basis nature: five aggregates aggregated, basis dharmatā nature not two thus. Mind and matter two and many not one thus basis nature like. Second sense-bases distinctions: six sense-bases separate distinguish twelve thus aspects like. Third faculties entity: faculties apprehender aware entity merely thus apprehender like. Fourth object subject aspects: form etc. five objects, eye etc. five subjects, both object subject aspects like. Thus explained, here mind consciousness six aggregates basis, abode sense-bases aspects, support faculties entity, enjoyment object subject aspects well explained, root and branch divisions two by habit well explained.
[1582-1622] 
Brief explanation three gates from where. First aggregates: from where immeasurable memory formless realm, from memory separate grasping desire realm. Second sense-bases: internal mind-appearance-skill self-nature appearing. Because rigpa exists, obstructing skill ignorance alaya, depending on that alaya-vijñana mind, mind and five sense consciousnesses arise. Like golden ground palm tree growing branches flowers leaves. Three realms explained: form realm below above-near distinctions well explained, mind only appearance aspects clear rigpa five wisdoms clear light nature appearing. Desire realm five objects appearing desire arising affliction power, support basis alaya all-seed mind, eight consciousnesses various concepts arising conceptualization, like city reflection moon water reflection dream illusion magical display.
[1623-1660] 
Formless realm four: infinite space memory aspect clear from there consciousness and separate grasping consciousness aspect clear two arise. Infinite consciousness previous consciousness gathering from there infinite consciousness consciousness aspect clear two arise. Nothing at all previous infinite consciousness gathering from there nothing at all consciousness aspect clear two arise. Neither perception nor non-perception previous nothing at all gathering from there perception aspect clear two arise. Thus explained three realms abiding. Second sense-bases explanation: dharmakāya level five wisdoms self-nature spontaneously arisen clear light nature awareness emptiness not two like. Sambhogakāya level five families appearance aspects buddha field five enjoyments appearing, self-awareness object appearing non-dual enjoyment. Nirmāṇakāya level six sense-bases various concepts object-subject grasping fixation habit retinue beings. From where self-awareness aspect clear samsara arising, from alaya mind only six consciousnesses appearing.
