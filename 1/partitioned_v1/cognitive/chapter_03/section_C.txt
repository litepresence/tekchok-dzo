[3731-3740] 
Structural function establishes the basis analysis framework through threefold classification of existence, non-existence, and both. The dzogchen view register operates at the level of spontaneous liberation without dependent origination. Translation risks include rendering "klong dkar po" as mere metaphor rather than recognizing its technical designation for expansive white space. Preservation requirements demand maintaining the distinction between the three khra bo factions and their alignment with sems sde, rang gnad, and man ngag traditions.
[3741-3750] 
Structural function presents the first khra bo faction aligned with sems sde, emphasizing the inseparability of appearance and mind. View register maintains the primordial purity of dharmatā without acceptance or rejection. Translation risks obscure the technical meaning of "rang dag gnas grol" as self-purified abiding liberation. Preservation requirements note the critical distinction between this view and lower vehicles through the phrase "tha snyad bya rtsol las 'das pa."
[3751-3760] 
Structural function introduces the second khra bo faction focused on appearance as self-liberated without cause. View register asserts that virtuous and non-virtuous actions lack inherent existence. Translation risks misrepresent "med snang" as mere non-appearance rather than appearance of emptiness. Preservation requirements ensure the technical term "'gyur ba stong yal" retains its specific meaning of empty transformation.
[3761-3763] 
Structural function completes the triad with the third khra bo faction integrating both extremes through oral instructions. View register presents the three essential points of ineffability, non-meditation, and unchanging nature. Translation risks conflate the three gnad into generic spiritual advice. Preservation requirements maintain the precise technical vocabulary distinguishing these three keys as unique to the man ngag sde tradition.
[3764-3777] 
Structural function establishes the two categories of klong dkar po related to vast action and view-meditation integration. View register positions these as expressions of the ocean-like expanse where primordial purity manifests without effort. Translation risks render "las rgya che ba" as mere magnitude rather than recognizing its technical sense of vast activity without causal origination. Preservation requirements maintain the distinction between the ocean expanse and sky expanse as separate categories with specific characteristics.
[3778-3785] 
Structural function details the great ocean expanse through self-abiding emptiness and primordial liberation. View register emphasizes the single wheel of great transcendence dwelling in emptiness. Translation risks lose the technical precision of "yin rang 'das chen po" as a specific classification. Preservation requirements note the phrase "stong pas gang du yang grub pa med par" establishes the view of emptiness without established existence anywhere.
[3786-3796] 
Structural function introduces the sky expanse with its two divisions of sun-moon expanse and jewel-white expanse. View register presents the essence of dharmatā as unalterable self-liberation. Translation risks misinterpret "rin po che'i klong dkar po" as metaphorical rather than technical terminology. Preservation requirements ensure the spontaneous perfection of qualities and self-purification of causes and conditions remains distinct from lower vehicle concepts.
[3797-3808] 
Structural function presents the rab 'byams sde through the essence of appearance known by mind and non-appearance known by natural state. View register classifies four types of vastness: external, internal, secret, and suchness. Translation risks conflate these categories without recognizing their hierarchical relationship. Preservation requirements maintain the three essential points of causelessness, conditionlessness, and non-establishment of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as foundational to the external vastness.
[3809-3817] 
Structural function continues the external vastness exposition emphasizing the non-division of mind through absence of cause. View register asserts the natural state as spontaneously perfect great completion without partiality toward any vehicle. Translation risks obscure "gnas lugs ye rdzogs" as a specific technical classification. Preservation requirements note the phrase "gang yang ma spangs par yongs su rdzogs" establishes the non-rejection completion principle unique to dzogchen.
[3818-3827] 
Structural function presents the secret vastness through recognizing obstacles to appearance as self-liberated pure nature. View register maintains the completion of memory and thought as dharmatā. Translation risks misrepresent "dran bsam rang dag" as mere purified thought rather than the technical process of thought recognizing its own nature. Preservation requirements ensure the distinction between outer and inner obstacles remains clear.
[3828-3837] 
Structural function synthesizes the vastness categories into three divisions through the aspiration-arising great completion. View register presents the fourfold framework of view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. Translation risks conflate "bya spyod chos nyid du grol ba" with lower vehicle conduct concepts. Preservation requirements maintain the technical precision of "thob pa med pas ma thob pa rang la bzhag pa" as fruition without attainment.
[3838-3839] 
Structural function concludes the action-free expanse through the principle of liberation without action. View register establishes "bya ba med pas grol bas grol" as the essential formulation. Translation risks render this as mere passivity rather than spontaneous liberation. Preservation requirements note this phrase encapsulates the entire klong dkar po section's essential meaning.
[3841-3846] 
Structural function introduces the ornament expanse through appearances as mind-stream and emptiness free from grasping. View register presents the non-arising non-ceasing contemplation. Translation risks misinterpret "rgyan gyi klong" as decorative rather than functional ornament. Preservation requirements maintain the citation "mi skye mi 'gag cir mi dgongs" as canonical support.
[3847-3858] 
Structural function presents the play expanse and dharmatā expanse through unceasing manifestation and unaltered self-arising. View register emphasizes the unity of appearance and knowledge. Translation risks conflate "rol pa'i klong" with ordinary play. Preservation requirements ensure the technical term "mthong shes gnyis su med pa" retains its precise meaning of non-dual view and knowledge.
[3859-3870] 
Structural function transitions to the direct approach oral instruction section, establishing three teaching styles. View register presents the me btsa' analogy for hitting the essential point. Translation risks obscure "lam drang thad du smra ba" as merely straightforward rather than technically direct. Preservation requirements distinguish the three styles: scattered speech, conversational speech, and sutra self-commentary style.
[3871-3882] 
Structural function details the scattered speech style through cutting the path extreme and manifesting the power-liberated path. View register presents the ineffability of dharmatā without letters. Translation risks misrepresent "spros gzhi'i tshig tsam du yang ma grub" as mere poetic expression. Preservation requirements note the specific technical vocabulary establishing causeless action and spontaneous liberation without practice.
[3883-3897] 
Structural function introduces the conversational speech style through thought-free natural state without delusion. View register presents the non-dual characteristics free from grasping. Translation risks render "glen pa yengs la bor ba" as mere distraction rather than the technical process of releasing fixation. Preservation requirements maintain the four essential points of wind, channels, body-mind disconnection, and self-liberation of movement.
[3898-3911] 
Structural function presents the sutra self-commentary oral instruction as the source of all teachings cut by suchness. View register establishes the non-difference of nature and cessation of saṃsāra support. Translation risks conflate this with lower vehicle sutra concepts. Preservation requirements note the technical term "stong nyid rtsod gzhi dang bral ba" establishes emptiness free from debate objects.
[3912-3914] 
Structural function introduces the four divisions of view, beginning with the bundle-sealed style. View register distinguishes between appearance as view without contrivance and realized mind as view. Translation risks misrepresent "sgang dril" as mere compression. Preservation requirements maintain the technical precision of the view classifications as specific to man ngag sde.
[3915-3921] 
Structural function continues the view exposition through absence of Buddha name, appearance as view, and measureless view-meditation. View register presents the three characteristics of essence, nature, and marks. Translation risks obscure the technical meaning of "ltos gzhi rang zad." Preservation requirements ensure the threefold liberation of afflictions, absence of acceptance-rejection, and exhaustion of paths remains distinct.
[3922-3928] 
Structural function introduces the obstacle-removing lancet style through cutting the boundary between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. View view register establishes the threefold supportless nature. Translation risks misrepresent "gtar ka" as mere criticism. Preservation requirements note the two divisions of view-meditation warmth obstacle removal and entity dwelling obstacle removal.
[3929-3949] 
Structural function details the view-meditation warmth obstacles through the three stages of unstable, attained, and stable. View register presents the similes of recognizing bandits, adding wood to fire, and army victory. Translation risks render these as mere pedagogical flourish rather than precise technical descriptions. Preservation requirements maintain the specific analogies for each stage and their correspondence to view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. The section concludes with the threefold essential point of conduct purifying appearance, meditation removing movement obstacles, and view removing dharmatā obstacles.
[3950-3958] 
Structural function concludes the entity-dwelling obstacle removal through absence of cause-effect in nature and absence of habituation in marks. View register establishes the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as rotten through investigation. Translation risks misrepresent "rtsa ba rul ba" as mere metaphor. Preservation requirements introduce the hidden-revealed section with its two divisions: one hidden revealing two, and two hidden revealing one.
[3959-3971] 
Structural function details the first pattern where view and conduct revealed hide meditation. View register presents union without beginning or end cutting the extremes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Translation risks conflate "zung 'jug" with tantric union concepts. Preservation requirements ensure the four combinations of hiding and revealing maintain their technical precision.
[3972-3976] 
Structural function introduces the fourth self-clarifying explanation style through cutting word attachment. View register establishes establishment as supreme through non-dwelling. Translation risks render "tshig zhen rgyun chad" as mere intellectual critique. Preservation requirements note the three divisions of delusion-pursuing style, delusion-reversing style, and self-nature thigle placement.
[3977-3988] 
Structural function establishes the delusion-reversing style through cutting the root of delusion as ignorance. View register presents three approaches: cutting delusion at the root, leaving delusion self-purified, and emptying the delusion basis. Translation risks conflate these with path-based methods. Preservation requirements maintain the distinction between "rtsad nas bcad" as decisive cutting versus gradual purification.
[3989-4004] 
Structural function details the three approaches through essence, nature, and marks. View register establishes self-arising wisdom as first awareness and delusion-never-experienced as expansion. Translation risks misrepresent "rang rig pa dang po" as ordinary self-awareness. Preservation requirements note the technical term "khams gsum dong sprugs" as specifically dzogchen terminology.
Structural function presents the thigle self-nature placement through freedom from elaborations and beyond words. View register establishes direct introduction producing decisive confidence. Translation risks conflate "ngo sprad" with ordinary pointing-out. Preservation requirements distinguish between oral transmission with letters and letterless oral transmission as different categories.
Structural function introduces the explanatory transmission with four cycles: outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed secret. View register presents the five poisons as path without abandonment. Translation risks render the four cycles as merely hierarchical rather than structurally distinct. Preservation requirements note the fourfold simultaneity of recognition and attainment, breath cessation and buddhahood, compassion arising and buddhahood, and their corresponding non-reliance on study, effort, and accumulation.
