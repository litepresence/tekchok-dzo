[1949-1961] The text distinguishes two types of nihilism regarding cause and result. The first, cause-nihilism, is held by Nirgranthas and others who deny the continuity of mind from past to present. They posit that mind inherently exists in the four elements, and when these condense through contact with warmth and moisture, the inherent mind awakens and enters the new body. This sophisticated materialism requires careful preservation of its internal coherence.
[1962-1973] The nihilists argue that mind exists in earth producing trees and forests, in water producing moisture and sound, in fire producing burning, in wind producing movement. They conclude that if beings have past lives and mind, so do trees and stones. Yet they deny this, holding instead that present aggregation produces results like curd from milk. The analogy requires preservation of its agricultural context.
[1974-1982] Evidence for their position includes seasonal transformations: from summer's heat and moisture, parts of horse-hoof leaves swell while others remain unchanged; ants become bees, frogs transform. Therefore cause is not permanent. Summer's ants' nests contain twigs and rice husks that become sentient beings. This empirical argumentation requires translation that preserves its observational basis without importing modern biological categories.

[2165-2207] The text enumerates sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety tirthika practitioners with their distinctive characteristics. This cataloging function serves to exhaustively map the field of non-Buddhist spiritual practitioners. The list includes contemplatives, renunciants, and various ascetic types identified by their practices, habitats, and doctrinal affiliations. The view register is doxographical, systematically distinguishing Buddhist from non-Buddhist positions through enumeration. Translation requires preserving the proper names and epithets without attempting to Sanskritize them retroactively. The preservation challenge lies in maintaining the specificity of each category without collapsing them into generic "heretic" labels.
[2208-2244] The classification summarizes that among these practitioners, some assert eternalism, some nihilism, some both, yet all reduce to these two extremes. The citation from Rangshar provides a summary verse: eternalism and nihilism. Nihilism holds that tirthikas are greatly empty, cut off like empty space, viewing nihility as without nature, and results as cut-off emptiness. Eternalism positing non-emptiness is the philosophical position of eternalist vehicles, established as permanent eternalism. Cause-eternalism holds that from the citadel of one's own mind, without father-cause or mother-condition, the size of a mustard seed, sesame grain, or hair-tip, oily coiled white pure, such is the nature of cause, unchanging from the beginning, permanently existent. This cause with habit and aggregates dwells inseparably, therefore held as cause-eternalism. Result-eternalism holds that fortune or great power, served and worshipped through virtue, even when this first body is abandoned, causes rebirth in one's own place. The two, eternalism and nihilism, disagree regarding their own meaning.
[2245-2247] The second section expands on the meaning of the sixtyfold divisions among these positions. This transition indicates the text's movement from summary to detailed exposition, maintaining the structural integrity of the doxographical presentation.

[2316-2326] The text identifies those who assert permanence regarding conduct as believing cause and result are impermanent while conduct is permanent for liberation. They view external houses and homes as permanent, all appearances as permanent. This is viewing what lacks permanent meaning as nihilistic, yet conducting themselves in eternalist philosophical positions. They perform fierce actions emphasizing black mantras, speak in black unbroken continuity, desiring results through strong attachment to this. The view register here reveals the complexity of actual practitioner positions that do not fit neat philosophical categories. Preservation requires maintaining the distinction between asserted view and actual conduct.
[2327-2340] Some emphasize divination and prophecy, looking only to this world's pleasure, saying there is nothing beyond. Some emphasize subtle miraculous powers, believing this world has repelled armies through miracles, and in the future through miracles being suppressed, they will be born in fortune or power's retinue. This view strongly takes up debate, putting forward their own truth while refuting others, desiring meaning. Some also desire meaning from mistaken austerity. Attachment to this world is called worldly Lokayata, engaging in this world's activities. Some, understanding their own truth, also kill others to elevate themselves.
[2341-2349] Some seek meaning through manner or custom. Some make leaf-huts from hair to seek meaning. Some wrap themselves in single cloth saying inner heat has arisen. Some holding khatvanga and damaru as implements claim to be emanation bodies. Some say whatever virtue you do benefits me, desiring meaning from this. Some defeat others' reasoning with their own reasoning, claiming this is my action, desiring meaning from this. Some say cause is cut off like space, completely cut off. Some say this complete cut-off makes their own body empty. Those who say both cause and result are cut off...
[2350-2358] The text continues with cause-cutoff meaning mind is not graspable as thing, result-cutoff meaning no fortune or power. Some say path is cut off, no plants. Wisdom is cut off, no buddhas. No cause or result, empty completely cut off. Some on the path, temporarily cut off, say result is completely cut off. Killing with mistaken mind, some say killing produces meaning.
[2359-2375] Some say cut-off emptiness, because you are cut off and I am cut off, therefore empty, completely nonexistent. Some speak of secret Vedas, meaning sky-like empty completely cut off, existents do not exist as things, a small part exists, capable of appearing to faculties. Those who deviate from partial similarity to insiders are called tirthikas, deviating from similarity to Buddhists through mistaken Buddhist philosophical positions, merely flesh. Those who think all appearance is mind's magical display, teaching all is magical display. Some say these deluded appearances are true, ultimate is nonexistent. Some, anger arising, demons are finished, son of good family should dwell in anger. Some say mind is self-arisen, self-liberated, therefore uncorrectable. Some say deity body meditation alone is sufficient. Some, being tirthikas, deviate from tirthika debate speech. Some say this alone is permanent, therefore nothing to do.
[2376-2380] Kanipa means desiring diffuse meaning. Misers are those who fear appearances ending and emptying. Sambhari means...
[2381-2390] Those who assert no particular meaning and no common meaning. Kabhisha means no common meaning yet asserting any particular meaning. Simdha means asserting nothing exists. Dhasimpha means asserting anything exists. Katipa means asserting anything exists until breath ceases. Sangha means some say entering Sangha appearance is sufficient. Shamkari means impermanent truth. Impermanent compounded truth is fortune or power truth. Dhoshaka means all meaning is included in fortune and power. Some say fortune and power definitely exist on Meru's peak.
[2391-2400] Similarly, perishable composite views numberless, included in two: eternalism and nihilism. From this, countless perishable composite views proliferate. Thus all teachings are included in four: viewing extremes, end of extremes, worldly Lokayata, and diffuse.
[2401-2424] Viewing extremes means asserting permanent eternalism. End of extremes means asserting both: permanent is permanent, impermanent is impermanent. Worldly Lokayata means asserting eternalism-nihilism half-and-half. Diffuse means asserting completely cut off nihilism. This itself included in eternalism-nihilism two. From the previous: all those mistaken views are included in four aspects. Viewing extremes, end of extremes, worldly Lokayata, and diffuse. This explanation system: viewing extremes is permanent eternalism. End of extremes is half-permanent half-nihilism. Diffuse is nihilism completely cut off. Worldly Lokayata is result-cutoff. Thus three hundred sixty also are included in four aspects. These also included in eternalism-nihilism two.
[2425-2427] The purpose of teaching these is not entering through recognizing mistaken paths. From this itself...
[2428-2433] Thus the Sugata spoke: Son of good family, because you doubt having entered mistaken paths, I taught perishable composite views extensively. Externalists' philosophical positions are explained. Second, beyond-world vehicles expanded classification has three: the way of transcending externalists, general designation, and detailed explanation.
[2434-2445] First is accepting the four seals of dharma and going for refuge to the Three Jewels, thus transcending. Among externalist paths, this is absent. The four seals are: all compounded things are impermanent; all with outflows are suffering; all dharmas are empty and selfless; nirvana is peace. Second has five: nature, etymology, classification, purpose, and result. The nature of beyond-world vehicles is whatever dharma classification is the supreme method for definitely extracting from samsara. Etymology is whatever entered produces happiness and joy. From the Sutra: Whatever ridden, all sentient beings transcend sorrow, produce joy, happiness, and virtues. This vehicle is like space, immeasurable great mansion. Classification: small and great two, or Hearers, Solitary Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas' three vehicles, or inconceivable regarding trainees' minds. From Lankavatara: As long as mind engages, vehicles' ends are not reached. Purpose: temporary and ultimate purposes are accomplished. Result: definitely emerging from three realms, obtaining liberation.
[2446-2474] Third, detailed explanation: from Rigpa Rangshar, vehicle classification: Sutra and Great Expansion; and also Super Great Expansion. Super Great Expansion is eighty-four thousand inconceivable, extensively numerous great, inconceivable immeasurable, inexpressible transcending thought great. Great victory: thus the Bodhisattva vehicle, wordless emptiness, nonexistent emptiness is asserted. Thus it was spoken. Second, expanded explanation of established philosophical positions: Mind-Only and Middle Way systems. First, various white-red appearances with consciousness all are asserted as truly mind's aspects: Mind-Only true-aspect and consciousness-aspect false two. First, meaning-appearances are external-sharings of one's own consciousness's aspects only, like jewel-tree-branch-hanging jewels' reflections appearing in water while jewels appear externally. Here classification: as many aspects so many consciousnesses; aspects and consciousness like cracked egg; aspects and consciousness various non-dual three. First, when hearing sound, only sound-grasping consciousness arises, not color-grasping etc., consciousness arises regarding whatever object engaged, others not arising, therefore as many aspects so many consciousnesses.

[2526-2546] The text classifies Sutra, Vinaya, Abhidharma, and Mahayana vehicle as all included in the three baskets, while mantras are Great Abhidharma. Sutra, Vinaya, Abhidharma, and those three equally are twenty-one thousand, eighty-four thousand dharmaskandhas. From this also, regarding each antidote taming beings' thought-aggregates, extensive numerous inconceivable transcending expression exists. Here, from nine vehicle classification, first Hearers' vehicle explanation has five: nature, etymology, purpose, result, and classification. Nature is the method for realizing personal selflessness, wishing for liberation from samsara alone. Etymology is hearing dharma from the Teacher, proclaiming to others, accomplishing final existence enlightenment, Hearers depending on teachers. Purpose: definitely extracting from samsara. Result: obtaining arhatship with or without remainder. Classification: Sutrantikas and Vaibhasikas two.
[2547-2566] Vaibhasika is asserting coarse conventional truth appears like yak-tail whisk and goat-hair assemblage, yet ultimately partless atom particles; consciousness continuum conventional, momentary ultimate without parts like pot-water. From aggregates, elements, and sense-sources, coarse-appearance atoms circling with intervals. Though asserting personal selflessness, asserting dharmic self of atoms and moments exists. This also, knowing cause-result acceptance-rejection regarding dharmas included in four truths, regarding conditions' four aspects, knowing consciousness-aspects: suffering is known, origin is abandoned, path is practiced, cessation is obtained. Knowing abandoning by suffering...
[2567-2576] Empty and selfless realization aspects: path, reasoning, establishment, definite extraction: cessation, peace, excellence, meditating selfless method, abandoning three realms' seeing and meditation's four hundred fourteen to be abandoned, manifesting exhaustion-knowledge and non-arising-knowledge's supreme wisdom, desiring liberation.
[2577-2596] Sutrantikas: regarding four truths' object, knowing twelve consciousnesses as what engages, abandoning eighty-eight afflictive obstructions, desiring supreme wisdom realization. This also, similar to previous personal selflessness, above this through one portion of dharmadhatu transcending. This also, mainly obstructing partite atoms' five knowable bases, mainly mind-basis, peripheral mind-produced basis, non-associated compositional aggregates basis, uncompounded permanent basis, appearance-form's basis, and five's dharmata. Not obstructing merely partless atoms. Through knowing dharmadhatu's half-portion as external coarse-appearance atom-wings not encountering, this also begun, through knowing partless, transcending previous, similar to not asserting atoms due to lack of meaning.
[2597-2606] Both also, when meditating path, five paths' arising sequence diligently practicing, general antidote to three poisons is meditating selflessness and illusion, particular antidotes: desire through eight impure substances and skeleton, anger through love, delusion through dependent origination forward and reverse, thought-antidote through counting exhalation-inhalation. Selflessness meditation also is meditating object-subject cessation cessation nothing-meaning. If sinking, dullness-delusion antidote: directing mind to crown-fire burning.
[2607-2625] Faculties dull and medium, diligent, some obtain result in that life; sharp and Bodhisattvas, some on support having accumulated much previous five paths' collections, in one sitting completing five paths, desiring liberation. This also, from Hearers' vehicle, their path small, medium, great accomplishing Hearers, Solitary Buddhas, and Buddhas' three enlightenments is desired; Mahayana and Mantra path is not desired. This also, Hearers-Solitary Buddhas' white light-seeing ground etc. eight inferior grounds are explained. Depending on this, stream-enterers, once-returners, never-returners, and arhats, each entered and abiding two-two divided, called eight great persons' sequence. Bodhisattvas' Perfect Joy etc. ten grounds also have four sramana results.
[2626-2652] These also, from Rigpa Rangshar: Hearer vehicle thus, entry-door is four truths. Hearers' common entry-door. Classification asserted two aspects: Vaibhasika and Sutrantika. Vaibhasikas' view: aggregates, elements, sense-sources, yak-tail goat-hair manner asserted. Own mind's view transformed, atoms and particles asserted. Thus analyzing, meditating emptiness. Sutrantikas' view: recitation nature, hearing, contemplating, meditating three, three wisdoms meditating, desiring ten grounds' result. Hearers' common aspect: meditating four truths, four results asserted. This meditation system thus: desiring meditating cessation, desiring abandoning origin. Cessation meditation system thus: regarding external elements, non-attached abiding entered, first accustoming to food. Accustomed to food, meditating contemplation concentration, meditating non-conceptual single-pointed meditation. Maitreya Victor's teaching, desiring result.
[2653-2683] Abandoning origin thus: separated from food-concepts, origin continuum severed is desired. This also, anger-antidote meditation, all afflictions abandoned. Ground-path meditation thus: desire-antidote meditation, delusion-antidote meditation, thus path meditation is desiring suffering abandonment. Path meditation system thus: regarding desire's antidote, own forehead's center, white skeleton thumb-sized, white light-attachment meditated, from this producing head-only, then body-only meditated, then own seat-only, then all appearances meditated. Thus three-thousand white, thus white accustomed, desire-suffering abandoned. Delusion-suffering abandonment: own head's crown also, red fire clear resounding...
[2607-2610] Faculties dull and medium, diligent, some obtain result in that life; sharp and Bodhisattvas, some on support having accumulated much previous five paths' collections, in one sitting completing five paths, desiring liberation. This structural presentation establishes the correlation between faculties' sharpness and temporal efficiency in achieving results. The view register bridges Sutric gradualism with Dzogchen's simultaneous perfection, noting that even within the Hearer vehicle, capacities differ radically.
[2611-2625] This also, from Hearers' vehicle, their path small, medium, great accomplishing Hearers, Solitary Buddhas, and Buddhas' three enlightenments is desired; Mahayana and Mantra path is not desired. This also, Hearers-Solitary Buddhas' white light-seeing ground etc. eight inferior grounds are explained. Depending on this, stream-enterers, once-returners, never-returners, and arhats, each entered and abiding two-two divided, called eight great persons' sequence.
