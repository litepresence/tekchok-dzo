[2960-2978] Heat is shown through three aspects: external, internal, and both. External heat generation thus: from second Stainless, appearance-emptiness arises. This is samadhi practice, said to arise on two grounds. Internal heat is on sixth ground, empty-knowable realized. Both heat thus: said to arise from seventh ground. Eighth obtaining patience. Ninth peak culmination. Tenth supreme dharma. Thus desiring ten grounds' attainment. This is Bodhisattva vehicle, wordless emptiness, nonexistent emptiness asserted. Thus spoken.
[2979-2993] Second, expanded established-philosophical-positions explanation: Mind-Only and Middle Way systems. First also, various white-red appearances with consciousness all are asserted as truly mind's aspects: Mind-Only true-aspect and consciousness-aspect false two. First is meaning-appearances as merely external-sharings of own consciousness's aspects, like jewel-tree-branch-hanging jewels' reflections appearing in water while jewels appear externally. Here classification: as many aspects so many consciousnesses; aspects and consciousness like cracked egg; aspects and consciousness various non-dual three. First, when hearing sound, only sound-grasping consciousness arises, not form-grasping etc., consciousness arises regarding whatever object engaged, others not arising, therefore as many aspects so many consciousnesses.
[2994-3008] Second is external-various-appearing also produced from consciousness, aspects and consciousness subject-object one mind arising like cracked egg. Now when holding objects, though one external-aspect consciousness and one internal-holding consciousness arises, beginningless habits make two appear, yet self-awareness one only, no other establishment, like cracked egg. If so, when internal-holding consciousness arises regarding one external-aspect consciousness at that time, two knowledges become simultaneous? Not becoming: because that aspect-consciousness is non-conceptual. Third, though external-objects' aspects variously appear, one internal-holder consciousness knows, like quick monkey entering fort, four corners blurred appearing, looking-looking, one consciousness entering five doors knowing objects. When knowing, aspects and consciousness both are one mind's nature non-dual, like dream-appearances and holder self-appearances both non-dual with one sleep-consciousness.
[3009-3021] Second, false-aspects: external-object these aspect-consciousnesses deluded-appearance habits false, not truly consciousnesses; that meeting-knowledge also false-measured, no measure by true experience; object-consciousness both merely deluded-appearances false-nature is asserted. Here classification: asserting defiled-false and undefiled-pure two. First is present various-aspect-appearances and that meeting-knowledge both merely mind's defilements appearing, ultimately non-dual wisdom with dharmadhatu's qualities merely existing; consciousness-establishment nothing exists. Buddha's dharmakaya without remainder...

[3087-3113] From Kundika Sutra: Thus-gone always unborn dharma, all dharmas like Sugata. Childish minds grasp characteristics, in the world practicing nonexistent dharmas. From Root Wisdom: What dependently arises, unceasing therefore unborn, uncut therefore impermanent, uncoming therefore ungoing, not different meaning not same meaning, elaboration ceasing, peace shown. To that supreme of Perfect Buddhas' speakers, homage. From Refutation of Debate: If I had any thesis, at that time I would have this fault. Because I have no thesis, I am indeed faultless. Because nothing is to be refuted, I refute nothing. Therefore that accusation you made. Thus.
[3114-3130] This also, asserting no composed philosophical position because elaborations cease. Though various-appearances mere-worldly are established as term-knowledge's branch, because this also has no assertion, dharma-appearances transcend true-false, free from existence-nonexistence extremes and present time. This is Buddhists' established-philosophical-position speakers' peak. This's great texts are Middle Way's six reasoning collections: Root Wisdom, Sixty Reasonings, Seventy Emptinesses, Fine Analysis, Refutation of Debate, Establishment of Convention. This also, Arya Nagarjuna's former face: first teaching wheel's four truths' dharma-wheel commentaries, speech collections composed; middle characteristicless dharma-wheel's commentaries, reasoning collections composed; final ultimate discrimination's dharma-wheel's commentaries, praise collections composed. Therefore this master is Second Buddha, turning dharma-wheel.

[3206-3234] Self and pledges, two viewed as master-servant aspect, obstacles pacified, attainments obtained. Depending on common attainments, not abandoning conventional; depending on supreme attainments, not establishing ultimate, therefore especially transcending. Emphasis on visualization is Kriya's and subtle-completion's dispersal-gathering visualization deity meditation: form, sound, and thought-aggregates as deity's body, speech, and mind visualization. Purification emphasizes body-speech's purity sound, therefore visualization emphasizes mind's meditation. Thus also, from Rigpa Rangshar: Kriya vehicle's established-philosophical-position: entry-door is three purities. Bath and cleanliness entering. Protecting samaya thus: one promise, not drinking water, un-distracted conduct acting. Pure actions three done. What are three purities: deity and mandala purity, substances and enjoyment purity, mantra and samadhi purity. Realized view thus: deity and yogi purity two, master and servant manner viewed. Abandoning sequence thus: meat, fish, garlic, and similarly alcohol etc. abandoned. Concentration attachment. Kriya vehicle thus.
[3235-3246] Fifth meaning: both tantra vehicle Upaya is: conduct doing like Kriya, view asserting like Yoga, therefore called neuter vehicle. This also, abiding in bath and cleanliness, making three doors pure, through visualization five manifest-perfections etc., mandala supreme victors etc. accomplished. This also, from Rigpa Rangshar: Upaya thus: view viewing like Yoga, conduct conducting like Kriya. Therefore called both tantra. Thus. Sixth meaning: Yoga tantra vehicle Yoga is...
