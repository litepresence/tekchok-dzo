[5852-5867] The five perfections framework establishes the structural container for the entire exposition. Gnas phun sum tshogs pa sets the spatial coordinates in the vast expanse of dharmadhatu, while ston pa phun sum tshogs pa identifies Samantabhadra as the teacher principle. The recognition that rang sems 'khrul snang constitutes the retinue requires careful preservation in translation, as this collapses the subject-object dichotomy fundamental to the view. The enumeration of external objects and internal cognitions as the five or six aggregates of deluded appearance maintains the technical precision necessary for subsequent realization. The dus phun sum tshogs pa spanning beginningless time without end establishes the temporal dimension beyond conventional linearity.
[5868-5890] The explanation of the common prologue serves as the bridge between conventional sutric presentation and the uncommon dzogchen context. The citation from Thal 'gyur demonstrates the textual authority underlying this transitional structure. The exposition of how the three kayas are expressed through the single essence requires particular attention to the terminology of byin gyis brlabs and gsal dag, which carry specific technical meanings that cannot be reduced to simple causation or clarity. The description of how the teacher's speech manifests according to the listeners' cognition preserves the epistemic framework essential to understanding how teachings appear to different capacities.
[5891-5901] The discussion of sound and letters moves into the subtle domain of how the ineffable expresses itself. The metaphor of echo and the analogy of reflected sound appearing without conceptual construction must be rendered with precision to avoid importing Western philosophical distinctions between representation and reality. The phrase rnam rtog med cing bzo med pa describes a mode of manifestation that operates beyond ordinary cognitive processing, and translation choices here risk either over-intellectualizing or reducing to mere metaphor what the text presents as literal functioning.
[5902-5935] The threefold division of where the tantra emerges structures the cosmology of manifestation. Each of the three locales—chos kyi sku'i gnas, longs spyod rdzogs pa sku'i gnas, and sprul sku'i gnas—requires distinct terminology that preserves their functional relationships. The enumeration of the five mothers, five male bodhisattvas, and eight female bodhisattvas in the sambhogakaya realm presents a conventional enumeration that must be preserved exactly as given. The description of emanated forms in the nirmanakaya realm lists the standard six classes of beings, maintaining consistency with Abhidharma frameworks while preparing for the uncommon presentation to follow.
[5936-5964] The root text from Rin po che spungs pa presents in verse the threefold division of locations where the tantra manifests. The verses distinguish the dharmakaya expression characterized by freedom from elaboration, the sambhogakaya expression of spontaneous self-arisen letters, and the nirmanakaya expression that accommodates disciples' capacities. The technical term spros med appears in multiple contexts with slightly different applications, requiring careful attention to preserve its specific meaning in each instance. The phrase rang gsal dag pa'i longs sku describes a mode of clarity and purity that is intrinsic rather than achieved, and translation must avoid implying a process of purification.
[5965-5981] The continuation of the verse structure moves through the three kayas systematically. The dharmakaya section emphasizes the absence of characteristics and the expression of great equality. The sambhogakaya section describes the emanation of teachings from the gathering of the five wisdoms. The nirmanakaya section addresses the six classes of beings according to their respective capacities. Preservation of the enumeration and sequence is essential, as these verses function as a summary framework that subsequent exposition will elaborate.
[5982-6020] The citation from the sbyong rgyud and the explanation of 'di skad bdag gis thos pa establishes the lineage transmission through direct hearing. The identification of the compiler as Vajrapani hearing from Samantabhadra preserves the mythic structure of transmission that operates outside ordinary temporal sequence. The four purposes of presenting the common prologue—establishing confidence in the teacher, maintaining unbroken lineage, demonstrating consistency across time, and generating faith in the retinue—structure the hermeneutical approach. The refutation of the objection that this is a fabricated teaching requires careful translation of the logical structure to preserve the argumentative force without distortion.
[6021-6049] The third main topic addresses the prophecy of the sublime definitive teaching. The three aspects—teaching, supports of the teaching, self-arisen letters, and the three vajras, along with the individuals who uphold them—structure the prophetic framework. The explanation of the manner in which the teaching arose begins with the first Samantabhadra establishing the pure realm of Ogmin, from which Vajradhara emerged through blessing and established subsequent pure realms. The preservation of technical terms like byin rlabs and bkod pa requires consistency with their usage throughout the text, as these carry specific implications about the nature of manifestation and establishment that differ from conventional causation.
[6065-6110] The verse from Sgra thal 'gyur establishes the mechanism of emanation resting in body, speech, and mind while appearing to disciples. The detailed explanation of how the teaching support emerged describes Vajradhara establishing the Tshangs chen realm and the subsequent passage of countless aeons before this world system formed. The seven periods of waxing and waning—snying po ldan, rdzogs ldan, rdzogs ldan chen po, nyis ldan, sum ldan, rtsod ldan, and rtsod ldan chen po—structure the temporal framework for understanding the duration and quality of teachings. The dark aeons between each period must be enumerated precisely to preserve the cosmological structure.
[6111-6138] The prophecy continues with the seven periods specified in detail, each lasting specific durations in the northern, southern, eastern, and western directions. The preservation of the names of the location holders, their patrons, and the exact durations in years maintains the predictive structure. The technical term bstan pa'i btsas refers to the supports of the teaching in a specific sense that differs from the teachings themselves, and this distinction requires careful terminology. The mention of the final dissolution into the great void establishes the temporal limits of this world system's capacity to sustain manifestation.
[6139-6196] The continuation of the prophecy moves through the seven periods with increasing specificity. The holder Blo gros bzang po and the five hundred fifty years represent the current period according to the text's reckoning. The distinction between those who remain on this earth and those who retreat to khecara realms preserves the view of simultaneous manifestation in multiple dimensions. The citation from Ati bkod pa chen po provides scriptural authority for the specific predictions about the degenerate age, including the shortening of lifespans, internal disputes among practitioners, and the eventual disappearance of the teachings into non-manifestation.
[6197-6261] The Sgra thal 'gyur citation presents the near-causes of teaching destruction through specific individuals with particular physical characteristics who will appear in various regions. The detailed descriptions of their physical marks, locations, and the durations of darkness they cause structure the prophetic narrative. Each figure is associated with specific directions and intervals of sixty years of darkness. The systematic enumeration of these obstacles to the teaching establishes the pattern of cyclical emergence and withdrawal that characterizes the tantric presentation of historical process.
[6262-6295] The prophecy continues through the remaining periods, specifying the holders and their patrons through the seven cycles. The holder Shakya dzI ka appears in the central region, maintaining the teaching for ten years like a blazing lamp. The completion of the seven cycles of waxing and waning leads to the teaching supports departing for the southern realm of Mdzes ldan bkod pa after the human lifespan reaches ten years. The subsequent passage through other world systems—Yangs pa skyob pa and Gtsug phud dbyangs yangs—with their respective durations establishes the continuation of the teaching beyond this world system's dissolution.
[6296-6342] The explanation of the teaching's duration in other world systems culminates in the description of the final dissolution. The Buddha Utpal me tog mdzes holds the teaching essence for five thousand years in the Yangs pa skyob pa realm, followed by the Buddha 'Khor ba 'jig in the Gtsug phud dbyangs ldan realm for seven hundred thousand years. After eighty-five aeons, all phenomena dissolve into the buddha nature, and the world realms become space itself. The subsequent emergence of beings from the expanse and the re-establishment of the Tshangs chen realm by Vajradhara repeats the cycle without beginning or end.
[6343-6382] The distinction between actual teachings and representational supports clarifies the mechanism of transmission. The explanation of how emanated images pervade the six realms according to beings' faith and the teacher's blessing establishes the universal accessibility of the teachings. The actual teachings of the two kayas—dharmakaya and sambhogakaya—manifest as the teacher's own pure appearance, existing eternally in the pure realms. The differentiation between common vehicles and uncommon secret essence vehicles maintains the hierarchical structure of the path while affirming the unique efficacy of this specific transmission.
[6383-6400] The Bkod pa chen po citation enumerates the benefits of holding this teaching—mastery of all arts, sciences, sounds, and meaning without study. The offering and praise to this unsurpassed secret essence generates supreme and common attainments. The preservation of these enumeration structures is essential, as they function as supports for realization. The identification of this teaching as the lamp that illuminates the world's darkness establishes its soteriological function.
[6401-6426] The explanation of the individuals who uphold the teaching presents three categories: general history of previous occurrences, enumeration of those who attained liberation, and prophecy of the definitive awareness-holders. The opening of the first aeon with Samantabhadra realizing luminosity and establishing the pure realm sets the pattern for all subsequent manifestation. The description of the six hundred and forty thousand aeons during which beings are tamed by the secret essence mind establishes the vast temporal scale of this teaching's efficacy.
[6427-6454] The detailed enumeration of the buddhas from the first Mngon 'phags dran pa mgon through the degenerate age holder Ye shes mgon establishes the complete lineage. The structure of one aeon, one buddha, one retinue, and one liberation method preserves the systematic presentation. The description of how the rang byung chen po'i yi ge remains present throughout, emerging from the blessings of all these buddhas, connects the temporal succession to the atemporal source. The preservation of the names and sequence maintains the textual authority and serves as a support for devotion.
[6455-6487] The explanation clarifies that the innumerable buddhas mentioned represent a summary of those in other aeons and intermediate aeons. The detailed enumeration of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh teachings establishes the pattern. The Buddha Sangs rgyas stong gi thugs nyid dril in the third teaching, the Buddha Sangs rgyas stong gis mnga' dbang bsgyur in the fourth, and subsequent holders maintain the structural consistency. The total of six hundred and forty thousand buddhas all holding this secret essence establishes the pervasiveness of this teaching across all times.
[6488-6511] The clarification explains that these six hundred and forty thousand represent the emanations of the first lord, with actually nineteen hundred thousand buddhas appearing for disciples. The description of this establishment as existing in the heart-center of Vairocana within the pure realm of Samantabhadra presents a mandala structure that defies ordinary spatial conception. The citations from Uttaratantra and Dkon mchog brtsegs pa establish scriptural authority for the inconceivability of buddha activity, emphasizing that even tenth-level bodhisattvas cannot fathom these dimensions, much less ordinary intellect.
[6512-6546] The enumeration of those liberated in Jambudvipa through this secret essence teaching presents specific numbers: sixty years of age, one hundred thousand liberations through natural dissolution of phenomena, five hundred with the mark of the dge sbyong gzugs, and so forth. The distinction between those liberated in this life and those in the intermediate state requires precise terminology to preserve the technical distinctions. The citation from Bkod pa chen po provides the scriptural basis for these enumerations, establishing the teaching as the heart of all results.
[6547-6582] The explanation emphasizes that all who attained buddhahood did so through the door of this secret essence, realizing the naturally luminous essence of awareness. The recognition that this teaching is the heart of all results, distinct from other paths, requires careful articulation to avoid sectarian distortion while maintaining the text's self-presentation. The term 'bras bu'i thus ka—the causal condition of the result—describes the meeting with this teaching as the decisive factor for swift liberation. The threefold liberation—in this life, in the intermediate state, or in the natural nirmanakaya realm—structures the soteriological outcomes according to capacity.
[6583-6625] The prophecy of lineage holders from the Sgra thal 'gyur enumerates the succession beginning with Dharma me tog in Uddiyana. The systematic presentation of each holder—their location, duration of holding the teaching, and the successor—establishes the transmission line. The appearance of the Brahmin youth Manjushrimitra after seventy-five years, followed by Shrismha in the So sha gling, Dznyana Sutra in the outcaste class, and subsequent holders through various social classes demonstrates the teaching's accessibility beyond conventional hierarchies. The mention of our own teacher Dge slong dpal ldan as an emanation of the Lord of Beings Ku maradza connects the prophecy to immediate experience.
