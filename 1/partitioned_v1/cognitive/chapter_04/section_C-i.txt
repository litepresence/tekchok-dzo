[6626-6674] The detailed explanation of why this teaching is the definitive one presents five specific characteristics: marks on the body, surpassing others in essential instructions, demonstrating clairvoyance through prophecy, clarifying difficult points, and displaying wondrous signs even at passing. These criteria establish the authoritative basis for recognizing authentic transmission. The identification of the teacher as the ornament of Jambudvipa, who liberates beings without effort, preserves the view of the master's function. The prayer verses express devotion while maintaining the structural integrity of the lineage narrative.
[6675-6713] After the seven lineages of awareness-holder victors complete their activity in Jambudvipa, the teaching moves to other realms following the lifespan of ten years. The Buddha Utpal me tog mdzes appears in Yangs pa skyob pa, engaging in enlightened activity for beings. After this aeon ends, the aeon of 'Khor ba dong sprugs manifests, where Buddha 'Khor lo glog gi phreng ba holds the teaching and liberates beings from samsara. The dissolution of the realms and the entry of the teaching supports into the expanse of suchness marks the completion of one great cycle.
[6714-6754] Following the long dissolution, the subsequent emergence repeats the pattern. The citation from Sgra thal 'gyur chen po presents the cycle of teaching emergence across seven realms, with the final teaching in this world system occurring when the lifespan reaches ten years and the essence of the teaching appears. The mention of two hundred years of darkness, three hundred years, five hundred years, and the re-emergence of the teaching's fire establishes the cyclical nature of manifestation. The structure of ten hearers, twenty thousand arhats, and the 'dul ba teaching for one aeon preserves the systematic presentation.
[6755-6776] The citation completes the description of the final aeons, including two dark aeons, the birth of the teacher, the gathering of eight thousand bodhisattvas as the retinue, and the Abhidharma teaching for one hundred aeons with all attaining the result in one lifetime. The dissolution of samsara at this time and the non-existence of the six classes of beings marks the completion. The subsequent twenty thousand aeons without embodied beings leads to the re-emergence through the power of karma, demonstrating the cyclical nature of manifestation dependent on conditions.
[6777-6800] The clarification addresses differing views among teachers regarding whether Samantabhadra's realm alone dissolves or whether the realms established by Vajradhara also dissolve. The resolution affirms that both are correct—Samantabhadra's compassion liberates all, and the awakening of potential from the expanse remains without contradiction. The transition marks the completion of the fifth chapter on difficult points in the definitive secret essence, concluding the presentation of establishing confidence in the lineage.
[6801-6829] The sixth chapter addresses the topic of empowerment, the door of entry into the unsurpassed vehicle. The threefold structure—basis for entering empowerment, actual path of empowerment, and complete result of empowerment—organizes the presentation. The first section on the teacher's characteristics presents the Rang shar citation enumerating twelve qualities: possessing vajra meaning, good fortune, skill with students, obtained empowerment, accomplished in secret mantra meaning, unobstructed with yidam deity, undistracted in samadhi, learned in dzogchen instructions, accomplished in external and internal activities, not departing from view, engaged in secret activities, and abiding like a jewel mine of inexhaustible qualities.
[6830-6855] The Sgra thal 'gyur citation presents the definitive characteristics: the root of all qualities, holding the basis of complete enlightenment, and six perfections including abandoning samsaric phenomena, few desires and contentment, skill in methods with experience, learned in tantra meaning and diligent in practice, skilled in view with complete ability, and great compassion delighting in generosity. The term dpal ldan rdo rje 'dzin pa refers to the glorious vajra holder as the fully qualified teacher, embodying the capacity to plant the seeds of the six classes of beings and purify the six afflictions while manifesting the six wisdoms.
[6801-6831] The classification of teachers distinguishes root and branch teachers. The root teacher, based on empowerment, explains tantra, gives oral instructions, and maintains the continuity of practice. The branch teacher of oral instructions relies on empowerment as the basis, with explaining tantra as the secondary condition, and receiving oral instructions transforming the branch into a second root teacher. The supplementary explanation of teachers to be abandoned presents the Rang shar citation enumerating ten characteristics of unsuitable teachers: great ignorance and pride, foolishness and verbosity, not understanding secret mantra meaning, arrogance about harming others, entering wrong paths, not seeing the mandala of empowerment, violating samaya, unable to answer questions, little learning and great pride—these are demons of students, not secret mantra teachers, incapable of teaching ati dzogchen, to be avoided.
[6832-6855] The student's nature presents the ten qualities: aversion to samsaric phenomena, devotion and longing for the teacher, dharma, and companions, stable faith not attending to things other than dharma, interest in definitive meaning with generosity and diligence, few attachments and good fortune, great wisdom and abiding in samaya and vows, concordance with others' minds and turning the mind to dharma, listening to the teacher's words and not squandering the secret, great learning and tamed mind, and specifically viewing the teacher as buddha or greater. The student possessing these ten qualities is the excellent supreme student who will certainly attain liberation from samsara.
[6856-6898] The supplementary section on students to be abandoned presents characteristics that render individuals unsuitable vessels: not showing respect and humility, engaging secret mantra loosely, lacking family lineage and good fortune, little wisdom, disparaging kindness, proclaiming one's own family, adorning the body with ornaments, and engaging in meaningless activity—such a student is a demon of teachers to those who speak the meaning of dzogchen. The analogy of pouring lion's milk into a clay vessel that cannot contain it illustrates the unsuitability. If poured, the dharma's power degenerates and the unsuitable vessel falls into lower realms. Therefore, oral instructions of dzogchen should be kept secret from those of lesser intelligence.
[6899-6902] The common practices section presents three aspects: common consideration between teacher and student, methods of service and supplication, and the result of definite necessity.
[6903-6938] The first aspect of common practice describes how the teacher regards the student with uninterrupted compassion, bestowing benefit through timely instruction, sustenance, and nourishment, while the student contemplates the teacher's qualities with continuous devotion and longing. The supplication method requires approaching with offerings for five, seven, or three years prior, presenting mandalas of gold and assemblies, and repeatedly requesting specific empowerments and instructions. The meditation on the teacher above the crown six times daily establishes the basis for the blessing to enter. The teacher's response involves bestowing permission to supplicate while practicing meditation on the teacher above the crown to clear obstacles and purify defilements.
[6939-6954] The purpose of this preparation involves ripening the body into the deity's form, the speech into the natural sound of ali kali, and the mind into emptiness beyond conception. The intense aspiration to definitely obtain the desired empowerment produces signs of accomplished masters appearing in dreams, giving teachings and prophecies. The result of definite necessity establishes that through serving the teacher and supplicating in this manner, all desired qualities arise like wish-fulfilling jewels and trees, turning one back from the battle of samsara.
[6955-6987] The fourth aspect of how empowerment is conferred presents five topics: benefits of empowerment, faults of not receiving empowerment, locations for empowerment, timings for empowerment, and the sequence of the ganacakra celebration. The benefits section cites Rang shar presenting the essential qualities: unimpeded entry into great wisdom light, appearance shown as friendly companion, and all activities accomplished. The Rin po che'i rgyud citation establishes that completing the empowerment ritual with a teacher who has abandoned desires definitely leads to becoming a great vajra holder in this life. The gsang snying citation emphasizes that empowerment with the five essences makes one a victorious one's son with no lower rebirths and attainment of the lord of high liberation.
[6988-7011] The additional benefits from Rang shar include recognizing one's own appearances in the intermediate state, gaining stability in that recognition, and the capacity to emanate the nirmanakaya for twenty-one days. Those with supreme faculties will not experience suffering, fear, or terror, and at the time of practice, wisdom light will appear unceasingly—these are special qualities. Common benefits include understanding dakini speech, receiving dakini blessings, being seen as worthy of respect by humans, loving all beings, beautiful and pleasant appearance, increase of great merit, birth as a wheel-turning king after death, arising of great qualities like jewels, engaging in pure dharma like lotus, being seen as worthy of circumambulation like a stupa, surpassing ordinary beings like a parasol, and liberating beings with wisdom like fire. These and similar qualities numbering one hundred and eight arise, and all activities become accomplished, unobstructed by obstacles and misleading forces, with the signs of obtaining empowerment including many children and great prosperity, remembering previous lives, seeing beings taking birth, knowing others' minds, and subduing non-humans and demons.
[7012-7029] The second topic addresses the faults of not receiving empowerment. The Sgyu 'phrul gsang snying citation states that without pleasing the teacher and obtaining empowerments, listening and other endeavors will be fruitless and destroyed. The dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud compares attempting secret mantra without relying on empowerment to trying to cross a river without a boatman's hand—impossible. These citations establish the necessity of the empowerment process as the foundation for all subsequent practice.
