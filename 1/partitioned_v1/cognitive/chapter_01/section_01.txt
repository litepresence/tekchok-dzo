[1-11] 
Opening frame with triple ornamental shad establishing textual authority. Sanskrit incipit in Tibetan script, bilingual titular protocol declaring Indian origin and Tibetan rendering. Standard mdzod colophon formula marks treasury genre. Homage to Samantabhadra as primordial dharmakāya. The Tibetan text uses phrasing that positions Sanskrit as source and Tibetan as derived, though both coexist as parallel authorities. Translate the Sanskrit restoration carefully following IAST conventions. Retain bzhugs so as formulaic presence-marker, not mere location. Kun tu bzang po must remain as Samantabhadra, not reduced to All-Good.
[12-15] 
First homage verse establishing fivefold refuge mandala. Samantabhadra possesses five perfections in nature, five family regents emerge as sambhogakāya, five vidyādharas carry aural lineage, three worlds comprise retinue, culminating in source of auspiciousness receiving crown offering. The structure builds hierarchical ascent through anaphoric chains. Five perfections formula references teacher, retinue, place, teaching, time condensed into one. Snyan brgyud denotes unbroken whispered transmission. The cosmological enumeration must not flatten into mere list; maintain mandala ascent.
[16-19] 
Second homage shifting to dharmakāya register. Primordial purity, cessation of all elaboration, dharmatā, clear light, seven horses as sun metaphor, non-abiding in existence or peace, uncompounded nature, spontaneous accomplishment. Culminates in Vajra-point and Sugata-essence. Technical Dzogchen vocabulary requires precise rendering: gdod nas as from the primordial, spros kun zhi ba as cessation of elaboration, srid zhir mi gnas as transcendence of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dichotomy. Lhun gyis grub must retain spontaneously accomplished without fabrication. These terms anchor the view.
[20-23] 
Third homage establishing vehicle hierarchy. Dharma-sun as source, vast and immeasurable. Unsurpassed secret vajra vehicle as supreme among paths. Great Perfection positioned as pinnacle vehicle. Prayer for protection of mind-lotus follows as conventional frame. Vehicle stratification is clear: causal vehicles below, resultant tantra above, Atiyoga at apex. Rang bzhin denotes self-existing, not constructed through practice. Bde gshegs snying po as Sugata-essence signals Buddha-nature doctrine.
[24-27] 
Composition declaration in four-line verse. Makara throne as mythological place, vajra essence sphere as nature, profound and vast abodes as subject matter. Future tense declaration establishes autocommentary genre. Fourfold structure names place, essence, clarification, action. The makara throne signals non-ordinary setting. Rnam par bshad bya in future tense marks shift from homage to exposition. Preserve the architectural clarity of the fourfold declaration.
[28-35] 
Transition to autocommentary prose body. Trikāya manifestation as basis for threefold classification: teacher, place, teaching as organizing principles. Perfect place defined as dharmatā luminous-clarity ground. Uncompounded qualities spontaneously manifest as appearance in precious field. The trikāya structure is universal Buddhist framework, not unique to Dzogchen. Gzhi as ground serves as basis for both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Threefold classification by teacher-place-teaching follows standard commentarial convention.
[36-40] 
Exposition of perfect teacher as Samantabhadra possessing complete dominion together with wisdom-ocean retinue. Body and wisdom abide non-dually in intention. Teaching beyond cause-effect and effort characterizes dharmakāya nature. Temporal frame places this in dharmatā beyond effort, abiding in primordial sphere of subtle inner clarity-wisdom. The negation rgyu 'bras bya rtsol las 'das pa is definitive Dzogchen marker requiring both cause-effect and action-effort, not merely effort. Body-wisdom inseparability denotes non-dual ground state. Primordial sphere signals atemporal non-beginning.
[41-45] 
Exposition of perfect place arising from ground-nature or blessing as self-appearing field. Dense arrangement of self-appearance adorned with outer clarity five lights. Five family teachers self-appearing as mandala play. Teaching specification: dharmatā luminous-clarity Great Perfection spontaneously accomplished. Great self-arisen wisdom beyond object of pure trainees. The ambiguity ngang ngam allows nature or blessing as source. Rang snang as self-appearing excludes external existence and mental construction. Las dag pa'i gdul bya denotes advanced practitioners who still cannot objectify this level.
[46-51] 
Sambhogakāya enumeration: sixth teacher Vajradhara of complete marks arising in Akanishta field through strength and blessing. Fivefold retinue comprises earth-dwellers, awareness-holders, ḍākiṇīs, accomplished ones, completely arranged self-appearances. Teaching result-vajra vehicle tantra sections ocean-like. Sixth teacher denotes sambhogakāya Buddha in tantric cosmology distinct from five dhyāni Buddhas. Retinue includes both pure realm and impure realm beings. Result vehicle marks tantric path distinct from causal vehicles.
[52-56] 
Nirmāṇakāya exposition. Perfect place appearing individually to beings' self-appearances. Perfect teacher as emanation-body manifesting as holy guides adapting to capacity. Teaching perfections appear as three baskets when karma and aspiration pure. The transition from tantric to sutric presentation is structural, not chronological. Individual self-appearances signal subjective perception rather than objective reality. Three baskets as causal vehicle positioned below resultant path.
[57-58] 
Vehicle hierarchy conclusion. Three causal characteristic vehicles as cause and method for entering result-vajra vehicle. Secret mantra vajra vehicle as completely complete peak. Supreme result equals natural Great Perfection as unsurpassable vehicle. Stratification is explicit: Causal below, Tantric intermediate, Dzogchen supreme. Rgyu mtshan nyid denotes svabhāvavāda or causal characteristics. Rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po explicitly positioned as supreme result not acquired through practice.
[59-60] 
Definitive determination of place specified as luminous-clarity vajra-essence teaching. Characterized as unsurpassable mind-secret of all Tathāgatas, the great completely-complete vajra place of wondrous marvelous self-nature. Establishes tantric authority through epistemological definiteness. Gnas nges pa denotes technical term for definitive specification of ground. Thugs kyi gsang ba marks innermost dimension requiring transmission. Ngo mtshar rmad du byung ba functions as standard tantric epithet of wonder. The self-nature as marvelous signals primordial perfection without contrivance.
[61-64] 
Explicit citation from Guhyagarbha Tantra. Threefold cosmogonic presentation: primordial protector's manifest enlightenment and field arrangement, peaceful attainment in this field through Vajradhara's emanation, Dharma-wheel turning through emanation-body elaboration. Sequential trikāya emanation structure. Guhyagarbha serves as supreme Nyingma tantric authority warranting this cosmogony. Threefold manner denotes process description, not ontological assertion. Trikāya emanation sequence follows dharmakāya to sambhogakāya to nirmāṇakāya.
[65-71] 
Detailed cosmogony narrative. First stage before all, without division of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa. Complete sovereign teacher Samantabhadra. Self-arising wisdom of expanse from primordial basis arising as basis-appearance. Moment of transcending basis recognizing self-appearance. Three self-arising dharmas spontaneously accomplishing precious cavity. Primordial exhaustion-place of great primordial purity. Youth vase body field conquering ground seized. Abandonment-realization qualities complete, becoming Buddha in dharmakāya nature, abiding in inner clarity. This presents primordial enlightenment preceding all manifestation. Gzhi snang as basis-appearance signals spontaneous display from ground. Youth vase body denotes form of spontaneous presence. Inner clarity marks dharmakāya abiding mode.
[72] 
Sambhogakāya field description pervaded by five wisdoms. Self-appearing spontaneous mandala to limits of sky. Five families as individual self-appearances beyond trainee objects. Five wisdoms manifest as five Buddha aspects. Sambhogakāya field appears as spontaneous display, not constructed visualization. Beyond trainee objects signals transcendence of all conceptual practice. The field extends to nam mkha'i mtha' klas pa, sky's limit.
[73-75] 
Compassion narrative. Long after primordial awakening, from basis-appearance potency seeing beings move like dreams without cause of confusion. Compassion arising for beings' benefit. Field arrangement from self-appearing enjoyment-body appearance aspect. Five-family Buddhas as great ocean bodies pervading to sky limits. Temporal gap de nas ring zhig na separates primordial enlightenment from compassionate response. 'Khrul rgyu med without cause of confusion is key Dzogchen point. Compassion arises from recognition, not from suffering. Sambhogakāya display functions as compassionate response to non-existent confusion.
[76-80] 
Mandala enumeration section. Precious mudra wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, cross patterns appearing in hollow spaces. Lotus growing from the center supports twenty-five fields in dimensional hierarchy. The five emblems correspond to five families: vajra (Akṣobhya), jewel (Ratnasambhava), lotus (Amitābha), crossed vajra (Amoghasiddhi), with Buddha Vairocana implicit. This architectural description requires maintaining spatial relationships without flattening into inventory.
[81-87] 
Pore-mandala cosmology. From pore-holes flow scented water streams as great oceans. Within earth, water, fire, wind particles, all spaces contain Buddha blessings and beings' karma-fields distinct. The ba spu'i khung as pore-holes signals micro-macrocosm identity. Gar khyab as pervasive presence dissolves ordinary spatial limits. Two types of fields: blessed by Buddhas and karmic, operating simultaneously without confusion.
[88-97] 
Infinite field manifestations. Round, square, oblong, crescent shapes with immeasurable forms and arrangements appearing inconceivably. Sky-pervasion corresponds to body, speech, mind, qualities, activities and fields arising from these. The geometric forms reference traditional Indian cosmology shapes. Fields emerging from five aspects parallels five Buddha wisdoms. Rtag pa rgyun gyi 'khor mor denotes perpetual wheel of benefit.
[98-105] 
Cosmic scope and timelessness. All benefit as activity of original Samantabhadra's field. Vast as dharmadhātu and space. Cannot be measured by years, eons, dust-oceans of fields. Neither beginning nor end can be determined. Unmoving spontaneously accomplished great field-ocean essence. Natural spontaneous Buddha as teacher of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa since beginningless time. The temporal language paradoxically describes atemporal reality. Mi g.yo as unmoving signals unchanging ground.
[106-111] 
Trikāya field classification. Dharmakāya time: Luminous-clarity vajra-essence field. Sambhogakāya time: Brahmā drum-sound field. Nirmāṇakāya time: Great Brahmā eon or field. This is Samantabhadra's emanation-Buddhas, those blessed by him, and teachers gone to three times. The threefold temporal classification maintains trikāya structure throughout. Time here denotes dimension, not chronological sequence. Emanation hierarchy: direct emanations and blessed manifestations.
[112-114] 
Universal sentient being realm. All sentient being realms exist, extremely vast as field to be tamed. Earth, water, fire, wind, space pervade everywhere, all contained within great Brahmā eon. The gdul zhing as field-to-be-tamed implies pedagogical relationship, not ontological category. Spatial elements as containers reference traditional cosmology. Thams cad tshangs chen gyi bskal pa'i khongs su 'dul signals macrocosmic containment.
[115-122] 
Micro-macrocosm identity in deluded perception. Within beings' deluded appearance, even within one atom's scope appear immeasurable fields beyond count. Pure karma appearance shows great Buddha activities variously: passing beyond sorrow, teaching remaining, path accomplishment, etc. Impure experience shows teaching decline, lower realms appearance, eon destruction, happiness-suffering varieties. All like dream. The rdul phran re'i go na as scope of one atom signals infinite worlds within each point. Las dag pa'i snang ba denotes karmically purified perception revealing Buddha activity.
[123-124] 
Epistemological status of appearances. Thus even within one atom's scope appearing as great fields with mountains, islands: beings' deluded appearance. Actually non-existent clear appearance, therefore tenable. 'Gro ba'i 'khrul snang as beings' deluded perception frames all experience as misperception. Don la med pa as actually non-existent signals emptiness. Gsal snang as clear appearance maintains luminous quality despite emptiness.
[125-161] 
Scriptural citation from Samādhirāja Sūtra. Proofs of inconceivable Buddha-fields: within hair-tip space many Buddhas as Ganges sand-grains. Those victorious ones have equal number of fields. Different characteristics, unequal eons. Within hair-tip five realms: hell beings, animals, Yama world, gods, humans. Non-mixed, non-harmful. Those abodes with lakes and oceans, rivers, pools, non-mixed, non-harmful. Thus victorious ones' Dharma inconceivable. Those abodes many mountains: surrounding Meru, Sumeru, Btang zung, great Btang zung, Vulture Peak, Snow Mountain. There unbearable hell beings, hot and very hot, unpleasant. Those hell beings experience suffering. Those abodes gods' measureless palaces, twelve leagues delightful, thousands of gods experience great divine bliss. Those abodes Buddhas arise, world-knowing teachings blaze. Those same abodes Dharma declines, guide's passing beyond sound also heard. Impure beings in own homes like dream, enjoying desirable qualities, upon waking do not see those desires. Know that as dream. Thus seen, heard, known, distinguished, all these like dream, untrue. The detailed enumeration demonstrates simultaneous presence of contradictory realms within single space. Hair-tip as unit of measure signals microcosm containing macrocosm. Non-mixing despite proximity maintains karmic separateness.
[162] 
Conclusion of citation. Thus within one dust-mote's world, within appearing subtle dusts also sentient being fields and arrangements immeasurable. Reiterates micro-macrocosm principle as established through scripture.
[163-170] 
Scriptural citation from Inconceivable Buddha-Field and Wisdom Sūtra. Hierarchical vision capacity: gods and humans of three thousand worlds fewer than one outsider ṛṣi with clairvoyance sees beings within cart-wheel's extent. That vision exceeds śrāvakas' eight liberations, one dhyāna practitioner sees more within cart-wheel. That exceeds bodhisattvas' eight liberations, one dhyāna practitioner sees more. That exceeds Tathāgata's vision sees more within cart-wheel's extent. Progressive hierarchy establishes Buddha-vision as supreme. Cart-wheel as unit of measure signals limited scope containing infinite content. The comparative structure demonstrates quantitative transcendence at each level.
[171-176] 
Cosmic pervasion and emanation. Thus wherever sky pervades as place, sentient beings pervade. Those pervaded by Buddha emanations doing benefit, some directly by Samantabhadra's emanations, some by Buddhas included in other tantras, all arising from Samantabhadra first showing path, generating mind. Called Samantabhadra's tantric benefit. The emanation hierarchy distinguishes direct from indirect manifestation. Rgyud as tantra or continuum signals unbroken lineage.
[177-179] 
Canonical reference. These meanings in some treatises: Buddha from Dharma, Dharma from Saṅgha of Āryas. Sequence of arising intention. Reference to dependent origination formula applied to three jewels hierarchy.
[180-182] 
Transition to second topic. In this field Vajradhara's peaceful attainment, some think from primordial protector, different tantra sentient beings generate mind. This is incorrect. Polemical refutation establishing correct view. Kha cig signals opponent position to be rejected.
[183-189] 
Scriptural proof from Guhyagarbha. First victorious one, earth-victorious one, great being, great destroyer. This teacher Vajradhara, Buddha before all Buddhas. Contradicts opponent view. Citation from root tantra as authoritative refutation.
[190-191] 
Resolution. Therefore for this field's beings' benefit, from primordial time Samantabhadra's emanations taught like ordinary beings generating mind, manner of becoming Buddha, great activities play. Such manner renowned in common sūtras too. Resolution synthesizes apparent contradiction: emanations appear as ordinary while being primordially enlightened.
