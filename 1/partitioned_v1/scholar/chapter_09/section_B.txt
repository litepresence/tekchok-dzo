[16422-16429] [STRUCTURE] # Correspondence with Four Lamps
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes the relationship between the bindu/dot structure and the Four Lamps:
1. **Rtsa sna chu'i sgron ma'i cha** — Channel nose: part of Water Lamp
2. **Thig le** — Dot: part of Empty Lamp (*stong sgron*)
3. **'Od lnga** — Five lights: part of Sphere Lamp (*dbyings kyi cha*)
4. **Shes pa mi rtogs pa** — Non-conceptual consciousness: part of Wisdom Lamp (*shes rab kyi sgron ma*)
This establishes a hierarchical and functional correspondence between the subtle body physiology and the fourfold *thod rgal* framework.
[16430-16433] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*):
The verse cites the tantric source for the bindu-wisdom correspondence: "Thought-free awareness vajra necklace / appears from the door of Great Bliss Brahma."
[16430] [PHILOLOGY] The genitive *las* following *mu tig 'phreng ba* indicates source: "from the Pearl Garland."
[16434-16445] [STRUCTURE] # Manner of Arising
**Analysis:** Longchenpa explains the embryological genesis (*skyed tshul*) of the Water Lamp:
- Arises from navel (*lte ba nas*)
- Source: *sgron ma 'bar ba* tantra
- First formation: enters mother's womb
- Body's essence: great navel channel-knot
- Center triangle: from father-mother cause-condition essence
- Eye fruit forms
- Father-mother portions mixed: white-black (*dkar nag 'dres pa*)
[16434-16445] [PHILOLOGY] Embryological terminology:
- *Ma'i mngal* (mother's womb): embryological container
- *Rgyu rkyen* (cause-condition): standard Buddhist causal terminology
- *'Bras bu* (fruit): resultant organ
- *Cha gnyis* (two portions): parental contributions
- *Dkar nag 'dres pa* (white-black mixed): reference to red/white essences (*dkar dmar*)
[16446-16452] [STRUCTURE] # Door Analysis
**Analysis:** The door (*sgo*) is identified as the straight center of the eye's a-berry clarity (*mig gi a 'bras dngas ma'i dkyil drang po*).
[16449-16452] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The door of arising is the two eyes themselves / arising for objects of sense powers / all this appears from the channel."
[16453-16460] [STRUCTURE] # Simile Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa introduces the hook (*lcags kyu*) simile:
- Object-appearance holding is like a hook
- The seizing hold acts like a hook
- Just as whatever appears is held by the nose [of the hook]
- This holds the two nostrils of samsara and nirvana
[16453-16460] [PHILOLOGY] The comparative structure *lta bu* (like) establishes the simile. The instrumental *yis* indicates agency: "by means of the hook."
[16461-16469] [STRUCTURE] # Measure Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes three measures (*tshad gsum*):
1. **'Byung ba 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags kyi tshad** — Element-gathered far-casting snare measure: object-appearance expanding and gathering complete
2. **Ye shes kyi tshad** — Pristine awareness measure: seeing the necklace
3. **Dngas ma 'dus pa'i tshad** — Essence-gathered measure: distinguishing particular form-appearances
[16465-16469] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The lamp that makes appearances / objects form-appearances, and awareness / the measure of necklace-appearance / thus."
[16470-16482] [STRUCTURE] # Transition to Second Lamp
**Analysis:** Longchenpa transitions to the Lamp of Empty Bindus (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) with a twelvefold schema:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*)
2. Definition (*nges tshig*)
3. Classification (*dbye ba*)
4. Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*)
5. Location (*gnas*)
6. Door (*sgo*)
7. Nature (*rang bzhin*)
8. Object-appearance (*yul snang*)
9. Measure (*tshad*)
10. Actual lamp (*sgron ma dngos*)
11. Method of practice (*de nyams su len thabs*)
12. Simile (*mthun dpe*)
The twelvefold structure exceeds the ninefold of the first lamp, indicating increasing complexity in the exposition.
[16483-16485] [CONCEPT] Essence of Empty Bindu Lamp:
- Self-clear color clarity
- Surrounded by round rim of five lights
- The bindu is empty yet possesses light (*thig le stong pa*)
[16485] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* begins the exposition of the second lamp.
[16486-16502] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Blazing Lamp Tantra*):
The extended verse establishes the philosophical basis of the Empty Bindu Lamp. The particle *ni* (16486) functions as emphatic topic marker: "As for the Empty Bindu Lamp..."
[16486-16502] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of tantric terminology:
- *Yid ches sa* (mind-trust place): basis for confidence
- *Thig le'i sku* (bindu body): the form dimension of the bindu
- *Longs spyod* (enjoyment): sambhogakāya terminology adapted for bindu
- *Goms pa* (familiarization): the practice of repeated engagement
- *Nyag gcig* (singular unique): sole, without duality
- *Cha phra* (subtle part): fine, minute aspect
- *Spros dang bral* (free of elaboration): *niṣprapañca*
- *Mu bral* (free of extremes): *madhyama*, middle way
- *Rang gsal* (self-luminous): *svayaṃprakāśa*
- *Mnyam pa nyid* (equality): *samatā*
- *Mi rtog* (non-conceptual): *nirvikalpa*
- *Ma bskur* (not imparted): without transmission from another
- *Rang dbang* (self-power): autonomous capacity
- *Ye nas gdangs* (primordially resounds): timeless manifestation
- *Ka dag* (primordially pure): *ādikalyāṇa*
- *Bdag 'ching* (self-binding): reflexive bondage
- *Ngo bos stong* (empty of essence): *svabhāvaśūnya*
[16503-16527] [STRUCTURE] # Definition Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa provides etymological analysis (*nges tshig*) of the three components:
**Thig (Bindu):**
- Self-abiding round light (*rang gnas 'od zlum*)
- Unchanging (*mi 'gyur*)
**Le:**
- Pervades objects widely (*yul la khyab par gdal*)
**Stong pa (Empty):**
- Cannot identify things (*dngos po ngos gzung du med*)
- Five self-lights blaze — thus "lamp"
[16508-16527] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The verse provides the tantric basis for the etymology:
- Bindu is unchanging, straight
- Free of primordial fabrication
- Le is great wide expansion
- All appearances complete in their own place
- Emptiness is thing-holding
- Minds attached to objects cease
- Great emptiness nature
- Self-attachment mind does not appear clearly
- Lamp makes five lights appear
- With clear recognition of self-face
- These are the definitive words
[16521-16527] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*):
The peacock simile illustrates the bindu-emptiness relationship:
- Like the peacock's essence
- Bindu has no change
- Le pervades and appears to objects
- Emptiness has no thing-marks
- Lamp becomes appearing darkness
[16528-16537] [STRUCTURE] # Fivefold Classification
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes five types of bindus (*dbye ba rnam pa lnga*):
1. **Gnas pa gzhi'i thig le** — Abiding ground bindu
- Heart (*snying ga*), wisdom hero-bullet (*ye shes kyi dpa' be'u*)
- Dividing line (*gyes mdo*) of samsara-nirvana
- Source (*'byung gnas*)
- Abides at exhaustion (*zad sar gnas*)
2. **Lus gnas rtsa'i thig le** — Body-abiding channel bindu
- Like special great channel
- Self-luminous
- Abides as bliss-pain self-liberated, primordially liberated
3. **Kun rdzob rgyu'i thig le** — Conventional cause bindu
- In roma (*ro ma*), etc.
- Merely holds body constituents (*zungs*)
- As holding agent
4. **Don dam spros pa med pa'i thig le** — Ultimate elaboration-free bindu
- Awareness primordially pure from ka
- Abides in space-awareness exhaustion intention
5. **Rang byung 'bras bu'i thig le** — Self-arisen fruit bindu
- Appears manifest to sense powers
- Day and night mix into light-clarity
- Engages in great complete liberation of buddha intention
[16530-16534] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *Dpa' be'u* (hero-bullet): tantric anatomical term for energetic center
- *Gyes mdo* (dividing line): boundary marker
- *Zad sa* (exhaustion place): point of complete emptying
- *Roma* (roma): left energetic channel
- *Zungs* (constituents): bodily essences
- *'Dzin byed* (holding agent): functional capacity
[16535-16537] [PHILOLOGY] The term *don dam* (ultimate) with *spros pa med pa* (without elaboration) indicates the *niṣprapañca* nature of the fourth bindu type.
[16538-16542] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *rig pa ka nas dag pas*:
The phrase indicates primordial purity (*ka dag*) as the starting point (*ka nas*) of awareness. The locative *la* following *dgongs pa* situates the bindu "in the intention of space-awareness exhaustion."
[16540-16541] [CONCEPT] The fifth bindu (*rang byung 'bras bu'i thig le*) appears in immediate manifest perception (*dbang po'i mngon sum*) and represents the "mixing" (*'dres*) of day-night dualities into non-dual light-clarity. This "mixing" is not a blending of substances but a recognition of inseparability.
[16542-16560] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Blazing Lamp Tantra*):
The verse enumerates the five bindus in metric form:
- Division itself is of five aspects
- Through the bindu of base-abiding self-awareness: samsara-existence gathered as one
- Through channel-body bindu: bliss and suffering gathered as one
- Through conventional cause bindu: aggregates-consciousness producing cause-conditions; aggregates-elements gathered as one
- Through ultimate elaboration-free bindu: space and awareness gathered as one
- Through self-arisen fruit bindu: all buddhas' intentions gathered into effort-accomplishment-free space
Through that division, from unchangeable empty bindu, five aspects of appearance-aspects of objects are clear in the location of gathering as one.
[16542-16560] [PHILOLOGY] The repetitive structure *thig le yis* (through the bindu) creates anaphoric emphasis on the instrumental function of each bindu type. The verb *bzlums* (gathered as one) implies non-dual integration.
[16561-16572] [STRUCTURE] # Characteristics Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa explains that emptiness free of moon-phases (*zla dang bral ba'i stong pa*) — referring to the waxing and waning of conceptual elaboration — when arising as the object of sense powers, abides in the meditation of river-flow without meditation (*ma bsgoms chu bo rgyun gyi bsam gtan*).
[16563-16572] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"Self-characteristic empty of essence / whatever manifest attachment ceases / self-called unchanging thought-free pure / non-meditated and without gap / bindu free of moon-phases itself / in self-abiding great intention / divisions actions flow abiding in rock-middle / characteristic emptiness clear pervades."
[16565] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *mngon par zhen pa* (manifest attachment) employs *mngon par* as intensifier, indicating explicit, overt grasping.
[16573-16599] [STRUCTURE] # Location Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa identifies four special great channels (*khyad par chen po'i rtsa bzhi*):
1. **Ka ti gser gyi rtsa chen** — Ka-ti gold great channel
- Good ground bindu (*gzhi'i thig le bzang po*) abides self-arisen
2. **Dar dkar snal ma lta bu** — Like white silk filament
- Good path bindu (*lam gyi thig le bzang po*) entering the lamp
- Fine, coiled (*phra la 'khril*)
- Good peak bindu (*bzang po rtse mo'i thig le*) self-arising clearly
3. **Shel sbug can** — Crystal cavity
- Good ornament-possessing bindu (*bzang po'i rgyan dang ldan pa'i thig le*) appears as light-clarity
[16575-16580] [PHILOLOGY] Anatomical terminology:
- *Ka ti* (ka-ti): tantric name for central energetic channel
- *Gser gyi rtsa* (gold channel): synonym for central channel
- *Dar dkar* (white silk): fine, pure channel quality
- *Snal ma* (filament): thread-like energetic pathway
- *Shel sbug* (crystal cavity): clear, transparent energetic center
- *'Khril* (coiled): spiral configuration
[16581-16599] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The verse establishes the four channels as locations:
- Sentient beings' body center
- From citta jewel palace
- Although channels are thousands in number
- From four special great channels
- Ka-ti gold great channel
- Like white silk filament
- Fine coiled and crystal cavity
- Inside these four, especially
- Abiding and riding the horse of wind
- Arising, entering, self-arising
- As self-nature of appearance
- Although primordially without elaboration
- Base bindu good and path bindu likewise good
- Good peaks and good ornaments
- Abide inside channels
[16590] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *rlung gi rta la zhon* (riding the horse of wind) is a standard Dzogchen metaphor for the movement of subtle energy (*rlung*) that carries awareness.
[16591] [CONCEPT] The threefold movement (*'byung dang 'jug dang rang shar*): arising (emanation), entering (withdrawal), and self-arising (spontaneous manifestation) correspond to the triad of *thod rgal* visionary processes.
[16600] [STRUCTURE] # Door Analysis
**Analysis:** Transition marker indicating the next topic: the door (*sgo*) of the Empty Bindu Lamp.
[16601-16609] [STRUCTURE] # Door Analysis (Continued)
**Analysis:** Longchenpa identifies the door (*sgo*) as arising from the center of the eye's clarity (*mig gi dngas ma'i dkyil las*). Generally, all four lamps appear; particularly, the Empty Bindu Lamp with self-light appears.
[16601-16609] [CONTEXT] Citation from the tantra:
"Sentient beings' eye not obscured by conditions / from the door called cakṣu / like the sun mandala / as self-light and rays / completely appearing as self-parts."
[16604-16605] [PHILOLOGY] The Sanskrit term *cakṣu* (eye) appears in Tibetan transliteration (*tsak+Shu*), indicating direct tantric transmission. The phrase *rkyen gyis ma bsgribs* (not obscured by conditions) establishes the unimpeded nature of primordial perception.
[16610-16618] [CONCEPT] Distribution of Lamps in the Eyes:
- Generally (*spyir*): from right eye — Far-Casting and Wisdom two
- From left eye — Bindu and Sphere two
- Brahma-aperture: awareness body in the manner of blazing lamp
This establishes a bilateral physiological correspondence with the four lamps.
[16613-16618] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*):
"The path of beings / is the door of the seer / that itself right two left two center / abides in the manner of blazing lamp."
[16619-16638] [STRUCTURE] # Nature Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa explains the nature (*rang bzhin*) of the Empty Bindu Lamp:
- Arises as empty bindu of spontaneous light-luminosity from first primordially pure nature
- Like water-moon (*chu zla*): reflective but without substantiality
[16621-16624] [CONTEXT] Citation from *dbang rnam par phye ba* (*Distinguishing Empowerment*):
"Ignorance darkness dispelling empty bindu / wonderful great appearance to objects of sense powers."
[16625-16638] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"From emptiness self-returning / in the appearance of clear experience / together with five primordial resounds / abiding through nature's flow / to the essence of clear agents / reverse-enter from things / not in emptiness / in the first of self-luminous knowing / as primordial self-characteristic / from first great primordial purity / nature itself is like this / by no one made, self-luminous / primordially itself is nature."
[16625-16638] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *Rang log* (self-returning): reflexive turning-back
- *Myong byed* (experience agent): cognitive function
- *Ye gdangs* (primordial resound): timeless vibration
- *Rang bzhin babs* (nature's flow): spontaneous descent/flow
- *Gsar byed* (clear agent): illuminating function
- *Log par zhugs* (reverse-enter): entering against the stream
- *Rang gsal shes pa* (self-luminous knowing): reflexive awareness
[16639-16646] [STRUCTURE] # Manner of Abiding from the Beginning
**Analysis:** Longchenpa distinguishes:
- Ground-time (*gzhi ka dag gi dus*): Four lamps exist in subtle inner clarity as spontaneous parts
- Ground-appearance arising (*gzhi snang du shar dus*): appearances arise as:
- Five light rays of sphere
- Body-parts in each bindu's light-house
- Far-Casting as self-luminous light-ray connecting-cord
- Wisdom arising as awareness — liberation-delusion merely as recognition/non-recognition
[16646] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *lus la gnas dus* (time of abiding in the body) serves as transitional marker to the next section.
[16647-16655] [STRUCTURE] # Body Abiding Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa describes the subtle physiology of bindu manifestation:
- From inside heart to eye: light-root makes path to appearance
- This bindu: in heart as five-light palace, round rim of five, abiding self-essence
- Distant-noose in lamp clearly
- Between-essence (*bar gdangs*) in sky: five-light round gather, slight trembling
- Lamp itself outwardly appearing: from that expanding self-essence immeasurable arise
- From heart-center inner bindu included: actual lamp, clear lamp
- Abiding at the door of non-abiding in the gatherer
- Like bird flocks: nature clear
[16647-16655] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *Snying nang* (inside heart): subtle anatomical location
- *'Od rtsa* (light-root): energetic basis for luminosity
- *'Od lnga'i pho brang* (five-light palace): visionary structure
- *Mu khyud lnga* (five rims): boundary markers
- *Rang gdangs* (self-essence): intrinsic luminosity
- *Bar gdangs* (between-essence): intermediate manifestation
- *'Gul phrig* (trembling): subtle movement
- *Shas chung* (small portion): minute degree
[16653] [CONCEPT] The paradox "abiding at the door of non-abiding" (*tshang na mi gnas sgor gnas pa*) reflects the Dzogchen principle that true abiding is non-abiding — the bindu manifests precisely at the point where fixation is released.
[16656-16664] [STRUCTURE] # Object-Appearance Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa addresses the question: To what object does [the bindu] appear?
- Appears as self-essence light with pure intermediate-space
- Citation from tantra: "Intermediate-space itself is emptiness / appearance not ceasing self-face / self-arisen great bindu abides / unexpressable self-abide essence / primordially appears in sky element."
[16659-16664] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *bar snang nyid ni stong pa la* (intermediate-space itself is to emptiness) employs the emphatic *nyid* to stress identity: intermediate-space IS emptiness, not merely like or related to it.
[16665-16673] [STRUCTURE] # Measure Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa defines the measure (*tshad*) of actual lamp:
- Space-awareness appearing without day-night
- Through this: liberation measure of samsara into nirvana
[16667-16673] [CONTEXT] Citation from tantra:
"Without bindu emanating and gathering / in intermediate-space itself who holds / becomes that measure / appears as sign of effort-free liberation / for effort-possessing, effort measure."
[16668-16673] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *spro dang bsdu med par* (without emanating and gathering) negates the dualistic process of projection and withdrawal, indicating non-dual luminosity.
[16674-16683] [STRUCTURE] # Actual Lamp Face-Grasping
**Analysis:** Longchenpa describes the direct recognition (*ngo gzung*) of the actual lamp:
Bindu surrounded by round rim of five lights, possessing appearances of each of the six races:
1. **Gods (*lha*)**: Self hand-span, white, very large
2. **Demigods (*lha min*)**: Self hand, green
3. **Humans (*mi*)**: Self thumb-span, red-clear
4. **Animals (*byol song*)**: Not capable of outward viewing, naturally blue exists
5. **Hungry ghosts (*yi dwags*)**: Not outward, yellow
6. **Hells (*dmyal ba*)**: Not outwardly appearing, naturally five-colored
Bad destinies (*ngan song*) — due to small virtue portion, not outwardly appearing; inside, only a small portion exists self-complete.
[16676-16683] [PHILOLOGY] The possessive *la* indicates the "size" appropriate to each realm: gods have large bindus (hand-span), humans have smaller (thumb-span), lower realms have only internal/natural presence without outward manifestation.
[16684-16692] [CONTEXT] Citation from *thal 'gyur* (*Result-Come* tantra):
"To all buddhas and sentient beings / pervaded by non-different, natureless / that and buddhas completely pure complete / abide free of stainless dust / from the appearance-aspect of six-race sentient beings / abide in each continuum / gods are self-clear complete / to demigods fine and flickering."
[16684-16692] [CONCEPT] The citation establishes the universal presence of the bindu across all six realms, with variations in clarity based on karmic condition. This reflects the Dzogchen view that *thod rgal* vision is potential for all beings, though manifest realization depends upon karmic readiness.
[16693-16716] [CONTEXT] Continuation of *thal 'gyur* and *sgron ma 'bar ba* citations:
The verses complete the six-realm typology of bindu manifestation:
- Humans: self-luminous round itself
- Animals: inwardly luminous
- Pretas: subtle
- Hells: self-appearance complete
[16698-16716] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The bindu of five-light gathering / to gods self-high extent / round self-luminous great exists / demigods self-hand extent / humans self-thumb extent / round without leak exists / to animals not outwardly appearing / to pretas self-face subtle exists / to hells self-luminous mere / to gods white greatly appears / demigods likewise green great / to humans red-luminous self-attachment free / animals sun-blue great portion / pretas yellow likewise / to hells five colors / abiding in the part of self-luminous awareness / actual lamp is likewise."
[16706-16716] [PHILOLOGY] Color symbolism:
- White: gods (clarity, purity)
- Green: demigods (energy, strife)
- Red: humans (passion, intensity)
- Blue: animals (instinct, darkness)
- Yellow: pretas (hunger, earth)
- Five colors: hells (confusion, totality)
[16717-16741] [STRUCTURE] # Practice Method Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa provides the eleventh topic: method of practice (*de nyams su blang thabs*):
- At place without aperture, slowly press with thumb and finger
- Many lamps, lights, and bindus appear
- Release effort and look to the extent of the appearance-gap
- Practice thus: night appears as light-clarity
- Appearance-darkness mixing is liberation into samsara-nirvana
- Without red color, self-luminous five-possessing: method of effort-free taking
[16717-16741] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *Bu ga med pa'i gnas* (place without aperture): sealed point
- *Mtheb mdzub* (thumb and finger): manual positioning
- *Dal bus mnan* (slowly press): gradual application
- *Rtsol ba btang* (release effort): non-doing
- *Ya mal* (gap): intermediate space
- *Lnga ldan* (five-possessing): having five aspects
- *Len lugs* (taking manner): method of engagement
[16717-16741] [CONCEPT] The method distinguishes:
- Effort-free (*rtsol med*): direct recognition without manipulation
- Effort-possessing (*rtsol bcas*): provisional technique for those needing structure
The warning about red color (*kha dog dmar po med par*) indicates the pure luminosity beyond passionate attachment.
[16722-16741] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"With self-thumb and finger / pressing cakṣu cavity and side / first appearing through mind-trust / through familiarized essential point / without red portion, five-possessing / becomes sky-appearing person / by this obtains awareness self-power / that is effort-free self-liberation / effort-possessor also thus / self-nape outer power / fierce vibrating and leaping / with finger and finger press again / eye posture skillfully do / light clear until arrow-extent / hold all times of seizing that / as instruction of that method / all these become that."
[16733-16736] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *mjing pa'i phyi rol rtsal* (outer power of nape) refers to the energetic activation at the base of the skull. The verb *'phrig* (vibrate) and *'phar* (leap) describe the spontaneous energetic movement.
[16737] [PHILOLOGY] The measurement *mda' gang* (arrow-extent) is a standard Tibetan measure of distance (approximately 150-200 meters), here indicating the projected range of visionary light.
[16742] [PHILOLOGY] The transitional phrase *rtse chung gi nang du* (inside the small tip) indicates the beginning of the next topic: the subtle channels within the bindu structure.
[16742] [STRUCTURE] # Channel Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa describes the internal structure:
- Inside the small tip: two channels, elements, clarity descending
- Channel-blood clarity mixed with essence
This establishes the physiological basis for the visionary experience.
---
**Summary:** These ten pages (391-400) contain Longchenpa's detailed exposition of the first two of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) in the *thod rgal* context. The Water Lamp (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*) and Empty Bindu Lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) receive systematic treatment following a structural schema that moves from essence to practice method. The exposition interweaves scriptural citations (*sgron ma 'bar ba*, *mu tig 'phreng ba*, *thal 'gyur*), anatomical detail (*ka ti* channel, *a 'bras* structure), and technical terminology characteristic of the *sNying thig* tradition. Longchenpa's method demonstrates the encyclopedic (*mdzod*) genre's commitment to comprehensive classification while maintaining the Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition beyond effort.
[16743-16756] [STRUCTURE] # Completion of the Twelve Similes Section
**Analysis:** Longchenpa completes the twelfth topic (*mthun dpe*) of the second lamp's eleven-fold analysis. The section employs a quadripartite simile structure comparing bindu (*thig le*) manifestations to:
1. Peacock tail (*rma bya'i mdongs*) - round self-resounding
2. Vulture eye (*pha khra'i mig*) - clarity portion and resound portion
3. Fish eye (*nya'i mig*) - luminous appearance and bindu particles
4. Thief's eye (*rkun mo'i mig*) - sparkle radiance and light rays
The citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (lines 16751-16755) authenticates these similes as standard Nyingthig technical vocabulary rather than literary ornamentation.
[16757-16797] [STRUCTURE] # The Third Lamp: dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma
**Analysis:** Longchenpa inaugurates the third of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*): The Lamp of the Completely Pure Sphere. The structural schema follows the established eleven-topic format:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. rang bzhin (nature)
5. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
6. goms tshul (familiarization manner)
7. tshad (measure)
8. gnas (abode)
9. sgo (door)
10. dngos (actual)
11. mthun dpe (simile)
This architectural consistency reflects the *mdzod* genre's encyclopedic imperative toward systematic classification.
[16770-16773] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *mthing ga* (blue): The base color (*khya ba chen po*) from which the five colors spread (*lnga ldan du mched*)
- *mu khyud* (rim): The circular perimeter of light
- *pad 'dab* (petals): Lotus-petal structures within the bindu
- *za 'og ber khyim* (house under a barrel): Technical simile for the enclosed, stable nature of this lamp's appearance
- *lu gu rgyud* (snake noose): The channel structure (*ra ba*) from which awareness shoots rays (*gzer 'debs*)
[16774-16783] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The text quotes: "The lamps of completely-pure nature and sphere gather the essence of awareness / appear at the snake-noose fence / for one familiarized with this, that meaning itself / blue unchanging self-luminous / abides at the rim's fence / self-luminous appears as outer object / essence itself is unfabricated."
This establishes the third lamp as integrative—gathering (*sdud*) the scattered elements into the *lu gu rgyud* structure while maintaining the *ka dag* (primordial purity) character.
[16784-16797] [CONCEPT] The visionary phenomenology:
The lamp manifests through progressive stages:
1. Initial gaze (*dang po*) to treasury-brow space (*mdzod spu'i thad*): sky-blue pervading light appears
2. Five colors emerge from within (*nang nas kha dog lnga 'char*)
3. Appear at eye corners (*mig zur gnyis*) like rainbow error (*'ja' ma nor*)
The citation from *mu tig phreng ba* (lines 16787-16796) provides scriptural authority: "Like sky-rainbow / pure afflictions stain exhausted / sphere vast expanse uncut / reality object completely-pure / from both objects arises / pervade great blue unchanging / appearance pure condition meet / becomes five colors."

**Summary:** Page 401 transitions from the second lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) to the third lamp (*dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*), completing the twelve similes and initiating the eleven-topic structural analysis of the sphere lamp. The progression moves from bindu particle phenomenology to the expansive sphere (*dbyings*) as integrating ground.
[16798-16805] [PHILOLOGY] Etymological analysis of *dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*:
- *dbyings* (sphere/expanse): From *rig pa'i rang yul* (awareness's own object) and *snang ba'i 'char gzhi* (appearance's arising basis)
- *rnam par dag pa* (completely pure): Absence of stains (*dri ma med pa*) in appearing objects (*yul du snang ba*)
- *sgron ma* (lamp): From *lu gu rgyud go rar bzung nas snang rig gsal bar byed pa* (grasping at the snake-noose fence, making appearance-awareness clear)
The definition emphasizes the lamp's dual function: establishing the sphere as both the basis of awareness and the ground of appearance.
[16801-16817] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The sphere makes awareness's own object / Vajra itself is the snake-noose / This itself enters within / Self-essence free of conceptualization / Also at the inner sphere's fence / Not grasped, not abiding, by this manner / Without separation continuously appears / To appearing objects / Purity exhausts stain numbers / Lamp's vajra snake-noose / Sky itself is focused / Without nature causes appearance / Mind holds that meaning / Therefore is definition of nature / From primordial time abides without gathering-separation."
This verse establishes the ungraspable (*ma bzung*) yet continuously appearing (*rgyun du snang*) character of the sphere lamp.
[16818-16835] [CONCEPT] Threefold classification (*dbye ba*) of the sphere lamp:
1. *gzhi la gnas pa'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Ground-abiding sphere lamp): Wisdom and light body spontaneously arising within the cit
2. *lam la snang ba'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Path-appearance sphere lamp): Five-rim fence gathering the bindu's clarity at the lotus-petal bindu
3. 'bras bu yul la snang ba'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma (Fruition-object sphere lamp): Snake-noose holding with five-color net, half-net, under-barrel, etc.
This triad maps the same lamp across ground-path-fruition (*gzhi lam 'bras bu*) structure characteristic of Dzogchen presentation.
[16836-16849] [CONCEPT] The nature (*rang bzhin*) as nonduality:
The nature is identified as the nonduality of primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*). The citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (lines 16838-16849) describes:
- Nature appearance not ceasing
- Mind-entity and memory all exhausted
- Appearance self-pure in sphere
- Awareness without conceptualization
- Unmoving equal cognition
- All exhausted in the sphere
- Primordial conceptualization exhausted
- Nature completely-pure abides in sphere
- Expressing-appearance word-mind nondual
- Without outer-inner in sphere
- Abides in great ease
[16850-16862] [CONCEPT] Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*) analysis:
The characteristic is defined as the equal purity (*zang ma*) of:
- Outer light sphere empty-luminous (*phyi 'od kyi dbyings stong gsal zang ma*)
- Self-awareness sphere primordially pure (*rang rig pa'i dbyings ka dag zang mar*)
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (lines 16854-16862) establishes this through the metaphor of unfabricated primordial purity (*ye nas ka dag chen por*).
[16863-16897] [STRUCTURE] # Familiarization Method Section
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the sixth topic (*goms tshul*): the method of familiarization. The procedure involves:
1. Separating samsara-nirvana boundary (*'khor 'das ru shan phye*)
2. Placing body-speech in natural state (*lus ngag rnal du phab*)
3. Introducing awareness in the sphere's fence directly (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcu*)
4. Continuous practice day-night (*nyin mtshan med par*)
Progressive stages of appearance:
- First: merely mirror-like light (*od me long tsam*)
- Then: portions (*dum bu*)
- Then: land-area extent (*yul gru tsam*)
- Then: sky-filling (*nam mkha' gang ba*)
- Finally: whatever appears arises as sphere's appearance, seeing kayas until exhaustion of appearances
Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (16872-16883) and *rang shar* (16884-16897) authenticate this progressive visionary unfolding.
---
**Summary:** Page 402 provides the definition, threefold classification, nature, characteristic, and familiarization method of the third lamp. The structural analysis reveals how Longchenpa maps the visionary experience through progressive stages from mirror-light to sky-filling appearances.
[16898-16949] [STRUCTURE] # Measure, Abode, and Door of the Third Lamp
**Analysis:** Longchenpa continues the eleven-topic analysis with:
- Seventh topic: Measure (*tshad*)
- Eighth topic: Abode (*gnas*)
- Ninth topic: Door (*sgo*)
**Measure (16898-16902):** Through practice, from nose-tip to eyebrow-midpoint space, blue spreading five-color under-barrel appearances, mirror-like, portions, vision-pervading inner kaya arising—this is the measure.
[16902-16949] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *gsang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*:
The citation (lines 16903-16949) provides detailed measurements and correlations:
- Sphere and awareness gaze: unobstructed sky gaze
- Sphere's inside snake-noose placed, not separated
- Who sees thus equals Samantabhadra
- Bindu seen, gaze directed upward, appearance progresses
- Four finger-widths from upper space: separated from body
- All appearing broken-vessel-like: attain emanation excellence
- Whatever appears as seen object: likewise to masses
- Outer appearance ceased: sixteen moments
- Unripened bindu to kaya: six, ten, five—definitely longs sku
- Inner body exhausted reaching place: likewise fingers, etc.
- Here directed, elements naturally stopped
- Birth-entry distinction: all dharmas exhausted self-place
- Without grasping abides: emanation kaya
- This entering's force empowerment
- Who attains birth's self-power
- Appearance's own sound empty-sound
- Manifestly returns, appears as delusion
- Does all beings' benefit
- For awareness equal one
- Three-thousand great beings' transference
- Thus gradual and instantaneous body attainment
- All these exhausted measure liberation
- These all definite fruition
- Supreme ground great mandala attainment
This extensive citation establishes the precise correlations between visionary stages (*snang ba*) and resultant kayas (*sku*).
[16950-16982] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* and *rang shar*:
The measure is further elaborated through scriptural citation:
- Blue unchanging from appearance
- Five colors clear light
- This itself greatly clarifies
- Self front upper space
- Four finger-widths or body-height
- Transcending separation from body
- That becomes the measure
The *rang shar* citation (16960-16982) describes the arising and vision process:
- Appearance arising and self great wisdom examining
- Ye shes appearance kaya and ye shes directionless arising
- Arising manner thus:
- First: merely mirror mandala
- From that: appearance portions arise
- From that: land-area arise
- From that: sky-filling arise
- Whatever appears light mandala
- Arising, seeing form kaya time
- All kaya mandalas from self-arise, self-emanate
- Sky-filling appearances
- Seeing dharmata not ceasing
- Ye shes sky movement sign
- Nature itself appearance
- Essence itself kaya arising
- Arising that itself self is
- Buddha intent valid dharma
- True thusness thus-gone
- That shown as familiarization measure
[16983-17007] [PHILOLOGY] Abode (*gnas*) and Door (*sgo*):
- Ground's sphere: cit
- Path's sphere: *'bri gu ta* (bridge-channel)
- Fruition sphere: cloud-free sky
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (16988-17007) establishes:
- Eye without arising condition
- Abiding, self-awareness itself appears as snake-noose
- Cloud-free sky holding
- Self-knowing inner clear time
- Abides in cit's center
- Outer-projection cloud-free sky
- Eye consciousness pure
- Clarifying blazing five light rays
- Unchanging pervading manner
- Blue great self-resound abides
- This arises from eye
- Unchanging pervading manner appears
- This appearance self-pure
- Sphere and awareness union
- Primordially abides, resting meditation
- Self-arising self activity-field
---
**Summary:** Page 403 completes the measure, abode, and door topics of the third lamp. The extensive scriptural citations from *gsang ba spyod pa*, *sgron ma 'bar ba*, and *rang shar* provide authoritative correlations between visionary measurements and resultant states.
[17008-17062] [STRUCTURE] # Actual Lamp and Simile Sections
**Analysis:** Longchenpa completes the third lamp's eleven-topic analysis with:
- Tenth topic: Actual (*dngos*)
- Eleventh topic: Simile (*mthun dpe*)
[17013-17046] [CONCEPT] The Actual Lamp (*dbyings kyi sgron ma dngos*):
The lamp actually arises from both eye corners, blue pervading great light, limitless. Inside, awareness-light abides in that house. Outside, snake-noose bindu empty with that fence abides. The five lights' appearance and rim's fence—both are the actual sphere.
Four non-affirming characteristics (*gnad bzhi*):
1. Without coarse entity (*dngos po rag par med*): not established as grasped object
2. Not severed emptiness (*chad pa phyang chad*): self-luminous like rainbow
3. Unharmed by elements (*'byung ba'i gnod pas mi shigs*): not compounded samsara
4. Possessing vital point (*gnad dang ldan*): seeing and familiarizing leads to primordial buddhahood
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17024-17046) establishes these characteristics through verses on vital points, suitable persons, samsara's upper space, entry from two corners, method and wisdom nature, ignorance as one finger, day-time element condition, night-time blue face conjoining, sphere's nature light house, unchanging great self-resound, buddhas and beings all, none made by anyone, primordially nondual equal abiding, from subtle abides, self-cognition arises, manifestly that greatly secret, great secret this itself, who wishes to practice, buddhahood even in primordial buddhahood.
[17047-17062] [CONCEPT] The Simile: Na-ro bird letter (*yi ge na ro*):
The simile compares the sphere lamp to the Tibetan letter na-ro (ནྲོ): two wings gathered as one bird-form. Similarly, outer blue sphere and appearance arising from it gathered together are called sphere lamp as one.
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17053-17062) provides the scriptural basis:
- Example like letter na-ro
- Two grasped and gathered as one
- Black changed, able to transform
- From that familiarization confidence obtained
- Intermediate space rainbow like
- Color unmixed completely perfect
- Then also familiarization power
- Possessing that sign
- Intermediate realm likewise thus
[17063-17071] [STRUCTURE] # Fourth Lamp Introduction: shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma
**Analysis:** Longchenpa inaugurates the fourth lamp: The Lamp of Self-Arising Wisdom (*shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*). The structural schema presents eight topics:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
5. sgo (door)
6. gnas (abode)
7. tshad (measure)
8. mthun dpe (simile)
This reduced topic count (eight vs. eleven) indicates a shift toward the most subtle and self-recognized dimension of the four lamps.
[17072-17087] [CONCEPT] Essence of Self-Arising Wisdom:
The essence is all lamps' object-knower, intent dharmata empty-luminous self-abiding, knowing with power. Through method-distance water lamp, bindu, sphere three unmoving gazing: inside self-awareness clarity-emptiness half-pure self-abiding, expanse rolling knowing with awareness.
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17079-17087) establishes:
- Self-arising wisdom lamp thus
- All lamps' object-knower abiding
- All's parts this itself
- Discriminating wisdom itself
- Abiding without discriminating manner
- Subtle part arising essence
- Primordially thus abiding
---
**Summary:** Page 404 completes the third lamp with the actual lamp description and na-ro simile, then inaugurates the fourth lamp with its essence definition. The progression moves from spatial-expansive sphere to self-recognized wisdom as the culmination of the four-lamp system.
[17088-17122] [PHILOLOGY] Etymological analysis of *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*:
- *shes rab* (wisdom/prajñā): From *nang du rang gnas lhun grub kyi dgongs pa shes dus* (when knowing the self-abiding spontaneous intent within)
- *rang byung* (self-arising): Not found by seeking, obtained from self; arising without cessation; wisdom knows dharmas clearly
- *rab* (supreme): Intent difficult to realize by others, obtained from self without searching, supreme peak
- *rang* (self): Jewel existing primordially in self found
- *byung* (arisen): Self-arisen without cessation
- *sgron ma* (lamp): Dharmas clearly known
- *ma* (mother/suffix): Self-appearance self-face known, pervading knowing
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17098-17115) provides extensive analysis:
- Knowing entity and non-entity
- All appearance greatly entered
- General meaning knowing
- Unsought placed confidence obtained
- Self ye shes measures known
- Nature pure dharmakaya
- Unobtained by three, self-known
- Superior appearing greatly
- Others' analysis place nonexistent
- Self-arisen primordially pure object
- Not others' object, called self
- Without doing, this meaning not obtained
- Without hope for anyone
- Primordially self-arisen called arisen
- Lamp dharmata all
- Nondual appearance makes
- Ma: self-face pervading knowing
[17116-17122] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig phreng ba*:
"Example like butter-lamp / Knowing all dharmas instantaneously / Supreme becomes all's peak / Self other-dependency dharma free / Arisen unblocked freely appears."
This establishes the butter-lamp (*sgron me*) simile for wisdom's illuminating function.
[17123-17157] [CONCEPT] Fivefold classification (*dbye ba*) of Self-Arising Wisdom:
1. *gzhi gnas rang byung gi shes rab* (Ground-abiding self-arising wisdom): Rigpa's knowing aspect, arising basis and support
2. *snang ba cer 'dzin gyi shes rab* (Appearance-directly-holding wisdom): Sphere-awareness nondual union, self-time self-clear, stainless purity, intent delivers to dharmata
3. *dran pa 'gag med kyi shes rab* (Memory-unceasing wisdom): Arising marks none, yet arising, liberated self-face dharmata unified gathering
4. *so sor rtog pa'i shes rab* (Individually-discriminating wisdom): Dharma and dharma-possessor, self and general marks, characteristics, etc., unmixed appearance knowing
5. *'jug byed rnam gsum gyi shes rab* (Three-entrance wisdom): In natural bardo, hearing establishes, thinking decides, meditation tastes experience, definitely extracts from samsara, word-meaning realized
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17140-17157) authenticates:
- Classification fivefold
- Ground-abiding self-arising wisdom makes body etc. dharmas' supports
- Appearance-holding wisdom holds sphere-awareness union
- Unceasing memory wisdom gathers one-pointed knowing objects
- Individually-discriminating wisdom discriminates general and self marks
- Three-entrance wisdom establishes in natural bardo
[17158-17163] [CONTEXT] Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*):
The characteristic is knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and dharmas gathered by object-awareness rigpa as natureless.
Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17156-17159) and *sdud pa* (17160-17163):
- Appearing and non-appearing all dharmas / natureless who knows / this is that characteristic
- Dharmas natureless transformed / this called prajñāpāramitā supreme
[17164-17178] [CONCEPT] Door of arising (*'char byed kyi sgo*):
The five faculties (*dbang po lnga*) are the door because sense-faculties measure objects as wisdom, that being the door.
Particularly, nose memory wisdom wind (*shes rab kyi rta me rlung*) moving is that itself. Fire-wind wisdom's resound like fire sparks, night-time yawn occurring, arises thus known.
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17169-17178):
- Arising door five faculties
- Particularly from nose arises
- That sign night time
- Yawn and fierce yawn
- Very fierce yawn body time
- Red resounding light rays
- Like fire sparks spreading
- That measure and sign
- Arising door recognized
---
**Summary:** Page 405 provides the definition, fivefold classification, characteristic, and door of the fourth lamp. The analysis reveals self-arising wisdom as the self-recognized knowing that integrates all prior lamps through nondual sphere-awareness union.
[17179-17213] [CONCEPT] Abode (*gnas*) of Self-Arising Wisdom:
The abode is cit's four great channels' root, rigpa's self-resound wind held, not outer-projected, inner self-abiding mere unclear, from action wind outer power moved, objects rigpa arise.
Also, abiding in name-basis gathering's self-resound:
- Element (*'byung ba*)
- Knowing (*shes pa*)
- Ye shes rigpa four's self-resound
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17187-17213):
- Arising four channels from
- Shaking, moving, vibrating
- Fire sparks upward characteristic
- Wisdom from
- Knowing clear-clear knowing
- Wisdoms' nature
- Ro ma rkyang ma all vibrating
- Crystal cave hollow inside
- Great clarifying wisdom abides
- Four names gathering self-resound
- All discriminating essence
- Primordially body's parts abides
- Occasionally wind self-held
- Knowing memoryless thick even
- Wisdom powers expand-contract
- Clear part none, thick becomes
- Self wisdom power moved time
- Previous unheard dharmas also
- Mind memory clear arises
- Clear and unclear powers
- Wind's movement itself from arises
- Body center channel inside abides
[17214-17285] [STRUCTURE] # Measure (*tshad*) of Self-Arising Wisdom
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents measures for each of the five wisdoms:
1. **Ground-abiding wisdom measure:** Abiding in equal intent's warmth measure
2. **Appearance-holding wisdom measure:** Sphere-awareness mixed, knowing and self-power obtained
3. **Unceasing memory wisdom measure:** Arising-liberation marks none, gathering-dispersal exhausted, abiding in ease spontaneous intent, conditions cannot steal rigpa
4. **Individually-discriminating wisdom measure:** Two-possessing dharmas individually divided, established
5. **Three-entrance wisdom measure:** Word-meaning realized, meaning self-face abides
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17225-17285) provides extensive measures:
- Ground-abiding self-arising measure
- All dharmas equal experience arises
- Knowing stable confidence obtained
- That itself unchanging
- Always continuum abides
- This ground-abiding wisdom finished
- This body also light
- Knowings clear

- Unceasing memory wisdom finished
- Individually-discriminating wisdom measure
- Alaya and dharmakaya also
- Thus divided sign thus
- Body attachment mind free
- Rigpa where directed abides
- Body inert like becomes
- Mind and ye shes divided
- Movers' door also ceases
- Element clear-polluted divided
- Coarse appearance self-ceases
- Snake-noose blissfully practices
- Thus samsara-nirvana divided
- Deluded knowings birth impossible
- If born benefit-harm free
- That etc. self-knowing
- Samsara-nirvana established
- Discriminating wisdom's wisdom
- Three entrances wisdom measure
- All dharmas one word spoken
- That text knowing
- Hearing wisdom measure finished
- Knowing what contemplated
- Pair continuum bliss arises
- Contemplating likewise wields
- Arisen conditions unharmed
- Deluded grasping fixation self-ceases
- This meditation wisdom obtained
---
**Summary:** Page 406 details the abode and extensive measures of self-arising wisdom. The five wisdom measures provide progressive indicators of stabilization in the lamp's recognition.
[17286-17302] [CONCEPT] Simile (*mthun dpe*) and Section Completion:
The simile is like tinder (*spra ba*)—whatever object is seen is known and realized, all afflictions burned. The butter-lamp fire blazes.
Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17290-17295) and *sdud pa* (17296-17299):
- Example like tinder moisture-free
- Fire sparks subtle even meet
- Tinder all blaze fire burning
- Wisdom burns latencies
- These all wisdom lamp
- Wisdom dharmas' nature completely knowing
- Three realms mother-free truly transcends
[17300-17306] [STRUCTURE] # Major Rim Khang: Four Lamps Classification
**Analysis:** Longchenpa concludes the thirteenth major section (*rim khang bcu gsum pa*): The Classification of the Four Lamps. The text marks this as the conclusion (*ste*) of the four-lamps presentation and prepares to transition to the second major division: establishing the nature of knowing supported by that body.
The transition formula (*de ltar...de ni*) marks the structural shift from supporting base (*rten*) to supported cognition (*brten pa shes pa*).
[17303-17306] [STRUCTURE] # Second Major Division: Supported Cognition
**Analysis:** The three topics of establishing the nature of knowing supported by that body:
1. Alaya (*kun gzhi*) and dharmakaya (*chos sku*) distinction
2. Mind (*sems*) and wisdom (*ye shes*) distinction
3. Distinct dharmas analysis
[17307-17313] [CONCEPT] First Topic: Alaya-Dharmakaya Distinction
Brief presentation (*mdor bstan pa*):
- Sentient beings' basis and buddhas' basis considered: rigpa's essence ka dag stainless
- Stained with marigpa (*ma rig pa*), conceptualization (*rtog tshogs*)—becomes all delusion-appearance, delusion-holder's basis
- Thus alaya and dharmakaya two aspects
The *thal 'gyur* citation (17315-17316): "Alaya and dharmakaya's vital point."
[17317-17334] [CONCEPT] Alaya (*kun gzhi*) defined:
- Made distinct by ignorance (*ma rig pas khyad par du byas pa*)
- Mind and mental factors' first support, middle abode, final home
- Latencies' vessel, like a pond (*rdzing*)
Dharmakaya (*chos sku*) defined:
- Made distinct by ignorance reversed (*ma rig pa log pas*)
- Beyond mind and mental factors' objects
- Pure from all action and latencies
Alaya:
- Under-barrel spread basis of various appearances
- Various objects appear in lung
- Object-possessors, six ignorance, three realms essence appear
- That body, happiness-suffering, mind's delusion parts many held
Dharmakaya:
- All these nonexistent
- Not abiding together with mind etc.
The *rang shar* citation (17335-17339):
- Alaya conceptualization holder
- Various delusion knowing stained
- Alaya ignorance entity is
- Alaya called that
And (17341-17343):
- Sentient being basis and buddha basis
- One distinction divided certainly
[17344-17360] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig phreng ba*:
- Alaya accumulation's cause
- Dharmakaya outflow exhausted
- Empty clear and clear pervading
- Contemplation unstained memory-clear
- Elaboration itself free
- Sky-like pervading empty
- Self-pure all free
- Cause and condition with alaya
- Latencies etc. like pond
- Dharmakaya latencies free
- Mind and sems etc. gathering
- Embodied alaya various appears
- Dharmakaya mind etc. free
- Various form-appearance body nonexistent
[17361-17374] [CONTEXT] Citation from *kun tu bzang po klong drug pa'i rgyud*:
- Hey mahasattva
- Mind's abode is alaya
- Why? Alaya gathers all contemplation objects, known as mind
- Ye shes's abode is dharmakaya
- Why? Dharmakaya lacks all memory-conceptualization, no different-object-holding knowing
---
**Summary:** Page 407 completes the fourth lamp with its simile, concludes the four-lamps section, and inaugurates the second major division on supported cognition. The alaya-dharmakaya distinction establishes the fundamental ground for understanding samsara-nirvana differentiation.
[17375-17406] [CONTEXT] Polemical Analysis: Alaya as Dharmakaya?
**Analysis:** Longchenpa addresses the erroneous view (*'dod pa*) that identifies alaya with dharmakaya. This view has proponents among:
1. Common treatises (*thun mong gi bstan bcos*): Alaya as support of pure-impure all; dharmakaya as pure's stainless thusness
2. Some mantra practitioners (*sngags kha cig*): Alaya transformed abode becomes dharmadhatu wisdom, essence body
Scriptural citations used to support this view:
- "Alaya is all's basis / nirvana's basis mother also is"
- "Alaya transformed abode is dharmadhatu wisdom, essence body"
[17387-17406] [CONCEPT] Logical Refutation (*gnod pa*):
If alaya were dharmakaya, two absurd consequences (*thal ba*) follow:
1. Dharmakaya would be stained (*dri ma can du thal*)
2. Alaya producing container-world delusion would mean dharmakaya produces delusion
Further absurdity: If accepted, buddhas would again become sentient beings (*sangs rgyas nas slar sems can du 'khrul par thal ba*)
Scriptural refutations (*lung gis gnod*):
- *kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long*: "Considering alaya as dharmakaya is deviating from me"
- *rig pa rang shar*: "Some consider alaya as dharmakaya / To give answer, teaching established / Alaya's characteristic thus / Then that spoke answer / All complete therefore alaya / From that all complete / Buddha becoming sentient being reason / Why all complete / Intermittent possessor becomes / Why various arises / Sometimes buddha becomes / Sometimes sentient being becomes / Why definite abiding / Then asked words reversed / Then if alaya nonexistent / Then asked answer given / Alaya conceptualization holder / Various delusion knowing stained / Alaya ignorance entity is"
[17420-17447] [CONCEPT] Essential Distinction (*dbye dgos*) and Simile:
The distinction is essential. From *klong drug pa*: "Therefore alaya and dharmakaya not distinguished: like form one different-holding knowing, cannot appear objects individually."
Simile: Ocean and boat (*rgya mtsho dang gru*):
- Dharmakaya: Like pure ocean, rigpa unstained never experienced stain, sphere ocean clear, nowhere established, nowhere not arising, door not ceased, primordial field nature pure, adventitious stain separated, that sphere force-place obtained, pure twofold-possessing part
- Alaya: Like boat on ocean not dissolved, when deluded from primordial sphere, ground ignorance all's support, pervader, essence abiding boat-like, mind mental factors action latencies delusion many filled
The *rang shar* citation (17436-17439):
- Alaya and dharmakaya's example
- Ocean and boat's manner path-arisen
- Sleep and waking manner
- Faculty distinction possessing
[17440-17447] [CONCEPT] Fundamental Asymmetry:
Rigpa unstained dharmakaya's essence at all times not reversing, exists as final liberation basis. Alaya like sleep, delusion-appearance all dreams' basis became, must be awakened from—distinction extremely great.
Sleep and dream must be reversed; self-rigpa need not be reversed. Dharmakaya is basis to be recognized; familiarized in that state; fruition liberation place identified. Alaya and dependent dharmas are to be purified stains.
---
**Summary:** Page 408 presents Longchenpa's refutation of the alaya-dharmakaya identity view, using logical consequences and scriptural citations. The ocean-boat simile illustrates the fundamental asymmetry between the unstained ground and the deluded support.
[17448-17476] [STRUCTURE] # Expanded Explanation of Alaya and Dharmakaya
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation (*rgyas par bshad pa*) in two sections:
1. Alaya expanded explanation
2. Dharmakaya expanded explanation
**Alaya Structure (17451-17476):**
From *thal 'gyur*:
- Alaya and dharmakaya vital point
- Alaya briefly explained
- Dharmas and non-dharmas all's basis
- Essence word distinction with
- Essence latencies vessel
- Classification: body, connection, various, primordial basis
Fivefold analysis of alaya:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*): Compounded virtue, samsara dharmas, latencies with, vessel
2. Definition (*nges tshig*): All-pervading (*kun mang*), gathered, many's time-place or support basis abiding
3. Classification (*dbye ba*):
- *ye don gyi kun gzhi* (Primordial meaning alaya)
- *sbyor ba don gyi kun gzhi* (Connection meaning alaya)
- *bag chags lus kyi kun gzhi* (Latency body alaya)
- *bag chags sna tshogs pa'i kun gzhi* (Latency various alaya)
[17477-17493] [CONCEPT] Four Alayas Detailed:
1. **Primordial meaning alaya**: Samsara dharmas all's sphere first basis; investigating doer first movement rigpa considering, coeminent ignorance, from reversal spoken
2. **Connection meaning alaya**: That knowing itself self ignorance, samsara connection; knowing, nirvana connection aspect spoken
3. **Latency body alaya**: Root knowing itself body latencies possessing; flesh, blood, light, mind-body arising aspect spoken
4. **Latency various alaya**: That knowing itself impure action latencies source, all's basis making aspect spoken
Though four names, one knowing's aspect four distinctions turned, labeled.
[17494-17507] [CONCEPT] Alaya as Eight Consciousnesses:
From first movement until now, all knowing's support alaya, dependent aggregates eight abiding; individually distinguished, root samsara basis-opening arising basis: primordial meaning and samsara-nirvana connection; body appearing as body; mind latencies dependent alaya basis established. That time knowing's aspect outer-inner not severed, alaya consciousness labeled.
From that, five faculties' respective knowing concept-free five objects holding aspect: five sense-consciousnesses (*sgo lnga'i rnam shes*) labeled.
That time concept-investigation inward-looking realization first that met, mind knowing (*yid shes*), investigating distinguishes specifically holding, object as desired—one mind different aspects known.
Functions (*byed las*):
- Primordial delusion basis makes
- Connection body-mind linked happiness-suffering all-connection makes
- Body body and that aggregates many conditions makes
- Latencies action and afflictions maturation cause-condition makes
Names-entry reasons (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*):
- Latencies prior-later intermediate
- Action karmic result five outer connection
- Cause-result joining
- All-connection binding makes
- Therefore "kun gzhi" word entry
---
**Summary:** Page 409 provides the expanded explanation of alaya with its fivefold analysis (essence, definition, classification, function, name-entry). The four alayas map different aspects of the deluded basis across ground, connection, body, and latencies.
[17508-17547] [STRUCTURE] # Dharmakaya Expanded Explanation
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation of dharmakaya (*chos sku rgyas par bshad pa*) following the same fivefold structure:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*)
2. Definition (*nges tshig*)
3. Classification (*dbye ba*)
4. Function (*byed las*)
5. Name-entry reason (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*)
From *thal 'gyur* (17511-17522):
- Dharmakaya elaboration-free
- Self grasping marks nonexistent
- Essence empty-luminous nondual
- Classification: dharma, longs, sprul
- Three distinctions superior enters
- Definition: dharma true path
- Body from that accomplished
[17524-17547] [CONCEPT] Dharmakaya Essence and Classification:
**Essence**: Primordial ka dag great inner-clear nature spontaneous arising basis, subtle ye shes abiding; deluded time that resound placed, mind-entity elaboration-free one-taste realized, experience possessing.
From *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17528-17547):
- Abiding manner abiding-mode two
- Primordial basis abiding
- Delusion object abiding
- Primordial essence nature
- Compassion three aspects abiding
- That also essence body abiding
- Dharma longs sprul parts
- Undivided dividing-free manner
- Babs accomplished itself also
- Body color etc. mind object nonexistent
- Nature arising light manner
- White red yellow green blue
- Marks marks-possessing nonexistent
- Markless knowing babs accomplished
- Compassion arising various
- Thus one indefinite
- Various appearing therefore basis called
- Delusion object self-placed
- Resting self-liberation spread-bestowal
[17548-17602] [CONTEXT] Citations from *rang shar* and *de nyid*:
From *rang shar* (17549-17553):
- Dharmakaya ye shes great scripture
- Characteristic three aspects possessing
- Essence nature compassion three
- Dharmakaya's characteristic is
From *de nyid* (17556-17567):
- Dharmakaya's palace unchanging this
- Self cit center clearly abides
- Empty ye shes essence
- Clear light essence
- Self-arisen rigpa essence
- Three essences possessing dharmakaya
- Ye shes meaning realized path journey nonexistent
- Expression limit-free dharmakaya great this
- All abiding, all realize not
- Mind nonexistent, sems nonexistent, ignorance delusion nonexistent
[17568-17593] [CONCEPT] Ninefold Classification of Three Kayas:
Sometimes labeled ground-abiding ye shes, sometimes dharmakaya, sometimes liberation-basis—one essence different aspects spoken. Body and ye shes gathering-separation free intent known.
**Three kayas each with three subdivisions:**
**Dharmakaya (*chos sku*):**
1. Dharmakaya's dharmakaya: Rigpa itself; dharma appearing objects, body rigpa's essence unceased
2. Dharmakaya's longs sku: Five lights
3. Dharmakaya's sprul sku: Eye faculty seeing unceased
Dharmakaya's object: sky pure
Dharmakaya's abode: cit
Dharmakaya's path: jewel crystal cave possessing
**Longs sku (*longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku*):**
1. Longs sku's chos sku: Five ye shes appearance unceased clearly abiding
2. Longs sku's longs sku: Five bindus' path with
3. Longs sku's sprul sku: Five doors' knowing objects arising rigpa
Longs sku abode: *a wa dhūtī*
Longs sku path: small tip right
**Sprul sku (*sprul pa'i sku*):**
1. Sprul sku's chos sku: Two lamps
2. Sprul sku's longs sku: Seeing five lights
3. Sprul sku's sprul sku: Five afflictions arising self self-rigpa
Sprul sku abode: head
Sprul sku path: eye
Sprul sku object: delusion appearance
[17594-17643] [CONCEPT] Resolution of Apparent Contradiction:
Question: Dharmakaya without mind and afflictions; its classification longs sprul of three kayas, sprul sku's sprul sku two—five doors' knowing and afflictions called—contradiction?
Answer: No contradiction. Consciousness and afflictions' own time rigpa's self-resound possessing, that spoken; consciousness and afflictions actual sprul sku not.
---
**Summary:** Page 410 completes the expanded explanation of dharmakaya with its fivefold analysis and presents the complex ninefold classification of the three kayas (each kaya having three aspects). The resolution of the apparent contradiction between dharmakaya's purity and the three kayas' classification maintains rigpa's self-resound as the bridge.
[17636-17643] [CONCEPT] Dharmakaya Function (*byed las*):
The essence ka dag's dharmakaya makes liberation basis; path time empty-clear dharmakaya's part makes liberating action; those three kayas make purifying and purification basis action.
[17644-17650] [CONTEXT] Dharmakaya Name-Entry Reason (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*):
- Primordially dust-free and stainless
- Abiding in state possessing but not recognizing
- Secret dharma existing
- Final meaning sought-after fruition existing dharma
- Therefore dharmakaya word spoken
[17644-17711] [STRUCTURE] # Second Topic: Mind (*sems*) and Wisdom (*ye shes*) Distinction
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the second major topic in two sections:
1. Essence brief presentation
2. Respective natures expanded explanation
Brief presentation from *mu tig phreng ba* (17649-17651):
- Mind and ye shes distinction
- Scholars should know
**Mind (*sems*) defined (17652-17654):**
Root ignorance coeminent possessing, stain with, samsara dharma self-deceiving, not ye shes's sun obscured, like cloud.
**Ye shes defined (17654-17655):**
Dharmakaya coeminent possessing, stainless, mind's memory-contemplation not abiding together, like sun.
From *de nyid* (17657-17664):
- Mind latencies all's basis
- Embodied stains is
- Grasped object holder mind
- Therefore samsara's dharmata
And:
- Ye shes memory basis itself free
From *klong drug pa* (17666-17667):
- Mind and ye shes own essence not distinguished
- Like sun cloud-mass obscured
- Outer appearance's objects cannot do
[17668-17711] [CONCEPT] Mind Detailed Analysis:
Mind is all action and afflictions and latencies' basis, source, maturation-maker, all-awakener, ignorance home always abiding, ye shes's sun contradicting, obscuring.
From *rang shar* (17672-17678):
- Mind latencies all gathering
- Mind afflictions all maturing
- Mind latencies all's basis is
- That latency also difficult to exhaust
- Self appearance obscuring
- Ignorance equally abiding
From *mu tig phreng ba* (17680-17684):
- Mind gathering arising
- Stain also with obscured
- Alaya-gathering mind etc.
- Stain number became
**Threefold mind structure (17699-17702):**
Mind appearing objects "this and this" signs, names, general holders; grasped object mind. That distinction investigating finely discerning, holder subject mind—two gathered.
"Grasped object holder mind" thus explained.
Scriptural support:
- *thun mong gi gzhung*: Mind ceased, that body manifestly did
- *tshigs gsal du*: Mind and mental factors' entering also continuum ceased
- *dkon mchog brtsegs pa*: Mind, yid, consciousness also free; samadhi abode not abandoning; this thus-gone's heart's secret unimaginable
---
**Summary:** Page 411 provides dharmakaya's function and name-entry reason, then inaugurates the mind-wisdom distinction. The analysis establishes mind as the stained, deluded basis of samsara, contrasted with ye shes as the unstained sun-like dharmakaya.
[17712-17736] [CONCEPT] Ye Shes (Wisdom) Detailed Analysis:
Ye shes is sky-like elaboration-ceased, buddha dharmas measureless basis and source, dharmakaya's home always abiding, afflictions and latencies thicket all burned, fire-like abiding.
**Five characteristics (*mtshan nyid*):**
From *rang shar* (17712-17713):
- Ye shes essence sky-like
- Dharmas nature free
From *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17714-17736):
- Ye shes's clear part: essence sun unclouded from primordial time, knowing luminosity-emptiness's nature abiding
- Ye shes's empty part: nature space from primordial time free of elaboration, dharmakaya unchanging
- Ye shes's knowing part: uncompounded samsara-nirvana from primordial time pure, all-arising's basis, knowing
- Ye shes's liberated part: samsara's nature exhausted, buddhahood obtained, nirvana not sought, delusion source from primordial time pure
- Ye shes's pervading part: pervading all samsara-nirvana, knowing inexpressible, inconceivable
**Five ye shes (*ye shes lnga*) from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:**
1. Dharmadhatu wisdom (*chos dbyings ye shes*)
2. Mirror-like wisdom (*me long lta bu'i ye shes*)
3. Equality wisdom (*mnyam nyid ye shes*)
4. Discriminating wisdom (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes*)
5. All-accomplishing wisdom (*bya ba grub pa'i ye shes*)
**Four wisdoms (*ye shes bzhi*) from *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung*:**
- Dharmadhatu: knowing self-face dharmata
- Mirror-like: knowing all as reflection
- Equality: knowing samsara-nirvana equal
- Discriminating: knowing particulars without confusion
[17737-17750] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"Ye shes mirror-like like / All dharmas arising clear / Various knowings emanate / Play emanation unceased / Uncontrived spontaneous nature / Suchness time three knowledge-free / Dharmadhatu wisdom great / Samsara-nirvana equal knowing / Equality wisdom great / Particulars distinct knowing / Discriminating wisdom great / Play activities accomplish knowing / All-accomplishing wisdom great"
[17751-17782] [CONCEPT] Mind-Ye Shes Distinction Summary:
Mind (*sems*):
- Stained with ignorance, afflictions, latencies
- Samsara's basis, cause, maturation
- Deluded, grasping, conceiving
- Cloud-like, obscuring
Ye shes:
- Stainless, primordially pure
- Dharmakaya's essence
- Knowing, clear, liberated
- Sun-like, illuminating
- Five/fourfold classifications
**Fivefold classification (*dbye ba*) from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:**
1. Dharmadhatu wisdom: dharmata's sphere knowing
2. Mirror-like wisdom: all dharmas clear mirror-like
3. Equality wisdom: samsara-nirvana equal knowing
4. Discriminating wisdom: particulars distinct knowing
5. All-accomplishing wisdom: activities accomplishing
[17783-17798] [CONTEXT] Citations from *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung*:
"Mirror-like wisdom like / All dharmas arising clear / Self-face dharmata knowing / Dharmadhatu wisdom great / Samsara-nirvana equal knowing / Equality wisdom great / Particulars distinct knowing / Discriminating wisdom great / Activities accomplish knowing / All-accomplishing wisdom great"
**Three aspects (*mtshan nyid gsum*) of ye shes:**
1. Essence (*ngo bo*): knowing
2. Nature (*rang bzhin*): luminous
3. Compassion (*thugs rje*): unimpeded arising
---
**Summary:** Page 412 provides extensive analysis of ye shes with its five/fourfold classifications, characteristics, and distinctions from mind. The five ye shes structure parallels standard Buddhist phenomenology while being reinterpreted through the Dzogchen lens.
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the third major topic: analysis of distinct dharmas (*khyad par can gyi chos gshan rnam par bshad pa*). This section systematically examines various categories that distinguish the Dzogchen view.
The page begins with citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* and *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung* on the five ye shes, then transitions to distinct dharmas analysis.
From *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
- Ye shes mirror-like like
- Various emanations unceased
- Uncontrived spontaneous nature
- Time three knowledge-free
From *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung*:
- Five ye shes thus
- Dharmadhatu essence dharmata
- Mirror-like all clear
- Equality samsara-nirvana equal
- Discriminating particular distinct
- All-accomplishing activities accomplish
The distinct dharmas are presented across three stages:
1. **Ground** (*gzhi*): Primordial purity (*ka dag*), spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*), thigle, lamp aspects
2. **Path** (*lam*): Vision (*snang ba*), measure (*tshad*), familiarization (*goms*), signs (*rtags*)
3. **Fruition** ('bras bu): Dharmakaya, exhaustion (*zad pa*), liberation (*grol ba*), buddhahood (*sangs rgyas*)
- *rang byung* (self-arisen): Not made by causes-conditions, primordially existing
- *lhun grub* (spontaneously accomplished): Without effort, naturally perfect
- *cer mthong* (direct seeing): Without meditation, immediate recognition
- *gcer grol* (direct liberation): Without antidote, self-liberated
- *thod rgal* (direct transcendence): Spontaneous, leap-over progression
The text cites extensively on the spontaneously accomplished nature:
- Spontaneous accomplishment thus
- From primordial time accomplished
- Not made by anyone
- Self-abiding dharmata
- Unchanging great bliss
- Without seeking, self-obtained
The distinct dharmas culminate in the integration of the four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*):
1. *rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma* (Far-reaching water lamp)
2. *thig le stong pa'i sgron ma* (Empty bindu lamp)
3. *dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Completely pure sphere lamp)
4. *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma* (Self-arising wisdom lamp)
Each lamp has:
- Its own essence, definition, classification
- Specific measures and signs
- Integration with the three kayas
- Progressive familiarization stages
---
**Summary:** Page 413 initiates the third topic on distinct dharmas, establishing the ground-path-fruition structure and key terminology. The integration of the four lamps system provides the comprehensive framework for Dzogchen practice and realization.
