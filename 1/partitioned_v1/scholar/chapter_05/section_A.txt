[8312-8361] [STRUCTURE] Physical Characteristics of the Four Families (Rigs Bzhi)
This section initiates the completion stage (rdzogs rim) presentation of inner tantra, specifically focusing on the examination of suitable consorts (gzhung ma) for secret mantra practice. The structure follows the traditional four-fold classification of families (rigs bzhi): Padma (lotus), Dung can (conch), Ri mo can (lined/marked), and Har ti. Each family exhibits distinct physical characteristics indicating karmic affinity with specific tantric attainments.
[8312-8317] [PHILOLOGY] Color Terminology and Particle Analysis
The text employs precise chromatic terminology: ser (yellow), dmar (red), sngo (blue), and dkar (white). The particle construction "las thal drags pa ma yin par" (not extremely beyond/from) uses las as ablative particle indicating distinction from the extremes mentioned. The phrase "gtsa bo'i rigs nges par 'grub pa" employs nges par (definitely/certainly) as adverbial intensifier with 'grub pa (to be established/accomplished), establishing definitive classification through physical signs.
[8318-8341] [CONTEXT] Guhyagarbha Tantra and Family Classifications
The presentation of four families derives primarily from the Guhyagarbha Tantra (gsang ba snying po), the root text of Mahayoga. The four families correspond to the four Buddha families (rigs bzhi):
- Padma family: Amitabha, lotus characteristics
- Dung can family: Vairocana, conch/white characteristics
- Ri mo can family: Akshobhya, marked/vajra characteristics
- Har ti family: Amoghasiddhi, action/-green characteristics
The verse citation "dkar ba ma yin gnag min zhing" appears in the Thalgyur root text, establishing the non-dual coloration beyond extremes.
[8342-8361] [CONCEPT] Subtle Body Correspondences
The four families manifest physical characteristics corresponding to subtle body channels (rtsa) and elements:
- Padma: Related to ro ma (right channel), fire element
- Dung can: Related to rkyang ma (left channel), water element
- Ri mo can: Related to dbu ma (central channel), space element
- Har ti: Related to channels at heart, air element
These classifications serve not merely as descriptive categories but as indicators of internal energy configurations affecting tantric practice outcomes.

The particle "gis" appears throughout as instrumental marker: "bsten pa'i stobs kyis 'grub" (accomplished through power of reliance), establishing causal relationships between practice methods and results.
[8422-8436] [CONTEXT] Hevajra and Cakrasamvara Lineage
The mantra "om lheng lheng bsdu bsdu rdo rje sems dpa' snying la breng breng" derives from Hevajra Tantra traditions. The ritual substances listed (khyi nag po'i snying khrag - black dog heart blood, padma'i rakt - lotus blood, bong bu'i sa bon - donkey semen) follow standard Anuttarayoga tantra conventions for drawing practices (dgug pa).
[8437-8452] [CONCEPT] Five-fold Classification of Channel Characteristics
The section introduces five family channels (rigs can lnga) with length variations:
- Ring ba (long): Extended pleasure, external generation
- Thung ba (short): Brief pleasure, immediate intensity
- 'Bring po (medium): Balanced, similar to taste experience

The text employs causative verb forms:
- "Rgyas par byed" (causes to expand)
- "Sbyang bar byed" (causes to refine)
- "'Byong bar byed" (causes to release)
Particle analysis of "gis" (instrumental) and "kyis" (agentive) establishes the means-ends relationships in practice.
[8590-8614] [CONTEXT] Cakrasamvara and Vajrayogini Lineages
The practices described align with Cakrasamvara (bde mchog) and Vajrayogini (rdo rje rnal 'byor ma) traditions. The mention of "stag mo'i 'gyur stangs" (tigress posture) and "seng ge'i 'gying tshugs" (lion posture) derives from Six Yogas of Naropa traditions adapted into Nyingma completion stage.
[8615-8638] [CONCEPT] Release of Thigle and its Indicators
The section presents signs of successful thigle release:
- External: Skra dkar dang gnyer ma med pa (no grey hair/wrinkles)
- Internal: Rnam rtog nub pa (cessation of conceptual thought)
- Secret: Bde ba lhun grub (spontaneously present bliss)
The three-fold release (phyir 'byongs, nang du sems 'byongs, lus kyis sems 'chings) corresponds to three kayas realization.

3. Gsum pa bde ba (third bliss) - mind-wisdom disturbance
4. Bzhi pa myong ba (fourth experience) - non-dual integration
5. Lnga pa stong pa (fifth emptiness) - beyond extremes
[8669-8696] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal and Sequential Markers
The text employs sequential indicators:
- "De nas" (after that/then) - temporal progression
- "Dang po...gnyis pa...gsum pa" (first...second...third) - ordinal enumeration
- "De ltar" (in that manner) - methodological continuity
The particle "ni" appears as emphatic marker: "bde ba gang dang yang mi 'dra ba ni tshad yin no" (the measure is bliss unlike any other).
[8697-8723] [CONTEXT] Citation from Previous Sections
The verse "g.yo dang thob dang brtan pa ni / sku gsum po'i sa la gshegs" references earlier completion stage presentation, establishing continuity with three kayas realization as the culmination of practice.
[8724-8755] [CONCEPT] Integration of Method and Wisdom
The final section presents the integration of:
- Lus (body) with sku (kaya) through union
- Ngag (speech) with gsung (vajra speech) through mantra
- Sems (mind) with thugs (vajra mind) through wind control
This three-fold integration culminates in the recognition of the co-emergent bliss (lhan cig skyes pa'i bde ba) as the nature of mind.

**Summary:**
Pages 201-224 present a comprehensive exposition of Mahayoga and Anuyoga completion stage practices, organized according to the four families of consorts, four empowerments (dbang bzhi), and progressive stages of realization from coarse generation stage through subtle completion stage to the ultimate Great Perfection (rdzogs pa chen po) view.
The structure follows:
1. Pages 201-210: Maha Yoga completion stage - physical characteristics, drawing practices, channel work
2. Pages 211-220: Anu Yoga empowerments - fourfold classification (sprul bcas through rab tu sprul med)
3. Pages 221-224: Enumeration system leading to Ati Yoga
Key tantric sources include Guhyagarbha Tantra, Hevajra Tantra, Thalgyur Root Tantra (kun 'byed rgyal po), and Cakrasamvara traditions adapted into Nyingma presentation.
[8390-8421] [STRUCTURE] Har Ti Family and Methodology of Attainment
This section completes the presentation of the four families (rigs bzhi) with emphasis on the Har ti family characteristics and the four methods of attainment (sbyar bas 'grub, bsten pas 'grub, bsam pas 'grub, mthong bas 'grub). The structural progression moves from physical description to practical application.
[8390-8406] [PHILOLOGY] Descriptive Particles and Body Terminology
The Har ti description employs precise anatomical terminology:
- "Byad" (physique/proportions): Root term for bodily form
- "Dkyus" (length/proportion): Linear measurement
- "Rked skabs" (waist interval): Specific anatomical landmark
- "Snying mthams" (between eyebrows): Ajna chakra location
The particle "ni" serves definitive function: "'di ni bde ba ster bas padma can zhes bshad do" (this is explained as lotus-holder because it bestows bliss). The emphatic "yang dag 'dod" (properly accepted) establishes authoritative classification.
[8407-8436] [CONTEXT] Drawing Practices and Ritual Technology
The section presents two methods for drawing consorts (dgug pa):
1. Sngags (mantra): employing Vajrasattva heart-mind invocation
2. Rten 'brel (dependent connection): using ritual substances and sympathetic magic
The mantra construction follows standard Hevajra format with:
- Om as invocation
- Lheng lheng bsdu bsdu as binding syllables
- Rdo rje sems dpa' as deity identification
- Slong che ge mo as supplication formula
[8437-8466] [CONCEPT] Karmic Correspondence Theory
The four attainment methods operate through different karmic mechanisms:
- Sbyar ba (joining): Direct energetic union
- Bsten pa (reliance): Cumulative karmic connection
- Bsam pa (contemplation): Mental causation
- Mthong ba (seeing): Visual imprint
The hierarchy suggests that physical union yields highest results (dngos grub rab), reliance produces medium (dngos grub 'bring), and mental/seeing methods yield lesser results, though all serve as supports for each other.

[STRUCTURE] Channel Characteristics of the Five Families
[8467-8492] [PHILOLOGY] Comparative Adjectives and Length Terminology
The five family channel classification employs comparative morphology:
- "Ring ba" (long): Superlative length
- "Thung ba" (short): Minimal length
- "'Bring po" (medium): Intermediate position
The particle "ni" appears as topicalizer: "ring ba ni bde ba kha sra la phyir nas" (as for long, [it produces] external superior bliss). The causal construction "las...skye" (arises from) establishes physiological causation.
[8493-8520] [CONTEXT] Ayurvedic and Tantric Physiology Integration
The substances listed for bodhicitta expansion reflect integration of:
- Ayurvedic rasayana (rejuvenation) practices: ram nye (costus), mu zi (nutmeg)
- Tantric alchemical substances: sheep intestine (lung thug), sparrow tongue (bye'u rgya mchil)
- Standard offerings: bu ram (molasses), chang (alcohol)
These substances operate through rasa-vīrya-vipāka (taste-potency-post-digestive effect) principles mapped onto tantric subtle body.
[8521-8546] [CONCEPT] Pleasure Typology and Wisdom Correlation
The channel length correlates with pleasure characteristics:
- Long channels: Extended duration, external focus, Kriya/Upa affinity
- Short channels: Brief intensity, immediate gratification, Yoga affinity
- Medium channels: Balanced integration, Maha/Anu affinity
This typology corresponds to the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) and their progressive unfoldment through tantric practice.

- "Myong ba" (experiences): Direct perception
The particle "gis" (instrumental) establishes means: "om gyis rdo rjer bskyed pa ni" (by means of OM, producing vajra). The resultative "ni" marks the consequence.
[8651-8676] [CONTEXT] Guhyasamaja and Three Vajra System
The three syllable generation follows Guhyasamaja (gsang ba 'dus pa) architecture:
- OM generates vajra body (sku rdo rje)
- AH generates vajra speech (gsung rdo rje)
- HUM generates vajra mind (thugs rdo rje)
This corresponds to the three mysteries (gsang ba gsum) of body, speech, and mind, and their purification into three vajras.
[8677-8702] [CONCEPT] Sequential and Simultaneous Practice Modes
The text presents two modes of thigle refinement:
1. Rim gyis (gradual/sequential): Moving from root (rtsa ba) to waist (rked pa) to tip (rtsa mo)
2. Cig car (simultaneous): All three locations at once
The gradual path develops stability; the simultaneous path requires advanced capacity. Both lead to the four mudras culminating in Great Mudra (phyag rgya chen po).

3. Viramananda (bral dga'): Cessation pleasure
4. Sahajananda (lhan skyes dga'): Co-emergent pleasure
5. Chittananda (sems kyi dga'): Mind pleasure
These align with Kalachakra (dus 'khor) five-fold bliss system mapped onto completion stage.
[8755-8780] [CONCEPT] From Effort to Beyond Effort
The five stages trace a progression from effort to spontaneity:
- Stages 1-2: Require intentional engagement ('jug pa)
- Stage 3: Transitional, mind-wisdom interaction
- Stage 4: Non-dual experience (dbyer mi byed pa)
- Stage 5: Beyond extremes, neither mind nor wisdom (gang du yang ma phyed)
This corresponds to the Dzogchen progression from khrul 'khor ( Yantra ) through spontaneous presence (lhun grub).

**Summary:**
Page 203 presents the alchemical preparations for bodhicitta expansion, five family channel typology, training methodology, six body postures, thigle refinement through three syllables, and the five stages of blissful wisdom. The philological analysis reveals extensive use of causative constructions, imperative mood for practice, and ordinal enumeration. Contextual sources include Guhyasamaja, Hevajra, Cakrasamvara, and Kalachakra systems integrated with Tibetan medical rasayana practices. Conceptually, the section demonstrates the progression from material/physical practices to subtle energetic transformation and ultimately to wisdom realization.
[8473-8506] [STRUCTURE] Essential Points of Thigle Containment
This section presents the essential points (gnad) for containing thigle (bindu) through body postures (lus gnad), wind techniques (rlung gi gnad), and energetic channels (rtsa). The structure moves from preparation methods to retention techniques, establishing the infrastructure for stable bliss generation.
[8473-8492] [PHILOLOGY] Body Location and Retention Terminology
The text employs precise anatomical terminology:
- "Nu ma" (breasts): Dual energetic centers
- "Mgrin pa" (throat): Throat chakra (sngags 'khor lo)
- "Spyi bo" (crown): Crown chakra (spyi gtsug)
- "Rgyu zhabs" (heels/feet): Lower energetic gates
- "Rtsib ma" (ribs): Protective container
The particle "ni" functions as topicalizer: "rtsa bslang ba'i thabs kyi man ngag ni" (as for the method of arousing channels). The construction "la...gdab" (apply to) marks ritual application.
[8493-8520] [CONTEXT] Hevajra and Vajrayogini Subtle Body
The essential points derive from:
- Hevajra Tantra: Channel opening (rtsa phye) and thigle retention

- Thalgyur Root Tantra: Citation "ye shes gnas phyir rtsa bslangs la"
The substances (khvi sgog lang ling - dog testicle, ja ti phye ma - jasmine powder, sindhu ra - vermilion) follow standard tantric pharmacology for sealing practices.
[8521-8546] [CONCEPT] Three-fold Containment System
Thigle retention operates through three levels:
1. Rtsa (channels): Physical pathways
- Sealing with substances prevents leakage
- Ja ti and sindhu ra create energetic barrier
2. Rlung (winds): Energetic movement
- HUM recitation directs wind upward
- Gyen la 'then pa (upward draw) reverses ordinary flow
3. Thig le (drops): Essence retention
- Sbyar bas (union method) generates stability
- Mi 'dzag (non-leakage) as accomplishment sign

**Summary:**
Page 204 presents the essential points for thigle retention through six body postures, three-location refinement, and the four mudras system. Philologically, the text employs extensive causative constructions, directional commands, and definitive particles. Contextual sources include Hevajra Tantra, Guhyasamaja, Vajrayogini practices, and Thalgyur citations. Conceptually, the section demonstrates how physical postures target specific samsaric patterns, how thigle refinement generates three kaya bliss, and how mudra practice progresses from physical to non-dual realization.
[8507-8546] [STRUCTURE] Sequential Generation and Causative Syllables
This section presents the sequential generation (rim gyis bskyed pa) of vajra through three syllables (yi ge gsum) and their causative effects on body, speech, and mind. The structure follows the Guhyasamaja archetype of three-vajra generation progressing from root to tip of the subtle body vajra.
[8507-8526] [PHILOLOGY] Causative Morphology and Instrumental Particles
The text employs systematic causative constructions:
- "Bskyed pa" (causes to arise): From skyed (to grow/develop)
- "Byas pa" (causes to become): Causative of 'gyur
- "Sbyar ba" (causes to join): Causative of 'phrod
The instrumental chain: "om gyis rdo rjer bskyed pa ni" (by means of OM, vajra is produced). The particle "gyis" marks the agentive instrument, while "ni" emphasizes the result. The construction "byas pas" indicates completed action with consequence.
[8527-8546] [CONTEXT] Guhyasamaja Tantra and Three Vajra Architecture
The syllable generation follows Guhyasamaja (gsang ba 'dus pa) structure:
- OM: Sku rdo rje (vajra body) - purification of sku'i las (body karma)
- AH: Gsung rdo rje (vajra speech) - purification of gsung gi las (speech karma)
- HUM: Thugs rdo rje (vajra mind) - purification of thugs kyi las (mind karma)
This corresponds to the gsang ba gsum (three secrets) doctrine and the threefold purification into rdo rje gsum (three vajras). The Thalgyur citation "sku gsung thugs kyi rdo rje che" confirms Nyingma integration of this Sarma system.
[8547-8566] [CONCEPT] Three-fold Bliss and Kaya Correspondence
The three syllable locations generate corresponding bliss types:
1. Rtsa ba (root/base): Chos sku'i bde ba (dharmakaya bliss)
- Generated by OM
- Primordial purity (ka dag) aspect
- Non-conceptual (mi rtog) realization
2. Rked pa (waist): Longs sku'i bde ba (sambhogakaya bliss)
- Generated by AH
- Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) aspect
- Self-arising (rang byung) bliss
3. Rtsa mo (tip): Sprul sku'i bde ba (nirmanakaya bliss)
- Generated by HUM
- Compassion (thugs rje) aspect
- Pervasive (khyab brdal) activity

[STRUCTURE] Three-fold Analysis of Empowerment Divisions
[8859-8884] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative and Divisive Terminology
The text employs analytical vocabulary:
- "Dbye ba" (division): Classification, distinction
- "Nges pa" (certainty): Definitive determination
- "Rang ngo" (self-face): Own nature, identity
- "Rnam 'phrul" (manifestation): Display, emanation
- "Gsangs pa" (secret): Hidden, profound
The particle "ni" marks analysis: "don gsum pa de ltar bskur ba'i dbang gi dbye ba la gsum ste" (third topic: the divisions of empowerment bestowal are three). The enumerative "ste" establishes count.
[8885-8910] [CONTEXT] Three-fold Presentation Framework
The three divisions:
1. Dbang bzhi nges pa'i dbye bas mdor bstan
- Four empowerments definitively divided
- Brief presentation
2. Rang ngo'i dbye bas rgyas par bshad
- Self-nature divisions
- Extensive explanation
3. Rnam par 'phrul pa'i dbye bas shin tu rgya cher spros pa
- Manifestation divisions
- Very extensive elaboration
This follows standard Tibetan scholastic:
- Mdor bstan (brief presentation)
- Rgyas bshad (extensive explanation)
- Spros pa (elaboration)
[8911-8936] [CONCEPT] From Certainty to Manifestation
The progression represents:

[STRUCTURE] Four Empowerments: Definitive Determination
[8937-8962] [PHILOLOGY] Definitive and Progressive Terminology
The text employs certainty vocabulary:
- "Nges pa" (certainty): Definitive determination
- "Mthor bstan" (brief presentation): Summary
- "Smin so" (ripening signs): Indicators of maturation
- "Dpe mtshon" (example illustration): Analogical explanation
- "Rang bzhin" (own nature): Intrinsic character
The particle "ni" marks determination: "dang po ni sprul bcas kyi dbang" (first is elaborated empowerment). The emphatic "o" confirms identity.
[8963-8988] [CONTEXT] Four Empowerments in Sequence
The four empowerments definitively determined:
1. Spros bcas (elaborated):
- Full ritual structure
- External mandala
- Sequential bestowal
2. Spros med (unelaborated):
- Mantra and blessing
- Internal process
- Direct introduction
3. Shin tu spros med (thoroughly unelaborated):
- Wisdom recognition
- Beyond subject-object
- Natural presence
4. Rab tu spros med (completely unelaborated):
- Ultimate nature
- No reference point
- Spontaneous perfection
[8989-9014] [CONCEPT] Definitive Structure of Empowerment
The four-fold structure is definitive because:
1. Gradual progression necessary:
- Phyi sprul ma bchad na (if outer constructs not cut)
- Snang shes tshogs pa'i sprul ma mi chod
- Appearances and consciousness constructs continue
2. Sequential requirements:
- Each level prepares for next
- Impossible to skip stages
- Natural unfoldment
3. Correspondence to capacities:
- Different beings need different approaches
- Four empowerments match four capacities
- Complete range covered

**Summary:**
Page 214 presents the completely unelaborated empowerment's four-fold structure, three-fold analysis framework, and definitive determination of four empowerments. Philologically, the text employs completion vocabulary, four-fold partition terms, analytical enumeration, and certainty markers. Contextual sources include Thalgyur root tantra and standard Tibetan scholastic methodology. Conceptually, the section demonstrates four aspects of spontaneous recognition, three-level presentation from certainty to manifestation, and the definitive structure as necessitated by gradual requirements and capacity correspondence—culminating in complete empowerment as spontaneous perfection.
This section presents the example (dpe) of ripening signs (smin pa'i rtags) to illustrate the four empowerments through the analogy of seed growth. The structure moves from agricultural metaphor to spiritual maturation, establishing the natural law (rang bzhin) of empowerment effectiveness.
The text employs metaphorical vocabulary:
- "Zhing sa" (field ground): Suitable vessel
- "Sa bon" (seed): Empowerment potential
- "Skyon med" (without fault): Unobstructed capacity
- "Btab pa" (planted): Bestowed, deposited
- "Smin pa" (ripened): Matured, fructified
The particle "ni" marks metaphor: "dpe na zhing sa bzang po la sa bon skyon med btab pas 'bras bu smin pa ltar" (for example, just as a faultless seed planted in good field ground ripens as fruit). The comparative "ltar" establishes analogy.
The seed-field-fruit metaphor derives from:
- Early Buddhist texts: Karma as seed, mind as field
- Yogacara: Alaya-vijnana as ground, bijas as seeds
- Tantra: Dbang as seed, practice as cultivation
- Nyingma: Natural fruition without effort
The metaphor establishes:
- Field (zhing): Disciple's capacity
- Seed (sa bon): Empowerment blessing
- Cultivation (skyed): Post-empowerment practice
- Fruit ('bras bu): Realization attainment
The four empowerments as ripening stages:
1. Spros bcas: Sa bon btab (seed planted)
- Initial empowerment
- Potential deposited
- Foundation established
2. Spros med: Myu gu 'thons (sprout emerged)
- Inner sign of growth
- Practice indicators appear
- Confidence develops
3. Shin tu spros med: Me tog shar (flower bloomed)
- Qualities manifest
- Signs of realization visible
- Near to fruition
4. Rab tu spros med: Sku bzhi nges pa'i 'bras bu smin (four kaya fruit ripened)
- Complete realization
- Definitive attainment
- Natural perfection

[STRUCTURE] Self-nature Divisions of Four Empowerments
The text employs intrinsic vocabulary:
- "Rang bzhin" (own nature): Intrinsic character
- "Nus pa" (power/capacity): Functional ability
- "Rnam gzhag" (arrangement): Systematic presentation
- "Sbyor ba" (application): Engagement, union
- "Dag pa" (purification): Cleansing, clearing
The particle "ni" marks arrangement: "dang po sprul bcas kyi nus pa'i rnam gzhag ni" (first, the arrangement of elaborated empowerment's power). The emphatic "ni" establishes focus.
Each empowerment's self-nature (rang bzhin):
1. Spros bcas:
- Lus lha ru dag (body purified as deity)
- Ngag sngags su dag (speech purified as mantra)
- Yid ting 'dzin du dag (mind purified as samadhi)
- Sems chos nyid du dag (mind purified as dharmata)
2. Spros med:
- Snang ba phyi rol don 'khrul pa stongs (outer appearances' delusion ceases)
- 'Phrin las bzhi la sbyor (engages four activities)
- Bde gsal stong gsum myong (experiences bliss-clarity-emptiness)
- Zung 'jug gi nus pa (union power)
3. Shin tu spros med:
- 'Phrin las bzhi la sbyor (four activities)
- Beyond ordinary perception
4. Rab tu spros med:
- Bde ba (bliss), gsal ba (clarity), mi rtog pa (non-conceptuality)
- Zung 'jug gi nus pa (union power)
The self-nature reveals progressive purification:
1. Body-speech-mind-sems:
- Coarse to subtle
- External to internal
- Constructed to natural
2. Appearance-activity-experience:
- Snang ba (appearance): What appears purifies
- 'Phrin las (activity): What is done purifies
- Nyams (experience): What is felt purifies
3. Union power (zung 'jug gi nus pa):
- Bde stong zung 'jug (bliss-emptiness union)
- Gsal stong zung 'jug (clarity-emptiness union)
- Rig stong zung 'jug (awareness-emptiness union)

[STRUCTURE] Elaborated Empowerment: Changes and Transformations
The text employs process vocabulary:
- "'Gyur ba" (change): Transformation, alteration
- "Rtsi ba" (reckon/calculate): Determine, assess
- "Gnas pa" (abide): Stability, remaining
- "Nye bar rtogs pa" (near realization): Proximate understanding
- "Lus ngag yid sems" (body-speech-mind-mind): Four aspects
The particle "ni" marks assessment: "gnyis pa sprul med kyi dbang bzhi'i 'gyur ba rtsi ba ni" (second, calculating the changes of four unelaborated empowerments). The emphatic "ni" establishes topic.
The four changes (bsgyur ba bzhi) in each empowerment:
1. 'Jug pa (entry): Initial engagement
2. Thob pa (attainment): Achievement gained
3. Gnas pa (abiding): Stable establishment
4. Nye bar rtogs pa (near realization): Proximate to full understanding
These correspond to:
- Four reliances (rton pa bzhi)
- Four stages of arhatship
- Four levels of bodhisattva grounds
The changes represent maturation:
1. 'Jug pa: Initiation
- Entering the path
- Beginning transformation
- New orientation
2. Thob pa: Attainment
- Gaining stability
- Establishing qualities
- Consolidating gains
3. Gnas pa: Abiding
- Remaining stable
- Not regressing
- Continuous development
4. Nye bar rtogs pa: Near realization
- Close to completion
- Almost fully matured
- Ready for fruition

**Summary:**
Page 215 presents the ripening signs example, self-nature divisions, and changes/transformation analysis of four empowerments. Philologically, the text employs agricultural metaphor vocabulary, intrinsic terminology, and process vocabulary for change. Contextual sources include early Buddhist seed-field metaphors, Yogacara bija theory, and tantric empowerment traditions. Conceptually, the section demonstrates four stages of ripening through seed-flower-fruit analogy, progressive purification from body to awareness, and four changes as maturation markers—all illustrating empowerment as natural unfoldment toward spontaneous perfection.
