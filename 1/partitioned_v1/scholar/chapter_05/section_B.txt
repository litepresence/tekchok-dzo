**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage describes the three degrees of unelaborated empowerment fruition: (1) extremely unelaborated produces awareness-definite-arrival, (2) completely unelaborated produces dharmatā-exhaustion appearance, (3) utterly unelaborated produces Buddha-ground connection. Then introduces the ultimate fruition: Vajradhara's ground with four kayas, four wisdoms, and thirty-two deities/wisdoms.
- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *shin tu spros med kyis rig pa tshad phebs* (extremely unelaborated causes definite arrival of awareness), *rab tu spros med kyis chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba* (completely unelaborated produces dharmatā-exhaustion appearance), *phyi snang ba'i yon tan re dang nang nyams ting nge 'dzin re dang gsang ba lta dgongs khyad par can re dang yongs rdzogs bstan pa'i tshad re thob nas* (obtaining one outer appearance quality, one inner experience samadhi, one secret view-intention distinction, one complete teaching measure), *zag bcas mi snang bar sangs rgyas kyi sa la sbyor ba* (connect to Buddha-ground without visible outflows), *thun mong du gnas skabs kyi yon tan* (common intermediate attainments), *mthar thug gi 'bras bu* (ultimate fruition), *mgon po rdo rje 'chang gi sa* (Lord Vajradhara's ground), *sku gsung thugs mi zad pa rgyan gyi 'khor lo'i yon tan rdzogs par thob pa* (obtaining complete qualities of inexhaustible body-speech-mind ornament wheel), *sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa'i zhing khams mdor bstan* (brief showing of inseparable body-wisdom pure land), *bsam gyis mi khyab pa'i dbye ba rgyas par bshad* (extensive explanation of inconceivable divisions), *mngon par shes pa mtha' yas pas dbang bsgyur ba* (empowerment transformation through limitless superknowledges).
- **[CONCEPT]**
**Three Unelaborated Fruitions:**
1. Extremely unelaborated: definite arrival of awareness; one outer appearance quality, one inner experience samadhi, one secret view-intention, one complete teaching measure obtained; without visible outflows, connect to Buddha-ground
2. Completely unelaborated: dharmatā-exhaustion appearance
3. Utterly unelaborated: same progression as above
These are "common intermediate attainments" (*thun mong gnas skabs kyi yon tan*).
**Ultimate Fruition:**
- Vajradhara's ground
- Inexhaustible body-speech-mind ornament wheel qualities complete
- Three divisions: (1) inseparable body-wisdom pure land briefly shown, (2) inconceivable divisions extensively explained, (3) limitless superknowledges transformation
**Thirty-Two from Thirty-Two Empowerments:**
- Four signs, four measures, four ripened bodies = 12
- Four wisdoms, four light-rays, four light-emanations, four fields = 16 + 12 = 28 + 4 = 32 ripened producing benefit
- Path: obtained 32 empowerments
- Four kayas: basis-abiding wisdom, characteristic-holding wisdom, all-knowing wisdom, all-aspect-knowing wisdom (4 × 4 = 16)
- Four wisdom knowings (4 × 4 = 16) = 32 body-wisdom enumerations
**Vajradhara's Sixteen Acts:** These 32 completions are Vajradhara's sixteen acts with sixteen wisdom objects.

**Analysis:**
- **[CONTEXT]** Describes the spontaneously accomplished mandalas of the five grounds from the five wisdom lights' self-light.
- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *ye shes kyi snang ba'i rang 'od lnga las gzhi lnga'i dkyil 'khor lhun gyis grub pa* (five grounds' mandalas spontaneously accomplished from five wisdom lights' self-light), *ser pos rin chen 'byung ldan* (yellow produces Ratnasambhava), *dmar pos snang ba mtha' yas* (red produces Amitabha), *ljang gus don yod grub pa* (green produces Amoghasiddhi), *dkyil 'khor de dag las gdul bya'i zhing du 'phrin las bzhi'i sprul pa 'gyed* (from those mandalas emanate four activity emanations to taming fields), *gdul zhing shar phyogs mngon par dga' ba* (taming field east Abhirati), *lho dpal dang ldan pa* (south Shri-Sambhava), *nub padma brtsegs pa* (west Padmavati), *byang las rab rdzogs pa* (north Krishna-Karma).
- **[CONCEPT]** The five wisdom lights spontaneously accomplish five mandalas:
- White light → Akshobhya's mandala
- Yellow light → Ratnasambhava
- Red light → Amitabha
- Green light → Amoghasiddhi
From these mandalas, four activity emanations spread to taming fields:
- East: Abhirati (Akshobhya's field)
- South: Shri-Sambhava (Ratnasambhava's field)
- West: Padmavati (Amitabha's field)
- North: Krishna-Karma (Amoghasiddhi's field)
These four mature sentient beings.
