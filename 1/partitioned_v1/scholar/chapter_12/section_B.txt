[17448-17476] [STRUCTURE] # Expanded Explanation of Alaya and Dharmakaya
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation (*rgyas par bshad pa*) in two sections:
1. Alaya expanded explanation
2. Dharmakaya expanded explanation
**Alaya Structure (17451-17476):**
From *thal 'gyur*:
- Alaya and dharmakaya vital point
- Alaya briefly explained
- Dharmas and non-dharmas all's basis
- Essence word distinction with
- Essence latencies vessel
- Classification: body, connection, various, primordial basis
Fivefold analysis of alaya:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*): Compounded virtue, samsara dharmas, latencies with, vessel
2. Definition (*nges tshig*): All-pervading (*kun mang*), gathered, many's time-place or support basis abiding
3. Classification (*dbye ba*):
- *ye don gyi kun gzhi* (Primordial meaning alaya)
- *sbyor ba don gyi kun gzhi* (Connection meaning alaya)
- *bag chags lus kyi kun gzhi* (Latency body alaya)
- *bag chags sna tshogs pa'i kun gzhi* (Latency various alaya)
[17477-17493] [CONCEPT] Four Alayas Detailed:
1. **Primordial meaning alaya**: Samsara dharmas all's sphere first basis; investigating doer first movement rigpa considering, coeminent ignorance, from reversal spoken
2. **Connection meaning alaya**: That knowing itself self ignorance, samsara connection; knowing, nirvana connection aspect spoken
3. **Latency body alaya**: Root knowing itself body latencies possessing; flesh, blood, light, mind-body arising aspect spoken
4. **Latency various alaya**: That knowing itself impure action latencies source, all's basis making aspect spoken
Though four names, one knowing's aspect four distinctions turned, labeled.
[17494-17507] [CONCEPT] Alaya as Eight Consciousnesses:
From first movement until now, all knowing's support alaya, dependent aggregates eight abiding; individually distinguished, root samsara basis-opening arising basis: primordial meaning and samsara-nirvana connection; body appearing as body; mind latencies dependent alaya basis established. That time knowing's aspect outer-inner not severed, alaya consciousness labeled.
From that, five faculties' respective knowing concept-free five objects holding aspect: five sense-consciousnesses (*sgo lnga'i rnam shes*) labeled.
That time concept-investigation inward-looking realization first that met, mind knowing (*yid shes*), investigating distinguishes specifically holding, object as desired—one mind different aspects known.
Functions (*byed las*):
- Primordial delusion basis makes
- Connection body-mind linked happiness-suffering all-connection makes
- Body body and that aggregates many conditions makes
- Latencies action and afflictions maturation cause-condition makes
Names-entry reasons (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*):
- Latencies prior-later intermediate
- Action karmic result five outer connection
- Cause-result joining
- All-connection binding makes
- Therefore "kun gzhi" word entry
---
**Summary:** Page 409 provides the expanded explanation of alaya with its fivefold analysis (essence, definition, classification, function, name-entry). The four alayas map different aspects of the deluded basis across ground, connection, body, and latencies.
[17508-17547] [STRUCTURE] # Dharmakaya Expanded Explanation
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation of dharmakaya (*chos sku rgyas par bshad pa*) following the same fivefold structure:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*)
2. Definition (*nges tshig*)
3. Classification (*dbye ba*)
4. Function (*byed las*)
5. Name-entry reason (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*)
From *thal 'gyur* (17511-17522):
- Dharmakaya elaboration-free
- Self grasping marks nonexistent
- Essence empty-luminous nondual
- Classification: dharma, longs, sprul
- Three distinctions superior enters
- Definition: dharma true path
- Body from that accomplished
[17524-17547] [CONCEPT] Dharmakaya Essence and Classification:
**Essence**: Primordial ka dag great inner-clear nature spontaneous arising basis, subtle ye shes abiding; deluded time that resound placed, mind-entity elaboration-free one-taste realized, experience possessing.
From *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17528-17547):
- Abiding manner abiding-mode two
- Primordial basis abiding
- Delusion object abiding
- Primordial essence nature
- Compassion three aspects abiding
- That also essence body abiding
- Dharma longs sprul parts
- Undivided dividing-free manner
- Babs accomplished itself also
- Body color etc. mind object nonexistent
- Nature arising light manner
- White red yellow green blue
- Marks marks-possessing nonexistent
- Markless knowing babs accomplished
- Compassion arising various
- Thus one indefinite
- Various appearing therefore basis called
- Delusion object self-placed
- Resting self-liberation spread-bestowal
[17548-17602] [CONTEXT] Citations from *rang shar* and *de nyid*:
From *rang shar* (17549-17553):
- Dharmakaya ye shes great scripture
- Characteristic three aspects possessing
- Essence nature compassion three
- Dharmakaya's characteristic is
From *de nyid* (17556-17567):
- Dharmakaya's palace unchanging this
- Self cit center clearly abides
- Empty ye shes essence
- Clear light essence
- Self-arisen rigpa essence
- Three essences possessing dharmakaya
- Ye shes meaning realized path journey nonexistent
- Expression limit-free dharmakaya great this
- All abiding, all realize not
- Mind nonexistent, sems nonexistent, ignorance delusion nonexistent
[17568-17593] [CONCEPT] Ninefold Classification of Three Kayas:
Sometimes labeled ground-abiding ye shes, sometimes dharmakaya, sometimes liberation-basis—one essence different aspects spoken. Body and ye shes gathering-separation free intent known.
**Three kayas each with three subdivisions:**
**Dharmakaya (*chos sku*):**
1. Dharmakaya's dharmakaya: Rigpa itself; dharma appearing objects, body rigpa's essence unceased
2. Dharmakaya's longs sku: Five lights
3. Dharmakaya's sprul sku: Eye faculty seeing unceased
Dharmakaya's object: sky pure
Dharmakaya's abode: cit
Dharmakaya's path: jewel crystal cave possessing
**Longs sku (*longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku*):**
1. Longs sku's chos sku: Five ye shes appearance unceased clearly abiding
2. Longs sku's longs sku: Five bindus' path with
3. Longs sku's sprul sku: Five doors' knowing objects arising rigpa
Longs sku abode: *a wa dhūtī*
Longs sku path: small tip right
**Sprul sku (*sprul pa'i sku*):**
1. Sprul sku's chos sku: Two lamps
2. Sprul sku's longs sku: Seeing five lights
3. Sprul sku's sprul sku: Five afflictions arising self self-rigpa
Sprul sku abode: head
Sprul sku path: eye
Sprul sku object: delusion appearance
[17594-17643] [CONCEPT] Resolution of Apparent Contradiction:
Question: Dharmakaya without mind and afflictions; its classification longs sprul of three kayas, sprul sku's sprul sku two—five doors' knowing and afflictions called—contradiction?
Answer: No contradiction. Consciousness and afflictions' own time rigpa's self-resound possessing, that spoken; consciousness and afflictions actual sprul sku not.
---
**Summary:** Page 410 completes the expanded explanation of dharmakaya with its fivefold analysis and presents the complex ninefold classification of the three kayas (each kaya having three aspects). The resolution of the apparent contradiction between dharmakaya's purity and the three kayas' classification maintains rigpa's self-resound as the bridge.
[17636-17643] [CONCEPT] Dharmakaya Function (*byed las*):
The essence ka dag's dharmakaya makes liberation basis; path time empty-clear dharmakaya's part makes liberating action; those three kayas make purifying and purification basis action.
[17644-17650] [CONTEXT] Dharmakaya Name-Entry Reason (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*):
- Primordially dust-free and stainless
- Abiding in state possessing but not recognizing
- Secret dharma existing
- Final meaning sought-after fruition existing dharma
- Therefore dharmakaya word spoken
[17644-17711] [STRUCTURE] # Second Topic: Mind (*sems*) and Wisdom (*ye shes*) Distinction
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the second major topic in two sections:
1. Essence brief presentation
2. Respective natures expanded explanation
Brief presentation from *mu tig phreng ba* (17649-17651):
- Mind and ye shes distinction
- Scholars should know
**Mind (*sems*) defined (17652-17654):**
Root ignorance coeminent possessing, stain with, samsara dharma self-deceiving, not ye shes's sun obscured, like cloud.
**Ye shes defined (17654-17655):**
Dharmakaya coeminent possessing, stainless, mind's memory-contemplation not abiding together, like sun.
From *de nyid* (17657-17664):
- Mind latencies all's basis
- Embodied stains is
- Grasped object holder mind
- Therefore samsara's dharmata
And:
- Ye shes memory basis itself free
From *klong drug pa* (17666-17667):
- Mind and ye shes own essence not distinguished
- Like sun cloud-mass obscured
- Outer appearance's objects cannot do
[17668-17711] [CONCEPT] Mind Detailed Analysis:
Mind is all action and afflictions and latencies' basis, source, maturation-maker, all-awakener, ignorance home always abiding, ye shes's sun contradicting, obscuring.
From *rang shar* (17672-17678):
- Mind latencies all gathering
- Mind afflictions all maturing
- Mind latencies all's basis is
- That latency also difficult to exhaust
- Self appearance obscuring
- Ignorance equally abiding
From *mu tig phreng ba* (17680-17684):
- Mind gathering arising
- Stain also with obscured
- Alaya-gathering mind etc.
- Stain number became
**Threefold mind structure (17699-17702):**
Mind appearing objects "this and this" signs, names, general holders; grasped object mind. That distinction investigating finely discerning, holder subject mind—two gathered.
"Grasped object holder mind" thus explained.
Scriptural support:
- *thun mong gi gzhung*: Mind ceased, that body manifestly did
- *tshigs gsal du*: Mind and mental factors' entering also continuum ceased
- *dkon mchog brtsegs pa*: Mind, yid, consciousness also free; samadhi abode not abandoning; this thus-gone's heart's secret unimaginable
---
**Summary:** Page 411 provides dharmakaya's function and name-entry reason, then inaugurates the mind-wisdom distinction. The analysis establishes mind as the stained, deluded basis of samsara, contrasted with ye shes as the unstained sun-like dharmakaya.
[17712-17736] [CONCEPT] Ye Shes (Wisdom) Detailed Analysis:
Ye shes is sky-like elaboration-ceased, buddha dharmas measureless basis and source, dharmakaya's home always abiding, afflictions and latencies thicket all burned, fire-like abiding.
**Five characteristics (*mtshan nyid*):**
From *rang shar* (17712-17713):
- Ye shes essence sky-like
- Dharmas nature free
From *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17714-17736):
- Ye shes's clear part: essence sun unclouded from primordial time, knowing luminosity-emptiness's nature abiding
- Ye shes's empty part: nature space from primordial time free of elaboration, dharmakaya unchanging
- Ye shes's knowing part: uncompounded samsara-nirvana from primordial time pure, all-arising's basis, knowing
- Ye shes's liberated part: samsara's nature exhausted, buddhahood obtained, nirvana not sought, delusion source from primordial time pure
- Ye shes's pervading part: pervading all samsara-nirvana, knowing inexpressible, inconceivable
**Five ye shes (*ye shes lnga*) from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:**
1. Dharmadhatu wisdom (*chos dbyings ye shes*)
2. Mirror-like wisdom (*me long lta bu'i ye shes*)
3. Equality wisdom (*mnyam nyid ye shes*)
4. Discriminating wisdom (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes*)
5. All-accomplishing wisdom (*bya ba grub pa'i ye shes*)
**Four wisdoms (*ye shes bzhi*) from *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung*:**
- Dharmadhatu: knowing self-face dharmata
- Mirror-like: knowing all as reflection
- Equality: knowing samsara-nirvana equal
- Discriminating: knowing particulars without confusion
[17737-17750] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"Ye shes mirror-like like / All dharmas arising clear / Various knowings emanate / Play emanation unceased / Uncontrived spontaneous nature / Suchness time three knowledge-free / Dharmadhatu wisdom great / Samsara-nirvana equal knowing / Equality wisdom great / Particulars distinct knowing / Discriminating wisdom great / Play activities accomplish knowing / All-accomplishing wisdom great"
[17751-17782] [CONCEPT] Mind-Ye Shes Distinction Summary:
Mind (*sems*):
- Stained with ignorance, afflictions, latencies
- Samsara's basis, cause, maturation
- Deluded, grasping, conceiving
- Cloud-like, obscuring
Ye shes:
- Stainless, primordially pure
- Dharmakaya's essence
- Knowing, clear, liberated
- Sun-like, illuminating
- Five/fourfold classifications
**Fivefold classification (*dbye ba*) from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:**
1. Dharmadhatu wisdom: dharmata's sphere knowing
2. Mirror-like wisdom: all dharmas clear mirror-like
3. Equality wisdom: samsara-nirvana equal knowing
4. Discriminating wisdom: particulars distinct knowing
5. All-accomplishing wisdom: activities accomplishing
[17783-17798] [CONTEXT] Citations from *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung*:
"Mirror-like wisdom like / All dharmas arising clear / Self-face dharmata knowing / Dharmadhatu wisdom great / Samsara-nirvana equal knowing / Equality wisdom great / Particulars distinct knowing / Discriminating wisdom great / Activities accomplish knowing / All-accomplishing wisdom great"
**Three aspects (*mtshan nyid gsum*) of ye shes:**
1. Essence (*ngo bo*): knowing
2. Nature (*rang bzhin*): luminous
3. Compassion (*thugs rje*): unimpeded arising
---
**Summary:** Page 412 provides extensive analysis of ye shes with its five/fourfold classifications, characteristics, and distinctions from mind. The five ye shes structure parallels standard Buddhist phenomenology while being reinterpreted through the Dzogchen lens.
[17799-17823] [STRUCTURE] # Third Topic: Distinct Dharmas Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the third major topic: analysis of distinct dharmas (*khyad par can gyi chos gshan rnam par bshad pa*). This section systematically examines various categories that distinguish the Dzogchen view.
The page begins with citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* and *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung* on the five ye shes, then transitions to distinct dharmas analysis.
[17799-17820] [CONTEXT] Extended citations establishing ye shes classifications:
From *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
- Ye shes mirror-like like
- Various emanations unceased
- Uncontrived spontaneous nature
- Time three knowledge-free
From *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung*:
- Five ye shes thus
- Dharmadhatu essence dharmata
- Mirror-like all clear
- Equality samsara-nirvana equal
- Discriminating particular distinct
- All-accomplishing activities accomplish
[17821-17850] [CONCEPT] Integration of Ground-Path-Fruition:
The distinct dharmas are presented across three stages:
1. **Ground** (*gzhi*): Primordial purity (*ka dag*), spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*), thigle, lamp aspects
2. **Path** (*lam*): Vision (*snang ba*), measure (*tshad*), familiarization (*goms*), signs (*rtags*)
3. **Fruition** ('bras bu): Dharmakaya, exhaustion (*zad pa*), liberation (*grol ba*), buddhahood (*sangs rgyas*)
[17851-17870] [PHILOLOGY] Key terminology of distinct dharmas:
- *rang byung* (self-arisen): Not made by causes-conditions, primordially existing
- *lhun grub* (spontaneously accomplished): Without effort, naturally perfect
- *cer mthong* (direct seeing): Without meditation, immediate recognition
- *gcer grol* (direct liberation): Without antidote, self-liberated
- *thod rgal* (direct transcendence): Spontaneous, leap-over progression
[17871-17895] [CONTEXT] Citation from *kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long*:
The text cites extensively on the spontaneously accomplished nature:
- Spontaneous accomplishment thus
- From primordial time accomplished
- Not made by anyone
- Self-abiding dharmata
- Unchanging great bliss
- Without seeking, self-obtained
[17896-17920] [CONCEPT] The Four Lamps Integration:
The distinct dharmas culminate in the integration of the four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*):
1. *rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma* (Far-reaching water lamp)
2. *thig le stong pa'i sgron ma* (Empty bindu lamp)
3. *dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Completely pure sphere lamp)
4. *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma* (Self-arising wisdom lamp)
Each lamp has:
- Its own essence, definition, classification
- Specific measures and signs
- Integration with the three kayas
- Progressive familiarization stages
---
**Summary:** Page 413 initiates the third topic on distinct dharmas, establishing the ground-path-fruition structure and key terminology. The integration of the four lamps system provides the comprehensive framework for Dzogchen practice and realization.
[17921-17960] [STRUCTURE] # Distinct Dharmas: Channels and Winds
**Analysis:** Longchenpa continues the distinct dharmas analysis with detailed examination of subtle body physiology:
**Central Channel (*rtsa dbu ma*):**
- Abode of dharmakaya
- Unchanging great bliss
- Primordial purity essence
- Runs from crown to navel
**Right Channel (*rtsa ro ma*):**
- Abode of longs sku
- Spontaneous luminosity
- Expansive qualities
**Left Channel (*rtsa rkyang ma*):**
- Abode of sprul sku
- Various manifestations
- Compassionate activity
[17961-18000] [CONCEPT] The Four Wheels (*'khor lo bzhi*):
1. **Crown wheel** (*spyi bo'i 'khor lo*): Thousand-petaled lotus, dharmakaya, white
2. **Throat wheel** (*mgrin pa'i 'khor lo*): Sixteen-petaled, longs sku, red
3. **Heart wheel** (*snying ga'i 'khor lo*): Eight-petaled, sprul sku, blue
4. **Navel wheel** (*lte ba'i 'khor lo*): Sixty-four petaled, ground of emanation, yellow-green
Each wheel has:
- Specific color correspondence
- Kaya association
- Bindu concentration
- Light manifestation patterns
[18001-18040] [PHILOLOGY] Wind (*rlung*) terminology:
- *dbyangs ma* (life-wind): Central channel, five-colored
- *srog rlung* (vital wind): Heart, white, awareness-supporting
- *khyab byed* (pervading): Body-pervading, wisdom-arising
- *me mnyam* (fire-equalizing): Digestion, heat, luminosity
- *gyen rgyu* (upward-moving): Speech, upper body functions
- *thur sel* (downward-clearing): Excretion, lower body functions
[18041-18080] [CONTEXT] Citations from *gsang ba snying po* and commentaries:
The text cites standard tantric physiology reinterpreted through Dzogchen:
- Life-wind abides heart center
- White bindu, red bindu union
- Wisdom wind clear light
- Spontaneous vajra chain
[18081-18120] [CONCEPT] Thigle (Bindu) Classifications:
**Threefold bindu:**
1. **White bindu** (*dkar thig*): Father essence, method, crown
2. **Red bindu** (*dmar thig*): Mother essence, wisdom, navel
3. **Indestructible bindu** (*mi shigs thig*): Heart center, union, primordial
**Fourfold bindu:**
- Earth, water, fire, wind bindus
- Related to four elements
- Support for four kayas
---
**Summary:** Page 414 provides detailed analysis of subtle body distinct dharmas: channels, wheels, winds, and bindus. The physiological schema supports the visionary phenomenology of the four lamps through embodied practice.
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the final distinct dharmas related to light manifestations (*'od kyi snang ba*)—the culmination of the four lamps system.
**Five Lights (*'od lnga*):**
1. **Blue** (*sngon po*): Dharmadhatu wisdom, center, essence
2. **White** (*dkar po*): Mirror-like wisdom, east, clarity
3. **Yellow** (*ser po*): Equality wisdom, south, equality
4. **Red** (*dmar po*): Discriminating wisdom, west, discernment
5. **Green** (*ljang gu*): All-accomplishing wisdom, north, activity
The lights integrate with the sphere lamp (*dbyings kyi sgron ma*):
- Blue: Central pervading, unchanging
- White: Clarity aspect, mirror-like
- Yellow: Equalizing, ground aspect
- Red: Discriminating, path aspect
- Green: Accomplishing, fruition aspect
**Progressive manifestation:**
1. Sky-blue pervading (*nam mkha' ltar khyab pa*)
2. Five lights arising (*'od lnga shar ba*)
3. Rainbow sphere ('ja' tshon dbyings)
4. Wisdom light (*ye shes kyi 'od*)
5. Self-luminous bindu (*rang gsal thig le*)
- *gsal ba* (luminous): Clear, knowing aspect
- *mdangs* (radiance): Effulgence, spreading
- *zer* (ray): Projected light, directional
- *thig le* (bindu): Spherical light, concentrated
- *snang ba* (appearance): Manifested light, phenomenal
- *ka dag 'od* (primordially pure light): Unstained essence
Extensive citations on light phenomenology:
- Like sky-rainbow, pure of afflictions
- Sphere vast, expanse uncut
- Reality pure, objects arise
- Blue pervading, unchanging
- Five colors, condition-meeting
The light manifestations correlate with kayas:
- **Dharmakaya**: Blue light, essence, sky-like
- **Longs sku**: Five lights, enjoyment, rainbow-like
- **Sprul sku**: Various appearances, emanation, form-like
Progressive stages:
1. Outer lights (*phyi 'od*): Preliminary, sense-based
2. Inner lights (*nang 'od*): Meditative, mind-based
3. Secret lights (*gsang 'od*): Advanced, wisdom-based
4. Suchness lights (*de nyid 'od*): Ultimate, nature-based
---
**Summary:** Page 415 completes the distinct dharmas analysis with the five lights system and their integration with the kayas. The light phenomenology represents the culmination of the four lamps' visionary progression.
