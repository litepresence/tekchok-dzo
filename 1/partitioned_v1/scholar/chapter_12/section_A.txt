[16743-16756] [STRUCTURE] # Completion of the Twelve Similes Section
**Analysis:** Longchenpa completes the twelfth topic (*mthun dpe*) of the second lamp's eleven-fold analysis. The section employs a quadripartite simile structure comparing bindu (*thig le*) manifestations to:
1. Peacock tail (*rma bya'i mdongs*) - round self-resounding
2. Vulture eye (*pha khra'i mig*) - clarity portion and resound portion
3. Fish eye (*nya'i mig*) - luminous appearance and bindu particles
4. Thief's eye (*rkun mo'i mig*) - sparkle radiance and light rays
The citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (lines 16751-16755) authenticates these similes as standard Nyingthig technical vocabulary rather than literary ornamentation.
[16757-16797] [STRUCTURE] # The Third Lamp: dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma
**Analysis:** Longchenpa inaugurates the third of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*): The Lamp of the Completely Pure Sphere. The structural schema follows the established eleven-topic format:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. rang bzhin (nature)
5. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
6. goms tshul (familiarization manner)
7. tshad (measure)
8. gnas (abode)
9. sgo (door)
10. dngos (actual)
11. mthun dpe (simile)
This architectural consistency reflects the *mdzod* genre's encyclopedic imperative toward systematic classification.
[16770-16773] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *mthing ga* (blue): The base color (*khya ba chen po*) from which the five colors spread (*lnga ldan du mched*)
- *mu khyud* (rim): The circular perimeter of light
- *pad 'dab* (petals): Lotus-petal structures within the bindu
- *za 'og ber khyim* (house under a barrel): Technical simile for the enclosed, stable nature of this lamp's appearance
- *lu gu rgyud* (snake noose): The channel structure (*ra ba*) from which awareness shoots rays (*gzer 'debs*)
[16774-16783] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The text quotes: "The lamps of completely-pure nature and sphere gather the essence of awareness / appear at the snake-noose fence / for one familiarized with this, that meaning itself / blue unchanging self-luminous / abides at the rim's fence / self-luminous appears as outer object / essence itself is unfabricated."
This establishes the third lamp as integrative—gathering (*sdud*) the scattered elements into the *lu gu rgyud* structure while maintaining the *ka dag* (primordial purity) character.
[16784-16797] [CONCEPT] The visionary phenomenology:
The lamp manifests through progressive stages:
1. Initial gaze (*dang po*) to treasury-brow space (*mdzod spu'i thad*): sky-blue pervading light appears
2. Five colors emerge from within (*nang nas kha dog lnga 'char*)
3. Appear at eye corners (*mig zur gnyis*) like rainbow error (*'ja' ma nor*)
The citation from *mu tig phreng ba* (lines 16787-16796) provides scriptural authority: "Like sky-rainbow / pure afflictions stain exhausted / sphere vast expanse uncut / reality object completely-pure / from both objects arises / pervade great blue unchanging / appearance pure condition meet / becomes five colors."
---
**Summary:** Page 401 transitions from the second lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) to the third lamp (*dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*), completing the twelve similes and initiating the eleven-topic structural analysis of the sphere lamp. The progression moves from bindu particle phenomenology to the expansive sphere (*dbyings*) as integrating ground.
[16798-16805] [PHILOLOGY] Etymological analysis of *dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*:
- *dbyings* (sphere/expanse): From *rig pa'i rang yul* (awareness's own object) and *snang ba'i 'char gzhi* (appearance's arising basis)
- *rnam par dag pa* (completely pure): Absence of stains (*dri ma med pa*) in appearing objects (*yul du snang ba*)
- *sgron ma* (lamp): From *lu gu rgyud go rar bzung nas snang rig gsal bar byed pa* (grasping at the snake-noose fence, making appearance-awareness clear)
The definition emphasizes the lamp's dual function: establishing the sphere as both the basis of awareness and the ground of appearance.
[16801-16817] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The sphere makes awareness's own object / Vajra itself is the snake-noose / This itself enters within / Self-essence free of conceptualization / Also at the inner sphere's fence / Not grasped, not abiding, by this manner / Without separation continuously appears / To appearing objects / Purity exhausts stain numbers / Lamp's vajra snake-noose / Sky itself is focused / Without nature causes appearance / Mind holds that meaning / Therefore is definition of nature / From primordial time abides without gathering-separation."
This verse establishes the ungraspable (*ma bzung*) yet continuously appearing (*rgyun du snang*) character of the sphere lamp.
[16818-16835] [CONCEPT] Threefold classification (*dbye ba*) of the sphere lamp:
1. *gzhi la gnas pa'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Ground-abiding sphere lamp): Wisdom and light body spontaneously arising within the cit
2. *lam la snang ba'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Path-appearance sphere lamp): Five-rim fence gathering the bindu's clarity at the lotus-petal bindu
3. 'bras bu yul la snang ba'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma (Fruition-object sphere lamp): Snake-noose holding with five-color net, half-net, under-barrel, etc.
This triad maps the same lamp across ground-path-fruition (*gzhi lam 'bras bu*) structure characteristic of Dzogchen presentation.
[16836-16849] [CONCEPT] The nature (*rang bzhin*) as nonduality:
The nature is identified as the nonduality of primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*). The citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (lines 16838-16849) describes:
- Nature appearance not ceasing
- Mind-entity and memory all exhausted
- Appearance self-pure in sphere
- Awareness without conceptualization
- Unmoving equal cognition
- All exhausted in the sphere
- Primordial conceptualization exhausted
- Nature completely-pure abides in sphere
- Expressing-appearance word-mind nondual
- Without outer-inner in sphere
- Abides in great ease
[16850-16862] [CONCEPT] Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*) analysis:
The characteristic is defined as the equal purity (*zang ma*) of:
- Outer light sphere empty-luminous (*phyi 'od kyi dbyings stong gsal zang ma*)
- Self-awareness sphere primordially pure (*rang rig pa'i dbyings ka dag zang mar*)
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (lines 16854-16862) establishes this through the metaphor of unfabricated primordial purity (*ye nas ka dag chen por*).
[16863-16897] [STRUCTURE] # Familiarization Method Section
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the sixth topic (*goms tshul*): the method of familiarization. The procedure involves:
1. Separating samsara-nirvana boundary (*'khor 'das ru shan phye*)
2. Placing body-speech in natural state (*lus ngag rnal du phab*)
3. Introducing awareness in the sphere's fence directly (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcu*)
4. Continuous practice day-night (*nyin mtshan med par*)
Progressive stages of appearance:
- First: merely mirror-like light (*od me long tsam*)
- Then: portions (*dum bu*)
- Then: land-area extent (*yul gru tsam*)
- Then: sky-filling (*nam mkha' gang ba*)
- Finally: whatever appears arises as sphere's appearance, seeing kayas until exhaustion of appearances
Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (16872-16883) and *rang shar* (16884-16897) authenticate this progressive visionary unfolding.
---
**Summary:** Page 402 provides the definition, threefold classification, nature, characteristic, and familiarization method of the third lamp. The structural analysis reveals how Longchenpa maps the visionary experience through progressive stages from mirror-light to sky-filling appearances.
[16898-16949] [STRUCTURE] # Measure, Abode, and Door of the Third Lamp
**Analysis:** Longchenpa continues the eleven-topic analysis with:
- Seventh topic: Measure (*tshad*)
- Eighth topic: Abode (*gnas*)
- Ninth topic: Door (*sgo*)
**Measure (16898-16902):** Through practice, from nose-tip to eyebrow-midpoint space, blue spreading five-color under-barrel appearances, mirror-like, portions, vision-pervading inner kaya arising—this is the measure.
[16902-16949] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *gsang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*:
The citation (lines 16903-16949) provides detailed measurements and correlations:
- Sphere and awareness gaze: unobstructed sky gaze
- Sphere's inside snake-noose placed, not separated
- Who sees thus equals Samantabhadra
- Bindu seen, gaze directed upward, appearance progresses
- Four finger-widths from upper space: separated from body
- All appearing broken-vessel-like: attain emanation excellence
- Whatever appears as seen object: likewise to masses
- Outer appearance ceased: sixteen moments
- Unripened bindu to kaya: six, ten, five—definitely longs sku
- Inner body exhausted reaching place: likewise fingers, etc.
- Here directed, elements naturally stopped
- Birth-entry distinction: all dharmas exhausted self-place
- Without grasping abides: emanation kaya
- This entering's force empowerment
- Who attains birth's self-power
- Appearance's own sound empty-sound
- Manifestly returns, appears as delusion
- Does all beings' benefit
- For awareness equal one
- Three-thousand great beings' transference
- Thus gradual and instantaneous body attainment
- All these exhausted measure liberation
- These all definite fruition
- Supreme ground great mandala attainment
This extensive citation establishes the precise correlations between visionary stages (*snang ba*) and resultant kayas (*sku*).
[16950-16982] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* and *rang shar*:
The measure is further elaborated through scriptural citation:
- Blue unchanging from appearance
- Five colors clear light
- This itself greatly clarifies
- Self front upper space
- Four finger-widths or body-height
- Transcending separation from body
- That becomes the measure
The *rang shar* citation (16960-16982) describes the arising and vision process:
- Appearance arising and self great wisdom examining
- Ye shes appearance kaya and ye shes directionless arising
- Arising manner thus:
- First: merely mirror mandala
- From that: appearance portions arise
- From that: land-area arise
- From that: sky-filling arise
- Whatever appears light mandala
- Arising, seeing form kaya time
- All kaya mandalas from self-arise, self-emanate
- Sky-filling appearances
- Seeing dharmata not ceasing
- Ye shes sky movement sign
- Nature itself appearance
- Essence itself kaya arising
- Arising that itself self is
- Buddha intent valid dharma
- True thusness thus-gone
- That shown as familiarization measure
[16983-17007] [PHILOLOGY] Abode (*gnas*) and Door (*sgo*):
- Ground's sphere: cit
- Path's sphere: *'bri gu ta* (bridge-channel)
- Fruition sphere: cloud-free sky
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (16988-17007) establishes:
- Eye without arising condition
- Abiding, self-awareness itself appears as snake-noose
- Cloud-free sky holding
- Self-knowing inner clear time
- Abides in cit's center
- Outer-projection cloud-free sky
- Eye consciousness pure
- Clarifying blazing five light rays
- Unchanging pervading manner
- Blue great self-resound abides
- This arises from eye
- Unchanging pervading manner appears
- This appearance self-pure
- Sphere and awareness union
- Primordially abides, resting meditation
- Self-arising self activity-field
---
**Summary:** Page 403 completes the measure, abode, and door topics of the third lamp. The extensive scriptural citations from *gsang ba spyod pa*, *sgron ma 'bar ba*, and *rang shar* provide authoritative correlations between visionary measurements and resultant states.
[17008-17062] [STRUCTURE] # Actual Lamp and Simile Sections
**Analysis:** Longchenpa completes the third lamp's eleven-topic analysis with:
- Tenth topic: Actual (*dngos*)
- Eleventh topic: Simile (*mthun dpe*)
[17013-17046] [CONCEPT] The Actual Lamp (*dbyings kyi sgron ma dngos*):
The lamp actually arises from both eye corners, blue pervading great light, limitless. Inside, awareness-light abides in that house. Outside, snake-noose bindu empty with that fence abides. The five lights' appearance and rim's fence—both are the actual sphere.
Four non-affirming characteristics (*gnad bzhi*):
1. Without coarse entity (*dngos po rag par med*): not established as grasped object
2. Not severed emptiness (*chad pa phyang chad*): self-luminous like rainbow
3. Unharmed by elements (*'byung ba'i gnod pas mi shigs*): not compounded samsara
4. Possessing vital point (*gnad dang ldan*): seeing and familiarizing leads to primordial buddhahood
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17024-17046) establishes these characteristics through verses on vital points, suitable persons, samsara's upper space, entry from two corners, method and wisdom nature, ignorance as one finger, day-time element condition, night-time blue face conjoining, sphere's nature light house, unchanging great self-resound, buddhas and beings all, none made by anyone, primordially nondual equal abiding, from subtle abides, self-cognition arises, manifestly that greatly secret, great secret this itself, who wishes to practice, buddhahood even in primordial buddhahood.
[17047-17062] [CONCEPT] The Simile: Na-ro bird letter (*yi ge na ro*):
The simile compares the sphere lamp to the Tibetan letter na-ro (ནྲོ): two wings gathered as one bird-form. Similarly, outer blue sphere and appearance arising from it gathered together are called sphere lamp as one.
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17053-17062) provides the scriptural basis:
- Example like letter na-ro
- Two grasped and gathered as one
- Black changed, able to transform
- From that familiarization confidence obtained
- Intermediate space rainbow like
- Color unmixed completely perfect
- Then also familiarization power
- Possessing that sign
- Intermediate realm likewise thus
[17063-17071] [STRUCTURE] # Fourth Lamp Introduction: shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma
**Analysis:** Longchenpa inaugurates the fourth lamp: The Lamp of Self-Arising Wisdom (*shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*). The structural schema presents eight topics:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
5. sgo (door)
6. gnas (abode)
7. tshad (measure)
8. mthun dpe (simile)
This reduced topic count (eight vs. eleven) indicates a shift toward the most subtle and self-recognized dimension of the four lamps.
[17072-17087] [CONCEPT] Essence of Self-Arising Wisdom:
The essence is all lamps' object-knower, intent dharmata empty-luminous self-abiding, knowing with power. Through method-distance water lamp, bindu, sphere three unmoving gazing: inside self-awareness clarity-emptiness half-pure self-abiding, expanse rolling knowing with awareness.
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17079-17087) establishes:
- Self-arising wisdom lamp thus
- All lamps' object-knower abiding
- All's parts this itself
- Discriminating wisdom itself
- Abiding without discriminating manner
- Subtle part arising essence
- Primordially thus abiding
---
**Summary:** Page 404 completes the third lamp with the actual lamp description and na-ro simile, then inaugurates the fourth lamp with its essence definition. The progression moves from spatial-expansive sphere to self-recognized wisdom as the culmination of the four-lamp system.
[17088-17122] [PHILOLOGY] Etymological analysis of *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*:
- *shes rab* (wisdom/prajñā): From *nang du rang gnas lhun grub kyi dgongs pa shes dus* (when knowing the self-abiding spontaneous intent within)
- *rang byung* (self-arising): Not found by seeking, obtained from self; arising without cessation; wisdom knows dharmas clearly
- *rab* (supreme): Intent difficult to realize by others, obtained from self without searching, supreme peak
- *rang* (self): Jewel existing primordially in self found
- *byung* (arisen): Self-arisen without cessation
- *sgron ma* (lamp): Dharmas clearly known
- *ma* (mother/suffix): Self-appearance self-face known, pervading knowing
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17098-17115) provides extensive analysis:
- Knowing entity and non-entity
- All appearance greatly entered
- General meaning knowing
- Unsought placed confidence obtained
- Self ye shes measures known
- Nature pure dharmakaya
- Unobtained by three, self-known
- Superior appearing greatly
- Others' analysis place nonexistent
- Self-arisen primordially pure object
- Not others' object, called self
- Without doing, this meaning not obtained
- Without hope for anyone
- Primordially self-arisen called arisen
- Lamp dharmata all
- Nondual appearance makes
- Ma: self-face pervading knowing
[17116-17122] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig phreng ba*:
"Example like butter-lamp / Knowing all dharmas instantaneously / Supreme becomes all's peak / Self other-dependency dharma free / Arisen unblocked freely appears."
This establishes the butter-lamp (*sgron me*) simile for wisdom's illuminating function.
[17123-17157] [CONCEPT] Fivefold classification (*dbye ba*) of Self-Arising Wisdom:
1. *gzhi gnas rang byung gi shes rab* (Ground-abiding self-arising wisdom): Rigpa's knowing aspect, arising basis and support
2. *snang ba cer 'dzin gyi shes rab* (Appearance-directly-holding wisdom): Sphere-awareness nondual union, self-time self-clear, stainless purity, intent delivers to dharmata
3. *dran pa 'gag med kyi shes rab* (Memory-unceasing wisdom): Arising marks none, yet arising, liberated self-face dharmata unified gathering
4. *so sor rtog pa'i shes rab* (Individually-discriminating wisdom): Dharma and dharma-possessor, self and general marks, characteristics, etc., unmixed appearance knowing
5. *'jug byed rnam gsum gyi shes rab* (Three-entrance wisdom): In natural bardo, hearing establishes, thinking decides, meditation tastes experience, definitely extracts from samsara, word-meaning realized
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17140-17157) authenticates:
- Classification fivefold
- Ground-abiding self-arising wisdom makes body etc. dharmas' supports
- Appearance-holding wisdom holds sphere-awareness union
- Unceasing memory wisdom gathers one-pointed knowing objects
- Individually-discriminating wisdom discriminates general and self marks
- Three-entrance wisdom establishes in natural bardo
[17158-17163] [CONTEXT] Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*):
The characteristic is knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and dharmas gathered by object-awareness rigpa as natureless.
Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17156-17159) and *sdud pa* (17160-17163):
- Appearing and non-appearing all dharmas / natureless who knows / this is that characteristic
- Dharmas natureless transformed / this called prajñāpāramitā supreme
[17164-17178] [CONCEPT] Door of arising (*'char byed kyi sgo*):
The five faculties (*dbang po lnga*) are the door because sense-faculties measure objects as wisdom, that being the door.
Particularly, nose memory wisdom wind (*shes rab kyi rta me rlung*) moving is that itself. Fire-wind wisdom's resound like fire sparks, night-time yawn occurring, arises thus known.
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17169-17178):
- Arising door five faculties
- Particularly from nose arises
- That sign night time
- Yawn and fierce yawn
- Very fierce yawn body time
- Red resounding light rays
- Like fire sparks spreading
- That measure and sign
- Arising door recognized
---
**Summary:** Page 405 provides the definition, fivefold classification, characteristic, and door of the fourth lamp. The analysis reveals self-arising wisdom as the self-recognized knowing that integrates all prior lamps through nondual sphere-awareness union.
[17179-17213] [CONCEPT] Abode (*gnas*) of Self-Arising Wisdom:
The abode is cit's four great channels' root, rigpa's self-resound wind held, not outer-projected, inner self-abiding mere unclear, from action wind outer power moved, objects rigpa arise.
Also, abiding in name-basis gathering's self-resound:
- Element (*'byung ba*)
- Knowing (*shes pa*)
- Ye shes rigpa four's self-resound
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17187-17213):
- Arising four channels from
- Shaking, moving, vibrating
- Fire sparks upward characteristic
- Wisdom from
- Knowing clear-clear knowing
- Wisdoms' nature
- Ro ma rkyang ma all vibrating
- Crystal cave hollow inside
- Great clarifying wisdom abides
- Four names gathering self-resound
- All discriminating essence
- Primordially body's parts abides
- Occasionally wind self-held
- Knowing memoryless thick even
- Wisdom powers expand-contract
- Clear part none, thick becomes
- Self wisdom power moved time
- Previous unheard dharmas also
- Mind memory clear arises
- Clear and unclear powers
- Wind's movement itself from arises
- Body center channel inside abides
[17214-17285] [STRUCTURE] # Measure (*tshad*) of Self-Arising Wisdom
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents measures for each of the five wisdoms:
1. **Ground-abiding wisdom measure:** Abiding in equal intent's warmth measure
2. **Appearance-holding wisdom measure:** Sphere-awareness mixed, knowing and self-power obtained
3. **Unceasing memory wisdom measure:** Arising-liberation marks none, gathering-dispersal exhausted, abiding in ease spontaneous intent, conditions cannot steal rigpa
4. **Individually-discriminating wisdom measure:** Two-possessing dharmas individually divided, established
5. **Three-entrance wisdom measure:** Word-meaning realized, meaning self-face abides
The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17225-17285) provides extensive measures:
- Ground-abiding self-arising measure
- All dharmas equal experience arises
- Knowing stable confidence obtained
- That itself unchanging
- Always continuum abides
- This ground-abiding wisdom finished
- This body also light
- Knowings clear

---
**Summary:** Page 406 details the abode and extensive measures of self-arising wisdom. The five wisdom measures provide progressive indicators of stabilization in the lamp's recognition.
[17286-17302] [CONCEPT] Simile (*mthun dpe*) and Section Completion:
The simile is like tinder (*spra ba*)—whatever object is seen is known and realized, all afflictions burned. The butter-lamp fire blazes.
Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17290-17295) and *sdud pa* (17296-17299):
- Example like tinder moisture-free
- Fire sparks subtle even meet
- Tinder all blaze fire burning
- Wisdom burns latencies
- These all wisdom lamp
- Wisdom dharmas' nature completely knowing
- Three realms mother-free truly transcends
[17300-17306] [STRUCTURE] # Major Rim Khang: Four Lamps Classification
**Analysis:** Longchenpa concludes the thirteenth major section (*rim khang bcu gsum pa*): The Classification of the Four Lamps. The text marks this as the conclusion (*ste*) of the four-lamps presentation and prepares to transition to the second major division: establishing the nature of knowing supported by that body.
The transition formula (*de ltar...de ni*) marks the structural shift from supporting base (*rten*) to supported cognition (*brten pa shes pa*).
[17303-17306] [STRUCTURE] # Second Major Division: Supported Cognition
**Analysis:** The three topics of establishing the nature of knowing supported by that body:
1. Alaya (*kun gzhi*) and dharmakaya (*chos sku*) distinction
2. Mind (*sems*) and wisdom (*ye shes*) distinction
3. Distinct dharmas analysis
[17307-17313] [CONCEPT] First Topic: Alaya-Dharmakaya Distinction
Brief presentation (*mdor bstan pa*):
- Sentient beings' basis and buddhas' basis considered: rigpa's essence ka dag stainless
- Stained with marigpa (*ma rig pa*), conceptualization (*rtog tshogs*)—becomes all delusion-appearance, delusion-holder's basis
- Thus alaya and dharmakaya two aspects
The *thal 'gyur* citation (17315-17316): "Alaya and dharmakaya's vital point."
[17317-17334] [CONCEPT] Alaya (*kun gzhi*) defined:
- Made distinct by ignorance (*ma rig pas khyad par du byas pa*)
- Mind and mental factors' first support, middle abode, final home
- Latencies' vessel, like a pond (*rdzing*)
Dharmakaya (*chos sku*) defined:
- Made distinct by ignorance reversed (*ma rig pa log pas*)
- Beyond mind and mental factors' objects
- Pure from all action and latencies
Alaya:
- Under-barrel spread basis of various appearances
- Various objects appear in lung
- Object-possessors, six ignorance, three realms essence appear
- That body, happiness-suffering, mind's delusion parts many held
Dharmakaya:
- All these nonexistent
- Not abiding together with mind etc.
The *rang shar* citation (17335-17339):
- Alaya conceptualization holder
- Various delusion knowing stained
- Alaya ignorance entity is
- Alaya called that
And (17341-17343):
- Sentient being basis and buddha basis
- One distinction divided certainly
[17344-17360] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig phreng ba*:
- Alaya accumulation's cause
- Dharmakaya outflow exhausted
- Empty clear and clear pervading
- Contemplation unstained memory-clear
- Elaboration itself free
- Sky-like pervading empty
- Self-pure all free
- Cause and condition with alaya
- Latencies etc. like pond
- Dharmakaya latencies free
- Mind and sems etc. gathering
- Embodied alaya various appears
- Dharmakaya mind etc. free
- Various form-appearance body nonexistent
[17361-17374] [CONTEXT] Citation from *kun tu bzang po klong drug pa'i rgyud*:
- Hey mahasattva
- Mind's abode is alaya
- Why? Alaya gathers all contemplation objects, known as mind
- Ye shes's abode is dharmakaya
- Why? Dharmakaya lacks all memory-conceptualization, no different-object-holding knowing
---
**Summary:** Page 407 completes the fourth lamp with its simile, concludes the four-lamps section, and inaugurates the second major division on supported cognition. The alaya-dharmakaya distinction establishes the fundamental ground for understanding samsara-nirvana differentiation.
[17375-17406] [CONTEXT] Polemical Analysis: Alaya as Dharmakaya?
**Analysis:** Longchenpa addresses the erroneous view (*'dod pa*) that identifies alaya with dharmakaya. This view has proponents among:
1. Common treatises (*thun mong gi bstan bcos*): Alaya as support of pure-impure all; dharmakaya as pure's stainless thusness
2. Some mantra practitioners (*sngags kha cig*): Alaya transformed abode becomes dharmadhatu wisdom, essence body
Scriptural citations used to support this view:
- "Alaya is all's basis / nirvana's basis mother also is"
- "Alaya transformed abode is dharmadhatu wisdom, essence body"
[17387-17406] [CONCEPT] Logical Refutation (*gnod pa*):
If alaya were dharmakaya, two absurd consequences (*thal ba*) follow:
1. Dharmakaya would be stained (*dri ma can du thal*)
2. Alaya producing container-world delusion would mean dharmakaya produces delusion
Further absurdity: If accepted, buddhas would again become sentient beings (*sangs rgyas nas slar sems can du 'khrul par thal ba*)
Scriptural refutations (*lung gis gnod*):
- *kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long*: "Considering alaya as dharmakaya is deviating from me"
- *rig pa rang shar*: "Some consider alaya as dharmakaya / To give answer, teaching established / Alaya's characteristic thus / Then that spoke answer / All complete therefore alaya / From that all complete / Buddha becoming sentient being reason / Why all complete / Intermittent possessor becomes / Why various arises / Sometimes buddha becomes / Sometimes sentient being becomes / Why definite abiding / Then asked words reversed / Then if alaya nonexistent / Then asked answer given / Alaya conceptualization holder / Various delusion knowing stained / Alaya ignorance entity is"
[17420-17447] [CONCEPT] Essential Distinction (*dbye dgos*) and Simile:
The distinction is essential. From *klong drug pa*: "Therefore alaya and dharmakaya not distinguished: like form one different-holding knowing, cannot appear objects individually."
Simile: Ocean and boat (*rgya mtsho dang gru*):
- Dharmakaya: Like pure ocean, rigpa unstained never experienced stain, sphere ocean clear, nowhere established, nowhere not arising, door not ceased, primordial field nature pure, adventitious stain separated, that sphere force-place obtained, pure twofold-possessing part
- Alaya: Like boat on ocean not dissolved, when deluded from primordial sphere, ground ignorance all's support, pervader, essence abiding boat-like, mind mental factors action latencies delusion many filled
The *rang shar* citation (17436-17439):
- Alaya and dharmakaya's example
- Ocean and boat's manner path-arisen
- Sleep and waking manner
- Faculty distinction possessing
[17440-17447] [CONCEPT] Fundamental Asymmetry:
Rigpa unstained dharmakaya's essence at all times not reversing, exists as final liberation basis. Alaya like sleep, delusion-appearance all dreams' basis became, must be awakened from—distinction extremely great.
Sleep and dream must be reversed; self-rigpa need not be reversed. Dharmakaya is basis to be recognized; familiarized in that state; fruition liberation place identified. Alaya and dependent dharmas are to be purified stains.

**Summary:** Page 408 presents Longchenpa's refutation of the alaya-dharmakaya identity view, using logical consequences and scriptural citations. The ocean-boat simile illustrates the fundamental asymmetry between the unstained ground and the deluded support.
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation (*rgyas par bshad pa*) in two sections:
1. Alaya expanded explanation
2. Dharmakaya expanded explanation
**Alaya Structure (17451-17476):**
From *thal 'gyur*:
- Alaya and dharmakaya vital point
- Alaya briefly explained
- Dharmas and non-dharmas all's basis
- Essence word distinction with
- Essence latencies vessel
- Classification: body, connection, various, primordial basis
Fivefold analysis of alaya:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*): Compounded virtue, samsara dharmas, latencies with, vessel
2. Definition (*nges tshig*): All-pervading (*kun mang*), gathered, many's time-place or support basis abiding
3. Classification (*dbye ba*):
- *ye don gyi kun gzhi* (Primordial meaning alaya)
- *sbyor ba don gyi kun gzhi* (Connection meaning alaya)
- *bag chags lus kyi kun gzhi* (Latency body alaya)
- *bag chags sna tshogs pa'i kun gzhi* (Latency various alaya)
1. **Primordial meaning alaya**: Samsara dharmas all's sphere first basis; investigating doer first movement rigpa considering, coeminent ignorance, from reversal spoken
2. **Connection meaning alaya**: That knowing itself self ignorance, samsara connection; knowing, nirvana connection aspect spoken
3. **Latency body alaya**: Root knowing itself body latencies possessing; flesh, blood, light, mind-body arising aspect spoken
4. **Latency various alaya**: That knowing itself impure action latencies source, all's basis making aspect spoken
Though four names, one knowing's aspect four distinctions turned, labeled.
From first movement until now, all knowing's support alaya, dependent aggregates eight abiding; individually distinguished, root samsara basis-opening arising basis: primordial meaning and samsara-nirvana connection; body appearing as body; mind latencies dependent alaya basis established. That time knowing's aspect outer-inner not severed, alaya consciousness labeled.
From that, five faculties' respective knowing concept-free five objects holding aspect: five sense-consciousnesses (*sgo lnga'i rnam shes*) labeled.
That time concept-investigation inward-looking realization first that met, mind knowing (*yid shes*), investigating distinguishes specifically holding, object as desired—one mind different aspects known.
Functions (*byed las*):
- Primordial delusion basis makes
- Connection body-mind linked happiness-suffering all-connection makes
- Body body and that aggregates many conditions makes
- Latencies action and afflictions maturation cause-condition makes
Names-entry reasons (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*):
- Latencies prior-later intermediate
- Action karmic result five outer connection
- Cause-result joining
- All-connection binding makes
- Therefore "kun gzhi" word entry

**Summary:** Page 409 provides the expanded explanation of alaya with its fivefold analysis (essence, definition, classification, function, name-entry). The four alayas map different aspects of the deluded basis across ground, connection, body, and latencies.
