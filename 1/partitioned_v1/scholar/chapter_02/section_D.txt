[1293-1294] [PHILOLOGY] Classification Summary: Asuras
**Analysis:**
**Reclassification:** The demon class (*bdud ris*) is included in the god class (*lha ris su bsdus nas*), leaving only four titan classes (*lha min ris bzhi*).
**Doxographical Note:** This reflects the standard Buddhist classification where asuras can be counted as either:
- A separate sixth realm (making seven total)
- Part of the god realm (maintaining six realms)
- Part of the animal or preta realms in some traditions
**Lifespan Reference:** The Thirty-three gods' lifespan is used as the comparative standard.
[1295-1302] [CONTEXT] The Origin of Humanity on Jambudvīpa
**Analysis:**
**Setting:** *'dzam bu'i gling bsod nams khyad par can gyi sa pa* — The excellent merit ground of Jambu continent
**First Humans:** Two god-sons from clear light (*'od gsal las lha'i bu gnyis*) born miraculously (*rdzus skyes*) from lotuses.
**Names:**
- *nyi ma rab tu snang byed* — Sun Greatly-Illuminating
- *zla ba dri med* — Moon Stainless
**Arising Process:**
1. After formation of beings up to Four Great Kings
2. Two god-sons fall from clear light to Jambudvīpa
3. Upon immeasurable lotuses of beautiful light-appearance
4. Their minds greatly moved (*yid rab tu g.yos pa*)
5. Space-seed parts manifest as condition
6. Miraculous birth god-sons expand
**Dzogchen Connection:** This narrative parallels Dzogchen cosmogony where beings arise from the clear light nature of mind (*'od gsal*) through spontaneous display.
[1303-1309] [CONCEPT] The Golden Age: Primordial Human Abilities
**Analysis:**
**Extraordinary Powers of Primordial Humans:**
1. **Transportation:**
- Go through sky when traveling
- Sit in sky when dwelling
- *'gro na yang nam mkha' la 'gro* / *'dug na yang nam mkha' la 'dug*
2. **Nourishment:**
- Food is meditation (*bsam gtan*)
- Dwell in joy-bliss (*dga' bde la spyod*)
3. **Radiance:**
- Body extends immeasurable light rays (*'od zer gyi tshogs dpag tu med pa 'phro*)
4. **Teletransportation:**
- Arrive wherever merely thought (*gang du bsam pa der phyin*)
5. **Lifespan:**
- Immeasurable years (*tshe lo yang dpag med thub*)
6. **Purity:**
- No afflictions manifestly move (*nyon mongs pa mngon du rgyu gang yang med pa*)
**Philosophical Significance:** This "golden age" description represents humanity in its primordial purity before the decline into coarse material existence—analogous to the Dzogchen concept of primordial purity (*ka dag*).
[1310-1315] [CONTEXT] Resolving Variant Accounts
**Analysis:**
**Variant Sources:**
- Some tantras (*rgyud 'ga' las*) say humans expanded from Joy Possess (*dga' ldan*)
- Some (*la la nas*) say from Four Great Kings (*rgyal chen bzhi*)
**Longchenpa's Resolution:**
- The two first chiefs (*thogs ma'i gtso bo de gnyis*) fell from clear light
- Below them, [beings fell from] Joy Possess, Four Great Kings, and other upper [realms]
- All miraculously born here (*'dir rdzus te skyes pa*)
**Hermeneutical Principle:** All views are non-contradictory (*thams cad kyi ltar 'gal ba med par*) because beings fell from multiple upper realms at different times.
[1316-1319] [PHILOLOGY] The Name: Joy Possess Pile (*dga' ldan brtsegs pa*)
**Analysis:**
**Place Name:** *dga' ldan brtsegs pa* (Tuṣita Pile/Mound)
**Etymological Explanation:**
- *snang ba 'od kyi longs spyod bsam gyis mi khyab pa* — Inconceivable light-appearance enjoyment
- *rig pa ting nge 'dzin gyi dga' bde dpag tu med pa* — Immeasurable awareness-concentration joy-bliss
**Grammar Note:** *brtsegs pa* (pile/mound/accumulation) indicates abundance and layered excellence.
**Doxographical Connection:** This connects to the heaven called Tuṣita (*dga' ldan*) mentioned earlier, suggesting the first human realm mirrored the divine realm in its qualities.
[1320] [STRUCTURE] Introduction of the Teacher
**Analysis:**
**The Sixth Teacher:** *ston pa drug pa* — The sixth in the series of cosmic teachers
**Identity:** *rdo rje 'chang nyid* — Vajra Holder (Vajradhara) himself
**Function:** *'gro ba de dag 'dul ba* — Taming/disciplining those beings
**Buddhist Cosmology Context:** In Buddhist cosmology, there are typically "seven Buddhas of antiquity" or multiple teachers who appear in different world-cycles. Vajradhara as the sixth teacher represents the highest tantric enlightenment principle.
**Transition:** Having established the origin and golden age of humanity, Longchenpa will now describe the gradual decline into the present condition of human existence.
[1321-1324] [CONTEXT] The Teacher's Appearance: Vajradhara's Birth
**Analysis:**
**Setting:** *'od kyi pad+ma rab tu mdzes pa 'dab ma stong dang ldan pa* — Greatly beautiful light lotus with thousand petals
**Manner of Birth:** *sbubs yangs shing rgya che la rdzus nas skye ba'i tshul du byon* — Came in miraculous birth manner to wide large cavity
**The Three Gazes (*gzigs stangs rnam pa gsum*):**
The teacher gazes at beings with three forms of gaze, through which arise:
- Sun Greatly-Illuminating (*nyi ma rab tu snang byed*)
- Moon Without-Stain (*zla ba dri ma med pa*)
**Symbolic Significance:**
- Sun = *thabs* (Skillful Means)
- Moon = *shes rab* (Wisdom)
- Together = Union of means and wisdom (*thabs shes zung 'jug*)
This is the "sign of arising as teacher taming beings" (*'gro ba 'dul ba'i ston par byung ba'i rtags*).
[1325-1326] [PHILOLOGY] The Thousand Buddhas Prophecy
**Analysis:**
**Vision:** Upon each lotus petal (*pad+ma'i 'dab ma re re'i steng na*), one similar to Buddha and cause appeared.
**Prophecy:** *bskal pa 'di la sangs rgyas stong 'byung ba'i rtags* — Sign that 1,000 Buddhas will arise in this eon.
**Doxographical Context:** This refers to the "Fortunate Eon" (*bskal pa bzang po*) in which 1,000 Buddhas will appear, with Śākyamuni being the fourth.
[1327-1329] [CONTEXT] The Naming of Humanity
**Analysis:**
**Vision:** Through the "taming-appearance eye" (*snang ba 'dul byed kyi spyan*), gazing at the lotus:
**Omen:** From sky arose self-sound of hot and cold (*tsha grang gi rang sgra*).
**The Sound:** *mi snang mo* — "Not appear dark" sounded three times (*lan gsum du byung ba*).
**Result:** *'gro ba de dag kyang mi zhes bya bar thogs so* — Those beings seized the name "human" (*mi*).
**Etymological Play:** *mi* (human) is associated with *mi snang* (not appearing clearly), suggesting the obscured nature of human perception compared to divine clarity.
[1330-1332] [PHILOLOGY] The Androgynous Primordial Body
**Analysis:**
**Body Composition:**
- No coarse flesh-blood (*lus gdos bcas sha khrag tu grub pa ni med*)
- Occasionally relied on upper light (*skabs su gong ma'i 'od la brten pas*)
- Clearly appearing (*zang thal du snang*)
**Beautiful Features:**
- Five senses (*dbang po lnga*)
- Limbs (*yan lag*)
- Colors (*kha dog*)
- Āyatanas (*skye mched*)
**Critical Absence:** *pho dang mo zhes tha dad pa ni med do* — No differentiation as male and female.
**Dzogchen Significance:** This primordial androgyny represents the state before dualistic split, analogous to the non-dual nature of awareness (*rig pa*) in Dzogchen.
[1333-1335] [CONTEXT] Cosmic Omens: The Great Perfection Teachings
**Analysis:**
**First Omen:** 64 light stars (*'od kyi skar ma 'bum phrag drug cu rtsa bzhi*) appearing in sky
- **Prophecy:** 640,000 (*'bum phrag drug bcu rtsa bzhi*) Great Perfection (*rdzogs pa chen po*) dharma enumerations will arise
- **Timing:** Before-sign (*snga ltas*) = precursor/omen
**Second Omen:** 17 beautiful bright stars from within the 64
- **Prophecy:** 17 extremely secret supreme tantras (*yang gsang bla na med pa'i rgyud*) will arise
**Numerical Significance:** These numbers correspond to the vast corpus of Dzogchen teachings, establishing Longchenpa's tradition within the prophetic framework of cosmic history.
[1336-1337] [STRUCTURE] The First Teaching: Sound Thalgyur
**Analysis:**
**The Teacher's Vision:**
- *stong pa de nyid* — Emptiness itself
- *rnam pa thams cad mkhyen pa'i spyan* — All-knowing eye of awareness-form
- Gazing at teaching object (*gdul bya*) and showing/teaching
**The Teaching:** *sgra thal 'gyur rtsa ba'i rgyud chen po* — Great Root Tantra of Sound Thalgyur (Direct Transmission through Sound)
**Doxographical Note:** This is the first tantra taught in this world-cycle, establishing the Dzogchen lineage from the very beginning of human existence.
**Temporal Marker:** *bstan pa kun la snga ba* — Earliest of all teachings
[1338-1343] [PHILOLOGY] The Beginning of Decline
**Analysis:**
**Initial Conditions:**
- Life: Immeasurable years (*tshe lo dpag tu med*)
- Body: 32 cubits (*khru sum cu rtsa gnyis*)
**Progressive Degeneration (*rim gyis bri ba*):**
1. Population explosion: *'gro ba yang mang du 'phel* — Beings expand greatly
2. Lifespan decline: *tshe yang bags kyis bri* — Life gradually declines
3. Loss of radiance: *lus kyi 'od la sogs pa yang yal* — Body light fades
4. Merit exhaustion: *bsod nams kyang chung ngu song* — Merit becomes small
**Structural Transition:** Having established the golden age of humanity with Vajradhara's teaching, Longchenpa now sets up the narrative of gradual decline that will explain the current human condition—the basis for the need for Dharma practice.
[1344-1346] [PHILOLOGY] The Mechanism of Degeneration
**Analysis:**
**Causal Chain:**
- *sngon gyi las kyi dbang gis* — By power of previous action
- *nyon mongs pa bag la nyal langs te* — Afflictions' latency arose
- *dpal dang gzi brjid dman par gyur to* — Splendor and majesty became low
**Technical Terms:**
- *bag la nyal* (anusaya) — Latent tendencies dormant in the mindstream
- *langs te* — Arose/awakened (perfective, indicating completed action)
- *dbang* (power/influence) — Indicates karma's compulsive force
**Doxographical Context:** This reflects the standard Buddhist view that karmic maturation (*vipāka*) occurs when conditions ripen, causing cyclic existence to manifest.
[1345-1349] [CONTEXT] Human Expansion to the Four Continents
**Analysis:**
**Sequential Settlement:**
1. **Jambudvīpa** (*'dzam bu'i gling*) — First arisen, famous as "action ground" (*las kyi sa pa*)
2. **Pūrvavideha / Body-Elevated** (*shar gyi lus 'phags gling*) — East
- *lus 'phags* = Body-Elevated (Tibetan translation)
- Humans increased from gods via miraculous birth
3. **Uttarakuru / Sound-Not-Heard** (*byang gi sgra mi snyan*) — North
- *sgra mi snyan* = Sound-Not-Heard (Tibetan etymology)
4. **Aparagodānīya / Cow-Enjoyment** (*nub kyi ba glang spyod*) — West
- *ba glang spyod* = Cow-Enjoyment (Tibetan rendering)
**Cosmological Significance:** The directional expansion represents the universal nature of saṃsāric existence—human condition extends throughout the world-system.
[1350-1354] [STRUCTURE] The World-Endurable Epoch (*'jig rten mi mjed*)
**Analysis:**
**Etymology:** *'jig rten mi mjed* (World-Endurable/Trāyastriṃśa-like)
- Land name when life reached 100 million years (*bye ba* = 10 million)
**Characteristics:**
- Beings born from light eggs (*'od kyi sgo nga*)
- Light radiated 7 fathoms (*'dom bdun*)
- Could travel through sky (*nam mkha' la 'gro*)
- Food: elemental essence (*'byung ba'i dngas ma*)
- Naked but with good lakes for washing
**Virtue:** *rang bzhin gyis dge ba bcu la spyod pa* — Naturally engaged in ten virtues
**Golden Age Continuation:** Despite decline from primordial state, still maintains extraordinary qualities and natural virtue.
[1355-1358] [PHILOLOGY] The Heat-Moisture Gathered Epoch
**Analysis:**
**Name:** *drod gsher 'dus pa 'od gyis spungs pa* — Heat-Moisture Gathered Light-Gathered
**Degeneration Process:**
- *tshe yang bags kyis bri* — Life gradually decreases
- *'od dang bsod nams kyang nyams par gyur* — Light and merit also degenerated
**Mechanism of Birth Transformation:**
- Hot elements (*'byung ba tsha ba*) create heat
- Cool elements become cause and condition
- All beings born from tree sap heat-moisture (*shing gi zil pa las drod gsher skyes*)
**Lifespan:** 100,000 years (*'bum*)
**Material Culture:**
- Food: tree fruit (*ljon shing gi 'bras bu*)
- Clothes: good tree leaves (*shing lo bzang po*)
- One human birth per tree
[1360-1364] [CONTEXT] The Attachment-Arising Epoch
**Analysis:**
**Name:** *chags 'byung mngal du snang ba* — Attachment-Arising Womb-Appearance
**Lifespan:** 80,000 years (*brgyad khri*)
**Physiological Development:**
- *pho mo'i dbang po ni ma dod* — Male-female sense-powers not yet opened
- *gcig la gcig mthong na dga'* — Joy when seeing each other
- *reg na bde ba tsam* — Merely pleasure when touching
**Emergence of Sexuality:** The "opening" of male-female sense powers marks the arising of sexual differentiation and desire.
[1365-1369] [STRUCTURE] The Beginning of Affliction Manifestation
**Analysis:**
**Critical Transition:**
- *nyon mongs pa mngon du rgyu langs pa'i mgo btsugs te* — Beginning made of afflictions manifestly moving/arising
**Completion of Sexual Differentiation:**
- *las kyi dbang gis* — By power of action/karma
- *pho mo'i dbang po'i sgo dod pa tsam du gyur* — Male-female sense-power apertures merely opened
**Philosophical Significance:** This marks the transition from spontaneous birth to womb-birth, from androgynous to sexual, from natural virtue to conditions requiring discipline. The Buddha's teachings become necessary from this point onward.
**Dzogchen Parallel:** This narrative of decline mirrors the Dzogchen teaching that sentient beings have fallen from primordial awareness (*rig pa*) into dualistic consciousness (*sems*), requiring the path of liberation to return.
[1370-1371] [PHILOLOGY] The Arising of Sexual Desire and Womb Birth
**Analysis:**
**Three Desires:**
- *blta ba* — Looking
- *reg pa* — Touching
- *dgod pa* — Laughing/Smiling
- *'dod chags byung* — Desire arose
**Birth Transition:**
- *mngal nas skyes pa* — Womb-born (replacing spontaneous birth)
- Population explosion (*mang du 'phel*)
**Material Conditions:**
- Light merely self-clear (*'od rang gsal tsam*)
- Food and clothes from trees

- *sngar gyi yon tan rnams nub* — Previous qualities submerged
**Physical Deterioration:**
- Could no longer travel without touching earth (*sa la sor bzhis ma reg par 'gro*)
- Lost ability to fly/levitate
- Light became dim (*mog mog por song*)
- Form and youth no longer beautiful
**New Diet:**
- Earth's fat essence (*sa'i tshil zhag*)
- Honey-like taste
- Soft tree fiber for clothes
[1378-1379] [STRUCTURE] The Origin of Theft and Famine
**Analysis:**
**First Theft:**
- Someone stored earth essence (*sa zhag*) without taking only when needed
- Hoarded for days, months, years
- Others imitated, saying "good"
- Evening/night (*nub*) = beginning of concealment
**Consequence:**
- *mu ge dang mun pa'i dus* — Famine and darkness time
- Many years of suffering
- Karmic consequence of greed and hoarding
[1380-1386] [CONTEXT] The Origin of Sun and Moon
**Analysis:**
**Sun's Arising:**
- From beings' common merit (*'gro ba spyi mthun gyi bsod nams las*)
- Light arose in sky
- *nyi ma* (sun) etymology: benefit-doing near (*mnye bar phan 'dogs pa*)
- No concept of "near/far" before sun
**Night's Definition:**
- *de nub pa* — When sun sets
- Named "night" (*mtshan mo*)
**Moon's Arising:**
- From hope that darkness be cleared (*mun pa sangs par smon pa*)
- Similar to sun
- *zla ba* (moon) etymology: sits as companion (*zla bor 'dug*)
[1387-1391] [PHILOLOGY] The Waxing and Waning of the Moon
**Analysis:**
**Initial State:**
- Moon possessed heat throughout entire night
- Too hot for beings
**First Wish:**
- *bsil bar gyur cig* — May this become cool
- Heat disappeared, became cool
**Second Problem:**
- Some tormented by excessive coolness
- *ha cang bsil bas gdungs pa ma bzod* — Could not endure torment from very cool
**Second Wish:**
- *mi bsil bar gyur cig* — May this not be cool
- Result: Waxing and waning (*yar skye mar 'grib*)
**Cosmological Principle:** Celestial mechanics arise from collective karma and wishes of beings.
[1392] [CONTEXT] Self-Grown Grain Agriculture
**Analysis:**
**Agricultural Revolution:**
- *ma rmos rang 'khrungs* — Unplowed self-grown
- *sA lu* grain (a type of wild rice/millet)
- *zhing nang rngas nang skye* — Grows inside day-seed in field
- *nub rngas nub skye* — Evening-seed grows in evening
**Immediate Results:**
- Food available without cultivation

[1398-1402] [CONTEXT] The Origin of Property, Theft, and Social Decline
**Analysis:**
**Agricultural Crisis:**
- Storing grain (*gsog 'jog*) led to scarcity
- Seeds failed to grow (*ma skyes pa*)
**First Ego/Ownership:**
- *nga rgyal can* — Arrogant one claimed: "This is mine"
- *ris su bcad pa* — Divided boundaries
**Karmic Consequences:**
- Merit-depleted beings (*bsod nams chung ba*) had poor fields
- Theft arose (*gzhan la brkus pa*)
- Five poisons manifested: desire, hatred, delusion, pride, jealousy

[1413-1419] [PHILOLOGY] The Origin of Lower Realms from Human Karma
**Analysis:**
**Mechanism:** *mi'i rten la dug gsum gyi las bsags pa'i dbang gis* — By power of accumulated three-poison actions on human basis
**Hell Beings:**
- Intense hatred (*zhe sdang las lhag par bsags*) → First hell-being
- *thog mar mnar med pa'i gnas su gshin rje'i rgyal por skyes* — Born as Yama, king of death, in Avīci hell
**Retinue:**
- Birds, dogs, hell-guardians (*bya dang khyi dang dmyal srung*)
- Many beings experiencing hell-suffering directly
**Eight Hot Hells:** Complete enumeration
**Eight Cold Hells:** Peripheral to hot hells
**Doxographical Note:** Lower realms don't exist independently—they manifest from collective human karma as the world-system evolves.
[1420] [PHILOLOGY] Completion of Hell Enumeration
**Analysis:**
*nyi tshe nye 'khor ba dang bcas pa yang byung ngo* — Occasional and neighboring [hells] also arose.

**Animals:** *gti mug lhag pas dud 'gro* — Animals from excessive delusion
**Process:** *so sor smin zhing chags so* — Ripened individually and arose
**Doxographical Principle:** The three poisons correspond to three lower realms:
- Hatred → Hells
- Desire → Pretas
- Delusion → Animals
[1423-1432] [STRUCTURE] Lifespan Calculations for Hell Beings
**Analysis:**
**Yāma-soothed (Yāma) Hell:**
- 50 human years = 1 day for Four Great Kings
- 30 such days = 1 month
- 12 months = 1 year
- 500 such years = 1 day in Yāma
- Lifespan: 500 Yāma years
**Progressive Multiplication Pattern:**
| Hell | Human Years per Day | Lifespan |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| Yāma | 50 | 500 years |
| Black Line | 1,000 | 1,000 years |
| Crushing | 2,000 | 2,000 years |

| Great Screaming | 8,000 | 8,000 years |
| Heating | 16,000 | 16,000 years |
| Intense Heating | 500,000 | 500,000 years |
| Avīci | 1 eon | 1 eon |
**Suffering Duration:** *sdug bsngal rgyun ring po la spyod do* — Dwell in long continuous suffering
[1433-1443] [PHILOLOGY] The Eight Cold Hells
**Analysis:**
**Names:**
1. *chu bur can* — Bubble-possessing
2. *chu bur rdol ba can* — Bubble-bursting
3. *a chu zer ba* — "A-chu" cry
4. *kyi hud zer ba* — "Kyi-hud" cry
5. *so tham tham pa* — Teeth-chattering
6. *pad+ma ltar gas pa* — Split like lotus
7. *ut+pval ltar gas pa* — Split like utpala
8. *pad+ma chen po ltar gas pa* — Split like great lotus
**Lifespan Calculation:**
- Kosala sesame load (100 khal)
- Remove one seed every 100 years
- When all removed: lifespan of first cold hell ends
- Each subsequent hell: 20× longer
[1444-1446] [CONTEXT] Preta and Animal Lifespans
**Analysis:**
**Pretas:**
- 100 human years = 1 day
- Lifespan: 500 preta years
**Animals:** *gcig tu ma nges* — Not definite/consistent
**Exception:** Eight great nagas and similar can live one intermediate eon (*bar bskal re*)
**Pattern Recognition:** Lifespans correlate with karmic severity and realm subtlety.
[1447-1455] [STRUCTURE] The Three-thousand-fold World System
**Analysis:**
**Formation Eon Duration:** 20 intermediate eons (*bar bskal nyi shu*)
**World System Architecture:**
- 1,000 worlds with four continents, Meru, and Brahma realms = First Thousand (*stong dang po spyi phud*)
- 1,000 such groups = Second Thousand (*stong gnyis pa bar ma*)
- 1,000 second thousands = Great Three-thousand (*stong gsum gyi stong chen po*)
**Scale:** One hundred billion (*bye ba phrag brgya*) Merus etc.
[1447-1455] [PHILOLOGY] The Partitive Particle *las*
**Analysis:** The phrase *skad cig dar re nyin re tsam las mi thub pa* (cannot [survive] even a moment, instant, or day) uses the ablative *las* to indicate the minimal extent. This establishes a comparative: even the shortest temporal unit is too long for certain beings. The construction *de ltar na* (thus/in this way) introduces the cosmological calculation that follows.
[1447-1455] [CONTEXT] # Kalpa Cosmology in Buddhist Sources
**Analysis:** The *kalpa* (Tib. *bskal pa*) cosmology derives from:
- **Abhidharma:** *Abhidharmakośa* Book III
- **Sūtra:** *Brahmajāla Sutta*, *Aggañña Sutta*
- **Tantra:** *Kālacakra* system with modified calculations
- **Dzogchen:** *Man ngag lta ba'i phreng ba*
The "formation eon" (*bskal pa chags pa*) is one of four eon-types: formation, abiding, destruction, and great eon (containing the previous three).
[1448-1450] [CONCEPT] The Formation Eon and Avīci Hell
**Analysis:** The text establishes that the formation eon begins when the first being falls into Avīci hell (*mnar med*). This creates a stark juxtaposition: the beginning of cosmic formation coincides with the extreme of suffering. The phrase *sems can gcig dmyal ba'i sdug bsngal myong ba la skyes pa'i bar la chags pa'i bskal pa* (the formation eon [extends] until a being is born experiencing the suffering of hell) establishes the duration as contingent on the first sentient being's fall.
[1451-1453] [PHILOLOGY] The Hierarchical Particle *la*
**Analysis:** The construction *de stong la stong gnyis pa* (on that thousand, the second thousand) uses the locative *la* to indicate hierarchical levels. This creates a multiplicative structure: each level is "on" or "built upon" the previous. The genitive *gyi* in *stong gsum gyi stong chen po* creates a possessive relationship: the great thousand OF three thousand.
[1451-1453] [STRUCTURE] # The Three-thousand Structure
**Analysis:** The three-thousand system (*stong gsum*) represents:
- **One thousand worlds:** The basic unit (galaxy/cluster)
- **Second thousand:** A group of such clusters (supercluster)
- **Third thousand:** A universe (all superclusters)
This corresponds roughly to modern astronomy's:
- Solar system → Galaxy → Galaxy cluster → Observable universe
The scale "one hundred billion Merus" indicates that each world-system contains its own central mountain, supporting the model of multiple world-systems rather than a single universe.
[1454] [PHILOLOGY] The Locative *na* in Spatial Specification
**Analysis:** The phrase *'di na ri rab la sogs pa bye ba phrag brgya brgya gnas so* (here on Meru etc. one hundred billion abide) uses the locative *na* to specify location. The number *bye ba phrag brgya brgya* (one hundred billion = 100 × 100 × 10,000,000) follows the Indian large number system.
[1455-1459] [STRUCTURE] The Twenty Intermediate Eons of Abiding
**Analysis:**
**Three Sub-periods:**
1. *'grib pa gcig* — One decline
2. *'phel 'grib bco brgyad* — Eighteen increase-decreases
3. *'phel ba gcig* — One increase
**Decline Period:**
- Lifespan decreases 1 year every 200 years
- From immeasurable to 80,000 years
- Then 100 years per year until 10 years
**Increase Period:**
- Abandoning killing → 20 years
- Abandoning theft → 40 years
- Abandoning sexual misconduct → 100 years
- Abandoning lying → 200 years
- Abandoning slander → 500 years
- Abandoning harsh speech → 1,000 years
- Abandoning idle chatter → 2,000 years
- Abandoning covetousness → 4,000 years
- Abandoning ill will → 10,000 years
- Abandoning wrong view → 20,000 years
- Abandoning attachment to sense pleasures → 40,000 years
- Abandoning wrong practice → 80,000 years
**Correspondence:** Form and enjoyments increase/decrease with lifespan.
[1455-1459] [CONTEXT] # The Twenty Eons in Buddhist Cosmology
**Analysis:** The twenty intermediate eons (*bar bskal nyi shu*) constitute one "great eon" (*bskal pa chen po*):
- 4 eons of formation
- 4 eons of abiding
- 4 eons of destruction
- 4 eons of emptiness
- Plus transitional periods
This structure appears in *Abhidharmakośa* III.83-89 and is standard across Buddhist schools.
[1456-1478] [PHILOLOGY] The Distributive Particle *re re*
**Analysis:** The phrase *lo nyis brgya na re re 'bri* (decreases one every 200 years) uses *re re* (each/every) to indicate distributive iteration. The verb *'bri* (to decrease/decline) with the directional *yo* (downward implied) establishes the trajectory of degeneration. The instrumental *pas* in *spangs pas* indicates that abandoning [each fault] is the CAUSE of the corresponding lifespan increase.
[1456-1478] [CONCEPT] The Moral-Cosmic Correlation
**Analysis:** The text presents a strict correlation between ethics and cosmology:
- **Killing** (most serious) → 20 years
- **Wrong practice** (least serious) → 80,000 years
This reflects the Buddhist understanding of karma as both individual and collective: the morality of beings directly affects the physical environment. The phrase *g.yor zhing rgyas pa* (flourishing and expanding) indicates that as lifespan increases, material prosperity follows.
[1479-1495] [STRUCTURE] The Period of Abiding and Meritorious Manifestations
**Analysis:**
**Long Decline:** *ma thog ring mo* — The long stretch before final decline
**Merit-Based Manifestations:**
From beings' merit-appearance (*bsod nams kyi snang ba*):
- Happiness (*bde ba*), virtue (*dge ba*), Buddhas, Dharma, Sangha
- Pure white dharma enumerations
**Non-Merit Manifestations:**
- Suffering, wrong paths, wrong teachers, philosophical systems
- Karma, afflictions, six realms, four births
[1479-1495] [CONTEXT] # The Four Births in Buddhist Cosmology
**Analysis:** The "four births" (*skye ba bzhi*) refer to:
1. **Womb-born** (*jarāyuja*) — mammals, most humans
2. **Egg-born** (*aṇḍaja*) — birds, reptiles, fish
3. **Moisture-born** (*saṃsvedaja*) — insects, some worms
4. **Miraculous birth** (*upapāduka*) — gods, hell-beings, certain humans
These correspond to different karmic ripening levels distributed across the six realms of existence.
[1496-1512] [CONTEXT] The Twenty Eons of Destruction
**Analysis:** Structure: 19 eons destruction of essence (*bcud 'jig*), 1 eon destruction of container (*snod 'jig*). Detailed process: Lower realms empty as old beings die with no new births taking place; evil-doers migrate to other world-hells rather than being annihilated; humans decline to 10-year lifespan through gradual degeneration; disease/weapons/famine calamities arise as external signs of internal moral collapse; one being achieves second dhyāna and proclaims "joy of solitude-born bliss" to others; others follow and progress through dhyānas; gods from Four Great Kings to Brahma follow suit until complete destruction of sentient beings is achieved.
[1496-1512] [PHILOLOGY] The Verb *'jig* in Cosmological Context
**Analysis:** The term *'jig pa* (destruction) distinguishes between:
- *bcud 'jig pa* — destruction of essence (sentient beings)
- *snod 'jig pa* — destruction of container (environment)
This corresponds to the two truths: conventional destruction of beings who continue in other realms, and ultimate destruction of the world-system itself. The verb *thug* (to reach/arrive) in *dmyal ba'i gnas la thug pa* indicates spatial extent of destruction from hells to heavens.
[1496-1512] [CONCEPT] The Dhyānic Escalation
**Analysis:** Progressive evacuation based on meditative attainment:
- **Second dhyāna** allows beings to escape destruction entirely by transcending desire realm
- **Third dhyāna** placement survives wind destruction through deeper stability
- **Fourth dhyāna** placement survives all destruction types through complete equanimity
This establishes the protective function of samādhi—those with sufficient meditative stability transcend cosmic dissolution. The phrase *dben pa las skyes pa'i dga' ba* describes first dhyāna's characteristic bliss born of solitude, which serves as the gateway to higher absorptions.
[1513-1528] [STRUCTURE] The Seven Fires and Seven Waters
**Analysis:** Seven suns progressively destroy the world-system:
- First sun burns grass and trees
- Two suns dry rivers and ponds
- Three suns dry great rivers
- Four suns dry Lake Anavatapta
- Five suns dry great oceans
- Six suns dry earth with Mount Meru
- Seven suns burn millions of Merus
Range extends from golden ground of hell realms below to Brahma realms above, seven times burning completely until no ash remains (*thal ba tsam yang med*). Seven waters follow fire: arising from disturbed primordial waters below, reaching second dhyāna level seven times, dissolving everything like salt dissolving in water, including measureless palaces of the gods.
[1513-1528] [CONTEXT] # The Seven Suns Doctrine
**Analysis:** The seven suns (*sapta-sūrya*) narrative appears in major Buddhist sources:
- *Aṅguttara Nikāya* VII.66 (Pali)
- *Divyāvadāna* (Sanskrit)
- *Abhidharmakośa* III.97-100 (Vaibhāṣika)
- *Dà zhìdù lùn* (Chinese)
This represents one of three destruction types (fire, water, wind) cycling through different kalpas. The complete burning without residue establishes the ultimate insubstantiality of even the most solid realms—nothing persists eternally in conditioned existence.
[1513-1528] [PHILOLOGY] The Iterative Construction *shar bas*
**Analysis:** The repeated pattern *[number] shar bas* uses the perfective *bas* to indicate completed action. The enumeration progresses systematically through the hierarchy of elements: vegetation → small water → large water → special lake → oceans → earth → mountains. This creates a graded hierarchy of destruction where each successive sun affects more durable elements, demonstrating the progressive dissolution of form.
[1529-1538] [PHILOLOGY] Complete Destruction and Citation
**Analysis:** Wind destruction phase: Diamond-cross wind (*rlung rdo rje rgya gram*) arises from below, scatters everything to third dhyāna level, and the world-system becomes single sky/space (*nam mkha' gcig tu gyur*).
**Thalgyur Citation:**
"Arising, destruction, abiding, and emptiness
Birth, aging, sickness, and death
Are the wheel of existence's confusion"
**Kalpa Calculations:**
- 20 intermediate eons each for formation, abiding, destruction
- 80×60 = First duration kalpa
- 180×60 = Second intermediate kalpa
- Combined total = one great kalpa
[1529-1538] [CONCEPT] The Wind as Ultimate Dissolution
**Analysis:** The "diamond-cross wind" (*rdo rje rgya gram gyi rlung*) represents the most powerful destruction:
- **Fire** destroys up to first dhyāna (desire realm)
- **Water** destroys up to second dhyāna (lower form realm)
- **Wind** destroys up to third dhyāna (upper form realm)
- **Fourth dhyāna** survives all destruction types but eventually dissolves through karma exhaustion
The phrase *nam mkha' gcig tu gyur* indicates return to undifferentiated space, the ground from which future manifestation will again arise. This cyclic pattern demonstrates saṃsāra's endless nature.
[1529-1538] [CONTEXT] # The Thalgyur Citation
**Analysis:** The cited verse encapsulates core Dzogchen cosmology:
- **Four cosmic phases:** Arising (*chags*), destruction (*'jig*), abiding (*gnas*), emptiness (*stong*)
- **Four individual sufferings:** Birth (*skyed*), aging (*rga*), sickness (*na*), death ('*chi*)
- **One wheel:** Saṃsāra (*srid pa'i 'khrul 'khor*)
All phenomena—cosmic and individual—follow the same pattern of arising and dissolution. The wheel turns endlessly until recognition (*rig pa*) interrupts the cycle through awakening.
[1529-1538] [PHILOLOGY] The Particle *du 'dod*
**Analysis:** The phrase *bar bskal nyi shu brgyad cu la bskal chen gcig tu 'dod* (consider one great kalpa as 80 [plus] 20 intermediate eons) uses *du 'dod* (to consider/regard as) to indicate conventional designation. This establishes that kalpa-counts are pedagogical tools for training the mind, not objective measurements of time. The text emphasizes that these numbers serve to inspire urgency (*saṃvega*) rather than convey cosmological facts.
**Analysis:**
**First Duration Kalpa:**
- 80,000 years (peak lifespan)
- Multiplied by 60 = 4,800,000 years
- This is the "first duration" (*dang po'i tha ma*)
**Second Intermediate Kalpa:**
- 180 [units] × 60 = 10,800
- Represents the period of fluctuation
**Third Calculation:**
- Up to 10-year lifespan
- The "long decline" (*ma thog ring mo*) completion
**Minor Kalpa Cataclysms:**
- During the final decline to 10 years
- Three minor kalpa cataclysms:
1. Disease (*nad*)
2. Weapons (*mtshon*)
3. Famine (*mu ge*)
**Analysis:** The phrase *skyed rga na 'chi bzhi nang gi chags 'jig stong pa dang sbyar te* (connecting the four—birth, aging, sickness, death—with internal formation, destruction, and emptiness) uses *dang* to link two enumerations. The verb *sbyar* (to connect/join) establishes a correlation between microcosmic (individual) and macrocosmic (cosmic) processes.
**Analysis:** The text establishes homologies:
- **Birth** = Formation (*chags pa*)
- **Aging** = Abiding (*gnas pa*)
- **Sickness** = Destruction (*'jig pa*)
- **Death** = Emptiness (*stong pa*)
This reflects the tantric principle that the individual (*liṅga*) and cosmos (*aṇḍa*) are structured identically. Understanding one leads to understanding the other.
**Analysis:** The period when human lifespan reaches 10 years is characterized by:
- **Extreme degeneration:** Virtue nearly extinct
- **Cataclysms:** Disease, weapons, famine decimate population
- **Survival:** Only a few retreat to remote places
- **Renewal:** From this nadir, lifespan gradually increases again
This era precedes Maitreya's birth, when conditions will have improved to support a Buddha's appearance.
**Analysis:** The construction *ya thog ma thog par khug dang bcas pa nyi shu la* (including the anterior and posterior with the 20) uses *tsam* (only/merely) with *zhig* (a certain) to indicate a specific calculation. The phrase *ma 'grib kyi tha ma bcu pa la* (at the final 10 of non-decline) establishes a distinction between the gradual decline and the final period.
**Analysis:** The detailed kalpa calculations serve multiple functions:
1. **Cosmological:** Mapping the universe's temporal structure
2. **Ethical:** Demonstrating karma's long-term effects
3. **Soteriological:** Providing motivation for practice (escape the cycle)
4. **Contemplative:** Offering objects for meditation on impermanence
The phrase *bstan pa de dag gis 'dul ba'i lo grangs* (the years of taming taught by those teachings) indicates that all these numbers are pedagogical—designed to train (*'dul*) the mind rather than convey literal facts.
**Analysis:** The construction *bshad pa yin no* (is explained/taught) uses the past stem *bshad* with the existential *yin* to indicate definitive teaching. This verb choice distinguishes exposition from assertion: these are explanations (*bshad*), not claims about objective reality.
**Analysis:** The three cataclysms (*bskal chung gsum*) during the final decline:
1. **Disease (*nad*):** Epidemics decimate population
2. **Weapons (*mtshon*):** Warfare eliminates most humans
3. **Famine (*mu ge*):** Starvation completes the destruction
These are "minor" (*chung*) relative to the final destruction by fire/water/wind, but they accomplish the near-extinction of humanity.
**Analysis:** The phrase *bskal chung re yod la* (there is one [of each] minor kalpa) uses *re* (each/every) to distribute the three cataclysms across the final period. The locative *la* establishes the temporal framework: during the final decline.
**Analysis:** The overall structure—formation → abiding → destruction → emptiness—repeats endlessly:
- Each great kalpa (*bskal chen*) contains this cycle
- Countless kalpas have passed
- Countless kalpas will come
- Only awakening (*bodhi*) breaks the cycle
The text's detailed presentation serves to cultivate *saṃvega*—spiritual urgency regarding the preciousness of the present opportunity.
**Analysis:** The construction *bskal chung re yod la* uses the locative *la* to establish the temporal framework: during the final period of decline, each cataclysm manifests once.
