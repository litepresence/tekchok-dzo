[1532-1541] [STRUCTURE] # The Pure Kalpa Calculations
**Analysis:**
**First Duration Kalpa:**
- 80,000 years (peak lifespan)
- Multiplied by 60 = 4,800,000 years
- This is the "first duration" (*dang po'i tha ma*)
**Second Intermediate Kalpa:**
- 180 [units] × 60 = 10,800
- Represents the period of fluctuation
**Third Calculation:**
- Up to 10-year lifespan
- The "long decline" (*ma thog ring mo*) completion
**Minor Kalpa Cataclysms:**
- During the final decline to 10 years
- Three minor kalpa cataclysms:
1. Disease (*nad*)
2. Weapons (*mtshon*)
3. Famine (*mu ge*)
[1532-1541] [PHILOLOGY] The Particle *dang* in Enumeration
**Analysis:** The phrase *skyed rga na 'chi bzhi nang gi chags 'jig stong pa dang sbyar te* (connecting the four—birth, aging, sickness, death—with internal formation, destruction, and emptiness) uses *dang* to link two enumerations. The verb *sbyar* (to connect/join) establishes a correlation between microcosmic (individual) and macrocosmic (cosmic) processes.
[1532-1541] [CONCEPT] The Internal-External Correspondence
**Analysis:** The text establishes homologies:
- **Birth** = Formation (*chags pa*)
- **Aging** = Abiding (*gnas pa*)
- **Sickness** = Destruction (*'jig pa*)
- **Death** = Emptiness (*stong pa*)
This reflects the tantric principle that the individual (*liṅga*) and cosmos (*aṇḍa*) are structured identically. Understanding one leads to understanding the other.
[1539-1541] [CONTEXT] # The Ten-Year Lifespan Era
**Analysis:** The period when human lifespan reaches 10 years is characterized by:
- **Extreme degeneration:** Virtue nearly extinct
- **Cataclysms:** Disease, weapons, famine decimate population
- **Survival:** Only a few retreat to remote places
- **Renewal:** From this nadir, lifespan gradually increases again
This era precedes Maitreya's birth, when conditions will have improved to support a Buddha's appearance.
[1539-1541] [PHILOLOGY] The Emphatic Particle *tsam*
**Analysis:** The construction *ya thog ma thog par khug dang bcas pa nyi shu la* (including the anterior and posterior with the 20) uses *tsam* (only/merely) with *zhig* (a certain) to indicate a specific calculation. The phrase *ma 'grib kyi tha ma bcu pa la* (at the final 10 of non-decline) establishes a distinction between the gradual decline and the final period.
[1539-1541] [CONCEPT] The Kalpa as Pedagogical Construct
**Analysis:** The detailed kalpa calculations serve multiple functions:
1. **Cosmological:** Mapping the universe's temporal structure
2. **Ethical:** Demonstrating karma's long-term effects
3. **Soteriological:** Providing motivation for practice (escape the cycle)
4. **Contemplative:** Offering objects for meditation on impermanence
The phrase *bstan pa de dag gis 'dul ba'i lo grangs* (the years of taming taught by those teachings) indicates that all these numbers are pedagogical—designed to train (*'dul*) the mind rather than convey literal facts.
[1539-1541] [PHILOLOGY] The Verb *bshad*
**Analysis:** The construction *bshad pa yin no* (is explained/taught) uses the past stem *bshad* with the existential *yin* to indicate definitive teaching. This verb choice distinguishes exposition from assertion: these are explanations (*bshad*), not claims about objective reality.
[1539-1541] [CONTEXT] # The Three Minor Kalpa Cataclysms
**Analysis:** The three cataclysms (*bskal chung gsum*) during the final decline:
1. **Disease (*nad*):** Epidemics decimate population
2. **Weapons (*mtshon*):** Warfare eliminates most humans
3. **Famine (*mu ge*):** Starvation completes the destruction
These are "minor" (*chung*) relative to the final destruction by fire/water/wind, but they accomplish the near-extinction of humanity.
[1539-1541] [PHILOLOGY] The Enumerative *re*
**Analysis:** The phrase *bskal chung re yod la* (there is one [of each] minor kalpa) uses *re* (each/every) to distribute the three cataclysms across the final period. The locative *la* establishes the temporal framework: during the final decline.
[1539-1541] [CONCEPT] The Cyclic Nature of Saṃsāra
**Analysis:** The overall structure—formation → abiding → destruction → emptiness—repeats endlessly:
- Each great kalpa (*bskal chen*) contains this cycle
- Countless kalpas have passed
- Countless kalpas will come
- Only awakening (*bodhi*) breaks the cycle
The text's detailed presentation serves to cultivate *saṃvega*—spiritual urgency regarding the preciousness of the present opportunity.
[1539-1541] [PHILOLOGY] The Particle *la* as Temporal Framework
**Analysis:** The construction *bskal chung re yod la* uses the locative *la* to establish the temporal framework: during the final period of decline, each cataclysm manifests once.
[1542-1568] [STRUCTURE] Kalpa Calculations Summary
**Analysis:**
**Uncommon Vehicle System:**
- 60×60 equal measures = 180 = First duration kalpa (*yun gyi bskal pa dang po*)
- 180 such = Second intermediate kalpa (*bar gyi bskal pa gnyis pa*)
- 180 such = One great kalpa (*bskal pa chen po*)
**Thalgyur Citation Verse:**
"From first immeasurable to final ten,
Increase and decrease, disease, famine, weapons,
Three minor kalpas marking intervals,
Sixty abiding, then again
Seven by fire and seven by water,
Fourteen complete, then
Remainder destroyed by wind—
Thus sixty abiding,
Destruction duration also that much,
Between sixty, empty abiding,
Thus from 180,
First duration kalpa,
Thus 180,
Second intermediate kalpa,
Thus combined, that much
Is one great kalpa."

3. *skye mched* — Sense-bases
4. *dbang po* — Sense-powers
5. *yul dang yul can shes pa* — Objects and subject-consciousness
**Structural Significance:** Having established the cosmological framework (container/contained), Longchenpa now analyzes the constituent elements of existence—the building blocks of saṃsāric experience.
[1582-1586] [STRUCTURE] Fivefold Analysis Framework
**Analysis:**
**The Five Topics:**
1. *yul khams* — Object-elements
2. *rted phung po'i ring bzhin* — Aggregates as support
3. *rnam pa skye mched kyi khyad par* — Āyatana variations
4. *'dzin byed dbang po'i ngo bo* — Sense-power nature
5. *yul dang yul can gyi rnam pa* — Object-subject forms
**Opening:** *dang po ni* — First [topic]: Object-elements
[1587-1606] [PHILOLOGY] The Five Outer Elements
**Analysis:**
**Definition:** *mang zhing rgya che ba'i don gyis na khams* — Element (*dhatu*) means extensive and vast
**Two Divisions:**
1. *phyi yul gyis bsdus pa* — Outer object collection
2. *nang sems kyis bsdus pa* — Inner mind collection
**Five Outer Elements:**
| Element | Characteristic | Function |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Earth | Solid/hard (*sa zhing 'thas pa*) | Produces/bears form |
| Water | Moist/wet (*brlan zhing gsher ba*) | Ripens objects |
| Fire | Hot/burning (*tsha zhing bsreg pa*) | Condition of destruction |
| Wind | Moving/raising (*g yo zhing 'degs pa*) | Supports moving world |
| Space | Vast/opening (*yang zhing go 'byed*) | Holds sense-powers |
**Etymological Analysis:** Each element "holds" (*khams* from *'dzin*) its own nature and function.
[1607-1617] [CONTEXT] The Inner Elements: Container and Contained
**Analysis:**
**Bifurcation:**
- *snod* — Container (world)
- *bcud* — Contained (beings)
**Container:** Formed by accumulated karma (*las kyis bsags pa*), appearing as objects
**Two Types of Container-Appearance:**
1. *phyi yul snang* — Outer object-appearances
- From mind's confusion (*sems kyi 'khrul pa*)
- Like dreams (*rmi lam bzhin*)
2. *nang sems snang rtsal* — Inner mind-appearance-potency
- Spontaneously arisen by nature (*rang bzhin du shar ba*)
**Three Realm Objects:**
- Desire realm: Four continents etc.
- Form realm: Five self-clear lights, rainbow-like
- Formless: Self-emanated samādhi, invisible to others
**Source:** *nyi zla kha sbyor* — Sun-Moon Lip-Union Tantra
[1618-1622] [CONCEPT] Mind-Collection Elements
**Analysis:**
**Two Types:**
1. *snod kyi khams* — Container element: gathers sentient beings
2. *khams nyid* — Element itself: arisen from mind itself
**Container Element Arises From:**
- *dran pa gzhi che ba* — Great foundation of mindfulness/memory
- Produces form realm (*gzugs kyi khams*)
**Dzogchen Insight:** Even the "outer" physical elements are ultimately manifestations of mind's potency (*snang rtsal*), not independent material realities.
[1623-1624] [PHILOLOGY] Form and Formless Realms from Mindfulness
**Analysis:**
**Form Realm Element:**
- *dran pa yas pa* — Immeasurable mindfulness
- Produces form element (*gzugs kyi khams*)
**Formless Realm Element:**
- *dran pa gud du 'dzin pa* — Mindfulness grasping separately/distantly
- Produces desire realm element (*'dod pa'i khams*)
**Key Insight:** Different types of mindfulness/memory produce different realm-experiences.
[1625-1629] [CONCEPT] Spontaneous Arising from Awareness-Potency
**Analysis:**
**Core Mechanism:**
- *nang sems snang rtsal las rang bzhin du shar ba* — Inner mind-appearance-potency spontaneously arisen by nature
**The Process:**
1. *rig pa yod pa* — Awareness exists
2. *sgrib byed kyi rang rtsal ma rig pa* — Obscuring self-potency: ignorance
3. *kun gzhi* — All-ground (ālaya)
4. *kun gzhi rnam par shes pa* — All-ground consciousness
5. *yid dang dbang po sgo lnga'i shes pa* — Mind and five sense-powers' consciousness
**Simile:**
- Like golden ground (*gser gyi sa gzhi*) producing palm tree (*ta la'i ljon shing*)
- With branches, flowers, leaves spontaneously arising
- **No external cause needed** — everything arises from mind-nature
[1630-1642] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Analysis: Object, Sense, Feeling
**Analysis:**
**Three Categories:**
1. *yul* — Object
2. *dbang shes* — Sense-consciousness
3. *tshor ba gsum* — Three feelings
**Object (*yul*):**
- Previous (*sng llogs*) consciousness-potential (*shes pa tsam po*)
- Now designated (*btags pa*) as object
- Named through six supports (*dbang rten drug*)
- "Eye" etc. refer to consciousness, not physical organs
**Sense-Consciousness (*dbang shes*):**
- Present (*da ltar ba*) six consciousnesses
- Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind
**Feeling (*tshor ba*):**
- Future (*ma 'ongs pa*) aspect
- Six variations (*rnam pa drug*)
- Pleasant, painful, neutral
**Temporal Sequence:**
- Object = previous consciousness-continuum
- Sense-consciousness = present apprehension
- Feeling = subsequent experience
[1643-1652] [PHILOLOGY] The Eighteen Elements from Mind Itself
**Analysis:**
**Mechanism:** *yul dang shes pa 'dus pa las* — From object and consciousness gathering
- Produces feeling (*tshor ba*) in that form
- Called "contact feeling" (*'dus te reg pa'i tshor ba*)
**Eighteen Elements (*drug tshan gsum* = 6×3):**
From *sems nyid las byung ba'i khams* — Elements arisen from mind itself:
1. *shes pa rang gsal gyi cha* — Self-clear knowing portion → Eye element
2. *shes pa rtse gcig pa* — One-pointed knowing → Ear element
3. *shes pa mtha' yas pa* — Immeasurable knowing → Nose element
4. *shes pa rnams gcig tu 'dus pa* — Gathered-into-one knowing → Tongue element
5. *shes pa kun tu 'jug pa* — All-entering knowing → Mind element
6. *shes pa rnams kyi rten byed pa* — Support-doing for all knowing → Body element
**Dzogchen Synthesis:** All eighteen elements reduce to knowing/awareness (*shes pa/rig pa*) — nothing exists outside mind's nature.
[1653-1664] [PHILOLOGY] The Six Contact Elements from Mind-Nature
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa completes the presentation of the eighteen elements (*drug tshan gsum*), demonstrating how the six contact elements (*'dus te reg pa'i khams*) arise from the same mind-source as the preceding twelve sense-consciousness elements.
**Particle Analysis:**
- *'dzin pas na* (holding-by-means-of thus) — causal particle *pas* indicating the mechanism of element formation
- *sgrub pas na* (accomplishing-by-means-of thus) — the functional operation of each element
- *'dus te reg pa* (gathering-and-contacting) — the compound verb structure showing how contact emerges from the convergence of sense, object, and consciousness
**Key Insight:** Each of the six contact elements corresponds to the threefold gathering (*'dus pa gsum*):
1. Sense faculty (*dbang po*)
2. Object (*yul*)
3. Consciousness (*rnam shes*)
[1665-1666] [STRUCTURE] Summary: Elements as Object-Holding
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa synthesizes: *khams de dag rnams kyang yul 'dzin par byed pa yin no* — "these elements also accomplish the holding of objects." This reveals the functional unity underlying the apparent diversity of the eighteen elements.
The concluding statement *de yang 'khrul pa nyid nang du 'dzin pa'i cha las byung ba* establishes the epistemological grounding: all elements arise from the "part that holds within delusion itself" (*'khrul pa nyid nang du 'dzin pa'i cha*).
**Architectural Significance:** This completes the first major section on *khams* (elements), transitioning to *phung po* (aggregates).
[1667-1676] [CONCEPT] The Two-Fold Aggregate Classification
**Analysis:**
The text shifts to the second major category: *rten phung po* (basis-aggregates). Longchenpa establishes a fundamental bifurcation:
**Structure:**
1. *rtog pa dang bcas pa'i phung po* — Aggregates with thought (conceptual)
2. *rtog pa med pa'i phung po* — Aggregates without thought (non-conceptual)
**The Five Contaminated Aggregates (*zag bcas 'jig rten pa*):**
The presentation follows standard Abhidharma taxonomy, yet with Dzogchen hermeneutics:
1. **Form Aggregate (*gzugs kyi phung po*)**
- Definition: *gzhig cing gzhom du rung ba* — suitable for destruction/disintegration
- Philological note: *gzhig* (to break/destroy) implies impermanence (*mi rtag pa*) as intrinsic to form
2. **Feeling Aggregate (*tshor ba'i phung po*)**
- Definition: *myong zhing sred par gyur pa* — experiencing and becoming desire
- Key particle: *par gyur pa* (become-transformative) indicating the dynamic process where feeling ripens into craving
3. **Perception Aggregate (*'du shes kyi phung po*)**
- Definition: *g.yo zhing yul la 'jug pa* — moving and entering objects
- Analysis: *g.yo* (to move/flutter) captures the active, seeking nature of perception
4. **Formation Factors Aggregate (*'du byed kyi phung po*)**
- Definition: *byed cing bag chags sogs pa* — doing and including latencies
- Expansion: *sogs pa* indicates this aggregate encompasses all fifty-one mental factors (*sems byung*)
**Dzogchen Synthesis:** Even these "contaminated" aggregates will be reconceptualized as the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) when recognized as self-liberated.
[1677] [PHILOLOGY] The Fifth Aggregate: Consciousness
**Analysis:**
The consciousness aggregate (*rnam par shes pa'i phung po*) is defined as: *rig cing yul du byed pa* — "knowing and functioning with objects."
**Particle Breakdown:**
- *rig cing* — knowing-and (continuative gerundive)
- *yul du byed pa* — making-into-object (transformative)
This dual function—apprehension (*rig*) and objectification (*yul du byed*)—captures the essential operation of consciousness: simultaneously cognizing and constructing its referents.
[1678-1684] [CONCEPT] The Thought-Free Aggregates
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa presents the *rtog pa med pa'i phung po* (aggregates without thought) as the enlightened counterparts to the five contaminated aggregates. These are the aggregates of noble beings (*'phags pa*) who have transcended the world.
**The Five Pure Aggregates:**
1. **Concentration Aggregate (*ting nge 'dzin gyi phung po*)**
- *zhi gnas dang lhag mthong gi rang bzhin* — nature of calm-abiding and insight
- These are the twin wings of Buddhist meditation, here elevated to the aggregate level
2. **Wisdom Aggregate (*ye shes kyi phung po*)**
- *rang rang gi nyon mongs pa las grol ba* — liberated from individual afflictions
- Each of the five wisdoms liberates its corresponding affliction
3. **Wisdom Aggregate (*shes rab kyi phung po*)**
- *rang dang spyi'i rang bzhin gzigs pa* — seeing the nature of particular and universal
- Epistemological precision: *shes rab* (discriminating wisdom) cognizes both *rang mtshan* (specific characteristics) and *spyi mtshan* (general characteristics)
4. **Discipline Aggregate (*tshul khrims kyi phung po*)**
- *dri ma'i phyogs las rnam par dag pa* — completely pure from the direction of stains
- *Phyogs las* indicates directional transcendence—freedom from the entire dimension of defilement
5. **Complete Liberation Aggregate (*rnam par grol ba'i phung po*)**
- *spros pa dang rtog pa las grol ba* — liberated from elaboration and thought
- The culmination: freedom from both conceptual proliferation (*spros pa*) and discursive thinking (*rtog pa*)
[1685-1688] [CONTEXT] The Training Path vs. Non-Training
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa introduces a crucial distinction between:
- *slob lam gyis bsdus pa* — gathered by the training path
- *mi slob pa'i dus* — the time when one is not training
**Technical Point:** The aggregates on the training path are still "moistened" (*brlan pa*) by the aspect of what is to be abandoned (*spang bya'i phyogs*). Only at the non-training stage (*mi slob pa*) do they become fully pure.
**Ultimate Liberation:** When completely liberated (*gcig tu grol ba'i tshe*), even the name "aggregate" does not remain. This references *phung po dag las shin tu rnam par 'grol ba* — "completely liberated from aggregates" — from the *Angulimala Sutra* tradition.
[1689-1703] [STRUCTURE] The Sun-Moon-Union Classification
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa cites the *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon-Union Tantra) to provide a tantric framework for understanding the aggregates:
**Two-fold Classification:**
1. *rtog pas sbags pa'i phung po* — Aggregates obscured by thought
2. *rtog pa rnams rang bzhin gyis med pa'i phung po* — Aggregates naturally free from thought
**Obscured Aggregates (*rtog pas sbags pa*):**
The five contaminated aggregates arise from gathering (*'dus pa*):
- Form: from gathering all objects
- Feeling: from gathering all experiences
- Perception: from gathering all sense-holdings
- Formations: from gathering subtle afflictions
- Consciousness: from gathering all knowings
**Thought-Free Aggregates (*mi rtog pa'i phung po*):**
- Concentration: from gathering all concentrations
- Wisdom (liberation): since awareness itself is exhausted of outflows (*rig pa nyid zag pa zad pa*)
- Wisdom (discriminating): since that meaning appears without birth (*skye med*)
**Analysis:**
The text concludes the five thought-free aggregates (*rtog pa med pa'i phung po*):
4. **Discipline Aggregate (*tshul khrims kyi phung po*)** — *dri ma rnams mngon du dag pa'i phyir* — for the purpose of manifestly purifying stains
5. **Complete Liberation Aggregate (*rnam par grol ba'i phung po*)** — *rnam par rtog pa thams cad las 'das pa'i phyir* — for transcending all concepts
The particle *phyir* (for the purpose of) indicates teleological orientation—these aggregates function as means toward complete purification.
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa turns to the third major category: *rnam pa skye mched* (the distinctive characteristics of sense sources). The etymology is key: *gang zhig gang las skye zhing mched par gyur pas* — "that which arises from what and becomes expanded."
**The Twelvefold Structure:**
**Grasped Sense Sources (*gzung ba'i skye mched* — objects):**
1. Form (*gzugs*)
2. Sound (*sgra*)
3. Odor (*dri*)
4. Taste (*ro*)
5. Dharma (*chos*)
6. Touch (*reg*)
**Grasper Sense Sources (*'dzin pa'i skye mched* — faculties):**
1. Eye (*mig*)
2. Ear (*rna ba*)
3. Nose (*sna*)
4. Tongue (*lce*)
5. Mind (*yid*)
6. Body (*lus*)
**Temporal Analysis:**
- Object (*yul*) = previous moment (*sng llogs*)
- Sense-consciousness (*dbang shes*) = present moment (*da ltar ba*)
- Expansion (*mched pa*) = the arising process itself
The Sun-Moon-Union Tantra (*nyi zla kha sbyor*) provides the authoritative source for this twofold division.
**Analysis:**
**Etymology:** *yul 'dzin pa las dbang byed pas na dbang po* — "they are called faculties because they have power over grasping objects."
**Two-fold Classification:**
1. **Form Faculties (*gzugs can dang po'i cha las byung ba*)** — arising from the portion of form-possessing:
- Five sense faculties (*mig gi dbang po*, etc.)
- Mind faculty (*yid kyi dbang po*)
2. **Wisdom Faculties (*shes rab kyi cha las byung ba*)** — arising from the portion of wisdom:
- Faith (*dad pa*)
- Effort (*brtson 'grus*)
- Mindfulness (*dran pa*)
- Concentration (*ting nge 'dzin*)
- Wisdom (*shes rab*)
- Mental peace (*yid bde*)
This division maps onto the standard five (*pancha-indriya*) plus one (*yid bde*) from the Abhidharma-samuccaya tradition.
