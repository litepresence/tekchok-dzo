[916-918] [STRUCTURE] # Transition to the Six Realms (ṣaḍgatī)
**Analysis:** Having established the five perfections of the Buddha's appearance in our world-system, Longchenpa transitions to describing the cosmological framework within which sentient beings arise. This section delineates the six realms of saṃsāric existence.
**Architectural Logic:** The progression follows traditional abhidharmic structure: field (cosmos) → beings (content). The six realms are bifurcated into:
- Lower realms (*ngan song*): hells, pretas, animals
- Higher realms (*mtho ris*): demigods, gods, humans
This binary division reflects the fundamental saṃsāric dichotomy between severe suffering and relative pleasure.
[919-922] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of Hell Realm Terminology
**Analysis:**
- *dmyal ba* (hell): From root meaning "torture, affliction." The eight hot hells (*tsha dmyal brgyad*) are enumerated from Yama-soothed (*yang sos*) upward in intensity.
- *chu bur can* (bubble-possessing): Refers to hells where beings blister like bubbles in extreme cold.
- *nyi tshe ba* (occasional): From *nyi* (sun/day) + *tshe* (life), implying transient, intermittent manifestation.
- *nye 'khor ba* (neighboring): The sixteen neighboring hells surrounding the eight major hot and cold hells.
**Grammar Note:** *dpag tshad nyi khri nyi khri* (twenty-thousand twenty-thousand leagues) uses reduplication for emphasis, indicating vast depth rather than precise measurement.
[923-926] [CONTEXT] The Preta and Animal Realms in Buddhist Cosmology
**Analysis:**
**Preta Realm (*yi dwags*):**
- Etymology: From Sanskrit *preta*, "departed one, ghost"
- Location: 500 leagues below Rājagṛha (*rgyal po'i khab*), with "branches" (*yan lag*) interpenetrating the human realm
- Classical description: Beings with needle-thin throats and mountain-sized bellies, perpetually tormented by hunger and thirst
**Animal Realm (*dud 'gro*):**
- Primary habitat: Great oceans (*rgya mtsho chen po*)
- Dispersed manifestation: Scattered throughout human/god realms
- Doxographical note: In Yogācāra systems, animals represent delusion (*gti mug*), one of the three poisons.
[927-928] [CONCEPT] The Asura and Deva Realms
**Analysis:**
**Demigods (*lha ma yin* / Asura):**
- Location: Below Mount Meru's water-line (*chu mtshams*), in hollow space (*khong gseng*)
- Psychological correlate: Jealousy (*phrag dog*), resentment of the gods' privileges
- Cosmological function: The "in-between" realm, neither fully divine nor fully bound
**Gods (*lha* / Deva):**
- Location: Above Mount Meru's tiers (*bang rim*), ascending hierarchically
- Twenty-seven levels in standard Buddhist cosmology, from Four Great Kings up to Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception
[929-935] [CONTEXT] The Four Great Kings and Their Domains
**Analysis:**
**Cosmographic Structure:**
Seven concentric mountain rings (*ri bdun*) surround Mount Meru, containing:
- Cities (*grong*) and pleasure-groves (*skyed mos tshal*) of the Four Great Kings (*rgyal chen bzhi*)
- The thirty-three gods (*sum cu rtsa gsum*) on Meru's summit
**Seven Great Yakshas (*gnod sbyin chen po bdun*):**
1. *gser rkang* (Golden-foot) - Associated with wealth and earth
2. *stobs ldan* (Powerful) - Martial protection
3. *'jug srid* (Entering-existence) - Birth and incarnation
4. *grags pa'i dpal* (Glory of Fame) - Reputation and recognition
5. *ri 'degs* (Mountain-raising) - Geological stability
6. *mchog srid* (Supreme-existence) - Sovereignty and rule
These yakshas embody the forces that govern worldly fortune and misfortune.
[936-940] [CONCEPT] The Karmic Function of Guardian Deities
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa describes these yakshas as actively sending (*gtong*) the four calamities:
1. Human disease (*mi nad*)
2. Animal disease (*phyugs nad*)
3. Weapons/war (*mtshon*)
4. Famine (*mu ge*)
**Doxographical Note:** This reflects the Indian medical-cosmological system where disease arises from elemental (*'byung ba*) imbalance, often personified as spirit-deities.
The seven "paralyzing mother-goddesses" (*rengs byed kyi ma mo bdun*) function as karmic administrators, controlling (*dbang byed*) specific actions. This connects to the larger Buddhist framework of dharmapalas and lokapalas who manage the ripening of karma.
[941-952] [CONTEXT] The Eight Naga Kings and Elemental Cosmology
**Analysis:**
**The Eight Great Nagas (*klu'i rgyal po brgyad*):**
1. *dga' bo* (Joyful / Nanda)
2. *nye dga'* (Near-joyful / Upananda)
3. *rta'i gzhi* (Horse-basis / Takṣaka)
4. *btang bzung* (Releasing-holding / Vāsuki)
5. *gzi can* (Possessing-splendor / Karkoṭa)
6. *yul 'khor srung* (Land-guarding / Padma)
7. *nag po chen po* (Great Black / Mahāpadma)
8. *e la'i 'dab* (E la leaves / Śaṅkhapāla)
**Function:** These naga-kings control precipitation (*char che ba dang chung ba*) in Jambudvīpa, embodying the hydraulic cycle essential to agriculture and life.
**Philological Note:** *las nye bar ston par byed* — "make showing near the action" — indicates their role as immediate (*nye bar*) karmic instruments rather than primary causes.
[953-954] [STRUCTURE] The Yakṣa Guardians of the Cardinal Directions
**Analysis:**
At the four corners (*grwa bzhi*) of Meru's base tier reside the "raising-time yakshas" (*'degs dus kyi gnod sbyin*) — four extremely powerful (*rab tu stobs dang ldan pa*) guardians.
**Architectural Significance:** This completes the cosmological enumeration, establishing the full mandala-structure of our world-system before Longchenpa proceeds to analyze how sentient beings arise and evolve within this framework.
**Transition:** Having established the container (*snod*) — the cosmic environment — the text will now turn to the contained (*bcud*) — the sentient beings who inhabit these realms.
[955-959] [CONTEXT] Seasonal Cycles and Cosmic Administration
**Analysis:**
The yakshas and guardian deities regulate the four seasons (*dus bzhi*):
1. **Summer** (*dbyar*): Rainfall (*char 'bab pa*) for crops
2. **Autumn** (*ston*): Grain maturation (*'bru smin pa*)
3. **Winter** (*dgun*): Cold dormancy (*bsil zhing grang ba*)
4. **Spring** (*dpyid*): Warming and renewed ripening (*dro bar smin pa*)
This reflects the Indian agricultural calendar integrated with Buddhist cosmology, where elemental forces are personified as deities managing natural processes.
[960-965] [STRUCTURE] Definition of "Action Beings" (*las kyi 'gro ba*)
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa introduces a technical classification:
**Hierarchy of Beings:**
- Common essence beings (*bcud kyi 'gro ba phal pa*) — ordinary sentient beings
- Elevated action beings (*srid pa las kyi 'gro ba*) — those accomplished through collective (*spyi mthun*) karma
**Temporal Characteristics:**
These beings arise simultaneously (*mnyam*) with world-formation (*'jig rten 'chags pa*) and perish simultaneously with world-destruction (*'jig pa*). Their lifespan equals an eon (*bskal pa*).
**Doxographical Note:** This classification distinguishes between:
- Beings born from karma (most sentient beings)
- Beings born from concentration (*bsam gtan*)
- Beings born from emanation (*sprul pa*)
[966-980] [PHILOLOGY] The Asura Realm: Paradox of Proximity
**Analysis:**
**Etymology:** *lha ma yin* (non-god, demigod) — the *ma* negates full divine status while acknowledging quasi-divine characteristics.
**Location:** Root place (*rtsa ba'i gnas*) in Meru's hollow space (*khong gseng*), yet possessing (*'byor pa*) splendor (*dpal*) and fortune (*skal ba bzang po*) rivaling (*'gran pa*) the gods.
**The City Golden-possessing (*gser ldan*):**
- Built of various jewels (*rin po che sna tshogs*)
- Center contains:
- *dbang po'i khang bzangs gdams pa can* — Indra's palace with instructions
- *'dun sa nor bzangs* — Assembly-place of good wealth
- Four pleasure-groves (*skyed mos tshal*):
1. *dga' ba* — Joy
2. *rab tu dga' ba* — Great Joy
3. *kun dga' ra ba* — Universal Joy Park
4. *dga' ba'i kun dga' ra ba* — Joy Universal Joy Park
**Topographical Features:**
- *tsi tri pa* — Chief tree (likely *parijata*, wish-fulfilling tree)
- *rdo leb rab tu bzang po* — Excellent flat stone
- *ti se'i gangs brtsegs* — Stacked snows of Kailash
- *bzod par dka' ba* — Difficult-to-endure (elephant)
- *rab myur* — Very Swift (horse)
[981-988] [CONCEPT] The Nature of Asura Enjoyment
**Analysis:**
The text enumerates asura possessions:
- Trees, groves, horses, elephants
- Clothes, wealth, nectar (*bdud rtsi*)
**Philosophical Significance:** Despite possessing all these enjoyments (*longs spyod*), asuras cannot enjoy them due to jealousy (*phrag dog*). This demonstrates the Buddhist principle that mental state (*sems*) determines experience more than external conditions.
**Dzogchen Relevance:** This parallels the distinction between ordinary mind (*sems*) and pristine awareness (*rig pa*) — one can have all external conditions without recognition.
[989-994] [CONTEXT] The Six Desire God Realms (*'dod lha'i gnas drug*)
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa enumerates the six heavens of the desire realm:
1. **Four Great Kings** (*rgyal chen bzhi*) — On seven mountains' periphery
2. **Thirty-three** (*sum cu rtsa gsum*) — On Meru's summit
3. **Conflict-free** (*'thab bral*) — Sun (*nyi ma*) palace
4. **Joy-possess** (*dga' ldan*) — Moon (*zla ba*) palace
5. **Emanation-joy** (*'phrul dga'*) — Planet/star level
6. **Other-emanation-power** (*gzhan 'phrul dbang byed*) — Highest desire heaven
**Cosmographic Correlation:**
These map onto celestial bodies and geographical features:
- Seven mountains (*ri bdun*) + eight surrounding features
- Sun, moon, planets, stars (*gza' skar*)
- Four continents (*gling bzhi*) centering on snow mountain
- Groves, cities, and various abodes
[995-999] [PHILOLOGY] The Four Desire Realm Tiers (*bang rim bzhi*)
**Analysis:**
Within these six heavens exist four specific tiers characterized by unique attributes:
1. **First tier:** Gods holding screens (*yol go*) in hands — protective deities
2. **Second tier:** Gods wearing flower garlands (*me tog gi phreng ba*) — aesthetic refinement
3. **Third tier:** Gods perpetually intoxicated (*rtag tu myos pa*) by honey-wine (*sbrang chang*) — sensory indulgence
4. **Fourth tier:** Elevated-born (*'phags skyes po*) in four directions — directional guardians
**Grammar Note:** *thogs pa* (holding/wearing) in lines 996-997 uses the perfective participle, indicating these are defining characteristics rather than temporary actions.
**Structural Transition:** Having established the cosmological container (*snod*) from hells to highest desire heaven, Longchenpa will next analyze form realm (*gzugs khams*) and formless realm (*gzugs med khams*) gods, completing the trikāya cosmological framework.
[1000-1002] [PHILOLOGY] The Four Great Kings (*rgyal chen bzhi*)
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa names three of the Four Great Kings (Lokapālas) who guard the cardinal directions:
1. *spyan mi bzang* — Virūpākṣa (Ugly-eyes), guardian of the west
2. *rnam thos kyi bu* — Vaiśravaṇa (Hearing's Son / Kuvera), guardian of the north
3. *yul 'khor srung* — Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Land-guarding), guardian of the east
**Note:** Virūḍhaka (Growing), guardian of the south, is implied but not explicitly named in this section.
Each king dwells with his individual retinue (*so so'i 'khor*), establishing the hierarchical structure of the desire realm's lower heavens.
[1003-1007] [CONCEPT] Aesthetics of the Divine Realms
**Analysis:**
The description employs traditional Indian motifs of paradise:
**Ground:**
- *gser gyi sa gzhi* — Golden ground
- *tsan dan gyi chus chag chag btab* — Sprinkled with sandalwood water
**Flora:**
- *man dA ra ba* — Mandārava flowers (coral tree, *Erythrina indica*), covering to knee-depth (*pus nub tsam du khebs pa*)
**Hydrology:**
- *rdzing bu bzang po* — Beautiful lakes
- *chu khad chad du yod pa* — Water filled precisely to the level (*khad chad* = exact measure)
This reflects the *kalpavṛkṣa* (wish-fulfilling tree) mythology common to Indian cosmologies, where divine realms are characterized by natural abundance and sensory perfection.
[1008-1019] [CONTEXT] Celestial Mechanics: Sun, Moon, and Stars
**Analysis:**
**Solar Palace (*nyi ma'i gzhal med khang*):**
- Dimensions: 51 leagues (*dpag tshad lnga bcu rtsa gcig*) in height
- Material: Fire-crystal (*me shel*)
- Surrounded by gold and silver fences
- Adorned with four-jewel towers and gods' cities
**Lunar Palace (*zla ba*):**
- Dimensions: 50 leagues

**Star Hierarchies (*skar ma*):**
- Great (*che ba*): 18.25 leagues (*rgyang grags bco brgyad dang bzhi cha gcig*)
- Medium (*'bring*): 2-17 leagues
- Small (*chung ba*): 1 league
**Cosmological Function:**
These celestial bodies "naturally" (*rang bzhin gyis*) circle the four continents daily (*nyin zhag re re zhing*), demonstrating:
- Mechanical cosmology where celestial motion is inherent (*rang byung*)
- Spherical earth model with four continents
- Sun and moon as palaces (*gzhal med khang*) housing deities
**Material Composition:**
Formed from any of four elements (*'byung ba bzhi*):
- Gold (*gser*)
- Copper (*zangs*)
- Water-crystal (*chu shel*)
- Iron (*'khar ba*)
Floating at 40,000 leagues altitude, radiating light (*'od zer du 'phro ba*).
[1020-1032] [STRUCTURE] The Thirty-three Gods (*sum cu rtsa gsum pa*)
**Analysis:**
**Location:** Summit of Meru (*ri dbang lhun po'i steng na*)
**Five Components (*lnga las*):**
1. City (*grong*)
2. Grove (*tshal*)
3. Ground (*sa gzhi*)
4. Tree (*shing*)
5. Good assembly-place (*'dun sa bzang po*)
**Indra's Domain:**
- *dbang po'i pho brang 'khor* — Indra's surrounding palace
- *spyi'i grong blta na sdug* — Common city, beautiful to behold
**Completely-victorious Palace (*rnam par rgyal ba'i khang bzangs*):**
- Location: Center (*dbus na*) of three intermediate places (*mtshams gyi gnas gsum*)
- Dimensions: 150 leagues per side (*ngos re la... brgya lnga bcu pa*)
- Height: 5.5 leagues above Beautiful-to-see (*blta na sdug*)
- Structure: 8 stories (*ba gam brgyad*) with 7 stacked houses (*khang bu brtsegs ma bdun*), each containing 7 rooms (*gnas khang bdun*)
**Doxographical Note:** This corresponds to the Trayastriṃśa heaven in standard Buddhist cosmology, ruled by Śakra/Indra, representing the pinnacle of the desire realm's "horizontal" dimension before ascending to the "vertical" higher heavens.
[1033-1040] [PHILOLOGY] The Four Pleasure-groves (*skyed mos tshal bzhi*)
**Analysis:**
Located in the four directions (*phyogs bzhi na*):
1. *shing rta sna tshogs can* — Chariot Various-possessing
Each grove contains:
- *rin po che'i shing* — Jewel trees
- *bya* — Birds
- *rdzing bu du mas* — Many lakes
**Sensory Adornments:**
- *lha'i gos* — Gods' garments
- *rol mo* — Music
- *bdud rts'i* — Nectar
- *nor bu sna tshogs kyi dra ba* — Net of various jewels
**Philological Note:** The term *skyed mos tshal* (pleasure-grove) combines *skyed* (producing/growing) + *mos* (desire/pleasure) + *tshal* (grove/garden), indicating cultivated sensory enjoyment rather than wild nature.
**Structural Transition:** Having detailed the Thirty-three gods' realm—the highest desire-realm heaven on Meru—Longchenpa will next ascend to the higher desire heavens (Conflict-free, Joy-possess, etc.) and then to the form realm (*gzugs khams*), completing the cosmological survey before analyzing how beings arise within these realms.
[1041] [PHILOLOGY] Divine Society and Sensory Culture
**Analysis:**
The social dimension of the Thirty-three gods' realm:
- *lha'i bu dang bu mo* — Gods' sons and daughters
- *glu dang sil snyan* — Songs and cymbals/music
- *'khrol bas gang ba* — Filled with playing/performance
**Grammar Note:** *'khrol ba* (to play music) with instrumental *-s* indicates ongoing activity, suggesting perpetual entertainment as characteristic of this realm.
[1042-1044] [STRUCTURE] The Common City (*spyi'i 'gro khyer*)
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa distinguishes between:
1. The "Common Beautiful-to-see" (*spyi'i 'gro khyer blta na sdug*) — general urban area
2. The outer cyclic existence (*'khor bar*) — peripheral pleasure palaces
**Urban Features:**
- *nang gi sa gzhi* — Interior ground
- *lam srang* — Streets
- *yid du 'ong ba* — Mind-pleasing
- *dus bzhir me tog gi char 'bab pa* — Flower rain falling in four seasons
This reflects the *kalpavṛkṣa* motif where divine environments spontaneously produce sensory delights.
[1043] [CONCEPT] Architectural Dimensions
**Analysis:**
**Jewel Mansions (*rin po che'i khang brtsegs*):**
- Width: 4,500 leagues per side (*ngos re dpag tshad bzhi bzhi stong lnga brgya pa*)
- Height: 3.5 leagues (*dpangs su phyed dang gsum 'phags pa*)
These dimensions exceed physical possibility, indicating symbolic or visionary geography rather than literal measurement.
[1045-1047] [CONTEXT] Urban Hydrology and Flora
**Analysis:**
**Fortification:**
- *rin po che sna bdun gyi ra ba bdun* — Seven walls of seven jewels
- Interval (*bar na*) filled with falling water (*'bab chus yongs su gang ba*)
**Botanical Features:**
- *pad+ma la sogs pa* — Lotus and similar flowers
- *me tog gi tshogs rgyas* — Expanding flower groups
- *bya skad snyan par sgrogs pa* — Birds proclaiming sweetly
**Technology:**
- *rin po che'i gru lding ba* — Flying jewel boats
This represents the fusion of natural beauty with technological marvel in divine realms.
[1048-1049] [PHILOLOGY] The Intermediate Cities (*mtshams gyi grong*)
**Analysis:**
**Location:** At four corners (*mtshams bzhi*) of Meru's peak
**Structure:**
- *khang brtsegs lnga brgya pa* — 500 stacked mansions
- *lha'i grong gis brgyan pa bzhi* — Four cities adorned by gods
- *thang ra ba* — Plain/flat walls
- *dpag tshad lnga pas sbrel ba* — Connected by 5-league walls
**Guardians:**
- *gnod sbyin lag na rdo rje mched bzhi* — Four Vajra-hand yaksha siblings
- *lha rigs* — God race/lineage
These correspond to the Four Great Kings' extended retinue, protecting the periphery of the central divine realm.
[1050-1054] [CONTEXT] The Four Directional Gardens
**Analysis:**
**Dimensions:** 20 leagues in each direction (*phyogs bzhir dpag tshad nyi shu nyi shu*)
**Cardinal Gardens:**
**East (*shar*):**
- *shing rta sna tshogs kyi skyed mos tshal* — Chariot Various park
- Features: ponds, clothes, chariots
- Function: Social/transportation gathering
**South (*lho*):**
- *rtsub 'gyur gyi skyed mos tshal* — Rough-change park
- Feature: Hard armors arise during battle (*g.yul 'gyed pa'i tshe go cha sra ba*)
- Function: Martial preparation
**West (*nub*):**
- *longs spyod 'dres pa'i skyed mos tshal* — Enjoyment-mix park
- Feature: Immeasurable enjoyments (*dpag tu med pa*)
- Function: Sensory pleasure
**North (*byang*):**
- *kun tu dga' ba'i skyed mo tshal* — Everywhere-joy park
- Features: Free from all sorrow (*mya ngan thams cad dang bral*), brilliant joys (*mdangs dga' ba*)
- Function: Meditative bliss
**Doxographical Note:** These four gardens correspond to the four immeasurables (*tshad med bzhi*) in corrupted form—practiced with attachment, they produce god-realm experiences rather than liberation.
[1055-1058] [PHILOLOGY] Detailed Garden Features
**Analysis:**
**Dimensions:**
- Width: 250 leagues (*chu zheng dpag tshad nyis brgya lnga bcu pa*)
- Shape: Beautiful form (*dbyibs legs shing blta na sdug pa*)
**Ground Composition:**
- *gser gyi bye ma* — Gold sand/pebbles
- *rin po che sna tshogs kyi rjod zhing* — Various jewel flower beds
- *mtsho dang rdzing* — Lakes and ponds
**Exterior Ground (*phyi rol na sa gzhi*):**
- Shares names with interior features (*ming mtshungs pa*)
- Decorated with flowers and ponds
**Structural Note:** The recursive naming (*de dag dang ming mtshungs pa*) suggests fractal or holographic cosmology where macrocosm and microcosm mirror each other—a key theme in Dzogchen metaphysics that Longchenpa will develop later in the text.
[1059] [STRUCTURE] Spatial Symmetry of the Cosmological Plan
**Analysis:**
The "equal measure" (*snyoms par byas pa'i tshad*) between directions establishes the symmetrical, mandalic structure of the Thirty-three gods' realm. The four parks (*skyed mos tshal bzhi po*) maintain equivalent dimensions, reflecting the balanced nature of divine environments.
[1060-1063] [CONTEXT] The Wish-fulfilling Tree (*yongs 'dus brtol*)
**Analysis:**
**Botanical Specifications:**
- Name: *yongs 'dus brtol* (Complete Gather Burst)
- Location: Northeast (*byang shar*)
- Root depth: 5 leagues (*dpag tshad lnga 'thur du thug*)
- Height: 100+ leagues (*gyen du brgya 'phags pa*)
- Canopy: Umbrella-like spread (*gdugs ltar gyes pa*)
- Circumference: 50 leagues (*'khor yug dpag tshad lnga bcur 'khyil ba*)
**Adornments:**
- *nor bu'i dra ba* — Jewel net
- *lha'i gos dpyangs pa* — Hanging divine garments
**Doxographical Note:** The *kalpavṛkṣa* (wish-fulfilling tree) motif appears across Indian religions. In Buddhism, it represents the abundance of merit. In Dzogchen, it symbolizes the natural display (*rang snang*) of awareness's creativity.
[1064] [PHILOLOGY] Indra's Throne and the White Rock Slab
**Analysis:**
**Location:** Near (*drung na*) the wish-fulfilling tree
**Features:**
- *ar mo nig lta bu'i rdo leb dkar po* — White rock slab like armonig (harmonious jewel)
- Width: 50 leagues (*chu zheng dpag tshad lnga bcu*)
- *dbang po'i khri* — Indra's throne
- *me tog gi char 'bab pa* — Flower rain falling
**Symbolism:** The white rock (*rdo leb dkar po*) represents the vajra seat (*rdo rje'i gdan*) — the immovable ground of enlightenment. Indra's throne here prefigures the universal monarch's connection to dharmic sovereignty.
[1065-1067] [STRUCTURE] The Assembly-place Dharma Good (*chos bzangs*)
**Analysis:**
**Location:** Southwest of Beautiful-to-see (*blta na sdug*), 4.5 leagues distant
**Physical Characteristics:**
- Shape: Perfectly round (*kun nas zlum pa*)
- Surrounded by: Jewel trees (*rin po che'i shing*) and walls
- Width: 300 leagues (*chu zheng du sum brgya*)
- Circumference: 900 leagues (*mtha' skor dgu brgya pa*)
**Interior:**
- Center: Indra's throne (*dbang po'i khri*)
- Arranged gods' seats (*lha rnams kyi stan bsham pa*)
This assembly-place functions as the cosmic court where divine governance occurs.
[1068-1072] [CONCEPT] Celestial Distances and Higher Heavens
**Analysis:**
**Higher Desire and Form Realms:**
- *nam mkha' la brten pa'i gzhal med khang* — Sky-supporting measureless houses
- Located progressively higher (*gong nas gong du*) like spread planets/stars (*gza' skar bkram pa ltar*)
- Dimensions double (*nyis 'gyur gyis*) with each ascent
**Spatial Calculations:**
- Interval between Jambudvīpa and Thirty-three: 80,000 leagues
- This distance equals the space between Thirty-three and Free-from-war (*'thab bral*)
**Doxographical Significance:** These calculations establish the cosmological framework for understanding:
- The vertical axis of saṃsāra
- How concentrated mind (*bsam gtan*) produces increasingly subtle bodies in higher realms
- The graduated path of Buddhist cosmology
[1073-1079] [CONTEXT] Cosmogony: World Formation
**Analysis:**
**Temporal Framework:**
- *bar gyi bskal pa gcig* — One intermediate eon (*antarakalpa*)
- World is "empty by nature" (*stong pa'i rang bzhin*) and "free from beings" (*'gro bas dben pa*)
**Environmental Development:**
Mountains and hills develop:
- Trees, grass, flowers of various kinds
- Valleys become forests and thicket-continents
- Rain falls from sky
- Jewel trees expand
This describes the *vivartakalpa* (eon of formation) when the world-system evolves from primordial elements.
[1080-1082] [PHILOLOGY] The Genesis of Sentient Beings (*bcud chags tshul*)
**Analysis:**
**Process Description:**
1. *bdud rtsi'i char babs pa* — Nectar rain falls
2. *sa la rlangs phyung ste* — Vapor releases from ground
3. *rin po che'i shing sna tshogs* — Various jewel trees
4. *pad+ma'i rang bzhin du smin par byas pa* — Ripened in lotus nature
**Grammar Note:** The chain of particles (*-s*, *-te*, *la*) indicates sequential causation:
- Instrumental (*-s*): Rain causes vapor
- Connective (*-te*): Vapor enables tree growth
- Locative (*la*): Ground as substrate
**Dzogchen Connection:** This cosmogonic sequence mirrors Dzogchen accounts of how awareness (*rig pa*) manifests as the five elements and worlds. The "nectar rain" parallels the spontaneous display (*lhun grub*) of primordial wisdom.
**Structural Transition:** Having established the cosmological container (*snod*) in exhaustive detail, Longchenpa will now turn to the contained (*bcud*)—how sentient beings arise and evolve within these realms.
[1083-1086] [CONTEXT] The Cosmic Invitation: Elemental Deities and the Awakening of Latent Consciousness
**Analysis:**
**Participants in World-Genesis:**
- *rlung gi lha mo bzhi* — Four wind goddesses (cardinal directions)
- *chu'i lha mo gar byed pa mang po* — Many water goddesses dancing
- *klu'i bu stobs dang ldan pa bzhi* — Four powerful naga sons
**Catalyst Event:**
The "mind entering" (*yid zhugs pa*) of these elemental deities combines with Padma's (*pad+ma*) speech-sound (*gsung sgra*) radiating in all directions (*phyogs kun tu 'phros pa*). This creates the acoustic trigger (*sgras bskul ba*) that awakens dormant consciousness.
**Dzogchen Significance:** This mirrors the Dzogchen concept of spontaneous display (*lhun grub*) arising from the sound, light, and rays (*sgra 'od zer gsum*) of primordial awareness.
[1087-1093] [PHILOLOGY] The Ontological Status of the First Beings
**Analysis:**
**Key Technical Terms:**
1. *sngar gyi gzugs med smin rung* — Previous formless ripened [beings]
- Those who attained formless absorptions (*gzugs med snyoms 'jug*) in previous eons
2. *rnam shes bzung ba'i char gnas* — Consciousness-held nature-abiding
- *bzung ba* = grasped/held
- *char gnas* = nature/condition of falling/arising
3. *sa bon bag la nyal du gnas pa* — Seeds abiding in latency
- *sa bon* = seed/bīja
- *bag la nyal* = latency/anusaya
- Standard Abhidharma concept of karmic seeds awaiting fruition
4. *ting nge 'dzin gyi sprul pa'i lus* — Samādhi-emanation body
- Not a physical body but a mind-made body (*yid kyi lus*)
- Produced through meditative concentration
**Ontological Ambiguity:**
These beings exist in a liminal state:
- Not subtle mind alone (*phra ba yid*)
- Not coarse flesh-blood (*rags pa sha khrag*)
- Not clear light body (*dngas pa 'od kyi lus*)
**Technical Designation:** *yod min med min pa'i 'gro ba dang khams* — Realms and beings of neither-existence-nor-non-existence.
**Doxographical Context:** This corresponds to the intermediate state (*bar do*) between formless and form realms, and anticipates the Madhyamaka analysis of dependent origination beyond the extremes of existence and non-existence.
[1094-1095] [CONCEPT] The Paradoxical Nature of Samādhi-Bodies
**Analysis:**
**Phenomenological Description:**
The samādhi-emanation body (*ting nge 'dzin rnam par 'phrul pa'i lus*) manifests with dual appearance:
- *res yod pa ltar snang* — Appearing as having parts
- *res med pa ltar snang* — Appearing as without parts
**Philosophical Implication:** This reflects the Yogācāra insight that appearances (*snang ba*) do not entail substantial existence (*yod pa*). The samādhi-body appears functional yet lacks inherent nature (*svabhāva*).
**Grammar Note:** *res* (part/portion) with the comparative (*ltar*) creates a simile structure indicating apparent but not actual partition.
[1096-1098] [STRUCTURE] Abode and Expansion of the First Beings
**Analysis:**
**Location:** *zhing 'di'i rtse mo pad+ma rnam par brtsegs pa'i nam mkha'* — The sky at the peak of this field called "Padma completely-arranged" (corresponding to the wish-fulfilling tree location).
**Population Explosion:** *dpag tu med par mched de* — Expanded immeasurably
**Sūraṅgama Samādhi (*ting nge 'dzin zhi ba'i rang 'od dang dga' bde la spyod cing dpa' bar 'gro ba*):**
- *zhi ba'i rang 'od* — Peaceful self-light
- *dga' bde la spyod cing* — Engaging in bliss-joy
- *dpa' bar 'gro ba* — Going heroically/sublime progress
**Doxographical Note:** The Sūraṅgama Samādhi is a key meditative absorption in Mahāyāna Buddhism, mentioned in the *Sūraṅgama-samādhi-sūtra*. It represents the highest accomplishment of śrāvakas before entering Mahāyāna paths.
[1099-1101] [CONTEXT] The Golden Vajra and the Cause of Falling
**Analysis:**
**Cosmic Feature:**
Beneath (*'og na*) the Sūraṅgama abode, a great golden vajra (*gser gyi rdo rje chen po*) arose upward (*gyen la langs te*) in the sky of the "Mind-completely-play wheel-possessing" (*yid rnam par rol pa'i 'khor lo can*) realm.
**Aesthetic Power:**
- *'od zer dpag tu med pa 'phro bas* — Radiating immeasurable light-rays
- *shin tu mdzes shing dpa' ba'i nyams dang ldan pa* — Possessing extremely beautiful and heroic manner
**Psychological Mechanism:**
The upper realm beings, traveling by samādhi-emanation bodies, see (*mthong*) this vajra and wish to view it beautifully (*mdzes par blta ba*). This desire causes them to "go heroically" (*dpa' bar 'gro ba*) toward it.
**Philosophical Significance:** This is the first instance of *'khrul pa* (delusion/confusion) entering the narrative—the arising of attraction (*'dod chags*) toward beautiful form.
[1102-1106] [PHILOLOGY] The Mechanics of Cosmic Devolution
**Analysis:**
**Sequence of Fall:**
1. *sprul pa'i rdo rje de yid la rab tu g.yos pas* — The emanation vajra extremely moves in mind
- *g.yos pa* = moved/agitated (from *g.yo ba*, to move)
2. *'gro ba de dag gi rnam pa las skyes pa'i 'gro ba de la* — Toward those realms arisen from the nature of those realms
3. *'ga' tsam thigs pa ltar yas chad pas* — Some, like drops, surpassing cast
- *thigs pa* = drop/particle
- *yas chad* = surpassing/casting beyond
4. *gong gi dpa' bar 'gro ba'i ting nge 'dzin yal nas* — Lapsed from upper Sūraṅgama samādhi
- *yal ba* = lapsed/fallen away
5. *ci yang med do zhes brjod pa las* — From saying "there is nothing whatsoever"
**Critical Interpretation:** This describes the transition from formless absorption to form realm existence through the arising of subtle attraction. The phrase *ci yang med do* echoes the formless absorption attainment formula, indicating these beings have now lost that realization.
**Structural Transition:** Longchenpa is explaining the origin of the form realm (*gzugs khams*) gods—the first "fall" from pure absorption into differentiated existence, establishing the mechanism by which all saṃsāric realms arise through subtle attachment.
[1107-1110] [PHILOLOGY] The Realm of Nothing-Perception (*'du shes med pa'i snyoms 'jug*)
**Analysis:**
**Technical Designations:**
From the upper realm where "only perception exists" (*'du shes tsam du yod*), beings expand into:
- *ci yang med pa* — Nothing whatsoever
- *cung zad med pa* — Slightly nothing
These correspond to the third and fourth formless absorptions:
- *ci yang med pa* = Nothingness (*akiñcanya*)
- *cung zad med pa* = Neither perception nor non-perception (*naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana*)
**Grammar Note:** *tsam* (only/merely) with *du* creates an adverbial phrase indicating exclusive existence of perception without content.
[1111-1117] [CONCEPT] The Mechanics of Cosmic Devolution
**Analysis:**
**Principle:** *ting nge 'dzin gyi snang ba bzang ba ni ting nge 'dzin bzang ba las skye* — Good samādhi appearances arise from good samādhi.
**Progressive Degradation:**
As beings "go increasingly bad below" (*'og mar je ngan du song ba*):
1. Emanation bodies (*lus sprul*) become smaller (*lus bongs chung*)
2. Light brilliance diminishes (*'od mdangs kyang chung*)
3. Designated with "low denying sound" (*dman pa dgag pa'i sgra*)
**Technical Term:** *skye mched* (āyatana) — The sense-bases arise from expanded upper appearances.
**Affliction Status:**
- *nyon mongs pa mngon du rgyu med* — Afflictions not manifestly active
- *phra ba bag la nyal du gnas* — Dwell in subtle latency
This describes the form realm gods whose attachment is subtle but present as latent tendencies.
[1118] [CONTEXT] The Jewel Box Samādhi (*rin po che za ma tog*)
**Analysis:**
These beings dwell in the "Jewel Box" samādhi—an enclosure of subtle enjoyment where:
- Sensory experience is present but refined
- Attachment exists as latency (*bag la nyal*)
- The "box" metaphor suggests containment and limitation
**Dzogchen Parallel:** This corresponds to the "all-ground of habitual tendencies" (*bag chags kyi kun gzhi*) in Dzogchen psychology.
[1119-1128] [CONTEXT] Doctrinal Citations and Synthesis
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa identifies this as "noble tenet arrangement from common vehicle" (*theg pa mthun mong las rnam gzhag 'phags pa'i grub mtha'*), then connects it to Dzogchen:
**Citation 1: Guhyagarbha Tantra (*gsang snying*)**
- Line [1123]: *e ma ho bde gshegs snying po las* — "E ma ho from Sugata heart"
- Line [1124]: *rang gi rnam rtog las kyi sprul* — "Self-thought karma emanation"
**Citation 2: Condensed Perfection of Wisdom (*sdud pa*)**
- Line [1127]: *rkyen rnams 'tshogs na las kyi 'khrul 'khor rab tu 'byung* — "When conditions gather, karma's confusion-wheel arises"
**Synthesis Strategy:** Longchenpa uses common vehicle (abhidharmic) cosmology as the framework, then reveals its Dzogchen interpretation through tantric citations.
[1129-1133] [PHILOLOGY] The Dzogchen Critique: New Birth vs. Primordial Purity
**Analysis:**
**Paradox:** *sems can gsar skye 'dra yang gsar skyes ma yin* — "Like new-born beings, yet not new-born."
**Dzogchen Ontology:**
1. *rig pa la mtshungs ldan ma rig pas* — Ignorance co-endowed (*mtshungs ldan*) with awareness
2. *lhan skyes su dbyings kyi cha de la sgrib pa nyid* — Together-born obscuration of that space-portion
3. *dang po dag pa* — Primordially pure from the first
4. *phyis 'khrul pa ma yin* — Not confused later
**Critical Insight:** Confusion arises through:
- *rkyen glo bur bas* — Adventitious conditions (not inherent)
- *dngos su gsal bar byas pa tsam* — Only made actually clear
**Etymological Note:** *dbyings* (space/expanse) is explained as expressing the four elements (*'byung bzhi*), connecting cosmic space to elemental manifestation.
**Philosophical Significance:** This establishes the Dzogchen view that confusion is adventitious (*glo bur*) and purification reveals primordial purity (*ka dag*) — a position distinct from gradualist views that see purification as removing inherent defilements.
[1134-1139] [STRUCTURE] Descent to the Mind-Activity Realm
**Analysis:**
**Spatial Transition:** 30,000 leagues below (*dpag tshad stong phrag sum cu'i 'og na*)
**New Realm:** *yid 'byed rnam par rol pa* — Mind-activity completely-play
**Cosmic Feature:**
- *'khor lo dpag tu med pa 'phro zhing* — Immeasurable extending wheels
- *gcig la gcig phrad pa'i sgra rang 'byung ba* — Self-arising sound of mutual contact
**Process of Fall:**
1. Upper beings go to "one direction calm abiding" (*zhi gnas phyogs gcig tu song ba*)
2. Some fall below (*'og tu 'ga' tsam lhung nas*)
3. Mutual consciousness-only contact (*gcig la gcig rnam par shes pa tsam*)
**Doxographical Context:** This describes the transition from the highest form realm into progressively grosser states, establishing the mechanism for the arising of dualistic perception through contact (*phrad pa*), a key concept in dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*).
**Structural Transition:** Having explained the philosophical framework for the arising of beings, Longchenpa will now describe the specific evolution of realms and bodies as descent continues.
[1140-1147] [PHILOLOGY] The Infinite Consciousness Āyatana (*rnam shes mtha' yas kyi skye mched*)
**Analysis:**
**Expansion Mechanism:** As beings proliferate (*mang por mched pas*), consciousness becomes "without end" (*mtha' yas*).
**Five Characteristics:**
1. *rnam pa yul* — Form/object
2. *'khor lo 'jug pa* — Wheel enters (cyclical consciousness)
3. *shes pa tsam la bdag tu rtog pa tsam* — Only conceiving self to only consciousness
4. *mtha' shes pa yas* — Exceeding end-knowledge
5. *sdud pa'i dngos po med pa* — Without condensed thing
**Technical Designation:** *rnam shes mtha' yas kyi skye mched* — The sense-base/sphere of infinite consciousness (second formless absorption).
**Etymological Note:** *skye mched* (āyatana) derives from *skye* (arise) + *mched* (expand/increase), indicating the expansive nature of this meditative attainment.
[1148-1151] [CONCEPT] Degradation of Life, Body, and Concentration
**Analysis:**
**Progressive Decline:**
- Life span: Shorter than above (*tshe tshad thung*)
- Body: Smaller size (*lus bongs chung*)
- Light: Unclear (*'od mi gsal ba*)
- Concentration: Low (*dman pa*)
**Root Cause:** *bsod nams kyi stobs nyams pa* — Decline of merit power.
**Buddhist Principle:** Cosmic and bodily characteristics directly correlate with accumulated merit (*bsod nams*) and meditative stability.
[1152-1156] [STRUCTURE] Descent to the Great Cloud Realm
**Analysis:**
**Spatial Location:** 2,000 leagues below (*dpag tshad stong phrag gnyis na*)
**Realm Name:** *sprin chen po rnam par rol ba* — Great Cloud Completely-Play
**Manifestation Process:**
- Samādhi self-appearance (*ting nge 'dzin rang snang*) arises
- Various colored cloud masses (*sprin kha dog sna tshogs pa'i dum bu*) pervade
- These appear as *ling tsher* (cloud heaps/masses)
- From expanding consciousness, immeasurable beings expand
**Technical Designation:** *nam mkha' mtha' yas pa'i skye mched* — Sky/Space Infinite sense-base (first formless absorption).
[1157-1161] [CONTEXT] Lifespans of the Four Formless Realms
**Analysis:**
**Hierarchical Duration (in Great Eons / *bskal chen*):**
| Realm | Lifespan |
|-------|----------|
| Peak of Existence (*srid rtse*) | 80,000 eons |
| Nothingness (*ci yang med pa*) | 60,000 eons |
| Infinite Consciousness (*rnam shes mtha' yas*) | 40,000 eons |
| Infinite Space (*nam mkha' mtha' yas*) | 20,000 eons |
**Pattern:** Each lower realm has half the lifespan of the realm above it, reflecting the inverse relationship between subtlety and duration.
[1162-1169] [PHILOLOGY] Resolving the Apparent Contradiction: Form vs. Formless
**Analysis:**
**Objection:** Body appearance (*lus snang ba*) seems to contradict formlessness (*gzugs med pa*).
**Resolution:** The text demonstrates that various realms lack "form" (*gzugs*) in different ways:
1. **Meditation gods** (*bsam gtan gyi lha*): Appear as light-form (*'od kyi gzugs*) without coarse matter; dwell only as consciousness.
2. **Desire gods and humans**: Arise without flesh-blood body (*sha khrag gi lus*); consciousness does not actually conceive objects.
3. **Pretas**: Move without mind-form (*yid kyi gzugs*); consciousness is clear internally.
4. **Hells**: Experience without suffering-body of contact (*myong reg sdug bsngal gyi lus*); consciousness dwells in concentration-bliss.
**Key Insight:** Formlessness means absence of *coarse* form, not absolute non-existence. Subtle emanation bodies (*sprul snang gi lus*) exist that:
- Are not visible to lower realms (*og mas bltar mi mngon*)
- Are visible to own realm and above (*rang sa dang gong mas mthong*)
**Philosophical Significance:** This establishes the Yogācāra principle that appearances (*snang ba*) and consciousness (*rnam shes*) are inseparable—there is no "formless" that is absolutely non-appearing.
[1170-1172] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Citation: Perfection of Wisdom
**Analysis:**
**Source:** *yum bar ma* — Middle-length Mother (Perfection of Wisdom in 25,000 lines / *Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā*).
**Citation:** Even gods dwelling in desire, form, and formless realms hold flowers and worship the Tathāgata.
**Doxographical Significance:** This citation demonstrates that:
1. Even the highest gods recognize the Buddha's supremacy
2. Formless realm beings can engage in worship (refuting absolute formlessness)
3. Merit can be created across all realms
**Structural Transition:** Having established the cosmological framework of all realms from hells to peak of existence, Longchenpa has completed the "container" (*snod*) section and will now proceed to detailed analysis of how sentient beings arise, evolve, and experience within these realms—the "contained" (*bcud*) section proper.
[1173-1174] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Confirmation: Abhisamayālaṃkāra
**Analysis:**
**Source:** *'grel chung* — Short Commentary (referring to the *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* or its commentaries).
**Citation Content:** All god races (*lha'i rigs thams cad*) come near — confirming that beings from all divine realms can approach and recognize the Buddha's presence.
**Doxographical Significance:** This citation from the *prajñāpāramitā* commentarial tradition establishes the superiority of Buddha-nature over even the highest god-realms, a key Mahāyāna tenet.
[1175-1181] [STRUCTURE] Transition to the Form Realm (*gzugs kyi khams*)
**Analysis:**
**Spatial Descent:** 20,000 leagues below Infinite Space (*nam mkha' mtha' yas*)
**The Highest Form Heaven:** *rin po che mching bu rnam par bkod pa* — "Jewel Ornament Various Arrangement"
**Characteristics:**
- Five lights (*'od lnga*) appear clearly (*zang thal du snang ba*)
- No outside/inside (*phyi nang med par*)
- Consciousness masses (*shes pa dum bu*) from above become one
**Etymological Analysis of 'Og Min (Akanistha):**
The name derives from:
- Compared to formless above: It is "below" (*'og*)
- Compared to desire/form below: It is "not below" (*min*)
- Existential position: At the peak (*rtse mo*) of all form-possessors (*gzugs can kun gyi*)
**Philosophical Significance:** 'Og min represents the threshold between:
- Formless absorption (pure consciousness)
- Form realm (subtle manifestation)
- It embodies the "highest" (*kanistha* superlative) of conditioned existence before transcending entirely.
[1182-1183] [PHILOLOGY] The Form Realm Body: A Qualitative Distinction
**Analysis:**
**Distinction from Lower Realms:**
Unlike the four limitless āyatanas (*skye mched mu bzhi*) where consciousness-emanation bodies cannot be seen by ordinary eye-consciousness (*mig shes phal pas bltar med pa*), the 'Og min body is distinguished (*khyad par du phye*).
**Body Composition:**
- *rnam shes dang ba* — Clear/pure consciousness
- *phyi 'od kyi lus* — External light-body
**Analogies:**
- *ri mo'i rnam pa* — Like a picture/form
- *'ja' tshon gyi gzugs* — Like a rainbow body
**Dzogchen Connection:** The rainbow body analogy (*'ja' lus*) anticipates Dzogchen's highest attainment, suggesting Longchenpa's implicit mapping of Buddhist cosmology onto the path to liberation.
[1184-1185] [CONCEPT] Dimensions and Lifespan of 'Og Min
**Analysis:**
**Body Size:** 16,000 leagues (*dpag tshad khri drug stong*)
**Lifespan:** 6,000 intermediate eons (*bar bskal khri drug stong*)
**Pattern Recognition:** The 6:6 ratio (6,000 leagues : 6,000 eons) suggests numerical correspondence between spatial and temporal magnitude in form realm cosmology.
[1186-1193] [CONTEXT] The Second Form Heaven: Clear Sight
**Analysis:**
**Calculation Method:** Using Jambudvīpa as reference point to determine spatial intervals.
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che mthon mthing gis rnam par spras pa* — "Variously Ornamented by Jewel Deep Blue"
**Arising Mechanism:** Some latent consciousness (*bag la nyal ba*) falls from above realms and expands.
**Etymology:** *shin tu mthong* (Extremely See/Clear Sight) because:
- Joy (*dga' ba*) exceeds when one sees another (*gcig gis mthong na*)
- Higher clarity of perception than lower realms
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 8,000 leagues
- Lifespan: 8,000 intermediate eons
**Inverse Pattern:** Notice the lifespan increases (6,000 → 8,000) as we descend from 'Og min, reversing the formless realm pattern where lifespans decreased with subtlety.
[1194-1198] [PHILOLOGY] The Third and Fourth Form Heavens
**Analysis:**
**Third Heaven:** *rin po che rabs mdzes* — "Jewel Supreme Beauty"
- Arising: Immeasurable beings expanded from above appear
- Name: *gya nom snang ba* — Excellent Appearance
- Etymology: Marks (*chas*) exceed (*phul du gyur ba*) those below
- Dimensions: 4,000 leagues body, 4,000 eons lifespan
**Fourth Heaven:** *rin po che ze ba smu gu* — "Jewel Hair Fine"
- Arising: Consciousness expands near from above
- Name: *mi gdung ba* — Not Sorrow/Free from Suffering
- Population: Many beings expand (*'gro ba mang du 'phel ba*)
**Numerical Pattern:** The consistent ratio (body size = lifespan in thousands of leagues/eons) demonstrates the systematic nature of Buddhist cosmological calculations.
**Structural Transition:** Longchenpa continues the descending enumeration of form realm heavens, with each successive level representing greater "grossness" of form, longer lifespans, and increased capacity for sense-contact, moving toward the transition to the desire realm.
[1199-1201] [PHILOLOGY] The Not-Sorrow Heaven (*mi gdung ba*)
**Analysis:**
**Etymology:** *mi gdung ba* (Not Sorrow/Free from Suffering) derives from:
- *dga' bde'i snang ba* — Joy-bliss appearance arising
- *gdung ba med pa* — Without sorrow/affliction
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 2,000 leagues (*dpag tshad nyis stong*)
- Lifespan: 2 intermediate eons (*bar gyi bskal pa gnyis*)
**Pattern:** The 2:2 ratio continues the form realm numerical correspondence.
[1202-1206] [CONTEXT] The Not-Great Heaven (*mi che ba*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che shel gyi khang bu brtsegs pa* — "Jewel Crystal House Pile"
**Etymology:** *mi che ba* (Not Great) because:
- *snang ba la 'dod sred mi che ba* — Desire-attachment to appearance is not great
- This marks decreasing attachment as we descend toward the desire realm boundary
**Dimensions:**
- Lifespan: 1 intermediate eon (*bar bskal gcig*)
- Body: 1,000 leagues (*dpag tshad stong*)
**Philosophical Significance:** The decreasing attachment (*'dod sred*) correlates with decreasing lifespan and body size, demonstrating the inverse relationship between subtlety and duration in form realm cosmology.
[1207] [STRUCTURE] The Five Pure Abodes (*gtsang ma ris kyi lha lnga*)
**Analysis:**
**Classification:** *gnas ris lnga po* — Five place classes
**Qualification:** *nyon mongs pa'i dring ba 'ga' zhig med pas* — Without some affliction trace
**Designation:**
- *gtsang ma ris kyi lha lnga* — Five Pure Class Gods
- *'phags pa'i gnas gzhan lnga* — Five Other Noble Places
**Doxographical Note:** The Pure Abodes (śuddhāvāsa) are exclusive to āryas (noble beings) who have attained the path of seeing (*darśana-mārga*) or higher. Ordinary beings (*so so skye bo*) cannot be born here because they still possess affliction-traces (*nyon mongs pa'i dring ba*).
**The Five Pure Abodes:**
1. *'og min* — Neither Below Nor Above (Akanistha)
2. *shin tu mthong* — Clear Sight (Sudṛśa)
3. *gya nom snang ba* — Excellent Appearance (Sudarśana)
4. *mi gdung ba* — Not Sorrow (Atapa)
5. *mi che ba* — Not Great (Avṛha)
[1208-1210] [PHILOLOGY] The Ordinary Being Heavens Begin
**Analysis:**
**Transition:** Below the Pure Abodes (*so so skye bo'i gnas gzhan gsum gyi gong ma*), we enter heavens accessible to ordinary beings.
**Sixth Heaven:** *rin po che rab mdzes rnam par brdal ba* — "Jewel Supreme Beauty Various Spread"
**Arising:** Some "not great" gods (*mi che ba'i lha 'ga'*) fall from above and expand
**Name:** *'bras bu che* — Great Fruit
- **Etymology:** Established from great virtue-fruit of merit-share-equal (*bsod nams cha mthun gyi dge ba'i 'bras bu che ba*)
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 500 leagues
- Lifespan: 500 intermediate eons
**Pattern Continuation:** The 500:500 ratio maintains the body-lifespan correspondence.
[1211-1214] [CONTEXT] Merit-Born Heaven (*bsod nams skyes*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che ka li mdog mdzes kyis rnam par spras pa* — "Variously Ornamented by Jewel Kali Beautiful Color"
**Arising Mechanism:** Some "great fruit" gods fall in "dot manner" (*thig pa'i tshul du chad pa*) — suggesting particulate or gradual descent
**Etymology:** *bsod nams skyes* (Merit Born) because:
- *sngar bsod nams mang du bsogs pa* — Previously accumulated much merit
- Merit itself becomes the direct cause of birth
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 250 leagues (*dpag tshad nyis brgya lnga bcu*)
- Lifespan: 250 intermediate eons
[1215-1220] [PHILOLOGY] Cloudless and Light-Emitting Heavens
**Analysis:**
**Eighth Heaven:** *rin po che sprin rnam par stug po* — "Jewel Cloud Various Thick"
**Arising:** Merit-born beings fall and expand into *sprin med 'od* — Cloud Without Light
**Characteristics:**
- *dal 'jam dro ba'i tshad dang ldan pa* — Possesses slow, gentle, warm measure
- Form: Like sun without clouds (*sprin med pa'i nyi ma'i rnam pa*)
**Etymology:** Named for appearing like unobstructed sunlight
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 125 leagues (*dpag tshad brgya nyi shu rtsa lnga*)
- Lifespan: 125 intermediate eons
**Ninth Heaven:** *rin po che 'od rnam par 'byin pa* — "Jewel Light Various Emit"
**Arising:** From Cloud Without Light (*sprin med*) fall into *dge rgyas* — Virtue Increase
**Structural Pattern:** Notice the consistent halving of dimensions:
- 500 → 250 → 125 leagues
- 500 → 250 → 125 eons
This geometric progression reflects the systematic nature of Buddhist cosmological mathematics.
**Transition:** Having enumerated all nine form realm heavens accessible to ordinary beings (plus the five Pure Abodes), Longchenpa will now complete the form realm description and transition to the desire realm heavens.
[1221-1222] [PHILOLOGY] Virtue Increase Heaven (*dge rgyas*) Dimensions
**Analysis:**
**Etymology:** *dge rgyas* (Virtue Increase) because arisen from expanded virtue roots (*dge rtsa rgyas pa las byung bas*).
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 64 leagues (*dpag tshad drug cu rtsa bzhi pa*)
- Lifespan: 64 intermediate eons (*bar bskal de snyed*)
**Pattern Continuation:** The 64:64 ratio maintains the numerical correspondence between body size and lifespan, though the halving pattern is now becoming less strict.
[1223-1227] [CONTEXT] Measureless Virtue Heaven (*tshad med dge*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che in dra nI las rnam par spras pa* — "Variously Ornamented by Jewel Indra"
**Etymology:** *tshad med dge* (Measureless Virtue) because:
- Established from measureless virtue roots (*dge rtsa tshad med las grub pa*)
- Arisen from those cut from above realms
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 32 leagues
- Lifespan: 32 intermediate eons
**Variant Reading:** Line [1227] notes that some sources place Measureless Virtue above Virtue Increase, indicating textual variation in cosmological ordering.
[1228-1231] [PHILOLOGY] Small Virtue Heaven (*dge chung*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che pa tang ka ling gis rnam par spras pa* — "Variously Ornamented by Jewel Patangkaling"
**Etymology:** *dge chung* (Small Virtue) because:
- Dwelling in small virtue-fruit compared to above (*gong ma bas dge ba'i 'bras bu chung ba la spyod pas*)
- Progressive diminishment of merit as descent continues
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 16 leagues
- Lifespan: 16 intermediate eons
**Geometric Progression:** The halving pattern resumes: 64 → 32 → 16
[1232-1234] [CONCEPT] Clear Light Heaven (*'od gsal*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *nor bu rin po che ke ke ru rnam par spras pa* — "Variously Ornamented by Jewel Kekiru"
**Etymology:** *'od gsal* (Clear Light) because:
- Body possesses clear light (*lus la 'od gsal ba*)
- Progressive transition from virtue-based to luminosity-based naming
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 8 leagues
- Lifespan: 8 intermediate eons
**Dzogchen Connection:** The term *'od gsal* anticipates the Dzogchen concept of clear light nature of mind, though here referring to bodily radiance.
[1235-1237] [PHILOLOGY] Measureless Light Heaven (*tshad med 'od*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che dpal brtsegs* — "Jewel Glory Pile"
**Etymology:** *tshad med 'od* (Measureless Light) because:
- Body's light is measureless (*lus kyi 'od la tshad med pas*)
- Thematic shift to light-based naming continues
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 4 leagues
- Lifespan: 4 intermediate eons
**Numerical Pattern:** Halving continues: 16 → 8 → 4
[1238-1241] [CONTEXT] Small Light Heaven (*'od chung*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che dpa' ba'i 'od* — "Jewel Brave Light"
**Etymology:** *'od chung* (Small Light) because:
- Body's light is small compared to above (*lus kyi 'od gong ma las chung ba*)
- Diminishment of luminosity correlates with approaching desire realm
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 2 leagues
- Lifespan: 2 intermediate eons
[1242-1244] [PHILOLOGY] Great Brahma Heaven (*tshangs chen pa*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che ke ru dza* — "Jewel Keruja"
**Etymology:** *tshangs chen pa* (Great Brahma) because:
- *'dod pa'i skyon las tshangs pas* — Brahma [free] from desire-fault
- Marks transition to Brahma-class heavens
- Brahma here represents purity from desire realm attachment
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 2.5 leagues (*phyed dang gnyis*)
- Lifespan: 2.5 intermediate eons
**Structural Significance:** The appearance of fractional dimensions (*phyed* = half) indicates approaching the boundary where form realm transitions to desire realm.
[1245] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Brahma's Retinue
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che sa mi ka* — "Jewel Samika"
**Arising:** Some cut from Great Brahma (*tshangs chen las 'ga' zhig chad pa*)
**Doxographical Context:** This begins the sub-heavens of the Brahma realm, indicating hierarchical structure within the lowest form realm heaven before transitioning to the desire realm.
**Summary Pattern:** Page 36 completes the systematic enumeration of form realm heavens from Virtue Increase (64 leagues) down to Great Brahma (2.5 leagues), demonstrating the graduated nature of existence from subtle to gross, from long lifespan to short, from virtue-based to light-based to Brahma-based classification.
[1246-1248] [PHILOLOGY] Brahma's Ministers (*tshangs pa mdun na 'don*)
**Analysis:**
**Etymology:** *tshangs pa mdun na 'don* (Brahma Before Recites/Ministers) because:
- *de dag gi mdun na kha don byed pa re yod pas* — There is one doing speech-recitation before them
- These are the assistants/retainers who recite Brahma's praises
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 1 league (*dpag tshad gcig*)
- Lifespan: 1 intermediate eon (*bar bskal gcig*)
This completes the pattern of decreasing size: 2.5 → 1 leagues
[1249-1251] [CONTEXT] Brahma's Retinue (*tshangs pa*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *rin po che si ka ta* — "Jewel Sikata"
**Etymology:** *tshangs pa* (Brahma) because:
- *dge ba'i las la tshangs par spyod pas* — Dwelling brahma-like in virtuous action
- This represents ordinary Brahma beings, not the "Great Brahma"
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 0.5 league (*phyed*)
- Lifespan: 0.5 intermediate eon
**Structural Significance:** The fractional dimensions indicate approaching the threshold between form and desire realms.
[1252-1258] [STRUCTURE] Transition to the Desire Realm (*'dod pa'i khams*)
**Analysis:**
**Major Division:** From two [categories], the desire realm has six god races (*lha rigs drug*)
**First Desire Heaven:** *gzhan 'phrul dbang byed* — Other-Emanation-Power (Paranirmitavaśavartin)
**Heaven Name:** *dpag bsam gyi shing rin po che rab tu rgyas pa* — "Wish-fulfilling Tree Jewel Greatly Expanded"
**Arising:** Some Brahma beings expand, falling from previous excellent accumulations (*sngon gyi bsags pa'i khyad kyis lhung ba*)
**Etymology:** *gzhan 'phrul dbang byed* (Other-Emanation-Power) because:
- *lus dang longs spyod kyi 'byor ba gzhan las sprul par snang ba la dbang* — Power over emanated appearances of body and enjoyment from others
- They control what others emanate
**Calculation Method:** The shift to human years indicates transition to the "grosser" desire realm:
- Human years: 1,600
- One human day = one god year
- God lifespan: 16,000 years
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 2.5 leagues (*rgyang grags phyed dang gnyis*)
- Alternative measurement: 625 bow-lengths (*gzhu 'dom*)
[1259-1263] [PHILOLOGY] Emanation-Joy Heaven (*'phrul dga'*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *dpag bsam gyi shing mthong mdzes* — "Wish-fulfilling Tree See Beautiful"
**Etymology:** *'phrul dga'* (Emanation Joy) because:
- *lus kyi 'od las bu brgya'am stong ngam dpag tu med par sprul nas rtse dga' byed pas* — Emanating hundreds, thousands, or measureless sons from body-light, doing play-joy
- They create their own enjoyment through emanation
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 1.25 leagues (*rgyang grags gcig dang bzhi cha*)
- Or: 625 bow-lengths
**Lifespan Calculation:**
- Human years: 800
- God years: 8,000
[1264-1267] [CONTEXT] Joy-Possess Heaven (*dga' ldan*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** *dpag bsam gyi shing mig mdzes* — "Wish-fulfilling Tree Eye Beautiful"
**Etymology:** *dga' ldan* (Joy Possess/Tuṣita) because:
- *dga' bde dam pa'i chos la spyod pa* — Dwelling in supreme joy-bliss dharma
- This is where bodhisattvas dwell before final birth
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 1 league (*rgyang grags gcig*)
- Or: 500 bow-lengths
**Lifespan:**
- Human years: 400
- God years: 4,000
**Doxographical Significance:** The Tuṣita heaven is where:
- The future Buddha Maitreya currently dwells
- Śākyamuni dwelt before his final birth
- Bodhisattvas complete their final accumulations
**Transition Pattern:** Notice the consistent halving:
- Lifespan: 16,000 → 8,000 → 4,000 god years
- Body size decreasing progressively
[1268] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Higher Desire Heavens
**Analysis:**
**Next Heaven:** *dpag bsam gyi shing yid 'gyur* — "Wish-fulfilling Tree Mind Change" (Nirmāṇarati)
**Pattern Continuation:** Longchenpa will continue the enumeration through the remaining desire heavens (Free-from-Conflict, Thirty-three, Four Great Kings), completing the cosmological survey of all god realms.
**Summary:** Page 37 marks the crucial transition from form realm to desire realm, with the introduction of:
1. Different temporal calculations (human years vs. eons)
2. The "wish-fulfilling tree" (*dpag bsam gyi shing*) as the central motif of desire heavens
3. Bodhisattva cosmology (Tuṣita heaven)
4. The three highest desire heavens before descending to the lower levels
[1269-1272] [PHILOLOGY] Conflict-Free Heaven (*'thab bral*)
**Analysis:**
**Etymology:** *'thab bral* (Free from Conflict/Yāma) because:
- *lha ma yin dang rtsod pa bral ba* — Free from conflict with asuras
- This heaven is free from the constant warfare between gods and demigods
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 0.75 league (*bzhi gsum* = 3/4)
- Or: 375 bow-lengths
**Lifespan:**
- Human years: 200
- God years: 2,000 (one human day = one god year)
**Structural Position:** Fourth of the six desire heavens, marking the descent toward the lower celestial realms.
[1273-1277] [CONTEXT] The Thirty-three Gods (*sum cu rtsa gsum*)
**Analysis:**
**Heaven Name:** Located on ground decorated by the wish-fulfilling tree *yongs 'dus brtol*
**Arising:** Beings expanded from falling from "limitless" (*mtha' bral* = Yāma heaven)
**Central Symbol:** *glang po che rab brtan* — Great Steadfast Elephant
- 32 gold heads (*gser gyi mgo sum cu rtsa gnyis*)
- 1 turquoise head (*g.yu'i mgo gcig*)
- 3 roots exercising power and near-power
**Thirty-three Abodes:** Including:
- *ma 'dres* — Separate/Exclusive
- *phreng 'bar ba* — Blazing Necklace
- And 31 others
**Thirty-three Powers:** The *dbang po sum cu rtsa gsum* (33 powers/activities) give this heaven its name.
**Dimensions:**
- Body: 0.5 league (*bzhi cha gnyis* = 2/4 = 1/2)
- Or: 250 bow-lengths
**Lifespan:**
- Human years: 100
- God years: 1,000
[1278-1284] [STRUCTURE] The Four Great Kings (*rgyal chen ris bzhi*)

[1285] [SUMMARY] The Six Desire God Classes
**Analysis:**
*'dod lha rigs drug* — Complete enumeration:
| Heaven | Tibetan | Sanskrit | Body (leagues) | Human Years |
|--------|---------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | gzhan 'phrul dbang byed | Paranirmitavaśavartin | 2.5 | 1,600 |
| 2 | 'phrul dga' | Nirmāṇarati | 1.25 | 800 |
| 3 | dga' ldan | Tuṣita | 1.0 | 400 |
| 4 | 'thab bral | Yāma | 0.75 | 200 |
| 5 | sum cu rtsa gsum | Trayastriṃśa | 0.5 | 100 |
| 6 | rgyal chen ris bzhi | Cāturmahārājika | 0.25 | 50 |
**Pattern:** Consistent halving of both body size and lifespan as descent progresses.
[1286-1292] [CONTEXT] The Four Asura Classes (*lha min la ris bzhi*)
**Analysis:**
**1. Life-Glory God Type (*tshe dpal lha'i ris*):**
- Equal to Thirty-three gods in body and lifespan
- Highest class of asuras
**2. Great-Power Yakṣa Type (*stobs chen gnod sbyin gyi ris*):**
- Equal to Four Great Kings in body, life, and enjoyment
- Powerful nature spirits
**3. Fierce Nāga Type (*gdug pa klu'i ris*):**
- Equal to nāgas
- Serpent/dragon beings
**4. Killer Rākṣasa Type (*gsod byed srin po'i ris*):**
- Accord with pretas (hungry ghosts)
- Man-eating demons
**Additional Classes:**
- Cruel Māra type (*rtsub 'gyur bdud kyi ris*)
- Cloth-beautiful type (*thags bzangs ris*)
- Equal to Paranirmitavaśavartin in enjoyment type
**Doxographical Note:** This classification shows the hierarchical nature of the demigod realm, parallel to but distinct from the god realm, with beings ranging from nearly divine to nearly hellish in their characteristics.
**Structural Completion:** Having enumerated all six desire heavens and four asura classes, Longchenpa has completed the survey of the upper realms. He will now turn to the lower realms (animals, pretas, hells) and then to human existence.
**Analysis:**
**Reclassification:** The demon class (*bdud ris*) is included in the god class (*lha ris su bsdus nas*), leaving only four titan classes (*lha min ris bzhi*).
**Doxographical Note:** This reflects the standard Buddhist classification where asuras can be counted as either:
- A separate sixth realm (making seven total)
- Part of the god realm (maintaining six realms)
- Part of the animal or preta realms in some traditions
**Lifespan Reference:** The Thirty-three gods' lifespan is used as the comparative standard.
**Analysis:**
**Setting:** *'dzam bu'i gling bsod nams khyad par can gyi sa pa* — The excellent merit ground of Jambu continent
**First Humans:** Two god-sons from clear light (*'od gsal las lha'i bu gnyis*) born miraculously (*rdzus skyes*) from lotuses.
**Names:**
- *nyi ma rab tu snang byed* — Sun Greatly-Illuminating
- *zla ba dri med* — Moon Stainless
**Arising Process:**
1. After formation of beings up to Four Great Kings
2. Two god-sons fall from clear light to Jambudvīpa
3. Upon immeasurable lotuses of beautiful light-appearance
4. Their minds greatly moved (*yid rab tu g.yos pa*)
5. Space-seed parts manifest as condition
6. Miraculous birth god-sons expand
**Dzogchen Connection:** This narrative parallels Dzogchen cosmogony where beings arise from the clear light nature of mind (*'od gsal*) through spontaneous display.
**Analysis:**
**Extraordinary Powers of Primordial Humans:**
1. **Transportation:**
- Go through sky when traveling
- Sit in sky when dwelling
- *'gro na yang nam mkha' la 'gro* / *'dug na yang nam mkha' la 'dug*
2. **Nourishment:**
- Food is meditation (*bsam gtan*)
- Dwell in joy-bliss (*dga' bde la spyod*)
3. **Radiance:**
- Body extends immeasurable light rays (*'od zer gyi tshogs dpag tu med pa 'phro*)
4. **Teletransportation:**
- Arrive wherever merely thought (*gang du bsam pa der phyin*)
5. **Lifespan:**
- Immeasurable years (*tshe lo yang dpag med thub*)
6. **Purity:**
- No afflictions manifestly move (*nyon mongs pa mngon du rgyu gang yang med pa*)
**Philosophical Significance:** This "golden age" description represents humanity in its primordial purity before the decline into coarse material existence—analogous to the Dzogchen concept of primordial purity (*ka dag*).
**Analysis:**
**Variant Sources:**
- Some tantras (*rgyud 'ga' las*) say humans expanded from Joy Possess (*dga' ldan*)
- Some (*la la nas*) say from Four Great Kings (*rgyal chen bzhi*)
**Longchenpa's Resolution:**
- The two first chiefs (*thogs ma'i gtso bo de gnyis*) fell from clear light
- Below them, [beings fell from] Joy Possess, Four Great Kings, and other upper [realms]
- All miraculously born here (*'dir rdzus te skyes pa*)
**Hermeneutical Principle:** All views are non-contradictory (*thams cad kyi ltar 'gal ba med par*) because beings fell from multiple upper realms at different times.
**Analysis:**
**Place Name:** *dga' ldan brtsegs pa* (Tuṣita Pile/Mound)
**Etymological Explanation:**
- *snang ba 'od kyi longs spyod bsam gyis mi khyab pa* — Inconceivable light-appearance enjoyment
- *rig pa ting nge 'dzin gyi dga' bde dpag tu med pa* — Immeasurable awareness-concentration joy-bliss
**Grammar Note:** *brtsegs pa* (pile/mound/accumulation) indicates abundance and layered excellence.
**Doxographical Connection:** This connects to the heaven called Tuṣita (*dga' ldan*) mentioned earlier, suggesting the first human realm mirrored the divine realm in its qualities.
**Analysis:**
**The Sixth Teacher:** *ston pa drug pa* — The sixth in the series of cosmic teachers
**Identity:** *rdo rje 'chang nyid* — Vajra Holder (Vajradhara) himself
**Function:** *'gro ba de dag 'dul ba* — Taming/disciplining those beings
**Buddhist Cosmology Context:** In Buddhist cosmology, there are typically "seven Buddhas of antiquity" or multiple teachers who appear in different world-cycles. Vajradhara as the sixth teacher represents the highest tantric enlightenment principle.
**Transition:** Having established the origin and golden age of humanity, Longchenpa will now describe the gradual decline into the present condition of human existence.
