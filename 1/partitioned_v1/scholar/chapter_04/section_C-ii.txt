[8065-8143] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom Gnosis Empowerment Categories
From the tantra:
1. **Outer**: Sentient beings' appearances sent outward (*sems can snang ba phyi ltar bskur*)
2. **Inner**: Meditation, mind-holding inwardly (*sgom pa sems 'dzin nang ltar bskur*)
3. **Secret**: Recognition's twenty-one introductions (*ngo 'phrod nyi shu rtsa gcig*) matched to faculties, exemplified meaning and signs
Plus: Isolated awareness self-clear as five lights (*rig pa rkyang pa 'od lnga rang gsal*)
And: East-liberated, without frame, Great Perfection transcending acceptance/rejection/effort (*shar grol ris med rdzogs pa chen po spang blang bya rtsol las 'das*)
**Accomplished Guru Distinction:**
Accomplished gurus can complete empowerment with single isolated piece or lump—whatever is said is accomplished.
Unaccomplished gurus must combine all and confer to accomplish meaning.
**Empowerment Four Classification:**
1. Vase empowerment (*bum dbang*): colored powder maṇḍala, deities, vase, student preparation, auspicious eight substances, royal seven, peaceful/wrathful *cakrā*/image/statue, vajra name, command sign (*bka' rtags*), seal empowerment (*phyag rgya*), action completion
2. Secret empowerment (*gsang dbang*): giving two bodhicittas
3. Wisdom-gnosis empowerment (*shes rab ye shes*): attachment-free seal visualization, merely recognizing seal, attachment-possessing actual consort activity
4. Word empowerment (*tshig dbang*): realization wisdom, view, meditation, awareness
[8144-8191] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of Consort Terms
**Rig pa (Awareness) Definitions:**
- Awareness wisdom directly recognized (*rig pa'i ye shes mngon sum du rig pas na rig pa*)
**Ma (Mother) Etymology:**
- Worldly: Nothing exists without depending on mother
- Dharmic: Like earth ground—no Buddha arises without depending on consort mother
**Alternative: Gzungs ma (Retention):**
- Mind's bliss retention depends on body
- Holding increases body retention
**Sky-like Mother:**
- Like space—no world-system exists without depending on space
**Phyag rgya ma (Seal):**
- *Phyag* = holding—from cyclic existence to Buddhahold
- *Rgya* = sealing—sealing cyclic existence with enlightenment
- *Ma* = sustenance—like food, without food, death; without seal consort, realization doesn't arise
**Five-fold Classification:**
1. Outer five (*phy'i rigs lnga*)
2. Inner five (*nang gi lnga*)
3. Secret five (*gsang ba'i lnga*)
4. Perfect two (*yongs rdzogs kyi gnyis*)
- Total: seventeen (*bchu bdun*)
[8192-8253] [CONTEXT] Consort Lineage Classifications
**Outer Lineages:**
- Royal lineage: Tathāgata family Buddhas
- Noble lineage: Vajra family
- Commoner lineage: Jewel family
- Brahmin: Lotus family
- Outcaste: Karma family Buddhas
Not that any single Buddha family suffices—all five lineages needed with corresponding consorts.
**Inner Lineages:**
- Yakṣa daughters
- Goddess daughters
- Nāga daughters
- Brahmā daughters
- Śakra daughters
These are karma mudrā lineages.
**Historical Example:**
Kośala master Śrī-heruka invoked Brahmā, Śakra, etc.'s daughters for empowerment and achieved siddhi.
**Secret Lineages:**
Fivefold classification (*rigs can lnga*):
1. Conch-bearing (*dung can ma*): black hair, good teeth, beautiful locks
2. Elephant-nose (*glang sna can ma*): bad hair, extra front teeth
3. Lotus (*padma can*): yellow hair, right spiral
4. Deer (*ri dwags can*): bad hair, large forehead prominence
5. Cow (*ba glang can ma*): beautiful hair, vertical forehead wrinkles
[8254-8296] [CONCEPT] Consort Functions and Wisdom
**Lotus-bearer Special Function:**
Produces superior bliss and serves as companion for clear dharmatā—like lotus blooming/non-blooming, main instruction is opening channel mouth.
**Deer Special Function:**
Thin channels entering like King Añjana's deer leg—channel-lengthening instruction essential.
**Elephant-nose Function:**
Like elephant trunk spiraling upward—summoning instruction essential.
**Cow Function:**
Channels latent in mind without sound—channel-taming instruction essential.
**Conch Function:**
Like right-spiraling conch—channel-squeezing instruction essential.
**Wisdom Results:**
All five produce five wisdoms' lineage holding.
For bliss path, Lotus-bearer surpasses all.
**Actual Bodhicitta:**
Women don't produce actual red bodhicitta (blocked by five lineages); men produce bindu through five lineages but not actual red bodhicitta—channel mouth doesn't change.
**Channel Functions:**
Channels flow upward—right nostril bleeds at youth's maturity, those without body element diseases.
**Lineage Accomplishments:**
- Deer: body enhancing activities
- Conch: speech enhancing
- Elephant-nose: mind enhancing
- Cow: consciousness enhancing
- Lotus: bliss body expanding
From *Dbang bkod chen po*:
"All women are five lineages—this arrangement is great bliss, yogins' siddhi completion."
**Perfect Lineages:**
1. Common siddhi-producing lineage (ordinary)
2. Supreme siddhi-producing lineage (ḍākinī sky-goer)
**Ordinary:**

[8515-8585] [STRUCTURE] Bodhicitta Production and Bindu Refinement
**Bodhicitta Production Sequence:**
From *Dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*:
"From secret lotus place
Bodhicitta born upward
Secret vajra hole
Mix with bodhicitta"
Four stages:
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): Entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Supreme joy** (*mchog dga'*): Wisdom wind held
3. **Non-joy** (*dga' bral*): Thought-free, beyond joy/sorrow
4. **Co-emergent joy** (*lhan cig skyes pa'i dga' ba*): Bliss-emptiness inseparable
**Bindu Refinement Process:**
Five lineages' bodhicitta—refinement three times:
- First: channel mouth sealed, bliss generated
- Second: bindu held, channels expand
- Third: wisdom wind enters central channel
From *Sgyu 'phrul*:
"Bodhicitta bindu refinement
Supreme and common qualities
Whatever desired in mind
This certainly accomplishes"
**Channel Locations:**
- Root: Dharmakāya bliss
- Waist: Saṃbhogakāya bliss
- Tip: Nirmāṇakāya bliss
[8586-8668] [PHILOLOGY] Three Vajras Integration
Through three syllables (*sku gsung thugs kyi yi ge gsum*) creating three vajras:
- *Oṃ* creates vajra: body three kāyas unified (*sku gsum gcig tu 'dril*)
- *Āḥ* generates bodhicitta: speech vajra—unspeakable, invisible, inconceivable speech unified
- *Hūṃ* creates vase: mind vajra—Dharmakāya's non-conceptual, non-thinking; Saṃbhogakāya's non-distracted; Nirmāṇakāya's manifold knowledge unified
This unifies inexhaustible body, speech, mind ornament maṇḍala wheel.
**Bindu Refinement Process:**
Holding vajra tip with three vajra body, speech, mind syllables:
- Produces three bliss results sequentially and instantaneously
Mother's E creates lotus—great bliss body seal
*Hrīḥ* creates lotus bell—great bliss speech seal
*Ha* creates lotus anther—great bliss mind seal
This liberates body, speech, mind bonds—"self-liberated great seal" (*rang grol phyag rgya chen po*).
**Phat and Hrīḥ Sealing:**
- Phat sealing lotus opening: great bliss wind released into spontaneous presence
- Hrīḥ sealing vajra opening: enjoying great bliss essence
From *Snga ma*:
"Body, speech, mind great vajra
Three seals joined in lotus center
For refining bodhicitta, Hrīḥ seals skillfully
Not releasing wisdom, Phat seals opening"
**Three-fold Refinement:**
Three vajra mind refinements from vajra tip to waist:
- Body channels expand
- From there to root: mind expands into great bliss
- From there to navel: body-mind non-dual bliss expands
[8669-8696] [CONTEXT] Bliss Generation Sequence and View Integration
**Four Seals:**
1. **Action seal** (*las kyi phyag rgya*): Outer body refinement, effortless four activities
2. **Commitment seal** (*dam tshig gi phyag rgya*): Waist refinement, stainless four wisdoms' commitment inseparable
3. **Dharma seal** (*chos kyi phyag rgya*): Tip refinement, enjoying general/specific characteristics
4. **Great seal** (*phyag rgya chen po*): Holding bindu itself—bliss-emptiness non-dual non-abiding
**Bliss Generation Sequence:**
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Sensation** (*tshor ba*): enjoying resultant after experience
3. **Bliss** (*bde ba*): mind and wisdom disturbed time
4. **Experience** (*myong ba*): mind and wisdom inseparable
5. **Emptiness** (*stong pa*): neither mind nor wisdom distinguished, transcending extremes and distinctions
From *Snga ma*:
"First joy alone
Second sensation, contact, experience
Third called bliss
Fourth experience co-emergent
Fifth called emptiness"
**View Integration:**
Not time for actual consort method, root-generation—ordinary desire without mental fabrication. View-oscillation time: self-body dependent bliss generated without mental control.
Through actual body refinement, holding bodhicitta, refined/unrefined time—extraordinary bliss arises, experience not mixed with mental fabrication. Only knowing mind as mere emptiness. When ordinary conceptions absent in mind—obtained view time.
Refined bodhicitta arriving at holding measure—channels spread, body-mind non-dual great seal beyond mind experienced. View stabilization time: however done, power over bodhicitta, no change/transformation.
[8697-8755] [CONCEPT] Postures, Signs, and Benefits
**Postures for Channel Mouth Sealing:**
1. Lion's leap (*seng ge'i mchongs stabs*)
2. Leg/arm joints contracted—cuts cyclic existence root
3. Chest space thrown—wind-mind union key point
4. Eyes forcefully drawn—wisdom gate opening key point
5. Intestines curved—body bliss definite liberation key point
6. Long Hūṃ recitation—wind-mind dharmatā union key point
7. Occasional E sound—dharmatā purity result key point
**Bindu Three Locations:**
- Root held: Dharmakāya bliss experienced
- Waist held: Saṃbhogakāya bliss experienced
- Tip held: Nirmāṇakāya bliss experienced
**Refinement Benefits:**
- Channel expansion: diseases don't arise
- Wind expansion: samādhi arises
- Can walk without feet touching ground
- See body's atoms as vajra
- Fly in space
- Life equal to sun and moon
- Free from food/clothing attachment
Conventional bodhicitta benefits.
**Ultimate Bodhicitta Benefits:**
- Special transference (*'pho ba khyad par can*) practice
- Consciousness entering other's city
From *Dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*:
"Refining bodhicitta bindu
Supreme and common qualities
Whatever desired in mind
This certainly accomplishes."
**Holding Measure:**
Bindu falling into bhaga but wind-power returning to mother's bindu—not escaping measure.
[8756-8823] [STRUCTURE] Empowerment Classifications Summary
**Four Empowerments' Definite Divisions:**
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): enters faithful mind through elaborated
2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): shows inner entry method
3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): mind-change entering path for concept purification

- Perfect (*yongs rdzogs*)
Results in 16 variations for each of four empowerments = 64 total, showing extensive classification system.
**Purification Purpose:**
With elaboration's 16 purify outer four elements' four each = 16
Body, speech, mind, consciousness purified through four empowerments matched to three kāyas = 12
Completing 16-fold purification of karmic and afflictive obscurations.
[8824-8853] [PHILOLOGY] Four Empowerments' Ripening Power
Four empowerments' ripening time ripening signs impure and pure two included—gathered into space and field two.
Attachment, hatred, neutral three, time three gathered—body, speech, mind three ripening activity liberated.
Samsara-nirvana dharmas contaminated, uncontaminated two empowered—two arisen:
- Empowerment over appearance purifies aggregates, constituents, sense-bases, etc.
- Empowerment over existence purifies afflictions
With elaboration shows body, speech, mind, consciousness four entering activities.
Without elaboration shows four: obtaining, abiding, stabilizing, closely realizing.
Greatly without elaboration shows four causes/conditions of body, speech, mind, consciousness ripening.
Utterly without elaboration shows four: three doors matured into deity body, speech, mind and engaging in inexpressible meaning.
**Four Empowerments' Ripening Example:**
Like good field sown with faultless seeds ripening fruit—first with elaboration empowerment sows seed, without elaboration sprout emerges and leaves spread, greatly without elaboration flower blooms, utterly without elaboration four bodies definite fruit ripens.
[8854-8912] [CONTEXT] Individual Nature Empowerments
**With Elaboration Power Classification:**
With elaboration from body, etc., gatherings purifies and joins to body vajra.
Thus:
- Body deity purified
- Speech mantra purified
- Mind samādhi purified
- Consciousness dharmatā purified
Without elaboration: outer appearance's entity delusion ceases.
Greatly without elaboration: joins to four activities.
Utterly without elaboration: body bliss, speech clear, mind non-conceptual, consciousness non-dual power possessing.
