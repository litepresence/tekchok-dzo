[7799-7873] [STRUCTURE] Four Empowerment Classifications
[7799-7818] **Four Empowerment Types:**
From *Thal 'gyur*:
1. With elaboration (*spras bcas*)
2. Without elaboration (*spras med*)
3. Greatly without elaboration (*shin tu spras med*)
4. Utterly without elaboration (*rab tu spras med*)
Purpose: To mature faithful beings' continuums (*dad ldan rang rgyud smin pa*).
[7819-7873] **Progressive Purification:**
The four empowerments progressively purify:
- Outer: seasons (*dpyid, dbyar, ston, dgun*)
- Inner: body, speech, mind, consciousness (*lus, ngag, yid, sems*)
- Secret: ignorance, anger, desire, equanimity (*gti mug, zhe sdang, 'dod chags, cha mnyam*)
- Perfection: four perfect empowerments (*bum pa, gsang ba, shes rab ye shes, tshig dbang*)
These purify the four collections (*tshogs pa bzhi*) leading to four paths (*lam bzhi*):
- Accumulation (*tshogs*)
- Application (*sbyor*)
- Seeing (*mthong*)
- Meditation (*bsgom*)
Resulting in four bodies (*sku bzhi*):
- Nirmāṇakaya (*sprul sku*)
- Saṃbhogakaya (*longs sku*)
- Dharmakaya (*chos sku*)
- Svābhāvikakāya (*ngo bo nyid kyi sku*)

Each has outer, inner, secret, and perfect (four each = twelve total):
- Outer: benefiting and establishing power
- Inner: producing great qualities
- Secret: past, future, present empowering
- Perfect: ripening, completing, reversing, healing
[7936-8010] [CONTEXT] Mahāyoga and Anuyoga Empowerments
**Mahāyoga:**
- Water, crown, vajra, bell conferral
- Accomplishing resultant bodhicitta through power over bliss
**Anuyoga:**
- Called "secret empowerment" (*gsang ba'i dbang*)
- Inner empowerment (*nang gi dbang*)
- Engaging with consort (*rig ma*) through yoga
- Enjoying conventional bodhicitta
**Atiyoga Dzogchen With Elaboration:**
Seven special substances (*khyad par gyi rdzas bdun*):
1. Peacock feather (*rma bya*)
2. Mirror (*me long*)
3. Arrow (*mda'*)
4. Sword (*ral gri*)
5. Body *cakrā* (*sku tsakali*)
6. Speech letters (*gsung yi 'bru*)
7. Mind attributes (*thugs phyag mtshan*)

- Eight auspicious substances (*bkra shis rdzas brgyad*) for desired purposes
- Seven jewels with outer universal monarch ablution (*phyi rgyal thabs spyi blugs*)
- Inner wisdom ablution (*nang ye shes spyi blugs*) for power over mind and wisdom
[8011-8064] [CONCEPT] Unelaborated and Wisdom Empowerments
**Without Elaboration:**
Five nectars (*bdud rtsi lnga*):
1. *Bhaṇḍa*
2. Small drum (*rngew chung*)
3. Skull cup (*thod pa*)
4. Five meats (*sha lnga*)
5. Five jewels (*rin po che lnga*)
Plus special empowerment body (*dbang chen gyi sku*) and supreme seven substances—cutting inner seven existence wheels.
**Seven Nectar Substances:**
- *Sindhūra*
- Mirror with handle
- Right-spiraling conch
- Unbroken skull cup
- Five bone ornaments
- Great ash (*thal chen*)
- Yogi's dried provisions
**Great Seal (*phyag rgya chen po*) Liberation:**
Through three vajras (*sku gsung thugs kyi yi ge gsum*) of body, speech, mind:
- Three bliss results (*bde gsum gyi 'bras bu*)
- Sequential and instantaneous methods
Mother's E creates lotus—great bliss body's seal
*Hrīḥ* creates lotus bell—great bliss speech seal
*Ha* creates lotus anther—great bliss mind seal
This liberates body, speech, mind bonds into self-liberation.
**Phat and Hūṃ Sealing:**
- Phat sealing lotus opening: great bliss wind released into spontaneous presence
- Hrīḥ sealing vajra opening: enjoying great bliss essence
- From *Snga ma*:
"Vajra of body, speech, mind—great vajra
Three seals joined in lotus center
For refining bodhicitta, Hrīḥ seals skillfully
Not releasing wisdom, Phat seals opening"
[8065-8143] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom Gnosis Empowerment Categories
[8065-8092] **Threefold Wisdom Gnosis Empowerment:**
From the tantra:
1. **Outer**: Sentient beings' appearances sent outward (*sems can snang ba phyi ltar bskur*)
2. **Inner**: Meditation, mind-holding inwardly (*sgom pa sems 'dzin nang ltar bskur*)
3. **Secret**: Recognition's twenty-one introductions (*ngo 'phrod nyi shu rtsa gcig*) matched to faculties, exemplified meaning and signs
Plus: Isolated awareness self-clear as five lights (*rig pa rkyang pa 'od lnga rang gsal*)
And: East-liberated, without frame, Great Perfection transcending acceptance/rejection/effort (*shar grol ris med rdzogs pa chen po spang blang bya rtsol las 'das*)
[8093-8143] **Accomplished Guru Distinction:**
Accomplished gurus can complete empowerment with single isolated piece or lump—whatever is said is accomplished.
Unaccomplished gurus must combine all and confer to accomplish meaning.
**Empowerment Four Classification:**
1. Vase empowerment (*bum dbang*): colored powder maṇḍala, deities, vase, student preparation, auspicious eight substances, royal seven, peaceful/wrathful *cakrā*/image/statue, vajra name, command sign (*bka' rtags*), seal empowerment (*phyag rgya*), action completion
2. Secret empowerment (*gsang dbang*): giving two bodhicittas
3. Wisdom-gnosis empowerment (*shes rab ye shes*): attachment-free seal visualization, merely recognizing seal, attachment-possessing actual consort activity
4. Word empowerment (*tshig dbang*): realization wisdom, view, meditation, awareness
[8144-8191] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of Consort Terms
**Rig pa (Awareness) Definitions:**
- Awareness wisdom directly recognized (*rig pa'i ye shes mngon sum du rig pas na rig pa*)
**Ma (Mother) Etymology:**
- Worldly: Nothing exists without depending on mother
- Dharmic: Like earth ground—no Buddha arises without depending on consort mother
**Alternative: Gzungs ma (Retention):**
- Mind's bliss retention depends on body
- Holding increases body retention
**Sky-like Mother:**
- Like space—no world-system exists without depending on space
**Phyag rgya ma (Seal):**
- *Phyag* = holding—from cyclic existence to Buddhahold
- *Rgya* = sealing—sealing cyclic existence with enlightenment
- *Ma* = sustenance—like food, without food, death; without seal consort, realization doesn't arise
**Five-fold Classification:**
1. Outer five (*phy'i rigs lnga*)
2. Inner five (*nang gi lnga*)
3. Secret five (*gsang ba'i lnga*)
4. Perfect two (*yongs rdzogs kyi gnyis*)
- Total: seventeen (*bchu bdun*)
[8192-8253] [CONTEXT] Consort Lineage Classifications
**Outer Lineages:**
- Royal lineage: Tathāgata family Buddhas
- Noble lineage: Vajra family
- Commoner lineage: Jewel family
- Brahmin: Lotus family
- Outcaste: Karma family Buddhas
Not that any single Buddha family suffices—all five lineages needed with corresponding consorts.
**Inner Lineages:**
- Yakṣa daughters
- Goddess daughters
- Nāga daughters
- Brahmā daughters
- Śakra daughters
These are karma mudrā lineages.
**Historical Example:**
Kośala master Śrī-heruka invoked Brahmā, Śakra, etc.'s daughters for empowerment and achieved siddhi.
**Secret Lineages:**
Fivefold classification (*rigs can lnga*):
1. Conch-bearing (*dung can ma*): black hair, good teeth, beautiful locks
2. Elephant-nose (*glang sna can ma*): bad hair, extra front teeth
3. Lotus (*padma can*): yellow hair, right spiral
4. Deer (*ri dwags can*): bad hair, large forehead prominence
5. Cow (*ba glang can ma*): beautiful hair, vertical forehead wrinkles
[8254-8296] [CONCEPT] Consort Functions and Wisdom
**Lotus-bearer Special Function:**
Produces superior bliss and serves as companion for clear dharmatā—like lotus blooming/non-blooming, main instruction is opening channel mouth.
**Deer Special Function:**
Thin channels entering like King Añjana's deer leg—channel-lengthening instruction essential.
**Elephant-nose Function:**
Like elephant trunk spiraling upward—summoning instruction essential.
**Cow Function:**
Channels latent in mind without sound—channel-taming instruction essential.
**Conch Function:**
Like right-spiraling conch—channel-squeezing instruction essential.
**Wisdom Results:**
All five produce five wisdoms' lineage holding.
For bliss path, Lotus-bearer surpasses all.
**Actual Bodhicitta:**
Women don't produce actual red bodhicitta (blocked by five lineages); men produce bindu through five lineages but not actual red bodhicitta—channel mouth doesn't change.
**Channel Functions:**
Channels flow upward—right nostril bleeds at youth's maturity, those without body element diseases.
**Lineage Accomplishments:**
- Deer: body enhancing activities
- Conch: speech enhancing
- Elephant-nose: mind enhancing
- Cow: consciousness enhancing
- Lotus: bliss body expanding
From *Dbang bkod chen po*:
"All women are five lineages—this arrangement is great bliss, yogins' siddhi completion."
**Perfect Lineages:**
1. Common siddhi-producing lineage (ordinary)
2. Supreme siddhi-producing lineage (ḍākinī sky-goer)
**Ordinary:**
- Wide eyes
- Right-spiraling hair

[8473-8545] [CONCEPT] Channel Characteristics and Yoga
**Five Lineage Channels:**
Three types each: long, short, medium
**Long:**
Produces superior bliss from outside—extraordinary bliss generation
**Short:**
Covered/blunted mouth—short-duration bliss
**Medium:**
Like taste—should be understood accordingly
**Bodhicitta Expansion Methods:**
Five root preparations:
1. Lamb-throat composition (*lug thug gi tshang ra*)
2. Sparrow beak meat (*bye'u rgya mchil gyi sha*)
3. *Dbyid*
4. Molasses
5. Mix and eat seven pellets—expands
Or: *Ram nye*, *mu zi*, *ldong ros* with beer, made into pills—also expands.
**Consort Training:**
Explain cause-effect Dharma
Teach saṃsāra/nirvāṇa bliss/suffering
Give empowerment, establish vows/commitments
**Bliss Generation Method:**
- Slowly heat sun
- Make naked, bathe with fragrant water
- Apply scent bindus to three places
- Touch, ear with fingernail
- Press thirteenth spine joint
- Embrace without actual union
- Kiss
- Urge with "sṛi" sound
- Bone ornaments on body
- Sing lotus songs
- Lotus pistil bindu network
- Also six other places with bindus
From *Snga ma*:
"Thus in uninhabited house, naked, without clothes, examine."
**Channel Search and Holding:**
Instructions for arousing channels:
- Breast pressing
- Throat bindu network with bodhicitta bindu
- Speaking *ha ha hi hi ho ho*
- Various bile bindus on head
- Sixth left rib pressing with ring finger
This causes all channels to arise.
**Holding Key Points:**
- Vajra tip: dog excrement, *jāti* powder, *sindhūra*
- Applied: channel cannot escape
- Visualize self as yab-yum deity, vajra-lotus union
From *Hevajra*:
"Vajra-lotus joined—bliss surpasses."
From *Snga ma*:
"Wisdom place—arouse channels
For bodhicitta—hold channels"
[8546-8629] [STRUCTURE] Great Seal Liberation and Bindu Refinement
[8546-8586] **Three Vajras Integration:**
Through three syllables (*sku gsung thugs kyi yi ge gsum*) creating three vajras:
- *Oṃ* creates vajra: body three kāyas unified (*sku gsum gcig tu 'dril*)
- *Āḥ* generates bodhicitta: speech vajra—unspeakable, invisible, inconceivable speech unified
- *Hūṃ* creates vase: mind vajra—Dharmakāya's non-conceptual, non-thinking; Saṃbhogakāya's non-distracted; Nirmāṇakāya's manifold knowledge unified
This unifies inexhaustible body, speech, mind ornament maṇḍala wheel.
[8587-8629] **Bindu Refinement Process:**
Holding vajra tip with three vajra body, speech, mind syllables:
- Produces three bliss results sequentially and instantaneously
Mother's E creates lotus—great bliss body seal
*Hrīḥ* creates lotus bell—great bliss speech seal
*Ha* creates lotus anther—great bliss mind seal
This liberates body, speech, mind bonds—"self-liberated great seal" (*rang grol phyag rgya chen po*).
**Phat and Hrīḥ Sealing:**
- Phat sealing lotus opening: great bliss wind released into spontaneous presence
- Hrīḥ sealing vajra opening: enjoying great bliss essence
From *Snga ma*:
"Body, speech, mind great vajra
Three seals joined in lotus center
For refining bodhicitta, Hrīḥ seals skillfully
Not releasing wisdom, Phat seals opening"
**Three-fold Refinement:**
Three vajra mind refinements from vajra tip to waist:
- Body channels expand
- From there to root: mind expands into great bliss
- From there to navel: body-mind non-dual bliss expands
**Four Seals:**
1. **Action seal** (*las kyi phyag rgya*): Outer body refinement, effortless four activities
2. **Commitment seal** (*dam tshig gi phyag rgya*): Waist refinement, stainless four wisdoms' commitment inseparable
3. **Dharma seal** (*chos kyi phyag rgya*): Tip refinement, enjoying general/specific characteristics
4. **Great seal** (*phyag rgya chen po*): Holding bindu itself—bliss-emptiness non-dual non-abiding
[8630-8704] [PHILOLOGY] Refinement Signs and Benefits
**Refinement Benefits:**
- Channel expansion: diseases don't arise
- Wind expansion: samādhi arises
- Can walk without feet touching ground
- See body's atoms as vajra
- Fly in space
- Life equal to sun and moon
- Free from food/clothing attachment
Conventional bodhicitta benefits.
**Ultimate Bodhicitta Benefits:**
- Special transference (*'pho ba khyad par can*) practice
- Consciousness entering other's city
From *Dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*:
"Refining bodhicitta bindu
Supreme and common qualities
Whatever desired in mind
This certainly accomplishes."
**Holding Measure:**
Bindu falling into bhaga but wind-power returning to mother's bindu—not escaping measure.
**Bliss Generation Sequence:**
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Sensation** (*tshor ba*): enjoying resultant after experience
3. **Bliss** (*bde ba*): mind and wisdom disturbed time
4. **Experience** (*myong ba*): mind and wisdom inseparable
5. **Emptiness** (*stong pa*): neither mind nor wisdom distinguished, transcending extremes and distinctions
From *Snga ma*:
"First joy alone
Second sensation, contact, experience
Third called bliss
Fourth experience co-emergent
Fifth called emptiness"
[8705-8755] [CONTEXT] View Stabilization and Physical Postures
**View Integration:**
Not time for actual consort method, root-generation—ordinary desire without mental fabrication. View-oscillation time: self-body dependent bliss generated without mental control.
Through actual body refinement, holding bodhicitta, refined/unrefined time—extraordinary bliss arises, experience not mixed with mental fabrication. Only knowing mind as mere emptiness. When ordinary conceptions absent in mind—obtained view time.
Refined bodhicitta arriving at holding measure—channels spread, body-mind non-dual great seal beyond mind experienced. View stabilization time: however done, power over bodhicitta, no change/transformation.
**Postures for Channel Mouth Sealing:**
1. Lion's leap (*seng ge'i mchongs stabs*)
2. Leg/arm joints contracted—cuts cyclic existence root
3. Chest space thrown—wind-mind union key point
4. Eyes forcefully drawn—wisdom gate opening key point
5. Intestines curved—body bliss definite liberation key point
6. Long Hūṃ recitation—wind-mind dharmatā union key point
7. Occasional E sound—dharmatā purity result key point
**Bindu Three Locations:**
- Root held: Dharmakāya bliss experienced
- Waist held: Saṃbhogakāya bliss experienced
- Tip held: Nirmāṇakāya bliss experienced
[8756-8821] [CONCEPT] Empowerment Classifications Summary
**Four Empowerments' Definite Divisions:**
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): enters faithful mind through elaborated
2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): shows inner entry method
3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): mind-change entering path for concept purification
4. **Utterly without elaboration** (*rab tu spras med*): produces special realization, obtains non-dual meaning
**Sixteen-fold Self-nature Divisions:**
Each empowerment divided into:
- Self (*rang*)
- Other (*gzhan*)
- Outer (*phyi*)
- Inner (*nang*)
- Secret (*gsang*)
- Perfect (*yongs rdzogs*)
Results in 16 variations for each of four empowerments = 64 total, showing extensive classification system.
**Purification Purpose:**
With elaboration's 16 purify outer four elements' four each = 16
Body, speech, mind, consciousness purified through four empowerments matched to three kāyas = 12
Completing 16-fold purification of karmic and afflictive obscurations.
[6801-6845] [STRUCTURE] Teacher and Student Qualifications Framework

1. Doesn't honor guru with respect
2. Practices revealing secrets
3. Without lineage, without good disposition
4. Little wisdom
5. Considers kindness trivial
6. Discusses own lineage
7. Adorns body with good ornaments
8. Becomes hollow without meaning
"Unexamined student is guru's demon
For person not taking into practice
Great Perfection meaning not explained"
[6899-6950] [CONTEXT] Guru-Student Relationship and Practice
[6900-6911] **Common Practice:**
- Guru regards student with compassion, timely benefit, Dharma, even food/drink
- Student contemplates guru's qualities with unceasing yearning respect and faith
From *Rang shar*:
"Compassion's connection not severed
Yearning unceasing
Is guru-student relationship"
[6912-6950] **Supplication Method:**
From *Thal 'gyur*:
"To one with individual characteristics complete
Royal sovereignty and own body
Retinue and enjoyments support

- For years (five, seven, three, etc.) previously offering maṇḍala of gold to guru
- At session start of virtuous practice, guru yoga day and night, six times
- Guru grants permission for obstacles removal and purification
Benefits: Body matures as deity's form, speech as *āli-kāli*'s self-sound, mind as emptiness free from conception.
[6951-7057] [CONCEPT] Empowerment Benefits and Location
[6951-7011] **Benefits of Receiving Empowerment:**
From *Rang shar*:
"Qualities of empowerment thus:
To great wisdom light
Without obstruction
Self-appearance shown as companion
All activities accomplished"
From *Dbang rin po che'i rgyud*:
"Guru abandoning desire
Completing empowerment ritual
According to sequence conferred
Even to great vajra holder
In this life definitely becomes"
From *Gsang snying*:
"With five essence empowerments conferred
From this time forward Buddha's son
All lower realms absent
High liberation's lord becomes"
Special benefits: Recognizes self-appearance in bardo, stabilizes therein, can emanate nirmāṇakāya for twenty-one days. For faculties' perfection, suffering, fear, etc., don't arise. During practice, wisdom light appears unceasingly.
Common benefits: Understands ḍākinīs' speech, blessed as honored by humans, loving-kindness to all beings, beautiful form, great merit increase, after death takes cakravartin body, great qualities arise like wish-fulfilling jewel, practices pure Dharma like lotus, circumambulated like stūpa, overpowers beings like parasol, liberates with wisdom like fire, benefits like sword, holds beings with compassion like vajra hook, realizes dharmadhātu wisdom inseparability like Dharma cloud.
[7012-7039] **Faults of Not Receiving Empowerment:**
From *Sgyu 'phrul gsang snying*:
"Not pleasing guru
Not obtaining empowerments
Listening, etc., beginning endeavors
Fruitless and lost"
From *Dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud*:
"Without depending on secret mantra empowerment, accomplishment won't occur
Like one without hand-ears
Cannot cross to river's other side"
From *Rang shar*:
"Faults of not obtaining empowerment thus:
In bardo, wandering
Fear
Obstruction
Hindrance
Consciousness lost
Until impregnated karmic body not abandoned
Not seen as worthy of honor by beings
Little merit
Short life
Few enjoyments
Narrow mouth
Many obstacles occur
All activities unaccomplished
This is fault of secret mantra practitioner not obtaining empowerment"
Without empowerment, even Buddha cannot turn Dharma wheel at Tathāgata level; without turning wheel, compassion's emanation body cannot benefit beings.
[7040-7057] **Location for Empowerment:**
Isolated, delightful, near accomplishment places. Generally auspicious with good earth-examination, good forests, etc.
Specific locations:
- With elaboration: student's body-element—south-facing if earth, east-facing if water, west-facing if fire, north-facing if wind
- Without elaboration: thick forest, charnel ground, mountain ravine according to student's element
- Greatly without elaboration: excellent is peak of mountain where three valleys meet
- Utterly without elaboration: extremely isolated or hermitage—one *rgyang grags* from village
All four empowerment places: others fear, wild beasts dwell, poisonous snakes, charnel grounds, *spyang gi*—excellent charnel ground with very fierce ḍākinīs.

2. Practicing revealing secret mantras
3. Without lineage, without good disposition
4. Become of little wisdom
5. Considering kindness trivial
6. Discussing own lineage
7. Adorning body with good ornaments
8. Becoming hollow without meaning
From *Rang shar*:
"Unexamined student is guru's demon
For person not taking into practice
Great Perfection meaning not explained"
[6886-6898] [CONTEXT] Vessel Analogy
Bad vessel cannot hold good essence—like lion's milk cannot be held in clay vessel. If poured, Dharma's greatness deteriorates and that bad vessel goes to lower realms. Therefore secrets must be kept from such bad vessels.
From *De nyid*:
"Essence of Great Perfection instructions
Don't pour into bad vessels generally
If poured into bad vessels
Both essence and vessel destroyed
Therefore keep from inferior intellects"
[6899-6911] [CONCEPT] Guru-Student Mutual Relationship
Threefold common practice:
1. Guru regards student with compassion, looking with clarity, timely benefit, Dharma, even food and drink
2. Student contemplates guru's qualities with yearning respect and faith without interruption
From *Rang shar*:
"Compassion's connection thread not severed
Yearning stream not interrupted
Is guru-student relationship"
[6900-6911] [STRUCTURE] Supplication Method Requirements
**Proper Supplication Framework:**
From *Thal 'gyur*:
"To one with complete individual characteristics
Royal sovereignty and own body
Retinue and enjoyments support
With body, speech, conduct please
Honor guru equal to Buddha
With faith and wisdom
Aspired, without delusion
Topics spoken without error
With clear faculties honor guru"
Student possessing:
- Aspiration for elaborated etc. empowerments
- Intention to request instructions
Should not enter suddenly—even common invitation requires prior notice.
Procedure:
- For years (five, seven, three, etc.) previously offering maṇḍala of gatherings and gold to guru
- Confessing own age, requesting specific empowerment or instruction: "Please grant"
- Supplicating repeatedly
- At session start of virtuous practice, meditating on that guru yoga day and night, six times, supplicating
[6912-6933] [PHILOLOGY] Guru's Response and Preparation
Guru grants permission:
"Child, if you request empowerment, for removing obstacles and purifying sins/obscurations, meditate on guru at crown, supplicate day and night six times"
Benefits of this preparation:
- Body matures as deity's form
- Speech matures as *āli-kāli*'s self-sound
- Mind matures as emptiness free from conception
[6934-6950] [CONTEXT] Dream Signs and Accomplishment Marks
During this time, with intense aspiration thinking "Must obtain whatever desired empowerment, etc.":
- Dreams of teaching Dharma
- Dreams of giving prophecies
- Signs of accomplished guru certainly arise
Definite result of this method:
Through previous supplication and serving guru, all desired aims accomplished like wish-fulfilling jewel and wish-fulfilling tree.
From *Thal 'gyur*:
"From that serving, qualities
Wish-fulfilling tree and mind jewel
Like cow of desires
Immeasurable qualities obtained
Aiming at that, serve guru
To turn from cyclic existence battle"
[6951-7001] [CONCEPT] Empowerment Benefits Classification
Benefits of empowerment from *Rang shar*:
"In bardo, self-appearance recognized
Recognizing, also stabilizes therein
Can emanate nirmāṇakāya in twenty-one days
For faculties' perfection, suffering, fear, etc., don't arise
During practice time, wisdom light appears unceasingly clear
These are called special benefits"
Common benefits:
- Understands ḍākinīs' speech
- Blessed as honored place by humans
- Loving-kindness to all beings
- Beautiful form, pleasant to see
- Great merit increase
- After death takes cakravartin body
- Great qualities arise like wish-fulfilling jewel
- Practices pure Dharma like lotus
- Circumambulated by all like stūpa
- Overpowers common beings like parasol
- Liberates beings with wisdom like fire mass
- Benefits like sword
- Holds beings with compassion like vajra hook
- Realizes dharmadhātu wisdom inseparability like Dharma cloud
"All outer and inner activities accomplished
Thus etc., one hundred eight qualities obtained
By that, whatever activity done, all obtained
By that, obstacles and wrong guides cannot seize
Many children and great enjoyments are signs of obtaining empowerment
Remember previous lives
See beings taking birth
Know others' minds
Associate with non-humans
Thus etc., one hundred eight qualities obtained"
[7002-7039] [STRUCTURE] Faults of Not Receiving Empowerment
From *Sgyu 'phrul gsang snying*:
"Not pleasing guru
Not obtaining empowerments
Listening, etc., beginning endeavors
Fruitless and lost"
From *Dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud*:
"Secret mantra without depending on empowerment, accomplishment won't occur
Like one without hand-ears
Cannot cross to river's other side"
From *Rang shar* comprehensive enumeration:
"Faults of not obtaining empowerment thus:
In bardo, wandering
Fear
Obstruction
Hindrance
Consciousness lost
Until karmic body not abandoned
Not seen as worthy of honor by beings
Little merit
Short life
Few enjoyments of livelihood
Narrow mouth
Many obstacles occur
All activities unaccomplished
This is fault of secret mantra practitioner not obtaining empowerment
Secret mantra practitioner should obtain empowerment
Without obtaining, even Buddha cannot turn Dharma wheel at Tathāgata level
Without turning wheel, compassion's emanation body cannot benefit beings
Therefore secret mantra practitioner should obtain empowerment"
[7040-7057] [PHILOLOGY] Empowerment Location Classifications
**Location Types:**
Isolated, delightful, near accomplishment places.
General location: Auspicious with good earth-examination, good forests, etc.
Four specific location categories:
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): Student's body element
- Earth: south-facing, north protected
- Water: east-facing, west protected
- Fire: west-facing, east protected
- Wind: north-facing, south protected
2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): Thick forest interior, mountain ravine matching student's element form and characteristics
3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): Peak of mountain where three valleys meet—excellent
4. **Utterly without elaboration** (*rab tu spras med*): Extremely isolated or charnel ground—one *rgyang grags* from village
All four empowerment locations:
- Where other beings fear
- Wild fierce beasts dwell
- Poisonous snakes
- Charnel grounds, *spyang gi*, etc.
Excellent charnel ground with extremely fierce ḍākinīs is supreme.
[7058-7086] [CONTEXT] Location Characteristics from Tantras
From *Rdzogs pa rang byung*:
"This supreme empowerment shown
In great village's center
Yogin purpose not accomplished
Village and city's end
Forest or mountain rock empty valley
Yogin enters empowerment meaning"
And:
"Very isolated and delightful place
Examine location's characteristics
End of extensive village
Fruitful forest place
Various flowers born
West high, east facing
North protected, similar
South extensive, similar place
From self clear direction
Without holes and gaps
Without form in front
Without being-like form
Back leaning on rock
Sides various fruit trees blazing
Front river and pure water flowing
Or like life-sustaining place
Mountain ranges not completely cut
Various bird sounds proclaim"
[7087-7131] [CONCEPT] Empowerment Timing Classification
Two aspects:
1. Generally explained
2. Specifically explained
**General:** When guru grants and dependent connections gather—auspicious time.
**Specific excellent time:**
- Autumn: bodhi fruit ripens
- Spring: liberation's seed planted
- Monkey year: auspicious
- Waxing eighth day: good
- Star *rgyal mchog*: good
- Planet Jupiter: good
From *De nyid*:
"Mouse, Dragon, Horse, Pig

Empowerment ritual auspiciously becomes
This time commitment-holding student
Elements' bodies harmonious
Number immeasurable as measure
Hundred or fifty, etc.
Elements harmonious, no contradiction

Meaningless death, obstacles arise
Empowerment completion, strongly endeavor
If assembled relative sick

[7132-7171] [STRUCTURE] Auspicious Signs and Timing Continued
**Auspicious Signs for Empowerment:**
If signs of purification arise, then empowerment ritual should be exerted.
If practice substances increase:
- Supreme siddhi obtained
- Be inspired toward equal meaning
- Having entered empowerments
- Always seeing good signs
- Common siddhi accomplished by that
- Even with experience and realization
- This also engages in bliss-happiness
- Especially toward guru
- Good aspiration is born
- This also joins with supreme mudrā
- Self body, speech seen as bliss
- This is pure Buddha field
With elaboration empowerment time and signs well explained.

**Preparation Sequence:**
Approach (*bsnyen pa*), accomplishment (*bsgrub pa*), close approach (*nye bar bsnyen pa*) complete—when time arrived, earth ritual, deity, vase, student preparation (first evening's activity complete).

Each with outer, inner, secret, completely perfect four-four = twelve.
**Secret Mantra Three Vehicles:**

Naturally body, speech, mind up to vase included; these two done separately.
[8010-8064] [CONCEPT] Completely Perfect and Wisdom Classifications
With elaboration's completely perfect depending on mind's maṇḍala:
- Abandonment
- Realization
- Faith
- Diligence
- Compassion
- Wisdom
- Pure perception
Seven substances depending, conferring—three realms' entering preparation forward stream ceases.
Depending on verse: obtaining power over turning from mind-fabrication view.
Four verses are four great symbols, ritual accordingly.
Supreme completely perfect outer, inner, secret, completely perfect four: here symbol four's meaning identified.
Thus thirty-six is with elaboration great empowerment classification.
**With Elaboration Medium:**
Condensed less than those.
From *Rig pa rang shar*:
"Empowerment two kinds shown
Realization wisdom empowerment
Non-realization sign empowerment"
Two kinds here:
- With marks sign empowerment
- Without marks wisdom empowerment
First: meaningful wisdom arisen as indicated meaning's method.
Here marks: substance depending, drawn powder depending, mother's bhaga depending—three.
Substance threefold:
- Eight auspicious substances conferring method
- Jewel vase empowerment
- Flesh blood *gutor* conferring method
Maṇḍala conferring method three:
- Retinue's maṇḍala conferring method
- *Cakra* conferring method
- Center palace conferring method
Mother three kinds said:
- Mudrā door empowerment
- Bhaga and vajra
- Supreme excellent empowerment
- White red bodhicitta conferring method
From *De nyid*:
"Non-realization sign empowerment
Mark substance depending
Powder maṇḍala depending
Mother's bhaga empowerment
Mark substance three kinds
Eight auspicious substances conferring method
Jewel vase empowerment
Flesh blood *gutor* conferring method
Maṇḍala conferring method three
Retinue maṇḍala conferring method
*Cakra* conferring method
Center palace conferring method
Mother three kinds said
Mudrā door empowerment
Bhaga and vajra
Supreme excellent empowerment
White red bodhicitta conferring method
Non-realization sign empowerment"
From the tantra:
1. **Outer**: Sentient beings' appearances sent outward (*sems can snang ba phyi ltar bskur*)
2. **Inner**: Meditation, mind-holding inwardly (*sgom pa sems 'dzin nang ltar bskur*)
3. **Secret**: Recognition's twenty-one introductions (*ngo 'phrod nyi shu rtsa gcig*) matched to faculties, exemplified meaning and signs
Plus: Isolated awareness self-clear as five lights (*rig pa rkyang pa 'od lnga rang gsal*)
And: East-liberated, without frame, Great Perfection transcending acceptance/rejection/effort (*shar grol ris med rdzogs pa chen po spang blang bya rtsol las 'das*)
**Accomplished Guru Distinction:**
Accomplished gurus can complete empowerment with single isolated piece or lump—whatever is said is accomplished.
Unaccomplished gurus must combine all and confer to accomplish meaning.
**Empowerment Four Classification:**
1. Vase empowerment (*bum dbang*): colored powder maṇḍala, deities, vase, student preparation, auspicious eight substances, royal seven, peaceful/wrathful *cakrā*/image/statue, vajra name, command sign (*bka' rtags*), seal empowerment (*phyag rgya*), action completion
2. Secret empowerment (*gsang dbang*): giving two bodhicittas
3. Wisdom-gnosis empowerment (*shes rab ye shes*): attachment-free seal visualization, merely recognizing seal, attachment-possessing actual consort activity
4. Word empowerment (*tshig dbang*): realization wisdom, view, meditation, awareness
**Rig pa (Awareness) Definitions:**
- Awareness wisdom directly recognized (*rig pa'i ye shes mngon sum du rig pas na rig pa*)
**Ma (Mother) Etymology:**
- Worldly: Nothing exists without depending on mother
- Dharmic: Like earth ground—no Buddha arises without depending on consort mother
**Alternative: Gzungs ma (Retention):**
- Mind's bliss retention depends on body
- Holding increases body retention
**Sky-like Mother:**
- Like space—no world-system exists without depending on space
**Phyag rgya ma (Seal):**
- *Phyag* = holding—from cyclic existence to Buddhahold
- *Rgya* = sealing—sealing cyclic existence with enlightenment
- *Ma* = sustenance—like food, without food, death; without seal consort, realization doesn't arise
**Five-fold Classification:**
1. Outer five (*phy'i rigs lnga*)
2. Inner five (*nang gi lnga*)
3. Secret five (*gsang ba'i lnga*)
4. Perfect two (*yongs rdzogs kyi gnyis*)
- Total: seventeen (*bchu bdun*)
**Outer Lineages:**
- Royal lineage: Tathāgata family Buddhas
- Noble lineage: Vajra family
- Commoner lineage: Jewel family
- Brahmin: Lotus family
- Outcaste: Karma family Buddhas
Not that any single Buddha family suffices—all five lineages needed with corresponding consorts.
**Inner Lineages:**
- Yakṣa daughters
- Goddess daughters
- Nāga daughters
- Brahmā daughters
- Śakra daughters
These are karma mudrā lineages.
**Historical Example:**
Kośala master Śrī-heruka invoked Brahmā, Śakra, etc.'s daughters for empowerment and achieved siddhi.
**Secret Lineages:**
Fivefold classification (*rigs can lnga*):
1. Conch-bearing (*dung can ma*): black hair, good teeth, beautiful locks
2. Elephant-nose (*glang sna can ma*): bad hair, extra front teeth
3. Lotus (*padma can*): yellow hair, right spiral
4. Deer (*ri dwags can*): bad hair, large forehead prominence
5. Cow (*ba glang can ma*): beautiful hair, vertical forehead wrinkles
**Lotus-bearer Special Function:**
Produces superior bliss and serves as companion for clear dharmatā—like lotus blooming/non-blooming, main instruction is opening channel mouth.
**Deer Special Function:**
Thin channels entering like King Añjana's deer leg—channel-lengthening instruction essential.
**Elephant-nose Function:**
Like elephant trunk spiraling upward—summoning instruction essential.
**Cow Function:**
Channels latent in mind without sound—channel-taming instruction essential.
**Conch Function:**
Like right-spiraling conch—channel-squeezing instruction essential.
**Wisdom Results:**
All five produce five wisdoms' lineage holding.
For bliss path, Lotus-bearer surpasses all.
**Actual Bodhicitta:**
Women don't produce actual red bodhicitta (blocked by five lineages); men produce bindu through five lineages but not actual red bodhicitta—channel mouth doesn't change.
**Channel Functions:**
Channels flow upward—right nostril bleeds at youth's maturity, those without body element diseases.
**Lineage Accomplishments:**
- Deer: body enhancing activities
- Conch: speech enhancing
- Elephant-nose: mind enhancing
- Cow: consciousness enhancing
- Lotus: bliss body expanding
From *Dbang bkod chen po*:
"All women are five lineages—this arrangement is great bliss, yogins' siddhi completion."
**Perfect Lineages:**
1. Common siddhi-producing lineage (ordinary)
2. Supreme siddhi-producing lineage (ḍākinī sky-goer)
**Ordinary:**
- Wide eyes
- Right-spiraling hair
- Extra teeth on left
- Right view: ninth month
- Left view: bloated appearance
- Direct view: very straight
**Sky-goer:**
Large form, half-opened waist channels, good nose, beautiful brows, occasional harsh voice, gentle conduct, sweet speech, cow-like movement, heroic conduct, under thirty years.
