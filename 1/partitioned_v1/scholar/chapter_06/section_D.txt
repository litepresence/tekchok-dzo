[12047-12086] [STRUCTURE] Distinguishing Expansive Qualities and Buddha Qualities
This section continues the analysis of Samantabhadra's liberation, distinguishing: (1) expanse qualities (dbyings kyi yon tan) present but unmanifest in recognition (12066-12070), (2) buddha qualities (sangs rgyas kyi yon tan) that manifest at complete perfection through cessation-power (12071-12072), and (3) the alternative formulation distinguishing basis-lhungrub's buddha qualities from result-actualized buddha qualities (12073-12074). The section critiques the reified notion of "primordially liberated" (gzhi thog nas grol, 12053, 12057) as potentially misleading if interpreted as ordinary ground-state, clarifying that liberation occurs at the "lhungrub level's perfection" (mthar phyin lhun grub kyi sa grol ba, 12058). The six characteristics (chos drug, 12076-12082) are reiterated as defining awakened nature.
[12047-12086] [PHILOLOGY] Causative Terminology and Qualitative Distinctions
Key grammatical constructions: (1) The causative zer (assert/claim) with brtsings (erroneously constructed) introduces potential misunderstanding: gzhi thog tu grol zer brtsings te (12053), gzhi thog tu grol zer ba yang rtsings te (12057) - "saying 'liberated at the ground' is erroneous construction"; (2) The optative nam introduces rhetorical challenge: gzhi thog ma yin nam zhe na (12063) - "is the ground not a beginning? one might ask"; (3) The terminative te with gnas (12068) marks abiding state: gnas tshad la (in the state of abiding); (4) The emphatic particle ni establishes contrast: yod ni yod (12069) - "existing, yes existing [but unmanifest]"; (5) The causal particle phyir marks consequence: ma mngon pa'i phyir (12070) - "because unmanifest"; (6) The enumerative dang with so marks the six characteristics list; (7) The threefold "not arising from" construction: rgyu las ma byung/sems las ma byung/lung las ma byung (12083-12085).
[12047-12086] [CONTEXT] Philosophical Debates on Primordial Liberation
The passage addresses debates within Nyingma and between Nyingma and Sarma schools: (1) The critique of "primordially liberated" interpretation addresses potential reification - if ground-state is liberation, why practice? (2) The distinction between "beginning" (thog ma) in natural condition versus "first ground" (dang po'i gzhi) clarifies that while there is no temporal beginning in gnas lugs (natural state), there is an ordinal first in analysis; (3) The "ground not possessing delusion yet demonstrating delusion-mode for beings" (rdo rje sems dpa' la 'khrul pa mi mnga' yang sems can la 'khrul pa'i tshul ston pa) reflects Vajrasattva's skillful means; (4) The zag med (outflow-free) merit resolves the tension between "without virtue" and "ocean of merit" - recognition produces merit without accumulation (tshogs bsag med).
[12047-12086] [CONCEPT] The Ontological Status of Qualities: Latent vs. Manifest
The philosophical framework establishes a nuanced ontology of qualities: (1) Two types of qualities: (a) dbyings kyi yon tan - present but unmanifest (yod ni yod la ma mngon), like oil in sesame not yet pressed, (b) sangs rgyas kyi yon tan - manifest through sangs stobs (cessation-power), like oil released through pressing; (2) Recognition does not create qualities but liberates obstructing forces, allowing manifestation; (3) The paradox: Kun tu bzang po achieves buddhahood without gradual accumulation (dge ba rdul tsam ma byas par gzhi thog nas sangs rgyas) yet this is "outflow-free self-arisen merit ocean" (zag med rang byung gi dge ba rgya mtsho) - recognition itself is the accumulation; (4) Alternative distinction: gzhi lhun grub kyi sangs rgyas kyi yon tan (basis-lhungrub's buddha qualities) vs. 'bras bu mngon gyur grub sangs rgyas kyi yon tan (result-actualized manifest buddha qualities); (5) The six characteristics establish non-dependent arising: transcending basis (not remaining in neutrality), self-display (recognizing own manifestation), differentiation (wisdom discerning), liberation-upon-differentiation (immediate freedom), non-arising-from-other (not dependent on causes), self-abiding (natural presence).
[12087-12117] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom's Ripening into Kaya and the Two Omnisciences
This section presents: (1) the mechanism of wisdom's action in liberation (rtogs pa'i shes rab kyis byed pa, 12087), citing the *Sgron ma 'bar ba'i rgyud* (Lamp Illumination Tantra, 12088-12094), (2) the distinction between two modes of omniscience (thams cad mkhyen pa'i ye shes, 12096-12106), and (3) the beginning of the second division: abiding in the expanse after liberation (grol nas dbyings na bzhugs pa'i tshul, 12107). The wisdom-action formula: basis itself ripens as result through wisdom (gzhi nyid 'bras bur smin byed shes rab), wisdom ripens as kaya (shes rab sku ru smin pa), essence-dharmakaya ripens as wisdom-dharmakaya (ngo bo nyid kyi chos sku...ye shes chos kyi sku ru smin), producing uninterrupted wisdom stream (ye shes rgyun ma chad) and spontaneous clarity (sku dang ye shes lhun grub gsal). The two omnisciences: (a) knowing all knowables as appearing to own face (shes bya yul snang du shar ba'i rnam pa rang ngor mkhyen pa), (b) abiding internally clear in dharmatā with analytical elaborations pacified (rang ngo nang gsal du bzhugs te chos nyid kyi ngang las dpyod byed kyi spros pa zhi ba).
[12087-12117] [PHILOLOGY] Ripening Terminology and Epistemic Distinctions
Critical grammatical constructions: (1) The causative smin byed/smin pa (to ripen/cause to ripen) establishes developmental transformation without substantial change: gzhi nyid 'bras bur smin byed shes rab ste/shes rab sku ru smin pa yis (12089-12090); (2) The continuative rgyun ma chad (uninterrupted stream, 12093) characterizes wisdom's continuity; (3) The dual shes pa (cognition) distinction: nang bzhugs kyi shes pa (internally abiding cognition) vs. phyi gzigs kyi shes pa (externally perceiving cognition, 12100-12101) - the two omnisciences mapped onto perceptual modes; (4) The spatial simile ltar (like/as): shel 'od nang du bsdus pa ltar (like crystal light gathering within, 12108); (5) The locative na with abiding: dbyings na bzhugs (abiding in expanse, 12107); (6) Spatial compounds: dbyings dpangs mtho ba'i klong (expanse of high extent, 12110), gting gsal (clear depth, 12111), gzhal yas khang (immeasurable mansion, 12111); (7) The simile ltar with 'od zer: gsang ba'i nyi ma dbyings na shar ro (secret sun rises in expanse, 12116).
[12087-12117] [CONTEXT] Lamp Illumination Tantra and Buddha-Field Cosmology
The section integrates: (1) *Sgron ma 'bar ba'i rgyud* citation (12088-12094) - an Atiyoga tantra on wisdom's ripening; (2) Two omnisciences reflect Indian pramāṇa traditions, particularly Dharmakīrti's distinction between direct perception (pratyakṣa) and inference (anumāna), here mapped onto Dzogchen's internal/external cognition framework; (3) "Youth in vase" (gzhon nu bum pa'i sku, 12109) derives from Tathāgatagarbha sūtras, illustrating buddha-nature's presence within beings; (4) "Five-light palace" ('od lnga'i lha khang) and "secret sun" (gsang ba'i nyi ma) reference thod rgal visionary geography; (5) Union of means and wisdom (thabs dang shes rab kyi dra ba, 12113) reflects standard Mahāyāna non-duality but within Dzogchen's spontaneous framework; (6) "Horse of knowing all knowables" (shes bya thams cad shes byed du grub pa'i rta, 12114) and "swift steed" (bang mgyogs, 12114) draw on Indian metaphorical traditions of wisdom as mount.
[12087-12117] [CONCEPT] Non-Dual Ripening Without Transformation and the Two Perspectives
The philosophical framework: (1) Ripening (smin pa) is not creation but manifestation - like fruit ripening on a tree, qualities become manifest through recognition without changing nature; (2) Recognition-wisdom (rtogs pa'i shes rab) is sole transformative agent, not external causes; (3) The two omnisciences are not different in essence (ngo bo gcig) but different in perspective (ldog pa tha dad) - internal abiding (nang bzhugs) versus external perception (phyi gzigs) share the same knowing nature viewed from different angles; (4) Abiding in expanse described through spatial metaphors: vast expanse without center/periphery (mtha' dbus med pa, 12110), clear depth (gting gsal, 12111), five lights as palace array ('od lnga gzhal yas khang gi bkod pa, 12111); (5) Spontaneous self-connection of means and wisdom (rang 'brel, 12113) without deliberate union; (6) Wisdom as life-force (shes rab srog tu gyur pa, 12114) animating the swift horse of cognition; (7) Five lights' internal radiance without mixture (ma 'dres la mnyam pa, 12115) - displaying variety without confusion; (8) Secret sun rises without setting (nub pa med pa, 12116) - unceasing luminosity.
[12118-12153] [STRUCTURE] Inexhaustible Qualities and the Self-Arisen Tantra Citation
This section continues describing the inexhaustible qualities of buddhahood within the expanse, presenting: (1) inexhaustible depth-clear radiance (gting gsal gyi gdangs nub pa med, 12118), (2) five wisdom lights coiling in expanse (ye shes kyi 'od lnga dbyings na zar tshags su 'khyil, 12119), (3) emptiness without mere nothingness (dngos po dang mtshan ma ltar ma grub pas stong la med pa phyam chad du ma song, 12120-12121), (4) single knot of essence-nature-compassion (ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum gyi rgya mdud gcig tu 'dril, 12122), (5) light-possessing awareness (rig pa 'od kyi khang pa can, 12123), (6) inexhaustible dense appearance ('od mtha' med pa'i snang ba lhun stug, 12124), (7) inexhaustible wisdom-banner with ten powers, four fearlessnesses, self-knowledge, marks and signs (rnam par grol ba'i ye shes mtha' yas pa rgyal mtshan...stobs bcu...mi 'jigs pa bzhi...so so rig pa...mtshan dang dpe byad, 12125-12129), (8) continuously blazing light-lamp ('od zer mtha' yas pa'i sgron mar gsal, 12130), (9) wisdom's self-appearance without increase/decrease (ye shes kyi rang snang la 'phel 'grib med, 12131), (10) great compassion's path not traveling elsewhere (thugs rje chen pos...lam gzhan du mi bgrod, 12132), (11) five-kaya stupa with five wisdom terraces (sku lnga'i mchod rten ye shes lnga'i bang rim, 12133). The section concludes with *Rang shar* citation (12137-12153) describing jewel metaphors.
[12118-12153] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative Syntax and Qualitative Adjectives
Key grammatical constructions: (1) The continuative cing/zhing (12118, 12122, 12130, 12133) creates cascading enumerations of qualities; (2) The locative na establishes containment: dbyings na (in expanse, 12119), nang gdangs nub pa med cing (internal radiance not setting, 12118); (3) The privative compounds: nub pa med (inexhaustible), mtha' med (without limit), 'phel 'grib med (without increase/decrease), mi bgrod (not traveling), mi g.yo (not moving), mi nub (not ceasing); (4) The instrumental pas/bas with manner: stong la (empty yet), 'dri legs pa (beautifully fitting); (5) The possessive can characterizes: 'od kyi khang pa can (having light-house, 12123); (6) The compound lhun stug (dense/spontaneously solid, 12124) describes appearance's unshakable nature; (7) The formula "rnam par grol ba'i ye shes mtha' yas pa" (inexhaustible liberation wisdom) establishes qualitative superlatives.
[12118-12153] [CONTEXT] Standard Buddha-Qualities in Dzogchen Framework and Rang shar Tantra
The passage integrates: (1) Classical Mahāyāna buddhology: ten powers (daśabala), four fearlessnesses (caturvaiśāradya), thirty-two marks (lakṣaṇa), eighty signs (anuvyañjana) from Abhidharma and Prajñāpāramitā literature; (2) Five-kāya structure expands standard trikāya with Vajrayāna additions; (3) Five wisdom terraces (ye shes lnga'i bang rim) correspond to five wisdom buddhas; (4) "Rang shar" (Self-Arisen) tantra citation (12137-12164) provides Atiyoga authority with seventeen jewel (rin po che) metaphors: piled jewel-heap, jeweled palace, jewel-adorned consort, jewel-arrayed net, jewel-horse, jewel-vessel, five-jewel plain, secret jewel-sun, jewel-water-lotus, piled jewel-fire, jewel-wind-wisdom, jewel-earth, jewel-space, blazing jewel-light, jewel-ray-garland, jewel-empty-maṇḍala, jewel-three-extreme-knots, jewel-clearing-darkness, jewel-ocean-peak, jewel-lamp, jewel-secret-wisdom, jewel-interconnection-path, jewel-blazing-stupa, jewel-vajra-seat, jewel-empty-path. These represent classical Vajrayāna maṇi symbolism integrated into Dzogchen's spontaneous presence framework.
[12118-12153] [CONCEPT] Spontaneously Present Qualities Without Transformation
The philosophical framework: (1) All buddha-qualities are spontaneously present (lhun grub) in expanse, not produced through effort; (2) Ten powers, fearlessnesses, marks/signs are natural expression (rang rtsal) of awareness, not achievements accumulated over time; (3) Simultaneity of self-abiding (complete rest, mi g.yo zhing) and all-pervading compassion-activity (thugs rje chen po'i stong lam phyogs mtha' gtugs pa kun tu 'phro) - mutually enabling, not contradictory; (4) Qualities are inexhaustible (nub pa med, tha yas pa) - continuously blazing (rtag tu mi nub pa'i rang bzhin), not temporally produced or destroyed; (5) Single knot of essence-nature-compassion (ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum gyi rgya mdud gcig) - triune structure of buddhahood where emptiness, clarity, and compassionate energy are inseparable; (6) Five lights' internal radiance (nang gdangs) without mixture yet perfectly even (mnyam pa) - simultaneous diversity and unity; (7) Self-appearance without increase/decrease - qualities neither grow through practice nor diminish through neglect; (8) Rang shar citation's jewel metaphors: each quality is like a wish-fulfilling jewel spontaneously manifesting without effort or transformation.
[12154-12192] [STRUCTURE] Buddha-Activity Without Departure and Uttara Tantra Integration
This section completes the *Rang shar* citation (12154-12164) and presents: (1) correlation with *Thig le gsang skor* (Secret Cycle of Spheres, 12165-12166), (2) third division: acting for others' benefit (de las gzhan don mdzad pa, 12167-12173), (3) integration with *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttara Tantra/Mahāyānottaratantraśāstra, 12174-12192). The activity section: from expanse's primordial purity not moving (dbyings ka dag chen po chos kyi sku'i zhing de las ma g.yos), manifestation from lhungrub's door according to beings' perceptions (lhun grub kyi sgo las sems can gyi snang tshul dang bstun nas), light and kāya-expression producing saṃbhogakāya display (lhun grub kyi 'od dang sku'i rtsal las longs sku'i snang ba bkod), Brahmā's aeon of creation (tshangs chen gyi bskal pa bkod), nature-emanation and impure-saṃsāra door producing teachers appropriate to beings' locations (rang bzhin sprul sku'i snang ba dang ma dag pa 'khor ba'i sgo las...ston pa sems can gyi gnas ris khyab par bstan), emptying saṃsāra through teaching ('khor ba stongs par mdzad). The *Uttara Tantra* citation (12175-12192) presents nine characteristics of buddhahood.
[12154-12192] [PHILOLOGY] Activity Syntax and Uttara Tantra Verse Structure
Key grammatical constructions: (1) The continuative bzhin du with negation: ma g.yos bzhin du (not moving yet, 12168) - activity without departure; (2) The instrumental las with source: lhun grub kyi sgo las (from lhungrub's door, 12169); (3) The causative bkod (to arrange/create) with display: longs sku'i snang ba bkod (arranging saṃbhogakāya display, 12170); (4) The terminative par with verbs of action: stongs par mdzad (causes to empty, 12173); (5) The *Uttara Tantra* citation employs ablative-instrumental parallelism: 'dus ma byas shing (unconditioned), lhun gyis grub (spontaneously present), gzhan gyi rkyen gyi rtogs min (not realized through others' conditions); (6) The comitative dang ldan (endowed with): mkhyen dang brtse dang nus par ldan (endowed with wisdom, compassion, power); (7) The causal phyir: rtogs phyir mkhyen (knowing for realization), lam ston phyir na thugs rtse ba (compassionate for showing path), sdug bsngal nyon mongs spong phyir (for abandoning suffering and afflictions); (8) The enumerative: dang po gsum gyis rang don/phyis ma gsum gyis gzhan don (first three for self-benefit, latter three for others' benefit, 12190-12191).
[12154-12192] [CONTEXT] Tathāgatagarbha Theory in Dzogchen and Activity Without Movement
The passage integrates: (1) *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra's jewel metaphors (12137-12164) complete with seventeen comparisons, establishing spontaneous presence; (2) *Thig le gsang skor* correlation (12165-12166) links these teachings to the Secret Cycle literature; (3) Buddha-activity theory: from primordial purity's expanse, non-moving yet manifesting for beings - classic Mahāyāna "non-abiding nirvāṇa" (apratiṣṭhita-nirvāṇa) reformulated in Dzogchen terms; (4) Three-kāya activity: dharmakāya as basis, saṃbhogakāya as lhungrub's display, nirmāṇakāya as appropriate manifestation; (5) *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttara Tantra) of Maitreya/Asaṅga, primary Indian śāstra on tathāgatagarbha, provides nine characteristics: (1-3) nature itself (unconditioned, spontaneous, self-realized), (4-7) functions/qualities (wisdom, compassion, power, two benefits), (8) temporality (no beginning/middle/end), (9) peacefulness (with dharmakāya); (6) Self-realization without teacher (rang nyid slob dpon med par rang byung gi ye shes) reflects Dzogchen's emphasis on self-recognition.
[12154-12192] [CONCEPT] Self-Awakened Teacher Teaching Self-Awakened Nature and Non-Dual Activity
The philosophical framework: (1) Buddha-activity occurs without movement from kādag (primordial purity) - the paradox of complete rest and complete engagement as mutually enabling, not contradictory; (2) From lhungrub's door, manifestation accords with beings' perceptions (sems can gyi snang tshul dang bstun nas) - skillful means adapting to capacities without losing essence; (3) Saṃbhogakāya display arranged from light and kāya-expression (lhun grub kyi 'od dang sku'i rtsal las) - spontaneous, not deliberately created; (4) Nature-emanation and impure-saṃsāra door produce teachers for all beings' realms - manifestation includes both pure and impure as aspects of single display; (5) *Uttara Tantra* integration: buddha-nature is unconditioned ('dus ma byas) and spontaneously present (lhun grub) - not created by practice; (6) Realization is self-arisen (rang byung), not through others' conditions (gzhan gyi rkyen gyi rtogs min); (7) First three characteristics accomplish self-benefit (rang don), next three accomplish others' benefit (gzhan don); (8) Samantabhadra as teacher (ston pa kun tu bzang po) dwells without beginning/end (thog ma dang ma tha med par bzhugs) with complete sovereignty (mnga' dbang rdzogs pa) - simultaneously transcendent and immanent.
[12193-12226] [STRUCTURE] Sentient Beings' Delusion: Third Major Topic
This section presents the third major topic: "The delusion mode of sentient beings through non-recognition" (don gsum pa ma rig pa sems can gyi 'khrul tshul, 12205). The structure: (1) original basis without delusion (thog ma'i gzhi la 'khrul pa med kyang, 12206); (2) delusion arising when basis-manifestation appears without self-recognition (gzhi snang du shar dus rang ngo ma rig pa'i shes pa lung ma bstan pa rig pa'i rtsa ba can des, 12207); (3) individuation through division producing sentient being delusion (gzhi snang la ris su bcad pas sems can du 'khrul te, 12208). Scriptural citations: (1) *Mu tig 'phreng ba* (Pearl Garland, 12209-12214): from great distinctive appearance, existence/non-existence arise, called common ground of delusion, obscured by non-recognition, knowables appear as defilements; (2) "Dharmakāya like space" citation (12216-12221): sudden sentient beings obscure with clouds, non-deluded dharmatā appears as deluded mode to mind; (3) *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (Vajrasattva Heart Mirror, 12222-12226): all three realm beings delude from basis that is nothing into everything.
[12193-12226] [PHILOLOGY] Delusion Syntax and Citation Markers
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Contrastive kyang with negation: 'khrul pa med kyang (without delusion, yet..., 12206); (2) Temporal dus with locative: shar dus (when arisen, 12207); (3) Instrumental des marking agency: des (by that [non-recognition], 12207); (4) Terminative du with delusion: sems can du 'khrul te (deluded into sentient being, 12208); (5) Citation formula las: mu tig 'phreng ba las; (6) *Mu tig 'phreng ba* citation: yod dang med pa gnyis byung ste (existence and non-existence arise, 12211), spyi sa 'khrul gzhi (common ground of delusion, 12212), ma rig nyid dang sbags pa'i phyir (because obscured by non-recognition itself, 12213), shes bya nyid kyang dri mar snang (even knowables appear as defilements, 12214); (7) Dharmakāya citation: glo bur sems can sprin gyis bsgrib (sudden sentient beings obscure with clouds, 12217), ma 'khrul pa yi chos nyid kyang (even non-deluded dharmatā, 12218), blo la 'khrul pa'i tshul du snang (appears as deluded mode to mind, 12219).
[12193-12226] [CONTEXT] Pearl Garland, Heart Mirror, and Cloud-Space Metaphor
The passage draws on: (1) *Mu tig 'phreng ba* (Pearl Garland), major Dzogchen tantra in Sems sde (Mind Series) tradition, presenting cosmogonic emergence of duality from non-dual appearance; (2) Cloud-space metaphor: dharmakāya as space, non-recognition as clouds, sentient beings as obscuration - pervasive in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism; (3) *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (Vajrasattva Heart Mirror Tantra, 12222-12226): "All three realm sentient beings delude from basis that is nothing whatsoever into everything whatsoever" (gzhi ci yang ma yin pa las cir yang 'khrul lo) - establishes that delusion arises from empty ground through misrecognition; (4) Three characteristics of basis: essence as emptiness (ngo bo stong pa), nature as clarity (rang bzhin gyis gsal ba), compassion as appearing-power (thugs rje sems can la snang nus pa, 12227); (5) Apprehending cognition ('dzin byed kyi shes pa, 12228) arises from non-recognition's aspect, producing slight delusion (breng tsam) and dualistic cognition.
[12193-12226] [CONCEPT] Delusion as Adventitious Failure of Recognition
The philosophical framework: (1) Basis is absolutely without delusion - delusion is not inherent in ground; (2) Delusion arises only when basis-manifestation (gzhi snang) appears without self-recognition; (3) Neutral awareness (lung ma bstan pa) with root in awareness (rig pa'i rtsa ba can) is pivotal moment - neither fully deluded nor fully enlightened; (4) Individuation through division (ris su bcad pa) produces error: objectifying manifestation as "other" rather than recognizing as own-display; (5) Cloud metaphor: clouds (non-recognition) temporarily obscure space (dharmakāya) without affecting space's nature; (6) From nothing (ci yang ma yin) to everything (cir yang 'khrul) - the mysterious emergence of multiplicity through misrecognition; (7) Apprehending cognition wonders: "Did awareness arise from me or not from me?" (pha gi las nga byung ngam/nga las pha gi byung) - the fundamental error of grasping at self/other; (8) Non-recognition exists in mode/appearance, not basis - preserving ground's purity.
[12227-12256] [STRUCTURE] Four Conditions of Delusion and Mirror Analogy
This section presents the four conditions (rkyen bzhi) producing delusion from non-recognition: (1) apprehending cognition arising from non-recognition's aspect ('dzin byed kyi shes pa ma rig pa'i cha las byung ba, 12228); (2) arising of slight delusion (breng tsam cig 'gyus pa las, 12228); (3) emergence of dualistic cognition: "Did I arise from father or father from me?" (pha gi las nga byung ngam/nga las pha gi byung snyam pa'i shes pa, 12229-12230); (4) non-recognition exists in mode/appearance, not basis (ma rig pa de gzhi la med de nyams sam rnam pa la yod do, 12231). Four conditions: (a) causal condition (rgyu'i rkyen, 12233-12234) - basis abiding like light in house, non-recognition itself; (b) dominant condition (bdag po'i rkyen, 12235) - going to analysis/investigation; (c) observed condition (dmigs pa'i rkyen, 12236-12237) - apprehending as object-possessor, like face in mirror; (d) immediately antecedent condition (de ma thag pa'i rkyen, 12238) - simultaneity of three.
[12227-12256] [PHILOLOGY] Conditional Terminology and Mirror Analogy
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Ablative las with arising: ma rig pa'i cha las byung (arising from non-recognition's aspect, 12228), 'gyus pa las (from stirring, 12228); (2) Dubitative ngam: nga byung ngam (did I arise); (3) Location markers: gzhi la med (not in basis), nyams sam rnam pa la yod (exists in mode or appearance, 12231); (4) Comparative ltar with mirror: dper na me long la skyes bu'i byad bstan pa lta bu'o (like face of person shown in mirror, 12237); (5) Enumerative dang bcas pa'i (endowed with) marking combinations; (6) *Bkra shis mdzes ldan* (Glorious Auspicious) citation (12245-12252): 'khrul (delude) with condition types; (7) Technical terms: dmigs pa can (having observed object), bdag po'i rkyen (dominant condition), rgyu'i rkyen (causal condition), de ma thag pa'i rkyen (immediately antecedent condition); (8) Four results from four conditions: various causes ('bras bu sna tshogs pa'i rgyur 'khrul, 12249), various names (ming sna tshogs su 'khrul, 12250), inexhaustible results ('bras bu la thug pa med par 'khrul, 12251), various appearances (snang ba sna tshogs su 'khrul, 12252).
[12227-12256] [CONTEXT] Pratyaya Theory and Dzogchen Adaptation
The passage integrates: (1) Standard Indian Buddhist pratyaya theory: hetu-pratyaya (rgyu'i rkyen) - cause as basis, adhipati-pratyaya (bdag po'i rkyen) - dominant/master condition, ālambana-pratyaya (dmigs pa'i rkyen) - observed/object condition, samanantara-pratyaya (de ma thag pa'i rkyen) - immediately antecedent condition; (2) Yogācāra and Sautrāntika epistemology developed these extensively; (3) Dzogchen adaptation to mechanics of non-recognition: basis as causal condition, analytical mind as dominant, object-apprehension as observed, their simultaneity as immediately antecedent; (4) Mirror-face analogy (me long zhal) - standard Indian and Tibetan pedagogical tool for explaining perception and error; (5) *Bkra shis mdzes ldan* (Glorious Auspicious) tantra citation provides authority for the condition-result correlations; (6) "Great delusion mode of secret mantra basis" (gsang sngags gzhi'i 'khrul lugs chen po, 12253) establishes Vajrayāna framework.
[12227-12256] [CONCEPT] Delusion as Conditioned Arising from Slight Error
The philosophical framework: (1) Delusion is conditioned arising (rkyen 'byung) - not inherent in basis but produced through specific conditions; (2) Causal cascade: slight stirring (breng tsam) → dualistic cognition (pha gi...nga) → full delusion; (3) Non-recognition exists in mode/appearance, not basis - preserving ground's purity; (4) Four conditions elaborated: from causal condition arise various causes, from dominant condition various names, from observed condition inexhaustible results, from immediately antecedent various appearances; (5) This is "great delusion mode of secret mantra basis" (gsang sngags gzhi'i 'khrul lugs chen po, 12253); (6) Appearance mode itself together with non-recognition's condition appears with self-just-as-it-is (rang ka ma, 12254); (7) Non-recognition collects root five afflictions and many conceptual heaps (rtsa ba'i nyon mongs pa lnga dang bcas te rtog tshogs du ma sdud pa, 12255); (8) With ten thousand conditions and appearance modes, manifestation becomes extensive ('byams pa, 12258).
