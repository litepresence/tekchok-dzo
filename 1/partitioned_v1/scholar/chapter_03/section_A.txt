[1944-1974] [CONTEXT] Lokayata Materialism
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa presents the *rgyang 'phan pa* (Lokayata/Carvaka) school, representing Indian materialism. The school's fundamental tenet: denial of previous/future lives, karma, cause-effect, and liberation.
**Two Subdivisions:**
1. **Cause-Nihilism** (*rgyu chad par smra ba*)
2. **Result-Nihilism** ('*bras bu chad par smra ba*)
**Cause-Nihilism Position:**
The son of the naked one (*gcer bu pa gnyen gyi bu*) and others propose:
- Mind is not continuous from previous to present
- A "latent mind" (*bag la zhayi sems*) exists inherently in the four elements
- This latent mind, when compressed (*rgyas 'thums*) and meeting conditions of heat/moisture, arises
- New mind enters new body, becoming sentient being
**Pervasive Mind Theory:**
Earth contains latent mind, producing:
- Plants, trees, forests (*rtsi shing dang nags tshal*)
- Water: moistening, movement, sound
- Fire: blazing, burning
- Wind: movement and lifting
**Evidence Cited:**
- Wood and stones striking produce sound
- Trees wither at night, expand by day
- Peeling bark causes drying
- Spontaneous generation: worms from moisture + heat, termites becoming bees, worms becoming frogs
**Critique of Eternal Cause:**
If causes were eternal, wood/stones would have previous lives like sentient beings. Since they don't, causes must be adventitious (*glo bur ba*) like boils arising from accumulated conditions.
[1975-2004] [CONTEXT] Result-Nihilism
**Analysis:**
**Key Figures:**
- Katika's hunchbacked son (*ka ta'i bu nog can*)
- Mipam wearing hair blanket (*mi 'pham skra'i lva ba can*)
**Position:**
- No previous lives for present beings
- No latent cause producing arising mind
- Everything arises from nature itself (*ngo bo nyid kyis byung ba*)
**Natural Arising Examples:**
- Sharp thorns without makers
- Sunrise without cause
- Waterfalls falling naturally
- These phenomena display natural formation (*ye nas byung ba*)
**Death and Cessation:**
- Death ends all without continuation
- No future results whatsoever
**Scriptural Citation:** *Dbang phyug nag po'i rgyud* (Black Tantra of Ishvara):
```
The sun rises, rivers fall
Sharp, long thorns
Beautiful peacocks' tails
Beautiful kings' sons—
None made these; they arise from nature itself.
Cessation is not nonexistent, nor is the future existent.
All this is merely adventitious confusion, conceptually designated.
```
[2005-2012] [STRUCTURE] Defense Against Scriptural Meaninglessness
**Analysis:**
The text addresses the objection that nihilist views render spiritual practice meaningless.
**Defense of Cause-Nihilism:**
- Even without previous mind, present coarse mind exists
- When it ripens as sentient being, understanding non-existence leads to liberation
- The scripture has purpose: showing that at death, elements dissolve into outer elements
- Consciousness divides and destroys affliction-nature
**Defense of Result-Nihilism:**
- Knowing non-existent nature prevents being "carried away" by other scriptures
- Prevents meaningless effort (*ngal bar byed pa*)
- The scripture of "speaking nonexistence" has meaning for reversing this life's suffering
[2013-2032] [CONCEPT] The Synthesis Position
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa presents a third position synthesizing cause and result nihilism, attributed to the hunchbacked son of Katika (*ka ta'i bu nog can*).
**Three-Phase Ontology:**
1. **Arising** (*dang po*): All sentient beings first arise from the space of elements (*'byung ba'i dbyings*)
2. **Abiding** (*bar du*): They abide in the space of elements
3. **Dissolution** (*tha ma*): They dissolve into the space of elements without trace (*yang yal te cang med par*)
**Key Doctrines:**
**The Space of Elements as Universal Self:**
- *'byung ba'i dbyings tsam zhig kun gyi bdag nyid du smra* — "they speak of merely the space of arising as the self-nature of all"
**The Ninefold Structure:**
In the space of abiding:
- *mi gnas dgu gnas pa* — "nine abodes of non-abiding" arise as whatever appears
From the space of arising:
- *ma shar dgu shar* — "nine non-arisings arise"
**Appearance Structure:**
- Outer: forms, objects of various colors (*dkar dmar sna tshogs*)
- Inner: sentient beings, mental concepts (*sems kyi rtog pa*)
- Body: nine aspects that do/don't arise differently
**Liberation Mechanism:**
At liberation (*grol ba'i tshe*):
- *ma grol dgu grol* — "nine unliberated become liberated"
- All vessels, contents, embodied forms dissolve themselves (*rang yal*)
- Since there's no unliberation, destroyed beings cannot return to three realms
**Final Position:**
- All beings first arise adventitiously (*glo bur du byung*) from space
- Now they abide adventitiously in space
- Finally liberated adventitiously into space, never returning
[2033-2098] [STRUCTURE] The 360 Components Enumerated

[2033-2098] [STRUCTURE] Enumeration of the 360 Components (Continued)
**Analysis:**
This section completes the enumeration of the 360 erroneous positions (*'jig tshogs sum brgya drug cu*) constituting the mistaken vehicles (*log pa'i theg pa*).
**Philological Note:** The term *'jig tshogs* (transitory collection) refers to the five aggregates as impermanent, composite phenomena—the primary basis for grasping at self (*bdag 'dzin*).
**Organization from *Rig pa rang shar*:**
**The 300 Spaces (*dbyings*):**
These represent the underlying ontological ground posited by various non-Buddhist schools—the cosmic principles, elemental substrates, and universal selves that serve as the foundation for their metaphysical systems.
**The 60 Views (*lta ba*):**
**Categories of Eternalism (*rtag lta*):**
The text systematically enumerates schools propounding permanence:
1. **Samkhya** (*grangs can*) — enumerationists
2. **Vaisesika** (*bye brag pa*) — particularists
3. **Kumaralabha** (*ku ma ra la chen po*) — great Kumaralabdha
4. **Ear-followers** (*rna ma phug pa*) — scriptural literalists
5. **Five Fires practitioners** (*gsang ba me lnga*) — fire ascetics
6. **Body-burners** (*me ras til mar lus bsreg*) — cremation-ground practitioners
7. **Spear-tip ascetics** (*mdung rtse'i dka' thub*) — self-mortification
8. **Sacrifice practitioners** (*mchod dang 'tshog pa'i dka' thub*) — ritualists
9. **Flesh-chariot makers** (*sha skor lus la byas 'thog*) — tantric materialists
10. **Dog-conduct** (*khyi yi cha byad spyod pa*) — mimetic ascetics
**Philosophical Variations:**
The 60 views include positions on:
- **Agency** (*byed pa*): as cause, as path
- **Permanence** (*rtag pa*): of cause, result, occasion, path, conduct
- **Meaning** (*don*): permanent meaning as nonexistent (the synthesis view)
- **Activity** (*bya byed*): dependence on actions, refutation of others
**Nihilist Categories (*chad lta*):**
The enumeration includes extreme positions:
- Cause severance (*rgyu chad*)
- Result severance (*'bras bu chad*)
- Path severance (*lam chad*)
- Wisdom severance (*ye shes chad*)
- Great severance of emptiness (*stong pa chen po*)
**Tirthika Typology:**
The text presents nine types of tirthikas (*mu stegs*):
1. Secret Vedas speakers (*rig byed gsang bar smra*)
2. Similar wrongness (*cha mthun gol ba*)
3. Manifest mind (*mngon snang sems kyi*)
4. Confused appearance grasping ('*khrul snang 'dzin pa*)
5. Anger-producing (*zhe sdang skyed pa*)
6. Activity and mind (*bya byed sems kyi*)
7. Grasping meaningless ('*dzin pa don med*)
8. Erroneous speech (*kha tshig gol ba*)
9. Permanent meaning as nonexistent (*rtag par don med*)
**Named Proponents:**
The text lists historical figures:
- Kani (*ka ni*)

- Sindhara (*sin dha ra*)
- Dhasim (*dha sing*)
- Kati (*ka ti*)
- Samgha (*sang gha*)

- Dhasaka (*dha sha ka*)
These represent the diverse teachers and lineages of non-Buddhist India during Longchenpa's time.
[2099] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Extensive Explanation
**Analysis:**
The text indicates that the extensive explanation (*don rgyas par bshad pa*) of these positions will have two aspects, signaling the detailed doxographic analysis to follow.
[2100-2164] [CONTEXT] The Hundred Teachers
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa presents the "three hundred views of space" (*dbyings kyi lta ba sum brgya*), organized around teachers across the three times.
**Structure:**
- 100 past teachers (*'das pa'i ston pa*)
- 100 future teachers (*ma 'ongs pa*)
- 100 present teachers (*da ltar ba*)
**Ten Teachers Enumerated:**
1. **Jyotiska** (*skar mkhan*) — astrologer/astronomer
2. **Grasper of the nonexistent** (*med pa 'dzin pa*)
3. **Life** (*srog*)
4. **Leaf-possessor** (*lo ma can*)
5. **Purity-possessor** (*gtsang ma can*)

8. **Three sticks** (*khur bu gsum*)
9. **Kolapaka** (*'bru rdzas can*)
10. **Equal conduct** (*spyod pa mnyam pa*)
These represent the diverse teachers and lineages of non-Buddhist India, each propounding a particular view of space or cosmic principle.
[2165-2245] [STRUCTURE] Additional Enumerations
**Analysis:**
The text continues listing the remaining teachers, including:
**Ethical and Social Categories:**
- Thinking of dharma (*chos su sems pa*)
- Respecting mothers (*ma gus pa*)
- Respecting fathers (*pha gus pa*)
**Celestial Observers:**
- Sixty moon-dawners (*zla ba shar ba drug cu*)
- Sun-dawners (*nyi ma shar ba*)
**Ascetic Practices:**
- Hand-eaters (*lag za*)
- Heart-livers (*snying za*)
- Those who become passed/cease (*'das par 'gyur*)
- Those who do not become passed (*mi 'das*)
**Samkhya-related:**
- Possessors of three aggregates (*phung po gsum pa*)
- Living by two or three (*gnyis gsum gyis 'tsho*)
- Entering Samkhya yogins (*grangs can rnal 'byor du zhugs pa*)
**Nature Dwellers:**
- Seventy owls (*'ug pa bdun cu*)

**Named Teachers:**
- Bhakhanapa (*bha kha na pa*)
- Bhala (*bha la*) and dog-possessors (*khyi can*)
- Brahmin conduct (*bram ze'i spyod pa*)
- Lords of animals (*srog chags gi bdag po*)
- Gautama (*gau ta ma*)
These 100 teachers represent the diverse philosophical and religious movements of ancient India, providing a comprehensive doxographic survey.
[2165-2245] [CONTEXT] The Hundred Teachers (Continued)
**Analysis:**
The enumeration continues with additional teachers from the present era (*da ltar ba*), representing various non-Buddhist schools and ascetic traditions.
**Doxographic Significance:**
These 100 teachers span the spectrum of Indian religious thought, including:
- **Brahmanical orthodoxy** (*bram ze'i spyod pa*)
- **Nature worship** (*nags gnas*, moon/sun observers)
- **Extreme asceticism** (*lag za*, *snying za*)
- **Samkhya traditions** (*grangs can rnal 'byor*)
- **Local/folk traditions** (*khyi can*, *srog chags gi bdag po*)
**Philological Note:** The diversity of names reflects the rich tapestry of religious experimentation in ancient India, from orthodox Brahmanism to extreme asceticism.
[2246-2283] [CONCEPT] Samkhya and Vaisesika Doctrines
**Analysis:**
**Samkhya View:**
The Samkhyas hold three principles as permanent (*rtag pa*):
1. Atoms (*rdul phran*)
2. Darkness (*mun pa*)
3. Three energies (*snying stobs gsum*)
**Causal Theory:**
- Delusion (*ma rig pa*) is the basis of action
- Attachment produces happiness
- Anger turns back armies (*dpung slar log*)
**Vaisesika View:**
The Vaisesikas (*bye brag pa*) view outer aggregates, elements, and ayatanas as minute atoms (*rdul phran*).
**Key Doctrines:**
- Count atoms as "grasped by the first grasper" (*'dzin pa dang po'i 'dzin pa*)
- These are causes and conditions of cessation
- These are causes and conditions of ultimate emptiness
- When body is abandoned, mind and space remain latent (*bag la bab*)
- Latent arising of body (*bag la byung*)
- Abiding at the end of trace emptiness (*thig stong mtha' gnas*)
**Kumaralabha Tenets:**
The school of Kumaralabdha holds:
- Mind is nonexistent; body is nonexistent (*sems med lus med*)
- When mind is nonexistent, body is also nonexistent
This represents an extreme nihilist position within the non-Buddhist traditions.
**Doxographic Method:**
Longchenpa systematically presents each school's:
- Ontological commitments (what they posit as real)
- Causal theory (how things arise)
- Soteriology (path to liberation)
This serves to clearly differentiate Buddhist from non-Buddhist positions.
[2284-2315] [CONTEXT] Ascetic Practices and Eternalist Views
**Analysis:**
**Extreme Ascetic Practices:**
The text describes various forms of physical mortification mistaken as spiritual paths:
**Body Mortification:**
- Flesh mirrors (*sha'i me long*)—using one's body as reflective surface
- Shoulder, right, left, head, crown peel remove—systematic mutilation
- Earth hole placement—burying oneself
- Cemetery dwelling with worms—corpse-like existence
**Mimetic Practices:**
- Animal conduct (*srog chags kyi spyod pa*)
- Dog conduct (*khyi yi spyod pa*)—emulating animal behavior
**Agent-Cause View:**
Some hold (*byed pa rgyur smra ba*):
- Like skilled carpenter, man, woman do different actions
- Own clairvoyance, fortune, lordship determine birth
- Path consists of carrying agents (*byed pa lam du 'khyer ba*)
**Permanent Meaning Views:**
The text enumerates variations on eternalism:
1. **Great Permanent Meaning** (*rtag pa don mtshon chen po*):
- Permanent, eternal (*ther zug*)
- Unchanging (*'gyur med*)
- Great nature not-definite
2. **Occasion-Based Permanence** (*gnas skabs rtag pa*):
- Meaning changes on occasion
- View of permanence regarding the occasion
3. **Cause as Permanent** (*rgyu la rtag pa*):
- Causes are permanent
- Results are permanent
[2316-2323] [CONCEPT] Eternalist Conduct Views
**Analysis:**
**Conduct as Permanent:**
Some practitioners wish to abide upon the path:
- Regarding conduct as permanent (*spyod pa rtag par 'dod pa*)
- Yet seeing cause and result as impermanent
- Taking conduct as permanent to seek liberation
- Viewing objects, homes, houses as permanent
- All appearances as eternal
**Critique:** This represents a fundamental confusion—seeking liberation through permanence while denying the permanence of causality.
**Nihilist Position:**
Those who view permanence where it does not exist are nihilists (*chad par smra ba*). They enact the tenet of permanence upon "this very ground" (*sa 'dir*), meaning they grasp at permanence in the midst of impermanence.
[2324-2349] [CONTEXT] Mantra and Magical Practices
**Analysis:**
**Black Mantra Practitioners:**
Those who wield evil mantras (*ngan sngags*) as chief:
- Performing fierce destructive rites (*drag po'i las*)
- Speaking single-pointedly as black practitioners (*nag po'i phyogs gcig tu smra*)
- Attached to such practices
- Desiring results through magical force
**Divination Practitioners:**
Those who take divination (*mo*) and prophecy (*pra*) as chief:
- Caring only for this world's happiness
- Declaring future lives nonexistent
- Focused on immediate worldly benefit
**Miracle Workers:**
Those who take subtle miracles (*rdzu 'phrul phra mo*) as chief:
- In this world, turning back armies through magical power
- In future lives, defeating others through magic
- Wishing rebirth in retinue of lords or powerful ones
**Debate-Prioritizers:**
Those whose view prioritizes debate (*rtsod pa lhur len pa*):
- Internalizing their own truth
- Refuting others' positions
- Harboring hopes through intellectual victory
**Ascetic Practitioners:**
Various forms of mistaken asceticism (*log pa'i dka' thub*):
- Hope in physical mortification
- Attachment to "worldly benefit" (*'jig rten phan pa*)
- Engaging in this world's affairs
[2350-2355] [CONCEPT] Nihilist Extremes
**Analysis:**
**Severance Views (*chad lta*):**
The text enumerates extreme nihilist positions:
1. **Cause Severed** (*rgyu chad*):
- Mind cannot be held as entity
- Like space, suddenly cut
2. **Result Severed** (*'bras bu chad*):
- Life-force and lordship nonexistent
- Primordial wisdom severed
- Buddha nonexistent
3. **Path Severed** (*lam chad*):
- Withered, nothing exists
- Abiding upon path, effect definitely severed
4. **Complete Emptiness Severance** (*stong pa chen po*):
- Cause and effect nonexistent
- Emptiness completely severed
- You are severed, I am severed
- Therefore nothing exists
**Critique:** These positions represent the extreme of nihilism, denying even the conventional validity of karma and its effects.
[2356-2391] [CONTEXT] Tirthika Classifications
**Analysis:**
**Mistaken Mind Views:**
Some declare:
- Severing life-force through mistaken mind (*log pa'i sems kyis srog chad*)
- From severing life-force, meaning arises
- Severance is emptiness—you and I are severed
- Therefore nothing exists
**Secret Vedas Positions:**
The "knowers speak secretly" (*rig byed gsang bar smra ba*):
- Meaning, like space, is emptiness
- Completely severed
- Existent as entity, nonexistent
- Slight parts exist, suitable for appearance to faculties
**Tirthika Typology:**
Those deviating from consistency (*cha mthun gol ba*) are called tirthikas.
**Buddhist Deviations:**
Buddhists deviating from consistency with Buddhists—merely flesh deviating through wrong tenet.
**Manifest Mind Views:**
Some declare:
- "Manifest appearance is mind's magic"
- All is magic (*sgyu ma*)
- These mistaken appearances are true because ultimate meaning is nonexistent
**Anger Producers:**
Some declare:
- Anger arising finishes spirits (*gdon*)
- Clan-sons should dwell in anger
**Activity and Mind Views:**
Some declare:
- This mind is self-arisen, thus uncorrectable
- Relying solely on meditating deity-body is sufficient
**Named Teachers:**
The text names specific proponents:
- **Kani-pa** (*ka ni pa*) — those wishing meaning indifferently
- **Sersnawa** (*ser sna ba*) — possessed of suffering, fearing diminished appearances
- **Sambhari** (*sam bha ri*)
- **Kabhisha** (*ka bhi sha*) — neither special nor common meaning exists
- **Sindha** (*sin dha*) — common meaning nonexistent, special meaning exists
- **Dhasimba** (*dha sim ba*) — meaning utterly nonexistent
- **Katipa** (*ka ti pa*) — meaning exists
- **Sangha** (*sang gha*) — until breath is cut, meaning persists
- **Shamkari** (*shang ka ri*)
- **Doshaka** (*do sha ka*)
[2392-2427] [STRUCTURE] Synthesis of Views
**Analysis:**
**Fourfold Classification:**
Longchenpa synthesizes the 360 views into four categories:
1. **Extreme View** (*mtha' lta*):
- Eternal permanence (*rtag pa ther zug*)
- Complete eternalism
2. **Extreme End** (*mtha' mtha'*):
- Permanent is permanent, impermanent is impermanent—both
- Half-permanent, half-interrupted
3. **Distant Benefit** (*ring phan*):
- Half permanent, half interrupted
- Effect severed
4. **Indifference** (*btang snyoms*):
- Completely interrupted
- Complete severance
**Reduction to Two:**
All four reduce to:
- Permanence (*rtag pa*)
- Interruption/severance (*chad pa*)
**The 360 Components:**
- 300 spaces (*dbyings*) + 60 views (*lta ba*)
- All gathered into four types
- These gathered into permanence and interruption
**Purpose of Teaching:**
*phyin log lam du mi zhugs par bya ba'i phyir* — "so that one does not enter through recognizing wrong paths"
Longchenpa emphasizes that this extensive doxography serves a practical purpose: preventing practitioners from mistakenly following erroneous paths.
[2428-2429] [CONTEXT] Transition to Transcendent Vehicles
**Analysis:**
The Buddha's statement: *rigs kyi bu khyod phyin log gi lam du zhugs par 'jigs pas na / 'jig tshogs kyi lta ba mang po 'di dag bsdus nas bshad do* — "Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates."
This marks the completion of the outsider (*phyi rol pa*) doxography and transitions to the transcendent vehicles (*'jig rten las 'das pa'i theg pa*).
**Three-part Structure:**
1. Method superior to outsiders (*phyi rol pa las khyad par du 'phags pa'i thabs*)
2. General explanation (*spyi bshad pa*)
3. Extensive particular explanation (*bye brag tu rgyas par bshad pa*)
[2430-2445] [STRUCTURE] Superiority of Buddhist Vehicles
**Analysis:**
**Four Dharma-Seal Mudras:**
The transcendent vehicle accepts four seals (*phyag rgya*) that outsiders lack:
1. **All compounded things impermanent** (*'dus byas thams cad mi rtag pa*)
2. **All with defilements suffering** (*zag bcas thams cad sdug bsngal ba*)
3. **All dharmas empty and selfless** (*chos thams cad stong pa bdag med pa*)
4. **Liberation from suffering peaceful** (*sdug bsngal las grol ba zhi ba*)
**Threefold Refuge:**
Going for refuge to the Three Jewels (*dkon mchog gsum*) — another feature absent in outsider paths.
**Fivefold Analysis:**
Longchenpa applies the standard analytical framework:
1. **Essence** (*ngo bo*):
*'khor ba las nges par 'byin pa'i thabs khyad par can* — "supreme method of definitely exiting samsara"
2. **Definition** (*nges tshig*):
*zhugs nas bde ba sgrub pa* — "that which, when entered, produces happiness"
3. **Division** (*dbye ba*):
- Small and great (*theg pa chung dang chen po*)
- Or three: hearer, self-enlightened, bodhisattva
4. **Purpose** (*dgos pa*):
*don dang mthar thug sgrub pa* — "accomplishing temporary and ultimate meaning"
5. **Effect** ('*bras bu*):
*khams gsum las nges par 'byung zhing thar pa thob pa* — "definitely exiting the three realms, obtaining liberation"
**Scriptural Citations:**
From the *Compendium* (*bsdus pa*):
```
Mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—
Joy, happiness, bliss,
Accomplishing supreme virtue.
This vehicle like space,
A measureless great palace.
```
From the *Lankavatara*:
```
As long as mind engages,
Vehicle-limits have no end.
```

[2485-2501] [PHILOLOGY] Two-Fold and Three-Fold Classifications
**Analysis:** Lines 2485-2501 establish the grammatical and terminological framework for vehicle classification.
**Two-Fold Condensation [2487-2489]:**
- *theg pa mdor bstan pa che chung gnyis* — Great and Small vehicles
- *rgyu mtshan nyid kyi theg pa* — Characteristic/Causal vehicle (*mtshan nyid* refers to the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras)
- *'bras bu rdo rje theg pa* — Effect/Result Vajra vehicle
**Terminological Notes:**
- *rgyu mtshan nyid* (line 2488): "characteristic/causal" — refers to the exoteric causal path where the result is not immediately present
- *'bras bu rdo rje* (line 2489): "effect vajra" — the tantric approach of taking the result as the path
- *dbang po* (line 2491): "faculties" — refers to the three capacities (*dbang po dman pa, 'bring, rnon po*)
**Three-Fold Capacity Classification [2491-2495]:**
| Capacity | Tibetan | Vehicles | Lines |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| Inferior | *dbang po dman pa gsum* | śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva | 2491-2493 |
| Middling | *'bring po gsum* | Kriya, Upa, Yoga | 2493-2494 |
| Superior | *rnon po gsum* | Mahā, Anu, Ati | 2494-2495 |
[2496-2522] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Quotation from Ati Kodpa Chenpo
**Analysis:** Lines 2496-2522 quote extensively from *Ati bKod pa chen po* (*Atiyoga Mahāsaṃdhiparivarta*), a seminal Dzogchen tantra establishing the pedagogical rationale for the nine-fold presentation.
**Quotation Structure [2496-2522]:**
The quotation establishes that the Buddha taught:
- According to beings' intellectual capacities (*sems can blo yi rim pa las*)
- With distinctions of great and small (*che dang chung ba'i khyad par gyis*)
- In two progressive sequences (*rim pa gnyis kyi tshul du bstan*)
**Two Sequences Explained [2502-2503]:**
- *rang rang lta dang sor bzhag go* — Each view and individual placement
- *rang rang nyid ni rim pa gnyis* — Each itself in two sequences
- *phyin ci log dang yang dag lta* — Wrong views and correct views
**Three Capacities Detailed [2504-2522]:**
**Small Capacity (*chung ba'i blo can*) [2504-2513]:**
- Three-fold sequence presented to those with small intellect
- Hearer (*nyan thos*): for those tainted by concepts (*rtog pas sbags*)
- Solitary Realizer (*rang rgyal*): for those with conceptions (*'du shes can*)
- Bodhisattva (*byang sems*): for those grasping concepts (*rtog 'dzud can*)
**Middling Capacity (*'bring po'i blo can*) [2514-2517]:**
- Kriya (*bya rgyud*): for those with extremely inferior conduct (*rab tu dman*)
- Charya (*spyod pa*): for those with inferior conduct (*dman pa*)
- Yoga (*rnal 'byor*): for those with consciousness (*rnam shes can*)
**Great Capacity (*chen po'i blo can*) [2518-2522]:**
- Mahāyoga (*bskyed pa*): for those with superior minds (*sems yas pa*)
- Anuyoga (*sems bcud*): for those with mind essences (*sems bcud can*)
- Atiyoga (*rdzogs pa chen*): for those with supreme fresh minds (*mchog gsar rab*)
[2523-2525] [CONCEPT] Great Exposition Vehicle as Complete Teaching
**Analysis:** Lines 2523-2525 establish the nine-fold schema as the comprehensive teaching vehicle.
**Key Assertion:**
*shin tu rgyas pa chen po'i theg pa ni* — "The very extensive great vehicle..."
**Completeness Claim:**
- All Word (*bka' thams cad*) gathered in the Three Baskets (*sde snod gsum*)
- All Mantras (*sngags*) are "manifest great" (*mngon par chen po*)
**Philosophical Significance:**
This passage establishes the Nyingma school's distinctive hermeneutic:
1. The nine-vehicle schema is not merely enumerative but hierarchical
2. Atiyoga represents the culmination, not replacement, of lower vehicles
3. Each vehicle corresponds to specific cognitive capacities (*blo yi rim pa*)
4. The "great exposition" (*shin tu rgyas pa chen po*) encompasses all prior vehicles
**Soteriological Implication:**
The progression from Hearer to Atiyoga represents increasingly direct approaches to recognizing the nature of mind, with Atiyoga (*rdzogs pa chen po*) offering the most immediate path through its emphasis on self-liberated awareness (*rig pa rang grol*).
[2526-2548] [STRUCTURE] Hearer Vehicle Overview
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa presents the hearer vehicle (*nyan thos kyi theg pa*) through five aspects:
**1. Essence (*ngo bo*):**
*'khor ba las rang grol 'dod pa'i sems* — "mind desiring sole self-liberation from samsara"
*gang zag bdag med rtogs pa'i thabs* — "method realizing person-selflessness"
**2. Definition (*nges tshig*):**
- Hearing dharma from teacher (*ston pas chos nyan*)
- Proclaiming to others (*gzhan la sgrog pa*)
- Depending on teachers (*ston pa la rag las*)
- Accomplishing last-existence enlightenment (*tshe tha mar byang chub sgrub pa*)
**3. Purpose (*dgos pa*):**
*'khor ba las nges par 'byung ba* — "definitely exiting samsara"
**4. Effect ('*bras bu*):**
*zag bcas dang zag med kyi dgra bcom* — "foe-destroyer with or without remainder"
**5. Division (*dbye ba*):**
- Sautrantika (*mdo sde pa*)
- Vaibhasika (*bye brag tu smra ba*)
**The Two Truths in Vaibhasika:**
**Relative Truth (*kun rdzob bden pa*):**
- Gross appearances gathered as one
- Like yak-horn and conch (*g.yag ru dang dung lta bu*)
**Ultimate Truth (*don dam bden pa*):**
- Part-possessed dust-atoms (*rdul phran cha can*)
- Separate pieces (*byed pa shas che*)
- Instant (*skad cig ma*) — partless, like pot-water (*bud rdza'i chu lta bu*)
**Person-Selflessness:**
Both schools accept person-selflessness (*gang zag bdag med*), yet accept dharma-self (*chos kyi bdag*) as dust-atoms and instants.
[2549-2566] [PHILOLOGY] Vaibhasika Four Truths Analysis
**Analysis:**
**Four Truths as Cause-Effect:**
1. **Suffering** (*sdug bsngal*) — to be known (*shes par bya*)
2. **Origin** (*kun 'byung*) — to be abandoned (*spang par bya*)
3. **Cessation** (*'gog pa*) — to be obtained (*thob par bya*)
4. **Path** (*lam*) — to be relied upon (*brten par bya*)
**Four Conditions (*rkyen bzhi*):**
The path involves understanding:
- Cause (*rgyu*)
- Origin (*kun 'byung*)
- Cessation (*'gog pa*)
- Focusing on four condition types
**Meditation Method:**
*sdug bsngal mthong zhing bsgom pa dang* — "seeing and cultivating suffering"
*sgom pa'i thabs kyis rnam grol* — "liberation through cultivation method"
The path requires both intellectual understanding (*mthong*) and meditative cultivation (*bsgom*).
[2567-2596] [CONCEPT] Sautrantika Refinement
**Analysis:**
**Sautrantika Position (*mdo sde pa*):**
The Sautrantikas refine the Vaibhasika position:
**Objects:**
- Four truths as objects (*yul bden pa bzhi*)
- Twelve knowings (*shes pa bcu gnyis*) as cognizing cognitions
- Eighty-eight latent afflictions (*nyon mongs bag la nyal brgyad cu rtsa brgyad*) to abandon
**Person-Selflessness:**
Same as Vaibhasika regarding person-selflessness.
**Dharma-Self Refinement:**
*chos kyi dbyings kyi cha gcig la bzlas* — "surpassed regarding one portion of dharma-realm"
**Five Knowable Bases (*gzhi shes pa lnga*) mainly obstructed:**
1. Main mind's basis (*gtso sems kyi gzhi*)
2. Retinue mind arisen basis (*'khor sems byung gzhi*)
3. Cohesion-not conditioned aggregate basis (*ldan min 'du byed phung po'i gzhi*)
4. Unconditioned eternal basis (*'dus ma byas rtag pa'i gzhi*)
5. Appearance form basis (*snang ba gzugs kyi gzhi*)
**Five Dharmata Realized:**
The portion-without-atom (*cha med rdul phran med pa*) only not-obstructed.
**Key Distinction:**
*de yang 'dzin pa'i yul rags pa snang ba'i rdul phran gyi srog gcig ma thug pa* — "that coarse-appearing atom wing of the grasped-object not reached"
The Sautrantikas do not accept even atoms as ultimately real—they too are conceptually imputed.
[2597-2606] [STRUCTURE] Common Path Cultivation
**Analysis:**
**Path Five Arising Sequence:**
Both schools practice the five paths (*lam lnga*):
**Antidotes:**
1. **General Antidote:**
- Three poisons (*dug gsum*) countered by selflessness (*bdag med*) and illusion (*sgyu ma*) meditation
2. **Individual Antidotes:**
- **Desire** (*'dod chags*): eight impure substances (*mi gtsang ba'i dngos po brgyad*), skeleton meditation
- **Anger** (*zhe sdang*): love (*byams pa*) meditation
- **Delusion** (*gti mug*): dependent arising (*rten 'brel*) forward and reverse meditation
3. **Concept Antidote:**
- Breath out counting meditation (*dbugs rngub 'byung grangs bsgom pa*)
4. **Selflessness Cultivation:**
- Object and object-possessor ceased
- Non-observing object cultivation
5. **Dullness/Torpor Antidote:**
- Crown-bump butter-lamp burning (*spyi gtsug mar me 'bar ba*)
- Mind placed there
**Faculty Gradations:**
- Dull (*rtul po*): effort required
- Medium (*'bring*): some obtain result in life
- Sharp (*rno ba*): immediate liberation
[2607-2617] [STRUCTURE] Bodhisattva Comparison
**Analysis:**
**Bodhisattva Distinction:**
Some bodhisattvas:
- Path five previously gone (*lam lnga sngon song*)
- Collections much accumulated (*tshogs mang bsags*)
- On basis seat one (*gzhi'i gdan gcig*)
- Path five completed (*lam lnga rdzogs*)
- Liberated desire (*'dod chags grol*)
**Three Awakenings:**
From hearer vehicle, through three intellect levels:
- Small (*rtul po*): hearer's awakening
- Medium (*'bring*): self-enlightened's awakening
- Great (*chen po*): buddha's awakening
**Mahayana and Mantra:**
These paths are "not desired" (*'dod pa ma yin*) by hearers—indicating their limited aspiration.
[2618-2631] [STRUCTURE] Hearer Grounds
**Analysis:**
**Eight Inferior Grounds (*sa tha ma*):**
The hearers and self-enlightened traverse:
1. Stream-enterer (*rgyun zhugs*)
2. Once-returner (*lan gcig phyir 'ong*)
3. Non-returner (*phyir mi 'ong*)
4. Foe-destroyer (*dgra bcom pa*)
Each divided into entered (*zhugs*) and abiding (*gnas*) — making eight great-person stages (*gang zag chen po'i sa brgyad*).
**From Rigpa Rangshar:**
The hearer vehicle:
- Entering gate: four truths
- General entering gate for hearers
- Divisions: Vaibhasika and Sautrantika, two types
[2632-2670] [CONCEPT] Detailed Path Meditation
**Analysis:**
**Vaibhasika View:**
*phung po khams skye mched g.yag ril rwa thur du shul* — "aggregates, realms, sense-bases like yak-drum marrow"
Complete analysis reveals dust-atoms (*rdul phran*) — meditate on this emptiness.
**Sautrantika View:**
*gsungs pa rang bzhin nyan bsam sgom gsum* — "recitation-made self-nature, hearing, contemplation, meditation three"
Wisdom three cultivation (*shes rab gsum bsgom*) to obtain ten grounds' result.
**General Hearer Type:**
Four truths meditation, four results.
**Cessation Meditation Method:**
1. External elements (*phyi 'byung ba*)
2. Non-attached abode (*mi chags gnas*) entered
3. First food accustomed
4. Food accustomed, samadhi meditate
5. Samadhi non-concept single-point
**Result:** Victor Maitreya's teaching obtained.
**Origination Abandonment:**
- Food's concept free (*zas kyi 'du shes dang bral*)
- Origination continuum cut (*kun 'byung rgyun chad*)
- Anger antidote meditate
- All afflictions abandoned
**Ground-Path Meditation:**
*'dod chags gnyen po bsgom pa* — "desire antidote meditate"
*gti mug gnyen po bsgom pa* — "delusion antidote meditate"
Thus the path's meditation abandons suffering.
[2671-2709] [STRUCTURE] Four Fruits from Meditation
**Analysis:**
**Fourfold Contemplation Results:**
1. **Stream-Enterer Fruit** (*rgyun zhugs kyi 'bras bu*):
- From meditating on cessation (*'gog pa bsgom*)
- Ground of great joy obtained (*sa dga' ba chen po thob*)
- Up to seventh ground
2. **Once-Returner Fruit** (*lan gcig phyir 'ong gi 'bras bu*):
- From nature of meditating on origination (*kun 'byung bsgom pa'i rang bzhin*)
- Attained up to eighth ground
3. **Non-Returner Fruit** (*phyir mi 'ong gi 'bras bu*):
- Through excellence of meditating on path (*lam bsgom pa'i khyad par*)
4. **Foe-Destroyer Fruit** (*dgra bcom pa'i 'bras bu*):
- Perfected on tenth ground
**Dwelling on Grounds:**
When dwelling on grounds and mother (*sa dang ma la gnas*):
- They listen and make others hear
- Heroes below seventh ground listen to own masters
- Heroes below eighth ground wish to listen to emanation body
- Do not see it as entity, but hear through blessing-power
**Hearer Vehicle Conclusion:**
This completes the presentation of the hearer vehicle view.
[2710-2738] [STRUCTURE] Self-Enlightened Vehicle
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa presents the self-enlightened vehicle (*rang sangs rgyas kyi theg pa*) through five aspects:
**1. Essence (*ngo bo*):**
*phyogs tsam rang don gyis* — "through partial self-benefit"
*ston pa sangs rgyas la rag ma las* — "without depending on enlightenment teacher"
*tshe rabs mtha' ru mngon par sangs rgyas pa'i thabs* — "method manifesting at end of existence"
*phyogs rdzogs bdag med gnyis rtogs pa* — "realizing both half and complete selflessness"
**2. Definition (*nges tshig*):**
*bde bar rang nyid sangs rgyas par sems pa* — "thinking oneself alone becomes Buddha"
**3. Purpose (*dgos pa*):**
*'khor ba las thar pa'i bar mchog gi byang chub thob pa* — "obtaining medium enlightenment for liberation from samsara"
**4. Fruit ('*bras bu*):**
*gnyis dgra bcom* — "two foe-destroyers"
**5. Division (*dbye ba*):**
- Like crows (*bya rog*): flock-gathered (*tshogs 'dus*)
- Like rhinoceroses (*bse ru*): dwelling alone (*bse ru lta bu gcig pu gnas*)
**The Rhinoceros-Type:**
Focuses on phenomena gathered in four truths, meditating on twelve links of dependent arising in forward order, wishing to abandon all subtle defilements of three realms.
**Dependent Arising:**
From ignorance as cause to formative forces; from these, consciousness to aging-and-death, knowing before-after cause-effect.
**Selflessness Realization:**
The rhinoceros-type realizes:
- Person-self (*gang zag bdag*) nonexistent
- Half dharma-self (*chos kyi bdag phyogs gcig*) — outer grasping of atoms with/without parts, both nonexistent
[2739-2748] [CONTEXT] Citation from Abhisamayalankara
**Analysis:**
From the *Abhisamayalankara* (Ornament of Clear Realization):
*don la mi rtog 'dzin pa spangs /
'dzin pa nyid ni ma spangs dang* — "To abandon grasping of objects, yet not abandon grasping itself"
*de yi rten ni bse ru'i lam /*
yang dag sdom pas shes par bya* — "The rhinoceros-like path of support is to be known through correct summary"
**Key Insight:** Self-enlightened ones realize outer dharma-grasping is nonexistent, yet do not realize inner antidote-grasping is also empty.
**Time:**
*tshegs chung 'dus pa'i lam du brgya* — "arising from gathering accumulations on the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas"
*bskal pa brgya yi rgyu ni bse ru* — "The rhinoceros, through a hundred kalpas' cause"
[2749-2798] [STRUCTURE] Self-Enlightened Methods from Rigpa Rangshar
**Analysis:**
**Rigpa Rangshar Citation:**
```
Aho! Secret Lord, listen!
The sutra vehicle of self-enlightened ones
Has twelve links of dependent arising as its entrance.
The view realized is person-selflessness,
Seeing half-power regarding dharma-self.
Protecting the two hundred fifty disciplines,
The meditation stage: meditating on non-thought dharma-nature.
Outer and inner dependent arisings,
Through habituation become strength,
The fruit is considered complete perfection.
```
**Twelve Links Meditation:**
The example: corpse in charnel ground
**Forward Order:**
1. From ignorance (*ma rig pa*), formative forces (*'du byed*)
2. From formative forces, consciousness (*rnam shes*)
3. From consciousness, name (*ming*)
4. From name, form (*gzugs*) nature arises
5. From form, six sense-bases (*skye mched drug*)
6. From six sense-bases, contact (*reg pa*)
7. From contact, feeling (*tshor ba*)
8. From feeling, craving (*sred pa*)
9. From craving, grasping (*len pa*)
10. From grasping, existence (*srid pa*)
11. From existence, birth (*skye ba*)
12. From birth, aging (*rga ba*), sickness (*na ba*), death (*'chi ba*)
**Reverse Order:**
Going to charnel ground: "From what did this corpse arise?" "From death," thus contemplating up to ignorance.
**Eight Unpleasant Meditations:**
As antidotes to attachment:
1. Blue (*sngo*) — lividity
2. Red (*dmag*) — putrefaction
3. Remaining (*lhag*)
4. Swollen (*rgyas*)
5. Worm-entered (*srin bu za*)
6. Scattered (*bsil ba*)
7. White (*dkar*)
8. Skeleton (*rus pa*)
**Result:**
Without listening or hearing, therefore called self-enlightened vehicle.
[2799-2830] [STRUCTURE] Bodhisattva Vehicle Introduction
**Analysis:**
**Two Aspects:**
1. How it surpasses lesser vehicles
2. Explaining the especially superior vehicle itself
**Superiority Through:**
*snying rje chen po thabs dang gnyis bdag med rtogs pa'i shes rab* — "Great compassion as method and wisdom realizing both selflessnesses"
**From Ratnavali:**
```
Emptiness with compassion as essence—
This accomplishes enlightenment for some.
```
**From Compendium:**
```
Without method, separated from wisdom,
One falls into the hearer state.
```
**Five Aspects of Bodhisattva Vehicle:**
1. **Essence (*ngo bo*):**
*chos thams cad nam mkha' lta bu rtogs* — "realizing all dharmas as space-like"
*snying rje chen pos gzhan phan rgya chen spyod pa'i thabs mchog gam rgyu* — "through great compassion becoming supreme method or cause for vast conduct benefiting others"
2. **Definition (*nges tshig*):**
*thabs gang la rag las thar pa'i grong khyer mchog tu khrid pa'i phyir theg pa chen po'o* — "depending on whatever method, leading to supreme great city of liberation—thus the Great Vehicle"
3. **Purpose (*dgos pa*):**

4. **Fruit ('*bras bu*):**
*kun tu 'od kyi sa bcu gcig pa sgrub pa* — "accomplishing the all-illuminating ground, the eleventh"
5. **Division (*dbye ba*):**
Though many, gathered into two: method and wisdom.
[2831-2866] [STRUCTURE] Two Truths Framework
**Analysis:**
**General Path Introduction:**
Longchenpa introduces the two truths (*bden pa gnyis*) as the basis for all Mahayana practice.
**From Root Wisdom (*rtsa ba'i shes rab*):**
All phenomena gathered by samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.
**From Uttaratantra Commentary:**
```
All paths of truth are compounded.
All compounds are merely conventional.
That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—
The essence of emptiness, along with the subsequent measuring wisdom,
The peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.
```
**Two-fold Ultimate Division:**
1. **Nominal Ultimate** (*rnam grangs pa'i don dam*):
- Through reasoning that examines and dissects (*dpyod byed kyi rigs pas dpyad cing dbye ba na*)
- When nothing is established as dharma-nature (*chos nyid du ma grub pa na*)
- Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling arises in accord with its nature
2. **Verbal Ultimate** (*sgra ji bzhin pa'i don dam*)
**From Two Truths:**
The relationship between reasoning and realization established.

- Benefit others: two supreme form-bodies (*gzugs sku*)
- Beholding all with two wisdoms (*shes gnyis*)
- Working for beings until samsara emptied
**Heat Stages (*drod gsum*):**
Through three aspects:
1. Outer heat (*phyi'i drod*)
2. Inner heat (*nang gi drod*)
3. Both together (*gnyis ka*)
**Outer Heat:**
- Second ground: stainless
- Entities appear as empty
- Practice of concentration
- Arises in two pure grounds
**Inner Heat:**
- Sixth ground: manifest
- Understanding pure knowable as empty
**Heat of Both:**
- Seventh ground: arises from pure

1. **Vehicle of Characteristics** (*mtshan nyid kyi theg pa*) — through methodological tradition
2. **Vehicle of Fruition** (*'bras bu'i theg pa*) — tantric approach
**Path for Sharp Faculties:**
Through the Vehicle of Characteristics, the path arises for:
- Sharp faculties (*dbang po rno ba*)
- Powerful mind-power (*sems kyi stobs ldan*)
**Basis:** Self-nature of the two truths (*gzhir gyur pa'i bden pa gnyis kyi rang bzhin*)

The culmination of the five paths — Buddhahood itself.
**Fruit of Complete Perfection:**
Upon the ground of all-illumination (*kun tu 'od*):
- Self-purpose: Dharma-body (*chos sku*)
- Benefit others: Two supreme form-bodies (*gzugs sku gnyis*)
- Two wisdoms (*shes gnyis*): Beholding all that is and the extent of all
- Activity: Working for beings until samsara emptied

[2964-2993] [CONTEXT] Mind-Only School Introduction
**Analysis:**
Longchenpa transitions to the Cittamatra (*sems tsam pa*) presentation:
**Key Thesis:**
*'dzin pa'i rnam shes kyang sems las byung* — "The holding consciousness also arises from mind."
**The Egg Simile:**
*sgong pa dbye ba ltar* — "As an egg is split"
- Aspects and consciousnesses possessing objects (*rnam bcas kyi rnam shes*) appear in a single mind
- Outer aspect consciousness and inner-holding consciousness both arise
- Through beginningless latent tendencies (*thog ma med pa'i bag chags*)
**Self-Awareness:**
*rang rig tsam las gzhan med par ma grub* — "Self-awareness alone, nothing else is established"
**Objection and Response:**
Objection: "When outer aspect consciousness holds, holding consciousness arises simultaneously — two thoughts."
Response: "It does not become. It does not change. That aspect consciousness is without thought — for this reason."
**The Monkey Simile:**
*spre'u myur du rdzong par zhugs pa ltar* — "As when a monkey quickly enters a fortress"
Appearing in four apertures, entering and looking — illustrating how consciousness moves among objects while remaining single.
**Analysis:**
**Holding Consciousness:**
The holding consciousness (*'dzin pa'i rnam shes*) arises from mind itself, not from external objects.
**Aspect-Consciousness Relation:**
When holding objects:
- Outer aspect consciousness (*phyi'i rnam pa'i rnam shes*) — the appearance
- Inner-holding consciousness (*nang 'dzin pa'i rnam shes*) — the apprehension
Both arise through beginningless latent tendencies.
**Self-Awareness Alone:**
*rang rig tsam las gzhan med par grub* — established merely as self-awareness, nothing else.
**Non-Dual Primordial Wisdom:**
*gnyis med ye shes* — non-dual wisdom is the stainless suchness (*dri ma med pa'i de bzhin nyid*).
**At Time of Remainder (*lhag ma'i dus*):**
- Slight stain of latent tendencies appears mistaken
- Taste, sickness, etc. exist conventionally
- When stain of mixed affliction and wisdom purified
- False part of affliction removed
- Pure wisdom of remainder manifests
**Pure Not Established as False:**
The pure is not merely false aspects and consciousness.
**Manifest Attachment:**
Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated in the small work of mind.
**Appearance as Reflection:**
Objects appear as various white and red aspects, like reflections.
Both measurer and measured non-existent, yet appearing.
**Analysis:**
**Dream and Illusion:**
All phenomena like dream, like illusion (*rmi lam sgyu ma lta bu*).
All phenomena merely various objects and consciousness.
**Nirvana Attains Form-Body:**
Nirvana works benefit through form-body.
**Excellent Dharma:**
One's own self-aware suchness and supreme dharma-body.
**Autonomous Lower (*rang rgyud 'og ma*):**
Those who assert:
- Illusion as established reasoning (*sgyu ma grub pa'i rigs pa*)
- Appearance as merely illusion (*snang ba sgyu ma tsam*)
- Merely illusion — various divisions beyond measure
**Second Position:**
In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides.
- No objects or aspects
- Self-aware experience does not exist
- Like barren woman's son
- No meeting consciousness
**Conventional Truth Not True:**
Since conventional truth is not true, ultimate truth is non-abiding.
