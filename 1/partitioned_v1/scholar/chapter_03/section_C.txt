|---------|---------|-------------|
| Definition | *ma bcos rang shar bzhag pas gang nas kyang ma yin la* | Unfabricated self-arisen placing, from nowhere |
| Nature | *stong nyid ma bcos pa'i gzhi yin pas* | Unfabricated emptiness ground |
| Result | *mthong shes gnyis su med pa* | Seeing-knowing non-dual |
**Quotation [3857-3858]:**
*stong ngo kun tu bzang las 'das* — "Emptiness transcends Samantabhadra"
**Philological Note:** The progression shows increasing subtlety: ornament (appearances), play (activity), dharmatā (ground).
[3859-3869] [CONTEXT] Introduction to Instruction Section
**Analysis:** Lines 3859-3869 transition to the Instruction Section (*man ngag gi sde*), establishing its superiority through simile.
**Characterization [3859-3860]:**
- Superior to previous approaches (*de dag las khyad par du 'phags pa*)
- Directly speaking path (*lam drang thad du smra ba*)
- Like meeting crucial fire-fang (*gnad la thebs pa'i me btsa' dang 'dra*)
**Key Metaphor:**
*ngo bo gnad du 'gro ba gnad la thebs pa* — "Essence going to crucial point, striking crucial"
This metaphor (*me btsa'* — cauterization/fire-fang) indicates the immediate, penetrating nature of direct pointing-out instructions.
**Three Divisions [3861-3864]:**
| # | Tibetan | Translation | Characteristic |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | *kha 'thor ba'i tshul du gsungs pa* | Spoken in scattered manner | Disconnected points |
| 2 | *kha gtam pa'i tshul du gsungs pa* | Spoken as advice/discussion | Conversational |
| 3 | *rgyud rang gzhung gi tshul du bka' sts pa* | Spoken as tantra own-text | Authoritative |
**Scattered Essence Subdivisions [3867-3869]:**
| # | Tibetan | Function |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | *gzhag pa lam gyi mtha' gcod pa'i man ngag* | Placing path cutting extreme instruction |
| 2 | *grol ba stobs dag pa'i lam mngon du gyur pa'i man ngag* | Liberation-force-pure path manifest instruction |
[3870-3882] [CONCEPT] Cutting the Root of Samsara
**Analysis:** Lines 3870-3882 present the first scattered instruction — cutting the extreme through placing.
**Essence [3870-3874]:**
The instruction reveals that:
- Great emptiness pervades (*stong pa khyab che ba*)
- Action universally plays without reference (*bya ba kun tu rol ba'i lam la ltos pa med pa*)
- No distinction made from ground (*gzhi las khyad par du 'jog pa'i dus na*)
- Proliferation basis words do not exist (*spros gzhi'i tshig tsam du yang ma grub pa*)
- Therefore, proliferating names impossible (*spros byed ming du mi srid*)
**Key Formulation [3874-3876]:**
*brjod du med pa'i chos nyid la yi ge med pa zhes bya ste* — "Inexpressible dharmatā is called 'without letters'"
**Soteriological Mechanism [3875-3876]:**
| Aspect | Function | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| *bya ba rgyu med pa'i gtan tshigs* | Action-without-cause reasoning | *'khor ba dong sprugs pa* — Expelling samsara |
| *'das pa'i khong 'don pa* | Expressing past (understanding) | Liberation achieved |
**Second Instruction Preview [3877-3882]:**
*chos nyid gnas pa'i cha nas sems la 'gyur ba med la* — "From dharmatā abiding aspect, no change in mind"
When three kāyas appear on the path:
- Nothing unliberated (*ma grol ba gang yang med*)
- At result striking crucial point (*'bras bu gnad la phebs pa'i dus na*)
- Dharmatā meets mother (*chos nyid ma dang phrad par 'dod pa*)
**Philosophical Significance:**
These instructions establish the Atiyoga path as:
1. **Non-progressive** — no stages to traverse (*lam du byed pa* is metaphorical)
2. **Immediate** — recognition (*ngos 'dzin*) rather than transformation
3. **Non-dual** — ground-path-result are not different substances
4. **Self-liberating** — delusions liberate themselves upon recognition
[3870-3882] [CONCEPT] Two Crucial Instructions

*View Three Stages:*
1. Moving: Samsara dharmatā recognized like thief [3931]
2. Obtained: Body-speech heat arises like fire-wood [3932-3933]
3. Stable: Samsara side split like army victory [3934-3935]
*Meditation Three Stages:*
4. Moving: Wind-mind rich-entered like rich treasury [3936-3937]
5. Obtained: Mind path-entered like pig in ravine [3938-3939]
6. Stable: Awareness power obtained like royal empowerment [3940]
*Conduct Three Stages:*
7. Moving: Consciousness reference lost, heart-wind agitation [3941]
8. Obtained: Delusion-appearance suppressed like garuda wing [3942-3943]
9. Stable: Three bodies heat obtained like Brahmin woman [3944-3945]
**Conclusion [3946-3949]:**
- Conduct clears appearance, appearance-condition no go-place in dharmatā
- Meditation moving obstacle cleared, recollection-thought samadhi no go
- View dharmatā obstacle cleared, not depending on dharmas, become Buddha
- Entity abiding: dharmatā unfabricated, whatever appears not non-mind
[3950-3971] [CONCEPT] Hidden-Revealed Instructions

- Delusion basis confidence, delusion-wheel continuum severed
[3977-3988] [STRUCTURE] Two Approaches to Error Reversal
**Analysis:** Lines 3977-3988 introduce two methods of reversing error/delusion (*'khrul pa*), followed by three detailed approaches.
**Initial Presentation:**
| Method | Tibetan | Mechanism | Lines |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| First | *'khrul pa gzhi la zlog pa'i tshul du gsungs pa* | Reversing delusion to ground | 3977 |
| Second | *thig le rang gnad la phab te gsungs pa* | Placing thigle at its own crucial point | 3978 |
**Note:** Line 3979 begins detailed exposition of the first method — cutting the root of delusion.
[3979-3992] [PHILOLOGY] Three Error Reversal Systems
**Analysis:** Lines 3979-3992 present the detailed terminology of three approaches to reversing fundamental ignorance.
**First Approach: Root Cut (*rtsad gcod*) [3979-3992]:**
**Essence [3979-3981]:**
- Delusion root = non-awareness (*ma rig pa*)
- Basis of three realm samsara (*khams gsum 'khor ba'i gzhi*)
- When driven to self = ignorance cut at root (*ma rig pa rtsad bcad*)
- Called: self-awareness (*rang rig pa*)
**Key Term:** *rtsad bcad* — "cut at root" — definitive severing, not gradual elimination.
**Nature Analysis [3982-3983]:**
- Nature arises variously (*rang bzhin sna tshogs su byung bas*)
- Therefore causal-conditional searching (*rgyu rkyen gyi ba ded pa*)
- Object's vital point cut (*dmigs pa'i gdar sha chod*)
- Samsara's delusion basis exhausted (*'khor ba 'khrul pa'i ltos zad*)
- Result: causeless-empty primordial purity (*rgyu med stong par ye dag pa*)
**Second Approach: Self-Liberated Placing [3993-3999]:**
| Aspect | Tibetan | Function |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Essence | *dang po 'khrul ma myong bas ma rig pa'i rgyud dag* | First not experienced delusion, ignorance continuum pure |
| Present | *da lta 'khrul pa la mi gnas pa* | Now not abiding in delusion |
| Future | *phyis 'khrul mi srid pa* | Future delusion impossible |
| Nature | *rang bzhin la dbyer med pas 'khor 'das gzhi gcig* | Without difference, samsara-nirvana ground one |
**Third Approach: Basis Confidence [4000-4004]:**
| Aspect | Tibetan | Significance |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Essence | *ltung byed gzhi stongs pas byas pas ma rnyed pa'i gzhi 'chos pa* | Falling-doer basis empty, unfound fabricated ground confidence |
| Nature | *rang bzhin rtsis las 'das pas 'khrul ma 'khrul tsam du yang grub pa med pa* | Beyond calculation, delusion-non-delusion not established |
| Characteristic | *mtshan nyid la gnyis ma grub pas 'khrul ma 'khrul gyi zla dang bral ba* | Two non-established, delusion-non-delusion companion free |
[4005-4028] [CONTEXT] Thigle Self-Abiding and Lineage Transmission
**Analysis:** Lines 4005-4028 would continue with the thigle (*thig le*) self-abiding approach and the two lineage systems.
**Thigle Self-Abiding (*thig le rang gnas*) [4005-4028]:**
| Element | Tibetan | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Essence | *nyag gcig spros pa dang bral ba* | Single, freedom from proliferation |
| Nature | *sna tshogs su snang yang tha dad ma yin* | Variously displaying, not different |
| Characteristic | *ngos 'dzin nges pa'i gdeng* | Introduced recognition, certainty-confidence |
**Two Lineages [4020-4028]:**
| Lineage | Tibetan | Transmission Type |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Aural | *snyan rgyud* | Direct ear-to-ear transmission |
| Explanation | *bshad rgyud* | Elaborated doctrinal transmission |
**Scriptural Context:**
These approaches are drawn from the *Man ngag gi sde* (Instruction Section) of Atiyoga, representing the pinnacle of the nine vehicles. The emphasis on *rang grol* (self-liberation) distinguishes Atiyoga from lower vehicles requiring antidotes (*gnyen po*).
[4028-4100] [CONCEPT] Philosophical Architecture of Error Reversal
**Analysis:** The three approaches present distinct philosophical methodologies for achieving liberation.
**Comparative Framework:**
| Approach | Method | Target | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Root Cut | Immediate recognition | Ignorance root | Primordial purity |
| Self-Liberated Placing | Natural resolution | Continuum of delusion | Basis empty |
| Basis Confidence | Calculative transcending | Establishment/non-establishment | Beyond both |
**Key Philosophical Distinctions:**
1. **Root Cut:** Emphasizes *ye nas* (primordial) — delusion never truly existed
2. **Self-Liberated:** Emphasizes *rang grol* (self-liberated) — delusion liberates itself
3. **Basis Confidence:** Emphasizes *gnad la phebs* (striking crucial point) — decisive breakthrough
**Soteriological Implications:**
The three approaches accommodate different cognitive styles:
- **Direct perceivers** → Root Cut
- **Sequential practitioners** → Self-Liberated Placing
- **Analytical minds** → Basis Confidence
All three achieve the same result: recognition that *'khrul pa* (delusion) and *ma 'khrul pa* (non-delusion) are not ultimately distinct (*zla dang bral ba* — without companion/opposite).
**Technical Terminology:**
- *gzhis gtad* (line 3980): "driving to ground" — redirecting delusion to its basis
- *rtsad bcad* (line 3980): "cut at root" — definitive severing
- *ltos zad* (line 3983): "basis exhausted" — fundamental resolution
- *gdar sha chod* (line 3983): "vital point cut" — decisive intervention
**Analysis:** Lines 4005-4009 conclude the Instruction Section:
**Thigle Self-Abiding [4005-4006]:**
- Nature: without many, beyond word-proliferation
- Dharmatā universally pervading
- Characteristics: introduced recognition, certainty-confidence
**Two Divisions [4007-4009]:**
- *snyan rgyud* — Aural lineage
- *bshad rgyud* — Explanation lineage
**Analysis:** Lines 4010-4024 present the two lineage types:
**Aural Lineage [4010-4014]:**
- Essence: one-to-one connection, particularly close
- Nature: ear faculty connection, uninterrupted by others
- Characteristics: unwavering, confident liberation
