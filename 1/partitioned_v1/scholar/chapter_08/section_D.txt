**Analysis:** This section presents the rtsod pa dgod pa (presentation of objection): If wind movement from channels is merely one ('gyu ba tsam du gcig), how can it divide into las dang ye shes gnyis so so (individual karma and wisdom)? Alternatively, if two different movements exist, how can they be one? If one, two is untenable; if merely one movement, neither saṃsāra nor nirvāṇa is tenable from a single basis. This objection invokes the principle of ekadravya (single substance) and its incompatibility with dvaya (duality).
**Analysis:** The lan (response) establishes that although movement is one, rtsa ma 'chus pa'i 'gyus pa (uncontracted channel movement) produces ye shes kyi rlung with functions of bliss, emptiness, and clear emptiness; rtsa'i gnas 'gyur 'chus pa (contracted/transformed channel location) produces las kyi rlung with functions of conceptual diversity, unvirtuous connections, obscurity, dullness, agitation, lethargy, and contraction. This medical-physiological explanation—channel constriction determines wind quality—provides the mechanism for dual outcomes from unitary substrate.
**Analysis:** The passage employs the simile (dpe) of ba tha ra'i bu (a single child) who becomes a tiger when angry, human when calm. The technical terms include: bde dbang (blissful sovereignty), stong pa (emptiness), gsal bar stong pa (clearly empty), rnam rtog tha dad pa (diverse conceptuality), mi dge ba'i sbyor ba (unvirtuous connections), mi gsal ba (non-clarity), bying ba (dullness), rgod pa (agitation), rmugs pa (lethargy), 'khyil ba (contraction). These describe the phenomenological qualities distinguishing wisdom from karma winds.
**Analysis:** The key conceptual distinction emerges: rig pa'i gdang (awareness's resonance/vibration) and lus kyi rtsa nas 'gyu ba'i rlung (body's channel-moving wind) are one in movement alone. However, rtsa 'chus ma 'chus (whether channels are contracted or not) determines whether shes pa becomes las su rung ba (suitable for action/wisdom) or ma rung ba las nyon mongs su 'gyur ba (unsuitable, becoming affliction). This establishes the physiological basis for soteriological transformation—channel manipulation affects wind quality, affecting consciousness.
**Analysis:** The passage enumerates four ye shes (wisdoms) produced by wisdom wind's functions: (1) gzhi gnas kyi ye shes—ground-abiding wisdom from the abiding aspect; (2) mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i ye shes—characteristic-holding wisdom from the appearance aspect; (3) shes byas bsdus pa'i ye shes—wisdom gathering knowables from the production aspect; (4) shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes—wisdom gathering through consciousness from the movement aspect. These correspond to the four aspects (gnas pa, snang ba, skye ba, 'gyu ba) of wind function.
[1-13] [CONCEPT] Wisdom Functions and Their Results
**Analysis:** This passage elaborates the functional outcomes of wisdom wind: ground-abiding wisdom establishes that however appearances arise, they cannot alter from atop gnas lugs (abiding mode/ground condition). Characteristic-holding wisdom produces recognition of individual rigs (families), sku (bodies), ye shes (wisdoms), 'od (lights), and kha dog (colors) without possibility of transition ('da' mi srid). Wisdom gathering through knowables produces unobstructed benefit for self and others. Wisdom gathering through consciousness produces diverse worldly and transcendent knowing without self/other grasping. These four correspond to the gzhi lam 'bras gsum (ground, path, result) framework—four at cause, four at path as ultimate elements, four at result as four bodies.
[13-20] [STRUCTURE] Twelvefold Buddha Activity Correlation
**Analysis:** The passage establishes that through considering ground, path, and result, the twelve aspects (bcu gnyis) explain the rgyu mtshan (cause/condition) for sangs rgyas kyi mdzad pa bcu gnyis (twelve Buddha activities) to occur. This numerological correspondence—four wisdoms × three stages = twelve activities—demonstrates the systematic integration of subtle body physiology with hagiographical classification. The bcu gnyis reference likely indicates the twelve great deeds of the Buddha (bdud bzhi 'dul ba, lha bab, chos 'khor, etc.).
[20-29] [PHILOLOGY] Karma Wind Functions: Four-fold Enumeration
**Analysis:** The passage enumerates four functions of las kyi rlung: (1) g.yas nas rgyu bas pho—rightward movement produces male [offpring]; (2) g.yon nas rgyu bas mo—leftward movement produces female; (3) phyir 'ong bas—outward return produces diverse appearance engagement; (4) nang du 'gengs pas—internal filling produces diverse conceptual proliferation. These correspond to pha dang ma'i dbang (father-mother dominance) and 'gro 'ong gi dbang (movement dominance). The outward movement produces nyin mo'i snang ba (daytime appearance); inward movement produces mtshan mo'i snang ba (nighttime appearance).
[29-29] [CONTEXT] Multiplication to Twenty-four Aspects
**Analysis:** The text notes that counting the four functions as pairs (gnyis gnyis su bgrangs) yields eight; counting by partial aspects (cha shas kyis bgrangs) yields twenty-four (nyi shu rtsa bzhi). This numerological elaboration demonstrates the analytical sophistication of the tradition—systematically deriving subcategories through combinatorial logic. The twelve 'gyus pa'i byed las (contracted functions) of las rlung produce twelve external years, twelve internal months, twelve secret periods.
[1-7] [STRUCTURE] Establishing Transformation Measures
**Analysis:** This section fulfills the third division—'gyur tshad gtan la dbab pa (definitive establishment of transformation measures). The base calculation: for one person matured in body in prime condition (lus su smin nas na tshod dar la bab pa), the daily 'byung bzhi so so'i rlung gi 'gyur tshad (individual four-element wind transformation measure) is: sa'i rlung = 5,400; chu, me, rlung winds also 5,400 each; total = 21,600. This establishes the standard wind count for prime adulthood.
[7-14] [PHILOLOGY] Age-based and Condition-based Variations
**Analysis:** The text notes variations: gzhon pa (youth) lacks 360 [winds] due to undeveloped elements ('byung ba ma rgyas pas); rgas pa (aged) lacks 558 due to deteriorated elemental order ('byung ba'i gral nyams pas). The prognostic correlation: rlung gi 'pho ba ring na tshe mthar skyol (long transference reaches life-end); thung na mi skyol (short does not reach). The terms drag na (if forceful), zhen na (if attached), dal na (if slow), bul na (if sluggish) establish the quality-based prognostic indicators.
[14-36] [CONTEXT] Wind Quality Pathologies and Characteristics
**Analysis:** The passage presents extensive pathological correlations: drag → bsod nams/long, but suffering if attached; dal → illness-free cyclic existence; bul → weapon accumulation, non-virtuous mind; 'byil → constant non-virtue, fluctuating vitality; rgod → agitated mind, unkindness; rab tu rgod → quick death-time; bying → suffering, grief, lamentation; 'khyor → mind not reaching abiding mode, non-virtue; dal → life-end expansion, constant bliss; 'khyig → constant enemies, litigation basis; 'khyog → activity-attachment, short life; 'gyur → great resources but illness; rgal → unsuccessful body-speech actions; 'phel → quick accomplishment of peaceful/expanding activities.
[36-41] [STRUCTURE] Life-span Calculation by Wind Deficiency
**Analysis:** The text establishes specific life-span reductions based on wind deficiency from the prime 21,600: lacking 300 → one year death-time; lacking 50 → two years; lacking 32 → three years; lacking 21 → four years; 1/8 lacking → seven months; 1/6 lacking → five months; 1/4 lacking → one month; 1/10 lacking → 29 days; lacking 20 → 18 days; lacking 30 → 10 days; lacking 40 → 7 days; lacking 60 → 5 days. This establishes the precise arithmetic correlation between wind decline and temporal prognostication.
[41-41] [CONCEPT] Two-fold Soteriological Application
**Analysis:** The passage distinguishes two applications of rlung gi rtsis sbyor (wind calculation): 'jig rten pa (worldly)—calculating tshe (lifespan), bsod nams (merit), bde sdug (pleasure/pain); 'das pa (transcendent)—divided into 'gyur tshad (transformation measure) and 'pho dus (transference time). Daytime divides into twelve transformations for elemental function activities and virtue/non-virtue conceptuality; nighttime has similar divisions but emphasizes ye shes kyi rlung 'phel (wisdom wind increase).
[1-11] [STRUCTURE] Life-span Deficiency Calculations (Continued)
**Analysis:** This passage completes the arithmetic progression of life-span reductions based on wind deficiency: lacking 50 winds → two years; lacking 32 → three years; lacking 21 → four years; 1/8 (2,700) lacking → seven months; 1/6 (3,600) lacking → five months; 1/4 (5,400) lacking → one month; 1/10 (2,160) lacking → 29 days; lacking 20 → 18 days; lacking 30 → 10 days; lacking 40 → 7 days; lacking 60 → 5 days. The systematic reduction demonstrates the precise mathematical framework underlying Tibetan prognostic calculations.
[11-25] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Transformation Terminology
**Analysis:** The passage establishes two-fold calculation: 'jig rten pa (worldly) calculates tshe (lifespan), bsod nams (merit), bde sdug (pleasure/pain); 'das pa (transcendent) calculates 'gyur tshad (transformation measure) and 'pho dus (transference time). Daytime (nyin mo'i cha) transforms into twelve parts for elemental function activities; nighttime (mtshan mo'i cha) transforms into sixteen parts. The 'pho dus (transference times) were previously explained (bshad zin to).
[25-49] [CONTEXT] Introduction to Bindu (Thig Le) Classifications
**Analysis:** This section initiates don gsum pa (third topic)—gnas pa thig le'i rab tu dbye ba (detailed classification of abiding bindu). The passage cites *Thal 'gyur* root verses establishing the framework: thig le'i chos nyid (bindu reality) is taught from don dam (ultimate) and kun rdzob (conventional) perspectives. Initially, those desiring buddhahood rely upon rigs ma (consorts) with complete mtshan nyid (characteristics)—including lha (gods), lha min (demigods), tshangs pa (brahmins), rigs ngan (low caste), mu stegs (tīrthikas). Upon seeing complete characteristics, one begins the 'gugs pa'i sbyor ba (magnetizing practice) of bsten bya (relying upon), channels, and dmigs bya (observed objects) for lus rdzogs (body completion).
[38-49] [CONCEPT] Two Truths Framework for Bindu Practice
**Analysis:** The passage establishes the two-truth hermeneutic for bindu practice: (1) kun rdzob thig le (conventional bindu) involves dbab (descending), gzung (holding), bzlog (reversing), gdab (striking), bsre (mixing); (2) don dam thig le (ultimate bindu) involves bsten pa (relying upon) chos sku stong pa'i yul (dharmakaya empty objects), gtem te rig pa'i rtsal rnams sbyang (covering and training awareness's intensities), nyin mtshan med par goms sbyong (day-night uninterrupted cultivation). The result: rtsol bral mngon du snang (effortless direct appearance), the measure of 'byongs (mastery/purification).
[49-49] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Next Section
**Analysis:** The passage concludes with /zhes gsungs te/ (thus it was taught), marking the completion of the *Thal 'gyur* citation. This standard citation closure indicates the transition from scriptural authority to subsequent commentary or next topic division. The structure maintains the pattern of root-text citation followed by analytical commentary throughout the chapter.
