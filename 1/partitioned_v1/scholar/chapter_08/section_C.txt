**PAGE SUMMARY:**
Page 369 continues channel practice instructions from 368, completing the four-element meditation and detailing seven channel manipulation techniques. The diagnostic system uses quantitative channel movement (64,800/day baseline) to assess health, lifespan, karma, and spiritual progress. The integration of medical diagnostics (wind/bile/phlegm) with yogic wisdom-temporal analysis exemplifies Tibetan Buddhism's synthetic approach to somatic spirituality.

**FILES CREATED:** 9 separate .txt files (one per page) following khenpo.md standards with STRUCTURE, PHILOLOGY, CONTEXT, and CONCEPT pillars.
[1-5] [STRUCTURE] Enumeration of the Four Auspicious Conditions
**Analysis:** The passage opens with a four-fold enumeration (bsdus pa) listing bsod nams (merit), longs spyod (resources/provisions), dbang thang (power/sovereignty), and dar rgud (prosperity/decline). This structural device establishes the soteriological calculus framework wherein the practitioner masters elemental prognostication ('byung ba rtsis sbyor). The progression from positive to bipolar (dar rgud) conditions mirrors the tantric integration of cyclic existence patterns.
[6-16] [CONTEXT] Integration of Four Seasonal Cycles with Three Vajras
**Analysis:** The text correlates the four seasonal wheels ('khor lo bzhi dus) with the three vajras (lus, ngag, yid) plus sems, creating a four-fold correspondential system. Spring (dpyid/skyed byed) correlates with body and its 'khrul 'khor, summer (dbyar/dran pa) with speech, autumn (ston/ro rnams) with mind, and winter (dgun/rtse mo) with consciousness. This framework derives from rDzogs chen physiological cosmology, where seasonal elemental shifts mirror subtle body transformations. The "one taste" (tha mi dad par) instruction indicates non-dual integration of these dimensions.
[17-20] [PHILOLOGY] Correspondence of Seed Syllables to Four Dharmatā States
**Analysis:** The passage establishes a technical correspondence between seed syllables and consciousness states: (1) ཨ (A) at skyed byed's hub correlates with the diversity-emptying dharmatā state; (2) ཨཾ (AM) at dran pa correlates with dharmatā abiding; (3) ཧཱུྃ (HUM) at ro rnams correlates with dream-state dharmatā; (4) ཧ (HA) at rtse mo's hub correlates with samādhi dharmatā. The syllable selection follows tantric phonological symbolism—A represents unborn dharmatā, HUM represents vajra mind. The term gnas pa (abiding state) is used technically to denote specific modal configurations of chos nyid.
[21-24] [CONCEPT] The Four Stages of Yoga Concealment Practice
**Analysis:** This passage presents the four progressive concealments (sba ba) of the sbyor so bzhi: (1) rtog pa tha dad pa sba ba—concealing conceptual diversity by mixing with 'gyu ba rlung; (2) gti mug dran med du sba—concealing ignorance in non-memory; (3) bag chags snga phyi rang dag tu sba—concealing former/latter karmic traces in self-purification; (4) dga' bde 'dzin med rang grol du sbas pa—concealing bliss in non-grasping self-liberation. These stages represent the severing (rgyun chad pa) of the six destinies' karma and traces, corresponding to advanced phyag rgya chen po practices of self-liberation without renunciation.
[25-43] [STRUCTURE] Delineation of Dependent Wind Categories
**Analysis:** This section initiates the second major topic (don gnyis pa) on wind-dependence classifications, citing the *Thal 'gyur* text as scriptural authority. Two primary wind categories are enumerated: 'gyu ba chen mo'i rlung (major mobile wind) at 21,600 movements, and 'gyu ba chung ba'i rlung (minor mobile wind) at 112,600 movements. The passage provides a detailed philological analysis of wind enumeration terminology: khri (10,000), 'bum (100,000), stong (1,000), brgya (100). The functional classification (byed las) into ascending (gyen la rgyu) and descending (thur du sel) movements reflects the fundamental prāṇa/apāna polarity in subtle body energetics. The gnad (crucial point) instruction indicates practical meditative application.
[40-43] [PHILOLOGY] Enumeration of Wind Counts and Functions
**Analysis:** The text specifies: major wind = 21,600 movements (nyi khri chig stong drug brgyad), minor wind = 112,600 movements ('bum gcig dang khri gnyis stong drug dang brgya drug). The byed las (function) is twofold: upward movement (gyen la rgyu) and downward elimination (thur du sel). The technical term 'gyu ba is polysemous, referring both to "movement" and to the specific vital wind classification. The passage anticipates subsequent discussion of nad (illness), gdon (spirit obstacles), and tshe yi dus (life-span timing), establishing the prognostic dimension of wind calculation.
[1-7] [STRUCTURE] Verse Conclusion on Individual Wind Functions
**Analysis:** The passage presents a five-line verse (tshigs su bcad pa) from root scripture enumerating the individualized functions of winds based on karmic differentiation. The structure follows a gaṇacakra pattern: so so'i las (individual karma), las dang ye shes (karma and wisdom), nyon mongs/rtog med (afflictions/non-conceptuality), so so'i grangs/tshad (individual numbers/measures), and sgom pa po'i rnam par sbyar (yogi's analysis). The concluding line/des ni so so'i rlung tshad zin/ indicates mastery of individual wind measures as the soteriological objective.
[8-12] [CONTEXT] Threefold Structure of the Wind Chapter
**Analysis:** This passage outlines the three-part structure (gsum ste) for determining the meaning of the foregoing scriptural citation: (1) spyir bstan pa—general presentation of definite movement locations; (2) bye brag tu bshad pa—particular explanation of definite transference ('pho ba) locations; (3) mjug bsdu ba—concluding summary through determination of ye shes/las rlung (wisdom/karma winds). This triadic structure mirrors traditional Tibetan scholastic presentation styles (bsdus don), moving from general to specific to synthesized conclusion.
[13-21] [STRUCTURE] Two-fold Wind Movement Classification
**Analysis:** This section establishes the fundamental wind classification: che ba (major) and chung ba (minor), corresponding to phyi 'gyu ba (outer movements) and nang 'gyu ba (inner movements). The text specifies that in a healthy person (skyes bu dar la bab pa nad med pa), the outer winds number 21,600 per day (nyin zhag phrug gcig). The term phrug indicates a complete day-night cycle. The inner winds, excluding the nose channels (kha sna ma gtogs pa), function as supports for conceptual consciousness (rtog pa) and wisdom consciousness (ye shes), numbering 112,600 through the 'phar rtsa (pulsing channels).
[21-27] [PHILOLOGY] Gender-based Wind Classification
**Analysis:** The text establishes a tripartite gender classification of winds: (1) pho rlung—male wind moving through the right nostril (sna bug g.yas); (2) mo rlung—female wind moving through the left nostril (g.yon); (3) ma ning gi rlung—neuter wind with equal movement (cha mnyam). The technical phrase 'byung ba lnga'i rlung sems nges pas indicates that through determining the five-element winds and mind, one can correlate with the four time transference points (dus bzhi'i 'pho dus). The prescription that men train primarily in female wind, women in male wind, and both in neuter wind reflects the tantric principle of balancing polar energies for wisdom wind cultivation.
[28-44] [CONCEPT] Nine Crucial Points of Wind Yoga
**Analysis:** This passage enumerates nine gnad (crucial points/pith instructions) for wind practice derived from three modalities: gyen rgyu (upward movement), thur sel (downward elimination), and mnyam gnas (balanced abiding). The nine techniques are: (1) steng rlung mnan pa—pressing upper winds; (2) 'og rlung bsdu ba—gathering lower winds; (3) bar rlung bskyil ba—holding middle winds; (4) mda' ltar 'phang ba—shooting like an arrow; (5) lcags kyu ltar dgug pa—hooking like an iron hook; (6) bum pa can du bskyil ba—holding like a vase; (7) chu srin chings su bsdams pa—binding like a crocodile knot; (8) ri bo ltar mnan pa—pressing like a mountain; (9) sbubs mchu ltar bsdu ba—gathering like a beak-cavity. These techniques represent a comprehensive subtle body manipulation system for wind control.
[41-44] [CONTEXT] Concluding Practice Instructions
**Analysis:** The passage concludes with four additional instructions: (1) rtsa gnas su dgram pa—arranging at the channel abode; (2) rang gnas su gzhil ba—releasing in natural abode; (3) nam mkha' ltar chos nyid du la bzla ba—reversing into dharmatā like space; (4) dgus nyams su blang bar bya'o—cultivating through the nine [techniques]. The progression moves from deliberate placement through natural release to ultimate reversal, following the rDzogs chen trajectory of effort-to-effortlessness.
[1-7] [CONTEXT] Particular Explanation of Definite Transference
**Analysis:** This section fulfills the second division (gnyis pas) announced previously, presenting the 'pho ba nges pa'i gnad (crucial points of definite transference) in particularized explanation. The framework correlates the four seasons with elemental wind qualities: winter produces chab rom (waterfall-like) wind that transforms into me rlung (fire wind) at death-time; spring produces sa bon (seed-like) wind transforming into chu'i rlung (water wind); summer produces me stag (fire-spark) wind transforming into sa rlung (earth wind); autumn produces me tog (flower) wind transforming into rlung gi rlung (wind wind). This seasonal-elemental correspondence determines critical lifespan transitions.
[8-15] [STRUCTURE] Temporal Wind Transference Patterns
**Analysis:** The passage presents four time-based transference patterns (rim pa): daytime me rlung becoming chu rlung causes illness; nighttime chu rlung becoming sa rlung causes illness; twilight sa becoming rlung causes illness; evening rlung becoming me rlung causes illness. This four-fold temporal structure (nyin/mtshan/nang/nub dus) establishes the prognostic framework for determining inauspicious periods based on elemental disharmonies.
[16-25] [PHILOLOGY] Elemental Pathology Terminology
**Analysis:** The text enumerates illness categories by element: mkhris pa (bile/fire disorders) from me rlung, bad kan (phlegm/water disorders) from chu, rlung nad (wind disorders) from rlung, and two combined categories—ldan pa (possessing/associated, i.e., two combined) and 'dus pa (accumulated, i.e., three or more combined). The term ldan pa indicates dual-element pathologies, while 'dus pa indicates complex multi-element conditions. This reflects the rgyud bzhi (Four Tantras) medical classification system integrated with subtle body energetics.
[25-33] [CONCEPT] Wind-Element Physiological Functions
**Analysis:** This passage details specific physiological functions attributed to elemental wind interactions: chu'i rlung purifies chu ser (lymph) and regulates blood/flesh purification; chu'i sa constricts/expands water channels; chu'i chu governs oral and ocular moisture; sa'i sa produces flesh, fat, bones, marrow, and byang sems (bodhicitta/sexual essence) in five stages; sa'i chu performs thig le (bindu/essence) functions including conception mechanics; sa'i me produces heat for digestion and the four activities of birth, aging, sickness, death; sa'i rlung produces strength, vitality, movement, and body heat. These functions demonstrate the comprehensive somatic mapping in Tibetan subtle body theory.
[33-42] [CONTEXT] Reproductive Physiology Technicalities
**Analysis:** The sa'i chu (earth-water) functions govern reproductive physiology through thig le (bindu) operations. The text describes: dngul chu'i dum bu (mercury-like globule) preventing conception; rta rnga'i mdud pa (horse-drum knot) producing female offspring; mig ka chung (small eye-opening) producing male offspring. These technical terms reflect Tibetan embryological theories correlating subtle energetic patterns with gender determination, derived from both medical (gso ba rig pa) and tantric (sngags) traditions.
[42-48] [STRUCTURE] Concluding Elemental Functions
**Analysis:** The passage concludes the elemental enumeration with remaining functions: sa'i rlung produces sensory faculties (dbang po) and their supports (dbang rten); sa'i rlung generates karma and conceptual thought; rlung gi me produces cognitive intensities (shes pa'i rtsal ba)—light (yang ba), heavy (lci ba), excited (mched pa), dull ('ur ba), full (gang ba), empty (stongs pa). The section transitions to rlung gi rlung controlling respiration and specific gender-related pathologies, establishing the comprehensive scope of wind-element physiology.
[1-2] [PHILOLOGY] Wind-Movement Somatomotor Functions
**Analysis:** The text lists two additional functions of sa'i rlung (earth wind): sgul skyod (movement/motion) and zha grum (shivering/trembling). These terms describe gross motor functions and thermoregulatory responses. The la sogs pa (and so forth) indicates the enumerative principle—list completion through typical exemplification rather than exhaustive cataloguing.
[3-20] [CONTEXT] Menstrual Cycle Pathology and Prognostication
**Analysis:** This extensive passage addresses me'i rtsa rlung (fire-channel wind) effects on reproductive physiology. The four dri chu (menstrual fluid) qualities—bsri ba (retarded), 'phrim pa (diminished), 'thor ba (scattered), khugs pa (concentrated)—determine diagnostic outcomes. Pathological manifestations include: loss of virility, constant numbness (rengs pa), untimely seminal emission, failure to rise without stimulus or failure despite stimulus for males; menstrual blockages, untimely flows, and irregular periodicity for females. The text provides specific prognostic rules: 2nd-3rd day pure flow in waxing moon → male offspring; 15th day flow → female offspring; waning moon constant flow → female/mixed offspring. Heavy clotting (khrag mang ba) on the 22nd or 5th day results in infertility (bu tsha gang yang mi 'byung).
[20-26] [CONCEPT] Cognitive and Physiological Wind Functions
**Analysis:** The passage presents comprehensive wind-function correlations: sa'i rlung produces faculties and supports, generating karma and conceptuality; rlung gi me produces six cognitive intensities (rtsal ba); rlung gi rlung controls respiration; rlung gi chu ceases conceptuality (rtog pa 'gag). The gender-specific pathologies—smig lo'i nad (conjunctivitis) for women during pregnancy conception, chang gi nad (alcohol-intoxication disorder) for men—reflect the medical understanding of wind-imbalance etiologies.
[26-35] [STRUCTURE] Combined Elemental Wisdom Functions
**Analysis:** This section enumerates specialized functions from combined elements: sa'i rlung produces limb extension/retraction; me'i rlung produces diverse afflictive intensities; rlung gi rlung mixed with me produces: (1) various prajñā intensities; (2) wondrous metaphorical discernment; (3) doctrinal mastery; (4) knowledge of female service; (5) mastery of body-speech transformations. This progression demonstrates how elemental combinations yield higher cognitive faculties, reflecting the soteriological trajectory from basic physiology to wisdom capacities.
[35-38] [PHILOLOGY] Seasonal Elemental Transformation
**Analysis:** The text presents the fundamental principle: 'byung bzhi'i skye ba'i rim pa (four elements' birth sequence) is determined by dbyar dgun ston dpyid (summer, winter, autumn, spring) transformations. The term gral 'pho (order transference) indicates systematic elemental rotation. The resulting manifestations—na ba (illness), tsha ba (fever), 'chi ba (death), and khyad par (special characteristics) of body-speech-mind activities—establish the prognostic implications of seasonal elemental dominance.
[38-42] [CONTEXT] Elemental Order Pathologies
**Analysis:** The passage describes four modes of 'byung ba'i gral (elemental order) dysfunction: nyams pa (deterioration), log pa (reversal), 'grus pa (aggravation), 'gyur ba (transformation). These determine four corresponding life-course disruptions (tshe nyams pa, log pa, 'grus pa, 'gyur ba). The diagnostic principle correlates past/future lifespan length with elemental stability—the longer the past life, the greater the transformation-based elimination; the longer the future life, the more stable the present abiding.
[1-15] [STRUCTURE] Definitive Calculation of Inner Transference
**Analysis:** This section establishes the precise calculation (nges pa'i tshad) of inner transference (nang gi 'pho ba). The base enumeration: for one healthy person in prime condition (skyes bu na tshod dar la bab pa), the daily wind count is 21,600 movements (nyi khri chig stong drug brgya). The text correlates this with chu tshod (water measures/hours) and dbyu gu (finger-widths/degrees) calculations: 8 thun (watches) per day, 32 thun tshod per watch, 64 dbyu gu, 16 'pho ba (transferences). Each 'pho ba contains 1,350 winds; each dbyu gu contains 338.5 winds; each thun contains 2,700 winds.
[15-27] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Measurement Terminology
**Analysis:** The passage presents technical temporal terminology: zhag (day), thun (watch/period), thun tshod (watch measure), dbyu gu (digit/degree), 'pho ba (transference). The twelve 'byung ba'i byed las (elemental functions) produce twelve phyer zug (penetrations/extensions), showing the relationship between elemental activities and wind expansion/contraction. The text notes that 'phel 'grib (waxing/waning) is determined by 675 wind movements (drug brgya dang bdun cu rtsa lnga), correlated with seasonal changes.
[27-37] [CONTEXT] Astronomical Correlation with Wind Calculation
**Analysis:** The passage cites the 'grel pa pad+ma dkar po (White Lotus Commentary): "byang lhor bgrod tshe snon 'brid bya"—when traversing north-south, add or subtract. This indicates the correlation between solar declination (nyi ma byang du 'gro ba) and day-length variation: northward movement increases daylight by two hours monthly, shortening night; southward movement reverses this. The text establishes that wind movement calculation must account for these seasonal astronomical variations for accurate prognostication.
[37-40] [CONCEPT] Calculating Definite Wind Enumeration
**Analysis:** The comprehensive calculation unfolds: one year = 12 months; 360 days; 720 meals (za ma). This yields 9,032.5 winds for the twelve periods of one day when calculated through the twelve-times-per-day method. Of these, 9,028 winds represent the measure of ye shes dag pa'i tshad (pure wisdom measure), while the remaining 4.5 represent glo bur ba rtog pa (sudden adventitious conceptuality). The five time periods (nyin lnga, mtshan lnga, nang nub gnyis) are calculated from the two equinoxes (ston dpyid kyi mnyam dus gnyis) as reference points.
[40-40] [CONTEXT] Vinaya Correlation for Solstice Determination
**Analysis:** The passage references 'dul ba (Vinaya) calculation of gso sbyong (soṣaṇa/restoration ceremony) feasibility—whether the full moon falls on the appropriate date or not. This establishes the orthographic correlation between Buddhist monastic law and astrological calculation, demonstrating the integration of vinaya observance with elemental wind prognostication.
[1-39] [STRUCTURE] Complete Correlation of External and Internal Time
**Analysis:** This section concludes the wind calculation definitiveness (rlung gi rtsis nges par zin pa) by correlating external time (phyi rol gyi lo dang zla ba) with internal time (nang gi nyin zhag gi dus). The four seasons (dbyar dgun ston dpyid) are divided into twelve months, and if one understands this 'khrul 'khor (wheel of confusion/error) without deviation (ma log), all appearances are established with certainty (snang ba thams cad gtan la phebs). This establishes the epistemological foundation—accurate wind calculation leads to definitive knowledge of phenomenal display.
[39-42] [PHILOLOGY] Root Text Citation Analysis
**Analysis:** The passage cites *Thal 'gyur* verses establishing basic temporal correlations: bcu phrag gsum (thirty) equals one zla ba (month); twelve [months] completed equals one lo (year); nang dang dgongs mo (day and night) totaling 720 completes zhag (days) as 360 for one year. The terminology bcu phrag indicates decimal grouping; zhag ni pho mo las kyis dbye indicates gender-based day classification. The twelve-year animal cycle (byi ba glang stag, etc.) completes the elemental calculations ('byung ba'i rtsis rnams spel ba).
[42-41] [CONTEXT] Conclusion of Wind Enumeration Section
**Analysis:** This passage initiates the third and final major division (gsum pa ye shes dang las rlung nges pas mjug bsdu ba) of the wind chapter—the concluding summary through determination of wisdom and karma winds. The tripartite structure (gsum ste) establishes: (1) 'thad pa spyir dgod—general establishment of tenability; (2) byed las so sor bshad—particular explanation of functions; (3) 'gyur tshad gtan la dbab pa—definitive establishment of transformation measures. This mirrors standard Tibetan scholastic hermeneutical structure.
[41-42] [STRUCTURE] Establishing Tenability: Two Subdivisions
**Analysis:** The first major subsection has two parts: 'thad pa dngos—actual tenability establishment, and de la rtsod pa spang ba—refutation of objections. The passage presents the fundamental premise: lus la rtsa gnas (channels abide in body), de la rlung gnas (winds abide in channels), rlung la ye shes dang las rlung gnyis su rgyu ba (wisdom and karma winds move in two ways). This establishes the ontological hierarchy: body → channels → winds → dual wind functions.
[42-44] [CONCEPT] Wisdom and Karma Wind Functions
**Analysis:** The text delineates the soteriological distinction: ye shes kyi rlung matures parinirvāṇa (mya ngan las 'das pa smin par byed); las rlung matures saṃsāra ('khor ba smin par byed). This dual function theory establishes the crucial premise—one wind substrate with divergent outcomes based on channel conditions, creating the framework for subsequent objection and response.
[1-7] [STRUCTURE] Objection and Response: The Dual Wind Problem
**Analysis:** This section presents the rtsod pa dgod pa (presentation of objection): If wind movement from channels is merely one ('gyu ba tsam du gcig), how can it divide into las dang ye shes gnyis so so (individual karma and wisdom)? Alternatively, if two different movements exist, how can they be one? If one, two is untenable; if merely one movement, neither saṃsāra nor nirvāṇa is tenable from a single basis. This objection invokes the principle of ekadravya (single substance) and its incompatibility with dvaya (duality).
[7-37] [CONTEXT] Response: Channel Condition Determines Wind Quality
**Analysis:** The lan (response) establishes that although movement is one, rtsa ma 'chus pa'i 'gyus pa (uncontracted channel movement) produces ye shes kyi rlung with functions of bliss, emptiness, and clear emptiness; rtsa'i gnas 'gyur 'chus pa (contracted/transformed channel location) produces las kyi rlung with functions of conceptual diversity, unvirtuous connections, obscurity, dullness, agitation, lethargy, and contraction. This medical-physiological explanation—channel constriction determines wind quality—provides the mechanism for dual outcomes from unitary substrate.
[37-44] [PHILOLOGY] Simile and Applied Terminology
**Analysis:** The passage employs the simile (dpe) of ba tha ra'i bu (a single child) who becomes a tiger when angry, human when calm. The technical terms include: bde dbang (blissful sovereignty), stong pa (emptiness), gsal bar stong pa (clearly empty), rnam rtog tha dad pa (diverse conceptuality), mi dge ba'i sbyor ba (unvirtuous connections), mi gsal ba (non-clarity), bying ba (dullness), rgod pa (agitation), rmugs pa (lethargy), 'khyil ba (contraction). These describe the phenomenological qualities distinguishing wisdom from karma winds.
[37-44] [CONCEPT] Rig pa'i gdang and Rtsa 'chus Ma 'chus
**Analysis:** The key conceptual distinction emerges: rig pa'i gdang (awareness's resonance/vibration) and lus kyi rtsa nas 'gyu ba'i rlung (body's channel-moving wind) are one in movement alone. However, rtsa 'chus ma 'chus (whether channels are contracted or not) determines whether shes pa becomes las su rung ba (suitable for action/wisdom) or ma rung ba las nyon mongs su 'gyur ba (unsuitable, becoming affliction). This establishes the physiological basis for soteriological transformation—channel manipulation affects wind quality, affecting consciousness.
[37-44] [STRUCTURE] Four Wisdom Functions of Wisdom Wind
**Analysis:** The passage enumerates four ye shes (wisdoms) produced by wisdom wind's functions: (1) gzhi gnas kyi ye shes—ground-abiding wisdom from the abiding aspect; (2) mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i ye shes—characteristic-holding wisdom from the appearance aspect; (3) shes byas bsdus pa'i ye shes—wisdom gathering knowables from the production aspect; (4) shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes—wisdom gathering through consciousness from the movement aspect. These correspond to the four aspects (gnas pa, snang ba, skye ba, 'gyu ba) of wind function.
