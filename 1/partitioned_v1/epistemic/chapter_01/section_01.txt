[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TITLE PROTOCOL]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
<Title page establishes *nges don* (definitive meaning) framing. The protocol "*theg mchog mdzod*" (Treasury of Supreme Vehicle) situates text within Atiyoga (*ati yoga*) as apex of nine vehicles—asserting direct recognition of awareness-nature (*rig pa*) over gradualist approaches. This is hermeneutical claim, not comparative evaluation.>

[5-15] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MANDALA HOMAGE]
[PRIMORDIAL COMPLETENESS]
<Homage structure encodes *phun sum tshogs lnga* (five perfections) mapped onto *sku gsum* (three bodies) framework. The fivefold prostration (*phyag 'tshal*) traces Samantabhadra (*kun tu bzang po*) → Five Families (*rigs lnga*) → Ocean Teacher (*gang chen mtsho*) → Five Vidyādharas (*rig 'dzin rnam lnga*) → Three Worlds' Ornament (*'jig rten gsum gyi rgyan*). This is not historical lineage but *dbyings* (expanse) topology—each "level" is simultaneous aspect of single recognition.>
---
[16-19] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GZHI CHARACTERIZATION]
[ONTOLOGICAL PRIMORDIALITY]
<Term *gdod nas rnam dag* (primordially pure) establishes ground (*gzhi*) as *spros kun zhi ba* (cessation of all elaborations) and *'dus ma byas* (uncompounded). The seven horses (*rta bdun*) metaphor references solar chariot—indicating *lhun grub* (spontaneous accomplishment) without causal dependence. Risk: Reifying "primordial" as temporal origin rather than timeless immediacy.>

[20-27] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VEHICLE HIERARCHY]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL ASSERTION]
<Longchenpa establishes *theg pa* (vehicle) triad: causal vehicles (*rgyu 'bras theg pa*) → secret mantra (*gsang sngags*) → Atiyoga (*rdzogs pa chen po*). The phrase *de dag nang nas* (among these) frames Dzogchen as *rtse mo* (pinnacle)—not superiority claim but *ngo bo gcig* (single nature) recognition. *Mngon sum snying po* (direct essence) points to immediate *de kho na nyid* (suchness) without *bya rtsol* (effort/contrivance).>
---
[28-35] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE KĀYA CLASSIFICATION]
[PEDAGOGICAL TOPOLOGY]
<Three-kāya (*sku gsum*) framework classified by *ston pa* (teacher), *gnas* (place), and *bstan pa* (teaching)—the *Chandragomin*-style triad applied to buddhology. Dharmakāya (*chos sku*) as *bdud rtsi* (nectar) indicates nature as restorative essence. The *gnas phun sum tshogs* (perfect place) as *chos nyid 'od gsal gyi gzhi* (ground of dharmatā luminosity) uses genitive *gyi* to assert identity—ground IS luminosity, not possessing it.>
[36-40] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMANTABHADRA NATURE]
[ONTOLOGICAL NON-DUALITY]
<Samantabhadra "abiding in state inseparable from kayas and wisdom" (*sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa*) describes *chos sku'i rang bzhin* (Dharmakāya nature) as *bya rtsol las 'das pa* (beyond activity/effort). The phrase *nang gsal phra ba'i ye shes* (inner clarity subtle awareness) points to *gdod ma'i dbyings* (primordial expanse)—not location but recognition-state. Risk: Reifying Samantabhadra as temporal being who "achieved" enlightenment.>
---
[41-45] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-DISPLAY COSMOLOGY]
[SPONTANEOUS MANIFESTATION]
<The "spontaneously manifesting pure realm" (*rang snang lhun grub*) emerges from *byin rlabs* (blessing) as *gzhi snang* (ground-appearance)—not external creation but *rang snang* (self-appearance) of awareness. Five lights (*'od lnga*) and five-family maṇḍala (*rigs lnga'i dkyil 'khor*) describe *ye shes lnga* (five wisdoms) as intrinsic display. The *las dang smon lam dag pa* (pure karma/aspiration) indicates recognition-condition, not merit accumulation.>
---
[46-51] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VAJRADHARA MANIFESTATION]
[QUALITY-COMPLETE EMBODIMENT]
<Vajradhara (*rdo rje 'chang*) manifestation as "sixth Buddha" from *longs sku* (Saṃbhogakāya) describes *yon tan rdzogs pa'i sku* (qualities-complete body)—not sixth in temporal sequence but *mtshan rdzogs* (complete marks) as display-nature. The retinue (*'khor*) of vidyādharas, ḍākinīs, and siddhas represents *rig pa* (awareness) recognizing itself through diverse forms. Tantra-ocean (*rgyud sde rgya mtsho*) teaching is *chos phun sum tshogs* (perfection of Dharma)—inexhaustible display.>
---
[52-56] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION TEACHING]
[SKILLFUL MEANS HIERARCHY]
<Nirmāṇakāya (*sprul sku*) teaching appears through *gang la gang 'dul* (whichever tames whichever)—the principle of *thabs* (skillful means) adapting to *gdul bya* (trainees). Sūtra, Vinaya, Abhidharma (*mdo sde, 'dul ba, mngon pa*) as *theg pa sna tshogs* (various vehicles) prepare for *'bras bu rdo rje'i theg pa* (result Vajra vehicle)—not linear prerequisite but recognition-ground preparation. The *phun sum tshogs pa lnga* (five perfections) structure maintained across all displays.>

[57-58] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VEHICLE BEYOND VEHICLES]
[TRANSCENDENT ASSERTION]
<Causal vehicles (*rgyu mtshan nyid kyi theg pa gsum*) function as *rgyu dang thabs* (cause and method) for entering Vajra vehicle—not denigration but functional classification. The *gsang sngags rdo rje theg pa* (secret mantra Vajra vehicle) culminates in *rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po* (nature Great Perfection) as *bla na med pa'i theg pa* (unsurpassable vehicle). "Beyond peak" (*rtse mo'i 'das pa*) indicates transcendence of vehicle-concept itself—*theg pa'i rtse mo* that is no vehicle.>
[59-60] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – OḌḌIYĀNA DOCTRINE]
[SECRET ESSENCE FRAMING]
<The "definite place" (*gnas nges pa*) of *'od gsal rdo rje snying po* (luminous vajra essence) teaching identifies Dzogchen as *de bzhin gshgs pa thams cad kyi thugs kyi gsang ba* (secret mind of all Tathāgatas). This is *yongs su rdzogs pa chen po* (complete Great Perfection)—not superior to other paths but *ngo bo gcig* (single nature) expressed through *rdo rje'i gnas* (vajra place) as *ngo mtshar rmad du byung ba* (wondrous marvel). The superlative asserts recognition-nature, not exclusivity.>

[61-64] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GŪHYAGARBHA CITATION]
[TANTRIC SCRIPTURAL AUTHORITY]
<Citation from *gsang ba rgyal po'i mdzod* (Guhyagarbha Tantra) grounds the exposition in *anuttarayoga* textual tradition. The "primordial protector" (*gdod ma'i mgon po*) manifesting awakening (*mngon par byang chub*) describes *ye shes* (primordial wisdom) not *shes bya* (learned knowledge). "How fields are arranged" (*zhing khams ji ltar bkod pa*) refers to *chos nyid* (dharmatā) topology—not physical cosmography but display-structure of recognition.>
---
[65-71] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TIMELESS SAMANTABHADRA]
[ATEMPORAL BUDDHAHOOD]
<The phrase *samsara-nirvana undifferentiated* ('khor 'das gang du'ang ma phyed) locates Samantabhadra's manifestation "before all" (*kun gyi sngon rol du*)—not temporal priority but ontological ground. *Dbyings rang byung gi ye shes* (self-arising wisdom of expanse) as *bder gshegs snying po* (sugata heart-essence) points to *gdod ma'i gzhi* (primordial ground) appearing as *gzhi snang* (ground-appearance). *Rang byung gi chos gsum* (three self-arisen dharmas) indicates spontaneous (*lhun grub*) display without construction.>

[72-75] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMBHOGAKĀYA EXPANSE]
[ENJOYMENT-BODY TOPOLOGY]
<From *that very nature* (*de nyid kyi ngang*), *ye shes lnga* (five wisdoms) purify into fields (*zhing khams*) as *rang snang lhun grub* (self-appearing spontaneous accomplishment). The *dpag tu med pa* (immeasurable) maṇḍala pervading space (*nam mkha'i mtha' klas pa*) describes *longs spyod rdzogs pa* (complete enjoyment) as inexhaustible display. "Beyond trainee's objects" (*gdul bya'i yul las 'das pa*) indicates transcendence of subject-object duality—not inaccessibility but recognition-requirement.>
---
[73-75] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COMPASSION ARISING]
[RESPONSIVE DISPLAY]
<Longchenpa describes *brtsye ba'i thugs rje* (compassion of tenderness) arising upon perceiving beings' confusion (*'khrul pa*) like dreams (*rmi lam*)—causeless confusion (*'khrul rgyu med*) appearing as confusion. This is *thabs* (skillful means) as natural response, not deliberative choice. The arrangement of fields (*zhing khams bkod pa*) for beings' benefit manifests from *longs sku snang cha* (Sambhogakāya appearance-aspect)—display itself is compassion. Risk: Reifying compassion as emotional state rather than natural responsiveness.>
[76-85] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PURE LAND ARCHITECTURE]
[SYMBOLIC COSMOLOGY]
<The elaborate maṇḍala description—mudra-jewel wheels (*phyag rgya rin po che'i 'khor lo*), five-family implements (*rigs lnga*), twenty-five fields (*zhing khams nyi shu rtsa lnga*) emerging from lotus pores (*padma 'khrungs pa*)—describes *longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku* (Saṃbhogakāya) as *rang snang* (self-appearance). The "stream of perfumed water" (*spos chu'i rgyun*) flowing from pores into great ocean (*gang chen mtsho*) symbolizes inexhaustible display (*mi zad pa*). This is not physical cosmography but recognition-topology.>

[86-97] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BUDDHA-FIELD PERMEATION]
[OMNIPRESENCE AS DISPLAY]
<Buddhas as numerous as atoms (*rdul phra ba*) in elements (earth, water, fire, wind) pervading all places (*go thams cad*) describes *sku gsung thugs yon tan 'phrin las* (body, speech, mind, qualities, activities) as intrinsic display. "Sky wherever pervaded, that extent" (*nam mkhas gang du khyab pa de tsam du*) indicates *chos dbyings* (Dharmadhātu) as unbounded. This is not quantitative claim but qualitative assertion of recognition-nature's omnipresence. Risk: Literalizing as physical astronomy.>
---
[98-105] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMANTABHADRA'S REALM]
[NON-DUAL SOURCE]
<The "single Samantabhadra's pure realm and activity" (*thog ma'i kun tu bzang po gcig gi gdul zhing dang mdzad pa*) asserts *gcig* (oneness) not as monotheism but as *ngo bo* (single nature). "Spontaneously manifesting Buddhas" (*rang bzhin lhun gyis grub pa'i sangs rgyas*) and "three kāya display" (*sku gsum gyi snang ba*) describe display-nature (*snang cha*) without external source. The *chos dbyings* as vast as sky (*nam mkha'i khams*)—immeasurable and without temporal origin (*thog ma med pa*).>
---
[106-109] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KĀYA CLASSIFICATION BY TIME]
[ATEMPORAL SIMULTANEITY]
<Three kāyas classified by "time" (*dus*): Dharmakāya (*chos sku*) as *'od gsal rdo rje snying po'i zhing khams* (luminous vajra-essence field); Saṃbhogakāya (*longs spyod rdzogs pa*) as *tshangs pa rnga sgra* (Brahma drum-sound field); Nirmāṇakāya (*sprul sku*) as *tshangs chen* (Great Brahma) or field. The temporal language (*dus na*) points to recognition-mode, not chronological sequence. All three are simultaneous aspects of single display.>
---
[110-111] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION HIERARCHY]
[SKILLFUL MEANS STRUCTURE]
<Samantabhadra's emanations (*sprul pa*) and empowered Buddhas (*byin gyis brlabs pa'i sangs rgyas*) teaching in three times (*dus gsum*) describe *thabs* (skillful means) adapting to *gdul bya* (trainees). This is not creation-theology but display-diversity (*sna tshogs*) of single recognition. The "great training-field" (*gdul zhing shin tu rgya che ba*) indicates inexhaustible capacity of awareness to recognize itself through myriad forms.>
[112-114] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SENTIENT BEING REALMS]
[INEXHAUSTIBLE DISPLAY]
<"All sentient being realms exist" (*sems can gyi khams thams cad yod de*)—the *khams* (realm/element) as ground of possibility. The training-field (*gdul zhing*) pervaded by earth, water, fire, wind, space (*sa chu me rlung nam mkha*) gathered within Great Brahma eon (*tshangs chen gyi bskal pa*) describes *snod bcud* (container/contained) as display-structure. This is not population census but assertion of recognition-nature's inexhaustible capacity.>

[115-122] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DREAM-LIKE APPEARANCE]
[ILLUSION DOCTRINE]
<Within each atom (*rdul phran re*), measureless fields (*zhing khams grangs med*) appear to confused perception (*'khrul snang*). "Like a dream" (*rmi lam lta bu*) and "clearly apparent yet non-existent" (*gsal snang yin pas 'thad pa*) describe *maya* (illusion) not as denial of appearance but as recognition of *rang snang* (self-appearance) nature. Pure karma (*las dag pa*) appears as Buddha-activity (*sangs rgyas kyi mdzad pa*)—samsara and nirvana as dual aspects of single display.>
---
[123-124] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DELUSION AS APPEARANCE]
[EMPTY DISPLAY]
<Mountains, continents (*ri dang gling*), and great fields appearing within single atom describe *'gro ba'i 'khrul snang* (beings' confused appearance). "Non-existent in truth" (*don la med pa*) points to *stong pa nyid* (emptiness) of all phenomena—not nihilistic denial but *gsal stong* (clarity-emptiness) unity. This is valid (*'thad pa*) because appearance and emptiness are non-dual (*dbyer med*). Risk: Misreading as ontological nihilism.>

[125-161] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMĀDHIRĀJA CITATION]
[SŪTRIC AUTHORITY FOR DZOGCHEN]
<Extensive citation from *'phags pa ting nge 'dzin rgyal po'i mdo* (Samādhirāja Sutra) establishes *gsung rab* (scriptural) grounding for Dzogchen view. Buddhas as numerous as Ganges sands (*gangga'i klung gi bye ma*) and fields likewise within hair-tip extent (*skra yi khyon*) describes *thogs med* (unobstructed) nature of recognition. Hell beings (*sems can dmyal ba*) and gods (*lha*) coexisting without mixing (*'dres pa med*) or harm (*gnod pa med*) points to *chos nyid* (dharmatā) beyond dualistic conflict.>

[162] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – INTERPENETRATION PRINCIPLE]
[HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY]
<"Within space of single atom... immeasurable arrangements" (*rdul gcig gi go sa... bkod pa tshad med*) encapsulates *sdong po bkod pa* (interpenetration) doctrine—each part contains whole, each instant contains eternity. This is not physical microcosm but description of *chos nyid* (dharmatā) as non-localizable and inexhaustible. The *sems can gyi zhing* (sentient being fields) are *sangs rgyas kyi yul* (Buddha object/wisdom) as recognition-nature itself.>
[163-170] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PERCEPTUAL HIERARCHY]
[COGNITIVE PLENITUDE]
<Citation from *sangs rgyas kyi yul dang ye shes bsam gyis mi khyab pa la 'jug pa'i mdo* (Avatamsaka/"Inconceivable Buddha Object and Wisdom" Sutra) establishes perceptual gradation: outsiders with clairvoyance (*phyi rol pa'i drang srong mngon shes can*) → śrāvakas → bodhisattvas → Tathāgatas, each "seeing more" (*mthong ba ches mang*) within chariot-wheel extent (*shing rta'i 'phang lo tsam*). This is not hierarchical ontology but description of *chos nyid* recognition—Buddha "sees" because there is nothing obscuring, not because of enhanced faculty.>

[171-176] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION PERMEATION]
[OMNIPRESENT SKILLFUL MEANS]
<Sky-pervading space (*nam mkhas gar khyab kyi gnas*) contains sentient beings pervaded by Buddha emanations (*sangs rgyas kyi sprul pas khyab*)—all activity (*don mdzad pa thams cad*) emerges from this recognition. Some directly (*dngos su*) through Samantabhadra's emanations, others through "other-tantra Buddhas" (*rgyud gzhan gyi sangs rgyas*)—all ultimately (*dang po*) from Samantabhadra showing path (*lam bstan*) and generating bodhicitta (*sems bskyed*). This is display-diversity, not historical genealogy.>

[177-179] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE JEWELS SEQUENCE]
[REFUGE ONTOLOGY]
<The sequence "Buddha from Dharma, Dharma from ārya hosts" (*sangs rgyas las chos chos las 'phags pa'i tshogs*) in *bstan bcos* (treatises) indicates pedagogical (*dgongs pa*) rather than temporal priority. The Three Jewels (*dkon mchog gsum*) are inseparable (*dbyer med*) in nature—sequence is expositional device. This guards against reifying Buddha as historical originator or Dharma as created teaching.>

[180-189] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VAJRADHARA DEBATE]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL RESOLUTION]
<The assertion that "first protector" (*thog ma'i mgon po*) generated bodhicitta for different-tantra beings (*rgyud tha dad pa'i sems can*) is rejected (*mi rigs te*) as contradicting *sgyu 'phrul rdo rje* (Māyājāla Tantra)—"first Buddha earth-Buddha" (*dang po'i rgyal ba sa rgyal ba*) and "teacher Vajradhara, Buddha before all Buddhas" (*ston pa rdo rje 'chang sangs rgyas kun bs snar sangs rgyas*). Longchenpa resolves: Vajradhara's emanations demonstrate (*bstan*) bodhicitta-generation as ordinary beings (*so so skye bo*)—not historical event but pedagogical display (*thun mong*).>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION AS TEACHING]
[SKILLFUL MEANS DEMONSTRATION]
<Samantabhadra's emanations "demonstrating the manner of generating bodhicitta" (*sems bskyed pa'i tshul bstan pa*) and opening great play (*mdzad pa chen po'i rol pa bkhye ba*) describes *thabs* (skillful means) functioning through apparent narrative. This is not historical biography but *dpe* (example) for recognition—"even ordinary beings can generate bodhicitta, therefore you can too." The *thun mong gi mdo sde* (common sūtras) also famous for such demonstrations.>
