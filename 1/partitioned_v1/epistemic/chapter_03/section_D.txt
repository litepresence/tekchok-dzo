[TEXTUAL LINEAGE]
<The *thig le rang gnad la phab pa* (drop established in self-essential-point) system's essence as singularly unique (*nyag gcig*), free from elaborations, without partiality—nature as non-multiple therefore dharmatā universally pervading beyond conceptual construction words; characteristics as introduction (*ngo sprod*) therefore confidence completely determined. This is *man ngag gi sde* (instruction series) pointing-out: direct introduction rather than philosophical argument. The division into *snyan rgyud* (oral/ear tantra) and *bshad rgyud* (explanation tantra) distinguishes transmission modes, not ontological categories.>

[FOURFOLD CYCLE CLASSIFICATION]
<The *bshad rgyud* (explanation tantra) fourfold cycle classification: outer (*phyi skor*)—afflictions without abandonment therefore five poisons (*dug lnga*) as path; inner (*nang skor*)—not material therefore signless dharmatā; secret (*gsang skor*)—introduction and realization obtained simultaneously therefore not dependent on hearing/contemplation/meditation (*thos bsam sgom gsum*); unsurpassed secret (*gsang ba bla na med pa'i skor*)—not depending on words therefore wisdom completely sufficient. These are progressive subtlety classifications for different capacities, not hierarchical truths.>

[SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
<The three nature-characteristic correlations in secret cycles: breath-ceased and Buddhahood simultaneous therefore not dependent on effort/accomplishment or habituation-power; Buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneous therefore not dependent on accumulations/merit. This is *lhun grub* (spontaneous accomplishment) framing—recognition's natural qualities (*yon tan*) are not cultivated but self-manifest. The phrase *thabs dang shes rab* (means and wisdom) simultaneous indicates non-dual method-view, not sequential cultivation.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]
<The unsurpassed secret (*gsang ba bla na med pa*) essence: not depending on words (*tshig la ma brten pa*) therefore wisdom (*shes rab*) completely self-sufficient. Nature directly seen (*mngon sum du mthong ba*) therefore not abiding in investigative grasping view (*yid dpyod 'dzin pa'i lta ba*). Four appearances reaching measure (*snang ba bzhi tshad du phebs pa*)—this is the four visions (*snang ba bzhi*) of Dzogchen path, culminating in *'bras bu* (result) not dependent on three kāyas/five wisdoms because intrinsic perfection precedes result-structuring.>

[TEXTUAL CORPUS SUMMARY]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL FRAMEWORK]
<The summary citation from *Thal 'gyur* (Consequence/Prasanga) presents Dzogchen textual statistics: nine spaces (*klong dgu*), 21,000 sections (*bam po*), three categories (*sde gsum*), 35,000 chapters (*le'u*), etc. These numbers encode completeness, not literal bibliographic data. The reconvergence into three series (*sems sde*, *klong sde*, *man ngag gi sde*) demonstrates Longchenpa's hermeneutical framework: all Dzogchen teachings organize by pedagogical approach—mind (*sems*), space (*klong*), or instruction (*man ngag*) as entry points. The phrase *rdzogs pa chen po de dag* (those great perfections) indicates all enumerations point to single *chos nyid*, not competing systems.>

[TEXTUAL TAXONOMY]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION]
<The progressive reconvergence (*bsdus*) statistics map the nine spaces onto the three series: *sems sde* into 5,000 named tantras; *klong sde* into 3,000 named tantras; *man ngag gi sde* into 12,000 named tantras. These enumerations encode pedagogical completeness, not literal bibliographic counts. The divisions—outer/inner/secret spaces, meditation with/without, fabricated liberation/settled liberation/precise liberation—demonstrate hermeneutical flexibility: same teachings viewed through different recognition modalities.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTION SERIES ORGANIZATION]
<The *man ngag gi sde* (instruction series) reconvergence into three spaces: play unceasing (*rol pa 'gag pa med pa*), mind not unliberated (*blo la ma grol ba med pa*), essence without good/bad (*ngo bo la bzang ngan med pa*). These characterize *man ngag* approach: pointing directly to spontaneous presence without structured meditation. The statistics (21,000 chapters, etc.) culminate in threefold classification of essential-point gathering/seeing/knowing—progressive recognition deepening.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[TEXTUAL COMPLETION]
<The final reconvergence statistics complete the corpus organization: obstacles (*gags*) 1,500, essential points (*gnad*) 87 (*gzer bu*), threefold spheres (*'phyong*) of essential-point gathering/seeing/knowing. The classification into teaching (*bka'*) and treatise (*bstan bcos*), then treatise into tantra/scripture/instruction, demonstrates Nyingma textual hierarchy. The fourfold *la bzla ba* (recitation/penetration) categories—meaning instruction, abiding-mode nature, philosophical words, samsara/nirvana nondual—provide progressive access points to same recognition.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]
<Chapter transition: "Thus having established the general dharma arrangement, now explaining the unsurpassed vehicle particularly." This marks shift from Dzogchen doxography to tantric framework. The definition of tantra (*rgyud*) as "awareness and that which establishes it definitively, great secret adding/subtracting impossible, direct certainty" introduces tantric terminology. The etymology (*nges tshig*) as "continuous (*rgyud*) because showing family/lineage (*rigs*), producing birth in that family" indicates *rgyud* (tantra) as transformative continuity, not merely textual genre.>
[4172-4183] 
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[MEANING VS. WORD TANTRA]
<The twofold division into meaning tantra (*don gyi rgyud*) and word tantra (*tshig gi rgyud*): meaning tantra as mind-essence naturally clear light free from conceptual affliction stains, universally abiding; word tantra as that indicated by names-words-letters-sections. This parallels *nges don* (definitive meaning) and *drang don* (provisional meaning) distinction applied to tantric corpus. The phrase *sems nyid rang bzhin gyis 'od gsal ba* (mind-essence naturally clear light) bridges tantric and Dzogchen view—clear light (*'od gsal*) as common terminology with different implications.>

[DEVELOPMENT/COMPLETION CRITERIA]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]
<The tenfold criteria (*ldang tshad*) for development stage (*bskyed rim*) prominence—ground/empowerment/samaya, deity/mantra, maṇḍala/offering, samādhi/conduct, activity/view—establish tantric classification system. The eightfold criteria for completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) prominence—view/result, conduct/meditation, mind/wisdom, experience/instruction. These are taxonomical tools for textual categorization, not practice prescriptions. The *zung 'jug gnyis su med pa* (union nonduality) requiring both sets (18 total) indicates analytic framework for classifying tantras by emphasis, not ontological claims about practice requirements.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[MEANING TANTRA CLASSIFICATION]
[RISK: REIFICATION]
<The twofold division of meaning tantra (*don gyi rgyud*) into method (*thabs*) tantra and nature (*rang bzhin*) tantra establishes tantric hermeneutics. Method tantra's essence: awareness (*rig pa*) and that meaning's practice instructions. The citation from *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland) demonstrates tantric view: emptiness (*stong pa*) and clarity (*gsal ba*) as twofold pervasion (*khyab pa*)—emptiness pervading because causeless entityless, clarity pervading because unceasing self-radiance. This is *rgyud* as continuity of realization, not merely textual transmission.>

[CLEAR LIGHT AS GROUND]
<The definition of indicated method tantra (*mtshon bya thabs kyi rgyud*): awareness-emptiness great wisdom pervading all beings—*byang chub kyi sems* (bodhicitta) as *rig pa*'s universal presence. The phrase *rig pa gsal stong ye shes chen pos* (awareness clarity-emptiness great wisdom) bridges tantric and Dzogchen: in tantra, clear light (*'od gsal*) is result of practice; in Dzogchen, it is primordial ground (*gzhi*). The five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) and five elements (*'byung ba lnga*) as spontaneously accomplished (*lhun gyis grub pa*) indicates *lhun grub* framing within tantric context.>

[INDICATING TANTRA AS METHOD]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
<Indicating method tantra (*mtshon byed thabs kyi rgyud*): instruction pointing out meaning-to-be-indicated for realizing awareness. The definition emphasizes *nyams len gyi gnad dril nas* (condensing practice essential points)—this is skillful means (*thabs*), not the pointed-to itself. The distinction between explanation tantras (*bshad rgyud*) as difficult wordy and instruction tantras (*man ngag gi rgyud*) as clear and easy indicates pedagogical stratification. Dzogchen tantras classified as *man ngag gi rgyud* because direct pointing (*ngo sprod*) rather than philosophical elaboration.>

[GRADUAL VS. INSTANTANEOUS PATHS]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]
<The twofold division into effort-free primordial liberation (*'bad med ye grol*) and effortful gradual (*'bad bcas rim pas*): first is *gzhi khregs chod* (cutting through ground) for simultaneous (*cig car*) capacities; second is *lam thod rgal* (direct transcendence leap) for gradual (*rim gyis*) capacities using channels/winds essential points (*rtsa rlung gi gnad*). This is Dzogchen's *sde gsum* (three series) taxonomy: *sems sde* (cutting through), *klong sde* (direct transcendence), *man ngag gi sde* (instruction). The three essential points—body, gate, object—are *lam* (path) frameworks, not ontological requirements. Four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) reaching measure indicates tantric completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) framework applied to Dzogchen.>
[4319-4327] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[POINTING-OUT INSTRUCTIONS]
<The concluding verses on indicating tantra: "Body and speech relaxed, separated from suffering; awareness relaxed, five bodies arise." This is *man ngag* (instruction) poetry—not descriptive metaphysics but pointing-out (*ngo sprod*). The five bodies (*sku lnga*) arising from awareness relaxed indicates spontaneous display, not fabricated achievement. The phrase *rang gi rgyud la ma bskyed rdzogs* (in one's own tantra without development-completion) indicates recognition transcends staged practice.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[NATURE TANTRA AS CONTINUITY]
<Nature tantra (*rang bzhin gyi rgyud*): ground-path-result meaning (*gzh lam 'bras bu'i don*). The etymology as "continuous (*rgyud*) because determined as pervading all and nature producing buddhahood" indicates tantric view of *rgyud* as transformative continuity. The threefold division—ground, essence, potency nature tantras—maps Dzogchen structure onto tantric terminology: ground nature tantra as primordial pure (*ka dag*) awareness essence-nature-compassion (*ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje*), essence nature tantra as wisdom-threefold-essence, potency nature tantra as ripened result of practice. This is hermeneutical translation between systems, not ontological hierarchy.>

[ESSENCE NATURE AS DISPLAY]
<Essence nature tantra (*snying po rang bzhin gyi rgyud*): wisdom-threefold-essence arising from heart in essence-mode. The four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) arising from ground-nature-tantra's power-basis appearance-eye indicates *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) framework—spontaneous luminosity, not fabricated visualization. The path-four-appearances (*lam snang ba bzhi*) actually seen (*dngos su mthong*) indicates *thod rgal*'s visionary progression as direct perception, not meditation-generated experiences.>

[RISK: REIFICATION]
<The three clarities (*gsal ba gsum*), three confidences (*gdeng gsum*), three irreversibilities (*mi ldog pa gsum*), three appearances (*snang ba gsum*), three emptinesses (*stong pa gsum*)—these taxonomies describe recognition's qualities, not progressive attainments. The phrase *sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa'i dgongs pa* (intent of body and wisdom without meeting/parting) indicates *sku gsum* and *ye shes lnga* as non-dual display. The threefold clarification (*gsal ba gsum*)—external objects, awareness-body, space-awareness—demonstrates *thod rgal* visionary recognition of display as display.>

[GROUND TANTRA AS SUCHNESS]
<The three emptinesses—delusion empty because awareness inexpressible, mind empty because conditionless, light empty because no coming/going—indicate *stong pa* as recognition's nature, not nihilistic void. Ground tantra (*gzhir rgyud*) etymology: all buddhas/beings born from it therefore outermost (*phyi mo*) tantra, or recognized as buddha-tantra, unrecognized as being-tantra. This is hermeneutical, not ontological: same *rig pa* recognized or not.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[METHOD TANTRA AS SKILLFUL MEANS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
<Method tantra (*thabs kyi rgyud*) as part of ground tantra: the meaning itself as indicated-ground. The phrase *gzhir rig pa la ma brten pa'i sangs rgyas sems can gang yang med* (no buddhas/beings not relying on ground-awareness) establishes *rig pa* as universal ground. The need for guru's instruction (*bla ma'i man ngag*) to indicate demonstrates tantric framework: even universal ground requires pointing-out. Liberation upon realization (*rtogs nas grol ba*) as result (*'bras bu*) indicates tantric causal logic, not Dzogchen's primordial liberation.>

[ESSENCE/FLOWER/POTENCY TANTRAS]
[PEDAGOGICAL DISTINCTION]
<Essence tantra (*snying po'i rgyud*) as *rig pa*; flower tantra (*me tog gi rgyud*) as four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) seen/recognized; potency tantra (*bcud kyi rgyud*) as practice-ripened result. These are pedagogical entry points, not separate ontological categories. The phrase *lam du 'phang byed* (shooting/throwing as path) indicates tantric gradualism; citations from various tantras establish textual authority for this framework. *Dbyings rig 'du 'bral med pa'i bcud* (potency of space-awareness without meeting/parting) bridges to Dzogchen view.>
