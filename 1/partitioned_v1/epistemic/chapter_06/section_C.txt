[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EIGHT QUALITY PROOFS]
[EXISTENCE OF SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
<Continuation of eight quality proofs establishing spontaneous presence. Lines 11682-11710: Citation from *gSang ba snying po* (Secret Essence): "Tame and tame-maker as relate is, Secret-Essence from, Great-compassion-by-means-of relate-by-means-of, Six-realms time abide not-remain appear, Thus"—tame and tame-maker relate; from Secret Essence; by means of great compassion relating; six realms appear not abiding remaining in time. Quality proofs establishing spontaneous presence:
1. Elements five individually clear (*'byung ba lnga so so gsal*)—if non-existent, purpose non-existent
2. Awareness inside not cut off—if elements non-existent
3. Container-contents appearance non-arising—if elements non-existent
4. Light-like appearance existing—that quality
5. Two non-existent, three doors cannot relate to one
6. Beings' body/speech/mind three; Buddha's three bodies: gathering-separating non-existent quality
7. Body-like appearance non-existent: body appearance purpose non-existent; beings' body and conqueror's body existing—that quality
8. Primordial wisdom-like appearance non-existent: defect of samsara transcendence path primordial wisdom appearance non-existent existing
These are *sgrub byed* (proofs) establishing *lhun grub* through absurd consequences of its non-existence. Lines 11697-11710: "Extreme liberate like appear exist-by-means-of Buddha from back not-return arise, That non-existent if non-arise-for also that-of quality, Impure door like appear primordial-arise spontaneous in non-existent if, Beings samsara-in appear awareness-face this-to come purpose non-existent if, That exist-by-means-of six-realms individually-of appear-as arise also that-of quality, Power completely great from, Samsara bad-realms play-in primordial-arise, Thus, Pure primordial-wisdom-of door non-existent if nirvana-of appear come purpose non-existent in, That exist-by-means-of awareness-face-in Buddha-of appear exist that exist-of quality, That also spontaneous in pure impure appear suitable see-of door exist window like exist although, Base in pure impure exist is not, Thus spontaneous-of appear-method eight in quality-of aspect eight count is suitable is, Gem-Treasury from"—Buddha arising not returning back by means of extreme liberate appearance existing; if that non-existent, also that quality of non-arising; if primordial-arise spontaneous in impure door appearance non-existent; if purpose non-existent of coming to awareness-face in beings' samsara appearance; that exist by means of six realms individually appearing as arising—that quality; from completely great power; primordial-arise in samsara bad-realms play; thus; if pure primordial wisdom door non-existent, in non-existent purpose of nirvana appearance coming; that exist by means of awareness-face Buddha appearance existing—that exist quality; although window-like exist, door suitable for seeing pure impure in spontaneous; pure impure not existing in base; thus in eight spontaneous appear-methods, suitable to count eight quality aspects; from Gem Treasury. **Key insight**: spontaneous presence is proven by necessity—without it, nothing could appear or function. Yet base itself neither pure nor impure.>

1. Cutting six family escape caves
2. Cutting samsara swing-ropes
3. Compassion lasso grasping
4. Four birth forms
5. Great compassion self-appearance
6. Samsara-nirvana quality mixing
7. Cutting non-existent troop
8. Quality arising only method
