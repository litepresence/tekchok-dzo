Five elements form the container world—the environment for sentient beings. These are not material but *'od lnga*—five lights as wisdom display. "Not perceiving" (*ma mthong*)—failure to recognize elements as wisdom display leads to fixation.

Quality proofs establishing spontaneous presence:
1. Elements five individually clear (*'byung ba lnga so so gsal*)—if non-existent, purpose non-existent
2. Awareness inside not cut off—if elements non-existent
3. Container-contents appearance non-arising—if elements non-existent
4. Light-like appearance existing—that quality
5. Two non-existent, three doors cannot relate to one
6. Beings' body/speech/mind three; Buddha's three bodies: gathering-separating non-existent quality
7. Body-like appearance non-existent: body appearance purpose non-existent; beings' body and conqueror's body existing—that quality
