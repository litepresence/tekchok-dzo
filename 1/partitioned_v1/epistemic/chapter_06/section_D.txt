[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]
<The passage establishes *lhun grub* (spontaneous completion) as the nature of phenomena. This is not something manufactured through practice but recognized as always-already perfect. The epistemic danger is substantializing this as a 'thing'—it is rather the unfindability of any inherent nature. The text points to self-liberation (*rang grol*) where confusion and liberation are not two.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL PERCEPTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
<Appearance and emptiness (*snang stong*) are presented as inseparable. The practitioner is cautioned against alternating between these as separate views. The definitive meaning (*nges don*) is their union (*zung 'jug*)—appearing yet empty, empty yet appearing. This is not philosophical synthesis but direct perception beyond concept.>

Four conditions (*rkyen bzhi*):
1. Light house dwelling (basis as condition)
2. Actual ignorance
3. Master condition (investigating)
4. Object condition (grasping subject)
Mirror example: face shown on mirror. Immediate condition: equal three times. Not knowing self-face establishes samsara.>
