[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GANDAVYŪHA CITATION]
[BODHISATTVA EMANATION]
<Citations from *yab sras mjal ba* (Gandavyūha Sutra) and *phal po che* (Avatamsaka) establish bodhisattva capability: "great hero skillful means" (*dpa' bo chen po thabs mkhas*) manifesting as "ten million Buddhas" (*bye ba phrag brgyar rgyal ba*) to ripen sentient beings (*sems can yongs su smin pa*). Even after obtaining supreme enlightenment (*byang chub rgya mtsho rab brnyes*), they continue generating bodhicitta (*byang chub sems bskyed*) and showing "ocean of non-diminishing conduct" (*mi 'grib spyod pa rgya mtsho*). This describes *thugs rje* (compassion) as inexhaustible display, not attainment-status.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PRIMORDIAL BODHICITTA]
[ATEMPORAL RESOLUTION]
<The "first protector" (*thog ma'i mgon po*) contemplating taming this field (*zhing 'di gdul bar dgongs nas*) manifests emanations demonstrating bodhicitta-generation—referenced to Fortunate Eon (*bskal pa bzang po*) regarding (*ltos nas*) immeasurable eons before (*bskal pa dpag tu med pa'i sngon rol*). The offering of golden vajra (*gser gyi rdo rje*) to Buddha Flower-Beautiful Great (*me tog mdzes pa chen po*) and "first mind generating supreme enlightenment" (*thugs dang po byang chub mchog tu sems bskyed*) describes timeless recognition-event, not historical occurrence.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-ARISEN MANIFESTATION]
[NON-DEPENDENT DISPLAY]
<"From that state... self-arising enjoyment-body ornament and color wheel" (*de'i ngang las... longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku rgyan dang kha dog gi 'khor lo rang byon*) and "thirty-six tantras self-arisen" (*mdzad pa sum cu rtsa drug gi rgyud rang byung*) from light-ray gathering and spreading (*'od zer 'phro 'du*) describe *lhun grub* (spontaneous accomplishment). This is not creation but natural display (*rang snang*) of awareness-nature. The enumeration (36) is symbolic completeness, not catalog.>
[219-228] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BINDU MANIFESTATION]
[PRIMORDIAL POINT DISPLAY]
<From "abiding bindu of light" (*gnas pa 'od kyi thig le*), sixty perfect abidings (*phun sum tshogs pa drug cur gnas*) emerge—hundreds of thousands of Buddha-bodies (*sangs rgyas kyi sku 'bum phrag*) self-appearing (*rang snang*). Five-family Buddhas (*rigs lnga'i sangs rgyas*) radiating immeasurable light-rays (*'od zer dpag tu med pa*) from tongue-faculty (*ljags kyi dbang po*) proclaimed as self-arisen six syllables' sound (*rang byung gi yi ge drug gi sgra*)—compassion (*thugs rje*) radiating without activity (*mdzad pa med pa*). This describes *thig le* as point-instant of recognition, not physical particle.>

[222-228] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE FAMILY MAṆḌALA]
[WISDOM BUDDHA DISPLAY]
<Vairocana (*rnam par snang mdzad chen po*) with countless principal and retinue (*gtsu 'khor dang bcas pa*) gathered into Samantabhadra's enjoyment (*kun tu bzang po'i longs spyod*), blazing as Great Perfection body (*rdzogs pa chen po'i skur 'od 'bar*)—likewise Akṣobhya, Ratnasaṃbhava, Amitābha, Amoghasiddhi with individual maṇḍalas. Each "gathering into own enjoyment, blazing as Great Perfection body" indicates *ye shes lnga* (five wisdoms) as display-modes of single recognition.>

[229-237] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VAIRĀCANA EMERGENCE]
[TEACHER AS AWARENESS-KING]
<At that time in Light-House completely-pure palace (*'od kyi khang bu... gnas khang*), teacher Vairocana "Self-Knowing Awareness King" (*rang shes rig gi rgyal po*) becomes "lord of all maṇḍalas" (*dkyil 'khor thams cad kyi mangs bdag*)—teaching "unmoving, non-arising, non-abiding, non-taking, non-rejecting, non-moving" (*mi g.yo, mi 'byung, mi gnas, mi len, mi 'dor, mi g.yo*) as self-arisen (*rang byung*). The six negations describe *chos sku* (Dharmakāya) as transcendence of all categories—*mi g.yo* repeated for emphasis on ground-stability.>

[238-248] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TAMER OF UNTAMABLE]
[NON-DUAL COMPASSION]
<"Tamer of those not to be tamed" (*gdul bya ma yin 'dul byed*) and precious beautiful retinue (*rin po che mdzes pa'i 'khor*) emanating from and dissolving into body, speech, mind, qualities, activities (*sku gsung thugs yon tan 'phrin las*)—radiating and gathering (*'phro zhing 'dus*). "All appearances, upper and lower, ten directions' worlds, not being... self-arisen Buddha-field clearly became"—this is *chos dbyings* as pure appearance (*rnam dag snang ba*), Vajradhara qualities-complete body (*rdo rje 'chang yon tan rdzogs pa'i sku*).>
[249-252] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAṂBHOGAKĀYA BASIS]
[MERIT AS PURIFICATION]
<From "offering vajra as basis for generating bodhicitta" (*sems bskyed pa'i rten du rdo rje phul ba*), Saṃbhogakāya arises—merit purified (*bsod nams rnam par dag pas*) so body appears without nature (*sku snang la rang bzhin med pa*), accumulation purified (*bsags pa rnam par dag pas*), great mind wisdom (*thugs kyi shes rab chen po*) knowing all aspects (*rnam pa thams cad mkhyen pa*). This describes *rnam par dag pa* (complete purification) as recognition, not moral merit. The "offering" is recognition-act, not transactional exchange.>

[253-268] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THIRTY-SIX ACTIVITIES]
[CLASSIFICATION OF DISPLAY]
<Dharmakāya time (*chos sku'i dus*) with pure object-thought Dharmadhātu (*chos nyid 'od gsal gyi gzhi*), Samantabhadra completing all natural activities (*rang bzhin gyi mdzad pa ma lus pa rdzogs par mdzad*)—countless Buddhas on single atom's peak with teaching actual nature Dzogchen (*ston pa dngos rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po*), uncompounded (*'dus ma byas pa*) and pure view of Dharmatā (*chos nyid la mthong ba rnam par dag pa*) dwelling in five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*). The thirty-six activities classified into outer/inner/secret sets of four for body/speech/mind describe enlightened activity (*'phrin las*) as display-structure, not behavioral checklist.>
---
[269-298] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTES]
[DESCRIPTIVE RATHER THAN PRESCRIPTIVE]
<Technical terms describing activities: *lhang nge ba* (clear-open), *lhan ne ba* (even/smooth), *lhag ge ba* (loose/free), *thal le ba* (direct/piercing-through); for speech: *brjod du med pa* (inexpressible), *bstan du med pa* (unable to be shown), *bltar med pa* (unseeable), *cung zad med pa* (without slight/trace); for mind: stainless samādhi (*dri ma med pa'i ting nge 'dzin*), lion-display samādhi (*seng ge rnam par bsgyings pa*), hero-going samādhi (*dpa' bar 'gro ba*), wish-fulfilling jewel pinnacle (*yid bzhin gyi nor bu'i tog*)—these are recognition-descriptors, not meditative states to achieve.>
[299-304] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMĀDHI ACTIVITIES]
[NON-DOING AS DOING]
<Additional samādhi names: mudra-overwhelming (*phyag rgya zil gyis gnon pa*), great-blaze equality (*'bar chen mnyam pa*), dharmatā all-encompassing (*chos nyid sna tshogs pa*), naturally-arising adornment play (*rnam par bkod pa rang snang rol pa*)—"these are not activity of agent-object" (*don byed byed kyi mdzad pa ma yin gyi*) but called activity because arising as essence of qualities and skillfulness (*yon tan gyi ngo bo dang rtsal du shar ba'i phyir*). This is crucial: enlightened activity is not deliberate action but natural display of recognition.>
---
[305-316] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAṂBHOGAKĀYA PURE LAND]
[SPONTANEOUS ARCHITECTURE]
<Saṃbhogakāya self-arisen (*rang byon*) from former appearance and compassion's uninterrupted skill (*sngar gyi snang ba dang thugs rje'i 'char tshul ma 'gags pa'i rtsal*)—in pure densely-arranged places (*gnas rnam dag stug po bkod par*), teacher Vairocana Great Ocean's equal-samādhi gesture (*mnyam gzhag gi phyag mthil*) produces lotus stems (*padma'i sdong po*) with twenty-five stacked fields (*zhing khams nyi shu rtsa lnga re brtsegs mar*) like water-moon colors and forms (*chu zla 'dra ba*), each level infinite and vast (*yas man du rgya theb*), mutual offering-feast arrangements (*phan tshun za 'og gi gur khyim*), countless five-family Buddha forms. This is *longs sku* as recognition-display, not external paradise.>

[317-322] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-ARISEN TEACHING]
[DHARMATĀ AS SOURCE]
<In Saṃbhogakāya field, "actual teaching, self-arisen letters, no author" (*bstan pa dngos gsung rang byung gi yi ge sus kyang byas pa med pa*)—all teachings' sons appearing together (*bstan pa thams cad kyi bu dang lhan cig snang ba*). "Unchanging time of Dharmatā" (*chos nyid la 'gyur ba med pa'i dus*) indicates *chos nyid* as atemporal ground. Thirty-six activities self-radiating (*rang shar ba*) from inexhaustible ornament wheel of body, speech, mind (*sku gsung thugs mi zad pa rgyan gyi 'khor lo*)—body's outer four activities purifying obscurations with natureless appearance (*sku snang la rang bzhin med pas sgrib dang bcas dag par mdzad*).>
[323-335] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BODY ACTIVITIES COMPLETE]
[QUALITY MANIFESTATION]
<Perfecting body with wisdom face-hand (*ye shes kyi zhal phyag rdzogs pas sku*), perfecting body-nature with light face-hand (*'od kyi zhal phyag gsal bas rang snang grol bar mdzad*), perfecting knowledge with discerning face-hand (*shes rab kyi zhal phyag gsal bas mkhyen pa rdzogs par mdzad*)—inner four: thirty-two marks (*mtshan sum cu rtsa gnyis*) perfecting body's qualities, eighty characteristics (*dpe byad brgyad cu*) perfecting Dharmatā, light-ray mass emanating (*'od zer gyi tshogs 'phro ba*) perfecting special qualities, face pervasively residing (*zhal kun du thal ler bzhugs pa*) perfecting enjoyment-characteristic. Secret four: front-back without residing (*mdun dang rgyab med par bzhugs*) perfecting appearance-aspect, inside clear outside empty (*nang nas bltas na phyi gsal*), outside clear inside (*phyi nas bltas na nang gsal*) perfecting non-dual quality, tip pervading all directions (*rtse mo phyogs kun tu zang thal*) perfecting non-dwelling without cessation.>

[TWELVE DIVISIONS MANIFEST]
<Outer four speech activities: inexpressible (*brjod du med pa*), unable to be shown (*bstan du med pa*), unseeable (*bltar med pa*), without trace (*cung zad med pa*)—inner four: self-nature (*rang bzhin*), transcending (*gyin 'da'*), non-subject (*yul can ma yin*), non-multiple (*du ma med*)—secret four: fresh (*so ma*), innate (*gnyug ma*), natural (*rnal ma*), unaltered (*ma bcos*). This describes *gsung* (speech) as *sgra* (sound) nature—beyond expression yet expressing all.>
---
[350] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FACE PRACTICE COMPLETION]
[ALL-KNOWING ENJOYMENT]
<Face practice pure (*zhal gyi sbyor ba dag pas*) engaging all-knowing Dharma (*thams cad mkhyen pa'i chos la longs spyod par mdzad*)—completing the fivefold structure of body, speech, mind, qualities, activities. This "perfection" (*rdzogs pa*) indicates recognition-completeness, not achievement of separate faculty.>
[351-365] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MIND ACTIVITIES]
[WISDOM SAMĀDHIS]
<Mind's outer four activities through samādhis: non-appearing non-doing (*mngon par 'du mi byed pa*) knowing action and conceptual activity, pure wisdom view (*ye shes kyi mthong ba dag pa*) perfecting equipoise knowledge, pure Dharmatā (*chos nyid rnam par dag pa*) knowing general and specific characteristics, exhausted defilements (*zag pa zad pa*) perfecting pure play. Inner four through wisdoms: mirror-like (*me long lta bu*) enjoying examples, equality (*mnyam pa nyid*) enjoying meaning, discriminating (*so sor rtog pa*) enjoying sense-faculties, action-accomplished (*bya ba grub pa*) enjoying separation from Dharma. Secret four: clarity-emptiness non-dual (*gsal stong dbyer med*) making samsara-nirvana non-dual clear, appearance-emptiness non-dual (*snang stong dbyer med*) making object-wisdom non-dual, awareness-emptiness non-dual (*rig stong dbyer med*) making apprehender-apprehended non-dual, object-mind non-dual (*yul sems dbyer med*) cutting conceptual limits of apprehender-apprehended. These describe *ye shes* (wisdom) as recognition, not cognitive faculty.>

[366-372] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NIRMĀṆAKĀYA EMANATION]
[WHEEL-TURNING DISPLAY]
<Third: Nirmāṇakāya emanation turning wheel (*sprul pa'i sku spras pas 'khor lo bskor ba*)—from Saṃbhogakāya appearance (*longs sku'i snang cha*) as emanation-body appearing in twelve abodes (*gnas ris bcu gnyis*), twelve teachers (*sa ston pa bcu gnyis*) clearly emanated with five perfections' nature (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga lnga'i rang bzhin*). Three great emanations (*sprul pa chen po gsum*) appearing to benefit beings in Jambudvīpa—Dharmakāya teaching actual Great Perfection blessing self-arisen (*chos sku'i bstan pa dngos rdzogs pa chen po'i byin rlabs las rang shar*), enjoyment-body teaching actual self-arisen single-son blessing self-arisen. This is *thabs* diversity, not historical multiplicity.>
[373-376] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE EMANATIONS SELF-ARISEN]
[NON-MANUFACTURED MANIFESTATION]
<Twelve emanation-bodies' blessing self-arisen (*sprul sku bcu gnyis po'i byin rlabs las rang shar*)—body-form equal to beings' bodies (*sku gzugs 'gro ba'i lus bongs dang mnyam pa*), body-speech-mind emanations (*sku gsung thugs kyi sprul pa*) not made by anyone (*sus kyang ma byas pa*), fearless (*mi 'jigs pa*) through self-arisen blessing (*byin rlabs las rang shar*), immeasurable miracles and qualities (*rdzu 'phrul dang yon tan dpag tu med pa*), possessing activity liberating upon contact (*gang dang phrad pa 'byung ba rang dengs su grol bar byed pa'i 'phrin las*). This emphasizes *rang byung* (self-arisen) as intrinsic nature, not produced by causes.>
---
[377-382] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE SUPPORTS]
[LIBERATION GATEWAYS]
<Three supports (*rten gsum*) for liberation: mind-support vajra (*thugs kyi rten rdo rje*)—from disease-free (*nad med pa*) to fulfilling desires and applying liberation (*'dod pa bskang zhing thar pa la sbyor ba*); speech-support self-arisen letter (*gsung gi rten rang byung gi yi ge*)—liberation through mere meeting and hearing sound (*phrad pa dang sgra thos pa tsam gyis grol ba*); body-support (*sku*)—liberating body into clear light upon contact (*gang dang phrad pa'i lus 'od gsal du grol ba*). These "supports" are recognition-conditions, not magical objects.>
---
[383-392] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TEACHING CHRONOLOGY]
[PEDAGOGICAL TIME]
<Body-speech-mind teachings abide in different places by time—body-taming teaching (*sku'i 'dul ba'i bstan pa*) from Amitāyus to thousand Buddhas: 3 × 5,500 years = 16,500 years; speech-taming until 70-year lifespan: 5,500 years; mind-taming until 10-year lifespan: 5,500 years. Clarification (*dus ma yin gyi*): "not time but years for taming explained by those teachings"—pedagogical categories, not historical periods. The declining lifespan reflects *saddharma-vipralopa* (Dharma-decline) cosmology, not literal chronology.>
---
[393-397] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TREASURE LOCATIONS]
[SACRED GEOGRAPHY]
<Body teaching time: vajra in Uḍḍiyāna land (*u rgyan gyi yul*) at salty-taste ocean island (*rgya mtsho lan tshwa'i ro dang ldan pa'i gling*), occasionally emanating light, sound, monk with miracles; letter in sky 500 leagues (*dpag tshad lnga brgya*) above Vajra-seat held by ḍākinīs; body abiding together (*lhan cig bzhugs*). These are *terma* (*gter ma*) locations—earthly (Uḍḍiyāna), aerial (sky), bridging both. Not static objects but dynamic manifestations when conditions ripen.>
[398-405] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPEECH TEACHING SUPPORTS]
[PROTECTIVE MANIFESTATION]
<Speech teaching period: vajra at Mount Malaya (*ri ma la ya*) at hand-vajra abode (*phyag rdo rje'i gnas*) where yakṣa kings render homage; letter in sky above Vajra-seat held by ḍākinīs; body not fixed to one place, circumambulating Jambudvīpa, creating special offering-fields for gods and humans. When teaching harm arises (*bsTan pa la gnod pa byung*), protection manifests: light from body, HŪṂ from face, fire from eyes—threefold protective mechanism of light (wisdom), sound (mantra), fire (transformation). This describes *chos skyong* (Dharma protector) as recognition-response, not external deity.>
---
[406-409] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MIND TEACHING SUPPORTS]
[SAMĀDHI LOCATIONS]
<Mind teaching period: vajra abides in Vajra-seat's sky; letter in extremely wrathful sage's cave (*rab tu khros pa drang srong gi phug*)—Vajrapāṇi's wrathful manifestation; body in thirty-three gods' measureless palace (*sum cu rtsa gsum gyi lha rnams kyi gzhal med khang*), upper story of hand-vajra house. Such three emanations make Jambudvīpa surpass others—preeminence due to presence of these supports, not geographical superiority.>
---
[410-413] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TWELVE EMANATIONS FRAMEWORK]
[SOTERIOLOGICAL FUNCTION]
<Twelve emanation-bodies (*sprul sku bcu gnyis*) in twelve abode-types (*gnas ris bcu gnyis*) to purify beings' five aggregates (*phung po lnga dag par bya ba*). Self-nature of five perfections appearing twelve times (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga'i rang bzhin lan bcu gnyis su snang bar mdzad pa*)—systematic multiplication of pedagogical structure. This is *thabs* (skillful means) architecture, not historical biography.>

[414-423] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIRST EMANATION]
[TUṢITA HEAVEN]
<First: Field Tuṣita upper-chamber (*dga' ldan brtsegs pa*), abode at lotus center, teacher Supreme Light Unimaginable (*snang ba dam pa bsam gyis mi khyab pa*), retinue thousand light-appearance Buddhas plus two roots surrounded, teaching root of all teachings Sound Thalgyur (*sgra thal 'gyur gyi rgyud*), taught during Amitāyus's lifespan by compilers Nandīśvara and Sun Greatly-Illuminating. This is *longs sku* dimension—contentment as recognition-state, not location.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SECOND EMANATION]
[SAHĀ WORLD]
<Second: Abode world Sahā (*'jig rten mi mjed*), teacher Light Akṣobhya (*'od mi 'khrugs pa*), born from five-light egg (*'od lnga'i sgo nga*)—connecting to eastern direction Akṣobhya narrative, emphasizing luminous nature of emanation. Each emanation represents different teaching-manifestation based on capacities of beings (*gdul bya'i dbang*).>
[426-435] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATIONS THREE THROUGH SEVEN]
[PROGRESSIVE SKILLFUL MEANS]
<Third: Heat-moisture gathering (*drod gsher 'dus pa*), teacher Fear-Protecting Mind (*'jigs pa skyob pa'i yid*), 600,000 bodhisattvas, teaching Āgitation of Samsara (*'khor ba dong sprugs*), Peacock Jing-bsnol (*rma bya mjing snol*), Four-Elements-Exhausted Tantras, 100,000-year lifespan. Fourth: Attachment-arising womb (*chags 'byung mangal*), teacher Youth Play Virārati (*gzhon nu rol pa rnam par brtse ba*), 1,000 yakṣas and rock spirits, five mind-class root tantras plus six branch tantras, 80,000 years. Fifth: Āmrapālī's garden (*'tsho byed gzhon nu'i ldum ra*), sixth Vajradhara, seven successive Buddhas, six pāramitās, 70,000 years. Sixth: Meru's north charnel-ground Raurava (*dur khrod mi re 'bar*), teacher Youth Hero Power Great, seven Cloud-Strength bodhisattvas, ḍākinīs, gods, nāgas, Rigpa Rangshar Great and direct-luminous tantras, 60,000 years. Seventh: Rākṣasa land Ruru sound cave (*srin po'i yul ru lu'i sgra dang ldan pa'i phug*), teacher Sage Furious King, 100 million rākṣasas, ten coarse-taming tantras—progression toward increasingly worldly/challenging environments.>
---
[436-460] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE PERFECTIONS STRUCTURE]
[SYSTEMATIC MULTIPLICATION]
<Each emanation maintains five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*): teacher (*ston pa*), place (*gnas*), retinue (*'khor*), teaching (*chos*), time (*dus*). The twelve-fold multiplication (*lan bcu gnyis*) of five-fold structure creates pedagogical comprehensiveness. This is *thabs* (skillful means) diversity—not twelve separate Buddhas but display-modes of single recognition adapting to twelve types of trainees. Risk: Literalizing as historical persons.>
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EIGHTH EMANATION]
[GRDHRAKŪṬA VINAYA]
<Eighth: Abode Gṛdhrakūṭa (*bya rgod spungs pa*—Vulture Peak), teacher Supreme Golden Light (*gser 'od dam pa*), countless noble śrāvakas, teaching Vinaya (*'dul ba*)—thousand immeasurable texts, 5,000-year lifespan. This emanation specifically focuses on monastic discipline, demonstrating Dzogchen framework encompasses full Buddhist practice spectrum including mainstream monasticism. The familiar location (where Buddha taught Prajñāpāramitā) grounds symbolic narrative in recognizable geography.>
---
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NINTH EMANATION]
[MONGOLIAN EXPANSION]
<Ninth: Abode Mongolian turquoise-eyebrow land (*sog po g.yu'i smin ma can gyi yul*) beneath bodhi-tree, teacher Love-Play Wisdom (*brtse bas rol pa'i blo gros*), immeasurable bodhisattvas, teaching sūtra-tantra combinations, 1,000-year lifespan. Geographic expansion into Central Asian territories (*sog po* = Mongolian/Sogdian regions) indicates teaching's adaptive capacity across cultures.>
---
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TENTH EMANATION]
[KĀŚYAPA AT GRDHRAKŪṬA]
<Tenth: Gṛdhrakūṭa again, teacher Kāśyapa the Elder (*'od srung bagres po*—chief disciple known for strict asceticism), seven including Āyuṣmat Nakṣatra-prabha, teachings: Sūtras, Kriyā tantras, Anu yoga—1,800 texts, 500-year lifespan. Returning to Gṛdhrakūṭa emphasizes continuity of teaching location across emanations.>
---
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ELEVENTH EMANATION]
[DEFINITIVE MEANING ONLY]
<Eleventh: Abode Vajrāsana (*rdo rje gdan*—diamond throne at Bodh Gayā), teacher Abhisaṃbodhi King (*mngon rdzogs rgyal po*), retinue Three-Family Protectors (*rigs gsum mgon po*: Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī, Vajrapāṇi), teaching: Definitive-meaning vehicle only (*nges pa don gyi theg pa 'ba' zhig*), 300-year lifespan. "Only" (*'ba' zhig*) indicates exclusive focus on ultimate teachings (*nītārtha*) rather than provisional (*neyārtha*).>
---
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TWELFTH EMANATION]
[ŚĀKYAMUNI HISTORICAL]
<Twelfth: Abode Vārāṇasī and other locations, teacher Śākyamuni (*shAkya thub pa*), retinue śrāvakas, bodhisattvas, gods, nāgas, teaching Three Baskets (*sde snod gsum*—Tripiṭaka), 100-year lifespan. Progressive lifespan shortening (immeasurable → 100 years) reflects Buddhist cosmological theory of declining Dharma (*saddharma-vipralopa*)—human lifespan and spiritual capacity decrease over cosmic time. Historical Buddha as final emanation in series.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA RANGSHAR CITATION]
[PRIMORDIAL LOSS NARRATIVE]
<Quotation from *Rig pa rang shar chen po'i rgyud* (Great Self-Arising Awareness Tantra): "At beginningless time, my precious jewel lost, by jewel-lost self-nature, from darkness-appearance interval came, by four conditions concept impure, to Tuṣita upper-chamber land came, support is pure lotus, secret mantra great teaching established, near retinue is Akṣobhya, tantra king Thalgyur taught." This encapsulates Dzogchen soteriology: primordial ignorance (*mun pa*), delusion process (*'khrul pa*), path of return through tantric practice (*gsang sngags*).>
