---
[RISK: MEDITATIVE HIERARCHY CONFUSION]
<The systematic halving of body measures (64→32→16→8→4) and temporal durations presents cosmology as mathematical precision. Risk: Taking these as objective astronomical facts rather than *bsam gtan* (meditative absorption) correlates. The form realms correspond to stages of samādhi:
- First absorption: light-based heavens (Clear Light, Limitless Light, Small Light)
- Second absorption: virtue-based heavens (Cloudless, Increased Virtue, Limited Virtue)
- Third absorption: cloudless clarity
- Fourth absorption: pure abodes
Dzogchen view: All *bsam gtan* realms are still *sgom lam* (path of meditation), not *mi slob lam* (path of no-learning = liberation). Meditative stability suppresses afflictions (*nyon mongs*) but doesn't eliminate their seeds (*bag chags*). Form realm gods (*gzugs khams kyi lha*) have long lives but eventually fall to lower realms when merit exhausted.
Key distinction: *bsam gtan* = temporary suppression; *rig pa* = permanent liberation. The elaborate cosmology motivates practice by showing samsara's heights, but ultimate goal transcends all realms. Risk: Attachment to form realm rebirth as goal; actual goal is recognition beyond form/formlessness.>

[RISK: PERMANENCE DELUSION]
<The Brahma realm's "intermediate eon" (*bar bskal*) lifespan presents unique soteriological danger: beings mistake long duration for permanence (*rtag pa*). Lines 1250 "brahma-like dwell"—dwelling LIKE Brahma, not BECOMING Brahma. This is still *'khor ba* (samsara), not liberation. The Great Brahma believes he is creator (*skyed byed*)—delusion of cosmic self-importance. Desire heavens' progressive degradation (16,000 → 8,000 → 4,000 years) encodes merit exhaustion: higher realms = more merit = longer life, but all finite. The pattern: fall from previous excellence (*sngon gyi yon tan*)—cyclical rise and fall, not linear progress. Dzogchen view: All realms equally *snang ba* (appearance), equally *stong pa* (empty). The elaborate cosmology is *tha snyad* (conventional) upaya to motivate virtue, not *don dam* (ultimate) description of reality.

4. **Cruel-mara demon type** (*rtsub 'gyur bdud kyi rigs*)—equal to Controlling-Magic (*gzhan 'phrul dbang byed*) in enjoyment
This establishes *mtshungs pa* (equal/similar) relationships between asura types and god/ghost classes. Cosmological hierarchy: merit determines rebirth destination, lifespan, body size. Risk: Taking cosmological hierarchy as Dzogchen view—actual Dzogchen view is that all realms are *rig pa'i snang ba* (awareness-display), equally empty. The detailed cosmology serves pedagogical purpose: establishing common ground with Abhidharma before introducing Dzogchen perspective. This is *thun mong gi ngag* (common speech) before *thun mong ma yin pa* (uncommon).>

[RISK: COSMOLOGICAL REIFICATION]
<The extensive measurements (bow-lengths, human-to-divine time ratios) present risk of literal interpretation. These are *thang shig* (pictorial) representations, not astronomical data. The Thirty-three gods' realm is not locatable on GPS; it's *snying po can gyi 'jig rten* (world of those with heart-essence)—those with recognition capacity. The cosmology encodes psychological states: gods = pleasure attachment, asuras = jealousy, desire realm = sense pleasure fixation. Longchenpa presents this conventionally (*tha snyad du*) before revealing definitive meaning. The asura classification by similarity (lines 1287-1292) shows all six realms interpenetrate—no absolute boundaries. This is *'khor ba* (samsara) topology: cyclic existence has structure but no essence. Recognition transcends all realms equally.>

This is *rigs pas skyes pa* (caste-born) origin myth—first humans divine descent, establishing human potential for enlightenment.>

[RISK: CREATIONISM & CASTEISM]
<The "fall from light" narrative presents two risks:
**1. Creationism**: Sun and Moon as first humans can be read as literal cosmic origin story. Actual meaning: *'od gsal* (clear light) = mind's primordial nature; "fall" = condensation into material embodiment. Not historical event but phenomenological description of consciousness individuating.
**2. Casteism**: Divine origin establishing human superiority over animals/pretas can feed hierarchical social structures. Buddhist context: All beings have Buddha-nature; human birth is precious (*dal 'byor*) because of recognition capacity, not inherent superiority.
**Miraculous birth** (*rdzus skyes*): Not virgin birth mythology but asexual reproduction in early cosmic ages—before sexual differentiation emerged (detailed pages 1370+). This encodes psychological development: from unitary awareness (light beings) → dualistic perception (male/female) → sexual reproduction → material embodiment.
Dzogchen view: The "fall" is not biblical expulsion from Eden but *ma rig pa* (non-recognition) of own nature. Sun/Moon are metaphors for *rig pa* (awareness) and *ye shes* (primordial wisdom). Jambudvīpa is not geography but *snying po can gyi 'jig rten*—world with heart-essence, capable of recognition.>
