[DZOGCHEN VIEW – UNITY OF VIEW AND CONDUCT]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: INTEGRATED PRACTICE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]
This section presents the unity of view, meditation, and conduct as the hallmark of Dzogchen practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, these three are not separate activities to be coordinated but inseparable aspects of the natural state.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding unity. Unlike approaches that separate study (view), sitting practice (meditation), and daily activity (conduct), Dzogchen recognizes that all three are the continuous expression of the natural state.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that view is the recognition of the natural state, meditation is the continuous flow of that recognition, and conduct is the natural expression of recognition in activity. These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in this unity is the recognition that while conventionally we distinguish study, practice, and activity, ultimately there is only the natural state expressing itself in all its variety.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: there is no view without meditation, no meditation without conduct, no conduct without view. Each implies and includes the others; separation is conceptual imposition.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to maintain this unity. The view recognized in study continues in meditation; the meditation recognized on the cushion continues in activity; the activity of daily life becomes continuous meditation.
The section discusses the relationship between this unity and conventional discipline. While beginners may need to separate study, meditation, and conduct to develop each, advanced practice dissolves these distinctions. The goal is seamless unity.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for this unity, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While conventional frameworks separate the three, the ultimate reality is their inseparability.
The section thus establishes the unity of view, meditation, and conduct as the natural expression of Dzogchen—three names for the same recognition, three aspects of the same practice, three expressions of the same natural state.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NO GRADATION IN RECOGNITION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: NON-HIERARCHICAL REALIZATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]
This section presents the Dzogchen view that recognition admits of no gradation—there are not degrees of enlightenment, stages of realization, or levels of recognition. From the Dzogchen perspective, recognition is either present or absent; there are no partial recognitions.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding non-gradation. Unlike gradual paths that describe progressive stages of realization, Dzogchen recognizes that the nature of mind is either recognized or not. The recognition itself is complete; what varies is its stability.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that while we may speak of deepening recognition or stabilizing it, the recognition itself is the same—awareness aware of itself. There are not different recognitions but different durations of the same recognition.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in gradation is the recognition that while conventionally we describe paths and stages, ultimately there is only recognition and non-recognition. The stages are descriptions of how recognition manifests, not different recognitions.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: enlightenment is not achieved in stages but recognized all at once. The ten stages (sa bcu) of the Bodhisattva path are conventional descriptions, not actual stages of realization.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to approach this non-gradation. Rather than working toward future realization, recognize fully in this moment. The recognition that occurs now is as complete as any recognition could be.
The section discusses the relationship between this view and conventional gradualism. While gradual paths are valid for those who need them, Dzogchen emphasizes immediate, complete recognition. This is not superiority but difference in approach.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for non-gradation, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings describe stages, the ultimate recognition is immediate and complete.
The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of recognition as admitting no gradation—either awareness recognizes itself or it does not; there are no degrees of enlightenment, only recognition or delusion.
Line range [3240-3263]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COMPLETION IN THE GROUND]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRIMORDIAL PERFECTION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON DEFINITIVE]
This section presents the Dzogchen view that all completion is already present in the ground—nothing needs to be added, nothing can be removed. From the Dzogchen perspective, the ground is spontaneously perfect (lhun grub), complete with all qualities since beginningless time.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in its fullest sense. Unlike paths that speak of developing qualities, accumulating wisdom, or purifying obscurations, Dzogchen recognizes that all qualities are already present. The path reveals rather than creates.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the ground is complete with the qualities of the three kayas, the five wisdoms, and all enlightened attributes. These are not produced through practice but revealed through recognition. The practitioner does not become a Buddha but recognizes Buddha-nature.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in completion is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of developing qualities, ultimately they have always been present. The path is revelation, not creation.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the ground is complete with all excellent qualities (yon tan). Nothing is missing; nothing needs to be added. The fruition is not the acquisition of new qualities but the recognition of what has always been present.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to rest in this completion. Instead of trying to achieve something, rest in the recognition that all is already complete. This resting is itself the manifestation of completion.
The section discusses the relationship between this view and effort. While effort is necessary conventionally to reveal what is hidden, Dzogchen emphasizes that the completion itself requires no effort—it is the natural state. Effort is only needed to maintain recognition.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for completion in the ground, recognizing it as the definitive truth. All teachings about development and achievement are provisional; the ultimate truth is primordial completion.
The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of spontaneous perfection—all qualities complete in the ground, nothing to achieve, nothing to become, only recognition of what has always been perfectly present.
Line range [3264-3287]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – UNCHANGING NATURE]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: IMMUTABLE REALITY]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]
This section presents the unchanging nature ('gyur med) of the natural state as the ground of Dzogchen view. From the Dzogchen perspective, while all conditioned phenomena change, the nature of mind itself is immutable—never deluded, never enlightened, always as it is.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding immutability. Unlike the changing phenomena of samsara, the natural state does not transform, improve, or deteriorate. It is not affected by delusion or enhanced by realization; it simply remains as it is.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that all change occurs within the natural state, not to it. Thoughts arise and dissolve, emotions come and go, experiences shift and change, but awareness itself remains unchanged throughout. This unchanging awareness is the ground of Dzogchen.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in immutability is the recognition that while conventionally we experience change, ultimately there is an unchanging ground that remains unaffected by all change.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the nature of mind is unchanging ('gyur med), unborn (skye med), and unceasing ('gag med). These three characteristics describe the immutable reality that underlies all apparent change.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to recognize this immutability. While phenomena change, notice that the awareness within which they change does not. This unchanging awareness is the nature of mind.
The section discusses the relationship between immutability and practice. Practice does not change or improve the nature of mind; it reveals what has always been present. The changes that occur in practice are in the recognition, not in the nature itself.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for immutability, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings describe transformation and development, the ultimate reality is unchanging.
The section thus establishes the unchanging nature of the natural state—the immutable ground that remains unaffected by all the changes of samsara and nirvana, delusion and enlightenment.
Line range [3288-3311]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FREEDOM FROM ELABORATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: BEYOND CONCEPTUAL PROLIFERATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]
This section presents the freedom from elaboration (spros bral) as the defining characteristic of Dzogchen view. From the Dzogchen perspective, the natural state is free from all conceptual elaborations, philosophical positions, and mental constructions.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding freedom from elaboration. Unlike philosophical systems that establish positions, Dzogchen transcends all positions. It is not emptiness, not clarity, not their union—these are all conceptual elaborations. The natural state is beyond all such descriptions.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that conceptual mind (yid) creates elaborations—existence, non-existence, both, neither, permanence, impermanence, and so on. Rig pa is free from all these. It is not a position to be held but a reality to be recognized.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in elaboration is the recognition that while conventionally we use concepts and language, ultimately the natural state is beyond all concepts. Words are fingers pointing; the natural state is the moon beyond words.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the natural state is free from the four extremes (mu bzhi)—existence, non-existence, both, and neither. It is also free from the eight extremes, the hundred extremes, all conceptual extremes.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to rest in freedom from elaboration. Do not try to think the right thoughts or hold the right views. Simply rest without conceptual activity, allowing awareness to be as it is, free from all mental construction.
The section discusses the relationship between freedom from elaboration and philosophical study. While study uses elaboration, Dzogchen transcends it. Philosophy is a raft to be abandoned; freedom from elaboration is the far shore.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for freedom from elaboration, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings use elaboration, the ultimate reality is free from it.
The section thus establishes the freedom from elaboration as the essential nature of Dzogchen—beyond all philosophical positions, conceptual constructs, and mental fabrications, the natural state simply is as it is.
Line range [3312-3335]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – INEXPRESSIBILITY]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: BEYOND LANGUAGE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]
This section presents the inexpressibility (brjod du med pa) of the natural state as a fundamental feature of Dzogchen. From the Dzogchen perspective, the nature of mind cannot be captured in words, concepts, or descriptions—it must be recognized directly.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding inexpressibility. Unlike teachings that can be fully articulated in language, Dzogchen points to what transcends language. Words can point to the natural state but cannot contain it.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that language operates by distinction—this versus that, existence versus non-existence, subject versus object. The natural state transcends all distinctions; therefore, it cannot be expressed in language. It can only be recognized directly.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in inexpressibility is the recognition that while conventionally we use words to teach and communicate, ultimately the truth is beyond words. All teachings are provisional pointers to what cannot be taught.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the natural state is beyond all expression (brjod du med), beyond all thought (bsam du med), and beyond all description (bshad du med). These three inexpressibilities point to the same reality.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to approach the inexpressible. Do not try to understand the natural state conceptually; simply rest in direct recognition. The inexpressible is not a puzzle to be solved but a reality to be experienced.
The section discusses the relationship between inexpressibility and teaching. If the truth is inexpressible, why teach? The teachings are fingers pointing at the moon, not the moon itself. They create conditions for recognition but are not the recognition.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for inexpressibility, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings can be expressed, the ultimate truth transcends expression.
The section thus establishes the inexpressibility of the natural state—the recognition that the truth of Dzogchen cannot be captured in words but must be recognized directly through direct introduction.
Line range [3336-3359]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND MIND]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: TRANSCENDING CONCEPTUAL MIND]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]
This section presents the Dzogchen view that the natural state is beyond mind (blo 'das)—transcending not only ordinary conceptual mind but even the most refined meditative states. From the Dzogchen perspective, rig pa is not a state of mind but the nature beyond all minds.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding transcendence of mind. Unlike teachings that aim at refined mental states—calm abiding, deep concentration, or even non-conceptual meditation—Dzogchen points to what transcends mind entirely.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that mind (sems) includes all conceptual and even non-conceptual mental activity. Rig pa is not a modification of mind but the awareness within which mind arises and dissolves. It is not a better mind but the nature beyond mind.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in transcendence of mind is the recognition that while conventionally we work with mind—calming it, refining it, transcending its gross aspects—ultimately we must go beyond mind itself to the awareness that is its nature.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the natural state is beyond mind (blo 'das), beyond intellect (blo), and beyond thought (rtog pa). These three transcendences point to rig pa as distinct from all mental activity.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to go beyond mind. Do not try to achieve special mental states; simply recognize the awareness within which all states arise. This recognition is beyond mind.
The section discusses the relationship between meditation and non-meditation. Meditation uses mind; Dzogchen transcends it. The highest meditation is non-meditation—resting in awareness beyond all mental activity.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for transcendence of mind, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings work with mind, the ultimate reality is beyond it.
The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of the natural state as beyond mind—not a state to be achieved but the awareness within which all states arise and dissolve.
Line range [3360-3383]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TOTAL COMPLETION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: ULTIMATE SYNTHESIS]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON DEFINITIVE]
This section presents the total completion (rdzogs pa) of Dzogchen view—the recognition that all aspects of reality are perfectly complete in the natural state. From the Dzogchen perspective, there is nothing missing, nothing to add, nothing to perfect. All is already the spontaneous display of primordial purity.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in its ultimate sense. Total completion means that samsara is complete as the display of awareness, nirvana is complete as the recognition of that display, the path is complete as the self-liberation of delusion, and the result is complete as what has always been present.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes total completion as the natural state itself. The ground is complete with all qualities; the path is complete as recognition; the result is complete as what was never absent. This completion is not achieved but recognized.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in total completion is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of progress and development, ultimately all is complete. The appearance of incompleteness is itself the complete display of primordial purity.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: Great Perfection (rdzogs pa chen po) means total completion—ground, path, and result are all perfectly complete in the natural state. This is the definitive view of Dzogchen.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to rest in total completion. Instead of trying to improve or complete anything, recognize that all is already complete. This recognition is itself the completion.
The section discusses the relationship between total completion and conventional practice. While practice appears to lead to completion, it actually reveals the completion that was always present. Practice is revelation, not creation.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for total completion, recognizing it as the definitive truth. All teachings about incompleteness and the need for practice are provisional; the ultimate truth is total completion.
The section thus concludes the presentation of Dzogchen view with total completion—the recognition that all is perfectly complete in the natural state, nothing is missing, nothing needs to be added, all is spontaneously perfect primordial purity.
Line range [3384-3407]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LINEAGE AND TRANSMISSION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: AUTHENTICITY FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]
This section presents the importance of lineage (brgyud pa) and transmission (lung) in Dzogchen as the means by which the recognition of the natural state is passed from master to disciple. From the Dzogchen perspective, while the nature of mind cannot be transmitted like an object, the conditions for its recognition are passed through authentic lineage.
The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. Provisionally, the lineage is a historical succession of masters who have held and transmitted the teaching. Ultimately, the lineage is the continuity of recognition itself, transcending historical time and individual persons.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the lineage is not merely institutional but the living expression of the teaching. When a master gives direct introduction, the lineage is present. When a disciple recognizes the natural state, the lineage continues. It is the living transmission of recognition.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in lineage is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of historical masters and transmissions, ultimately the lineage is the natural state itself, recognizing itself through apparently separate individuals.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes that authentic Dzogchen requires connection to an authentic lineage. This is not institutional rigidity but recognition that the pointing-out instructions must come from one who has recognized, who received from one who recognized, back to the Buddha Samantabhadra.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to connect with lineage. Through devotion to the master and confidence in the teaching, the disciple opens to the transmission. The lineage is not received from outside but recognized as one's own nature.
The section discusses the relationship between lineage and direct recognition. While the lineage provides the context and method, recognition itself is direct and immediate. The lineage is the doorway; recognition is entering the room.
The epistemic stance maintains that while lineage is [PROVISIONAL MEANING] in its historical form, it conveys [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in the recognition it facilitates. The form is provisional; the recognition is definitive.
The section thus establishes lineage as the living transmission of Dzogchen—the unbroken continuity of recognition from master to disciple that makes the direct introduction possible.
Line range [3408-3431]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMAYA COMMITMENTS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]
This section presents the samaya (dam tshig) commitments of Dzogchen practice—the vows that bind the practitioner to the natural state. From the Dzogchen perspective, samaya is not merely ethical constraint but the continuity of recognition itself.
The epistemic framework here employs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] as the structure for samaya. While the natural state is beyond all vows, conventionally the practitioner takes commitments to maintain recognition and avoid reifying delusion. These are skillful means, not absolute constraints.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the ultimate samaya is recognition itself. To remain in recognition is to keep samaya; to fall into delusion is to break it. The conventional vows—root samayas and branch samayas—are supports for maintaining recognition.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in samaya is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of commitments to keep and violations to avoid, ultimately there is nothing to violate because all is primordially pure.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the root samaya is not to stray from the natural state. The branch samayas support this root—avoiding harm, maintaining practice, respecting the master, and so on. These are expressions of recognition, not external rules.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how samaya functions in practice. When recognition is strong, samaya is naturally maintained; when recognition weakens, conscious commitment to samaya helps restore it. Samaya is both protection and expression of recognition.
The section discusses the restoration of broken samaya. In Dzogchen, since delusion is empty, samaya can always be restored through recognition. There is no stain that cannot be purified; no violation that cannot be mended through returning to the natural state.
The epistemic stance maintains [DRANG DON] for conventional samaya, recognizing it as provisional support for recognition. The ultimate samaya—continuous recognition—is [NGES DON].
The section thus establishes samaya as the continuity of recognition expressed through commitment—the vows that bind the practitioner to the natural state and protect against falling into delusion.
Line range [3432-3455]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – OBSCURATIONS AND PURIFICATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE DYNAMICS]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]
This section presents the Dzogchen understanding of obscurations (sgrib pa) and their purification—distinct from lower vehicles' approach. From the Dzogchen perspective, obscurations are temporary adventitious veils that have no substantial existence and are self-liberated through recognition.
The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding obscurations. Unlike lower vehicles that view obscurations as substantial stains to be gradually removed, Dzogchen recognizes them as empty displays of awareness. They cannot actually obscure the natural state.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes two types of obscurations: emotional obscurations (nyon sgrib) and cognitive obscurations (shes sgrib). Both are temporary and adventitious (glo bur), not inherent to the nature of mind. They dissolve when their nature is recognized.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in obscurations is the recognition that while conventionally we experience obscurations as real and powerful, ultimately they are empty and cannot affect the natural state. Purification is recognition, not removal.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: obscurations are self-liberated (rang grol) when their nature is recognized. They do not need to be removed through antidotes; recognizing their emptiness is sufficient.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how purification occurs in Dzogchen. When an obscuration arises, instead of applying an antidote, recognize its nature as awareness. This recognition is purification—obscuration and wisdom are not two.
The section discusses the relationship between Dzogchen purification and lower vehicle methods. While gradual methods emphasize antidotes and removal, Dzogchen emphasizes recognition and self-liberation. Both are valid; Dzogchen is more direct.
The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for Dzogchen purification, recognizing it as the definitive approach. While provisional methods work with obscurations as real, the ultimate truth is their emptiness and self-liberation.
The section thus establishes Dzogchen's unique approach to obscurations—not removal through effort but self-liberation through recognition of their nature as primordial purity.
Line range [3456-3479]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ACCUMULATIONS AND PURIFICATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE METHODS]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]
This section presents the Dzogchen approach to the two accumulations (tshogs gnyis)—merit (bsod nams) and wisdom (ye shes)—and their relationship to purification. From the Dzogchen perspective, these are conventionally necessary but ultimately transcended in recognition.
The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. Provisionally, merit and wisdom are accumulated through practice to create conditions for recognition. Ultimately, they are spontaneously present in the natural state and merely revealed.
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that in the natural state, there is nothing to accumulate. Merit and wisdom are primordially present as the compassionate energy and empty essence of awareness. Accumulation is the conventional description; recognition is the ultimate reality.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in accumulation is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of gathering merit and wisdom, ultimately they are not things to be gathered but qualities to be recognized as present.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: in Dzogchen, the two accumulations are complete in the ground. The path reveals them; the result manifests them. They are not produced through practice but recognized as spontaneously present.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to understand accumulation in Dzogchen. While engaging in practices that conventionally accumulate merit and wisdom, recognize that these are already complete. This recognition transforms conventional practice into Dzogchen view.
The section discusses the relationship between accumulation and recognition. For those who have not recognized, accumulation creates favorable conditions. For those who have recognized, accumulation is the spontaneous expression of that recognition.
The epistemic stance maintains that while accumulation is [PROVISIONAL MEANING] in its conventional form, the recognition of completion is [NGES DON]. Both aspects are valid; the ultimate transcends yet includes the conventional.
The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of accumulation—conventionally practiced, ultimately complete, the two accumulations are the display of primordial purity recognized through practice.
Line range [3480-3503]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DEDICATION AND PRAYER]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: COMPASSIONATE ACTIVITY]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]
This section presents the Dzogchen approach to dedication (bsngo ba) and prayer (smon lam)—the expressions of compassion that direct the merit of practice toward the welfare of all beings. From the Dzogchen perspective, these are both conventional practices and natural expressions of recognition.
The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. Provisionally, dedication and prayer are deliberate acts of compassion. Ultimately, they are the spontaneous expression of the natural state's compassionate energy (thugs rje).
The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that in the natural state, there is no separation between self and others, no distinction between practitioner and beings to benefit. Dedication is the conventional expression of this non-dual compassion; ultimately, all beings are already in the state of liberation.
The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in dedication is the recognition that while conventionally we pray for beings' welfare and dedicate merit, ultimately there are no beings separate from the natural state, and no merit to dedicate.
The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: dedication in Dzogchen is the recognition that all is primordially pure. We dedicate not to create something new but to recognize what is already present—the spontaneous perfection of all beings.
The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how dedication occurs in Dzogchen. Whether in formal prayer or spontaneous thought, the recognition of the natural state includes all beings. This is dedication without a dedicator, merit without accumulation.
The section discusses the relationship between dedication and recognition. For those practicing conventionally, dedication develops bodhicitta. For those who have recognized, dedication is the natural overflow of compassion. Both are valid; recognition transforms dedication.
The epistemic stance maintains that while dedication is [PROVISIONAL MEANING] in its conventional form, the recognition of all beings as spontaneously perfect is [NGES DON].
The section thus establishes dedication and prayer in Dzogchen—conventionally the expression of compassion, ultimately the spontaneous display of the natural state's compassionate energy for the benefit of all.
