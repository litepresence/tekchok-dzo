[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text continues with negations: primordially pure by primordial non-existence, spontaneously accomplished naturally, unceasing display, Buddha-fields, appearances. A reader might think: "This is showing that everything is primordially pure and spontaneously present - it's all the display of the base, inherently perfect."
WHY IT ARISES:
After extensive negation, we want something positive. "Primordially pure" and "spontaneously accomplished" offer positive content. We interpret this as describing the true, positive nature of reality.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies "primordial purity" and "spontaneous accomplishment" as the positive nature of reality. These become the "real" qualities of the base that survive all negation.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Attributing inherent purity to all phenomena
2. Seeking experiences of "primordial purity"
3. Justifying present conditions as "spontaneously perfect"
4. Missing that purity is recognition, not quality
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ETERNALISTIC ERROR (inherent purity) → REIFICATION ERROR (purity as quality) → PRACTICE ERROR (false completion). The practitioner adopts inherent perfection.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text presents detailed arguments and scriptural citations about the base, its aspects, and its relationship to appearance. A reader might think: "This is rigorous philosophical theology establishing the correct view through reasoning and scriptural authority."
WHY IT ARISES:
We value systematic argumentation supported by authoritative sources. The combination of logic and scripture seems to establish truth definitively. This is how Western academic theology works.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner approaches Dzogchen as philosophical theology - a system to be mastered through study of arguments and scriptures. Intellectual mastery substitutes for recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating Dzogchen as academic subject
2. Mastering arguments without embodying insight
3. Competing in philosophical sophistication
4. Missing that pointing is not proving
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (Dzogchen scholasticism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (knowledge as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (academic transmission). The tradition becomes academic.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes the nature's display as uninterrupted, vast, without increase or decrease, empty or full, with clarity, the place where many kayas arise. A reader might think: "This is describing the actual nature of display - it's a vast, clear, uninterrupted field of wisdom-light where kayas manifest."
WHY IT ARISES:
Vivid imagery creates strong impressions. We naturally visualize a "vast expanse" of clarity and light. This seems like a description of what the base actually looks like or is like.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the display as a luminous field or expanse. This becomes the sought-after vision - the vast clear light from which kayas emerge.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking visions of vast clear light
2. Reifying display as a metaphysical space
3. Creating dualism: display realm vs ordinary world
4. Missing that display is unceasing manifestation, not a place
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (display as realm) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking display visions) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (luminous metaphysics). The practitioner seeks the display realm.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text continues with extensive quotations from tantras, detailed explanations of aspects, modes of arising, and philosophical arguments. A reader might think: "This is the complete Dzogchen philosophical system - all the details, all the sources, all the arguments comprehensively presented."
WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive presentation suggests completeness. We assume that if we study all these details, we'll understand Dzogchen fully. Academic accumulation masquerades as wisdom.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats Dzogchen as a comprehensive philosophical system to be mastered. The goal becomes knowing all the details, sources, and arguments.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Accumulating Dzogchen "knowledge"
2. Comparing different textual presentations
3. Competing in comprehensive understanding
4. Missing that one pointing is enough
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (comprehensive accumulation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (detail as depth) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching comprehensive systems). The tradition becomes encyclopedic.
[lines 11300-11320]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains how compassion arises from the base like clouds from the sky - not truly existent yet appearing. A reader might think: "So compassion is like clouds - they appear but aren't real. This means appearances are illusory but the base (sky) is real."
WHY IT ARISES:
The cloud-sky metaphor is common and evocative. We naturally privilege the sky as "real" and clouds as "mere appearances." This creates a dualistic reading of the metaphor.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as "real" (like sky) and appearances as "unreal" (like clouds). This becomes a dualistic metaphysics with a real substratum and unreal manifestations.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Privileging base over appearances
2. Seeking the "real" base beyond appearances
3. Disdaining appearances as "mere illusions"
4. Missing that both base and appearances are empty
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (base as real) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking the real base) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (dualistic metaphor). The practitioner seeks the sky beyond clouds.

[lines 11321-11340]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes the eight modes of arising of spontaneous accomplishment - desire, enjoyment, form, non-dual view, methods, wisdom gates, compassion. A reader might think: "These are the eight real ways that spontaneous accomplishment manifests. These are the fundamental modes of enlightened expression."
WHY IT ARISES:
Numbered lists create systematic clarity. "Eight modes" sounds comprehensive and authoritative. We imagine understanding the complete structure of manifestation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The eight modes become a taxonomy of enlightened manifestation. The practitioner studies them as categories of reality, seeking to experience or embody each mode.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing the eight modes as doctrine
2. Seeking experiences of each mode
3. Creating hierarchy among the modes
4. Missing that modes are descriptive, not prescriptive
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (eight-fold system) → REIFICATION ERROR (modes as real categories) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking modes). The practitioner counts to eight.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes the wish-fulfilling jewel and how it abides in one's form, the youth vase body appearing outwardly while abiding in spontaneous accomplishment's mode. A reader might think: "This describes actual metaphysical structures - the wish-fulfilling jewel within, the youth vase body as a real inner dimension."
WHY IT ARISES:
Rich symbolic imagery seems to describe metaphysical realities. "Wish-fulfilling jewel," "youth vase body" - these suggest actual entities or realms within the practitioner's being.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies symbolic anatomy as literal metaphysical structure. The "youth vase body" becomes an actual inner body, the "wish-fulfilling jewel" a real inner jewel.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking the youth vase body as inner reality
2. Imagining literal wish-fulfilling jewels inside
3. Creating maps of inner metaphysical anatomy
4. Missing that symbols point to experience, not entities
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (symbolic anatomy as literal) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking inner bodies) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (inner metaphysics). The practitioner explores inner realms.

[lines 11361-11380]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists how from wisdom's unceasing meaning arises the mode of enjoyment, from qualities the mode of spontaneous form, from compassion the mode of impure appearance. A reader might think: "This explains the causal mechanism of manifestation - how different aspects produce different displays. This is the cosmology of manifestation."
WHY IT ARISES:
Causal explanations satisfy our need for understanding how things work. We assume the text is explaining the mechanics of manifestation - the "how" of appearance arising.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the description as causal mechanics. "Compassion gives rise to impure appearance" becomes a cosmological law explaining the origin of samsara.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Understanding the description as causal explanation
2. Studying the mechanics of manifestation
3. Debating the causal relationships
4. Missing that description is not explanation
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (description as causality) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (manifestation mechanics) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding as explanation). The practitioner seeks mechanics.
[lines 11381-11400]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes the display as immeasurable, inconceivable great Dharma, with all lights and forms naturally arranged in majestic spontaneous presence. A reader might think: "This is describing the actual appearance of the base - a vast, majestic, luminous display that's the true nature of reality."
WHY IT ARISES:
Awe-inspiring descriptions evoke yearning. We imagine a reality more beautiful and profound than ordinary experience. This becomes the "real" world we seek to perceive.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the description as the "true" appearance of reality. Ordinary experience is dismissed in favor of seeking this majestic, luminous display.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying majestic display as real reality
2. Seeking visions of luminous arrangement
3. Disdaining ordinary appearances as inferior
4. Missing that majesty is in the seeing, not the seen
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (majestic display as real) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking visions) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (hierarchical reality). The practitioner seeks majesty.

[lines 11401-11420]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text quotes "Mu tig phreng ba" with poetic descriptions: clarity manifest, display spontaneously present, Dharma-kaya beyond introduction, essence naturally free, nature all-pervading. A reader might think: "This tantra reveals the actual characteristics of the display - clarity, spontaneous presence, natural freedom, all-pervasion."
WHY IT ARISES:
Poetic tantric language seems authoritative and descriptive. The specific characteristics (clarity, freedom, pervasion) seem like technical descriptions of enlightened qualities.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats tantric poetry as technical specifications. "Naturally free" becomes a property of essence, "all-pervading" a characteristic of nature.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing tantric qualities as properties
2. Seeking experiences matching descriptions
3. Debating which tantra is most descriptive
4. Missing that poetry evokes, not specifies
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (poetry as technical specs) → REIFICATION ERROR (qualities as properties) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking specific qualities). The practitioner seeks specifications.

[lines 11421-11440]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes how this display becomes the ground for samsara and nirvana, how compassion gives rise to impure appearance. A reader might think: "This explains the origin of delusion - how the pure display becomes impure samsara. This is the fall from primordial purity."
WHY IT ARISES:
Origin stories satisfy our need for narrative. The "fall" from purity to impurity is a familiar archetype. We imagine a primordial state that was lost or corrupted.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a narrative of the Fall - from pure display to impure samsara. This becomes a cosmological drama of primordial purity corrupted by confusion.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mourning the lost primordial purity
2. Seeking to restore original state
3. Viewing samsara as corruption of purity
4. Missing that purity was never lost
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (Fall narrative) → PRACTICE ERROR (restoration project) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (nostalgia for origin). The practitioner seeks return to Eden.

[lines 11441-11460]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text continues with extensive poetic descriptions from tantras, listing qualities like vast, spontaneous, clear, unceasing, complete. A reader might think: "This is the comprehensive description of the base's qualities. These are the definitive attributes of reality."
WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive lists suggest completeness. We assume that accumulating all these qualities gives us the full picture. Scholarly completeness masquerades as wisdom.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner compiles lists of the base's qualities. This becomes an encyclopedic project - cataloging all the characteristics of ultimate reality.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Accumulating quality lists
2. Comparing descriptions across sources
3. Competing in comprehensive cataloging
4. Missing that qualities are imputed, not inherent
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (quality cataloging) → REIFICATION ERROR (qualities as attributes) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (completeness as wisdom). The practitioner catalogs reality.
[lines 11461-11480]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains the eight modes of spontaneous accomplishment's arising in detail. A reader might think: "These are the eight fundamental modes of manifestation. Understanding these exhausts the nature of display. This is the complete taxonomy."
WHY IT ARISES:
Numbered taxonomies suggest comprehensiveness. "Eight modes" promises a complete map. We imagine that understanding these eight covers all possibilities of manifestation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The eight modes become a closed system of manifestation. The practitioner believes understanding these exhausts the nature of display, creating intellectual closure.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating eight modes as complete system
2. Seeking to experience all eight modes
3. Debating the exhaustiveness of the taxonomy
4. Missing that display is unlimited
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (closed taxonomy) → REIFICATION ERROR (modes as exhaustive) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (intellectual closure). The practitioner thinks they've got it.

[lines 11481-11500]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes each of the eight modes with poetic detail: desire unceasing like the wish-fulfilling jewel, enjoyment as wisdom-display, form as kayas, etc. A reader might think: "These describe the actual characteristics of each mode - the real way each one manifests in the nature."
WHY IT ARISES:
Vivid descriptions create mental imagery. We visualize each mode with its characteristics. The poetry seems to encode real information about the nature of each mode.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats poetic descriptions as technical specifications for each mode. "Wisdom-display" becomes a specific type of manifestation with defined characteristics.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing mode characteristics
2. Seeking experiences matching each description
3. Creating hierarchy among the modes
4. Missing that descriptions evoke, not define
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates REIFICATION ERROR (modes as defined entities) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking mode experiences) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (mode taxonomy). The practitioner categorizes the infinite.

[lines 11501-11520]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains how the impure mode of appearance arises from compassion's unceasing quality. A reader might think: "So impure samsara comes from compassion. This means samsara is actually a form of compassion, delusion is compassion's expression."
WHY IT ARISES:
We want samsara to be meaningful. If it comes from compassion, it has purpose. This justifies suffering as secretly enlightened, avoiding the difficult work of transformation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies samsara as "compassion's expression." This becomes spiritual bypassing - justifying delusion as secretly perfect, avoiding real practice.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Justifying neurotic patterns as "compassion"
2. Avoiding transformation since "it's all perfect"
3. Dismissing ethical discernment
4. Missing that recognition transforms, not justification
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (spiritual bypassing) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (avoiding real work) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (samsara as secretly pure). The practitioner justifies delusion.

[lines 11521-11540]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text continues with extensive quotations, detailed explanations of modes, and scriptural references. A reader might think: "This is the comprehensive philosophical presentation of spontaneous accomplishment. Studying this gives complete understanding."
WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive presentation suggests mastery. We assume that studying all these details yields understanding. Academic accumulation substitutes for recognition.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner approaches the text as comprehensive philosophy to be mastered. Understanding becomes equivalent to studying all the details and sources.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating text as comprehensive system
2. Accumulating scholarly knowledge
3. Competing in comprehensive understanding
4. Missing that pointing is not accumulating
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (comprehensive study) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (knowledge as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching comprehensive content). The tradition becomes encyclopedic.
[lines 11541-11560]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes the base as vast like space, clear like crystal, uninterrupted, appearing yet unestablished, with five lights naturally present. A reader might think: "This is describing the actual nature of the base - vast space-like awareness, crystal clarity, five lights. These are the real characteristics of ultimate reality."
WHY IT ARISES:
Rich descriptive language evokes vivid imagery. We naturally visualize these characteristics and assume they describe what the base "really is." The metaphors become the reality.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the descriptions as the inherent nature of the base. "Vast like space," "clear like crystal" become ontological claims about the ultimate.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking experiences of space-like vastness
2. Cultivating crystal clarity as a state
3. Looking for five lights in meditation
4. Missing that descriptions are pointers, not properties
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (metaphors as properties) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking described states) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (descriptive metaphysics). The practitioner chases descriptions.

[lines 11561-11580]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains that from this base, through the doorway of spontaneous self-arisen rigpa, the six realms appear. A reader might think: "So the six realms come from the base through rigpa. This explains the origin of samsara - it emanates from the pure base."
WHY IT ARISES:
Origin explanations satisfy our causal thinking. We want to know where samsara comes from. The idea that it "comes from" the base suggests a creation story.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a cosmogony - samsara arising from the pure base. This becomes a narrative of fall from purity, or manifestation of the unmanifest.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Viewing samsara as emanation from purity
2. Seeking to return to the source
3. Creating temporal sequence: base → display
4. Missing that base and display are not sequential
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (cosmogonical narrative) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking return to source) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (source as prior). The practitioner seeks the origin.

[lines 11581-11600]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states that deluded appearances are like dreams - not established in primordial purity's ground, naturally returning to it. A reader might think: "So delusions are like dreams - unreal, returning to the real ground. The practice is to let them naturally return, not to do anything."
WHY IT ARISES:
The dream analogy suggests effortless liberation. Dreams naturally fade - so too delusions naturally return to purity. This appeals to spiritual laziness.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts "natural return" as passive practice. "Just let it be" becomes an excuse for non-practice, waiting for delusions to naturally disappear.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Passive waiting for natural liberation
2. Justifying inaction as "natural practice"
3. Avoiding engaged transformative work
4. Missing that recognition requires engagement
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (passive waiting) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (avoidance) → NIHILISTIC ERROR (nothing to do). The practitioner waits for enlightenment.

[lines 11601-11620]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains the crucial distinction between self-appearance and common appearance, how in bardo one's own six realms appear, and the two aspects of whether they function or not. A reader might think: "This is explaining the technical details of how appearances work. These are the mechanics of the bardo and manifestation."
WHY IT ARISES:
Technical explanations satisfy intellectual curiosity. We want to understand "how it works." The mechanics of appearance become a fascinating subject of study.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the text as technical manual explaining mechanics. Bardo, self-appearance, and common appearance become subjects of scholarly analysis.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Studying mechanics of appearance
2. Debating technical details
3. Speculating about bardo mechanics
4. Missing that mechanics are imputed, not inherent
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (mechanical analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding mechanics as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching mechanics). The tradition becomes technical.
[lines 11621-11640]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text emphasizes distinguishing these two aspects is extremely important, explaining how impure samsara's door hasn't opened if self-appearance is recognized. A reader might think: "This is describing the crucial moment - if I recognize my own appearance in the bardo, I won't enter samsara. Recognition is the key."
WHY IT ARISES:
We seek the key technique, the crucial moment, the essential point. The emphasis on recognition as preventing samsara's door from opening suggests a practice strategy.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats recognition as a technique to prevent rebirth. This becomes a goal-oriented practice - recognize in bardo to avoid samsara.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Practicing recognition as future technique
2. Anxiety about missing recognition in bardo
3. Goal-oriented spiritual practice
4. Missing that recognition is present, not future
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (future-oriented technique) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking recognition experience) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (bardo anxiety). The practitioner practices for death.

[lines 11641-11660]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains that if deluded appearance hasn't emptied, one cannot be liberated, and that this crucial point is extremely profound. A reader might think: "So I must empty deluded appearances to be liberated. The practice is to make delusions empty."
WHY IT ARISES:
The idea that delusions must be "emptied" suggests a process of elimination or transformation. We imagine a practice of emptying, clearing, purifying deluded appearance.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts "emptying delusion" as practice goal. This becomes a project of clearing away delusion to reveal purity - a purification practice.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking to empty or clear delusion
2. Viewing delusion as obstacle to be removed
3. Progressive emptying practice
4. Missing that emptiness is nature, not achievement
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (emptying project) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking empty states) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (delusion as real thing to empty). The practitioner empties.

[lines 11661-11680]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text introduces the topic of establishing qualities and faults in detail, presenting three aspects: eight qualities generally shown, dividing into faults and qualities by conditions, and establishing the reasoning of arising and ceasing. A reader might think: "This is the systematic philosophical analysis of qualities and faults. This is rigorous Buddhist philosophy."
WHY IT ARISES:
Systematic structure suggests academic rigor. Threefold divisions promise comprehensive coverage. We assume this is serious philosophical analysis worth mastering.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the text as systematic philosophy to be studied. The three aspects become topics for scholarly analysis and debate.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating text as philosophical curriculum
2. Studying qualities/faults academically
3. Debating systematic categories
4. Missing that analysis serves recognition
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (academic analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (analysis as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching systematic philosophy). The tradition becomes academic.

[lines 11681-11690]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains that if the base were not spontaneously accomplished, there would be no meaning to base-display's arising, and no meaning to samsara/nirvana's arising. A reader might think: "This proves that the base must be spontaneously accomplished. The argument establishes this as the correct view."
WHY IT ARISES:
Logical arguments appeal to our rational mind. When we see reasoning that "proves" something, we accept the conclusion as established truth. This feels like solid ground.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the argument as proof establishing the view. Spontaneous accomplishment becomes an established philosophical position supported by logic.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating logic as establishing truth
2. Defending spontaneous accomplishment philosophically
3. Using arguments to prove the view
4. Missing that arguments are medicine, not food
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (philosophical argumentation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (logic as path to truth) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (proved metaphysics). The practitioner argues.
[lines 11691-11710]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains that base and base-display have inner/outer dimensions, subtle/outer appearances. A reader might think: "This describes the actual structure of the base - it has inner and outer aspects, subtle and outer dimensions. This is the architecture of reality."
WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial metaphors create mental maps. "Inner/outer," "subtle/outer" suggest a geography of reality. We naturally imagine this structure as the actual layout of existence.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies spatial metaphors as ontological structure. The base has "inner" and "outer" dimensions that are real features of existence.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Creating maps of inner/outer dimensions
2. Seeking the "inner" dimension
3. Privileging subtle over outer
4. Missing that spatial terms are metaphors
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (spatial metaphors as real) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (mapping reality) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking inner dimensions). The practitioner explores inner space.

[lines 11711-11730]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states that if there were no compassion arising in spontaneous self-resonance, samsara and nirvana would be separate sections, not fitting as tamer and tamed. A reader might think: "This explains the necessity of compassion - without it, there's no relationship between samsara and nirvana. Compassion bridges the gap."
WHY IT ARISES:
We want explanations for why things are the way they are. The necessity of compassion explains the functional relationship between samsara and nirvana. This satisfies our causal thinking.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats compassion as the necessary bridge between samsara and nirvana. This becomes a metaphysical principle - compassion makes enlightenment possible.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying compassion as metaphysical necessity
2. Studying compassion's role in cosmology
3. Debating the mechanics of compassion
4. Missing that compassion is activity, not principle
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (compassion as principle) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (compassion cosmology) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching compassion mechanics). The practitioner theorizes love.

[lines 11731-11750]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains that sentient beings' self-appearance is deluded while Buddhas' self-face is pure, therefore displays are not the same. A reader might think: "This shows there are two types of appearance - deluded (sentient beings) and pure (Buddhas). These are fundamentally different kinds of display."
WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic thinking naturally creates categories. "Deluded" vs "pure" appearance suggests two distinct types. We imagine these as ontologically different displays.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates dualistic ontology of appearances. Deluded and pure become two fundamentally different types of display with different natures.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dualistic view of appearance types
2. Seeking pure appearances
3. Rejecting deluded appearances
4. Missing that difference is in seeing, not display
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (dualistic appearances) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking pure displays) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (appearance-based discrimination). The practitioner judges appearances.
---
[lines 11751-11770]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states that although displays are not the same, sentient beings' benefit arises because there is compassion in the base, shining forth from base-display. A reader might think: "So compassion is really in the base, objectively present, shining forth to benefit beings. This explains how enlightenment activity works."
WHY IT ARISES:
We want compassion to be objectively real, not just a human quality. If compassion is "in the base," it provides ontological grounding for ethical action. This satisfies our need for cosmic justice.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies compassion as objectively present in the base. This becomes cosmic compassion - an inherent feature of reality that ensures benefit for beings.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying compassion as cosmic principle
2. Trusting in base-compassion rather than cultivating it
3. Cosmic justification for ethical action
4. Missing that compassion is expressed, not inherent
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (compassion as inherent) → REIFICATION ERROR (cosmic compassion) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching inherent compassion). The practitioner trusts the universe.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text presents detailed analysis of the eight qualities, dividing them by conditions into fault and quality aspects. A reader might think: "This is the systematic philosophical analysis of qualities. These are the real characteristics and their conditional nature."
WHY IT ARISES:
Systematic analysis appeals to intellectual satisfaction. We assume detailed categorization reveals truth. The eight qualities with their divisions promise comprehensive understanding.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the qualities as real characteristics with conditional natures. This becomes a metaphysics of qualities - cataloging the inherent features of the base.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Cataloging qualities as attributes
2. Analyzing conditions of each quality
3. Debating quality taxonomies
4. Missing that qualities are imputed
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (quality analysis) → REIFICATION ERROR (qualities as real) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (attributive metaphysics). The practitioner catalogs attributes.

[lines 11791-11810]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains the reasoning of arising and ceasing appearances, how impure appearance arises from non-recognition, how this is the crucial point. A reader might think: "This explains the mechanics of delusion - how not recognizing leads to impure appearance. Understanding this mechanics leads to liberation."
WHY IT ARISES:
Mechanistic explanations satisfy our causal thinking. If we understand "how delusion works," we think we can reverse it. Knowledge of mechanics promises control.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies the mechanics of delusion as if understanding them constitutes liberation. Intellectual knowledge of arising/ceasing substitutes for recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Studying mechanics of delusion intellectually
2. Thinking understanding = liberation
3. Analyzing arising and ceasing processes
4. Missing that mechanics are empty
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates EPISTEMIC ERROR (mechanics as wisdom) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (delusion mechanics) → PRACTICE ERROR (intellectual analysis). The practitioner analyzes.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text emphasizes that this crucial point is extremely profound and important. A reader might think: "This is the essential teaching - the crucial point about recognition. I must understand this point thoroughly and practice it."
WHY IT ARISES:
We seek the essential point, the core teaching, the crucial practice. Emphasis on importance signals this is the key. We want to grasp and apply this crucial point.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the "crucial point" as a technique to master. This becomes the key practice - understanding and applying this essential teaching.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Focusing on "crucial point" as technique
2. Anxiety about understanding it correctly
3. Practice centered on applying the point
4. Missing that crucial point is recognition itself
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (technique fixation) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (crucial point anxiety) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking crucial recognition). The practitioner seeks the key.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text presents extensive quotations and detailed arguments about qualities, faults, conditions, and reasoning. A reader might think: "This is comprehensive Buddhist philosophy - all the arguments, all the sources, all the reasoning systematically presented."
WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive presentation suggests mastery. We assume studying all this content yields understanding. Academic accumulation substitutes for direct recognition.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner approaches the text as comprehensive philosophy to be mastered through study. Understanding becomes equivalent to knowing all the arguments and sources.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating text as philosophical curriculum
2. Accumulating knowledge of arguments
3. Competing in comprehensive understanding
4. Missing that recognition is not knowledge
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (comprehensive study) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (knowledge as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (academic transmission). The tradition becomes scholastic.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains that if spontaneous accomplishment did not exist in the primordially pure essence, there would be no cause for the arising of impure appearance. A reader might think: "This proves spontaneous accomplishment must exist. The logic requires it as the cause of appearance."
WHY IT ARISES:
Causal reasoning feels solid. If spontaneous accomplishment is the "cause" of appearance, then it must exist. We accept the logical necessity as ontological proof.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats spontaneous accomplishment as a logically necessary existent. This becomes a metaphysical principle - the cause that must be.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying spontaneous accomplishment as necessary existent
2. Defending its existence philosophically
3. Using causality to prove ontology
4. Missing that causality is imputed
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (necessary existence) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (causal metaphysics) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (logic as ontology). The practitioner proves reality.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes how from the base's spontaneous presence, the play of impure appearance arises like dreams or illusions. A reader might think: "So impure appearance is like dreams - they arise from the base but aren't real. The base is the source of dreams."
WHY IT ARISES:
Dream/illusion metaphors are familiar. We imagine the base as dream-source, impure appearance as dreams. This creates a dualism: real base, unreal appearances.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as the "real source" and appearances as "unreal dreams." This becomes a two-level ontology with a privileged reality.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Privileging base over appearances
2. Seeking the "real" base beyond dreams
3. Disdaining appearances as "mere illusions"
4. Missing that both base and dreams are empty
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (base as real source) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking real base) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (dream metaphor dualism). The practitioner seeks beyond dreams.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains that the base is not nothing at all, because if it were, there would be no basis for delusion or liberation. A reader might think: "This proves the base is something - not nothing, not emptiness in a nihilistic sense. The base exists as the ground of possibility."
WHY IT ARISES:
Fear of nihilism drives us to find positive content. The argument that base cannot be "nothing" suggests it must be "something." We grasp this as the teaching.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as "something" that is not nothing. This becomes subtle eternalism - the base as existent ground of possibility.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying base as positive existent
2. Rejecting emptiness as "too negative"
3. Seeking the "something" that is the base
4. Missing that not-nothing is not something
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ETERNALISTIC ERROR (base as existent) → REIFICATION ERROR (positive ground) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching base as something). The practitioner affirms existence.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text presents extensive reasoning establishing the author's own view through philosophical argumentation. A reader might think: "This is rigorous philosophical theology establishing the correct view through reason. The arguments prove the position."
WHY IT ARISES:
We value rational argumentation as path to truth. Extensive reasoning seems to establish the view definitively. This is how academic philosophy works.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the arguments as proofs establishing the view. The author's position becomes the established truth supported by philosophical reasoning.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating arguments as establishing truth
2. Defending the established view
3. Using reasoning to prove Dzogchen
4. Missing that arguments are medicine
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (philosophical theology) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (reason as truth) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (argumentative transmission). The tradition becomes philosophical.
[lines 11931-11950]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text concludes that even though these are one's own appearances, there's a common worldly aspect established by collective karma and the teacher's activity. A reader might think: "This explains how shared reality works - collective karma creates common appearances, while individual appearances remain private. This is the ontology of shared world."
WHY IT ARISES:
We want to understand how we share a world if everything is "own appearance." The distinction between collective/common and individual/private satisfies our need for ontology of intersubjectivity.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates ontology of shared reality. Collective karma becomes the mechanism for common appearance, individual karma for private appearance.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying collective karma as world-source
2. Studying mechanics of shared appearance
3. Debating individual vs collective display
4. Missing that shared is also imputed
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (intersubjective metaphysics) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (karma mechanics) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (ontology of sharing). The practitioner explains the world.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text explains that self-appearance aspects return to oneself when the vase breaks, while common ones transfer to others. A reader might think: "This describes the mechanics of death and continuation. This is how rebirth works in Dzogchen."
WHY IT ARISES:
We want to understand death, rebirth, continuation. The vase-breaking metaphor suggests a mechanics of transition. We imagine this describes the actual process.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the description as mechanics of rebirth. Death becomes a technical transition where self-appearances return to oneself.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Understanding death mechanically
2. Planning for the transition
3. Technical approach to dying
4. Missing that description is not mechanics
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (death mechanics) → PRACTICE ERROR (technical dying) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (death anxiety). The practitioner plans for death.

[lines 11971-11990]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text emphasizes that distinguishing these two aspects (self-appearance and common) is extremely important. A reader might think: "This is the crucial distinction I must understand. This distinction is the key to practice."
WHY IT ARISES:
We seek the essential distinction, the crucial difference. Emphasis signals importance. We assume understanding this distinction is the key to realization.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner focuses on understanding the two aspects as the key teaching. This becomes the central practice - maintaining the distinction.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Fixating on the two-aspect distinction
2. Analyzing which appearances are which
3. Practice centered on distinction
4. Missing that distinction is provisional
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to EPISTEMIC ERROR (distinction as key) → PRACTICE ERROR (distinction-fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (aspect analysis). The practitioner distinguishes.

[lines 11991-12010]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text presents extensive reasoning about the eight qualities, conditions, base-display, compassion, and benefit for beings. A reader might think: "This completes the philosophical presentation of the base's qualities. This is the comprehensive understanding."
WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive presentation suggests completion. We assume this exhausts the topic, gives the full picture. Academic completion substitutes for wisdom.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the text as completing a philosophical system. Understanding the eight qualities exhausts knowledge of the base.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating text as comprehensive system
2. Believing topic is now covered
3. Intellectual closure on the subject
4. Missing that the base is beyond coverage
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (comprehensive completion) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (coverage as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching completed systems). The tradition closes the book.
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states "tame and tame-maker as relate is" and quotes the Secret Essence on great compassion relating all six realms. A reader might think: "This proves everything is fundamentally connected through compassion—a cosmic web of interrelatedness where all beings are linked."
WHY IT ARISES:
Modern spirituality emphasizes "interconnectedness" and "oneness." The language of "relate" and "six realms appearing" triggers New Age associations of universal connection. Western practitioners seek confirmation of a benevolent, interconnected universe.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies "compassion" as a cosmic force connecting everything, like an energy field. They believe recognizing this interconnectedness IS the Dzogchen view, conflating Mahayana compassion teachings with Atiyoga's primordial purity.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Compassion becomes an object of meditation rather than spontaneous expression
2. The practitioner seeks experiences of "universal oneness"
3. Dzogchen is reduced to a philosophy of interconnectedness
4. Actual recognition of rigpa is missed while seeking connection
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified interconnectedness) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (cultivating compassion experiences) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching "we are all one" as Dzogchen). The practitioner becomes a compassion activist without genuine view.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes how light-tone awareness base and appearing-aspect must exist for the five elements to be clear, and how without non-duality, the three doors cannot relate. A reader might think: "The base is like a container that holds awareness and appearance. Without this container, nothing could exist."
WHY IT ARISES:
Our habitual reification makes us imagine a "space" in which things exist. The text's functional language ("if X not exist, Y not arise") triggers the assumption of a substantial base that enables existence, like a field or ground.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner conceives the base as a metaphysical ground or substrate underlying reality—a "thing" that makes other things possible. They picture awareness "in" the base like water in a bowl.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Base becomes an object of meditation ("resting in the base")
2. The practitioner seeks to "merge" with this ground
3. Dzogchen becomes substance metaphysics
4. The non-reified nature of rigpa is completely missed
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified base as ultimate substance) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking union with the base) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (creating dualism between base and appearances). The practitioner worships a metaphysical abstraction.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text says if body-like appearance did not exist, the purpose of bodies appearing would not come, and if wisdom-like appearance did not exist, there would be the defect of no wisdom-appearance on the path. A reader might think: "The text is proving that these appearances DO exist as real qualities of the base—they're listing the 'features' of Buddha-nature."
WHY IT ARISES:
The refutation of "non-existence" feels like affirmation of existence. Western logic training makes us read "if X didn't exist, Y would not happen" as proof that X exists. The practitioner seeks a positive description of Buddha-nature.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner compiles a list of existent qualities of the base: body-appearance, wisdom-appearance, liberation-appearance, etc. These become reified attributes of a Buddha-nature that "has" qualities like a possession.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Buddha-nature becomes a "thing" with properties
2. The practitioner seeks to realize these qualities as existent
3. Dzogchen becomes a descriptive metaphysics
4. Emptiness of qualities is ignored
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (qualities as truly existent) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (debating which qualities belong to Buddha-nature) → PRACTICE ERROR (trying to acquire qualities). The practitioner collects attributes like merit badges.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes impure appearances as arising through the door of spontaneous presence, like a window allowing pure/impure appearances to be seen. A reader might think: "Spontaneous presence is like a projector screen where both pure and impure movies play. The screen itself is neutral but allows everything to appear."
WHY IT ARISES:
The window/skylight metaphor is vivid and concrete. Westerners latch onto metaphors and take them literally. The idea of a "neutral ground" that permits all appearances seems profound and practical.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as a neutral medium or capacity for appearance—a kind of universal potentiality that "can" show pure or impure. They try to "rest" in this spontaneous presence.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Spontaneous presence becomes a meditation object
2. The practitioner tries to "purify" what appears on the "screen"
3. The inseparability of primordial purity and spontaneous presence is lost
4. Lhun grub is grasped as superior to kun gzhi (alaya)
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers REIFICATION ERROR (lhun grub as medium) → PRACTICE ERROR (meditating on spontaneous presence) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (dualism between purity and presence). The practitioner becomes a metaphysical projectionist.
