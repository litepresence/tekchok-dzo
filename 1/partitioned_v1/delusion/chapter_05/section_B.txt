[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATION FIXATION]
MISREADING:
Reader treats Trekcho - cutting through conceptual mind as a technique to be mastered through repeated application, believing that correct execution automatically produces realization.
WHY IT ARISES:
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Trekcho - cutting through conceptual mind is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice becomes doing rather than being.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Technique accumulation replaces wisdom cultivation. Practitioners collect methods while missing the view that animates them. Practice becomes performance.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING] and [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. All practice becomes technique-accumulation.

[VIEW ERROR] [PHILOSOPHICAL FIXATION]
MISREADING:
Reader adopts Trekcho - cutting through conceptual mind as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.
WHY IT ARISES:
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Trekcho - cutting through conceptual mind is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.
CASCADE EFFECTS:

[EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [EMPTINESS NIHILISM]
MISREADING:
Reader seeks Trekcho - cutting through conceptual mind as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.
WHY IT ARISES:
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Trekcho - cutting through conceptual mind is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.

Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Four visions - infinite awareness exhausting is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.

[GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [NON-CONCEPTUAL GRASPING]
MISREADING:
Reader interprets Four visions - infinite awareness exhausting through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Four visions - infinite awareness exhausting is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [ACHIEVEMENT MAPPING]
MISREADING:
Reader treats Four visions - infinite awareness exhausting as a technique to be mastered through repeated application, believing that correct execution automatically produces realization.
WHY IT ARISES:
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Four visions - infinite awareness exhausting is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice becomes doing rather than being.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Technique accumulation replaces wisdom cultivation. Practitioners collect methods while missing the view that animates them. Practice becomes performance.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING] and [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. All practice becomes technique-accumulation.

[PROGRESS TRACKING] [SEQUENTIAL DELUSION]
MISREADING:
Reader understands Four visions - infinite awareness exhausting as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.
WHY IT ARISES:
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Four visions - infinite awareness exhausting is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.
