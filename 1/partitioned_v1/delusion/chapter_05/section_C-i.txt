[PROGRESS TRACKING] [POSTURE RIGIDITY]
MISREADING:
Reader understands Ground (gzhi) - base of all appearing as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.
WHY IT ARISES:
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Ground (gzhi) - base of all appearing is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.

MISREADING:
Reader interprets Ground (gzhi) - base of all appearing through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Ground (gzhi) - base of all appearing is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.

[9720-9727] 
[EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING]
MISREADING:
Reader seeks Fruition - nothing to achieve error as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.
WHY IT ARISES:
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Fruition - nothing to achieve error is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.

[9728-9735] 
[GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [NON-CONCEPTUAL GRASPING]
MISREADING:
Reader interprets Fruition - nothing to achieve error through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Fruition - nothing to achieve error is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [ACHIEVEMENT MAPPING]
MISREADING:
Reader treats Fruition - nothing to achieve error as a technique to be mastered through repeated application, believing that correct execution automatically produces realization.
WHY IT ARISES:
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Fruition - nothing to achieve error is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice becomes doing rather than being.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Technique accumulation replaces wisdom cultivation. Practitioners collect methods while missing the view that animates them. Practice becomes performance.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING] and [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. All practice becomes technique-accumulation.

[9744-9752] 
[PROGRESS TRACKING] [SEQUENTIAL DELUSION]
MISREADING:
Reader understands Fruition - nothing to achieve error as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.
WHY IT ARISES:
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Fruition - nothing to achieve error is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.
