[13321-13335] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The channels and their functions are interpreted as actual subtle anatomy to be mastered rather than symbolic of cognitive processes to recognize.
WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical detail suggests physical reality. Technical terminology suggests specialized knowledge to acquire.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on recognizing mind's nature is replaced by subtle body mastery. The simplicity of recognition is lost in complexity.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner becomes expert in subtle anatomy without recognition. The pointing to immediate experience is obscured by learning.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LEARNING ERROR] and [MASTERY ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Co-emergent ignorance" (lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig pa) is understood as original sin or inherent flaw rather than simultaneous arising with awareness.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Ignorance" suggests deficiency. "Co-emergent" suggests paired existence.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on the non-duality of awareness and its display is replaced by dualistic problem/solution framework. The simultaneity is lost.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops guilt or sees ignorance as enemy. The recognition that ignorance and awareness share the same nature is missed.
