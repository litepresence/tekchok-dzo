[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, CLOUD-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states "that-also base and base-appearance both to ignorance none although cloud like adventitiously arise by-means-of condition made impure samsara like appear doorway cause made." A reader might think: "Base and appearances are without ignorance but clouds appear adventitiously. I need to see through these clouds to the clear sky of the base."
WHY IT ARISES:
Cloud-sky metaphors are vivid and common. Westerners immediately grasp the metaphor. "Seeing through" seems like the practice.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner tries to "see through" adventitious clouds to the clear base, creating a practice of penetration.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Clouds are rejected for sky
2. Seeing-through is practiced
3. Adventitious is denied
4. Dzogchen becomes weather watching
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates CLOUD-ERROR (metaphor fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeing through) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (clouds vs sky dualism). The practitioner waits for clear skies.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENT-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These are the five great elements from which all realms arise. I need to understand elemental cosmology to understand manifestation."
WHY IT ARISES:
Elements suggest fundamental building blocks. Western science and occult study elements. Cosmology seems like deep knowledge.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies five-element cosmology as explanation for manifestation, seeking elemental understanding.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Elements are reified as causes
2. Cosmology becomes fixation
3. Natural arising is analyzed away
4. Dzogchen becomes elemental science
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ELEMENT-ERROR (cosmological fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (elemental analysis) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as causes). The practitioner becomes an elemental scientist.

[12395-12414] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, IGNORANCE-TYPE-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes six types of ignorance: "ignorance six-as arise-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of appearance not-know said root mind-by-means-of ignorance and delusion object-by-means-of ignorance and delusion-basis basis-by-means-of ignorance and." A reader might think: "These are six specific ignorances with different causes. I need to identify which type I have and apply the appropriate remedy."
WHY IT ARISES:
Typologies suggest diagnosis and treatment. Western medicine treats by type. Six ignorances seem like conditions to diagnose.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner diagnoses their ignorance type, seeking specific remedies for each category.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Self is analyzed into ignorance types
2. Remedies are applied specifically
3. Natural wisdom is obscured by diagnosis
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual medicine
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates IGNORANCE-TYPE-ERROR (diagnostic fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (type-specific remedies) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as entities). The practitioner becomes their own diagnostician.
---
[12415-12440] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, TREE-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text mentions "wish-fulfilling tree spread called Buddha youth vase body-by-means-of blessing from arise-by-means-of tree and egg from arise-by-means-of heat and moisture from hatch one exist." A reader might think: "This is describing cosmogony—how the world arose from a wish-fulfilling tree through heat and moisture. This is mythology to understand."
WHY IT ARISES:
Cosmogonic myths fascinate Westerners. Origin stories feel like deep truth. The tree metaphor suggests creation mythology.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies the cosmogony as literal creation myth, seeking to understand world-origins.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Myth is taken as history
2. Origins are sought
3. Present recognition is abandoned
4. Dzogchen becomes mythology
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates TREE-ERROR (cosmogonic literalism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origin for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (myth as history). The practitioner studies creation.
[12372-12394] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENT-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These five elements are the actual building blocks from which all realms physically manifest. Understanding elemental cosmology is key to understanding how samsara is constructed."
WHY IT ARISES:
The concrete enumeration of elements and realms suggests a physical cosmology. Western materialist and pagan traditions work with elemental forces. The systematic correspondence feels like hidden knowledge.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies the five elements as metaphysical forces generating realms, attempting to work with elemental energies. They reify elements as primal powers.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Elements are approached as forces to harness
2. Realm manifestation becomes engineering
3. Natural purity is obscured by elemental work
4. Dzogchen becomes elemental magic
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ELEMENT-ERROR (elemental reification) → PRACTICE ERROR (elemental manipulation) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as causal). The practitioner becomes an elemental magician.

[12395-12417] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, IGNORANCE-TAXONOMY-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text catalogs six ignorances arising through different modes: root mind, delusion object, delusion-basis, grasp thought, remedy path, and not-know confuse. A reader might think: "These are six distinct types of ignorance with specific characteristics. I need to diagnose which types afflict me and apply targeted remedies."
WHY IT ARISES:
Taxonomies promise precision and control. Western psychology diagnoses by type. The six-fold classification suggests personalized treatment.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes their experience for these six ignorance types, seeking to categorize and eliminate each specifically.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Experience is fragmented into types
2. Remedies are tailored to diagnoses
3. Natural self-liberation is replaced with treatment
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual medicine
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates IGNORANCE-TAXONOMY-ERROR (diagnostic fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (type-specific treatments) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as entities). The practitioner becomes a spiritual diagnostician.
---
[12418-12440] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOGONY-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes the wish-fulfilling tree, Buddha's blessing, eggs, heat and moisture, and the arising of world systems. A reader might think: "This is the actual cosmogony—how the universe literally began. Understanding this creation story reveals the deepest truth about reality."
WHY IT ARISES:
Origin narratives satisfy existential curiosity. Westerners seek creation stories. The vivid imagery suggests mythic truth about beginnings.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner interprets the cosmogony as literal history, studying how the world began instead of recognizing its nature.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Myth is taken as historical fact
2. Present recognition is postponed for origin-understanding
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen becomes mythology
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COSMOGONY-ERROR (literal myth) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origin for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (myth as history). The practitioner studies the beginning instead of recognizing.

[12441-12453] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, MIND-CATEGORY-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists various minds: "Ignorance and equal mind and mind consciousness mind and all seek mind and certainty put mind and aspect coarse mind and definitely place mind." A reader might think: "These are distinct categories of mind I need to identify in my experience. Understanding these categories will clarify my mental landscape."
WHY IT ARISES:
Categorical lists suggest typologies to master. Western psychology categorizes mental states. The detailed enumeration promises comprehensive understanding.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner categorizes their mental states according to these types, seeking to map their mind completely.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mind is fragmented into categories
2. Experience is analyzed rather than recognized
3. Natural clarity is obscured by mapping
4. Dzogchen becomes mental cartography
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MIND-CATEGORY-ERROR (typological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (mental mapping) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (minds as separate entities). The practitioner draws maps of their mind.
[12288-12307] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, TIME-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states "Time to certainty not-possess-by-means-of time before after mutually conflict-by-means-of equal immediate condition self place liberate." A reader might think: "Time is uncertain and conflicted. I need to escape time into the immediate condition where past and future don't exist."
WHY IT ARISES:
Time anxiety is universal in modernity. The description of temporal conflict triggers desire for timelessness. "Immediate" promises escape from duration.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner seeks to escape temporal experience into an eternal present, rejecting time as obstacle.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Time is rejected as impure
2. "Immediate" is reified as timeless state
3. Natural unfolding is denied
4. Dzogchen becomes escapism
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates TIME-ERROR (temporal rejection) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking timelessness) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (timeless vs temporal). The practitioner tries to stop the clock.
---
[12308-12330] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, DEPENDENT-ORIGINATION-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes dependent origination through twelve links from ignorance to aging-dying. A reader might think: "This is the mechanism of samsara. If I can understand and break any link, I can stop the whole process."
WHY IT ARISES:
Mechanistic explanations appeal to Western engineering minds. The chain metaphor suggests weak links to target. Understanding seems like control.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes dependent origination mechanically, seeking to identify and break specific links in the chain.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dependent origination is treated as machine
2. Intervention points are targeted
3. Natural flow is resisted
4. Dzogchen becomes mechanical engineering
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates DEPENDENT-ORIGINATION-ERROR (mechanistic thinking) → PRACTICE ERROR (link-breaking) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (samsara as machine). The practitioner becomes a spiritual mechanic.
---
[12331-12348] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, BARDO-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes the bardo process: "life one even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first self face not-know is ignorance outer breath cut time die by that interval dependent-origination manner enters." A reader might think: "This is the actual process of death and bardo I will experience. I must prepare now so I can recognize when it happens."
WHY IT ARISES:
Death is universally feared. The detailed description promises preparation. Future-oriented Westerners want to plan for death.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner anxiously prepares for death and bardo, trying to memorize the stages for future recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Present recognition is abandoned for future preparation
2. Death anxiety drives practice
3. Bardo is feared as real transition
4. Living is missed while preparing for dying
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates BARDO-ERROR (future fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (death preparation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (future recognition). The practitioner lives for their death.

[12349-12371] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, EMPTY-FIVE-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists "aggregates five and faculties five limbs five and essences five objects five and afflictions five minds five mentals five thoughts five grasped-grasper samsara accomplished." A reader might think: "All these fives are just empty constructions. None of them are real. I should dismiss all this analysis as mere samsaric fabrication."
WHY IT ARISES:
The repetitive "five" and "accomplished" suggests empty construction. Western nihilists use emptiness to dismiss. The lists seem like mere enumeration.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner dismisses all five-fold analysis as empty fabrication, missing the precise pointing within the enumeration.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Lists are rejected without understanding
2. Nihilism masquerades as emptiness wisdom
3. Detailed analysis is abandoned
4. Dzogchen becomes dismissal
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates EMPTY-FIVE-ERROR (nihilistic dismissal) → PRACTICE ERROR (avoiding analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (emptiness as rejection). The practitioner emptily dismisses all.
[12372-12394] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENTAL-ORIGIN-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These elements are the actual primordial substances from which all existence physically manifests. Mastering the elements means mastering manifestation."
WHY IT ARISES:
Elemental metaphysics appeals to Western esoteric traditions. The systematic correspondence between elements and realms suggests hidden natural laws. Physicalist thinking seeks material causes.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the five elements as metaphysical forces generating reality, attempting to harness elemental power for spiritual ends.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Elements are reified as causal forces
2. Realm manifestation becomes control project
3. Natural purity is obscured by elemental work
4. Dzogchen becomes elemental sorcery
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ELEMENTAL-ORIGIN-ERROR (force reification) → PRACTICE ERROR (elemental manipulation) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as creative powers). The practitioner becomes an elemental sorcerer.

[12395-12417] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SIX-IGNORANCE-DIAGNOSIS-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text enumerates six ignorances: "ignorance six-as arise root mind-by-means-of ignorance and delusion object-by-means-of ignorance and delusion-basis basis-by-means-of ignorance and grasp thought-by-means-of ignorance and remedy path-by-means-of ignorance and not-know confuse-by-means-of ignorance." A reader might think: "These are six distinct pathologies of mind requiring specific diagnoses and treatments. I need to identify which afflict me."
WHY IT ARISES:
Medical typologies promise precision healing. Western diagnostic culture categorizes dysfunction. The six-fold classification invites self-analysis.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner diagnostically examines their experience for these six ignorance types, seeking targeted interventions.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Experience is medicalized into pathologies
2. Remedies are prescribed by diagnosis
3. Natural self-liberation is replaced with treatment
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual pathology
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SIX-IGNORANCE-DIAGNOSIS-ERROR (pathological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (targeted interventions) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as diseases). The practitioner becomes a spiritual psychiatrist.

[12418-12453] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOGONIC-LITERALISM-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes the wish-fulfilling tree, Buddha's blessing, eggs, heat and moisture, and world arising from Jambudvipa. A reader might think: "This is the literal account of cosmic creation. Understanding this cosmogony reveals the fundamental structure of reality."
WHY IT ARISES:
Origin myths satisfy existential questioning. Western literalists seek historical truth in myths. The vivid imagery suggests hidden cosmological knowledge.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner interprets the cosmogony as factual history, studying world-origins instead of recognizing mind's nature.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Myth is historicized
2. Present recognition is postponed for origin-knowledge
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen becomes creationism
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COSMOGONIC-LITERALISM-ERROR (myth as history) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origins for truth) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (creation as fact). The practitioner studies Genesis instead of recognizing.
---
[12441-12453] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, MIND-TYPOLOGY-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text catalogues: "Ignorance and equal mind and mind consciousness mind and all seek mind and certainty put mind and aspect coarse mind and definitely place mind." A reader might think: "These are distinct categories of mental function I can identify in my experience. Mastering this typology gives comprehensive mind-knowledge."
WHY IT ARISES:
Classification systems promise mastery. Western cognitive science categorizes mental functions. The detailed typology invites academic study.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner categorizes their mental states according to this system, seeking complete mental mapping.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mind is fragmented into categories
2. Experience is catalogued rather than recognized
3. Natural clarity is obscured by classification
4. Dzogchen becomes cognitive taxonomy
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MIND-TYPOLOGY-ERROR (classificatory fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (mental cataloguing) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mind as category-system). The practitioner becomes a librarian of their own mind.
[12454-12469] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, OBSCURATION-WARFARE-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states "Mind six gather-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of path obscure and that also mind-by-means-of wisdom not-see and clear not-give wisdom to thought not-possess mind from move-maker exist-by-means-of cause Buddha-by-means-of path obscure is." A reader might think: "Mind actively obscures wisdom and Buddha-path. I must stop mind's movement to clear the path. This requires aggressive intervention."
WHY IT ARISES:
"Obscure" suggests active enemy. Western spiritual warfare metaphors frame mind as opponent. The causal language implies intervention is possible.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner wages war on mind, attempting to forcefully stop its movement to reveal wisdom. They reify obscuration as enemy to defeat.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mind is demonized as opponent
2. Aggressive suppression replaces gentle recognition
3. Natural clarity is obscured by warfare
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual violence
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates OBSCURATION-WARFARE-ERROR (mind as enemy) → PRACTICE ERROR (aggressive suppression) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mind vs wisdom dualism). The practitioner battles their own mind.
---
[12470-12497] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MYTHIC-HISTORY-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes "first spontaneous from self arise and self face not-know-by-means-of awareness from end delusion cease time later not-pure lineage cut stain what be that samsara first-last is Buddha last not-possess." A reader might think: "This is the actual historical sequence—first spontaneous presence, then not-knowing, then delusion, then potential lineage-cutting. I need to understand this timeline."
WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential descriptions trigger historical thinking. Western narrative consciousness seeks timelines. The "first" and "later" suggest temporal sequence.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner interprets the description as historical timeline, trying to locate themselves in the sequence of fall and potential redemption.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Atemporal truth is temporalized
2. Present recognition is abandoned for historical understanding
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen becomes sacred history
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MYTHIC-HISTORY-ERROR (temporal literalism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (history for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (fall-redemption timeline). The practitioner studies salvation history.
---
[12498-12510] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, ARMY-OBSTACLE-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists "Friend four do then wild-man five arise then back-support one arise then thief one arise that all accumulate-by-means-of one arise that etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise." A reader might think: "These are actual negative forces—wild men, thieves, armies—that arise to obstruct practice. I need protection rituals and methods to overcome them."
WHY IT ARISES:
Dramatic obstacle imagery suggests real dangers. Western spiritual warfare traditions battle negative forces. The accumulation into armies implies serious threat.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the "army" as actual obstructing forces, seeking protective practices and exorcisms.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Forces are treated as real enemies
2. Protection becomes fixation
3. The empty nature is missed
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual combat
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ARMY-OBSTACLE-ERROR (demonological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (protective rituals) → REIFICATION ERROR (forces as real entities). The practitioner raises spiritual armies.
---
[12474-12499] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SECTIONAL-SEQUENCE-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states "Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show." A reader might think: "The teaching is organized in nine sequential sections showing divergence and liberation. I must progress through these sections in order."
WHY IT ARISES:
Numerical organization suggests curriculum. Western educational systems follow sequences. "Section nine" implies structured progression.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the nine sections as progressive curriculum, delaying understanding until completing the sequence.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Sequential reading replaces instant recognition
2. Later sections are prematurely postponed
3. Present understanding is deferred
4. Dzogchen becomes academic course
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SECTIONAL-SEQUENCE-ERROR (curriculum fixation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (sequence for understanding) → PRACTICE ERROR (progressive study). The practitioner takes the course instead of recognizing.
[12455-12473, 12500-12510]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, OBSTRUCTIVE-FORCES-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes "Vow break action many do definitely place mind that all-by-means-of appearance to I-by-means-of be and other-by-means-of be think that definitely place mind that grasp thought-by-means-of ignorance called remedy path-by-means-of ignorance." A reader might think: "Breaking vows creates forces that grasp at appearances and self. These are actual obstructive entities generated by negative action. I need purification practices."
WHY IT ARISES:
Moral causality suggests generated forces. Western guilt creates fear of karmic consequences. "Definitely place mind" sounds like created entities.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies broken-vow consequences as actual forces, seeking purification to eliminate them.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Guilt drives purification obsession
2. Forces are treated as real obstacles
3. Natural purity is obscured by purification
4. Dzogchen becomes sin-management
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates OBSTRUCTIVE-FORCES-ERROR (karmic literalism) → PRACTICE ERROR (purification obsession) → REIFICATION ERROR (sins as entities). The practitioner scrubs their karma.
---
[12474-12497] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states "Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show and now delusion manner and delusion reverse manner sequence symbol door from extensive show to eight from." A reader might think: "The text has a precise structure—nine sections on divergence, then eight doors on reversal. Understanding this architecture is essential."
WHY IT ARISES:
Structural analysis appeals to Western academic minds. The numerical precision suggests intentional design. Architecture implies engineering principles.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes the text's structure, believing architectural understanding reveals meaning.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Form replaces content
2. Structure is analyzed rather than recognized
3. Natural pointing is missed in architecture
4. Dzogchen becomes structural engineering
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS-ERROR (architectural fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (endless analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (form for content). The practitioner studies the building instead of entering.
---
[12498-12510] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MULTIPLICITY-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists "Friend four do then wild-man five arise then back-support one arise then thief one arise that all accumulate-by-means-of one arise that etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise that etc. measure-not-possess-as delude." A reader might think: "These specific numbers—four, five, one, one—have numerological significance. I need to understand the pattern of accumulation."
WHY IT ARISES:
Numerical patterns suggest esoteric codes. Western numerology seeks hidden meanings. The accumulation arithmetic implies calculable process.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes the numerical pattern, seeking numerological significance in the accumulating forces.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Numbers are esotericized
2. Arithmetic replaces recognition
3. Pattern is sought in description
4. Dzogchen becomes numerology
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MULTIPLICITY-ERROR (numerological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (pattern-seeking) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (numbers as powers). The practitioner counts their obstacles.
---
[12511-12520] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, DELUSION-BASIS-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text concludes "That from delusion-basis not-possess from arise-by-means-of cause although there-not is basis that delusion not-possess from arise although delude." A reader might think: "Even though delusion-basis doesn't exist, it still arises as cause. This is the mystery—how non-existent basis produces apparent delusion. I need to solve this paradox."
WHY IT ARISES:
Paradoxes fascinate Western philosophical minds. The contradiction between "not-possess" and "arise" invites analysis. Solving paradoxes seems like wisdom.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to philosophically resolve the paradox of non-existent basis producing delusion.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Paradox is approached intellectually
2. Resolution is sought conceptually
3. The mystery is explained away
4. Dzogchen becomes philosophy puzzle
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates DELUSION-BASIS-ERROR (paradox fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (philosophical analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (resolution for understanding). The philosopher solves the unsolvable.
---
[12478-12499] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOLOGICAL-DETAIL-ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists specific delusion scenarios: "Field Broad called from delude place Beautiful called from delude time when destroyed and delude year Pig year to delude sun Created sun to delude star Bird to delude human name Old-one Heap-possess called delude." A reader might think: "These are specific astrological and historical conditions that trigger delusion. I must avoid these times and names."
WHY IT ARISES:
Specific details suggest actionable information. Western astrology and superstition seek to avoid inauspicious conditions. The particulars seem meaningful.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the details as astrological warnings, seeking to avoid specific times and circumstances.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. External conditions are controlled
2. Superstition replaces recognition
3. Life is constrained by avoidance
4. Dzogchen becomes divination
CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COSMOLOGICAL-DETAIL-ERROR (superstitious literalism) → PRACTICE ERROR (avoidance behavior) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (conditions as determining). The practitioner consults their horoscope.
[12500-12513] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
Reader interprets the symbolic narrative literally, understanding "Pig year" and "Created sun" as actual temporal events rather than stages of delusion's arising.
WHY IT ARISES:
The narrative form with specific years and celestial bodies triggers historical/literal reading. The desire for concrete reference points supports this misreading.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's symbolic language is reduced to cryptic history. The teaching about how delusion arises from pure ground becomes a story about ancient times.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks literal correspondences rather than recognizing the symbolic structure in their own experience. The immediacy of recognition is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [TEMPORAL ERROR].
---
[12514-12533] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "five poisons" (dug lnga) are understood as actual substances or forces to be eliminated, rather than spontaneous display of awareness.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Poison" suggests something harmful to remove. Dualistic frameworks require elimination of obstacles for realization.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes purification of poisons rather than recognition of their nature. The transformative potential of afflictions is entirely missed.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Aversion toward negative emotions develops. The teaching that poisons are wisdom when recognized becomes theoretical rather than lived.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] and [MORALISTIC ERROR].
---
[12534-12546] 
[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
Reader treats the symbolic narrative (Yacha story) as mere allegory or teaching device without actual transformative content.
WHY IT ARISES:
Modern skepticism toward symbolic narratives combines with inability to recognize symbolic language as pointing to direct experience.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The bar do (intermediate state) instructions encoded in the narrative are dismissed as mythology. Direct guidance for recognition is lost.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they understand the "meaning" without undergoing the transformative recognition the narrative is designed to trigger.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [INTELLECTUALIZATION ERROR] and [EPISTEMIC ERROR].
---
[12555-12557] 
[RECOGNITION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Seeing one's own face" (rang gi rang ngo shes) is interpreted as self-knowledge or self-awareness in the conventional psychological sense.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Self" and "face" suggest introspection. Modern psychological frameworks interpret self-knowledge as self-reflection.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen recognition is reduced to self-awareness practice. The fundamental distinction between mind (sems) and awareness (rig pa) is collapsed.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner cultivates self-observation rather than recognition of awareness-nature. Meditative experience becomes recursive self-monitoring.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].
[12558-12571] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SPATIALIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "cave of samsara" ('khor ba'i dong) and "door closed by ignorance" are understood as actual locations and physical barriers.
WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The tendency to concretize abstract processes supports this reading.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Liberation becomes escape from a place rather than recognition of the nature of appearing. Samsara is reified as a container.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice is oriented toward leaving samsara rather than recognizing its nature. The non-dual teaching is undermined by dualistic spatialization.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [DUALISTIC ERROR].
---
[12572-12581] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "four wisdoms" (shes rab bzhi) are treated as sequential stages of practice to be cultivated over time.
WHY IT ARISES:
The enumerated list suggests progressive stages. Linear temporal frameworks interpret practice as development through stages.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Simultaneous recognition is replaced by gradual cultivation. The wisdoms, which are aspects of one recognition, are pursued separately.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner exhausts themselves trying to master each wisdom sequentially, missing that they are spontaneously present.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GRADUALIST ERROR] and [EFFORT ERROR].
---
[12582-12593] 
[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Sun and moon realm" (nyi ma can) is understood as an actual pure land or destination to reach through practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
Directional language suggests destination. The desire for a safe haven supports literalization of pure lands.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes journey toward a goal. The recognition that pure land is the nature of one's own mind is entirely missed.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Future-oriented practice replaces present recognition. The teaching that buddhafields are appearances of rig pa becomes mere belief.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR] and [FUTURIZATION ERROR].

[12594-12607] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The narrative of "Field Broad" (yul yangs pa can), the teacher "Light-Spread" ('od 'gyed pa), and the siblings is read as historical account.
WHY IT ARISES:
Proper names and narrative coherence trigger historical reading. Cultural conditioning toward literal interpretation of scriptures.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic anatomy being taught—how rig pa and spontaneous presence relate—is missed entirely. Narrative becomes entertainment or mythology.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader accumulates "knowledge" about the story without recognizing the mirror-like nature of their own awareness being pointed to.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [INFORMATIONAL ERROR] and [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR].
[12608-12622] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DEMONOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "black demon" (bdud nag po) and "demon realm" are understood as actual malevolent entities and locations rather than aspects of dualistic fixation.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Demon" (bdud) suggests external threat. Cultural residue of pre-Buddhist demonology supports literal reading.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen teaching is reduced to exorcism or protection from external forces. The internal process of dualistic fixation is externalized.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops fear-based practice or seeks protection rituals. The recognition that demons are one's own projections is missed.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR] and [FEAR-BASED ERROR].

[12623-12637] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "four types of people" (mi bzhi) and their military roles are interpreted as literal caste or social classes needed for practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
Enumeration suggests classification system. Socio-political frameworks interpret symbolic categories as social stratification.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The four wisdom aspects symbolized by the four types are reduced to social commentary. Technical instructions become sociological observation.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner misses the pointing to the four modes of wisdom (gathering, liberating, distinguishing, moving). Practice degenerates into class analysis.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SOCIOLOGICAL COLLAPSE ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].
---
[12638-12652] 
[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The aunt "Ling-thog-can" and her refusal to release the son is understood as family drama rather than teaching on co-emergent ignorance.
WHY IT ARISES:
Family narrative triggers psychological reading. The relational dynamics suggest interpersonal conflict interpretation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching about lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig pa (co-emergent ignorance) binding rig pa is entirely missed. Drama replaces dharma.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they understand the "story" while remaining completely ignorant of the crucial Dzogchen distinction between innate ignorance and cognitive ignorance.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] and [IGNORANCE MISCLASSIFICATION ERROR].
---
[12653-12664] 
[PRACTICE ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The weapons (sword, mirrors) and military force are interpreted as actual implements and armies needed for spiritual warfare.
WHY IT ARISES:
Military imagery triggers literal martial interpretation. Heroic frameworks valorize spiritual combat against forces of evil.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's peaceful recognition is replaced by aggressive spiritual warfare. The five wisdoms symbolized by the implements become weapons of destruction.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner adopts confrontational attitude toward experience. The teaching that recognition dissolves fixation without conflict is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [AGGRESSION ERROR] and [DUALISTIC ERROR].
[12665-12674] 
[REIFICATION ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Three days" (zhag gsum) is understood as literal three-day period rather than symbolic indication of time needed for recognition to mature.
WHY IT ARISES:
Temporal markers trigger chronological reading. The need for measurable practice periods supports literalization.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes time-based rather than recognition-based. The timeless nature of recognition is obscured by temporal framework.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner waits for time to pass rather than recognizing immediately. The teaching that time is also display of rig pa is missed.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [DURATION ERROR] and [FUTURIZATION ERROR].

[12675-12689] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The crystal stupa, silver mirrors, and jewel staircase are understood as actual architectural features of a pure land to be visualized.
WHY IT ARISES:
Rich descriptive imagery triggers visualization practice. Tantric preliminary practices condition literal interpretation of symbols.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Generation stage (bskyed rim) visualization replaces Dzogchen recognition. The pointing to the structure of bar do experience becomes complex visualization.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner exhausts themselves in elaborate visualization rather than simple recognition. The spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is replaced by constructed imagery.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GENERATION STAGE ERROR] and [CONSTRUCTION ERROR].
---
[12690-12698] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "jewel house with eight doors" is interpreted as an actual dwelling place or palace to be entered or achieved.
WHY IT ARISES:
Architectural metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The desire for a stable place supports reification.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The eight doors of spontaneous display (lhun grub) become eight entrances to a palace. The teaching on the eight modes of appearance is lost.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about reaching or entering rather than recognizing what already displays. The immanence of realization is obscured.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SPATIALIZATION ERROR] and [ATTAINMENT ERROR].
---
[12699-12705] 
[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
Riding sunbeams, wearing rainbow garments, and carrying crystal spears are understood as actual siddhis or magical powers to be achieved.
WHY IT ARISES:
Magical imagery triggers siddhi-seeking. The desire for extraordinary powers supports literal reading.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's simple recognition is replaced by pursuit of magical abilities. The symbolic language pointing to direct experience becomes goal-oriented practice.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner becomes distracted by magical thinking. The teaching that the path is recognition, not acquisition, is entirely lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SIDDHI-SEEKING ERROR] and [ACQUISITION ERROR].
[12706-12718] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The symbolic correspondences—"Field Broad is samsara," "mud is body, speech, and mind"—are treated as poetic metaphors without technical meaning.
WHY IT ARISES:
Correspondence lists suggest allegorical reading. The distinction between technical terminology and poetic language is not recognized.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The precise Dzogchen anatomy being taught is dismissed as poetic fancy. Technical terms become literary devices.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader remains ignorant of how the narrative encodes instructions for recognizing the bar do. The practical guidance is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [POETICIZATION ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].
---
[12719-12728] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The parents sending children to two different realms is interpreted as parental abandonment or bad parenting rather than teaching on the two aspects of appearance.
WHY IT ARISES:
Family narrative triggers psychological/parenting interpretation. Modern family values influence reading of ancient symbolic text.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on dbyings snang (expanse appearance) and thig le (sphere) as two modes of rig pa's display is entirely missed.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader judges the narrative morally rather than recognizing its technical content. The pointing to the two lamps of bar do instruction is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MORALISTIC ERROR] and [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR].
---
[12729-12742] 
[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Not listening to instructions" is understood as moral failure of disobedience rather than indicating how dull faculties fixate on appearance.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Not listening" suggests moral fault. Ethical frameworks interpret narrative events as moral lessons.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The technical teaching about dbang po rtul ba (dull faculties) and fixation on appearance is replaced by moral exhortation to obey.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops guilt-based practice rather than understanding cognitive processes. The pointing to habitual fixation patterns is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MORALISTIC ERROR] and [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR].
---
[12743-12754] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The three messengers (mi gsum) and their journey is understood as literal travel narrative rather than pointing to the three baskets (sde snod gsum) of teachings.
WHY IT ARISES:
Travel narrative triggers geographical reading. The concrete imagery of journey obscures symbolic reference.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The three baskets as aspects of the path become a travel story. The integration of scripture, reasoning, and instruction is missed.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner misses how the three baskets serve as supports for recognition. The unity of the three vehicles is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR] and [FRAGMENTATION ERROR].
[12755-12767] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Four lamps" (sgron ma bzhi) are understood as actual light sources or visual phenomena to be cultivated in meditation.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Lamp" suggests illumination to develop. Meditative visualization practices condition this reading.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The four modes of intrinsic awareness are reduced to visual experiences. The technical meaning of the four lamps is entirely lost.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks light experiences rather than recognizing awareness-nature. Dzogchen recognition becomes light-based meditation.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [VISION-SEEKING ERROR] and [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR].
---
[12768-12777] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SPATIALIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "bar do of unarranged appearance" (yul ma bkod par snang ba) is interpreted as an actual intermediate state place between death and rebirth.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Bar do" commonly refers to after-death state. Popular Buddhist cosmology supports literal spatial interpretation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition that bar do is the nature of present experience is lost. Practice becomes preparation for future death rather than present recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner postpones recognition until death. The teaching that bar do is always displaying is entirely missed.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [FUTURIZATION ERROR] and [DEATH-ORIENTED ERROR].
---
[12778-12787] 
[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "jewel house" (rin po che'i khang pa) is understood as actual abode to reach or visualized pure land rather than spontaneous presence (lhun grub).
WHY IT ARISES:
"House" suggests dwelling place. Pure land visualization practices condition this interpretation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Spontaneous presence is externalized as destination. The teaching that lhun grub is the display of one's own nature is lost.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about reaching a place rather than recognizing what already is. The immanence of realization is obscured.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURE-LAND EXTERNALIZATION ERROR] and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].
---
[12788-12798] 
[SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The narrative of the five princes being imprisoned is understood as historical-political drama rather than teaching on how the five poisons bind rig pa.
WHY IT ARISES:
Political narrative triggers historical reading. The imagery of imprisonment suggests social oppression interpretation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The technical teaching about how afflictions (nyon mongs) bind awareness is replaced by political allegory. Dzogchen anatomy is lost.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they understand the "meaning" while remaining ignorant of the precise pointing to recognition of affliction's nature.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [POLITICIZATION ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].
[12799-12809] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Old woman" (rgan mo) representing ignorance is understood as misogynistic imagery rather than technical term for co-emergent ignorance.
WHY IT ARISES:
Gendered imagery triggers gender analysis. Modern sensitivity to sexist language supports this reading.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The technical Dzogchen term ma rig pa is obscured by gender analysis. The teaching on co-emergent ignorance becomes feminist critique.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader either dismisses text as sexist or attempts to redeem it through reinterpretation, missing the actual technical content entirely.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [IDEOLOGICAL ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].
---
[12810-12820] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "lineage not determined" (rus ma nges pa) is interpreted as social commentary on caste/class rather than teaching on the ground's neutrality.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Lineage" suggests social hierarchy. Contemporary concerns with social justice support this reading.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that the ground appears for both delusion and liberation is lost. Dzogchen ontology is replaced by social critique.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they are extracting "deeper meaning" while missing the surface-level technical instruction entirely.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SOCIOLOGICAL COLLAPSE ERROR] and [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].
---
[12821-12837] 
[SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR] [MORALISTIC ERROR]
MISREADING:
The narrative of killing the old woman and eating flesh, drinking blood is understood as literal violence or as endorsement of transgressive behavior.
WHY IT ARISES:
Violent imagery triggers moral outrage or fascination with transgression. Taboo-breaking suggests antinomian practice.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic language pointing to recognition without rejection (spang blang) is either dismissed as barbaric or literalized as license for harmful behavior.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader either rejects the teaching or adopts harmful practices. The middle way of recognition without acceptance/rejection is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ANTINOMIAN ERROR] or [MORALISTIC REJECTION ERROR].
---
[12838-12850] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Fire deity" (me lha) is understood as actual deity to be propitiated or visualized rather than symbol for self-recognizing wisdom.
WHY IT ARISES:
Deity names trigger deity yoga practice. Tantric preliminary training conditions deity-based interpretation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Self-recognizing wisdom is externalized as deity. The teaching that wisdom arises naturally when ignorance is recognized is lost.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner performs deity yoga rather than direct recognition. The unique Dzogchen approach is replaced by common tantric practice.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [DEITY EXTERNALIZATION ERROR] and [TANTRIC COLLAPSE ERROR].
[12851-12863] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Not even a hair was harmed" is understood as miraculous preservation or magical protection rather than teaching on the non-damage of recognition.
WHY IT ARISES:
Miraculous survival suggests magical power. The desire for protection supports this reading.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that rig pa cannot be harmed by delusion is replaced by belief in magical protection. Ontological safety becomes magical safety.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks magical protection rather than recognition. The imperturbable nature of awareness is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MIRACLE-SEEKING ERROR] and [REIFICATION ERROR].
---
[12864-12876] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"First did not depart" suggests that samsara and enlightenment are eternally fixed states with no possibility of change or transformation.
WHY IT ARISES:
"From the first" suggests eternal pre-existence. Essentialist frameworks interpret this as fixed nature.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Path and practice become meaningless. "Already enlightened" becomes excuse for non-practice while remaining in delusion.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner adopts "nothing to do" stance without recognition. The dynamic of recognition is replaced by static eternalism.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].
---
[12877-12892] 
[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The king's divination and sending away the queen is interpreted as misogynistic political narrative rather than teaching on how conceptual mind sends away pure awareness.
WHY IT ARISES:
Political narrative with gendered elements triggers social analysis. The king-queen power dynamic suggests gender critique.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on rgyu rkyen (cause and condition) and the conceptual mind's relationship to pure awareness is lost. Dzogchen becomes political commentary.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader focuses on gender/politics while missing the technical content. The bar do instructions encoded in the narrative remain unrecognized.

[12893-12906] 
[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
The queen's ornaments, fast horse, sharp weapons, etc. are understood as actual preparations for journey rather than twenty-one pointing-out instructions.
WHY IT ARISES:
Practical preparations suggest literal reading. The enumerated items suggest inventory or list.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The twenty-one pointing-out instructions (ngo sprod nyi shu rtsa gcig) are entirely missed. Technical Dzogchen content becomes travel narrative.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner reads the story without receiving the instructions. The practical guidance for bar do recognition is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [NARRATIVE ABSORPTION ERROR] and [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR].
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIOLENCE ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Kill all sentient beings" is understood as literal violence or as endorsement of actual killing for spiritual benefit.
WHY IT ARISES:
Literal reading of violent imagery. Either moral horror or antinomian fascination supports this interpretation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that killing means recognizing the nature of thoughts is either rejected as immoral or literalized as license for harm.
