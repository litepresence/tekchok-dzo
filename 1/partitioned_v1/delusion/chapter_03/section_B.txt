ERROR TYPE 1: [PRACTICE ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The ten stages (sa bcu) of the Bodhisattva path are understood as mandatory sequential progression that every practitioner must complete in order, rather than fluid descriptions of realization.
WHY IT ARISES:
Linear thinking. The practitioner wants clear roadmap. Stages suggest developmental psychology.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes stage-obsession. 'Which stage am I at?' replaces recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner compares themselves with others based on apparent 'stage.' Hierarchy develops.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PROGRESSION MYTH] and [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM]
ERROR TYPE 2: [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The practice of the six perfections is interpreted as requiring the accumulation of vast quantities of merit over countless lifetimes, making immediate recognition impossible.
WHY IT ARISES:
Quantitative thinking. The practitioner believes more merit = better result. 'Countless aeons' suggests temporal distance from goal.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is deferred to future lifetimes. The practitioner believes they are 'working toward' enlightenment.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Present moment availability of recognition is ignored. Practice becomes future-oriented accumulation.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY] and [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION]
ERROR TYPE 3: [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The bodhisattva vow to save all beings is interpreted as a literal commitment that creates overwhelming burden and guilt when the practitioner cannot accomplish it.
WHY IT ARISES:
Literal interpretation of metaphor. The practitioner takes vows as contractual obligations. Sense of duty creates anxiety.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner develops savior complex or guilt complex. 'I must save all beings' becomes crushing burden.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Burnout and despair. The impossibility of the task creates depression. Or, the practitioner claims impossible attainments.
CASCADE EFFECTS:

ERROR TYPE 4: [PRACTICE ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The emptiness teachings of the Prajnaparamita are interpreted as nihilistic denial of all phenomena, leading to dismissal of conventional practice and ethics.
WHY IT ARISES:
Nihilistic tendencies find confirmation in emptiness language. 'Form is emptiness' is taken as 'nothing exists.'
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner denies validity of all conventional practice. 'All is empty' becomes excuse for non-practice.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Ethics are dismissed as conventional. Harmful behavior is justified by 'emptiness.' Spiritual libertinism develops.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [SUTRA DISMISSAL]
ERROR TYPE 5: [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The perfection of wisdom is understood as an intellectual achievement requiring extensive study of Madhyamaka texts, rather than direct recognition of mind nature.
WHY IT ARISES:
Intellectual bias. The practitioner equates understanding with realization. Scholarly achievement signals competence.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Study replaces practice. The practitioner masters Chandrakirti without recognizing mind nature.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Scholastic pride develops. 'I understand emptiness' replaces 'I recognize rigpa.'
