ERROR TYPE 1: [VIEW COLLAPSE] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
Dzogchen is understood as the 'highest' vehicle that makes all other vehicles obsolete, encouraging immediate abandonment of foundational practices.
WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual ambition seeks supreme teaching. 'Atiyoga' suggests pinnacle. Marketing emphasizes 'direct path.'
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner abandons foundational practice for 'direct' methods without preparation.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dzogchen practice fails due to lack of foundation. The practitioner claims Dzogchen view while remaining ordinary.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] and [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM]
ERROR TYPE 2: [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The Dzogchen teaching of 'primordial liberation' (ye grol) is interpreted as meaning no practice is necessary because one is already enlightened.
WHY IT ARISES:
Laziness finds confirmation in 'already perfect.' Nihilistic tendencies interpret liberation as license.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner stops all practice. 'Already enlightened' becomes excuse for non-engagement.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Ordinary mind remains unexamined. The gap between claim and reality widens. Spiritual narcissism develops.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY]
ERROR TYPE 3: [PROGRESSION MYTH] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The space/depth (klong) classifications of Dzogchen are interpreted as metaphysical realities to be accessed or inhabited, rather than pedagogical descriptions.
WHY IT ARISES:
Metaphysical thinking seeks ultimate ground. 'Space of dharmata' suggests transcendent realm.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues 'entering the space' as goal. Meditative states are mistaken for realization.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spatial metaphors become reified. The practitioner talks about 'the space' as if it were a place.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]
ERROR TYPE 4: [VIEW COLLAPSE] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The Dzogchen distinction between mind (sems) and primordial wisdom (ye shes) is interpreted as establishing two different substances or entities.
WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic thinking creates categories. The distinction invites reification. The practitioner wants clear ontological categories.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues 'wisdom' as if it were a thing to acquire. Mind is rejected in favor of wisdom.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The non-dual nature of the distinction is missed. The practitioner oscillates between rejecting and pursuing mind.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR]
ERROR TYPE 5: [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition is interpreted as bypassing all gradual preparation, encouraging immediate advanced practice without foundation.
WHY IT ARISES:
Impatience and spiritual ambition. 'Direct' suggests faster. The practitioner wants to skip to the end.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts advanced practices without capacity. Recognition is claimed without substance.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes performative. The practitioner demonstrates ' Dzogchen view' as identity marker.
