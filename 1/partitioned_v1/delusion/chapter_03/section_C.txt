ERROR TYPE 1: [PRACTICE ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The mahayoga_anuyoga presentation is understood as establishing fixed ontological categories rather than pedagogical skillful means.
WHY IT ARISES:
Literal interpretation of teachings. The practitioner wants definitive truths. Religious traditions often posit metaphysical realities.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Categories become reified. The practitioner treats fluid descriptions as fixed realities.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Flexibility is lost. The practitioner forces experience into categorical boxes.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]
ERROR TYPE 2: [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
Systematic analysis of mahayoga_anuyoga is interpreted as requiring comprehensive intellectual mastery before practice can begin.
WHY IT ARISES:
Academic conditioning. The practitioner assumes knowledge precedes realization. Fear of missing important points.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Study replaces practice. The practitioner becomes expert without realization.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual pride develops. Recognition is deferred indefinitely.
CASCADE EFFECTS:

================================================================================
MISREADING:
The hierarchical presentation of mahayoga_anuyoga invites comparison and ranking of practitioners based on their apparent advancement.
WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner compares themselves with others. Judgment replaces compassion.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism develops around 'attainment.' Authentic practice is lost.

================================================================================
MISREADING:
Scriptural citations supporting mahayoga_anuyoga are taken as proof of absolute authority rather than skillful means for specific capacities.
WHY IT ARISES:
Fundamentalist tendencies seek certainty. Scriptural literalism is common in religious traditions.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Citations become weapons in debate. Living recognition is subordinated to textual authority.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Sectarianism develops. 'Buddha said so' ends inquiry.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] and [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM]
ERROR TYPE 5: [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
Detailed enumeration in mahayoga_anuyoga suggests exhaustive study is required, creating overwhelm and deferral of practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
Perfectionism and fear of missing out. Comprehensive catalogs invite systematic study.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner is overwhelmed by detail. Practice is deferred until 'mastery' is achieved.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Burnout or giving up. The impossibility of comprehensive knowledge creates despair.

Dzogchen is understood as the 'highest' vehicle that makes all other vehicles obsolete, encouraging immediate abandonment of foundational practices.
WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual ambition seeks supreme teaching. 'Atiyoga' suggests pinnacle. Marketing emphasizes 'direct path.'
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner abandons foundational practice for 'direct' methods without preparation.

WHY IT ARISES:
Laziness finds confirmation in 'already perfect.' Nihilistic tendencies interpret liberation as license.

The practitioner stops all practice. 'Already enlightened' becomes excuse for non-engagement.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues 'wisdom' as if it were a thing to acquire. Mind is rejected in favor of wisdom.

ERROR TYPE 1: [VIEW COLLAPSE] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
Dzogchen is understood as the 'highest' vehicle that makes all other vehicles obsolete, encouraging immediate abandonment of foundational practices.
WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual ambition seeks supreme teaching. 'Atiyoga' suggests pinnacle. Marketing emphasizes 'direct path.'
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner abandons foundational practice for 'direct' methods without preparation.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dzogchen practice fails due to lack of foundation. The practitioner claims Dzogchen view while remaining ordinary.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] and [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM]
ERROR TYPE 2: [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The Dzogchen teaching of 'primordial liberation' (ye grol) is interpreted as meaning no practice is necessary because one is already enlightened.
WHY IT ARISES:
Laziness finds confirmation in 'already perfect.' Nihilistic tendencies interpret liberation as license.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner stops all practice. 'Already enlightened' becomes excuse for non-engagement.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Ordinary mind remains unexamined. The gap between claim and reality widens. Spiritual narcissism develops.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY]
ERROR TYPE 3: [PROGRESSION MYTH] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The space/depth (klong) classifications of Dzogchen are interpreted as metaphysical realities to be accessed or inhabited, rather than pedagogical descriptions.
WHY IT ARISES:
Metaphysical thinking seeks ultimate ground. 'Space of dharmata' suggests transcendent realm.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues 'entering the space' as goal. Meditative states are mistaken for realization.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spatial metaphors become reified. The practitioner talks about 'the space' as if it were a place.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]
ERROR TYPE 4: [VIEW COLLAPSE] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The Dzogchen distinction between mind (sems) and primordial wisdom (ye shes) is interpreted as establishing two different substances or entities.
WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic thinking creates categories. The distinction invites reification. The practitioner wants clear ontological categories.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues 'wisdom' as if it were a thing to acquire. Mind is rejected in favor of wisdom.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The non-dual nature of the distinction is missed. The practitioner oscillates between rejecting and pursuing mind.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR]
ERROR TYPE 5: [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================
MISREADING:
The Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition is interpreted as bypassing all gradual preparation, encouraging immediate advanced practice without foundation.
WHY IT ARISES:
Impatience and spiritual ambition. 'Direct' suggests faster. The practitioner wants to skip to the end.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts advanced practices without capacity. Recognition is claimed without substance.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes performative. The practitioner demonstrates ' Dzogchen view' as identity marker.
