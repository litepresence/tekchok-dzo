[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Taking "dbyings kyi sgron ma" (lamp of space/dimension) as a metaphor for a vast container-like awareness that holds or contains phenomena.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Dbyings" (space/dimension) suggests vastness and containment. Students imagine awareness as a big space that experiences occur within.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness is spatialized into a container. The non-dual identity of awareness and appearance is replaced by the dualism of container and contained.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students visualize space or imagine vastness. The intimate immediacy of awareness is lost in pursuit of spaciousness.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of space visualization, then to ONTOLOGICAL spatial dualism, and finally to ETERNALISTIC view of awareness as cosmic container.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]
MISREADING:
Understanding the enumeration of lamps (five lamps, four lamps, etc.) as definitive taxonomies that describe the structure of reality.
WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerated lists suggest comprehensive classification systems. The scholarly mind assumes these are ontological categories.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Descriptive metaphors are treated as ontological realities. Students debate which lamp is which, missing that all are aspects of single recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes academic study of categories. Teachers write commentaries comparing classification systems.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with taxonomy, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of lists over recognition, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL fragmentation of unified nature.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Taking "zang thal" (naked/direct) as instruction to practice in a raw, unrefined, or spontaneous manner without method.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Zang thal" (naked/straight-through) suggests absence of elaboration. Students assume this means abandoning all structure and technique.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The subtle precision of natural meditation is replaced by sloppy "whatever happens" practice. Students mistake lack of discipline for directness.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice degenerates into wandering mind. Teachers cannot correct students who claim they are being "direct."
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PRACTICE collapse through lack of stability, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between delusion and naturalness, and finally to NIHILISTIC rejection of all method.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding "bsam gtan" (meditation/absorption) as referring to concentrated mental states or altered states of consciousness.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Bsam gtan" (dhyana) commonly refers to meditative absorption states. Students assume this means achieving special mental states.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural continuum of awareness is replaced by pursuit of altered states. Students seek absorption experiences rather than recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes state-dependent. Ordinary awareness is devalued while special states are sought.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of state achievement, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as altered states, and finally to REIFICATION of meditative experiences.

[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Taking "ye gdangs" (primordial resonance/sound) as an actual sound or audible phenomenon that one can hear with the ears.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Gdangs" (resonance/sound) naturally refers to audible sound. Students assume this means listening for inner sounds.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The expressive potency (gdangs) of awareness is reduced to auditory phenomena. Students strain to hear special sounds.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Tinnitus or imagined sounds are mistaken for realization. The metaphorical nature of "sound" as expression is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of sound listening, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between metaphor and phenomenon, and finally to REIFICATION of inner sounds.

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding "thig le" (bindu/dot) as a visualized sphere or ball of light that one focuses on during meditation.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Thig le" is commonly visualized as a sphere in tantric practice. Students automatically assume visualization technique.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual bindu (uniting emptiness and appearance) is reduced to a visual object. Practice becomes fixation on an imagined sphere.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students report size, color, and location of their bindu with pride. The essence of bindu is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of visualization, then to REIFICATION of bindu as object, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of observer and observed bindu.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Taking "nyams su blangs pa" (brought into experience) as deliberate cultivation of experiences or states of mind.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Nyams" (experience) and "blangs" (take up) suggest actively engaging with experiences. Students assume this means cultivating experiences.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural unfolding is replaced by deliberate experience-seeking. Students try to "have" experiences of realization.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes performance. Students report fabricated experiences to satisfy expectations.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of experience cultivation, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as state-seeking, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through inauthenticity.

[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]
MISREADING:
Understanding "ma bzung mi gnas" (not grasped, not abiding) as instruction to avoid any fixation or engagement, leading to dissociation.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Not grasped, not abiding" suggests letting go of everything. Students assume this means complete non-engagement with life.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The middle way is replaced by nihilistic dissociation. Students avoid relationships, responsibilities, and engagement.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Life becomes withdrawal. The integration of realization with compassionate activity is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC rejection of engagement, then to PRACTICE of withdrawal, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of practice vs. life.

[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Taking "shes rig" (knowing awareness) as two separate things - the knowing faculty and awareness - that must be unified.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Shes" (knowing) and "rig" (awareness) appear as two words. Students assume they refer to two distinct phenomena.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single nature of self-aware awareness is bifurcated into knower and awareness. Students search for the relationship between them.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Philosophical speculation replaces direct recognition. Teachers write treatises on shes-rig theory.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY analysis of terminology, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of knower and awareness, and finally to MEDITATIONISM of trying to unite them.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]
MISREADING:
Understanding the fourfold classification (nature, character, divisions, etc.) as a systematic presentation of the ontological structure of the lamp.
WHY IT ARISES:
Numbered categories suggest comprehensive analysis. The scholarly mind projects systematic philosophy onto the teaching.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct pointing is buried under elaborate analysis. Students study the fourfold system instead of recognizing the lamp.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes theoretical study. The simplicity of recognition is lost in complexity.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with structure, then to PEDAGOGICAL focus on categories, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of analytical divisions.

MISREADING:
Taking "gtad" (focus/fixation) as instruction to deliberately concentrate attention on specific points or objects.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Gtad" (to fix/set) suggests deliberate focusing. Students assume this means concentration practice.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural settling is replaced by forced concentration. Students develop tension through deliberate focusing.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Headaches and eye strain develop. The natural lucidity of awareness is obscured by effort.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of concentration technique, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between fixation and recognition, and finally to PRACTICE harm through physical strain.

[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Understanding "lhun grub" (spontaneous presence) as a state of perfection or divine order that exists eternally and must be accessed.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Spontaneous presence" suggests something already complete and perfect. Students assume this is a transcendent state they must reach.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The spontaneity of immediate experience is replaced by seeking a special state of perfection. Students feel inadequate to the "spontaneous."
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes aspiration toward an ideal. The ordinariness of natural perfection is rejected.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC view of transcendent perfection, then to MEDITATIONISM of aspiring to the spontaneous, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of ordinary vs. perfect.

MISREADING:
Taking "kun gzhi" (all-basis/alaya) as a universal substrate or cosmic storehouse consciousness that contains all phenomena.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Kun" (all) and "gzhi" (basis) suggest a universal ground. Students imagine a cosmic storage system for all experiences.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The neutral basis of delusion is reified into a cosmic consciousness. The distinction between kun gzhi and dharmakaya is blurred.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students develop mystical views about a universal mind. The path of distinguishing pure from impure basis is obscured.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC view of cosmic consciousness, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between basis and nature, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of universal mind theories.

MISREADING:
Understanding the distinction between "kun gzhi" and "chos sku" (dharmakaya) as a philosophical problem to be solved through conceptual analysis.
WHY IT ARISES:
The teaching presents a distinction that requires clarification. The scholarly mind assumes this is an intellectual problem.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct recognition is replaced by philosophical analysis. Students debate the relationship between basis and nature.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes study of philosophical distinctions. The simplicity of distinguishing pure from impure recognition is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with kun gzhi theory, then to PEDAGOGICAL focus on intellectual clarity, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of the distinction itself.

Taking "ma rig pa" (ignorance) as something to be eliminated through effort, like removing a stain from cloth.
WHY IT ARISES:
Ignorance is commonly understood as something negative to be removed. Students assume practice means getting rid of it.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The self-liberated nature of ignorance is missed. Practice becomes struggle against an enemy.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students develop aversion to their own confusion. The recognition that confusion is groundless is obscured.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Bag chags" resembles modern concepts of conditioning and habit formation. Students psychologize these tendencies.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The imprints of delusion are treated as psychological baggage. Practice becomes therapy or self-analysis.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students focus on their "issues" rather than recognizing nature. Endless processing replaces direct recognition.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as depth psychology, then to MEDITATIONISM of working through patterns, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of imprints.

[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]
MISREADING:
Taking "chos sku" (dharmakaya) as complete non-existence or voidness, interpreting "beyond mind" as meaning absolutely nothing.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Las 'das pa" (beyond/transcending) suggests going beyond existence. Combined with "empty," this leads to nihilistic interpretation.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The luminous aspect of dharmakaya is dismissed. Practice becomes lifeless negation.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students celebrate emptiness as nothingness. The union of emptiness and appearance is lost.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Self-arisen" suggests autonomous creative power. Students imagine a self-existent generator.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The lack of inherent existence is replaced by belief in inherent spontaneous generation. Dharmakaya becomes a creator.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students worship spontaneous presence as divine. The emptiness of all phenomena is forgotten.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC theism, then to ONTOLOGICAL reification of spontaneous presence, and finally to SCHOLARLY construction of Dzogchen theology.
