[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Taking "chos nyid" (dharmata/reality) as a metaphysical essence or ultimate truth that exists independently.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Reality" suggests something true and existent. Students assume this is a metaphysical entity.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The empty nature of dharmata is reified into an ultimate reality. Students believe in truly existent truth.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes metaphysics. The recognition that dharmata is ungraspable is obscured.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC view of absolute reality, then to MEDITATIONISM of truth-seeking, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL substantialism.

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding "man ngag" (oral instruction/pith) as secret techniques requiring formal transmission rituals.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Oral instruction" suggests special teachings. Students assume these require elaborate initiations.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct pointing is replaced by ritual transmission. Students believe they lack the necessary empowerments.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes initiation-seeking. The simplicity of recognition is obscured by complexity.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL institutionalization, then to MEDITATIONISM of ritual practice, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of transmission.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Taking "bsgom" (meditate/cultivate) as deliberate mental fabrication or imagination practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Cultivate" suggests deliberate development. Students assume this means making something happen.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural meditation is replaced by fabrication. Students deliberately create experiences.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes imagination. The unfabricated nature is obscured by deliberate creation.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of visualization, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between fabricated and natural, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through artificiality.

[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]
MISREADING:
Understanding "med pa" (non-existence/absence) in the context of emptiness as meaning complete nothingness or void.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Non-existence" naturally suggests absence. Students assume emptiness means nothing is real.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The luminous aspect of emptiness is dismissed. Practice becomes nihilistic negation.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students devalue all appearance. The middle way is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC view, then to MEDITATIONISM of blank mind, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL denial of appearance.

[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Taking "phyag rgya chen po" (mahamudra/great seal) as a specific meditation technique or advanced practice system.
WHY IT ARISES:
Mahamudra is commonly taught as a system with techniques. Students assume this is a practice method.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The nature of all phenomena is reduced to a technique. Students practice "doing" mahamudra.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes method-obsession. The seal that is already present is obscured by seeking.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of technique, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of practicer and practice, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of methods over nature.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]
MISREADING:
Understanding the distinction between "dzogchen" and "mahamudra" as referring to two different paths or competing systems.
WHY IT ARISES:
Different names suggest different things. Students assume these are competing traditions.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of recognition is fragmented into sectarian comparison. Students debate which is superior.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes tradition-identification. The nature beyond labels is obscured by affiliation.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY sectarianism, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of distinctions, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of traditions.

Lines 00036-00045
[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Taking "bshad pa" (explanation/teaching) as intellectual study rather than pointing to direct recognition.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Explanation" suggests information transfer. Students assume studying explanations is practice.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Pointing instructions are treated as academic subjects. Students accumulate knowledge about recognition without recognizing.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes study. The distinction between knowing about and knowing directly is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY accumulation, then to PEDAGOGICAL information transfer, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between concept and reality.

Lines 00046-00058
[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding "nyams" (experience/taste) as referring to subjective emotional or psychological states.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Experience" suggests subjective feeling. Students psychologize spiritual experiences.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The direct encounter with nature is reduced to subjective feeling. Students chase emotional states.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes emotion-seeking. The emptiness of experience is obscured by pursuit.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as emotionalism, then to MEDITATIONISM of state-seeking, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL subjectivism.
