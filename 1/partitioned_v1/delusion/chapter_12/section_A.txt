[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The bindus falling at the life-channel during pressing and the mixing of wind and light rays are specific techniques to be performed to generate visionary experiences.
WHY IT ARISES:
Technical physiological descriptions suggest procedural instructions. Western achievement-oriented frameworks seek techniques to produce results.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes technique-driven practice focused on manipulating subtle body elements to force visions, rather than natural self-display of rigpa.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops obsession with "pressing" and physiological manipulation. Five lights become goal to achieve rather than self-arising display.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].

[16745-16756] 
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [LITERALISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The similes of peacock tail, vulture eye, fish eye, and cat eye describe literal anatomical structures or optical phenomena in the physical eyes.
WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative language suggests physical correspondence. Scientific materialist frameworks seek concrete anatomical correlates.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Four lamps are reduced to ophthalmological phenomena or retinal biology. Visionary experience becomes explainable as physical optics.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner examines own eyes seeking peacock-tail patterns or cat-eye reflections. Natural meditative experience is dismissed if not matching descriptions.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MEDICALIZATION ERROR] and [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

[16757-16782] 
[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The blue five-petaled bindu with light-rim is an actual entity or structure located in the subtle body that can be found and observed.
WHY IT ARISES:
Detailed spatial descriptions suggest objective location. Substantialist frameworks interpret all references as pointing to existing things.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
"Lamp of pure sphere" is objectified as subtle body organ or chakra to be visualized or located. Rigpa is confused with bindu-appearance.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner searches for "snake-noose fence" in body or visual field. The metaphorical description becomes literal map to be followed.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[16778-16782] 
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Whoever familiarizes" suggests that through repeated practice and familiarization, one can stabilize this vision and make it permanent.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Familiarization" (*goms*) interpreted as habituation or training. Psychological frameworks emphasize learning and conditioning.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition becomes skill to be developed through repetition. "Unfabricated essence" is pursued through deliberate fabrication.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner accumulates "familiarization time" believing quantity produces quality. Natural state is confused with conditioned attainment.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] and [ETERNALISTIC ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Treating "rig pa'i rang yul" (awareness's own object) as a separate object that awareness grasps, rather than the self-appearing nature of awareness itself.
WHY IT ARISES:
Habitual dualistic perception assumes a subject-object structure where awareness must have something "out there" that it knows. The phrase "rang yul" triggers this dualistic reflex.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness becomes reified as a subject confronting an object, destroying the non-dual recognition that rigpa is self-illuminating without subject-object bifurcation.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner searches for an object of meditation rather than recognizing the nature of the searcher. Practice becomes object-oriented seeking rather than self-recognition.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to EPISTEMIC delusion of thinking one must "find" awareness, then to MEDITATIONISM of trying to stabilize a subject-object experience, and finally to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through endless conceptual analysis of awareness-object relations.

[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]
MISREADING:
Interpreting "rang bzhin med par snang bar byed" (makes appear as without nature) as meaning appearances are completely non-existent or illusory in a nihilistic sense.
WHY IT ARISES:
The term "rang bzhin med" (without nature/self-nature) triggers associations with emptiness as voidness or non-existence rather than emptiness as luminous appearance without inherent existence.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner devalues appearance, seeing it as merely false or unreal, missing that the very lack of inherent nature IS the miraculous display.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes nihilistic negation rather than recognition of appearance-emptiness union. The vividness of experience is suppressed.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL failure where students are taught to dismiss experience, then to PRACTICE collapse through dissociative meditation, and finally to NIHILISTIC view denying the validity of appearance entirely.
---
Lines 00021-00035
[EPISTEMIC, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Taking the threefold division of "gzhi, lam, 'bras bu" (ground, path, fruit) as describing three separate sequential stages or ontological states that exist independently.
WHY IT ARISES:
Linear temporal thinking projects progressive development onto the teaching. The numbered list structure suggests discrete categories rather than three aspects of a single nature.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is understood as a gradual path with distinct stages to traverse, contradicting the teaching that ground, path, and fruit are simultaneously present.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner fixates on "progressing" through stages rather than recognizing what is already complete. Ground becomes distant, path becomes effortful, fruit becomes future.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of stage-focused practice, then to REIFICATION of the three as fixed categories, and finally to ETERNALISTIC view of a truly existent progression toward enlightenment.

Lines 00036-00038
[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding "dgongs pa" (intention/realization) as a mental state or psychological experience that one enters into, like a meditative absorption.
WHY IT ARISES:
The word "dgongs pa" is commonly used for mental intention or thought. Its technical Dzogchen meaning as the spontaneous wisdom-intention of the ground is obscured by familiar usage.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound spontaneously arisen wisdom is reduced to a mental state that can be produced through effort, missing that it is the nature of mind itself.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about inducing experiences rather than recognition. The natural state is sought as an altered state.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of experience-generation, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of the path as therapy or self-improvement, and finally to EPISTEMIC delusion of confusing recognition with experience.
Lines 00001-00014
[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Taking "ka dag dang lhun grub gnyis su med pa" (primordial purity and spontaneous presence non-dual) as describing two things that merge or become one, rather than one nature with two aspects.
WHY IT ARISES:
Grammatical structure suggests two entities ("gnyis") that are "med" (without), leading to the interpretation that they were dual and now are unified.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The inseparability of emptiness and appearance is misunderstood as a synthesis of opposites, missing that they have never been separate.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner alternates between analytic meditation on emptiness and visualization practice, failing to recognize their simultaneous presence in every moment.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of alternating practices, then to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through philosophical attempts to explain the synthesis, and finally to ETERNALISTIC view of an ultimately existent union.

Lines 00015-00027
[REIFICATION, EPISTEMIC]
MISREADING:
Treating the description of outer space ("phyi 'od kyi dbyings") as a reference to physical outer space or the sky that one should visualize or focus upon.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Nam mkha'" (space/sky) naturally refers to physical space in common usage. The technical Dzogchen usage as a metaphor for the empty-yet-luminous nature of mind requires specific transmission.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice degenerates into sky-gazing meditation focused on outer phenomena rather than recognizing inner space. The metaphor becomes the reality.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students spend hours staring at the sky or visualizing space, missing that these are pointers to the nature of their own awareness.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of technique fixation, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between outer and inner, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL failure as teachers emphasize technique over recognition.
---
Lines 00028-00048
[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Understanding the progressive description of meditation (from mirror-like to body visions) as stages one must deliberately cultivate or force to arise.
WHY IT ARISES:
The sequential description ("dang po...de nas...") suggests a developmental process. Students feel they must make progress through these stages through effort.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural unfolding is replaced by achievement-oriented striving. The practitioner manipulates experience to produce signs of progress.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Frustration arises when visions don't unfold as described. Fake experiences may be reported. The natural clarity is obscured by manipulation.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to EPISTEMIC delusion of confusing fabricated experience with genuine recognition, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of the path as personal achievement, and finally to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through rationalizing why practice "isn't working."
---
Lines 00049-00062
[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Taking "mthong dang goms pa'i ye shes" (wisdom of seeing and habituating) as two different wisdoms or types of knowledge that one develops.
WHY IT ARISES:
The conjunction "dang" (and) suggests two distinct items. Students think they must first develop "seeing wisdom" then separately develop "habituation wisdom."
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of recognition and stabilization is split into sequential achievements. Habituation is misunderstood as prolonged exposure to an experience rather than deepening recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice alternates between "insight sessions" and "stabilization sessions," failing to integrate them. The natural continuity of awareness is disrupted.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of session-based practice, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of insight vs. calm, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of split practices.
Lines 00001-00020
[MEDITATIONISM, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Taking the precise anatomical instructions ("sna rtse las smin mtshams kyi yar mtshams") as literal physical directions for where to place attention, rather than metaphorical descriptions of inner vision.
WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed spatial language (nose tip, eyebrow center, four finger-widths) suggests a physical technique. Students want concrete instructions they can follow.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes fixated on physical posture and precise measurements, turning the profound into mechanical technique. The inner vision is reduced to eye exercises.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students strain their eyes, develop headaches, or become obsessed with correct "position." The natural arising of inner light is suppressed by forced concentration.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between physical and visionary, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of techniques over recognition, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through physical strain.

Lines 00021-00035
[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Understanding "longs sku" (enjoyment body) as an actual form or body that appears to the practitioner during meditation, a truly existent vision.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Sku" (body) naturally refers to physical form. The term "longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku" (complete enjoyment body) suggests something tangible and beautiful that one experiences.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The illusory nature of visionary appearance is missed. Students report "seeing deities" as if these were objectively present, reifying the kayas.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism enters practice. Visions are sought after, compared, and boasted about. The empty nature of all appearance is forgotten.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of visionary experiences, then to ETERNALISTIC view of truly existent kayas, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL harm as teachers validate students' visions.
---
Lines 00036-00049
[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]
MISREADING:
Taking the detailed numerical correspondences ("skad cig ma ni bcu drug la" - sixteen moments) as precise temporal measurements for calculating meditation progress.
WHY IT ARISES:
Numbers suggest quantifiable precision. Students want measurable progress markers. The scholarly mind latches onto numerical systems.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching is reduced to a mathematical system. Students try to calculate their progress: "I've completed 12 of 16 moments." Recognition is replaced by accounting.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes rigid and formulaic. The spontaneous nature of realization is constrained by numerical expectations.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of structured technique, then to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through endless analysis of numerical systems, and finally to PRACTICE collapse when reality doesn't match calculations.

Lines 00050-00052
[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]
MISREADING:
Understanding "lus zad pa'i sar phyin" (reaching the place of body's exhaustion) as meaning the physical body literally dissolves or disappears.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Zad pa" (exhaustion/cessation) suggests something ending. Combined with "lus" (body), this naturally suggests physical dissolution or death.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Students may develop fear of physical death or, conversely, desire for out-of-body experiences. The metaphorical meaning (exhaustion of fixation on body) is missed.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dangerous practices may be attempted. The integration of realization with embodied existence is disrupted.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC view of body as obstacle, then to PRACTICE of dissociative techniques, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of mind vs. body.
Lines 00001-00009
[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Taking "'od lnga" (five lights) as referring to five specific colored lights that one should look for or visualize during practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
The number five and the term "lights" suggest concrete visual phenomena. Students want to know: "What are the five colors? What should I see?"
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural radiance of awareness is reduced to color visualization. Students strain to see specific colors, missing that light is a metaphor for the clarity aspect of mind.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes fixation on visual phenomena. Students report seeing lights with pride or frustration when they don't appear.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of visualization technique, then to REIFICATION of light as objective phenomenon, and finally to EPISTEMIC confusion between metaphor and reality.
---
Lines 00010-00033
[EPISTEMIC, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Taking the progressive stages (mirror-like mandala → piece → area → sky-filling) as a curriculum one must deliberately develop through graduated practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
The sequence suggests development from simple to complex. Educational conditioning projects curriculum structure onto the description.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural unfolding of recognition is replaced by progressive achievement. Each stage becomes a milestone to reach through effort.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students feel inadequate if they don't experience the stages. Teachers design curricula to "produce" the stages artificially.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL institutionalization of stages, then to MEDITATIONISM of stage-focused practice, and finally to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of realization as developmental achievement.
---
Lines 00034-00050
[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding the three locations ("gzhi'i dbyings tsitta, lam gyi dbyings 'briguta, 'bras bu rang shar gyi dbyings") as three different psychological states or levels of consciousness.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Dbyings" (space/dimension) and terms like "citta" suggest psychological categories. Modern students naturally psychologize these terms.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ontological dimensions of ground, path, and fruit are reduced to psychological experiences. Dzogchen becomes a system of mental states.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice focuses on achieving altered states rather than recognizing nature. The transcendent dimension is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of the entire path, then to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through academic analysis of Dzogchen psychology, and finally to PRACTICE collapse as students chase experiences.
---
Lines 00051-00058
[REIFICATION, EPISTEMIC]
MISREADING:
Taking "mig nas 'char" (arising from the eye) as referring to the physical eye organ as the source of vision, understanding the teaching as eye-based meditation.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Mig" (eye) naturally refers to the physical organ. The technical Dzogchen meaning of the "wisdom eye" or the gateway of appearance is not obvious.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes fixation on eye-based techniques: open-eye meditation, staring exercises, or eye-position manipulation.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The recognition that appearance arises from the nature of mind is obscured. Students believe the physical eye creates vision.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of eye technique, then to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of vision, and finally to SCHOLARLY debate about eye vs. mind as source.
Lines 00001-00020
[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Taking "rig pa'i sgron ma" (lamp of awareness) as a metaphor for an actual illuminating presence or entity called "awareness" that functions like a lamp.
WHY IT ARISES:
The metaphor "lamp" naturally suggests an illuminating object. Students personify awareness as something that "lights up" experiences.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness is reified as a thing with the function of illumination, missing that awareness and appearance are inseparable, not agent and object.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students search for "the aware part" of their experience, creating a subtle duality between the "awareness" and what it illuminates.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of awareness, then to ETERNALISTIC view of truly existent consciousness, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of awareness vs. appearance.

Lines 00021-00038
[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]
MISREADING:
Understanding the detailed technical vocabulary ("srog sgron, shes sgron, rtsa sgron, thig le sgron") as referring to distinct esoteric techniques requiring precise execution.
WHY IT ARISES:
Specialized terminology suggests specialized knowledge. The scholarly mind assumes these are technical terms for advanced practices.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The simple recognition of natural mind is buried under technical complexity. Students feel they need to master vocabulary before they can practice.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes academic study of terminology. Teachers compete to display mastery of technical language.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through endless commentary, then to PEDAGOGICAL focus on terminology over recognition, and finally to MEDITATIONISM of technique obsession.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Taking "goms tshul" (manner of habituation) as instructions for how to deliberately train or condition the mind through repeated practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Goms" (habituate) suggests training or conditioning. Students understand this as behavioral conditioning to create new habits.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural recognition is replaced by deliberate conditioning. Students think they must "practice until it becomes automatic."
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes mechanical repetition. The spontaneous nature of realization is obscured by effortful training.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of repetitive technique, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as behavioral modification, and finally to PRACTICE burnout from excessive repetition.

Lines 00051-00058
[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding "sgron ma 'bar ba" (blazing lamp) as a state of heightened intensity or peak experience that one should cultivate.
WHY IT ARISES:
"'Bar ba" (blaze/burn) suggests intensity and power. Students seek dramatic experiences that feel "blazing."
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ordinary nature of mind is rejected in favor of seeking intense experiences. Students mistake intensity for profundity.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes excitement-seeking. Natural calm is seen as inferior to dramatic visions or intense clarity.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of intensity-seeking, then to REIFICATION of "blazing" as truly existent state, and finally to PRACTICE collapse when intensity fades.
Lines 00001-00019
[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]
MISREADING:
Taking "stong gsal" (empty-clear) to mean that clarity is empty in the sense of non-existent or absent, rather than empty of inherent existence while manifestly clear.
WHY IT ARISES:
The compound "stong gsal" is often simplified to "empty yet clear," leading to the interpretation that clarity is somehow negated by emptiness.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The luminous nature of mind is dismissed as illusory or unreal. Practice becomes dry intellectualism devoid of vividness.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students develop aversion to experience, seeing clarity as the enemy of emptiness. The union of appearance-emptiness is lost.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC view of appearance, then to MEDITATIONISM of blank absorption, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of emptiness vs. clarity.

[REIFICATION, EPISTEMIC]
MISREADING:
Understanding "rtsa sgron" (channel lamp) as referring to physical channels in the body that conduct subtle energy, treating it as instruction for subtle body practice.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Rtsa" (channel/nadi) commonly refers to the subtle body's energy channels. Students familiar with yoga/tantra assume this refers to the same thing.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching is reduced to physical yoga. Students practice breath retention and energy movement, missing the direct recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Physical tension and strain develop. The natural flow of energy is blocked by manipulation.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of energy work, then to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of subtle body, and finally to PRACTICE harm through forced techniques.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]
MISREADING:
Taking the enumeration "goms pa'i tshad" (measure of habituation) as quantitative metrics for assessing meditation progress or quality.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Tshad" (measure) suggests quantification. Modern minds seek measurable outcomes and progress indicators.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The immeasurable nature of realization is forced into quantitative categories. Students rate their practice on imaginary scales.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes competitive and goal-oriented. Natural recognition is disrupted by constant self-assessment.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with classification, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as self-assessment, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through performance anxiety.

Lines 00046-00058
[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Understanding "ye shes sku" (wisdom body) as an actual form or body made of wisdom substance that one develops or attains.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Sku" (body) suggests physical form. "Ye shes" (primordial wisdom) suggests something powerful and precious. Combined, they suggest a divine body.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The formless nature of dharmakaya is replaced by fixation on developing a special body. Students imagine themselves transforming into wisdom-beings.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism intensifies. The emptiness of all form is forgotten in pursuit of the "wisdom body."
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of the kayas, then to ETERNALISTIC view of truly existent wisdom body, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of deity yoga instead of recognition.
Lines 00001-00020
[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]
MISREADING:
Taking "rang rig" (self-awareness) as referring to self-consciousness or self-knowledge in the psychological sense of self-concept or self-reflection.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Rang" (self) and "rig" (aware/know) naturally suggest self-knowledge or self-awareness as understood in psychology and common parlance.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The reflexive nature of awareness knowing itself is reduced to introspection or self-analysis. Students look within for a self that knows itself.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes self-observation or self-monitoring. The natural reflexivity of awareness is replaced by deliberate self-consciousness.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as introspection, then to MEDITATIONISM of self-monitoring technique, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between awareness and ego.

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding the fivefold classification of wisdom (shes rab) as five separate wisdoms that one must develop individually and sequentially.
WHY IT ARISES:
The number five and the word "dbye ba" (division) suggest distinct categories. Students assume they must cultivate each wisdom separately.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single nature of wisdom manifesting in five aspects is fragmented into separate achievements. Practice becomes checklist-oriented.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students feel inadequate if they haven't "developed" all five wisdoms. Teachers create curricula for "wisdom development."
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL fragmentation, then to MEDITATIONISM of separate practices for each wisdom, and finally to SCHOLARLY obsession with classification systems.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Taking "so sor rtog pa'i shes rab" (analytical wisdom) as instruction to intellectually analyze phenomena during meditation.
WHY IT ARISES:
"So sor rtog pa" (individual analysis) suggests analytical investigation. Students assume this means thinking about phenomena during practice.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct recognition is replaced by discursive analysis. Students mentally categorize experiences rather than recognizing their nature.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation becomes thinking practice. The non-conceptual nature of wisdom is obscured by conceptual analysis.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY meditation on concepts, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between concept and reality, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through overthinking.

Lines 00046-00058
[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]
MISREADING:
Understanding "rang shar" (self-arisen) to mean that phenomena arise automatically or spontaneously as if produced by a hidden mechanism or power.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Self-arisen" suggests automatic production without apparent cause. Students imagine a hidden spontaneous generation mechanism.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The lack of inherent causation is misunderstood as mysterious auto-generation. Students seek the "mechanism" of spontaneous arising.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice focuses on "letting things happen spontaneously" rather than recognition. Deliberate action is rejected as unnatural.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC rejection of causation, then to ETERNALISTIC view of spontaneous generation power, and finally to PRACTICE of passive inaction.
Lines 00001-00020
[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
Taking "dbyings kyi sgron ma" (lamp of space/dimension) as a metaphor for a vast container-like awareness that holds or contains phenomena.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Dbyings" (space/dimension) suggests vastness and containment. Students imagine awareness as a big space that experiences occur within.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness is spatialized into a container. The non-dual identity of awareness and appearance is replaced by the dualism of container and contained.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students visualize space or imagine vastness. The intimate immediacy of awareness is lost in pursuit of spaciousness.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of space visualization, then to ONTOLOGICAL spatial dualism, and finally to ETERNALISTIC view of awareness as cosmic container.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]
MISREADING:
Understanding the enumeration of lamps (five lamps, four lamps, etc.) as definitive taxonomies that describe the structure of reality.
WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerated lists suggest comprehensive classification systems. The scholarly mind assumes these are ontological categories.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Descriptive metaphors are treated as ontological realities. Students debate which lamp is which, missing that all are aspects of single recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes academic study of categories. Teachers write commentaries comparing classification systems.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with taxonomy, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of lists over recognition, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL fragmentation of unified nature.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]
MISREADING:
Taking "zang thal" (naked/direct) as instruction to practice in a raw, unrefined, or spontaneous manner without method.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Zang thal" (naked/straight-through) suggests absence of elaboration. Students assume this means abandoning all structure and technique.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The subtle precision of natural meditation is replaced by sloppy "whatever happens" practice. Students mistake lack of discipline for directness.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice degenerates into wandering mind. Teachers cannot correct students who claim they are being "direct."
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PRACTICE collapse through lack of stability, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between delusion and naturalness, and finally to NIHILISTIC rejection of all method.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]
MISREADING:
Understanding "bsam gtan" (meditation/absorption) as referring to concentrated mental states or altered states of consciousness.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Bsam gtan" (dhyana) commonly refers to meditative absorption states. Students assume this means achieving special mental states.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural continuum of awareness is replaced by pursuit of altered states. Students seek absorption experiences rather than recognition.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes state-dependent. Ordinary awareness is devalued while special states are sought.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of state achievement, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as altered states, and finally to REIFICATION of meditative experiences.
