[192-205] Longchenpa now quotes from the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra: "Great hero, skilled in skillful-means, for the complete ripening of sentient-beings, though becoming Buddha ten-million times, still you guide, O Teacher, demonstrating many Buddhas." Listen to this! The Buddha isn't someone who achieved enlightenment once and now rests in glory. From the perspective of absolute truth, the Buddha manifests countless times in countless forms for the benefit of beings. And here's the secret: your own awareness has this same capacity. When you recognize rigpa, you become an expression of this same enlightened activity.
The Flower Ornament Sutra continues this theme: "Having attained the ocean of supreme enlightenment, for the complete ripening of the ocean of sentient-beings, demonstrating the ocean of bodhicitta generation..." Notice the repetition of "ocean"—this is describing the vastness, the boundlessness of enlightened activity. It's not a finite thing that gets used up. It's inexhaustible, like the nature of awareness itself.
[206-217] Now comes a detailed account of how Samantabhadra manifested in this Fortunate Eon. Don't get distracted by the names and numbers! This is describing the continuity of the teaching, how the recognition of awareness has been transmitted through time. The first mind-generation—offering a golden vajra to Buddha Flower-Great-Beauty—symbolizes the commitment to recognize one's own nature.
The various births described (as Jewel-Garland, as Lightning-Light, demonstrating Buddhahood at seventy-five years) are showing the path of gradual awakening. But remember—in Dzogchen, this gradual path is ultimately unnecessary. It's skillful means for those who need it. The direct recognition can happen instantly, without going through all these stages. The stages are described for those who benefit from a gradual approach, not because they're ultimately necessary.
The description of thirty-six self-arisen tantras arising from light-rays, the sixty complete perfections, countless Buddha-bodies—this is describing the richness of the display when awareness recognizes itself. From the tongue-faculty of the five-family Buddhas, immeasurable light radiates as the sound of the six syllables (OM MANI PADME HUM). This isn't mythology—it's a description of how mantra functions. The six syllables are the natural resonance of awareness itself.
[265-272] Listen! The teacher with five perfections: arising, abode, retinue, time, and body complete. Thus born as supreme perfection, in the field Perfection Rich, abode Perfection at Tushita, to retinue Perfection, gods with life. At the time Perfection when the six beings' views ripen. Teaching the unexcelled vehicle. Through accomplishing benefit for self and other, wheel of inexhaustible ornament body, speech, and mind.
[273-279] Thus also, among the thousand and two Buddhas of this good kalpa, at the time of those five perfections. The teacher was born at the royal palace. Abode Perfection at Tushita. Retinue Perfection, gods with life. Time Perfection when beings' views ripen. Teaching Perfection, three baskets and outside.
Dear practitioner, understand this! The Buddha does not just appear—he appears with perfect conditions. Five perfections complete! This shows you that enlightenment requires the right field, the right time, the right retinue. But do not think these are separate from you—your own mind has these five perfections primordially complete. Recognize this!
Emaho! Five perfections—complete in your own mind!
[249-254] "From offering a vajra as basis for mind-generation arose this." The vajra offering represents the indestructible commitment to recognize one's nature. When that commitment is pure, the body appears without fixed nature—accumulation pure, mind's great wisdom knows all aspects. This is describing the result of the path. In the time of Dharmakaya, when place, dharmasphere, object, and thought are all pure, Samantabhadra's natural activities are perfectly accomplished and abide. This isn't something to achieve in the future. It's describing how things already are from the perspective of awareness.
[255-258] "Upon one particle of retinue, particles-number Buddhas countless, with teaching actual nature, dzogchen dharma-nature vajra whoever—uncompounded." This is the fractal nature of reality in Dzogchen view. Every particle contains infinite Buddhas. Every moment contains infinite teachings. The Dzogchen dharma-nature is uncompounded—meaning it's not made of parts, not created through causes and conditions. It's the natural state, always already present.
[259-298] Now comes detailed lists of the activities of body, speech, and mind—outer, inner, and secret. Don't skim over these as mere catalogues! Each category is pointing to a different dimension of how awareness functions when recognized.
Body's outer activities: unchanging, uncoming, ungoing, non-abiding. This is describing the Dharmakaya body—it's not subject to change, doesn't come from anywhere, doesn't go anywhere, doesn't abide in any fixed location. Inner activities: non-appearing, non-doing, non-radiating, non-gathering. This is subtler—the body of enjoyment doesn't appear in the ordinary sense, doesn't do things in the ordinary sense, doesn't radiate or gather in the way physical things do. Secret activities: clear-open, even, loose, direct. These are the qualities of awareness itself—openness without obstruction, evenness without preference, looseness without fixation, directness without mediation.
Speech follows the same pattern—outer: inexpressible, unshowable, unseeable, unslightable (cannot be dismissed or diminished). Inner: natural, passing, objectless, nonplural. Secret: fresh, innate, natural, unfabricated. Mind's activities are listed as various samadhis—stainless, lion-display, hero-going, wish-fulfilling jewel pinnacle, victory-banner peak play, lightning garland, great wheel, light-blazing. These aren't different meditation techniques to master! They're different ways of describing the natural stability of awareness when it recognizes itself.
The key point throughout all of this: these aren't achievements. They're descriptions of what is already the case. Your awareness right now has all of these qualities. You just don't recognize it because you're too busy looking for something else.
[299-307] The text continues describing the activities of the enjoyment-complete body, or Sambhogakaya. Notice the phrase "Those also not the activity of meaning's agent, but called 'activity' through the arising of qualities' essence and radiance." This is crucial! The enlightened activities aren't something being done by someone. There's no agent, no doer. The activities are the natural radiance of awareness itself. Like how light naturally illuminates without a decision to do so, the qualities of enlightenment naturally manifest without anyone making them happen.
From the play of unobstructed radiance—the former appearances and the arising of compassion—the pure abodes are densely arranged. This is describing how the pure lands manifest. They're not somewhere else you go after you die. They're the dimension of richness that opens when awareness recognizes itself. From the gesture of the great ocean's teacher, from the lotus-pericarp's base, thirty-two realms appear with layered masses, varied colors and forms like water and moon. This is describing the mandala structure—not as a physical place, but as the architecture of awakened perception.
[308-316] The text describes various arrangements—like palace arrangements, like descending offering-feast houses, like infinite jewel-umbrella arrangements, like mutual grain-pile masses. Don't get lost in the imagery! These are descriptions of how the display of awareness organizes itself. The key point is that all of this is "self-appearing"—it appears naturally from the nature of awareness, not created by anyone.
From all pores of hair-light, radiating into space—infinite enumerable variety of realms and teachers, boundless, measureless, infinite. This is the fractal nature of reality. Every point contains infinite worlds. Every moment contains infinite Buddhas. Your own body, right now, has countless realms within it. You just don't perceive them because your perception is filtered through ordinary dualistic mind.
[317-322] "Thus in enjoyment-body's realm: teaching actual, speech self-arisen syllables whoever not made, yet all teaching's sons and simultaneous appearances those abide—at the time of unchanging dharmatā." This is describing the dimension of communication in the Sambhogakaya. The teachings aren't spoken words; they're the natural expression of dharmata itself. The syllables are self-arisen—not created, not manufactured. And all the beings who appear there abide simultaneously in the unchanging nature of reality.
[323-335] Now we get into the specific activities, starting with the body's activities. The outer activities: through body appearing without self-nature, obscurations are purified. This is pointing to the empty nature of form. When you recognize that the body is empty of inherent existence, that recognition itself purifies the obscurations that come from grasping at the body as solid and real.
The three face-hands represent different aspects of wisdom. The perfected wisdom face-hand perfects the body's self-nature. The clear light face-hand liberates self-appearance. The clear discerning face-hand perfects knowledge. These aren't physical hands! They're symbolic representations of how enlightened awareness functions. The inner four activities relate to the thirty-two marks and eighty signs—the characteristics of an enlightened being. But again, these aren't physical characteristics you can see with ordinary eyes. They're the natural qualities that manifest when awareness recognizes itself.
The secret four are profound: residing without front or back perfects the aspect of appearance. Looking from inside, outer clarity perfects the empty aspect. Looking from outside, inner clarity perfects non-duality. Tip pervasively residing perfects non-dwelling without cessation. This is describing how awareness is structured—it's not directional (no front or back), it's clear inside and outside simultaneously (showing the non-duality of inner and outer), and it doesn't dwell anywhere yet never stops.
[336-350] The speech activities follow the same pattern. The six self-arisen syllables (OM MANI PADME HUM) emanating from the tongue—this is how mantra functions at the Sambhogakaya level. The mantra isn't just sounds you recite; it's the natural vibration of awareness itself. Entering the father's face and emerging from mother's space—these are symbolic descriptions of how the non-dual wisdom emerges from the union of emptiness (mother) and appearance (father).
The secret speech activities are about practice: pure body practice engages self-arisen dharma, pure speech practice engages outflow-free dharma, pure mind practice enjoys wisdom knowing all aspects, pure face practice enjoys all-knowing dharma. These "practices" aren't things you do to become enlightened. They're descriptions of how awareness naturally functions when recognized.
[351-365] The mind activities through various samadhis: non-composite clear, pure wisdom view, pure dharma-nature, exhausted defilements—these are different ways of describing the stability of awareness. Then the five wisdoms: mirror-like, sameness, discriminating, action accomplished—these are the natural functions of awareness when unobscured.
The secret four mind activities are crucial: abiding in non-dual clarity-emptiness clears the duality of samsara and nirvana. Abiding in non-dual appearance-emptiness performs the non-duality of object and wisdom. Abiding in non-dual awareness-emptiness performs the non-duality of apprehension and apprehender. Abiding in non-dual object-mind cuts the conceptual limit of subject-object. These are pointing directly to the heart of Dzogchen view—all dualities are dissolved in the recognition of awareness.
[366-374] Third, the method of turning the wheel through emanation-body: from the enjoyment-body appearance, gone to emanation-body, twelve earth teachers clearly emanated in twelve abodes, possessing five-five perfections. This is describing how the teaching manifests in the Nirmanakaya dimension—the dimension of physical form and ordinary perception. The twelve teachers in twelve abodes represent the complete display of enlightened activity in the world.
The three emanations of body, speech, and mind are "not made by anyone, fearless." This is important! The emanations aren't created by someone deciding to create them. They self-arise from the nature of awareness as natural expressions of compassion. They're fearless because they come from the recognition that there's nothing to fear—no separation, no threat, no real obstruction.
[375-382] By self-arisen blessing, miracles and immeasurable qualities—possessing the activity of immediately liberating birth when meeting with whichever. This is describing the power of the teaching. When recognition dawns, birth is liberated immediately. Not gradually, not eventually, but right now. The "meeting" isn't a physical encounter; it's the meeting of recognition—when the disciple's awareness recognizes its own nature.
The three supports are described: mind-support Vajra (for disease-free), speech-support self-arisen letter (liberated by meeting and hearing), and body-support (liberating into clear light when meeting). These are describing how the teaching manifests in form. The Vajra, the letter, the body—they're all supports for recognition. When you encounter them with recognition, liberation is instantaneous.
[383-397] The text explains where these exist and for how long. They abide in different places by the times of body, speech, and mind teachings. The durations are given in cosmic timeframes—thousand Buddhas, various five hundreds and thousands of years. Don't get caught up in the numbers! This is describing the longevity of the teaching, how it remains in the world for the benefit of beings. The Vajra exists in Uddiyana, the letter held by dakinis in the sky—these are descriptions of terma, of hidden treasures that manifest when the time is right. The teaching isn't lost; it's always present, waiting for the right conditions to reveal itself.
[373-382] "Those three emanations of body, speech, mind, not made by anyone, fearless." Keep coming back to this! The enlightened manifestations aren't manufactured. They don't come from someone's intention or effort. They arise spontaneously from the nature of awareness itself. Like how a clear mirror naturally reflects whatever appears before it without deciding to do so, the three kayas naturally manifest to benefit beings without anyone making them happen.
The self-arisen blessing performs miracles and immeasurable qualities. The activity immediately liberates birth when meeting with whichever. What does "meeting" mean here? It's not about physically encountering some special object. It's the moment of recognition—when the disciple's mind meets the teaching and recognizes its own nature. In that moment, birth is liberated. The cycle of samsara is cut. This can happen in an instant, without years of preparation.
The three supports function as gateways: the Vajra supports the mind, pacifying disease; the self-arisen letter supports speech, liberating through sound; the body supports form, liberating into clear light. These aren't superstitious objects with magic powers! They're focal points for recognition. When you look at the Vajra with recognition, you're seeing the indestructible nature of your own awareness. When you hear the self-arisen syllables with recognition, you're hearing the natural sound of dharmata.
[383-397] The text describes the duration and location of these teachings. They abide in different places according to the times of body, speech, and mind teachings. The timeframes are vast—thousands of years, hundreds of Buddhas. This is describing the cosmic scale of the teaching, how it persists through time for the benefit of beings.
The Vajra exists in Uddiyana (the land of the dakinis), sometimes making emanations with light and sound. The letter is held by dakinis in the sky above Vajra-seat. These are descriptions of terma—hidden treasures of teaching that are concealed and revealed at appropriate times. The teaching isn't ever truly lost. It remains in the nature of mind, ready to manifest when conditions are right. This is how the Dzogchen lineage continues—not just through human transmission, but through the natural revelation of awareness itself.
The distinction between body-taming, speech-taming, and mind-taming teachings corresponds to different phases and different capacities of beings. As times change and beings' capacities change, different aspects of the teaching become more prominent. But all are ultimately pointing to the same recognition—the recognition of the nature of mind.
[398-405] Listen! The vajra at Ri ma la—at the vajra place, the yaksha kings worship with their hands. The syllable dwells in the sky above the vajra seat, held by dakinis. The body is not fixed to one earth—surrounding Jambudvipa, circling, making special divine and human gatherings into fields of offering. When harm comes to the teaching at times, light rays from the body, HUM from the mouth, fire from the eyes—turn back the obstacles!
[406-410] At the time of mind teaching, the vajra dwells in the sky of the vajra seat. The syllable dwells in the cave of the furious sage. The body dwells at the peak of the stacked vajra palace called "Thirty-three gods' measureless palace." Through such three emanations dwelling, Jambudvipa is supreme among others.
[411-423] The manner of twelve emanation bodies coming to the twelve classes—Vajradhara himself, from sambhogakaya going as nirmanakaya to purify beings' five aggregates, showing five perfections in nature as twelve appearances: First, the field Perfection Rich Stacked Tushita, abode Perfection at the lotus flower heart. Teacher Perfection, youth Display Supreme, Inconceivable One came. This good kalpa—Buddha thousand and bodhisattva two as indicators, ocean of light-display Buddhas thousand and two as retinue Perfection. Teaching: root of all, sound Mahayana tantra. Time: Amitayus time spoke. Compiler: divine son Joy Swelling Lord and Sun Greatly Shining, two.
[424-425] Second, abode Perfection at Jambudvipa. Teacher youth Light Unshakable, from five-colored egg shell born.
Emaho! The Buddha manifests in twelve ways to tame twelve types—recognize these emanations!
[426-436] The second emanation continues—teaching the five tantras of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities during a lifespan of one hundred million years. These timeframes aren't historical! They're describing the duration of different phases of the teaching from the perspective of those dimensions. A "year" in Tushita heaven isn't the same as a year on earth.
Third emanation: At Heat-Moisture-Gathering surrounded by light, teacher Fear-Protecting Mind teaches Samsara Dong-sprugs, Peacock Jing-bsnol, and Four-Elements-Exhausted tantras. Each location, each teacher, each teaching has specific significance. The locations represent different aspects of the mandala. The teachers represent different qualities of enlightened mind. The tantras represent different approaches to recognition.
Fourth emanation: At Attachment-Arising womb appearing, teacher Virarati teaches mind-class root tantras five and branch tantras six. The "womb" here represents the source of manifestation—the matrix from which all appearances arise. Virarati represents the playful, energetic aspect of enlightenment that cuts through attachment not by rejecting it but by seeing through it.
Fifth emanation: At Amrapali's youth's garden, the sixth Vajradhara teaches the six paramitas to Buddhas succession seven. Amrapali was a famous courtesan who became a disciple of the Buddha—the garden represents the transformation of ordinary pleasure into the path. The six paramitas (generosity, ethics, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom) are the practices that accumulate merit and wisdom.
[437-461] Sixth emanation: At Meru's north, charnel-ground Raurava, teacher Hero Power Great teaches Rigpa Rangshar and direct-luminous tantras. Charnel grounds are traditionally associated with wrathful practice—confronting death and impermanence directly. The Rigpa Rangshar (Self-Arising Awareness) is a crucial terma text in the Dzogchen tradition.
Seventh emanation: At rakshasa land Ruru sound-possessing cave, teacher Furious King rsi teaches coarse-taming tantras. The rakshasas represent powerful negative forces—both outer and inner. The "coarse-taming" tantras are forceful methods for dealing with intense obstacles.
The pattern continues—each emanation addresses different beings in different locations with different teachings appropriate to their capacities. This is the principle of skillful means in action. The Buddha doesn't teach one thing to everyone; he teaches what each being needs to hear.
Listen, dear practitioner! Do you see how the Buddha adapts to each place, each time, each retinue? Vulture Peak for sravakas, Mongolian lands for bodhisattvas, different teachers, different teachings—but all are emanations of the same wisdom. Do not cling to one form, one place! The Buddha appears wherever beings need him. Grdhrakuta, turquoise lands, bodhi trees—where is the Buddha not present? Recognize this, and every place becomes the Pure Land!
Emaho! Twelve emanations to tame twelve types—all are your own mind's display!
