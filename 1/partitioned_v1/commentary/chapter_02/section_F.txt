Longchenpa speaks now of the transcendent vehicle's superiority [2802-2831], and you must understand what makes it supreme! It is not that it offers better rewards—gods and humans also offer pleasures. It is not that it is more sophisticated—philosophers have endless sophistication. The transcendent vehicle is supreme because it includes what all others exclude.
What does it include? Great compassion combined with wisdom realizing both selflessnesses [2802]. Hear this! Compassion without wisdom becomes mere sentiment, worldly kindness that exhausts itself. Wisdom without compassion becomes cold isolation, liberation only for oneself. But when compassion and wisdom unite—when you see emptiness and it breaks your heart with love for all who do not see—this is the Great Vehicle.
From the Ratnavali: "Emptiness with compassion as essence—this accomplishes enlightenment for some" [2802]. This is the secret formula! Not emptiness alone, not compassion alone, but emptiness AS compassion, compassion AS emptiness. When you truly see that all beings lack inherent existence, how can you not feel compassion for their confusion? When you truly feel compassion for their suffering, how can you hold to any view of their solid existence?
The bodhisattva's aspiration and dedication [2802]—this is what transforms practice from self-liberation to universal liberation. You do not practice to escape; you practice to return, again and again, until all are free. Is this not a heavier burden? Yes! But it is also the only complete liberation. The one who seeks only their own freedom still harbors the grasping that separates self from other.
The definition of the Great Vehicle: "depending on whatever method, leading to the supreme great city of liberation" [2818]. Notice—methods are many! As many as beings' needs. But the destination is one: the recognition that was always present, the liberation that was never bound.
And the eleventh ground, All-Illumination [2818]—this is not a place you reach. It is the full maturation of what was always true: that awareness is all-illuminating, that wisdom pervades everywhere, that there is no corner of existence untouched by Buddha-nature. You do not become this; you recognize you have never been anything else.

Here Longchenpa speaks of the hearer vehicle in detail [2538-2669], and you must not look down on it! The sravakas, the "hearers," follow the four truths with dedication that puts most of us to shame. They hear the Dharma, they practice, and they attain liberation—foe-destroyer status, with or without remainder [2538].
Their path is systematic: the four applications of mindfulness, the four right exertions, the four bases of miraculous power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, the eightfold path [2899-2902]. These are not outdated categories! They describe how mind training actually works.
First, mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena—this stabilizes you. Then right exertion to abandon the unwholesome and cultivate the wholesome—this energizes you. Then the bases of miraculous power—this concentrates you. Then faculties and powers—this makes practice unshakeable. Then the branches of enlightenment—this opens wisdom. Finally the eightfold path—this integrates everything into a complete way of being.
The Vaibhasikas and Sautrantikas debate about atoms and moments [2549, 2580], about what is ultimately real. The Vaibhasikas accept partless dust-atoms; the Sautrantikas say even these are conceptual. But both realize the person-selflessness—the "I" cannot be found in the aggregates. This is huge! Most beings never question the self at all. These practitioners analyze until they see: no self in form, in feeling, in perception, in formations, in consciousness. Where is it then? Nowhere!
Yet they stop halfway. They realize the person is empty, but they think dharmas—the atoms, the moments, the elements—are real. This is like cleaning your house thoroughly but leaving one room locked, one closet unexamined. The self-enlightened ones go a bit further, seeing that outer dharmas are also empty [2731], but they still grasp at the mind that knows this emptiness.
You who practice—do not repeat their error! When you realize emptiness, do not grasp at the realization. When you see no self, do not establish a "no-self" to cling to. Go all the way to the Middle Way, where even emptiness is empty, even liberation is not something to attain.

Longchenpa continues his exposition of the self-enlightened vehicle [2710-2781], and I want you to appreciate their unique path! These pratyekabuddhas do not depend on teachers in their final life—they realize through their own power, at the end of existence [2710].
There are two types: like rhinoceroses dwelling alone, and like crows gathering in flocks [2710]. The rhinoceros is the superior type, meditating deeply on dependent arising, realizing both the person-selflessness and the outer dharma-selflessness—seeing that atoms and particles have no inherent existence [2731]. Yet even they do not fully realize the inner dharma-selflessness—they still grasp at the consciousness that knows.
Their meditation on dependent arising is profound [2760]. They go to charnel grounds and contemplate: "From what did this corpse arise?" From death. From what death? From birth. From what birth? From existence. From what existence? From grasping. From grasping? From craving. From craving? From feeling. From feeling? From contact. From contact? From the six sense bases. From the six sense bases? From name and form. From name and form? From consciousness. From consciousness? From formative forces. From formative forces? From ignorance.
This is the twelve links, traced backward from effect to cause. And when they see it clearly, they reverse it: destroy ignorance, and formative forces cease. Destroy formative forces, consciousness ceases. All the way to the cessation of aging and death. This is liberation!
They also meditate on the eight unpleasant objects [2781]: the bloated corpse, the blue-black corpse, the rotting corpse, the split corpse, the devoured corpse, the scattered corpse, the burned corpse, the white skeleton. Why? To break attachment to the body! You cling to this flesh as "mine," as beautiful, as desirable. But look at it in a charnel ground! This is what awaits your precious body.
Yet their limitation remains: they teach by signs, not words [2742], and their compassion does not extend to teaching others extensively. They attain liberation for themselves, like a rhinoceros wandering alone. Noble, yes! Complete, no. The full awakening of a bodhisattva or buddha goes beyond, liberating all.

Longchenpa speaks of the Bodhisattva vehicle's stages [2802-2831], and you must hear this as your own potential! The bodhisattva is not some special being, some saint far beyond you. The bodhisattva is the nature of your own mind when it recognizes its connection to all beings.
What makes the bodhisattva vehicle superior? Great compassion as method, and wisdom realizing both selflessnesses [2802]. Method without wisdom becomes mere worldly virtue—you accumulate merit but remain in samsara's garden. Wisdom without method becomes cold isolation—you free yourself but leave everyone behind. But when method and wisdom unite in a single mind, this is the Great Vehicle, the path that leads to complete awakening.
From the Ratnavali: "Emptiness with compassion as essence—this accomplishes enlightenment for some" [2802]. This is the alchemical formula! Emptiness is not nihilism; it is the space in which compassion can function without limit. Compassion is not sentimentality; it is the natural response to suffering when you see no separate beings, only the play of conditions.
The bodhisattva's aspiration and dedication [2802] transforms everything. You do not practice to escape; you practice to return, to remain, to help. Even after you could enter cessation, you choose birth after birth, appearance after appearance, until all beings are free. This is the meaning of "foe-destroyer" in the Mahayana—not one who destroys outer enemies, but one who destroys the inner foes of affliction, and then continues to work for others.
The definition: "depending on whatever method, leading to the supreme great city of liberation" [2818]. Notice—methods are many! Skillful means are limitless. But the destination is one: the recognition of what has always been true, the liberation that was never bound.
And the fruit? The eleventh ground, All-Illumination [2818]—not separate from the first ground, not different from your present state. It is this very awareness, fully recognized, completely unobscured. You do not become something new; you simply see what has never been hidden.

Now Longchenpa enters the profound topic of the two truths [2831-2866], and you must understand this clearly! The conventional and ultimate are not two different realities. They are two ways of seeing the same reality.
The Root Wisdom says: "The Buddhas taught the Dharma, relying correctly upon the two truths: the conventional truth of the world, and the ultimate truth of meaning" [2839-2842]. This is not philosophical dualism! It is practical pedagogy. The Buddha meets beings where they are, speaking conventionally to those who need it, pointing ultimately to those who can receive it.
The conventional has two divisions: false and true [2848]. The false conventional is all imputed appearances arranged by intellect [2849]—the world you create through conceptual construction. You see a table, you name it "table," you believe in the table as truly existing. This functions! You can eat on it, work on it. But when analyzed, where is the table? In the wood? The wood is also imputed. In the atoms? The atoms are also conceptual. Everything dissolves under analysis.
Yet the true conventional [2862-2866]—the white actions of virtue, the collections of merit gathered through wisdom's samadhi—this leads toward liberation. It is still conventional, still conceptual, but it functions to bring you closer to the ultimate. Like using a dream to wake from dreaming.
And the ultimate? Also two: nominal and true [2871-2887]. The nominal ultimate is what you realize through reasoning—through Madhyamaka analysis, through negating all extremes. You see that nothing arises from itself, from other, from both, or from neither. You conclude: empty. This is crucial! But it is still conceptual, still within the realm of mind.
The true ultimate [2881-2887]—phenomena primordially transcend all elaboration. They do not need to be negated; they were never established. They do not need to be emptied; they were never full. This is beyond reasoning, beyond concept, beyond even the notion of "ultimate." It is what remains when the mind that seeks it relaxes completely.

Longchenpa details the bodhisattva path's stages [2889-2961], and you must not see this as merely theoretical! These stages describe how your own practice will unfold if you commit to the path.
First, the four establishments of mindfulness on the small path of accumulation [2895]—mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena. This stabilizes you. You learn to watch without immediately reacting. You see your body as impermanent, your feelings as unsatisfactory, your mind as changing, your phenomena as selfless. This is the foundation!
Then the four right abandonments on the medium path [2896]—abandoning unwholesome states that have arisen, preventing unwholesome states that have not arisen, producing wholesome states that have not arisen, maintaining wholesome states that have arisen. This energizes your practice!
The four miraculous feet on the great path [2897]—desire, effort, mind, and investigation. This concentrates your power. You become capable of sustained attention, of penetrating insight.
Then come the five faculties on the path of heat and peak [2898]—faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. These are like five roots drawing up nourishment. Without faith, no effort. Without effort, no mindfulness. Without mindfulness, no concentration. Without concentration, no wisdom.
The five strengths on the path of patience and supreme dharma [2899]—the same five, but now unshakeable. You cannot be swayed by doubt, by distraction, by any obstacle.
The seven limbs of enlightenment on the path of seeing [2900]—mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, pliancy, concentration, equanimity. These blossom when you have direct perception of emptiness.
And finally the eight aspects of the superior path on the nine grounds of meditation [2901]—right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration. The complete integration of wisdom and conduct.
But hear this: these are not steps you climb once and for all. You cycle through them again and again, each time more deeply. And the final fruit—the All-Illumination ground, the Dharma body, the form bodies [2905-2913]—is not a reward you earn. It is what you already are, fully revealed when the clouds of confusion dissolve.
