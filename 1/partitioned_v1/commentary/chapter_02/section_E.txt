Longchenpa continues his relentless exposure of wrong views [2100-2164], and you must feel the urgency here! Every one of these three hundred sixty views is a trap you could fall into, a way of thinking that promises liberation but delivers only more bondage.
Look at how he describes the cutting of flesh, the jumping from cliffs, the burning of bodies with fire [2273-2283]—these extreme ascetic practices performed in the name of spirituality. You may not be wrapping yourself in cloth soaked with sesame oil and setting yourself ablaze, but what are you doing to yourself in the name of practice? Are you pushing until you break? Are you making your spiritual life another form of self-punishment?
The tirthikas who declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed [2350-2364]—these are not just ancient heretics. They are your own mind when it gives up, when it says "nothing matters," when it falls into nihilism disguised as wisdom. Beware! The true Dharma never severs anything. It reveals that there was never anything to sever.
When Longchenpa speaks of those who "wield evil mantras as chief, performing fierce destructive rites" [2324], or those who "take divination and prophecy as chief, caring only for this world's happiness" [2324], he is warning you about spiritual materialism. Are you using practice to get what you want? To harm your enemies? To predict the future? Then you have become what he describes.
The four types he identifies—extreme view, extreme end, distant benefit, indifference [2401-2411]—cover all the mistakes. Eternal permanence at one pole, complete annihilation at the other, with various compromises in between. Where do you stand? Probably you oscillate between them, sometimes believing in something permanent, sometimes believing in nothing at all.
The purpose of teaching all this [2425] is so you do not enter wrong paths. But how do you know what is wrong? Wrong is anything that requires you to grasp at a view, to establish a position, to become something. The right path is the path that dissolves the path-walker, that reveals no one ever needed to go anywhere.
So read these lists not as history but as diagnosis. Find your own tendencies here. Then let them go. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. Rest there.

Now we arrive at the transcendent vehicle [2430-2474], and here you must pay sharp attention! The difference between worldly and transcendent is not a matter of doing different things—it is a matter of completely different seeing.
The four seals that distinguish the Buddha's teaching [2434]: all compounded things impermanent, all defiled things suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation peaceful—these are not beliefs to adopt. They are facts to be recognized. Look at your own experience! Is anything you grasp permanent? Does anything stained by attachment bring lasting satisfaction? Can you find a self in all your searching? When you stop struggling, is there not peace?
Longchenpa speaks of the vehicle "like space, a measureless great palace" [2446]. Space does not reject anything. It holds all without preference. This is how the bodhisattva's mind must become—vast enough to include all beings, all sufferings, all joys, without being moved from its natural openness.
The nine vehicles [2475-2502] are not rungs on a ladder to climb one by one. They are descriptions of how different minds approach the truth. If you have lesser faculties, you may need the gradual approaches of the lower vehicles. If your mind is sharp, you may go directly to Dzogchen. But do not pride yourself on being "higher"! The pride itself places you lower. The humble practitioner of the lowest vehicle who genuinely transforms their mind surpasses the arrogant Dzogchenpa who merely thinks they are supreme.
From Ati Kopa Chenpo: "By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara. Correct: three stages" [2502-2508]. You are always realizing something. The question is: is your realization correct or incorrect? Correct realization sees through the self and rests naturally. Incorrect realization grasps at something—experience, view, status—and builds a new prison.
The small, medium, and great stages correspond to how much of the self you have seen through. Small stage: you understand intellectually but still grasp at appearances. Medium: you see through outer appearances but grasp at mind itself. Great: even the grasping at mind dissolves, and what remains is what was always there.
Do not compare yourself to these stages. Simply look: what is grasping right now? Release that, and you are already beyond all vehicles.

Longchenpa now enters the profound topic of the two truths [2831-2866], and you must not let this become merely philosophical! The conventional and ultimate are not two different things—they are two ways of seeing the same thing.
When you look at this page, what do you see? Conventionally, you see words, meaning, a teaching. Ultimately, you see emptiness—words that cannot be found when analyzed, meaning that arises dependently, a display that is like a dream. Both are true! The words function. You understand. Yet they have no inherent existence.
The false conventional [2849-2856]—all imputed appearances arranged by intellect—this is your everyday world. You name things, you categorize, you create a reality through conceptual construction. And it works! You navigate, you survive, you communicate. But when you believe this construction is truly real, truly existing out there independent of your mind, you are trapped in the false conventional.
The true conventional [2862-2866]—the white actions of virtue, the collections of merit gathered through wisdom's samadhi—this is the path that leads toward recognition. It is still conventional, still conceptual, but it functions to bring you closer to the ultimate. Like using a thorn to remove a thorn, using a dream to wake from dreaming.
And the ultimate? There are two ultimates too! The nominal ultimate [2873-2879]—what you realize through reasoning, through analysis, through the negation of all extremes. You examine: does something arise from itself, from other, from both, from neither? You find no satisfactory answer. You conclude: empty. This is the nominal ultimate.
But the true ultimate [2881-2887]—phenomena primordially transcend all elaborations. They do not need to be negated; they were never affirmative. They do not need to be emptied; they were never full. This is not something you reach through reasoning. It is what remains when reasoning itself dissolves into its own ground.
So practice with both truths. Engage the conventional path—the virtues, the disciplines, the meditations [2889-2902]. But never forget that even as you practice, the ultimate truth is never separate, never elsewhere. The path itself is empty. The one who walks it cannot be found.

Here Longchenpa describes the bodhisattva path in detail [2903-2961], the stages and grounds, the heat and patience and peak. You read this and think "I must achieve these stages!" But listen carefully—you who are always trying to get somewhere.
The path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the path of no-more-learning [2903-2902]—these are not places you arrive at. They are descriptions of how recognition deepens. When you first hear the teachings and feel inspired, you are on the path of accumulation. When you begin to practice consistently, the path of preparation. When you have a genuine glimpse of emptiness—even for a moment—the path of seeing opens.
But do not grasp at these as achievements! The bodhisattva who thinks "I have reached the first ground" has already fallen back. The grounds are not rungs on a ladder; they are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely you have released the illusion of a self who progresses.
The ten grounds themselves—Great Joy, Stainless, Luminous, Radiant, Difficult to Overcome, Manifest, Gone Afar, Immovable, Excellent Intelligence, Cloud of Dharma [2974]—describe the maturing of wisdom. Great Joy: initial recognition brings overwhelming happiness. Stainless: you no longer create new karma that binds. Luminous: wisdom shines clearly. And so forth, each ground dissolving deeper obscurations.
But hear this: you do not need to wait lifetimes to experience these! Right now, in this moment, can you rest in recognition? That is the ground of Great Joy. Can you do so without creating new grasping? That is Stainless. Is the recognition clear? That is Luminous. Do not postpone this!
The fruit—the eleventh ground of All-Illumination, the Dharma body and form bodies [2905-2913]—is not something you become in the future. It is what you already are, obscured by temporary clouds of confusion. The path is simply the clearing of those clouds. The sun does not need to be created; it only needs to be seen.
So practice the six perfections, the four immeasurables, the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment [2899-2902]. But practice knowing that the practitioner is already perfect, the practice is already complete, and the result has never been absent. This is the bodhisattva's secret: working tirelessly while knowing there is nothing to do.

Now Longchenpa speaks of the Mind-Only school [2981-2995], and you must be careful here—this view is subtle and easily misunderstood! When the Cittamatras say "all is mind," they do not mean your personal mind, your thoughts and emotions, creates the world. They point to something vaster.
The example given: a jewel reflected in water [2984]. The jewel appears in the water, but is the jewel in the water? No. Does that mean there is no jewel? No. The appearance is real as appearance, but the jewel is not where it appears to be. So with all phenomena—they appear to be out there, independent, but their actual nature is the knowing in which they appear.
The debate about whether aspects and consciousness are one or different [2986-2998]—this is not mere philosophy. It strikes at how you experience reality right now! When you see a tree, is the tree separate from your seeing? Is the seeing separate from the tree? Can you have one without the other? Investigate this directly, not conceptually.
The Mind-Only view corrects the extreme of materialism—the belief that mind arises from matter, that consciousness is merely brain function. But it risks its own extreme: grasping at mind as truly existent, as the absolute foundation. This is why the Middle Way school goes further, showing that mind too is empty of inherent existence.
Yet do not dismiss Mind-Only! It is a necessary step. First you must see through the illusion of external matter. Then you must see through the illusion of internal mind. When both external and internal are seen through, what remains? Not nothing—rather, a knowing that is neither inside nor outside, neither mind nor matter, yet the basis of both.
This is why Longchenpa will move to the Middle Way view. But for now, rest in the recognition that all appearances are like reflections. They appear, they function, they have consequences. But they do not exist as they appear to exist. The tree you see is not a tree independent of seeing. The sound you hear is not a sound independent of hearing. And the one who sees and hears? Equally without independent existence.

Longchenpa continues through the detailed exposition of vehicles and views, and you must not get lost in the complexity! The Sautrantika and Vaibhasika schools [2526-2597] may seem like ancient history, but their debates live in your own mind.
The Vaibhasikas hold to dust-atoms, partless particles that compose reality [2549]. Do you not also seek the fundamental building blocks? The irreducible truth? The final answer? This is the Vaibhasika tendency in you—wanting to reduce everything to smallest units, to analyze until you find what is truly real.
The Sautrantikas go further, seeing even atoms as conceptual imputations [2580]. They emphasize the stream of consciousness, the flow of moments. You experience this in meditation—thoughts as moments, sensations as flickering, reality as a movie rather than solid objects. But still they grasp at the moments themselves as real.
Both schools practice the four truths and the twelve links [2549, 2710-2781]. They meditate on impurity, on skeletons, on the eight unpleasant objects [2669-2781]—all to break attachment. And these methods work! When you truly see the body as impermanent, as impure, as suffering, attachment loosens.
But here is the limitation: they still grasp at the antidote. They think "I am meditating on impurity." They establish a subject, an object, and an action. This subtle grasping keeps them from full liberation. The rhinoceros-like self-enlightened ones realize half the dharma-selflessness—the outer grasping of atoms is empty—but they do not realize the inner grasping of the antidote itself is also empty [2731-2733].
The crow-like self-enlightened ones meditate on dependent arising in reverse [2742], going to charnel grounds and contemplating how corpses arise from death, from birth, from existence, back to ignorance. This is powerful practice! But still, they teach through signs, not words, and their realization remains partial.
You who read this—do not be satisfied with partial! Do not stop at breaking attachment to outer things while still grasping at inner mind. Go all the way. See that even the one who meditates is unfindable. Then meditation and non-meditation, path and non-path, are both liberated in the same recognition.

Longchenpa speaks now of the transcendent vehicle's superiority [2802-2831], and you must understand what makes it supreme! It is not that it offers better rewards—gods and humans also offer pleasures. It is not that it is more sophisticated—philosophers have endless sophistication. The transcendent vehicle is supreme because it includes what all others exclude.
What does it include? Great compassion combined with wisdom realizing both selflessnesses [2802]. Hear this! Compassion without wisdom becomes mere sentiment, worldly kindness that exhausts itself. Wisdom without compassion becomes cold isolation, liberation only for oneself. But when compassion and wisdom unite—when you see emptiness and it breaks your heart with love for all who do not see—this is the Great Vehicle.
From the Ratnavali: "Emptiness with compassion as essence—this accomplishes enlightenment for some" [2802]. This is the secret formula! Not emptiness alone, not compassion alone, but emptiness AS compassion, compassion AS emptiness. When you truly see that all beings lack inherent existence, how can you not feel compassion for their confusion? When you truly feel compassion for their suffering, how can you hold to any view of their solid existence?
The bodhisattva's aspiration and dedication [2802]—this is what transforms practice from self-liberation to universal liberation. You do not practice to escape; you practice to return, again and again, until all are free. Is this not a heavier burden? Yes! But it is also the only complete liberation. The one who seeks only their own freedom still harbors the grasping that separates self from other.
The definition of the Great Vehicle: "depending on whatever method, leading to the supreme great city of liberation" [2818]. Notice—methods are many! As many as beings' needs. But the destination is one: the recognition that was always present, the liberation that was never bound.
And the eleventh ground, All-Illumination [2818]—this is not a place you reach. It is the full maturation of what was always true: that awareness is all-illuminating, that wisdom pervades everywhere, that there is no corner of existence untouched by Buddha-nature. You do not become this; you recognize you have never been anything else.
