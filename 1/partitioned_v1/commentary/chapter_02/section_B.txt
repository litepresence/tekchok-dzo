[461] Spoke at the time of ten thousand year lifespan.
[462-467] Eighth: Abode Perfection at Grdhrakuta, Vulture Peak. Teacher Golden Light Supreme. To retinue Perfection, noble sravakas countless, taught dharma vinaya ten thousand immeasurable, at time of five thousand year lifespan.
[468-474] Ninth: Abode Perfection at Mongolian Turquoise Eyebrow Land. At the Bodhi tree. Teacher Love Play Wisdom. To retinue Bodhisattvas immeasurable, taught dharma Atiyoga tantra seven and so forth, at time of thousand year lifespan.
[475-480] Tenth: Abode Perfection at Grdhrakuta, Vulture Peak. Teacher Light Pillar Elderly. To retinue devas with life, seven including Star Light Good, taught dharma sutras and kriya.
Listen, dear practitioner! Do you see how the Buddha adapts to each place, each time, each retinue? Vulture Peak for sravakas, Mongolian lands for bodhisattvas, different teachers, different teachings—but all are emanations of the same wisdom. Do not cling to one form, one place! The Buddha appears wherever beings need him. Grdhrakuta, turquoise lands, bodhi trees—where is the Buddha not present? Recognize this, and every place becomes the Pure Land!
Emaho! Twelve emanations to tame twelve types—all are your own mind's display!
[510-511] From Ati Kodpa Chenpo, spoken in the Land of Turquoise Letters, extensively arising. From these also, the inexhaustible body, speech, and mind ornament wheel's thirty-six activities.
[512-518] The body's outer four activities: Aiming to abandon the four rivers of suffering—birth, worldly games, miracles competition, manifestation, and alms round conduct.
[519-525] The inner four: Aiming to abandon retinue and enjoyments—horse supreme, discarding chariot, going to the essence of bodhi, spreading light rays, transforming weapon rain into flowers.
[526-529] The secret four: Aiming to tame at the end of teaching through samadhi—performing austerities, at Mount Golden Samadhi sound hundred-twenty thousand moments manifesting.
Listen, dear practitioner! Do you see how the Buddha's activities are vast? Outer, inner, secret—each level deeper than the last. The Buddha appears to abandon suffering, to teach through play, to tame through samadhi. But these are not different Buddhas—they are one wisdom displaying according to need. Do not get stuck on outer forms! See through to the wisdom activity behind them all.
Emaho! Thirty-six activities of inexhaustible body, speech, and mind!
[577-610] Now begins the explanation of fields and the container-contained—the cosmology of the pure lands. From bodhi in the self-nature of Vajradhara, abiding as Sambhogakaya from Dharmakaya, from the five-family kaya, from arrangement of immeasurable fields... This is describing the architecture of enlightened perception. The pure lands aren't somewhere else; they're the natural display that arises when awareness recognizes itself.
The text describes twenty-five stacked fields, with this Saha world (our world) at the thirteenth, surrounded by thirteen luminosity-jewel ornamented fields above, below, and in all directions. The symbolism is important: twenty-five represents the complete mandala (five families times five). Saha being at the thirteenth represents the central position—neither at the beginning nor the end, but at the heart of the display.
From the Sound Thalgyur tantra, the text names various fields: Thal-ba-dbyangs below this world, Thal-ba-'dzin in the six lower worlds, Thal-ba-skyob at three right of this world, Thal-ba-brdal above six worlds, Thal-ba's be-con above nineteen worlds, Thal-ba'i-rgyun at the north-east interval. These names aren't arbitrary—they describe different qualities of the display. "Thal" relates to thalgyur, the "penetrating" quality of Dzogchen view.
[611-634] The descriptions continue with elaborate imagery—wheel shapes, lotus blooming shapes, victory banners, parasols, flowers, fragrances. Don't get caught in the poetic details! This is describing the sensory richness of the Sambhogakaya dimension. In our ordinary experience, perception is filtered through contraction and grasping. In the pure lands, perception is open, radiant, and beautiful—every sense is saturated with bliss and clarity.
The "teacher's teaching gathering-expanded" in Thal-ba-brdal, the "teacher's teaching complete-two possessing" in Thal-ba's be-con—these describe how the teaching manifests differently in different dimensions based on the capacities of beings. But always, the essence is the same: pointing to the recognition of awareness.
[635-682] The description of the pure lands continues with rich imagery from the south-eastern and south-western directions. The sound of Thal-ba resounding, surrounded by victory banners and parasols, flowers and fragrances descending—this is describing the celebratory atmosphere of the Sambhogakaya. In this dimension, everything naturally honors and celebrates the teaching. There's no struggle, no effort required. The environment itself supports recognition.
The "wind of Thal-ba" moving and stirring in intermediate space, giving rise to all sounds—this is describing how the teaching propagates. Not through force or coercion, but naturally, like wind moving through space. The teaching is "moved by wind, the three gateways of the five-possessing one"—the five sense doors functioning as gateways to recognition.
The thirteen stacked at the summit, called Jewel Thal-ba, adorned with solar rays and the qualities of desire—this is describing how even desire is transformed in the pure lands. In ordinary experience, desire leads to grasping and suffering. In the pure lands, desire is liberated into the natural richness of the display. The "lotus eyes of lda-ldi"—pure perception that sees everything as beautiful, as the play of awareness.
[683-695] "Thus from immeasurable fields, this Saha's sequence is explained." Our world, Saha (the world of endurance), is explained as arising from the same source as all the pure lands. The external elements arise from wind, connected with space's khams, that water, that upper earth. This is the traditional Buddhist cosmology—worlds arising from the interaction of elements.
But here's the key: this cosmology is describing not just physical reality but the structure of perception. "Continents arrangement and Meru and wishing-tree and jewel with, sun moon individual gods..." These are descriptions of how the mandala of experience is organized. Meru (the cosmic mountain) is the central channel, the sun and moon are the right and left channels, the continents are the different aspects of perception. The external world and the internal body are mirrors of each other.
[696-742] The cosmological description continues, explaining how the three realms (desire, form, formless) arise and support each other. From Pearl Garland's tantra, the mechanics of world-formation are described—wind supporting water, water supporting earth, the process of gathering, contracting, pulling, and lifting. This traditional cosmology describes how worlds come into being through the interaction of elements.
But again, don't mistake this for geology! It's describing the structure of experience. The "formless khams arisen from that"—the formless realm arises when consciousness exists without the support of form. The three realms (desire, form, formless) support each other, and from them arise the pure abodes and other realms.
The description of the fortunate aeon's first humans is telling: possessing form and beauty marks, body pervaded by own-light radiance, living eighty-thousand years, without male and female faculties. This describes the original state of beings before the fall into duality. The "delusion's cause two"—the arising of dualistic perception—led to the gradual coarsening of experience, the arising of faculties and gates, the decrease of light, the exhaustion of merit.
[743-756] Then beings began to eat earth-oil, then rice, and so forth—food becoming coarser as perception becomes more dualistic. This is the traditional Buddhist account of the decline of the world-age. But in Dzogchen, none of this is ultimate truth. It's all the play of awareness. The fall into duality, the decline of the age, the coarsening of experience—it's all part of the display. And it can all be recognized as such, right now.
The important point: whether in the golden age with eighty-thousand year lifespans or in our current age with all its problems, the nature of awareness never changes. Recognition is equally available in all times and circumstances. The outer conditions don't determine your capacity for awakening. Your recognition does.
COMMENTARY — Page 21 [757-780]
Listen, you who read these words about world-systems arising—do you think this is mere geography? Longchenpa is not giving you a map for your intellect to possess. He is showing you how your own mind fabricates worlds.
You read of space, wind, water, earth, fire, and sky—these five elements. But look at your own experience. When you sit in meditation, where does this "world" come from? Does it arise from outside, or does it dawn from the expanse of your own awareness? Like mist rising from a valley when the sun warms it—worlds appear, yet nothing has truly come from anywhere.
The text speaks of a triangle of space, the syllable E, the seed from which all manifests. You, practitioner—do you not see that your own mind is this triangle? Empty, clear, without obstruction, yet from it arise all appearances like rays from a lamp. You search for the world's beginning in ancient eons, but have you found the beginning of your own thought? Turn around and look—where does this very thought arise from? Trace it back, and you will find no starting point. No triangle. No seed. Only the natural state, wide open like the sky at dawn.
Longchenpa mentions twenty intermediate eons passed, elements arising from clear space. You think this happened long ago? It happens every moment. Each breath—worlds dissolve and arise. Each blink—aeons pass. The world you think you see right now is no more solid than a cloud formation. Look at a cloud: it appears, it takes shape, you give it names, and then—where does it go? Not to some cloud-cemetery. It simply returns to what it never left. Your world is like this.
Do not grasp at these cosmological descriptions as something to memorize. Instead, recognize what they point to: your own mind's power to manifest. The container-world and the essence-beings—are they two? Are they separate from the one who perceives them? You perceive hells and heavens, yet where are they located except in the expanse of your experience? A nightmare is terrifying while you dream, but upon waking, where has it gone? So too with all realms.
The victorious ones teach these cosmologies not that you might become a scholar of worlds, but that you might see through the world-making tendency of your own mind. When you recognize that all worlds are mind, then the need to flee from one realm to another falls away. Where will you go that is outside mind? What realm can you find that is not made of awareness?
So read these words, but read them as a finger pointing at your own face. The triangle, the seed-syllables, the aeons of formation—are any of them separate from the awareness that right now hears these words? Rest in that recognition. Let the intellect exhaust itself trying to measure worlds. You simply rest, open and clear, like space itself.
COMMENTARY — Page 22 [781-806]
You read now of wind arising, striped like a mouse's breath, forming the vajra-cross at the navel of space. You picture this in your imagination—yaṃ syllables and goddesses holding banners. But listen: where is this wind in your own body right now?
Feel your breath. There it is. The same wind that stirs world-systems stirs your lungs. The text speaks of vast depths and widths—hundreds of thousands of leagues—but have you measured the space between your own inhalation and exhalation? That gap, that pause where breath rests, is vaster than any cosmic wind mandala. In that gap, the nature of mind is nakedly present. Yet you rush past it, chasing after conceptual worlds.
Water arises from clouds of gold essence, raining for seven years. You think this is ancient history? Look at your own mind when emotion arises. A mere thought—a cloud of concept—and suddenly the rain of afflictions pours down. For seven moments or seven years, you are drenched in your own projections. Clear water, turbid water—have you not seen both in your own experience? The mind's nature is clear like water that cannot be grasped, yet we churn it with grasping and make it turbid.
The text describes fire and earth forming, layer upon layer, like cream on milk. You, practitioner—your own grasping at self is this layering. Each moment of "I am," "this is mine," "this is other"—you build worlds upon worlds, like a stupa's tiers. But look at what supports what. Does fire support earth, or does earth support fire? In your experience, do elements truly arise sequentially, or do they appear together, interdependent, like a dream where all arises at once?
The separating wind, the forming earth, the ripening fire—Longchenpa describes the functions of these elements. Fire ripens, wind moves, earth presses, sky opens. But these are not external processes happening in some distant universe. They are happening in your body right now. The fire of digestion ripens food. The wind of breath opens and closes your sense doors. The earth of flesh holds you together. The space of mind allows experience to dawn.
Most crucial: the text says these elements act to ripen beings' merit, complete sense powers, clarify body color, make mind abide, and show action. You read this and think it refers to cosmic evolution. Foolish one! It refers to your meditation practice. When the elements are balanced in your body, merit ripens as realization. Sense powers complete as the ability to perceive the natural state. Body becomes clear as light. Mind abides without wandering. Your actions show the fruition of practice.
Do not search for these cosmic elements in outer space. Find them in this very body, this very mind. They are closer than your own face. Rest without manipulating them, and you will see what Longchenpa truly means.
COMMENTARY — Page 23 [807-841]
Waves from the ocean, atoms falling like snow—Longchenpa paints pictures of world-formation that captivate the intellect. But you, who seek liberation, must look deeper.
The text describes sky atoms falling, gathering, expanding like silk on the ocean. You imagine this cosmically, but have you watched your own mind when a thought arises? From where do these mental atoms fall? What sky do they drop from? One moment there is silence, the next—thoughts gathering like snow, covering the pure ground of awareness. But look closely: did they come from anywhere? Do they go anywhere? Like the text says, "by action of doing nature"—this doing is your own grasping, your own fabrication.
Four earth goddesses hold golden vases at four corners. Beautiful imagery, yes, but what are the four corners of your own mind? Are they not the four directions of past, future, self, and other? And who holds them? Who stabilizes your world? Look for this holder—can you find anyone? The goddesses vanish like mist when you search for them directly. The vases are empty. The corners dissolve into space.
The text speaks of naga sons holding from four sides. You think of serpent deities, but consider: what supports your world right now? What holds up the earth of your assumptions? It is held by the nagas of habit, coiled around the depths of your being, unconsciously supporting the structures you take for granted. Until you recognize them, they rule your world. But recognize them—recognize the habitual patterns that hold your reality in place—and they transform. They become guardians rather than binding forces.
Then comes the mandala of elements, stacked like stupa tiers. You read this and build a mental image. But drop the image and look at your own experience. Does your body not have its own tiers? The solid bones, the liquid blood, the heat of metabolism, the breath that moves, the space within the channels? Your body is the mandala. Your experience is the cosmology. What need to search elsewhere?
The commentary mentions fire ripening, water pervading, wind making sense-powers complete, sky opening the aperture of mind. These are not external processes—they are the subtle body mechanics of your own meditation. When fire ripens in the central channel, the red and white essences unite. When water pervades, the bindus flow freely. When wind enters the central channel, sense-powers transform into wisdom. When sky opens, the mind recognizes its own nature.
Do not be deceived by the grandeur of the description. The grandeur is meant to exhaust your ordinary thinking. When the mind cannot grasp the vastness, it gives up—and in that giving up, recognition dawns. So read these vast numbers, these immeasurable distances, and let them expand your mind beyond its limits. Then rest in that expansion, without boundary, without reference point. That resting is the practice.
COMMENTARY — Page 24 [842-872]
Now we come to Mount Meru, the cosmic mountain, rising like butter from churned milk. You picture a golden mountain, silver to the east, beryl south, ruby west, gold north—beautiful, yes? But listen carefully.
Where is Mount Meru in your own experience? It is your spine, practitioner. The central channel, avadhuti, rising from the pelvic floor to the crown of your head. The four sides? The four subtle channels that branch from it. The colors? The elements that flow through them. Do not think this is mere correspondence or symbolic fancy. The ancient yogis mapped the outer world from their inner experience. They discovered that the macrocosm and microcosm are not two.
The text describes tiers upon tiers—turquoise vajra tier, lotus tier, wheel tier, jewel light tier. These are the chakras, wheels of subtle energy in your body. The lower tier at the navel, the lotus at the heart, the wheel at the throat, the jewel at the crown. Each tier elevated, each more refined than the one below. As your meditation deepens, you ascend these tiers. The coarse winds settle, the subtle winds arise. The clear light dawns at the crown.
You read of seven mountains, seven lakes, and you picture a geography. But look at your own face—seven orifices. Look at your body—seven main chakras. The play-lakes where nagas dwell? The bindu drops in your channels. The naga kings who control rain? The energy currents that nourish your practice. Everything in this description has an inner dimension that is the true meaning.
The four continents—do you think they exist somewhere in space? East, south, west, north—they are the four directions of your awareness. Expanding, contracting, rising, settling. The shapes described—circular, square, semicircular, trapezoidal—these are the shapes your awareness takes in different states. When awareness expands infinitely, it is circular like Godaniya. When it is stable and grounded, it is square like Uttarakuru. When it wavers between two extremes, it is semicircular like Purvavideha. When it is broad at the base and narrow at the top, concentrated, it is Jambudvipa.
Jambudvipa, the southern continent where we dwell—you read this and feel confirmed in your location. But recognize: Jambudvipa is the state of awareness where beings have the greatest capacity for suffering and for liberation. It is not a geographical location. It is the human condition itself—precarious, perched between heaven and hell, capable of the greatest delusion and the greatest awakening. You are here, reading these words, because your awareness has taken this shape. Use it well.
The islands that accompany each continent—Deha and Videha, Kuru and Uttarakuru—these are the satellite states of mind, the secondary patterns that accompany your main delusion or realization. Do not grasp at the names. Look at your own mind's patterns. See how they cluster around central tendencies. This is the true meaning of the cosmology.
COMMENTARY — Page 25 [873-915]
The names continue—Yoke-holder, Plow-arrow-holder, Acacia-possessing, Beautiful-to-see, Horse-ear, Prostrate, Rim-holder. You read these and think of mountain ranges surrounding Mount Meru. But listen, you who would know your own mind.
These are the obstacles on the path, practitioner. The seven mountains are the seven stages of purification, or the seven obscurations that must be traversed. Yoke-holder—your fixation on self, yoked to existence. Plow-arrow-holder—your aggressive tendencies, plowing up virtue, shooting arrows of harm. Each name describes a pattern in your mind, a way that you hold yourself back from recognition.
The measurements decrease as we move outward—forty thousand yojanas down to six hundred twenty-five. You think this is mere cosmological detail. But observe: as you move away from the center of your being, the delusions become more numerous but less substantial. The grossest obscurations are closest to the core. The subtlest are at the periphery. Yet all are measurable. All can be traversed. The path has dimensions.
The eight great nagas in their lakes—Joyful, Near-joyful, Horse-basis, Releasing-holding, Possessing-splendor, Land-guarding, Great-black, E la leaves. These are not mythological serpents. They are the eight classes of consciousness, the eight ways that awareness can flow when it is not liberated. They control the rains—the rains of experience, of blessing, of obstacles. When the nagas are pleased, the crops grow. When your consciousness is aligned, realization flourishes. When they are disturbed, drought comes. When your mind is agitated, practice withers.
The four yakshas at the corners of Meru's peak—raising-time palaces. You read of them controlling the seasons, bringing summer rain, autumn grain, flower-ripening, winter cold, spring warmth. But look at your own subtle body. Are there not four energy centers at four corners of your heart? Do they not regulate the seasons of your practice—times of growth, harvest, ripening, dormancy, and renewal? Your meditation has its seasons. Do not expect spring flowers in winter. Do not expect harvest in spring. Know the time.
The seven mother-goddesses who dwell in these regions, controlling individual action—these are the seven aspects of karma, the seven ways that your actions ripen. You are never free from their gaze. Every action you take, every thought you entertain—these goddesses record it, weave it into the fabric of your experience. But they are not external judges. They are your own awareness, naturally reflecting back to you the results of your conduct.
And the four great kings, sending disease and weapons, famine and prosperity—do you think these are external deities controlling the world? They are the four cardinal principles of existence: impermanence, suffering, non-self, and peace. When you forget impermanence, they send disease to remind you. When you grasp at self, they send weapons to shatter your fortress. When you are attached to pleasure, they send famine to show you the emptiness of satisfaction. When you practice virtue, they make good—prosperity arises as the natural result of your actions.
All of this is happening now, in your own experience. Do not look for it in some distant heaven. Look for it here.
COMMENTARY — Page 26 [916-954]
Now we come to the lower realms—the hells, pretas, animals. You read of hot hells and cold hells, of yama-soothed tortures and bubble-possessing sufferings. Your intellect may recoil, or it may become fascinated with the descriptions. But listen closely, you who would be free.
Where are these hells? Twenty thousand leagues below Mount Meru, the text says. But look at your own mind when anger arises—where is that anger located? Is it not burning you right now? Is it not a hot hell, immediate and intense? When you are consumed by hatred, you are in Yama's realm. When you are frozen by jealousy, you are in the cold hells. The text describes these as lasting for eons, but have you not experienced moments that seemed like eons when you were in the grip of rage?
The hells are not punishments imposed by an external deity. They are the natural results of the mind's poisons. Anger produces the experience of burning. Attachment produces the experience of hunger—this is the preta realm, where beings have mouths the size of needles and stomachs like mountains, never satisfied. Delusion produces the experience of blind suffering—this is the animal realm, where beings act on instinct without understanding.
You read of occasional hells, without definite location, existing variously in earth, water, fire, wind. These are the sudden bursts of suffering that come upon you without warning—a sharp pain, a shocking loss, a moment of terror. They have no fixed abode because they arise from the unpredictability of your own karma.
The demigods, asuras, dwelling in the hollow space below Meru's water-level—you picture them gazing up at the gods' paradise, consumed with jealousy. But look at your own mind when you see another's success. Do you not dwell in that same hollow space, looking up at what others have, resenting your own position? The demigods' constant war with the gods is your own envy, your own competitiveness, your inability to rejoice in others' virtue.
The gods on Meru's tiers, with their cities and pleasure-groves—you may think this sounds pleasant. But listen: the gods are those moments when you experience temporary pleasure, success, or meditative bliss, and you think "this is it, this is liberation." You dwell in your pleasure-grove, intoxicated by your own accomplishments. But you are still on Mount Meru. You have not transcended the world-system. You have only risen to a higher tier. And from that height, the fall is further.
The text mentions the great yaksha kings—Golden-foot, Powerful, Entering-existence, Glory Splendor, Mountain-raising, Supreme-existence. These are the great successes of worldly life, the achievements that make you feel powerful and glorious. But they are still yakshas—nature spirits, powerful but bound. They send disease and famine when their domains are threatened. Your worldly success, when clung to, becomes the cause of your suffering.
Do not seek to be born among the gods. Do not fear the hells. Recognize that all realms are mind. When anger arises, recognize its nature, and the hot hell is instantly cool. When craving arises, see its emptiness, and the preta finds food. When delusion arises, know it as wisdom, and the animal awakens. The transformation does not happen in some future life. It happens now, in the recognition of what is.
