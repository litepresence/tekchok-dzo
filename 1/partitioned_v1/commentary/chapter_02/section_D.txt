COMMENTARY — Page 39 [1341-1360]
The text continues the story of decline, but the original page 39 content appears to be truncated. Based on the pattern of Longchenpa's Treasury, this section continues describing the degeneration of the human condition and the arising of the need for dharma teachings.
---
You have read now of the world's formation, its structure, its inhabitants, and its eventual decline. From the highest formless realms down through the form realms, through the desire heavens, through the asura battles, to the human realm with its miraculous origins and gradual degeneration. What are you to make of all this?
Some will take it as mythology, as ancient cosmology to be compared with modern science. Some will take it as literal truth, clinging to every measurement, every name, every detail. Both miss the point.
The point is this: all worlds are mind. All realms are your own awareness taking different shapes. The hells are not below the earth; they are the burning of anger in your mind. The heavens are not above the clouds; they are the bliss of concentration when achieved. The human realm is not merely this planet; it is the condition of awareness that can choose—choose virtue or non-virtue, practice or distraction, awakening or continued wandering.
You are reading these words because you have the precious human body, the precious human life. Not the light-body of the first eon, but something more valuable: a body that suffers. A life that knows impermanence. A mind that can recognize its own nature precisely because it is not lost in endless bliss, not tormented by endless pain, but poised between, capable of understanding, capable of choice.
Do not waste this. Do not think "I will practice later, when conditions are better." The conditions are never better than now. The first humans had miraculous powers, immeasurable lifespan, natural bliss—and they still declined. Their conditions were perfect, and they still fell into duality, into grasping, into degeneration. You have imperfect conditions—limited lifespan, coarse body, distracted mind—and this is your advantage. You know impermanence. You know suffering. You know that nothing lasts. Use this knowledge.
The world-system described by Longchenpa is vast, complex, filled with details that could occupy a scholar for lifetimes. But you are not a scholar. You are a practitioner. Your task is not to memorize the names of the god realms or the measurements of Mount Meru. Your task is to recognize the nature of your own mind.
When you sit in meditation, you may experience bliss like the desire gods. You may achieve absorption like the form gods. You may enter clear light like the formless gods. Do not be seduced. Do not think "this is it." All these experiences are signposts, not destinations. They show you what is possible, but they are not liberation.
Liberation is recognition. Recognition that all these realms are empty. Recognition that the one who experiences them is empty. Recognition that experience itself is empty. Not empty like a void, but empty like space—open, clear, infinitely spacious, allowing all things to arise without obstruction, without grasping, without fixation.
This recognition is available now. Not when you achieve this or that meditation state. Not when you are reborn in a higher realm. Now. In this very moment, as you read these words, the nature of your mind is present, open, aware. It has never been separate from you. You have never been separate from it.
Rest in that. Let the world-system arise and dissolve. Let the gods ascend and fall. Let the humans multiply and decline. You remain, open and aware, the space in which all this play unfolds. This is the teaching of the Treasury. This is Longchenpa's gift. Do not squander it.
COMMENTARY — Page 40 [1361-1380]
Page 40 appears to be a continuation from the previous section on human degeneration. Let me provide commentary based on the thematic completion of this cosmological section.
---
So we come to the end of this section on the world-system's container and essence. You have traveled from the clear void before formation, through the arising of elements, the construction of Mount Meru, the establishment of realms from hell to heaven, and finally to the human condition with its miraculous origins and inevitable decline.
What now? What are you to do with this knowledge?
First, understand that this description is not merely ancient cosmology. It is a map of your own mind. The world-system is the system of your perceptions, your habits, your karmic patterns. The realms are the states you cycle through—not in some future life, but in this very day. In the morning, you may be in a god realm, feeling blissful and powerful. By noon, you are in an asura realm, fighting with colleagues, competing, jealous. By evening, you are in a hell realm, burning with anger or frozen by depression. Then sleep comes, and you enter the formless realms of dreamless absorption.
You cycle through all of this in twenty-four hours. You are a cosmological wanderer, a realm-traveler, never staying anywhere for long. And yet you think you are a solid person, living in a solid world, with a solid identity. Foolish one! You are nothing but flow. You are change itself.
Second, understand that liberation is not found in any of these realms. Not in the highest heaven, not in the deepest absorption. Liberation is found in recognizing that all realms are equally empty, equally mind-made, equally the play of awareness. When you recognize this, you are no longer bound by the realm you happen to be in. You can be in hell with the mind of a Buddha. You can be in heaven with the mind of a practitioner, not grasping, not clinging, using the favorable conditions but not seduced by them.
Third, understand the preciousness of the human realm. You have read how the gods, despite their bliss, are still bound. You have read how even the formless beings, despite their peace, eventually fall. Only humans have the perfect balance—the capacity for both suffering and bliss, the intelligence to understand the teachings, the motivation to practice. The gods are too comfortable. The hell beings are too tormented. The humans are in the middle, capable of turning toward the dharma.
But this capacity is not permanent. The text describes the decline of the human condition—lifespan shortening, body becoming coarse, merit exhausting. This is happening now. You can see it in the world around you. The degeneration is real. The opportunity is limited. Do not wait.
Finally, understand that all of this—the world-system, the realms, the gods, the humans, the teachings themselves—are like dreams, like illusions, like the moon reflected in water. They appear, they function, they have consequences, but they have no inherent existence. They are the play of your own mind. And the nature of that mind is emptiness and clarity inseparable, the dharmakaya itself.
To recognize that nature is the purpose of all these teachings. Not to become an expert in Buddhist cosmology. Not to win debates about the number of leagues to Mount Meru's peak. But to wake up. To see what is. To be free.
Longchenpa has laid it all out for you—the entire structure of samsara, from top to bottom. He has shown you where you are, where you have been, where you might go. Now it is up to you. Will you continue to wander? Or will you recognize the wanderer?
The choice is yours. It has always been yours. Make it wisely.
PAGE 41 COMMENTARY
Listen, you who sit here reading these words about the world's formation! Longchenpa traces for you the arising of this human realm, this Jambu continent where you now find yourself [1344-1369]. But what use is knowing how beings emerged from light-eggs and gradually degenerated, unless you see your own mind's degeneration right now?
You think you are different from those ancients who lived eighty-thousand years, who ate essence of earth like honey, who needed no clothes because their own light radiated seven fathoms clear? Look at yourself! Your light has dimmed to almost nothing. You need lamps in daytime, heaters in warmth, layers of cloth to cover your shame. This is not merely a story of ancient history—this is the story of your own mind's wandering!
When those first beings fell from light into desire, from desire into grasping, from grasping into stealing and killing—do you not see yourself in each step? [1370-1396] Every moment your mind chases after pleasure, you fall further. Every time you grasp at "mine," you sink deeper into this swamp of existence.
Longchenpa describes the hells arising from anger accumulated [1413-1428]—but you don't need to wait for death to experience hell. Feel your own rage, that burning that consumes you from within! That is the Reviving Hell right here, right now. The Preta realm of endless hunger—you know this when your desires can never be satisfied, when you accumulate and hoard yet remain empty [1444-1445].
Do not read this as mythology. Read this as your own biography written across vast time. The degeneration of light into darkness is happening in every moment you forget your true nature.
This world you cling to—this Jambu continent famous as the action-ground where karma ripens [1344-1369]—is itself the display of your own deluded mind. The vessels and essences, the continents and hells, all arise from the three poisons you harbor in your breast.
So what to do? Do not merely read. Look directly: Who is reading? What is this light that still knows, still sees, still understands these words? That knowing is itself the primordial radiance that never degenerated, never fell, never became clothed in flesh and karma. Rest there. Let the story of samsara be the story that points you back to what never entered the story at all.
PAGE 42 COMMENTARY
You sit there thinking about eons of increase and decrease, about the world forming and dissolving [1479-1512]. But listen—you who worry about past and future lives, about cosmic destruction by fire and water and wind: you are missing what is right here!
Seven suns arise to burn this world [1514-1529], but I tell you, your own anger burns hotter than any sun. The seven fires that reduce Mount Meru to ash—have you not felt such heat in your own heart when hatred consumes you? That burning is not practice for the future; it IS the burning now.
You read about beings transferring from hell to preta to animal realms [1500-1506], about humans gradually decreasing to ten years of life, dying by disease and weapons and famine. But look at your own mind's lifespan! How quickly your virtuous thoughts die. How fast your concentration degenerates. In the time it takes to read this page, how many times has your mind wandered to distraction, to worry, to planning?
The dissolution into space, into wind, into emptiness [1527-1530]—this is not something that happens only at the end of the eon. When you release your grasping right now, when you stop holding onto this solid "I," the world dissolves immediately. Not into nothingness, but into its true nature that was always present.
Longchenpa speaks of eighty-thousand years increasing again through abandoning the ten non-virtues [1462-1475]. You think this means ancient history? No! When you abandon killing in this very moment, when you release attachment NOW, your life extends immediately—not in years measured by clocks, but in the timeless expanse of awareness that is beyond birth and death.
The three lesser eons of weapons, famine, and disease [1477-1530] are happening in your mind right now. Mental weapons wound you constantly—criticism, judgment, aggression. Famine of wisdom starves you. The disease of delusion infects every perception.
Stop calculating eons. Stop measuring destruction. Turn your attention to the destroyer itself—this mind that creates and dissolves worlds. Meet it nakedly. What you find is not a thing that endures or perishes, but a knowing that has never been touched by fire, water, wind, or time.
PAGE 43 COMMENTARY
Now Longchenpa turns to the elements [1575-1622], and you must understand: earth, water, fire, wind, and space are not merely outer substances. They are your own body, your own experience, your own mind's display!
You feel solid—this is earth element holding you together [1595]. You feel emotions flowing—this is water element moving through you [1596]. You burn with anger or desire—this is fire element blazing [1597]. Your thoughts move constantly—this is wind element never still [1598]. And the space that allows all these to function? That is the space element, vast and open, holding the whole show [1599].
But here is what you must see: these elements do not exist out there separate from you. When you touch earth, you touch your own solidity. When you drink water, you drink your own flow. The fire that cooks your food is the same fire that digests it in your belly. The wind that moves the trees moves your breath. The space that holds the stars holds your awareness.
Longchenpa describes how outer elements produce the basis of body, how inner elements create the world you perceive [1601-1606]. This is not philosophy—this is direct pointing! When your mind is clear, the world is clear. When your mind is disturbed, the world appears disturbed. The elements are mind's own play, mind's own dance.
You think you live in a world made of matter? Look again! The form element arises from mindfulness [1621-1622]—from your own attention, your own holding of experience. Without the knowing, what form exists? Can you show me a form that is not known? Can you demonstrate an earth that is not perceived?
The elements gathered by outer objects and the elements gathered by inner mind [1607-1620]—these are not two. They are one display, like a dream where the mountain and the mind that dreams it cannot be separated. You are not in the world; the world is in you, as you, made of you.
So when you meditate on the elements, do not look outward. Feel the earth in your bones, the water in your blood, the fire in your warmth, the wind in your breath, the space in your awareness. Rest in that recognition, and the artificial boundary between self and world collapses like a frost-drawn circle in morning sun.
PAGE 44 COMMENTARY
Here Longchenpa lays out the aggregates, sense sources, and faculties [1623-1756], and you must not let this become mere academic study! These are not categories in a book—they are the very structure of your suffering right now.
The eighteen elements—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind consciousness, their objects, and the contact between them [1623-1666]—this is how you construct your prison moment by moment. You see a form, consciousness arises, contact happens, feeling follows, and immediately you are caught: "I like this, I don't like that."
Look at how it happens: The eye element arises from clear knowing [1646], the ear from single-pointed knowing [1647], and so forth. But what is this knowing? Is it inside you? Outside? Neither? When you truly look for where seeing happens, where hearing occurs, you cannot find a boundary. The sound and the hearing are one event, not two!
You think your senses connect you to the world? No! They create the illusion of separation. The sense sources expand as grasper and grasped [1706-1718]—subject and object—but this division is the original error. Like a mirror that seems to hold images but is never touched by them, your awareness appears to perceive objects while remaining forever pure and unaffected.
The faculties—eye faculty holding earth portion, ear holding wind, nose holding water [1744-1749]—again, these are not physical organs you can dissect. They are functions of knowing, ways that awareness modulates itself. Your physical eyes may fail, but the knowing that sees has never been damaged. Deafness does not touch the knowing that hears.
When Longchenpa speaks of the aggregates with thought and without thought [1667-1705], he is showing you that even liberation has been conceptually divided! But liberation is not an aggregate to be gathered or abandoned. It is the recognition that the one who gathers and abandons was never anything more than a fleeting thought.
So examine: Who possesses these faculties? Who owns these aggregates? Search thoroughly. When you cannot find an owner, rest in that not-finding. That openness is the faculty of wisdom itself [1755], beyond all division into six or sixty or eighty-four thousand.
PAGE 45 COMMENTARY
Now we come to the heart of delusion—actions and afflictions [1775-1831]. You read that aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleshas [1802-1809], and you must take this personally! Every moment of your life, you are creating the world you inhabit through the three poisons.
When you feel desire, you are not merely having a feeling—you are casting a vote for the desire realm, reinforcing the structures of attachment that bind beings. When anger arises, you are building hell realms, not in some future life but immediately, in the texture of your present experience. The hells are not locations; they are states of mind so contracted, so burning, so without relief, that we call them hell.
Longchenpa lists the six afflictions: ignorance, delusion, hatred, pride, attachment, jealousy [1824-1831]. Look at yourself! Which one rules you today? Is it the confusion that doesn't know what is truly happening? The anger that burns everything it touches? The pride that makes you separate and superior? The attachment that grasps and never lets go? The jealousy that poisons every relationship?
You think these are just emotions, just natural responses? No! They are the architects of samsara. Through these, you have built the world you suffer in. And the kicker is—you are doing it right now, even as you read these words. Is your mind grasping at understanding? Is there pride in knowing? Is there aversion to what challenges you?
The eighty-four thousand conceptual masses [1837] are not abstract categories. They are the individual thoughts you have every day, multiplied across all beings, creating a storm of confusion so vast it seems like the world itself. But the world IS that confusion, solidified, repeated, believed.
Yet Longchenpa gives the antidote: "All of these, although non-existent, are grasped as self—like a mirage, like water, like confusion, arising and grasping a snake where there is only a rope" [1842]. You who suffer so intensely from these afflictions—where are they now? In the past moment, they seemed so real, so solid. In this moment, can you find them? They are like dreams that terrify until you wake.
The rope has never been a snake. Your mind has never truly been afflicted. This is not optimism—it is the nature of things, waiting for you to recognize.
PAGE 46 COMMENTARY
Here Longchenpa begins the great teaching on vehicles [1865-1901], and you must understand: these vehicles are not paths you travel from here to there. They are ways of seeing, levels of recognition, and you may shift between them many times in a single day!
The worldly vehicle—the vehicle of gods and humans—is where most of you dwell. You accumulate merit, maintain virtue, and hope for better circumstances [1895-1896]. Nothing wrong with this! But do not mistake it for liberation. It is like cleaning your prison cell until it becomes comfortable—you are still in prison.
Then comes the mistaken vehicle [1900-1943], and Longchenpa is fierce here. Eternalists and nihilists, Samkhyas and Lokāyatas—you think these are ancient philosophies you can dismiss? No! You hold these views yourself! When you believe in a permanent soul, an unchanging self that persists through time, you are eternalist. When you think death is the end, that nothing continues, you are nihilist.
The Samkhyas speak of a self-nature hidden in the heart, white and oily, coiled like a serpent [1913-1935]. You search for this same self! You look for the "real you" somewhere inside, some essence that is truly yours. It is not there. It has never been there. The search itself is the delusion.
The Lokāyatas deny past and future lives, action and result [1944-2004]. You also deny karma when you think your actions have no consequences, when you believe you can harm others without consequence to yourself. The materialists say mind arises from elements meeting—heat and moisture producing consciousness like maggots from rotting flesh. Do you not sometimes feel this way? That you are just chemistry, just biology, just random processes with no deeper meaning?
Longchenpa lists hundreds of wrong views [2023-2092], but do not get lost in the catalog. The point is simple: any view that grasps at permanence or interruption, that establishes something as truly existent or truly non-existent, is a deviation. The only correct view is the view that transcends all views—not by negating them, but by seeing through the one who holds them.
You are not a Samkhya, not a Lokāyata, not a Buddhist or non-Buddhist. These are clothes you try on. What remains when all costumes are removed? That is what you must discover.
PAGE 47 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa continues his relentless exposure of wrong views [2100-2164], and you must feel the urgency here! Every one of these three hundred sixty views is a trap you could fall into, a way of thinking that promises liberation but delivers only more bondage.
Look at how he describes the cutting of flesh, the jumping from cliffs, the burning of bodies with fire [2273-2283]—these extreme ascetic practices performed in the name of spirituality. You may not be wrapping yourself in cloth soaked with sesame oil and setting yourself ablaze, but what are you doing to yourself in the name of practice? Are you pushing until you break? Are you making your spiritual life another form of self-punishment?
The tirthikas who declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed [2350-2364]—these are not just ancient heretics. They are your own mind when it gives up, when it says "nothing matters," when it falls into nihilism disguised as wisdom. Beware! The true Dharma never severs anything. It reveals that there was never anything to sever.
When Longchenpa speaks of those who "wield evil mantras as chief, performing fierce destructive rites" [2324], or those who "take divination and prophecy as chief, caring only for this world's happiness" [2324], he is warning you about spiritual materialism. Are you using practice to get what you want? To harm your enemies? To predict the future? Then you have become what he describes.
The four types he identifies—extreme view, extreme end, distant benefit, indifference [2401-2411]—cover all the mistakes. Eternal permanence at one pole, complete annihilation at the other, with various compromises in between. Where do you stand? Probably you oscillate between them, sometimes believing in something permanent, sometimes believing in nothing at all.
The purpose of teaching all this [2425] is so you do not enter wrong paths. But how do you know what is wrong? Wrong is anything that requires you to grasp at a view, to establish a position, to become something. The right path is the path that dissolves the path-walker, that reveals no one ever needed to go anywhere.
So read these lists not as history but as diagnosis. Find your own tendencies here. Then let them go. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. Rest there.
