[1-4] Look here, you who seek liberation! Before Longchenpa utters a single word of teaching, he first bows to the source of all—Samantabhadra. This is not mere politeness, like tipping your hat to a stranger. This is recognition that whatever you will read in these pages, whatever realization you might achieve, it all flows from this primordial awareness that has never been apart from your own mind. The title itself—"Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle"—is a direct pointing. Don't skim over it looking for the "real" teaching to begin later. This IS the teaching. The supreme vehicle is not some advanced course you take after graduating from lesser vehicles. It is the recognition that everything you've been searching for has been right here, from the very beginning.
[11-15] Ah, now look how the master bows to the fivefold mandala of enlightenment! Samantabhadra—the one whose nature holds all perfections—is not some distant god sitting on a throne judging your spiritual progress. He is your own awareness in its naked state, complete and lacking nothing. The five families, the vidyadharas, the ocean of Dharma—all of these are aspects of your own mind's display. When Longchenpa prostrates to them, he is showing you how to bow to your own true nature. Not with your forehead to the floor while your mind wanders to dinner plans, but with the recognition that prostrator and prostrated are not two.
[16-19] Here is the heart of it, my friends! "From the primordial pure"—gdod nas rnam dag—this is not describing some distant past when everything was nice and clean before things got messy. Primordial purity means right now, in this very moment, your awareness is untouched by all the conceptual constructions you've been carrying around like a backpack full of rocks. Where do all elaborations cease? Not in some future meditation retreat, not after you've fixed all your problems. They cease into space—into the open, unobstructed nature of mind itself. And this isn't something you achieve through effort or practice. It is "spontaneously accomplished"—lhun grub—meaning it has never been otherwise.
[20-27] Longchenpa now tells us why he's writing this text. Listen carefully! From the stainless sun of Dharma, the unsurpassed secret Vajra vehicle emerges—the very pinnacle of the Great Perfection. This is Ati Yoga, the most profound teaching. But don't let the fancy words fool you into thinking this is about complexity or sophistication. The Great Perfection is great because it is so simple, so immediate, that the mind keeps missing it while looking for something more complicated. "Revealing the essence of suchness directly"—this means pointing right at what you're experiencing NOW, without the filters of interpretation, judgment, or analysis. He's asking for protection of the lotus-throne of his mind. You should make the same request—for the recognition to remain stable in your own experience.
[28-35] Now the master begins the actual autocommentary. Notice how he explains the three kayas—the three bodies of enlightenment. This is crucial for understanding Dzogchen view. The Dharma-body (chos sku) is the nectar of reality itself—not a body in any physical sense, but the empty, luminous nature of all phenomena. The Enjoyment-body (longs sku) is the complete display of that nature in all its richness. The Emanation-body (sprul sku) is how that display manifests to benefit beings. But here's what you must understand: these are not three separate things, like three people in a room. They are three aspects of a single reality—like how water can be ice, liquid, or steam. The text explains that these are classified through the teacher, the place, and the teaching itself. Don't get lost in the classifications! They are fingers pointing to the moon of direct recognition.
[34-35] "The basis of perfect place, dharmata luminous-clarity"—this is ground zero, my friends. Everything that will be explained in this text rests upon recognizing this dharmata, this suchness, this luminous clarity that is the nature of your own mind. It is uncompounded—meaning it was never created and cannot be destroyed. It is spontaneously manifesting as the display of qualities in the precious realm. This isn't philosophy. This is a description of your own experience, right here, right now. Stop reading and look—what is aware of these words? That awareness is what Longchenpa is pointing to. Everything else in this text is just elaboration on this single point.
[36-40] Now Longchenpa unfolds the threefold mandala of enlightenment, and you must pay close attention here! First, there's Samantabhadra—the Dharmakaya teacher—not sitting somewhere in outer space, but "abiding in the intention where body and wisdom are inseparable." What does this mean for you? It means that right now, as you read these words, there is an awareness that knows the reading. That awareness IS the Dharmakaya. It's not somewhere else you need to go. It's not something you achieve through years of practice. It's what's already looking through your eyes this very moment.
The text speaks of "the time beyond action and effort in dharmata." This is crucial! Most spiritual paths tell you to DO something—meditate, visualize, recite mantras. But here Longchenpa is pointing to what is already the case, beyond all doing. The "subtle inner clarity-wisdom" that abides in the primordial sphere—this is rigpa, awareness. Not the awareness that comes and goes, not the awareness that gets distracted or concentrated, but the natural, naked awareness that has been present since before you had a name.
[41-45] From this nature, through blessing, the field of dense arrangement self-appears. Don't think this is talking about some heavenly realm you might visit after death! The five lights, the five families, the mandala play—all of this is describing the richness of your own awareness when it's recognized. When you look at the world right now, you're seeing the five lights. When you meet different people, you're meeting the five families. It's all self-appearing, spontaneously accomplished. The text says it appears "beyond even the objects of action of pure trainees"—meaning even advanced practitioners might miss this if they're still looking for something to achieve or somewhere to go.
[46-51] Now comes the Sambhogakaya level—Akanishta, the Dense Array. The sixth teacher Vajradhara arises with all the marks of perfection. Vidyadharas, dakinis, accomplished ones—all gathered in inconceivable numbers. And what does he teach? The ocean-like tantra sections of the result-vajra vehicle. Listen carefully: Akanishta is not a place you travel to. It's the dimension of richness and completeness that opens when you recognize awareness. The dakinis aren't exotic women flying through the sky—they're the dynamic, playful energy of awareness itself. The tantras aren't ancient books to be studied—they're the direct pointing to the nature of mind.
[52-56] From this richness, the nirmanakaya appears—emanation bodies manifesting as perfect teachers who guide beings according to their capacity. This is how compassion functions. When your awareness is recognized, it naturally manifests in ways that benefit others. The text mentions the three baskets—sutra, vinaya, abhidharma—appearing as various vehicles. This is the skillful means aspect. The Buddha didn't just teach one thing to everyone. He taught different things to different people based on what they could understand and what would actually help them. But all of these are ultimately pointers to the same recognition.
[57-58] Here's the crucial distinction! The three vehicles of causal characteristics—the sutra vehicles—are shown as causes and methods for entering the vajra vehicle. But the secret mantra vajra vehicle, the peak of complete perfection, is Dzogchen itself. This is the result vehicle, the unsurpassable teaching. Don't misunderstand this as hierarchy or elitism! It's not that Dzogchen practitioners are better than sutra practitioners. It's that Dzogchen points directly to the result—the recognition of awareness itself—rather than treating it as something to be achieved in the future. Both paths lead to the same place, but Dzogchen takes you there immediately. Like the difference between walking around a mountain and being transported to the top—you end up at the same summit, but one way is more direct.
[59-61] Longchenpa now points to the definitive place—the teaching of luminous-clarity, the vajra-essence. Don't glaze over when you read "vajra-essence"! This is not abstract philosophy. The vajra-essence is the indestructible nature of your own awareness. It cannot be destroyed by anything, not even by your worst confusion or most intense emotion. It's what's reading these words right now—that knowing quality that has never stopped, even for a moment, since before you were born. When he calls it the "great complete vajra place of the unsurpassable secret," he's pointing to the fact that this awareness is the secret essence of all Buddhas' minds. Not because it's hidden, but because it's so obvious, so immediately present, that we keep overlooking it while searching for something more exotic.
[62-71] Now comes a quotation from the Treasury of the Secret King, describing how enlightenment unfolds. Listen to this carefully—it's describing your own mind! "After the primordial protector's manifest enlightenment"—this isn't talking about something that happened long ago to someone else. It's describing how awareness recognizes itself. The "ocean of manners in which fields are arranged"—all the various ways that realization can appear, all the different mandalas and pure lands—these are just descriptions of the different facets of awareness when it's recognized.
The text speaks of the "complete sovereign teacher, Samantabhadra himself" arising from the primordial basis. Who is this Samantabhadra? He's not a historical figure. He's the primordial nature of your own mind. The "awareness of self-arising wisdom"—this is rigpa, awareness that knows itself without any subject-object duality. The "three self-arising dharmas" refer to the three aspects of this recognition: the essence (empty), the nature (luminous), and the compassion (unobstructed). "Great primordial purity, the end-place of beginning"—this is kadag, primordial purity, meaning pure from the very beginning, not purified through effort.
[72-75] From this recognition, the field pervaded by five wisdoms self-appears. The five wisdoms aren't achievements you accumulate—they're the natural qualities of awareness when it's recognized. The five families aren't foreign entities—they're the five aspects of your own enlightened nature. When the text says "abiding beyond the trainee's objects," it's saying that even if you've been practicing for decades, if you're still looking for this as something to achieve or somewhere to go, you're missing it. It's already the case.
"Then, long after, from the primordial basis arising as basis-appearance, seeing beings move like dreams, appearing like confusion without cause of confusion"—here's the description of compassion arising. When awareness recognizes itself, it naturally sees through the illusion of separation. Beings appear as dreamlike, confused without any real cause for confusion. This isn't looking down on beings as inferior—it's seeing that their suffering is based on a fundamental misunderstanding that has no real substance. And from this seeing, compassionate mind arises naturally, without being manufactured or forced. The "arranging fields for the purpose of beings" is how awareness naturally manifests to benefit whatever appears.
[76-87] Now the text describes the elaborate mandala of the five families with their symbols—the wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, and crosswise arrangements. Twenty-five fields appear from the lotus-born, with perfume-water flowing from pore-holes like great oceans. Earth, water, fire, wind pervading all places... Don't get lost in the poetic imagery here! This isn't describing some distant Buddha-field you'll visit after death if you're good enough. This is a description of the richness of your own awareness when it's fully recognized.
The five elements—earth, water, fire, wind— pervading with their subtle particles everywhere, along with the Buddha's blessings and beings' karma creating different fields. Round, four-cornered, crescent, semi-circle—immeasurable forms and arrangements. Don't think these are just describing some cosmic geography! These shapes are describing how awareness manifests. Round like completeness, four-cornered like stability, crescent like waxing and waning, semi-circle like partial recognition. All of it inconceivable, immeasurable—not because it's too complex for your mind, but because it transcends conceptual measurement entirely.
[88-98] Round fields, four-cornered fields, crescent fields, semi-circular fields—forms and arrangements immeasurable, inconceivable, appearing. This is the play of awareness! Every possible configuration manifesting spontaneously. And then the text says something crucial: "To the extent that sky pervades, to that extent body, speech, mind, qualities, activities, and fields arising from those pervade." This is describing the boundless nature of awareness itself.
There's no limit to it. It's not contained in your skull. It's not limited by time or space. The Buddha's body pervades everywhere, the Buddha's speech is all sounds, the Buddha's mind is all awareness, the Buddha's qualities are all positive qualities, the Buddha's activities are all benefit that occurs. This isn't metaphor—this is describing how things actually are when seen clearly, serving the purpose of beings in the perpetual continuous wheel without interruption.
[99-105] "This is the training field and activities of the one, the first Samantabhadra." The first Samantabhadra is the Dharmakaya—the body of reality itself. Not a person, not a being, but the nature of reality as it is. "Vast like the dharma-sphere and the sky-field"—the dharmadhatu, the field of all phenomena, is as vast as space itself. It has no center and no edge. It has no beginning and no end.
The text emphasizes this: from this first time only having arisen—years and eons, the field-particles like an ocean cannot be measured. Finally, these activities being complete, the latter end cannot be measured. This is the great field-ocean possessing the essence of unmoving spontaneity—the Buddha naturally spontaneously accomplished, lama of all samsara and nirvana, having come in beginningless time, arranging fields as three different appearances of the three bodies.
[106-111] Longchenpa now gives the three specific field names. In the time of dharma-body, it's called the field of luminous-clarity vajra-essence—emphasizing the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. In the time of self-appearing enjoyment-complete body, it's called the field of Brahma's drum-sound—referencing the cosmological sound-vibration underlying all manifestation. In the time of emanation-body, it's called the great-Brahma eon field—connecting to cyclical cosmology while indicating its supramundane nature.
But remember—these aren't three separate places! They're three ways of describing the same reality from different perspectives. Like how water can be described as H2O, as wetness, or as waves—same substance, different aspects. In this sense, the emanation Buddha of Samantabhadra himself, and those teachers who came in the three times, becoming Buddha through that blessing—all are manifestations of this single nature, appearing differently according to what needs to be tamed.
[112-114] Let me repeat this because it's so crucial: "All sentient-beings' realms exist. The training-field is very vast." Your life, right now, with all its problems and pleasures, is the training field. You're not waiting for some better circumstances to practice. You're not waiting until you finish this project or solve that problem. This very moment, with all its chaos and confusion, is the mandala of enlightenment. The question is: do you recognize it or not?
[115-125] "Numberless fields beyond measure appear even in one particle-place of sentient-beings' confused appearance." Think about this! In every tiny experience, infinite worlds are present. When you look at a speck of dust, Buddhas are teaching there. Pure lands are manifesting there. Hell realms and god realms are both present. How? Because these aren't physical locations—they're different ways that the display of awareness can be perceived based on different karmic conditioning.
The text describes how to pure karma, Buddha's activities appear variously—teaching, dwelling in nirvana, enjoying bliss-fruit. But to impure karma, the same space appears as lower realms, suffering, destruction. It's like how in a dream, the same room can appear as a palace or a prison depending on the dreamer's mind. The space itself doesn't change—only the perception changes.
[125-134] Now comes the quotation from the Arya Samadhi King Sutra, and you should read this as a direct description of your own experience, not as mythology. "Even in the extent of a hair-tip, many Buddhas, as many as the sands of the Ganga river..." Your body is filled with infinite Buddhas. Every cell is a Buddha-field. Every moment contains infinite eons. This is the actual nature of reality, not a poetic exaggeration. The reason you don't see it is because you're looking through the lens of conceptual mind, which collapses the infinite into finite categories.
The sutra describes how in the same space, hell-beings experience suffering while gods experience bliss, without mixing or becoming harmful. This is describing the interpenetration of all phenomena—the fact that multiple realities can coexist in the same space without contradiction when you drop the notion of solid, separate things. It's like how multiple radio stations can broadcast through the same space without interfering with each other—you just tune to different frequencies.
[135-161] "In that place, many mountains... unbearable hell-beings experiencing unpleasantness... gods' palaces... twelve leagues of pleasantness..." All of this is happening right now, in your direct experience. Not somewhere else, not in some other dimension, but right here. The same awareness that knows these words is the awareness that experiences all of these realms. There's no fundamental separation between you and any being in any realm. The only difference is the karmic perception—the particular way that awareness is manifesting based on causes and conditions.
"Humans in their own houses like dreams, intoxicated with joy in desire-qualities, waking after, not seeing that desire. That is known as dream by that." This is you! You're walking around in your own house, your own life, completely absorbed in the play of desire, not recognizing it as a dream. But the moment you wake up—when rigpa recognizes itself—you see that all of it was just the display of awareness, never separate from the nature of mind. The desire wasn't real. The grasping wasn't real. The suffering wasn't real. Only awareness is real, and it was never apart from you.
"Thus seeing, hearing, knowing, and distinguishing differences, all these are untrue, like dreams." Your entire world—everything you see, hear, think, feel—is like a dream. It appears, it functions, it has consequences, but ultimately it's empty of inherent existence. It's the play of awareness, manifesting in infinite forms, but never separate from its own nature. This isn't nihilism—it's not saying nothing exists. It's saying that what exists is the display of awareness, which is luminous and empty inseparably. And that display is happening right here, right now, as your own direct experience.
[163-175] Now Longchenpa quotes from the Sutra of Entering the Buddha Realm, and you need to understand what these comparisons are pointing to. The gods and humans of three-thousand worlds are "very few" compared to what a sage with clairvoyance can see. This isn't a census report! It's showing you how limited ordinary perception is. Your everyday awareness is like looking through a keyhole—you see a tiny slice of reality and think that's all there is.
The text builds up through different levels of perception—shravakas, bodhisattvas, meditators—each seeing more than the last. But the Tathagata's eye sees across all of it. What is this Tathagata's eye? It's not a physical eye. It's awareness itself when it recognizes its own nature. When rigpa knows itself, it sees without limits, without obstruction. "Wherever sky pervades, in those places sentient-beings pervade"—this is describing the boundless compassion and perception of awakened awareness.
[176-191] Longchenpa is now addressing a technical point about how tantras arose. Some people think different tantras came from different sources at different times. But the Magical Vairotsana tantra refutes this—the first Buddha is Vajradhara, "Buddha before all Buddhas." This isn't historical chronology; it's pointing to the primordial nature of awareness that has never not been enlightened. The "first" Buddha is the Dharmakaya itself—the nature of reality that was never born and never dies.
The text describes how Samantabhadra manifests through emanations, displaying as ordinary beings who generate bodhicitta and demonstrate Buddhahood. This is describing how the display of awareness functions. From the perspective of the absolute, there's no separation between Buddhas and beings. Buddhas appear in order to guide beings, but they're not different in essence from the beings they guide. It's all the play of awareness recognizing itself.
[180-191] The second section discusses Vajradhara's manner of obtaining peace. The view that different tantras generated different minds is invalid because Vajradhara is Buddha before all Buddhas. This is subtle but crucial—don't think of tantras as competing philosophies or different religious traditions. They're all describing the same reality from different angles, like how physicists might describe light as both waves and particles. The reality itself is one; the descriptions are many.
