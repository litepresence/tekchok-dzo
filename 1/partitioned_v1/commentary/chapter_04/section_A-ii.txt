Third: sound's letter is: speech—speaking ones (lines 1-3). Cause: root letters, wind-moved, arise (line 5). Condition: tongue and palate's action, arise (line 7).
Listen! Sound is not separate from the one who speaks. The root letters are moved by wind—the wind of prana, the energy of awareness. The tongue and palate are the conditions. This is the dependent arising of speech—wind moves, conditions meet, sound emerges. But from where? From nowhere! From the same emptiness from which all things emerge.
That also: within, A-like arises, throat: KA etc. arise, tongue-tip: TA THA etc. arise, tongue-tip and palate two meet: crown arises—called so (lines 9-13). RA LA-like: tongue and palate strongly joined: ṬA ṬHA arise (lines 15-15). Lips: PA PHA BA BHA MA said like—these sounds: whatever expressed, arise depending on those places (lines 17-19).
Each sound has its place of arising—throat, tongue-tip, palate, crown, lips. This is the anatomical structure of sacred speech. But more than anatomy, it is the energetic structure. The sounds arise in specific locations because those locations correspond to different energies, different aspects of awareness.
Fourth: ultimate result's letter is: Buddha's speech, sixty vowels, appear—from enjoyment-body's channels, abodes, pure letters (lines 21-25). Letters emanated: in sky, dharma-sounds famous (line 27). Letters emanated: Buddha's body etc. become, sentient beings' benefit performing (lines 29-29). Enjoyment-body and emanation-body's root letters: wisdom five's appearance adorned (lines 31-31).
This existing: depending, Buddha-time, sūtras and tantras enumerate measureless sentient beings appear (lines 33-33). Emanation: sentient beings' benefit arising (lines 35-35).
Second: abodes definite, specifically explained—five: root letters briefly shown, branch prefixes extensively divided, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa explained manner definite, abode enjoyment explained, those expression manner shown (lines 37-57).
First: KA A KHA GA NGA / CA CHA JA VA / ṬA ṬHA ḌA ṆA / TA THA DA NA / PA PHA BA MA / YA RA LA / ṢA ṢA SA HA KṢAḤ (lines 59-73).
The thirty-four consonants. These are not arbitrary! Each contains an entire universe of meaning. KA—the first, the primordial. A—the life-giver. Each letter is a complete mandala. Each sound is a complete teaching.
When you recite these, do not just make sounds! Recognize that each sound is the expression of awareness, each vibration is the play of wisdom. The letters are not external to you. They are the very structure of your being.
KKA GHA JHA ḌHA DHA BHA—abodes thirty-four letters all gathered shown (lines 1-3). Those meanings joined, definite (line 5).
From Rigpa Rangshar (line 7)—A HO, nearby retinue, listen! I explain well—hold in mind (lines 9-11). Buddhas all's intention is: words and letters not existing—words and letters appear like (lines 13-17). Yet words' meaning greatly liberates (line 19). That also gathered in letters' syllables (line 21). Those meanings explained thus (line 23):
Cause producing all letters: KA: perfectly complete, famous (lines 25-27). All dharmas' limit gathered: letter A: complete (lines 29-31). All dharmas' sky: letter KHA: complete (lines 33-35). All dharmas' stainless: letter GA: complete (lines 37-39). All dharmas' awareness: letter NGA: complete (lines 41-43). All dharmas' play: letter CA: complete (lines 45-47). All dharmas' stainless: letter CHA: complete (lines 49-51). All dharmas' appearance: letter JA: complete (lines 53-55). All dharmas' experience: letter VA: complete (lines 57-59). All dharmas' eternal: letter ṬA: complete (lines 61-63). All dharmas' maṇḍala: letter ṬHA: complete (lines 65-67). All dharmas' cut: letter ḌA: complete (lines 69-71). All dharmas' self-body: letter ṆA: complete (lines 73-75). All dharmas' teaching: letter TA: complete (lines 77-79). All dharmas' empty: letter THA: complete (lines 81-83). All dharmas' awareness: letter DA: complete (lines 85-87). All dharmas' ignorance: letter NA: complete (lines 89-91). All dharmas' basis-mother: letter PA: complete (lines 93-95). All dharmas' dharmakāya: letter PHA: complete (lines 97-99). All dharmas' saṃbhogakāya: letter BA: complete (lines 101-103). All dharmas' nirmāṇakāya: letter MA: complete (lines 105-107). All dharmas' empty path: letter YA: complete (lines 109-111). All dharmas' placement method: letter RA: complete (lines 113-115). Dharma's three instants: letter LA: complete (lines 117-119). All dharmas' cessationless: letter ṢA: complete (lines 121-123). All dharmas' wisdom: letter ṢA: complete (lines 125-127). All dharmas' manner: letter SA: complete (lines 129-131). All dharmas' severance: letter HA: complete (lines 133-135). All dharmas' discriminating wisdom: letter KṢAḤ: complete (lines 137-139). All dharmas' compassion: letter KKA: complete (lines 141-143). All dharmas' nature: letter GHA JHA ḌHA DHA BHA: complete (lines 145-147).
Thus letters' meanings joined—all thus to be known (lines 149-151). Thus it is spoken (line 153).
Do you see the profundity? Each letter contains all dharmas! KA is perfectly complete. A is the limit of all dharmas. This is not mere symbolism. This is the recognition that each sound, each vibration, is the complete expression of reality. When you recite KA, you are expressing perfect completeness. When you recite A, you are expressing the limitlessness of dharmas.
But do not get lost in the letters! The Buddha's intention is clear: words and letters not existing, yet words' meaning greatly liberates (lines 13-19). The letters are like a raft. Use them to cross, then do not carry them on your back.
Second: branch prefixes, explained, divided—two: root prefix explanation, branch prefix explanation (lines 155-157).
Root prefix explanation, branch prefix explanation (lines 1-3). First: root letters thirty-four's context made, NYA and WA two breaths—one made here (lines 5-9). Prefix NYA and single WA arranged, these long A and not-uniform double-stacked (lines 11-15).
Listen, you who are confused by Sanskrit grammar! The prefixes are not mere linguistic decorations. They are the energetic modifiers, the conditions that shape the root awareness. NYA and WA—breath sounds. The breath of life, the wind of prana.
Single appearing, breath great within—meaning double-stacked abiding (line 17). Separately arranged thus: A KṢA KHA GHA DHA / CCA CHA JA JHA ÑĀ / ṬṬĀ ṬHĀ ḌṆA ḌHA ÑĀ / TA THA DA DHA NĀ / PĀ A PHA KHA BHA BHA MĀ A / YĀ ṢĀ RA LA MĀ ṢA BHA ṢA HA MĀ / KṢAḤ: these prefixes with reality joined (lines 19-33).
Appearance-emptiness, method-wisdom, father-mother, sphere-wisdom—pure and spontaneous individually joined explained existing (lines 35-43).
From Rangshar (line 45): thus letters' meanings joined, reality-basis thus applied. That prefix's power explained (lines 47-51). Thus it is spoken (line 53).
The prefixes joined with reality! Appearance-emptiness, method-wisdom, father-mother, sphere-wisdom. These are not abstract philosophical pairs. They describe the structure of your own experience. Every appearance is empty. Every method is wisdom in expression. Every father is mother, every mother is father—non-dual.
Second: root letters those to: NA RO, GU GU, DRENG BU, YA-tagged, RA-tagged—five tagged: awareness, wisdom five's self-light etc. shown—manner thus (lines 55-71).
These letter types—please examine carefully (line 1 of next section). Stacked letters 1. Note: these letters' nature double-stacked is prefix, root prefix (lines 3-7). NA RO etc. are called "branch." "Prefix of prefix" called (lines 9-11).
Explanation manner: roots earlier syllable-joined, explained (line 13). Letters RA and LA: two, CA-tag not, others all obtained—explained (lines 15-17).
Also from Rangshar (line 19): all branches thus are. Explanation manner this like: prefix and branch connection—explanation manner prefix explains. Letter's syllable meaning applies. Letter's explanation manner: sound-like explained. Letter RA: CA not. Letter's example, symbol meaning joined—thus all abiding (lines 21-37). Thus it is spoken (line 39).
Third: saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's explanation manner, definite—two: saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's explanation manner (lines 41-43).
First: tantra's occasion, prefixless letters: saṃsāra's dharmas, own awareness arise—explained (lines 45-47). That also: KA-like, saṃsāra's primordial sphere, deluded, established, ignorance etc., kleśas' collections, with—called, etc.—explained (lines 49-51).
Prefix and branch: whatever arisen, nirvāṇa—explained (lines 53-53). That also: prefix arisen, appearance-emptiness etc., dual explained, branch arisen: kāyas five etc., five-group, three-group, six-group etc., branch's number suitable—explained (lines 55-57).
Also from Rangshar (line 59): there, letters all's explanation manner types two gathered: nirvāṇa-letter explanation manner and saṃsāra's letters explanation manner (lines 61-67). Nirvāṇa's letters: prefix and branch—explained (lines 69-71). Impure saṃsāra's letters: first MA—explained (lines 73-75).
Thus explanation manner types two by, letters all's meanings liberated (lines 77-79). Thus it is spoken (line 81).
Do you understand? Samsara and nirvana are distinguished by the presence or absence of prefixes! Prefixless letters are samsara—the root without modification. With prefixes and branches, nirvana—the enlightened expression. Yet both arise from the same letters! This is the non-duality of samsara and nirvana.
Fourth: letters' abode and enjoyment explained (line 83). Prefix and branch all-complete time (line 85).
Explained now the not-circulating portion of the first root-letter's mother (line 1). That prefix which has arisen up to that point is the abodes beyond nirvāṇa (line 3). When expressing, that vowel should be joined to that prefix and recited together (line 5).
The nature of letters and the prefix branches are the abodes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa (line 7). The prefixes and branches also arise as the enjoyment of the consort letters (line 9).
There the consort's above existing prefix's letters are the GU GU light letters: GRENG BU, the path. NA RO, the sphere. KLAD KOR, the dharmatā letters. Thus the four existing above are called the lamp letters (lines 11-19).
The four lamps arise from the eyes in the upper head of the body, like [images] in a mirror (line 20). The prefix below is the basis letter. The YA-tagged is the pervading letter. The RA-tagged is the arising letter. The foot-hook is the compassion letter. These also arise from self-arisen [wisdom] (lines 21-31).
The abode and enjoyment of letters should be known thus for all (line 33).
There the prefixes and branches: GU GU light letter explained. GRENG BU path letter explained. NA RO sphere letter explained. KLAD KOR dharmatā letter explained. Those four above letters are the lamp letters as accepted (lines 35-43).
Foot-hook compassion letter explained. YA-tagged pervading letter explained. RA-tagged arising letter explained (lines 45-49). There the prefix which has arisen is explained joined to the prefix. Thus it is spoken (lines 51-51).
These letters in such collections are symbols (line 53). Like when many threads are tied to many fingers of someone's many messages (lines 55-55). The meaning indicates the basis of dharmas, path and result, sphere, wisdom, and so forth of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa (lines 57-57).
The fifth shows two expression manners of those (line 59). The abode and expression manner are shown generally, and the near-sound expression is explained in particular (lines 61-63). The first two: the common abode's arrangement and... (lines 65-65).
Listen carefully! The letters are not just for recitation. They are symbols, like threads carrying messages. Each letter, each prefix, each branch points to aspects of reality—basis, path, result, sphere, wisdom, samsara, nirvana.
The four above letters are the lamp letters—GU GU (light), GRENG BU (path), NA RO (sphere), KLAD KOR (dharmata). These are the four lamps that arise from the eyes, like images in a mirror. Do you see? The visual experience is not separate from the letters. The light you see is the light letter. The path you walk is the path letter.
And the three below—the YA-tagged pervading letter, RA-tagged arising letter, foot-hook compassion letter. These are the active principles. Pervading everywhere, arising spontaneously, expressing compassion.
The letters are the structure of your being. Not something to be learned intellectually, but to be recognized in direct experience. When you see light, recognize it as GU GU. When you walk the path, recognize it as GRENG BU. This is not superstition. This is the recognition that all experience is sacred, all appearance is letter, all sound is mantra.
Now explained the sequence of long and short, heavy and light (line 1). The first is this: in whatever tantra, however letters of mantra may appear, whether stacked or single, the inverted letters are placed wherever appropriate at the root, and whatever prefix has arisen, the inverted [letter] is joined to the palate at the tip of the tongue, expressed directly without inversion, as it is called (lines 3-9). Like ṬA to TA, and so forth (line 11).
The branches are also joined appropriately to the mother [letter] and expressed (line 13). These are read combined together as one life-force and kindred class, like K+KA, like K+AÜ (lines 15-19). Not as single [letters] but each separately expressed, like G+HAJA and so forth (lines 21-23).
This also [comes] from Rigpa Rangdrol: the letters' mantra are thus: the inverted, the prefix, and the branches are all expressed here as they are, and each is pronounced as appropriate (lines 25-31). The inverted [letter] is tagged and becomes manifest. The mother herself is placed as basis. The branches are nirvāṇa letters. The prefix is only saṃsāra. Thus mantras and letters, each is pronounced as appropriate. Thus it is spoken (lines 33-41).
This also [comes] from Rangshar: the non-saṃsāric is explained, the prefix and branches are nirvāṇa's letters explained (lines 43-47). From Rigpa Rangdrol, the mother is not placed as basis: the prefix is saṃsāra and the branches are nirvāṇa—these two explanations are not contradictory but are understood according to context (lines 47-49).
At that time, when saṃsāra's sentient beings are pervaded by the Buddha's essence, and sentient beings are taken as basis, the letters' mother is made saṃsāric, so the prefix and branches are understood as saṃsāra (lines 51-53).
When the nature of awareness separates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the manner of distinction and completeness, that mother is shown as awareness and placed as basis: the prefix is explained as saṃsāra and the branches are expressed as the dharmas of nirvāṇa (lines 55-55).
In their nature they are always joined together, for they are designations without inherent existence (line 57). When impure saṃsāra is indicated, the root letter is taken as the mind of pride (lines 57-59).
The prefix and branch above [the letter] exist as karma and afflictions, aggregates and elements, sense-fields and elements, grasping and so forth—and are also explained thus (lines 61-63 of next section).
When pure nirvāṇa is explained, that mother letter is self-arisen wisdom, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the three kāyas, five wisdoms, five lights, and ten powers (lines 1-3 of next section).
When saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are both explained on one basis, that mother letter is awareness itself, and the prefix and branch are explained as the dharmas of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa (lines 5-5).
When the basis is explained, that mother letter is awareness, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the essential nature, compassion, and the five winds (lines 7-7).
When the path is explained, that mother letter is the basis-nature, the essence of the heart, which is the nature of the threefold compassion; and the prefix and branch are also explained as the four lamps of basis-appearance and the four appearances (lines 9-9).
When the result is explained, that mother letter is the Buddha's mind, self-arisen wisdom and branch are also; and the prefix explained as the kāyas, wisdoms, qualities, and activities (lines 11-11).
In brief, whatever meaning is shown, the chief one is the mother letter at that time of explanation, and its retinue—the prefix and branch—should be explained (lines 13-13).
The second, the sequence of long-short and heavy-light, is explained as follows, from Rigpa Rangdrol: sound is shown in four aspects: long, short, very long, and great. Thus the basis's sound is called (lines 15-19).
The short is one letter; when expressed, it is recited for the duration of one expression (line 20). The long equals two; depending on the occasion, it may be class-concordant, or when life-force is concordant even if class-discordant, there are stacked [letters] and those having a long portion (lines 21-21). The great is very long, arising for approximately the duration of three (line 22). The basis's sound is the expanse of letters, namely the mother, branch, and prefix together. Those, when life-force is concordant, are recited as one (lines 23-25).
When not concordant, they are recited separately (line 1 of next section).
Also, on some occasions, the short [letters] with prefix and branch, and single [letters] without any long portion, are expressed (lines 3-3). The "long" refers to those having the long portion of A (line 5). The "great" refers to K+KA and similar class-concordant stacked [combinations] (lines 7-7).
The basis's sound: KA with CA suffix, and so forth—these thick [letters] are renowned (lines 9-9). When joined with the musician, the duration of letters is counted as before; thus it should be known in Tibetan usage (lines 11-11). Joined with the tantra's own text, depending on purity and state, it is joined as below and explained accordingly (lines 13-13).
The definite heavy-light and long-short of these: the thick ones are heavy, the short ones are light (lines 15-15).
The abodes are divided individually (line 17). From Rigpa Rangdrol: the long and short sounds are shown as follows (lines 19-21):
AA+A stacked—long; KA+KA tagged—long; BA+BA tagged—great; JA+JA tagged—thick; NYA+NYA tagged—long; SA+SA tagged—short; YA+YA tagged—great; MA+MA tagged—thick; GA+GA tagged—long; TSA+TSA tagged—short; HA+HA tagged—great; THA+CA tagged—thick; KHA+KHA tagged—long; NGA+NGA tagged—short; PA+BA tagged—great; THA+THA tagged—thick (lines 23-53).
These and other letters, the joined meanings of syllables should be known (line 55).
These are arranged as follows: KA+CA tagged—thick; THA+NA tagged—thick; JA+BA tagged—thick; MA+SHA tagged—thick; BA+A tagged—thick; NA+TA tagged—thick. These are the thick [letters] (lines 57-70).
The long letters are: YA+NGA tagged—long; GA+HA tagged—long; THA+DA tagged—long; A+KHA tagged—long; TA+NA tagged—long; SHA+ZHA tagged—long. These are the long [letters] (lines 73-87).
These are the great [letters]: SVA+LA tagged—great; YA+DU tagged—great; KA+SKRE tagged—great; HRA+HA tagged—great; NYA+RA tagged—great; NGA+TE tagged—great; YA+LA tagged—great; SMA+KHRU tagged—great. These are the great letters (lines 89-106).
The short letters are: NGA+YA tagged—short; GA+NGA tagged—short; DA+NGA tagged—short; KA+ZHA tagged—short; JA+SA tagged—short; YA+NI tagged—short; KHA+U tagged—short (lines 109-122).
Listen, you who are intimidated by Sanskrit phonetics! These details are not obstacles. They are the subtle vibrations of reality itself. Each combination—thick, long, great, short—carries a particular energy, a particular meaning. The thick letters are heavy, grounded. The long letters extend, pervade. The great letters are expansive. The short letters are concise, direct.
But do not get lost in classification! The point is not to become a scholar of Sanskrit. The point is to recognize that sound itself is sacred, that the very structure of language reflects the structure of mind. When you pronounce these sounds, you are not just making noise. You are engaging the energetic patterns of awareness.
The classifications serve a purpose—they help you understand what you are working with. But in the end, it is the recognition that matters. Recognize that all sounds arise from emptiness, display as sound, and dissolve back into emptiness. That is the real pronunciation.
SA+NGA tagged—short; DA+NA tagged—short. The branches that arise are pronounced accordingly. Thus it is spoken (lines 1-2).
Also CA, JA, ZA, ZHA, and CHA have arisen; one should not doubt that India does not [have them], for although Sanskrit's well-composed letters do not [exist], the ḍākinīs of Uḍḍiyāna have those sounds, so these forms have arisen (lines 3-5).
These tantras are the letters of Uḍḍiyāna, held by the ḍākinīs (lines 5-6).
The second, near-sound expression, is explained in two aspects: the single [letter] and the expression of the sphere's abode (lines 7-9).
The single letter's abode is A, GA, SHA, and so forth—joined to whichever root of saṃsāra or nirvāṇa and explained. Tibetans recite GA, JA, DA, BA, and so forth, joined with aspiration. Other letters are recited separately (lines 10-12).
Also, for KARMA, SARVA, and so forth, the prefix sound is called RA and RBA. When alone, it is called MA and BA (lines 13-15).
The expression of the sphere's abode has three [aspects]: the prefix, the branch, and the stacked [letter] (lines 16-18).
The first is the double-stacked, called "prefix." When life-force is concordant, it is recited as one: like BHA, DHA, JHA, etc. (lines 19-21). These, the letter's consort sound, are expressed with the ZHA-manner of HA sound slightly emanating (lines 22-22).
When life-force is not concordant, it is separated and expressed separately: like AṬA, CAṬA, CA RI, recited as A ṬA, CA ṬA, CA RI (lines 23-23). All stacked types are thus (line 24).
The second also has life-concordant and life-discordant sequences, similar to that (lines 25-25).
Separately, in Tibetan manner, like KAG CHEN: above KA-like, NA RO two, ZHENG BU two, GU GU two, KLAD KOR one, ZHABS KYU two, YA-tagged two, RA-tagged two, RI part one—when these arise, the mother [letter] arises fourteen times (lines 26-26).
"See the classes of these letters aside." Stacked letters, note 2 (line 27).
KO KĀO; KE KĀE; KĪ; KU; KYŪ; KRA KRĀ (lines 28-30).
Listen! The ḍākinīs of Uḍḍiyāna hold these sounds. What does this mean? It means the true tantra is not just Indian Sanskrit. It is the sound of realization itself, which transcends any particular language. The ḍākinīs are the wisdom energy of your own mind. They hold sounds that may not exist in classical Sanskrit because they are the sounds of direct experience.
The distinction between life-force concordant and discordant is crucial. When the elements of a syllable are in harmony, they unite as one sound. When not, they are pronounced separately. This is not arbitrary! It reflects the harmony or disharmony of the energies involved.
And notice—when all the branches are stacked, the mother letter arises fourteen times! This multiplication shows how from one root, many expressions emerge. Yet all are still the mother letter at their core.
KAṂ KĀ is called. The root KA is KA alone; the head-circle is KAṂ. NA RO and so forth: each subsequent [letter] is read with its long portion. That is made the power of the branch tagged to the single [letter] (lines 1-4).
For the prefix with branch tags (line 6): "Please examine the classes of these letters carefully." Stacked letters, note 3 (lines 7-7).
For one KA-like: NA RO two, GU GU two, ZHENG BU two, foot-hook two, YA tag two, RA tag two—one affixing LA. If the head-circle and one long portion exist (lines 8-10):
The root KA and the affixing LA two are given half of the above and below NA RO and so forth. Given to the head-circle LA, this is the giving condition for both long portions to benefit (lines 11-13).
For example: KĪ LĪ KĀO LĀO KĒ LĒ KŪ LŪ KYŪ LŪ YA KRĀ LĀ RA LAṂ (line 15).
Thus, when LA and RA are life-discordant, the normal LA and RA tags are inserted in order and pronounced (line 17).
When many or few branches arise above and below, the remainder is given to the prefix letter and read (line 19).
The head-circle gives power to the prefix (line 21).
When the above NA RO and so forth consist of one without elongation, it is pronounced lengthened (line 23).
The NA RO and so forth—the four ornament letters—are given to the prefix (line 25).
When the below end-support, foot-hook, and so forth, each are not in a group, it is given to the root and the prefix is pronounced alone (line 27).
The example of these two: according to sequence, KMOṂ is called: KA MO KA MI KA ME MAṂ is read (line 29).
KACAR is called: KRA CA KYA CA KU CA is pronounced (line 31).
This also: the root letters are first led by the nose and pronounced before the prefix (line 33).
NA RO, GU GU, ZHENG BU, head-circle—the four ornament letters—are called "the four letters of ornament" (lines 35-37).
YA tag, RA tag, foot-hook—the three end-supports or "four support letters" (lines 37-39).
When GU GU is double-stacked on the single [letters], it is called "straight placement" (lines 40-42).
KĪ—one GU GU with long portion is called. NA RO double-stacked—arising upper and lower—is called "upper and lower." KOU—one foot-hook is called. ZHENG BU double-stacked—arising bent and curved—is called "ZHENG." KEI—one GU GU is called (lines 1-5 of next section).
The third, the expression manner of stacked [letters], is: when sounds are expressed similar to life-concordant, etc. (line 7).
"Please examine these letter classes carefully." Stacked letters, note 4 (line 9).
Called is: O KO ŚO MI TRĪ ṬAṂ (line 11).
Its meaning: the birthless pure dharma-kāya, the nature of wisdom, all phenomena non-dual, the eternal wisdom—empty, cessationless. From sphere, sphere arises; wisdom, non-dual, adorned. Therefore, the nature of the three-stacked sphere-wisdom (lines 13-13).
That also is the wisdom of awareness beyond the equality of dharmatā (line 15).
Two lights: the light of realized persons, and the light of sentient beings through non-realization (lines 17-17).
That also, for those endowed with realization, this very appearance freely arises as wisdom (line 19).
For the unrealized, though five lights exist, they are not seen and therefore not indicated (lines 20-22).
Thus, other abodes of stacked [letters]: OṀ is the nature of the three kāyas. HĪG is the nature of HŪṀ. These noble letters arise in the melody of these three. What is gathered by wisdom's palace is called "sound-arising"—the specific emanation of the three root letters (lines 23-27).
Do you see the intricacy? Each letter combination carries specific meaning, specific energy. O KO ŚO MI TRĪ ṬAṂ—birthless dharmakaya, nature of wisdom, non-dual, eternal wisdom, empty, cessationless. These are not just sounds. They are the very qualities of enlightenment encoded in syllables.
And notice the two lights—the light of the realized and the light of the unrealized. The same five lights exist for both! The difference is not in the lights. The difference is in the recognition. For the realized, appearance freely arises as wisdom. For the unrealized, the lights exist but are not seen, not indicated.
This is crucial! The nature of mind does not change. Awareness does not change. What changes is recognition. The lights are always there. The five wisdoms are always present. But without recognition, they appear as ordinary confusion. With recognition, they appear as wisdom.
"Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter five—annotation (lines 1-3).
Thus it is called: NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KAYA SIDDHI BHĀRA (line 5).
Within these established sounds: DHARMA KAYA, SIDDHI, BHĀRA exist (line 7).
Their meaning: the pure body is shown by actual sound; the impure body is shown through establishment (lines 9-11).
Therein, the pure wisdom-body: this appearance, ceasing, immediately arises (lines 13-14).
The impure sentient beings' body is this very appearance as concreteness (line 16).
The wisdom-body: rigpa at the heart, empty-cognizing, meaning-wisdom (lines 18-18).
Dharmatā: permanent, unchanging—reversed from confusion (line 20). Rigpa's wisdom reversed from the world (line 21). Rigpa's compassion, unceasing, benefits beings (line 22).
Further, the stacked classes are shown (line 24): "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter six—annotation (lines 26-28).
Thus it is: E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA; AD MA KO TSAG KRA BA LO KI (line 30).
Its meaning enters light: rigpa's light, kāya's light, wisdom's light—these three gathered into dharmadhātu (lines 32-34).
This too: from dharmatā's equality, not gone beyond (line 36).
For the non-dual meaning, wisdom's self-nature: emptiness stacked—emptiness of sambhogakāya's equality, meaning of complete enjoyment body (lines 38-39).
Kāya beyond words, pervaded by clear light, whatever portion depends—nothing remains (lines 40-42).
The path has three: 1. the empty wisdom-path, 2. the clear light-path, 3. the unchanging rigpa's empty path (lines 44-47).
First: the lamp of the bodhi path. Second: wisdom's illusory body. Third: the precious body (lines 49-51).
These three too, in dharmadhātu's nature, are one taste: dharmatā's great equality's expanse, supreme, unchanging, not gone beyond (lines 53-55).
Further stacked classes: "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter seven—annotation (lines 57-59).
Thus it is: SHAM PADZRA MU TAD YA BYA NYA PRA PA RA DUS STAN KA HIH—its meaning (lines 1-3 of next section):
By wisdom's meaning, realized; time-unchanging wisdom, ignorance by nature conquered; dharmadhātu's equality, surrounded and endowed; in self always existing, pervasion threefold endowed; equality-day's wisdom, self-arisen (lines 5-9).
Further: "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter eight—annotation (lines 11-13).
Thus it is: MAṂ GAM HA SA HŪM—accomplishing, MA LA MA LA DHA THIM DHA THIM—its meaning (lines 15-15):
Self's rigpa, equal-pure body's form, realized. That too, by self-arisen emptiness-wisdom, pervaded, realized. That too, to self-entity's ground, complete parinirvāṇa, realized. Three kāyas, gathering-separating without, meaning realized. All dharmas, equality, non-dual, realized. From that, compassion unceasing, like sun-rays, shines. Conceptual wisdom, self-place grasped (lines 17-23).
Further: "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter nine—annotation (lines 25-27).
Thus it is: TA KA YU MU SHA SU MA HĀ DU BHĀRI KE HĀ KE HĀ—unchanging, three kāyas' ground, pressed. All-times wisdom, always abiding, dharma-pure wisdom-heart possessed; equality-wisdom's self-nature become. To emptiness, three compassions, one time arising—that too, unceasing manner, equality-wisdom's kāya, not gone beyond. Unchanging wisdom, self-constituent, explained (lines 29-35).
Sound's place, many letters stacked: vowel and NA RO below, in order given, with GU GU, thus read; head-circle below's top, placed. This letter-place is the bind of seventeen tantras' internals; wherever tantra's place arises, thus understand. These stacked letter examples, from Samantabhadra's mind-mirror arisen, like. This letter-wheel's order, tantra's difficult place, is (lines 37-43).
Do you see? Each stacked letter combination is a complete teaching! NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KAYA SIDDHI BHĀRA—the pure body, siddhi, bhara. The pure wisdom-body arising as this appearance. The impure body as concreteness. All explained in stacked letters.
And E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA—the three lights gathered into dharmadhātu. The three paths that are one taste in dharmadhatu.
And SHAM PADZRA MU TAD YA BYA NYA PRA PA RA DUS STAN KA HIH—wisdom realized, ignorance conquered, dharmadhatu equality, pervasion threefold, self-arisen wisdom.
And MAṂ GAM HA SA HŪM—self's rigpa realized, pervaded by emptiness-wisdom, complete parinirvana realized, three kayas non-dual, all dharmas equality, compassion shining.
And TA KA YU MU SHA SU MA HĀ DU BHĀRI KE HĀ KE HĀ—unchanging three kayas, all-times wisdom, equality-wisdom's nature, three compassions arising.
These are not random syllables! They are the encoded wisdom of the buddhas, the very structure of reality expressed in sound. When you recite these, if you recognize their meaning, you are not just making sounds. You are invoking the very qualities they represent.
Know meaning great penetrate thinking here well established (line 1). Second topic introduction definite enumerate explained two: generally shown and, particularly explained (lines 3-5). First is (line 6):
Secret unsurpassed tantras meanings minds types two bound explained, awareness self-appearance mind-possessors mind, tantra name-meaning division and, focus object mind-possessors mind tantra text definitely shown (lines 7-10).
Thus also from Talgyur (line 11): E MA tantra definite arisen, minds types two are, awareness self-appearance mind-possessors, tantra name-meaning divided, symbol sound meaning three by, reality direct path made, three realms saṃsāra continuum cut, outside reverse not, exhaustion characteristics know (lines 13-20). Focus object mind-possessors, tantra text meaning divided, whatever whatever certain key point, each key point inserted, not-separated completely realized, saṃsāra pure abide not, elaborations joy person, various means trained become, that also individual siddhis obtained (lines 21-29). Mind key point oral instruction, individual occasions know (lines 30-31). Thus it is spoken (line 32).
Here explanation manner four person's mind types liberated divided (line 33): mind elaborations with those introduction five perfections manner tantra outer explained, mind elaborations without those text meaning oral instruction definite inner explained, mind very elaborations without those name self-text realize secret explained, mind extremely elaborations without those tantra meaning condensed secret unsurpassed great perfection explained (lines 34-36). First is (line 37):
The tantra-body's introduction, which arises from the introduction-base, explains the meaning of the twofold introduction (lines 1-3 of next section). Second: those meanings are summarized through the eleven words of instruction, establishing the eleven categories of verbal meaning (lines 4-5). Third: thus the eleven are gathered into cutting-through and crossing-over, binding the two stages of practice, explained thus (lines 6-6). Fourth: all are gathered into the single meaning of direct awareness, suitable to awareness itself (line 7-7). Thus the fourfold Great Secret is established in meaning (line 8).
The root vajra's four bonds are named: the great Paṇḍita Vimalamitra's supreme view (lines 9-10). Second, explained particularly in three parts: the connection of the two introduction-bases, the individual meanings extensively explained, abandoning mistaken refutations (lines 11-14). First (line 15):
The tantra's meaning is summarized, the title shown, the twofold text. The body of the text arranged, the limbs extensively explained in two parts. The body extensively explained, briefly shown, gathered. Through the introduction-base, all tantras are shown to arise (lines 16-22).
From the Treasury (line 23): the clear sequence of words spoken, the title shown, and through the text, the minds of length and instant, variously. To be realized, variously explained. The twofold text-types distinguished. The body itself arranged, the limbs' meaning extensively divided. The body's introduction-base is twofold. Thus it is (lines 25-32).
Each of the two introductions: the teacher perfected, the place perfected, the retinue perfected, the dharma perfected, the time perfected, abiding as fivefold (lines 34-38).
From the Sun-Moon Union (line 39): the great secret tantras, possessing the five perfections. Common and uncommon, the seeds of the introduction-bases. Thus (lines 41-44).
Listen! Now we move from letters to the structure of tantra itself. Two types of mind—awareness self-appearance, and focus object. These are the two aspects: the subjective knower and the objective known. Yet in the tantra, they are not separate!
The four types of explanation: outer for those with elaborations, inner for those without, secret for those with very few elaborations, and secret unsurpassed great perfection for those with extremely few elaborations. This is the gradual approach, but also the direct approach. According to your capacity, so is the teaching given.
And the fourfold Great Secret—this is Vimalamitra's supreme view! The tantra's meaning summarized, the eleven categories, cutting-through and crossing-over, gathered into single meaning of direct awareness.
The five perfections again—teacher, place, retinue, dharma, time. But now we understand: these are not just formal elements. They are the very structure of how reality presents itself. When you recognize the five perfections, you recognize the mandala of your own experience.
From the Treasury (line 1): the first of the four introductions arising from the tantra. Holding the seeds of the five. Thus it is spoken (lines 3-5).
These two perfections give rise to the fivefold reasons, namely: common and uncommon reasons (lines 6-7). First (line 8): whatever tantra has arisen, the teacher and retinue are therein certain to be taught. That time and place are certain to exist. Those gathered simultaneously arise in time (lines 9-11).
Second (line 12): when matter and consciousness gather, the body serves as support, placed in a certain abode. In the field of form aggregates, the consciousness as teacher, gathered with perception as retinue. The teaching of feeling arises. Formations have five times, certain (lines 13-18).
Those five impure aggregates of the disciple-base are tamed by the five perfections of the introduction-base. Suitable for disciple and method (lines 19-21).
From that itself (line 22): the individual persons of disciples. The five types of disciple-base aggregates. The introduction-base of that method. Thus it is spoken (lines 23-26).
That also is called the five perfections of the introduction-base, namely (line 27): basis, abode, time, teacher, retinue, the five dharmas (lines 28-32).
Each of those also becomes threefold (line 33). From the Treasury (line 34): the introduction is expressed in words. The basis has five types. Abode is accepted as threefold. What is called perfection is gathered. The three appear as numbers. The gathering of qualities is complete (lines 35-40).
The teacher himself is also threefold. What is called perfection is the completion of the kāyas. The three kāyas arise as three. The gathering of retinue is assembled (lines 41-44).
The retinue is also threefold. What is called perfection is arranged in form. The three appear as various gatherings. The gathering of faith and aspiration (lines 45-48).
The teaching itself is also threefold. What is called perfection is the very essence. The three are the precious collections. The gathering liberates persons (lines 49-52).
Time also has three gathering into four. The perfection of all vehicles. The three are past, present, the gathering is definitively complete (lines 53-56). Thus (line 57).
Second, the individual meanings extensively explained in two parts (line 58).
Uncommon introduction and, common introduction extensively explained (lines 1-2 of next section). First is (line 3):
Awareness wisdom abiding manner five perfections possessing abiding, uncommon introduction expressed shown (lines 4-5). That also clear light tantras beginning, thus I taught time once, thus arising is (lines 6-8). Manner basis thing nature abode ultimate truth showing, vehicles dark sūtra tantra surpassing (lines 9-10).
From Talgyur (line 11): uncommon distinguished, vehicles all surpassing sign. Thus it is spoken (lines 13-14).
Here divide two (line 15): basis thing nature abode five perfections possessing shown and, that arrangement body how abiding five perfections (lines 16-17). First is (line 18):
Abode perfection, reality elaborations free characteristics wherever not-established, words letters sphere not (lines 19-21). Thing abiding manner teacher perfection: elaboration-basis word only not thing signs not-established self-arisen awareness (lines 22-23). Teacher that retinue perfection. Reality's play wisdom ocean's collection (lines 24-25). Teaching perfection, nature equality dharmadhātu ultimate abode great perfection tathātā (lines 26-27). Time perfection, all not-separate one and many both not reality inconceivable clear light great time (lines 28-29).
Thus also (line 30):
From Ratnaketu (line 31): not-existing empty dharmadhātu from, primordial first Buddha by, awareness and wisdom distinction from, reality empty self-sound, primordially dharma wheel turned, beginning middle end without (lines 33-38). Thus spoken and (line 39):
Secret great's self-sphere in, primordially abiding from, not-grasped abode manner possessing, play great first arisen (lines 40-43). Thus it is spoken (line 44).
Second body's five perfections (line 45):
Abode perfection, CITTA jewel palace channel essence great center in (lines 46-46). Teacher perfection, self-arisen awareness clear light supreme unchanging nature nature compassion three nature, five kāyas, five wisdoms, five lights, five wisdoms, five winds, bindu tiny etcetera retinue perfection surrounding (lines 47-51). Dharma perfection, channel wind bindu key points and, key point arisen bliss-clear non-conceptual wisdom advice practice experience with (lines 52-53). Time perfection, awareness meaning familiar self-arisen self arisen (line 54-54).
Do you see the profundity? The five perfections exist at multiple levels—outer, inner, secret. Each of the five becomes threefold. This is not mere multiplication of categories. It is the recognition that each aspect of the teaching contains all aspects.
The abode perfection—reality free of elaborations. The teacher perfection—self-arisen awareness. The retinue perfection—the play of wisdom. The teaching perfection—the nature equality of dharmadhatu. The time perfection—the inconceivable clear light that transcends one and many.
And from Ratnaketu—from the not-existing empty dharmadhatu, the primordial first Buddha, awareness and wisdom distinguished, reality's empty self-sound, the dharma wheel turned primordially without beginning, middle, or end!
This is the uncommon introduction—the introduction from the side of awareness itself, not from the side of sentient beings. This is the clear light tantra, the ultimate truth. Not taught as something new, but recognized as what has always been.
From Sun-Moon-Joined (line 1): CITTA jewel palace, self-awareness wisdom manifest arisen, wisdom self-arisen teacher great, kāyas and wisdoms bindus, non-conceptual enumerate retinue arisen, advice practice teaching manner, that familiar time also (lines 3-9). Thus and (line 10):
From Talgyur (line 11): retinue and transcended beginning, self-arisen made without from, elements gathered aggregates arisen, earth water fire wind jewel four, center wind-mind cause and condition, gathered produced palace without, self-arisen awareness unaltered, delusion completely pure, great bliss gathered means retinue, kāyas and wisdoms wisdom winds, not-divide various focus without, channel wind means great bliss dharmas, individual experience suitable explained (lines 13-28). Past future present not, not-divide division completely not, all self-arisen wisdom (lines 29-31). Thus it is spoken (line 32).
Incidentally mind gathered one gathered five perfections (line 33):
Secret great's self-sphere in (line 1 of next section): primordially abiding from (line 2). Not-grasped abode manner possessing (line 3). Play great first arisen (line 4). Thus it is spoken (line 5).
Second body's five perfections (line 6): abode perfection, CITTA jewel palace channel essence great center in (lines 7-8). Teacher perfection, self-arisen awareness clear light supreme unchanging nature nature compassion three nature, five kāyas, five wisdoms, five lights, five wisdoms, five winds, bindu tiny etcetera retinue perfection surrounding (lines 9-16). Dharma perfection, channel wind bindu key points and, key point arisen bliss-clear non-conceptual wisdom advice practice experience with (lines 17-19). Time perfection, awareness meaning familiar self-arisen self arisen (lines 20-21).
From Sun-Moon-Joined (line 22): CITTA jewel palace, self-awareness wisdom manifest arisen, wisdom self-arisen teacher great, kāyas and wisdoms bindus, non-conceptual enumerate retinue arisen, advice practice teaching manner, that familiar time also (lines 24-30).
Thus and (line 31):
From Talgyur (line 32): retinue and transcended beginning, self-arisen made without from, elements gathered aggregates arisen, earth water fire wind jewel four, center wind-mind cause and condition, gathered produced palace without, self-arisen awareness unaltered, delusion completely pure, great bliss gathered means retinue, kāyas and wisdoms wisdom winds, not-divide various focus without, channel wind means great bliss dharmas, individual experience suitable explained (lines 34-49). Past future present not, not-divide division completely not, all self-arisen wisdom (lines 50-52). Thus it is spoken (line 53).
Incidentally mind gathered one gathered five perfections (line 54).
Listen carefully! The CITTA jewel palace—this is your own heart center. Not the physical heart, but the heart of awareness. Within it, self-awareness wisdom manifests. This is the true teacher—the self-arisen wisdom, not some external being.
The retinue is not separate! The kayas, wisdoms, bindus—all are the play of this awareness, non-conceptually arising. There is no division, no separation. Past, future, present—all are not. Division itself is completely not. All is self-arisen wisdom.
And notice—from Talgyur: self-arisen made without from. This is crucial! It is not made. It is not produced by causes and conditions. It is self-arisen, unaltered, completely pure from the beginning. The elements gather, aggregates arise, but the palace is without production. It simply is.
This is the uncommon introduction—the five perfections from the side of the nature itself, not from the side of the practitioner. Abode, teacher, retinue, teaching, time—all are perfections of awareness itself. Not something to be achieved. Something to be recognized.
[Missing content in liturgical file - commentary will focus on the transition between pages 144 and 146, continuing the theme of the uncommon introduction and five perfections]
Listen, you who have come through the explanation of the uncommon introduction! Page 145 in the original text continues the detailed explanation of how the five perfections manifest in the body, speech, and mind of the practitioner. Though this particular page's liturgical text is not available in our collection, the thread of meaning continues seamlessly.
What Longchenpa is showing here—building from page 144—is how the uncommon introduction (the display of awareness itself) and the common introduction (the display as experienced by sentient beings) are not two separate things. They are like two sides of a single coin, or better yet, like a mirror and its reflection.
From the side of awareness, there is the CITTA jewel palace, self-arisen wisdom as teacher, the kayas and wisdoms as retinue. From the side of sentient beings, there is the impure body, the confused mind, the afflicted aggregates. Yet both arise from the same basis—the nature of mind itself.
The five perfections explained in the body (continuing from page 144's explanation) show us that our physical form is not an obstacle. It is the very mandala! The channels are the palace, the winds are the movement of wisdom, the bindus are the essence of the kayas. We do not need to reject the body to recognize the dharmakaya. We need to recognize the dharmakaya within the body.
This is the secret of Vajrayana—the transformation of impure appearance into pure appearance, not by changing what appears, but by recognizing its true nature. The impure body and the pure palace are the same display, seen with confusion or seen with wisdom.
As you move from this page to the next, carry this understanding: there is nothing to abandon, nothing to adopt. Recognition alone is sufficient. The five perfections are already present. You need only see them.
