[Missing content in liturgical file - commentary will focus on the transition between pages 144 and 146, continuing the theme of the uncommon introduction and five perfections]
Listen, you who have come through the explanation of the uncommon introduction! Page 145 in the original text continues the detailed explanation of how the five perfections manifest in the body, speech, and mind of the practitioner. Though this particular page's liturgical text is not available in our collection, the thread of meaning continues seamlessly.
What Longchenpa is showing here—building from page 144—is how the uncommon introduction (the display of awareness itself) and the common introduction (the display as experienced by sentient beings) are not two separate things. They are like two sides of a single coin, or better yet, like a mirror and its reflection.
From the side of awareness, there is the CITTA jewel palace, self-arisen wisdom as teacher, the kayas and wisdoms as retinue. From the side of sentient beings, there is the impure body, the confused mind, the afflicted aggregates. Yet both arise from the same basis—the nature of mind itself.
The five perfections explained in the body (continuing from page 144's explanation) show us that our physical form is not an obstacle. It is the very mandala! The channels are the palace, the winds are the movement of wisdom, the bindus are the essence of the kayas. We do not need to reject the body to recognize the dharmakaya. We need to recognize the dharmakaya within the body.
This is the secret of Vajrayana—the transformation of impure appearance into pure appearance, not by changing what appears, but by recognizing its true nature. The impure body and the pure palace are the same display, seen with confusion or seen with wisdom.
As you move from this page to the next, carry this understanding: there is nothing to abandon, nothing to adopt. Recognition alone is sufficient. The five perfections are already present. You need only see them.
Listen carefully. If you understand, this great meaning penetrates your mind and settles here permanently.
The tantras explain meaning through two approaches: generally and particularly. Each suited to different minds.
**First approach: for those with self-appearing awareness**
When rigpa is already shining, the tantras speak differently. They point directly: symbol, sound, meaning—three ways to show dharmata. Reality becomes the direct path. The three realms, the continuum of samsara—cut through. No need to reverse anything outward. You recognize the exhausted nature directly.
The tantras say it plainly: tantra, definite arising. Mind types divide into two.
**Second approach: for those with object-focused minds**
These beings hold onto objects. For them, tantras explain through text, through meaning. Whatever they grasp, whatever they desire, the teaching gives them a key point. Each capacity gets its point. And when they realize the inseparability—not dwelling in samsara, not attached to elaborations—they too achieve their goals. Various methods, various accomplishments. Each according to their kind.
Oral instruction for the mind's key points, learned according to individual occasions.
**Four ways the teaching adapts**
Here's how it works across four types of minds:
**First**: For those with elaborations still active—the teaching appears as outer tantra, wrapped in the five perfections, complete manner. Language they can grasp.
**Second**: For those whose elaborations have fallen away—the teaching shows the inner meaning, oral instruction, definite text. Clear and direct.
**Third**: For those with very few elaborations left—the teaching points to name and self-arising text, recognizing the secret directly. No wrapper needed.
**Fourth**: For those with almost no elaborations at all—the teaching is the tantra's meaning condensed, the secret unsurpassed Great Perfection itself. What remains is the teaching.
The teaching is a mirror. It shows you what you need, nothing more. Don't complain the teaching doesn't match your expectations—the teaching matches your capacity. Work with what's given, and the capacity grows.
What you are right now determines what's handed to you. When you change, the teaching changes. That's why the same tantra reads differently to different people—the teaching is alive, responsive, alive to your state.
Stop asking for teachings you can't use. Start using the teaching you have.
Now we're getting into the architecture of the teaching itself. The tantra-body and its introduction—how these connect, how meaning unfolds.
Longchenpa lays out four approaches:
**First approach**: Summarizing the meaning through eleven words of instruction, establishing eleven categories of verbal meaning. Cutting through confusion and crossing over to liberation—binding the two stages of practice together.
**Second approach**: For those whose awareness is already direct—all of it gathers into the single meaning of rigpa itself. No need for elaborate structures when recognition is present.
**Third approach**: The four bonds of the root vajra. Vimalamitra's supreme view, passed down unbroken. Great Paṇḍita, pure knowing.
**Fourth approach**: The great secret, fourfold, established in meaning.
Now, how tantras are structured. The teaching always has:
**Title**: What it's called, the name that points.
**Text**: The words themselves, the clear sequence of what's spoken.
**Body**: The main teaching, arranged systematically.
**Limbs**: The branches, the extensions, explained extensively.
All tantras arise from the introduction-base—the point where teaching meets student. That's why tantras don't read like ordinary books. They're not composed by someone trying to make points. They're arising from the meeting of wisdom and capacity.
Each tantra has:
**The teacher**: Perfected, complete—not just a person but the embodiment of the teaching.
**The place**: Perfected—where the teaching happens isn't ordinary space.
**The retinue**: Perfected—those receiving aren't ordinary beings.
**The dharma**: Perfected—the teaching itself is complete.
**The time**: Perfected—not sequential time but the timeless moment of transmission.
Five perfections, five ways the teaching is complete. These are called the great secret tantras—common and uncommon, ordinary appearance and extraordinary meaning.
The seed of all this is the introduction-base. Without that, without the meeting point, there's just words on a page. With it, the whole tantra arises, alive.
Here's what this means for you: you're not just reading information. You're entering a transmission. The teacher, place, retinue, dharma, time—all must be present for it to work. Maybe not in outer form—maybe you're alone with a book in a monastery or a city apartment. But inwardly, something must be perfected too.
Don't read tantras like novels. Read them as transmissions. Feel for the presence. If it's not there, put the book down and look for what will make it arise.
Now let's break down these five perfections. Each one is actually threefold. Don't let the numbers overwhelm you—they're not separate things but the same reality seen from different angles.
**The five perfections of the introduction-base:**
**Basis**: Where the teaching happens, when it happens, who teaches, who's taught, what's taught. Five aspects, each containing three.
**Abode**: The place. Ordinary places and extraordinary places. The place of teaching isn't just geography—it's the space where recognition happens. Gathered into perfection.
**Teacher**: The one who teaches. Here it gets interesting—the teacher is the three kayas in one. Nirmanakaya, sambhogakaya, dharmakaya—not three beings but three ways the teaching presents itself. The teacher is you too, when recognition dawns.
**Retinue**: Those receiving. Also threefold—various beings gathered, arranged in forms appropriate to their capacities. Faith and aspiration present, ready to receive.
**Dharma**: The teaching itself. Three precious collections. The foundation, the path, the result—all gathered into one liberation. The very essence of what's taught.
**Time**: When it happens. Past, present, and the timeless moment of transmission. Four aspects gathered into three, or three into four—it depends on how you count. The perfection of all vehicles is contained.
Now, why these perfections appear: two reasons. Common and uncommon.
**Common**: Wherever a tantra arises, teacher and retinue are present. Time and place exist. All these elements gather simultaneously. Teaching doesn't happen in a vacuum.
**Uncommon**: When form and consciousness meet, the body supports the process. Consciousness becomes the teacher. Perception gathers as retinue. Feeling teaches. Formations unfold through five modes. The five impure aggregates of the disciple—the confused, attached, grasping ones—are tamed by the five perfections. The method suits the student.
Here's the key: all of this is happening right now. The basis, abode, time, teacher, retinue, dharma—they're not somewhere else, not in some pure land you have to die to reach. They're what is, this very moment, when recognition meets experience.
You are the retinue. Awareness is the teacher. This moment is the time. This place is the abode. What's appearing is the dharma. All five perfections are complete—already, without addition.
Stop waiting for something else. The introduction-base is here.
Now we're touching the uncommon transmission—the secret, direct introduction that doesn't rely on words. This is where ordinary teaching stops and real transmission begins.
The common transmission works through texts, through explanations, through "thus I taught." It's necessary for beginners, but it's a finger pointing at the moon.
The uncommon transmission: awareness-wisdom itself, dwelling in the five perfections naturally. No teaching happening—just the teaching being itself. This is what the clear light tantras begin with. "Thus I taught once"—but that teaching wasn't words. It was showing the ultimate truth of how things are.
This teaching surpasses all vehicles, all sutras, all ordinary approaches. Here's why:
**Abode perfection**: Reality itself, free from elaborations. No characteristics anywhere. Not words, not letters, not conceptual objects. Where does it abide? Everywhere and nowhere. Not established in any direction, any place, any thing.
**Teacher perfection**: The teacher isn't a person. It's how reality abides—self-arisen awareness, not based on words or concepts. No elaborations, no reference points. Just awareness being aware. The teacher is recognition itself.
**Retinue perfection**: The play of dharmata, the ocean of wisdom gathering. Those who receive aren't gathered as separate beings—they're the display of wisdom itself.
**Teaching perfection**: Great perfection, tathata, the ultimate nature of dharmadhātu. Not something taught but the very nature of what's taught.
**Time perfection**: Not ordinary time. Great luminous time, beyond one and many, beyond conception. All of it—beginning, middle, end—without any division. One moment that contains all moments.
From the Ratnaketu tantra: from the empty dharmadhātu that doesn't exist, from that very emptiness, the primordial Buddha turns the dharma wheel. Awareness and wisdom distinct yet inseparable. Reality empty, self-sound. The dharma wheel turning without beginning or end.
This is the uncommon transmission. Not something you learn—something you recognize. You've always been in it. You just didn't know.
Stop trying to understand it. Start recognizing that you're already inside it.
Now we're talking about the five perfections of the body—not the body's flesh and bone, but the body of wisdom, the kaya that is always already present.
**Abode perfection**: The citta jewel palace, the great channel essence at the center. Not a physical place you can visit, but the dwelling of awareness itself. Where awareness is, this palace is. Self-sphere, primordial space, not grasped by anything.
**Teacher perfection**: Self-arisen awareness, clear light, unchanging. The three natures合一: nature, compassion, and the nature that is both. The teacher is not someone teaching you—it's the reality of your own mind presenting itself. Five kayas arise from this: dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, and more. Five wisdoms. Five lights. Five winds. Five bindus—all the displays that arise when recognition is complete.
**Dharma perfection**: Channel, wind, bindu—the key points. From these key points arise bliss-clarity and non-conceptual wisdom. Not concepts, not ideas, but the actual experience of practice, the advice that works.
**Time perfection**: Awareness meeting itself. Familiar with its own meaning. Self-arisen, self-known. The time is not clock time—it's the moment of recognition, which contains all moments.
From the Sun-Moon-Joined tantra: the citta jewel palace. Self-awareness wisdom manifesting. The great teacher who is wisdom itself. Kayas and wisdoms arising as bindus. The retinue appearing without concept. The teaching through practice and experience. When this is familiar, time itself is recognized.
From the consequential tantras: samsara and nirvana begin from this same place. Not made, not fabricated—just arising from the gathered elements. Earth, water, fire, wind, jewel—the four basis elements. In the center, wind and mind as cause and condition. All of it arising as one vast display, unaltered, pure. Great bliss is the retinue, the means.
The five kayas, five wisdoms, five winds—all of it not divided, not separate. All self-arisen wisdom.
Listen: you're not building this. You're recognizing what's already complete. The palace is your own mind. The teacher is your own awareness. The time is now, this moment, when you stop looking elsewhere.
Stop trying to become what you already are.
Abode perfection, sphere opportunity vast sky (lines 1-2). Teacher perfection, self-mind delusion-appearance gathering gathering (lines 3-4). Retinue perfection, outer objects five, inner thought collections six habitual delusion-appearance (lines 5-8). Teaching perfection, grasping self karma afflictions saṃsāra dharmas (lines 9-9).

Second common introduction extensively explained (line 18): from Talgyur (line 19): teacher's speech retinue shown, marvelous supreme gathered teaching main, common introduction cause and condition, other scripture door opening, common called famous (lines 20-24).
Thus (line 25): vehicles common sūtra tantra arising like, secret great definite tantra also, uncommon introduction after, thus I heard time once etcetera spoken (lines 26-29). That also vehicles all sūtra common shown and, uncommon meaning is, that meaning commentary shown and, abode where time how long teacher which retinue which dharma taught doubt abandon common introduction spoken (lines 30-33).
How spoken abode where tantra arisen that time (line 34), teacher that three kāyas nature one speech need (line 35). Manner (line 36): dharmakāya meaning nature blessing speech, saṃbhogakāya nature clear half speech, nirmāṇakāya that word arrangement good speech sound sixty manner speech (lines 37-39).
Words also listener's awareness from (line 40), meaning sound letters not (line 1 of next section). From Uttaratantra (line 2): echo like letters not (line 3), thus spoken and (line 4): how echo's sound, other awareness arisen, concept not craft not, thus Tathāgata's speech, concept not craft not, outer and inner abode not (lines 5-10). Thus manner (line 11).
There tantra arising abode types three (line 12): dharmakāya's abode, dharmadhātu palace great, teacher Samantabhadra, retinue wisdom ocean's gathering, dharma nature great perfection, time reality expression transcended, words letters not spoken (lines 13-19).
Saṃbhogakāya's abode, completely pure dense arrangement, teacher saṃbhogakāya Vairocana retinue Rigpa-five Buddhas and, space Ākāśagarbha etcetera mothers five and, Kṣitigarbha etcetera beings and, Mohinī etcetera consorts and, self-appearance maṇḍala sky sphere whole, dharma great vehicle unsurpassed enumerate, letter six self-sound vowel tongue not spoke understand, wisdom self-appearance time (lines 20-29).

These occasion time perfection called (line 44).
Listen! Now we see the five perfections from the side of sentient beings—the COMMON introduction. Abode: vast sky. Teacher: self-mind gathering delusion-appearance. Retinue: outer objects and inner thoughts. Teaching: karma, afflictions, samsara dharmas. Time: beginningless, endless, appearance-consciousness.
This is how it appears to the deluded! The same five perfections, but seen through confusion. Yet even here, Ratnaketu tells us: appearance-grasping part pure from, outer objects retinue like appear (lines 15-16). Even in delusion, the pure nature is present. The outer objects appearing as retinue—this is the key! They are not truly separate. They are the display of mind.
And the three kayas' speech—dharmakaya's blessing speech, sambhogakaya's clear speech, nirmanakaya's sixty-fold speech. From the Uttaratantra: like an echo! Not truly existent, yet heard. Not crafted, not conceptual, without outer or inner abode. This is how the Buddha speaks.
The three abodes—dharmakaya's abode in dharmadhatu palace, sambhogakaya's in dense arrangement, nirmanakaya's in Tusita and other realms. Three levels, but all are the display of awareness. The teaching appropriate to each, the retinue appropriate to each, the time appropriate to each.
From Talgyur (line 1): basis types five, abode types three desired. Thus meaning (lines 2-3).
Also from Ratnaketu (line 4): grasping self-pure dharmakāya by, elaborationless self-pure palace, self undifferentiated appearance retinue, signless speech by, elaborationless dharmas, not-abide self-exhausted mind arisen, not-spoke spoke not, equality great state shown (lines 6-13).
Self-clear pure saṃbhogakāya by, light five pure palace from, elaborationless great bliss speech by, kāyas five families retinue, thingless pure dharmas, wisdom five gathered mind arisen, pure light rays tongue spread, self-arisen letter six, not-spoke self-arisen great shown (lines 14-21).
Nirmāṇakāya attachment without, dharma also disciple self-abode from, six families awake fortunate, elaborations word speech by, faculties whatever dharmas, memory self-clear mind from, faculties desire tongue spread, vehicle number dharma shown (lines 22-29).
Thus three kāyas speech explained, sentient beings bodhisattvas and, buddhas all mind satisfied, thus beings hopes fulfill (lines 30-33). Thus it is spoken (line 34).
Thus introduction two shown meaning and purpose arranged (line 35): thus I taught time once, Vajrapāṇi I before Samantabhadra heard complete retinue taught, or Vajrapāṇi tantra's teacher accepted retinue I taught (lines 36-38).
From Talgyur (line 39): teacher's speech retinue shown (line 40). Thus it is spoken (line 41).
Also Vajradhara Buddha is (line 42). From Śrīparamādi (line 43): buddhas all before Buddha, Vajradhara king vajra mind (lines 44-45). Thus spoken and (line 46):
From Training Tantra (line 1 of next section): buddhas all before Buddha, ignorance stains all destroyed. Vajra vajra-holder king, vajra vajra vajra-holder. Vajrapāṇi mahāmudrā (lines 2-7). Thus it is spoken (line 8).
Thus I heard time once (line 9), Vajrapāṇi I before teacher Samantabhadra Vajradhara great actually heard time, compiler dharma former buddhas mind accepted Buddha thinking, lineage middle unbroken and, times three dharmas enumerate meaning suitable and, retinue faith generate shown (lines 10-14).
From Talgyur (line 15): vehicles other door opening, common introduction, compiler self retinue, faith make shown, disciple basis method, arisen teaching abide (lines 16-21). Thus it is spoken (line 22).
Third mistaken refutations abandon (line 23): wisdom eye closed dharmas number waves form look opportunity without thinking, sūtra tantra other thus I heard spoke, taught this not arisen fabricated, taught fabricated become (lines 24-27).
From Cakrasamvara Root Tantra (line 28): then secret taught, thus spoke, that also fabricated defect, also answer two taught not suitable, melody expressed section whole not suitable, prose one verse one repeat teacher, name two taught also not suitable (lines 29-35).
Therefore meaning tantra arising shown uncommon introduction, word tantra arising shown common introduction, not-contradictory very connected shown (lines 36-38).
Those introduction definite meaning shown (line 39).
Listen carefully! Ratnaketu shows us the three kayas from the side of purity. Dharmakaya—grasping self purified, elaborationless palace, self-undifferentiated retinue, signless speech, elaborationless dharmas. Not-spoke, spoke not! This is the equality state.
Sambhogakaya—self-clear pure, five lights palace, elaborationless great bliss speech, five families retinue. Not-spoke, yet self-arisen great shown!
Nirmanakaya—without attachment, dharmas shown according to disciple's faculties, from memory self-clear mind. The appropriate teaching for each.
And all three satisfy the minds of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. All hopes fulfilled!
The introduction—"Thus I heard"—this is Vajrapani hearing from Samantabhadra, from Vajradhara. The lineage unbroken, the meaning suitable, generating faith in the retinue.
And the refutation of the mistaken view that these are fabricated! The Cakrasamvara Tantra answers: if it were fabricated, it would have defects. But the uncommon introduction shows meaning arising, the common shows word arising. Not contradictory! Very connected!
This knowing tantras chapters and meaning know occasion placed established (line 1). Third supreme definite prophecy (line 2): vajra essence teaching and, teaching's seed-kāya and, self-arisen letter and, three vajras and, those holders persons before-after arising sequence shown meaning three (lines 3-7): teaching's descent manner generally shown, flourish decline particularly explained, who holds persons shown (lines 8-10).
First is (line 11): first Samantabhadra Brahma-great eon arranged abode, that blessing Vajradhara Buddha emanation that dharmakāya saṃbhogakāya arose, Vairocana etcetera kāya's abode Brahma-great eon arranged, emanation kāya various disciples benefit doing, that eon first actual teaching dharmakāya great perfection, saṃbhogakāya teaching self-sound, emanation kāya manifestation appearance benefit doing, that blessing arisen vajra and, texts and, kāya images sequence descended, actual reflection teaching held, buddha sentient beings benefit spontaneous arising (lines 12-23):
First emanation awakening eon from, that abode field this not destroyed before fields other emanation benefit doing, now Saha field Buddhas thousand appearance benefit doing these three blessings (lines 24-26).
From Sound Talgyur (line 27): secret definite seventeen and, teaching's light miracle letter with, emanation field first, teacher Samantabhadra, dense arrangement abode held (lines 28-32). Then Tuṣita abode, Rigpa Vairocana, this held five rigpa ripened (lines 33-35). That past I held, teaching's life-tree supreme, buddhas thousand roots two, this depend definitely arise (lines 36-39).
Womb and egg-born and, warmth and womb-born, sentient beings ripen (lines 40-42). Disciple teaching this, twelve dharma wheel arisen (lines 43-44). This deeds thirty-six (line 45).
Listen! Now we come to the prophecy—the definite descent of the teaching. From Samantabhadra in the Brahma-great eon, through Vajradhara, through Vairocana, through countless emanations. The three kayas teaching—dharmakaya's great perfection, sambhogakaya's self-sound, nirmanakaya's manifestation.
And the blessing continues! Vajras, texts, kayas, images—all descending through time. The teaching held as actual reflection, benefit arising spontaneously for sentient beings.
From the Sound Talgyur—the seventeen tantras with light-miracle letters, first in the emanation field with Samantabhadra in dense arrangement. Then Tusita with Vairocana, the five rigpa ripened. This is the life-tree of the teaching, with the thousand buddhas as roots!
Twelve dharma wheels turned, thirty-six deeds performed. This is not mythology, you! This is the structure of how the teaching manifests. It is happening now, in your own mind. The teacher Samantabhadra is your own nature. The dense arrangement is your own body. The teaching is happening now.
Words also listener's awareness from, meaning sound letters not (lines 1-2). From Uttaratantra: echo like letters not, thus spoken and: how echo's sound, other awareness arisen, concept not craft not, thus Tathāgata's speech, concept not craft not, outer and inner abode not (lines 3-10). Thus manner (line 11).
There tantra arising abode types three (line 12): dharmakāya's abode, dharmadhātu palace great, teacher Samantabhadra, retinue wisdom ocean's gathering, dharma nature great perfection, time reality expression transcended, words letters not spoken (lines 13-19).
Saṃbhogakāya's abode, completely pure dense arrangement, teacher saṃbhogakāya Vairocana retinue Rigpa-five Buddhas and, space Ākāśagarbha etcetera mothers five and, Kṣitigarbha etcetera beings and, Mohinī etcetera consorts and, self-appearance maṇḍala sky sphere whole, dharma great vehicle unsurpassed enumerate, letter six self-sound vowel tongue not spoke understand, wisdom self-appearance time (lines 20-29).
Nirmāṇakāya's abode Tuṣita etcetera, teacher Vajradhara Vajrasattva wisdom illusion body, retinue transcended fortunate guide appearance and, bodhisattvas and, siddhas and, wisdom ḍākinīs and, worldly retinue gods and, humans and, asuras and, garuḍas and, yakṣas and, nāgas etcetera numberless, dharma sūtra tantra inconceivable, time eons countless hundred spoke (lines 30-43).
These occasion time perfection called (line 44).
Listen! Now we see the five perfections from the side of sentient beings—the COMMON introduction. Abode: vast sky. Teacher: self-mind gathering delusion-appearance. Retinue: outer objects and inner thoughts. Teaching: karma, afflictions, samsara dharmas. Time: beginningless, endless, appearance-consciousness.
This is how it appears to the deluded! The same five perfections, but seen through confusion. Yet even here, Ratnaketu tells us: appearance-grasping part pure from, outer objects retinue like appear (lines 15-16). Even in delusion, the pure nature is present. The outer objects appearing as retinue—this is the key! They are not truly separate. They are the display of mind.
And the three kayas' speech—dharmakaya's blessing speech, sambhogakaya's clear speech, nirmanakaya's sixty-fold speech. From the Uttaratantra: like an echo! Not truly existent, yet heard. Not crafted, not conceptual, without outer or inner abode. This is how the Buddha speaks.
The three abodes—dharmakaya's abode in dharmadhatu palace, sambhogakaya's in dense arrangement, nirmanakaya's in Tusita and other realms. Three levels, but all are the display of awareness. The teaching appropriate to each, the retinue appropriate to each, the time appropriate to each.
From Talgyur: basis types five, abode types three desired. Thus meaning (lines 1-3).
Also from Ratnaketu: grasping self-pure dharmakāya by, elaborationless self-pure palace, self undifferentiated appearance retinue, signless speech by, elaborationless dharmas, not-abide self-exhausted mind arisen, not-spoke spoke not, equality great state shown (lines 4-13).
Self-clear pure saṃbhogakāya by, light five pure palace from, elaborationless great bliss speech by, kāyas five families retinue, thingless pure dharmas, wisdom five gathered mind arisen, pure light rays tongue spread, self-arisen letter six, not-spoke self-arisen great shown (lines 14-21).
Nirmāṇakāya attachment without, dharma also disciple self-abode from, six families awake fortunate, elaborations word speech by, faculties whatever dharmas, memory self-clear mind from, faculties desire tongue spread, vehicle number dharma shown (lines 22-29).
Thus three kāyas speech explained, sentient beings bodhisattvas and, buddhas all mind satisfied, thus beings hopes fulfill (lines 30-33). Thus it is spoken (line 34).
Thus introduction two shown meaning and purpose arranged: thus I taught time once, Vajrapāṇi I before Samantabhadra heard complete retinue taught, or Vajrapāṇi tantra's teacher accepted retinue I taught (lines 35-38).
From Talgyur: teacher's speech retinue shown (line 39-40). Thus it is spoken (line 41).
Also Vajradhara Buddha is (line 42). From Śrīparamādi: buddhas all before Buddha, Vajradhara king vajra mind (lines 43-45). Thus spoken and:
From Training Tantra: buddhas all before Buddha, ignorance stains all destroyed. Vajra vajra-holder king, vajra vajra vajra-holder. Vajrapāṇi mahāmudrā (lines 1-7). Thus it is spoken (line 8).
Thus I heard time once, Vajrapāṇi I before teacher Samantabhadra Vajradhara great actually heard time, compiler dharma former buddhas mind accepted Buddha thinking, lineage middle unbroken and, times three dharmas enumerate meaning suitable and, retinue faith generate shown (lines 9-14).
From Talgyur: vehicles other door opening, common introduction, compiler self retinue, faith make shown, disciple basis method, arisen teaching abide (lines 15-21). Thus it is spoken (line 22).
Third mistaken refutations abandon: wisdom eye closed dharmas number waves form look opportunity without thinking, sūtra tantra other thus I heard spoke, taught this not arisen fabricated, taught fabricated become (lines 23-27).
From Cakrasamvara Root Tantra: then secret taught, thus spoke, that also fabricated defect, also answer two taught not suitable, melody expressed section whole not suitable, prose one verse one repeat teacher, name two taught also not suitable (lines 28-35).
Therefore meaning tantra arising shown uncommon introduction, word tantra arising shown common introduction, not-contradictory very connected shown (lines 36-38).
Those introduction definite meaning shown (line 39).
Listen carefully! Ratnaketu shows us the three kayas from the side of purity. Dharmakaya—grasping self purified, elaborationless palace, self-undifferentiated retinue, signless speech, elaborationless dharmas. Not-spoke, spoke not! This is the equality state.
Sambhogakaya—self-clear pure, five lights palace, elaborationless great bliss speech, five families retinue. Not-spoke, yet self-arisen great shown!
Nirmanakaya—without attachment, dharmas shown according to disciple's faculties, from memory self-clear mind. The appropriate teaching for each.
And all three satisfy the minds of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. All hopes fulfilled!
The introduction—"Thus I heard"—this is Vajrapani hearing from Samantabhadra, from Vajradhara. The lineage unbroken, the meaning suitable, generating faith in the retinue.
And the refutation of the mistaken view that these are fabricated! The Cakrasamvara Tantra answers: if it were fabricated, it would have defects. But the uncommon introduction shows meaning arising, the common shows word arising. Not contradictory! Very connected!
Three kāyas depend, disciple object sentient beings appear (lines 1-2). Thus it is spoken (line 3).
Those manner extensively shown (line 4): Vajradhara Brahma-great arrangement eons numberless inconceivable passed after, field forming beginning start, here north Moving- possessing field, teaching's seed-three that abode (lines 5-8).
Field there sentient beings individual karma, these arising time seven, not-arising time seven fourteen flourish decline (lines 9-11). There arising time seven: endowment, perfection, great perfection, strife, three strife, strife-possessing, great strife-possessing (lines 12-19). Those intervals decline dark eon seven called (line 20).
Then field vessel environment formed eon first Tuṣita, teacher came, seed-three here descended, sequence seven flourish decline, finally other leap (lines 21-25).
From Sound Talgyur (line 26): thus teaching this, remaining teaching this, time definitely great explained. Endowment and perfection, perfection great, thus two and three possessing, strife-possessing and great strife, those each interval, dark eon sixty, teaching's seed other becomes (lines 27-36).
North Moving-possessing, teaching's lamp there abides, Palden Kyong called, monk holders become (lines 37-40). That patron king, Jinamitra called, teaching secret basis make (lines 41-43). Years thousand three hundred abides (line 44).
Then dark eon... (line 45).
Listen! The vast timescale of the teachings! Brahma-great eons, numberless, inconceivable. The seven stages of flourishing: endowment, perfection, great perfection—then the decline: strife, three strife, strife-possessing, great strife-possessing. This is not just history. This is the cycle of all things!
The teaching's seed-three moves from field to field. North Moving-possessing field, where the lamp of teaching abides. Palden Kyong the holder, Jinamitra the patron king. For 1,300 years the secret teaching thrives.
Then the dark eon comes. This is the nature of samsara—flourishing and decline, arising and passing. But the teaching itself does not truly decline! It merely moves to another field, another time, when conditions are ripe.
Do not despair when you see degeneration! This is part of the natural cycle. The strife-possessing time is also the time when the essence of the teaching becomes most potent. In the darkest time, the brightest light shines.
Outcaste family thousand years, this abiding flourishing made (lines 1-2). That passed below dark, years thousand five abides (lines 3-4). Then again here descended, Vajra Seat arising abode, this flourishing light blazing, years five hundred fifty (lines 5-8). This Lodro Zangpo holds (line 9). That patron ḍākinī, Cool-pure made (lines 10-11).
That below world this, earth water fire wind joined disturbed, not-abide emptiness great becomes (lines 12-14). Eon called first from, end destruction time arises (lines 15-16). Thus it is spoken (line 17).
Lodro Zangpo this holder all, years five hundred year great, five hundred five hundred passed (lines 18-20). That only humans eon first life ten primordial this appearance, others not ḍākinī abode benefit doing (lines 21-22).
Second flourish decline particularly explained (line 23): Jambudvīpa this now primordial life ten this flourish decline types seven arising (lines 24-24). From Ati Great Arrangement (line 25): listen fortunate Śāriputra, teaching's supreme great extensive arrangement, supreme essence repeatedly gathered, gold essence sun illuminator this, common degenerate flourish not, secret great family possessing some appear (lines 26-32).
Degeneration strife-possessing affliction coarse time, sects internal quarrel hermitages all destroyed. Royal law not-abide self-pride king conduct, father son quarrel weapon bodies protect. Accumulated groups lost earth's environment exhausted. Unsuitable view conduct also many arise (lines 33-38).
Degeneration five hundred life year gradually decline. Merit fortune short life sixty, essence this years sixty abides (lines 39-41). That passed below years hundred interval, logic conduct secret this not-abide (lines 42-43). That passed below years thousand also, study contemplation without person from, secret supreme this sun like (lines 44-46). That passed below two hundred dark (line 47).
Then life years forty, essence this years hundred interval abides (lines 48-49). That passed thirty interval dark (line 50). That passed years hundred interval abiding, beings' life thirty time, secret supreme this distance eight hundred flourish, life twenty this not arising (lines 51-53). Life ten time essence this arisen, this and meet self-release (lines 54-55). Sky exhausted not-appearing teaching's seed, also teaching's ember other becomes (lines 56-57). Thus spoken and (line 58):
Listen to this prophecy of decline! Outcaste family flourishing for a thousand years. Then 1,500 years of darkness. Then the teaching descends to Vajra Seat, blazing with light for 550 years under Lodro Zangpo, with the patron ḍākinī Cool-pure. But then—the world itself disturbed, elements in chaos, returning to great emptiness.
And our own time—Jambudvipa now! The seven types of flourish and decline in the age of ten-year lifespans. Degeneration time—afflictions coarse, sects quarreling, hermitages destroyed. Kings prideful, father and son fighting with weapons. This is our world, you!
But notice—when the common teaching degenerates, the secret great teaching appears! When the gold of the common dharma is exhausted, the sun of the supreme essence shines. This is the time!
Life spans declining—sixty years, then forty, then thirty, then twenty. Yet the secret essence flourishes at eight hundred distance! What does this mean? It means when outer conditions are most difficult, the inner teaching becomes most available. When life is short and coarse, the direct path of dzogchen becomes the only viable path.
Life ten time—this is when the essence truly arises. This is when we meet and self-release. The teaching's seed moves to other fields, but the ember remains. This ember is what we must tend now!
The tantras describe the arrangement of worlds, the beings who inhabit them, the kings who rule. You might wonder why this matters. Here's why: what you take yourself to be determines which world you inhabit.
The Sound Tantra describes how teachings are destroyed. It happens when beings become attached, when wrong desire takes hold. Those individuals become causes for teachings to fade. Each decline has its time, its place, its character.
First dark age, western continent. A king with six fingers, blue teeth, a black mole on his wrist marking evil. Terrifying appearance. Under such rulers, buddha's teaching falls into darkness. Sixty years, an age.
Then Palden rises. A thousand three hundred years pass, and the teaching flourishes again. But decline comes—northern continent, radiant mountains. A monk with loving mind, free of attachment. Two ears, three eyes with coverings. Tirthika sects quarrel. Another sixty years of darkness.
Further ages: kings with one eye, powerful bodies, skilled in archery and magic. They suppress the dharma. Sixty-year intervals of darkness, then flourishing, then decline again.
Pratyekabuddhas appear, the vajra seat arising in the west. Pure teachings lasting one hundred twenty years.
Golden cities, elders with split tongues, humped backs, short limbs, quarreling sects. The same patterns repeating through time.
Lions arise—Palden Seng-ge, ruling for a thousand four hundred years. Then decline again. Princes with reddish complexion, ordained at four finger-heights. Darkness follows.
These aren't just stories about ancient times. This is describing your own mind, your own world. Every time attachment arises, every time wrong desire takes hold, a small dark age begins in your experience. Every time recognition dawns, a golden age.
The geography is inner. The kings are aspects of mind. The continents are states of consciousness. You're not reading about somewhere else. You're reading about yourself.
So which age are you in? Which king is ruling your mind right now? That's the only question that matters.
The cycles continue. Vulture Peak, Kashmir, monks and teachers, each appearing for their span—three months, ten years, five hundred fifty years. Each one lights up the world briefly, then darkness returns.
Monks named Śobhya, Śākya Jīka—blazing like lamps in the darkness. Each brings a period of flourishing, then decline. Seven such cycles for Jambudvipa, the continent of our world.
After all seven cycles complete, after ten years pass between cycles, the teaching's seed-three field no longer abides here. The fertile ground is exhausted. The teaching cannot take root in this world any longer.
Then attention shifts. Southward to beautiful arranged fields. The same seven-fold pattern—flourish, decline, flourish, decline. The Saha world, this realm of endurance, becomes empty. The beings are gone, the conditions spent.
And beyond this world? Other worlds. Northward, to vast protector worlds. Buddha Utpala, holding beautiful flowers, bringing seven more cycles of flourish and decline. Tuṣita heaven, the contented realm, where future buddhas dwell before descending. Saṃsāra-destroyer, lasting for a hundred thousand times seven eons.
All of this arranged by Vajradhara, the vajra holder. In the Brahma-great eon, all beings return to their primordial ground, liberated. The vessel becomes empty—environment, beings, all dissolved back into space.
Eighty-five eons in the sky of oneness. That's how long the arrangement lasts before it begins again.
The seed-three of teaching: what does this mean?
First seed: Vajradhara's great deed completed. Reality itself, peaceful sphere, self-exhausted, not appearing as anything. The teaching doesn't come from somewhere—it arises from this completion.
Second seed: Beings appearing from that sphere, emanating into forms. The Brahma-great arrangement.
Third seed: The arrangement itself, displaying the teaching through flourish and decline, through birth and death, through darkness and light.
Here's what's really being said: all of this—the worlds, the beings, the cycles, the teachers—is the teaching. Nothing is outside the teaching. The darkness is teaching. The light is teaching. The arising is teaching. The dissolving is teaching.
You're not outside looking in. You're part of the pattern. Your own mind is one of these worlds, going through its own cycles of flourish and decline.
Which cycle are you in right now? That's the only question worth asking.
When the six hundred thousand eons have passed, when beings are ready to be tamed, a teacher comes. This is Samantabhadra's blessing—teaching's seed-three arising naturally, bringing benefit to sentient beings without flourish or decline.
The beautiful arrangement continues. Fields and realms, appearing and disappearing in ten-year intervals. Each cycle complete, then the supreme teaching moves to another world.
Utpala flower buddha, in the vast protector world, Sukhāvati—the blissful realm. A palace, five thousand retinue, great bodhisattvas who have attained patience for the unborn dharma. Pure beings, single-pointed virtue. The teacher arrives, tames those with wrong desire, establishes the teaching for five thousand years. Then the seven-fold pattern of flourish and decline begins again.
Tuṣita heaven, the contented realm. Amitāyus, infinite life, destroyer of samsara. One hundred eight arhats in the retinue, all outflows exhausted, deeds completed, burdens laid down. The teaching's essence remains for a hundred thousand times seven years. Then the same seven-fold sequence repeats.
Eighty-five eons later, everything dissolves—the dharmas, the buddha bodies, all the worlds. No teaching remains anywhere.
But then: the world below. Six hundred thousand eons. The teaching abides for a long time. No flourish, no decline. Beings ripen naturally.
Here's the teaching's seed-three laid bare:
First seed: The blessing itself—Samantabhadra's arising, bringing benefit without striving.
Second seed: The arrangement—beautiful worlds, vast protector realms, the cycles of teaching and learning.
Third seed: The dissolution—when everything returns to nothing, even teaching ceases.
Notice: all of this is the buddha's teaching. The arising is teaching. The flourishing is teaching. The declining is teaching. The cessation is teaching. There's nothing outside it.
You're not separate from this. Your own mind goes through these same patterns—arisings and cessations, teachings and silences, periods of clarity and periods of confusion. Every moment is part of the cycle.
The question isn't whether you're in a good cycle or a bad cycle. The question is whether you recognize the cycle at all. When you see it—see it completely—that's the teaching. When you don't see it, you're still in the teaching, just dreaming.
Wake up inside the dream.
Two reflections of the teaching. The first is the reflection of faith and blessing—beings' devotion and the guru's grace, pervading all six realms. The second is the actual teaching itself.
The actual teaching has three aspects. First, dharmakaya and sambhogakaya—the teaching of the two bodies, the teacher's self-appearances in the pure sphere. The dharmadhātu palace, clear light, dense arrangements—eternal continuous wheel, always turning.
Then the emanation body: common teachings through sūtra and tantra sequences. The uncommon secret great vehicle, the supreme definite teaching. This teaching isn't found anywhere else—not in the abodes of gods, not in the merit of humans. Even ḍākinīs dwell in human and divine realms, waiting.
When you meet this secret great definite teaching, when the seed-three of the teaching meets you—no effort needed, liberation is certain, no doubt remains.
From the emanation of speech, from letters: whatever teaching the buddhas brought, written in colors matching their bodies. Preserved in jewel caskets, carried under the left arm, read in due time. Honored and worshipped—again, no effort, liberation follows.
Benefits in this life: long life, no disease, wishes fulfilled, demons and obstacles find no opening. At death: no pain, no suffering, a happy passing.
If you see the introduction gate in this life, in the bardo you'll hold fast to the wisdom lamp. Even those with intellectual understanding, holding the vehicle, will be born in pure lands.
Ordinary beings who meet this teaching, even they ripen into higher happy realms. The qualities are beyond counting.
From the Sound Tantra: like the sun illuminating everything, the three kayas descend without effort. Buddha is certain to be obtained. This is the blessing's key point.
Emanation of speech also: the teaching's colors written, placed under the left arm, read and held in time. Definitely, liberation is certain.
Read this tantra always. It works the same way.
Don't underestimate what's being offered here. This isn't just information. It's a transmission. When the letters touch your mind, something happens—effortlessly, without striving. The blessing enters.
Your only job: receive it. Don't block it with doubt, with clever analysis, with the need to understand before accepting. Just receive. The liberation is already certain.
From the Great Arrangement tantra: whoever holds this teaching easily masters all crafts, all arts, all treatises, all sounds. Know whatever they wish. The secret supreme unsurpassed teaching—when honored and praised, supreme and common accomplishments arise as wished.
Just carrying this teaching, holding the scriptures and oral instructions—these dispel the world's darkness like jewel light. The lamp illuminates all who see it. Those who encounter it are liberated. The fortunate ones attain buddhahood without doubt.
The third section: the types of persons who hold this teaching, explained in three categories. First, those with prophecy, whose liberation is certain.
The first among them: primordial Samantabhadra, the first king, who obtained clear light and arranged the Brahma-great upper fields. Vajradhara. Emanating in many other forms and names, arranging all of this. The blessing of other buddhas who arranged the Brahma-great eons—filling the sky's limit with numberless expressions beyond words.
Some abide. Some destroy. Some form and abide. All of this arranged by Vajradhara, the secret essence, the clear light eon. Sixty-four hundred thousand sequences for taming beings. Between these, other eons beyond number arise. The clear light essence explained here—this teaching has been present since the beginning, ripening countless beings.
This is the first teaching, arisen primordially. The secret essence that ripens beings without measure.
Then the second teaching: Śikhin, world-protecting buddhas.
Here's what this means: the teaching hasn't just appeared once. It's been arranged, held, transmitted across eons beyond counting. Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, all the great beings—they're not distant figures. They're aspects of the same transmission, the same blessing, the same teaching.
You're not starting from nothing. You're entering a stream that has flowed since the beginning of time. The holders before you number beyond measure. The fortunate ones who attained buddhahood—you're joining their company.
The question isn't whether you can do it. The question is whether you'll receive what's already being offered. The stream is flowing. Will you step into it?
This teaching, this transmission—it's been working for eons. It's worked before you. It'll work after you. Your only job: get out of the way and let it work.
The teachings continue through seven more stages, each with its protector buddha, each lasting through countless eons.
Third: Brahma thousand Yama, world protector. Fourth: Sun thousand king. Fifth: Jvalamukha, web protector buddha. Sixth: Light-rays thousand rim protector. Seventh: Saṃsāra-destroyer, the conquering king.
Across sixty-four thousand eons, the secret essence is held, beings benefit, until finally Vajradhara—the great holder—arranges the Brahma-great eon. The entire sequence spans what words cannot express, numbers cannot contain.
The lineage: first comes the secret conduct, the seed tantra. Then, in each eon, different buddhas appear, different retinues gather, different liberation paths unfold. Smṛti protector, the superior mindfulness. The mudra of self-awareness, the wheel of recognition. Distinctions beyond words.
In that first eon, seventy thousand times, the supreme mudra is held. Then wisdom exhausted, essence understood, lineages of nine or ten holders maintaining the definite mudra.
All of this arising from the blessing of buddhas, from the self-arisen great letters, from primordial purity. The teaching has been self-arisen since the beginning, maintained through blessing, passed down through many eons.
The Great Arrangement continues: primordial buddhas arranging thousand-fold maṇḍalas. Then the second teaching through Śikhin, world protector, the supreme mudrā. Then the third through Brahma thousand Yama. Fourth through sun thousand. Fifth through Jvalamukha. Sixth through light-rays. Seventh through all-pervading Saṃsāra-destroyer.
Sixty-four thousand eons, countless buddhas, the secret great held entirely. The definite teaching of the buddhas through nineteen hundred thousand essence mudrās.
The numbers are overwhelming—not to impress you, but to show you something: this teaching has been maintained across spans of time your mind cannot fathom. It hasn't failed. It hasn't disappeared. It's been held, passed down, preserved through eon after eon.
You're not the first. You won't be the last. The stream is vast. The lineage is unbroken. The holders before you number beyond measure.
Your job isn't to create something new. Your job is to receive what's already being transmitted, to become part of the unbroken stream. The teaching has survived a hundred thousand eons. It doesn't need you to fix it. It needs you to receive it.
That's all. Just receive.
The first protector's emanation arranged sixty-four thousand great manifestations, benefiting disciples through nineteen hundred thousand buddhas. Samantabhadra, Vairocana, all the great ones arranging the realms.
The teaching shows Vairocana in the lotus heart, the thirteen petaled center of the jewel sky. The abode of all buddhas, the fields of all five families. Buddha's deeds, qualities, activities—the three kayas equal to space, beyond what even tenth-ground bodhisattvas can measure.
From Uttaratantra: the buddha realm, buddha awakening, buddha qualities, buddha activities—pure beings beyond thought. From Ratnaketu: sky pervades as much as kāya pervades, as much as light pervades, as much as speech pervades. Everything interpenetrating everything else.
Now the second point: liberation outcomes.
In Jambudvipa, this secret great definite teaching liberates countless ḍākinīs beyond number, non-human beings. Here, among humans—males, females, ordained ones—liberation happens in this life or in the bardo.
The Great Arrangement speaks: "Listen, fortunate monk Pal! I will not abide here. Within sixty years, one thousand one will attain liberation. All arising in self-release. Half in monk form, half as bodhisattvas. Then within fifty years, two hundred thousand will obtain birthless liberation. Mostly women. One thousand two hundred men."
Then: "Within thirty years, six hundred thousand will be liberated. Mostly men, one hundred thousand women. All arising in self-release."
Those were my former retinue, attaining buddhahood even in degenerate times. The definite secret essence, when gathered, brings definite result. Other teachings don't bring this result.
If you encounter other teachings where a manifest buddha appears, meet this one as you would meet that.
Here's the point: all results gather in the heart of this teaching. This is what's being offered to you.
Numbers. Outcomes. Certainty.
This teaching doesn't leave liberation to chance. It specifies who will be liberated, when, how many. This isn't arrogance—it's confidence. The teaching knows what it does.
Ordained or lay, male or female—it doesn't matter. What matters is encountering this teaching, receiving it, holding it. The liberation numbers will be filled. The question is: will you be one of them?
Sixty years, fifty years, thirty years—the teaching specifies. Time is short. The retinue is gathering. Will you join them?
No more waiting. No more hesitating. The numbers are being counted. Your name could be among them.
This life, those arising in self-purity—specific numbers given. All buddhas arise from this secret great teaching's realm. Those who see the nature directly through awareness become buddhas. Nothing surpasses this.
Those who've met this teaching before, in former eons, gathered the power of accumulation. When they meet this teaching again, they quickly attain buddhahood. The result is certain. The heart of the result.
"O fortunate master, dharma-holder! Whether in this life, in the bardo, or in whatever emanation fields—buddhahood is quickly accomplished, definite. The cause is unfailing, the teaching pure, the result certain. Faith is the key."
"O fortunate master! Those who worshipped countless former buddhas, gathered in Samantabhadra's retinue—they're practicing the secret unsurpassed vehicle now. Even those who merely met the common vehicle before, accumulating virtue, worshipping buddhas—those who meet this uncommon teaching have special prior accumulations, practiced well before. The ground is prepared."
From Abhisamayalankara: the buddhas accomplished great deeds, planted virtue roots, protected by spiritual friends. You who hear this—you are the vessel.
Bardo liberation outcomes: among those who will manifest as buddhas between two births, within ten years—one thousand seven hundred will meet the appearance mother. One thousand six hundred males. One thousand one hundred females. Males, females, boys, girls—whoever meets this teaching, in whatever form, will be completely liberated.
This is the certainty: entered this teaching, received the guidance, obtained the instructions. Liberation is not uncertain.
Numbers again. Certainty again.
All buddhas come from this teaching. All liberation happens through this teaching. There's no other path that brings results like this.
If you've accumulated before, if you've met buddhas before, if you've practiced before—you're positioned. If this is your first encounter, it's still certain. The teaching works regardless.
What's required? Faith. Meeting the teaching. Receiving the instructions. Holding them.
That's all.
No more doubting. No more seeking elsewhere. This is it. The result is certain.
Meaning not obtained, males and females children those heard benefit quickly liberation definite, result heart unsurpassed meet (lines 1-3). Third vidyādhara definite prophecy expressed (line 4):
From Talgyur (line 5): I nirvāṇa below, west Uḍḍiyana land, Dhana Kośa goddess, fatherless son Vajra He, this supreme teaching holds (lines 6-10). That successor west, brahmin child fortunate, Mañjuśrīpati called, years seventy-five holds (lines 11-14). That successor fortunate, Sośa island called, householder family Śrī Siṃha, that holds (lines 15-18). That holder outcaste family, Jñāna Sūtra earth this holds (lines 19-20). That holder householder family, Mahāmudrā holds (lines 21-22). That successor king family, emanation reflection holds (lines 23-24). That successor monk form, Lhun-gyal-tshen holds (lines 25-26). That successor Siddha Śvara holds (line 27). That successor earth abiding, bodhisattvas hold (lines 28-29). That below Vajrapāṇi, emanation Vajra Pha holds (lines 30-31). That below king lion, Zangpo holds (line 32-33). That below Dgah-bzang holds (line 34). That below yogi Sra holds (line 35). That below king Khri-'od, that below monk Pal with, then Lodro Chog holds (lines 36-38). Then ḍākinī Pal holds (line 39). Teaching this held, life ten time flourishes, then not-abide self-place (lines 40-42). Thus it is spoken (line 43).
Thus our master supreme monk Pal with, beings' protector Kumārarāja until emanations arisen prophecy sequence, especially year hundred hundred, Tibet this Vimalamitra's emanation essence this abode definite clearly shown history great arranged (lines 44-47).
Listen! The lineage of vidyadharas! From Buddha's nirvana, the teaching passed to Uddiyana—Vajra He, Manjushripati, Shri Simha, Jnana Sutra, and on through the ages. Each holder maintaining the essence, each adding their blessing.
And notice—the teaching flourishes for a time, then does not abide in one place. It moves! From India to Tibet, from master to disciple, like a lamp passed from hand to hand. The life-ten time—our time—this is when it flourishes most!
Our master, the supreme monk Pal, and Kumārarāja—these are the emanations of Vimalamitra himself! The prophecy is clear. The teaching is here, now, in this very text you hold. Do not take it lightly! This is the direct lineage from Samantabhadra, through Vajradhara, through all the buddhas, to you.
Supreme this mole A mark possessing nose-tip with, oral instruction key point definite other surpassing, clairvoyance future prophecy, difficult places definite clearly shown, nirvāṇa time also supreme sign definite world filled (lines 1-5). This whoever meet saṃsāra town without effort liberated Jambudvīpa ornament arisen (line 6). Beings' protector very compassionate, ornament guru world now arisen, clear light essence teaching clear shown, peaceful sphere gone homage (lines 7-10).
Compassion always saṃsāra held, peace side nirvāṇa not-passed, beings benefit seen final deed, marvelous world pervading homage (lines 11-14). Autumn moon first peaceful, forest supreme life released, again blessing compassion marvelous, other surpassing homage (lines 15-18). Where protector nirvāṇa became, that time earth forest moved, light five appearance sky pervaded, music sound played homage (lines 19-22). Relic dissolving light blazing sky, ḍākinī offering clouds music adorned, all non-concept meditation obtained, limitless emanations shown homage (lines 23-26). Siddha mantra holders ḍākinī gathering, numberless offering clouds arrangement surrounded, vidyādhara Buddha field gone, sky-goer siddhi obtained homage (lines 27-30). Future beings merit field, relic placed five families came, crown five families fields rainbow like, light five adorned come homage (lines 31-34). Relic pieces wherever invited, stūpa built and charity done, light five appearance sky pervaded, beings' mind greatly moved homage (lines 35-38). Vimalamitra protector compassionate, emanations many beings benefit done, Tibet land ornament emanation gone, Kumārarāja teacher homage (lines 39-42). Thus our master supreme vidyādhara's emanation prophecy clearly expressed (line 43).
Thus Jambudvīpa vidyādhara Buddha gathering supreme teaching held flourished generations seven passed, life ten passed (lines 44-46).
The marks of the master! Mole A mark on the nose-tip—the sign of one who holds the definitive oral instructions. Clairvoyance, prophecy of the future, clear showing of difficult points. This is not ordinary praise. These are the signs of a true vidyadhara.
And when such a master passes into nirvana—the earth moves, forests tremble, five lights pervade the sky, music plays spontaneously. These are not just poetic descriptions. They are the signs that appear when a great being departs, if you have the eyes to see.
The relics, the rainbows, the dakini offerings—these are the natural expressions of a realized master's final liberation. The five lights dissolve into space, yet emanations continue to benefit beings.
Vimalamitra's compassionate emanations have come to Tibet. Kumārarāja is here. The teaching is alive! Seven generations have flourished. Now, in the life-ten time, it is your turn. Will you be merely a spectator, or will you enter the mandala?
