Supreme this mole A mark possessing nose-tip with, oral instruction key point definite other surpassing, clairvoyance future prophecy, difficult places definite clearly shown, nirvāṇa time also supreme sign definite world filled (lines 1-5). This whoever meet saṃsāra town without effort liberated Jambudvīpa ornament arisen (line 6). Beings' protector very compassionate, ornament guru world now arisen, clear light essence teaching clear shown, peaceful sphere gone homage (lines 7-10).
Compassion always saṃsāra held, peace side nirvāṇa not-passed, beings benefit seen final deed, marvelous world pervading homage (lines 11-14). Autumn moon first peaceful, forest supreme life released, again blessing compassion marvelous, other surpassing homage (lines 15-18). Where protector nirvāṇa became, that time earth forest moved, light five appearance sky pervaded, music sound played homage (lines 19-22). Relic dissolving light blazing sky, ḍākinī offering clouds music adorned, all non-concept meditation obtained, limitless emanations shown homage (lines 23-26). Siddha mantra holders ḍākinī gathering, numberless offering clouds arrangement surrounded, vidyādhara Buddha field gone, sky-goer siddhi obtained homage (lines 27-30). Future beings merit field, relic placed five families came, crown five families fields rainbow like, light five adorned come homage (lines 31-34). Relic pieces wherever invited, stūpa built and charity done, light five appearance sky pervaded, beings' mind greatly moved homage (lines 35-38). Vimalamitra protector compassionate, emanations many beings benefit done, Tibet land ornament emanation gone, Kumārarāja teacher homage (lines 39-42). Thus our master supreme vidyādhara's emanation prophecy clearly expressed (line 43).
Thus Jambudvīpa vidyādhara Buddha gathering supreme teaching held flourished generations seven passed, life ten passed (lines 44-46).
The marks of the master! Mole A mark on the nose-tip—the sign of one who holds the definitive oral instructions. Clairvoyance, prophecy of the future, clear showing of difficult points. This is not ordinary praise. These are the signs of a true vidyadhara.
And when such a master passes into nirvana—the earth moves, forests tremble, five lights pervade the sky, music plays spontaneously. These are not just poetic descriptions. They are the signs that appear when a great being departs, if you have the eyes to see.
The relics, the rainbows, the dakini offerings—these are the natural expressions of a realized master's final liberation. The five lights dissolve into space, yet emanations continue to benefit beings.
Vimalamitra's compassionate emanations have come to Tibet. Kumārarāja is here. The teaching is alive! Seven generations have flourished. Now, in the life-ten time, it is your turn. Will you be merely a spectator, or will you enter the mandala?
Former shown like beautiful arrangement etcetera field teaching's seed leaped beings all ripened benefit done (line 1). Eon good this thousand eon form destruction hundred passed, eon Saṃsāra-emptier called, buddha Wheel Lightning Garland supreme teaching held, beings saṃsāra liberated (lines 2-5).
Vajradhara arranged Brahma-great eon beings all primordial ground liberated teaching's seed-three reality sphere dissolved, saṃsāra emptied, here eon great thousand twenty beings not-appear (lines 6-8). Then again former like habitual tendencies arose beings' vessel environment appearance, method teacher also first Samantabhadra's power arisen (lines 9-10).
Thus Sound Great Talgyur Tantra (line 11): teaching essence secret this, thus teaching seven passed, fields seven definitely experienced, thus seven passed also, Vajra Seat's threshold, teaching all speech seed, self-arisen great letter, sound with descent, here eon hundred, Wheel Lightning Garland, Bhagavān appearance, then years hundred three, thus three passed below, teaching's mind vajra also, teacher that appearance, then years five hundred, teaching's kāya also there descended, thus teaching actual descended, again teaching's ember arises, teacher that retinue, Ārya Brahma-light called, miracle power perfect, greatly faithful aspiring, definitely held manifest (lines 12-35). That etcetera teacher's retinue, Ārya śrāvaka thousand two, vinaya teaching eon one... (lines 36-38).
The teaching moves! From field to field, from eon to eon. When one field is exhausted, the teaching leaps to another. Seven fields, seven experiences. Vajra Seat's threshold—the sacred site where all teachings originate.
The eon Samsara-emptier—when Buddha Wheel Lightning Garland holds the teaching, liberating all beings. Then samsara is emptied! The teaching's seed dissolves into the reality sphere. For twenty great thousand eons, no beings appear.
But then—habitual tendencies arise again. The vessel and environment appear. And Samantabhadra's power manifests once more as the teacher. This is the endless cycle of benefitting beings.
From the Sound Great Talgyur—the teaching descends through speech, through the self-arisen great letter, through sound itself. Mind vajra, then kaya, descending over hundreds of years. The ember rekindles. The lineage continues.
This is your lineage, you! Not just words in a book. Living transmission. The teaching is here now because of this continuous descent through countless masters. Do not waste it!
Arhat result guide, then dark eon six, that passed arhat hundred-thousand two, self's retinue gathered, sūtra teaching eon eight, provisional definite karma guide, miracle power conquered, definitely propelled teaching complete, again nirvāṇa manner shown (lines 1-9). Then dark eon two, then teacher's kāya born, bodhisattva great's retinue, thousand eight gathered, supreme aspiring Rab-'jigs-dpal, greatly shown teaching gathered, abhidharma teaching eon hundred, all life one result obtain, this time Saṃsāra-emptied, beings Buddha obtain, six migrations appearance not possible, eon thousand twenty, beings saṃsāra continuum cut, beings not-appear (lines 10-23).
Then karma distinction, beings afflictions former not, habitual tendencies arose power, very subtle taken form, number many very subtle from, form beings body increase (lines 24-29). Thus express immeasurable, teaching's end inconceivable, temporarily word shown (lines 30-32). Thus it is spoken (line 33).
Here some masters, Samantabhadra's abode all beings all emptied, some Vajradhara arranged Brahma-great beings all liberated, teaching's end inconceivable, thus Samantabhadra's abode still measureless, however not contradictory, Samantabhadra's compassion all liberated, sphere arising still habitual tendencies measureless two not contradictory, liberation great measure best very good (lines 34-42).
From Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle (line 43):
Listen! The complete cycle—dark eons, arhats gathering, sutra teachings, then abhidharma teachings. Each vehicle serving its purpose, each liberation cutting the continuum of samsara. Finally, Samsara-emptied! All beings become Buddha. Six migrations no longer possible. For a thousand twenty eons, beings do not appear.
Then—habitual tendencies arise again. Very subtle forms appear. Form beings increase. This is the nature of samsara. Even when emptied, it arises again from the power of latent tendencies.
The teaching's end is inconceivable! Some masters say Samantabhadra's abode is emptied of all beings. Some say Vajradhara's Brahma-great eon liberates all. Both are true! Not contradictory. Samantabhadra's compassion liberates all, yet the sphere's arising from habitual tendencies is measureless. These two—liberation and appearance—are not in conflict.
This is the great measure of liberation. The best of the very good. Do not be discouraged by the vastness! Even one moment of recognition is enough. Even one being liberated is enough. The teaching continues, endless, until all are freed.
Secret great definite meaning difficult places shown fifth chapter (line 1). Thus faith branch knowing tantra abode established (line 2). Now that abode from whatever arising meaning shown from (line 3):
First unsurpassed vehicle entering gate empowerment is (line 4). Here that abode definite arranged three (line 5): empowerment entering basis, empowerment actual path, empowerment complete result (lines 6-8). First four (line 9): empowering master characteristics, empowered student nature, common dharma, how empower empowerment action (lines 10-13). First is (line 14):
Guru suitable qualities all complete faults all without compassion great (line 15). From Rigpa Rangshar (line 16): vajra meaning master, nature good teaching skilled, empowerment obtained secret mantra meaning apply, outer inner actions all know, yidam deity not separated, meditation distracted not, great perfection oral instruction meaning possessing, secret mantra secret tantra skilled, outer inner accomplishments all do, view's meaning not transgress, outer inner secret actions abandon, qualities jewel like, exhaustless treasure enjoy (lines 17-28). Thus spoken and (line 29):
From Talgyur (line 30): guru Vajradhara great, sequence explained, characteristics complete guru, qualities all source, perfect awakening basis holder (lines 31-36). Thus spoke (line 37).
Here characteristics six possessing (line 38), saṃsāra's dharmas behind abandon, desires few content, application skilled experience possessing, tantra words meaning skilled accomplishment diligent, view's meaning skilled power complete, compassion great giving joy (lines 39-44). Those complete glorious Vajradhara called (lines 45-46).
Now we enter the fifth chapter—the empowerment that is the gate to the unsurpassed vehicle. Listen! Without empowerment, there is no entry. Without the master, there is no empowerment.
The guru must be Vajradhara himself! Not in mere appearance, but in qualities. Six characteristics: abandon samsara's dharmas, few desires and content, skilled application with experience, skilled in tantra words and meanings, skilled in view with complete power, great compassion giving joy.
Do not seek empowerment from just anyone! The master must be qualified. Must have obtained empowerment, must apply the secret mantra meaning, must know outer and inner actions, must never be separate from the yidam, must not be distracted in meditation, must possess the oral instructions of great perfection.
And you, the student—do you have faith? Do you have devotion? The guru is the source of all qualities. The basis of perfect awakening. Without this recognition, empowerment is just ritual. With this recognition, every moment is empowerment.
Examine your master! Not with ordinary judgment, but with wisdom. Does he have these qualities? If yes, then he is glorious Vajradhara. If no, keep searching. Your liberation depends on this connection.
Student's six families seed empty, afflictions six purifying, wisdom six meaning arising, that power possessing (lines 1-4). Also guru divide root and, branch two from (lines 5-6):
First root guru: characteristics four complete empowerment basis placed, tantra explained, oral instruction shown, now also self guru that shown oral instruction practice (lines 7-11). Oral instruction guru empowerment basis placed, tantra explained two possessing, oral instruction struck branch guru three possessing (lines 12-14).
Incidentally training master (line 15): from Rangshar (line 16): ignorance pride great and, stupid words attached and, secret mantra meaning not mind and, other's criticism proud words and, wrong path entered and, empowerment maṇḍala face not seen, samaya spread and, questions answer not able, little learning pride great, master not examined student's demon, secret mantra teacher not, great perfection Ati cannot teach, that associate not (lines 17-29). Thus it is spoken (line 30).
Second student's nature (line 31): saṃsāra's dharmas mind reversed, guru dharma companion faithful devotion great, faith firm dharma other mind not enter, definite meaning faith renunciation diligence great, attachment few nature good, wisdom great samaya vows abide, other's mind suitable dharma transform, guru's words listen secret gate not miss, study contemplation great self-nature tamed, especially guru Buddha or more devotion possessing, ten dharmas possessing, liberation supreme good student, quickly saṃsāra liberation supreme obtain definite (lines 32-44). Thus also (line 45):
Listen! The student must also be qualified! Six families seed empty—purifying the afflictions, arising wisdom. Without this power, empowerment cannot take root.
Two types of guru—root and branch. The root guru explains tantra, shows oral instruction, practices what he teaches. The branch guru may only give oral instruction, may lack the complete basis. Know the difference!
And avoid the false masters! Those with ignorance and pride, attached to stupid words, not understanding secret mantra meaning, proud of criticizing others, entered wrong paths, never seen empowerment mandala, spread samaya without basis, cannot answer questions, proud with little learning. These are not teachers—they are demons!
But you, the student—have you reversed your mind from samsara's dharmas? Do you have great devotion to guru and dharma companion? Firm faith that does not enter other dharmas? Renunciation, diligence, few attachments, good nature, great wisdom, samaya vows?
Can you transform others' minds with suitable dharma? Do you listen to guru's words without missing the secret gate? Do you study and contemplate, taming your self-nature? Do you see guru as Buddha—or even greater?
These ten dharmas make you a supreme vessel. With these, you quickly obtain liberation. Without them, even the best teaching cannot enter. Examine yourself honestly!
From Rangshar (line 1): faith power diligence great, wisdom great attachment not, humility great secret mantra conduct, thoughtless mind distracted not, samaya possessing accomplishment diligent, urgency longing longing devotion possessing, direct spontaneous meditation conduct, master spoken like conduct, samaya spread not abandon, conduct other suitable conduct, respect manner mind and, word one teaching follow, self-benefit like conduct, secret aspire patience do, vajra meaning not transgress, learning great person rely, self-benefit transgress not, pride words not gentle speak, other mind suitable enter, master and Tathāgata, no difference one manner, that student's characteristics, thus possessing student, great perfection vessel spoken (lines 2-26). Thus it is spoken (line 27).
Incidentally abandon student (line 28): from that (line 29): honor humility not doing, secret mantra miss conduct, family lineage not nature not, wisdom small become, kindness disregard, own family speak, body adornment wear, meaningless spread, student not examined master's enemy, practice not person, great perfection meaning not explain (lines 30-40). Thus it is spoken (line 41).
Also bad vessel good content not hold, lion's milk clay vessel not like. If poured dharma's greatness lost, bad vessel from hell go, bad vessel such secret needed (lines 42-46). From that (line 47): oral instruction great perfection meaning, bad vessel generally pour not, faith possessing some content, bad vessel pour, content both ruin, therefore mind inferior secret (lines 48-53). Thus it is spoken (line 54).
Third common dharma three (line 55):
The qualities of the student! Faith, diligence, wisdom, humility. Mind not distracted, samaya possessed, accomplishment diligent. Urgency, longing, devotion! Direct spontaneous conduct, following master's words exactly.
Do not spread samaya to those who cannot hold it. Conduct suitable to others. Respect in manner, mind, and word. Follow one teaching—do not mix many. Aspire to the secret with patience. Do not transgress vajra meaning. Rely on the learned. Do not harm self or others. Speak gently, not with pride. Enter others' minds suitably.
See master and Tathagata as no different! This is the characteristic of the student who is a vessel for great perfection. Without these qualities, you are not a vessel—you are a broken pot.
Avoid the bad student! One without honor or humility, missing secret mantra conduct, concerned with family lineage rather than nature, small wisdom, disregarding kindness, speaking of own family, wearing adornments, spreading meaninglessly, not examined by master, not practicing—do not explain great perfection to such!
Lion's milk in a clay vessel breaks the vessel! Dharma's greatness lost, the bad vessel goes to hell. Both content and vessel ruined. Therefore—keep the secret from inferior minds. Protect the teaching. Only pour into vessels that can hold.
Master student common mind dharma, rely supplicate manner, purpose definite result (lines 1-3). First is (line 4): master that student compassion urgently sees timely benefit care dharma, even food drink benefit (lines 5-6). Student that guru's qualities thinking longing devotion continuous (line 7).
From Rangshar (line 8): compassion connection not cut, longing continuous, master student's connection (lines 9-11). Thus it is spoken (line 12).
Second is (line 13): from Talgyur (line 14): individual characteristics complete, kingdom and own body, retinue enjoyment support, body speech conduct pleasing, master Buddha equal rely, faith wisdom possessing, faithful delusion not, express objects error not, faculties clear master rely (lines 15-23). Thus (line 24):
Student that, elaborations etcetera empowerment and, advice request aspiration possessing, suddenly enter not, common invitation also former message needed (lines 25-29). Therefore year five or seven or three former guru groups gold maṇḍala offered self age this, empowerment this called, advice this called request permission supplicate, own virtue practice session master that yoga day night six meditate supplicate (lines 30-33).
Master also son you empowerment request that interval obstacles remove sin purify master crown meditate day night six supplicate grant permission give supplicate make (line 34). That purpose body deity kāya ripen and (line 35):
The connection between master and student! This is the living dharma. Master sees student with compassion, urgently benefiting, caring for dharma even more than food and drink. Student thinks of guru's qualities with continuous longing and devotion.
Compassion connection—not cut! Longing continuous. This is the true connection. Not just receiving empowerment and disappearing. Day and night, six sessions, supplicating.
Before entering, prepare! Five or seven or three years serving guru. Offering gold mandala equal to your own age. Requesting permission, supplicating properly. Not suddenly entering! Not without invitation!
And the master—when you request, he removes obstacles, purifies sins, meditates day and night six sessions, then grants permission. This is the tradition. This is how ripening occurs.
Body ripens as deity kaya. Speech ripens as ali kali self-sound. Mind ripens as emptiness meditation without face. Three doors ripened through proper connection. Do not rush! Do not think you can skip steps. The traditional way is the fast way. Trying to go fast without foundation is the slow way—if it works at all.
Speech ali kali self-sound ripen and, mind emptiness meditation face without ripen (lines 1-2). That time self-desired empowerment etcetera whatever obtain need thinking aspiration fierce, dream dharma explain, prophecy etcetera master accomplishment signs arise definite (lines 3-5).
Third purpose definite result (line 6): thus former supplicated guru relied, whatever desired all accomplish jewel wish-fulfilling tree like arising (lines 7-8).
From Talgyur (line 9): rely that qualities, wish-fulfilling tree wish-fulfilling jewel, cow of desires like, qualities numberless obtain, that aim guru rely, saṃsāra's battle reverse (lines 10-15). Thus it is spoken (line 16).
Fourth how empower empowerment action five (line 17): empowerment benefit, not-empowered defect, where empower abode, when empower time, celebration sequence (lines 18-22). First is (line 23):
From Rangshar (line 24): qualities particularly this: wisdom appearance great, obstacles without become, self-appearance companion shown, actions all doing become (lines 25-29). Thus spoken and (line 30):
From Empowerment Jewel Tantra (line 31): guru desire abandoned, empowerment ritual complete, sequence how empower, Vajradhara great also, this life become definite (lines 32-36). Thus spoken and (line 37):
From Secret Essence (line 38): essence five empower, time past Buddha's son, lower realms all not, higher liberation master become (lines 39-42). Thus spoken and (line 43):
Also from Rangshar (line 44): empowerment benefits this: bardo self-appearance face-know become, face-know also that stable obtain, emanation kāya day twenty-one separate able. Faculty supreme complete also suffering fear etcetera not come. Practice time also wisdom appearance not-cease clear. That special quality called (lines 45-51).
Common qualities this obtain (line 52): ḍākinī voice know and (line 53):
The ripening! Speech as ali kali—self-sound. Mind as emptiness meditation—without face. When you supplicate with fierce aspiration, dreams explain dharma, prophecies arise, signs of accomplishment appear.
Why rely on guru? Because whatever you desire is accomplished—like a wish-fulfilling tree, like a wish-fulfilling jewel, like a cow of desires. Numberless qualities obtained. Samsara's battle reversed!
Five aspects of empowerment action: benefit of empowerment, defect of not receiving, where to empower, when to empower, celebration sequence.
Benefits! Great wisdom appearance. Obstacles removed. Self-appearance shown as companion. All actions accomplished. This life becoming Vajradhara! No lower realms. Becoming a master of liberation.
Special qualities: in bardo, self-appearance face-known. Stable attainment. Able to separate emanation kaya in twenty-one days. Supreme faculties, no suffering or fear. Wisdom appearance never ceasing, always clear.
Common qualities: knowing dakini voice, receiving dakini blessing, honor from humans and gods, loving-kindness from all, beautiful form, great merit, birth as cakravartin, jewel-like qualities, pure conduct like lotus, worthy like stupa, suppressing beings' common suffering like parasol, liberating with wisdom like fire mass, benefiting like sword, holding beings with compassion like vajra hook, realizing sphere-wisdom like dharma cloud.
Hundred eight qualities! All actions accomplished. Obstacles and wrong-leadings cannot harm. Children, enjoyments—all signs of obtained empowerment.
Ḍākinī blessing do and, blessing humans honor place see, all beings loving-kindness, form beautiful pleasant to see, merit great increase, death cakravartin king body birth, jewel like qualities great arise, lotus like pure dharma conduct, stūpa like all surrounded worthy see, parasol like beings common suppress, fire mass like wisdom beings liberate able, sword like benefit do able, vajra hook like beings compassion hold able, dharma cloud like sphere wisdom not-separated meaning realize. Outer inner actions all doing (lines 1-15). Those etcetera qualities hundred eight obtain (line 16). That actions whatever doing all obtain (line 17). That obstacles wrong-leadings not harmed (line 18). Children many enjoyment great empowerment obtained sign (line 19). Lifetimes former later remember (line 20). Beings birth take also see (line 21). Other's mind know (line 22). Non-humans associate (line 23). Those etcetera qualities hundred eight obtain (line 24).
Second not-empowered defect (line 25): from Magical Display Secret Essence (line 26): master pleased not, empowerments obtained not, listening etcetera start, result not lose (lines 27-30). Thus spoken and (line 31):
From Empowerment Complete Self-arisen Great Tantra (line 32): secret mantra empowerment not-depend obtain not, example deaf handless, river cross not able like (lines 33-35). Thus spoken and (line 36):
From Rangshar (line 1 of next section): empowerment not obtained defect this: bardo fainting, fear, suffocation, obstacle, perception lost arise. Habitual body not abandon interval beings honor worthy not see, merit small, life short, livelihood enjoyment few, mouth near, obstacles many arise. Actions all not accomplish. That secret mantra conduct empowerment not obtained defect. Secret mantra conduct yogi empowerment obtain. Empowerment not obtained Buddha also Tathāgata ground dharma wheel turn not able. Wheel not turn compassion emanation kāya beings benefit do not able. Therefore secret mantra conduct empowerment obtain (lines 2-19).
Third where empower abode (line 20): secluded pleasant siddhi near (line 21). Here general abode auspicious earth divination good forest etcetera (line 22). Particular abode four from (line 23): elaborations abode student's body earth south expanse north protect. Water east expanse west protect. Fire west expanse east protect. Wind north expanse south protect (lines 24-27). Elaborationless abode: dense forest ravine mountain element suitable form signs follow (lines 28-29). Very elaborationless three valleys gathered mountain peak excellent good (line 30). Very elaborationless very secluded or hermitage town league one above (line 31). Empowerment four all abode other beings afraid carnivorous wild reside and, poisonous snakes and, cemetery charnel etcetera and (lines 32-34):
The hundred eight qualities continue! Remembering former lifetimes, seeing beings take birth, knowing others' minds, associating with non-humans. All obtained through empowerment.
But the defects of not receiving empowerment! Master not pleased, empowerments not obtained, result lost. Like a deaf and handless person trying to cross a river—impossible!
In bardo: fainting, fear, suffocation, obstacles, lost perception. Not seeing worthy beings, small merit, short life, few enjoyments, many obstacles. Actions not accomplished.
Even Buddha cannot turn the dharma wheel without empowerment! Cannot benefit beings through emanation kaya. Therefore—obtain empowerment!
Where? Secluded, pleasant, near siddhi. Auspicious earth, good forest. Four particular abodes for elaboration: body-earth with south expanse north protection; water-east with west protection; fire-west with east protection; wind-north with south protection.
Elaborationless: dense forest, ravine, mountain—following element signs. Very elaborationless: three valleys gathered at mountain peak. Or very secluded hermitage, one league above town.
For all four empowerments: where beings are afraid, where carnivorous wild animals reside, where poisonous snakes are, where cemeteries and charnel grounds exist—this is excellent, auspicious!
Ḍākinī very wild not tamed possessing abode cemetery excellent auspicious (line 1). Thus also (line 2):
From Great Perfection Self-arisen (line 3): empowerment supreme this shown, town great center, yogi purpose not accomplish, town cities end, forest or mountain ravine empty, yogi empowerment meaning enter (lines 4-9). Thus spoken and (line 10):
Also very secluded pleasant, abode characteristics examine, town valley end all, fruit forest ripened place, flowers various arise, west high east expanse, north protect similar, south valley similar abode, self manifest direction from, valley empty without, front form without, being similar form without, back rock support, side fruit trees various blaze, front forest clear water flow, or food abode, mountain ranges all not cut, birds sounds various call (lines 11-28). Thus it is spoken (line 29).
Fourth when empower time two (line 30): generally shown, particularly explained (lines 31-32). First guru grant auspicious conjunction gathered auspicious time (line 33). However special time (line 34): autumn awakening result ripen, spring liberation seed plant show (lines 35-36). Year monkey auspicious (line 37). Waxing eighth good (line 38). Star king supreme (line 39). Planet Jupiter good (line 40).
Second four from (line 41): first elaborations time and signs (line 42): empowerment sequence enter time key point shown (line 43). Elaborations empowerment: rat dragon horse pig, especially year four, empowerment ritual accomplish (lines 44-47). Month first four (line 48). Time complete result produce accomplish (line 49). Date waxing one from (line 50). Month full middle (line 51). Empower time noon midnight (line 52). Yogi body particular (line 53). Individual element year suitable (line 54). Empowerment ritual auspicious (line 55).
This time student samaya possessing, element bodies suitable, number measure not, hundred fifty etcetera, element suitable contradiction not, if ritual enter, lamp expanse not possessing, samaya repair ritual do, defect not siddhi, again again take, meaningless death obstacle arise, empowerment complete reading force exert, that time gathered relatives, body disease arise, prostration circumambulation do, speech stammer who arise, think hundred syllables recite, mind hungry or memory lost, generation completion stage enter (lines 56-75).
Wild dakinis untamed! Cemeteries are excellent and auspicious. Not the comfortable places, you! The places where ordinary people are afraid—this is where empowerment enters.
From the Great Perfection Self-arisen: not in the town center! Yogi purpose not accomplished there. At town's end, in forest or mountain ravine—empty places. This is where empowerment meaning enters.
Examine the abode! Valley's end, fruit forest ripened, flowers arising. West high, east expanse. North protecting, south valley. Self-manifest direction. Valley empty in front, no form, no beings. Rock support behind. Fruit trees blazing at sides. Clear water flowing in front. Food abode. Mountain ranges uncut. Birds calling variously.
Times! Autumn for ripening results. Spring for planting liberation seeds. Monkey year auspicious. Waxing eighth day good. Star king supreme. Jupiter good.
For elaboration empowerment: rat, dragon, horse, pig years. Four months. Waxing from first day. Full moon middle. Noon or midnight. Element suitable to yogi's body. Not fixed numbers—hundred fifty or whatever, no contradiction.
But watch for defects! Lamp without expanse—repair samaya. Or you must take again and again. Death obstacles may arise. Disease, stammering, hunger, memory loss. These are signs to purify through confession, recitation, generation and completion stage.
If improvement sign arises, primordial empowerment ritual exert (lines 1-2). If accomplishment substance increases, siddhi supreme obtain, equality meaning faithful (lines 3-5). Empowerment enter, always signs good see, common siddhi that accomplish (lines 6-8). Experience and knowledge possessing, this also bliss joy conduct (lines 9-10). Guru supreme also, faith good whoever born, this also mudrā supreme apply (lines 11-13). Self body speech bliss see, this Buddha pure field (line 14-15). Elaborations empowerment time and, signs well explained (lines 16-17). Thus it is spoken (line 18).
Second elaborationless time and signs (line 19): also from that (line 20): now elaborations not, time and signs near shown (lines 21-22). This year particular not, whoever knows (lines 23-24). This time summer and winter good, date waxing side, empower time dawn sound cleared, this faith possessing five six, seven more meaning not accomplish (lines 25-30). Thus faith possessing son, mind virtuous possessing, speech guru praise possessing, such empowerment time, body bliss not, body sin outer confess, thus speech and mind also, sin confession action start (lines 31-38). Elaborationless empowerment, time and signs explained (lines 39-40). Thus it is spoken (line 41).
Third very elaborationless time and signs also (line 42): from that (line 43): now very elaborations not, supreme secret empowerment, time and signs explain (lines 44-46). That also year particular not, self-suitable do accomplish, outer time seed enter time, awakening seed support, this time empower, self-arisen seed increase explained, grain and fruit gather time, very elaborationless empower, wisdom fruit complete, three kāyas ground definitely go (lines 47-56).
Inner time waxing increase time, date waning abandoned, experience stabilize, experience blessing increase, empower time sun tip risen, self-arisen wisdom arise meaning. Or waning exhaustion middle, conception exhaustion meaning do. Fortunate one or two, three more meaning not accomplish (lines 1-10 of next section).
Watch the signs! Improvement arising—exert the primordial empowerment ritual. Accomplishment substance increasing—supreme siddhi obtained. Faith in equality meaning.
Entering empowerment, always see good signs. Common siddhis accomplished. Experience and knowledge possessed. Bliss and joy in conduct. Guru supreme, faith good—apply supreme mudra. See bliss in body, speech, self. This is Buddha's pure field.
Elaborationless empowerment—no particular year. Whoever knows the time. Summer and winter good. Waxing dates. Dawn when sounds clear. Five or six faith-possessing students—seven is too many for meaning to accomplish.
Faith-possessing son! Virtuous mind, praising guru with speech. At such empowerment time, if body bliss not, confess outer sins. Speech and mind too—start confession actions.
Very elaborationless—no elaborations at all. Supreme secret. Time and signs definite. Not particular year—self-suitable. Outer time: seed entering time, awakening seed supported. Grain and fruit gathering time. Wisdom fruit complete. Three kayas ground definitely go.
Inner time: waxing for increase, waning abandoned for stabilized experience. Blessing increasing. Sun tip risen—self-arisen wisdom arising. Or waning exhaustion middle—conception exhaustion.
Fortunate one or two only! Three is too many.
This time individual direction held, body time sky, clouds mist rain, wind etcetera sounds, place enemies thieves, unpleasant forms arisen, body sin great, outer empower, guru advice not shown, sugata kāya image or, own guru's room, circumambulation hundred-thousand six or, prostration hundred-thousand one do (lines 1-9). That time signs distinction, beginning have end middle, definite signs forms, body conduct purify, outer effort not need (lines 10-14). If end good arise, body completely finished not, outer again conduct start, again sin not pure, deity kāya thousand meditate, then guru oral instruction, sequence learn (lines 15-21). Speech time also thus, yogi possessing know (lines 22-23). Beginning end without middle arise, hundred syllables hundred-thousand one, effort with recite (lines 24-26). If end arise, secret mantra tantra self age number, hundred eight express (lines 27-29). Beginning end without times, tantra read mantra recite, guru yidam deity, praise various express, ali kali letter sounds, single separate express, HUM and PHAT and OM and, connected various express, month seven effort (lines 30-38). Then advice place do, yidam deity meditation, day three meditate (lines 39-41). If middle arise, mantra light emanate gather, day seven effort (lines 42-44). If end arise letter, emanate gather meditate, day ten interval effort (lines 45-47). Beginning end without all arise, completion stage meditate or, speech arising meditation, month six effort (lines 48-51). If body speech mind, conduct individual times, sky blue clouds without, wind hail sound not, gentle gentle arise, sin purify not need (lines 52-57).

Mind meditation falls, distracted memory lost, mind empowerment obtain (lines 75-77). If body obtain, emanation kāya this obtain, thus speech saṃbhogakāya, mind dharmakāya field go (lines 78-81).

Direction held! Sky, clouds, mist, rain, wind sounds. Enemies, thieves, unpleasant forms—signs of great body sin. Need outer empowerment. Guru advice not shown. Do circumambulation—hundred thousand six, or prostrations hundred thousand one. Purify!
Signs distinction: beginning, end, middle. Definite signs forms. Purify body conduct. If end signs good but body not finished, start outer conduct again. Sin not pure—meditate thousand deity kayas. Then learn guru's oral instruction.
Speech time too! Know this, yogi. Middle arising—recite hundred syllables hundred thousand one with effort. End arising—tantra self age number, hundred eight express. Beginning-end without—read tantra, recite mantra, praise guru, yidam, deity. Ali kali sounds, single separate. HUM PHAT OM connected. Seven months effort.
Then advice, yidam meditation—three days. Middle: mantra light emanate-gather, seven days. End: letter emanate-gather, ten days. All arising: completion stage or speech meditation, six months.

[The text continues with detailed descriptions of signs and purification methods for the very elaborationless empowerment.]
Very elaborationless—no elaborations at all! Yet time and signs definite. Outer time: fruit ripening, grain gathering—self-appearance liberated as fruit. Inner time: waxing first, or exhaustion middle—single bindu realized, karma and habitual tendencies exhausted.
Only one fortunate one! Two complete Buddha. More than that, yogi purpose not accomplished.
Faith-possessing son, fortune-possessing—empower one or two. They become Buddha, certain!
Empowerment time: sun tip risen. Individual words definite clear. See nature's pure basis. Whatever signs arise—sin purifies without ritual. Directly purified above.
If cloudless sky: dharmakaya field conduct. Various light expanse arises: sambhogakaya field. Various sounds heard: emanation field breathes.
This is the direct path! No elaborate ritual, no extensive preparation. Just recognition. The signs themselves are the purification. The time is when recognition arises.
But only for the most fortunate! Only for those with the karma ripened. For others, the elaborate path is necessary. Do not skip steps thinking you are more advanced than you are.
One or two—no more. In the very elaborationless, too many dilutes the blessing. Like trying to fill many cups from a single stream—the stream divides, none are full.

...continues from page 179...
If fortune possessing, the signs are clear. Direct recognition without elaboration. This is the pinnacle of the path—the very elaborationless empowerment where all distinctions dissolve into natural perfection.
What happens here? Not ritual, not ceremony, not elaborate mandala. Just the meeting of minds. Master and student recognizing simultaneously. The sun risen, words clear, nature seen.
This is not for everyone! Longchenpa has shown us the graduated path—from elaborate to simple, from many to one, from effort to effortlessness. Each step necessary for those who need it. Each step transcended by those who can.
The very elaborationless is the essence of all empowerments. It contains them, yet is free of them. Like space containing all, yet being none.
You who have read this far—do you understand? The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle is not a book to be read once and put aside. It is a manual for liberation, generation after generation. From Samantabhadra to Vajradhara to Vimalamitra to the masters of today—the stream continues.
The life-ten time is now. The teaching is here. The lineage is unbroken. What will you do with it?
Will you merely read and nod? Or will you enter the mandala, receive empowerment, practice day and night, and become the lineage holder for the next generation?
The choice is yours. The teaching is given. The master waits. The dakinis gather. The time is now.
Recognize!
PAGE 181 COMMENTARY
Ah, listen here, you who seek the path! Longchenpa has laid before you the body key-point at lines 7314-7316—seven years of exhaustion reached. Do you understand what this means? Like a farmer who has tilled the same field season after season, the body itself becomes the ground of ripening.
Look at lines 7317-7319: speech expression lost, twenty-one days, reality exhaustion ground reached. You think you need fancy words? No! The river doesn't need to explain itself to be wet. When speech falls away, what remains? That—look there!
Lines 7320-7322 speak of mind skilled, wind empty, appearance all exhausted. Like smoke rising from a fire and dissolving into the open sky—this is how thoughts exhaust themselves. You don't push them away; they exhaust naturally when you stop fanning the flames of grasping.
The four empowerments complete at lines 7318-7331—you think these are ceremonies? They're recognition! Like suddenly seeing your own face in a mirror you've walked past a thousand times without noticing. The mirror was always there. Your face was always there. You just weren't looking properly.
And this very rare supreme becoming at lines 7327-7328—don't think this is somewhere else, some other time. Like finding water by digging a well in your own courtyard. The water was always there, beneath your feet.
Son power enters purpose at line 7341. You are that son, that daughter. The power is not given from outside. It is your own nature remembering itself, like a person waking from a dream and realizing the dream-tiger never had teeth to harm them.
Listen well to the celebration sequences beginning at line 7343. These are not empty rituals—they are the play of your own awareness recognizing itself. Like a child playing, fully absorbed, yet knowing it is play. This is the great celebration.
