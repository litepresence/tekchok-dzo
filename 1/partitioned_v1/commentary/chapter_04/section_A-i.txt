You who would penetrate to the essence—attend! This page continues the profound explanations of the Great Perfection, gathering the teachings into their definitive meaning.
The liturgical text here moves through the final stages of classification, showing how all the various teachings of Atiyoga converge on a single point: the recognition of mind nature. Whether discussing the seventeen tantras, the three categories, the four cycles, or the countless enumerations, the purpose is always the same—to bring you face to face with what you already are.
Longchenpa is like a master jeweler showing you every facet of a diamond. Each facet reflects light differently. Each category of teaching approaches the truth from a different angle. But the diamond itself is one. Your nature is one. Do not mistake the facets for separate diamonds.
The Great Perfection is called "great" because it includes everything. Nothing is rejected. Samsara is not rejected—it is recognized as the play of awareness. Nirvana is not sought—it is recognized as the nature of awareness. Afflictions are not abandoned—they are recognized as wisdom. Virtue is not accumulated—it is recognized as natural expression.
This is why it is "perfection"—perfectly complete, perfectly pure, perfectly present. Not something to achieve. Not something to become. Something to recognize.
You might read these pages and think "This is too profound for me. I need something simpler." But simplicity and complexity are both concepts. The truth is beyond both. A simple pointing can be profound. A complex system can be clear. It depends on your capacity, your karma, your connection.
The Great Perfection teachings are here, available, complete. Study them. Practice them. But more than anything: recognize your own nature. That is the seed of liberation. That is the heart of the Buddhas. That is the essence of all these words.
Do not let the vastness intimidate you. The ocean is vast, but a single drop contains its nature. The sky is infinite, but this breath of air partakes of it. The teachings are profound, but your own mind is their source. Look there. Find peace there. Be free there.
You who have come this far—do not stop! This page, like those before it, continues the systematic presentation of the Great Perfection teachings. The seventeen tantras, the three categories, the countless enumerations—all are laid out with precision and care.
But now, having read through all these pages, having studied all these classifications, you must ask yourself: What have I understood? Not intellectually, not as information to recall, but in my bones, in my being, in the depths of my heart?
The purpose of all this teaching is not to make you a scholar. It is to wake you up. Like someone shaking you from sleep—the words are the shaking, but the waking is up to you. No one can wake up for you. You must open your own eyes.
So look! Right now. What is aware of these words? What knows the reading? Is it far away? Is it difficult to find? Or is it present, immediate, unmistakable? That which knows—knows. That which is aware—is aware. This is it. This has always been it.
All the tantras point here. All the categories converge here. The Mind Category, the Space Category, the Instruction Category—all are ways of saying: look at your mind. The four cycles—outer, inner, secret, unsurpassable—are stages of looking more and more closely until there is nothing left to see but seeing itself.
Do not be satisfied with understanding. Demand recognition. Do not be content with belief. Demand direct knowledge. The Great Perfection is not a religion to adopt; it is a reality to recognize. Your own face, your own nature, your own primordial freedom.
So practice. Study if it helps. Contemplate if it inspires. Meditate if it clarifies. But always return to this: what is the nature of the one who studies, contemplates, meditates? Find that, and you have found everything.
Longchenpa has given you the treasury. Now spend it. Do not hoard these teachings. Do not let them become dust on a shelf. Live them. Breathe them. Be them. This is the greatest offering you can make to the lineage, to your teachers, to yourself.
May you recognize your own nature. May you be free. May all beings recognize their own nature and be free. This is the wish of all Buddhas. This is the purpose of all teachings. This is the truth that has no end.
Listen, you who seek liberation! Longchenpa here shows us the tantras like a merchant displaying his wares—eighteen wrathful black ones, sixteen sequences, and more. But do not be fooled by the counting, you! (lines 1-41)
These tantras are not books on a shelf, not scriptures to be worshipped from afar. They are like maps drawn in the sky—visible yet empty, pointing to what has always been right here in your own mind. The Snake-Knot Tantra (line 1)—what is this snake but your own confusion, coiled around itself? And what cuts it? Not a blade from outside, but rigpa seeing its own face. Self-liberated, just as a knot unties itself when seen clearly.
The Great Garuda (line 3)—ah, this is you! Going through space without effort, without flapping wings, without destination. Have you not noticed? When you cease struggling, the sky is already open. The view is not something to be achieved, you fool! It is the very space in which you move.
And the River Tantra (line 7)—blessings flowing like water. Do you see? You are standing in this river now, have always been standing in it. The empowerment is not a ceremony performed once upon a time. It is this very awareness reading these words, self-arisen, never apart from you.
Longchenpa lists these treasures (lines 11-73), but I tell you—do not grasp at the list! The Treasury Tantra (line 11) says whatever desired arises from the wealthy treasury. What treasury? Your own mind! Richer than all the jewels of the three times. Whatever you need, it is already given. Why do you seek outside?
These eighteen wrathful ones (lines 13-17)—they protect the teachings, yes. But what teachings? The teaching that there is nothing to protect, no one to protect it. They guard the gateless gate. When you recognize that samsara itself is self-liberated through these tantras (line 53), what need for protection?
The Ocean, Sun, Lion, Mountain-King (lines 55-58)—these are not far away. Look at your own mind: vast as ocean, bright as sun, fearless as lion, unmoving as mountain. These tantras do not give you what you lack. They point to what you have never lost.
So read these words, but do not stop at the words. Let them cut through, like the Razor Tantra (line 13) says—cutting whatever it touches. Cut your concepts. Cut your grasping. Cut even the idea of cutting. Then rest, you, in what remains.
That is the purpose.
Now Longchenpa brings us to the heart of the matter—the three heart essences of tantra. Listen well, you who are weary of wandering! (lines 1-5)
Rigpa self-arisen, self-liberated, letterless—these three. What does this mean for you, right now? Like a king ruling people (line 7)—do you see? The king does not create the kingdom. The kingdom is already there. He simply recognizes his position and rules. Rigpa is like this king. It does not manufacture reality. It is the natural ruler, self-arisen, complete.
You have been searching for liberation like a subject paying taxes (line 17), working hard, struggling, serving. But the tantras tell us—self-liberated liberates that very meaning (line 19). The very thing you are seeking is the thing doing the seeking! Like trying to find your own head—you will never see it with your eyes, yet it has never been absent.
The three essences are shown (lines 25-35)—Samantabhadra mind-mirror, Vajrasattva heart-mirror, jewel spread. What are these but your own nature reflected back at you? When you reach the three mountains' peaks (line 33), you see all the low valleys. This is not climbing, you! This is simply stopping where you are and looking. The view has always been panoramic. You were just looking down at your feet.
The three flowers (lines 37-47)—pearl garland, auspicious beauty, lion power. Like three suns rising (line 45), clearing the world's darkness. But I ask you—where does the sun rise from? Does it travel from somewhere else? No! It is simply revealed when the earth turns. Your wisdom is like this sun—always shining, merely obscured by the clouds of your concepts.
The one summary (lines 49-55)—perfect self-arisen. Like a fort's foundation well-laid. Do you understand? Everything else—the practices, the rituals, the teachings—they are like roofs built upon this foundation. But if the foundation is rotten, what good the roof? The foundation is rigpa. Know this, and everything else falls into place naturally.
And when you know the appearance depth-complete (lines 57-61), you reach the fort's peak unpenetrable by armies. What armies? The armies of doubt, of distraction, of the eight worldly concerns. They cannot touch you when you abide in this recognition. You fear no samsara (line 61) because you see it has never been separate from nirvana.
This is not philosophy, you! This is your immediate experience. Look now—what is aware of these words? That is the king, the sun, the foundation. Rest there.
Longchenpa continues, showing the remaining tantras like a craftsman displaying his tools. But do not mistake the tools for the craft, you! (lines 1-31)
The limb tantras—jewel heap and blazing body-relic (lines 71-73)—like a fence around a fort. What are they fencing in? Not something precious kept outside, but your own wisdom appearing self-manifest (line 3). The fence is not to keep things out—it is to show you the boundary between confusion and recognition.
The yogic liberation tantra—blazing lamp (lines 7-11). Like a king residing in a palace, all desires accomplished. What palace? The palace of your own body! What king? The king of your own awareness! You have been wandering like a beggar outside your own home, not knowing the door is unlocked, the treasures within are already yours.
The heart-like tantras—six spaces (lines 15-19). Like a closed door where thieves find no entry. What thieves? The thieves of deviation, obscuration, obstacles. They cannot enter when you abide in view-realization. But see clearly—the door has never been closed! The thieves have never existed! This is just a way of speaking to those who fear.
The secret self-position tantras (lines 21-23)—sudden sound arising, cutting all doubts like an iron fence. Sudden sound! This is rigpa snapping its fingers. In an instant, all conceptual mind is cut through. Have you experienced this? One moment lost in thought, the next—clarity, naked awareness. That is sudden sound.
And the weapon-like tantras (lines 25-31)—the black wrathful one, striking contradiction. Like a good doorkeeper. But who is the doorkeeper? Your own alertness, your own natural vigilance. Not something you must create, but something that arises spontaneously when recognition is present.
Then Longchenpa summarizes with beautiful metaphors (lines 37-79)—king, minister, subject gathered; reaching three mountains' peaks; three suns rising; fort's foundation well-set; reaching fort's peak; opening windows in four directions; fencing around; placing a king; fastening doors; iron fences; armored doorkeepers.
All these are pointing to one thing: the natural perfection of your own mind. Do not be distracted by the multiplicity! All these tantras, all these categories—they are like different fingers pointing at the same moon. Look at the moon, you, not the fingers!
The third topic follows (lines 83-86)—order determined, gathered at end. Like a shepherd gathering his flock. All these teachings, all these methods—they are gathered back into the single nature of mind. From the Pearl Garland (line 35), Vajra-holder certainly united.
United with what? With what has never been separate.
Now we come to the eight sections, like eight facets of a single jewel. Listen, you who are confused by variety! (lines 1-69)
Two root tantras (lines 1-9)—perfect self-arisen and letterless. These are like the root of a tree. Without root, no branches, no leaves, no fruit. The root tantras empower and ripen through outer elaborations, and show the complete point that ripens and liberates. Do you see? One is for those who need form, the other for those who can go directly. But both are showing the same truth.
The explanatory mother and child tantras (lines 11-19)—rigpa self-arisen and rigpa self-liberated. Like mother and child, they share one nature. The mother tantra shows the special clarity of view, meditation, conduct, result. The child tantra shows the elimination of the mother's ground's object. What does this mean? The ground is delusion. When delusion is eliminated, what remains? Only rigpa, shining clear.
Two limb tantras (lines 21-29)—jewel heap and blazing body-relic. Like limbs of a body, they are essential. One shows qualities complete in themselves, the other shows signs of body, speech, and mind. These are not additions to your nature! They are descriptions of what is already complete within you.
The scripture-logic clear tantras (lines 31-39)—sudden sound and auspicious beauty. Like eyes that see clearly. One shows the root of all scriptural collections, the other identifies delusion's time. When recognition arises suddenly, like sound in silence, that is the root of all scriptures. When you see the nature of delusion, it is auspicious, beautiful—because it shows you what is not deluded.
Four upadesha tantras (lines 41-59)—vajra-sattva heart-mirror, samantabhadra mind-mirror, introduction adorned, pearl garland. These are the direct instructions! Introduction and meeting, empowerment and samaya, distinction and elimination of deviation, examples and meanings with faith, instruction collected causing awakening. These are not information to be memorized, you! They are methods for causing recognition to arise in your direct experience.
Three intention self-position tantras (lines 61-69)—six spaces, blazing lamp, sun-moon-joined. These are about purification and seeing. The six consciousnesses' birth-places purified, the three realms emptied. The four actual lamps seen. The four intermediate states carried on the path. This is the path of direct perception, not gradual accumulation.
Two entering self-liberation tantras (lines 71-73 in next section)—lion-power dzogchen and jewel arrangement. Bringing out the form of view, entering the yogi's path. This is the swift path, the path of courage.
And the expert ritual tantra (lines 77-79)—glorious black wrathful, protecting the supreme teachings. Like a guardian at the gate.
All these from the Pearl Garland (line 21). Ah! Supreme wonder, great! (line 25) Indeed! The wonder is that all of this is already accomplished in your own mind.
Longchenpa now shows us why these eight sections are necessary. Listen carefully, you who think you can skip steps! (lines 1-67)
The tantra sequence is explained (lines 29-45)—two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence. Like the trunk of a tree. Two explanatory tantras explain as leaves spreading. Two limb tantras explain like planets and stars arising from oceans. Two scripture-logic tantras explain like flowers opening. Four upadesha tantras explain as ripening results. Three intention tantras explain as seeing the peak. Two entering tantras explain as mindful basis and heart. Expert ritual tantras explain like a dog that does the messenger's work.
What does this mean for you? It means the teachings have structure, like a body has structure. You cannot have a head without a body, you cannot have realization without foundation.
The reasons for establishing eight sections (lines 49-66)—if the two root tantras are lacking, like a trunk with rotten roots, branches cannot arise. You see? Without understanding the root nature of mind, all other practices are like painting flowers on a rock. Beautiful, but without life.
If the two explanatory tantras are lacking, like no leaves from that—no flowers arise. Without understanding how phenomena spread from the root, you cannot recognize their display.
If the two limb tantras are lacking, like climbing a cliff without limbs—one falls. Without the supports of qualities and signs, you have nothing to hold onto in your practice.
If the two entering tantras are lacking, like a corpse without a heart—cannot benefit others. Without actually entering the path of self-liberation, you are dead to the dharma, no matter how much you know.
If the two scripture-logic tantras are lacking, if no flowers exist, results do not ripen in time. Without clear understanding, your practice bears no fruit.
If the four upadesha tantras are lacking, if no results, agriculture is meaningless. Without direct instruction, all your effort is wasted.
If the three intention tantras are lacking, like a person without eyes not knowing the way, unable to enter a city. Without seeing the actual nature, you wander blindly.
If the expert ritual tantra is lacking, like a watchdog gone, wealth lost to thieves. Without protection of the teachings, they are stolen by misunderstanding.
Thus, lacking those eight: the condition of the teachings is incomplete (line 15). If they exist, complete: appropriate and certain in eight (line 17). If more than that: not needed (line 19).
Do you hear this? Not needed! Beyond these eight, nothing more is required. Do not accumulate teachings like a merchant hoards goods. These eight are sufficient. The rest is elaboration.
Now Longchenpa explains the names and meanings of the eight sections. Listen, you who get lost in terminology! (lines 21-53)
Root: penetrated like roots—intends gathering into rigpa (line 23). Do you see? The root is not something to cling to. It is what gathers everything into the single nature of mind. Like tree roots drawing water from the earth, the root tantras draw all phenomena into the recognition of rigpa.
Explanation: spreading like leaves—intends merging words and meanings (line 25). Words and meanings merged—not separate! When you hear "rigpa," do you merge the word with the experience, or do they remain apart? This is the test.
Branch: coiled like a trunk—intends non-duality of space and awareness (line 27). The trunk supports everything. Space and awareness are not two things that need to be joined. They have never been separate, like a tree trunk and the space it occupies.
Scripture-logic: clear like a flower—intends holding and showing the lamp's self-face (line 31). A flower is beautiful, clear, unmistakable. When you see your true nature, it is like this—unmistakable, clear as a flower in bloom.
Upadesha: ripening like results—intends making three kāyas into paths (line 33). Ripening! This is not something you do. This is something that happens when conditions are present. The three kāyas are not destinations. They are the path itself.
Intention self-abiding: liberation path seeing—intends making results into paths (line 35). The result is already present, so it becomes the path. Do you understand? You are not going somewhere you are not. You are recognizing where you already are.
Entering self-liberation: mindfulness-awareness path cultivated, courageous ones—intends showing the lamp's very self-face (line 37). This takes courage! To look directly at your own mind without turning away. To see the lamp's own face—not the light it casts, but the lamp itself.
Expert ritual: complete upadesha scripture—intends protecting the holy teachings and abiding long (line 39). Protection, yes. But protection of what? The recognition in your own mind.
Then Longchenpa examines the letters (lines 41-53)—called "root"—dharma's root gathered into rigpa. Rigpa's root: emptiness, nature, grasped and freed (line 43). Holding that tantra: rigpa meets its own face (line 45). Worn: samādhi abides in itself (line 47). Read: expressed meanings appear in mind (line 49). Explained: supreme and common siddhis obtained (line 51). Meditated: samsara expelled (line 53).
Each word—root, holding, worn, read, explained, meditated—points to the same truth. The tantra is not outside. It is your own awareness, meeting its own face.
Now Longchenpa distinguishes different types of upadesha and explains key terms. Listen sharply, you who confuse levels of teaching! (lines 1-63)
Listening, exercising the wisdom of the state (line 1). This listening is not ordinary hearing. It is listening with the wisdom that is your own nature. When you hear these words, is there not an immediate knowing? That is the wisdom of the state.
Upadesha elaboration, word-upadesha cast into words—meaning does not reach immediately (line 3). This is important! Many teachings are just words about wisdom. They circle around the truth but do not touch it directly. Do not mistake the finger pointing for the moon, you!
Essence-gathered meaning-upadesha, without depending on words—buddhahood (line 5). Here it is! The essence-gathered meaning that does not depend on words. This is the direct introduction, the pointing out instruction. When your teacher points and you recognize, no words are needed. Buddha is not somewhere else. Buddha is this very recognition.
Upadesha expression depending: inexpressible awareness-meaning arises in tantra (lines 7-9). Even the inexpressible is expressed—what a miracle! Like trying to describe the taste of water to one who has never drunk. Yet somehow, through skillful means, the tantra expresses what cannot be expressed.
Explanation words: depending on elaboration of words—demonstrates wisdom free of elaboration (lines 11-13). This is the great joke of the dharma! We use elaboration to show what is free of elaboration. We use concepts to point beyond concepts. It is like using a thorn to remove a thorn, then throwing both away.
Intention: dharmatā transcending intervals, without gap (lines 15-17). That self-abiding, not arising from other (line 19). Dharmatā—the nature of phenomena—has no gaps, no intervals, no separation. It is self-abiding, not created by anything else. Your awareness is like this. It does not arise from somewhere else. It has always been present.
Scripture: unchanging, stable—confidence arises (lines 21-23). When you recognize the unchanging nature, confidence naturally arises. Not confidence in something, but confidence as your own nature.
Awareness: depending on that meaning—liberates to the Buddha level (lines 25-27). Liberates! Not gradually, not eventually. Liberates now, in this very moment of recognition.
Clarity: knowledge clear—abides nowhere (lines 29-31). This is the clarity that has no location, the knowing that is not fixed anywhere. Faculty clear—distinguishes dharma and non-dharma (line 33). Five faculties placed in themselves—the six aggregates merely tremble (line 35). When the faculties rest in their own nature, the aggregates lose their power over you. They tremble like leaves in wind, but you are unmoved.
Holding those—transcend the three realms (line 37). The three realms are transcended not by going somewhere else, but by holding the faculties in their natural state.
Entering emptiness, entering appearances—appearance-mind mouth-joined (line 39). Entering appearance-emptiness—object and mind non-dual (line 41). Self-liberated—uncontrived (line 43). This is the path! Entering emptiness, entering appearances—both are the same entry. Appearance and mind are not two. Object and mind are not two. Self-liberated without contrivance.
Expert—expert in time and crucial points: merely thinking accomplishes destruction (lines 45-47). Expert in action and completion: merely examining mind accomplishes without need for mantra and samādhi—steals life-force (lines 49-49). Expert in time mantra and samādhi: deity approaches, siddhis arise (line 51). Expert in time approach-accomplish action-application: accomplishes self-wished benefits (line 53). Expert in substance and offering: increases prosperity, accomplishes actions (line 55).
These are the skills of the practitioner who knows the crucial points. Not skills learned from books, but from direct recognition of mind's nature.
Thus established, from those: for those liking mental elaboration—all shown (lines 57-59). For middling ones, those gathered into eight sections—accomplished by eight tantras (lines 61-61). For excellent ones, those transformed—tantra's meaning condensed (lines 63-63).
Three types of beings, three approaches. But in the end, all reach the same place. Do not be proud if you are "excellent," nor discouraged if you need elaboration. The destination is the same.
Now we come to methods of explanation. Listen, you who want to know how to understand these teachings! (lines 1-89)
Method divided: two (line 1). Nature divided: three, five sufficient (line 2). Excellent ones: meaning and word tantra two shown (line 3). Very excellent, elaboration-free, basis tantra awareness alone accomplishes (line 4). Awareness, tantra all complete reason (line 5).
Do you see the progression? From elaborate methods to direct recognition. For some, two methods; for others, three or five divisions. For the excellent, just meaning and word. For the very excellent, awareness alone accomplishes all. Where do you fall in this spectrum? Be honest with yourself!
From Thalgyur (line 11)—Also tantra's dharmatā explained (line 13). True dharmatā sound result (line 15). Self-nature letterless (line 17). Self-awareness wisdom lamp light blazing (line 19). Dharmatā pure, auspicious beautiful (line 21). View fear-free, lion power perfect (line 23). Self-awareness ripened, perfect self-arisen (line 25). Neck-thread connected, pearl string (line 27). Experience appearance wealth arranged (line 29). Self-abide empty, heart mirror (line 31). Error self-cut, mind mirror (line 33). Other not-arisen, self-arise itself (line 35). Self-arisen, thus self-liberated (line 37). Sphere one, thus six spaces (line 39). Qualities perfected, jewel pile (line 41). Self-awareness shown, face-show adorned (line 43). Appearance pure, sun moon joined (line 45). Awareness ripening, body-relic blazing (line 47). These all basis-arisen (line 49). Thus said (line 51).
This is a summary of all tantras in a few lines! Self-nature letterless—the true nature cannot be captured in letters or words. Self-awareness wisdom lamp light blazing—your own awareness is the lamp, blazing with light. Letterless yet illuminating everything.
Or elaboration-possess: basis heart tantra bindu all (line 53). Medium: seventeen (line 55). Excellent: self-arisen seed tantra alone (line 57). Peak: transcendent-future-three liberation explained (line 59).
From Ati Great Arrangement (line 61)—That meaning word various elaboration, elaboration-possess: basis-heart (lines 63-65). Elaboration-free: enumerate seventeen (line 67). Very elaboration-free (line 69). Very elaboration-free indeed, free from elaboration and its absence, transcendent-future-three liberated (lines 71-75). Thus it is spoken (line 77).
General meaning second, explanation method branch definite: three (line 79)—How explained manner, occasion basis definite enumeration, holy certain prophecy (lines 81-85). First: three, explanation method's summary establishing (lines 87-89).
The explanation method is threefold: how it is explained, the definite enumeration of occasion and basis, and holy certain prophecy. Do not rush through these! Understanding how the teachings are structured helps you enter them properly.
Remember—awareness alone accomplishes. All these divisions and enumerations are for those who need them. If you can recognize awareness directly, what need for elaboration?
Thus is the definitive manner of explanation established (line 1). The arising-basis of letters, their sounds and meanings hereby declared (line 3). Listen well, you who would understand the very structure of these teachings!
First: Though explanation methods are manifold, in summary they are established as three (lines 5-7). From Rigpa Rangdrol (line 9)—The King of Teachings' manner of explanation also is expounded according to this very occasion (lines 11-13). Scripture-style explanation and tantra-style explanation, instruction-style explanation—these three (lines 15-17). Through the gate of entry they are to be known (line 19). Thus it is spoken (line 21).
Three styles—scripture, tantra, instruction. Each for different capacities, different needs. But all lead to the same recognition. Do not think one is superior to another! They are medicine for different diseases.
There, scripture-style explanation is shown by means of the five perfections (line 23), tantra-style explanation is declared by means of the three definite abodes (line 25), oral instruction is explained by basis, path, and result—these three (lines 27-27), from which here the main tantra-style explanation has three abodes (lines 29-29):
For the sharp-facultied, by mentioning names, toward realization's face the tantra's name-meaning is expressed (lines 31-31); for the middling, by mentioning types only, toward realization's face the five perfect complete-abidings are shown (lines 33-33); and for the dull, with example and meaning, toward realization's face the body is extensively explained (lines 35-35).
Three types of beings, three ways of teaching. The sharp-facultied hear a name and recognize immediately. The middling need types and classifications. The dull need extensive examples and explanations. Be honest—which are you? There is no shame in being dull! Better to be a dull practitioner who recognizes than a sharp one who is proud.
First: From that itself—that also name explained is like this: name, homage, and promise (lines 37-43). Thus it is spoken (line 45).
Second: Also from that itself—the introduction shown is like this: teacher, mother, and the retinue, and father's request—all are to be known (lines 47-55). Thus it is spoken (line 57).
Third: The body brief, extensive, extremely extensive by means shown, conclusion with meaning and rejoicing (lines 59-63). From Rangdrol: text shown is like this: sūtra and great extensive, and extremely great extensive explained (lines 65-71). That is shown by the text's words (line 73).
Conclusion's meaning is like this: oral instruction meaning untied explained, that great tantra is definitely shown (lines 75-79). Secret mantra all's explanation method—thus all are to be known (lines 81-83). Thus it is spoken (line 85).
That also, from the manner of explanation method's two definite branches: first, grounded by five types, is explained (lines 87-89).
From the Sun-Moon-Joined Tantra (line 91)—By root meaning: name-identity grasped (line 93). By yoga meaning: conclusion gate shown (line 95). By purpose meaning: one's place established (line 97).
These are the five types—root, yoga, purpose, word, history. Each serves a function. Together they ground the explanation so it cannot be shaken by doubt or confusion.
By word meaning, the straight line is connected (line 1). By history meaning, the minds are satisfied (line 3). Thus it is spoken (line 5).
Thus, when not explained, the defects are (line 7). From that itself—if history meaning is not explained, toward this Secret Great Definite Teaching, the defect of mind-not-believing arises (lines 9-15). If root meaning is not explained, dharmas are not gathered into rigpa—the defect of limitless arises (lines 17-21). If yoga meaning is not explained, vehicle distinctions are not divided—big and small ranks become meaningless (lines 23-27). If great meaning is not explained, toward Great Perfection without effort—the defect of meaninglessness arises (lines 29-33). If word meaning is not explained, when tantras are clearly ranked, the defect of not grasping letters arises (lines 35-39). Thus it is spoken (line 41).
Do you see? Each type of explanation serves a purpose. Without history, no faith. Without root meaning, no gathering into rigpa. Without yoga meaning, confusion about vehicles. Without great meaning, the Great Perfection seems meaningless. Without word meaning, cannot read the tantras. All are necessary!
Well explained, the benefits are (line 43). From that itself—thus, when defects are abandoned, all qualities become perfect (lines 45-49). Thus it is spoken (line 51).
The purpose is (line 53). From Rigpa Rangdrol: to protect one's own view and to refute others' views—also called "to explain" (lines 55-61). Thus it is spoken (line 63).
When extensively enumerated with certainty: various jewel examples: twenty-three, the five chapters of the Wish-fulfilling Tree—the twenty-eight methods are explained (lines 65-71).
Also from that (line 73)—By tigress-leap wisdom, the great earth is cut and explained (lines 75-77). By mind like a garuda soaring in the sky, chests of meaning are filled and explained (lines 79-81). By mind like a lion's roar, lower vehicles are suppressed and explained (lines 83-85). By mind like a tortoise's slow movement, letters are grasped and explained (lines 87-89). By mind like a raven's claw, error and obscuration are cut and explained (lines 91-93). By mind like a wrestler's striking method, extensive meaning is gathered and explained (lines 95-97). By mind like a sleeping elephant, the view is introduced and focused (lines 99-101).

By mind like ripening fruit, results are explained without return (lines 187-189).
Twenty-eight methods, each with its metaphor! What is the point of all these metaphors? To show that explanation can take countless forms, yet all point to the same recognition. The garuda soaring, the tortoise moving slowly, the razor cutting—all different approaches, same destination.
Those and other explanation methods—are to be known in order (lines 191-193). Thus it is spoken (line 195). Thus explained and heard (line 197).
Now you have heard. The question is—have you recognized?
Vajra-holder, Vajrasattva visualized (lines 1-3). Dharma light-rays pervading sky, emanated—beings in fields of dust-count hear, ignorance's sleep is awakened, wisdom's meaning obtained, liberation's path entered (lines 5-13).
Listen to this, you who feel small and powerless! The visualization is not fantasy. When you visualize Vajrasattva, you are not making something up. You are recognizing what is already present. The dharma light-rays pervading the sky—this is your own awareness, extending everywhere, touching all beings. The "fields of dust-count" are the countless thoughts and perceptions. They all hear the dharma when awareness recognizes itself.
Word-meaning's abode realized, meditating: listeners, heroes of the lineage, and mind-consorts, knowing dakinis' appearance—practicing mind's sublime clear light, realized, focused (lines 15-23).
The dakinis are not external spirits! They are the appearances of your own mind, dancing in space. When you recognize them as such, they become allies, not obstacles. The clear light is not something to be achieved through effort. It is the natural luminosity of your own awareness, always present, merely obscured by grasping.
Self and limitless sentient beings are primordially Buddha—knowing that, self-nature, supreme awakening generated (lines 25-31).
This is the key! You are primordially Buddha. All beings are primordially Buddha. Not will be, not can become. ARE. Right now. This is not wishful thinking. This is the nature of reality. When you know this, truly know it in your bones, supreme awakening is not generated as something new. It is recognized as what has always been.
Thus: In actual Akanishtha's field, appearance: natureless mandala of five perfections' dharma-wheel arisen—for sentient beings and teachings to abide long: dedication: May the Buddha's teachings flourish and spread! May all sentient beings be blissful and happy! May they practice dharma day and night! May self and other benefit arise spontaneously! Thus to be spoken (lines 33-46).
Akanishtha—the highest pure realm. But where is it? Not somewhere else! It is this very appearance, when recognized as natureless, as the mandala of five perfections. The five perfections are not somewhere else. They are the perfection of your own teacher, place, retinue, dharma, and time—right here, right now, when recognized.
Third topic: arisen-basis letters' sound and meaning explained—two: letter-cloud's nature generally shown, and abode-definite specifically explained (lines 49-53). First has four: abode-nature-meaning's letter, body-abode-channel's letter, expression-sound's letter, result's ultimate letter (lines 55-63).
Now we come to the letters. Do not think these are just Sanskrit phonemes! They are the very structure of reality, the patterns through which awareness expresses itself. The letter-cloud is like the sky filled with writing—everywhere, yet empty.
First: Mind-nature, naturally clear light, self-arisen wisdom—transcending eternalism and nihilism, coming and going—is the nature (lines 67-67). Called "letter of sphere-ultimate reality" (line 69). From the Secret Essence of Magical Display: mind-nature is letter's nature—letter: wish-fulfilling jewel cloud (lines 71-75). Thus (line 77).
Mind-nature IS the letter's nature! The letter is not something else. It is your own mind, naturally clear light, self-arisen wisdom. It transcends eternalism and nihilism—it is not permanent, not annihilated. It does not come or go. This is the true letter, the wish-fulfilling jewel cloud.
Second: In the body's four channel-wheels' center, within the three heart-channels existing as three pillars—OM AH HUM: these self-arisen letters three, colors white-red-blue three, abiding (lines 79-84).
The body is the mandala! The channels are not just physical structures. They are the pathways of awareness. OM AH HUM—white, red, blue—body, speech, mind. These are already present in your heart center. You do not need to create them. You need to recognize them.
Outer: body, speech, mind—three (line 1). Inner: afflictions, poisons—three (line 3). Secret: body, speech, mind—three's support (line 5). With light-rays five's radiance existing: in wheels four's channel-petals: father, mother, method, wisdom's letters: vowel letters sixteen and consonants—thirty-four (lines 7-13).
Listen, you who think the teachings are merely philosophical! Here is the architecture of your own being. Body, speech, mind—outer level. Afflictions and poisons—inner level. The supports—secret level. All expressed through the letters, the very sounds and forms that structure your experience.
Singles, doubles, prefixes, through branch divisions: all eighty-four thousand abiding (lines 15-21). Outer: body's aggregates, elements, sense-fields' support. Cause of speech and expression arising (lines 23-25). Inner: afflictions, thought-collections, eighty-four thousand's support. Day and night, conceptions many arisen, support doing (lines 27-29). Secret: when pure, dharma's gates that many arising, support doing (lines 31-31).
Eighty-four thousand—this is not an arbitrary number. It represents the eighty-four thousand types of afflictions, and thus the eighty-four thousand dharma gates to liberation. Every affliction contains its own liberation. Every poison is itself medicine when recognized.
That also: each consonant with vowel letters sixteen's sound nearby abiding (lines 33-33). Letter's form also that's sound whatever arisen, stacked—for example: KA KĀ—within, life A existing: called A Ā (lines 35-39).
The letter A is the life of all letters! It is the open sound, the space from which all sounds emerge. Just as awareness is the "life" of all appearances—all appearances arise within awareness, are pervaded by awareness, yet awareness itself is empty like the sound of A.
From Symbolic Expression: A is all letters' supreme—within, arisen, birthless (lines 41-45). Thus (line 47): KI KĪ is Ī. KU KŪ is Ū. KE KAI is E AI. KO KAU is O AU. KRA KRA is RA RA. RI RĪ and LI LĪ: life A existing, KI KĪ gathered—AṂ AḤ is KAṂ KAḤ called (lines 49-61).
The vowels emerge from A, modify the consonants, give them life and direction. Just as the manifestations of awareness take countless forms, yet all arise from the same empty ground.
Those root letters: double-stacked KKA said is great. GHA JHA DHA BHA: said like thick (lines 63-65). Triple-stacked and five-stacked, etc.: called "sphere's single letter" (lines 67-69). Suitable ones read as one. Unsuitable ones read separately (lines 71-73).
Channels in thus existing: body, speech, mind, wisdom five, etc., in different spheres (lines 75-75). Letters and similar: light five's appearance having—just brush-strokes, essence white-red, in wind's center, self-clear existing (lines 77-77).
Now: the clear root letters—memory clear, wisdom great—sense-fields clear and unclear: those reverse (lines 79-83). Youth: root letters clear, mind sharp, sense-fields clear (line 85). Old age: root letters unclear, diminished (lines 87-87).
Do you see? Youth and old age are not just physical conditions. They are states of clarity. In youth, the channels are clear, the letters are distinct, awareness is sharp. In old age, they become obscured. This is why it is said to practice while young! But even in old age, recognition is possible. The nature of mind does not age.
Third: sound's letter is: speech—speaking ones (lines 1-3). Cause: root letters, wind-moved, arise (line 5). Condition: tongue and palate's action, arise (line 7).
Listen! Sound is not separate from the one who speaks. The root letters are moved by wind—the wind of prana, the energy of awareness. The tongue and palate are the conditions. This is the dependent arising of speech—wind moves, conditions meet, sound emerges. But from where? From nowhere! From the same emptiness from which all things emerge.
That also: within, A-like arises, throat: KA etc. arise, tongue-tip: TA THA etc. arise, tongue-tip and palate two meet: crown arises—called so (lines 9-13). RA LA-like: tongue and palate strongly joined: ṬA ṬHA arise (lines 15-15). Lips: PA PHA BA BHA MA said like—these sounds: whatever expressed, arise depending on those places (lines 17-19).
Each sound has its place of arising—throat, tongue-tip, palate, crown, lips. This is the anatomical structure of sacred speech. But more than anatomy, it is the energetic structure. The sounds arise in specific locations because those locations correspond to different energies, different aspects of awareness.
Fourth: ultimate result's letter is: Buddha's speech, sixty vowels, appear—from enjoyment-body's channels, abodes, pure letters (lines 21-25). Letters emanated: in sky, dharma-sounds famous (line 27). Letters emanated: Buddha's body etc. become, sentient beings' benefit performing (lines 29-29). Enjoyment-body and emanation-body's root letters: wisdom five's appearance adorned (lines 31-31).
This existing: depending, Buddha-time, sūtras and tantras enumerate measureless sentient beings appear (lines 33-33). Emanation: sentient beings' benefit arising (lines 35-35).
Second: abodes definite, specifically explained—five: root letters briefly shown, branch prefixes extensively divided, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa explained manner definite, abode enjoyment explained, those expression manner shown (lines 37-57).
First: KA A KHA GA NGA / CA CHA JA VA / ṬA ṬHA ḌA ṆA / TA THA DA NA / PA PHA BA MA / YA RA LA / ṢA ṢA SA HA KṢAḤ (lines 59-73).
The thirty-four consonants. These are not arbitrary! Each contains an entire universe of meaning. KA—the first, the primordial. A—the life-giver. Each letter is a complete mandala. Each sound is a complete teaching.
When you recite these, do not just make sounds! Recognize that each sound is the expression of awareness, each vibration is the play of wisdom. The letters are not external to you. They are the very structure of your being.
