[17984-17989] Object many on enter from focus one on not-decide superimposition and. Move on obstacle nonexistent wind and. Object desire through of intoxicate mire and. One from many conceptions spread fire and. Object accept desire bird and. Knowledge power expand through of meaning examine branch and.
[17990-17995] Object through of awareness grasp that power into gone actor and. Not-diverge object knowledge direction not-give waver mad like mind. These all also object and condition through of virtuous non-virtuous unspecified mind three gather. Mind from intellect arise. All search intellect etc six. Third that from arise affliction distinction on three.
[17996-18001] Six root afflictions. Sixteen proximate afflictions. Subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions. First is sun-moon union from. Afflictions is six. Non-awareness thus called basis delusion-conception part grasp.
[18002-18007] Delusion is wisdom part from delusion. Anger is produce sequence from delusion. Pride is view part from delusion. Desire is appearance part from delusion. Jealousy is nonrealized part from delusion thus. That-also sequence like object subject delusion-conception part delusion and.

[18033-18038] That alone not-know delusion through of all affliction make and. Object on mind grasp and. Subject on grasp intellect and. Both on self as grasp and. All conception and. Meaning non-awareness and.
[18039-18044] Nature aim not-see and. Word meaning nonrealized and. General-specific not-understand and. Delusion know after promise meaning before wrong form and. Object I as grasp and. Other excellence on not-happy and.
[18045-18050] Object take and. Object on special desire and. Slightly puff pride and. Object on spread anger. Third subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions on three. Twenty-five. Fifty-one. Thousand eight ten four.
[18051-18056] First is root non-awareness pervader exist through of separately not-counted. Pervaded five-poisons on five distinguish through of twenty-five. Self-arisen from. Delusion on five. Very-dull delusion and. Not-know delusion and.

[18087-18092] Second fifty-one is that like twenty-five on object grasp afflictions twenty-five. Subject grasp afflictions twenty-five fifty. Root non-awareness and root one arise. Third thousand eight ten four. Desire from become twenty-one thousand. Anger from become twenty-one thousand.
[18093-18098] Delusion from become twenty-one thousand. Part equal from become twenty-one thousand. Sum thousand eight and four. Afflictions eighty-four thousand also clear limitless distinguish if measure nonexistent mind not-comprehend. That-also arise from. That from mind not-comprehend speech not-utter.
[18099-18104] Count impossible arise thus. These all also mind and. Intellect and. Recollection and. Latency and. Doubt through of produce and all from arise and affliction influence through of imprint through of samsara affliction do action-possess.
[18105-18110] Sun-moon union from. These etc afflictions is thought all follow hold mind and. Recollection all follow hold intellect and. Interval connect latency and. Doubt all basis become conception and. Object and thing grasp part etc measure nonexistent thus.
[18111-18116] That like karma and afflictions all three-realm mind mental-factors on depend through of. That also consciousness group eight. Basis-all consciousness object not-think appear cause become consciousness conception-nonexistent clear and. That from spread door five knowledge from. Eye consciousness form grasp conception-nonexistent. Ear consciousness sound grasp conception-nonexistent.
[18117-18122] Nose consciousness smell grasp conception-nonexistent. Tongue consciousness taste grasp realize-nonexistent. Body consciousness touch grasp conception-nonexistent. That from grasp-holder intellect-consciousness two. Object first general grasp intellect-consciousness and. After particular grasp affliction-intellect.
[18123-18128] Grasped and grasper. Intellect-consciousness this two on. Virtuous non-virtuous unspecified three exist and. Conception-possess conception-nonexistent each suitable exist. Door five and basis-all consciousness conception-nonexistent. Thus three-realm mind and mental-factors fifty-one all abandon object superimposition only.
[18129-18134] Two-truths from. Mind and mental-factors three-realm. Superimposition form-possess conception. Thus. These abandon object. Non-awareness nature is reason.
[18135-18140] Here mind path make Buddha desire great-text madhyamaka etc tradition through of also. Mind and mind-itself two distinguish through of mind group eight or seven or six nature abandon object gather through of. Mind-itself nature through of pure accept object realize through of path cultivate on enter do. This also that and part similar. Awareness and awareness from arise mind-itself and. Self characteristic grasp mind thus explain.
[18141-18146] Six-expanse from. Hey mind-hero great. Awareness and awareness from arise mind-itself is stain and conception all from beyond. Brief nirvana cause and fruit all. Awareness self-appearance see beings object-field. Self characteristic grasp mind is thus superimpose appearance all and.
