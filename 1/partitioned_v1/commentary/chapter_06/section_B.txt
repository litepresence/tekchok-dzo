Listen, you who would accomplish! Lines [11290-11309] reveal the effortless action of self-liberation!
Action accomplished! How? Not through effort! Not through striving! These self-cease! Dharmas all self-place! Self-liberate! Complete from the base of appearance!
Like dust settling on a mirror—the dust does not change the mirror! Like waves on the ocean—the waves do not change the water!
Subtle dust free! Impurity free! Attain what was never lost! Beyond conceptualization! Beyond objects! Dharmata cannot be opened by any means—it is already open!
Nature complete! Causes appear! Ends exhaust! Simultaneously realized! Desire-free accomplishment! No repetition! No reversion!
This is the meaning of primordial dwelling—not achieved, not cultivated, not fabricated! Knowledge itself manifests! Dharmas all exhaust! Reach the place that is no place!
Dharma-space vast! No limit perceived! No center found! Liberation's base is pure dharmata! Engage without engaging! Act beyond worldly action!
Nature clear and resounding! Like a bell struck in empty space—the sound arises without source, without obstruction!
Do not try to accomplish what is already accomplished! Do not strive for what has always been present! Simply recognize the self-liberated nature of all that arises!
Like a snake uncoiling itself—no one else needs to straighten it!
Emaho! The spontaneous completion of all action!
COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 273
You who want to understand the base! Longchenpa speaks from the Rangshar at lines [11335-11346]: That all essence primordially-pure actual-state called, India also not-cut direction where-also not-fall, that below spontaneous-presence jewel casket called exist and, that at arise-manner form six exist, gate form two exist, that base spontaneous-presence called, base not-certain called, base various arise called also, that below reverse ground exist, that below base appearance great called exist, that below enjoyment-body appearance exist thus spoke. You hear "base" and you think it is a thing, a foundation, something solid to stand on. Foolish! The base is the actual state—primordially pure, not falling in any direction, not cut by any boundary. India is just a name. Direction is just a concept. The base does not fall anywhere because it is everywhere.
The jewel casket of spontaneous presence—below it, forms arise in six manners, gates exist in two forms. Called spontaneous presence, called not-certain, called various arising. Below that, reverse ground exists. Below that, base appearance great is called. Below that, enjoyment body appearance exists. You think these are levels, stages, something to climb. They are not. They are descriptions of how the base appears—not certain, various, spontaneously present. Like the ocean that can be calm or wavy, yet remains ocean.
At lines [11347-11364], here that meaning elaborate explain if, beginning expanse youth vase body inside essence body-as abide, nature speech-as abide, compassion mind-as abide, that-also life-wind limb four possession wisdom wind five essence awareness abide resonance outside appear from, youth vase body limitless not-separate spontaneous-presence resonance from light five appearance flame each arise and together, compassion awareness resonance form investigate knowledge arise that also, self-face not-know just part from awareness depend ignorance called abide, that word base not-change although base appear arise change change similar become is, awareness appearance change called, that time primordially-pure appearance like sky cloud not-exist like state from, spontaneous-presence arise-manner eight self-appearance arise, jewel casket actual-state great appearance is, compassion like arise understanding not-cease sentient-being compassion arise, light like arise understanding not-cease wisdom five self-light rainbow like appearance pervade, wisdom like arise understanding not-cease not-think state abide, body like arise understanding not-cease peaceful-wrathful light-clear body sky pervade, two not-exist like arise understanding not-cease one and many not-investigate.
Inside the expanse, the youth vase body—essence abides as body, nature as speech, compassion as mind. Life-wind, four limbs, five wisdom winds—essence awareness abides, resonance appears outside. The youth vase body, limitless, not separate—from spontaneous presence resonance, five lights appear, flames arise together. Compassion-awareness resonance form investigates, knowledge arises. Self-face not-knowing—just part from awareness, ignorance is called and abides. The base does not change, yet base-appearances arise, change, become similar. Awareness-appearance is called change. At that time, from the primordially pure appearance like sky without clouds, spontaneous presence arises in eight manners, self-appearance arises. The jewel casket actual-state great appearance. Compassion arises like compassion—not ceasing understanding, sentient being compassion arises. Light arises like light—not ceasing understanding, five wisdoms' self-light rainbow-like pervades. Wisdom arises like wisdom—not ceasing understanding, not-thinking state abides. Body arises like body—not ceasing understanding, peaceful-wrathful light-clear body pervades the sky. Two not-existing arises like—not ceasing understanding, one and many not investigated.
So the base is not a thing. It is the actual state from which all arises—body, speech, mind, light, wisdom, form. Yet it does not change. Like the sky that remains sky whether clouds come or go. The eight manners of spontaneous presence arise from the cloudless sky of primordially pure appearance. Do you see? Do not investigate one and many. Do not grasp at the arising. Let it be as it is.
[11365-11391] Extreme free appearing door not-ceased, spontaneous self-face clear. Pure primordial-wisdom door like appearing door not-ceased—entity primordially-pure appearance sky cloud not. Impure samsara door like appearing door not-ceased—six-classes appearance.
Samsara lower-realms play primordially-arise. Spontaneous appearance capacity—primordial-wisdom five field enjoyment-body appearance. Quality capacity—nature emanation body field appearance. Compassion capacity—sentient-being appearance.
Ground-appearance clear—mirror form-reflection. Self-appear other not-appear, self-appearance not-know dream appearance. Flickering confused scattered. Self-side not-grasped moment instant. Primordially-pure spontaneous appearance.
[11392-11420] Light-clear five thig-le ray-radiance appearance ground early exist. Enjoyment-body appearance, nature emanation-body appearance, six-modes appearance, tame beings emanation-body muni six, impure emanation body birth aging death tame field appearance. Spontaneous arising-way eight arise ground. Being's bag filling, ga'u sound expressed.
Bkra-shis mdzes-ldan—fatigue confusion not, capacity confusion arisen. Ground not-change, nature not-cease arise, compassion not-determinate non-awareness self-arise.
[11392-11420] Listen here, dear practitioner! For example, clouds in the sky truly do not exist—clouds are adventitious, arisen and passing. Likewise, base, path, and awareness do not truly exist as separate things!
Compassion arises, yet non-recognition also arises. The base is called the state of spontaneous accomplishment—attach to this! That also is not determined; great appearance dwells as one. That also possesses the eight aspects of the arising way, called the state of the jewel casket.
The door of desire-objects does not cease—great establishment dwells as non-establishment. The door of compassion's arising does not cease. The enjoyment of primordial-wisdom's arising does not cease. The essence of form's arising does not cease. The view of non-dual arising is not determined. The method of liberation from limits does not cease. The gate of pure primordial-wisdom is thoroughly reached. The compassion of impure arising does not cease.
Desire-objects are like jewels—attach to form like that! The inner youth vase form is called extent-open. The outer state of spontaneous accomplishment dwells as that. At that time, your appearance spreads outward. Not clear, not unclear; not shattered, not unshattered; not scattered, not unscattered; not distracted, not undistracted—moving, flickering, spreading as variety. Then great attachment to spontaneous accomplishment's state!
[11421-11452] That primordial-wisdom's door does not cease—complete cause, enjoyment-appearance way attaches. Quality's door does not cease—nature's emanation form. Compassion's door does not cease—impure appearance.
The great dharma of appearance's limit is not thought, not reached. Light-form clear, spontaneously thick, arranged. Samsara-nirvana's gate of arising is vast. All contained in the great cavity!
Emaho! The great cavity of spontaneous accomplishment contains all!
[11453-11459] *Rin po che spungs pa* tantra: "Kye ma! Teacher Samantabhadra! Ground's appearing mode how? Virtues' appearing door how much? From emptiness how virtues complete mode—tell me!" Then he spoke:
[11460-11477] "From birthless miracle, Buddhas' activity—primordially without division! Not ceasing, also not ceasing! Appearance itself primordially pure! In own face dwelling! From non-dividing great compassion! Spontaneous presence imputation uncertain! Eight appearing modes arisen! That appearance mode not ceasing! From compassion-like appearing mode! All beings' protection place! Appearance self-clear ceaseless from! Five lights' appearing mode appears! Knowing appearance aspect not ceasing! From wisdom pure gate! Appearance ceaseless path-like dawns! Self-appearance body all complete!"
Do you see? Every appearance is compassion's play! Every light is wisdom's face! Stop looking for purity—you're drowning in it! Emaho!
[11505-11546] Emptiness-clear great—what non-existent what-as appear. Arise-method quality non-cease. Spontaneous appear-make non-cease. Various appear nature. Quality plural appear. Appear-make door plural eight. Quality eight method arise.
Outward arise appear-method eight appear-place—base-appear spontaneous gem cavity. Primordial base complete-end. Base self ground two—base spontaneous gem cavity. Complete-end result spontaneous gem secret cavity. Spontaneous cavity three. Base-appear path spontaneous gem cavity. Experience time appear four primordial-wisdom, path-appear all arise. Spontaneous appear-door eight—samsara-nirvana dharmas arise door non-cease.
Body primordial-wisdom own-light manifestly appear—base enjoyment-complete body light-clear pure elements five primordially-arise. Primordial-wisdom warmth fire warm. Compassion gather water cool. Space stable earth light. Five own-display wind move—mandala appear.
[11547-11647] Appearance tone display—nature emanation body field endowment adorn. Tone beings-tame emanation body benefit. Impure emanation body appear spread. Plural above show although, part expand explain, understand easy.
Palgyi-Trashi-Pe—spontaneous gem appear-way arise. Buddha dharma arise base. Buddha arise, beings arise, primordial-wisdom arise, light arise, awareness arise, non-awareness arise, karma arise, compassion arise. Exist like appear, nature exist, nature like appear, compassion like appear, display exist, appear exist, mind exist, intellect exist, delusion exist, non-delusion exist. All arise great. Buddha beings space great. Enjoyment body appear-way arise. Path manifestly appear base.
[11547-11576] Enjoyment body appear-way—clear, warm, cool, light, move self hold. Body five possess, primordial-wisdom five possess, families five, color five, light five, father five, mother five, form five, sound five, smell five, taste five, touch five, dharma five, appear five, chief five, retinue five.
Thirty-two marks good possess, eighty marks good possess, vast dharma six possess.
All these—qualities of your own nature when unobscured. Not far. Not difficult. Just look.
Nature emanation body appear-way—enjoyment non-exhaust, retinue non-exhaust, quality exhaust non-know, power exhaust non-know, display exhaust non-know, miracle exhaust non-know. Life measure number non-existent. Sickness suffering free. Palace mind non-conceive, dharma mind non-conceive teach.
Beings tame emanation body—various appear, various object know. Appear although follow not cut, appear follow not attach. Eye ear nose tongue body mind completely pure possess. Compassion deed various show, primordial-wisdom special possess, knowledge non-cease.
Impure emanation body—thus appear great.
[11577-11647] Three kayas—one nature, three aspects. Don't make them three Buddhas. Don't collapse them into one. See clearly.
COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 279
You who believe in the solidity of the world! Longchenpa tells you at lines [11607-11612] that the outer container is the five elements' mandala formation—earth, water, fire, wind, and the great space element. You walk on the earth and think "this is solid, this is real." You drink water and think "this is wet, this is real." But from what are these grasped? Thought and speech do not perceive their nature. They appear, yes, but their nature is not what you think.
At lines [11613-11626], that-from grasping thought speech not-perceive and, desire and, hatred and, delusion and, pride and, jealousy and, anger and six are. That-from beings types six arisen-are. Jealousy-from human-in form, anger-from god-in form, pride-from god not-in form, desire-from hungry-ghost-in form, delusion-from animal-in form, hatred black-from hell-in form-do. Thus types six appearance-in form-do. That cyclic-existence place-is. You think the six realms are far away, places you might go after death. Foolish! They are right here. When jealousy arises in your mind, you are in the human realm at that moment. When anger burns, you are in the god realm—or when pride towers, you create a god realm without form. Desire makes you a hungry ghost, delusion makes you an animal, hatred deep and black makes you experience hell. The cyclic existence is not a place. It is the place of your own mind's grasping.
At lines [11627-11642], that-also base-mode great one-from appearance-mode four like arisen-are, base-mode four-from appearance-means four like manifest-do, appearance great four are, spontaneous-presence various appearance-do, enjoyment-kaya mouth eye ear having light nature illusion body-as abide-do, emanation-kaya form like appearance-do, sentient-beings appearance-in distinct appearance-do, that-also sentient-beings appearance-means obscuration-do said speak-do. The six realms arise from one great base-mode, in four appearance-modes. From four base-modes, four appearance-means manifest. The four great appearances—spontaneous presence appearing variously, enjoyment kaya with mouth, eye, ear, having light nature, abiding as illusion body, emanation kaya appearing like form, sentient beings appearing distinct. This is called sentient beings' appearance-means obscuration.
At lines [11637-11642], that all gather-if, primordial-purity-from cloud not-having space like appearance under, spontaneous-presence door eight emergence-mode-from primordial-awareness appearance enjoyment-kaya and, that potency-from directly five-families appearance measureless-from, nature emanation-kaya appearance-in, downward six realms pure-lands teacher and having, kayas three appearance three-stacked manifest-do base spontaneous-presence appearance-do. If you gather all this, from primordial purity like space without clouds, from spontaneous presence's eight door emergence-mode, primordial awareness appears as enjoyment kaya. From that potency, directly five families appear measureless. Nature emanation kaya appears in. Downward, six realms, pure lands, teacher—all having. Three kayas' appearance three-stacked manifest—this is base spontaneous presence's appearance.
At lines [11643-11646], self face-to appearance enjoyment-kaya beings-taming nature emanation buddhas all self base-to appearance potency is-but, now direction which-in not-exist that, self-awareness appearance is-therefore self-awareness and together abide-do. Self-face appearance, enjoyment kaya taming beings, nature emanation—all Buddhas are self-base's appearance potency. But now, in which direction does this not exist? Self-awareness appearance—therefore self-awareness together abides. Do you see? The pure lands and the hell realms, the Buddhas and the sentient beings—all are the display of your own base. They do not exist in any direction outside. They are self-awareness appearing to itself.
At lines [11646-11647], self-appearance six-realms appearance also other-in not-exist that impure cyclic-existence door like emergence-mode not-cease-from self-arise-therefore. Self-appearance, six realms appearance—also in other, not exist. That impure cyclic existence door, like emergence-mode not ceasing, therefore self-arises. The six realms are your own appearance. They do not exist in some "other" place. They self-arise from the door of impure cyclic existence that never ceases. But who made it impure? Your own not-recognizing. Your own grasping at self and other.
So look at the world around you. Is it solid? Is it real? Or is it the display of five elements, the play of spontaneous presence, the self-appearance of your own awareness? Do not be fooled by the outer container. Look at what contains it.
PAGE 280 COMMENTARY
Dear practitioner, mark this distinction well! Lines [11648-11667] reveal the crucial difference between self-appearance and deluded-appearance!
Self appears to self—this is the natural display! Common world, common karma, teacher's activity arranged. But look! Self-appearance to self, though it seems like delusion, is actually the door of cyclic existence arranged by wisdom itself!
When the bundle of self-appearance transfers, it falls into common other-face—this is the bardo, the between! Now you exist in the common perception of others!
This distinction is most important! Nature awareness self-arises! Spontaneous presence manifests the six realms! Deluded-appearance, dream-like, primordially pure—this ground-appearance does not exist as self reversed! Send yourself back! This is the point!
In the bardo, self-face appears as emanations to benefit the six realms! But there are two aspects: impure cyclic existence not yet manifest—here self-appearance does not benefit because action and object do not appear! Once manifest from—benefit is needed!
If deluded-appearance is not empty, liberation is impossible! This point is subtle, most important!
The eight qualities generally shown, the fault-qualities divided by conditions—these are proof! Arise-cessation, appearance-mode, proof placed!
Like a mirror reflecting a face—the reflection appears but has no substance! Like a dream at night—you experience but nothing truly happens!
Know the difference between wisdom's display and delusion's trap!
Emaho! The subtle distinction between clarity and confusion!
