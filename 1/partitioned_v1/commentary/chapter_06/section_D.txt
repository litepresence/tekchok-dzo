[12047-12058] Listen well! The great collection is completely complete. Undefined non-awareness dawn is obscuration defeated from primordial time. Know in self-appearance the non-awareness dawn. That dawn—all afflictions dawn. Non-awareness dawn from which arise—for that merely self-abiding quality manifests, becomes body-primordial-wisdom-Buddha.
Roughly said: liberated from first base. Liberated when base-from-base-appearance arises. Liberated in an instant transcending the base. Where liberated? Roughly said: the base is first liberated. Liberated in the spontaneous ground of complete-end!
[12059-12071] If base-first liberated, also return become. From the place where the base's suitable aspect of delusion arises—for samsara-nirvana is the base. Say self-primordial as liberation-place. Query: is base primordial? Although primordial is explained in the nature, first base is non-is. Briefly: when self-face is known, space-quality is complete-end. Say result is liberated from obscuration-free. Therefore, when body-primordial-wisdom etc. quality arise-base abides, say space-quality!
[12072-12086] Indeed exist in awareness—exist! For non-manifest. Say Buddha-quality at complete-end time. The power of non-awareness-dawn-dawn self-in-exist quality appears-expand-for! Or base-spontaneous Buddha-quality. Say accept: result manifest-become accomplish Buddha-quality. Thus Samantabhadra Buddha that also! Dharma six. Transcend from base. Appear in self-face. Divide distinction. Liberate first distinguish. Non-arise from other. Abide in self-place. That plural cause from non-arise result. Buddha from mind non-arise. Buddha from self-arise instruction non-arise scripture. Liberate base-appear result from primordial base!
Emaho! Liberation is primordial!
[12087-12106] Realize by means of wisdom! From the Lamp Blaze Tantra: base self ripens result, does wisdom. Ripens in wisdom body. That nature-self's dharma body. Ripens in primordial-wisdom dharma body. That primordial-wisdom continuum non-cut. Body primordial-wisdom spontaneous clear. Thus!
That time know: object-field appear-arise aspect, self-face realize aspect—all realize Buddha is! From self-face inner-abiding nature state, investigate do—elaboration ceases, all realize Buddha. That also: although all know, self-face nature non-moves. Inner abide know. In outward gaze know aspect. Distinction: aspect appear non-appear. All realize primordial-wisdom. Say: aspect all realize primordial-wisdom. Aspect all realize primordial-wisdom. That two reverse—different nature, one inner abide, all realize is!
[12107-12137] Second: liberate-from space-abide method as-for. Pure spontaneous quality manifest-become, like crystal light gathered inside. Self-face inner-clear youth vase body-as abide. Dharma body pure nature, extreme center, non-existent space, height high, in expanse. In spontaneous depth, clear light five palace arrangement inside. Awareness empty-aspect nature Samantabhadri appear-aspect, dharma body Samantabhadra consort self-clear in. Method-wisdom net self-relate!
Wisdom life become horse—know object all, know do complete fast! Light clear five, inner-tone non-mix, equal nature expanse vast. That self-set non-sun, secret sun, space in arise. That time space elements five, self-place arrange, appear light, self-tone clear.
[12138-12153] Depth-clear tone ceases not. Wisdom light-five, in expanse gather-heap-as coil. Entity sign-like not-established, empty. Not-being cut-short-as, not-gone, appearance-beautiful. Essence-nature-compassion three, knot-one-as twist. Awareness light mansion possess. Light end-not-possess, appearance spontaneous-dense. Complete-liberation wisdom boundless, victory-banner peak ten-powers. Fearlessness four. Individual-knowing. Marks. Characteristics etc.—always not-cease nature. Light-ray boundless lamp-as clear. Wisdom self-appearance increase-decrease not-possess. Great-compassion benefit intend—path other-to not-go, self-purpose clear. Body-five stupa, wisdom-five tier with-together. Expense reality seat not-move. Means in-skill, great-compassion thousand-path, direction end-reach emit-all. Buddha sentient-being all teacher-as supreme foremost, early front dwell. That also from self-arisen!
Emaho! All realize Buddha!
[12154-12204] Kye! Noble-man, speech-lion, you listen! Jewel various-arrange mass height! Jewel palace arrange-beautiful! Jewel various-decorate queen ornament-beautiful! Jewel various-arrange net even! Jewel beautiful horse speed! Jewel various storehouse exhaust not-possess! Jewel five-colors field all-even! Jewel secret sun rise-set not-possess!

[12205-12215] That in commentary. Thus very wonder arise, think not-possess object Buddha that! Other from not-hear, self self teacher not-possess, self-arisen wisdom, inexpressible nature-as completely-perfect Buddha! That after realization, realization not-possess blind become, other also realize for. That realize path show for. Supreme wisdom. Compassion possess that-as know should said. Thus teacher all before early awaken. Time-three Buddha. Realm-three sentient-being all benefit do to. First last not-possess dwell sovereignty perfect teacher Samantabhadra called!

COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 292
You who seek metaphors to understand! Longchenpa offers you jewels at lines [12154-12163]: Jewel empty mandala draw-beautiful, jewel end border-knot three are coiled beautiful, jewel deep darkness dispel wide in naturally profound, jewel ocean peak upon setting none, jewel lamp burning is light clear, jewel secret pristine-awareness in increase-decrease none, jewel variously spreading path upon traverse none, jewel body-stupa burning stupa is stacked beautiful, jewel vajra seat upon change none, jewel empty path upon meeting none. Ten jewels he gives you. But do you understand? The empty mandala drawn beautiful—this is your own mind, empty yet appearing. The border-knot three coiled beautiful—essence, nature, compassion, inseparable. Deep darkness dispelled, naturally profound—your own awareness, wide, clear. Ocean peak—no setting, no rising. Lamp burning—light clear, needing no fuel. Secret pristine awareness—no increase, no decrease. Variously spreading path—none to traverse. Body-stupa burning, stacked beautiful—your form is the stupa, the enlightenment monument. Vajra seat—no change. Empty path—no meeting, no parting.
At lines [12164-12173], mind-intent self-abiding quintessential-instruction as shown thus. These all drop-circle secret-cycle in. Earth jewel kind-five stupa what stacked beautiful says etcetera with consistent. Third that from other benefit doing is. Sphere primordially-pure great dharmakaya field that from unmoving while, spontaneous from-door beings appearance-mode with accord benefit doing, spontaneous light body power from sambhogakaya appearance arranged having, that from Brahma-great aeon arranged, nature nirmanakaya appearance and, impure samsara from-door beings appearance with consistent teacher beings realm pervading shown samsara emptied doing. Mind-intent self-abiding—this is the quintessential instruction shown. These all in the drop-circle, secret-cycle. Earth jewel kind-five stupa stacked beautiful—says etcetera, consistent. Third, from that, other-benefit doing. Sphere primordially pure great dharmakaya field—from that unmoving, while spontaneous from-door beings' appearance-mode, accord benefit doing. Spontaneous light body power—from sambhogakaya appearance arranged having. From that Brahma-great aeon arranged. Nature nirmanakaya appearance. Impure samsara from-door beings' appearance, consistent—teacher beings realm pervading shown, samsara emptied doing.
At lines [12174-12192], these all common vehicles in also appear. Uttaratantra from: Compounded-not and spontaneously accomplished, other condition realized not and, knowing and compassion and power possessing, benefit-two possessing buddha nature, beginning middle end none of, nature being reason compounded-not, peaceful dharmakaya possessing reason, spontaneously accomplished called expressed, self self realize for-reason, other condition realize not, thus manner three realize for-reason knowing, path show for-reason mind compassionate, power pristine-awareness compassion, suffering afflictions dispel for-reason, first three self-benefit, later three other-benefit is, says and. These all appear in common vehicles too. From the Uttaratantra: Not compounded and spontaneously accomplished. Other condition, realized not. Knowing, compassion, power possessing. Benefit-two possessing Buddha nature. Beginning, middle, end none. Nature being reason—not compounded. Peaceful dharmakaya possessing reason. Spontaneously accomplished called, expressed. Self self realize—for reason. Other condition realize not. Thus manner three realize—for reason knowing. Path show—for reason mind compassionate. Power pristine-awareness compassion. Suffering afflictions dispel—for reason. First three self-benefit. Later three other-benefit. Says and.
So you see? The Buddha nature is not something you must create. It is not compounded. It is spontaneously accomplished. It possesses knowing, compassion, power. It has the two benefits—self and other. It has no beginning, middle, or end. It is the peaceful dharmakaya. And why does the compassionate mind show the path? Why does pristine awareness use power and compassion to dispel suffering? For reason. For the reason of benefiting self and other.
The jewels are your own nature. The stupa is your body. The path is untraversable because you are already there. Do not look for the mandala outside. Do not look for the jewel in another's pocket. Everything Longchenpa describes is your own mind, your own awareness, your own spontaneously present nature. Recognize this, and you are the wealthiest being in all existence.
[12217-12231] Mind delusion manner-as appear. Cause condition together moment. Said and. From Vajrasattva Heart Mirror Tantra: realm-three sentient-being this all. Basis what-also not-possess from what-also delude? Basis that essence empty! Nature clear! Compassion sentient-being appear capacity possess!
That grasp-maker consciousness, ignorance part arise, fracture one shift from. Consciousness dark that from I arise, or I from that arise think—consciousness arise only delude! Ignorance that basis not-possess experience-or appearance exist.
[12232-12246] Appearance condition, appearance four arise. That also basis light house manner-as dwell from, cause condition called. Ignorance actual. That investigate go, master condition called. That subject-as grasp, object condition called. Example: mirror man face show like. That three time equal, immediate condition called. That self basis, self face not-know delude, realm-three samsara establish. That affliction coarse go, sentient-being form different arise. Basis thus delude said. That basis appear investigate-maker consciousness arise time: cause identity one ignorance, self face not-know part from. Condition four object not-pure delude. Manner that Fortune-Beauty from.
[12247-12256] That condition basis delude. End condition four touch. Cause object-possessor-as grasp condition from. Result various cause-as delude. Master subject-as grasp condition from name various-as delude. Object mind-possessor-as grasp condition from result touch not-possess-as delude. Immediate grasp-possessor condition from appearance various-as delude.
Emaho! Delusion from basis appear, yet basis never deluded!
PAGE 294 COMMENTARY
Look here, seeker of truth! Lines [12227-12246] trace the arising of delusion from pure ground!
Compassion possesses capacity to appear to sentient beings! But grasped by grasping-consciousness, ignorance fractures! Shift from one to the other! From that dark consciousness, "I" arises! Or "I" arises from that!
Thinking thus, consciousness arises only! Deluded! Ignorance—that basis possesses neither experience nor appearance! Appearance from conditions—four appearances arise!
Like a man shown his face in a mirror! Three times equal—immediate condition! From this basis, self by self-face not knowing, deluded! Three realms' samsara established!
From this, affliction coarse—sentient beings arise in different forms! Basis thus deluded! When consciousness arises to investigate basis-appearance, cause-identity one-by-means-of ignorance! Self-face not knowing! Condition four-by-means-of object not-pure!
Deluded! Manner that Fortune-Beauty from! Condition basis-by-means-of deluded!
Like a clear sky suddenly covered with clouds—was the sky ever truly obscured? Like pure water stirred to mud—was the water ever truly dirty?
The basis remains pure! The delusion is adventitious! Remove the cause and the effect vanishes!
Do not chase the delusion—find its root! Cut the root and the tree falls! The root is ignorance—the not-knowing of one's own face!
Emaho! The root of all confusion!
