[11682-11686] Listen! The tamer and what tames—both are your own mind playing. Secret Essence itself is great compassion. Six realms appear yet don't abide. Like clouds in sky—there, but never staying.
[11687-11690] Look! Light and sound awareness-base appear, yet the five elements have no separate existence. If you say they don't exist, awareness is not cut off inside. If you say the container-contents don't arise—you miss the point entirely.
[11691-11694] Three doors of body, speech, mind—three kayas of Buddha gather. No separation! Body appearing like body yet not existing as body—this is the nature. Do you see?
[11695-11698] Primordial wisdom appears yet is non-existent. If you claim transcendence from samsara joins path-wisdom, you fall into defect. Extremes liberated—appear yet Buddha doesn't return. Non-arising itself is the quality.
[11699-11702] Impure door appears—yet spontaneous arising doesn't exist there. Beings appear in samsara but awareness-face doesn't come for a purpose. Six realms individually appear—that's the nature.
[11703-11710] Great power from the base! Even playing in samsara's bad realms is primordial arising. Pure primordial-wisdom door non-existent—nirvana's appearance has no coming. Spontaneous eight appear-methods, eight qualities—suitable to count, suitable to see.
[11711-11721] Eight doors of appearance-making—eight qualities arise as method. Six families escape the cave of self-cut. Samsara's swing-rope cut by those who grasp compassion's lasso. Birth, form, great compassion self-appearing—two aspects mixed as method. Cut samsara-nirvana's troop by realizing non-existence!
[11722-11732] Only this quality-arise-method. All Buddhas in own-field—body and shadow. Five lights pervade inside. Self-clear as appear-aspect. From five lights' method, door of appearance—quality clear-make, outward not-lose. Union appear-make for relating. Self-appear quality great arises.
[11733-11744] All bodies roll to one. Three bodies abide by one means. Nature body's nature inside—self-appear non-distinguished. Nature clear-make body five arises. Non-existent nature not-found-by-means-of. All bodies complete body like appears. All different? No! Non-existent equal-as abide.
[11745-11761] Distinguish non-existent two-in non-existent of. Outside, inside—all pervade-make great method arises. Self-face different—samsara-nirvana mix juncture non-attain. Self-place self from non-liberate. Reverse non-existent defect becomes. Quality arise-method non-ceases.
[11762-11772] Samsara produce arise-source—impure appear-door like. Arise-method cease non-existent as arises. Delusion name non-existent. Therefore impure samsara's door—existence plural's cause peg. Appear cease-non-existent method arises.
[11773-11781] Impure samsara's door say show. Leap primordial-wisdom exist-by-means-of. Pure self pure show. This quality gem. Thus quality aspect complete. Pure primordial-wisdom self's door—nature in self-dissolve. Body and primordial-wisdom nirvana.
COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 283
You who struggle with conditions! Longchenpa speaks at lines [11782-11788] of the emergence of appearance, individual path, pure primordial-awareness great door, direct manner three-as manifest. This not-exist self-potency not-complete-therefore. You think something is missing. You think if only you had better conditions, more time, less distraction, then you could practice. Foolish! The pure primordial awareness great door is always manifest. The three kayas are directly present. If you do not see this, it is not because conditions are bad. It is because your own potency is not recognized as complete.
At lines [11789-11801], second condition-by fault quality part divide-do is. Camphor that fever-to quality-as appearance-in, cold-to fault-as manifest-although, camphor essence-to fault and quality not-establish like. Base and base-appearance emergence-mode that-also self face know those-to liberation-condition-as appearance-therefore quality like manifest-in. Not-know-if part-only delusion base make-do fault like appearance-although. Base and that appearance fault quality-as establish not-exist. Condition divides fault and quality. But look at camphor—it appears as quality to fever, as fault to cold. Yet in the essence of camphor, neither fault nor quality is established. So too with the base and base-appearance emergence-mode. If you know your own face, it appears as liberation-condition, quality-like. If you do not know, only part-delusion, making the base into fault-like appearance. But base and appearance—fault and quality are not established in them. Fault itself quality-as manifests. Condition is a bad helper—fault self-pure liberates. Spontaneous presence potency appearance essence-from primordial-awareness like manifests.
At lines [11802-11817], delusion enter-mode like-in afflictions-by fault mode-as delude-in, spontaneous-presence instant desire delusion reverse potency-from, self as-it-is self-place-as appearance-therefore fault quality-as become-therefore, obstacle attainment-as become-therefore, middle cut-do demon and afflictions not-find-therefore, quality-also not-observed primordial-awareness four gathering direct manifest, spontaneous-presence appearance-mode part-from nondual-as manifest-in, delusion enter-mode like-in self other two-as become-in, delusion reverse-mode like-in self other two-as not-divide-by, not-modify-by self-place-as place-therefore, selfless emptiness quality-as establish-therefore fault seek-in not-find-therefore, cyclic-existence transcendence two nondual-as buddha. In delusion's enter-mode, afflictions delude by fault-mode. But spontaneous presence—instant desire, delusion's reverse potency—self as-it-is appears in self-place, therefore fault becomes quality, obstacle becomes attainment. Middle cut—demons and afflictions not found. Quality also not observed—primordial awareness four gatherings directly manifest. From spontaneous presence appearance-mode, nondual manifests. In delusion enter-mode, self and other become two. In delusion reverse-mode, self and other not divided by—not modifying, self-place as place. Selfless emptiness quality established—fault sought, not found. Cyclic existence and transcendence, two, nondual—as Buddha.
At lines [11813-11818], again spontaneous-presence appearance-mode-from extreme liberation like manifest-in, cyclic-existence enter-mode like-in thought collection fault-as downward delude-therefore, delusion reverse-mode like-in extreme two middle-as become-therefore extreme delusion self-liberate-therefore delusion primordial-awareness-as manifest-from buddha, again spontaneous-presence quality part-from pure primordial-awareness door become-in. Again from spontaneous presence appearance-mode, extreme liberation manifests. In cyclic existence enter-mode, thought collection fault-as downward deludes. In delusion reverse-mode, extreme two become middle—extreme delusion self-liberates, delusion manifests as primordial awareness, from Buddha. Again from spontaneous presence quality part, pure primordial awareness door becomes.
So do not blame your conditions. Do not say "I cannot practice because..." The camphor does not change. The fault and quality are your own projection. Know your own face, and the same condition becomes liberation. The same delusion becomes wisdom. The same appearance becomes the display of primordial awareness. This is the great secret. This is why Longchenpa is the treasure-revealer of your own mind.
[11819-11821] Samsara enter-method like if impure delusion-as appear. Delusion reverse-method like if primordially pure display complete liberate-from Buddha. Spontaneous appear-method aspect from impure samsara's door arises.
[11822-11826] Samsara method in two—this like down in delusion. Bardo last spontaneous gem establish pure confidence non-arise. Existence's bardo-in delusion. Delusion reverse-method like if non-distracted place pure liberate-from Buddha. Nature pure elaboration-free.
[11827-11836] Nature spontaneous quality complete-method arises. Base non-realize plural defect spontaneous arises. That plural actual base six one-one top sense sharp liberate although existence non-cease. Liberate-method six's top liberate door and seven. From-above delusion reverse non-know sequence six like sequence delude.
[11837-11853] Impure door say. Delusion coarse go from. Miracle-born light egg birth body complete. Gradual bardo liberate stable attain wisdom's display complete liberate-method seven establish. There realize non-arise habit time short sense low. There ground non-attain existence's bardo arise. Next appear reach. Therefore delusion-base liberation-base two both spontaneous door reach well realize.
[11840-11853] Bardo. Life this diligent person experience take time. Base heart abide inner-tone base-appear aspect light-root outside sky appear impure samsara's door nature manifest time mainly appear. Light-appear. Outside earth stone inside thought-collections sense arise. Primordial-wisdom door experience take time appear know experience plural. Light like arise experience upward-increase appear. Body like arise awareness measure arrive. Nature exhaust time two non-existent extreme liberate like arise. Compassion like arise all time inside wisdom compassion arise plural. That plural complete outside base-appear nature dissolve mother-base first liberate. Bardo first base pure appear-as arise-from.

You who seek liberation somewhere else! Longchenpa speaks at lines [11854-11861] of base-appearance part light clarity-to manifest-therefore, spontaneous-presence appearance-from kaya like manifest-do bundle-is, primordial-awareness and light like manifest-do four gather-do, spontaneous-presence precious appearance-to pure primordial-awareness and, impure cyclic-existence door two are. Self face know-if compassion and, nondual and, extreme liberation like manifest-therefore, potency base-to dissolve-therefore liberate-do. You think liberation is a place you will reach, a state you will achieve. Foolish! The base-appearance manifests as light clarity. From spontaneous presence appearance, the kayas manifest like a bundle. Primordial awareness and light manifest, four gatherings gather. Spontaneous presence's precious appearance—to pure primordial awareness. Impure cyclic existence door—two. If you know your own face, compassion and nonduality, extreme liberation manifests. Potency dissolves into base, liberates.
At lines [11862-11873], thus base-to base-appearance exist-therefore practice time and, bardo and, first sentient-beings-as delude time which is-any emergence-mode eight appearance arise-do point that is. Buddhas and sentient-beings-also appearance self face know not-know only-are. Cyclic-existence transcendence awareness cause one hand palm back like. Now appearance this-also impure door-to appearance illusion example eight only-from. Outer inner object not-exist base free equal vast open one-from, abandon not-need, accept not-need appearance other manifest time trace not-exist self-reverse great, sleep wake-from dream reverse like. Base liberation-to self-reverse-therefore primordial-empty one-to go-therefore point one well realize-from effort not boundless liberation-to go-do is. Base and base-appearance exist—therefore practice time, bardo, first sentient beings deluded time—whatever emergence-mode, eight appearances arise. This is the point. Buddhas and sentient beings—appearance, self-face know or not-know, only these. Cyclic existence and transcendence—awareness cause one, like the back of your hand. Now this appearance also—impure door appearance, illusion example, eight only. Outer inner object not exist—base free, equal, vast, open, one. Abandon not needed. Accept not needed. Appearance, other manifest time, trace not exist—self-reverse great. Like waking from sleep, dream reverses. Base liberation self-reverses—primordial-empty one goes. Point one well realized—from effort not, boundless liberation goes.
At lines [11874-11882], third first base-to dissolve-mode show-do is. Thus base-from manifest-do appearance great those self face know-or not-know although suitable-therefore, crystal light inside-to dissolve-or, dream later manifest time earlier cease like interval-by go-therefore, appearance any not-exist-as go-do is, primordial-resonance inside-to reverse-from, other-to go-do not-exist that, dream two state-in dissolve-from other-to not-go like, especially wake time dream manifest-do know inside-to dissolve-from other where-also not-go like. Third, first base-to dissolve-mode shows. Thus from base manifest appearance great—self-face know or not-know, although suitable. Crystal light dissolves inside—or dream, later manifest time, earlier ceases, like interval goes. Appearance any not exist as goes. Primordial resonance inside reverses from. Other-to go does not exist. Dream, in two states, dissolves from—not going to other. Especially wake time, dream manifest-do know, inside dissolves from—other where-also not-go like.
At lines [11883-11895], dissolve manner how think-if. Precious heap tantra-from: Alas speech vajra listen. That all fault quality emergence-mode. Awareness itself quality or. Play potency-as dissolve-mode eight. Spontaneous-presence certainty not-exist base. Quality manner this like. Compassion sun compassion-to. Self essence self dissolve-therefore. Not-place obtain-do mode-by-means-of. Action not-exist expanse-to go. Not-action any not-is-therefore. How to think of dissolve manner? From the Precious Heap Tantra: Alas, speech vajra, listen! That all fault quality emergence-mode. Awareness itself quality. Or play potency-as dissolve-mode eight. Spontaneous presence certainty not exist base. Quality manner like this. Compassion sun to compassion. Self essence self dissolves. Not-place obtain-do mode. Action not exist—expanse goes. Not-action any not is—therefore.
So liberation is not going somewhere else. It is the self-dissolving of the base-appearance into the base itself. Like a dream that ceases when you wake—not going anywhere, just ceasing to appear as separate. The crystal light dissolves into itself. The sun's rays dissolve into the sun. You do not need to go to the expanse. You are the expanse. Action does not exist. Not-action also does not exist. Just this. Just this.
COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 286
You who still think there is something to do! Longchenpa declares at lines [11896-11900]: Action conduct all nirvana, not-done action-do appearance not-exist-therefore, conditioned all pure expanse, that itself self-to self dissolve-therefore, other-to go-do not-is. You think you must perform actions, follow conduct, accumulate merit. You think nirvana is the result of doing something right. Foolish! All action and conduct—already nirvana. Why? Because action that is done, appearance does not exist. Conditioned—all pure expanse. It itself dissolves self-to-self. There is no going to other.
At lines [11901-11920], example-for sun heart-to, self rays all self dissolve like, self resonance and having-by-means-of, mirror appearance all nirvana, this all quality precious, fault-in not-abide self ground-is, self light self-to dissolve-therefore, this-also quality great-as manifest, self essence completely-pure-as, sign grasp-do attachment object cease, outer four-elements coarse-as although, here not-appear-therefore attachment reverse, self pure emptiness great-from, color self-grasp nirvana, this-also other-to go-do not-exist, self essence-as self dissolve-therefore, appearance all nirvana, light mandala self dissolve-therefore, example-for sky rainbow itself, sky itself-to self dissolve like, not-divide great expanse-in, grasping-attachment all nirvana, this-also quality precious. Example: sun to heart—self rays all self dissolve. Self resonance having by means of. Mirror appearance—all nirvana. This all quality precious. Fault not abiding—self ground. Self light self dissolves. This also quality great manifests. Self essence completely pure. Sign grasping, attachment object ceases. Outer four elements coarse, although here not appear—therefore attachment reverses. Self pure emptiness great—from color self-grasp nirvana. This also other-to go not exist. Self essence self dissolves. Appearance all nirvana. Light mandala self dissolves. Example: sky rainbow itself—sky itself self dissolves. Not divide great expanse in. Grasping-attachment all nirvana. This also quality precious.
At lines [11921-11944], quality emergence-mode this like, primordial-awareness itself-to primordial-awareness itself, self essence-as self dissolve-therefore, awareness grasping-thought recollection thought, self-abide equality expanse-to, all nondual nirvana, individual primordial-awareness appearance part-also, made not-exist expanse center-to, set not-exist-as nirvana, that itself self-to self dissolve-therefore, primordial-awareness play various all, self face mother-to dissolve-do is, example-for mother lap child enter like, self primordial-awareness self confident, self nature nirvana, this-also quality precious. Quality emergence-mode like this. Primordial awareness to primordial awareness itself. Self essence self dissolves. Awareness, grasping thought, recollection thought—self-abide equality expanse. All nondual nirvana. Individual primordial awareness appearance part—also made not exist, expanse center. Set not exist as nirvana. That itself self-to self dissolves. Primordial awareness play various all—self face mother dissolves. Example: mother's lap, child enters. Self primordial awareness self confident. Self nature nirvana. This also quality precious.
At lines [11940-11956], again quality dissolve-do mode, kaya itself kaya-to self dissolve-therefore, form all not-thought great-in, appearance not-exist-as nirvana, coarse-by gather-do elements and, subtle-by grasp-do ignorance etc, action-do not-exist-as nirvana, kayas self face-to dissolve-therefore, awareness arise part outward not-fall, example-for vase body form like, inner clear outer move all, nature fire place-as pure. Again quality dissolve-mode. Kaya itself kaya self dissolves. Form all not-thought great in. Appearance not exist as nirvana. Coarse gather elements and, subtle grasp ignorance etc. Action-do not exist as nirvana. Kayas self face dissolve. Awareness arise part outward not fall. Example: vase body form like. Inner clear, outer move all. Nature fire place pure.
So look at the sun. Its rays do not go anywhere else. They dissolve into the sun itself. Look at the mirror. Its appearances do not go anywhere. They are already nirvana. Look at the rainbow in the sky. It does not go somewhere else when it fades. It dissolves into the sky itself. Look at the child entering the mother's lap. It does not travel far. It returns to the source. Your own primordial awareness—confident, self-nature nirvana. The kayas dissolve into themselves. Form is not-thought in the great. Appearance is nirvana without existing as appearance. Action does not exist as nirvana. Everything self-dissolves, self-pure, self-complete. What is left for you to do? Only recognize. Only rest. Only be confident in your own nature.
[11952-11963] This also quality gem. Again quality this-like. Two-non-existent two-non-existent self-dissolve. Number hold attachment plural. Single-one elaboration-free as-for. Non-two one method as also. Self-dissolve self-in nirvana. Two-in appear self self-dissolve. Example river river in. Dissolve like distinguish non-divide. Distinguish non-existent great-in nirvana.
[11964-11974] This also quality gem. Non-cease quality this-like. Extreme liberate self extreme liberate in. Self's nature self-dissolve. Body speech hold self-continuum all. Body plural exhaust nirvana. Extreme self pure self-dissolve. Example space space in. Dissolve like identify non-existent. Extreme four thought-attachment self-cease-from. Non-abide great-in nirvana.
[11975-11982] This also quality gem. Appear's quality this-like. Impure samsara-in self-enter door. Nature self's pure door in. Go non-existent method as dissolve. Example tent draw-string plural. Draw center self-gather like. Sense object nirvana.
[11983-11994] Thus quality aspect complete. Pure primordial-wisdom self's door. Nature in self-dissolve. Body primordial-wisdom nirvana. Example lion snow conquer like. Non-turn fear non-existent confidence plural find. This also quality gem. Thus quality arise-method-of. One-as abide primordial-wisdom place. Non-seek self self-find. Before-from that's nature. Thus.
[11995-12000] Method this Secret-Essence difficult point. Tantra instruction clear speak although. Tibet here before capable ask merely non-arise. I very clear separate-from show. Afterwards point this know arise if letter this's end know. Second Samantabhadra's liberate-method in three.
PAGE 288 COMMENTARY
Listen sharply, fortunate one! Lines [12001-12020] reveal the instant liberation—the path of no path!
Base appears—see it and instantly liberate! Liberate and abide in space! From this, benefit others! This is the method!
How? From primordial space, inner tone outward arises! Compassion-awareness, self-non-awareness aspect, merely arises! That base-appear outward looks! Self-appear self-is-know—inward realize, and instantly!
Non-awareness self-pure! Base-appear spontaneous appears! Self-dissolve pure! Ground self-place abides!
Instant in Buddha! Before coming teacher! Resultant-reversal! Samsara-nirvana primordial final! Buddha does not become through delusion!
Base transcended sense! Self-appear nature non-existent! Know this! Thought-investigate mind plural—outward not lose! Move self-rope decide!
Like a bird freed from a cage—no need to learn flying! Like ice melting into water—no need to destroy the ice!
The instant you see, you are liberated! Not gradually, not through stages, not through effort! Simply see the nature of what appears!
Do not look for buddha outside! Do not wait for realization in the future! It is here, now, in this very instant!
Like lightning flashing—if you blink, you miss it! Like an echo in the valley—hear it now or it is gone!
Emaho! The instant that contains all time!
Roughly said: liberated from first base. Liberated when base-from-base-appearance arises. Liberated in an instant transcending the base. Where liberated? Roughly said: the base is first liberated. Liberated in the spontaneous ground of complete-end!
Emaho! Liberation is primordial!
