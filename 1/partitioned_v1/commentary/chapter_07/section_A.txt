COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 297
You who fear the wheel of existence! Longchenpa speaks at lines [12331-12338] of dependent origination—object from utilize is touch, that from joy sorrow middle three arise is feeling, that from bliss to attached and suffering not-desiring knowing is craving, that from object accept grasping is grasping, that from karma and afflictions spread future birth in propel karma accomplish is becoming, that from realms various in birth is birth, that from mature and aged and die is aging-dying. That also beginning from ego up-to wheel twelve delusion. You know this wheel. You have been told about the twelve links since you first came to the Dharma. Touch, feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, aging and death. You think this is something that happens to you, something you must escape. But look—Longchenpa says this is delusion, from beginning ego up to the wheel twelve.
At lines [12339-12347], life one even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first self face not-know is ignorance. Outer breath cut time die by. That interval dependent-origination manner enters. Then coarse subtle dissolving manner channels transfer stages dependent-origination reverse. Deluded-appearance empty from samsara turn when. Nirvana self-arisen manner first primordially-pure appearance arise from. Dharmata bardo appearances are nirvana dependent-origination manifest appearance. There self face not-know if also wander. Know if liberate samsara nirvana-samsara liberate called. Life one—even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first, self-face not-know is ignorance. Outer breath cut—time die by. That interval, dependent origination manner enters. Then coarse subtle dissolving, channels transfer stages—dependent origination reverses. Deluded-appearance empty from, samsara turns. When? Nirvana self-arisen manner—first primordially pure appearance arises. Dharmata bardo appearances are nirvana dependent-origination manifest appearance. There, self-face not-know—if also wander. Know—if liberate. Samsara nirvana-samsara liberate called.
At lines [12348-12358], that-also base and base-appearance, both to ignorance none although, cloud like adventitiously arise condition made, impure samsara like appear doorway cause made, realms three kinds six variously deluded. Pearl garland from: Thus abiding dharmata to, delusion from-start none is, dharmakaya sky like to, adventitiously beings clouds obscured, says and. That also base and base-appearance—both to ignorance none, although. Cloud-like, adventitiously arise, condition made. Impure samsara-like appear, doorway cause made. Realms three, kinds six, variously deluded. From the Pearl Garland: Thus abiding dharmata to, delusion from start none is. Dharmakaya sky-like to, adventitiously beings clouds obscured. Says and.
At lines [12359-12371], base-appearance great that itself from, ignorance called labeled none, delusion accomplished exist not, says. Adventitiously force labeled impure samsara dharma arise is. That itself from, thus world three itself, aggregates five and faculties five, limbs five and essences five, objects five and afflictions five, minds five mentals five thoughts five, grasped-grasper samsara accomplished, says and. Base-appearance great—that itself from, ignorance called, labeled none. Delusion accomplished—exist not. Says. Adventitiously force labeled, impure samsara dharma arises. That itself from—thus world three itself. Aggregates five, faculties five, limbs five, essences five, objects five, afflictions five, minds five, mentals five, thoughts five. Grasped-grasper samsara accomplished. Says and.
So you see? The wheel of dependent origination is not ultimate truth. It is the deluded appearance. When you die, when the breath is cut, you enter the interval—the bardo. There, dependent origination can reverse. The coarse and subtle dissolve. The channels transfer. And from deluded-appearance empty, samsara turns. How? Nirvana self-arisen—primordially pure appearance arises first. The dharmata bardo appearances are nirvana's dependent origination manifest. If you do not know your own face there, you wander. If you know, you liberate. It is called liberation from samsara-nirvana-samsara.
But understand—the base and base-appearance, both have no ignorance. They are cloud-like, adventitious, condition-made. The impure samsara appears like a doorway, cause-made. But delusion from the start? None. The dharmakaya is like the sky. Beings, like clouds, obscure it adventitiously. The base-appearance itself—ignorance is just a label. Delusion is not accomplished. It does not exist. All these—worlds, aggregates, faculties, limbs, essences, objects, afflictions, minds, mentals, thoughts—grasped and grasper, they accomplish samsara. But they are like clouds. The sky remains pure.
So do not fear the twelve links. Do not fear death. In the bardo, the dharmata appears. Know your own face, and you are liberated. Do not know, and you wander. But even wandering is not other than the display of your own base. The clouds are not other than the sky. The waves are not other than the ocean. Rest in that recognition, and the wheel turns itself to liberation.
[12453-12467] Listen! Thus cyclic existence name arises. Inconceivable forms beings arise. Delusion's path thought conceived arise thus said. Therein Vajrasattva Rigpa Awareness Itself. Broad Expanse field display—Primordial Four. Beautiful Abode gateway basis-appearances spontaneously arise!
Time dissolves self non-recognition—other deluded basis-display. Year Pig time ignorance fully conceptualized. Emanated Sun clear thought-grasping coarse appearances. Star Bird attachment objects arisen desire. Elder Crone non-recognition consciousness deluded grasping. Indeterminate lineage basis-appearance wherever arising liberating—common ground delusion liberation.
[12468-12483] Four companions: Four conditions. Five wild men: Five poisons. One back-support: conceptualizing mind. One thief: anger. One accumulating: all delusion-appearance established one. That mind grasps delusion-appearance. That many afflictions arise—hosts armies!
Delusion primordial purity without samsara-basis incompleteness arisen. Second practice lineage indicates delusion liberation—two revealed. Again self-arisen HO! Listen pure ones expanse! Buddha intention—measure all grasped. Before Broad Expanse Teacher Light-Spread existed. Two sons imprisoned empty cave—symbolic narrative. Five soldiers stone fortress destroyed—symbolic narrative. Two sons sent hole.
[12484-12500] Elder Crone closed door—symbolic narrative. Four men chasing caught. Five men separated horses—symbolic narrative. Two sons losing guard killed—symbolic narrative. Two sons fled Rain-Sun gathered taxes subjects twenty-one queens counseled fled Samrudra temple five men armor guarding door none enter—symbolic narrative. Then four mirrors looked self self-face known—symbolic narrative. House eight doors seen self laughed self—symbolic narrative. Thus symbols appearances all indicate—wisdom meaning applied thus said.
Teacher Light-Spread self-arising wisdom. Two sons awareness pure spontaneous wisdom two. Imprisoned cave spontaneous appearance wisdom mother-son mixed non-recognition bound samsara. Five men stone fortress peak five poisons moving awareness self-abode delusion caused.
Emaho! Symbols indicate wisdom meaning!
[12418-12422] Wish-fulfilling tree expanding—called thus! Buddha-youth vase-body's blessing arisen tree, egg-arisen heat and moisture-born one exists—from that mind self-arisen wisdom called, moving, tireless world arises! This is confusion-object's ignorance!
[12423-12432] Confusion-basis basis-ignorance—confusion-basis self-by-self impure arisen, first cause-condition called, ignorance actual arisen, basis-not-known ignorance! From that observed-condition called, confusion-object's ignorance like! From that controller-condition tree self-grasping arisen! From that similar immediate-condition called, awareness coarse became, grasping grasped! From that afflictions coarse became! This is confusion-basis basis-ignorance!
[12433-12447] Grasping-conception ignorance—from that afflictions' assembly immeasurable arisen! Also thus: grasping mind six arisen! Ignorance-similar mind, mind's consciousness mind, all-searching mind, certainty-establishing mind, coarse mind, definite-placing mind! Also thus: ignorance-similar-possessed mind is thus: root ignorance actual, mind's movement with!
Do you see? From one not-knowing, all this mess! Cut the root and the tree falls! Emaho!
