Emptiness isn't nothing. Emptiness is the clearing that allows everything to appear. Essence-impurity separating—this is what emptiness does. It doesn't destroy. It refines. It takes the confusion and shows you what's actually there.
While this clearing happens: trembling, coiling, gapping, bliss, suffering, equanimity. All arising simultaneously. You're not supposed to escape the trembling. The trembling is the clarity moving through the channels. The coiling is the wisdom wrapping around itself. The gaps? That's the spaciousness between thoughts. Between breaths. Between one universe and the next.
At the center of the channel-wheel, syllable self-sound stirs. Light's tone awakens. Varied white-red light-wheels begin spinning. This is not happening to someone else. This is happening in your body right now. The five sense-powers grasping through their channels. The five sense-doors emitting syllable-lights like sparks from a fire.
Here's where you might get excited: varied bliss-suffering branched blazing becomes. The pleasure and the pain both light up. Both are expressions of the same luminosity. You don't reject one and embrace the other. They're both the channels doing their job.
But listen carefully—this wisdom-nature isn't yet path. It hasn't become practice. It hasn't become anything you can claim as accomplishment. It's more like sesame oil pervading everything. Or sun-rays sparking through clouds. Present but not yet integrated. The basis is there but you haven't recognized it.
The Peak-Arranged Wheel forms at the head. Channel-enumeration, syllable-connection, all arranged like a mandala. Eighty-five thousand wind-insects powering the whole system. Syllable-stirring, wind-moving, food-nourishing. The body starts moving. The insects develop clear consciousness. Each one awakening.
Previous insects also thus. Every moment, another wave of recognition attempting to arise.
You think you need to meditate to make this happen? It's already happening. The meditation is just noticing.
Rest in the noticing. The rest takes care of itself.

The system is complete. Now comes the multiplication.
Emptying, contracting, stabbing, coiling—the body elements never stop moving. Wind, bile, phlegm, combined diseases all taking their turns. Bliss and suffering ripening together. The inventory branches: sixteen divisions become thirty-two, then multiply into four hundred four common diseases. This is not bad news. This is just the full display of what's possible when awareness takes form.
At the Peak-Arranged Wheel, three hundred sixty channels inside you right now. Seven hundred twenty syllables: ka ka ki ki and so on. Three hundred sixty light-spheres spinning, combining into one thousand eighty points of luminosity. Samantabhadra father-mother principles multiplying into two thousand eight hundred bodies. Each one carrying body-speech-mind deities, three of each. From the heart-center, wisdom-beings emanate in forms fine as hair, multiplying into three thousand two hundred forty aspects.
Eighteen thousand five hundred insects. Each carrying syllables. Each syllable containing wisdom-seeds. Three hundred three thousand five hundred three individual wisdom seeds. Eighteen thousand five hundred hidden afflictions not found in any scripture. Four hundred eighteen thousand potential problems. Three thousand two hundred forty channel-growings above.
And yet it's called the basis-of-all. Not because it's problematic. Because it's everything. The enumeration has no measure. The inventory cannot be completed. Sense-powers, sense-basis dharmas, all gathering into one vast display.
Here's the structure: four body-wheels, channels like life-trees, taste multiplying through all trembling. Outside, body-speech-mind arise. Inside, body-speech-mind arise. Secret emanation body, enjoyment body, dharma body—three kayas produced, standing straight as pillars.
The father's bindu syllable: A-Om-Ah-Hung sounds forth. The mother's castle dissolves.
This is not happening somewhere else. This is your constitution right now. Three kayas already present. Three poisons already transformed. The question isn't whether you're ready for enlightenment. The question is whether you'll stop long enough to recognize what you've been this whole time.
The recognition is immediate. The recognition is complete.
Nothing more to add. Nothing to remove.
Rest now in what was never disturbed.

The voice emerges from the same ground as everything else. Don't treat your speech as accidental.
Mother's condition carries three seed-syllables. Father's carries three. Six sounds gathered inside the child's body-speech-mind basis, arising from taste, from all-trembling, from the central channel's inside. Om and light and Samantabhadra father-mother's three bodies complete. Right side: Ah and light and three bodies. Left side: Hung and light and three bodies. Body-speech-mind—three of each—support complete.
From the four wheels, the basis-of-all produces first the navel, then consciousness completes, memory-gathering heart forms. Memory's taste experienced, speech-maker arises. Tastes gather in the throat. The crown of all's peak-arranged variety—four measures determined.
Here's where it gets personal: the voice. Channels' syllables moved by wind's sound. Clear syllables produce sweet voice. Unclear syllables produce unpleasant sound. From impure channels, the voice trembles. Pure channels produce steady resonance.
Males speak with thick voices—not from caste but from wide channel-spaces. Women carry five lineages, narrower channels, pretty colors. The voice thin because desire-seeds keep shaking. Clear and soft from attachment. Soft from ignorance. Quaking and agitating from anger. Thin and pleasant from pride and jealousy.
Slow, soft speech with few words—bliss-arising lineage. Harmless speech, gently spoken—child-nurturing lineage. The voice doesn't lie. Every tone reveals the conditioning underneath.
By seven-group four, the body forms. Nine completed. Forty-nine days of latencies gathering in the intermediate state. The basis takes shape. Then growth increases.
Your voice is not separate from your mind. Your speech is not separate from your awareness. Every word you speak is practice or poison. Every tone either heals or harms. This is not metaphor. This is acoustic reality. The channels don't hide anything.
Speak accordingly. Or don't speak. Both are practice.
The recognition doesn't require words. But when words arise, let them arise from recognition.
Rest now. The rest is silence.

Even before birth, boys and girls are already different. Not in worth. In orientation.
Male children gaze inward from the mother's right lung—already preparing to hold their own home. Female children gaze outward from the left—already oriented toward leaving. This is not cultural conditioning. This is constitution. From dependent-origination's action, the pattern begins. At nine months and ten days for boys, nine months for girls, birth occurs.
Wind from avadhuti moves through the nose-channels, right and left. Afflictions grow coarser. The storehouse of many karmic actions takes shape.
Four elements mature the body: earth becomes flesh, water becomes blood, fire becomes warmth, wind becomes breath. But these are not neutral processes. Flesh generates delusion. Blood generates desire-attachment. Warmth generates anger. Breath generates pride. Jealousy and other poisons arise as natural byproducts.
The body is not separate from the mind. The constitution is not separate from the confusion. First, desire-attachment motivates everything—this is why beings are born at all. Then, anger shapes the blood, gives rise to speech. Then, ignorance shapes the mind, gives rise to confusion. Riding the breath-horse, going through the world, the three poisons generate different thoughts.
Where does each poison mature? Delusion matures in sleep. Desire-attachment matures in laughter. Anger matures in dreams. The body reflects the conditioning: heavy flesh means heavy sleep. Anger's heat produces vivid dreams of moisture and warmth. When anger rises, the body heats up, speech becomes urgent. When desire-attachment rises, moisture arises, agitation follows.
All of this from depending on flesh, the form-aggregate spreads.
You're not a person who sometimes gets afflicted. You're an affliction that sometimes takes human form. The structure is built into the materials.
But here's the cut: the materials were never solid to begin with. The flesh is empty. The blood is empty. The heat and breath are empty. The poisons are empty. The dreams are empty. The sleep is empty.
What remains when emptiness is recognized? Nothing to fix. No one to fix it.
Rest in that. The rest is already complete.
PAGE 337
Here's where it all converges. Don't miss this.
From blood comes perception. From heat comes consciousness. From breath come formations. Depending on wind completing outward, feeling spreads through everything. Flesh generates channel. Channel generates wind. Wind generates both action and wisdom simultaneously. Action gathers samsara. Wisdom gathers nirvana. Same wind. Different result depending entirely on recognition.
The structure branches: blood generates lymph, lymph generates bindu, bindu generates five faculties. Faculties arise from five afflictions. Objects appear as five conditions. Past, present, future—all thought-collections gathered into one display. Samsara and nirvana arise from the same cause. The difference is not in the cause. The difference is in how you look at it.
Then comes the ultimate level. Four elements beyond convention:
White color greatly spreading—far-lasso water-lamp arises from earth channel. Red, greatly red—empty bindu lamp arises from water channel. Yellow, greatly yellow—pure space lamp arises from fire-wind channel. Green, greatly green—self-arisen wisdom lamp arises from wind channel.
Each lamp illuminates the same reality from a different angle. Self-arisen wisdom generates awareness. Far-lasso generates light. Bindu generates body. Space generates wisdom. The display is complete.
What sees all this? Far-lasso's dharmata directly seen. Empty bindu's experience fully present. Space awareness measuring everything. Self-arisen wisdom engaging dharmata exhausted—all appearances recognized as manifestations of wisdom itself.
From the eye-door wisdom arises. Actual engagement.
This is the end of the first chapter—eleven levels of how the body forms, how samsara constructs itself. Now the text shifts to particulars: channel, wind, bindu. Basis channel. Supported wind. Abiding bindu.
Three aspects of the same indivisible system.
You think you have a body that sometimes has spiritual experiences? The body is the spiritual experience. The channels are wisdom. The winds are wisdom. The bindu is wisdom.
Recognition is not adding anything. Recognition is not achieving anything. Recognition is stopping long enough to see what you've always been.
Rest now. The rest is recognition itself.

The three main channels. Pay attention. This is the architecture of your awareness.
From the Pearl Garland, all channels arise. Subtle. Quick. Essence possessing. Beautiful by their own light rays. Three divisions: right, left, middle. Not male and female in the ordinary sense—right and left refer to energy patterns, not gender. But the patterns do influence how you experience reality.
The three chief channels: Roma, Kyangma, Kun'darma. Every other channel branches from these three. These are not metaphors. These are literal pathways of energy and awareness running through your body right now.
Roma takes all tastes, like salt permeating everything. Depending on bindu's bliss, experiencing uncommon enjoyment—this is called taste. But the name also comes from desire-attachment being the cause. The one who possesses desire-attachment and depends on Roma becomes Buddha. Or, Roma is the channel of few actions, depending on bindu's confusion, experiencing enjoyment difficult to express—thus called ma. The syllables matter. The names are not arbitrary.
Within Roma moves the relative bindu, carrying method's nature.
Kyangma—the straight one. Not crooked, not branched. A clear hollow channel. Nature arising from both ultimate bindu and relative bindu as cause. From that cause, ultimate element and relative element mature and separate. Straight, thus unchanging. All's basis, thus called mo. Depending on this channel, without effort you become Buddha. That's what it says. Not through striving. Through recognition of what's already there.
Kun'darma—all gathering. Depending on this, bindu and channel's bliss and wind's bliss all arise. Thus ku. That pervading everything, thus darma. Kun'darma means the gathering of all phenomena into one expanse.
Where are these channels located? Roma coils from the navel's left side, all coils moving to the right. Kyangma exits from the heart peak's left, emerges from the throat channel's net, returns through the cranium's inside, opens the left eye door. Roma also flows from the right eye. Kun'darma—the all-gathering channel, present throughout.
You're not learning anatomy. You're mapping your own enlightenment. Every channel is a pathway to recognition. Every bindu is a point of wisdom. The structure is not blocking you. The structure is pointing you home.
No need to force anything. The channels are already clear. The winds are already moving. The bindu is already present.
Recognition is not doing. Recognition is resting in what's already the case.
Rest now. The rest takes care of itself.
