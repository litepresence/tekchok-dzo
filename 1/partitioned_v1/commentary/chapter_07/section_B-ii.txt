[13133-13136] Look at this madness, practitioner! The five races' power draws the father's consciousness inward, like iron to lodestone. Then, free from attachment, it goes to the mother's lotus—but because any race's drawing agent exists in the mother, there's no satisfaction with bliss. This is desire and attachment born from cause and condition!
[13137-13142] Desire and attachment—these two held as cause and condition. Samsara's body held by the ground wind. Knowing cause and condition as nondual, the result of bliss and great bliss interweaves as body and wisdom's result. Thus, on the first day's night from the mother's womb, father's cause and mother's condition become one external cause, while internally unmixed they dwell like a chick in an egg, holding the child's wind-mind. The four elements' binding cause—like a jewel shell—binds without opportunity for separation. This comes from when body completes without food from the mouth, life cannot remain.
[13143-13153] At that time, the wind holding the body—the inner wind's leaping power soars upward, like mercury drops rising, dwelling quivering. When body completes, whatever adventitious condition occurs to body-mind, there's fear and body trembling—from this. Then on the second day, earth mixes as one, pressing with weight—the child has suffering from the crown pressed down like a thousand. At this time, the body's cause is held as merely flesh, while condition channels are merely water moistening. From nondual ignorance cause-condition, non-conceptual wisdom liberates—the great perfection's key beyond acceptance and rejection! Above, the body's cause moistens, merely blood coagulating, while condition water merely flows down channels.
Emaho! See how samsara forms from confusion!

The work of production. How your body and mind arise from letters, from elements, from sounds you cannot hear but that nonetheless create everything you experience.
Within that, the syllable SAṀ—yellow, clear, radiant. Attachment. From this syllable, bound to beings' voices, all experience arises.
The four directions: earth, water, fire, wind. Channels of each, gathering and spreading. Within them: SUṀ white, red, green—each color, each channel, each abiding in its place. From this, the four activities of beings—going, sleeping, sitting, acting—all arise.
Then the sixth day: fire and wind combining, the body's form taking shape. Within the blazing, expanding fire channel, the syllable RĀṀ—greatly scraping, pulsing. This syllable distinguishes all beings' cognition: sharp and dull, clear and unclear.
The four directions again, the inner elements, the channels expanding. Within burning, the syllables RĀṀ producing, RUṀ empty. These become the signs of sleep, the markers of dreams. From these, beings' memory and thought arise, spinning the wheel of mental activity.
Six days complete, and the elements become the body's support, the form's foundation.
Without this, the four elements cannot control food and clothing. The inner dharmas cannot manifest as groups. The four secret empowerments' fruits remain immature. The four forms become the certain support.
Then: the work of elements over days and nights, male and female combining, seed growing. The elements and the genders together create the body's aggregation.
On the seventh day, the four elements become one taste. Four causes: wind, mind. Four supports: flesh, blood, warmth, breath. Four channels. Four syllables—becoming one form, the aggregate of everything gathered.
Here's what's being described: your body is a construction. Letters, syllables, elements, channels—all coming together to create this apparatus you call "me." The sounds you cannot hear are building everything you experience.
Don't mistake the construction for the builder. Don't identify with the built. The elements will disperse. The syllables will return to their sources. The channels will dissolve.
What's left? The awareness that was never built, never constructed, never formed from elements and syllables. That's who you really are. Not the body. Not the mind. The presence that watches it all arise and dissolve.
Watch it. Don't identify with it. You're the awareness, not the construction.
The wind channels moving, leaping. YAṀ—the syllable of movement, of breath, of the going and coming of all beings. From this syllable, existence pulses.
Earth channels, water gathering, fire's three actions. YAṀ again, piling and separating. YE separating and gathering. AUM—rolling, bowing, abiding.
Within the four syllables, the aggregates form at the particle level. The form aggregate: particles, subtle. The perception aggregate: warmth, like a horse galloping through space. The feeling aggregate: memory's cord, coiled three ways. The consciousness aggregate: knowing, color, movement. The formation aggregate: feeling's doors opening.
Five aggregates arising from the elements, five bases from conditions. Around these five, like a net of light, the five syllables adorn the five heads of the five supports: DZRIṀ, KHAṀ, TĀṀ, MAṀ, BYAṀ. These are the five buddha families, the five vital points.
From these syllables, transformation happens. The changeless awareness becomes buddha certain.
Within water channels, four aspects: primordial wisdom, not opening, not distinguishing. The body becomes a thousand subtle drops, cooled, clear. Five lights gathering, five wisdoms arising.
The syllable OM and others—AUM, DZRIṀ, KHAṀ, HŪṀ, TĀM, SWĀ, MAṀ, HAPYAM—from these, certainty of awakening.
All of this is the wisdom that is self-arisen, spontaneously present. Not constructed, not made. Already complete within the construction itself.
The five buddha families, five wisdoms, five lights—all arising from the same source. The syllable contains everything. The body is a display of syllables, a congregation of sounds that have arranged themselves into form.
What does this mean for you?
You're not just flesh and bone. You're syllables, sounds, elements, lights arranged in this particular pattern. The pattern will dissolve back into its elements. The syllables will return to their sources.
But awareness—the knowing that experiences all this—that was never a syllable, never an element, never formed from parts. Awareness is the space in which syllables arise and dissolve.
Don't identify with the syllables. They're just visitors, passing through. You are the sky they're passing through.
The construction is temporary. The sky is permanent.
Wisdom self-arisen, spontaneously present. The wisdom that grasps characteristics, that gathers knowing, that abides as light. This is the mirror-like wisdom, the first of the five.
The past wisdom, primordial purity, white light like stars covering everything. From this, dharmata arises unstained by karmic latencies. The wisdom that gathers samsara and nirvana into one knowing.
Wind-channel wisdom, non-conceptual mind, abiding. The wisdom of equalness, red light, self-arisen realization. Yellow light, other-arisen realization. Wisdom that knows existence and non-existence, phenomena and non-phenomena—this is the discriminating wisdom, the third.
All-knowing wisdom, the fourth, gathers into two: ultimate and conventional. From this, the fruition of the three kayas. Birth, abiding, death—pleasure and pain—all experienced. The yogin's body becomes the nature of the three kayas.
Body's characteristics, grasping wisdom—dharmakaya certainty found. Abiding wisdom—sambhogakaya. Ceasing wisdom—nirmanakaya. The three kayas are not somewhere else. They are what you are when wisdom is recognized.
Seven days—the body's basis thickens. All approaching-accomplishing actions gathered in seven days. Elements gathering and expanding, accomplished in seven days.
The wisdom that is like a horse, like wind—when the body dissolves, it's not that wisdom ends. It continues, moving, abiding elsewhere.
Letters, lights, bodies—all arise from awareness's self-radiance, then dissolve back into ignorance itself, into awareness.
Awareness, base-abiding, inner clarity expanding—without color, without form. When the body exists, appearances arise outward. Light body, form body—even in the bardo, appearances arise.
What does this mean?
You're not becoming a buddha. You're recognizing that you already are the wisdom that has always been present. The five wisdoms aren't achievements—they're what awareness naturally is when not confused by appearances.
Mirror-like: reflecting everything without keeping anything. Equal: not favoring pleasure over pain, nirvana over samsara. Discriminating: knowing exactly what things are without混淆. Accomplishing: acting without hesitation. Dharmadhatu: the vast space where all of this happens.
These aren't acquired. They're uncovered. Like removing dust from a mirror—the reflection was always there.
You're not becoming. You're revealing.
Spontaneously present, naturally perfect. Not made, not constructed, just naturally abiding. The three kayas are already complete in this body—this is why the path of wisdom arises from the body's basis.
Then the second seven, the action of arising as before. Within eleven days, in the eight water channels of the first wheel, syllables and lights arise. Father-mother in union, expanding from the channels. The channels moved by winds, generating and dispersing.
Eight channels, eight types of arising. Eight bases of consciousness. Within these, eight consciousnesses appear as self-arisen syllables.
These consciousnesses arise depending on objects of experience, using the six realms as their domain.
From the four channels, the wind of method manifests as the syllable KHASPUNG—self-ripening. From this, many syllables emanate. The earth channels' wheels rising, between them the KHASPUNG wind, subtle as a grain of rice, not touching, grasping. Like stars covering, light's radiance, syllables blazing.
Below, the lotus padma expanding.
Then fourteen days, the four supports of alaya becoming like flickering flames. The water element's germ producing the basis: subtle, changing knowing, expanding, karmic winds becoming the four bodies.
Within these, the supports from before appearing like reflections. One body, life uninterrupted—this is the body of transformation.
This is called the transformation body. Father-mother buddhas, two-non-abiding—hence "body-less," not form but not formless.
Here's what this means: the wisdom was always present. The construction—syllables, channels, winds, consciousnesses—was just arranging what was already complete.
You're not building wisdom. You're recognizing what's always been here. The syllables come and go. The channels appear and dissolve. The body of transformation continues its work.
But awareness—that which knows all this—that was never constructed, never arranged, never made. It's naturally perfect, spontaneously present.
Stop trying to create what is already here. Stop arranging what is already complete. Rest in what's naturally present.
That's the practice. Not adding. Not fixing. Just recognizing what's always been.
From one form, the body's limit. Freedom attained in the expanse. Beyond thousands, beyond counting. Even this space-becoming, abandoning the work of containing. Form's limit, particles, space, knowing.
The germs, the winds of attachment and desire arising for each being—this is how samsara begins.
Then the third seven days. From fifteen days, the earth channels expanding—light, syllables, the basis of memory appearing as golden vapor. Within clouds gathering like space, the winds of karmic action moving.
From eighteen days, the eighteen elements complete. The eighteen bases forming, calculated, changing, becoming lumps of eighteen.
The elements pairing, the work of gathering complete, previous power exhausted. The eighteen elements' vapor like egg-white, grasping the elements, the wind of phlegm, bile, etc. Diseases arising as before.
Then from twenty-two to twenty-five days, the elements' power and the body's basis completing.
What is being described here? The detailed anatomy of how you became trapped in this body. How consciousness got mixed with elements, how winds got tangled with desires, how memory became solid.
This isn't philosophy. It's forensic analysis of your imprisonment. Every step is described: how clarity became form, how spaciousness became bound, how freedom became limitation.
The elements didn't trap you. You chose it. Attachment, desire, grasping—these winds moved through the channels and built this cage. Not accidentally. Deliberately. Because somewhere along the way, you thought suffering would be enjoyable.
Now you have a body. Now you have limits. Now you have disease and death.
But the wisdom was never trapped. The awareness was never bound. Only the construction was formed. Only the cage was built.
You are not the cage. You are what built the cage and can recognize that it was never necessary.
The elements will disperse. The winds will calm. The cage will fall. Awareness will remain, never having been confined.
The question is: will you wait for death to recognize this, or will you recognize it now?
Fourth day: elemental power manifesting, eight channel wheels arise. Clear lights and syllables illuminating. Gathering wheels of taste like starlight. Wheels stacked like petals—the channel wheels are named.
Within these eight, at the center of five desire objects, bliss-touch's support. Warmth's essence, sheep-fat-like, the twelve sense bases' basis. The wheel of gathering and expanding, the karmic support of alaya.
Then from twenty-nine to thirty-two days: water gathers and holds, earth stabilizes and presses, fire blazes and expands, wind flames and moves. The work performed.
Thirty-second day: elemental power exhausted. Arises the wild wind of producing action. The four wind channels sent upward and outward. Upon the mustard-seed space of subtle particles, four more channels expand.
At their center, Tip-of-Force Wind petal, star-light-like radiance gathering. The power of the above element-basis exhausted.
Then thirty-four days: basis-of-all's four supports with their groups solidified. Affliction-gathering and coarse channel poison's vapor—poison-vase gathering. Tip-Arranged Wheel thus named and abides.
Thirty-fifth day: the King's Letter Tantra complete arises.
Seven by seven sections—forty-nine days, existence body's four channel wheels produced.
This is how a body is built. Forty-nine days of construction. Elements gathering, channels forming, winds moving, syllables resonating. All the apparatus of experience assembled piece by piece.
The body isn't you. The body is a construction site, still under construction from the moment of conception until death. Particles, channels, winds, syllables—all arranging themselves into this apparatus you call "me."
The construction has a purpose: to experience. To taste, to touch, to feel pleasure and pain. To gather the five desire objects through twelve sense bases. To perpetuate the wheel.
But the constructor—the awareness that set all this in motion—that was never constructed. That never formed from elements, never gathered from channels, never depended on winds.
You are not the construction. You are the constructor. The house is not the homeowner.
The house will fall. The construction will end. The forty-nine days will complete and then dissolve.
The constructor remains, never having been born, never having died, never having been formed.
Which are you? The house or the homeowner?
Each channel has eight petals, thirty-two channels abiding in the body. From the river of existence grasped by twelve limbs, the body's basis arose.
From thirty-two channels, thirty-two wisdoms' work arises. From essence, the four lamps' ultimate bindu ripening. Here's the crucial point: when bliss becomes the path, through forceful method, buddhahood is certain. When impurity arises, the conventional bindu forms. From four elements' ripening, suffering enters the self-continuum, samsara's seed increasing.
But—depending on the channel's vital point, when made the path—the excellent bliss of dharmata is directly realized. These channels become the path of primordial wisdom. Gone to the nature of bindu, doing the work of bliss and suffering's experience.
Then from thirty-five days, individual elements' work's power completing. Form gathers and expands into countless aggregates. The five aggregates' race manifestly projects.
Until forty-two days, eighty-two thousand water-insects' body increased. Upon that wheel, sixty-two channel-petals shown—the cause of sixty-two eons' birth and death arising.
Within each channel, special channel-abade letters, one light-mass supporting each. Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abiding. Sixty-two channel-tips.
The same channels, the same channels' letters, the same lights—they can become wisdom or they can become ignorance. Can become the path of liberation or the path of entanglement. Can manifest as thirty-two wisdoms or as eighty-two thousand defilements.
The construction is the same. The materials are identical. The difference is only how you use it.
When the channels' vital point is recognized, the impurities become wisdom. When the impurities are not recognized, wisdom becomes impurities.
You choose. Every moment, you choose. The channels are already complete. The wisdom is already present. The question is only whether you recognize it.
If you recognize: liberation, certain, now. If you don't recognize: continuation, suffering, more construction.
There's no middle ground. No gradual path. Either you see it or you don't. Either you recognize the channels as wisdom or you take them as self.
The body is built. The channels are arranged. The wisdom is present.
Will you recognize it?
