[14505-14509] Ta and La at the vajra, upper and lower—press these two, and the bindu's movement stops. The syllable Sha at the vajra tip—pressing these two abandons desire. Listen! When yogic illness strikes the body, repeatedly press and release all these.
[14510-14519] Gathering diseases are extracted from the root by this. Tsa and Tsa are below the navel, right and left. Ta and Ta are at the armpits, right and left. To and To are at the hips, right and left. Ja and Ja are below the navel, right and left. Ta and Ta are at the kidneys, right and left. Do not press these inward—recite and release upward, and the elements become balanced.
[14520-14526] Below the waist, however it may be, reciting these syllables with effort, element diseases certainly dissolve in their own place. Right and left are the key points of the syllables themselves. Hot and cold—white and red colors. These are the colors of the syllables. Other than these, root syllables have no benefit or harm.
[14527-14545] Second, the heart dharma wheel—from four: first, generally showing the numbers. From eight root vessels, thirty-two branch into countless leaf channels. From the wheel location: The dharma wheel's channels—not past thirty-two. Channels of karma and wisdom dwell. Know these! From the heart dharma wheel: Thirty-two major channel leaves, one thousand nine hundred minor channels dwell. From their forms: four gathering channels become twenty-eight. Twenty-eight gathering channels, fourteen awareness channels, five body channels, four light and wisdom channels. The location of these major channels having three wheels as above. The first wheel is as above; the second will be explained here.
[14546-14559] Twenty-five wisdom channels, five gathering channels. Two mind channels. The third wheel will be explained. Five bindu channels, eight prajna channels, two ignorance channels, fifteen gathering channels, five light-ray channels, element channels likewise. Two are empty channels. The first wheel will be explained: five awareness channels, five body channels—each having two. Ten gathering channels, three phlegm channels, two wind channels, two bile channels. The rest are gathering. Four light and wisdom channels are called actual things.
[14560-14581] The second wheel is thus: twenty-five wisdom channels are five dharmadhatu wisdoms. Mirror-like is likewise equal. Five are equality wisdom. Likewise five discriminating, five all-accomplishing. Five gathering channels are the five abiding elements. From two mind channels: wind and consciousness abiding. The third wheel explained: five bindu channels—two conventional bindus, two awareness bindus, one wisdom bindu. Eight prajna channels: two discern, two gather, two liberate, the rest maintain. Two ignorance channels self-place press. Fifteen gathering channels: four phlegm-mind, five delusion-bile, four anger-wind, two desire-gathering. Five light-ray channels: base light-ray, path light-ray one, the rest eye light-ray.
[14582-14605] From the citta jewel palace, three wheels possessing channel leaves ninety-six.
Do not make this into philosophy, dear practitioner! These channels, these wheels, these bindus—they are your very body. Press, recite, release—this is the path of subtle body. Balance the elements, and liberation is at hand.
[14606-14617] Look here! These channels—some have water-yellow essence, some blood essence, some wind and earth elements, some five elements' essence. Each one has essences dwelling in sequence! Wind and bindu dwelling—each channel has one of each. These spreading as wind, merely dwelling in form. Do you see? It's all the play of essences, practitioner! Water, blood, wind, earth—your body is a mandala of elements!
[14618-14630] Their function and enumeration—from the dharma wheel's petals: five go upward, vitality radiance and wisdom sending. Five go left, prajna flow and sense faculties holding. Five dwell in joints and center, secret continuity's basis. Five dwell in directions and center, arising-sending and setting-gathering. Thus channel forms—two existent secret channels... [text continues]
Do you see the pattern? Up, left, center, joints, directions—channels weave through your body like threads in a tapestry! And who weaves? No weaver! Just wisdom-display! Emaho!
[14754-14761] Ha! You think you know this body, practitioner? Cut here—liver diseases flee. That short rut inside—the kha kha small heat channel—cut it for phlegm. Dza at the bile corner of the elbow—that's the right upper channel—cut for lung disease. Left side too, dza dwells—the left upper channel—yellow phlegm flees. Don't you see? These points aren't anatomy—they're where your energy knots itself into delusion!

Ring finger back straight, tsa dwells—kidney crooked channel—kidney disease. Little toe's back, da—the male crooked channel—male disease. Palm center, dha dwells—black liver channel—male liver disease. This is your body, fool! Not meat and bone—the mandala itself! Cut through the knot and recognize! Emaho!
[14754-14761] Listen here, dear practitioner! These channels are not for cutting with knives! Cutting this benefits all liver diseases. In the short rut of that, dwells the kha kha small heat channel—cut it for phlegm disease. At the bile corner of the elbow dwells dza, called the right upper channel—cut it for lung disease. At the left also dwells dza, the left upper channel—cut thus for yellow phlegm.
[14762-14778] At the center back of the knee, ta dwells straight—called the back channel neck completion—cut it for upper body disease. Between the thumb and forefinger of the hand, at the span of one tsen, dwells Ta—called the heart channel white woman—cut it for kidney, bile, and heart diseases.

Recognize the knot and it unravels itself! Emaho!
[14807-14813] By this, benefit comes to that illness. Yogis accomplish by pressing. These are the key syllables summarized. The rest have no benefit or harm. Pressing, shaking, and drawing—the yogi should know these.
Listen! The throat chakra—the wheel of enjoyment. Here speech becomes mantra, voice becomes vajra song. Press the channels, shake the elements, draw the winds—this is the yogi's play.
[14814-14827] Third, the throat enjoyment wheel—from four: first, generally showing the numbers. Sixteen channel leaves. From these, inner and outer divide into countless minor leaves. Three hundred forty major inner channels dwell in the coils of seven wheels. From the wheel location: At the throat enjoyment wheel dwell three hundred forty major channels. Having seven wheels in sequence: the first wheel's leaves are ten. The rest are all like that. All have twenty at the end. These are the channel types.
[14828-14838] Karma and affliction latencies, wisdom movement channels, gathering channels—these are the paths. Sixteen wisdom movements, awareness bodies likewise that many. Sixteen prajna bindus, elements also sixteen. Eight channels of empty-clear bindu. Fourteen gathering channels. The rest are path karma.
[14839-14849] The awareness body wheels—sixteen in number. Seven are actual awareness. The rest are bodies. First, the root channel awareness body. Second is the expansive body. Third flows to the heart. Fourth, unchanging vajra body. Fifth, bodhisattva body. Sixth is the nature itself. Seventh, seeing self-liberation.
[14850-14861] Eighth, true bliss body. One extra is the moving. For awareness, two each. Sixteen prajna bindus—eight are empty bindu movement. Four are ground-path bindus. The rest are wisdom movement paths. Sixteen element leaves: from four come wind essences, from four come wisdom-fire essences, from three come earth-yellow essences, from three come water-blood essences.
Emaho! The throat wheel where speech becomes dharma! Press, shake, draw—liberation is in your very channels!
[14862-14868] Space-of essence mind first that from change only. You read this and think of bindus moving? The bindu that moves is not the bindu that matters. The bindu that matters never entered any channel.
[14869-14876] Four phlegm channels, four bile, four wind, two earth. Fourteen affliction paths—who walks them? The walker is the path. The path is empty.
[14877-14882] Throat enjoyment wheel, four above going, empty potency purifying. All true. But do not seek these wheels in the throat. The throat is a label. The enjoyment is recognition.
[14883-14891] Two all-pervading, two below, four right, four left. Wisdom potency, action power. These winds—have you found the windless? The one who knows wind has no breath.
[14892-14908] Direction portion, moving wind, dissolve reverse, grasping essence, form pair unite. Technical terms for children. The adult knows: all of this is spontaneous presence. Presence does not study.

[15099-15108] Listen! Ten channels produce earth element flesh! Ten channels space send forth mind! Twenty-eight prajna channels! Nine discern, nine gather essence! Five liberate prajna! Five agitate! Ten mind channels—each dwells! One dwells as two!
[15109-15122] Ten ignorance channels! Two dwell root-ignorance! Two dwell confusion-ignorance! Two dwell fourfold-confusion-ignorance! Two dwell grasping-conception! Remainder each one! Twelve mind aspects—each mind two channels! Twenty-eight affliction channels! Ten dwell hatred! Five dwell desire! Five dwell delusion! Four dwell jealousy! Four dwell pride! Thus channels and winds...
Do you see, practitioner? Every poison has its channel! Hatred, desire, delusion—all mapped in your body! But who maps? No mapper! Just wisdom playing at being confusion! Cut through the map and find what was never lost! Emaho!
[15183-15194] From that: bliss wheel's channels—these are outer limbs! Wheel stages possessed, outside stages right side: white conch spiral color similar, crown Brahma's aperture, lotus-like great channel, ba-men horn-like channel! From these two, branches six-fold divided!
[15195-15207] From that cakra's left side, transforming aspect: lotus-like right-left, two channels exist! From these spreading: ear's upper four finger-widths, right-left two each four! Cakra's outer rim front, wish-fulfilling tree shape, root trunk with branches, skull-crown near, buffalo-tongue similar one, from that forty channels! Below wheel's rim...

[15272-15288] Black color, hook shape—three are spiraled! Those also have thirty-thirty! These channel forms—elements' method and vital-point cause—practitioners must know! Wind and bindu gathering vital-point, consciousness's horse and essence—know as five-by-five! Wind and bile, phlegm, gathering, and four aspects! Desire-aggregate, delusion, hatred—from these they transform! Those characteristics—each also three-three! Sphere, heat, dwelling...
Do you see, practitioner? Your tongue alone holds sixty channels! Sixty doorways to recognition! Every taste, every speech, every breath—channels dancing their dance! Don't let this knowledge become mere counting! Each number is a finger pointing—follow it to your own face! Emaho!
[15354-15364] Crown top straight—letter A dwells! Medical tongue gnyan rope! Cut for heart fever disease! From here right one tsen—letter Kā dwells! Named Bodhi-right! Cut for right waist disease! Left one tsen—Kī letter! Named Bodhi-left! Cut for left waist disease!

Your skull alone holds sixteen vital points! Sixteen doorways to recognition! Don't cut with knives—cut with awareness! Emaho!
[15723-15750] Look here, practitioner! The year has twelve months, and in each the elements play their game. The sun's southern journey brings longer days, the northern return brings longer nights. Six hundred seventy-five winds increase and decrease with each water-clock measure—this is the breath of the world itself! Listen to the numbers: a day has eight watches, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts. Each shift holds 1,350 winds, each finger 338 and one-half plus eight movements, each watch 2,700 movements. Twelve element actions multiply twelve times twelve—this shows how twelve winds develop and decrease. The White Lotus commentary reveals: when the sun travels south, add and subtract time accordingly. Two water-clock measures change each month as the sun moves. When going south, day lengthens and night shortens; when reversed, day shortens and night lengthens. This is not mere calculation—this is the rhythm of your own life-force! The breath moving 675 times with each water-clock measure reveals the secret of longevity and health. Understand these movements, and you understand the deterioration and renewal of the elements within. This knowledge is the physician's wisdom, the yogin's clock, the key to mastering the body's inner winds. Practice with this understanding, and the channels open, the winds flow freely, and the mind settles into natural luminosity. Do not ignore these teachings as mere technical details—they are the very structure of existence itself!
Emaho! The fierce pressing reveals your face!
