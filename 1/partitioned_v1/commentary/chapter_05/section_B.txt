Listen, dear practitioner! Lines [8854-8872] reveal the fourfold unelaborate—gateway to mind's change!
First, unelaborate of unelaborate! Through this, fortunate mind changes! Second, unelaborate without elaboration! The method to enter inside shown! Third, very unelaborate without elaboration! Concepts purify, mind changes! Fourth, special unelaborate without elaboration! Meaning of non-duality obtained!
These four empowerments are like four keys to four gates! Each opens deeper than the last! Body, speech, mind, consciousness—each finds bliss through purification!
Lines [8863-8871] reveal the three kayas' display! Unelaborate shows nirmanakaya field—aggregates, elements, sense bases emptied! Very unelaborate shows sambhogakaya field—mind's coming and going realized as non-existent! Special unelaborate gives dharmakaya prophecy—samsara and nirvana's attachment, subtle knowledge obscuration purified!
Like a knot untying itself! Like ice melting in the sun! Effortless self-liberation!
Second, self-face difference extensively explained! Four empowerments elaborated! Elaborate-with-elaborate—drink water, outer! Elaborate-without-elaborate—enter mandala, deity shown, name given! Elaborate-with-very-elaborate—sravaka vow, nine complete, breath held! Elaborate-with-special-elaborate—vase certain, body seal perfect!
Progressive like grades in school! Each builds the foundation for the next! You drink, you enter, you receive—each empowerment opens what was closed!
Also vase certain explained! Palace relied upon, deity clear! Student body becomes deity, four elements purified! Substance sun-moon given, consort given, practice certain, sign-meaning-word given!
Like receiving a key to a locked treasure house! Like being given the crown of a king! Receiving opens recognition!
Emaho! The four gates to liberation!
PAGE 217 COMMENTARY
Listen, you who would understand sixteen! Lines 8884-8894 speak of elaborate difference purpose—body four elements four destroy, sixteen purify. You destroy and purify! But destroying is transforming. Like a fire burning fuel—destroys form, releases energy.
Second unelaborate at lines 8887-8894—four empowerments self face difference, body speech mind consciousness four syllable place purify, three doors basis effort beyond show, five objects path raise five doors liberate, realization special produce. You purify and produce! But production is manifestation. Like a tree bearing fruit—natural result.
Third very unelaborate at lines 8895-8903—self face difference, elaborate border separate, mandala offer request, sky mandala enter, knowing self introduce. You separate enter introduce! But introduction is crucial. Like meeting someone important—remember the moment.
Fourth utterly unelaborate at lines 8904-8914—self face difference, elaborate posture show, gaze do, four directions gaze stance rely, go perfect. You show and do! But showing demonstrates. Like a dancer performing—exhibits skill.
PAGE 218 COMMENTARY
You who analyze the mind! Lines 8913-8926 describe here mind consciousness—five doors object hold thought basis-consciousness, not connect before after, self appearance object hold, non-thing hold, clear unclear hold separate. You hold and separate! But this is analysis. Like a scientist examining—understands by dividing.
Thus self face difference at lines 8919-8926—each outer inner secret perfect four four sixteen exist. You count sixteen! But they are one nature. Like sixteen flavors of ice cream—different tastes, same essence.
Third emanation difference at lines 8920-8930—very extensive elaborate three, empowerment each purify difference sixteen, body action rely certain difference, number difference rely action affliction purify. You purify through action! But action transforms. Like exercise changing the body—effort produces result.
First empowerment at lines 8923-8930—self face difference sixteen outer arise action purify, inside mind thought purify, secret wind pull gather purify, unsurpassed sixteen ground dwell certainty. You arise and purify! But arising is natural. Like waves rising in ocean—natural movement.
PAGE 219 COMMENTARY
Listen, dear practitioner! Look here at lines [8941-8964]! The stains that cling to your body, speech, mind, and consciousness—these are not your true nature! Like dust settling on a mirror, they obscure but do not change what is already perfect and pure.
The four empowerments are the waters that wash these stains away. Body, speech, mind, consciousness—each carries four stains, sixteen in total. But look deeper! These sixteen multiply through elaboration-with and elaboration-without, sign and meaning, until thirty-two obscurations stand purified. Like a lotus rising through muddy water, you emerge unstained!
Lines [8951-8958] reveal the eightfold path of purification: elaboration-with sign and meaning, elaboration-without sign and meaning, very elaboration-without, and extremely elaboration-without. Each doorway leads to the same primordial purity. Like rivers flowing to the ocean—all paths converge in realization!
The mind that thinks virtue and non-virtue, prophecy and non-prophecy, grasping and rejecting—all these thoughts are the very stains themselves! But who is the thinker? Search and you will find only empty space. Like searching for the color of the sky—you look everywhere and find nothing to grasp!
Doubt is the demon that binds you. Analysis is the net that ensnares you. Release the mind that holds objects variously! Let thoughts arise and dissolve like clouds in the vast sky of awareness. The thirty-two stains purify not through effort but through recognition—seeing their true nature as emptiness!
Emaho! The stains were never real!
[8973-8986] Four empowerments divide method and prajna two-by-two, eight purifications! Body's elements particular: earth and so on, each with four—earth's earth and so on—sixteen. Hot and cold two divisions make sixty-four, sign-meaning division's sixty-four empowerments purify! Also four elements each well divided: sixty-four. Pervading element general body and self-characteristic held actual body two divisions—earth has different bodies hundred twenty-eight. Similarly divided, water, fire, wind each hundred twenty-eight, three sets, combined five hundred twelve bodies ripen!
[8987-8997] Thus outer body ripens, inner afflictions too: desire—looking, laughing, holding, embracing—four, each element's body four-by-four, sixteen. Delusion—dulled unknowing, obscured, intoxicated, greatly non-recognition mixed—four divided into four, sixteen. Hatred—hating, great hating, greatly hating... Do you see? Five hundred twelve bodies without, sixteen afflictions within—all from element-play!
Emaho! Your confusion is element-dance!
PAGE 221 COMMENTARY
Listen, you who would purify completely! Lines 1-58 describe that which purifies—empowerment of that which purifies, means of purifying body and afflictions through divisions of number, four types of empowerment, first elaborated based on elaboration divided into four. You divide to purify! But division is for understanding. Like cutting a cake to serve—still one cake.
Elaborated's elaborated external at lines 7-10—preparation assembly, offering tooth-stick, internal offering mandala, secret tying protection cord, complete examining dreams. You prepare and offer! But offering opens. Like opening a gift—reveals what was hidden.
Its unelaborated external at lines 12-14—ablution, request, vajra calling. You wash and request! But washing cleans. Like bathing—removes dirt, reveals clean body.
Its internal at lines 16-19—drinking samaya oath-water, oath abandoning samsara, accepting nirvana, not doing beings' benefit. You drink and swear! But oaths bind. Like a promise—keeps one committed.
PAGE 222 COMMENTARY
You who continue the empowerments! Lines 1-58 describe its secret—samaya, giving vows, entering mandala, offering mind-flower, complete entering showing deity-face, throwing flower, name empowerment. You enter and receive! But entering means commitment. Like entering a house—step across threshold.
Its utterly unelaborated external at lines 30-43—entering sravaka mandala, showing ground path, giving upper lower covers, bowl fan, discipline's edge, action distinction, indicating dependent arising, giving meditation, prophecy, entering bodhisattva mandala, generating mind, giving vows, holding distinction-mind. You enter many mandalas! But all lead to one. Like different roads to same city—destination matters.
Its internal empowerment at lines 45-53—entering kriya mandala, generating mind, holding vows, throwing flower, showing deity-face, name empowerment, prophecy, encouraging, emitting breath, conferring empowerment. You receive step by step! But each step is important. Like climbing stairs—each one brings you higher.
Likewise entering upa yoga at line 55—nine types each twenty-seven. You do twenty-seven! But twenty-seven are nine times three. Like combinations—same elements, different arrangements.
[9109-9117] Listen well, dear practitioner! Longchenpa unfolds the mandala of methods like a merchant counting treasures. The complete examination of dreams—good and bad omens—six in number for those who elaborate. Then the progression: elaboration-without's outer, inner, secret, and complete—nine, thirteen, seventeen, twenty-one. Do you see the pattern? Each layer adds four, like rings expanding in a pond!
For the Shravakas—six; for the Pratyekabuddhas—five more, making eleven; for the Bodhisattvas—four, totaling fifteen. These are not just numbers, dear one! They represent how methods multiply as compassion deepens, as the view widens!
[9118-9128] Now the inner empowerments! Kriya—nine, making twenty-four; Upa—nine, thirty-three; Yoga—nine, forty-two. The secret empowerments: Maha—twelve, fifty-four; Anu—six, sixty complete; Ati—four, sixty-four. See how Atiyoga has the fewest methods? Not because it's deficient, but because it's complete! When recognition dawns, who needs elaborate techniques?
The very-without-elaboration: sixty-four becomes ninety-four. The without-elaboration: fifteen makes hundred-and-nine. The with-elaboration: six, plus eight conveyance dharmas, fifteen. These aren't abstract mathematics—these are the pathways from confusion to recognition, from bondage to liberation!
[9129-9133] Look at the outer empowerments of without-elaboration's with-elaboration: lama's action and student's action—two. Inner: mandala and vase—four. Secret: mandala's well-explained dharma—five; vase's well explanation—five, making ten. Each number is a door, practitioner! Enter through any, and you reach the same palace. But Atiyoga's door is widest—no door at all! Emaho!
[9141-9149] Listen, dear one! The secret mandala entry—three aspects: introducing awareness into expanse through vital-point, pointing out expanse-awareness through deity recognition, making Buddha's heir through name empowerment. These three, plus the complete: outer prophecy through verses on sense-faculties and objects—experiencing non-dual knowledge and sphere; inner mind-clarity prophecy through verses—empowerment free from birthless recognition; secret entering without division—encouragement through verses showing non-dual expanse-awareness great bliss. Twelve in total!
Do you see? Each level peels back another layer of obscuration. Outer: sense and object dissolve. Inner: mind's clarity reveals no birth. Secret: expanse and awareness were never two!
[9150-9169] The very-without-elaboration's outer: suitable entry, suitable attainment—two. Inner: certain conduct, certain view—four. Secret: race distinction, self-abiding—six. Complete: cause and condition—eight. The completely-without-elaboration's outer: mind abiding, speech abiding—two. Inner: speech transformed, mind attained—four. Secret: bliss prophesied, secret released—six. Complete: dwelling in manifestation, own action attained—eight. Thus without-elaboration's with-elaboration: sixteen. Its without-elaboration: twelve, making twenty-eight. Its very-without-elaboration: eight, thirty-six. Its completely-without-elaboration: eight.
[9170] Through empowerment, attained result: sixty-four! Listen, practitioner—all these numbers are fingers pointing at the moon. Don't count the fingers! Look at what they indicate: your own nature, already perfect, never stained. Emaho!
PAGE 225 COMMENTARY
You who count further! Lines 1-21 describe elaborated's unelaborated external—three making nine, internal four making thirteen, secret four making seventeen, complete four making twenty-one. You count to twenty-one! But numbers multiply. Like branches on a tree—many, but one trunk.
Utterly unelaborated external at lines 23-27—six for hearers, five for pratyekabuddhas eleven, four for bodhisattvas fifteen. You receive according to capacity! But capacity can grow. Like a container—can be enlarged.
Its internal at lines 28-33—nine for kriya twenty-four, nine for upa thirty-three, nine for yoga forty-two. You progress through vehicles! But vehicles are methods. Like different cars—any can reach destination.
Its secret at lines 34-36—twelve for maha fifty-four, six for anu sixty complete. You approach completion! But complete means nothing lacking. Like a full moon—whole, perfect.
Its complete at lines 37-40—four for ati sixty-four, elaborated's thoroughly unelaborated external seventeen, internal six twenty-three, secret six twenty-nine, complete one thirty. You reach sixty-four! But sixty-four is eight squared. Like a mandala—ordered pattern.
PAGE 226 COMMENTARY

Lines 1-40 describe its elaborated external—lama's action student's action two, internal mandala vase two making four, secret mandala's dharma five, vase's five ten, combined fourteen, complete lama speaking name-indication, student generating strength two making sixteen. You receive sixteen! But sixteen is complete. Like sixteen stages—full development.

Lines 8-14 describe its complete—prophecy sense-object verse, non-dual experience awareness object, breath emission clear mind verse, parting grasping birthlessness, praise secret-held markless verse, expanse-awareness non-dual great bliss twelve.

Its utterly unelaborated external at lines 13-19—suitable entry, suitable obtaining two, internal definite conduct, definite view two making four, secret distinguishing families, existing self two making six, complete cause condition two making eight. You distinguish and exist! But existence is self-nature. Like space—exists without effort.
Its thoroughly unelaborated external at lines 21-28—mind abiding, speech abiding two, internal transforming speech, obtaining mind two making four, secret prophesying bliss, secret breath emission two making six, complete abiding elaboration, obtaining own action two making eight. You abide and obtain! But abiding is resting. Like a bird settling—natural state.
Thus unelaborated's elaborated at lines 30-34—sixteen, unelaborated twelve twenty-eight, utterly unelaborated eight thirty-six, thoroughly unelaborated eight forty-four fruits obtained. You obtain forty-four! But fruits are results. Like harvest—comes from cultivation.

[9344-9348] Listen here, practitioner! The great yoga's stages—four of them: very yoga ground, self-ground certain yoga ground, elaboration yoga ground, and action-free complete yoga ground. Do you hear the progression? From certainty in one's own nature, through the play of elaboration, to freedom from doing—these are not sequential achievements but simultaneous aspects of recognition!
[9349-9358] The discriminating yoga ground: sign ground, meaning ground, sign-meaning non-dual ground, unmixed ground—four. The realizing yoga ground: miraculous emanation ground, distinction-realization ground, manifest arising ground, heroic race-distinction ground—four. Combined: sixteen grounds! These aren't rungs on a ladder, dear one—they're facets of a single jewel, viewed from different angles.
[9359-9368] On the first ground, seven controlling miraculous powers arise: emanating body as hundred-thousand; emanating those as hundred-thousand limbs; on one body, emanating hundred-thousand heads; on hundred-thousand bodies, emanating one head; on one head, emanating hundred-thousand different bodies, then emanating from those; emanating countless different heads and limbs on body; emanating in various births—these seven come from realizing the controllable ground. On the second ground, opening one's own belly, showing entrails and heart-lungs to others—this power arises!
Don't chase these powers, dear practitioner! They're signs on the path, not the destination. The real miracle is recognizing what's already here! Emaho!
