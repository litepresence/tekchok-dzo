Ah, you who attain the qualities! Lines 9464-9469 describe through extremely unelaborate—mind purifying, samadhi, awareness, whatever contemplated appears reality, four times one time realizing, death-transition birth knowing.

Those each-and-every at lines 9478-9483—outer appearance quality, inner experience samadhi, secret view-contemplation, complete teaching measure, contaminated not appearing, Buddha ground connect. You connect to ground! But ground is base. Like foundation—supports all.

You who reach the ultimate result! Lines 9484-9495 describe two ultimate result—Lord Vajra-holder ground, body-speech-mind inexhaustible ornament wheel quality complete. You complete the ornament! But ornament is decoration. Like a crown—sign of royalty.
Divided three at lines 9487-9497—body wisdom gather-separate without realm briefly, unimaginable divide extensively, clairvoyance endless control. You control clairvoyance! But endless means unlimited. Like space—no boundaries.
First at lines 9491-9507—empowerment end reach result four signs four measure four twelve, ripen body four sixteen, wisdom four twenty, wisdom light-ray four twenty-four, light emanate emanation four twenty-eight, emanation field four thirty-two ripen benefit. You ripen thirty-two! But thirty-two is complete. Like thirty-two major marks—perfect body.
Wisdom four at lines 9498-9507—basis-abide wisdom, characteristic hold wisdom, all-knowing wisdom, aspect all-knowing wisdom. You know four! But four are aspects. Like four sides of a house—one structure.
[9546-9548] Five perfections. Field and emanation, two—making eight. These are the results of the eight empowerments.
Listen, dear practitioner! Perfection is not something you achieve—it is what you recognize. Five perfections, eight results—all are already present in your own mind.
[9549-9558] The emanation body's teacher, sixth Vajradhara. Abode is Tushita—"Ogmin," different in name only. Teaching is nature Great Perfection. Retinue is worldly and transcendental. Time is when the form-body tames. Field is vast Brahma. From that, emerging clearly: the four continents with Meru, a hundred variations. Dharma taught: actual and reflected images. As what tames whom through emanation—emanation body's self and other's benefit, two perfections, activity, and eight.
[9559-9565] The nature body's teacher: inexpressible, utterly pure. Abode: inexpressible, sign and basis free. Teaching: dust-free, stainless. Retinue: wisdom ocean. Field: great bliss, pure. Dharma: no discrimination. Activity: mind itself transcends mistake—eight.
[9566-9574] The nature of all these, four authentic bodies: The dharmakaya's teacher: nature unaltered. Abode: emptiness, all-pervasive. Teaching: pure taming conduct. Retinue: nature pure. Time: indefinite, various. Dharma: contaminated self-depleted. Through dharma-aggregates gathering—dharmakaya. Activity: acts without self-agent—eight.
[9575-9583] The form-body's teacher: form-appearance without nature, face completely open. Abode: no outer or inner, everywhere inside. Teaching: distinguishes dharma and non-dharma. Retinue: visible and invisible. Time: four concepts, mere words. Field: looking from outside, clear inside. Dharma: concepts basis pure. Through purifying form-atoms and particles—form body. Depleting the karma of those with karma-form—eight.
[9584] Incidentally, the peace body's teacher: self-knowing awareness king, unconditioned, abode citta jewel palace.
Emaho! The kayas are not somewhere else—they are your own body, speech, and mind when recognized!
[9585-9591] What are you looking for, practitioner? The teaching is right here—in the root channels and winds! The retinue is nothing other than five wisdoms, five winds, five prajnas, five lights, five bodies, five families. These aren't separate deities in some pure land! They're your own confusion, recognized. Time? When body and mind gather—that's the moment! Field? Taming the wanderer in your own skull!
[9592-9596] Dharma? Samsara and nirvana—where do you think they are? Activity? Through relying on this, body and mind's suffering pacifies itself—thus called peace body. Liberating from three realms? Eight aspects, but they're all the same liberation wearing different masks!
[9597-9605] Now the wrathful! Five Herukas of wisdom dwell in the blazing skull charnel ground—your brain, that white conch palace! Teaching? Great bliss blazing and flowing! Retinue? The four lamps blazing in your eyes! Time? When wisdom coils into itself! Field? The eye sense power seeing without ceasing! Dharma? Form's suchness—your own face! Activity? Wild in object and consciousness—thus wrathful body! Cutting through those with wrong views—eight!
[9606-9614] Do you see the trick? Peace body, wrathful body—same display, different gate! Five wisdoms, five families—all are your mind's own radiance. Don't chase the peaceful, don't fear the wrathful. Heruka is not somewhere else—he's what looks through your eyes right now! Emaho!
[9623-9631] Thirty-two marks arisen from thirty-two empowerments! Then prajna's seeing purification—six clairvoyances appear! Tamed prajna's seeing purification's six wisdoms arisen—all words' sign-meaning understood! Trained prajna's seeing purification's six clairvoyances—mind itself enters dharmatā specially born! Seeing purification applied to all—heard prajna's six clairvoyances know all sound and meaning! Conceptual prajna's six know all dharmas' aggregates! Meditation-born prajna's six clairvoyances—dharmas and mind mixed, known like space! Thus thirty are from thirty-two empowerments' transformation—Buddha's tamed thirty-two virtues from seeing arise!
[9632-9642] Then wisdom's seeing purification's six clairvoyances appear—at this time, wisdom's eye dust-free and stainless found! Mirror-like wisdom's seeing purification's six clairvoyances—dharmas' characteristics and intent directly known! Equality's six know samsara-nirvana as non-dual! Discriminating's six know six realms' faculties! All-accomplishing's six know all dharmas effort-free and Buddha-fields! Dharmadhātu's six know all Buddha-virtues! Non-abiding wisdom's six know non-abiding in any dharma! Thus thirty-six wisdom clairvoyances from thirty-two empowerments arise!
Do you see? Each empowerment opens an eye—and that eye is already open! Emaho!
[9643-9651] At this time, mind and mental factors cease! Then from first liberation's seeing purification, six clairvoyances arise—body's outflows exhausted! Second liberation's six exhaust speech's outflows! Third's six mind's outflows exhausted! Fourth's six consciousness's outflows exhausted! Fifth's six prajna-aggregate's obscuring outflows exhausted! Sixth's six dharmas and dharmatā's outflows exhausted! These thirty arise from outer-inner-secret complete empowerment!
[9652-9660] Then body-speech-mind's karma manifesting six clairvoyances appear—Buddha's knowing completely perfected! Actual body's seeing purification six arisen, seeing all Buddha-bodies and self-attaining! Body-appearance's six arisen, enjoying infinite light gatherings! Actual speech's six arisen, enjoying sixty speech-tones! Speech-appearance's six, enjoying various sound-tones! Actual mind's six, enjoying all samadhis! Mind-appearance's six, enjoying knowing others' minds! Thus these thirty arise from thirty-two deity recognitions of empowerment!
[9661-9662] Then dharmatā's seeing purification six clairvoyances appear—at this time, dharmatā's intent dwells without division. Do you see? One hundred eighty clairvoyances—and they're all your own face! Emaho!
[9672-9680] Elaboration-having empowerment obtained arises! Its multiplication heard purification clairvoyances also hundred eighty become! These elaboration-without empowerment arise! Conceptual pure hundred eighty transformation-basis meaning knowing! Wisdom pure and experiencing pure hundred eighty nature knowing! Contact pure hundred eighty text knowing! Three sets very elaboration-without empowerment arise!
[9681-9700] Dharmas pure clairvoyances hundred eighty completely elaboration-without empowerment arise! Thus ground joined, ground's virtues two thousand three hundred sixty, wisdom's activity six hundred sixty, dharmas' enumerations three thousand one hundred twenty, Vajradhara's ground clairvoyance's display division great! These empowerment's arrangement, secret mantra vajra vehicle's dharma door first basis important indeed! Citation: Treasury of Supreme Vehicle: "Basis meaning ripening and empowerment's arrangement, Chapter Six!" Thus empowerment door well explained, its location certain samaya, showing that unsurpassed secret mantra door all samaya only important! Establishing three: samaya's nature general, body speech mind's samaya particular, unsurpassed samaya supreme! First samaya's essence, definitive term, division, basis, benefit, fault...
Do you see? Three thousand one hundred twenty—your own face! Emaho!
COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 241
Ah, you who wish to enter the mandala! Listen well. Longchenpa speaks of samaya here, at lines [9704-9710], but do not think this is some external vow to be kept like a merchant's contract. Samaya is the bind that binds nothing—your own mind not breaking itself. You look for something to hold, something to protect, and all the while the vajra cross has always been right here, difficult to grasp because there's nothing to grasp.
At lines [9711-9718], he tells you samaya is breaking free from deception. But what deception? You deceive yourself every moment, taking this moving mind as solid, taking these shifting thoughts as "you." Samaya is simply stopping that deception—recognizing your own mind has never been broken, never needed mending. Like a conch shell that is white inside and out, your nature has never been stained. The stain is the thought that you are stained.
He speaks of root and branch samayas at lines [9719-9727]—twenty-five branches, three roots of body, speech, and mind. You think "I must keep these!" and you make lists, you check them twice like a nervous householder. Foolish! The root samaya is simply this: not abandoning the view, not abandoning your own nature. Everything else grows from that like branches from a living tree. If you cut the root, what use are the branches?
At lines [9745-9756], he speaks of the teacher and the student. You think the teacher is outside you, some glorious being to be worshipped from afar. And you think you are the poor student, lacking, needing. But look—teacher and student are mind's own display, siblings of one vajra family. The teacher appears because of your karma, your connection, your own mind's ripeness. The teacher is your own wisdom appearing in form to meet you. Do you see?
The vajra siblings at lines [9757-9763]—general, close, mixed, extremely mixed—you look for these categories like a scholar counting sand grains. Closer than close! When you enter the mandala together, when you share one vase, one lamp, one empowerment—this is not about the ritual objects. It is your own mind recognizing itself in another. The mandala is not painted on cloth. It is the expanse of your own awareness.
At lines [9764-9765], he warns seven objects become strict. You hear "strict" and you tighten up, you become rigid with rules. But "strict" here means natural, unyielding, like the sky that holds all clouds but is never moved by them. Honor all as teacher—this means do not divide. Do not say "this one is worthy, that one is not." Every appearance is the teacher's face showing you your own mind.
So you ask, "How do I keep samaya?" You keep it by not keeping it. You protect it by not protecting it. Let your mind rest as it is, and samaya keeps itself. This is the great secret Longchenpa points to. Do you understand? Samaya is not a chain to bind you. It is the recognition that you were never bound.
[9766-9773] Four gurus: yourself engaging dharmas' guide-guru, samaya and vows giving empowerment-guru, instructions extracting oral transmission-guru! From that: "To gurus also four purposes: general, guide, samaya empowerment, oral transmission guru."
[9774-9785] Guru and student's definitive term also from that: "Definitive term thus: not knowing, knowing-liberation purpose—learn (*slob*); Great Perfection meaning engaging—guide (*dpon*). Student's definitive term thus: non-distracted manner listening—learn (*slob*); instruction vessel becoming—student (*ma*). Thus meaning-fulfilled guru-student properly dwell equally in the ground. Possessing samaya, it is thus."
Do you see? Guru isn't someone outside—you're both learning and guiding yourself! The student who listens without distraction becomes the vessel. The guru who points to your nature is your own recognition! Emaho!

You think samaya is some pristine thing that once broken, stays broken? Listen to Longchenpa here, at lines [9820-9835]. He speaks of early signs of deterioration—unhappiness arising, diseases, epidemics, spirits and misleaders. You feel these and you panic. "My samaya is broken!" you cry. But look—are these not just mind's own display? Sickness and suffering arise from the thought that something is wrong. The fever is not the problem. The thought "I have a fever and this is bad"—that is the real fever.
At lines [9826-9835], he lists terrible consequences—killing sentient beings, going to hell, losing sight, leprosy, thieves, punishment, death of children and wife, enemies rising. You read this and fear grips your heart. But understand: these are not punishments from some angry deity. These are the natural results of believing in separation, of grasping at self and other. When you break samaya, you break the recognition of your own nature. And when that recognition is lost, of course hell appears! Hell is not a place below the earth. Hell is the mind that grasps at "me" and "mine."
But then, you ask, "Can it be repaired?" At lines [9836-9859], Longchenpa gives you hope. Three methods he teaches. For body deterioration—scripture and ganacakra, three circles correctly done. You think this means elaborate rituals, expensive offerings. Foolish! The scripture is the recognition of your own nature. The ganacakra is feeding all beings with the understanding that they are not separate from you. The three circles—doer, deed, and done-to—are empty from the start. To "correctly do" means to do without the doer.
For speech deterioration at lines [9843-9849]—lamp rituals, confess-repair recitations. You want to chant a hundred times and be free. But speech is purified when you recognize that the words you speak are empty resounding, like an echo in a valley. Who is confessing? What is there to repair? The confession itself dissolves when you see the confessor has no substance.
And for mind deterioration at lines [9850-9859]—offer substance to the teacher, offer wealth-accumulation. You think this means gold and silver, horses and cattle. No! Offer your thoughts. Offer your grasping. Offer the very mind that thinks "I need to offer." When you offer everything, what remains? That remainder is the dharmakaya, and that is the only offering worth making.
At lines [9860-9866], he speaks of the protection method. Fault and quality seen with mindfulness and awareness, pure continuum bound. You hear "bind" and you want to tie something up. But this binding is like binding space with space. Mindfulness is not remembering. It is not forgetting. Awareness is not watching. It is the natural clarity that has always been present. Samaya is protected when you do not protect it, when you let it be as it is for even one aeon without abandoning it—meaning, without abandoning your own nature.
At lines [9867-9871], he says the student should protect what they do not know. You think this means blind faith. No! It means protect the not-knowing itself. Do not cover it with concepts. Let the not-knowing be naked, and in that nakedness, wisdom appears. The teacher's command is not an order from outside. It is your own deepest nature calling you home. Will you listen?
[9872-9878] Listen here, practitioner! Knowing empowerment and oral instruction's occasion, knowing view as vast, knowing meditation's continuity great, knowing dharmatā profound, knowing samsara as unmixed, knowing abiding in passed grounds, knowing individual and general dharma and dharmi's characteristics—this is how you hold samaya!
[9879-9885] Also from that: "This is protection method: knowing one distinction's distinction, superior protection through ten distinctions, less from that one. Samaya king engages thus." Do you see? One knowing becomes ten, ten protect the one. Don't count—recognize!
[9886-9896] Now body-speech-mind samaya specifically explained. From *Thal-'gyur*: "Empowerment-depending samaya explained; though particular expressions hard to fathom, summarized: body, speech, mind—yoga body-speech-mind applied. Object guru vajra sibling; protection sphere distinguishes; commitment body and empowerment gathered; vajra secret place held."
[9897-9921] Body samaya—outer, inner, secret. Not giving outer, not taking inner, not killing secret. Each has its sphere. Repair with clay images, painted deities—seven. Why seven? Complete number to turn the wheel. Guru's shadow—don't step over, don't stretch legs toward, don't show back. Not etiquette—training in non-grasping! Vajra siblings—strike them and you've struck yourself. Damage travels.
Emaho! Samaya is your own mind's protection!
[9922-9935] Thus inner experience, inner deity's seven custom bodies! Secret vajra bell seven or eleven to guru offered repaired! From that: "Outer inner custom body seven, supreme establishment effort arose, supreme guru to offer! Outer secret signs arisen, vajra and bell nine or eleven to guru! By that disease liberation, desire complete, virtue peace deed accomplished, beings kind become!"
[9936-9951] Body's outer inner secret three: *gSer gyi khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*: "Inner outer siblings and, who father and mother, self body not disparage! Inner inner general, Mahayana Hinayana dharmas, entering wish and entered, entered form-reflection held body, disparage high disparage ornament disparage, Buddha all hundred deceived! Inner secret self body, deity's mandala because! Medicine food poison-mixed ate! If weapon stabbed also, outflow path not body hundred!
Do you see? Your body is the mandala—don't defile it! Emaho!
Do you see? Your words become your body in future lives! Guard your speech! Emaho!
