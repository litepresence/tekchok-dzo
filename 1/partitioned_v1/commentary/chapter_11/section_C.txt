Do you see, practitioner? Every poison has its channel! Hatred, desire, delusion—all mapped in your body! But who maps? No mapper! Just wisdom playing at being confusion! Cut through the map and find what was never lost! Emaho!
[15183-15194] From that: bliss wheel's channels—these are outer limbs! Wheel stages possessed, outside stages right side: white conch spiral color similar, crown Brahma's aperture, lotus-like great channel, ba-men horn-like channel! From these two, branches six-fold divided!
[15195-15207] From that cakra's left side, transforming aspect: lotus-like right-left, two channels exist! From these spreading: ear's upper four finger-widths, right-left two each four!

Desire-aggregate, delusion, hatred—from these they transform! Those characteristics—each also three-three! Sphere, heat, dwelling...
Do you see, practitioner? Your tongue alone holds sixty channels! Sixty doorways to recognition! Every taste, every speech, every breath—channels dancing their dance! Don't let this knowledge become mere counting! Each number is a finger pointing—follow it to your own face! Emaho!

Your skull alone holds sixteen vital points! Sixteen doorways to recognition! Don't cut with knives—cut with awareness! Emaho!
[15723-15750] Look here, practitioner! The year has twelve months, and in each the elements play their game. The sun's southern journey brings longer days, the northern return brings longer nights. Six hundred seventy-five winds increase and decrease with each water-clock measure—this is the breath of the world itself! Listen to the numbers: a day has eight watches, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts. Each shift holds 1,350 winds, each finger 338 and one-half plus eight movements, each watch 2,700 movements. Twelve element actions multiply twelve times twelve—this shows how twelve winds develop and decrease. The White Lotus commentary reveals: when the sun travels south, add and subtract time accordingly. Two water-clock measures change each month as the sun moves. When going south, day lengthens and night shortens; when reversed, day shortens and night lengthens. This is not mere calculation—this is the rhythm of your own life-force! The breath moving 675 times with each water-clock measure reveals the secret of longevity and health. Understand these movements, and you understand the deterioration and renewal of the elements within. This knowledge is the physician's wisdom, the yogin's clock, the key to mastering the body's inner winds. Practice with this understanding, and the channels open, the winds flow freely, and the mind settles into natural luminosity. Do not ignore these teachings as mere technical details—they are the very structure of existence itself!
[15446-15455] Wind good food and good alcohol, men left lower inserted, lying experience! Women right lower inserted, lying makes channels individual's change vital-point! That channels leap and rise coming, blazing fierce ones, vulture fire channel gentle! Hand's ring finger, right's leaping channel all fierce pressing, first slightly then fierce fierce pressing, wind inside gathered, again fierce outer, again fierce inner inhale!
[15456-15475] Thus done, awareness exhausted gone, rise, throat right twisted, armpit right shoulder upper placed, hand right throat outer, leaping channel weak upward moving one exists, that first seven beans' weight pressing! Then gradually fierce fourteen twenty-one weight pressing, first mist becomes, karma and afflictions' channels abandoning experience! Then dawn-clear appearance comes, wisdom's seeing self-nature sphere! Then turbulence appearance, wisdom purification path manifest experience! Thus change time, occasion guru supplicate, path appropriate! Thus not done, wind life channel lost, awareness roaring may come!
[15470-15475] Then session divided long done, great luminosity experience with dawns! Thus always done body light touch experience becomes, channel's sphere emptiness from, butter and gugul mixed massage! Mind's conception various all cease, great luminosity experience dwells, great wisdom's thigle vital-point reached!
Emaho! The fierce pressing reveals your face!
[15476-15482] Listen, dear practitioner! At this time, place the mind into the net of four arisings—draw the wind inward, this is the oral instruction! Here, bliss arises, arises, stabilizes, special wisdom path obtained and so forth arises—from the effort stage.
[15483-15494] For women, do from the left. Relying on the channel location, taking into experience: pressing, holding, drawing, squeezing, binding, draining, hiding—these should be known. Hiding is ro ma's key point. Binding is rkyang ma's key point. Kun 'dar ma draining key point.
[15495-15502] Pressing minor channels, making into body's key point. Speech's key point, mind's key point. Dharmata arising, time holding. The certainty is no certainty. The no-certainty is your own face.
Do you see? You are trying too hard! Press, hold, draw—this is the path of effort. But recognize: the certainty you seek is no certainty! Stop grasping for results and recognize what is already present!
Emaho! No certainty is the supreme certainty!
[15520-15544] Merit, enjoyment, power, flourishing and decay—analyzing these, become skilled in elements' calculation's dependent origination! Also four wheels' time particularities: spring producing, summer memory, autumn tastes, winter peak wheel! Body, speech, mind, and consciousness indivisibly trained!
Producing body confusion-wheel, memory speech, tastes mind, peak consciousness wheel applied! Producing first wheel's center letter A depending, different latencies emptied, dharmatā mode applied! Memory Aṃ letter depending, dharmatā mode applied! Tastes Hūṃ depending, dream dharmatā mode applied! Peak center Ha depending, samadhi dharmatā mode applied! Thus four conjunctions' first, different conceptions hidden time, skilled in wind and... Second, delusion memory-less hidden. Third, latencies earlier-later self-pure hidden. Fourth, joy-bliss grasping-free self-liberated hidden—six beings' karma and latencies continuum severed!
Do you see? The seasons turn your wheels, practitioner! Emaho!
[15563-15569] Individual karma's particularities, karma and wisdom two, afflictions and non-conception—each's number and measure held, practitioner distinguishes! That says individual wind measure obtained!
[15570-15586] Establishing that meaning three: change certainty place generally shown, transference certainty place specifically explained, wisdom and karma wind certainty conclusion. First: generally body channels dwell, channels wind dwells, wind's change great-small two! Outer and inner change! Great changing wind: youthful prime, disease-free one, day night one, wind twenty-one thousand six hundred outside-inside change certain! Particularly, not mouth nose, channels inside conception and wisdom's support small changing wind leap channel from change—hundred-thousand twelve thousand six hundred inside change! These times: right nostril moving male wind, left female, equal moving neuter wind!
Do you see? Twenty-one thousand breaths daily—all your confusion! Emaho!
[15607-15621] Time four sequence, winter ice-floe, spring seed, summer spark, autumn flower. Fire-wind life, water-wind life, earth-wind life, wind-wind life. Day fire-wind, night water-wind, inside earth, dusk wind. Fire-wind bile disease, water phlegm, wind wind-disease, earth ldan.
[15622-15648] Ldan pa disease two gather, 'du ba third gather. Water wind impure purify, earth blood flesh pure impure. Water fire block separate, water water saliva eye-water. Earth earth flesh, fat bone marrow bodhicitta. Earth water thig-le, mercury son, rta-rnga knot daughter, eye-corner son ripen. Earth fire heat, vessel object 'phar shib, birth aging disease death. Earth wind strength complexion.
All these elements—who binds them? The unbound has no elements.
[15649-15668] Listen here, dear practitioner! The fire channel-wind causes steaming, and from this ripening come the changes of bodhicitta—contracting, dripping, scattering, drawing. These four create impotence in men, constant numbness, untimely seed emission, and dysfunction with objects. In women, menstrual blood not descending becomes disease, untimely emission, or monthly occasional emission. When the second and third days of the waxing moon see stainless menstrual emission, this benefits male children. When it descends at the fifteenth lunar mandala and so on, this benefits females. When it constantly descends in the waning moon, both male and female children ripen as twins. If menstrual flow is heavy with much blood, or constantly flows on the twenty-second or fifth, no children will arise at all!
[15668-15686] The earth wind generates faculties and faculty-supports, producing much karma and conception. The wind fire creates awareness-power—light, heavy, blazing, roaring, full, and empty. The wind wind moves breath outside and inside. In women when sons and daughters are conceived, it creates eye disease; in men, it creates alcohol disease. The water of wind stops conception and makes non-conception. The earth wind draws and gathers the limbs. The fire wind makes affliction-power various. When wind wind and fire mix, they create various wisdom-powers—marvelous example discrimination, skill in dharma word-meaning, skill in cooking for women, and skill in body-speech transformations. The birth order of four elements changes through the actions of summer, winter, autumn, and spring—the element ranks shift, creating disease!
Emaho! See how the elements dance in your very body!
[15687-15723] Listen, dear practitioner! Feel the heat in your body, understand death's approach, observe the differences in the actions of body, speech, and mind. These are not random occurrences—they follow the deterioration of elements! Look: the elements deteriorate in sequence, reverse, make effort, and change. When moving, they deteriorate; when reversing, they transform; when making effort, they persist; when changing, they evolve. Past time, if long, changes and removes; future time, if long, shifts and transforms. The present, brief as it is, shows through action and counting of change. One youth moves 21,600 winds in a single day—measure this with water-clock and finger-counts! Eight watches in a day, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts. Each shift: 1,350 winds. Each finger: 338 and a half plus eight-eight movements. Each watch: 2,700 movements. Twelve element-actions create 144 permutations, showing twelve winds developing and decreasing. The sun moves south past Meru, making days long and nights short; reversed, days shorten and nights lengthen. The White Lotus commentary teaches: when going south, add and subtract. Two water-clock measures change each month. Six hundred seventy-five wind movements increase and decrease with each measure. This is the body-clock, the breath-timer, the secret of elemental balance! Understand this, and you hold the key to the body's wisdom winds. Practice with precision, and the channels open like flowers to the sun!
[15724-15732] Three hundred sixty days, seven hundred twenty meals calculated! One day twelve times calculated: thousand nine hundred thirty-two and a half conception adventitious change; thousand nine hundred twenty-eight wisdom pure measure moving wind held! Thus five day, five night, two midnight—twelve parts calculated! This day-night equal time calculated! Autumn-spring two equal times certainly hold!
[15733-15748] Moon itself increase-decrease calculation: moon female and male difference! Moon female six, twenty-nine days not more; male six, thirty complete! One year six days lacking! Thus moon controlled! Autumn-spring two middle day-night equal—remainder half and three extra fraction known! Vinaya also: sojong able-unable calculated! Thus wind calculation certainly obtained—outer year and month connected, day time divided, known! Its object summer-winter-autumn-spring four, moon twelve dawns, that confusion-wheel not reversed, all appearances certainly obtained! Also *Thal-'gyur*: "Day thirteen also, months are one! Thus twelve complete, year is one!"
Do you see? Time itself is wind-play, practitioner! Emaho!
