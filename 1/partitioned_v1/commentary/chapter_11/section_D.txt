Space pure lamp light form arise-produce gather.
The gathering and non-gathering are the same. Your own face is the gathering.
[16214-16235] Listen well, practitioner! Look at your own mind—desire, dullness, hatred, attachment, clinging, ignorance—these arise from causes and conditions, essence and particulars. The moving mind, grasping and holding, chases past, future, and present like a dog chasing its tail. This movement creates samsara's karma, maturation, and results! Mindfulness and latent tendencies—various causes and conditions, many actions—thus we label mind. Some say mind is one, enough with that label; others say divisions are improper. Call it mental events, gather as one—enough! Fifty-one divisions, not improper, all equal. Division and gathering depend on parts, no contradiction. [16236-16255] Now hear the wondrous! The lamp of pure space, completely pure—this is your own nature! Light and form arise from gathering, five colors pervading, dark-blue, unchanging, surrounded by vajra fence, grasped by vajra chain with no place to escape. Inside, light-forms emanate rays—this very bardo of dharmata, cut through it and perfect buddhahood manifests! Light appears upward-standing, side-arising, rim-appearing—delusion self-ceases, wisdom clears! From these, light layers, fragments, partial breaks appear, outer and inner space mix, wisdom with no interval. Eye-webs, eye-many, eye-lines, nets, half-nets, flowers, thousand-petaled lotus, house-fire, tent-house under thatch—these appear as reality's display, made into the path! Four lamps determine the four path-appearances' measure. With the snare of distance, see dharmata directly, reverse from holding philosophical positions. Look! This is the direct path, the immediate recognition!
[16256-16258] Look here, practitioner! The empty bindu experiences increasing visions—seeing bliss self-held in awareness, mind turns back from that appearance! Completely pure expanse—seeing awareness reach full measure, mind turns back from impure confused appearance! Self-arisen prajna—seeing exhaustion appearance, mind turns back from grasping body and wisdom!
[16259-16263] Now the four lamps explained individually: Far-reaching water lamp, empty bindu lamp, completely pure expanse lamp, self-arisen prajna lamp. These four are not separate practices—they're four aspects of what you already see!
[16264-16280] First, nine aspects: essence, definitive term, division, characteristic, its location, how produced, appearing door-appearance, simile, measure determination. First, water lamp's essence: holding the aspect of both samsara-nirvana, the clear support of seeing pure appearance and confused appearance, and the light-channel depending on it. From the *Rin po che'i sgron ma 'bar ba* tantra: "Far-reaching water lamp's essence gathers both appearances; because seeing-holder grasping aspect not ceased, through holding both aspects..."
Do you see? These lamps are your eyes, practitioner! Not something to achieve. Turn back from grasping at what you see, and the lamp is already blazing! Emaho!

[16601-16609] Listen! From the center of the eye's essence, generally the four lamps appear. Particularly, the empty bindu lamp with self-light appears. From that: "Eyes of beings unobscured by conditions, through the door called cakṣu, like the sun's mandala, self-light and rays, appear as self-possessions."
[16610-16618] Generally, from the right eye—distance-snare and prajna two. From the left—bindu and dharmadhatu two. At the Brahma aperture, awareness body lamp blazes in manner. From Jewel Garland: "Beings' path is the seeing door. That itself, right two, left two, center—lamp blazing manner dwells."
[16619-16620] Seventh, nature: From the nature of original kadag, clear light lhungrub bindu empty appears like a water-moon.
