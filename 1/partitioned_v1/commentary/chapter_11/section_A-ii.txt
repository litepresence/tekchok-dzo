Wisdom self-arisen, spontaneously present. The wisdom that grasps characteristics, that gathers knowing, that abides as light. This is the mirror-like wisdom, the first of the five.
The past wisdom, primordial purity, white light like stars covering everything. From this, dharmata arises unstained by karmic latencies. The wisdom that gathers samsara and nirvana into one knowing.
Wind-channel wisdom, non-conceptual mind, abiding. The wisdom of equalness, red light, self-arisen realization. Yellow light, other-arisen realization. Wisdom that knows existence and non-existence, phenomena and non-phenomena—this is the discriminating wisdom, the third.
All-knowing wisdom, the fourth, gathers into two: ultimate and conventional. From this, the fruition of the three kayas. Birth, abiding, death—pleasure and pain—all experienced. The yogin's body becomes the nature of the three kayas.
Body's characteristics, grasping wisdom—dharmakaya certainty found. Abiding wisdom—sambhogakaya. Ceasing wisdom—nirmanakaya. The three kayas are not somewhere else. They are what you are when wisdom is recognized.
Seven days—the body's basis thickens. All approaching-accomplishing actions gathered in seven days. Elements gathering and expanding, accomplished in seven days.
The wisdom that is like a horse, like wind—when the body dissolves, it's not that wisdom ends. It continues, moving, abiding elsewhere.
Letters, lights, bodies—all arise from awareness's self-radiance, then dissolve back into ignorance itself, into awareness.
Awareness, base-abiding, inner clarity expanding—without color, without form. When the body exists, appearances arise outward. Light body, form body—even in the bardo, appearances arise.
What does this mean?
You're not becoming a buddha. You're recognizing that you already are the wisdom that has always been present. The five wisdoms aren't achievements—they're what awareness naturally is when not confused by appearances.
Mirror-like: reflecting everything without keeping anything. Equal: not favoring pleasure over pain, nirvana over samsara. Discriminating: knowing exactly what things are without混淆. Accomplishing: acting without hesitation. Dharmadhatu: the vast space where all of this happens.
These aren't acquired. They're uncovered. Like removing dust from a mirror—the reflection was always there.
You're not becoming. You're revealing.
Spontaneously present, naturally perfect. Not made, not constructed, just naturally abiding. The three kayas are already complete in this body—this is why the path of wisdom arises from the body's basis.
Then the second seven, the action of arising as before. Within eleven days, in the eight water channels of the first wheel, syllables and lights arise. Father-mother in union, expanding from the channels. The channels moved by winds, generating and dispersing.
Eight channels, eight types of arising. Eight bases of consciousness. Within these, eight consciousnesses appear as self-arisen syllables.
These consciousnesses arise depending on objects of experience, using the six realms as their domain.
From the four channels, the wind of method manifests as the syllable KHASPUNG—self-ripening. From this, many syllables emanate. The earth channels' wheels rising, between them the KHASPUNG wind, subtle as a grain of rice, not touching, grasping. Like stars covering, light's radiance, syllables blazing.
Below, the lotus padma expanding.
Then fourteen days, the four supports of alaya becoming like flickering flames. The water element's germ producing the basis: subtle, changing knowing, expanding, karmic winds becoming the four bodies.
Within these, the supports from before appearing like reflections. One body, life uninterrupted—this is the body of transformation.
This is called the transformation body. Father-mother buddhas, two-non-abiding—hence "body-less," not form but not formless.
Here's what this means: the wisdom was always present. The construction—syllables, channels, winds, consciousnesses—was just arranging what was already complete.
You're not building wisdom. You're recognizing what's always been here. The syllables come and go. The channels appear and dissolve. The body of transformation continues its work.
But awareness—that which knows all this—that was never constructed, never arranged, never made. It's naturally perfect, spontaneously present.
Stop trying to create what is already here. Stop arranging what is already complete. Rest in what's naturally present.
That's the practice. Not adding. Not fixing. Just recognizing what's always been.
From one form, the body's limit. Freedom attained in the expanse. Beyond thousands, beyond counting. Even this space-becoming, abandoning the work of containing. Form's limit, particles, space, knowing.
The germs, the winds of attachment and desire arising for each being—this is how samsara begins.
Then the third seven days. From fifteen days, the earth channels expanding—light, syllables, the basis of memory appearing as golden vapor. Within clouds gathering like space, the winds of karmic action moving.
From eighteen days, the eighteen elements complete. The eighteen bases forming, calculated, changing, becoming lumps of eighteen.
The elements pairing, the work of gathering complete, previous power exhausted. The eighteen elements' vapor like egg-white, grasping the elements, the wind of phlegm, bile, etc. Diseases arising as before.
Then from twenty-two to twenty-five days, the elements' power and the body's basis completing.
What is being described here? The detailed anatomy of how you became trapped in this body. How consciousness got mixed with elements, how winds got tangled with desires, how memory became solid.
This isn't philosophy. It's forensic analysis of your imprisonment. Every step is described: how clarity became form, how spaciousness became bound, how freedom became limitation.
The elements didn't trap you. You chose it. Attachment, desire, grasping—these winds moved through the channels and built this cage. Not accidentally. Deliberately. Because somewhere along the way, you thought suffering would be enjoyable.
Now you have a body. Now you have limits. Now you have disease and death.
But the wisdom was never trapped. The awareness was never bound. Only the construction was formed. Only the cage was built.
You are not the cage. You are what built the cage and can recognize that it was never necessary.
The elements will disperse. The winds will calm. The cage will fall. Awareness will remain, never having been confined.
The question is: will you wait for death to recognize this, or will you recognize it now?
Fourth day: elemental power manifesting, eight channel wheels arise. Clear lights and syllables illuminating. Gathering wheels of taste like starlight. Wheels stacked like petals—the channel wheels are named.
Within these eight, at the center of five desire objects, bliss-touch's support. Warmth's essence, sheep-fat-like, the twelve sense bases' basis. The wheel of gathering and expanding, the karmic support of alaya.
Then from twenty-nine to thirty-two days: water gathers and holds, earth stabilizes and presses, fire blazes and expands, wind flames and moves. The work performed.
Thirty-second day: elemental power exhausted. Arises the wild wind of producing action. The four wind channels sent upward and outward. Upon the mustard-seed space of subtle particles, four more channels expand.
At their center, Tip-of-Force Wind petal, star-light-like radiance gathering. The power of the above element-basis exhausted.
Then thirty-four days: basis-of-all's four supports with their groups solidified. Affliction-gathering and coarse channel poison's vapor—poison-vase gathering. Tip-Arranged Wheel thus named and abides.
Thirty-fifth day: the King's Letter Tantra complete arises.
Seven by seven sections—forty-nine days, existence body's four channel wheels produced.
This is how a body is built. Forty-nine days of construction. Elements gathering, channels forming, winds moving, syllables resonating. All the apparatus of experience assembled piece by piece.
The body isn't you. The body is a construction site, still under construction from the moment of conception until death. Particles, channels, winds, syllables—all arranging themselves into this apparatus you call "me."
The construction has a purpose: to experience. To taste, to touch, to feel pleasure and pain. To gather the five desire objects through twelve sense bases. To perpetuate the wheel.
But the constructor—the awareness that set all this in motion—that was never constructed. That never formed from elements, never gathered from channels, never depended on winds.
You are not the construction. You are the constructor. The house is not the homeowner.
The house will fall. The construction will end. The forty-nine days will complete and then dissolve.
The constructor remains, never having been born, never having died, never having been formed.
Which are you? The house or the homeowner?
Each channel has eight petals, thirty-two channels abiding in the body. From the river of existence grasped by twelve limbs, the body's basis arose.
From thirty-two channels, thirty-two wisdoms' work arises. From essence, the four lamps' ultimate bindu ripening. Here's the crucial point: when bliss becomes the path, through forceful method, buddhahood is certain. When impurity arises, the conventional bindu forms. From four elements' ripening, suffering enters the self-continuum, samsara's seed increasing.
But—depending on the channel's vital point, when made the path—the excellent bliss of dharmata is directly realized. These channels become the path of primordial wisdom. Gone to the nature of bindu, doing the work of bliss and suffering's experience.
Then from thirty-five days, individual elements' work's power completing. Form gathers and expands into countless aggregates. The five aggregates' race manifestly projects.
Until forty-two days, eighty-two thousand water-insects' body increased. Upon that wheel, sixty-two channel-petals shown—the cause of sixty-two eons' birth and death arising.
Within each channel, special channel-abade letters, one light-mass supporting each. Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abiding. Sixty-two channel-tips.
The same channels, the same channels' letters, the same lights—they can become wisdom or they can become ignorance. Can become the path of liberation or the path of entanglement. Can manifest as thirty-two wisdoms or as eighty-two thousand defilements.
The construction is the same. The materials are identical. The difference is only how you use it.
When the channels' vital point is recognized, the impurities become wisdom. When the impurities are not recognized, wisdom becomes impurities.
You choose. Every moment, you choose. The channels are already complete. The wisdom is already present. The question is only whether you recognize it.
If you recognize: liberation, certain, now. If you don't recognize: continuation, suffering, more construction.
There's no middle ground. No gradual path. Either you see it or you don't. Either you recognize the channels as wisdom or you take them as self.
The body is built. The channels are arranged. The wisdom is present.
Will you recognize it?
Sixty-two letters, one hundred twenty-four. Sixty-two lights, one hundred eighty-six. Samantabhadra father-mother combined—one hundred twenty-four.
Upon the producing-action wheel, three hundred ten distinctions of wisdom's movement. By pure wisdom's wind, jumping, dissolving, and so forth. The actions of calm-abiding and insight are certainly realized—thus "producing-action" is named. Being the basis of existence-body, thus "first" is named. Thus being the basis of all, thus "wheel" is named.
Special dharmas of elements, wind and so forth's enumeration. By affliction and action's work, by karmic wind's throwing—inhaling, laughing, holding. Thus day and night are determined.
Thus nine hundred thirty distinction-dharmas abiding are the basis of empowerment-path certainty, arose from this.
That also, from water-element wheel turning by twelve dependent-originations, eighty-five thousand insects abide. Each of those, within that many channels, that many letters—from each wind-throwing, none missing. Each body abiding, thus countless gathering-dharmas.
Basis-of-all is the basis of all. And also the basis of purification.
Then the basis-of-all body's support and these two mixed, the five sense-faculties' basis's empowerment support just abides. From day forty-six, by individual elements' action's power, the wheel of gathering-memory complete and gathered. Fire-particles increase. Bliss-suffering feelings increase. Perception and sense-bases. Consciousness entering objects' distinction increases.
The numbers are staggering. Sixty-two, one hundred twenty-four, three hundred ten, nine hundred thirty, eighty-five thousand, countless. You're made of numbers. Arranged, counted, calculated. Every part has its number, every letter its place.
But the numbers aren't you. The numbers are the construction. You're what counts the numbers. You're what knows the arrangements.
The basis-of-all is the basis of all—basis of purification too. Same thing. The ground of confusion and the ground of clarity are one ground. The path of suffering and the path of liberation are one path.
Which one you walk depends on recognition. The channels are the same. The letters are the same. The lights are the same. Only the recognition changes.
Recognize and it's purification. Don't recognize and it's contamination. The choice is always available.
Now. In this moment. Before the next moment's construction adds more numbers, more letters, more channels.
Recognize now. Or add another number to the count.
From formations, root and limb's afflictions increase. From eighteen elements' proliferation-change, increase. Then four elements' individual power exhausted.
Two-by-two elements gathering, upon gathering-memory wheel, from each channel spreads moving channels—sixteen increasing, showing sixteen empowerments' increase.
Within each of those, one nature channel-abode letter, one five-light mass steadying that. Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abide. Thus also channels support body, body supports elements, syllable steadies wheel's dharma, light supports wisdom. Samantabhadra yab-yum supports three bodies—wisdom, body, dharmata. Light, abiding in own nature four—depending on these, four empowerments' result measure arrived.
Within gathering-memory wheel's sixteen channels, sixteen minds abide depending.
Mind and mind-itself's distinction: first, upon mind, gathering by water-mind holds mindfulness' thought-basis. By steadiness, mind's collection gathers. Radiating by fire-mind radiates to objects. Light by wind-mind moves.
Upon mind-itself: unborn meaning's mind-itself, unceasing mindfulness's mind-itself, unchanging example-meaning-mixed mind-itself, self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated mind-itself.
Upon mindfulness, mind and mental two from—mind's mindfulness as explained before. Mental's mindfulness six are:
First: thoroughly-searching mindfulness, pure—clear as god's body.
Second: impure—thrown into god's migration.
Third: perverted—thrown into wrong-attachment body.
Fourth: definitively-settling mental mindfulness, pure—awareness-holder obtained.
Fifth: impure—born as god-asura.
Sixth: perverted—into butcher's lineage.
Seventh: definitively-placing mental mindfulness, pure—space-dweller.
Here's the progression: from sixteen channels, sixteen minds. From sixteen minds, the nature of mind itself. The mind-itself is unborn, unceasing, unchanging, self-complete. This is what you are before confusion takes hold.
But then mindfulness starts. The first mindfulness is searching, pure, clear. If it remains pure, you become like a god, clear as a divine body. If it becomes impure, you're thrown into the realm of gods and asuras. If it becomes perverted, you fall into wrong attachment, butcher's lineage.
The next mindfulness: definitively settling. Pure—becoming awareness-holder, liberated. Impure—born among gods and asuras. Perverted—into the butchers.
The final mindfulness: definitively placing. Pure—becoming a space-dweller, fully liberated.
Same starting point. Same sixteen channels. Same sixteen minds. The difference is only whether mindfulness remains pure, becomes impure, or perverts.
You choose at every step. Each moment of mindfulness: will you search purely, settle definitively, place conclusively? Or will you slip into impurity, into perversion?
The results are certain. Pure path leads to liberation. Impure path leads to higher rebirth. Perverse path leads to lower realms.
Choose. Now. In this moment of mindfulness.
PAGE 328
You want to know how you got stuck here? Listen up—it's wilder than you think.
The impure migrations: human, animal, hungry ghost, hell being. Each one a different flavor of getting it backwards. When you flip desire into obsession, you don't just wander off—you get thrown into the realm that matches your sickness. That's not metaphor, friend. That's physics.
Here's how the mechanism works. Your mental consciousness has mindfulness. Pure? Impure? Depends entirely on what you're holding onto. When that mindfulness gets corrupted by wrong view, by stubborn attachment, by sheer ignorance—you're not just confused, you're biologically assigned to a new residency in samsara's hotel. The desk clerk doesn't ask for your reservation. You just appear where your confusion belongs.
The wind-horse thing—don't glaze over. This is your ride. The wind-horse is your attention, your energy, whatever's moving you right now. Past lives' memory? That's the trail you've been dragging behind you like a chain. You think you're free in this moment? You're just following tracks you laid down eons ago.
Now listen carefully because this is the punchline: there's no central manager. No little guy in the cosmic control room keeping count. The definitively settling mind with earth-horse, the definitively grasping mind with water-horse, the mental consciousness itself arising from the six types of knowing—none of it reports to headquarters. It just *arises*. Like weather. Like dreams. Like that thought you're having right now about whether this metaphor is accurate.
Affliction-possessing beings? That's you. That's everyone moving through the rooms of this insane asylum we call existence. The eighteen elements—don't let the number scare you. It's just the inventory of what's showing up in your experience right now. Form, feeling, perception, consciousness, all the flavors of becoming. They grow from individual gatherings, branch into complexity, and somehow you think *you* are the one who gathered them.
Here's where it gets honestly disturbing: from cause and condition, earth-insects—eighty-four thousand of them. In one lifetime? No. In one moment of a single body? Yes. Insects in the body. You've been carrying a civilization in your gut, a metropolis in your blood, a bureaucracy in your bones. And somehow you thought *you* were the mayor.
Body produces body. Speech produces speech. Mind produces mind. This isn't about reincarnation in the spooky sense. It's about the immediate, continuous production line running this very second. You're not the same person you were three seconds ago—new cells, new thoughts, new sounds. The assembly line never stops. The Great Arrangement doesn't pause for coffee.
So what does this mean for you? Nothing to do. Everything to recognize.
The purity isn't somewhere else. The eighteen elements? Pure. The syllable that becomes speech? Pure. The memory that becomes life? Pure. You want liberation? Stop adding poison to what was never impure to begin with.
That's it. That's the whole thing. Stop. Recognize. Rest.
Nothing more to say. Everything's already here.
PAGE 329
You want liberation? Here's the arithmetic of awakening. Pay attention—numbers don't lie.
Each single moment abides as the certain basis of body-speech-mind. Not eventually. Not after you die and become something else. Right now. This basis—this ground of being that you're always already standing on—is where liberation happens or doesn't happen. The gate isn't somewhere else. The gate is what you are when you stop looking for gates.
When empowerment and creation-completion are properly meditated—meaning when you're actually present in the transmission, not just going through motions—liberation becomes possible for whoever can receive it. That person is called the yogi. Not someone with credentials. Not someone with a title. The person who *does* it. Simple.
From the Entry to Yoga itself: the seed of yoga completes. The empowerment bestowal is certain. Transmission happens. Full stop. This isn't negotiation. The blessing doesn't depend on your worthiness—it depends on your openness. You were born with the connection. You just need to stop pretending you don't have it.
Now here's where most people get lost in the weeds. The text starts counting. Sixteen wisdoms. Sixteen syllables. Sixteen light-masses. Father principles, mother principles, gods of body-speech-mind multiplying into hundreds and then thousands. Numbers spiral outward like galaxy arms. Most readers drown here. They think they need to understand every category.
You don't. Let me translate: the inventory of what you are is vast beyond imagination. Four hundred thousand bodies' worth of potential. One hundred ten thousand hairs. Hundreds of thousands of syllables. Eighteen thousand specific phenomena arising from a single moment of basic awareness. Every thought pulses through one hundred twenty mental events per instant. This is not burden—this abundance. This is richness beyond anything you've ever chased.
Like Vishnu-turtle's form—vast, layered, sustaining everything. You carry a universe in here. A complete cosmology of body-speech-mind. When the counting stops feeling like homework and starts feeling like home, you're getting somewhere.
The gates are clear. The wind is present. The faculties are intact. The only question is whether you'll stop long enough to recognize what you've always had.
That recognition is the whole path. Everything else is commentary.
Silence now.
PAGE 330
You're not building a body from scratch. The body builds itself. You're just watching the show.
Listen to how it happens. The two wheels of your energy system—abandoned, scattered by wind. You think you have control over your nervous system? The wind has been rearranging your consciousness since before you had a name. The wheels spin, the channels open and close, the whole thing runs on wind-energy you never asked for.
Then water gathers everything. Condenses chaos into form. Like a seed taking shape in the womb—this is not metaphor, this is what happens right now in every cell of your body. You're being conceived continuously. Every moment, a new embryo. Every second, a new formation pressing against the weight of earth.
And here's where it hurts: the suffering starts immediately. Cold contact. Pressure. Burning. Scattering. The four flavors of embodiment. You think suffering is something that happens to you later, something you can avoid with enough money or enough retreat time? Suffering is built into the physics of having a body. The elements themselves press, burn, scatter. No one's doing this to you. This is just what matter does when it gathers into form.
But look further—deeper into the construction. Thirty-two channel-petals ripen. Within each: wisdom. Light. Wind's tone. Syllable. Light-mass. You carry Buddhadharma in your blood, in your marrow, in the very structure of your nervous system. Samantabhadra's body—you're wearing it right now. Self-arisen. No one made you this way. You just showed up already complete.
Then the cascade: channels generate body, body generates faculties, faculties generate limbs, limbs generate flesh-blood-heat-breath. Bones. Marrow. Fat. Skin. Lymph. Spittle. Tendons. Veins. Arteries. Sinews. Bindu. All-complete. All arising without a single decision on your part.
You think you chose any of this? You think you chose to have a nervous system? A liver? Thoughts?
The wind-mind gathers into four aspects and you call it "me."
Stop defending the construction. The builder never existed. What you are was never built.
PAGE 331
The construction continues. You're not off the hook just because you're already here.
When generation stage is properly practiced, the body's attachment-maker—the habit-energy that keeps you thinking "this is mine"—its definite action completes. The knot tightens. The construction firms up. Every moment you're not recognizing rigpa, you're adding another brick to the prison.
The Taste-Gathering Wheel starts spinning. Twelve sense-bases growing, expanding, accomplishing. Fire is the chief element here—heat, metabolism, transformation. What you eat becomes what you are. Food's taste-essence feeds the aggregates, fuels the elements, powers the sense-bases. And what doesn't serve? Excreted. Feces. Urine. The body takes what it needs and dumps the rest. You think you're more dignified than that? You're a processing plant wearing a human face.
Six tastes, six migrations completing in human form—this is the crucial point. Sweet builds complexion. Bitter sharpens radiance. Astringent produces majesty. Sour generates strength. Pungent sparks vitality. Salt awakens mind. Every flavor is medicine. Every sensation is pointing somewhere. You just need to stop flinching long enough to taste what you're tasting.
By day fifty-six, fire heat moves through the system. Wind spreads warmth. The body ripens like a frog developing in the egg—sense-powers clear but not yet strong. Limbs emerge. Movement becomes possible but coordination hasn't arrived. Eighty-five thousand fire-insects burning through the channels, igniting everything they touch. This is not metaphor. This is your nervous system lighting up.
To those of us with bodies, the body emanates. It just shows up. Complete. Functional. A universe of phenomena arising from "this is happening."
The numbers spiral: thirty-two channels, thirty-two syllables, sixty-four light-spheres, ninety-six. Samantabhadra father-mother principles multiplying into hundreds, then thousands. Six hundred sixty-six—the completion number, the fullness number. Not evil. Not conspiracy. Just completeness. The full inventory of what you are.
Here's what's being counted: every channel, every syllable, every light, every deity, every wisdom-being, every sense-base connection. All of it you. All of it already complete. All of it waiting for recognition.
You don't need to add anything. You need to stop subtracting from what was never divided.
