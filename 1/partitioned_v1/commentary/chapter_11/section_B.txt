[13951-13953] You think these channels are tubes inside the body? Fool. Look at the sky—does it have vessels? Yet clouds move. These are labels for what has no shape.
[13954-13970] Thalgyur speaks to those who must count channels before they trust what never moves. The body has no life-pillar. That which thinks "this is the central channel"—find that one first.
[13971-13985] Eight topics, one hundred twelve channels, sixty-four at the peak—numbers for children who need fingers to count. The vital-point is not found in any of them. It is the one who counts.
[13986-13997] Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma—left, right, center. Where is the one who knows left from right? Rest there. Do not search for these in the body. The body is already a channel for confusion.
[13998-14001] Three channels named like old friends. You have never met them. Yet you are never separate from what they indicate.
[14002-14021] A-OM-HUM abide—where? In the space where the letter A has no form. That space is your face right now. Recognize it or chase channels for another eon.
[14003-14006] Listen, dear practitioner! Look at your own body—this very flesh and bone. When pure, it ripens into Buddha's body, speech, and mind. When impure, it ripens into your ordinary body, speech, and mind. Do you see the difference? It is only the presence or absence of confusion! Mistaken view opens the door for the three poisons to arise. Drop the mistake, and where is the impurity?
[14007-14009] Now, this ro ma channel—taste channel, they call it. When you press it, supreme flavor arises like the best food! But leave it alone, and it is like dead flesh—useless. What does this teach you? Use it or lose it! Engage with the dharma, taste the practice. Let it sit idle, and you are a corpse walking.
[14010-14015] This channel runs on the right side for men, left for women. But wait! Some tantras reverse this. Why? To break your rigid certainty! You think you know where things are? The dharma smashes your maps. Certainty is the disease—doubt cut through is the cure. The rkyang ma—solitary channel—when pressed, gives birth to experience free from conceptual thought. Left alone, it stays isolated, unrelated to others, standing alone like a hermit in the mountains. For men it is on the left, for women on the right. Do not cling to positions!
[14016-14020] The kun 'dar ma—central channel, all-shaking—dwells between male and female sides. Press it, and wisdom clarity experience arises! It is the maintainer of your body, speech, and mind. These three channels are the basis of all channels, therefore called "ma"—the mothers. Everything arises from them.
[14021-14027] Now listen closely! When ro ma comes to the right side of a man, it produces bodhicitta—the mind of enlightenment. But in a woman's left, it gathers and swells the bodhicitta, never satisfied with desire. When rkyang ma comes to a man's left, it holds the power of blood emission—the nosebleed marks the time of wisdom! Do you see? Your very fluids are the dharma.
[14028-14034] On a woman's right side, this divides into the five sense channels, source of diseases men never know—this is the difference of constitution. Dark complexion, short thick body, good teeth, round face—these mark the deer-channel, the main one. Like the antler of a stag, thick at the root with much desire, thin at the tip—actual bodhicitta cannot emerge! Here, if you make the thigle's key point into the path, the instruction on channel movement is supreme. Fair complexion, thin body, straight hair—know these signs.
Emaho! Your body is the mandala!
[14035-14046] Eye round, limbs thin—ox-nose race! Channel ox nose like, channel nose upward, navel from exists, bodhicitta actual emit not able! Desire small—channel split from! This channel splitting oral instruction chief! Also color black, limbs coarse, face rough, ugly—lotus-possessor! Channel lotus mouth open like exists, channel mouth round, bodhicitta actual not emit, that long, bliss great! This channel mouth opening chief!
[14047-14065] Also color blue-green, tooth gaps, eye cheek long, hair yellow, some thin, limbs thin, hidden, slow—line-possessor! Channel line drawn like, joy happy, first bliss taste great! Channel many branches, bodhicitta actual not arising, channel branches many, who touch experience produces!
Do you see? Body signs show channel types! Recognize them, not judge them! Emaho!
[14078-14084] Seed not emitted! Insects many etc. work arisen, disease common vessel enter many! Men that not exist, few explained! Race's channels, vessel, entering son's body produced from!
[14085-14102] Kundarma both's center not changing dwells—unconditioned meaning basis great perfection all shows! Second, special channels three's purifier: roma vital-point skilled, body's deeds all purifies! Rkyangma speech, kundarma mind deed purifies! Third, channels these showing: roma bliss non-conception shows, that dependent origination's wheel turns, memory exhausts, corpse aspect similar—roma called! Rkyangma: clear corpse one shows, thigle essence single meaning dwells—rkyangma called! Kundarma union non-dual shows, method bliss and prajna emptiness union, conventional object-possessor and ultimate object-possessor not, both united—non-dual limit-free pure view called! Also right method shows, left prajna shows, center non-dual shows! Fourth, channels these production: roma body produces, first body forms, four elements' action, father's cause arisen, water both ripened enter, karma confusion-wheel, body's basis held!
Emaho! Three channels, three gates to liberation!
[14107-14113] Listen, dear practitioner! Insertion place, making close. Conventionally, at the twenty-first vertebra of mind-ripened-born men. At women's thirteenth, at the lotus stigma's tip. Its branches gather at the breast peak. Those sixteen branches at the navel gathering. At men's rib interval. These perform body's formation, abiding, destruction—taking close.
[14114-14119] Rkyang ma produces speech. Without curve and straight—voice pleasant, code clear. If minor branches thin—voice shrill and short, or code unclear like stammer comes. Naturally, without branches and curve.
[14120-14128] From those ten channels gone, voice comes rough. If that channel has upper-lower thick-thin gaps—voice comes with many tips and interrupted. If that channel has pressure—voice comes suppressed and trembling. If channel completely exists—voice comes very clear, chewing others. Yogis change by channel oral instruction.
Do you see? Your voice comes from channels! Straight channels, pleasant voice. Crooked channels, stammering. But who speaks? Find that one!
Emaho! The speaker has no voice!
[14138-14147] Left exists, always doubt and uncertainty dwells! Tip that changes, always suffering much, mind unhappy! Channel that changes, always mind virtuous, virtue diligent! Channel that great, always diligence great, beginning completed! Also body channels produce, channels speech produce, speech mind produce, mind dharmatā produce, dharmatā yoga produce—thus producer called!
[14148-14161] Fifth, channels these deeds do: roma essence lamp radiance shows, impurity urine fall work! Rkyangma essence up-pulls, lamp self-appearance shows, experience and increase! That impurity down-opens, feces discard! Kundarma essence up-pulls, ultimate bodhicitta actual shows, impurity down-flows, conventional bodhicitta thigle fall! That also men actual emit, bliss touch experience destroys—"experience thigle fall before bliss destroys"! Women race five swallowed dwell, touch increases—again bliss expands, not satisfied!
Do you see? Men and women—different channels, same confusion! Emaho!
[14172] Romā's essence is bliss—with special method, grasping sphere dharmatā pure essence liberates!
[14173-14176] Rkyangma's essence is emptiness—prajna pure, grasping mind's conception liberates into dharmatā! Kundarma's essence bliss-emptiness non-dual, union non-dual, liberating from grasping-grasped, wisdom spontaneously shows!
[14177-14182] Seventh: these channels' dharmatā—romā takes food, food's essence-impurity, digests dharmatā. If its inside wide, person big-bellied; thin, small-bellied; crooked, always vomiting, not taking food, many adventitious diseases!
[14183-14191] Rkyangma—body's heat increasing-decreasing. This channel thin, body naturally much heat; wide, small, always cold; crooked and changing as before. Kundarma—body's thirst characteristic, showing non-thirst dharmatā. This thin, never thirsty; wide, great thirst desire.
Do you see? Your belly, your temperature, your thirst—all from these channels! Recognize their nature and liberation is immediate! Emaho!
[14206-14220] Listen here! The Kun-darma channel joins mind's movement with pure dharmatā, aligning memory-thought with reality. This matches self-arisen wisdom—earlier and later conceptions self-cease, self-liberate, self-arise. Objects and conditions liberate into dharmatā, memory-conception self-depleted, dharmatā's intent appears!
The *Mu-tig-phreng* tantra teaches: "Body is three-kaya mandala body; words spoken are mantra speech; thoughts are meditation itself." When you squeeze the channel's ripening essence, the channel reaches its own characteristic. Finding the location, you recognize dharmatā arisen from channels. At the channel's leaping time, knowing death-transference and birth-place. Pressing the channel's nature, mind non-separated from samadhi's wheel. Holding the wrapped channel's heat measure, always becomes food yoga. Following the channel's movement calculation, becomes clothing yoga. Relying on the channel's pulsing vital-point, latent tendencies cease—these channel vital-points are extremely profound!
[14221-14235] Now the four wheels! All beings' bodies depend on wheels; even non-wheel dharmas are established from many. Like external existence: wind depends on water, water on earth, etc.—wind-mind clear-essence gathered, water gathers as one, internal body forms. First wheel from water's action—blood, water-yellow, saliva, eye-water arise as essence. Body's increase-decrease is blood's function. When elements heat, blood dries—body becomes disease. Increasing blood cures disease. When cold, blood freezes—disease. Do you see? Your body is the play of these wheels, practitioner!
Emaho! Three kayas right in your flesh!
[14240-14246] Listen here, dear practitioner! Squeezed flesh, flesh variety from heart branched and supported—these when cut, pinched, struck, pierced make life's end. Burning and roasting through dependent origination liberates from disease!
[14247-14252] Thus from earth, wood and so on arise—fire's cause in So-nga Wang-ra. Third wheel fire's action chief. This produces body's heat, faculties, color. When heat is great, becomes hot element, making body's disease and death conditions. When heat is small, becomes cold disease condition. Elements equal through dharmat's dependent origination liberates!
[14253-14264] Also fire heat moved by wind moves, blazing like great fire. Fourth wheel wind's action work, breath outside-inside moving, rising-descending eliminating work. Karma wheel makes samsara's root. Latency and hatred's work disturbs body elements' individual functions, making disease and death conditions—liberation through dependent origination of elements placed in vital-point.
Do you see? Disease comes from elements disturbed! Liberation comes from recognizing dependent origination!
Emaho! Elements equal—liberation through dharmata!
[14270-14273] From gathering: form large but strength weak, limbs thin. From gathering-release: form small but strength endowed. From mindfulness projection: mind clear, senses clear, discrimination without coarseness. From gathering: discrimination large and forgetful.
Listen! It is not what you have but how you hold it. Gather too much, and even a strong body becomes weak. Release with awareness, and even a small form becomes powerful.
[14274-14283] From gathering: senses clear, mind clear, forgetful. From flying projection: discrimination large yet meditation quickly arises. From pure taste projection: speech pleasant, words clear, sounds skillful. From gathering: speech unpleasant. From impure increase: pleasant speech, great eloquence, yet speech powerless. From pure tip projection: mind pure, aspirations accomplished. From impure increase: mind's good accomplished yet virtue not increased. From gathering: mind's desires not accomplished, mindfulness and meditation reversed. From pure: mind's desires not accomplished yet virtue increased. This is the certainty of gathering-releasing.
[14284-14293] Also, the reason for the certainty of four wheels: One and two do not ripen empowerments, path, and final results; three also does not ripen; reverse certainty also makes four. The sequence of what joins and what joins—harmonious certainty also makes four. Outer four elements, inner four wisdoms, secret four lamps, unsurpassed four kayas—certain, therefore four wheels. True body, speech, mind, mind—four. Purifying four empowerments, pure four results—certain, therefore four wheels as basis.
[14294-14302] Second, explaining the individual enumerations of four wheels: navel emanation wheel, heart dharma wheel, throat enjoyment wheel, crown great bliss wheel. First has four: general enumeration, individual limb explanation, particular key points shown.
Emaho! Your body is the mandala of four wheels! Gather and release with wisdom!
[14303-14314] Repair methods certainly explained! First: root channel petals six, water root four branched, petals numberless! Particularly inner channels certain: elements, mind, ignorance, mind, elements all-gathered's divisions, small wheel's petal each thirty-eight becomes, divided two thousand four hundred thirty-two exist!
[14315-14332] Also root and branch's power done: channel basis wheel: emanation wheel petals sixty-four! Elements etc. stages divided: earth channels five aspects, body's basis holding! Water channels five aspects, body's essence gathering! Fire's essence gathering! Wind's channels five aspects, wind's essence gathering! Mind's channels five aspects, breath's essence gathering! Ignorance channels five aspects, individual body's elements showing! Space mind's channels two, breath and awareness's essence gathering! Elements all-gathered channels six, sphere and ignorance gathering!
Do you see? Two thousand four hundred thirty-two channels in your navel—all wisdom-play! Emaho!
[14364-14378] Second wheel speech, throat enjoy. Third wheel mind, heart dharma. Fourth wheel quality, navel emanation. These wheels—have you looked for the axle? The axle is your own awareness. It has no location.
[14379-14385] Wheel's name, quality, location, channel, action. Five things explained. The explainer is the sixth. Do not forget the sixth.
[14386-14396] Enjoyment wheel throat-in speech produce, dharma wheel heart-in mind produce, quality wheel navel-in attachment aversion produce. Body speech mind three produced from wheels? No. Wheels are produced from grasping at body speech mind. Grasping itself is empty.
[14397-14402] Emanation wheel navel-in aggregates elements produce. Buddha-field appear, emanation send. All from a wheel at the navel? The navel is a concept. The wheel is a concept. You are not a concept.
[14416-14437] Dum-dum-khrigs channels, sixty-eight petals, five grasp suitable, five not-press defect, hundred press defect, twelve rise, seven bloodletting death. Medical instructions for those with bodies. But who treats the patient? Find that one.
[14438-14455] Bima speaks, navel emanation, finger four, liver rtsa black, kidney rtsa black, bile yellow. Letters and locations for bloodletting. The letter has no blood. The location has no body.
[14456-14462] Shin-continuation long, shin-continuation short, womb zig-zag. Names for treatments. The treatment and the treated are one confusion.
[14463-14497] Letter recitation, breath expel, ti Ti shoulder, la lA thigh, sa sA kidney. Burn constipation cure, burn kidney benefit. The burner and burned—who distinguishes?
[14456-14467] Listen here, dear one! These channels have secret names in the medical tradition. The long bindu tail dwells at the right waist—cut it to benefit kidney disease. The short bindu tail at the left—cut it for spinal curvature. The bol gong at the right holds sha's tail—cut for wind disorder. The klong du gyu at the left—cut for ear disease. The left tail at the ankle's outer edge—cut for kidney ailments. These are not anatomy lessons! These are signs pointing to where energy gets stuck in your own body.
[14468-14485] The kham letter dwells at the left—called the kidney grasping channel in medicine—cut it for lumbar distortion and hip pain. But listen well, practitioner! When disease arises, the yogi does not do this to oneself! When these letters arise internally, recite them verbally with breath five times each, expelling them to the nostril—this is liberation! The ti and ti at right and left forehead, la at right and left thigh hollow, sa and sa at right and left kidney hollow, sha and sha at the armpit—these points burned heal disorders. But the yogi does not burn oneself! Draw breath from outside to inside with awareness—this is the path!
Emaho! The body itself is the mandala of liberation!
[14505-14509] Ta and La at the vajra, upper and lower—press these two, and the bindu's movement stops. The syllable Sha at the vajra tip—pressing these two abandons desire. Listen! When yogic illness strikes the body, repeatedly press and release all these.
[14510-14519] Gathering diseases are extracted from the root by this. Tsa and Tsa are below the navel, right and left. Ta and Ta are at the armpits, right and left. To and To are at the hips, right and left. Ja and Ja are below the navel, right and left. Ta and Ta are at the kidneys, right and left. Do not press these inward—recite and release upward, and the elements become balanced.
[14520-14526] Below the waist, however it may be, reciting these syllables with effort, element diseases certainly dissolve in their own place. Right and left are the key points of the syllables themselves. Hot and cold—white and red colors. These are the colors of the syllables. Other than these, root syllables have no benefit or harm.
[14527-14545] Second, the heart dharma wheel—from four: first, generally showing the numbers. From eight root vessels, thirty-two branch into countless leaf channels. From the wheel location: The dharma wheel's channels—not past thirty-two. Channels of karma and wisdom dwell. Know these! From the heart dharma wheel: Thirty-two major channel leaves, one thousand nine hundred minor channels dwell. From their forms: four gathering channels become twenty-eight. Twenty-eight gathering channels, fourteen awareness channels, five body channels, four light and wisdom channels. The location of these major channels having three wheels as above. The first wheel is as above; the second will be explained here.
[14546-14559] Twenty-five wisdom channels, five gathering channels. Two mind channels. The third wheel will be explained. Five bindu channels, eight prajna channels, two ignorance channels, fifteen gathering channels, five light-ray channels, element channels likewise. Two are empty channels. The first wheel will be explained: five awareness channels, five body channels—each having two. Ten gathering channels, three phlegm channels, two wind channels, two bile channels. The rest are gathering. Four light and wisdom channels are called actual things.
[14560-14581] The second wheel is thus: twenty-five wisdom channels are five dharmadhatu wisdoms. Mirror-like is likewise equal. Five are equality wisdom. Likewise five discriminating, five all-accomplishing. Five gathering channels are the five abiding elements. From two mind channels: wind and consciousness abiding. The third wheel explained: five bindu channels—two conventional bindus, two awareness bindus, one wisdom bindu. Eight prajna channels: two discern, two gather, two liberate, the rest maintain. Two ignorance channels self-place press. Fifteen gathering channels: four phlegm-mind, five delusion-bile, four anger-wind, two desire-gathering. Five light-ray channels: base light-ray, path light-ray one, the rest eye light-ray.
[14582-14605] From the citta jewel palace, three wheels possessing channel leaves ninety-six.
Do not make this into philosophy, dear practitioner! These channels, these wheels, these bindus—they are your very body. Press, recite, release—this is the path of subtle body. Balance the elements, and liberation is at hand.
[14606-14617] Look here! These channels—some have water-yellow essence, some blood essence, some wind and earth elements, some five elements' essence. Each one has essences dwelling in sequence! Wind and bindu dwelling—each channel has one of each. These spreading as wind, merely dwelling in form. Do you see? It's all the play of essences, practitioner! Water, blood, wind, earth—your body is a mandala of elements!
[14618-14630] Their function and enumeration—from the dharma wheel's petals: five go upward, vitality radiance and wisdom sending. Five go left, prajna flow and sense faculties holding. Five dwell in joints and center, secret continuity's basis. Five dwell in directions and center, arising-sending and setting-gathering. Thus channel forms—two existent secret channels... [text continues]
Do you see the pattern? Up, left, center, joints, directions—channels weave through your body like threads in a tapestry! And who weaves? No weaver! Just wisdom-display! Emaho!
[14754-14761] Ha! You think you know this body, practitioner? Cut here—liver diseases flee. That short rut inside—the kha kha small heat channel—cut it for phlegm. Dza at the bile corner of the elbow—that's the right upper channel—cut for lung disease. Left side too, dza dwells—the left upper channel—yellow phlegm flees. Don't you see? These points aren't anatomy—they're where your energy knots itself into delusion!
[14762-14778] Center back of the knee—ta dwells straight—back channel neck completion—cut for upper body disease. Between thumb and forefinger, one tsen span—Ta dwells—heart channel white woman—cut for kidney, bile, heart. Straight center back, tha dwells—great back channel—back taste disease flees. Little toe's outer corner, da dwells—liver channel hron bu—hand disease. Big toe's back straight, dha dwells—bile channel ghan dhe—head disease. All these doors in your very flesh!
[14779-14793] Middle finger's back, na dwells—stomach branch—poison flees. Ring finger's back, ta dwells—spleen branch—spleen disease. Ring finger back straight, tsa dwells—kidney crooked channel—kidney disease. Little toe's back, da—the male crooked channel—male disease. Palm center, dha dwells—black liver channel—male liver disease. This is your body, fool! Not meat and bone—the mandala itself! Cut through the knot and recognize! Emaho!
[14754-14761] Listen here, dear practitioner! These channels are not for cutting with knives! Cutting this benefits all liver diseases. In the short rut of that, dwells the kha kha small heat channel—cut it for phlegm disease. At the bile corner of the elbow dwells dza, called the right upper channel—cut it for lung disease. At the left also dwells dza, the left upper channel—cut thus for yellow phlegm.
[14762-14778] At the center back of the knee, ta dwells straight—called the back channel neck completion—cut it for upper body disease. Between the thumb and forefinger of the hand, at the span of one tsen, dwells Ta—called the heart channel white woman—cut it for kidney, bile, and heart diseases. Straight at the center back, tha dwells—called the great back channel—cut it for back taste disease. At the outer corner of the little toe, da dwells—called the liver channel hron bu—cut it for hand disease. Straight at the back of the big toe, dha dwells—called the bile channel ghan dhe—cut it for head disease.
[14779-14793] At the back of the middle finger, na dwells—called the stomach branch—cut it for poison disease. At the back of the ring finger, ta dwells—called the spleen branch—cut it for spleen disease. Straight at the back of the ring finger, tsa dwells—called the kidney crooked channel—cut thus for kidney disease. At the back of the little toe, da letter exists—called the male crooked channel—cut it for male disease. At the center of the palm, dha letter dwells—called the black liver channel—cut it for male liver disease. These are not medical instructions, dear one! They point to where your energy knots! Recognize the knot and it unravels itself! Emaho!
[14807-14813] By this, benefit comes to that illness. Yogis accomplish by pressing. These are the key syllables summarized. The rest have no benefit or harm. Pressing, shaking, and drawing—the yogi should know these.
Listen! The throat chakra—the wheel of enjoyment. Here speech becomes mantra, voice becomes vajra song. Press the channels, shake the elements, draw the winds—this is the yogi's play.
[14814-14827] Third, the throat enjoyment wheel—from four: first, generally showing the numbers. Sixteen channel leaves. From these, inner and outer divide into countless minor leaves. Three hundred forty major inner channels dwell in the coils of seven wheels. From the wheel location: At the throat enjoyment wheel dwell three hundred forty major channels. Having seven wheels in sequence: the first wheel's leaves are ten. The rest are all like that. All have twenty at the end. These are the channel types.
[14828-14838] Karma and affliction latencies, wisdom movement channels, gathering channels—these are the paths. Sixteen wisdom movements, awareness bodies likewise that many. Sixteen prajna bindus, elements also sixteen. Eight channels of empty-clear bindu. Fourteen gathering channels. The rest are path karma.
[14839-14849] The awareness body wheels—sixteen in number. Seven are actual awareness. The rest are bodies. First, the root channel awareness body. Second is the expansive body. Third flows to the heart. Fourth, unchanging vajra body. Fifth, bodhisattva body. Sixth is the nature itself. Seventh, seeing self-liberation.
[14850-14861] Eighth, true bliss body. One extra is the moving. For awareness, two each. Sixteen prajna bindus—eight are empty bindu movement. Four are ground-path bindus. The rest are wisdom movement paths. Sixteen element leaves: from four come wind essences, from four come wisdom-fire essences, from three come earth-yellow essences, from three come water-blood essences.
Emaho! The throat wheel where speech becomes dharma! Press, shake, draw—liberation is in your very channels!
[14862-14868] Space-of essence mind first that from change only. You read this and think of bindus moving? The bindu that moves is not the bindu that matters. The bindu that matters never entered any channel.
[14869-14876] Four phlegm channels, four bile, four wind, two earth. Fourteen affliction paths—who walks them? The walker is the path. The path is empty.
[14877-14882] Throat enjoyment wheel, four above going, empty potency purifying. All true. But do not seek these wheels in the throat. The throat is a label. The enjoyment is recognition.
[14883-14891] Two all-pervading, two below, four right, four left. Wisdom potency, action power. These winds—have you found the windless? The one who knows wind has no breath.
[14892-14908] Direction portion, moving wind, dissolve reverse, grasping essence, form pair unite. Technical terms for children. The adult knows: all of this is spontaneous presence. Presence does not study.
Do you see? Your throat holds the goddesses! Each channel a deity, each wind a mantra! Don't worship outside—worship this! Emaho!
