[13133-13136] Look at this madness, practitioner! The five races' power draws the father's consciousness inward, like iron to lodestone. Then, free from attachment, it goes to the mother's lotus—but because any race's drawing agent exists in the mother, there's no satisfaction with bliss. This is desire and attachment born from cause and condition!
[13137-13142] Desire and attachment—these two held as cause and condition. Samsara's body held by the ground wind. Knowing cause and condition as nondual, the result of bliss and great bliss interweaves as body and wisdom's result. Thus, on the first day's night from the mother's womb, father's cause and mother's condition become one external cause, while internally unmixed they dwell like a chick in an egg, holding the child's wind-mind. The four elements' binding cause—like a jewel shell—binds without opportunity for separation. This comes from when body completes without food from the mouth, life cannot remain.
[13143-13153] At that time, the wind holding the body—the inner wind's leaping power soars upward, like mercury drops rising, dwelling quivering. When body completes, whatever adventitious condition occurs to body-mind, there's fear and body trembling—from this. Then on the second day, earth mixes as one, pressing with weight—the child has suffering from the crown pressed down like a thousand. At this time, the body's cause is held as merely flesh, while condition channels are merely water moistening. From nondual ignorance cause-condition, non-conceptual wisdom liberates—the great perfection's key beyond acceptance and rejection! Above, the body's cause moistens, merely blood coagulating, while condition water merely flows down channels.
Emaho! See how samsara forms from confusion!

The work of production. How your body and mind arise from letters, from elements, from sounds you cannot hear but that nonetheless create everything you experience.
Within that, the syllable SAṀ—yellow, clear, radiant. Attachment. From this syllable, bound to beings' voices, all experience arises.
The four directions: earth, water, fire, wind. Channels of each, gathering and spreading. Within them: SUṀ white, red, green—each color, each channel, each abiding in its place. From this, the four activities of beings—going, sleeping, sitting, acting—all arise.
Then the sixth day: fire and wind combining, the body's form taking shape. Within the blazing, expanding fire channel, the syllable RĀṀ—greatly scraping, pulsing. This syllable distinguishes all beings' cognition: sharp and dull, clear and unclear.
The four directions again, the inner elements, the channels expanding. Within burning, the syllables RĀṀ producing, RUṀ empty. These become the signs of sleep, the markers of dreams. From these, beings' memory and thought arise, spinning the wheel of mental activity.
Six days complete, and the elements become the body's support, the form's foundation.
Without this, the four elements cannot control food and clothing. The inner dharmas cannot manifest as groups. The four secret empowerments' fruits remain immature. The four forms become the certain support.
Then: the work of elements over days and nights, male and female combining, seed growing. The elements and the genders together create the body's aggregation.
On the seventh day, the four elements become one taste. Four causes: wind, mind. Four supports: flesh, blood, warmth, breath. Four channels. Four syllables—becoming one form, the aggregate of everything gathered.
Here's what's being described: your body is a construction. Letters, syllables, elements, channels—all coming together to create this apparatus you call "me." The sounds you cannot hear are building everything you experience.
Don't mistake the construction for the builder. Don't identify with the built. The elements will disperse. The syllables will return to their sources. The channels will dissolve.
What's left? The awareness that was never built, never constructed, never formed from elements and syllables. That's who you really are. Not the body. Not the mind. The presence that watches it all arise and dissolve.
Watch it. Don't identify with it. You're the awareness, not the construction.
The wind channels moving, leaping. YAṀ—the syllable of movement, of breath, of the going and coming of all beings. From this syllable, existence pulses.
Earth channels, water gathering, fire's three actions. YAṀ again, piling and separating. YE separating and gathering. AUM—rolling, bowing, abiding.
Within the four syllables, the aggregates form at the particle level. The form aggregate: particles, subtle. The perception aggregate: warmth, like a horse galloping through space. The feeling aggregate: memory's cord, coiled three ways. The consciousness aggregate: knowing, color, movement. The formation aggregate: feeling's doors opening.
Five aggregates arising from the elements, five bases from conditions. Around these five, like a net of light, the five syllables adorn the five heads of the five supports: DZRIṀ, KHAṀ, TĀṀ, MAṀ, BYAṀ. These are the five buddha families, the five vital points.
From these syllables, transformation happens. The changeless awareness becomes buddha certain.
Within water channels, four aspects: primordial wisdom, not opening, not distinguishing. The body becomes a thousand subtle drops, cooled, clear. Five lights gathering, five wisdoms arising.
The syllable OM and others—AUM, DZRIṀ, KHAṀ, HŪṀ, TĀM, SWĀ, MAṀ, HAPYAM—from these, certainty of awakening.
All of this is the wisdom that is self-arisen, spontaneously present. Not constructed, not made. Already complete within the construction itself.
The five buddha families, five wisdoms, five lights—all arising from the same source. The syllable contains everything. The body is a display of syllables, a congregation of sounds that have arranged themselves into form.
What does this mean for you?
You're not just flesh and bone. You're syllables, sounds, elements, lights arranged in this particular pattern. The pattern will dissolve back into its elements. The syllables will return to their sources.
But awareness—the knowing that experiences all this—that was never a syllable, never an element, never formed from parts. Awareness is the space in which syllables arise and dissolve.
Don't identify with the syllables. They're just visitors, passing through. You are the sky they're passing through.
The construction is temporary. The sky is permanent.
Wisdom self-arisen, spontaneously present. The wisdom that grasps characteristics, that gathers knowing, that abides as light. This is the mirror-like wisdom, the first of the five.
The past wisdom, primordial purity, white light like stars covering everything. From this, dharmata arises unstained by karmic latencies. The wisdom that gathers samsara and nirvana into one knowing.
Wind-channel wisdom, non-conceptual mind, abiding. The wisdom of equalness, red light, self-arisen realization. Yellow light, other-arisen realization. Wisdom that knows existence and non-existence, phenomena and non-phenomena—this is the discriminating wisdom, the third.
All-knowing wisdom, the fourth, gathers into two: ultimate and conventional. From this, the fruition of the three kayas. Birth, abiding, death—pleasure and pain—all experienced. The yogin's body becomes the nature of the three kayas.
Body's characteristics, grasping wisdom—dharmakaya certainty found. Abiding wisdom—sambhogakaya. Ceasing wisdom—nirmanakaya. The three kayas are not somewhere else. They are what you are when wisdom is recognized.
Seven days—the body's basis thickens. All approaching-accomplishing actions gathered in seven days. Elements gathering and expanding, accomplished in seven days.
The wisdom that is like a horse, like wind—when the body dissolves, it's not that wisdom ends. It continues, moving, abiding elsewhere.
Letters, lights, bodies—all arise from awareness's self-radiance, then dissolve back into ignorance itself, into awareness.
Awareness, base-abiding, inner clarity expanding—without color, without form. When the body exists, appearances arise outward. Light body, form body—even in the bardo, appearances arise.
What does this mean?
You're not becoming a buddha. You're recognizing that you already are the wisdom that has always been present. The five wisdoms aren't achievements—they're what awareness naturally is when not confused by appearances.
Mirror-like: reflecting everything without keeping anything. Equal: not favoring pleasure over pain, nirvana over samsara. Discriminating: knowing exactly what things are without混淆. Accomplishing: acting without hesitation. Dharmadhatu: the vast space where all of this happens.
These aren't acquired. They're uncovered. Like removing dust from a mirror—the reflection was always there.
You're not becoming. You're revealing.
