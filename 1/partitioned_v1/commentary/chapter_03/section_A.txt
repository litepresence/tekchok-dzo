Longchenpa continues on the fruit of the bodhisattva path [2903-2961], and you must hear this not as future attainment but as present possibility! The ground of All-Illumination [2905] is not a place you will reach after eons of practice. It is the nature of your awareness right now, when fully recognized.
The Dharma body for self-purpose, the two form bodies for others [2905-2908]—this is the complete awakening. But what are these bodies? Not physical forms you will acquire! The Dharma body is the empty, luminous nature of mind itself—the aspect that knows its own nature. The form bodies are the compassionate display that spontaneously arises to benefit beings—the aspect that appears while remaining empty.
From the Entrance: "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought, working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained" [2910-2913]. This is not poetry about some distant Buddha! This describes what happens when your mind is fully liberated. You become a wish-fulfilling tree—whatever beings need, you naturally provide. You become a wish-fulfilling jewel—whatever they wish for, you spontaneously manifest.
And "until liberation is attained" [2913]—this does not mean until YOU attain liberation. It means until ALL beings attain liberation. The bodhisattva's vow is endless, not because the bodhisattva fails, but because compassion is inexhaustible. Even when all beings are free, the display continues, the benefit continues, the play of awakening goes on.
The conventional and ultimate truths [2918-2961] are explained again here, but now in the context of practice. The false conventional—all imputed appearances [2924-2928]. The true conventional—the ten virtues, the thoughts of faith [2929-2935]. The nominal ultimate—what is established through reasoning [2936-2944]. The truly mental ultimate—emptiness utterly without anything [2945-2954].
But do not stop at the ultimate either! Even emptiness can be grasped. Even "ultimate" is a concept. Go beyond the beyond, to what cannot be named, cannot be thought, cannot be taught—yet is fully present in every moment of your life.
PAGE 60 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa speaks of the stages of heat, patience, peak, and supreme dharma [2960-2978], and these are crucial markers on the path! These are not abstract concepts—they are experiences you will have as practice deepens.
Heat [2960-2971] is the first sign that something is working. Like warmth before sunrise, you feel the approach of realization. It has three aspects: outer, inner, and both together. The outer heat arises when you see entities as empty—when you look at the world and it no longer appears solid, real, graspable. The inner heat is the sixth—when you understand the pure knowable as empty, when even your understanding is seen through. The heat of both arises when outer and inner are recognized as one display.
Patience [2971-2972] comes next—not the patience of waiting, but the patience of not turning back. You have seen emptiness; now you can bear it. You no longer fear the void. You no longer need to reconstruct solidity. You can remain in the openness without panic.
Then the peak [2973]—the highest point of worldly realization. You are at the summit of conditioned existence. Beyond this lies the supramundane, the direct perception of the noble ones.
Supreme dharma [2974]—this is the final stage before the path of seeing. Your practice is refined, pure, unsurpassed within the world. You are ready for the direct realization that will change everything.
And the ten grounds [2974-2975]—from Great Joy to Cloud of Dharma—describe the maturing of that realization. Each ground dissolves deeper obscurations, manifests clearer wisdom. But remember: these are not places you go; they are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely you have released the illusion of a separate self.
Then Longchenpa begins the explanation of established tenet views [2979], starting with the Mind-Only school [2981-2995]. They assert that all appearances are aspects of consciousness, that there is no external reality separate from mind. This is a crucial insight! But they stop there, grasping at mind as truly existent. The Middle Way goes further, showing that mind too is empty. This is the path you must follow—not stopping halfway, not establishing anything, even emptiness, as the final truth.
PAGE 61 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa speaks of the severance of cause and result [2013-2032], and you must beware of this nihilistic trap! Some say cause is severed—mind cannot be held as entity. Some say effect is severed—life-force and lordship nonexistent. Some say path is severed—withered, nothing exists. Some say primordial wisdom is severed—Buddha nonexistent [2350-2356].
This is the extreme of nihilism dressed as wisdom! They take the teaching of emptiness and turn it into nothingness. They say "all is severed, all is cut, all is empty of meaning." But this is not the Middle Way—it is a deviation into darkness.
When Longchenpa speaks of those who "declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut" [2335], he is warning you about your own mind! Have you not had moments of despair when you thought "nothing matters, nothing exists, why practice?" This is the severance view arising in you. It feels like liberation—no more responsibility, no more effort, no more path. But it is actually just another form of grasping, another extreme to be transcended.
The knowers who speak secretly [2359]—"Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent"—these are not realized beings! They are those who have misunderstood the teaching. They grasp at the words "emptiness" and "severance" without realizing their true meaning.
True emptiness is not severance. It is not the cutting of connections, the denial of appearances, the rejection of causality. True emptiness is the recognition that appearances and emptiness are inseparable, that cause and effect function without inherent existence, that the path is walked without a walker.
Those who deviate from consistency are called tirthikas [2364]—but Buddhists who deviate are merely flesh deviating through wrong tenet. The form remains Buddhist, but the essence has become heresy. Beware of this! You can wear the robes, practice the rituals, quote the scriptures, and still hold a view that contradicts the Dharma's heart.
The Middle Way avoids both extremes: not grasping at existence, not grasping at non-existence. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Emptiness appears as cause and effect. This is the recognition that liberates—not the severance that destroys.
PAGE 62 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa enumerates the three hundred sixty mistaken views [2100-2164], and you must hear this as a warning! For every view listed here, there are beings who hold it, who believe it, who will die clinging to it as truth.
The hundred teachers [2107-2207]—Jyotiska, the grasper of the nonexistent, Life, the leaf-possessor, Vishnu, and all the rest—each represents a way that the conceptual mind tries to capture reality. And each fails! Not because reality is beyond capture, but because there is nothing to capture. The net is cast into empty water.
Some speak of permanence [2208]. Some speak of impermanence [2209]. Some speak of both [2210]. From these, the views multiply endlessly. For every assertion, there is a negation. For every philosophy, there is a counter-philosophy. This is the nature of conceptual mind—it divides, it opposes, it debates endlessly.
The tirthikas of various wrongnesses [2084-2092]—Kani and jealousy, Bhasira and Kabisha, Sindhara and Dhasim, and all the rest—these are not just ancient Indians! They are your own mind's tendencies. When you feel jealousy, you are Kani. When you grasp at philosophical positions, you are Bhasira. When you think meaning is utterly nonexistent, you are Sindhara.
And the sixty branches [2246-2283]—the Samkhyas with their atoms and darkness, the Vaisesikas with their minute atoms, Kumaralabha saying mind is nonexistent, Karnaputra holding appearance as permanent—these debates continue today! Only the names have changed. Philosophers still argue about whether reality is material or mental, whether consciousness emerges from matter or matter from consciousness.
But all of them miss the point! They are like people arguing about the color of the hat of someone who doesn't exist. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. When you search for the grasper, the searcher, the philosopher—where is it? In the brain? In the mind? In the heart? Search thoroughly, and you find nothing solid, nothing stable, nothing that persists.
This "nothing found" is not nihilism. It is the doorway to recognition. Not finding a self, you need not construct a non-self. Simply rest in the openness of not-finding. That is freedom from all three hundred sixty views and the countless others not named.
PAGE 63 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa continues listing the mistaken views [2165-2245], and the sheer number should overwhelm you! Moon-dawners, sun-dawners, hand-eaters, heart-livers, possessors of three aggregates, those who live by two or three [2165-2175]—each name represents a whole philosophy, a complete worldview, held sincerely by beings who believe it leads to liberation.
And the seventy, eighty, ninety [2176-2207]—owls, forest dwellers, dog-possessors, dwellers on riverbanks, garment-piece possessors—on and on it goes. For every way of thinking, there is a school. For every limitation, there is a doctrine that turns that limitation into the path.
The Samkhyas hold that atoms, darkness, and three energies are permanent [2246-2254]. They believe that delusion is the basis of action, attachment produces happiness, anger turns back armies. This is strategic spirituality! Use the afflictions as tools. But does it work? Can you really control anger, use it precisely, and not be burned?
The Vaisesikas view outer aggregates as minute atoms [2255-2262]—the building blocks of reality. They count these atoms, analyze them, believe they have found the fundamental nature of things. This is the scientific impulse! Reduce everything to smallest parts, understand the parts, and you understand the whole. But who understands? What is the nature of the understanding itself?
Kumaralabha says mind is nonexistent, body is nonexistent [2263-2266]. When body is abandoned, all is empty. This is nihilism pure and simple. If all is empty and nonexistent, why practice? Why care? This view leads to despair, to the rejection of all meaning.
Karnaputra sees appearance as permanent through circumstances [2267-2271], yet holds ultimate appearance as impermanent. This is confusion! Mixing permanence and impermanence without clear understanding, creating a muddle that satisfies no one.
And the secret teachings of the five fires [2272-2283]—sending lamps, burning the body, cooking with sandalwood, wrapping in fire-cloth—these are not metaphorical! People actually did these things, believing extreme asceticism would purify karma. But you cannot burn away delusion with outer fire. Only the fire of wisdom, the flame of recognition, can do that.
All these views [2421-2425] gather into four types, then into two—permanence and interruption—and finally, all are wrong paths to avoid. But how do you avoid them? Not by adopting the opposite view! You avoid them by seeing through the one who holds views, the one who establishes positions, the one who believes and disbelieves. When that one is seen through, all views are simultaneously liberated.
PAGE 64 COMMENTARY
Here Longchenpa describes the extreme ascetic practices [2284-2315]—flesh removed, body placed in holes, feeding worms, dog conduct, and all the rest. You read this and think "How primitive! How misguided!" But look at yourself—what are you doing to your body in the name of spirituality?
Are you pushing through pain until you damage yourself? Are you denying sleep, food, comfort, believing this will purify you? Are you making your body an enemy to be conquered? This is the same error! The body is not the obstacle. The obstacle is the grasping at the body as "mine," as self, as something to punish or reward.
Those who "enter dog conduct" [2288]—literally imitating dogs, eating like dogs, behaving like dogs—believing this will lead to liberation. This is mistaken conduct, yes! But why? Not because dogs are low, but because imitation is not transformation. You cannot become liberated by acting like something else, whether that something is a dog or a Buddha.
The agent cause theory [2289-2295]—like a carpenter making different forms—the belief that you can shape yourself through will and effort. There is truth here! Effort is necessary. Discipline is required. But the error is thinking the agent is solid, permanent, real. The carpenter is as empty as the forms he creates.
Those who take conduct as permanent yet see cause and result as impermanent [2316-2324]—this is the inconsistency Longchenpa warns against! You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say the path is eternal while the walking of it is not. You cannot say practice matters while results don't exist. This is confusion, not wisdom.
And those who "wield evil mantras as chief" [2324]—using spiritual power to harm, to destroy, to get what they want. Are you not also doing this when you pray for your enemies to fail, when you use your practice to feel superior, when you manipulate others with spiritual language? The form is different, but the essence is the same.
The attachment to this world [2324-2335]—called "worldly benefit"—this is where most practitioners remain. They practice for health, wealth, success, good relationships. Nothing wrong with these! But do not mistake them for the path. They are the byproducts, not the goal.
All these wrong views [2421] gather into permanence and interruption. But the Middle Way avoids both. Not grasping at existence, not grasping at non-existence. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Emptiness appears as cause and effect. This is the recognition that cuts through all three hundred sixty views in a single stroke.
PAGE 65 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa continues his relentless catalog of wrong views [2335-2376], and you must feel the urgency! Every view described here is a trap, and you are caught in many of them.
Those who "declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed, primordial wisdom severed" [2350]—this is nihilism disguised as Dzogchen! They hear that all is empty and conclude that nothing matters. They learn that the nature of mind is beyond cause and effect and decide that actions have no consequences. This is worse than the eternalist views! At least the eternalists believe in virtue.
"Buddha nonexistent" [2356]—when you say this, do you understand what you are saying? If Buddha nature is nonexistent, why practice? If awakening is impossible, why bother? This is not the teaching of emptiness; this is the denial of the Buddha's own attainment.
Those severed while abiding on the path who "declare the effect definitely severed" [2356]—these are practitioners who have fallen into despair. They practiced, they tried, they did not get the results they wanted, so they conclude liberation is impossible. Do not become one of these!
"Severance is emptiness—you are severed, I am severed—therefore nothing exists" [2356]—this is the worst kind of pseudo-wisdom! Taking the profound teaching of emptiness and turning it into an excuse for laziness, for immorality, for giving up.
The knowers who speak secretly [2359]—"Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent. Slight parts exist, suitable for appearance to faculties"—these are not realized beings! They are intellectuals playing with concepts. They construct elaborate philosophies that satisfy the mind but do not transform the heart.
And the tirthikas who deviate [2364-2376]—those who think all is magic, those who say anger finishes spirits, those who say the mind is self-arisen and uncorrectable, those who say meditating on deity-body is sufficient. Each of these is a deviation you might fall into! The one who thinks practice doesn't matter because "all is illusion." The one who justifies anger as "wrathful activity." The one who believes they are already enlightened so no correction is needed.
Beware! The path is narrow. The deviations are countless. At every step, ego finds a way to co-opt the teaching. Your job is not to avoid all these views—impossible! Your job is to recognize the one who holds views, the one who deviates, and see that it too is empty. Then all views are simultaneously liberated.
PAGE 66 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa lists the various tirthika teachers and their names [2376-2396]—Kani-pa, Sersnawa, Sambhari, Kabhisha, Sindha, Dhasimba, Katipa, Sangha, Shamkari, Doshaka—and you must not dismiss these as merely historical!
Kani-pa: those who wish for meaning indifferently [2376]. Are you not sometimes this? You want awakening, but you want it casually, without urgency, without commitment. You practice when convenient, when you feel like it, when it doesn't interfere with other desires. This is indifference, and it leads nowhere.
Sersnawa: possessed of suffering, fearing diminished appearances and emptiness [2376]. This is you when you approach the teachings! You want liberation, but you are terrified of what you will lose. You want to transcend the ego, but you cling to its comforts. The fear of emptiness paralyzes you, keeps you circling the teaching but never entering.
Kabhisha: those who think neither special meaning nor common meaning exists [2381]. This is the nihilist again, denying all significance, all purpose. If neither ordinary life nor spiritual practice matters, why do anything? This view leads to paralysis, to depression, to the rejection of all effort.
Sindha: those who think common meaning nonexistent, yet special meaning exists [2381]. This is spiritual elitism! You reject ordinary life while grasping at spiritual achievement. You become a practitioner who looks down on "worldly" people, who believes your path makes you superior. This pride is worse than worldly vanity.
And so on, through Dhasimba who thinks meaning utterly nonexistent, Katipa who thinks meaning exists until breath is cut, Sangha who thinks entering the Sangha's feature is sufficient [2381-2392]. Each represents a way that mind limits itself, creates a box, and calls it the truth.
The truth of compounded impermanence, the truth of life-force and lordship [2392-2396]—these are the alternatives offered, the correct views that lead to liberation. But even these can be grasped! Even the four seals can become a new prison if you hold them rigidly.
The point is not to find the right view among all these. The point is to see through viewing itself. When the viewer is seen as empty, all views—right and wrong, correct and mistaken—are simultaneously liberated into their true nature.
PAGE 67 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa summarizes the classification of all views [2396-2428], gathering them into two, then four, showing how the countless philosophical positions all derive from grasping at permanence or interruption.
"Extreme view" refers to eternal permanence [2401]—the belief in something that lasts forever, unchanging, truly existent. This is the comfort of the ego! You want to believe you have a soul, a self, something that will persist. You want to believe in a God who is solid and reliable. You want to believe in truths that never change.
"Extreme end" declares permanent is permanent, impermanent is impermanent—both [2401]. This is the attempt to have it both ways, to acknowledge change while still grasping at permanence. It satisfies the intellect but leaves the heart confused.
"Distant benefit": half permanent, half interrupted [2401]. This is the compromiser, the one who says "some things last, some things don't." It seems reasonable, moderate, balanced. But it is still dualistic grasping!
"Indifference": completely interrupted [2401]. This is nihilism—the belief that nothing lasts, nothing matters, everything ends in annihilation. This is despair, the rejection of all meaning, the denial of continuity.
These four gather into permanence and interruption [2401-2421]. And these two are the fundamental error! The mind that divides reality into existing and not-existing, into lasting and ceasing, into being and non-being—this is the mind that suffers. For what exists can be lost. What does not exist can be regretted. What lasts must end. What ceases might have continued.
The Buddha's teaching transcends both! Not by mixing them, not by finding a middle point between them, but by seeing through the one who holds them. Who is it that believes in permanence? Who is it that fears interruption? Search for this one, and you cannot find it. The searcher itself is unfindable.
Thus the purpose of teaching these views [2425]: not entering through recognizing wrong paths. But the recognition must be direct, not merely intellectual. You must feel in your bones the futility of all positions, the impossibility of capturing reality in concepts. Then, and only then, do you stop grasping at views and rest in what is beyond all view.
PAGE 68 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa concludes the explanation of outsiders' philosophical positions [2428], and now turns to the transcendent vehicles [2430-2474]. This is the turning point! Everything before was what to avoid. Now we enter what to practice.
"Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates" [2428]. This is the Buddha's compassion! He did not teach the wrong views to confuse you, but to protect you. Like a parent who points out all the dangerous animals so the child knows what to avoid, Longchenpa has shown you the philosophical pitfalls.
The transcendent vehicle is superior because of the four seals [2434]: all compounded things impermanent, all defiled things suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation peaceful. And because of refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha who showed the way, the Dharma that is the way, the Sangha that walks the way. These the outsiders lack! They have their gods, their scriptures, their communities, but not the Three Jewels that lead beyond all conditioning.
The essence of the transcendent vehicle: "supreme method of definitely exiting samsara" [2446]. Not merely improving samsara, not merely making it more comfortable, but exiting entirely! This is the difference between worldly and transcendent spirituality. One wants better circumstances; the other recognizes circumstances themselves are the problem.
From the Compendium: "mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—joy, happiness, bliss, accomplishing supreme virtue. This vehicle like space, a measureless great palace" [2446]. Space holds everything without preference. The Great Vehicle includes everything without discrimination. It is vast enough for all beings, all paths, all methods.
The nine vehicles [2475-2502] are taught according to faculties—listener, self-enlightened, bodhisattva for the inferior; Kriya, Upa, Yoga for the medium; Maha, Anu, Ati for the sharp. But do not think this means you must start at the bottom and climb! It means teachings are available for every level of capacity. Find where you are, practice accordingly, and progress naturally.
From Ati Kopa Chenpo [2496-2522]: "The Dharmas I taught from beings' mind stages, by differences of great and small, taught as two-stage method." The teachings emerge from the needs of beings, not from the Buddha's preference. They are skillful means, appropriate to the recipient. What matters is not which vehicle you follow, but whether you follow it to its completion.
PAGE 69 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa explains the nine vehicles in detail [2475-2538], and you must find yourself among them! These are not abstract categories—they describe living approaches to awakening practiced by real beings right now.
The three inferior vehicles: listener (sravaka), self-enlightened (pratyekabuddha), and bodhisattva [2476-2477]. These are the sutra vehicles, the path of characteristics. They emphasize renunciation, compassion, and the gradual cultivation of merit and wisdom. If your mind is drawn to systematic practice, to step-by-step progress, to clear stages and measurable attainments—these paths are for you.
The three medium vehicles: Kriya, Upa (Charya), and Yoga [2478-2479]. These are the outer tantras, the path of transformation through ritual and visualization. Kriya emphasizes purity and cleanliness, maintaining distance from the deity. Upa brings deity and practitioner closer. Yoga unites them in meditation. If you are drawn to ritual, to mantra, to working with energy and channels—these paths call to you.
The three great vehicles: Maha, Anu, and Ati Yoga [2480-2481]. These are the inner tantras, the path of direct recognition. Maha Yoga works with the generation stage, creating the mandala through visualization. Anu Yoga works with the completion stage, the subtle body practices. Ati Yoga—Dzogchen—is the direct recognition of the nature of mind itself, beyond all fabrication.
But hear this: the vehicles are not hierarchical in the sense that higher is better! They are hierarchical in the sense of directness. A humble practitioner of the listener vehicle who genuinely practices may be closer to awakening than a Dzogchen practitioner who merely thinks they are supreme.
From Ati Kopa Chenpo [2496-2522]: "Inverted and correct view. By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara. Correct: three stages—small mind and great, and thus medium mind possessed, taught as three-stage method." The difference between wandering and liberation is not the vehicle you follow, but whether your realization is correct or inverted. Correct realization sees through the self. Inverted realization grasps at something.
So do not aspire to the "highest" vehicle! Aspire to genuine recognition, whatever vehicle you practice. And if you are drawn to Ati Yoga, to Dzogchen, approach it with humility, with devotion, with the accumulation of merit and wisdom that prepare the ground.
PAGE 70 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa speaks of the very extensive Great Vehicle [2523-2538]—all the Word gathered in three baskets, the twenty-one thousand, the eighty-four thousand dharma heaps. This is vast! But do not be overwhelmed.
The three baskets: Sutra (the discourses), Vinaya (discipline), and Abhidharma (higher knowledge). These contain everything the Buddha taught, organized for study and practice. And the tantras—the manifest great, the secret teachings that reveal what the sutras hint at. All of these are medicine for different ailments, food for different hungers.
"Regarding each antidote taming beings' thought accumulations, extensively many, inconceivable, transcending expression" [2526]. The teachings are not arbitrary! Each one addresses a specific confusion, a particular obscuration. The Buddha was like a master physician, prescribing different treatments for different conditions. What cures one patient might harm another. What liberates one mind might confuse another.
The categorization into nine vehicles [2538] is not for the sake of division, but for the sake of clarity. Just as a library organizes books so you can find what you need, the vehicles organize the teachings so you can find what suits your mind. But do not mistake the organization for the reality! The Dharma is one taste—liberation. The vehicles are fingers pointing at that moon.
The hearer vehicle explained in five aspects: essence, definition, purpose, fruit, and division [2538]. This systematic presentation is characteristic of Longchenpa's scholarship—thorough, comprehensive, leaving no room for confusion. But scholarship alone does not liberate! You must take these teachings into practice, into your life, into your very being.
The Vaibhasika and Sautrantika divisions [2538]—these are not merely historical schools. They represent approaches to understanding that are still present today. The analytical mind that wants to break everything down into parts (Vaibhasika) versus the fluid mind that sees everything as process (Sautrantika). Both have value. Both have limitations.
What matters is not which school you belong to, but whether you practice genuinely, whether you apply the teachings to transform your mind. A simple practitioner who meditates daily is superior to a scholar who knows all the classifications but does not practice.
PAGE 71 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa details the Vaibhasika and Sautrantika views [2549-2597], and you must appreciate their rigor! These are not primitive philosophies to be dismissed—they are sophisticated attempts to understand reality, and they contain important insights.
The Vaibhasikas accept partless dust-atoms and partless instants [2549]—the fundamental building blocks of reality. They analyze the person and find no self in the aggregates, elements, or sense-bases. This is a huge accomplishment! Most beings never question the self at all. The Vaibhasikas use analysis to see through the gross illusion of a permanent, unitary, independent self.
Yet they stop there. They accept dharma-self—the atoms, the moments, the dharmas themselves—as real. This is like cleaning one room while leaving another dirty. They have seen through the person, but not through phenomena themselves. They still grasp at the building blocks of existence.
The Sautrantikas go further [2580]. They realize that even atoms are conceptual imputations, that the stream of consciousness is more fundamental than particles. They emphasize direct perception, the immediate knowing of objects. But they too stop short, grasping at the moments of consciousness themselves as real.
Both schools cultivate the four truths [2549]—understanding suffering, abandoning its origin, realizing cessation, practicing the path. They know the twelve links of dependent arising. They meditate on the three marks of existence: impermanence, suffering, and no-self. They are serious practitioners, not mere philosophers!
Their meditation methods are precise [2597]: cultivate selflessness and illusion as general antidote to the three poisons; cultivate impurity and skeletons for desire; cultivate love and dependent arising for anger; count breaths for conceptuality. These work! They actually reduce affliction, actually calm the mind, actually lead toward liberation.
But their limitation [2597]: they still grasp at the antidote. They think "I am meditating on emptiness." They establish a subject, an object, and an action. This subtle grasping keeps them from the full liberation of the Great Vehicle, where even emptiness is empty, even the path is pathless.
PAGE 72 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa continues with the hearers' path in detail [2567-2618], and you must see this as a living tradition, not ancient history! These methods still work. These insights still liberate.
The realization of emptiness and selflessness [2567]—"cultivate, definite liberation, cessation, peace, excellence"—this is the core. By seeing and cultivating the three realms, abandoning the four hundred fourteen afflictions to be abandoned, the wisdom of knowing exhaustion and non-arising manifests. This is the foe-destroyer, the arhat who has conquered the enemies of affliction.
The path of cultivation [2597]: five paths arising in sequence, earnest doing. First, the general antidote of selflessness and illusion—seeing all as like a dream, a mirage, a reflection. This undermines the solidity of the world. Then individual antidotes: impure substances and skeletons for desire; love and dependent arising for anger; breath counting for delusion. These are targeted missiles, precise strikes against specific enemies.
And selflessness meditation [2597]: when object and object-possessor cease, when non-observing object is cultivated, dullness and torpor are abandoned. This is the subtle work! Not just meditating on a topic, but allowing the meditation itself to dissolve, the meditator to disappear, the duality of subject and object to collapse.
The faculties—dull, medium, and sharp [2607]—determine how quickly one obtains result. Some need many lifetimes of accumulation. Some achieve in one lifetime. This is not unfair; it is simply the result of previous cultivation. The path is open to all, but each walks at their own pace.
The hearers and self-enlightened ones attain the eight grounds [2618]: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, foe-destroyer; each with entered and abiding aspects. These are not titles to boast about! They are stages of irreversible progress toward liberation. Once you enter the stream, you will inevitably reach the ocean of awakening, even if it takes eons.
But remember their limitation [2611]: their path intellect is small, medium, or great, but they do not desire the Mahayana and mantra paths. They are satisfied with their own liberation, content to enter cessation without returning for others. Noble? Yes. Complete? No. The bodhisattva goes further, staying in samsara until all beings are free.
PAGE 73 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa continues with the hearer vehicle's meditation methods [2632-2669], and you must apply these! The Vaibhasika's view: aggregates, realms, sense-bases analyzed into dust atoms [2632]. This is not mere theory—it is a meditation instruction. Sit and break down your experience into smallest parts. Where is the "you" in all these parts?
The Sautrantika's view [2639]: recitation, hearing, contemplation, meditation—the three wisdoms cultivated. First you hear the teaching, then you think about it, then you meditate on it. This is the natural progression! Do not try to meditate on what you have not understood. Do not contemplate what you have not heard.
The four fruits obtained through fourfold contemplation [2669]: stream-entry, once-returner, non-returner, foe-destroyer. These correspond to meditating on cessation, origination, and the path. When you truly see that suffering can cease, you enter the stream. When you understand the origin of suffering, you return only once more. When you walk the path excellently, you become a foe-destroyer.
But what is this meditation on cessation [2647]? Entering the non-attached abode, first becoming accustomed to food free from concepts. This means letting go of attachment even to sustenance! Then samadhi, non-concept, single-pointed. This is the progression: first simplify outer conditions, then simplify the mind.
The meditation on desire's antidote [2669]: visualizing a white thumb-sized skeleton on your forehead mandala, accumulating white light-rays. This is tantra entering the sutra path! Working with channels, with visualization, with light. Then expanding—head, body, surroundings, whatever appears—all as white skeletons, three thousand of them. This shatters attachment to the body as beautiful, as desirable, as "mine."
And the meditation on delusion [2669]: red fire at the crown, clear and bright. Fire transforms, fire purifies, fire burns away confusion. Through this meditation, knowledge becomes clear and bright; mind itself is realized as empty. Delusion dissolves not by analysis alone, but by transformation through visualization and light.
These methods work! They have liberated countless beings. Do not dismiss them as "Hinayana" or "inferior." Practice them sincerely, and you will see results. Then, having tasted liberation, you can go further to the Mahayana, carrying your realization like a lamp to light the way for others.

Now Longchenpa turns to the self-enlightened vehicle [2700-2781], the pratyekabuddhas who realize without depending on a teacher in their final life. This is a remarkable path! Not for everyone, but for those of independent disposition, sharp faculties, and deep karma from previous practice.
The five aspects: essence, definition, purpose, fruit, and divisions [2710]. Their essence is partial self-benefit, realizing both half and complete selflessness without a teacher. Their purpose is medium enlightenment. Their fruit is the two foe-destroyers (with and without remainder). Their divisions: rhinoceros-like and crow-like.
The rhinoceros dwells alone [2710], meditating on dependent arising in forward order, realizing person-selflessness and outer dharma-selflessness. They see that atoms and particles have no inherent existence [2731]—this is huge! They go beyond the hearers who still grasp at dharmas.
Yet even they do not fully realize inner dharma-selflessness [2731]. They grasp at the consciousness that knows, the antidote itself, the meditation. As the Abhisamayalankara says: "To abandon grasping of objects, yet not abandon grasping itself—the rhinoceros-like path of support is to be known through correct summary" [2733]. This is their limitation: they free themselves but do not fully transcend the subtlest grasping.
The crow-like self-enlightened ones [2742] meditate on dependent arising in reverse order, going to charnel grounds and contemplating how corpses arise from death, birth, existence, grasping, craving, feeling, contact, sense bases, name and form, consciousness, formative forces, and finally ignorance. This is profound meditation! Seeing the chain of causation that binds beings to samsara.
They teach through bodily signs, not words [2742]. Like a solitary sage who simply sits in silence, their presence itself teaches. This is powerful, but limited—how many beings can learn from silence alone? The bodhisattva uses words, concepts, methods, skillful means to reach countless beings.
Both types attain liberation in one hundred kalpas [2739]—a vast time, but inevitable once the path is entered. They manifest enlightenment of knowing weariness and non-arising [2742]—the exhaustion of karma, the non-production of new afflictions. Noble attainment! But incomplete, for they do not return for others.

Longchenpa details the self-enlightened path further [2726-2781], and you must appreciate its rigor! The distinction between person-self and dharma-self [2726] is crucial here. Person-self: the grasping at "I" and "mine" on the five aggregates. Dharma-self: the grasping at atoms, at moments, at the antidote consciousness as real.
Arya hearers realize person-selflessness but not dharma-selflessness [2731]. They see no self in the aggregates, but they still think aggregates themselves are real. Self-enlightened ones realize outer dharma-grasping is non-existent—atoms are empty, particles are conceptual—but they do not realize non-grasping itself is also empty. They still hold to the mind that knows.
This is subtle! The difference between seeing through outer objects and seeing through inner consciousness. It is like cleaning the window so clearly you forget the glass itself is still there, still slightly obscuring. The bodhisattva's wisdom goes further, seeing that even the clarity, even the knowing, even the emptiness itself is empty.
The meditation on the eight unpleasant objects [2781]—the blue, red, remaining, swollen, worm-entered, scattered, white corpses—this is powerful antidote to attachment! You cling to this body as beautiful, as desirable, as "mine." But look at it after death! This is what awaits. The worms do not discriminate between beautiful and ugly. Decay does not respect your vanity.
These meditations are not morbid; they are liberating! When you truly see the body's nature—impermanent, impure, suffering, not-self—attachment naturally loosens. You do not have to force renunciation; it arises spontaneously from clear seeing.
"Without listening or hearing, therefore called the self-enlightened vehicle" [2781]. In their final life, they do not depend on a teacher. They realize through their own power, their own insight, their own meditation. This is possible because of vast previous cultivation—a hundred kalpas of accumulation [2739]! Do not think you can skip the preparation. Their independence is earned through eons of dependence on teachers in previous lives.

Now we arrive at the Bodhisattva vehicle [2787-2818], and this is the path for those who cannot rest while others suffer! The self-enlightened ones are like rhinoceroses, content with their own liberation. The bodhisattva is like a mother who cannot sleep while her child cries—compassion drives them back into samsara again and again.
What makes the Bodhisattva vehicle superior? Great compassion as method, and wisdom realizing both selflessnesses [2802]. This is the union that creates the Great Vehicle! Compassion without wisdom becomes mere sentiment, exhausting itself in endless worldly activity. Wisdom without compassion becomes cold isolation, liberation only for oneself. But together—oh, together they are unstoppable!
From the Ratnavali: "Emptiness with compassion as essence—this accomplishes enlightenment for some" [2802]. This is the secret! Not emptiness alone, not compassion alone, but emptiness AS compassion, compassion AS emptiness. When you see that all beings lack inherent existence, how can you not feel compassion for their confusion? When you truly feel compassion, how can you hold to views of their solid, separate existence?
"Through compassion alone, connection to existence continues until enlightenment" [2802]. The bodhisattva does not flee samsara; they transform it. Even after they could enter cessation, they choose birth after birth, appearance after appearance, because beings need them. This is not martyrdom; this is the natural expression of awakened heart.
From the Compendium: "Without method, separated from wisdom, one falls into the hearer state" [2802]. Method is compassion—the activities that benefit beings. Wisdom is the understanding of emptiness. You need both! Method alone creates virtuous samsara. Wisdom alone creates isolated peace. Together they create the complete awakening of a Buddha.
The essence of the Bodhisattva vehicle [2818]: "realizing all dharmas as space-like, and through great compassion becoming the supreme method or cause for vast conduct benefiting others." Space-like: vast, open, unobstructed, holding all without preference. This is the mind of awakening—spacious enough for all beings' sufferings, open enough to include all beings' joys.

Longchenpa speaks of the Bodhisattva vehicle's definition, purpose, fruit, and divisions [2818-2831], and you must hear this as your own call to awakening! The definition: "depending on whatever method, leading to the supreme great city of liberation" [2818]. Not just any liberation—supreme! Complete! The liberation that includes all beings, all qualities, all wisdom.
The purpose: "causing those with supreme minds to obtain Buddhahood" [2818]. This vehicle is not for the faint-hearted, not for those content with small results. It is for those who aspire to the highest, who will not rest until they have awakened completely for the benefit of all.
The fruit: "accomplishing the all-illuminating ground, the eleventh" [2818]. The ten grounds of the sutra path, culminating in the eleventh—the All-Illumination of Buddhahood. This is not a place you go; it is what you are, fully revealed when all obscurations are cleared.
The divisions: many, but here gathered into the general path of the Vehicle of Characteristics [2831-2838]. This is the approach through the two truths—conventional and ultimate—the basis of all Mahayana practice. First understand the two truths, then practice accordingly, then realize the fruit.
The conventional truth [2837-2866]: phenomena marked by characteristics that appear as objects of intellect. This is your everyday world—the world of tables and chairs, of pleasure and pain, of self and other. It appears real, functions reliably, but when analyzed, cannot be found. Like a dream that seems solid until you wake.
The ultimate truth [2867-2887]: the inherent nature of dharmas, the essence of emptiness, the peaceful aspect beyond elaboration. This is not another world, not a place you go! It is the nature of the conventional world, seen clearly. Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. They are not two separate things.
Your practice begins with the conventional—cultivating virtue, gathering merit, developing concentration. It matures in the ultimate—realizing emptiness, transcending all views, resting in non-dual wisdom. But even the ultimate is not a stopping point! From the ultimate, you return to the conventional, now transformed, now the play of awakening.

Longchenpa details the stages of the bodhisattva path [2889-2902], and you must walk these stages yourself! Whether you are householder or monastic, the path is open. The lay practitioner's vow or full ordination—both are suitable [2889-2891]. What matters is not the outer form but the inner transformation.
The ten novice disciplines, the two hundred fifty bhikshu precepts, the three hundred sixty-three bhikshuni precepts [2890-2892]—these are the foundation. Without discipline, meditation has no base. Without ethical conduct, wisdom has no ground. Do not think you can skip this! The great Dzogchen practitioners of the past were also great upholders of discipline.
Generating the mind of awakening [2893]—this is the entry into the Great Vehicle. Not just wishing to be enlightened, but wishing to awaken for the benefit of all beings. This changes everything! Your practice is no longer for yourself; it is for everyone. Your obstacles become opportunities to develop patience. Your successes become offerings to others.
The eighty-five training sutras [2894], the four establishments of mindfulness on the small path of accumulation [2895], the four right abandonments on the medium path [2896], the four miraculous feet on the great path [2897]—this is systematic progression! Each stage builds on the previous. Each practice prepares the ground for the next.
The five faculties on the path of heat and peak [2898]—faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. Like five roots drawing nourishment from the soil of practice. The five strengths on the path of patience and supreme dharma [2899]—the same five, now unshakeable, irreversible.
The seven limbs of the path of enlightenment on the path of seeing [2900]—mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, pliancy, concentration, equanimity. These blossom when you directly perceive emptiness. Not merely understand intellectually, but see directly, unmistakably, that all phenomena lack inherent existence.
And finally the eight aspects of the superior path on the nine grounds of meditation [2901]—right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration. The complete integration of wisdom and conduct, the fruition of the path.

Longchenpa speaks of the fruit of complete perfection [2903-2961], and you must understand: this fruit is not far away! The ground of All-Illumination [2905] is not a place you will reach after eons. It is the nature of your awareness right now, fully recognized.
The Dharma body for self-purpose [2905]—the empty, luminous nature of mind itself, knowing its own nature without obstruction. The two form bodies for others [2906-2908]—the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya, the compassionate display that spontaneously arises to benefit beings. These are not physical forms you will acquire; they are modes of your being when fully liberated.
Beholding all that is and the extent of all with the two wisdoms [2907]—the wisdom of knowing the nature of reality, and the wisdom of knowing its variety. You see emptiness and you see form. You see the ultimate nature and you see the conventional display. These are not contradictory! They are two aspects of the same knowing.
Working for the benefit of beings until samsara is emptied [2908]—this is the bodhisattva's endless vow. Not because samsara can never be emptied, but because compassion is inexhaustible. Even when all beings are free, the display continues, the play of awakening goes on.
From the Entrance: "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought, working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained" [2910-2913]. This is not poetry about some distant Buddha! This describes your own mind when fully recognized. You become a wish-fulfilling tree—whatever beings need, you provide. You become a wish-fulfilling jewel—whatever they wish for, you manifest.
The conventional and ultimate explained again [2918-2961]—the false conventional of imputed appearances [2924-2928], the true conventional of ten virtues and merit [2929-2935], the nominal ultimate established through reasoning [2936-2944], the truly mental ultimate beyond all [2945-2954]. These distinctions are crucial! Do not confuse them. Do not grasp at any of them. Use them as a ladder, then let the ladder go when you have climbed.
