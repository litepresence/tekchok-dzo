You who would take experience—attend! Lines 4319-4327: Body and speech slack, free from suffering. Awareness slack, five bodies arise. Awareness arisen, conditions cease. Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease. Thus indicated method's tantra. Self's tantra, unproduced and perfected. Indicating, thus method is. Dwelling in the stream, thus called tantra. Thus.
Body and speech slack—not tense, not controlled, relaxed. Free from suffering—when you relax completely, suffering has no hold. Awareness slack—don't try to hold awareness, don't grasp at it. Five bodies arise—the kayas manifest naturally.
Awareness arisen, conditions cease—when awareness is recognized, the conditions of samsara lose their power. Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease—the duality of external world and internal mind dissolves.
Thus indicated method's tantra. Self's tantra—your own nature, unproduced (never created), perfected (already complete). Dwelling in the stream—flowing naturally, like a river to the ocean.
Second, nature's tantra, lines 4328-4336: The meaning of basis, path, and fruition. From that same: Basis, path, fruition, determined holding, nature's tantra. Thus. This essence: Empty-clear awareness's essence, basis, path, and fruition gathered. Definite term: pervading all, accomplishing buddha-nature, thus called nature's tantra.
Nature's tantra—the tantra of what is, the fundamental nature. Basis, path, and fruition—three aspects of the same thing, not three separate things. Empty-clear awareness—empty (no form), clear (knowing), awareness (cognizant). Pervading all—present in every being, every phenomenon.
Divided, lines 4337-4346: Basis, Essence, Quintessence nature's tantra—three. Basis nature's tantra: the first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion—three. That too: essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent. Delusion imputed only, not experienced. Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear. Compassion all-pervading, manifesting, unceasing. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.
Three levels: basis, essence, quintessence. Kadag (ka dag)—primordial purity. Awareness, nature, compassion—three aspects of basis. Essence primordially pure—never stained. Delusion imputed only—not real, just imputed. Nature spontaneously accomplished—not made, not created. Awareness light-clear—luminous, knowing. Compassion all-pervading—manifesting for all beings.
Essence nature's tantra, lines 4347-4362: Primordial wisdom three-stacked, in the heart-essence manner, arisen—basis nature's tantra, that power, basis appearance, eye, four lamps arisen. The path's four appearances actually seen. Quintessence nature's tantra: Awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened. That too: essence empty, marks awareness non-gone. Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established. Empty self-appearance arisen, cut, cut-off non-existent. Empty-clear, indivisible—that awareness's quintessence. That too: measured, ripened, quintessence gathered, thus called.
Primordial wisdom three-stacked—stacked in the heart center. Four lamps arisen—four aspects of inner light. Four appearances—on the path, you actually see these. Quintessence—the most refined, the essential point. Essence empty, marks awareness non-gone—not that awareness goes away, but its marks, its characteristics, are seen through.
Clarity three and... [text continues]
You see, the tantra goes deeper and deeper, more and more refined. But all of it is pointing to what is already present: your own nature, clear, empty, aware. Do not be intimidated by the terminology. Look at your own mind—that is the tantra, that is the teaching, that is the path and the result.
Now drop all your books, forget every outline you've memorized. Here's the real teaching, stripped bare:
Wisdom doesn't come from reading. It doesn't come from repeating words like a parrot. Wisdom comes when you stop grasping with your intellect and just—see. Directly. Immediately. No middleman.
What do you see when you see directly? Not the three bodies, not the five wisdoms as achievements to collect. Those are like pointing at the moon and staring at your finger instead. No—when you arrive at the measure of the four appearances, you've gone beyond hoping for results.
Here's the secret, the unsurpassed one: the guru's blessing is what makes it real. All the scriptures point, but until your own mind turns and recognizes itself through the master's kindness, you're just collecting dust. That's the difference between study and realization—realization tastes like lightning in the chest.
Longchenpa lays out this vast Dzogchen teaching, and I'm about to make your head spin with the numbers: nine expanses, twenty-one thousand volumes, thirty-five thousand chapters, eight great sections, one hundred eighty sharp nails, fifteen hundred summaries, seven bundles of distinctions, one hundred two thousand enumerations, five thousand essential points, sixty-four hundred thousand ślokas, twenty thousand tantras with names affixed.
Stop. Breathe. Yes, it's overwhelming. But here's the point—all that staggering complexity is just one thing: mind, expanse, and instruction. Three doors. Three ways of pointing at the same vastness.
Mind Section: inexpressible. Beyond words. Dharmatā itself.
Expanse Section: view beyond negating, conduct beyond affirming. The open sky of what is.
Instruction Section: how to walk this path, how to recognize what you already are.
Five thousand tantras all pointing at this same truth. What's the use of so many words? Because beings need many doors. Some come through study, some through meditation, some through sudden recognition. The teaching adapts to the student, not the other way around.
But don't mistake the finger for the moon. All those volumes, all those chapters, all those sharp nails meant to pierce your confusion—they're just different ways of saying one thing: wake up. Recognize your own mind. That's it.
The rest is decoration.
You who would understand realization—listen! Lines 4393-4405: Realizing: entered the Buddha's tantra. Not-realizing: entered the sentient beings' tantra. Since that tantra itself is made the basis, the basis-tantra is established. The method-tantra too is this portion. That meaning itself is the basis for indication, so what is indicated becomes the method-tantra. Without basis-awareness as support, there are no Buddhas or sentient beings whatsoever. Those two who hold their tantras—regarding the tantra—that itself understood through entering: meaning realized—that is its purpose. Realized and liberated—that is its innermost result and fruit.
Two tantras: Buddha's tantra and sentient beings' tantra. But they are not different in nature! The basis is the same—awareness. Those who realize it are Buddhas. Those who don't are sentient beings. But the tantra itself, the nature itself, is the same for both.
Without basis-awareness, no Buddhas, no sentient beings. This awareness is the support, the ground, the basis of everything. Realize it—you are a Buddha. Don't realize it—you wander as a sentient being. But the basis never changes!
Such meaning, lines 4401-4405: If the guru's instruction does not indicate it, it is not realized. If indicated, realizing the indicating method: that is called the method-indicating tantra. That method transmitted one-to-one: thus called method-indicating. Through indication, rigpa must be seen—liberation itself must be gained.
The guru's instruction is essential! Without it, you might never recognize what is already present. The teacher points—the student looks. If the student sees, that is the method-indicating tantra. Rigpa must be seen—not intellectually understood, but directly recognized.
"Meaning unestablished anywhere, so no tantra"—if one thinks this, it is not so, lines 4405-4408. Since there is no awareness-continuum like that, meaning's tantra is properly imputed. The essence-nature tantra is awareness. Awareness's dharmatā seen directly: the continuum of one who has passed holds the tantra. Without the guru's instruction, not seen—transmitted through samsara, so it is tantra.
Some might think: if meaning is unestablished, there is no tantra. But this is wrong! The tantra is properly imputed because there is awareness. This awareness, its dharmata seen directly, is the tantra. Without the guru, it is not seen—so it continues to be transmitted through samsara, life after life.
The flower-nature tantra, lines 4410-4412: Four lamps: whoever sees and realizes dharmatā directly, that is rigpa—so it is the flower-tantra. Not seeing that, transmitted as the class of actions and kleśas—so also tantra.
The four lamps—inner light, lamp of the far-reaching water ray, lamp of the empty bindu, lamp of self-originated wisdom. See these directly, realize dharmata—that is rigpa, that is the flower-tantra. Don't see them—you remain in actions and afflictions, but this too is tantra, just not recognized.
The quintessence-nature tantra, lines 4413-4416: That practiced: essence condensed into quintessence—thus called. Seeing wisdom's appearance: since not destroyed in the three realms, it is tantra. That quintessence of indivisible space-awareness is also explained elsewhere among the seventeen great-secret definitive tantras.
Quintessence—the essence condensed, the most refined. Seeing wisdom's appearance—this is not destroyed, not lost, even in the three realms of samsara. It is always present. Space-awareness indivisible—this quintessence is explained in the seventeen tantras.
From the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras, lines 4417-4421: Buddha's all essence gathered, placed into all beings' hearts. That essence: the intestine-continuum. Since clarity not gathered, called "essence."
All Buddhas' essence is placed in all beings' hearts. Not somewhere else, not far away. In your heart, right now! The intestine-continuum—like the intestines, continuous, connected. Clarity not gathered—not collected, not accumulated, not made. Thus called essence—the essential, the basic, the fundamental.
You want to know how the teachings are organized? Fine, I'll trace the entire tree for you, from root to furthest branch. But remember—map is not territory. Don't get lost in the architecture while forgetting the building.
All those vast numbers from before—condensed down. Four thousand distinctions. Two thousand five hundred summaries. Eighty-seven sharp nails to pierce your confusion. Essential points of seeing, essential points of knowing—gathered as three emanations. Command and treatise. Tantra, scripture, instruction treatise.
And within instruction treatise: debate, establishment, intention, and the chief treatise of enumeration. Four more categories. Enumeration itself: meaning and instruction, abiding nature, established view's words, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa non-duality. Four again.
All of this boils down to three movements: essential points emanating, summary gathering, and pointing out directly to the essential point. That's it. One great summary of dharma, well explained.
Now here's where it gets interesting. Longchenpa shifts from the general structure to the specific—the unsurpassable vehicle itself. To understand it, you need two things: know the nature of the tantra section, and realize the definite basis that arises from that nature.
The nature of tantra? Three aspects: briefly show its summary, extensively explain its nature, and master the definite branches of explanation.
Six branches in total:
**Essence**: Awareness itself, brought to certainty. The great secret—nothing to add, nothing to remove. What you are, already definite.
**Definite terms**: These point to lineage. Lineage isn't genealogy—it's the living transmission of recognition. Whatever lineages arise, tantra names them. Tantra means continuity, unbroken from master to student. The middle way, no breaking, no gap.
**Divisions**: Meaning and nature—different categories for different capacities.
**Rising measures**: How the teaching unfolds, step by step, meeting the student where they stand.
**Examples**: Analogies, stories, vivid images—anything to crack open understanding.
**Validities**: How to test if something is genuine teaching or just intellectual entertainment.
Here's what all this organization is pointing toward: the tantras aren't arbitrary creations. They arise from the nature of reality itself. Each classification matches how mind naturally displays itself. When you understand the categories, you're not just memorizing—you're tracing the contours of your own experience.
Don't let the taxonomy become a cage. Use it as a ladder, then throw the ladder away.
The teachings exist to liberate you, not to make you a better scholar.
Listen, you who's drowning in words—there's the tantra of meaning, and there's the tantra of words. They point at different things. Don't confuse the menu with the meal.
**The tantra of meaning**—this is it, this is the real thing. Mind itself. Not mind as you usually think of it, chattering and planning. Mind as it is: naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought. This isn't something you achieve. It's what's already here, right now, underneath all the mental noise. Always present, always buddha, always tantra. The characteristic of enlightenment, holding you whether you recognize it or not.
**The tantra of words**—this is the transmission. Names, syllables, letters, chapters, the whole elaborate structure that points toward what words can never capture. Within this, two chief approaches: the creation sequence and the completion sequence.
The **creation sequence** unfolds through ten aspects. First, the basis—empowerment and samaya, the ground and the commitment. Then deity and mantra, the form you take in practice and the sacred sounds that guard it. Maṇḍala and offering, the sacred space and what's offered within it. Samādhi and conduct, the state of absorption and how you carry it into life. Activity and view, what you do and how you see. Ten complete—that's the creation sequence in a nutshell.
The **completion sequence** works differently. Eight aspects now: view and fruition, conduct and meditation, mind and wisdom, experience and instruction. Different emphasis, same destination.
And then the non-dual union—where creation and completion become one. Eighteen total aspects when you add them together.
But here's where it gets subtle: the **great perfection** doesn't add anything new. It shows what's already complete. The completion sequence with channels, winds, bindu—that's just describing the machinery. Then the great clear light wisdom—that's what shines when the machinery is recognized as empty.
Examples: like a warp threads, cloth—many causes, one result. Different words, one meaning. Words are threads. Meaning is cloth.
Valid: when the teaching lands in you and does its work. When words point and you recognize. When the basis is certain, no error, complete recognition—that's validity.
Don't get stuck in the architecture. The ten and eight and eighteen are doorways, not museums. Use them to go in, then leave them behind.
You who would know the tantras—attend! From the Diligent Meaning-Possessing Tantra, lines 4423-4425: All teachings' supreme essence: Dharmatā direct-path called. From the Vajra-Sky-Equality Tantra, lines 4427-4432: Basis, essence, flower: All Buddhas' nature-tantra. Supreme secret distinguished, essence gathered. This to samsara's far shore, like an arrow-shot person.
The supreme essence of all teachings: dharmata, the direct path. Not roundabout, not gradual, direct! Basis, essence, flower—three aspects of the nature tantra. All Buddhas' tantra. The essence gathered, distinguished as supreme secret. This takes you to the far shore of samsara—like an arrow shot, swift, direct, no hesitation.
From the Supreme Golden Light, lines 4434-4437: Basis, nature, methods: Relying, even to the Buddha-field, effortless, easy—so placed as tantra.
Basis, nature, methods—three aspects. Relying on these, even to the Buddhafield. Effortless, easy—not difficult, not requiring eons of practice. This is why it is called tantra.
The Determination of These Meanings. From the Pearl Garland, lines 4440-4449: Nature-tantra is this: Basis, essence, quintessence itself. Basis: essence, nature, compassion pervading all, arisen, possessing self-nature of three primordial wisdoms, primordially pure from stains, the unique one of indivisibility. All Buddhas' great secret. Kāya: perfected essence-awareness. Kāya's tantra: pervading emptiness. Clarity itself is self-appearance. Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature. Perfect essence's nature-tantra.
Basis, essence, quintessence—the three. The basis has essence (emptiness), nature (clarity), compassion (pervading all). Three primordial wisdoms. Primordially pure—never stained. Indivisible—never separate. The great secret of all Buddhas.
Kaya—form body, but here perfected essence-awareness. Pervading emptiness. Clarity itself is self-appearance—it appears to itself. Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature—even when there is no appearance, the nature of clarity is present.
Lines 4450-4457: All appearances are tantra, all interconnected and clinging. In the mandala of natural citta, unproduced, perfected—great essence. Thus, gathered: essence, since become life's breath of all. Explained as essence-tantra.
All appearances are tantra! Not just some special visions or meditative states. Everything! All interconnected, all clinging—wait, this is interesting. Even clinging is tantra. Even delusion is tantra. In the mandala of natural mind, unproduced, perfected. The essence, the life breath of all.
From the Tantra of All Buddhas' Blissful Secret, lines 4460-4470: All Buddhas gathered into one, all essences extracted, essence gathered—thus called essence, gathered into empty-clear awareness's essence. All Buddhas' great blissful secret, possessing basis, essence, flower, the very essence of all self-awareness. Called the Great Perfection's essence, renowned among other tantras.
All Buddhas gathered into one—one essence, one nature. All essences extracted, gathered—this is the essence. Empty-clear awareness's essence—the nature of your mind. The Great Perfection's essence—famous, renowned, supreme among tantras.
The secret tantra explained, lines 4469-4482: Scripture held by definite ones. Nature empty, all-pervading. That too: essence's nature. Essence gathered, three clarities. Three clarities, pervading cognition. Three confidences, three non-returns—obtain definiteness of unchanging essence. Three appearances, three emptinesses: Essence: pure nature. Established as tantra. Basis, path, result—held definitively: nature-tantra. Thus explained, tantra established. Established through natural descent. Thus called nature-itself tantra.
Held by definite ones—those with certainty. Nature empty, all-pervading. Three clarities, three confidences, three non-returns, three appearances, three emptinesses—these are the details of practice and realization. Basis, path, result held definitively—all are the nature tantra. Established through natural descent—not made by anyone, naturally present.
You who would understand the seventeen tantras—listen! Lines 4486-4497: From the single nature of basis-awareness, come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method. From nature: basis and essence. Three quintessences, though designated with five different names, are not beyond one meaning-essence. From that itself: From the distinction of the single basis's essence, are called method and nature tantra. Though they appear merely as designations, the essence: single basis, empty nature, are not different, have no variation.
From one basis-awareness, two tantras: indicated (what is pointed to) and indicating (the pointing). Basis and essence—not different. Three quintessences, five names—but all are one meaning, one essence. Single basis, empty nature—not different, no variation.
For example, a person, lines 4497-4500: If many names exist, however called, appears so, meaning unchanged, likewise.
Like a person called by many names—son, brother, father, friend. Different names, same person. Different tantras, same essence. Do not be confused by the variety. The essence is one.
Thus, lines 4501-4506: SECOND: THE WORD TANTRAS, EXPLAINED EXTENSIVELY. Three: Enumeration, Purpose, Order. Enumeration, Briefly Shown; Purpose, Explained Extensively; Order, Determined, Entered and Gathered.
Now the word tantras—how the teaching is expressed. Three aspects: enumeration (listing), purpose (why), order (how arranged).
First, lines 4507-4518: The self-arisen rigpa's tantra: shown deep and vast as an ocean of expressions. The vajra-sattva heart-mirror tantra: shown clear as the sun. The great dzogchen tantra of lion's power: shown overwhelming all lower vehicles. The glorious letterless tantra of the mountain-king: shown as the unchanging dharmatā. The beautiful-auspicious tantra of the wheel: shown cutting the wheel of delusion. The suddenly-sounding tantra of the key: shown opening all scriptural doors. The universal-goodness mind-mirror tantra of the sword: shown cutting wrong places. The blazing-lamp tantra: shown making the lamp's appearance empty yet bright. The jewel-spread tantra of gold-purity: shown as gold adorned with turquoise. The sun-and-moon-joining tantra of the mother-child connection: shown clearly indicating with faithful, definite words.
The seventeen tantras each have their unique flavor, their special emphasis. Self-arisen rigpa—deep and vast like an ocean. Vajrasattva heart-mirror—clear as the sun. Lion's power—overwhelming lower vehicles. Letterless—unchanging dharmata. Wheel—cutting delusion. Key—opening all doors. Sword—cutting wrong understanding. Blazing lamp—empty yet bright. Gold-purity—adorned with wisdom. Sun-and-moon—mother-child, clarity and emptiness united.
Lines 4517-4518: The introduction-adorning tantra of the mirror: shown applying meaning to the example of images within a mirror. The pearl-garland tantra: shown as instruction collected like a beautiful pearl garland.
Introduction-adorning—like a mirror reflecting images, showing how appearance and mind relate. Pearl-garland—instructions collected, beautiful, precious.
Each tantra is a door. Each tantra is a method. But all lead to the same place: recognition of your own nature. Do not prefer one over the other. Use them all as needed. Some days you need the sword to cut through delusion. Some days you need the lamp to illuminate the path. Some days you need the mirror to see your own face.
The tantras are not just ancient texts. They are alive, speaking to you now. Open them with devotion, practice them with diligence, realize them with confidence. This is the way of the Great Perfection.
You who would complete the enumeration—attend! This page continues the enumeration of the seventeen tantras, describing how each is shown, what its special quality is.
The introduction-adorning tantra of the mirror, line 4517: Shown applying meaning to the example of images within a mirror. Just as images appear in a mirror without the mirror being changed, so all appearances arise in the mind without the mind being stained. This is the nature of display—appearing, yet empty. Present, yet not real.
The pearl-garland tantra, line 4518: Shown as instruction collected like a beautiful pearl garland. Instructions gathered, strung together, beautiful and precious. Each instruction a pearl, the whole tantra a garland adorning the practitioner.
[Note: Page 116 appears to be a continuation of the enumeration from page 115. The liturgical text shows the listing of the seventeen tantras and their descriptions. The commentary emphasizes that each tantra is a unique expression of the same truth—your own nature, clear and free.]
The seventeen tantras are not different teachings. They are one teaching expressed in seventeen ways. Like one face seen in seventeen mirrors—each reflection slightly different, but all showing the same face.
Do not think "I will study all seventeen tantras and then I will understand." Understanding is not the goal. Recognition is the goal. The tantras are fingers pointing at the moon. Use them to find the moon, then the fingers are no longer needed.
But while you are searching, use every finger you can find! Read the tantras with devotion. Contemplate their meaning. Practice their instructions. Gather the accumulations. Purify the obscurations. And most importantly: recognize your own nature. This is the essence of all seventeen tantras.
Pay attention now. This section is about clearing, stability, appearance, and emptying—four movements in one process. The three kayas, phenomena that have ripened to completion. But don't imagine emptiness as nothing, cut off and barren. And don't imagine clarity as something gradual, accumulating piece by piece. The three are inseparable: knowledge without direction, entity without marks, self-aware ultimate. Cut free from the four extremes—permanent/impermanent, existent/non-existent, etc. This is the mind of body and wisdom indivisible.
**The three clear aspects:**
When outer realms appear, awareness doesn't disappear into them. Awareness appears as kaya—form that is formless. Dimension displays its colors. Sky and awareness, dimension and awareness—appearing as one, no seam between them. You see a tree, awareness is the tree. You see the sky, awareness is the sky. Not two things. One display.
**The three stabilities:**
Faith that arises like this: unshakeable confidence in the view. Not belief from hearsay—direct recognition. The stability of realm: whatever appears, you don't get lost in it. You're holding the object like something grasped in your nose, never forgotten. The stability of decision: confusion has ceased, the cut is made. You know. No more doubt.
**The three non-returns:**
Here's liberation: when samsara itself is seen as primordially buddha. The moment of recognition—awareness has no further continuum. No root left to grow back. Awareness-body manifests, and delusions transform into pure appearances. You see the same world, but it's no longer binding. Dharmata appearing as manifold—and you rest in that, certain. No going back.
**The three appearances:**
Dimension appearing without day or night, without the markings of time. Awareness appearing without the dimming that comes when you lose clarity. Dharmata appearing without change, without needing to become something else. Thus liberated: delusion's appearances are self-pure. No cause for samsara left. Conditions cease of themselves.
**The three emptinesses:**
Awareness without comparison—nothing to measure it against, nothing to call it by. Delusion emptied at its root. Mind without conditions—when conceptual thought has no fuel, the fire burns out. Light without coming-and-going—no origin, no destination, no middle. The elements' conditions are empty.
**The three tantras:**
Basis, essence, and flower-tantra—shown separately but they're one essential nature, just viewed from different angles. How do these three proceed?
Basis-tantra shows reality as it is. Buddha and all beings arise from that—so the outer tantra, the basis-tantra, is established.
Stop here. Don't move. The basis is not something distant. It is what you are right now, looking at these words. Recognition happens or it doesn't. All the classifications are just ways to point you back to this moment, this awareness, this clarity that needs no improvement.
You who would understand the scriptures—listen! This page continues the detailed explanation of the Atiyoga tantras, showing the depth and vastness of the Great Perfection teachings.
The liturgical text here discusses the various categories and divisions of the teachings, gathering them into systematic presentations. But remember: all these divisions are for the purpose of teaching. The truth itself is undivided, seamless, whole.
When Longchenpa presents these elaborate classifications—the Mind Category, the Space Category, the Instruction Category; the outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassable cycles; the four lamps, the four visions—he is not creating complexity for its own sake. He is providing paths for beings of different capacities, different inclinations, different needs.
Some practitioners connect more with the Mind Category—understanding that all is mind. Some connect with the Space Category—understanding the vastness beyond expression. Some connect with the Instruction Category—needing direct pointing-out and specific techniques.
There is no hierarchy among these. What matters is recognition. If you recognize your nature through the Mind Category, that is perfect. If you recognize it through the Space Category, that is perfect. If you recognize it through the Instruction Category with all its detailed techniques, that is perfect.
The danger is attachment—to the method, to the system, to the philosophy. You study the teachings, you understand the classifications, you become expert in the terminology... and you forget to look at your own mind. This is like collecting medicine but never taking it. Like owning a map but never traveling.
Use these teachings. Let them inspire you. Let them guide you. But always return to the essence: your own awareness, right here, right now. Look at it. Recognize it. Rest in it. That is the point of all these words.
The scriptures say so much because the mind is so stubborn. You need to hear the truth again and again in different ways until it finally penetrates. But once recognized, all the words are seen as the display of that recognition. They do not contradict each other; they illuminate each other.
