You who would know the vast expanse—attend! Lines 3797-3807: The essence of the Infinite Space expanse, when appearing to the mind, is known. When not appearing, it is known by the mode of abiding. When divided, there are three: The Outer Infinite Space free from action; The Inner Infinite Space of the view's own position; The Secret Infinite Space of radiance and obstacle-removal; The Infinite Space of that-which-is itself.
The first, lines 3805-3808: Through causelessness, no reversal—this is the key point. Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed—this is the key point. Through the absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nowhere established—this is the key point. Also, through uncontrivance toward the mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcending non-samsāra.
Causelessness! No reversal! Whatever appears is unharmed—nothing can damage it, nothing can stain it. Samsara and nirvana are nowhere established because there is no cause and no condition for them. This is not mere philosophy—it is your direct experience when you look without concepts.
The space free from action, lines 3838-3840: Through non-doing, is liberated into the dharmatā of self-liberation. Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation. Thus it is said.
Non-doing! Liberation through not doing anything. Not that you must stop acting in the world—you can act, speak, think—but the liberation itself is not something you do. It is the nature of things. Like space—does space do anything to accommodate forms? It simply is.
The space of ornament, lines 3842-3843: Appearance is the continuity of mind. The ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty, so it is called. Appearance is the continuity of mind—all these forms, sounds, thoughts, they are like ornaments decorating the expanse of mind. But they are free from grasping—they do not stick, they do not bind.
Furthermore, lines 3845-3846: Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived. Thus it is said. Non-arising, non-ceasing—where can you conceive of this? Not in thought, not in concept. Only in direct recognition.
The space of play, lines 3848-3849: The play without direction, unceasing, arises. The transformation of appearance and mind does not occur, so it is called. The play without direction—manifestation appearing everywhere, without a center, without a goal. Unceasing. And here is the crucial point: transformation of appearance and mind does not occur. You do not need to transform impure appearance into pure appearance. You recognize that transformation is not necessary—that very recognition is the pure appearance!
The space of dharmatā, lines 3854-3855: Abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not. The basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing and knowing are non-dual. Abiding uncontrived—not made, not fabricated. Self-arisen—not created by anyone. Whatever arises is not—it has no true existence. The basis is uncontrived emptiness. And seeing and knowing are non-dual—the subject and object are one.
Furthermore, lines 3857-3858: The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond all. Thus it is said. The peak of emptiness—this is not mere empty nothingness. It is the emptiness that is also clarity, also knowing, also compassionate display. Completely good, beyond all.
You who would enter the path of instruction—listen! Lines 3859-3864: The section distinguishing the threefold teaching—the supreme complete teaching of the path that is distinctive—is: The essential point of the path is the essential point of entering the essence, like a spark striking flint. This is divided into three: Taught in the manner of oral transmission; Taught in the manner of symbolic instruction; Taught in the manner of self-arisen tantric scripture.
The Instruction Category (Man Ngag Sde) is the pinnacle of Atiyoga. Three ways of teaching: oral transmission, symbolic instruction, self-arisen tantric scripture. Like a spark striking flint—instantaneous, direct, no gradual process.
Among these, the essence of oral transmission, lines 3866-3869: The path of action, beyond the intellect, is practiced. The division: The instruction that cuts the extremes of fixation; The two instructions that manifest the confidence of liberation and the purity of means.
The first, lines 3871-3877: At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, without relying—when distinguishing from the basis. Even the mere word of elaboration is not established. The elaboration of designation does not exist. In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter—so it is said. Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted. The ultimate meaning of cessation.
All-pervasive emptiness—not emptiness as a thing, but emptiness as the nature of all things. The path of everything rolling—manifestation appearing without reliance, without basis. Not even the word of elaboration is established. No designation. Dharmata has no letters, no words. Through actionlessness, cyclic existence is exhausted. This is the ultimate cessation—not achieved, but recognized as always present.
The second, lines 3878-3882: From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur. At the time of the three kāyas appearing on the path, whatever is not liberated does not exist. At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.
Transformation in mind does not occur—you do not need to change your mind into something else. The three kayas appear on the path, and whatever is not liberated does not exist! This is the key: nothing needs liberation because nothing was ever bound.
The essence of symbolic instruction, lines 3883-3886: Non-deluded, thought-free. Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping. Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping. When divided, there are two: The oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness; The oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.
Non-deluded, thought-free! This is the state of symbolic instruction. Not deluded by appearances, yet free from conceptual thought. Thought-construction's grasping ceases. Non-dual, free from grasping at essence.
The first, lines 3889-3892: Through the vital-point wind abiding in the channels, the mind's own diligence through instruction—from the very source of dharmatā, the activity of averting harm. Through that spreading, the essential point of severing the debate between buddhas and sentient beings. Through the wind vital-point descending into the body, the essential point of severing the connection between body and mind. Through the root wind exhausted in the extreme, the essential point of arising's self-liberation.
Working with the winds and channels—this is the subtle body practice. But understand: these are skillful means, methods to bring you to recognition. The essential point is always the same: self-liberation of arising, severing of artificial distinctions.
You who would receive the oral transmission—attend! Lines 3894-3896: Through the vast expanse's aspect—never departing anywhere—the pervasion and estimation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Through essence-grasping being free in dharmadhātu's emptiness, the estimation of phenomena's transformation. Through non-fabrication in the expanse, that-which-is-called self-arisen wisdom.
The vast expanse—never departing anywhere. Samsara and nirvana pervade it, are estimated within it, but the expanse itself never moves. Essence-grasping freed in dharmadhatu's emptiness—when you stop grasping at essences, phenomena transform naturally. Through non-fabrication, self-arisen wisdom shines forth.
The essence of the self-arising tantra's instruction, lines 3897-3901: All commands' source is clear in the arising ground. The unique is cut by the axe of distinctive knowing. Through non-duality in self-nature, the cessation of saṃsāra's reliance. Through characteristic not established as words or letters, emptiness is free from the ground of dispute.
All commands' source—clear in the arising ground. Your own awareness is the source of all instructions. Cut by the axe of distinctive knowing—this knowing that knows without grasping. Non-duality in self-nature—samsara's reliance ceases.
When divided, there are four, lines 3902-3906: Commanded in the manner of view's thorough investigation; Commanded in the manner of removing obscurations; Commanded in the manner of bringing forth the hidden to manifestation; Commanded in the manner of self-clarifying explanation.
The first, lines 3908-3911: Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground. Action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation. Through self-nature's emptiness arising in all aspects—action, virtue, and non-virtue not abandoned—buddhas and sentient beings do not exist. Through characteristic not established as words or letters, the dharma of all vehicles—through non-transcendence—is the essential point of the single sovereign's path.
Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground—this is your nature, free from all elaboration. Action free from good and bad—not that you become immoral, but that you see through the duality of moral and immoral. Virtue and non-virtue not abandoned—you don't reject them; they self-liberate in their own place. Buddhas and sentient beings do not exist as separate entities!
When divided, lines 3912-3913: The view clinging to appearance and concept—non-arising; The investigation of mind's realization—all doubts released—these are two.
The view clinging to appearance and concept is non-arising—when you look for it, it cannot be found. The investigation of mind's realization releases all doubts. Do not be satisfied with partial understanding. Investigate until doubt is exhausted!
You who would cut through all doubt—look here! Lines 3950-3955: Through self-nature without cause and fruition, without self-wish, there is no place to go. Through characteristic not needing familiarization, not depending on other knowables. Through the essence of the hidden and manifest being unobtainable, hope does not reach anywhere. Through self-nature without direction, doubt is nowhere. Through characteristic examined and not found, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten—so it is called.
Without cause and fruition—no karma to accumulate, no result to achieve. Without self-wish—no one who wants, no one who attains. No place to go—you are already there! Not needing familiarization—you don't need to practice to become what you already are. Not depending on other knowables—your awareness knows itself directly.
The essence of hidden and manifest is unobtainable—you cannot find it, whether you look for hidden secrets or manifest appearances. Hope does not reach anywhere—your wanting, your seeking, takes you nowhere because you are already home. Self-nature without direction—no path to walk, no destination to reach. Doubt is nowhere—when you look for doubt, where is it?
The root of samsara and nirvana is rotten! This is shocking, but true. The very root, the basis of both bondage and liberation, is rotten—meaning it has no true existence. Like a tree that appears solid but whose core is hollow. All your samsara, all your seeking for nirvana—built on a rotten root!
When divided, there are two, lines 3956-3958: Concealing one, revealing and emerging two; Concealing two, revealing and emerging one.
This is the play of teaching! Sometimes one aspect is concealed while two are revealed. Sometimes two are concealed while one is revealed. The teacher skillfully shows and hides to guide you to recognition.
The first, lines 3960-3967: If view and conduct are revealed and emerge, and meditation is concealed, that nature in union without beginning or end—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning and end are cut. That nature's two are not different—in the bindu without outside or inside, without dependence on characteristic—causeless openness. If conduct is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge, abiding in emptiness, purified through emptiness—so it is called. If view is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge, through grasp-free knowledge arising directionlessly, awareness without object, liberation beyond concepts—so it is called.
Three possibilities: view and conduct revealed, meditation concealed—nature in union, without beginning or end. Conduct concealed, view and meditation revealed—abiding in emptiness. View concealed, conduct and meditation revealed—grasp-free knowledge, awareness without object.
The second, lines 3968-3971: Concealing two, revealing one. If meditation is revealed and emerges, awareness free from aim arises—causeless fruition abides in itself—so it is called. If conduct is revealed and emerges, body cast to the precipice, mind sent to dharmatā—so it is called. If view is revealed and emerges, mind delivered to emptiness, body and speech brought to the essential point—so it is called.
These are skillful methods! Different approaches for different temperaments. But all point to the same: your nature, free from aim, causeless, self-abiding. Cast your body to the precipice—let go completely! Send mind to dharmata—recognize its nature!
Do not get attached to any one method. They are fingers pointing at the moon. Once you see the moon, you no longer need the finger. But until you see it, you need the finger—so use it skillfully!
You who would understand self-clarifying explanation—listen! Lines 3972-3974: The fourth: the essence of self-clarifying explanation—word-attachment's stream is cut, the established view does not dwell, the establishment is specially supreme. Self-nature not perceived, completely pure, primordial purity's dharmatā that arises directionlessly—so it is called. Characteristic not mind, self-pure movement, without done to the basis—so it is called.
Word-attachment's stream is cut—no more clinging to concepts, to names, to descriptions. The established view does not dwell—you don't settle into any position, any view. Self-nature not perceived—you cannot perceive it because it is the perceiver! Completely pure, primordially pure—never stained, never changed.
Characteristic not mind—it is not what you think of as "mind." Self-pure movement—moving spontaneously, without someone doing the moving. Without done to the basis—the basis is not acted upon, not modified, not achieved.
That divided, there are three, lines 3975-3976: Speaking in the manner of error's messenger... [text continues]
You who would receive the ear lineage—attend! Lines 4005-4009: Self-nature without multiplicity—dharmatā beyond the words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading. Characteristic: pointed out, the cord of confidence is cut. That divided, there are two: The ear lineage and The explanation lineage.
Self-nature without multiplicity—only one, not many. Dharmata beyond all conceptual elaboration—cannot be captured in words. All-pervading—present everywhere, in everything. The cord of confidence is cut—not that you lose confidence, but that the artificial confidence based on concepts falls away. True confidence is beyond proof or disproof.
The essence of the ear lineage, lines 4010-4014: Connected one-to-one, especially near itself. That too: self-nature connected to the ear faculty, without interruption by others. Characteristic: without wavering, with confidence and the certainty of liberation. Divided into many: with syllables and without syllables—the ear lineage of dharmatā's meaning and instruction.
Connected one-to-one—direct transmission from teacher to student. Especially near itself—the teaching is not about something far away; it is about your own nature, closest to you. Without interruption by others—direct, immediate. Without wavering—stable, certain.
With syllables and without syllables—some teachings use words, some go beyond words. Both are the ear lineage. Do not think only silent meditation is the truth. Words can point; silence can reveal. Both are necessary, both are methods.
The essence of the explanation lineage, lines 4015-4019: Dharmatā without action, without cause, without basis to reverse the three realms. Self-nature: Clear light without stain, knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms. Characteristic: beyond thought and investigation, dwelling in the intention of the three bodies possessing the five wisdoms.
Dharmata without action—you don't do anything to it. Without cause—it is not produced. Without basis to reverse the three realms—you don't need to reject samsara to realize it. Clear light without stain—your nature is luminous, pure. Knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms—this clear light is not blank; it knows, it discerns, it is wisdom.
Beyond thought and investigation—you cannot think your way to it. Dwelling in the intention of the three kayas possessing the five wisdoms—the natural state is already complete with all qualities. You don't add them; you recognize them.
You who would know the cycles of teaching—look! Lines 4020-4024: Divided, there are four: The outer cycle; The inner cycle; The secret cycle; The unsurpassable secret cycle.
Four cycles of the explanation lineage. Like four concentric circles, each deeper than the last. Or like peeling an onion—each layer reveals another, until you reach the heart.
The essence of the outer cycle, lines 4025-4028: Without abandoning afflictions, the five poisons dwell as path-vehicles. Self-nature without effort or establishment—whatever appears arises as dharmatā. Characteristic without parts—emptiness nowhere divided.
Without abandoning afflictions—you don't need to get rid of your anger, desire, ignorance. The five poisons dwell as path-vehicles—they are the very fuel for liberation! Self-nature without effort—you don't work at this. Whatever appears arises as dharmata—naturally, spontaneously. Characteristic without parts—emptiness is not divided into pieces; it is whole, complete.
The essence of the inner cycle, lines 4029-4033: Not possessing form, the markless dharmatā. Self-nature without coming or going, the wisdom always dwelling at all times. Characteristic: from the aspect of solidity, arising like a root; from the aspect of twisting, arising like a trunk; from the aspect of clarity, arising like a flower; from the aspect of ripening, arising like a fruit.
Not possessing form—dharmata has no shape, no color, no size. Markless—no signs to identify it. Without coming or going—it does not arrive from somewhere or depart to somewhere. Always dwelling at all times—not sometimes present, sometimes absent. Always!
The characteristic described through the tree metaphor: solidity like a root (grounded), twisting like a trunk (dynamic), clarity like a flower (beautiful, open), ripening like a fruit (result of practice). These are aspects of your own mind's display.
The essence of the secret cycle, lines 4034-4038: Pointing out and realization attained simultaneously, depending completely on the three: hearing, contemplation, and meditation. Self-nature: breath cessation and buddhahood simultaneously, depending completely on effort, establishment, and familiarization-power. Characteristic: buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneously, depending completely on accumulation and merit.
Pointing out and realization simultaneous—not gradual, not step by step. When the teacher points, and you recognize—that moment is complete. Depending on hearing, contemplation, meditation—you need to hear the teaching, think about it, meditate on it. Then recognition can occur.
Breath cessation and buddhahood simultaneously—in advanced practice, when the breath stops, buddhahood is present. Depending on effort, establishment, familiarization—you must practice, you must become familiar with the nature.
The essence of the unsurpassable secret cycle—this is the highest, the peak, the absolute. It transcends all the others while including them. The essence of all essences. The nature of your own mind, completely naked, completely revealed.
Do not think these four cycles are separate teachings for separate people. They are one teaching viewed from different depths. Like a mountain seen from different distances—same mountain, different perspectives. Come closer and closer until you are the mountain itself!
[3809-3812] Now Longchenpa cuts to the chase. You've been studying all these vehicles—the eight, the ten, the hundred—but here's the point: none of it matters if you're still grasping at causes and effects. When mind is free from the sign of causality, when even the object of desire is seen as non-dual—there's your answer. No need to add another path on top of the path. The eight vehicles and their progressions? They're like learning more words for emptiness when you could've just rested in silence.
[3813-3818] Listen to this: the great perfection isn't something you accomplish. It's already complete. Self-arisen, self-manifesting, directionless—it doesn't need your effort. Everything appears, yet nothing is rejected. The basis of all phenomena? It's not somewhere else. Look—whatever you meet, that is it. Not beyond, not beneath. Longchenpa says even in India, dharmatā shows up in ten thousand forms. The view isn't hidden in temples.
[3819-3822] Here's where it gets practical. When appearance and mind are no longer separate—when you stop trying to make mind into something different from appearance—then the rays of awareness shine naturally. Not because you made them shine. They were always shining. The obstacle was your insistence that there was an obstacle to remove. Liberation isn't fixing something broken. It's seeing that what you called "samsara" was never separate from the dharmatā to begin with.
[3823-3837] Now Longchenpa gives you the dzogchen shortcuts: view beyond existence and non-existence, meditation without acceptance or rejection, conduct that doesn't cling to purity or impurity, result that doesn't grasp at attainment. These aren't four separate things. They're one taste. When you see your own face clearly—no helper, no helpee, no one doing the seeing—then bliss and suffering taste the same. Why? Because the one who would taste is gone. Threefold division gathered, but these are just ways of pointing to what's already whole.
Don't make these into a new practice. Don't add another technique to your collection. The instruction is that there is no instruction—only the recognition of what's already present, like recognizing your own reflection in a mirror.
You who would gather all into one—listen! Lines 4086-4097: That also gathered into eleven thousand chapters; That also gathered into twenty-two hundred ślokas; That also gathered into eleven thousand enumerations; That also gathered into two bundles of distinctions; That also gathered into five hundred summaries; That also gathered into one thousand essential points; That also gathered into fifty-one sharp nails; That also gathered into two emanations of meditation's presence and absence. And that, when made the vessel of the category, is called the Great Expanse's vessel, gathered into three categories. And that is gathered into the two: command and treatise. And those are gathered as the Mind Category.
All these numbers! Eleven thousand chapters, twenty-two hundred slokas, eleven thousand enumerations... Do not be overwhelmed. They describe the vastness of the teaching, the infinite ways of pointing to the same truth. Like raindrops falling into the ocean—all become one taste, one nature.
The teaching is gathered, organized, systematized for your benefit. But do not mistake the organization for the truth. The truth is simple: your own nature, clear and free. The organization is a method to help you recognize it.
The categories of the Expanse are gathered into three expanses, lines 4098-4101: The expanse of meditation's presence; The expanse of self-nature's non-finding; The expanse of characteristic's non-distinction—gathered as three.
Three expanses: meditation's presence (when you meditate, what is present?), self-nature's non-finding (when you look for self, you cannot find it), characteristic's non-distinction (no duality, no separation).
That also gathered into three thousand name-affixed tantras... [lines 4102-4113 continue listing numbers]
All categories of instruction also gathered into three expanses, lines 4114-4117: The expanse of play's non-cessation; The expanse of mind's non-liberation; The expanse of essence's non-good-non-bad.
Play's non-cessation—manifestation never stops appearing. Mind's non-liberation—mind does not need liberation because it was never bound. Essence's non-good-non-bad—beyond all moral dualities.
Those also gathered into twelve thousand name-affixed tantras... [lines 4118-4121]
You see the pattern? Everything gathered, organized, numbered. But remember: these are fingers pointing. The moon is your own nature. Do not count the fingers; look at the moon!
The Great Perfection is vast, profound, endless in its expressions. But its essence is simple: recognize your own mind. Everything else is commentary, method, skillful means. Use them well, but do not get lost in them. The destination is recognition; the path is whatever brings you there.
You who would understand the tantras—attend! Lines 4211-4218: Meaning tantra and word tantra extensively explained. First: two—Method tantra, Nature tantra.
Two types of tantra: meaning tantra (what is indicated) and word tantra (how it is expressed). Within meaning tantra: method tantra (how to realize) and nature tantra (what is realized).
First, nature, lines 4219-4223: Awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment. Definite term: that same indicating meaning and realizing basis and liberating method, thus called indicated method tantra.
Awareness pervading all beings—this is the basis. Not something exclusive to Buddhas. Every being has this awareness. The mind of enlightenment—bodhicitta—is this very awareness when recognized.
Divided, lines 4224-4231: Emptiness, Clarity—two. Emptiness: awareness's nature, all empty of things and marked dharmas, primordially dwelling in great liberation from elaboration's end. Clarity: That too, not gone to the extreme of emptiness, self-illuminating five wisdoms' appearance. Warm, cool, light. Vast nature's chief great elements five, primordially spontaneously accomplished. Compassion's tone unceasing, arising as capacity, awareness primordially pervading.
Two aspects: emptiness and clarity. Not one without the other! Emptiness is the nature—empty of things, empty of marks. But not mere nothingness. Clarity—the self-illuminating appearance of the five wisdoms. Warm, cool, light—the felt sense of this clarity. The five elements spontaneously accomplished. Compassion unceasing.
That too, lines 4232-4246: Awareness clear-empty great wisdom pervading all beings, called indicated method tantra. From the Pearl Garland: All buddhas' method tantra, from the distinction of one basis nature, indicated and indicating. Indicated tantra, one, all-pervading. All that connected to its trace, pervading aspects two: pervading by emptiness, pervading by clarity.
Clear-empty—both! Not just empty, not just clear. Both simultaneously, naturally, without contradiction. This is the method tantra, pervading all beings. One basis nature—all share the same nature. Indicated and indicating—the truth that is pointed to, and the pointing itself.
One cause of emptiness, without thing, lines 4242-4256: Beyond all things' dharma. Things empty, without appearance, one-pervading. Becoming the basis of all, one nature. Pervading lord itself gathered. Birthless, memory exhausted. From the distinction of nature itself, empty and appearing, appearing and empty. Things, without things, also are. Exhausted, primordially dwelling in emptiness. Cause and condition separated, emptiness's object. Pervading vast, without thing, empty by nature. Without stain, unmixed, perfect. Thoughtless, empty nature, pervading by emptiness, thus called tantra.
Birthless—never born, never created. Memory exhausted—not that you forget, but that the concept of past, present, future loses its grip. Empty and appearing, appearing and empty—these are not different. Things are without things—appearances have no true existence.
Clear, nature unceasing, lines 4257-4269: Illuminating appearance, all-pervading. Clear, warm, cool. Vast, moving, nature holding. Pervading, primordial tone, self-clear. Liberating, ripening seed. Reverse from emptiness, clear pervading. Instant, self-liberation. Self-arising clarity, body connected. Without stain, particularly clear. Graspless, clear object appearing. Five doors' knowledge, self-clear, perfect. Body clear pervading, thus called tantra.
This is clarity—the active, knowing, luminous aspect. Not separate from emptiness, not different. Self-clear—knowing itself, aware of itself. Graspless—without grasping, without fixation. Five doors' knowledge—the wisdom of the five senses, perfected.
Thus, lines 4270-4271: Second, indicating method tantra: three. Now the tantra that indicates—the teaching, the instruction, the pointing itself.
[3915-3925] Here's the punchline of dzogchen: essence has no dharma to hold onto. Even "buddha" becomes just a word, pointing at nothing you can grasp. The view and meditation aren't something you measure—they're the natural appearance of samsara and nirvana themselves. No characteristics to pin down, no positions to defend.
Afflictions? When you see them clearly, they release themselves. They don't need your rejection. Acceptance and rejection—both dissolve when there's no one holding either side. This is the path beyond paths: when the very idea of walking toward enlightenment is exhausted.
Longchenpa speaks of the "gtar-ka"—that membrane, that veiling, that translucent barrier between you and the view. When it clears, there's no longer samsara here and nirvana over there. The boundary was always just confusion. Clear seeing and the confusion it dissolves? Same energy. Not two.
[3926-3940] Now he breaks it down into view, meditation, and conduct—and you need to understand what "heat" (gtum mo) means here. It's not sexual energy. It's the burning intensity of non-distraction. When view becomes hot, samsara and nirvana fuse like water mixing with water. When you stabilize that heat, the distinction between them vanishes like an army dispersing.
For meditation: the movement is gathering—wind and mind condensing like entering a treasure house. The attainment is finding the path. The stability is empowerment itself—like a lineage holder receiving transmission.
[3941-3949] Conduct brings the outer display. When it's active, you see the knowing reach out like garuḍa spreading wings. When stable, the three bodies are fully present—not as concepts but as total engagement.
Notice the pattern: view purifies the view, meditation purifies the meditation, conduct purifies the conduct. No external antidote. No purification of something other than itself. That's dzogchen in a nutshell. You don't fix mind. You recognize mind never needed fixing. Whatever appears—mind doesn't conceptualize it because there's no separate mind to do the conceptualizing.
Rest there. Not doing view, not doing meditation, not doing conduct. Just resting in what's already uncontrived.
You who would be shown the path—listen! Lines 4272-4276: Nature: The instruction of indicated meaning, awareness, realizing method. Definite term: Self-dwelling awareness's wisdom indicating, as realizing method, gathering the key of experience, shown in one direction—thus called indicating method tantra.
The indicating method tantra—the teaching that points to what is already present. Self-dwelling awareness—you don't create it, you don't make it. It's already dwelling in you. Wisdom indicating—this awareness is itself wisdom, and it indicates itself.
Gathering the key of experience—through practice, through familiarization, you gather the key that unlocks recognition. Shown in one direction—not many directions, not confused. Direct, straight to the point.
Generally, lines 4277-4279: Explanation tantras: words long, difficult. Instruction tantras: words clear, easy. Great Perfection tantras are called instruction tantras.
Explanation tantras are lengthy, philosophical, difficult. Instruction tantras are direct, clear, easy. The Great Perfection uses instruction tantras—pointing directly, not beating around the bush.
Divided, lines 4280-4293: Showing effortless primordial liberation; Showing with effort through sequence—two. First: Cutting through the basis; The sequence of instant faculties; Primordially liberated, again without basis, etcetera. Second: the path of leaping over, the gradual faculties, relying on the key of channels and winds, making liberation. Three preliminaries, bringing to natural place, directly bringing to the self-key, until. Body key, door key, object key, relying on the key of wind and awareness, taking experience. Going to the measure of four appearances, showing liberation.
Two approaches: effortless primordial liberation (for those with sharp faculties) and with effort through sequence (for those who need gradual methods).
Cutting through (trekcho)—the basis, primordially liberated. The path of leaping over (togyal)—using channels, winds, drops, light. Body key, door key, object key—keys to unlock the body, the sense doors, the objects of perception.
Also from that same, lines 4294-4301: Those directly realizing, called method—also distinction. Person's intellect's difference, how the sequence must be explained. Without effort and striving, self-liberation. With effort, experience must be taken. Effortless ones are self-pure.
Difference in persons' intellect—some can recognize instantly, some need gradual training. Without effort, self-liberation—if you can recognize directly. With effort, experience must be taken—if you need to work with methods, channels, winds.
Key: through three aspects, lines 4302-4310: That meaning: taking experience. Body, door, object. Body's key: these three—Lion's manner, elephant's manner, like a rishi, must be known. Door: that same, unmoved, clarifying two, unmoved, sky itself unmoved.
Three keys: body, door, object. Body's three manners: lion (majesty), elephant (steadiness), rishi (simplicity). Door unmoved—sense doors not wandering, stable, like the sky itself.
Object's key: three aspects, lines 4311-4318: Pure expanse, dwelling. Thus awareness's nature, dwelling. All appearances, dwelling. Mind changeless, self-abiding. Mind changeless, memory clear. Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear.
Three aspects of object key: pure expanse (object is empty), awareness's nature (object is mind), all appearances (object is appearance). Mind changeless—this is the key! Self-abiding, not manipulated. Memory clear—knowing without confusion. Three bodies clear—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya all present.
Now listen carefully, you who hunger for liberation! The whole problem, the entire mess you're in right now, boils down to one thing—you're chasing your own tail and calling it enlightenment.
Here's how it works: ignorance isn't something foreign that invaded you from outside. No, you got hooked by your own display! The moment awareness turns back on itself, caught in its own reflection—that's when the knot tightens. That's ignorance's root. And it wraps around the three realms like a coil of rope.
But here's the stunning part—don't miss this—the very thing binding you is also what frees you. No need to import some external wisdom. Cut the root where it grows, and the whole tangled mess collapses.
Longchenpa lays out three ways to slice through this:
**First**: Cut error at its root. Stop trying to purify saṃsāra from nirvāṇa—that whole view is the disease. See that awareness itself, when left alone, self-liberates. Primordial purity isn't achieved later—it's what's already happening, though you don't recognize it. You're like someone searching for their spectacles while wearing them.
**Second**: Leave error to itself. Don't wrestle with it, don't battle your thoughts. Just recognize the dharmatā—that which is never not already pure. Ignorance's continuum is naturally empty. Actions and afflictions have no ground to stand on. The cord of your karma gets severed without you having to do anything special. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa? One taste. One ground. Stop pretending they're enemies.
**Third**: Emrace the basis itself. This is for those who still think liberation is something to achieve. The basis of falling beings is empty—not in the sense of "nothing there," but in the sense of nothing to fix. Self-nature beyond all calculation. Even the distinction between error and non-error dissolves. You're not becoming pure—you're recognizing that purity was never absent.
And here's the bindu point: all three paths point to the same essential fact. Stop adding onto what's already complete. You're not a project. You're not broken. You're just asleep to what's always been awake.
Wake up!
You who would take experience—attend! Lines 4319-4327: Body and speech slack, free from suffering. Awareness slack, five bodies arise. Awareness arisen, conditions cease. Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease. Thus indicated method's tantra. Self's tantra, unproduced and perfected. Indicating, thus method is. Dwelling in the stream, thus called tantra. Thus.
Body and speech slack—not tense, not controlled, relaxed. Free from suffering—when you relax completely, suffering has no hold. Awareness slack—don't try to hold awareness, don't grasp at it. Five bodies arise—the kayas manifest naturally.
Awareness arisen, conditions cease—when awareness is recognized, the conditions of samsara lose their power. Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease—the duality of external world and internal mind dissolves.
Thus indicated method's tantra. Self's tantra—your own nature, unproduced (never created), perfected (already complete). Dwelling in the stream—flowing naturally, like a river to the ocean.
Second, nature's tantra, lines 4328-4336: The meaning of basis, path, and fruition. From that same: Basis, path, fruition, determined holding, nature's tantra. Thus. This essence: Empty-clear awareness's essence, basis, path, and fruition gathered. Definite term: pervading all, accomplishing buddha-nature, thus called nature's tantra.
Nature's tantra—the tantra of what is, the fundamental nature. Basis, path, and fruition—three aspects of the same thing, not three separate things. Empty-clear awareness—empty (no form), clear (knowing), awareness (cognizant). Pervading all—present in every being, every phenomenon.
Divided, lines 4337-4346: Basis, Essence, Quintessence nature's tantra—three. Basis nature's tantra: the first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion—three. That too: essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent. Delusion imputed only, not experienced. Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear. Compassion all-pervading, manifesting, unceasing. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.
Three levels: basis, essence, quintessence. Kadag (ka dag)—primordial purity. Awareness, nature, compassion—three aspects of basis. Essence primordially pure—never stained. Delusion imputed only—not real, just imputed. Nature spontaneously accomplished—not made, not created. Awareness light-clear—luminous, knowing. Compassion all-pervading—manifesting for all beings.
Essence nature's tantra, lines 4347-4362: Primordial wisdom three-stacked, in the heart-essence manner, arisen—basis nature's tantra, that power, basis appearance, eye, four lamps arisen. The path's four appearances actually seen. Quintessence nature's tantra: Awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened. That too: essence empty, marks awareness non-gone. Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established. Empty self-appearance arisen, cut, cut-off non-existent. Empty-clear, indivisible—that awareness's quintessence. That too: measured, ripened, quintessence gathered, thus called.
Primordial wisdom three-stacked—stacked in the heart center. Four lamps arisen—four aspects of inner light. Four appearances—on the path, you actually see these. Quintessence—the most refined, the essential point. Essence empty, marks awareness non-gone—not that awareness goes away, but its marks, its characteristics, are seen through.
Clarity three and... [text continues]
You see, the tantra goes deeper and deeper, more and more refined. But all of it is pointing to what is already present: your own nature, clear, empty, aware. Do not be intimidated by the terminology. Look at your own mind—that is the tantra, that is the teaching, that is the path and the result.
