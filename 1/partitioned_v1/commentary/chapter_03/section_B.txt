Longchenpa speaks of the fruit of complete perfection [2903-2961], and you must understand: this fruit is not far away! The ground of All-Illumination [2905] is not a place you will reach after eons. It is the nature of your awareness right now, fully recognized.
The Dharma body for self-purpose [2905]—the empty, luminous nature of mind itself, knowing its own nature without obstruction. The two form bodies for others [2906-2908]—the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya, the compassionate display that spontaneously arises to benefit beings. These are not physical forms you will acquire; they are modes of your being when fully liberated.
Beholding all that is and the extent of all with the two wisdoms [2907]—the wisdom of knowing the nature of reality, and the wisdom of knowing its variety. You see emptiness and you see form. You see the ultimate nature and you see the conventional display. These are not contradictory! They are two aspects of the same knowing.
Working for the benefit of beings until samsara is emptied [2908]—this is the bodhisattva's endless vow. Not because samsara can never be emptied, but because compassion is inexhaustible. Even when all beings are free, the display continues, the play of awakening goes on.
From the Entrance: "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought, working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained" [2910-2913]. This is not poetry about some distant Buddha! This describes your own mind when fully recognized. You become a wish-fulfilling tree—whatever beings need, you provide. You become a wish-fulfilling jewel—whatever they wish for, you manifest.
The conventional and ultimate explained again [2918-2961]—the false conventional of imputed appearances [2924-2928], the true conventional of ten virtues and merit [2929-2935], the nominal ultimate established through reasoning [2936-2944], the truly mental ultimate beyond all [2945-2954]. These distinctions are crucial! Do not confuse them. Do not grasp at any of them. Use them as a ladder, then let the ladder go when you have climbed.
PAGE 80 COMMENTARY
Longchenpa explains the stages of heat, patience, peak, and supreme dharma [2960-2978], and these are signs you can recognize in your own practice! Heat is the first sign that realization is approaching [2960-2971]—like warmth before sunrise. You feel something changing, something opening, something becoming possible that seemed impossible before.
The outer heat: entities appear as empty [2964]. The world loses its solidity, its heaviness, its inevitability. You see through the illusion of substantial reality. The inner heat: understanding the pure knowable as empty [2968]. Not just outer objects, but inner knowing, the mind itself, is seen through. The heat of both: outer and inner recognized as one display [2969-2971].
Then patience [2971-2972]—not waiting, but bearing. You have seen emptiness; now you can endure it. You no longer panic when the ground dissolves. You no longer rush to reconstruct solidity. You can rest in openness without fear.
Then the peak [2973]—the highest point of worldly attainment. You have reached the summit of conditioned existence. Beyond this lies the supramundane, the direct perception of the noble ones. You are ready for breakthrough.
Then supreme dharma [2974]—the final refinement before the path of seeing. Your practice is pure, unsurpassed, completely prepared. The ground is ready; the seed of awakening will sprout.
The ten grounds [2974-2975]—from Great Joy to Cloud of Dharma—describe the maturation of buddhahood itself. Each ground dissolves deeper obscurations, manifests clearer wisdom. But these are not places you go! They are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely you have released the illusion of a separate self.
Then Longchenpa turns to established tenet views [2979], beginning with Mind-Only [2981-2995]. They assert appearances are aspects of consciousness, with no external reality. This is a crucial insight! But they stop there, grasping at mind itself. The Middle Way goes further, showing mind too is empty.
The example of the jewel in water [2984-2988]—the reflection appears, but is the jewel in the water? No. Does that mean there is no jewel? No. So with all appearances—they appear, but not as they seem. The Mind-Only view corrects materialism but risks idealism. The Middle Way transcends both.
Listen, you who wish to know your own mind! Longchenpa shows you something here that you have never truly seen, though it is right in front of your face every moment of your life.
Look at lines 2994-3001: The holding consciousness arises from mind. Just as an egg splits and life emerges, your perception of outer objects and inner consciousness arises from a single source. You think there are two—outer object and inner perceiver—but this is the root of your confusion! When you look at a mountain, where is the boundary between the seeing and the seen? Can you find it?
Consider the monkey in the fortress, lines 3004-3006. Your consciousness rushes through the five doors of the senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body—like a monkey darting through four windows, looking here, looking there. But notice: it is ONE monkey, ONE consciousness that knows all these objects. At the moment of knowing, can you separate the knower from the known? They are not different in nature—like a dream appearance and the dreamer, both undifferentiated in a single sleep consciousness (line 3008).
You spend your life chasing false aspects, lines 3010-3014. You think the outer world is truly established, but it is merely a mistaken appearance, a false latent tendency. What you experience as "truth" is just your own imputation. The meeting of object and consciousness is itself false—neither truly exists as you believe.
The ultimate truth, lines 3019-3021: Non-dual primordial wisdom exists with its qualities. Nothing is established as consciousness. The dharmakaya of the Buddha has nothing remaining. Do you understand? This wisdom is not somewhere else—it is your own awareness when you stop grasping at duality.
Like clouds that seem solid but dissolve when you fly through them, your thoughts and perceptions appear real but have no substantial existence. Rest in the open sky of your own mind, free from the extremes of existence and non-existence. This is not a philosophy to think about—it is your immediate experience, right now, if you would only recognize it!
Do not seek this elsewhere. Look at your own mind. What is it? Where is it? When you search, you find nothing solid—yet awareness remains, clear and luminous. This is the dharmakaya, plain and simple. Why do you wander in samsara when liberation is already present?
You who read these words—stop and look! What is this non-dual primordial wisdom that Longchenpa speaks of in lines 3022-3023? It is not something distant or difficult. It is the stainless suchness of your own mind, right here, right now.
You think that when slight stains of latent tendencies appear, like taste or sickness (lines 3024-3025), you are somehow polluted. But look closer! When mind is purified of the false part of affliction, what remains? The pure wisdom of the remainder manifests (lines 3026-3027). Like the sun hidden behind clouds—the sun was never damaged, never stained. Only your perception was obscured.
The Middle Way schools argue endlessly, lines 3035-3044. Some say all is illusion; others say nothing abides. But you—do not get caught in their net! Whether you call it illusion or call it empty, you are still playing with concepts. The reality itself is beyond all such names.
Look at the example Longchenpa gives, lines 3061-3062: When you awaken from a dream, the appearance of horse and ox stops. They were never truly there! So too with your waking life—all these appearances that seem so solid, so real, where do they go when you recognize their true nature?
The consequentialist Middle Way, lines 3078-3086, goes beyond all assertions. Not existence, not non-existence, not both, not neither. The wise one does not even abide in the middle! Why? Because the middle is also a concept, a position, a place to cling.
You want to know the truth? Stop looking with your intellect. The intellect is like a bird flying in the sky—it leaves no trace. The truth is not found by thinking; it is found by recognizing what has always been present. Like a mute tasting sugar—he knows the sweetness but cannot describe it. Your awareness knows itself, but words cannot capture it.
Rest in that which cannot be established by thought. This is the summit of the Buddhas' view. Not a view to hold, but a view that dissolves all holding.
Hear this, you who seek liberation! From the Ratnakuta Sutra, lines 3087-3091: The Tathagatas are permanent dharmas without birth. All dharmas are like the Sugatas. Childish intellect grasps at signs—you engage in dharma that does not exist within the world.
You grasp at signs! You see a form and think "this is real." You hear a sound and think "this exists." But where is the birth of these phenomena? Can you find the moment when a sound is born? When a thought arises, where does it come from? When it ceases, where does it go? You cannot find these things because they have no true arising, no true cessation!
From the Root Wisdom, lines 3093-3100: Whatever depends and connects, through non-cessation, there is no birth. Through non-annihilation, there is no permanence. Through non-coming, there is no going. This is the profound teaching of dependent origination and emptiness.
You think things come and go? Look at your own mind. A thought arises—is it coming from somewhere? It ceases—is it going somewhere? No! Like a wave on the ocean—does the water come from somewhere when the wave rises? Does it go somewhere when the wave falls? The water is simply water, moving in the ocean. Your mind is simply awareness, displaying its natural play.
Nagarjuna says, lines 3104-3112: If I were to assert something exists, then I would have this fault. Since I assert nothing, I am only without faults. This is the fearless proclamation of the Middle Way. You are afraid to let go of all positions, all views. You want something to hold onto—some philosophy, some system, some certainty. But the ultimate truth offers no handhold!
From the Refutation of Refutations: Since there is nothing to refute, I refute nothing. Therefore, it is said that one refutes. You have imposed that imputation. Your opponent says "you have a view, a position." But the one who realizes emptiness has no position to defend. Like space—does space argue with form? Space simply allows all forms to appear within it.
This great treatise—six collections of Middle Way reasoning—points to what cannot be pointed to. The three turnings of the wheel, lines 3127-3144, all teach the same truth: from the four truths to the characteristic-less dharmas to the ultimate distinguished dharmas. Do not think these are different teachings. They are medicine for different ailments, but the cure is the same: recognition of your own nature.
Stop philosophizing and look at your mind!
You who wish to cross to the other shore—listen! These treatises are without distinction of teaching and difference, line 3131. Do not get caught in comparing, in thinking one vehicle is higher than another. The truth is one; the paths are many.
But now Longchenpa speaks of the vehicle of tantra, lines 3132-3144, and you should listen well. Through the vehicle of characteristics, you must strive greatly with difficulty, accomplishing through great perseverance. But through depending on causes, mantras ripen results with little effort, attaining Buddha, surpassing!
You have been grinding away at the path of characteristics for countless eons, practicing the five paths, the ten grounds, gathering merit and wisdom. And this is good! But there is a faster way. Mantra: Excellent life alone. The intermediate bardo. Through least birth, through Buddha, quickly surpassing (lines 3138-3140).
What is this secret? It is not some external power or magic. It is the direct recognition of your own nature. While the causal vehicle approaches emptiness gradually, step by step, mantra shows it directly in one moment, surpassing through freedom from obstacles and hindrances (lines 3143-3146).
The causal vehicle speaks of expedient meaning and definitive meaning, of hidden intention and arranged teaching. But mantra shows directly—no hidden meaning, no gradual unveiling. It is like the difference between reading a map and arriving at the destination. The map is useful, but why not just go?
Briefly, lines 3147-3158: Accomplishing the meaning desired by the mantra vehicle through the causal vehicle takes many means, much difficulty, much delusion. But mantra surpasses through sharp faculties accomplishing quickly. Even if one meaning is the same, non-delusion, many means, no difficulty, through control of sharp faculties—the excellent mantra vehicle surpasses.
Do you have sharp faculties? Can you recognize your own nature when it is pointed out to you? Then do not waste time with gradual paths! If you see the sun, why light a candle?
The essence is the self-arisen wisdom, the expanse of clear light, the truth directly realized, the supreme secret means (line 3160). This is not somewhere else. This is your own mind, right now, if you would only recognize it!
You who enter the vajra vehicle—attend! From self-arisen awareness, the vajra vehicle has two aspects: the outer Muni tantra and the inner means tantra (lines 3166-3172). This is the great division that you must understand.
If you ask what is placed as tantra in mantra, line 3174: When the main person's continuum meets the clear light of expanse, it is called "thus." Tantra means continuity—the continuity of awareness meeting the clear light. This is not something fabricated; it is what you already are.
The outer tantra has three aspects: Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga (lines 3176-3179). First, Kriyā: Accomplishing through the three purifications and pure conduct as self and deity, master and servant, attaining accomplishment (line 3186). Here you see yourself as the servant, the deity as the master. You purify through bath, through changing garments, relying on the three whites and three sweets (lines 3191-3194).
But look deeper! Lines 3196-3205: Not establishing as true in the capacity of conventional appearance. Without abandoning form, not abiding in the extremes of one and many. Meditating on speech syllables and letters, all sounds become clear as deity sounds. The sound extent is no other than the deity of sound. Meditating on the mind's signs, all thoughts become clear as concentration deities.
What is this telling you? That deity and self are not truly separate! But in Kriyā, you maintain the appearance of separation while knowing the deeper truth. It is like a child and parent—the child respects the parent as master, but they are of the same family, the same nature.
The three objects of meditation—visualizing forms, statues, images—all appearances become clear as deity forms (lines 3197). Do you understand? Every form you see is already deity form. Every sound you hear is already mantra. Every thought you think is already wisdom. You do not need to transform them; you need to recognize what they already are!
But you grasp at impurity. You think "this body is ordinary, these thoughts are afflictions." This grasping is your only obstacle. Let it go, and the deity is already present.
The three purifications—deity and mandala, substance and enjoyment, mantra and concentration (lines 3218-3225). These are the doors through which you enter. But remember: the door is not the house. Do not get stuck in the doorway, endlessly purifying, endlessly preparing. Enter!
You who practice deity yoga—look! Lines 3206-3208: Looking at the aspects of self, speech, and beings as master and servant, obstacles cease and accomplishments are obtained. Depending on common accomplishments, conventional truth is not abandoned. Depending on supreme accomplishments, ultimate truth is not established—thus surpassing.
This is the key! You do not abandon conventional truth—the forms, the rituals, the practices. But you do not establish ultimate truth as something separate either. Like a bird flying through the sky—it uses the sky but does not grasp it as "mine." It flies without leaving a trace.
The main activity of visualization, line 3209: Meditating on deity through the generation and completion stages, the subtle radiating and gathering. You visualize the deity's form, speech, and mind as the collection of forms, sounds, and thoughts (line 3210). But here is what you must understand: you are not creating something that does not exist. You are recognizing what has always been!
Now the fifth vehicle, Upāya, lines 3235-3245: Since one desires conduct as Kriyā and view as Yoga, it is called the neutral vehicle. Through bathing and purity, making the three doors pure. Accomplishing the supreme mandala and so forth through the five manifest enlightenments. View as Yoga, conduct as Kriyā. Therefore it is called the both tantra.
You see the progression? In Kriyā, you were servant to the deity. In Upāya, you balance—conduct like Kriyā, view like Yoga. You are moving closer to the recognition of non-duality. It is like walking up a mountain path—each step brings you higher, closer to the summit.
The sixth vehicle, Yoga tantra, line 3246: Through the five doors of manifest enlightenment, viewing self and deity as brothers and friends, conducting samaya and purity. Now you and the deity are equals! Brothers, friends—not master and servant. You have realized that the deity's nature and your nature are the same.
The five manifest enlightenments, lines 3270-3276: Through sun and moon, relying on means and wisdom. Through the door of completely perfect form adornment. Through the wheel of syllables and letters. Through the vajra of mind, signs, and embrace. Through doors such as wheels and jewels. Through the door of completely pure primordial wisdom beings.
These are not just rituals to perform. They are descriptions of your own nature! Sun and moon—method and wisdom. Form adornment—your body as deity. Syllables and letters—your speech as mantra. Mind and signs—your thoughts as wisdom.
Why do you search for enlightenment elsewhere when it is your own face?
You who wish to know the highest yoga—attend! Lines 3278-3284: The inner five actions and afflictions are completely purified. The five secret objects and faculties are completely purified. The five families become Buddhas as one's own self. Meditating on commitment deity and self as brothers and friends. Knowing no good cause for deity. Accomplishment arises from oneself. Realizing no bad cause for self, now as clear deity form in the illusion body—surpassing the lower.
This is the yoga tantra view. You and the deity are non-dual! Not two, not one—beyond such concepts. The deity does not exist as something separate from you; you do not exist as something separate from the deity. Like water and wetness—can you separate them?
The established view of yoga, lines 3289-3309: The doors of entry are the five manifest enlightenments. The view of realization as deity and friend. Keeping the three samayas of protection without shame. Pure conduct neither refutes nor establishes. The five enlightenments are practiced: enlightenment through the door of seat, form, emblem, generation, syllables and letters.
The three shameless ones—what are they? Shamelessness through commitment deity, through master, disciples, and friends, through one's own mind (lines 3301-3304). What does this mean? In lower vehicles, you maintain shame and decorum—"I am the practitioner, that is the deity, I must be careful not to offend." But here, you realize deity and yogi are also oneself. Desiring the manner of brother and friend. Meditating on deity and mandala as non-dual with self.
Deity also arises from self and dissolves into self. Desiring the radiation and gathering of self and deity.
Do you see? The deity is your own display. The mandala is your own mind. You are not worshipping something external; you are recognizing your own nature!
Now the seventh vehicle, Mahāyoga, line 3311: The presentation of the mahāyoga tantra vehicle—surpassing the lower. Relying on the outer three and the five whites, etc. Conducting bath, purity, fasting, and dwelling, tormenting. Conducting the inner five meats and five nectars, etc. (lines 3314-3316).
The lower vehicles could not meditate on deity face union. The inner surpasses through ability. The outer does not realize the indivisible true view. The inner surpasses through realization (lines 3317-3321).
Here you enter the secret mantrāyana in earnest. The five meats and five nectars—substances the lower vehicles reject. Why? Because the lower vehicles are still caught in accepting and rejecting, pure and impure. But in Mahāyoga, you realize that all phenomena are the display of wisdom. What appears impure is itself the deity. What seems poison is itself amrita.
This is not a license for wild behavior. It is a recognition of the equal nature of all phenomena. When you truly realize this, you are beyond the duality of pure and impure. But if you merely pretend, you are like a fox wearing a lion's skin—dangerous to yourself!
You who enter Mahāyoga—listen well! Lines 3323-3327: The essence is the indivisible true, pure, equal primordial wisdom, liberation attained in one life through its play. The etymology: Accomplishing great purpose through slight effort—the inner means vehicle. The purpose: Obtaining the two accomplishments in one life. The result: Reaching the level of Vajradhara in this life.
This life! Not countless eons hence, but now! This is the promise of the secret mantrāyana. Do you believe it? Or do you think "I am not ready, I need more practice, maybe in a future life..." This is the deception of your own mind!
Divided: Mahāyoga tantra, Anuyoga scripture, Atiyoga instruction—three (lines 3328-3330). These are the inner three, the highest of the high. Mahāyoga emphasizes the generation stage. Anuyoga emphasizes the completion stage. Atiyoga transcends both.
In Mahāyoga, lines 3336-3361: Meditating through the three doors of concentration, the main means of the generation stage, on the indivisible true, great clear empty light primordial wisdom. The basis is the mind itself, ultimate, free from elaboration, great distinguished, without effort—the great itself. The basis to be accomplished, accomplishing—realizing near the mind's characteristics.
The three concentrations—the concentration of suchness, free from thought, crystal clarity; the all-illuminating concentration, meditating without distraction, clearly; the concentration of cause, meditating on the three-stacked being from Hūṃ (lines 3420-3425).
What are these three concentrations? They are the framework of your practice. First, suchness—resting in the nature of mind, free from conceptual thought. Second, all-illuminating—clarity, the radiance of awareness, without distraction. Third, cause—the generation of deity from emptiness, the play of wisdom.
But do not think these are three separate things! Like a lamp—its nature is fire, its radiance is light, its function is to illuminate. Three aspects, one lamp. Three concentrations, one wisdom.
The tradition of wishing the main accomplishment, lines 3362-3367: Accomplishing body, carrying to the path of Manjushri's mandala wheel. Accomplishing speech, making Buddha of the lotus family. Accomplishing mind, making Buddha of the heruka vajra family. Accomplishing qualities, making Buddha of the jewel family. Accomplishing activity, accomplishing Buddha of the karma family.
Each deity is a door to the same realization. Manjushri for body, Amitabha for speech, Heruka for mind, Ratnasambhava for qualities, Amoghasiddhi for activity. But remember: these are not truly separate. They are the display of the one dharmakaya, appearing as five for those who need such forms.
The essence of these: Accomplishing each deity through three concentrations without duality (line 3369). Without duality! This is the key. Not "I am here, deity is there." Not "I am ordinary, deity is pure." No! Non-dual means your awareness and the deity's awareness are not two.
Look at your own mind right now. Is it not clear? Is it not aware? This very clarity, this very awareness, is the deity. Why do you look elsewhere?
You who meditate on the generation stage—understand this! Lines 3384-3398: From the two upadeśas, accomplishing through the svātma upadeśa with mind as main and branches, accomplishing through the maṇḍala upadeśa with entry into mandala. The essence of these: Only conventional, in the correct conventional time, looking at the outer container world palace, looking at the mandala of supporting sentient beings as deities and goddesses. Seeing all beings as forms of deities and goddesses.
This is the vision of Mahāyoga! You look at the world—this very world, right here—and you see it as the palace of the deity. You look at beings—all these beings around you—and you see them as deities and dakinis. Is this madness? No! This is the recognition of the true nature of reality.
What you normally see as ordinary, impure world is merely your own obscured perception. Like a cataract patient seeing hair falling—there are no hairs, only the disease. Your impure vision is the disease; the pure vision is the cure.
Lines 3400-3411: In ultimate truth, no deity exists, no entities or signs. Only conventionally purifying aggregates and elements, dwelling in the mandala of deities and goddesses. The five aggregates, the five elements, the five objects, the five faculties—purifying the five afflictions, etc. Purifying meaning upon the pure expanse of basis nature.
Do you see the subtle point? Conventionally, you purify—aggregates become deities, elements become goddesses, afflictions become wisdoms. But ultimately, nothing was ever impure! The purification is a method, a path, a skillful means. The truth is that everything has always been pure from the beginning.
The three samayas, lines 3441-3448: Abandoning the killing of life through the body door, stealing and sexual misconduct, abandoning lies and slander through the speech door, harsh speech and idle talk, abandoning covetousness and harmful intent through the mind door, completely abandoning wrong view. Realizing means and wisdom as non-separate.
These are the root samayas. But understand: in the ultimate sense, there is no abandonment because there has never been impurity. You are not making something impure into something pure. You are recognizing that it was always pure. This is the difference between the gradual path and the instantaneous recognition.
The established view of mahā, lines 3414-3419: The door of entry is the three concentrations. The view of realization: Whatever appears, realize as deity. The root samaya: Body, speech, mind. The result: Means and wisdom, not separate.
Whatever appears, realize as deity! This is the heart instruction. When you see a form, it is the deity's form. When you hear a sound, it is the deity's mantra. When a thought arises, it is the deity's wisdom. Not eventually, after transformation—but right now, directly, immediately!
Why do you wait? Why do you think "after I complete my practice, then I will see..." No! See now! This very perception, if recognized, is the mandala. This very awareness, if acknowledged, is the deity. This very moment, if understood, is the great perfection.
You who would complete the path—listen! Lines 3451-3453: Eighth: The scripture anuyoga vehicle. Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual, free from elaboration, not abiding in any extreme. Accomplishing through the main door of completion stage wisdom.
Now we enter Anuyoga, the second of the inner tantras. While Mahāyoga emphasized the generation stage—visualizing deities, mandalas, pure perception—Anuyoga emphasizes the completion stage, the dissolution of all such constructs into the expanse of primordial wisdom.
Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual—what does this mean? The expanse (dbyings) is the emptiness aspect, the space-like nature of mind. Primordial wisdom (ye shes) is the clarity aspect, the knowing quality. These two are not separate! Like the sun and its light—can you have one without the other?
Divided: Scripture and sūtra—two, lines 3454-3459. The scripture relying on scripture, wishing the arising of mind and mind, expressing scripture. The sūtra, not wishing words and conventions as basis.
The great anuyoga vehicle of the extensive lineages, lines 3473-3492: Twofold aspect—expanse and primordial wisdom, desiring vajra of non-dual/non-separation. Entry through gate—instantaneous-by/with gradual. View-of-realization—non-dual/non-separation. What-is—instantaneous entry. Deities undeGenerated, essence recalled, by/with perfection.
Here is the profound point: In Anuyoga, you realize that expanse and wisdom have never been separate. It is not that you first meditate on emptiness, then on clarity, then blend them. No! They are primordially non-dual. Your recognition of this is the view.
The samaya of protection, lines 3484-3490: Secret mantra meaning-teacher always honor shall. Secret mantra teacher-of master-to, whatever-accumulated-by offering proffer. Master and thus such-one-gone, distinction-without one-of essence shown. Briefly: expanse and primordial wisdom. Great anuyoga established view.
The guru is paramount in Anuyoga. Not because the guru is some external god, but because the guru introduces you to your own nature. The guru points out what you have been unable to see, like a finger pointing at the moon. Do not mistake the finger for the moon!
Lines 3496-3512: The liberation basis is expanse and primordial wisdom. Created dharma and striving accomplishment and non-transfer, emptiness beyond thought, separation expanse dwelling, self-arising primordial wisdom by/with arisen. All dharmas basis-establishment self-liberation great-by realized. Effortless self-liberation expanse and primordial wisdom called.
Effortless self-liberation! This is the key phrase. In Mahāyoga, there was effort—generating deities, maintaining pure perception, practicing the three concentrations. In Anuyoga, you realize that liberation has never required effort because bondage was never real!
Like a rope mistaken for a snake—you suffer fear until someone points out "it is just a rope." Your self-grasping, your afflictions, your samsara—they are like that snake. Never truly existed. Effortlessly liberated when recognized.
You who would realize the unborn—attend! Lines 3510-3522: Arising as wisdom beyond view-meditation of limitlessness. Realizing all dharmas as equal in pleasure and pain. Called the sphere and wisdom of dharma-nature beyond action. Those gradually enter sphere and wisdom—abiding, empty, understanding bliss as entering. Called the union without superior or inferior, without acceptance or rejection.
What is this sphere and wisdom? The sphere (dbyings) is the empty nature, the dharmadhatu. The wisdom is the knowing quality, the awareness. These two are not different, not separate. Like a mirror and its capacity to reflect—can you divide them?
Through instantaneous entering into sphere and wisdom, lines 3518-3522: Understanding the self-arising dharma-nature as free from view, dharmas exhausted—called the cause-free liberation. Through entering liberation, understanding all that is, and that which is not—not abandoning all. Called the liberation where nothing is obtained.
Cause-free liberation! What causes are we free from? The causes of samsara—afflictions, karma, habitual tendencies. But these were never truly existent! They were like clouds in the sky—the sky was never bound by the clouds. When clouds dissolve, do we say "the sky is now liberated"? The sky was always free!
So too with your mind. Your afflictions appear, but they have no true existence. When you recognize their nature, they are self-liberated. Not transformed into something else, not rejected or abandoned—self-liberated in their own place.
The view of non-dual equality, lines 3523-3528: That sphere and wisdom are non-different, thus the view of non-dual equality. Without coming or going in sphere and wisdom. The view of not becoming other than abiding. Without extent or falling to either side in sphere and wisdom. The view of abiding from primordial wisdom. Called the view without reference point, single word, single reliance, without base or separation.
Without reference point! This is crucial. Most views have a reference point—some position to hold, some place to stand. "All is empty"—there's a reference point. "All is mind"—another reference point. But the ultimate view has no reference point at all. It is like space—where is the center of space? Where is its boundary?
Lines 3529-3533: The meaning sphere is the basis. Liberation through effort of beings on the path of wisdom. Sphere is cause, wisdom is result. Through the pristine sense faculties, liberation from outer action, cause and result without reference—surpassing the lower.
This is difficult to realize, extensively explained. Yes, because the mind wants something to grasp. The intellect wants to understand. But this teaching transcends intellect. It is to be recognized, not understood.
Ninth: The instruction of great perfection, line 3534: In self-arising wisdom, samsara and nirvana are not established. Wishing beyond wisdom, liberation, acceptance, rejection. This is not established anywhere. All-liberating wisdom does not cease.
Ah! Here we approach Atiyoga, the Great Perfection. In self-arising wisdom—this is your own awareness, naturally clear, naturally knowing—samsara and nirvana are not established. They have no true existence. They are merely labels, conceptual constructs.
Do not think "I must achieve nirvana" or "I must abandon samsara." These very thoughts are the problem! Rest in self-arising wisdom, and both samsara and nirvana are seen as the play of that wisdom. Neither accepted nor rejected—they simply are, as they are.
You who would enter Atiyoga—the Great Perfection—listen with your whole being! Lines 3597-3604: Ati's great array—from those-with-mind, mind's category; those-with-sky, space's category; those-without-striving, instruction. Mind-category, space-category, instruction-category—three.
The Great Perfection is divided into three categories: Mind (sems sde), Space (klong sde), and Instruction (man ngag sde). Each is a different approach to the same recognition, like three doors into the same house.
Lines 3605-3616: Self-mind not dharma elsewhere without various mind's category. These self-arising mind-primordial-wisdom-from other-than changed stopping intention-only. Dharma-nature all-good-one's space-from other-destination without speech space's category. These expressible dharma-nature's space-from other-arising stopping need-only. Essential-nature point-directly setting instruction's category. These essential not elsewhere widely meaning-from strayed stopping intention all summit's reached.
The Mind Category teaches that your own mind is the dharma—there is no dharma elsewhere. The Space Category teaches that dharmata is like space—no other destination, nothing to express. The Instruction Category points directly to the essential nature—no need to stray elsewhere.
What is this mind that is taught in the Mind Category? Lines 3618-3628: Mind exist—what? Mind-only meaning exist and non-existence stopping. Meaning thus mind-only-in not-established. Mind-on meaning-only-in also not-established. Various minds exist yet not-looked-upon. Mind-on cause and characteristic-in not-established various minds not called even called not-established.
External meaning's non-existence called even conventional intellectually examined not-established. That various exist nothing obstructs. Mind exist various also not-established. Great-perfection acceptance-rejection beyond called.
Do you hear this? Mind exists—but what is it? You cannot find it! You look for mind and find nothing. Yet nothing obstructs the appearance of various phenomena. This is the mystery: mind cannot be established, yet it displays all phenomena. Phenomena cannot be established, yet they appear. This is beyond acceptance and rejection, beyond existence and non-existence.
That appearance various-in appear yet mind-one's wheel-from not-departed various-in understood (lines 3629-3630). Mind-itself various-in understood called. Appearances appear as various, yet they never depart from the wheel of the one mind. The mind itself is understood in the various appearances.
Like waves on the ocean—the waves appear various, but they never depart from the ocean. The ocean is understood through the waves. The one mind is understood through the various appearances.
Second, mind's aspect exist speaking mind's category, lines 3631-3636: That also essence appearance-direction is. Mind-direction appearance is. Whatever appears mind is. Mind-itself self-arising primordial-wisdom-in arisen mind's aspect's play cessation without self-arising called.
Whatever appears is mind. This is not idealism, not a philosophical position. It is a direct recognition. Look at what appears right now—this form, this sound, this thought. Is it not known by mind? Can you separate the appearance from the awareness of it? They are non-dual.
The mind itself, self-arising in primordial wisdom, the play of mind's aspects without cessation—this is called self-arising. It arises spontaneously, without cause, without conditions. Not created by anyone, not produced by anything. Simply—appearances appear. Knowingly, clearly, luminously.
You who would understand the mind's nature—look! Lines 3636-3642: That-on division six: result mind's arising-place desired mind's direction; deviation-obscuration beyond mind's direction; reasoning confused compounded mind's direction; extreme-falling without self-arising primordial wisdom's mind's direction; direction-holding objects self-established mind's direction; established-tenets intellect-free distinguishing mind's direction.
Six ways of pointing to mind—six doors through which you might recognize it. The first, lines 3643-3649: Dharma-nature change-place without mind-on change without. Phenomena self-liberated desired made not-arose spontaneously-complete called unconditioned three-realms basis established samsara-on beginning without end. Final birthless spontaneously-complete basis-establishment called.
That also primordially-established without repetition. Self-established without antidote. Effort-without various extremes without spontaneously-complete called desired.
Dharrmanature has no place to change—mind has no change. Phenomena are spontaneously complete, not made, not arising from conditions. This is the unconditioned, the basis of the three realms. Samsara has no beginning and no end—not because it is eternal, but because it was never truly established!
You search for the beginning of samsara—when did it start? You search for its end—when will it finish? But these questions assume samsara is real! Like searching for the beginning and end of a dream. The dream appears, but has it truly begun? It ceases, but has it truly ended?
Second, lines 3650-3660: Eight-stages intellect-examined basis-from deviated dharmas called. Non-existence direction-falling spontaneously-complete on relying. Existence direction-holding extremes including deviated. Non-existence cause non-existence self-arising deviated. This desire word-only-in established essence intellect-and separation. Cause-conditions applied point-by unmade self-arising.
Unmade cause-less primordially-pure obscurations-and separation dharma-nature called desired. That also deviated-in dharma-nature-from departed place without. Cause-less result-from beyond basis is. Obscuration path-from beyond actions virtue-vice whatever-by stained without basis called.
Those who examine with intellect, who rely on the eight stages of reasoning—they are deviated! Falling into the extreme of non-existence, relying on spontaneous completion. Holding to existence, including extremes, deviated. Holding to non-existence as cause, deviated from self-arising.
The dharma-nature is causeless, unmade, primordially pure. Obscurations are separate from it—not that they need to be removed, but that they never truly touched it. Like clouds and sky—the clouds appear in the sky but do not stain it. When they dissolve, the sky was never not pure.
Third, lines 3661-3671: Mind's aspect definitely known samsara-nirvana source pressed called. Basis natural-state without arrangement. Self-arising mind-primordial-wisdom directions everywhere arisen self-nature that-from birthless. Actions virtue-vice without known.
Thus birthless mind-from appearances various-in appear because. Play cessation without samsara-nirvana's dharmas accepting without known. Thus play-basis's characteristic non-dual reasoning-by essence non-different known. Thus non-dual dharma intellectually analyzed not. Essence-itself self-liberated reasoning-by all dharma-nature beyond not. That also basis mind-itself unaltered reasoning-by deluded considered.
When you definitely know the aspect of mind, you have pressed the source of samsara and nirvana. The basis is the natural state, without arrangement. Self-arising mind-primordial-wisdom arises everywhere, birthless. Actions, virtue, vice—known without being anything.
Appearances appear from the birthless mind—why? Because the play has no cessation! Samsara and nirvana's dharmas are accepted without being anything. The characteristic of the play-basis is non-dual—its essence is non-different. This non-dual dharma cannot be intellectually analyzed. Its essence is self-liberated—all is beyond dharmata. Yet the basis, mind itself unaltered, is considered deluded by reasoning!
Do you see the irony? The very mind that searches for understanding is itself what needs to be recognized. Like an eye trying to see itself—it cannot, yet it is always seeing.
You who would be free from extremes—listen! Lines 3673-3679: Self-arising primordial-wisdom's play one-by samsara-nirvana all-on extreme-falling without pervaded. Appearances-imputed spontaneously-arisen cessation without lower-realms established without. Appearances essence different self-nature direction-tilted reasoning-from not-departed self-nature pure. Samsara emptied. Pervasion great-dzogchen view-from not-departed. That also existence-non-existence appearance-emptiness directions-in not-fallen. Action-free pleasure-pain beyond dharma-nature desired.
The play of self-arising primordial wisdom pervades all of samsara and nirvana without falling to extremes. Appearances are imputed, spontaneously arisen, without cessation, without lower realms being established. The essence of appearances is not different from self-nature—reasoning has not departed from pure self-nature. Samsara is emptied! The pervasion of the Great Perfection view has not departed.
Not fallen into the directions of existence or non-existence, appearance or emptiness. Beyond action, beyond pleasure and pain—this is the dharmata.
Fifth, lines 3681-3685: Mind's direction-on seeing without appearances samsara-nirvana-in not-divided. Objects all's object-basis-on direction-holding whatever not-abandoned. View action-effort without expanse-in dwelling. Whatever is not-is appearances various-in appear. Appearances vast directionless self-liberated action and conduct beyond self-liberated desired.
Without seeing in the direction of mind, appearances are not divided into samsara and nirvana. Not abandoning whatever direction-holding on the object-basis of all objects. Dwelling in the expanse without view, action, or effort. Whatever is or is not appears in various appearances. Appearances are vast, directionless, self-liberated—beyond action and conduct, self-liberated.
Sixth, lines 3687-3690: Intellect-without objects not-become. Appearances self-arisen concepts self-liberated. Appearances essence truth-falsity not-established. Existence-non-existence limitlessness-in dwelling truth-falsity whatever not-established desired.
Without intellect, objects do not become. Appearances are self-arisen; concepts are self-liberated. The essence of appearances—truth and falsity are not established. Dwelling in the limitlessness of existence and non-existence, truth and falsity are not established.
Thus mind's category-in 210,000. Space three, lines 3691-3692. The Mind Category contains 21,000 teachings. The Space Category—three. Lines 3693-3705: Dharma-nature expressible beyond expanse. View not without expanse. Conduct is without expanse. Sections six-hundred three-hundred. Emanations three: abiding basis-top-on striking emanation; appearance self-from liberated emanation; dharma-nature equal non-different without emanation.
Dharmanature is beyond the expressible expanse. View is not without expanse. Conduct is without expanse. There are 600 or 300 sections. Three emanations: striking on top of the basis of abiding; emanation self-liberated from appearance; emanation without difference, equal dharmata.
Dharma-nature penetrated without nails fifty. Object-mind-on applied breaths hundred eleven. Appearance-mind single-moment-in distinguished essential-points hundred-thousand two. View sphere-on applied hundred-thousand five. Meditation exists conceptualization cutting essential-points hundred-thousand one those-on named continuums thousand and three-in abide.
Fifty nails penetrate dharmata without being dharmata. One hundred eleven breaths applied to object-mind. One hundred thousand essential points distinguished in a single moment of appearance-mind. One hundred thousand five applied to the sphere of view. One hundred thousand one essential points cutting conceptualization where meditation exists. Those named abide in one thousand and three continuums.
Do not be overwhelmed by these numbers! They point to the vastness of the teaching, the infinite ways of pointing to what is ultimately simple: your own nature, clear and free.
You who seek to understand space—attend! Lines 3706-3717: Mind's direction grasping. Mind's category grasping. Mind's essential-point grasping three-in gathered. Second result primordial-liberation speaking great-perfection space's category's essence. Existence various-in arisen without result primordially-pure desired. This-on division four: space black causeless speaking; space variegated various speaking; space white mind speaking; space vast cause-result applied.
The grasping of mind's direction, mind's category, mind's essential point—these three are gathered. Now we speak of the result of primordial liberation, the essence of the Great Perfection's Space Category.
Without arising in various existence, the result is primordially pure. Four divisions: Black Space, causeless; Variegated Space, various; White Space, mind; Vast Space, cause-result applied.
Black-space's essence, lines 3717-3724: Unchanging self-perfect directionless arisen phenomena-nature-on not relying. Division activity black-space's category; compassion black-space's category; emanation black-space's category—three. First: Arisen various causeless arisen appearance signless appeared. That also arisen-place-from empty-on appeared liberated samsara-nirvana nameless. That also is-not extremes definitive reasoning-by great-perfection extremes beyond view established.
Black Space is unchanging, self-perfect, directionless arisen—not relying on phenomena-nature. Three categories: activity, compassion, emanation. Arisen variously, causelessly, signlessly. Appeared from the empty arisen-place, liberated, samsara and nirvana nameless. Is-not definitive by reasoning—Great Perfection view established beyond extremes.
Second, lines 3726-3729: Arisen primordial-wisdom is knowing other-on not relying. Liberated mind is cause-conditions applied. Arisen-liberated non-dual abiding result primordially liberated. That also similar-appearances self-pure definitive reasoning-by great-perfection appearance-from liberated desired.
Arisen primordial wisdom is knowing, not relying on other. Liberated mind—cause and conditions applied. Arisen and liberated, non-dual abiding, the result is primordially liberated. Similar appearances, self-pure, definitive by reasoning—Great Perfection is liberated from appearance.
Third, lines 3731-3735: Free from the extremes of is and is-not, beyond directional fixation, self-nature without reliance, causeless, primordially pure—beyond fabrication and correction, through primordial liberation the great expanse beyond extremes is set forth. The great primordial wisdom of self-purified abiding, liberated from the beginning, is called "the exhaustion of self-basis."
Free from is and is-not, beyond fixation, causeless, primordially pure—beyond fabrication and correction. This is primordial liberation, the exhaustion of self-basis. You do not create this; you do not achieve it. It is how things have always been!
This too, line 3735: Through the reasoning that engages deluded mind, is intended as self-liberation. Even the reasoning that seems to engage the deluded mind is actually pointing to self-liberation. Like a thorn used to remove a thorn—once the job is done, both are discarded.
The essence of the variegated space, lines 3736-3743: Speaking of manifold existence. Free from negation, directionless, self-arising everywhere. In spontaneous play, beyond affirmation and negation, this is intended. These divide into three: Assertion of existence corresponds to the Mind School; assertion of non-existence corresponds to the Self-Essential Point; assertion of both corresponds to Supreme Instruction.
Variegated space—manifold existence, free from negation, directionless, self-arising. Beyond affirmation and negation. Three assertions: existence (Mind School), non-existence (Self-Essential Point), both (Supreme Instruction). These are not contradictory positions but different ways of pointing to the same recognition.
You who would understand White Space—listen! Lines 3744-3763: The essence of self-purified abiding, nowhere divided, not established as affirmation or negation, transcends conceptual construction. Without duality in characteristic, it does not depart from the single wheel of mind's existence. Through that very activity, unceasingly radiant—it is called "the liberation of appearance and mind without duality."
This too, through the reasoning of thought-free self-nature, intends the primordial liberation of all phenomena, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated from their own ground. The second: Through the self-nature of appearance-emptiness liberated from its own ground, dharmatā of mind is radiantly displayed in manifold forms. Through liberation of non-appearance from its own ground, action is freed from virtue and non-virtue. This too, through the reasoning of transformation into emptiness, establishes non-appearance as self-purified.
The third: Through self-emptiness, primordially pure, not relying on action's cause and effect. Through fabrication, it arises; through arising as emptiness, it liberates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in all directions. Through appearance and concept as ground, the reasoning of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's non-establishment appears. Through inexpressibility, the essential point beyond thought; through being beyond comparison, the essential point beyond meditation; through liberation from the two of abiding and transformation, the essential point of mind free from transformation—through these three, the manifestation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's true form is intended.
The essence of white space, lines 3763-3768: Through the self-liberation of appearance and conditions, without fabrication, pure cause, not to be established in any mode of abiding. Divided—From action's vast expanse, the White Space of ineffable teaching; From the union of view and meditation, the two White Spaces.
The first, lines 3767-3783: The essence is liberated through direct seeing of the nature. The abiding is self-purified. When divided: Ocean Space and Sky Space—these two.
The essence of Ocean Space, lines 3772-3782: Eternally self-liberated beyond extremes. Liberated through non-action, it is liberation itself. Without the two extremes of multiplicity. These divide into two: Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space.
The first: Mind's self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated. When relied upon, mind-emptiness is thoroughly purified. The self-purified dharmatā of appearance-emptiness, from the beginning inexpressible. Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness's transcendence, it is empty—by emptiness, nowhere is anything established—this is the intent.
The Small Ocean Space, lines 3784-3785: Through self-purified reliance, the mind is without stain. Through the particular abiding in purity, conditions are from the beginning inexpressible—this is the intent.
The essence of Sky Space, lines 3786-3796: Dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated. When divided, these are two: Sun-Moon Space and Jewel White Space—these two.
The first: The essence is utterly pure emptiness. Self-nature unborn, primordially liberated. The second: Qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions self-purified. Through non-action toward the mind, dharmatā is spontaneously accomplished—this is the intent regarding causes and conditions.
Do you see? All these names—Ocean Space, Sky Space, Sun-Moon Space, Jewel White Space—they are all pointing to your own mind, your own nature. Not something far away, not something to achieve. Self-liberated, primordially pure, uncontrived. Rest in that!
You who would know the vast expanse—attend! Lines 3797-3807: The essence of the Infinite Space expanse, when appearing to the mind, is known. When not appearing, it is known by the mode of abiding. When divided, there are three: The Outer Infinite Space free from action; The Inner Infinite Space of the view's own position; The Secret Infinite Space of radiance and obstacle-removal; The Infinite Space of that-which-is itself.
The first, lines 3805-3808: Through causelessness, no reversal—this is the key point. Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed—this is the key point. Through the absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nowhere established—this is the key point. Also, through uncontrivance toward the mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcending non-samsāra.
Causelessness! No reversal! Whatever appears is unharmed—nothing can damage it, nothing can stain it. Samsara and nirvana are nowhere established because there is no cause and no condition for them. This is not mere philosophy—it is your direct experience when you look without concepts.
The space free from action, lines 3838-3840: Through non-doing, is liberated into the dharmatā of self-liberation. Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation. Thus it is said.
Non-doing! Liberation through not doing anything. Not that you must stop acting in the world—you can act, speak, think—but the liberation itself is not something you do. It is the nature of things. Like space—does space do anything to accommodate forms? It simply is.
The space of ornament, lines 3842-3843: Appearance is the continuity of mind. The ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty, so it is called. Appearance is the continuity of mind—all these forms, sounds, thoughts, they are like ornaments decorating the expanse of mind. But they are free from grasping—they do not stick, they do not bind.
Furthermore, lines 3845-3846: Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived. Thus it is said. Non-arising, non-ceasing—where can you conceive of this? Not in thought, not in concept. Only in direct recognition.
The space of play, lines 3848-3849: The play without direction, unceasing, arises. The transformation of appearance and mind does not occur, so it is called. The play without direction—manifestation appearing everywhere, without a center, without a goal. Unceasing. And here is the crucial point: transformation of appearance and mind does not occur. You do not need to transform impure appearance into pure appearance. You recognize that transformation is not necessary—that very recognition is the pure appearance!
The space of dharmatā, lines 3854-3855: Abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not. The basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing and knowing are non-dual. Abiding uncontrived—not made, not fabricated. Self-arisen—not created by anyone. Whatever arises is not—it has no true existence. The basis is uncontrived emptiness. And seeing and knowing are non-dual—the subject and object are one.
Furthermore, lines 3857-3858: The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond all. Thus it is said. The peak of emptiness—this is not mere empty nothingness. It is the emptiness that is also clarity, also knowing, also compassionate display. Completely good, beyond all.
