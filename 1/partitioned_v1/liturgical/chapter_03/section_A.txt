[1944] The Lokāyata school is:
[1945] From the appearing of the realms of seeing, hearing, pleasure, and pain as they are now,
[1946] Previous and future lives,
[1947] Actions, causes, and results,
[1948] And the existence of liberation and freedom—nothing at all is held.
[1949] This also has:
[1950] Two: the propounders of cause nihilism and result nihilism.
[1951] First:
[1952] Some, like the son of the naked one, say that the mind of before is not this current one.
[1953] There is a mind abiding by the self-nature of the four elements.
[1954] That, from the unmanifest compression of the elements,
[1955] When conditions of heat and moisture meet, that mind of latent self-nature arises.
[1956] Entering a new body with a new mind,
[1957] Becomes a sentient being.
[1958] That, abiding in the latent mind of the self-nature of earth, produces grass, trees, forests, and so forth.
[1959] Through water existing, it moistens, moves, and produces sound.
[1960] Through fire existing, it blazes and burns.
[1961] Through wind existing, movement arises—that is its essence.
[1962] Thus:
[1963] Wood, sticks,
[1964] Pebbles,
[1965] And all coarse entities have mind.
[1966] When one strikes one, sound arises.
[1967] When thrown, it goes for a reason.
[1968] Some trees wither at night and expand in the day.
[1969] When skin is peeled, it dries.
[1970] And for the sake of producing dried growth, etc.
[1971] Thus, if there is previous action and mind in the realms,
[1972] Trees and so forth also become from previous existence.
[1973] Not existing—suddenly.
[1974] Like a boil arising from the gathering of current accumulations.
[1975] How does it manifest?
[1976] From the meeting of summer heat and moisture, a small worm as long as a horse's tail goes in one direction.
[1977] What remains on the other side becomes a drum-tail.
[1978] Termites,
[1979] From insects become bees. It is known that worms become frogs.
[1980] Thus, the cause is not eternal.
[1981] In summer, when termites enter wood, pebbles,
[1982] And awns of grain, they become sentient beings.
[1983] When adventitious causes and conditions gather, the result becomes a sentient being.
[1984] Also, from good causes and conditions, good results are accomplished.
[1985] Like when a king's daughter is seen to arise from beautiful queens. Thus it is held.
[1986] The propounder of severance of results is:
[1987] The son of Katika with a hunchback,
[1988] And others like Mipam wearing a hair blanket.
[1989] For present beings, there is not only no previous life.
[1990] There is also no latent cause producing the arising mind.
[1991] It is merely the arising of nature itself.
[1992] Without a maker, sharp thorns,
[1993] The sun arises and rises.
[1994] Water falls from waterfalls—not from causes, but naturally formed, primordially arising.
[1995] Dying without continuation, the next life's result is absolutely nonexistent. Thus it is held.
[1996] From the Black Tantra of Ishvara:
[1997] The sun rises, rivers fall,
[1998] Sharp, long thorns,
[1999] Beautiful peacocks' tails,
[2000] Beautiful kings' sons—
[2001] None made these; they arise from nature itself.
[2002] Cessation is not nonexistent, nor is the future existent.
[2003] All this is merely adventitious confusion, conceptually designated.
[2004] Thus it is taught.
[2005] When refuted that the scripture becomes meaningless,
[2006] The answer is also this:
[2007] On the side of cause severance:
[2008] Without a previous mind, the present coarse arising mind exists, and when it ripens as a sentient being here,
[2009] Without habituating the nonexistent nature, later from death, the four elements' latents also,
[2010] If the mind does not enter liberation, the scripture's meaning exists.
[2011] Without habituating the nonexistent, at death, the body of four elements—earth, water, fire, wind—dissolves into the four elements of outer objects.
[2012] This knowledge also divides into four and destroys the nature of afflictions. Thus it is taught.
[2013] On the side of result severance:
[2014] If one knows the nonexistent nature, other scriptures do not carry it away.
[2015] From making meaningless effort.
[2016] To reverse this life, we say that the established scripture has meaning, though we speak of nonexistence.
[2017] Those two holders of positions, like the humpbacked son of Katika:
[2018] All sentient beings first arise from the space of elements.
[2019] In the middle, they abide in the space of arising.
[2020] In the end, they dissolve into the space of arising, holding that there is no trace.
[2021] They speak of the single space of arising as the self-nature of all.
[2022] In the space of abiding, the nine abodes of non-abiding arise as whatever appears.
[2023] From the space of arising, the nine non-arisings of the time of arising.
[2024] Outer forms and so forth—objects of various white and red colors.
[2025] Inner sentient beings and mental concepts.
[2026] Nine aspects of the body that do not arise differently.
[2027] At the time of liberation.
[2028] The nine unliberated, when liberated—all vessels, contents, and embodied forms dissolve themselves. Since there is no unliberation.
[2029] The destroyed cannot return to the three realms.
[2030] Thus, all beings first arise adventitiously from space.
[2031] Now they abide adventitiously in space.
[2032] In the end, they are liberated adventitiously into space and do not return.
[2033] Second, explaining those enumerations individually:
[2034] From Rigpa Rangshar:
[2035] Such is the mistaken vehicle:
[2036] Holding the three hundred sixty of the transitory collection.
[2037] Explained as the three hundred spaces.
[2038] Such are the sixty views:
[2039] The mistaken speech of the Samkhyas.
[2040] The Vaisesikas' own-cause theory.
[2041] The great Kumaralabha.
[2042] The scripture-holders of ear-followers.

[2049] Likewise, the subtle ground of clairvoyance.
[2050] The general appearance of Buddha's blessings.
[2051] The mistaken ascetic conduct.
[2052] Such are the views of permanence:

[2055] Indicating great permanent meanings.
[2056] Speaking of the eternal unchanging.
[2057] Speaking of permanence as occasion.

[2060] Relying on the path of permanence itself.

[2067] Prioritizing debate.
[2068] And ascetic conduct.

[2071] Becoming wearers of hair blankets.
[2072] Wearing Mipam's cotton garments.

[2074] Speaking of dependence on actions.

[2086] Tirthikas of manifest mind.
[2087] Tirthikas of confused appearance and grasping.
[2088] Tirthikas of producing anger.
[2089] Tirthikas of activity and mind.
[2090] Tirthikas of grasping meaningless things.
[2091] Tirthikas of erroneous speech.
[2092] Tirthikas of permanent meaning as nonexistent.
[2093] Kani and jealousy.
[2094] Bhasira and Kabisha.
[2095] Sindhara and Dhasim.
[2096] Kati and Samgha.
[2097] Sankari and Dhasaka.
[2098] Thus it is taught.
[2099] These two explain the meaning extensively:
[2100] Explaining the three hundred sixty mistaken views of space.
[2101] Expounding extensively on those sixty branches.
[2102] First:
[2103] From the confused space of elements and knowledge, individual concepts grasp at tenets.
[2104] The hundred passed teachers,
[2105] Future,
[2106] And the three times of present—these are explained as three hundred wrong views.
[2107] The hundred teachers—what do they say?
[2108] As follows:

[2203] Dwellers in house enclosures,
[2204] Chief Aryas,
[2205] Sons of relatives,
[2206] Supporters,
[2207] Ascetics—a full hundred.
[2208] These speak of permanence.
[2209] Some speak of impermanence.
[2210] Some speak of both, gathering permanence and impermanence together.
[2211] From Rangshar:
[2212] This too is summarized as follows:
[2213] Permanence and impermanence.
[2214] The meaning of the view of impermanence is as follows:
[2215] The great tirthika emptiness of sudden cutoff.
[2216] Like the emptiness of space in continuous cutoff.
[2217] Viewing the nature of cutoff as nonexistent.
[2218] The cutoff of results as emptiness.
[2219] The permanence of the nonexistent emptiness.
[2220] The tenets of the permanent vehicle.
[2221] The tenets of eternal permanence.
[2222] As follows regarding permanent things:
[2223] From one's own citta mandala,
[2224] Not arising from father causes,
[2225] Not depending on mother conditions,
[2226] As large as beans,
[2227] As small as mustard seeds,
[2228] As tiny as hair tips,
[2229] Oily, smooth, white, and clear.
[2230] Thus, that nature of causes,
[2231] Exists permanently without change from the beginning.
[2232] This and habitual tendencies, aggregates,
[2233] Abiding inseparably as one,
[2234] Is held as the tenet of permanent causes.
[2235] As follows regarding permanent results:
[2236] The great lord of fortune itself,
[2237] Through virtues of reliance and worship,
[2238] Although abandoning this first body,
[2239] Produces births on one's own ground.
[2240] By the great lord of fortune,
[2241] Results are held as permanent.
[2242] The two natures of permanence and impermanence,
[2243] Do not accord with their own meanings.
[2244] Thus it is taught.
[2245] Second, explaining extensively the meaning of those sixty branches:
[2246] Also from that:
[2247] The Samkhyas hold views as follows:
[2248] Atoms,
[2249] Darkness,
[2250] And three energies—they hold these as permanent.
[2251] They also hold that delusion is the basis of action.
[2252] Attachment produces happiness.
[2253] Anger turns back armies.
[2254] This is the doctrine of the Samkhyas.
[2255] The Vaisesika view is as follows:
[2256] They view outer aggregates, elements, and ayatanas as minute atoms.
[2257] They count these as minute atoms grasped by the first grasper.
[2258] These are the causes and conditions of cessation.
[2259] These are the causes and conditions of ultimate emptiness.
[2260] When the body is abandoned, mind and space remain latent.
[2261] The latent arising of body.
[2262] Abiding at the end of trace emptiness.
[2263] The Kumaralabha tenets hold:
[2264] Mind is nonexistent; body is nonexistent.
[2265] When mind is nonexistent, body is also nonexistent.
[2266] When mind is nonexistent, at the abandonment of body, all is empty and nonexistent.
[2267] The Karnaputra tenets are as follows:
[2268] They see appearance as permanent through circumstances.
[2269] They hold that ultimate appearance is impermanent.
[2270] They hold that future appearance in the retinue of the great lord of fortune is permanent.
[2271] Such is also the accepted doctrine of Karnaputra.
[2272] The secret teaching of the five fires is as follows:
[2273] Sending lamps from persons residing in the Buddha's emanation realms.
[2274] Seeing subtle clairvoyance from the five wisdoms appearing as Buddhas.
[2275] Engaging in the five fires.
[2276] Cooking with sandalwood trees and sesame oil.
[2277] Sending the five fires, also burning one's own body.
[2278] Called "fire-cloth"—wrapping one's own body in cloth and sesame oil.
[2279] Burning one's own body with fire.
[2280] The ascetic conduct of three spear-tips.
[2281] Also, with three spear-tips placed on the ground, jumping from those tips—ascetic conduct.
[2282] Jumping from rocks and cliffs, destroying the body.
[2283] This is called the mistaken conduct of grasping at portions.
[2284] Own body flesh mirror-like shoulder right left head crown peel remove
[2285] Own body this earth hole place
[2286] Cemetery kind own body worm feed exist
[2287] Also mistaken animal conduct called
[2288] Dog conduct enter mistaken asceticism conduct exist
[2289] Agent cause speak
[2290] Example carpenter skilled man woman form different action do like
[2291] Dharma etc. own clairvoyance action do fortune lord retinue birth think
[2292] Agent path carry tenet
[2293] World this house etc. action do
[2294] Future own body abandon
[2295] Fortune lord own front receive Mount-Meru terrace reside
[2296] Permanent meaning indicate view
[2297] Meaning own permanent other cut sudden cut show
[2298] Permanent eternal speak this-like think
[2299] Meaning permanent unchangeable great nature not-definite think
[2300] Also occasion change speak
[2301] This-like
[2302] Meaning cut occasion permanent view
[2303] Cause permanent view
[2304] Own heart center cause thing shape round
[2305] Color white
[2306] Big small measure bean-like
[2307] Father cause not-arise
[2308] Mother condition not-produced permanent view exist
[2309] Result permanent think
[2310] Cause not-permanent mind thing non-existent
[2311] Result permanent fortune lord exist say
[2312] Permanent path rely
[2313] Cause not-permanent mind thing non-existent
[2314] Result not-permanent fortune lord ground companion non-existent not-arrive
[2315] Path permanent fortune lord path Mount-Meru top reside
[2316] Those who aspire to abide upon the path, regarding conduct as permanent,
[2317] Yet perceiving cause and effect as impermanent—
[2318] Such practitioners, through taking conduct as permanent, seek liberation thereby.
[2319] Objects, dwellings, and households they hold as eternal,
[2320] And all appearances whatsoever they view as permanent.
[2321] Those who view permanence where it does not exist are nihilists in essence,
[2322] For viewing what is permanent as cut off constitutes the nihilistic view.
[2323] Upon this very ground they enact the tenet of permanence.
[2324] Those who wield evil mantras as paramount, performing fierce destructive rites,
[2325] Speaking with the single-pointed resolve of black practitioners,
[2326] Attached thereto, desiring results through such means.
[2327] Those who take divination and prophecy as paramount,
[2328] Caring solely for the happiness of this world,
[2329] Declaring future lives utterly nonexistent.
[2330] Those who take subtle miracles as paramount,
[2331] Turning back armies in this world through magical power,
[2332] In future lives too, wishing to subdue others through magic, seeking rebirth in the retinue of lords or powerful deities.
[2333] Those whose view prioritizes debate,
[2334] Internalizing their own truth while refuting others, harboring such hopes.
[2335] Those who harbor hopes in mistaken ascetic practices.
[2336] Those attached to this world,
[2337] Called "worldly benefit," engaging in the affairs of this world.
[2338] Also, some internalize their own truth while pridefully destroying others' standing.
[2339] Some seek meaning through mere custom.
[2340] Some, having made matted locks of hair, seek meaning thereby.
[2341] Some, wrapping their bodies alternately in single cloths, declare "inner heat has arisen."
[2342] Some, holding khaṭvāṅga and ḍamaru as hand-attributes, declare "I am the emanation body."
[2343] Some say "Whatever virtue you perform benefits me," depending upon that meaning.
[2344] Some, by their own reasoning refuting others' reasoning, declare "This is my action," depending upon that meaning.
[2345] Some declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut.
[2346] Some declare that sudden cut renders even their own bodies empty.
[2347] Some declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut.
[2348] Some declare that sudden cut renders even their own bodies empty.
[2349] Cause severed, effect severed.
[2350] Some assert severance of cause, holding that mind cannot be grasped as an entity.
[2351] Others declare severance of effect, claiming neither life-force nor supreme power exists.
[2352] Moreover, some proclaim severance of path, stating there is nothing whatsoever.
[2353] Others assert severance of primordial wisdom, declaring there is no Buddha.
[2354] There are also those who say cause and effect do not exist, that emptiness is completely severed.
[2355] Some, through dwelling upon the path, declare severance, claiming effects are definitely cut off.
[2356] Through mistaken mind, they claim life-force is severed.
[2357] Some also assert that meaning arises from cutting the life-force.
[2358] Moreover, there are those who declare that severance is emptiness, and since you are severed and I am severed, therefore there is nothing whatsoever.
[2359] The secret speakers of the Vedas proclaim:
[2360] That meaning, like space itself, is completely empty and severed.
[2361] Existence as an entity does not exist.
[2362] Yet some slight portion exists.
[2363] They also claim that appearance to the faculties is possible.
[2364] These are called tīrthikas who deviate from partial agreement.
[2365] They deviate from partial agreement with the Buddhist teachings.
[2366] They deviate through wrong understanding of the Buddha's philosophical tenets—these are merely flesh.
[2367] Some think manifest appearance is mind's magical display.
[2368] They also teach that all is mere magical illusion.
[2369] Moreover, some claim these mistaken appearances are true,
[2370] While declaring there is no ultimate meaning.
[2371] There are even those who assert that through arising anger, spirits are destroyed, and therefore, son of the clan, one should abide in anger.
[2372] Some claim that since mind, as object, is self-arisen, it cannot be corrected.
[2373] Others declare that relying solely upon meditation on the deity's form is sufficient.
[2374] Some, being tīrthika practitioners, deviate from tīrthika debate-like speech.
[2375] Some assert that since only permanence exists, nothing whatsoever need be done.
[2376] Kani-pa is so called,
[2377] For he holds meaning to be indifferent.
[2378] Sersnawa is so called,
[2379] For he possesses suffering through fear that appearance will diminish and become empty.
[2380] Sambhari is so called.
[2381] Kabhisha is so called, for he wishes that neither special meaning nor common meaning exists.
[2382] Sindha is so called,
[2383] For he holds that while common meaning does not exist, special meaning does exist.
[2384] Dhasimba is so called,
[2385] For he wishes that no meaning whatsoever exists.
[2386] Katipa is so called,
[2387] For he wishes that meaning exists, yet holds it is cut off until the breath ceases.
[2388] Sangha is so called—there are also those who claim that since I have entered the features of the saṅgha, it is sufficient.
[2389] Shamkari is so called,
[2390] For he holds compounded things to be impermanent and true.
[2391] The truth of compounded impermanence
[2392] Is the truth of life-force or supreme lord.
[2393] Doshaka is so called,
[2394] For all sūtras are gathered into life-force and supreme power.
[2395] There are also those who declare that life-force and supreme power definitely exist upon the summit of Mount Meru.
[2396] Thus the numberless views of aggregates are gathered into two categories.
[2397] These are permanence and interruption.
[2398] From these, the numberless views of aggregates spread forth, it is said.
[2399] Thus all teachings are gathered into four:
[2400] Extreme view,
[2401] Extreme end,
[2402] Distant benefit,
[2403] And indifference.
[2404] Extreme view refers to those who speak of eternal permanence.
[2405] Extreme end refers to those who declare permanent is permanent and impermanent is impermanent—both.
[2406] Distant benefit refers to those who hold half permanent, half interrupted.
[2407] Indifference refers to those who speak of complete severance.
[2408] These themselves are also gathered into permanence and interruption.
[2409] From the former, those wrong views
[2410] Are taught as gathered into four types.
[2411] Extreme view, extreme end,
[2412] Distant benefit, and indifference.
[2413] Thus the explanation is as follows:
[2414] Extreme view is eternal permanence.
[2415] Extreme end is half permanent, half cut.
[2416] Indifference is cut, completely cut.
[2417] Distant benefit is effect cut.
[2418] Thus the three hundred sixty
[2419] Are gathered into four types.
[2420] These are also gathered into permanence and interruption,
[2421] Thus it is said.
[2422] The purpose of teaching these
[2423] Is that one does not enter wrong paths through recognition.
[2424] From those same teachings.
[2428] Thus spoke: "Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates."
[2429] The outsiders' philosophical positions are now explained.
[2430] Second, the extensive division of transcendent vehicles has three aspects:
[2431] The method superior to outsiders,
[2432] The general explanation of categories,
[2433] And the extensive particular explanation.
[2434] First: accepting the four dharma-seal mudras and going for refuge to the Three Jewels—this is superior, for outsiders' paths lack this.
[2435] The four mudras are: all compounded things impermanent,
[2436] All with defilements suffering,
[2437] All dharmas empty and selfless,
[2438] Liberation from suffering peaceful.
[2439] Second has five aspects:
[2440] Essence,
[2441] Definition,
[2442] Division,
[2443] Purpose,
[2444] And effect.
[2445] The essence of the transcendent vehicle:
[2446] That dharma-category which is the supreme method for definitely exiting saṃsāra.
[2447] Definition: that which, when entered, produces happiness.
[2448] From the Compendium:
[2449] Mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—
[2450] Joy, happiness, bliss, accomplishing supreme virtue.
[2451] This vehicle, like space, a measureless great palace.
[2452] Thus it is said.
[2453] Division:
[2454] Small and great, two;
[2455] Or hearer, self-enlightened, and bodhisattva vehicles, three—
[2456] Inconceivable, regarding disciples' minds.
[2457] From the Lankāvatāra:
[2458] As long as mind engages,
[2459] The vehicle's limits are endless.
[2460] Thus it is said.
[2461] Purpose: accomplishing temporary and ultimate meanings.
[2462] Effect: definitely exiting the three realms, obtaining liberation.
[2463] Third: extensive particular explanation.
[2464] From Rigpa Rangshar, the vehicle divisions are thus:
[2465] Sūtra and great extensive,
[2466] And also the great extensive.
[2467] The great extensive:
[2468] Eighty-four thousand inconceivable,
[2469] Extensively numbered, many and great,
[2470] Inconceivable, measureless,
[2471] Inexpressible, thought-transcending, great.
[2472] Thus the great victor.
[2473] Inexpressible, transcending thought, great.
[2474] Thus the great victor.
[2475] Divisions considered as nine types:
[2476] Listener and self-enlightened,
[2477] And thus bodhisattva.
[2478] Kriya and Upa,
[2479] And thus explained as Yoga vehicle.
[2480] Maha, Anu, Yoga,
[2481] And thus Dzogchen Ati.
[2482] Thus taught as nine types,
[2483] This is the Great Dharma Teaching.
[2484] Thus spoke, establishing the meaning:
[2485] Generally, Buddha's Dharma classifications limitless,
[2486] Gathered into vehicles alone:
[2487] Vehicles generally taught, great and small, two;
[2488] Characteristic vehicle,
[2489] Effect vajra vehicle;
[2490] Explained extensively:
[2491] Upon three inferior faculties,
[2492] Listener, self-enlightened, bodhisattva vehicles, three;
[2493] Upon three medium, Kriya, Upa, Yoga, three;
[2494] Upon three sharp,
[2495] Maha, Anu, Ati, three taught.
[2496] From Ati Kopa Chenpo:
[2497] The Dharmas I taught
[2498] From beings' mind stages,
[2499] By differences of great and small,
[2500] Taught as two-stage method.
[2501] Each view left in its place.
[2502] Each self has two stages:
[2503] Inverted and correct view.
[2504] By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara.
[2505] Correct: three stages—
[2506] Small mind and great,
[2507] And thus medium mind possessed,
[2508] Taught as three-stage method.
[2509] Small stage: three types—
[2510] Dharmas compatible with those views,
[2511] Obscured by thought: listener.
[2512] Conception possessed: self-enlightened.
[2513] Thought-grasp possessed: bodhisattva.
[2514] Upon three medium, teaching:
[2515] Upon very inferior: deeds,
[2516] Action upon inferiors.
[2517] Consciousness possessed: yoga itself.
[2518] Upon three great stage possessed,
[2519] Vast mind: generation,
[2520] Concentrated mind: completion.
[2521] Supreme fresh supreme: great completion.
[2522] Thus.
[2523] Very extensive great vehicle:
[2524] All Word gathered in three baskets,
[2525] Mantras being manifest great—
[2465] Herein, what are the two divisions?
[2466] First, explaining Vaibhāṣika:
[2467] They hold the four truths as directly realized,
[2468] And the aggregates, elements, and sense-bases as truly established.
[2469] They assert direct perception, inference, and scripture as valid cognitions.
[2470] The view of the path is established through three characteristics.
[2471] The effects are explained as four pairs of persons.
[2472] Thus explaining the Vaibhāṣika view.
[2473] Second, explaining Sautrāntika:
[2474] They hold the four truths as directly realized,
[2475] And emptiness and selflessness as the nature of realization.
[2475] Cognizing cognitions are twelvefold knowing.
[2476] Objects are established as the four truths.
[2477] Selflessness of persons is established through outer grasping.
[2478] Selflessness of dharmas is established through lack of true existence.
[2479] Thus explaining the Sautrāntika view.
[2480] Herein, how to explain the path cultivation?
[2481] The antidote for the three poisons is emptiness.
[2482] Individual antidotes: meditation on impurity for desire,
[2483] Meditation on love for anger, and dependent arising for delusion.
[2484] The faculties are dull, medium, and sharp.
[2485] Effort is made according to faculties.
[2486] Bodhisattvas' path is the five previously gone.
[2487] Thus explaining path cultivation in brief.
[2488] Herein, how to explain the effects?
[2489] Hearer effects: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and foe-destroyer.
[2490] Self-enlightened: solitary rhinoceros-like.
[2491] Bodhisattvas: the ten grounds of great joy.
[2492] Thus explaining the effects.
[2493] Herein, how to explain the self-enlightened vehicle?
[2494] They realize dependent arising through their own power,
[2495] Without relying upon a teacher in their final life.
[2496] Like a rhinoceros, they wander alone.
[2497] Thus explaining the self-enlightened vehicle.
[2498] Herein, how to explain the bodhisattva vehicle?
[2499] Generated bodhicitta, engaged in the six perfections,
[2500] Perfecting the two accumulations, attaining enlightenment for others' benefit.
[2501] Thus explaining the bodhisattva vehicle in brief.
[2502] Herein, explaining in detail,
[2503] First, the essence of the bodhisattva vehicle:
[2504] Generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six perfections.
[2505] Definition: vehicle entered through the power of compassion.
[2506] Purpose: establishing all beings in buddhahood.
[2507] Effect: attaining the ten grounds and five paths.
[2508] Division: two—the Prajñāpāramitā system and the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2509] Thus explaining the bodhisattva vehicle.
[2510] Herein, the Prajñāpāramitā system:
[2511] Realizing the three circles as empty,
[2512] Perfecting the six perfections,
[2513] Attaining buddhahood through the five paths and ten grounds.
[2514] Thus explaining the Prajñāpāramitā system.
[2515] Herein, the Tathāgatagarbha system:
[2516] Recognizing the buddha-nature endowed with virtues as existent,
[2517] Purifying adventitious defilements,
[2518] Revealing the essence spontaneously present.
[2519] Thus explaining the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2520] Herein, the grounds and paths:
[2521] The five paths: accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, and no-more-learning.
[2522] The ten grounds: joyous, stainless, luminous, radiant, difficult-to-conquer, manifest, gone-afar, immovable, good-intelligence, and cloud-of-dharma.
[2523] Thus explaining grounds and paths.
[2524] Herein, the two accumulations:
[2525] Merit accumulated through the first five perfections,
[2526] Wisdom accumulated through the perfection of discernment.
[2527] Thus explaining the two accumulations.
[2528] Herein, the final ground:
[2529] The tenth ground, cloud-of-dharma,
[2530] Surrounded by Buddhas, receiving empowerment,
[2531] Attaining complete buddhahood.
[2532] Thus explaining the final ground.
[2533] Herein, the common vehicle summary:
[2534] Through the three vehicles, beings of three capacities are tamed.
[2535] The cause vehicle establishing the cause of buddhahood.
[2536] Thus the common vehicle is explained.
[2607] Those with dull faculties and those of medium effort—
[2608] Some obtain the result within that very life.
[2609] The sharp,
[2610] And some bodhisattvas who have previously traversed the five paths, having accumulated collections extensively as a basis, desire liberation upon one seat having completed the five paths.
[2611] That also, from the hearer vehicle:
[2612] Their path, through small intellect,
[2613] Medium,
[2614] And great, hearers,
[2615] Self-enlightened,
[2616] And buddha-enlightenment three desire to accomplish—
[2617] The Mahāyāna and mantra path they do not desire.
[2618] That too, for hearers and self-enlightened, the eight inferior grounds from the White Completely-Seeing Ground and so forth are taught.
[2619] Relying upon that: stream-enterer,
[2620] Once-returner,
[2621] Non-returner,
[2622] And foe-destroyer—
[2623] Each entered and
[2624] Abiding divided two-by-two are called the eight stages of great persons.
[2625] For bodhisattvas' ten grounds from Great Joy and so forth also, the four renunciation results are taught to exist.
[2626] Those also, from Rigpa Rangshar:
[2627] The hearer vehicle is thus:
[2628] The entry gate is the four truths.
[2629] The hearers' general entry gate.
[2630] Divisions are held as two types:
[2631] Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika.
[2632] The Vaibhāṣikas' view:
[2633] Aggregates, elements, and sense-bases
[2634] Are held in the manner of yak-horn and conch.
[2635] When become signs of own intellect,
[2636] Dust and dust-atoms are held.
[2637] Thus completely analyzing,
[2638] Emptiness is meditated.
[2639] The Sautrāntikas' view:
[2640] Recitation-made self-nature,
[2641] Hearing, contemplation, meditation three,
[2642] Through cultivating wisdom three,
[2643] Desire to obtain the ten grounds' result.
[2644] Hearers' general type:
[2645] Meditating the four truths,
[2646] Desire the four results.
[2647] That also, meditation-method is thus:
[2648] Desiring to meditate cessation,
[2649] Desiring to abandon origination.
[2650] Cessation meditation-method is thus:
[2651] Upon these external elements,
[2652] Entering into non-attached abode,
[2653] First accustoming to food.
[2654] Having become accustomed to food,
[2655] Samādhi and concentration meditate,
[2656] Samādhi non-conceptual single-pointedly meditate.
[2657] Upon the Victor Maitreya's teaching,
[2658] Desire to obtain the result.
[2659] Origination abandonment is thus:
[2660] Free from food's concept,
[2661] Desiring to cut the continuum of origination.
[2662] That also, as anger's antidote meditate,
[2663] All afflictions abandon.
[2664] Ground-path meditation is thus:
[2665] As desire's antidote meditate,
[2666] As delusion's antidote meditate.
[2667] Thus the path's meditation:
[2668] Desiring to abandon suffering.
[2669] Path's meditation-method is thus:
[2670] As desire's antidote,
[2671] Upon own forehead's maṇḍala,
[2672] A white skeleton thumb-sized,
[2673] Having meditated white light-rays accumulated,
[2674] From that produced, then just the head,
[2675] Then just the body meditate,
[2676] Then just own surrounding,
[2677] Then whatever-appears all meditate.
[2678] Thus three-thousand white,
[2679] Thus white accustomed,
[2680] Desire's suffering abandon.
[2681] Delusion suffering abandon:
[2682] Also upon own head's crown,
[2683] Fire red, clear tone.
[2581] Herein, explaining the three vows:
[2582] Prātimokṣa, bodhisattva, and mantra vows.
[2583] Thus explaining the three vows in brief.
[2584] Herein, Prātimokṣa vows:
[2585] Eight types: bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, śikṣamāṇā, śrāmaṇera, śrāmaṇerikā,
[2586] Upāsaka, upāsikā, and one-day upavāsa.
[2587] Thus explaining Prātimokṣa.
[2588] Herein, bodhisattva vows:
[2589] Aspiring and engaging bodhicitta.
[2590] The twenty root downfalls and forty-six branch faults to be abandoned.
[2591] Restoring through the four powers.
[2592] Thus explaining bodhisattva vows.
[2593] Herein, mantra vows:
[2594] The fourteen root downfalls and eight thick branches.
[2595] Samaya of body, speech, and mind.
[2596] Restoring through recitation and meditation.
[2597] Thus explaining mantra vows.
[2598] Herein, the summary of vehicles and vows:
[2599] The three vehicles for three types of beings,
[2600] The three vows for three types of practitioners.
[2601] Thus explaining vehicles and vows.
[2602] Herein, the vehicle of characteristics:
[2603] Established through causes and conditions,
[2604] Gradually traversed over countless aeons.
[2605] Thus explaining the vehicle of characteristics.
[2606] Herein, the vehicle of mantra:
[2607] Established through the methods of channels, winds, and drops,
[2608] Traversed swiftly through profound skillful means.
[2609] Thus explaining the vehicle of mantra.
[2610] Herein, the vehicle of Ati:
[2611] Established through directly recognizing the nature,
[2612] Instantaneous liberation without gradual stages.
[2613] Thus explaining the vehicle of Ati.
[2614] Herein, distinguishing the vehicles:
[2615] By method, by view, by conduct, by effect.
[2616] Thus explaining the distinctions.
[2617] Thus the explanation of the common vehicle is completed.
[2726] Realizing that like reflections, they are without essence by nature and unarisen.
[2727] Furthermore, the two—outer grasping toward the self of dharmas
[2728] And inner knowledge grasping the antidote—are superimpositions of truth.
[2729] The self of the person is the knowledge of abandonment on the dharmas comprising the five aggregates, grasping at I and mine.
[2730] These are called the self of the person and the self of dharmas.
[2731] Though ārya hearers realize the selflessness of the person, they do not realize the selflessness of dharmas.
[2732] Self-enlightened ones realize above that the outer grasping of dharmas is non-existent, yet do not realize the non-existence of grasping.
[2733] From the Abhisamayālaṅkāra:
[2734] "In order to abandon thought of the grasped object,
[2735] "And in order not to abandon grasping,
[2736] "The rhinoceros-like path of support
[2737] "Should be known through correct summary."
[2738] Thus.
[2739] The time is through accumulating the collections comprising the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas.
[2740] "The rhinoceros through the cause of a hundred kalpas"
[2741] Is thus taught.
[2742] The crow-like:
[2743] Meditates on dependent origination in reverse order.
[2744] Going to the charnel ground, contemplating from "From what does this corpse arise?"
[2745] "It arises from death," thus from ignorance,
[2746] Based on realizing half and two of selflessness,
[2747] Through meditating on the five paths, they manifest the enlightenment of knowing weariness and non-arising.
[2748] Both of these teach Dharma through bodily signs, not through speech.
[2749] These methods are also from Rigpa Rangshar:
[2750] "A-ho, Secret Lord, listen!
[2751] "The sūtra vehicle of the self-enlightened:
[2752] "The door of entry is the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2753] "The realized view is the selflessness of the person,
[2754] "Holding half the power of the view of dharmas.
[2755] "Keeping the two hundred fifty disciplines of protection,
[2756] "Meditating on the stage of non-thought, the nature of dharmas,
[2757] "Outer and inner dependent origination,
[2758] "Becoming strength through habituation,
[2759] "Holding the measure of perfected fruit.
[2760] "These also are indicated by examples thus:
[2761] "For example, like a corpse in the charnel ground,
[2762] "Having gone to the charnel ground,
[2763] "This corpse, from what did it first arise?
[2764] "Now, what is the entity of this?
[2765] "Thus indicating by example.
[2766] "This also arises from ignorance.
[2767] "From ignorance, formative forces.
[2768] "Formative forces, consciousness.
[2769] "From consciousness, name arises.
[2770] "From name, the nature of form arises.
[2771] "From form, the six sense-bases arise.
[2772] "From the six sense-bases, contact arises.
[2773] "From contact, feeling arises.
[2774] "From feeling, craving arises.
[2775] "From craving, grasping arises.
[2776] "From grasping, existence arises.
[2777] "From existence, birth arises.
[2778] "From birth, aging arises.
[2779] "From aging, sickness arises.
[2780] "From sickness, death arises.
[2781] "Thus meditate on the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2782] "Through meditating thus with excellence,
[2783] "Obtain the fruit of the twelve grounds.
[2784] "Meditate on the eight types of unpleasantness.
[2785] "Having gone in the direction of the charnel ground,
[2786] "Thus contemplate upon one's own body.
[2658] Herein, explaining the outer pith instructions:
[2659] The outer concentration: the four visions of the lamp.
[2660] Outer emptiness: dissolving into the expanse.
[2661] Thus explaining the outer pith instructions.
[2662] Herein, the inner pith instructions:
[2663] The inner concentration: the four visions of the lamp.
[2664] Inner emptiness: dissolving into the bindu.
[2665] Thus explaining the inner pith instructions.
[2666] Herein, the secret pith instructions:
[2667] The secret concentration: the four lamps of the channels.
[2668] Secret emptiness: dissolving into the channels.
[2669] Thus explaining the secret pith instructions.
[2670] Herein, the unsurpassable pith instructions:
[2671] The unsurpassable concentration: the four lamps.
[2672] Unsurpassable emptiness: dissolving into the clear light.
[2673] Thus explaining the unsurpassable pith instructions.
[2674] Herein, the four lamps:
[2675] The lamp of the abiding nature, the lamp of the channels,
[2676] The lamp of the far-reaching water lasso, the lamp of the empty bindu.
[2677] Thus explaining the four lamps.
[2678] Herein, the four visions:
[2679] Dharmatā, increase, full attainment, and exhaustion.
[2680] Thus explaining the four visions.
[2681] Herein, dharmatā vision:
[2682] Recognizing the nature of mind as the deity.
[2683] Thus explaining dharmatā vision.
[2684] Herein, increase vision:
[2685] The increase of experiences and realizations.
[2686] Thus explaining increase vision.
[2687] Herein, full attainment vision:
[2688] The full attainment of the path.
[2689] Thus explaining full attainment vision.
[2690] Herein, exhaustion vision:
[2691] The exhaustion of phenomena into the nature.
[2692] Thus explaining exhaustion vision.
[2693] Herein, the manner of liberation:
[2694] Through recognition, liberation is instantaneous.
[2695] Through practice, qualities arise.
[2696] Through perfection, buddhahood is attained.
[2697] Thus explaining the manner of liberation.
[2698] Thus the uncommon vehicle is explained.
[2831] Here follows the general path briefly stated.
[2832] The explanation of the various established tenet positions divides into two parts.
[2833] First: through the methodological tradition of the Vehicle of Characteristics, the path for sharp faculties and powerful mind-power arises. This should be understood as the self-nature of the two truths of the basis.
[2834] Knowing this, how then to practice.
[2835] The presentation of the fruit of the complete path, with three divisions:
[2836] First:
[2837] All phenomena gathered by samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.
[2838] As the Root Wisdom states:
[2839] "The Buddhas taught the Dharma,
[2840] Relying correctly upon the two truths:
[2841] The conventional truth of the world,
[2842] And the ultimate truth of meaning."
[2843] Thus it is said.
[2844] From the Illusion Net:
[2845] "One abides in the manner of the two truths."
[2846] Thus.
[2847] As for this: phenomena marked by characteristics that appear as objects of intellect are the conventional truth.
[2848] Divided into the false and the true conventional—these two.
[2849] First: all phenomena including the container and contained of appearance and existence arranged by intellect are the false conventional.
[2850] Because appearance manifests as the essence of object-delusion appearing as intellect's falseness.
[2851] Those also imputed appearances arise as appearances accordant with the function of deluded intellect.
[2852] They possess the power to function.
[2853] When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence—
[2854] In the manner of the eight examples of illusion:
[2855] Arising as non-existent yet clear-appearing,
[2856] As before:
[2857] Like a dream, like an illusion,
[2858] Like a gandharva city,
[2859] Thus arise, thus abide,
[2860] Thus also cease.
[2861] Thus.
[2862] The true conventional:
[2863] Though appearing deluded, it serves as the cause of blissful migration and liberation.
[2864] The white actions of the ten virtues,
[2865] The collections of merit such as generosity,
[2866] Gathered through the path of truth by means of the mind's samadhi of wisdom, the four aspects of seeing and meditating, serving as the field of experience for intellect.
[2867] From the Uttaratantra Commentary:
[2868] All paths of truth are compounded.
[2869] All compounds are merely conventional.
[2870] That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—the essence of emptiness—along with the subsequent measuring wisdom, the peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.
[2871] Divided: the nominal ultimate and the verbal ultimate.
[2872] These two: the non-nominal ultimate and the truly authentic ultimate.
[2873] First: through reasoning that examines and dissects, when nothing is established as dharma-nature, wisdom that realizes all as primordially dwelling arises in accord with its nature.
[2874] As the Two Truths state:
[2875] "Negating arising and so forth is the ultimate,
[2876] And thinking also accordant purpose."
[2877] When all elaborations of arising cease and peace is attained,
[2878] This is termed "the ultimate."
[2879] Thus.
[2880] Second:
[2881] Phenomena, primordial from the very beginning, transcend all elaborations of existence and non-existence; their sphere of existence is pure by its very nature.
[2882] As the Root Wisdom states:
[2883] "Peace that is not known from elsewhere,
[2884] Conceptuality is nothing, meaning is not differentiated.
[2885] Non-elaboration through all elaborations."
[2886] This is its characteristic.
[2887] Thus.
[2888] Second: the stages of knowing and practicing.
[2889] Whether the bodhisattva householder has taken the vow of the lay practitioner or not, it is suitable.
[2890] If fully ordained, one enters the ten places of novice discipline.
[2891] The bhikshu discipline consists of two hundred and fifty.
[2892] Based upon the bhikshuni discipline of three hundred and sixty-three,
[2893] Generating the mind of great Vehicle aspiration and entering,
[2894] Abiding in the eighty-five training sutras,
[2895] The four establishments of mindfulness in the small path of accumulation,
[2896] The four correct abandonments in the medium path,
[2897] The four miraculous feet in the great path,
[2898] The five faculties of heat and peak in the path of preparation,
[2899] The five strengths of patience and supreme dharma in the peak path,
[2900] The seven limbs of the path of enlightenment in the path of seeing,
[2901] The eight aspects of the superior paths in the nine grounds of meditation,
[2902] Completing with complete signs of heat in the great joy of the ground-paths.
