[14005] Impure body-speech-mind three ripening basis does,
[14006] Perverted three poisons arising door opens.
[14007] That also Roma called—
[14008] Sealed supreme food like taste experience does,
[14009] Nature placed dead taste like, thus unable to benefit.
[14010] This itself male's right, female's left exists.
[14011] Some tantras reversed shown, but intention different only.
[14012] Kyangma is:
[14013] Concentrated dharma thought-free experience birth purpose, Kyangma,
[14014] Nature placed other not-connected pillar-like abiding.
[14015] This itself male's left, female's right exists.
[14016] Kun'darma is:
[14017] Male and female both's center abides,
[14018] Pressed wisdom clear experience birth,
[14019] Nature placed body-speech-mind three's sustaining action does.
[14020] These three channels all channels' basis mother not, thus "ma" tagged.
[14021] Roma male's right coming—
[14022] Awakened-mind producing is.

[14066] thus woman-to rig-can five-of rtsa coming five-poisons superior coarse from arose
[14067] that-from change-deception different thirty-two arose
[14068] disease difference different thirty-two existing rig-can-of rtsa from arose
[14069] that-also rtsa ye-shes-of rig different hundred and rtsa one from

[14080] Disease mostly vessel entering much,
[14081] Males that not-having, few explained.
[14082] Caste channel and

[14085] Kun'darma both's center not-changing abiding—
[14086] Uncontrived meaning basis great perfection all pointing.
[14087] Second, special channels three's purifier:
[14088] Roma's vital point skilled, body's action all purifies,
[14089] Kyangma speech and
[14090] Kun'darma mind action done purifies.
[14091] Third, those channels' indication:
[14092] Roma bliss thought-free indicates, that itself dependent-origination wheel turned, memory exhausted taste form like becomes, thus Roma called.
[14093] Kyangma:
[14094] Clear many tastes one indicates, bindu single meaning abides, thus Kyangma called.
[14095] Kun'darma union non-dual indicates, method bliss and wisdom emptiness union and
[14096] Conventional object-possessor and ultimate object-possessor not two union entered,
[14097] Non-dual limit-free pure view called.
[14107] Insertion place joining does.
[14108] Conventional also mind's ripeness birth spinal vertebrae twenty-one on exists,
[14109] Female's thirteen on exists, thus channel lotus's stigma peak on exists.
[14110] Its branch breast peak from gathered.
[14111] Those branches sixteen sutra-gathering on exists.
[14112] Male's ribs between exists.
[14113] Those body attachment and abiding and destruction action near-taking does.
[14114] Kyangma:
[14115] Speech produces.
[14116] Upon that no-curve straight, voice sweet sign clear,
[14117] Branch subtle exists, voice high short or
[14118] Sign unclear tick like comes.
[14119] Nature branch and curve not exists.
[14120] Channel that ten went, voice gag gone discard comes.
[14121] Channel that itself upper-lower thick-thin center exists, voice peak many-possessor and
[14122] Obstructed comes.
[14123] Channel that pressed exists, voice dull and trembling comes.
[14124] Channel rough-exists, voice hollow other grating comes.
[14125] Yogis channel instruction by those changing and

[14138] left-in exists always doubt and uncertainty in dwell
[14139] tip that change always suffering many and mind unhappy
[14140] rtsa that slip always mind light virtue in engage
[14141] rtsa that mouth open always effort great and engage complete
[14142] that-also body-by rtsa produce
[14143] rtsa-by speech produce
[14144] speech-by mind produce
[14145] mind-by chos-nyid produce
[14146] chos-nyid-by yogi-to produce produce called
[14147] five rtsa those-by action what does is
[14148] ro-ma-by pure-ma lamp radiance show does
[14149] dross-by urine drip action does
[14150] rkyang-ma-by pure-ma upward throw lamp-itself self-appearance show does
[14151] experience and increase does
[14152] that-of dross downward split urine feces discard does
[14153] kun-'dar-ma-by pure-ma upward throw
[14154] ultimate byang-chub mind actual show
[14155] dross downward drip
[14156] relative byang-sems thig-le descend does
[14157] that-also man-by actual descended
[14158] bliss encounter touch destroy called
[14159] experience thig-le fall before bliss destroy does
[14160] woman rig-can five-by covered dwell touch increase called again bliss expand satisfy not-know
[14161] woman-to menstruation descend is
[14162] rtsa nose change from arose
[14163] blood actual descend
[14164] that-also element point-by time not menstruation descend disease-by disturbed is
[14165] month one-in time two and three etcetera descend child vessel change is
[14166] month-of upper always descend child male develop
[14167] lower always descend child female develop
[14168] interrupted and great-small do child not-come
[14169] blood-of request and color yellow child few
[14170] color black and feces child and child many develop odorless and not-felt descend male female separately come
[14171] six rtsa those-of essence is
[14172] ro-ma-of essence bliss is method superior with endowed grasp object chos-nyid pure essence-as liberate does
[14173] rkyang-ma-of essence is
[14174] emptiness is
[14175] wisdom pure-by grasp mind thought chos-nyid-to liberate does
[14176] kun-'dar-ma-of essence bliss-emptiness two-as not unity non-duality grasp-grasp-from free ye-shes spontaneously show does
[14177] seven rtsa those-of chos-nyid is
[14178] ro-ma-by food take and food-of pure-dross wash action chos-nyid
[14179] that-of artery wide person belly big
[14180] fine belly small
[14181] crooked always vomit and food not-take
[14182] sudden-of disease various many
[14183] rkyang-ma-by
[14184] body-of heat rise-fall does
[14185] rtsa this fine body nature-by heat great

[14187] crooked and change etcetera previous like
[14188] kun-'dar-ma-by
[14189] body-of thirst difference and not-thirst chos-nyid show does
[14190] this-itself fine always not-thirst
[14191] wide thirst great
[14192] crooked certainty-not-of action various show
[14193] sudden split-split change body speech mind-to self-power not-existent-of disease various arise
[14194] that-also ro-ma point-to skilled food-of attachment cut meditation-of food become
[14195] rkyang-ma-by clothing-of attachment cut warmth endowed
[14196] middle-by thirst-of attachment cut dream cease
[14197] light-meaning purpose engage
[14198] this three-of point great
[14199] eight rtsa those how apply instruction is
[14200] body and ro-ma apply body form longs-sku
[14201] dwell sprul-sku
[14202] disintegrate chos-sku liberate body sku three-of mandala
[14203] rkyang-ma-by speech dwell meditation
[14204] speech express concentration
[14205] speech cease those chos-nyid-as appear
[14206] Word-syllables secret-mantra's self-sound.
[14207] Kun'darma mind's movement memory-thought pure dharmata joined, thought before-after self-ceased self-liberated self-arisen wisdom joined, object-condition dharmata liberated,
[14208] Memory-thought self-exhausted dharmata's intention arises.
[14209] Thus:
[14210] Body three-body mandala body,
[14211] As spoken mantra words,
[14212] As thought meditation itself.
[14213] Thus Pearl Garland Tantra spoken.
[14214] That also channel's ripeness divided, channel's own characteristic definite,
[14215] Abode place sought, channel arising dharmata known,
[14216] Channel's leap time known, death-transference and birth-place known,
[14217] Channel's nature sealed, mind concentration wheel not-separated,
[14218] Channel coiled heat measure held, always food yoga becomes,
[14219] Channel transference calculation followed, clothes yoga becomes,
[14220] Channel sent vital point followed, latencies stream-cut purpose channels' vital point very profound.
[14221] Second, four wheels' distinction two:
[14222] Four wheels' establishment and
[14223] Individual enumerations explained.
[14224] First:
[14225] One being's body wheels depending and
[14240] Squeezed flesh and
[14241] Flesh variety heart branched depending—
[14242] These cut and
[14243] Pinched and
[14244] Struck and
[14245] Pierced, life's end makes,
[14246] Bloodletting burning dependent-origination disease liberated.
[14247] Thus earth tree etc. produced fire's cause egg power-cattle,
[14248] Third wheel fire's action chief,
[14249] This body's heat and faculties and color produces,
[14250] Heat great hot element becomes,
[14251] Body's sickness and death condition does,
[14252] Heat small cold disease condition does, sickness and death condition does, elements equal dharmata dependent-origination made liberation.
[14253] That also from fire heat moves wind moved, greatly blazing like,
[14254] Fourth wheel wind's action action does,
[14255] Breath outside-inside moves and
[14256] Upward-going downward-clearing action does,
[14257] Karma wheel samsara's root does,
[14258] Latency and all-affliction action body's elements individual actions agitated, sickness and death condition does,
[14259] Element vital point abandoned dependent-origination liberation.
[14270] Gathering form great but strength weak limbs subtle,
[14271] Gathering leaping form small but strength possessing does.
[14272] Memory's throwing mind clear faculties clear thought coarse not does.
[14273] Gathering thought great and forgotten does.
[14274] Gathering faculties clear mind clear forgotten does.
[14275] Throwing leaping thought great but meditation quickly birth does.
[14276] Tastes' throwing pure, voice sweet words clear sound expert does.
[14277] Gathering voice unpleasant.
[14278] Growing impure, voice sweet eloquence great but voice power not does.
[14279] Peak's throwing pure, mind pure intention complete does.
[14280] Growing impure, mind's good complete but virtue not increase.
[14281] Gathering mind's intention not complete memory-thought wrong does.
[14282] That pure, mind's intention not complete but virtue increasing does.
[14283] That is throwing-gathering's certainty.
[14284] That also four wheels' certainty's reason:
[14285] One and two empowerment and path and final fruit not ripen, three also not ripen, reverse direction certainty also four certain,
[14286] Object and subject sequence by concordant direction certainty also four certain—
[14287] Outside elements four,
[14288] Inside wisdom four,
[14289] Secret lamp four,
[14303] repair method definite explained
[14304] first is
[14305] root channel petal six sixty-four-from split-of petal countless-to
[14306] particularly inner channel definite is
[14307] elements and
[14308] mind and
[14309] ignorance and

[14311] leisure all-gathered-of distinction-by-means-of
[14312] surrounding-small-of petal each-from thirty-eight eight-times transform-and
[14313] divided-if two-thousand four-hundred-and thirty-two exist
[14314] that also root and branch-of regard-to made-from

[14329] space mind-of channel various two
[14330] breath and awareness-of essence gather
[14331] leisure all-gathered channel-plural six
[14332] object and ignorance gather-of
[14333] channel-of form these are
[14334] fifteen upward-to go
[14335] fifteen downward-to go
[14336] eight direct transform definite
[14337] said
[14338] second outer channel-of branch explained is
[14339] that itself from
[14340] emanation wheel these from
[14341] various outward transform doing-by-means-of
[14342] channel-of form these are
[14343] that-of right left petal from
[14344] garland like-of channel great
[14345] color possessing variously transform
[14346] knee-of hollow-in
[14347] black light-possessing each
[14348] these two-to ten ten
[14349] that-of petal from
