[13330] The fourfold wisdom liberates all.
[13331] The fivefold display of wisdom.
[13332] On the fourth day, by elemental power manifesting,
[13333] Eight-petaled wheels arise, clear lights and syllables illuminating—
[13334] Gathering wheels of taste like starlight radiantly resounding,
[13335] Wheels stacked like petals—thus the channel wheels are named.
[13336] Within these eight, at the center of five desire-objects, bliss-touch's support,
[13337] Warmth's essence, sheep-fat like, abides twelve sense-bases' basis,
[13338] The wheel of gathering and expanding, basis-of-all's karmic support.
[13339] Thus with syllables of the expanding wheel's abode.
[13340] Then from twenty-nine to thirty-two days, water gathers and holds,
[13341] Earth stabilizes and presses,
[13342] Fire blazes and expands,
[13343] Wind flames and moves—such is the work performed.
[13344] On the thirty-second day, individual elemental power exhausted,
[13345] At this time arises the wild wind of producing action,
[13346] The four wind channels above sent upward and outward,
[13347] Upon the mustard-seed space of subtle particles thrown—
[13348] From the four above channels, four more channels expand,
[13349] At their center, Tip-of-Force Wind petal from star-light-like radiance gathering,
[13350] The actual power of the above element-basis exhausted,
[13351] Again by two elements gathering's work, from day thirty-four,
[13352] The basis-of-all's four supports with their groups solidified,
[13353] Affliction-gathering and coarse channel poison's vapor, like poison-vase gathering, abides—
[13354] Tip-Arranged Wheel thus it is named and abides.
[13355] On the thirty-fifth day, the King's Letter Tantra complete arises from this.
[13356] Thus seven by seven sections, existence body's channel wheels four produced—
[13357] Each one with eight channel-petals, thirty-two abiding in the body whole—
[13358] From the river of existence grasped by twelve limbs' substance, existence body's basis arose.
[13359] Thus from thirty-two channels, thirty-two wisdoms' work arises,
[13360] From essence arising with four lamps' ultimate bindu and ripeness,
[13361] When bliss is made the path, through forceful method buddhahood is certain.
[13362] From their impurity arises the conventional bindu,
[13363] Arising with four elements' ripeness,
[13364] From that suffering enters the self-continuum, samsara's seed increasing.
[13365] Yet depending on the channel's vital point, when made the path,
[13366] The excellent bliss of dharmata is directly realized.
[13367] These channels become the path of primordial wisdom,
[13368] Gone to the nature of bindu,
[13369] Doing the work of bliss and suffering's experience.
[13370] Then again from day thirty-five, by individual elements' work's power,
[13371] Completing the connection of producing action's first work,
[13372] From form gathering and expanding into countless aggregates, the five aggregates' race manifestly projected.
[13373] Then until day forty-two, by two elements gathering's work,
[13374] As producing action, eighty-two thousand water-insects' body increased.
[13375] Upon that wheel, work was done showing sixty-two channel-petals—
[13376] Cause of sixty-two eons' birth-decrease arising.
[13377] Within each channel, one special channel-abode letter,
[13378] One light-mass supporting that,
[13379] Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abide.
[13380] Thus also sixty-two channel-tips,
[13381] Sixty-two letters, one hundred twenty-four,
[13382] Sixty-two lights,
[13383] One hundred eighty-six,
[13384] Samantabhadra father and mother combined—one hundred twenty-four,
[13385] Upon the producing-action-first wheel,
[13386] Three hundred ten distinctions of wisdom's movement.
[13387] By pure wisdom's wind, jumping, dissolving, and so forth,
[13388] The actions of calm-abiding and insight are certainly realized—thus "producing-action" is named,
[13389] Being the basis of existence-body, thus "first" is named.
[13390] Thus being the basis of all, thus "wheel" is named.
[13391] Special dharmas of elements, wind and so forth's enumeration,
[13392] By affliction and action's work, by karmic wind's throwing,
[13393] Inhaling,
[13394] Laughing,
[13395] Holding—thus day and night are determined.
[13396] Thus nine hundred thirty distinction-dharmas abiding are the basis of empowerment-path certainty, arose from this.
[13397] That also, from water-element wheel turning by twelve dependent-originations,
[13398] Eighty-five thousand insects abide.
[13399] Each of those, within that many channels, that many letters—
[13400] From each wind-throwing, none missing,
[13401] Each body abiding, thus countless gathering-dharmas.
[13402] Basis-of-all is the basis of all,
[13403] And also the basis of purification.
[13404] Thus it is said.
[13405] Then the basis-of-all body's support and these two mixed,
[13406] From day forty-six, by individual elements' action's power,
[13407] The wheel of gathering-memory complete and gathered,
[13408] Fire-particles and so forth increase,
[13409] Bliss-suffering feelings increase,
[13410] Perception and sense-bases,
[13411] Consciousness entering objects' distinction increases.
[13412] From formations, root and limb's afflictions increase,
[13413] From eighteen elements' proliferation-change, increase.
[13414] Then four elements' individual power strength exhausted,
[13415] Two-by-two elements gathering, upon gathering-memory wheel, from each channel spreads moving channels—sixteen increasing, showing sixteen empowerments' increase.
[13416] Within each of those, one nature channel-abode letter,
[13417] One five-light mass steadying that,
[13418] Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abide.
[13419] Thus also channels support body,
[13420] Body supports elements,
[13421] Syllable steadies wheel's dharma,
[13422] Light supports wisdom,
[13423] Samantabhadra yab-yum supports three bodies.
[13424] Wisdom and
[13425] Body and
[13426] Dharmata and
[13427] Light, abiding in own nature four—depending on these, four empowerments' result measure arrived.
[13428] Within gathering-memory wheel's sixteen channels,
[13429] Sixteen minds abide depending.
[13430] That also, mind and
[13431] Mind-itself's distinction from—
[13432] First, upon mind, gathering by water-mind holds mindfulness' thought-basis,
[13433] By steadiness, mind's collection gathers,
[13434] Radiating by fire-mind radiates to objects,
[13435] Light by wind-mind moves.
[13436] Upon mind-itself:
[13437] Unborn meaning's mind-itself,
[13438] Unceasing mindfulness's mind-itself,
[13439] Unchanging example-meaning-mixed mind-itself,
[13440] Self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated mind-itself.
[13441] Upon mindfulness, mind and
[13442] Mental two from—
[13443] Mind's mindfulness is as explained before.
[13444] Mental's mindfulness six are:
[13445] Thoroughly-searching mindfulness, pure—clear as god's body,
[13446] Impure—thrown into god's migration,
[13447] Perverted—thrown into wrong-attachment body.
[13448] Definitively-settling mental mindfulness, pure—awareness-holder obtained,
[13449] Impure—born as god-asura,
[13450] Perverted—into butcher's lineage.
[13451] Definitively-placing mental mindfulness, pure—space-dweller.
[13452] Impure—human,
[13453] Perverted—into desire-possessing
[13454] Migration thrown.
[13455] Mental-consciousness's mindfulness, pure—mudra-yoga,
[13456] Impure—animal,
[13457] Perverted—wrong-view-possessor.
[13458] Affliction-possessing mind's mindfulness, pure—single-syllable yoga, impure—hungry ghost,
[13459] Perverted—wrong-desire migration.
[13460] Moving-maker-grasping mind's mindfulness, pure—wheel-grasping yoga,
[13461] Impure—hell,
[13462] Perverted—suffering-possessing migration.
[13463] That also, thoroughly-investigating mind with wind-horse, from previous-memory following-grasping arises.
[13464] Definitively-settling mind
[13465] With earth-horse, from past-branched memory arises.
[13466] Definitively-grasping mind, arising with water-horse, from present-memory following-grasping arises.
[13467] Mental-consciousness
[13468] From mind-six's knowing-portion gathering arises,
[13469] With mother-horse arises.
[13470] From present-memory near-pointing arises.
[13471] Affliction-possessor
[13472] With water-earth-two-gathered horse, from future-memory following-grasping arises.
[13473] Moving-maker-grasping mind
[13474] Early-late latencies' aggregate gathered, with fire-wind-two horse, from future-memory branching arises.
[13475] Thus by six ripenings, inside consciousness aggregate-six arose.
[13476] By those from individual gathering, eighteen elements growing obtained,
[13477] Obtained, thus abides.
[13478] From those cause-condition, earth-insect eighty-four thousand arose—
[13479] Body by body produces,
[13480] Speech by speech produces,
[13481] Mind by mind produces—
[13482] From Great Arrangement,
[13483] By three productions, migrators
[13484] Individual ripening completed.
[13485] From elements—pure body,
[13486] From syllable—sound voice spoke,
[13487] From memory-life—mind and so forth.
[13488] Thus.
[13489] That also, insect-based syllable and
[13490] That basis body
[13491] Each one abiding as certain basis of body-speech-mind,
[13492] When empowerment and creation-completion meditated, liberation-possible person is called—
[13493] From Entry to Yoga:
[13494] From body and speech and mind itself,
[13495] Yoga seed that complete,
[13496] Here empowerment bestowal is certain.
[13497] Thus it is said.
[13498] Thus upon gathering-memory wheel, collection-dharma root sixteen,
[13499] Wisdom sixteen—thirty-two,
[13500] Syllable sixteen—forty-eight,
[13501] Light-mass sixteen—
[13502] Sixty-four,
[13503] Father sixteen, mother sixteen combined—ninety-six,
[13504] Each father-mother, body-speech-mind gods three-three, gods ninety-six combined—one hundred ninety-two,
[13505] Mind and mental's collection twenty—two hundred twelve,
[13506] Mental's moving-maker action eighteen—two hundred thirty,
[13507] Eighteen elements increase eighteen.
[13508] Two hundred sixty-six,
[13509] Five faculties' basis five,
[13510] Faculties' support five,
[13511] Faculties' doors five combined—two hundred eighty-one,
[13512] Mental's experience, afflictions five-five—thirty combined—three hundred eleven,
[13513] Upon each, mindfulness's radiating and
[13514] Gathering two-two—
[13515] Six hundred twenty-two, eighteen thousand eight and five thousand,
[13516] Upon each, that many syllables,
[13517] That many bodies—four hundred thousand, five ten-thousand, one thousand abiding,
[13518] Inside, disease distinctions cause-condition near-far making,
[13519] Outside, one hundred ten thousand and four ten-thousand hairs producing.
[13520] Those all, basis-all consciousness four-group gathered, from those action-collection,
[13521] Like Vishnu-turtle's form,
[13522] No moving wind at clear faculty-doors,
[13523] No moving power at limb-basis repair—wind's changer not fit for action.
[13524] This itself from increase, moment to moment one hundred twenty thoughts moving measure arose.
[13525] Then also, on the fiftieth day's night going, by water-element's action,
[13526] Body's two wheels abandoned, collection-dharmas scattered by wind,
[13527] By water's gatherer gathered as one,
[13528] Like well-conceived embryo-change seed abiding,
[13529] By earth's weight pressed, quaking and shifting, strength deteriorated.
[13530] Then by fire's power heat lowered, hot contact experienced,
[13531] Like blazing fire burning those radiations,
[13532] Made minute particles.
[13533] Then on the third channel-night, by wind's power those minute particles all quaking-moving-shifting,
[13534] Wind gathered inside, scattered all directions, individually separated.
[13535] At this time, four sufferings experienced:
[13536] By water cold-contact made—mere suffering,
[13537] By earth's weight pressed—
[13538] Suffering by suffering,
[13539] By fire burned—changing suffering,
[13540] By wind scattered—falling-fear's cause, formation-suffering.
[13541] Thus by four days, four elements' own power exhausted,
[13542] Two elements gathering's power's time,
[13543] Taste-gathering channel-petal thirty-two individually ripened, within each—wisdom and
[13544] Light and
[13545] Wind's tone and
[13546] Syllable and
[13547] Light-mass and
[13548] Samantabhadra father-mother's body each ripened—
[13549] Arisen without anyone doing—thus "self-arisen" is called.
[13550] Thus by elements gathering, channels generated,
[13551] By channels' power, body generated,
[13552] By body's power, faculties generated,
[13553] By faculties' power, limbs generated,
[13554] By limbs' power, flesh-blood-heat-breath generated,
[13555] By those four—bones,
[13556] Marrow,
[13557] Fat generated,
[13558] By those—skin and
[13559] Lymph and
[13560] Spittle etc. generated,
[13561] By that—tendons,
[13562] Veins,
[13563] Arteries generated,
[13564] By that—sinews generated,
[13565] By that—all-complete bindu generated,
[13566] By that—again body's wind-mind gathering four generated—
