[7314] At this time, skilled in the key-point of body,
[7315] Without movement from that,
[7316] In seven years reaches the exhaustion-point.
[7317] Speech expression lost,
[7318] By this, in twenty-one months,
[7319] Reaches the ground of dharmatā exhaustion.
[7320] Mind skilled, wind empty,
[7321] In seven months, this fortunate one,
[7322] All appearances become exhausted.
[7323] If of excellent intelligence,
[7324] Beginning with elaborations,
[7325] Without middle interval, gradually,
[7326] The manner of completing empowerments,
[7327] For those who become supreme—
[7328] This is extremely rare.
[7329] In the interval of days, months, and years,
[7330] Suitable to self-experience,
[7331] Complete the four empowerments.
[7332] If the four empowerments not complete,
[7333] The extremely non-elaboration empowerment,
[7334] The field of realizing profound parts,
[7335] By bestowing this, empowerment is obtained.
[7336] Having excellently examined the student's characteristics,
[7337] Two, three, etcetera,
[7338] Suitable to the student's capacity,
[7339] Finally by self-experience,
[7340] At special time, supreme is definitely explained.
[7341] For the son, to enter capability.
[7342] Thus it is spoken.
[7343] Fifth, the sequence of making celebration:
[7344] From the Magical Display:
[7345] "Great compassion, great celebration."
[7346] Thus it is spoken.
[7347] From the Empowerment King Tantra:
[7348] "To the ripening guru of empowerment,
[7349] Supreme offering of gold and silver,
[7350] By offering self-body equal,
[7351] Buddha-fruit easily,
[7352] From saṃsāra having taken breath,
[7353] Definitely obtain, without doubt."
[7354] Thus it is spoken.
[7355] From the Empowerment Jewel Tantra:
[7356] "Result easy and effortless,
[7357] Mind-generate awakening completed,
[7358] Called guru for fulfilling needs and desires,
[7359] Definitely similar to the cow of desires."
[7360] Thus it is spoken.
[7361] That also, after empowerment, by making offering and celebration,
[7362] Here also obtaining the perfections of self-desired meaning,
[7363] And in future time, perfections of power
[7364] Obtain qualities of glory and goodness,
[7365] After that, manifestly perfect awakening in the ornament-arranged field.
[7366] Thus also, from the Empowerment Infinite:
[7367] "Completing the meanings of desire,
[7368] Glory, fame, and wisdom,
[7369] Giving excellent power,
[7370] In the well-arranged Buddha-field,
[7371] Manifestly perfect awakening."
[7372] Thus it is spoken.
[7373] That also, rather than gathering numberless accumulations at another time,
[7374] At this time, the gathered increases by a hundred-thousand-fold.
[7375] By that power, all meanings of mind are accomplished here,
[7376] And without difficulty arises the definite accomplishment of special gatherings of food, wealth, etc.
[7377] From completing the two accumulations, the two kāyas are accomplished.
[7378] From the Empowerment Jewel Arrangement:
[7379] "The fortunate one who relied on empowerment,
[7380] Result of completed two accumulations,
[7381] Definitely obtains the meaning of the two supreme."
[7382] Thus it is spoken.
[7383] At this time, having offered to the root guru food, drink, wealth, etc., each one,
[7384] And having offered hundreds at another time, the merit of offering here is great.
[7385] The merit of giving to one woman at this time,
[7386] And giving to one man,
[7387] And elsewhere, the merit of having done great feast offerings to a hundred ḍākinīs—
[7388] Giving these two at this time to one is superior.
[7388] That also, at this time, all Buddhas of the ten directions gathered compassion into one,
[7389] Doing the action of empowerment, turning the unsurpassed wheel,
[7390] Entering self into the town of great liberation—by superior kindness;
[7391] Also to women and men,
[7392] Heroes and heroines with support, abiding in the row of empowerment through compassion and samaya, giving blessing—
[7393] The two times of empowerment and celebration increase by a hundred-thousand-fold compared to others.
[7394] Thus also:
[7395] From the Essence of Divided Empowerments:
[7396] "By worship with great celebration,
[7397] To guru and guru's retinue,
[7398] All together with mother,
[7399] Whoever makes feast,
[7400] In inconceivable hundred-thousand eons,
[7401] Having pleased all Buddhas,
[7402] The part of this merit is not equal.
[7403] If touching
[7404] With sandalwood the guru's pore,
[7405] This merit is limitless.
[7406] Thus own vajra siblings,
[7407] One, two, or three,
[7408] Or hundreds, thousands, numberless,
[7409] Whoever makes feast celebration,
[7410] If not at empowerment time,
[7411] Worship own guru,
[7412] Having done hundreds numberless,
[7413] The merit of doing one at this
[7414] Mind is not able to measure.
[7415] By feast of food and drink with great result,
[7416] If yogis are pleased,
[7417] All goodness is accomplished,
[7418] And liberated from faults.
[7419] If vajra sister or
[7420] Guru's student,
[7421] To the gathering of yoginīs,
[7422] If pleased by feast celebration,
[7423] To eight mothers or pig-mother,
[7424] Feast offerings nine hundred
[7425] Done at wrong time,
[7426] At this time to one yoginī,
[7427] Food or drink or,
[7428] If even little thirst is given,
[7429] This merit is not equal.
[7430] Therefore to mother's city,
[7431] Having gone, please the yoginī.
[7432] Yogi father and mother two,
[7433] Equal and mixed worship,
[7434] Here this siddhi,
