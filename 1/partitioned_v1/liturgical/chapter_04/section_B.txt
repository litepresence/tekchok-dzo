[5585] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter seven—annotation.
[5586] Thus it is: SHAM PADZRA MU TAD YA BYA NYA PRA PA RA DUS STAN KA HIH—its meaning:
[5587] By wisdom's meaning, realized;
[5588] Time-unchanging wisdom, ignorance by nature conquered.
[5589] Dharmadhātu's equality, surrounded and endowed.
[5590] In self always existing, pervasion threefold endowed.
[5591] Equality-day's wisdom, self-arisen.
[5592] Further:

[5594] Thus it is: MAṂ GAM HA SA HŪM—accomplishing, MA LA MA LA DHA THIM DHA THIM—its meaning:
[5595] Self's rigpa, equal-pure body's form, realized.
[5596] That too, by self-arisen emptiness-wisdom, pervaded, realized.
[5597] That too, to self-entity's ground, complete parinirvāṇa, realized.
[5598] Three kāyas, gathering-separating without, meaning realized.
[5599] All dharmas, equality, non-dual, realized.
[5600] From that, compassion unceasing, like sun-rays, shines.
[5601] Conceptual wisdom, self-place grasped.
[5602] Further:
[5603] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter nine—annotation.
[5604] Thus it is: TA KA YU MU SHA SU MA HĀ DU BHĀRI KE HĀ KE HĀ—
[5605] Unchanging, three kāyas' ground, pressed.
[5606] All-times wisdom, always abiding, dharma-pure wisdom-heart possessed;
[5607] Equality-wisdom's self-nature become.
[5608] To emptiness, three compassions, one time arising—that too, unceasing manner, equality-wisdom's kāya, not gone beyond.
[5609] Unchanging wisdom, self-constituent, explained.
[5610] Sound's place, many letters stacked: vowel and NA RO below, in order given, with GU GU, thus read;
[5611] Head-circle below's top, placed.
[5612] This letter-place is the bind of seventeen tantras' internals;
[5613] Wherever tantra's place arises, thus understand.
[5614] These stacked letter examples, from Samantabhadra's mind-mirror arisen, like.
[5615] This letter-wheel's order, tantra's difficult place, is.
[5626] Know meaning great penetrate thinking here well established.
[5627] Second topic introduction definite enumerate explained two:
[5628] Generally shown and,
[5629] Particularly explained.
[5630] First is:
[5631] Secret unsurpassed tantras meanings minds types two bound explained,
[5632] Awareness self-appearance mind-possessors mind,
[5633] Tantra name-meaning division and,
[5634] Focus object mind-possessors mind tantra text definitely shown.
[5635] Thus also from Talgyur:
[5636] E MA tantra definite arisen,
[5637] Minds types two are,
[5638] Awareness self-appearance mind-possessors,
[5639] Tantra name-meaning divided,
[5640] Symbol sound meaning three by,
[5641] Reality direct path made,
[5642] Three realms saṃsāra continuum cut,
[5643] Outside reverse not,
[5644] Exhaustion characteristics know.
[5645] Focus object mind-possessors,
[5646] Tantra text meaning divided,
[5647] Whatever whatever certain key point,
[5648] Each key point inserted,
[5649] Not-separated completely realized,
[5650] Saṃsāra pure abide not,
[5651] Elaborations joy person,
[5652] Various means trained become,
[5653] That also individual siddhis obtained.
[5654] Mind key point oral instruction,
[5655] Individual occasions know.
[5656] Thus it is spoken.
[5657] Here explanation manner four person's mind types liberated divided:
[5658] Mind elaborations with those introduction five perfections manner tantra outer explained,
[5659] Mind elaborations without those text meaning oral instruction definite inner explained,
[5660] Mind very elaborations without those name self-text realize secret explained,
[5661] Mind extremely elaborations without those tantra meaning condensed secret unsurpassed great perfection explained.
[5662] First is:
[5663] The tantra-body's introduction,
[5664] Which arises from the introduction-base, explains the meaning of the twofold introduction.
[5665] Second: Those meanings are summarized through the eleven words of instruction, establishing the eleven categories of verbal meaning.
[5666] Third:
[5667] Thus the eleven are gathered into cutting-through and crossing-over, binding the two stages of practice, explained thus.
[5668] Fourth:
[5669] All are gathered into the single meaning of direct awareness, suitable to awareness itself.
[5670] Thus the fourfold Great Secret is established in meaning.
[5671] The root vajra's four bonds are named:
[5672] The great Paṇḍita Vimalamitra's supreme view.
[5673] Second, explained particularly in three parts:
[5674] The connection of the two introduction-bases.
[5675] The individual meanings extensively explained.
[5676] Abandoning mistaken refutations.
[5677] First:
[5678] The tantra's meaning is summarized,
[5679] The title shown,
[5680] The twofold text.
[5681] The body of the text arranged,
[5682] The limbs extensively explained in two parts.
[5683] The body extensively explained, briefly shown, gathered.
[5684] Through the introduction-base, all tantras are shown to arise.
[5685] From the Treasury:
[5686] The clear sequence of words spoken,
[5687] The title shown, and through the text,
[5688] The minds of length and instant, variously.
[5689] To be realized, variously explained.
[5690] The twofold text-types distinguished.
[5691] The body itself arranged,
[5692] The limbs' meaning extensively divided.
[5693] The body's introduction-base is twofold.
[5694] Thus it is.
[5695] Each of the two introductions:
[5696] The teacher perfected,
[5697] The place perfected,
[5698] The retinue perfected,
[5699] The dharma perfected,
[5700] The time perfected, abiding as fivefold.
[5701] From the Sun-Moon Union:
[5702] The great secret tantras,
[5703] Possessing the five perfections.
[5704] Common and uncommon,
[5705] The seeds of the introduction-bases.
[5706] Thus.
[5707] From the Treasury:
[5708] The first of the four introductions arising from the tantra.
[5709] Holding the seeds of the five.
[5710] Thus it is spoken.
[5711] These two perfections give rise to the fivefold reasons, namely:
[5712] Common and uncommon reasons.
[5713] First:
[5714] Whatever tantra has arisen, the teacher and retinue are therein certain to be taught.
[5715] That time and place are certain to exist.
[5716] Those gathered simultaneously arise in time.
[5717] Second:
[5718] When matter and consciousness gather, the body serves as support, placed in a certain abode.
[5719] In the field of form aggregates,
[5720] The consciousness as teacher,
[5721] Gathered with perception as retinue.
[5722] The teaching of feeling arises.
[5723] Formations have five times, certain.
[5724] Those five impure aggregates of the disciple-base are
[5725] Tamed by the five perfections of the introduction-base.
[5726] Suitable for disciple and method.
[5727] From that itself:
[5728] The individual persons of disciples.
[5729] The five types of disciple-base aggregates.
[5730] The introduction-base of that method.
[5731] Thus it is spoken.
[5732] That also is called the five perfections of the introduction-base, namely:
[5733] Basis:
[5734] Abode,
[5735] Time,
[5736] Teacher,
[5737] Retinue,
[5738] The five dharmas.
[5739] Each of those also becomes threefold.
[5740] From the Treasury:
[5741] The introduction is expressed in words.
[5742] The basis has five types.
[5743] Abode is accepted as threefold.
[5744] What is called perfection is gathered.
[5745] The three appear as numbers.
[5746] The gathering of qualities is complete.
[5747] The teacher himself is also threefold.
[5748] What is called perfection is the completion of the kāyas.
[5749] The three kāyas arise as three.
[5750] The gathering of retinue is assembled.
[5751] The retinue is also threefold.
[5752] What is called perfection is arranged in form.
[5753] The three appear as various gatherings.
[5754] The gathering of faith and aspiration.
[5755] The teaching itself is also threefold.
[5756] What is called perfection is the very essence.
[5757] The three are the precious collections.
[5758] The gathering liberates persons.
[5759] Time also has three gathering into four.
[5760] The perfection of all vehicles.
[5761] The three are past, present,
[5762] The gathering is definitively complete.
[5763] Thus.
[5764] Second, the individual meanings extensively explained in two parts.
[5765] Uncommon introduction and,
[5766] Common introduction extensively explained.
[5767] First is:
[5768] Awareness wisdom abiding manner five perfections possessing abiding,
[5769] Uncommon introduction expressed shown.
[5770] That also clear light tantras beginning,
[5771] Thus I taught time once,
[5772] Thus arising is.
[5773] Manner basis thing nature abode ultimate truth showing,
[5774] Vehicles dark sūtra tantra surpassing,
[5775] From Talgyur:
[5776] Uncommon distinguished,
[5777] Vehicles all surpassing sign.
[5778] Thus it is spoken.
[5779] Here divide two:
[5780] Basis thing nature abode five perfections possessing shown and,
[5781] That arrangement body how abiding five perfections.
[5782] First is:
[5783] Abode perfection,
[5784] Reality elaborations free characteristics wherever not-established,
[5785] Words letters sphere not.
[5786] Thing abiding manner teacher perfection:
[5787] Elaboration-basis word only not thing signs not-established self-arisen awareness.
[5788] Teacher that retinue perfection.
[5789] Reality's play wisdom ocean's collection.
[5790] Teaching perfection,
[5791] Nature equality dharmadhātu ultimate abode great perfection tathātā.
[5792] Time perfection,
[5793] All not-separate one and many both not reality inconceivable clear light great time.
[5794] Thus also:
[5795] From Ratnaketu:
[5796] Not-existing empty dharmadhātu from,
[5797] Primordial first Buddha by,
[5798] Awareness and wisdom distinction from,
[5799] Reality empty self-sound,
[5800] Primordially dharma wheel turned,
[5801] Beginning middle end without.
[5802] Thus spoken and:
[5803] Secret great's self-sphere in,
[5804] Primordially abiding from,
[5805] Not-grasped abode manner possessing,
[5806] Play great first arisen.
[5807] Thus it is spoken.
[5808] Second body's five perfections:
[5809] Abode perfection,
[5810] CITTA jewel palace channel essence great center in,
[5811] Teacher perfection,
[5812] Self-arisen awareness clear light supreme unchanging nature nature compassion three nature,
[5813] Five kāyas,
[5814] Five wisdoms,
[5815] Five lights,
[5816] Five wisdoms,
[5817] Five winds,
[5818] Bindu tiny etcetera retinue perfection surrounding,
[5819] Dharma perfection,
[5820] Channel wind bindu key points and,
[5821] Key point arisen bliss-clear non-conceptual wisdom advice practice experience with,
[5822] Time perfection,
[5823] Awareness meaning familiar self-arisen self arisen,
[5824] From Sun-Moon-Joined:
[5825] CITTA jewel palace,
[5826] Self-awareness wisdom manifest arisen,
[5827] Wisdom self-arisen teacher great,
[5828] Kāyas and wisdoms bindus,
[5829] Non-conceptual enumerate retinue arisen,
[5830] Advice practice teaching manner,
[5831] That familiar time also.
[5832] Thus and:
[5833] From Talgyur:
[5834] Retinue and transcended beginning,
[5835] Self-arisen made without from,
[5836] Elements gathered aggregates arisen,
[5837] Earth water fire wind jewel four,
[5838] Center wind-mind cause and condition,
[5839] Gathered produced palace without,
[5840] Self-arisen awareness unaltered,
[5841] Delusion completely pure,
[5842] Great bliss gathered means retinue,
[5843] Kāyas and wisdoms wisdom winds,
[5844] Not-divide various focus without,
[5845] Channel wind means great bliss dharmas,
[5846] Individual experience suitable explained.
[5847] Past future present not,
[5848] Not-divide division completely not,
[5849] All self-arisen wisdom.
[5850] Thus it is spoken.
[5851] Incidentally mind gathered one gathered five perfections:
[5852] The perfection of place—
[5853] Within the vast and open sky of dharmadhātu's spacious expanse,
[5854] The perfection of teacher—
[5855] Samantabhadra, gathering the hosts of self-mind's delusion-appearances.
[5856] The perfection of retinue—
[5857] The five outer objects,
[5858] The six inner thought-collections, habitual delusion-appearances.
[5859] The perfection of teaching—
[5860] The dharmas of saṃsāra: grasping, holding, self, other, karma, and afflictions.
[5861] The perfection of time—
[5862] From beginningless and endless time, the moment consciousness grasps at appearances through conceptual analysis, absorption, higher realms, and habitual tendencies.
[5863] In summary: delusion-appearances arisen in mind, the dharmas of saṃsāra gathered under the name of five perfections are shown,
[5864] From the Ratnaketu Tantra:
[5865] From the pure aspect of appearance-making and grasping,
[5866] Outer objects appear like a retinue.
[5867] Thus it is spoken.
[5868] Second, the common prologue extensively explained:
[5869] From the Thalgyur:
[5870] The teacher's speech reveals to the retinue,
[5871] The chief of marvelous, supreme gathered teachings.
[5872] The common prologue of causes and conditions,
[5873] To accord with the door of other scriptures,
[5874] Is famously called "common."
[5875] Thus:
[5876] As it appears in the scriptures and tantras of common vehicles,
[5877] So too in this great secret definitive tantra,
[5878] Following the uncommon prologue,
[5879] "Thus have I heard at one time," and so forth, is spoken.
[5880] That also shows accordance with all vehicle scriptures,
[5881] For the meaning is uncommon;
[5882] That meaning is shown through explanation,
[5883] Abandoning doubt about where, when, by which teacher, to which retinue, this doctrine was taught—the common prologue is spoken with these in mind.
[5884] How is it spoken? At the time the tantra arose, where was the place?
[5885] That teacher, being of one essence with the three kāyas, must speak;
[5886] The manner:
[5887] Dharmakāya—speech of meaning-essence through blessing,
[5888] Saṃbhogakāya—speech that distinguishes pure, clear self-nature,
[5889] Nirmāṇakāya—speech in the manner of the sixty melodious speech-qualities, well-arranged in word and verse.
[5890] Those words also, from the hearer's consciousness,
[5891] Arise without sound or letters in meaning.
[5892] From the Uttaratantra:
[5893] Like an echo, without letters,
[5894] Thus it is spoken.
[5895] As the sound of an echo—
[5896] Arising from another's awareness,
[5897] Without concept, without fabrication,
[5898] Thus is the Tathāgata's speech.
[5899] Without concept, without fabrication,
[5900] Neither abiding outside nor within.
[5901] By this manner.
[5902] Regarding that, the places where the tantra arises are of three types:
[5903] Dharmakāya's abode:
[5904] Within the great palace of dharmadhātu,
[5905] Teacher Samantabhadra,
[5906] To the gathering of the ocean of wisdom-retinue,
[5907] The Dharma of Great Perfection, self-nature,
[5908] At the time beyond expression of dharmatā,
[5909] Is spoken without words or letters.
[5910] Saṃbhogakāya's abode:
[5911] Within the dense array of complete purity,
[5912] Teacher Saṃbhogakāya Vairocana, to the retinue—the five rigpa-Buddhas,
[5913] The five mothers such as Ākāśadhātvīśvarī,
[5914] Bodhisattvas such as Kṣitigarbha,
[5915] Consorts such as Mohinī,
[5916] Within the self-appearing maṇḍala filling the whole of space,
[5917] Enumerates the unsurpassed Great Vehicle Dharma—
[5918] Though not spoken from tongue with the vowel-sounds of the six letters' self-sound, makes understood
[5919] At the time of wisdom's self-appearance.
[5920] Nirmāṇakāya's abode: Tuṣita upper chamber and so forth,
[5921] Teacher Vajradhara, Vajrasattva, abiding in wisdom-illusion body,
[5922] To retinue transcending the world, appearing as guides of the fortunate, and
[5923] Bodhisattvas,
[5924] Siddhas,
[5925] Wisdom ḍākinīs,
[5926] Worldly retinue—gods,
[5927] Humans,
[5928] Asuras,
[5929] Garuḍas,
[5930] Gandharvas,
[5931] Nāgas, and countless others,
[5932] Teaches inconceivable sūtras and tantras,
[5933] For time spanning eons immeasurable to a hundred.
[5934] These are called the perfection of abode, occasion, and time,
[5935] From the Thalgyur:
[5936] The bases are of five types,
[5937] The abodes are held to be of three types.
[5938] This is the meaning.
[5939] Also from the Ratnaketu:
[5940] Dharmakāya, self-pure grasping,
[5941] Within the self-pure elaborationless celestial palace,
[5942] To the retinue of appearances inseparable from itself,
[5943] By means of signless speech,
[5944] Elaborationless dharmas,
[5945] Arise from mind as non-abiding, self-exhausted.
[5946] Without spoken, without speech,
[5947] Shown in the state of great equality.
[5948] By Saṃbhogakāya, self-clear and pure,
[5949] From the pure celestial palace of five lights,
[5950] By means of elaborationless great bliss speech,
[5951] To the retinue of the five kāyas and families,
[5952] Entityless, pure dharmas
[5953] Arise from mind as five wisdoms gathered.
[5954] From the tongue spreading pure light-rays,
[5955] The six self-arisen letters also,
[5956] Great self-arisen shown without speaking.
[5957] By Nirmāṇakāya without attachment,
[5958] Dharma also from the disciple's own abode,
[5959] To the fortunate awakened from the six families,
[5960] By means of speech with words and elaborations,
[5961] Whatever dharmas faculties desire,
[5962] From mind, self-clear mindfulness,
[5963] Spread upon the tongue of faculties without desire,
[5964] Shown as dharmas of numbered vehicles.
[5965] Thus by the excellent explanation of three kāyas and speech,
[5966] The minds of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and
[5967] All Buddhas are satisfied;
[5968] Thus the hopes of beings are fulfilled.
[5969] Thus it is spoken.
[5970] Thus, when the meaning and purpose of the two prologues shown are arranged:
[5971] "Thus at one time I taught" means
[5972] Vajrapāṇi, having promised "I shall teach the retinue completely what I heard from glorious Samantabhadra before," or
[5973] Vajrapāṇi himself, accepting to be the teacher of the tantra, taught to the retinue saying "I taught."
[5974] From the Thalgyur:
[5975] The teacher's speech reveals to the retinue.
[5976] Thus it is spoken.
[5977] That also, Vajradhara is Buddha;
[5978] From the Śrīparamādi:
[5979] Buddha before all Buddhas,
[5980] Vajradhara, king, vajra-mind.
[5981] Thus it is spoken.
[5982] From the Training Tantra:
[5983] Buddha before all Buddhas,
[5984] Destroyer of all ignorance's stains.
[5985] Vajra, Vajra-holder, king,
[5986] Vajra, Vajra, Vajra-holder,
[5987] Vajrapāṇi, Mahāmudrā.
[5988] Thus it is spoken.
[5989] "Thus at one time I heard" means: Vajrapāṇi, at the time when I actually heard before from teacher Samantabhadra, great Vajradhara—
[5990] Thinking that the compiler's Dharma was awakened into by former victors having accepted it into heart,
[5991] And the lineage unbroken in the middle,
[5992] And the meaning of the three times' Dharma enumerations harmonious,
[5993] Is shown in order to generate faith in the retinue.
[5994] From the Thalgyur:
[5995] In order to accord with the door of other vehicles,
[5996] By means of the common prologue,
[5997] To the compiler's own retinue,
[5998] In order to make faith,
[5999] It is shown—from the disciple as the basis,
[6000] By making taming,
[6001] Arisen, makes the teaching abide.
[6002] Thus it is spoken.
[6003] Third: abandoning refutations of wrong understanding:
[6004] Some, having no opportunity to view the form of the vast ocean of Dharma with the closed eye of intellect, say:
[6005] "In other sūtras and tantras, 'Thus have I heard' is spoken,
[6006] 'Taught' does not arise here, so it is fabricated."
[6007] If "taught" becomes fabricated,
[6008] From the Cakrasamvara Root Tantra:
[6009] "Then the secret must be taught,"
[6010] Thus it is spoken;
[6011] That also has the fault of falling into fabrication.
[6012] Moreover, if saying that showing twice is not valid,
[6013] It follows that the entirety of the melodious-expressed section is not valid;
[6014] For the purpose of showing, after one prose, one verse is repeated,
[6015] And showing the name twice also follows as not valid.
[6016] Therefore, showing the arising of the meaning-tantra is the uncommon prologue;
[6017] Showing the arising of the word-tantra, indicating, is the common prologue—
[6018] Upon the non-contradictory, again very connected, it is shown.
[6019] By these, the definitive meaning of the prologue is shown.
[6020] Knowing this much, in order to know the structure and understood meaning of the tantras, it is arranged and established here in this context.
[6021] Third meaning: the prophecy of the sacred definitive teaching—
[6022] The teaching of vajra-essence,
[6023] The seed-kāya of the teaching,
[6024] The self-arisen letter,
[6025] The three vajras,
[6026] The sequence of persons holding these, arising before and after—
[6027] Showing these three meanings: the manner of the teaching's descent generally shown,
[6028] Its flourishing and decline explained in particular,
[6029] The persons who hold it shown.
[6030] First:
[6031] At the time of the arrangement of the great Brahma aeon by primordial Samantabhadra,
[6032] From that blessing, the Buddha-emanation Vajradhara arose from dharmakāya to saṃbhogakāya;
[6033] At the time of the kāyas such as Vairocana, arranging the great Brahma aeon,
[6034] Acting for the benefit of disciples through various emanation-kāyas—
[6035] At the beginning of that aeon, the actual teaching of Great Perfection to dharmakāya,
[6036] The teaching-sound of saṃbhogakāya self-sounding,
[6037] Acting for benefit through the manifestation-appearance of emanation-kāya,
[6038] And the vajra arisen from that blessing,
[6039] The texts,
[6040] The kāya images gradually descended,
[6041] Holding the actual and reflected teaching—
[6042] The spontaneous arising of benefit for sentient beings from Buddha:
[6043] From the aeon of the first emanation's awakening,
[6044] Before this field was formed at that time, going as emanation to other fields and acting for benefit,
[6045] Now acting for benefit through the appearance of a thousand Buddhas in this Saha field—these are the blessings of the three.
[6046] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6047] The seventeen definitive secret commands,
[6048] Together with the teaching's light-arrow and miraculous letter,
[6049] At the beginning of the emanation-kāya's field,
[6050] Teacher Samantabhadra,
[6051] Held in the place of dense array.
[6052] Then in the abode of Tuṣita,
[6053] Rigpa-Vairocana,
[6054] Holding this, ripened the five rigpas.
[6055] Past that, held by me,
[6056] The sacred life-tree of the teaching—
[6057] A thousand Buddhas and two roots,
[6058] Relying upon this, definitively arise.
[6059] Miraculous and egg-born,
[6060] Warmth and womb-born,
[6061] Ripen sentient beings.
[6062] From this very teaching of disciples,
[6063] Twelve Dharma wheels arose.
[6064] By this, thirty-six deeds
[6065] Relying upon the three kāyas,
[6066] Appear to sentient beings, objects of disciples.
[6067] Thus it is spoken.
[6068] If these manners are extensively shown:
[6069] After Vajradhara, having arranged the great Brahma aeon, passed through numberless, inconceivable aeons,
[6070] At the beginning of this field's formation,
[6071] From here, in the northern direction, in the field called "Moving-Possessing,"
[6072] Those three seeds of the teaching abide.
[6073] In that field, through the individual karma of sentient beings,
[6074] The seven times of arising of these,
[6075] The seven times of non-arising—fourteen—became flourishing and decline.
[6076] From that, the seven times of arising are:
[6077] Endowment,
[6078] Perfection,
[6079] Great Perfection,
[6080] Two-Possessing,
[6081] Three-Possessing,
[6082] Strife-Possessing,
[6083] Great Strife-Possessing.
[6084] Between each of those, declining, are called the seven dark aeons.
[6085] Then, the vessel and environment of this field formed; at the first aeon, in Tuṣita stacked,
[6086] The teacher came;
[6087] Those three seeds descended here,
[6088] Made to flourish and decline by the seven sequences,
[6089] Finally leaping to another.
[6090] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6091] Thus to this very teaching,
[6092] The remaining teaching thus,
[6093] Explained as definitively great by time.
[6094] Endowment and Perfection,
[6095] Perfections, the great,
[6096] Thus Two-Possessing and Three-Possessing,
[6097] Strife-Possessing and Great Strife,
[6098] Between each of those,
[6099] In sixty dark aeons,
[6100] The teaching's seed becomes other.
[6101] The northern direction, Moving-Possessing,
[6102] The teaching's lamp abides there,
[6103] Called "Glorious Protector,"
[6104] Monks will hold.
[6105] That patron, the king,
[6106] Called Jinamitra,
[6107] Makes the secret basis of the teaching.
[6108] Abides for one thousand three hundred years.
[6109] Then the dark aeon
[6110] Abides between sixty.
[6111] Then the southern direction, Sthalaskandha,
[6112] In the wide and beautiful continent,
[6113] The teaching's life-tree descended there,
[6114] Called "Joy-Glorious,"
[6115] By the Tuṣita family gathering,
[6116] This teaching will be held.
[6117] That patron, householder family,
[6118] Called "Virtue-Accomplishment,"
[6119] Makes to abide for a hundred years.
[6120] Then becomes the dark aeon,
[6121] Becomes one hundred twenty years.
[6122] Then the eastern direction, Bliss River,
[6123] At the peak of Vajra-Arising Mountain,
[6124] This sacred teaching descended,
[6125] Called "Sūtra Collection,"
[6126] The king himself holds the teaching.
[6127] That patron, the brahmin,
[6128] Called Jayākara,
[6129] Abides for one thousand four hundred years.
[6130] After that, the dark aeon
[6131] Becomes five thousand years.
[6132] Then the western direction, Affection Continent,
[6133] Called Bhatisali,
[6134] Also to the good family of beings,
[6135] Again the three essences descended,
[6136] Also by the monk Bliss-Protector,
[6137] This sacred teaching held,
[6138] That patron, the hero
[6139] By outcaste family for a thousand years,
[6140] Made this abiding and flourishing.
[6141] After that passed, darkness below,
[6142] Abides for five thousand years.
[6143] Then again descended here,
[6144] To the place called Vajra Seat,
[6145] This flourishing, light blazing,
[6146] For five hundred fifty years.
[6147] This is held by Lodrö Zangpo;
[6148] That patron, a ḍākinī,
[6149] Made cool and pure.
[6150] After that, this world,
[6151] Earth, water, fire, and wind clash and disturb,
[6152] Becomes the non-abiding great emptiness.
[6153] From the first called aeon,
[6154] The time of final destruction arises.
[6155] Thus it is spoken.
[6156] Lodrö Zangpo is all who hold this;
[6157] Five hundred years is a great year,
[6158] Passed in five hundreds.
[6159] That much appearing to humans from the first aeon to this interval of ten years of life, the primordial—
[6160] Others, not, do benefit in the abode of ḍākinīs.
[6161] Second, the particular explanation of flourishing and decline:
[6162] In this Jambudvīpa, now, until the primordial, the seven types of flourishing and decline arising in this interval of ten years of life are:
[6163] From the Great Arrangement of Ati:
[6164] Listen, fortunate Śāriputra,
[6165] The sacred teaching's vast, great arrangement,
[6166] The supreme essence repeatedly gathered,
[6167] This gold-essence sun-illuminator,
[6168] Does not flourish mixed with the common,
[6169] Appears to some possessing the great secret family.
[6170] In the time of degenerate strife-possessing, coarse affliction,
[6171] Factions, internal quarrels, all hermitages destroyed.
[6172] Royal law not abiding, self-pride, kingly conduct of desire,
[6173] Father and son quarrel, weapons protect bodies.
[6174] Accumulated groups lost, earth's essences exhausted,
[6175] Unsuitable views and conduct also many arise.
[6176] Five hundred degenerations, life years gradually decline,
[6177] Life of sixty years, little merit and fortune,
[6178] This essence abides for sixty years.
[6179] After that passed, in the interval of a hundred years,
[6180] This secret not abiding, conduct of reasoning.
[6181] After that passed, even in a thousand years,
[6182] From the person without study and contemplation,
[6183] This supreme secret becomes like the sun.
[6184] After that passed, becomes darkness for two hundred.
[6185] Then, when life years are forty,
[6186] This essence abides for the interval of a hundred years.
[6187] After that passed, becomes darkness for thirty.
[6188] After that passed, abiding for the interval of a hundred years,
[6189] When beings' life is thirty years,
[6190] This supreme secret declines, flourishes for eight hundred years of distant benefit,
[6191] This not arising when life is twenty.
[6192] When life is ten years, this essence arises;
[6193] Whoever meets this, arising self-dissolves.
[6194] The teaching's seed dissolved in sky, not appearing to people,
[6195] Again, the teaching's ember becomes other.
[6196] Thus it is spoken.
[6197] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6198] The near cause of destroying the teaching—
[6199] In those individual abodes,
[6200] Called "person possessing wrong desire,"
[6201] Each, by all teaching,
[6202] Is the near cause of destroying.
[6203] This, at the first time of darkness,
[6204] In the west of Jambudvīpa,
[6205] A king with six fingers on the hand,
[6206] Having blue extra teeth in front,
[6207] On the right hand's wrist,
[6208] A black mole, shape of sin,
[6209] Possessing great terror—
[6210] The Buddha's teaching becomes darkness.
[6211] Becomes for the interval of sixty years.
[6212] Then, first held by Palden;
[6213] After passing one thousand three hundred,
[6214] Again, in the north of Jambudvīpa,
[6215] At the root of the radiant mountain,
[6216] An ascetic's form without loving mind,
[6217] Two ears on the right,
[6218] Eyes with three corners, eyelids covering upward.
[6219] This, quarreling with tīrthika factions,
[6220] Darkness for sixty years.
[6221] After that, called Deva of Bliss,
[6222] Makes flourishing for the interval of a hundred years.
[6223] After that passed, in the northeast of Jambudvīpa,
[6224] At the root where the great river Rab-me flows,
[6225] A king's body possessing merit,
[6226] Not having even one eye,
[6227] Coarse limbs, powerful body,
[6228] Adorned with archery and craft.
[6229] By this, suppressing the Dharma-doer,
[6230] The teaching for sixty years.
[6231] Here, from the west, becomes other.
[6232] After that passed, in Pratyekabuddha form,
[6233] Arising from Vajra Seat to the west.
[6234] By that, the sacred teaching
[6235] Abides for one hundred twenty years.
[6236] After that passed, below, in the center of Jambudvīpa,
[6237] In the place called Golden City,
[6238] An elder's body with two tongue-tips,
[6239] Small hump, short limbs,
[6240] Factions quarreling, holding weapons.
[6241] By this arising, also darkness,
[6242] For the interval of sixty years.
[6243] After that passed, below, in the east of Jambudvīpa,
[6244] The rivers Lokita,
[6245] On the right-direction banks,
[6246] Called Glorious Lion,
[6247] Abides for one thousand four hundred years.
[6248] Then again, in the center of Jambudvīpa,
[6249] On the bank of the great river Gaṅgā,
[6250] A king's son, shoulder
[6251] Similar to the color of down,
[6252] Ordained, four fingers measure.
[6253] By this arising, also darkness,
[6254] For the interval of sixty years.
[6255] After that passed, below, in Kāmarūpa,
[6256] The monastery called Śīla,
[6257] That master, protector of youth,
[6258] By this, abides for the interval of a thousand.
[6259] After that, in the south of Jambudvīpa,
[6260] The town called Brahma's Island,
[6261] To a common family, lion head
[6262] This, three months after birth,
[6263] Becomes darkness for the interval of sixty.
[6264] After that, at Vulture Peak,
[6265] By the monk Śobhya-youth,
[6266] Abides for five hundred fifty years.
[6267] After that passed, below, at the border of Jambudvīpa,
[6268] In the land called Kāśmīra,
[6269] In the sound-possessing city,
[6270] Bird body, human face,
[6271] Born among low-caste families.
[6272] This, ten years after birth,
[6273] Becomes darkness for sixty.
[6274] After that passed, below, in Jambudvīpa,
[6275] In the center, five yojanas to the east,
[6276] By the monk Śākya Jīka,
[6277] This, for the interval of ten years,
[6278] Becomes like a blazing lamp.
[6279] Thus by the seven sequences,
[6280] Flourishing and decline are made in Jambudvīpa.
[6281] Thus it is spoken.
[6282] Thus, the seven complete flourishing and declining, after life of ten years, below, up to here, the three seeds of the teaching do not abide in this field;
[6283] From here, descended to the field of beautiful arrangement in the southern direction, at the time of the completion of that field's deeds by the seven flourishing and declining,
[6284] The time of Saha's emptiness;
[6285] Again, those three leap to the vast protector world of the northern direction,
[6286] After the Buddha Beautiful-Utpala-Flower held and did the seven flourishing and declining,
[6287] Leap to the world called "Vast Sound Topknot" in the western direction,
[6288] After the Buddha Destroyer-of-Saṃsāra held and abided for seven hundred-thousand years in the manner of seven flourishing and declining,
[6289] All beings of all fields existing in the great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara, along with that field, are liberated in the primordial ground;
[6290] The great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara, with vessel and environment, becomes empty,
[6291] Abides for eighty-five aeons as one sky.
[6292] The three seeds of the teaching:
[6293] By Vajradhara's great deeds completed,
[6294] Dissolve themselves in the peaceful sphere of dharmatā, not appearing to people.
[6295] Then again, beings appearing from the sphere, and by emanation, arrange the great Brahma—
[6296] At the time when the teacher of taming-making came to the appearance of disciples for six hundred-thousand aeons,
[6297] From Samantabhadra's blessing,
[6298] The three seeds of the teaching self-arose, explained as arising for the benefit of sentient beings without flourishing and decline.
[6299] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6300] Then from the beautiful arrangement,
[6301] Leaped to those fields,
[6302] After life years of ten,
[6303] Here not abiding, appearing there.
[6304] Thus from completed flourishing and decline,
[6305] This essence of the sacred teaching,
[6306] In the vast protector world,
[6307] Making the Buddha's teaching abide—
[6308] Called Beautiful-Utpala-Flower,
[6309] Teacher Buddha, Bhagavān,
[6310] In the palace of Sukhāvati's stacked,
[6311] With an assembly of five thousand,
[6312] All great bodhisattvas,
[6313] Having obtained patience in the unborn Dharma,
[6314] Only those possessing virtuous mind arise.
[6315] That very teacher came,
[6316] Tamed those possessing wrong desire,
[6317] This very sacred teaching
[6318] For five thousand thousand years
[6319] Makes the essence of the teaching abide.
[6320] Then again, like the former,
[6321] Makes flourishing and decline by seven sequences.
[6322] After that, Tuṣita possessing sound,
[6323] In the vast world-realm,
[6324] Teacher Amitāyus, Destroyer-of-Saṃsāra,
[6325] Retinue of one hundred eight and a half,
[6326] All arhats with outflows exhausted,
[6327] Deed done, burden cast off.
[6328] By that also, the essence of the teaching
[6329] Abides for seven hundred-thousand years.
[6330] By the sequence of former force,
[6331] Thus, from the passing of seven abidings,
[6332] Also for eighty-five aeons,
[6333] Dharmas dissolved into Buddha-kāya,
[6334] In whatever world-realm,
[6335] The Buddha's teaching does not abide.
[6336] Then to the lower world,
[6337] For six hundred-thousand aeons,
[6338] The Buddha's teaching abides long;
[6339] In this, flourishing and decline do not arise,
[6340] Ripens beings.
[6341] Thus it is spoken.
[6342] That also, to the Buddha's teaching, actual and
[6343] From the two reflections:
[6344] Reflection is:
[6345] Pervading wherever in the six realms, from beings' aspiration and teacher's blessing.
[6346] From the three actual teachings:
[6347] The two teachings of dharmakāya and saṃbhogakāya—teacher's self-appearance, pure sphere,
[6348] The palace of dharmadhātu, and
[6349] The two dense arrays of clear light,
[6350] Existing as the permanent, continuous wheel;
[6351] The common teaching of emanation-kāya, the sequence of sūtra and tantra, and
[6352] The two uncommon, great secret, definitive supreme vehicles—
[6353] Do not exist other than the realms of gods and humans possessing particular merit,
[6354] For ḍākinīs also exist in the realms of gods and humans.
[6355] In this great secret definitive teaching, for those meeting the three actual seeds of the teaching, liberation without effort is doubtless.
[6356] From the letter of speech-emanation,
[6357] Written in harmony with the body-color of whatever teaching the Buddha came to,
[6358] Placed in a jewel casket, carried in the left armpit, reading from time to time, and
[6359] Making veneration and worship, liberation is also without effort—
[6360] Also in this life, long life,
[6361] Without disease,
[6362] All wishes accomplished,
[6363] Opportunity not found by demons and obstacles that lead astray,
[6364] Making the end of life blissful, without the suffering of severing illness at the time of death, and
[6365] For those seeing the door of introduction here, if so, seizing firm ground in the wisdom-lamp of the intermediate state, and
[6366] Even being of the vehicle holding mental analysis,
[6367] Birth in the pure field, and
[6368] Even ordinary, meeting this great secret, liberation, etc.—immeasurable qualities exist as the support for birth in the higher blissful realm.
[6369] From the Thalgyur:
[6370] Making the sun very illuminating,
[6371] The three things of body, speech, and mind—
[6372] To whoever descended, without effort,
[6373] Definitely obtains Buddhahood.
[6374] Therefore the key point of blessing:
[6375] Also from the very speech-emanation,
[6376] Written with the teaching's color,
[6377] Placed in the left armpit,
[6378] If read and held in time,
[6379] Complete awakening is certain without doubt.
[6380] Also if this tantra is constantly read,
[6381] By that also, becomes like the above.
[6382] Thus it is spoken.
[6383] From the Great Arrangement:
[6384] This, by whoever is held, is good—
[6385] All craft and art,
[6386] All treatises and sounds,
[6387] Become known as wished.
[6388] This unsurpassed supreme secret,
[6389] If worship, praise, and honor are made,
[6390] Supreme and common accomplishments
[6391] Arise as wished.
[6392] By merely carrying this,
[6393] Scripture and oral instructions are held.
[6394] The jewel-light dispelling the world's darkness,
[6395] This lamp making appear—
[6396] To whoever it appears,
[6397] Elements self-liberate;
[6398] Without doubt, becomes fortunate.
[6399] Thus it is spoken.
[6400] Third, showing the persons who hold, three:
[6401] The generally shown history of former arising,
[6402] Explaining the enumeration of obtained liberation,
[6403] Expressing the definite prophecy of vidyādhara.
[6404] First:
[6405] At the occasion of the arrangement of the field of the great Brahma teacher by primordial first king supreme Samantabhadra, having obtained clear light,
[6406] Vajradhara, and
[6407] That very teacher showing many other emanations of name-forms, arranged, and
[6408] From that blessing, having become Buddha, other arranged great Brahma aeons filling the sky's limit, numberless, expression-transcended—some empty, and
[6409] Some abiding, and
[6410] Some destroying, and
[6411] From some formed and abiding,
[6412] Up to this great Brahma arranged by Vajradhara,
[6413] Again, by the clear light aeon of the secret essence, the sequence of taming beings—sixty-four hundred-thousand, and
[6414] From that, between-between, other aeons numberless-transcended arisen,
[6415] Explained here as those arisen of clear light essence;
[6416] That also, from primordial time until arriving at this field's sequence,
[6417] First, the primordial first teaching arose,
[6418] Ripened numberless beings by the secret heart-essence.
[6419] Then, at the second teaching, the Buddha Śikhin, protector of the world,
[6420] At the third, the thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector, and
[6421] At the fourth, the thousand suns' king, and
[6422] At the fifth, the web-protector Buddha, and
[6423] At the sixth, the thousand light-rays' rim-protector, and
[6424] At the seventh, the saṃsāra-destroyer king, and
[6425] Then, in the aeons of the intervals of sixty-four hundred-thousand, holding this secret heart-essence, acting for the benefit of beings,
[6426] Until the great aeon of strife-possessing, arranged by Vajradhara of the great Brahma.
[6427] The sequence of these extensively:
[6428] Arises from the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra—
[6429] Each aeon,
[6430] Each enumeration of Buddha,
[6431] Each manner of liberation of gathered retinue, and the first:
[6432] From the primordial first Buddha,
[6433] Until the aeon of strife-possessing, actually taught sixty-six within the category of the inexpressible—
[6434] The teaching of all, the number of sixty-four hundred-thousand.
[6435] The primordial first Buddha:
[6436] "First, the superior Smṛti-protector,
[6437] Mudrā of self-remembering wheel,
[6438] The word distinguishing superior from base,
[6439] Śikhin, arisen at the previous beginning.
[6440] By seventy myriads of this time,
[6441] This mudrā is supreme."
[6442] To:
[6443] "The wisdom-protector of exhausted mindfulness,
[6444] The essence, self-word, secret understood,
[6445] To the aeon of strife-possessing,
[6446] By the nineteen lineage-holders,
[6447] The definitive mudrā supreme held."
[6448] Thus inexpressible,
[6449] From the blessings of the Buddhas,
[6450] In the self-arisen great letter,
[6451] Of the great primordially pure abiding,
[6452] From the descent, all this self-arisen arose;
[6453] All this sequence of blessing also,
[6454] Self-shown from the first descent.
[6455] Thus to:
[6456] "Inexpressible" means other aeons and the sequence of Buddhas of the interval aeons condensed.
[6457] Those also, from the Great Arrangement:
[6458] "The primordial first Buddha,
[6459] The supreme thousand maṇḍala gathered.
[6460] Then at the second teaching,
[6461] Called Śikhin, protector of the world,
[6462] By the supreme thousand, this mudrā.
[6463] At the third teaching,
[6464] The thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector,
[6465] The thousand Buddhas' very heart essence rolled.
[6466] Then at the fourth teaching,
[6467] The thousand suns' king, and
[6468] By the thousand Buddhas, dominion conquered.
[6469] At the fifth teaching,
[6470] Called Jvalamukha, protector of the world,
[6471] In the heart of the supreme thousand, concealed.
[6472] At the sixth teaching,
[6473] The thousand light-rays' rim-protector,
[6474] By the thousand families, this very concealed.
[6475] Then at the seventh teaching,
[6476] The all-pervading saṃsāra-destroyer, Brahma-protector,
[6477] By the thousand great bliss, crown held.
[6478] Thus, thus is the teaching:
[6479] To sixty-four hundred-thousand,
[6480] By that many number of Buddhas,
[6481] This great secret fully held.
[6482] The definitive Buddhas of the teaching:
[6483] By nineteen hundred-thousand,
[6484] This very mudrā, essence rolled.
[6485] Thus it is spoken.
[6486] That also, sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons,
[6487] Is the aeon of the great Brahma.
[6488] From the arrangement of sixty-four hundred-thousand great emanations of that first protector himself,
[6489] Emanating as Buddhas, nineteen hundred-thousand to the perception of disciples, acting for benefit:
[6490] The arrangement of great Brahma in the abode of king supreme Samantabhadra,
[6491] The teaching showing the deed in the sky of the abode of one Kaustubha jewel, the thirteenth within the center of lotus petals on the palm of Vairocana's hand.
[6492] And in all the abodes of that kāya,
[6493] The teaching showing the deed in fields existing in other abodes of the five families transcends thought—
[6494] The Buddha's deed,
[6495] Qualities and activities,
[6496] Called "three kāyas equal to the sky"—
[6497] Tenth-ground bodhisattvas cannot measure;
[6498] How can worldly, seeing mind measure?
[6499] From the Uttaratantra:
[6500] "Buddha-element and Buddha-awakening,
[6501] Buddha qualities and Buddha activities,
[6502] Even for pure beings, inconceivable."
[6503] Thus it is spoken.
[6504] From the Ratnaketu:
[6505] "As much as the sky is pervaded,
[6506] The kāya also pervades that much.
[6507] As much as the kāya is pervaded,
[6508] Light also pervades that much.
[6509] As much as light is pervaded,
[6510] Speech also pervades that much."
[6511] Thus it was spoken.
[6512] Second, showing the enumeration of obtained liberation:
[6513] In this Jambudvīpa, by this great secret definitive teaching,
[6514] Although hundred-thousand non-human ḍākinīs beyond number are liberated,
[6515] Here on this occasion, the definite enumeration of liberation in this life and the intermediate state by the enumeration of men, women,
[6516] Fully ordained,
[6517] Boys and girls is:
[6518] From the Great Arrangement:
[6519] "Listen, fortunate monk Pal:
[6520] I, from not abiding here,
[6521] Until sixty years of life,
[6522] One thousand results of liberation
[6523] Arising as self-release:
[6524] Monk form, half of that;
[6525] Remainder, bodhisattvas.
[6526] Then until fifty,
[6527] Arising, returning to self-place,
[6528] By two hundred-thousand, obtain birthless.
[6529] Mostly females' form,
[6530] Males, two thousand.
[6531] Then, in the interval of thirty years of life,
[6532] Six hundred-thousand,
[6533] These mostly males,
[6534] By one hundred-thousand females.
[6535] Arising, self-release.
[6536] Those, my former retinue,
[6537] In degenerate time, obtained Buddhahood.
[6538] The definite secret essence even gathered,
[6539] From obtaining the result itself,
[6540] Not the result of other teaching.
[6541] If to other teaching,
[6542] Manifest Buddhas arise,
[6543] This meets, thus it is.
[6544] In the heart of all results,
[6545] This is the definite teaching."
[6546] Thus it is spoken.
[6547] Shown is the number of self-pure arising in this life.
[6548] All who have obtained Buddhahood, wherever from, have become Buddha from the abode of this great secret,
[6549] Having seen the direct dharmatā of awareness-manifest, becoming Buddha—
[6550] For that is not surpassed by others.
[6551] That also, by the power of having gathered accumulations over many former aeons,
[6552] First meeting with this teaching,
[6553] Called the heart of the result for becoming Buddha without taking long;
[6554] All meeting with this teaching quickly obtain Buddhahood,
[6555] For they meet the heart of the result.
[6556] O fortunate master-disciple, possessor of Dharma,
[6557] In this life, or
[6558] In the bardo, or
[6559] In whichever field of natural emanation-kāya, definitely accomplish Buddhahood quickly,
[6560] For the cause, the power of definite Buddhahood-accomplishment without obstruction, meeting the pure teaching's heart of result, and by faith conducting in that.
[6561] O fortunate master-disciple, possessor of Dharma,
[6562] Formerly worshipped countless Buddhas and gathered in the retinue of Samantabhadra,
[6563] For conducting in the unsurpassed secret vehicle again.
[6564] If even merely meeting the common vehicle definitely has former merit-roots such as worshipping Buddhas,
[6565] Meeting such uncommon teaching has special former accumulations, and it pervades that well-practiced before.
[6566] Also from the Abhisamayālaṃkāra:
[6567] "Having specially served the Buddhas,
[6568] Planted merit-roots toward that,
[6569] Protected by spiritual friends,
[6570] Are vessels for hearing this."
[6571] Thus it was spoken.
[6572] The enumeration of liberation in the bardo:
[6573] Also from the former:
[6574] "Between the two births, manifestly Buddha,
[6575] In the interval of ten years of life, these:
[6576] Seven thousand meet the mother of appearances;
[6577] Males, indeed six thousand;
[6578] Female form, one thousand.
[6579] Thus males and females, boys and girls,
[6580] Whatever form they dwell in, easy—all who meet this are completely liberated."
[6581] Thus it is spoken.
[6582] That also, having entered this definite secret supreme and obtained guidance and instructions,
[6583] Although the meaning is not obtained,
[6584] Those males, females, and children, by the benefit of hearing, definitely liberate quickly,
[6585] For they meet the unsurpassed heart of the result.
[6586] Third, expressing the definite prophecy of vidyādhara:
[6587] From the Thalgyur:
[6588] "I, after parinirvāṇa,
[6589] In the land of Uḍḍiyana of the west,
[6590] To the goddess of Dhana Kośa,
[6591] The fatherless son, Vajra-He,
[6592] By this one, the supreme teaching is held.
[6593] That successor, in the western direction,
[6594] A brahmin child, fortunate,
[6595] Called Mañjuśrīpati,
[6596] Holds for seventy-five years.
[6597] That successor, fortunate,
[6598] In the place called Sośa Island,
[6599] Householder-born Śrī Siṃha,
[6600] By that one, will hold.
[6601] After that, the holder of outcaste family,
[6602] Jñānasūtra, holds this very teaching.
[6603] After that, the holder of householder family,
[6604] Holds by Mahāmudrā-holders.
[6605] After that, in the king family,
[6606] Holds together with emanation-reflection.
[6607] After that, in monastic form,
[6608] By Lhun-gyal-tshen.
[6609] After that, Siddha Śvara holds.
[6610] After that, dwelling on earth,
[6611] By bodhisattvas holds.
[6612] After that, Vajrapāṇi's
[6613] Emanation, Vajra Pha, holds.
[6614] After that, King Senge,
[6615] By Zangpo holds.
[6616] After that, Drakhar-Pa holds.
[6617] After that, by Yogi Srawa holds.
[6618] After that, King Khri-'od,
[6619] After that, monk Pal-dang-ldan,
[6620] Then by Lodrö Chok holds.
[6621] Then by ḍākinī Pal-'dzin-ma,
[6622] Having held this teaching,
[6623] Flourishes at the time of ten years of life;
[6624] Then, not abiding, to self-place."
[6625] Thus it is spoken.
[6626] Thus our holy master, monk Pal-dang-ldan,
[6627] The sequence of prophecy of emanations arising until Kumārarāja, protector of beings,
[6628] Especially, in hundreds of years,
[6629] In this Tibet, Vimalamitra's emanation, time, definitely clarifying the places of this essence—established in the great history:
