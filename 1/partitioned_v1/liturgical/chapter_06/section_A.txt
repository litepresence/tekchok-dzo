[10638] Realization-of before realization-base exist and,
[10639] Then cognition-of mind arise cause realization-to base not depend.
[10640] Base-to realization-of mind depend even.
[10641] Realization-of before exist must cause pervade.
[10642] Not realize also base be-if base being what know.
[10643] Mind know-if not realize also base being fall.
[10644] Those etcetera-of faults perceive also.
[10645] Klong-drug from,
[10646] Determined base called show-to,
[10647] This also correct essence not.
[10648] For-example eye yellow-possess those-to,
[10649] Conch-from yellow appear like.
[10650] Self-to revert-of distinction,
[10651] Self other two not determined limit free.
[10652] Therefore that also correct not.
[10653] Or cause determined effect determined cause.
[10654] Self permanent and difference not become.
[10655] This also knowable not.
[10656] Said that also previous and same.
[10657] Thus.
[10658] Fourth also accept express.
[10659] Essence direction and kind-to not divide and,
[10660] Appearance whatever change able.
[10661] Second that refutation.
[10662] Base change able-if pure Buddha impure confusion become.
[10663] Who-by-means-of also effort without sentient beings Buddha-as change cause liberate follow.
[10664] Also effect cause revert follow.
[10665] Change-of base being cause.
[10666] Earth etcetera matter also awareness become and.
[10667] Awareness also matter become follow.
[10668] Also essence kind-to not divided that change or,
[10669] Other change.
[10670] Essence change-if essence base-as not possible.
[10671] Base-from other-of dharma-as change cause.
[10672] Other change-if essence anywhere change commit damage.
[10673] Also permanent change or,
[10674] Impermanent change.
[10675] Permanent change not possible sky like.
[10676] Impermanent change not necessary change already cause.
[10677] Also three-times-of reason past future change possible not being non-existent be and.
[10678] Present early arise ceased.
[10679] Later part not born cause non-existent cause.
[10680] Change possible not perceive cause base whatever change able that not valid.
[10681] That itself from,
[10682] Change able called before said cause.
[10683] Own state change able-if,
[10684] This also determined not same.
[10685] Effect itself cause revert cause.
[10686] Effort those-for need not cause.
[10687] Again and again revert cause.
[10688] Matter those awareness who,
[10689] Become able not like.
[10690] This also knowable not.
[10691] Said that also that-like.
[10692] Thus.
[10693] Fifth also accept express.
[10694] Awareness-of essence-to direction not everywhere arise cause whatever accept.
[10695] Second that refutation.
[10696] Whatever accept that,
[10697] Base that-from dwell accept or.
[10698] Not dwell accept.
[10699] First like-if permanent existent impermanent existent two together establish follow.
[10700] Impermanent appear only-as dwell cause.
[10701] Impermanent establish also permanent existent not establish say-if,
[10702] Whatever accept able damage.
[10703] Like-that samsara effort without liberate and.
[10704] Liberation those revert follow.
[10705] Whatever accept cause.
[10706] Second like-if rabbit-horn and barren-woman-of son samsara-nirvana make also accept etcetera limit not fault perceive.
[10707] That from,
[10708] Accept those possess.
[10709] Teacher itself before said.
[10710] This all direction-of projection only.
[10711] All being establish cause.
[10712] Limit not fault become cause.
[10713] This also knowable not.
[10714] Teacher said before and same.
[10715] Thus.
[10716] Sixth also accept express.
[10717] Essence everywhere arise cause appearance variegated variety arise accept.
[10718] Second that refutation.
[10719] Variety that outer-appearance-to accept or.
[10720] Inner-consciousness-to accept or.
[10721] Those two gather-to accept.
[10722] First like-if,
[10723] Appearance variety like base one-only that also variety-as outer arise-of fault exist and.
[10724] Second according-to consciousness momentary-like basis momentary consequence and.
[10725] Consciousness thinking realization many-like basis also-that-to consequence and.
[10726] Consciousness affliction condition powerful-like basis also-that-to consequence.
[10727] Third according-to basis external-internal-to consequence and.
[10728] Basis grasped-grasper-to consequence and.
[10729] Basis six-collections abandon object one-sided-to consequence.
[10730] Again basis expanse as-one not-tenable.
[10731] Many assembled is's because.
[10732] These etcetera faults.
[10733] Six-Expanses from,
[10734] Teacher above scattered spoke.
[10735] This also side not-tenable-by,
[10736] Whose essence that appearance.
[10737] Result different meaning that similar.
[10738] Many sound-by deterioration's because.
[10739] This also object-of-knowledge is-not.
[10740] Spoke that also that-like.
[10741] Thus.
[10742] Seventh-at-also claim expressed is.
[10743] Awareness self-arisen's primordial-wisdom existence-non-existence's extreme from free-by primordial-wisdom merely established not.
[10744] Elaboration-free great-bindu's aspect-from anywhere not-established intend.
[10745] Second that refutation is.
[10746] Thus anything not-established primordial-wisdom merely-not existence-from pure-by anywhere place-to-put natural-state anything not-exist if samsara-nirvana arise expanse-to contradiction.
[10747] Primordial-wisdom not-exist if Buddha and sentient-beings's liberation not-exist-by basis realize-from liberate also not-logical.
[10748] Subtle five-lights not-exist if basis-appearance arise cause not-exist-by that state-from basis-appearance not-logical's because.
[10749] Not-realized delusion's mind not-logical.
[10750] Six-Expanses from,
[10751] Essence at primordially-pure-by,
[10752] Sentient-beings samsara this not-logical.
[10753] Non-awareness stain primordially-exhausted's because.
[10754] Thus earlier six-bases similar.
[10755] Third primordially-pure spontaneous-accomplishment non-dual's basis own-system posit at actual-meaning and.
[10756] That-at dispute abandon two from.
[10757] First is essence primordially-pure at spontaneous-accomplishment depth clear exist-by non-dual portion's essence primordially-pure's awareness thing characteristic not-established.
[10758] Nature spontaneous-accomplishment-of clarity subtle inner-clarity-as dwell.
[10759] Appearance-of essence empty-to empty-of nature dwell clear essence awareness being form and primordial-wisdom primordially gather-separate not sun-of essence like dwell.
[10760] Essence primordially pure and nature spontaneous accomplish difference not accept.
[10761] Rangshar from,
[10762] Base-to aspect two-as said.
[10763] Primordially-pure great-of base and.
[10764] Spontaneous-accomplishment variety base-as accept.
[10765] Called and.
[10766] Klong-drug-pa from,
[10767] Essence itself-to primordially-pure cause.
[10768] Nature-as spontaneous-accomplishment.
[10769] Called and.
[10770] Mu-tig-phreng-ba from,
[10771] Essence primordially-pure expression base free.
[10772] Nature spontaneous-accomplishment whatever appear complete.
[10773] Thus.
[10774] Second that-to dispute abandon number and own-face two from.
[10775] First-to dispute-answer two from.
[10776] Dispute.
[10777] Base eight-as follows called answer primordially-pure and spontaneous-accomplishment difference not accept that base seven gather cause that-from reversal not accept cause.
[10778] Base eight-as follows-of fault not.
[10779] Also own-face primordially pure thus said and not contradict.
[10780] Essence primordially-pure-as accept cause relation is.
[10781] Second own-face primordially-pure and spontaneous-accomplishment difference not dispute and answer two from.
[10782] First dispute establish.
[10783] Primordially-pure and spontaneous-accomplishment each fault exist cause own essence primordially-pure be-if samsara exist not experienced cause sentient beings confusion arise not reasonable follow and.
[10784] Nature spontaneous-accomplishment being cause who effort without primordially liberate follow and.
[10785] Primordially-pure and spontaneous-accomplishment base one-to substance contradiction follow.
[10786] Answer essence primordially pure cause sentient beings samsara not exist even.
[10787] Spontaneous-accomplishment-of power path play only-from that-like appear not contradict.
[10788] Sleep-to go time and sleep time-of consciousness-of own-face-to dream not exist even.
[10789] Appearance-to horse ox-as appear not contradict like.
[10790] Also sentient beings-as appear also illusion-of play only-from meaning-of essence-to not established cause primordially liberate finished and.
[10791] Conventional appearance power-to eye mantra-of power horse ox-as appear liberation-to,
[10792] Effort without own-place place cause nature own dwell and child ball-like revert.
[10793] Space-to liberate appear time-from revert appear revert only-from,
[10794] Liberate liberation new-arise anything not bondage not established cause.
[10795] Also appearance conventional-of part-from spontaneous-accomplishment-to,
[10796] Empty ultimate-of part-from primordially-pure word express only-from.
[10797] Those two substance separate not cause separately not change.
[10798] Essence one-to revert different separate ze being not be and.
[10799] Vow-possessor being cause fully-ordained being cause two not contradict like.
[10800] Those-of dispute-answer also.
[10801] Klong-drug-pa from,
[10802] Essence itself-to primordially-pure cause.
[10803] Sentient beings samsara this not reasonable.
[10804] Non-recognition impurity primordially exhausted cause.
[10805] Teacher said bodhisattva great.
[10806] Nature spontaneous accomplish cause.
[10807] That also not-cease play-as appear.
[10808] Bodhisattva itself-by-means-of also asked.
[10809] Nature itself-to spontaneous-accomplishment-if,
[10810] Sentient beings these self-liberate reasonable.
[10811] Primordially spontaneous accomplish cause.
[10812] Said sentient beings these.
[10813] Essence primordially pure cause.
[10814] Liberation those also play-as appear.
[10815] Bodhisattva also asked.
[10816] Essence itself primordially-pure cause.
[10817] Spontaneous-accomplishment-to also need not become.
[10818] Or spontaneous accomplish cause.
[10819] Primordially pure not become.
[10820] Teacher said exist way-to,
[10821] What-by-means-of express word not cause.
[10822] Express sound word and free cause.
[10823] What-of essence establish not cause.
[10824] Word this-to harm free.
[10825] Sentient beings self-grasp mind object-from,
[10826] Variety recollection thought not cease cause.
[10827] Word harm essence distinction not.
[10828] Ultimate conventional term cause.
[10829] Thus.
[10830] Meaning second unsurpassed base particular explain-to three.
[10831] Common brief show.
[10832] Respective parts from elaborately explained.
[10833] Meaning gathering is.
[10834] First is,
[10835] Beginning base essence primordially pure like conch shell pure unmixed stains like-wise thing and mark not-established nature spontaneous-presence white inside subtle self-light depth-clear exist although condition not-existing therefore outside not-appear because.

[10922] This-like one certain not-exist,
[10923] Various appear base called.
[10924] Thus.
[10925] That also essence primordially-pure reverse-from examine if what-also not-established outside clear part light and body color etc marked not-established although.
[10926] That nature spontaneous-presence expanse from primordial-resonance light five body and ray and sphere appear most subtle identity.
[10927] Expanse inside swirl inside clear subtle wisdom exist.
[10928] That also primordially-pure isolate side-as split if,
[10929] Body and wisdom arise part what is.
[10930] Base at primordially-pure what-also not-exist is.
[10931] That expanse from arise think if,
[10932] Exist or not-exist.
[10933] Not-exist if arise suitable-not.
[10934] Thing-not-exist from thing arise suitable-not like.
[10935] Exist if what-also not-exist desire conflict.
[10936] That primordially-pure nature spontaneous-presence is and,
[10937] That expanse inside clear subtle wisdom primordial-resonance light-clear appearance subtle exist.
[10939] Inside clear subtle desire break end from liberate.
[10940] Thus limit-free self-arisen wisdom essence empty where-also not-established.
[10941] Nature clear appear manner not-cease.
[10942] Compassion understanding not-cease what-like-also arise base do is.
[10943] Base thing essence actual-state is.
[10944] Two respective parts from elaborate explain at two are.
