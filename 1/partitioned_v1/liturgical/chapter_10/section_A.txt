[17714] Pearl garland from
[17715] Conceptions all burned through of
[17716] Jnana itself fire like consume
[17717] Space itself and equal
[17718] Empty-luminous Awareness-possess itself
[17719] Thus
[17720] Here not-know some
[17721] Mind not-possess if inanimate or darkness like become thus also learning small
[17722] Mind not-possess though jnana exist through of Awareness cease not through of reason
[17723] That-also non-Awareness delusion mind cease through of
[17724] Jnana clear sun arise
[17725] Night dawn through of day rise like
[17726] Some is
[17727] Non-Awareness Awareness pervader is through of
[17728] Mind cease time Awareness cease think also very mistake great
[17729] Awareness through of non-Awareness outward pervade though
[17730] Non-Awareness inward not-pervade Buddha jnana like
[17731] Mind on non-Awareness through of pervade through of
[17732] Mind pervader as suitable
[17733] Awareness on not-pervade through of
[17734] Non-Awareness Awareness expanse from cease or continuum break think
[17735] Therefore mind cease time basis non-Awareness part possessing cease though
[17736] Awareness unceasing cease basis Awareness is through of reason
[17737] Awareness-also not-possess if what top on cease think suitable
[17738] Here non-Awareness mind part possessing cease through of Awareness jnana expand and two-knowledges on enjoy
[17739] Pearl garland from
[17740] Mind is movement all separate through of
[17741] Inanimate like not
[17742] Know and Awareness on clear do appear
[17743] Thus spoken
[17744] There mind and jnana each-other
[17745] Common body from also
[17746] Mind and mind-itself nature through of pure two distinguish
[17747] That on mind is all-conception samsara Dharma
[17748] Mind-itself is elaboration and free nirvana Dharma
[17749] Arya prajnaparamita eight-thousand from also
[17750] Mind on mind nonexistent
[17751] Mind nature luminosity is thus spoken
[17752] Mind on thus is basis gather essence nature show through of
[17753] Mind elaboration-possess thought defilement through of Dharma emanate gather and one-pointed higher-realms enter like indeed nature nonexistent
[17754] Sems-by-means-of nature
[17755] Sems-by-means-of natural-state
[17756] Mind itself called name through of enumeration that itself through of character luminous pristine awareness as abide thus arise
[17757] Mind and mind-itself distinguish as not-know through of fool through of also pitaka know as arrogant indeed display arrogance-possess as only
[17758] Thus mind and pristine awareness well separate from common object-possess through of vehicle to mind to ground path fruit as do although
[17759] That all meaning directly not-arrive through of
[17760] Vehicle this to pristine awareness to Buddha through of ground path fruit as enumerate through of
[17761] Quickly samsara from liberate
[17762] Other samsara through of root to enlightenment hope through of long even that obtain difficult
[17763] Ground open-manner err purpose
[17764] Kuntu-zangpo heart through of mirror from
[17765] Mind from Buddha desire from I from err indeed
[17766] Thus say
[17767] Err manner indeed
[17768] Reason and scripture two through of contradict indeed
[17769] Thus mind from Buddha and path and
[17770] Ground three open if
[17771] Open-ground mind that itself grasp-grasp and possess through of purpose you through of ground path fruit all grasp-grasp and possess as result
[17772] Desire from Buddha not-accomplish and accomplish although reverse result
[17773] Grasp-grasp from not-liberated through of purpose
[17774] Also mind habit and karma various gather like
[17775] Ground path fruit also that to result
[17776] Desire if delusion as result through of flaw exist indeed
[17777] Opponent through of this thus
[17778] Mind nonexistent if that through of also Buddha not-reason
[17779] Buddha that bya-mind through of distinction through of done as you also desire through of purpose
[17780] Answer say
[17781] Mind nonexistent and exist through of Buddha become not-thing
[17782] Chos-kaya through of pristine awareness exist nonexistent through of thus arise
[17783] Mind through of delusion wake through of Buddha distinction through of done true although still ground spontaneous-presence through of Buddha through of not-certain through of true actual also not-thing

[17800] That on return this like
[17801] Mind genitive entity how-much exist
[17802] Asked answer extensively given
[17803] Mind on entity not-have through of
[17804] Then mind genitive characteristic what
[17805] Asked answer extensively give
[17806] Mind on entity not-have through of

[17811] Mind on grasping-holder exist or nonexistent
[17812] Asked answer extensively give
[17813] Mind on grasping and holding exist although
[17814] Dharma-nature grasping-holder not-have through of
[17815] That on return also spoke
[17816] Who genitive assertion fall will-become
[17817] Mind and Dharma-nature one through of
[17818] Mind on grasping-holder arise if
[17819] Buddha effort through of find not will-become
[17820] Mind on grasping-holder exist through of
[17821] Asked answer reverse say
[17822] If mind nonexistent Buddha-ness
[17823] Your find or what through of
[17824] That on asked answer extensively given
[17825] Mind on result not-seek
[17826] Mind from various arise through of
[17827] Sentient being latencies gather
[17828] Grasping object on move through of
[17829] Mind is samsara root
[17830] Mind is to-be-abandoned stage
[17831] What through of mind as exist through of
[17832] Mind is confusion root
[17833] All that from separate
[17834] Similar-basis from miss through of
[17835] Mind is defiled as demonstrated
[17836] What through of thought exist through of
[17837] Mind is action feather like
[17838] What through of mind not-have through of
[17839] Then reverse word spoke
[17840] Then how mind itself desire
[17841] Then kindness answer extensively granted
[17842] Mind on result without desire
[17843] Rigpa Wisdom exist through of
[17844] Then rigpa this itself on
[17845] Characteristic form how-many and possess
[17846] Then asked answer this like do
[17847] Rigpa Wisdom characteristic
[17848] Empty and clear and pervade
[17849] Says
[17784] Rigpa on basis-do path-do fruit-do if
[17851] Awareness that itself thing mark become not question say
[17852] Not-become
[17853] Empty and clear and grasp-attachment any also not-possess reason
[17854] Again that same from
[17855] Know Awareness clear itself exist
[17856] Why clear exist become if
[17857] Mark-possess become not
[17858] Why clear through of beautiful reason
[17859] That on ask-answer this like do
[17860] Mark-possess become not
[17861] That on attachment not-possess reason
[17862] That also this like know should
[17863] Example sun mandala like
[17864] Clear though direction into not-fall
[17865] Why desire not-possess reason
[17866] Thus
[17867] Second each own-nature extensively-explain on two
[17868] Mind and jnana own-nature extensively-explain
[17869] First is
[17870] Consequence from
[17871] Mind and jnana essential-point
[17872] Mind thus called delusion-conception on
[17873] Essence enter and pervade
[17874] Recollection-thought various through of basis not
[17875] Distinction pure and impure
[17876] Definition thought through of recollection-object produce
[17877] What on mind and what through of mind
[17878] What mind and what reason mind
[17879] Thus spoken through of
[17880] This on essence
[17881] Definition
[17882] Distinction
[17883] Each meaning and four from
[17884] First essence
[17885] Object subject grasper-holder arise knowledge what non-Awareness pervader exist
[17886] Definition is
[17887] Grasper-holder arise through of object and subject mind through of mind thus called
[17888] Above two mind also samadhi one-pointed on attach grasper-holder
[17889] Desire in all-conception coarse
[17890] Distinction if
[17891] Pure and impure two
[17892] Pure on mind-itself pure and
[17893] Mind pure two from
[17894] Mind-itself pure
[17895] Mind mental-factors and thing mark grasp through of empty Dharma-nature thusness self-Awareness
[17896] Rahu grasp object on praise from
[17897] Speak-think express-void prajnaparamita
[17898] Not-arise unceasing space essence
[17899] Self jnana object-field
[17900] Three-times Buddha mother to homage
[17901] Thus arise like
[17902] Mind pure
[17903] Path time mind conception through of uncorrupted liberation cause suitable samadhi arise and
[17904] Realization-possess compassion mind-generate etc liberation cause suitable
[17905] Precious-garland from
[17906] Emptiness compassion essence-possess
[17907] Enlightenment accomplish some on
[17908] Thus and
[17909] Not-attachment not-hatred delusion nonexistent
[17910] That produce karma virtuous
[17911] Thus like
[17912] These all also self-arisen ultimate meaning general grasp through of directly object impossible through of
[17913] Samsara aspect belonging mind gather
[17914] Uttaratantra from
[17915] Self-arisen ultimate that
[17916] Faith itself realization object on
[17917] Sun mandala clear-light though
[17918] Eye not-possess through of see nonexistent
[17919] Thus spoken like
[17920] Impure mind distinction if two
[17921] Briefly-shown and
[17922] Extensively-explained
[17923] First is expanse on impure nonexistent though
[17924] That from move time basis-appearance from cut impossible what also arise
[17925] Non-Awareness play from mind
[17926] Mind ornament from intellect
[17927] Intellect from affliction arise
[17928] That also play is capacity or power or ray like that from arise tone just
[17929] Seed from sprout and
[17930] Face form from that reflection mirror in arise like
[17931] Ornament is that from ripen arise grain portion just seed flower and mark like
[17932] That like also self-arisen from
[17933] Completely pure primordial-pure appearance on non-Awareness nonexistent
[17934] Mind not-exist
[17935] Intellect nonexistent though
[17936] Spontaneous-accomplishment power from
[17937] Non-awareness arise
[17938] Non-Awareness play from mind arise
[17939] Mind ornament from intellect arise
[17940] Intellect object from five-poisons arise
[17941] Five-poisons from afflictions sixteen arise
[17942] Sixteen from twenty-five arise
[17943] That from fifty-one arise
[17944] That from thousand eight ten four arise thus
[17945] Second extensively-explained on three
[17946] Root ignorance genitive division
[17947] That from arisen mind genitive division
[17948] That from arisen affliction genitive division extensively explained
[17949] First is again that itself from
[17950] Ignorance this like
[17951] Root mind genitive ignorance and
[17952] Confusion object genitive ignorance and
[17953] Confusion-basis basis genitive ignorance and
[17954] Grasping thought genitive ignorance and
[17955] Artificial path genitive ignorance and
[17956] Not-knowing delusion genitive ignorance and
[17957] Thus ignorance form six as arisen and self genitive appear not-see go says
[17958] That also sequence like
[17959] First rigpa self face not-know through of self on other as confused delusion and
[17960] Appear object genitive essence nature not-have as not-know genitive delusion and
[17961] Condition from confusion scarecrow man as confused like delusion and
[17962] Rigpa essence on self not-have although form on self as delusion self genitive house says like delusion and
[17963] Path like artificial and
[17964] Antidote poison as become and free not give genitive delusion and
[17965] Nature through of light-clear genitive meaning not-know through of always samsara in delusion
[17966] Second that from arisen genitive mind genitive division
[17967] Self-shine from
[17968] Mind genitive division this like
[17969] Mind genitive division this like
[17970] Various gather water-like mind and
[17971] Clean-unclean not-have pig-like mind and
[17972] Brave timid great tiger-like mind and
[17973] Light feather-like mind and
[17974] Move wind-like mind and
[17975] Greatly intoxicated mud-puddle-like mind and
[17976] Spread fire-spark-like mind and
[17977] Desire bird-like mind and
[17978] Expand branch-like mind and
[17979] Stop difficult garuda-like mind and
[17980] Planet-tether not-have madman-like mind and eleven are says
[17981] Those also sequence like object and latencies various gathered through of water and
[17982] Accept-reject on deluded through of pig and
[17983] Anger and pride coarse through of tiger and
[17984] Object many on enter from focus one on not-decide superimposition and
[17985] Move on obstacle nonexistent wind and
[17986] Object desire through of intoxicate mire and
[17987] One from many conceptions spread fire and
[17988] Object accept desire bird and
[17989] Knowledge power expand through of meaning examine branch and
[17990] Object through of Awareness grasp that power into gone actor and
[17991] Not-diverge object knowledge direction not-give waver mad like mind
[17992] These all also object and condition through of virtuous non-virtuous unspecified mind three gather
[17993] Mind from intellect arise
[17994] All search intellect etc six
[17995] Third that from arise affliction distinction on three
[17996] Six root afflictions
[17997] Sixteen proximate afflictions
[17998] Subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions
[17999] First is sun-moon union from
[18000] Afflictions is six
[18001] Non-Awareness thus called basis delusion-conception part grasp
[18002] Delusion is Wisdom part from delusion
[18003] Anger is produce sequence from delusion
[18004] Pride is view part from delusion
[18005] Desire is appearance part from delusion
[18006] Jealousy is nonrealized part from delusion thus
[18007] That-also sequence like object subject delusion-conception part delusion and
[18008] Wisdom Awareness from reverse just not-know and
[18009] Object on hate part-possess and
[18010] I-am pride and
[18011] Object desire and
[18012] Meaning nonrealized through of other on anger
[18013] Second sixteen proximate afflictions
[18014] Self-arisen from
[18015] Sixteen what say
[18016] Non-awareness and
[18017] Mind and
[18018] Intellect and
[18019] Grasp and
[18020] Conception and
[18021] Not-know and
[18022] Not-see and
[18023] Not-realize and
[18024] Not-understand and
[18025] Self that impure and
[18026] I as grasp and
[18027] Other on jealousy do and
[18028] Desire and
[18029] Attachment and
[18030] Pride and
[18031] Spread and sixteen thus
[18032] These all also sequence like
[18033] That alone not-know delusion through of all affliction make and
[18034] Object on mind grasp and
[18035] Subject on grasp intellect and
[18036] Both on self as grasp and
[18037] All conception and
[18038] Meaning non-Awareness and
[18039] Nature aim not-see and
[18040] Word meaning nonrealized and
[18041] General-specific not-understand and
[18042] Delusion know after promise meaning before wrong form and
[18043] Object I as grasp and
[18044] Other excellence on not-happy and
[18045] Object take and
[18046] Object on special desire and
[18047] Slightly puff pride and
[18048] Object on spread anger
[18049] Third subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions on three
[18050] Twenty-five
[18051] Fifty-one
[18052] Thousand eight ten four
[18053] First is root non-Awareness pervader exist through of separately not-counted
[18054] Pervaded five-poisons on five distinguish through of twenty-five
[18055] Self-arisen from
[18056] Delusion on five
[18057] Very-dull delusion and
[18058] Not-know delusion and
[18059] Not-see delusion and
[18060] Very-dark delusion and
[18061] Very-intoxicate delusion and five
[18062] Desire also five
[18063] Face desire and
[18064] Very-torment desire and
[18065] Life not-care desire and
[18066] Anger possessing desire and
[18067] Space move desire and five
[18068] Anger also five
[18069] Desire much anger and
[18070] Rage possessing anger and
[18071] Very-coarse anger and
[18072] Delusion possessing anger and
[18073] Time thunder-rain like anger five
[18074] Pride also five
[18075] Suppress lion like pride and
[18076] Above nonexistent space like pride and
[18077] Brave brave great tiger like pride and
[18078] I-am think vulture like pride and
[18079] Unequal equal elephant like pride and five
[18080] Jealousy also five
[18081] Subtle jealousy and
[18082] I from arise jealousy and
[18083] Very-harsh jealousy and
[18084] Coarse jealousy and
[18085] View jealousy and five
[18086] That is afflictions twenty-five thus
[18087] Second fifty-one is that like twenty-five on object grasp afflictions twenty-five
[18088] Subject grasp afflictions twenty-five fifty
[18089] Root non-Awareness and root one arise
[18090] Third thousand eight ten four
[18091] Desire from become twenty-one thousand
[18092] Anger from become twenty-one thousand
[18093] Delusion from become twenty-one thousand
[18094] Part equal from become twenty-one thousand
[18095] Sum thousand eight and four
[18096] Afflictions eighty-four thousand also clear limitless distinguish if measure nonexistent mind not-comprehend
[18097] That-also arise from
[18098] That from mind not-comprehend speech not-utter
[18099] Count impossible arise thus
[18100] These all also mind and
[18101] Intellect and
[18102] Recollection and
[18103] Latency and
[18104] Doubt through of produce and all from arise and affliction influence through of imprint through of samsara affliction do action-possess
[18105] Sun-moon union from
[18106] These etc afflictions is thought all follow hold mind and
[18107] Recollection all follow hold intellect and
[18108] Interval connect latency and
[18109] Doubt all basis become conception and
[18110] Object and thing grasp part etc measure nonexistent thus
[18111] That like karma and afflictions all three-realm mind mental-factors on depend through of
[18112] That also consciousness group eight
[18113] Basis-all consciousness object not-think appear cause become consciousness conception-nonexistent clear and
[18114] That from spread door five knowledge from
[18115] Eye consciousness form grasp conception-nonexistent
[18116] Ear consciousness sound grasp conception-nonexistent
[18117] Nose consciousness smell grasp conception-nonexistent
[18118] Tongue consciousness taste grasp realize-nonexistent
[18119] Body consciousness touch grasp conception-nonexistent
[18120] That from grasp-holder intellect-consciousness two
[18121] Object first general grasp intellect-consciousness and
[18122] After particular grasp affliction-intellect
[18123] Grasped and grasper
[18124] Intellect-consciousness this two on
[18125] Virtuous non-virtuous unspecified three exist and
[18126] Conception-possess conception-nonexistent each suitable exist
[18127] Door five and basis-all consciousness conception-nonexistent
[18128] Thus three-realm mind and mental-factors fifty-one all abandon object superimposition only
[18129] Two-truths from
[18130] Mind and mental-factors three-realm
[18131] Superimposition form-possess conception
[18132] Thus
[18133] These abandon object
[18134] Non-Awareness nature is reason
[18135] Here mind path make Buddha desire great-text madhyamaka etc tradition through of also
[18136] Mind and mind-itself two distinguish through of mind group eight or seven or six nature abandon object gather through of
[18137] Mind-itself nature through of pure accept object realize through of path cultivate on enter do
[18138] This also that and part similar
[18139] Awareness and Awareness from arise mind-itself and
[18140] Self characteristic grasp mind thus explain
[18141] Six-expanse from
[18142] Hey mind-hero great
[18143] Awareness and Awareness from arise mind-itself is stain and conception all from beyond
[18144] Brief nirvana cause and fruit all
[18145] Awareness self-appearance see beings object-field
[18146] Self characteristic grasp mind is thus superimpose appearance all and
[18147] Exist appearance and
[18148] Nonexistent appearance all and
[18149] Appearance and
[18150] Renown and
[18151] View and

[18154] Grasp and
[18155] Conception and
[18156] Afflictions
[18157] Thought object appear all
[18158] Brief samsara Dharma all is self characteristic grasp mind
[18159] Beings six-classes self-same appearance all thus spoken
[18160] Then this two same question
[18161] Difference great
[18162] Common vehicle view-meditation-conduct what do also mind from transcend impossible and
[18163] Here mind unmixed Awareness direct through of more-superior etc many
[18164] Fourth each meaning on mind basis and
[18165] Abode and
[18166] Path and
[18167] Door and
[18168] Essence and
[18169] Power and
[18170] Action and
[18171] Fruit eight from
[18172] Basis is form aggregate upper-torso chest
[18173] Abode is heart from lung connect interval in navel aorta tube just from wind horse on Awareness tone ride abide
[18174] Wind is horse blind leg-possess like
[18175] Awareness tone is not-spread person eye-possess like
[18176] That two one together not-mix if not-move nine-move conception not-arise
[18177] Tone Awareness self as abide through of
[18178] Object appear also that on not-think knowledge clear-dawn half arise through of
[18179] Wind essential-point through of
[18180] Wind and Awareness distinguish continuum mark that
[18181] That two mix through of conception not-clear nine-clear arise
[18182] Move part wind
[18183] Awareness part Awareness tone
[18184] That-also heart inside Awareness thing water like
[18185] That from power tone navel channel enter through of wind mix mind that water bubble like
[18186] Mind that Awareness channel-path tone
[18187] That-also mind is Awareness exist nonexistent follow do
[18188] Awareness is mind exist nonexistent follow go-return not-do through of
[18189] Essence on mind power in Awareness not-become and
[18190] Power is Awareness power in mind become
[18191] Awareness move if mind conception impossible
[18192] Water not-move if wave arise impossible like
[18193] Self-arisen from
[18194] Mind and Awareness example is water and bubble manner
[18195] Mind power in not-become thus
[18196] Path is life-channel from move
[18197] That from mind horse life-wind move reason
[18198] Door is
[18199] Mouth nose two wind that from exit door is reason
[18200] Essence is samsara nature grasp-holder
[18201] Power is object on grasp and I self cling
[18202] Action is samsara pleasure-pain various do
[18203] Fruit is samsara and lower-realm end nonexistent
[18204] That word also self-arisen from
[18205] Impure nature
[18206] Beings all self-continuum on
