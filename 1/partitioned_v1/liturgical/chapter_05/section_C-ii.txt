[9990] First outer's outer falsehood abandoning is.
[9991] Wheel's stacked one's tantra from,
[9992] Mantra's inclination conduct,
[9993] Migrate world common ones to also.
[9994] False one's word self-desire,
[9995] Speak to always joy having.
[9996] Mantra recite power not-arise and,
[9997] Other to spoke also holy not.
[9998] Self's speech self degenerate,
[9999] Migrate world other's tongue-drip become.
[10000] Future time in gadfly's body,
[10001] Northern direction in experience become.
[10002] That below bad-migrate suffering also,
[10003] Aspects various experience become.
[10004] Thus.
[10005] Speech's outer's inner's samaya as slander not-speak is.
[10006] Again that same from,
[10007] Mantra in entered one's person whoever.
[10008] Other two divide-enter slander speaks.
[10009] Dharma spoke circles not-gather and,
[10010] What done wrong become and,
[10011] Not-practiced also enemy become and,
[10012] Body to weapon strike and,
[10013] Died after clawed body,
[10014] Then bad-migrate sequence experience.
[10015] Thus.
[10016] Outer's secret other's harsh-words abandoning is.
[10017] Again that same from,
[10018] Always harsh-words word speaks.
[10019] Former's karma and later's sign,
[10020] Migrate world love-lacking friend also hate.
[10021] Dharma's word also seek become.
[10022] Died after very pride's body,
[10023] Then bad-migrate three in circle.
[10024] Thus.
[10025] Speech's inner's three is.
[10026] Dharma speak outer.
[10027] Accomplish inner.
[10028] Meditate speech is.
[10029] Samaya aspects arranged one's tantra from,
[10030] Mantra one discipline in dwell,
[10031] Dharma speak ones and dharma accomplish and,
[10032] Dharma instructed one's person to,
[10033] Grieve and blame bestow and,
[10034] Scold and disparage's word speak if,
[10035] Other's inclination degenerate and,
[10036] Self's possession degenerate and,
[10037] Self's dharmas forget confusion.
[10038] Mind-thought different uneven become.
[10039] Thus.
[10040] Secret's three is.
[10041] Outer vajra's siblings to disparage.
[10042] Inner guru's mudra and near-circle.
[10043] Secret guru disparage is.
[10044] Mudra two joined one's tantra from,
[10045] Vajra brother and sister to,
[10046] Word spoke and speech cut if,
[10047] Aeon hundred into million in,
[10048] Bad-migrate suffering unbearable indeed,
[10049] Person this by experience and.
[10050] Former not-done and present's sign,
[10051] Sequence experience become is.
[10052] Former done one's life this in,
[10053] Middle from last experience to,
[10054] Again former life's earlier at,
[10055] This in done one's karma end is.
[10056] Life's measure speech's karma,
[10057] Circle and other's tongue-drip and,
[10058] Sudden speech in speak stream stop.
[10059] Guru's son and wife and,
[10060] What near-dwell ones also suffice.
[10061] Command from exceed and samaya exceed if,
[10062] Former karma from two-times become,
[10063] Or guru's distinction,
[10064] Root and branch,
[10065] Speech exceed speech in spoke and.
[10066] Exaggerate-blame desire-word speak done if,
[10067] Former karma from thousand-times become,
[10068] Aspect ripen unbearable,
[10069] Sequence guru's distinction also,
[10070] Immediately experience become.
[10071] Thus.
[10072] Arrangement great from also,
[10073] Guru and near's circle,
[10074] Vajra's sibling and sister to,
[10075] Bad-spoke word trace little also,
[10076] Sign or actuality speak not-do.
[10077] If dream in also,
[10078] Arise if mind confess do.
[10079] Actual and harsh done and,
[10080] If mindfulness not-seized,
[10081] Overturned become although not-confess if,
[10082] Downward looked hell in go.
[10083] Thus.
[10084] Thus speech's samaya in divided by nine.
[10085] Third mind's samaya outer inner secret three from,
[10086] First outer's outer harm-mind abandoning is.
[10087] Essence's meaning aspect take one's tantra from,
[10088] Whoever mantra one vajra holder,
[10089] Being other or self also suffice.
[10090] Harm do one's mind hold if,
[10091] This leprosy having's body,
[10092] Cold touch having one's,
[10093] Body thousand-times five taken after,
[10094] Cold hell in certain become.
[10095] Supremely mantra in entered to,
[10096] Harm do one's mind done if,
[10097] Above's suffering experience become.
[10098] Thus.
[10099] Outer's inner guru and brother-sister to harm-mind abandoning is.
[10100] Sky-iron fire blazing one's tantra from,
[10101] If being common to,
[10102] Object become harm's mind arise if,
[10103] Migrate world common body having,
[10104] Hundred three of life cut,
[10105] This one's sin's share equal,
[10106] If teaching's sign hold one's,
[10107] Form ones to wrong become,
[10108] Mantra in entered hundred-times become.
[10109] Vajra's sibling seven-times,
[10110] Lineage's guru hundred-times,
[10111] Root's guru that one's hundred.
[10112] Mantra's door entered empowerment obtained,
[10113] Supremely aspect-ripen thus.
[10114] Thus.
[10115] Outer's secret self-other's established-view to wrong-view arise abandoning is.
[10116] Arrangement great from,
[10117] Self or other's hidden one's,
[10118] Dharma to disparage wrong one's path,
[10119] Root's samaya from exceed after,
[10120] Earth-dwell fire's suffering to,
[10121] Long time for dwell one's,
[10122] Self's established-view wrong-view arise,
[10123] Hell itself from liberate chance not.
[10124] Thus.
[10125] Mind's inner's outer conduct and
[10126] Inner meditate and
[10127] Secret view wrong abandoning is.
[10128] Crystal's house stacked one's tantra from,
[10129] View and meditate and conduct wrong,
[10130] This path wrong great is.
[10131] Being all's suffering whatever,
[10132] This one's mind in ripen certain.
[10133] Thus.
[10134] Secret's three's outer view meditate conduct,
[10135] Inner yi-dam's deity,
[10136] Secret guru and brother-sister day-night in mind in done is.
[10137] Lotus klong one's tantra from,
[10138] Who mind's karma wander and,
[10139] Mind in do one's dharmas to,
[10140] Mind in not-done degenerate and,
[10141] Past and ceased one's karma's end,
[10142] Uninterrupted suffering experience one's.
[10143] Thus and
[10144] Co-arise near take one's tantra from,
[10145] Actual-accomplish supreme desire,
[10146] Yi-dam abandon not-do and,
[10147] Guru abandon if actual-accomplish destroy.
[10149] Other where accomplish also not-find.
[10150] Therefore dharma for promise taken and,
[10151] Guru's before samaya pledged one's,
[10152] Mind in thought one's virtue's karma,
[10153] That self abandon if actual-accomplish degenerate.
[10154] Thus and
[10155] From the Tantra of the Supreme Trunk of Samaya Arrangements:
[10156] Promises must not be transgressed,
[10157] The guru's commitments must not be broken.
[10158] The guru's activities must not be wrong,
[10159] One's body, speech, and mind—all
[10160] Must not stray from Dharma.
[10161] Acting for the benefit of all beings,
[10162] Always respecting the guru,
[10163] Not transgressing supreme samaya.
[10164] Holding vajra and bell,
[10165] Holding substances suitable for mantra.
[10166] Generally, from root samaya:
[10167] What should be secret and entrusted,
[10168] Secret promises and pledges,
[10169] If wrong conduct with speech or mind,
[10170] This too will increase the uninterrupted continuum.
[10171] Distinctive Dharma arising from empowerment
[10172] Must not be revealed to others; join with mind.
[10173] The guru's mind—if harmed
[10174] By body, speech, or mind,
[10175] Wrong deeds must not be done.
[10176] Similarly, toward vajra siblings
[10177] Harm and injury must not be done.
[10178] Thus.
[10179] Thus, guarding the twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind distinctions is the distinctive Dharma here.
[10180] Furthermore, from Consequence:
[10181] Furthermore, samaya and discipline explained:
[10182] The guru is the basis of Buddha worship,
[10183] Dharma and Sangha, yi-dam deity,
[10184] Vajra sky-goers—to these
[10185] Gathering and worship must not cease.
[10186] Seeing a guru with proper characteristics,
[10187] Praise and worship should be complete.
[10188] Do not disparage women, do not be angry.
[10189] Do not disparage aggregates; rely on yi-dam.
[10190] Mandala, mantra, and deity,
[10191] Mudra reliance is indeed proper.
[10192] Do not break the faithful gathering,
[10193] Do not disturb the virtuous mind.
[10194] The discipline-possessed should dwell in samaya.
[10195] Furthermore, the training sequence:
[10196] Complete bodily conduct,
[10197] Speech must be strictly restrained.
[10198] Mind dwells, examines, and analyzes.
[10199] Enter sequence, do karma sequence.
[10200] Always hand and pill karma,
[10201] Place all channels in the drop-net.
[10202] Garland and necklace, even half,
[10203] Beautifully conduct the wheel.
[10204] Take the chief of supreme attainments,
[10205] Do with the wheel of six place-ornaments.
[10206] All these, without transgression or degeneration, must be earnestly done.
[10207] If these are exceeded, faults are measureless.
[10208] From the Tantra of the Jewel-Stacked Wheel:
[10209] If body samaya is transgressed,
[10210] One is separated from the word called Buddha-body.
[10211] Thus, all beings of the three realms—
[10212] Compared to cutting life at one time,
[10213] By defeat, sin is limitless.
[10214] Similarly, if speech ceases,
[10215] Buddha-speech's word does not dwell.
[10216] Of all beings of the three realms,
[10217] The tongue faculty at one time
[10218] Cut—by this sin is limitless.
[10219] If mind degenerates,
[10220] Filling the three realms with meditators,
[10221] Virtuous monks dwelling in virtue,
[10222] At one time disturbing mind, expelling mind—
[10223] By this, sin increases more.
[10224] Thus.
[10225] Especially, degenerate fall from relying on the guru is heavy.
[10226] From the Glorious Sky-Not-Exhausted Tantra:
[10227] If without bad mind,
[10228] By degenerate mindfulness in dream,
[10229] Or non-virtues becoming careless,
[10230] Confess aimed at the guru.
[10231] Bodily fault by body,
[10232] Thus speech and mind also.
[10233] If not confessed immediately,
[10234] By this too, experience uninterrupted suffering.
[10235] Thus.
[10236] The guru is the nature of all Buddhas,
[10237] Teaching to liberate from samsara by supreme Dharma at this time, therefore the object is fierce.
[10238] Accomplish as spoken,
[10239] Abandoning non-faith,
[10240] Wrong mind,
[10241] Harm,
[10242] And speaking, etc.
[10243] From the mouth of the great master Joy Vajra:
[10244] The supreme guru commanded:
[10245] If knowing the flaw of faults,
[10246] Do as spoken.
[10247] Thus, toward the guru's activity,
[10248] Even if body's suffering becomes supreme,
[10249] By one's own ability, make effort to do.
[10250] The guru's mind, even for a moment,
[10251] Must not be disturbed.
[10252] Toward the guru's food and wealth,
[10253] As one cherishes one's own life,
[10254] The yogi must always act.
[10255] If in the guru's realm,
[10256] Teaching Dharma, empowerment, consecration,
[10257] And all meditations to be done,
[10258] Must not be done without subsequent permission.
[10259] Briefly, by body, speech, and mind,
[10260] Whatever deed's aspect is done,
[10261] Without asking the guru, without permission,
[10262] Even a little must not be done.
[10263] Furthermore, whatever virtuous karma,
[10264] Begin by asking the guru.
[10265] In all yogic conduct,
[10266] Must not separate from the supreme guru.
[10267] Whenever eating food of the three times,
[10268] With first portions cut in three parts,
[10269] Must offer to the supreme guru.
[10270] By wealth and rare jewels,
[10271] To the guru, vajra holder,
[10272] Without desire, offer portions.
[10273] With first portions of whatever and whatever,
[10274] Dedicate and offer to the supreme guru.
[10275] Briefly, all of one's mind,
[10276] Pure aspect, without pretense,
[10277] Aim toward the guru's portion.
[10278] All good qualities will be accomplished.
[10279] Thus.
[10280] Purpose is from Consequence:
[10281] Guru rely circle stream stop.
[10282] Empowerment rely body speech ripen.
[10283] Samaya rely actual-accomplish arise.
[10284] View rely realm three cease.
[10285] Meditate rely delusion stop.
[10286] Conduct rely body purified become.
[10287] Rely this from whatever arise.
[10288] This self samaya discipline's.
[10289] Thus.
[10290] That also samaya's sequence from exceed if restore's ritual to effort and,
[10291] Respective's cross-degenerate's distinction know confess do.
[10292] Nature's cross-degenerate is explained ones in,
[10293] Time's cross-degenerate is samaya degenerate one to also,
[10294] Time long to gone and heavy to gone,
[10295] Degenerate's contradict,
[10296] Degenerate,
[10297] Crossed,
[10298] Loose and four know do.
[10299] That in samaya from contradict is direction agree's fault tainted is although this occasion in degenerate's contradict to apply if,
[10300] Samaya degenerate's fault day gap not samaya from contradict called.
[10301] Month gap not is degenerate.
[10302] Year gap not is crossed.
[10303] Year two and three gone is loose.
[10304] That to respective's restore method also know restore do.
[10305] Vajra sun samaya arranged one's tantra from,
[10306] General samaya distinction from,
[10307] Time from distinction certain divided,
[10308] Samaya from contradict called fault whatever.
[10309] Day gap not in,
[10310] Aimed object to confess done if,
[10311] That corner even enter one's,
[10312] Degenerate called month not-respected.
[10313] Regret intense confess,
[10314] Samaya from crossed if year,
[10315] Middle gap not confess,
[10316] Year two and three from,
[10317] Samaya loose called.
[10318] Supremely pure if restore able.
[10319] Year three from exceed after,
[10320] That restore able not is.
[10321] If take both's burn.
[10322] Certain earth-dwell suffering to,
[10323] Continually conduct only.
[10324] Contradict if gathering's wheel confess.
[10325] Degenerate if self's possession restore.
[10326] Crossed child and wife and,
[10327] Near-circle body and speech and,
[10328] Mind and possession accompany restore.
[10329] Loose self's life restore.
[10330] That from again become if,
[10331] Degenerate great called.
[10332] Restore able not.
[10333] Thus.
[10334] Third supreme's samaya explain is.
[10335] Letter not-have from,
[10336] That time guard one's boundary crossed one's,
[10337] Not-have and one alone vast one's,

[10464] Secret-mantra all's meaning great is.
[10465] Thus spoke.
[10466] This is place important great.
[10467] Vehicle's supreme jewel one's treasury from,
[10468] Samaya aspects arranged is sequence house seven is.
[10469] Thus empowerment and samaya's king great shown after,
[10470] Now essence meaning's nature certainty place from,
[10471] First basis nature aspect pure's dimension ultimate truth secret-mantra vajra's place difficult spontaneous accomplish one's mandala's nature shown is two.
[10472] Basis seven's nature general shown and.
[10473] Supreme's basis particular explain one's.
[10474] First in three.
[10475] Basis seven's nature briefly shown.
[10476] Extreme-hold's basis seven fault having shown.
[10477] Primordial-pure spontaneous-presence not-different's basis self-text in place one's.
[10478] First is generally great-completion's system basis's view seven shown is.
[10479] Established-view speak one's self-text respective hold is.
[10480] That also basis primordial-pure view.
[10481] Basis spontaneous-presence view.
[10482] Basis not-certain view.
[10483] Basis certain meaning actual-basis view.
[10484] Basis whatever transform able view.
[10485] Basis whatever promise able placed view.
[10486] Basis various view and seven.
[10487] That also primordial-pure's direction one to attached after respective promised.
[10488] Self-arise's wisdom this to,
[10489] Whatever exist not-exist's promise not-have and.
[10490] Elaboration-free drop great's aspect from basis primordial-pure view.
[10491] Awareness's nature to quality self-nature primordial dwell sun and ray's manner having and stain not-have view spontaneous-presence.
[10492] Awareness's nature to this is one not-established direction all elaboration-free great view not-certain.
[10493] Awareness's nature change not view certain having.
[10494] Awareness's nature to whatever arise view whatever transform able view.
[10495] Awareness's nature to samsara-nirvana's dharma all arise view whatever promise able view.
[10496] Awareness's nature to appear manner thought not-cease appear view various view khra bo called.
[10497] This also awareness one to respective's tenet direction one see after placed is.
[10498] Consequence from,
[10499] Fall establish one's ground-reality.
[10500] Dwell seven's manner also.
[10501] Various aspect from spontaneous-presence to,
[10502] Move measure aspect from certain not-have.
[10503] Not-move from certain having.
[10504] Appear's measure whatever transform.
[10505] All arise therefore promise accompany.
[10506] Delusion purify therefore primordial-pure to,
[10507] Appear manner all khra bor call.
[10508] Thus and.
[10509] Klong six from,
[10510] First fall establish one's basis.
[10511] Exist one from not-have from,
[10512] Delude as appear's direction from,
[10513] Realize ones certainty placed if,
[10514] Sequence seven's manner appear.
[10515] Sequence seven's appear also.
[10516] Nature one's appear manner from,
[10517] One not-know thus appear.
[10518] However that meaning this like is.
[10519] Spontaneous-presence itself in dwell to,
[10520] Various gather essence appear.
[10521] Certain not-have in dwell to,
[10522] Move do mind having aspect appear.
[10523] Certain self face in dwell to,
[10524] Remember do move not aspect appear.
[10525] Transform able in dwell to,
[10526] Effort mind's aspect appear.
[10527] What of nature in dwell to,
[10528] Whatever appear self's nature aspect appear.
[10529] Khra bo in dwell to,
[10530] Various respective's manner aspect appear.
[10531] Primordial from pure in dwell to,
[10532] Stain primordial not-have aspect appear.
[10533] This all mind's sequence from,
[10534] Self face primordial from pure.
[10535] Thus.
[10536] Second extreme-hold's basis seven fault having shown is.
[10537] Blind before elephant say like.
[10538] Awareness's direction one realize's part to cling promise deep placed one accompany after view,
[10539] That refute to meaning seven from,
[10540] First spontaneous-presence view refute to,
[10541] View speak and.
[10542] That refute two from,
[10543] First is spontaneous accomplish one's ground-reality.
[10544] India also not-cut.
[10545] Direction whatever to not-fall view.
[10546] Second is first from spontaneous accomplish if samsara always circle liberate not-reasonable spontaneous-presence is one's purpose.
[10547] Nirvana also self face know etc. condition not-depend fall.
[10548] First from nirvana spontaneous accomplish one's purpose.
[10549] That two's basis spontaneous-presence is thus also not-reasonable.
[10550] Spontaneous-presence is if not-change samsara-nirvana arise not-reasonable.
[10551] Or who also effort not-have liberate become.
[10552] Cause-effect primordially spontaneously-accomplished being cause.
[10553] Like-that-if cause-effect time simultaneous follows.
[10554] Accept-if cause samsara be time.
[10555] Effect nirvana-from not being cause clear.
[10556] Those two one-if samsara nirvana-as follows.
[10557] Nirvana samsara-as follows two one being cause.
[10558] Accept-if separate not possible and.
[10559] Pure impure exist cause clear.
[10560] Those and other also faults many not dwell.
[10561] Klong-drug-pa from,
[10562] Spontaneous-accomplishment variety base that also.
[10563] Correct base truly not.
[10564] If be then like-this become.
[10565] These sentient beings effort,
[10566] Liberation itself-as not become.
[10567] Non-recognition itself obscured cause.
[10568] Awareness exist cause liberation said-if,
[10569] Effect also liberation itself not become or.
[10570] For-example charcoal black upon,
[10571] Cleaning pure white of.
[10572] Color change able not like.
[10573] Cause and effect separate cause.
[10574] Again spontaneous-accomplishment not.
[10575] Like-that cause and effect one-if,
[10576] Effort those-for need not become.
[10577] Therefore spontaneous-accomplishment called base.
[10578] Meaning understand able not.
[10579] Samantabhadra me-to said.
[10580] Teacher said bodhisattva great.
[10581] As you understand like.
[10582] This knowable dharmas only-from,
[10583] Correct essence not.
[10584] Thus.
[10585] Second also accept establish.
[10586] Nature not established cause not determined and.
[10587] Condition changed cause not determined.
[10588] Semde from,
[10589] Not-determined name-of variety from,
[10590] Meaning also label only empty.
[10591] Nature one-as not determined cause.
[10592] Whatever label that-like appear.
[10593] Thus.
[10594] Second that refutation.
[10595] One be-if one not be direct-contradiction substance separate cause reason harms.
[10596] Base not-determined that samsara cause-base be-if that itself-as determined cause own-word clear.
[10597] Nirvana-of base be-if also clear.
[10598] Also base that pure be-if impure not cause alternation not-determined accept cause contradict and.
[10599] Also impurity pure-from also impure revert follows.
[10600] Base-to not-determined ground no cause.
[10601] Also samsara-nirvana mutually mix follows.
[10602] Base not-determined cause anywhere change being cause.
[10603] Accept-if sentient beings effort without liberate and.
[10604] Buddha impure revert cause suffering-to engage follows.
[10605] Also base that mind-possessor-as follows not-determined thus one-only assert-as determined cause.
[10606] Those etcetera-of faults many exist.
[10607] Klong-drug-pa from,
[10608] Not-determined of base said.
[10609] This also base truly not-able.
[10610] I intelligence level this-like understand.
[10611] Effect alternation possess-or.
[10612] Or revert with become.
[10613] Not-determined determined become and.
[10614] Not-determined determined become.
[10615] Own not-determined own exist cause.
[10616] Determined be-if action end like.
[10617] This all knowable not.
[10618] Teacher said that-like.
[10619] Thus.
[10620] Third also accept express.
[10621] Essence-to change not cause sky like.
[10622] Appearance change not-able fire and water like determined accept.
[10623] Second that refutation.
[10624] Essence-to not appearance change not-able cause.
[10625] Base that-from samsara arise not valid and.
[10626] Who also liberate not possible.
[10627] Nirvana primordially exist-if eternalist permanent and difference not cause condition-from liberate accept cause contradict.
[10628] Samsara-of essence nirvana being cause not change thus accept-if.
[10629] Essence nirvana be-if just liberate not necessary.
[10630] Fire hot just change not necessary like.
[10631] Mind-appearance-to necessary thus say-if.
[10632] Appearance change not-able cause contradict.
[10633] Samsara-of appearance being.
[10634] Base-of appearance not thus say-if.
[10635] Base that dual possess follow.
[10636] Base-from separate samsara-of appearance exist cause.
[10637] Also base that realize-if determined accept cause base-as not possible.
