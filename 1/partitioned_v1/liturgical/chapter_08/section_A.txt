[13878] Three peaks branched, door central crown Brahma-aperture light making,
[13879] Then awareness thought-free body arises.
[13880] Right peak right ear light,
[13881] Karma wind moves,
[13882] Its branch subtle two nostrils two pierce, karma wind doing and together moves,
[13883] Wind Avadhuti enters and wind concentration meditation support does.
[13884] Left ear one peak pierced, from that wisdom wind arises.
[13885] Left channel nature bindu,

[14007] That also Roma called—
[14008] Sealed supreme food like taste experience does,
[14009] Nature placed dead taste like, thus unable to benefit.
[14010] This itself male's right, female's left exists.
[14011] Some tantras reversed shown, but intention different only.
[14012] Kyangma is:
[14013] Concentrated dharma thought-free experience birth purpose, Kyangma,
[14014] Nature placed other not-connected pillar-like abiding.
[14015] This itself male's left, female's right exists.
[14016] Kun'darma is:
[14017] Male and female both's center abides,
[14018] Pressed wisdom clear experience birth,
[14019] Nature placed body-speech-mind three's sustaining action does.
[14020] These three channels all channels' basis mother not, thus "ma" tagged.

[14085] Kun'darma both's center not-changing abiding—
[14086] Uncontrived meaning basis great perfection all pointing.
[14087] Second, special channels three's purifier:
[14088] Roma's vital point skilled, body's action all purifies,
[14089] Kyangma speech and
[14090] Kun'darma mind action done purifies.
[14091] Third, those channels' indication:
[14092] Roma bliss thought-free indicates, that itself dependent-origination wheel turned, memory exhausted taste form like becomes, thus Roma called.
[14093] Kyangma:
[14094] Clear many tastes one indicates, bindu single meaning abides, thus Kyangma called.
[14095] Kun'darma union non-dual indicates, method bliss and wisdom emptiness union and

[14097] Non-dual limit-free pure view called.
[14107] Insertion place joining does.
[14108] Conventional also mind's ripeness birth spinal vertebrae twenty-one on exists,
[14109] Female's thirteen on exists, thus channel lotus's stigma peak on exists.
[14110] Its branch breast peak from gathered.
[14111] Those branches sixteen sutra-gathering on exists.
[14112] Male's ribs between exists.
[14113] Those body attachment and abiding and destruction action near-taking does.
[14114] Kyangma:
[14115] Speech produces.
[14116] Upon that no-curve straight, voice sweet sign clear,
[14117] Branch subtle exists, voice high short or

[14140] rtsa that slip always mind light virtue in engage
[14141] rtsa that mouth open always effort great and engage complete
[14142] that-also body-by rtsa produce
[14143] rtsa-by speech produce
[14144] speech-by mind produce
[14145] mind-by chos-nyid produce
[14146] chos-nyid-by yogi-to produce produce called
[14147] five rtsa those-by action what does is
[14148] ro-ma-by pure-ma lamp radiance show does
[14149] dross-by urine drip action does
[14150] rkyang-ma-by pure-ma upward throw lamp-itself self-appearance show does
[14151] experience and increase does
[14152] that-of dross downward split urine feces discard does
[14153] kun-'dar-ma-by pure-ma upward throw
[14154] ultimate byang-chub mind actual show

[14156] relative byang-sems thig-le descend does
[14157] that-also man-by actual descended
[14158] bliss encounter touch destroy called
[14159] experience thig-le fall before bliss destroy does
[14160] woman rig-can five-by covered dwell touch increase called again bliss expand satisfy not-know

[14207] Kun'darma mind's movement memory-thought pure dharmata joined, thought before-after self-ceased self-liberated self-arisen wisdom joined, object-condition dharmata liberated,
[14208] Memory-thought self-exhausted dharmata's intention arises.
[14209] Thus:
[14210] Body three-body mandala body,
[14211] As spoken mantra words,
[14212] As thought meditation itself.
[14213] Thus Pearl Garland Tantra spoken.
[14214] That also channel's ripeness divided, channel's own characteristic definite,
[14215] Abode place sought, channel arising dharmata known,
[14216] Channel's leap time known, death-transference and birth-place known,
[14217] Channel's nature sealed, mind concentration wheel not-separated,
[14218] Channel coiled heat measure held, always food yoga becomes,
[14219] Channel transference calculation followed, clothes yoga becomes,
[14220] Channel sent vital point followed, latencies stream-cut purpose channels' vital point very profound.
[14221] Second, four wheels' distinction two:
[14222] Four wheels' establishment and
[14223] Individual enumerations explained.
[14224] First:
[14225] One being's body wheels depending and
[14240] Squeezed flesh and
[14241] Flesh variety heart branched depending—
[14242] These cut and
[14243] Pinched and
[14244] Struck and
[14245] Pierced, life's end makes,
[14246] Bloodletting burning dependent-origination disease liberated.
[14247] Thus earth tree etc. produced fire's cause egg power-cattle,
[14248] Third wheel fire's action chief,
[14249] This body's heat and faculties and color produces,
[14250] Heat great hot element becomes,
[14251] Body's sickness and death condition does,
[14252] Heat small cold disease condition does, sickness and death condition does, elements equal dharmata dependent-origination made liberation.
[14253] That also from fire heat moves wind moved, greatly blazing like,
[14254] Fourth wheel wind's action action does,
[14255] Breath outside-inside moves and
[14256] Upward-going downward-clearing action does,
[14257] Karma wheel samsara's root does,
[14258] Latency and all-affliction action body's elements individual actions agitated, sickness and death condition does,
[14259] Element vital point abandoned dependent-origination liberation.
[14270] Gathering form great but strength weak limbs subtle,
[14271] Gathering leaping form small but strength possessing does.
[14272] Memory's throwing mind clear faculties clear thought coarse not does.
[14273] Gathering thought great and forgotten does.
[14274] Gathering faculties clear mind clear forgotten does.
[14275] Throwing leaping thought great but meditation quickly birth does.
[14276] Tastes' throwing pure, voice sweet words clear sound expert does.
[14277] Gathering voice unpleasant.
[14278] Growing impure, voice sweet eloquence great but voice power not does.
[14279] Peak's throwing pure, mind pure intention complete does.
[14280] Growing impure, mind's good complete but virtue not increase.
[14281] Gathering mind's intention not complete memory-thought wrong does.
[14282] That pure, mind's intention not complete but virtue increasing does.
[14283] That is throwing-gathering's certainty.
[14284] That also four wheels' certainty's reason:
[14285] One and two empowerment and path and final fruit not ripen, three also not ripen, reverse direction certainty also four certain,
[14286] Object and subject sequence by concordant direction certainty also four certain—
[14287] Outside elements four,
[14288] Inside wisdom four,
[14289] Secret lamp four,
[14303] repair method definite explained
[14304] first is
[14305] root channel petal six sixty-four-from split-of petal countless-to
[14306] particularly inner channel definite is
[14307] elements and
[14308] mind and

[14330] breath and awareness-of essence gather
[14331] leisure all-gathered channel-plural six
[14332] object and ignorance gather-of
[14333] channel-of form these are
[14334] fifteen upward-to go
[14335] fifteen downward-to go
[14336] eight direct transform definite
[14337] said
[14338] second outer channel-of branch explained is
[14339] that itself from
[14340] emanation wheel these from
[14341] various outward transform doing-by-means-of
[14342] channel-of form these are
[14343] that-of right left petal from
[14344] garland like-of channel great
[14345] color possessing variously transform
