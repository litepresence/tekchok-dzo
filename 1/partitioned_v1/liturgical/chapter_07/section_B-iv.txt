[13648] Empty and
[13649] Clearing—essence-impurity separating action does.
[13650] Trembling and
[13651] Coiling and
[13652] Gapping—
[13653] Bliss and
[13654] Suffering and
[13655] Equanimity's action does.
[13656] Thus channel-wheel gathered center, syllable self-sound and
[13657] Light's tone stirred from,
[13658] Varied white-red light-wheel stirred,
[13659] From five sense-powers individual grasping channels,
[13660] From five sense-power doors, self-syllable lights stirred,
[13661] Varied bliss-suffering branched blazing becomes.
[13662] Those channels all inside, wisdom-nature abiding or path-abiding—not actual,
[13663] Wisdom's tone or potency pervaded, like sesame-oil pervaded or sun-ray spark.
[13664] Channel's self-face wisdom's potency, view-meditation-conduct basis abides.
[13665] Thus two elements gathering action done, body's sense-powers and
[13666] Limbs and
[13667] Skin and
[13668] Hair etc. well produced.
[13669] Then seven-nine and day four passed time,
[13670] By wind's power movement and
[13671] Limbs moving action becomes,
[13672] Mother's flesh-blood essence-food activity arose.
[13673] This time, all-ground consciousness aggregate-basis, pure enjoyment, objects and sense-powers near-taking only became.
[13674] Thus body-tip is head, there channel-enumeration syllable-connection like arranged—Peak-Arranged Wheel thus called.
[13675] Those individual agents aggregate, eighty-five thousand wind-insects,
[13676] By syllable power stirred and
[13677] By wind power moved and
[13678] Food near-takes and
[13679] Body individual going-moving arose, body-existing power, those insects individual consciousness clear arose.
[13680] Previous insects also thus.
[13681] Those insects wind-change and
[13682] Emptying and
[13683] Contracting and
[13684] Stabbing and
[13685] Coiling from,
[13686] Body's elements stirred,
[13687] Wind and
[13688] Bile and
[13689] Phlegm and
[13690] Combined diseases take,
[13691] Bliss-suffering ripen.
[13692] Those enumerations divided—sixteen become,
[13693] That itself male-female change divided—thirty-two female diseases become,
[13694] From those change-numbers, four hundred four common diseases branched.
[13695] Thus Peak-Arranged Wheel, three hundred sixty channels inside,
[13696] Ka ka ki ki
[13697] Etc. syllables seven hundred twenty abide,
[13698] Three hundred sixty light-spheres combined—one thousand eighty,
[13699] Samantabhadra father-mother two thousand eight hundred bodies, each body-speech-mind gods three-three,
[13700] From heart-center wisdom-beings hair-drawn form like each,
[13701] Three thousand two hundred forty complete,
[13702] Eight ten-thousand five thousand insects,
[13703] That many syllables, inside each individual wisdom-seed that many,
[13704] Three hundred thousand, three ten-thousand half and three.
[13705] This time, scripture-not-shown afflictions—eight ten-thousand five thousand,
[13706] Four hundred thousand, one ten-thousand.
[13707] Above channel-growing three thousand two hundred forty,
[13708] Three hundred thousand, one ten-thousand, three thousand, two hundred forty complete abode.
[13709] Sense-powers and sense-power basis dharmas, enumeration measure-not gathered—"basis-of-all" called.
[13710] Thus four body-wheels' channels life-tree taste single all-trembling three by means of,
[13711] Outside body-speech-mind three produced,
[13712] Inside body-speech-mind three produced,
[13713] Secret emanation body,
[13714] Enjoyment body,
[13715] Dharma body three produced—pillar-manner straight abides.
[13716] That also father's bindu syllable A-Om Ah-Hung sound emerged, mother's castle dissolves.
[13717] Mother's condition also with three seed-syllables' sound,
[13718] Six sounds gathered inside, child's body-speech-mind basis from taste-single all-trembling central channel's inside, Om and light and Samantabhadra father-mother's body three complete,
[13719] Right side Ah and light and three bodies,
[13720] Left side Hung and light and three bodies complete—
[13721] Body-speech-mind three-three's support complete.
[13722] Thus from four wheels, first body etc. basis-of-all produced navel and
[13723] Then consciousness complete, thus memory-gathering heart and
[13724] Memory's taste experienced, speech-maker arose, thus tastes throat and
[13725] All's peak variety-arranged crown—four measure determined.
[13726] That also, channels' inside syllables from wind's sound moved,
[13727] Voice arises,
[13728] Clear syllables are sweet voice.
[13729] Unclear, unpleasant,
[13730] From channel-syllable impure, voice trembles,
[13731] Pure and
[13732] With peak etc. arises.
[13733] From channel's vital point changed,
[13734] Males' thick voice—no caste channel and channel-space wide, thus thick.
[13735] That also wide and
[13736] Very wide and
[13752] Male children gaze from mother's right lung inward,
[13753] Female children from the left gaze outward, thus abiding—
[13754] Holding to their own home,
[13755] Going to other's homes, from dependent-origination's action arose.
[13756] Then boys at nine months and ten days are born,
[13757] Girls at nine months born,
[13758] Wind from avadhuti through right-left nose-channels actually moving,
[13759] Afflictions increasingly coarse become,
[13760] Abiding as storehouse of many actions.
[13761] That also, conventional elements four mature the body—
[13762] From earth flesh actually completes,
[13763] From water blood,
[13764] From fire warmth,
[13765] From wind breath actually completes.
[13766] From flesh delusion,
[13767] From blood desire-attachment,
[13768] From heat anger,
[13769] From breath pride,
[13770] Jealousy etc. thoughts different as cause-condition arise.
[13771] From desire-attachment body actually matures—
[13772] First, by desire-attachment all motivated, from that arose.
[13773] From anger blood matures—
[13774] First, depending on anger, speaking sound, from that arose.
[13775] From delusion mind variously matures—
[13776] First, from basis ignorance, confusion, from that arose.
[13777] Thus three also, riding breath's horse, going,
[13778] Three poisons' thoughts different arise.
[13779] That also, delusion's mature-place, sleep arises,
[13780] Desire-attachment's mature-place, laughing when arises,
[13781] Anger's mature-place, various dreams arise.
[13782] Flesh generated by delusion's sign—going flesh all big, sleep big,
[13783] Heat generated by anger's sign—outside moon heat-moisture arriving time, dreams many.
[13784] Anger arising time, body light warmth arises, speech speaking diligent.
[13785] Blood generated by desire-attachment's sign—depending on blood's moving, agitation arises,
[13786] Desire-attachment arising time, moisture dust etc. moist part arises.
[13787] That also, depending on flesh, form's aggregate spreads,
[13788] From blood perception,
[13789] From heat consciousness,
[13790] From breath formations,
[13791] Depending on wind outward completing, feeling spreads.
[13792] That also, flesh generates channel,
[13793] Channel generates wind,
[13794] Wind generates both action and wisdom.
[13795] Action gathers samsara,
[13796] Wisdom gathers nirvana.
[13797] That also, depending on blood lymph generates,
[13798] That generates bindu,
[13799] Bindu generates conventional mature-place five faculties,
[13800] Faculties' cause five afflictions,
[13801] Condition five objects,
[13802] Past future present thought-collections gathered, samsara-nirvana's cause arose.
[13803] That-to ultimate elements four—
[13804] From white color greatly spreading,
[13805] Far-lasso water-lamp's cause made,
[13806] From earth channel arose.
[13807] From greatly red, empty bindu lamp's cause made,
[13808] From water channel arose.
[13809] From greatly yellow, pure space lamp's cause made,
[13810] From fire-wind channel arose.
[13811] From greatly green color,
[13812] Self-arisen wisdom lamp's cause made,
[13813] From wind channel arose.
[13814] That also, self-arisen wisdom generates awareness,
[13815] Far-lasso generates light,
[13816] Bindu generates body,
[13817] Space generates wisdom.
[13818] Far-lasso's dharmata direct appearance seen,
[13819] Empty bindu experience increase seen,
[13820] Space awareness measure arrived seen,
[13821] Self-arisen wisdom lamp engages dharmata-exhausted appearance.
[13822] Those also, from door-eye wisdom arose, actually engage.
[13808] ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle
[13823] From Treasury of Supreme Vehicle's Jewel,
[13824] Latency body's complete manner shown, chapter eleven.
[13825] Thus body complete manner generally shown,
[13826] Now to that, channel wind bindu's abode manner particularly explained—three are:
[13827] Basis channel,
[13828] Supported wind,
[13829] Abiding bindu's particular distinction.
[13830] First-to three are,
[13831] Channel's nature generally shown,
[13832] Enumeration particularly explained,
[13833] Practice manner shown.
[13834] First is:
[13835] From Pearl Garland,
[13836] From channels bindu,
[13837] Subtle and quick essence-possessing,
[13838] By light rays itself beautiful.
[13839] That also three parts,
[13840] Right and left and middle.
[13841] Thus said,
[13842] Here those meanings explained—
[13843] Channel's chief three are:
[13844] Roma,
[13845] Kyangma,
[13846] Kun'darma.
[13847] That-also Roma is:
[13848] Taking all's taste, like salt,
[13849] Depending on bindu's bliss, experiencing uncommon enjoyment arises, thus called taste,
[13850] That also cause from desire-attachment arose, thus called ma,
[13851] Desire-attachment-possessor depending on that becomes buddha.
[13852] Or taste is few action-do, depending on bindu's confusion, experiencing enjoyment difficult to express, thus called ma.
[13853] From that's inside, relative bindu moving, method's nature-possessing.
[13854] Kyangma is:
[13855] Not crooked and branched, straight hollow called.
[13856] Nature-as from ultimate bindu and relative bindu both's cause,
[13857] Ultimate element and
[13858] Relative element mature and separate cause-do.
[13859] Straight is, thus unchanging.
[13860] All's basis is, thus called mo.
[13861] Depending on this, without effort becomes buddha.
[13862] Kun'darma called is:
[13863] All gathering,
[13864] Depending on this, bindu and
[13865] Channel's bliss and
[13866] Wind's bliss all arise, thus ku called,
[13867] That pervading general, thus called darma.
[13868] That-also Roma is:
[13869] From navel's left, coils all from right move,
[13870] Kyangma is:
[13871] From heart peak's left exit,
[13872] From throat channel's net exit,
[13873] From cranium's inside return-enter, left eye door open.
[13874] Roma is:
[13875] From right eye.
[13876] Kun'darma is:
