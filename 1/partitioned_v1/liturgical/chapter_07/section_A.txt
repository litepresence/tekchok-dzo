[12473] End delusion cease time later not-pure lineage cut stain what be that samsara first-last is Buddha last not-possess.
[12474] Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from.
[12475] Spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine.
[12476] Thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show and.
[12477] Now delusion manner and delusion reverse manner sequence symbol door from extensive show to eight from.
[12478] First.
[12479] Basis from basis appear-as arise time ignorance three and condition four delude and.

[12497] That etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise.
[12498] That etc. measure-not-possess-as delude.
[12499] That from delusion-basis not-possess from arise cause.
[12500] Thus cyclic existence by name arises.
[12501] The inconceivable forms of beings arise.
[12502] Delusion's path and thought, however conceived, arise as such—thus it is said.
[12503] Therein Vajrasattva is Rigpa, Awareness Itself.
[12504] The Broad Expanse, field of display—
[12505] the Primordial Four.
[12506] Beautiful Abode,
[12507] gateway where basis-appearances spontaneously arise.
[12508] When time dissolves,
[12509] self non-recognition appears as other—the deluded basis-display.
[12510] Year of the Pig,
[12511] time when ignorance is fully conceptualized.
[12512] Emanated Sun,
[12513] clear thought-grasping of coarse appearances.
[12514] Star of the Bird,
[12515] attachment to objects arisen as desire.
[12516] The Elder Crone,
[12517] non-recognition consciousness arisen as deluded grasping.
[12518] Indeterminate lineage,
[12519] basis-appearance wherever arising and liberating—common ground of delusion and liberation.
[12520] Four companions,
[12521] Four conditions.
[12522] Five wild men,
[12523] Five poisons.
[12524] One back-support,
[12525] conceptualizing mind.
[12526] One thief,
[12527] anger.
[12528] One accumulating all,
[12529] delusion-appearance established as one.
[12530] That mind indeed grasps delusion-appearance.
[12531] From that, many afflictions arise—
[12532] hosts of armies.
[12533] Thus delusion from primordial purity, without samsara-basis, from incompleteness arisen.
[12534] Second,
[12535] practice lineage indicates delusion and
[12536] liberation—two revealed.
[12537] Again from self-arisen
[12538] HO! Listen, O pure ones of the expanse!
[12539] The Buddha intention—measure this all to be grasped.
[12540] Before, in the Broad Expanse,
[12541] Teacher Light-Spread existed.
[12542] He had two sons,
[12543] imprisoned in empty cave—thus the symbolic narrative.
[12544] Five soldiers arose, stone fortress destroyed—thus the symbolic narrative.

[12555] Then four mirrors looked,
[12556] self by self-face known—thus the symbolic narrative.
[12557] House with eight doors seen, self laughed at self—thus the symbolic narrative.
[12558] Thus symbols, appearances all
[12559] indicate—wisdom meaning applied
[12560] thus it is said.
[12561] Teacher Light-Spread is
[12562] self-arising wisdom.
[12563] Two sons are
[12564] awareness pure and spontaneous wisdom two.
[12565] Imprisoned in cave is
[12566] in spontaneous appearance wisdom mother-son mixed,
[12567] by non-recognition bound in samsara.
[12568] Five men destroying stone fortress peak is
[12569] five poisons moving awareness from self-abode, caused delusion.
[12570] Two sons, door closed by Elder Crone is

[12575] Four wisdoms:
[12576] Liberating wisdom liberates afflictions.
[12577] Gathering wisdom gathers wisdom.
[12578] Distinguishing wisdom separates afflictions and wisdom.
[12579] Moving wisdom moves to expanse.
[12580] Two sons losing, killing guard is
[12581] knowing self by self-awareness, obscurations binding actions self-liberated without trace.
[12582] Two sons fleeing to Sun-Rain, gathering tax is
[12583] Rigpa, awareness knowing itself.
