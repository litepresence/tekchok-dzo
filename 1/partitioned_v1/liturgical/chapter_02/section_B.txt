[684] Like scattered stars.
[685] Thus from immeasurable fields,
[686] This Sahā's sequence is explained:
[687] From that itself:
[688] External elements from wind also,
[689] Connected with space's khams,
[690] That water, that upper earth.
[691] Extent breadth thick equal,
[692] Countless four and hundred-thousand one,
[693] One is that's four portion empty.

[703] Moon stainless and
[704] From sun greatly-illuminating,
[705] World khams expanded is,
[706] Paranirmitavaśavartin and so forth upper sequence.
[707] Then asuras abodes,
[708] Continents four's humans sequence.
[709] By kleśas with self,
[710] Lower realms abodes sequence arisen.
[711] Thus and,
[712] From Pearl garland's tantra:
[713] Sky wind supports that water,
[714] By hundred-thousand eleven,
[715] Round coiled itself arisen.
[716] Like cream arisen from milk,

[750] Kleśas desire and so forth,
[751] Gradually became coarse itself.
[752] That faculties and so forth gates,
[753] Light and so forth decrease, reason merit exhausted.
[754] Then sequence earth oil and
[755] Eat rice and so forth food.
[756] Thus and so forth taught thus:
[757] Here that's meaning slightly definite shown is:
[758] Common sūtras and treatises from known and
[759] Uncommon tantra-sections from measure and arrangement much taught although,
[760] Here unsurpassed vehicle Vajra-peak like explained.
[761] Ati-koṭa-great from arising like entity abiding's meaning not-mistaken established is:
[762] Brahma-great's field's category included space in,
[763] Gang-chen-tsho's hand's lotus's center's layers three-thousand twenty-five stacked abiding fields are:
[764] Basis and essence flower by-means-of ornamented field called,
[765] That's inside from thirteenth heart glorious center's middle abiding secret-mantra vajra-vehicle's field Sahā's world this's arrangement to,
[766] Fortunate-aeon first arising,
[767] Middle abiding,
[768] End destroying,
[769] Finally emptying four knowing from,
[770] First arising container and
[771] Essence's sequence two's first container arising's sequence is:
[772] This's side previously arisen world empty from intermediate fortunate-aeon twenty passed's below,
[773] Elements seed's portion not-clear color five arising-possible space empty in,
[774] Upper direction formless's khams called consciousness grasping's object-possessor arising element seed's portion with arisen from drops manner essences upper-arisen like.
[775] Lower direction container's sequence caitya's terrace like below arising's manner is:
[776] Container-contained first arising that time,
[777] Lower basis completely mind joy called space color white white light possessing,
[778] Extremely white terrace appearance in,
[779] Three-thousand's world this supporting seed E triangle clear space arisen.
[780] Space that from wind pervading entering protecting called seed A Uṃ called sound three-times proclaimed from:
[781] Namely wind of variously-stopping,

[821] These element mandalas also
[822] Formed supported one on one like stupa tiers.
[823] From sutra, these between-between sky also explained demarcated intervals each that much measure of upper leagues.
[824] From Vajra-peak world arrangement,
[825] Between water and earth also called sky mind-protecting,
[826] Fire mandala depth one thousand leagues, raised by five thousand leagues, in center,
[827] Width five hundred-thousand,
[828] Possessing red light,

[844] From stirred all earth and water mandalas,
[845] Like example of butter arisen from churned milk or curd,
[846] Dust impurity went to gold, went to depth by heavy, formed ground base,
[847] Center Meru elevated upward hundred-thousand sixty ten-thousand leagues, floated clear above,
[848] Also inserted that much downward to gold ground,
[849] Combined three hundred-thousand twenty-thousand leagues.
[850] From some tantra,
[851] Also explained inserted downward ten-thousand four thousand leagues.
[852] That Meru's east formed from silver,
[853] South baiḍūrya,
[854] West padma rāga,
[855] North formed from gold, direction sky's radiance harmonious with these.
[856] That Meru from gold ground elevated, half eighty-thousand leagues below water submerged,
[857] Below half above, four stacked tiers remain, lower wind tier called turquoise vajra-possessing, turquoise vajra inserted,
[858] That also width eighty-thousand leagues, equal distance with water,
[859] Elevated outward sixteen thousand from Meru,
[860] Height three-times all equal,
[861] Summit one upward ten ten-thousand leagues exist.
[862] Second tier is:
