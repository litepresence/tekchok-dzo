[192] From the Meeting of Father and Son:
[193] "Great hero, skilled in skillful-means,
[194] For the complete ripening of sentient-beings,
[195] Though becoming Buddha ten-million times,
[196] Still you guide, O Teacher,
[197] Demonstrating many Buddhas"—
[198] Thus.
[199] From the Flower Ornament:
[200] "Having attained the ocean of supreme enlightenment,
[201] For the complete ripening of the ocean of sentient-beings,
[202] Demonstrating the ocean of bodhicitta generation,
[203] Showing the ocean of conduct undiminished through all time—
[204] Such is the emanation of the Sugatas."
[205] Thus spoke the Bhagavan.
[206] Therefore, the first Protector, intending to tame this realm, displayed through emanations that manner of mind-generation—
[207] Regarding this Fortunate Eon, before immeasurable eons past,
[208] In the field called "Self-Nature Completely Arranged,"
[209] To Buddha Flower-Great-Beauty offered one golden vajra, generating supreme bodhicitta as the first mind.
[210] Then in the second birth, in the north, "Wind-Movement Arranged," becoming householder Good-Give's son called Jewel-Garland,
[211] Dwelt near Buddha Wheel-Well-Conduct, hearing Dharma.
[212] Then passed beyond, born as a son called "Lightning-Light" in the Bliss-Intoxicated Island, the brahmin youth Good-Give.
[213] At that time, heard Dharma from Buddha Good-Intelligence for five years, and for seven years abided in single-pointed samadhi.
[214] At seventy-five years, demonstrated manifest complete Buddhahood upon the peak of the mountain called "Jewel-Precious-Heap-Arranged."
[215] Having dwelt for one great eon in the meaning of dharma-body,
[216] Then self-arose as the Victor's enjoyment-complete body in ornament and color wheel.
[217] From the spreading-gathering of light-rays, arose thirty-six self-arisen tantras.
[219] From the bindu of light, abiding, established sixty complete perfections,
[220] Buddha-bodies hundred-thousand countless, inexpressible, self-appearing;
[221] From the tongue-faculty of those appearing as five-family Buddhas, immeasurable light-rays radiate forth, all through the proclaimed sound of self-arisen six syllables, compassion without activity radiates in ten directions.
[222] From that very state, Buddha Vairochana the great manifest, body with principal and retinue countless, dharmatā Samantabhadra's complete enjoyment gathering,
[223] Great Perfection's body blazes with light.
[224] Likewise Akṣobhya,
[225] Ratnasaṃbhava,
[226] Amitābha,
[227] Amoghasiddhi and so forth, with individual mandalas and retinues countless, inexpressible,
[228] Gathering in his own complete enjoyment, Great Perfection's body blazes with light.
[229] At that time, in Light-House completely pure, supremely well-arranged upper dwelling,
[230] Teacher Completely Pure, Self-Knowing Awareness King, Vairochana Gang-chen-mtsho by name,
[231] Became lord of all mandalas.
[232] Body-speech-mind without fabrication, precious teaching's state unmoving,
[233] Non-arising,
[234] Non-abiding,
[235] Non-taking,
[236] Non-rejecting,
[237] Non-moving itself self-arisen.
[238] At that time, the tamer of those not to be tamed, precious beautiful retinue assembly hundred-thousand countless,
[239] From his own body,
[240] Speech,
[241] Mind,
[242] Qualities,
[243] Activities themselves radiate and gather.
[244] Thus all appearances—upper
[245] And lower,
[246] Ten directions' worlds—not being,
[247] All completely pure, dense arrangement, blissful field, self-appearance completely pure, self-arisen Buddha-field clearly became.
[248] From that very appearance-aspect, marks and characteristics complete, the arising of Vajradhara's qualities complete body:
[249] From offering a vajra as basis for mind-generation arose this.
[250] That merit pure, body appears without nature,
[251] Accumulation pure,
[252] Mind's great wisdom conducts all aspects known.
[253] Thus in dharma-body time, when place, dharma-sphere, object, and thought are pure,
[254] Teacher Samantabhadra's natural activities all complete, perfectly accomplished and abides.
[255] Upon one particle of retinue, particles-number Buddhas countless, with teaching actual nature, dzogchen dharma-nature vajra whoever—uncompounded.
[256] When viewing dharma-nature, pure conduct, perfections five abide.
[257] In this time, body-speech-mind inexhaustible, ornament-wheel activities thirty-six.
[258] Body's outer activities four:
[259] Unchanging,
[260] Uncoming,
[261] Ungoing,
[262] Non-abiding.
[263] Inner four:
[264] Non-appearing,
[265] Non-doing,

[270] Even,
[271] Loose,
[272] Direct.
[273] Speech's outer activities four:
[274] Inexpressible,
[275] Unshowable,

[293] Inner four:
[294] Victory-banner peak play,
[295] Lightning garland,
[296] Great wheel,
[297] Light-blazing samadhi.
[298] Secret four:
[299] Mudrā's subjugation,
[300] Great-blaze's equality,
[301] Diversity of dharmatā,
[302] Samadhi called "self-appearing spontaneous adornment."
[303] Those also not the activity of meaning's agent,
[304] But called "activity" through the arising of qualities' essence and radiance.
[305] From that, enjoyment-complete body's self-arising:
[306] From the play of unobstructed radiance of former appearances and compassion's arising manner,
[307] The pure abodes are densely arranged.
[308] From the equal-expanse gesture of the great ocean's teacher of complete manifestation—at the lotus-pericarp's base from the thumb, upon the tiny protuberances, upon the layered arrangement of thirty-two realms, the appearances abiding as layered masses, with varied colors and forms like water and moon—
[309] All layered masses as well, infinite and vast like palace arrangements.
[310] In arrangements like descending offering-feast houses.
[311] The bodies of five-family Buddhas as well, all-enumerable in variety.
[312] In the perfume-water stream below the lotus-throne, infinite.
[313] The sixteen sixteen realms as well, not as layered masses.
[314] Like infinite jewel-umbrella arrangements.
[315] In arrangements like mutual grain-pile masses, also enumerable including five-family Buddhas.
[316] Furthermore, from all pores of hair-light, radiating into space—also infinite enumerable variety of realms and teachers, boundless, measureless, infinite.
[317] Thus in enjoyment-body's realm:
[318] Teaching actual, speech self-arisen syllables whoever not made, yet all teaching's sons and simultaneous appearances those abide—
[319] At the time of unchanging dharmatā.
[320] From the thirty-six self-arisen activities of the enjoyment-body's body, speech, mind inexhaustible ornament-wheel:
[321] The body's four outer activities:
[322] Through body appearing without self-nature, obscurations are purified.
[323] By perfected wisdom face-hand, the body's self-nature is perfected.
[324] By clear light face-hand, self-appearance is liberated.
[325] By clear discerning face-hand, knowledge is perfected.
[326] The four of the inner:

[328] By possessing the eighty signs, reality is perfected.
[329] By emanating masses of light-rays, special qualities are perfected.
[330] By face pervasively residing in all directions, the characteristic of enjoyment is perfected.
[331] The four of the secret:

[338] By entering the father's face, enjoyment of markless dharma is made.
[339] By emerging from mother's space, engagement with non-dual reality is made.
[340] By that same emanating and gathering, deeds without nature are perfected.
[341] The four of the inner:
[342] By self-nature explained, control of inexpressible sound is made.
[343] By non-word, enjoyment of reality beyond speech and thought is made.
[344] By appearing as understood meaning, enjoyment of non-composite reality is made.
[345] By many light-rays emanating from face, enjoyment of disciple and discipliner dharma is made.
[346] The four of the secret:
[347] By pure body practice, engagement with self-arisen dharma is made.
[348] By pure speech practice, engagement with outflow-free dharma is made.
[349] By pure mind practice, enjoyment of wisdom knowing all aspects is made.
[350] By pure face practice, enjoyment of all-knowing dharma is performed.

[365] By abiding in non-dual object-mind, the concept limit of apprehension-apprehender is cut.
[366] Third, the method of turning the wheel through emanation-body emanation:
[367] Then from enjoyment-body appearance, gone to emanation-body, those gone having clearly emanated twelve earth teachers in twelve abodes,
[368] Possessing the nature of five-five perfections.
[369] At the time of these, also by appearance of three great emanations, benefit to beings is performed.
[370] By emanation-body in this Jambu continent, place of disciples,
[371] The Dharma-body teaching, self-arisen from Great Perfection blessing, filling the hands of people from Vajra Amitayus self-born from one hundred jewel causes until now,
[372] The Enjoyment-body teaching, self-arisen from Self-arisen teaching single-son blessing, self-born from one hundred jewel causes, four books of letters, renowned as dharma self-sound.
[373] The body-form self-born without anyone making, equal to beings' body bulk, self-arisen from twelve emanation-body blessings, from one hundred jewel causes.
[374] Those three emanations of body, speech, mind, not made by anyone, fearless.
[375] By self-arisen blessing, miracles and immeasurable qualities.
[376] Possessing the activity of immediately liberating birth when meeting with whichever.
[377] That also, the mind-support Vajra, from disease-free of those beings wishing to pacify disease,
[378] Fulfilling desires and applying to liberation.
[379] The speech-support self-arisen letter, meeting with that,
[380] Liberated by merely meeting and hearing the sound.
[381] This book, writing and holding, possesses liberating activity without effort.
[382] That body performs liberating activity into clear light when meeting with whichever body.
[383] Where these exist, one asks.
[384] They abide in different places by the times of body, speech, mind teachings.
[385] That also, from Amitayus life, from the time of thousand Buddhas, the body-taming teaching,
[386] Exists three times five hundred five thousand years.
[387] Then until seventy years of life, the speech-taming teaching,
[388] One five hundred five thousand years.
[389] Then until ten years of life, the mind-taming teaching,
[390] One five hundred five thousand years.
[391] In the interval of those life years, that much year exists but not time,
[392] The year numbers tamed by those teachings are explained.
[393] That also, at the time of body teaching, that Vajra exists in the island possessing salty taste, Uddiyana land ocean,
[394] Occasionally making countless emanations possessing light, sound, and monk miracle arise.
[395] The letter, held by dakinis in the sky above five hundred leagues of Vajra-seat, abides.
[396] The body abides together with that.
[397] At the time of speech teaching.
[398] The vajra at Mount Malaya, at the hand-vajra's abode, yakṣa kings render homage.
[399] The syllable in Vajrāsana's upper sky, held by ḍākinīs abides.
[400] The body, not fixed in one place, circumambulates Jambudvīpa,
[401] Making offering-fields for special assemblies of gods and humans;
[402] When harm arises to the teaching,
[403] From body comes light,
[404] From face comes HŪṂ,
[405] From eyes comes fire, turning back the harm.
[406] At the time of mind's teaching, the vajra abides in Vajrāsana's sky.
[407] The syllable abides in the extremely wrathful ṛṣi's cave.
[408] The body in the thirty-three gods' measureless palace,
[409] The hand-vajra's house upper-chamber's upper-story abides.
[410] Such three emanations abiding, Jambudvīpa surpasses all others.
