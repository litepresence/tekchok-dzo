[1704] The aggregate of discipline, for the purpose of purifying manifest stains.
[1705] The aggregate of complete liberation, for the purpose of transcending all concepts.
[1706] Third: The distinctive characteristics of the sense sources.
[1707] That which arises from what and becomes expanded is called "sense source."
[1708] If divided:
[1709] From the aspect of objects, the eye's grasping object, form, and so forth—six things—arise and expand as the two knowings of the moment and the outer continuum.
[1710] From the aspect of knowing, there arise and expand six: eye consciousness and so forth, knowing forms as forms.
[1711] The twelve sense sources are:
[1712] These are:
[1713] The sense sources are two:
[1714] The grasped sense sources, and
[1715] The grasper sense sources.
[1716] The grasped sense sources: Thinking of form, sound, odor, taste, phenomena, and touch as perception.
[1717] The six portions of the grasped: eye, ear, nose, tongue, mind, and body.
[1718] The twelve are: eye grasping, ear grasping, nose grasping, tongue grasping, mind grasping, and body grasping. Thus it is taught.
[1719] Fourth: The essential nature of the faculties that grasp.
[1720] They are called "faculties" because they have power over grasping objects.
[1721] If divided:
[1722] Those arising from the first portion of form-possessing, and
[1723] Those arising from the portion of wisdom—these two.
[1724] First:
[1725] The coarse aggregates arising from the first condition of form-possessing.
[1726] Five: the eye faculty and so forth, which produce the capability of grasping forms.
[1727] The six: the mind faculty, arising from the first condition of form-possessing knowing.
[1728] Second:
[1729] The portion of knowing that arises, capable of engaging objects.
[1730] These are the six: faith and so forth.
[1731] As it is stated in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra.
[1740] The faculties are two:
[1741] The faculty arising from the portion of form, and
[1742] The faculty arising from the portion of wisdom.
[1743] The faculty arising from the portion of form is six:
[1744] The eye faculty, holding the coarse earth portion.
[1745] The ear faculty, holding the moving wind portion.
[1746] The nose faculty, holding the gathering water portion.
[1747] The tongue faculty, holding the ripening fire portion.
[1748] The mind faculty, holding the pervading space portion.
[1749] The body faculty, holding the gathering of various portions.
[1750] The faculty arising from the portion of wisdom is six:
[1751] The faculty of faith, which afflicts the mind completely.
[1752] The faculty of effort, which sharpens the mind.
[1753] The faculty of mindfulness, which holds word and meaning without interruption.
[1754] The faculty of concentration, which manifests the emptiness of dharmata and produces engagement.
[1755] The faculty of wisdom, which engages the meaning of view.
[1756] The faculty of mental peace, which produces the non-conceptual meaning. Thus it is taught.
[1757] Fifth: The aspects of objects and possessors of objects.
[1758] The aspects arise from grasping and the grasper.
[1759] If divided: The portion of phenomenon appearing as the grasped object entity, and the portion of dharmata, the emptiness of that nature.
[1760] The cognition that is object and not object-possessor.
[1761] That, although appearing as object, is free from all extreme grasping.
[1762] The supreme cognition beyond expression that does not appear as object.
[1763] From the previous:
[1764] Objects are two:
[1765] The object of entities, and
[1766] The object of emptiness.
[1767] The object of entities is:
[1768] Form, sound, smell, taste, dharma,
[1769] The appearance of touch, the appearance of the four great elements,
[1770] And the various appearances of entering conditions.
[1771] The object of emptiness is:
[1772] All emptiness, free from all cognition of extreme grasping.
[1773] The non-objects are two:
[1774] The transcendent extremes, and...
[1782] Beyond view.
[1783] What is called "beyond extremes":
[1784] Not grasping any entity as self.
[1785] What is called "beyond view":
[1786] The inexpressible.
[1787] Thus the divisions are:
[1788] Like illusion and dream, appearing as entity yet unestablished.
[1789] Empty by nature, non-existing—merely the delusion of clear appearance.
[1790] The essence of awareness itself, self-arisen wisdom, arising from ignorance.
[1791] That essence becomes obscuration.
[1792] When the delusion of these is cleared,
[1793] It is called "the manifest stainless luminosity."
[1794] Now, these abide by supporting the face of the nature produced by actions and kleśas.
[1795] That, through the support of the alaya with its six or seven groups of incorrect conceptions, abides in the self-arisen wisdom of mind, the thusness of that, in the completely pure self-nature.
[1796] Since that does not abide anywhere, it is called "self-arisen wisdom."
[1797] From the Uttara Tantra:
[1798] Earth is in water and wind.
[1799] Wind abides excellently in space.
[1800] Space is not in wind, water,
[1801] Nor in the earth element.
[1802] Thus, aggregates, elements, and faculties
[1803] Rely upon actions and kleśas.
[1804] Actions and kleśas are not correct,
[1805] Yet mental activities constantly abide.
[1806] The incorrect mental activities
[1807] Abide excellently in the purity of mind.
[1808] The phenomena of mind's self-nature
[1809] Do not abide anywhere.
[1810] Thus it is taught.
[1811] From that: white,
[1812] Black,
[1813] Mixed—three,
[1814] Merit,
[1815] Non-merit,
[1816] And the three immovable actions.
[1817] The action of merit:
[1818] The merit compatible with producing the pleasurable results of samsara here—ten virtues and so forth.
[1819] Non-merit:
[1820] The ten non-virtues and the five uninterrupted offenses.
[1821] The immovable:
[1822] Actions producing results in higher realms, producing immovable results elsewhere.
[1823] The kleśas are six:
[1824] From the Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[1825] The six afflictions are:
[1826] Ignorance: the grasping of the confused conceptual basis.
[1827] Delusion: confusion arising from the portion of wisdom.
[1828] Hatred: confusion arising from the stage of generation.
[1829] Pride: confusion arising from the portion of view.
[1830] Attachment: confusion arising from the portion of appearance.
[1831] Jealousy: confusion arising from unmanifest effects.
[1832] And so forth.
[1833] The afflictions are the mind that grasps all thoughts.
[1834] The memories are the mind that grasps all recollections.
[1835] The concepts that become the basis of all transitional habitual tendencies and doubts.
[1836] The portions that grasp objects and things, and so forth—are called "immeasurable."
[1837] If divided, the conceptual masses generate eighty-four thousand aspects.
[1838] Attachment,
[1839] Hatred,
[1840] Delusion—
[1841] These portions are equally divided into twenty-one thousand, one thousand, and one thousand.
[1842] All of these, although non-existent, are grasped as self—like a mirage, like water, like confusion, arising and grasping a snake where there is only a rope.
[1843] The vessels, contents, and all afflictions, although non-existent, appear as clear luminosity.
[1844] From the Pearl-Garland:
[1845] Thus the various appearances:
[1846] Like seeing a snake where there is only a rope.
[1847] Grasping that which is not that.
[1848] Outer and inner vessels and contents are formed as two.
[1849] When examined, that is merely the rope.
[1850] Vessels and contents are primordially empty.
[1851] They have the form of ultimate and conventional.
[1852] Seeing the snake is true.
[1853] Seeing the rope is truly correct.
[1854] Like a bird dwelling on high.
[1855] The nature of the two truths:
[1856] Merely the conventional world.
[1857] No relation to the ultimate.
[1858] From the expanse of emptiness,
[1859] All aspects of that are liberated.
[1860] Thus it is taught.
[1861] From the previous:
[1862] "Aggregates are like illusory emanations."
[1863] Thus it is taught.
[1864] Since vessels, contents, realms, aggregates, and so forth are called "phenomena of cyclic existence,"
[1865] Knowing the nature, one enters the ultimate truth—the essence of complete purity—which leads to nirvana.
[1866] Here, from the Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[1867] "All of these are merely the causes of samsara."
[1868] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[1869] The detailed division of samsaric phenomena—third chapter.
[1870] Thus, knowing the enumerations of confused appearances,
[1871] Those are designated as the definitive limits of established tenets.
[1872] The extensive explanation of vehicle enumerations:
[1873] From the Great Tantra of Rigpa Rangshar:
[1874] "Hold the secret vajra!
[1875] My vehicle is immeasurable.
[1876] It gathers all modes of explanation into two:
[1877] Samsara and nirvana."
[1878] The meaning of this teaching has two aspects:
[1879] The worldly vehicle, and
[1880] The transcendent vehicle.
[1881] First, the essence of the vehicle:
[1882] Definition,
[1883] Division,
[1884] Purpose,
[1885] And the five results.
[1886] The essence is the definite meaning that dwells in the terminology of enumeration, which attains the results of the mental investigation of samsara that does not transcend.
[1887] The definition:
[1888] Engaging and establishing merely the excellence of the world.
[1889] If divided:
[1890] The two vehicles of fixated and mistaken.
[1891] The purpose:
[1892] Accomplishing one's own results.
[1893] The result:
[1894] The method by which one's own result manifests at a certain time.
[1895] The fixated vehicle of gods and humans:
[1896] Through accumulating merit and maintaining the ten virtues and ethical discipline, one accomplishes the method for achieving future happiness of gods and humans.
[1897] Since what is entered becomes a basis, this is called the fixated vehicle.
[1898] From the Great Magical Net of Vajrasattva:
[1899] "The earlier vehicle is the vehicle of gods and humans."
[1900] The mistaken vehicle:
[1901] From Rangshar.
[1902] The mistaken vehicle is like this:
[1903] It holds the three hundred sixty components of existence.
[1904] Thus it has two aspects:
[1905] The generally taught self-nature of eternalism and nihilism,
[1906] And specifically explained as those types.
[1907] First, the two:
[1908] The eternalist view, and
[1909] The nihilist view.
[1910] First, although the outsider traditions hold many various views,
[1911] The Sāṃkhyas, who propound eternalism of cause, are the foremost of all doctrines.
[1912] First explained is:
[1913] The dust of darkness.
[1914] The essence of the three equal portions of potency is called "self."
[1915] In the hearts of all beings, there are forms corresponding to the size of a thumb.
[1916] The large ones are the size of a thumb.
[1917] The small ones are in sesame pods.
[1918] The even smaller ones are like sesame grains, and so forth.
[1919] White,
[1920] Oily,
[1921] Coiled,
[1922] Without breaking or destroying,
[1923] Existing hiddenly as the self that no one sees.
[1924] Now, the essence of the dust of darkness.
[1925] At the time when desire, hatred, and delusion are equal in three portions,
[1926] The self-nature knows itself,
[1927] Yet does not see the self-nature.
[1928] Later, at liberation,
[1929] At the top of the heavens, appearing like a white umbrella surrounded completely, with the color and form of liberation.
[1930] Now, the self-nature of that, the essence without movement.
[1931] Free from action and activity.
[1932] Deeply knowing objects.
[1933] Since this self-nature existing eternally through time is not known, one is in samsara.
[1934] Knowing that essence without distraction, one is liberated. By practicing well sacrifices and offerings in this life,
[1935] One is born into the complete enjoyment of one's retinue and power in the higher realms.
[1936] From this, branched into many individual traditions.
[1937] Entering from:
[1938] The self that is not the consumer, the eternal entity, the agent.
[1939] Examined by the Sāṃkhyas without qualities.
[1940] Based on slight distinctions,
[1941] The traditions of the Tīrthikas became different.
[1942] Thus it is taught.
[1943] The propounder of nihilism:
