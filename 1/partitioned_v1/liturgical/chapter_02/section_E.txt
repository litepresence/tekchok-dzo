[1513] From four Great Kings to Great Brahma, likewise.
[1514] Vessel destroyed: sun one extremely hot arisen in sky, burned grass trees.
[1515] Two arisen, dried rivers streams ponds.
[1516] Three arisen, dried great rivers streams.
[1517] Four arisen, dried never-warm lake.
[1518] Five arisen, dried great ocean.
[1519] Six arisen, dried great land with snow-mountain.
[1520] Seven arisen, burned all hundred ten-million spontaneously-arisen seven mountains etc.,
[1521] From swirling blazing fire-flame,
[1522] Below reached hell place gold ground,
[1523] Above thoroughly blaze between Brahma world.
[1524] Seven times burn by all thoroughly blaze, not even ash.
[1525] Seven suns and seven blazes, seven fires.
[1526] Then below base clear pure water disturbed scattered, pervaded seven times extent of concentration two,
[1527] Destroyed with measureless-palace like dissolved salt water.
[1528] That water seven.
[1529] Then below base wind vajra-cross arose, all scattered, destroyed below concentration three, became one sky.
[1530] Thus after form abiding destruction, one nature sky empty.
[1531] That also: common vehicle likewise, twenty-eight tens intermediate eons regarded one great eon.
[1532] Pure: birth aging sick dying four, join inner form destroy empty.
[1533] From result-transmission,
[1534] Meaning: destroy and form,
[1535] Abiding itself and empty,
[1536] Birth aging sick dying,
[1537] Existence illusion-wheel itself.
[1538] Said, join.
[1539] That also: from first measureless to end ten, twenty with first final gap,
[1540] Upward birth downward decrease, not-decrease end ten that much only,
[1541] Disease weapon famine small eon each exist.
[1542] Such is the final end.
[1543] From that point, all vessels and essences are utterly destroyed.
[1544] These as well—the three abodes of destruction and emptiness—
[1545] In this uncommon vehicle, the intermediate eons are counted as equal: sixty by sixty, comprising the first great eon of one hundred eighty duration-measures.
[1546] The duration-eon of one hundred eighty is termed the "intermediate eon, the second."
[1547] The intermediate eon of one hundred eighty is considered the "single great eon."
[1548] These also arise from the very nature of transformation.
[1549] This transformation of time unfolds as follows:
[1550] From the primordial measureless beginning,
[1551] Through the ten terminal intervals,
[1552] There is ascent and descent, birth and diminishment.
[1553] Disease, famine, weapons, and strife—
[1554] Three lesser eons bridge the intervals.
[1555] The sixty are exhausted by fire,
[1556] Seven by fire, seven by water.
[1557] Thus fourteen are completed,
[1558] And the remainder is dissolved by wind.
[1559] Thus the sixty abide,
[1560] And the duration of destruction is of similar measure.
[1561] The interval of sixty abides as emptiness.
[1562] Thus from one hundred eighty,
[1563] The first duration-eon is established.
[1564] Thus one hundred eighty
[1565] Constitute the second intermediate eon.
[1566] Thus that which is joined together is
[1567] The single great eon.
[1568] Thus it is taught.
[1569] These detailed explanations with their definitive meanings are
[1570] As extensively taught in the extensive tantra of the wish-fulfilling tree.
[1571] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[1572] The presentation of the world of vessels and essences, in two volumes.
[1573] Thus having instructed and shown the sequence of vessels and essences,
[1574] Now, regarding the enumeration of phenomena and aggregates existing in the elements of those three vajra-states:
[1575] From the tantra of the union of sun and moon:
[1576] The elements, the aggregates,
[1577] The sense-sources, the powers,
[1578] The objects and the awarenesses possessed of duration—
[1579] How they abide shall be definitively set forth.
[1580] Thus the meaning has five aspects:
[1581] The joy of the element-objects.
[1582] The essential nature of basis and aggregates.
[1583] The distinctive characteristics of the forms and sense-sources.
[1584] The essential nature of the powers that grasp.
[1585] The various forms of objects and their possessors.
[1586] First:
[1587] Due to the vast and extensive meaning, this is termed "element."
[1588] If divided:
[1589] Those gathered by outer objects, and
[1590] Those gathered by inner mind—these two.
[1591] First:
[1592] There are five elements.
[1593] They produce and abide as form-possessing entities.
[1594] They serve as cause, condition, basis, and nature for destruction.
[1595] Earth possesses characteristics that are firm and solid.
[1596] Water possesses characteristics that are moist and flowing.
[1597] Fire possesses characteristics that are hot and burning.
[1598] Wind possesses characteristics that move and uplift.
[1599] Space possesses characteristics that are vast and open.
[1600] Through these, vessels and essences are produced and maintained.
[1601] From that itself, the five elements gathered by outer objects are:
[1602] The earth element produces the basis of body.
[1603] The water element holds names.
[1604] The fire element ripens objects.
[1605] The wind element sustains the entire moving world.
[1606] The space element holds the powers. Thus it is taught.
[1607] The elements gathered by inner mind appear as vessel and essence, two:
[1608] Vessel appears as objects, accumulated by actions.
[1609] If divided:
[1610] Those arising from the delusion of outer object-appearing mind, and
[1611] Those arising naturally from the luminosity of inner mind—these two.
[1612] First: The latency of object-appearing mind, like a dream.
[1613] If divided:
[1614] The four desire-realm continents and so forth.
[1615] The five form-objects: lights, self-arisen, like rainbows.
[1616] The formless objects: concentrations, self-emanated, invisible to others.
[1617] From the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra.
[1618] The elements gathered by inner mind are two:
[1619] The element of vessel that gathers beings, and
[1620] The element that arises from mind itself.
[1621] The element of vessel is:
[1622] The form element arising from the vast basis of beings' mindfulness.
[1623] The formless element arising from excessive mindfulness, and
[1624] The desire element arising from limited mindfulness. Thus it is taught.
[1625] Second: That which arises naturally from the luminosity of the inner mind:
[1626] Awareness exists, and through its self-arisen potency comes obscuration—the ignorance of the all-ground.
[1627] From that, arising from the all-ground consciousness, comes mind.
[1628] From that, the five gates of mind and faculties arise as knowing.
[1629] Like a wish-fulfilling tree grown from a golden ground, with branches, flowers, and leaves appearing.
[1630] Dividing this:
[1631] Objects,
[1632] Faculties of cognition,
[1633] Feelings—these three.
[1634] Objects are designated as the six bases of faculties when the mere knowing of the six consciousnesses, arising in this moment, is designated as object. Thus the six bases of faculties are named.
[1635] The faculties of cognition:
[1636] The six present knowings of eye and so forth.
[1637] Feelings:
[1638] The six types of future aspects.
[1639] Whatever object consciousness enters,
[1640] The previous six knowings that maintain continuum are called "objects."
[1641] The knowing that grasps the nature of that in a single moment is called "present knowing."
[1642] After that, feelings that gather as pleasure, pain, or neutrality are called "feelings of contact."
[1643] These arise from the gathering of object and knowing, which is the nature of feeling.
[1644] Thus, dividing the six groups into three types results in eighteen categories:
[1645] From that itself, the elements arising from mind itself are:
[1646] The eye element arising from the clear aspect of knowing,
[1647] The ear element arising from single-pointed knowing,
[1648] The nose element arising from limitless knowing,
[1649] The tongue element arising from knowing gathered as one,
[1650] The mind element arising from knowing that enters all,
[1651] The body element arising from knowing that serves as basis for the others.
[1653] Through holding name and form, the element of eye consciousness.
[1654] Through holding accomplished actions, the element of ear consciousness.
[1655] Through holding others in succession, the element of nose consciousness.
[1656] Through actual experience of objects, the element of tongue consciousness.
[1657] Through pervading all objects and the objectless, the element of mind consciousness.
[1658] Through gathering all meanings, the element of body consciousness.
[1659] Through grasping objects incorrectly and accomplishing objects, the eye gathers and there is the element of contact.
[1660] Through the ear holding and dispersing, there is the ear's gathering and the element of contact.
[1661] Through superior knowings gathering as one and attracting other minds, there is the nose's gathering and the element of contact.
[1662] Through following and taking nearby objects, there is the tongue's gathering and the element of contact.
[1663] Through gathering all mindfulness and entering all objects, there is the mind's gathering and the element of contact.
[1664] Through holding coarse many and arising, there is the body's gathering and the element of contact.
[1665] Therefore, these elements also accomplish the holding of objects.
[1666] These arise from the part that holds within delusion itself. Thus it is taught.
[1667] Second: The aggregates arise from the nature of basis and aggregates, gathered and assembled as one heap. This is called "aggregate."
[1668] If divided:
[1669] The aggregates with thought, and
[1670] The aggregates without thought—these two.
[1671] First:
[1672] The five aggregates of contaminated worldly ordinary beings:
[1673] The form aggregate, suitable for destruction,
[1674] The feeling aggregate, which experiences and becomes desire,
[1675] The perception aggregate, which moves and enters objects,
[1676] The formation factors aggregate, which does and includes latencies.
[1677] The aggregate of consciousness that knows and functions with objects.
[1678] The aggregates without thought are:
[1679] The five parts abiding in the self-awareness of individual noble beings who have transcended the world:
[1680] The aggregate of concentration, the nature of calm-abiding and insight.
[1681] The aggregate of wisdom, liberated from individual afflictions.
[1682] The aggregate of wisdom, seeing the nature of self and generality.
[1683] The aggregate of discipline, completely pure from the direction of stains.
[1684] The aggregate of complete liberation, liberated from elaboration and thought.
[1685] These, when gathered by the training path, abandon those parts and proceed further, moistening the aspect of what is to be abandoned.
[1686] The qualities of the time when one is not training are not like that.
[1687] When liberated all at once, even the name "aggregate" does not remain.
[1688] Since it is said that they are "completely liberated from aggregates," one should understand that although called "one aspect," there is no contradiction.
[1689] As it is stated in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra:
[1690] The aggregates are as follows:
[1691] The aggregates obscured by thought, and
[1692] The aggregates that are naturally free from thought.
[1693] The aggregates obscured by thought are:
[1694] As follows:
[1695] The form aggregate, when all objects are gathered and accomplished.
[1696] The feeling aggregate, when all experiences are gathered.
[1697] The perception aggregate, when the holding of all faculties is gathered.
[1698] The formation factors aggregate, when all subtle afflictions are gathered.
[1699] The consciousness aggregate, when all knowings are gathered.
[1700] The aggregates without thought are:
[1701] The aggregate of concentration, when all concentrations are gathered.
[1702] The aggregate of wisdom, complete liberation, since awareness itself is exhausted of outflows.
[1703] The aggregate of wisdom, since that meaning appears without birth.
