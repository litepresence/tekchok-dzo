[17310] First indeed
[17311] Sentient beings through of ground and buddhas through of ground to regard from Rigpa through of essence exist-manner primordially pure defilement nonexistent and

[17387] This to harm exist
[17388] If Alaya Dharmakaya-is Dharmakaya stain-possess result and
[17389] Alaya container-contained of delusion produce Dharmakaya delusion produce result
[17390] Think-if
[17391] Buddha from again sentient being as delusion result etcetera of reasoning by harm and

[17395] Thus say-and
[17396] Awareness self-arisen-from
[17397] Some Alaya Dharmakaya as think
[17398] That to reply teach of cause
[17399] Alaya of characteristics thus-like
[17400] That from that by reply spoke
[17401] All complete-cause Alaya
