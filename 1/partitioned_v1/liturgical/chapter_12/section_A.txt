[16849] Thus
[16850] Five characteristics
[16851] Outer light of space empty clear open and

[16859] This nonexistent Awareness of object nonexistent through of
[16860] Appearance cease nonexistent of
[16861] Aspect sound of lamp
[16862] Thus
[16863] Six habituate manner
[16864] Samsara-nirvana distinction cut from body speech natural place put
[16865] Manifest face-introduce space of fence in Awareness ten abide day night nonexistent experience make through of
[16866] First light mirror like from

[16870] Whatever appear space of appearance arise from body of between see cease of appearance to reach this of habituate manner
[16871] That from
[16872] Samsara-nirvana distinction cut from
[16873] Body speech natural place put
[16874] That from space-Awareness appearance examine
[16875] This to habituate of measure find from
[16876] Outer itself of appearance
[16877] Above from above increase through of
[16878] Gradually self-habituate great obtain
[16879] This to stable of measure find from
[16880] Dharma all cease become
[16881] That itself habituate make of
[16882] Branch to I explain
[16883] Thus and
[16884] Self-arise from
[16885] See and habituate of pristine awareness
[16886] What to hold of mind nonexistent of

[16893] That to habituate become
[16894] Self of view see
[16895] That to very habituate precious
[16896] Thus
[16897] Seven measure
[16898] Experience make through of nose tip from eyebrow center of upward space to blue from expand of light shimmer lower contour spike appear from

[16934] This enter momentum through of power
[16935] Birth of self-power who obtain
[16936] That also that to focus from
[16937] Again time thus do time
[16938] Appearance of self-sound rustle
[16939] Manifest return delusion appear
[16940] This through of sentient being purpose all do
[16941] Awareness equal one of reason
[16942] Thousand three sentient being of

[16949] Thus and
[16950] Burning-lamp from
[16951] Blue unchanging appearance from
[16952] Throat door clear of light five to also
[16953] This itself very clear become and
[16954] Self of front of upward space to

[16967] That from object area like arise
[16968] That from sky fill arise
[16969] Whatever appear light of mandala to

[16979] Buddha intention valid Dharma
[16980] True meaning to thus gone
[16981] That habituate of measure to explain
[16982] Thus
[16983] Eight location
[16984] Base of space citta
[16985] Path of space briguta
[16986] Fruit self-arise of space of location sky cloud free
[16987] Burning-lamp from

[16999] Thus
[17000] Nine door
[17001] Eye from arise
[17002] That from

[17011] Thus arise door unceasing of
[17012] Thus
[17013] Ten space of lamp actual
[17014] Eye of corner two from arise blue pervade great of light end nonexistent
[17015] Inside Awareness light that of house in abide
[17016] Outward necklace dot emptiness and possess that of fence in abide
[17017] Light five of appearance and rim of fence two space actual
[17018] That also thing coarse nonexistent through of grasp object to not-establish
[17019] Cut extreme cut is through of self-clear rainbow like
[17020] Element harm through of not-break through of compounded samsara not

[17022] Again Buddha become
[17023] That from
[17024] Thus key three instruction and
[17025] Who to meet of person
[17026] Space to habituate and manifest
[17027] Existence of upward space in
[17028] This itself two enter corner from

[17046] Thus
[17047] Eleven this of example
[17048] Letter na-ro like wing two gather through of na-ro one accomplish like
