[17638] Path time naturally-clear through of Dharmakaya liberation-doing through of action doing on
[17639] Three-kayas that through of purifying and pure-basis action do
[17640] Five word-entering cause-reason
[17641] From-beginning dust and separate and stain that-pure and
[17642] Circumstance self in exist though face not-know through of secret Dharma as exist and
[17643] Final-meaning aim seeking fruit as exist Dharma through of Dharmakaya word express just
[17644] Meaning second mind and jnana difference on two
[17645] Essence briefly-shown and
[17646] Each own-nature extensively-explained
[17647] First is
[17648] Pearl garland from
[17649] Mind and jnana distinction
[17650] Scholars through of know should
[17651] Thus arise through of
[17652] Mind is
[17653] Root non-Awareness and equal-possessing stain possessing Dharma samsara self-same jnana sun obscuring through of cloud like
[17654] Jnana is
[17655] Dharmakaya and equal-possessing stain not-possess and mind recollection-thought together nonabiding sun like
[17656] That same from
[17657] Mind is latencies all basis
[17658] Embodied beings stain
[17659] Grasp object on hold mind
[17660] That reason samsara Dharma-nature
[17661] Thus and
[17662] Again
[17663] Jnana recollection-basis itself and separate
[17664] Thus
[17665] Six-expanse from also
[17666] Mind and jnana self essence not-distinguish if
[17667] Sun cloud-masses through of obscured and like outer appearance meaning do impossible thus
[17668] That-also mind
[17669] Karma and afflictions and latencies all basis and source and accumulate-do and all from arise and
[17670] Non-Awareness house in always abide through of jnana sun and oppose and obscure
[17671] Self-arisen from
[17672] Mind is latencies all gather
[17673] Mind is afflictions all accumulate
[17674] Mind is latencies all basis
[17675] Latencies that also cut difficult through of
[17676] Self appearance obscure do
[17677] Nescience equal as abide through of
[17678] Thus and
[17679] Mu-tig string from
[17680] Mind indeed gather-assembly arise through of purpose
[17681] Defilement itself and also coat through of
[17682] Alaya gather through of mind to etcetera
[17683] Defilement through of number as become through of indeed
[17684] Thus
[17685] That-also Rigpa to obstruct-do mind that exist as possess through of sentient beings called
[17686] Mind that through of karma accumulate through of delusion itself delusion one from one to samsara through of karma do
[17687] Mind that Rigpa from liberate
[17688] Pure exhausted purify if Buddha called
[17689] Rigpa defilement and free through of purpose
[17690] That through of from free-object defilement through of assembly true indeed
[17691] Mind only indeed
[17692] That itself from
[17693] Mind that free if Buddha
[17694] Body-possess all through of defilement exhausted
[17695] Migrate beings indeed mind that through of migrate
[17696] That not-if migrate as able is nonexistent
[17697] That purpose migrate delusion-wheel like
[17698] Thus
[17699] Mind that also object appear this and this called symbol and name and universal grasp through of grasp object through of mind and
[17700] That through of distinction to investigate and detail as analyze grasp through of subject through of mind two as gather indeed
[17701] Grasp object to grasp mind
[17702] Thus explain indeed
[17703] These need from common gi text from also
[17704] Mind cease that body through of directly do
[17705] Thus and
[17706] Tshig-gsal-to
[17707] Mind and mind from arise through of enter also continuous break and
[17708] Dkon-mchog pile from
[17709] Mind and mind and consciousness and also free
[17710] Samadhi through of abode also not-abandon
[17711] This indeed tathagata through of heart through of secret thought through of not-fathomable called
[17712] Pristine-awareness indeed
[17713] Space like elaboration cease and Buddha through of Dharma measureless through of ground and source wheel pristine awareness ocean through of assembly and together chos-kaya through of home in always abide through of affliction and habit through of thicket all burn through of fire like abide
