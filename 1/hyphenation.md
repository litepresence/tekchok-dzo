# Hyphenation Patterns for Theg mchog mdzod
# Derived from Tibetan grammatical structure

## CORE PRINCIPLE
Hyphenated compounds preserve Tibetan grammatical relationships and the nondual view.
When two concepts are intrinsically linked in Tibetan, they remain hyphenated in English.

## NEVER HYPHENATED (Separate Words)

### Distinct Concepts
- awareness (rig pa) - standalone term
- mind (sems) - standalone term
- wisdom (ye shes/jnana) - standalone term
- compassion (snying rje) - standalone term
- emptiness (stong pa nyid) - standalone term
- clarity (gsal ba) - standalone term
- appearance (snang ba) - standalone term

### Verbal Phrases
- from the beginning (gdod ma nas)
- in the nature of (rang bzhin du)
- through the power of (dbang gis)

## CONTEXT-DEPENDENT

### With Particles
When Tibetan grammatical particles (kyis, las, gi) connect concepts,
the hyphenation shows the dependency:

**Example:**
- rang bzhin gyi ye shes → self-nature's wisdom (possessive)
- rang bzhin du gnas → abiding as self-nature (adverbial)

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing literal layer:
- [ ] All rang bzhin compounds hyphenated
- [ ] All sku (body) compounds hyphenated
- [ ] ka dag and lhun grub hyphenated
- [ ] Verbs remain unhyphenated
- [ ] Particles rendered separately with slashes

## NOTES

1. The hyphen represents the inseparability of concepts in Tibetan grammar
2. Over-hyphenation obscures meaning; under-hyphenation loses grammatical precision
3. When in doubt, consult the Tibetan: if it's a single conceptual unit, hyphenate
