2. **Visitors rotate:** New masters enter as text progresses
3. **Early chapters (1-2):** Primordial and early Tibetan voices
4. **Middle chapters (3-4):** Philosophical and analytical voices enter
5. **Later chapters (5-8):** Practice and devotional voices
6. **Late chapters (9-14):** Modern and completion voices

9. **Grand finale:** Final chapters have maximum voice variety

This expanded 9-core model creates:
- **Enhanced Continuity** (more core voices = richer texture)
- **Greater Variety** (18 visitors rotating)
- **Philosophical Depth** (Systematizer, Integrator, Precision)
- **Surprise** (new voices entering)
- **Return** (familiar voices coming back)
