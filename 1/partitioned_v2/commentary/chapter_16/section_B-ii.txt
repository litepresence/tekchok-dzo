Hear this, you who seek to purify! [9305-9327] The second Wisdom Pouring doctrine's nature is realizing rigpa's potency power perfected from the start. The three faculties' different realizations: From that same text—"When Wisdom Pouring's doctrine arises, again excellent middling lesser persons' views arise threefold. Excellent one's view realizes empowerment itself as unborn result, self-established. Meditation: through wisdom's application expanding bindus, great bliss space-equal meditation unmoved. Conduct: bodhicitta white-red without pure impure. Result: seeing buddha families' suchness."
[9328-9341] Middling faculty's view realizes display becoming rigpa's power. Meditation: unmoving clarity like sun and moon connected. Conduct: correctly abiding in dharmata yoga conduct. Result: attaining unborn suchness. Lesser faculty's view realizes empowerment's qualities expanding. Meditation: relying on deity body with marks. Conduct: acting in dharmata's play. Result: attaining buddhahood through qualities.
[9342-9371] The third Thigle Seeing Aperture doctrine's nature: bardo's self-arisen wisdom rigpa realizing own display's seeing as self-rigpa, thus awakening. Differentiated by person's faculty: From that—"When Thigle Seeing Aperture's doctrine dawns, excellent middling lesser have three different seeing aspects. Excellent view: like meteors racing in sky, wisdom potency arising as qualities, realizing liberation in three instants. Meditation: like sun rising in space, clarity all-pervasive. Conduct: enjoying wisdom body's pure forms. Result: in three instants, buddha in kadag ground."
[9372-9402] Middling view: realizing dharmata's great bliss unexcelled clear display increasing. Meditation: each instant seeing superior objects, superior realization arising each instant, seeing dharma body displays each instant, abiding in heart's suchness pure meditation. Conduct: own heart's light-ray non-dual enjoyment. Result: seeing rigpa's display as unborn dharma body. Lesser view: realizing pure wisdom display, thinking 'from there I arose' or 'I arose from there.' Meditation: abiding in that display without seer. Conduct: possessing doubt and uncertainty conduct. Result: attaining natural emanation body's pure land.
Emaho!
Listen carefully to the fourth doctrine! [9315-9332] Sun Moon Equal Measure doctrine's nature: realizing appearance-emptiness exhaustion-equal non-duality. Differentiated by faculty: From Tsal Dzog—"When Sun Moon Equal Measure's doctrine overflows, excellent middling lesser have three seeing aspects. Excellent view realizes wisdom zangthal. Meditation: inseparable from unceasing wisdom river. Conduct: great wisdom conduct playing ceaselessly. Result: attainment of method-wisdom joining, two liberations—four aspects without separation."
[9333-9341] Middling three aspects: view realizes method-wisdom non-dual. Meditation: abiding in method-wisdom's nature like sun-moon in space. Conduct: enjoying great bliss secret bindu white-red. Result: attaining buddha families' five joining practice womb buddhahood. Lesser three aspects: view realizes father-mother joining bodhicitta lake-symbol view. Meditation: deity's nature essence remembered, abiding in clear samadhi. Conduct: enjoying five medicines, five nectars. Result: attaining pure display result, intermediate state taking yidam deity's illusory body.
[9342-9371] The fifth Ocean Depths Opening doctrine's nature: abiding in equal-pure dharmata natural potency spontaneous meditation. Differentiated by faculties: From Tsal Dzog—"When Ocean Depths Opening's doctrine, excellent middling lesser have three seeing aspects. Excellent view: whatever appears is own display—realizing great wisdom's activity. Meditation: less attachment to displays, like being intoxicated with alcohol. Conduct: acting in samsara and nirvana. Result: attaining wisdom arising one-pointedly without abiding in displays."
[9372-9384] Middling three aspects: view realizes clarity zangthal wisdom body. Meditation: having forceful short duration like waterfall. Conduct: possessing non-common conduct like deer-conduct. Result: attaining final certainty, reaching wisdom essence. Lesser three aspects: view wishes to abandon deluded display gradually. Meditation: abiding in god and human mind-holding. Conduct: possessing artificial dualistic grasping conduct. Result: attaining god and human status. These five doctrines bind all Secret Heart Essence yogins—Mountain Summit for view, Wisdom Pouring for ground, Thigle for examining liberation, Sun Moon for carrying to exhaustion, Ocean for carrying to kadag ground.
Emaho!
Now hear the fivefold completion! [9385-9395] From Sengé Tsal Dzogchen: "Mountain Summit Gathering doctrine is like lion's playful posture. Wisdom Pouring doctrine is like royal empowerment at the crown. Thigle Seeing Aperture doctrine is like peacock chick hatching from egg. Sun Moon Equal Measure doctrine is like sun and moon non-dually entering. Ocean Depths Opening doctrine is like sun rising from Meru's neck."
[9396-9412] Thus each of these five supplications differentiated by three faculties makes fifteen, each with view-meditation-conduct-result fourfold makes sixty dharmas—purifying kalpa's evolution-devolution, sentient beings' afflictions, and views' sixty variations, showing pure nature through practicing wisdom. The Sugata Vajradhara spoke thus. From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle: "Lhungrub Thodgal wisdom practice key point certainty, the twenty-first chapter." Thus having taught practice methods through guidance, now extensively explaining how to practice through introduction, in two parts: general introduction's sequence establishing all dharmas, and particular differentiation extensively explaining mind and wisdom's symbols.
[9413-9428] First has preliminaries and main introduction: preliminaries are preparing a retreat house half-open with sunlight's rays, crystal mirror stainless—a preliminary. From the Introduction Ornament Tantra: "The retreat place half-open, hole with sun's rays, mirror clear showing, light display seen outward." There, through Vajrasattva heart mirror's symbol introduction showing previous occurrence, in this Jambudvipa, from the Turning Samsara's Wheel Jewel Secret Tantra: "Holder of five buddhas' lineage, crystal stupa five-tiered, five wisdoms' nature, five sky-lineage holder, spreading in unseen sky, unmixed colors individually clear."
[9429-9455] Essence, nature, compassion three—essence unceasing pure base, nature five great elements, compassion showing form bodies. From Vajra Space mandala, natural spontaneously accomplished body, five wisdoms possessing moon-water body, unclear-clear self-nature, crystal stupa five-tiered, descended to Vajradhara's left. Three aspects of sound-form, entering the corner of southeast, night direction day-like. Wisdom placed at right corner, alone certain buddha seen. Wisdom special insight is buddhas' sole intention. Nectar tongue meets meaning, rigpa's cuckoo one voice. Unchanging vajra body supreme, advice tikka corner-going, Vajrasattva's testament.
Emaho!

Now introduction give having experience how take sequence extensive explain-in two: introduction general sequence-by Dharma all establish-and, that distinction determine having mind-and wisdom indicate example extensive explain!
First-in introduction precede go-and: introduction actual two! First: dwelling direction half sun light-ray-with together crystal stain without prepare! Introduction ornament tantra-from: dwelling direction half-to, aperture sun light-ray possess! Clear make mirror extend having-by, light appear outside come see—thus!
That-to Vajra-Mind mirror example introduction previously arise demonstrate, teacher blessing-from!
Emaho! Introduction to the mirror-like awareness!
[9413-9455] Listen here, dear practitioner! Jambu continent this-in arise manner: Samsara Dong-Sprug precious secret tantra-from! Buddha five lineage hold, crystal stupa thousand-span five!

Thus the teachings spread for beings' benefit—know this, practitioner! All these descendings are for you, right now, in your own heart-mandala! Stop looking elsewhere!
Emaho! The descent of Vajra-Holder's blessing!
Now understand delusion and liberation! [9617-9633] Wisdom body entered body's hollow, holding fourfold rigpa heart abiding, and pervading all sentient beings—shown. This is natural delusion-mode introduction. Delusion condition-arisen like crystal light, various things appearing like crystal light, appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal, inexhaustible increase-decrease absent like crystal light—understand these and properly join sign-meaning.
[9634-9665] Sentient beings' liberation mode sign-meaning: From Blazing Lamp—"Base itself ripens result, knowing wisdom. Wisdom ripens as body, essence dharma body that, ripens as wisdom dharma body." From heart five wisdoms three-tiered, liver wind and wisdom's resonance two meeting, potency-mind arising, potency-base dissolving unmoving abiding example. Inner light outer-radiating white mind example. Sixth called mind. Five lights wisdom example. Base-holding rigpa. Mind and wisdom two example introduction thus established. Intermediate state introduction sound-light-ray three, Vajrasattva's inner channel-vein root introduction and so forth—on crystal establish certain knowledge, join yogin's face and knowledge, make certain and practice.
[9666-9696] Liberation result mode: though inner-clear kadag liberation base self-arisen essence body clear, outer-clear five lights and white two mixed introduction, this having wisdom is crucial. Path wisdom or those wishing no wisdom, Madhyamaka extreme non-abiding, or us Dzogchen kadag no wisdom wishers—even if delusion purified from root, two bodies unceased arising, wisdom must exist in expanse. Five lights white mixed is mirror wisdom; white separately arising is sambhogakaya emanating nirmanakaya example. These are two purities possessing all aspects knowing buddhahood introduction.
[9697-9713] Buddhas' parinirvana means sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya dissolving into dharmakaya—crystal sun's condition separated, original base kadag held unmoving unconfused abiding, essence inseparable thus ka-liberation, yet through recognizing-not recognizing difference, all as wisdom body alone abiding is called all-knowing. Especially wisdom two-possessing. Inner-clear existing carries to exhaustion ground, primordial person's universal base self-arisen essence body inseparable.
Emaho!
Listen, you who would hold the unconfused ground! [9714-9733] Yet like sun obscured by clouds, liberation recognizing own face, freed from all obscurations, realization manifest, original base and final liberation ground extremely different—this crucial point wise ones should know. Wisdom expanse swirling like crystal light, dharmakaya clear dawning like crystal itself. That self-recognized dharmakaya abiding in own bed, now wishing to hold unconfused ground, naturally clear directly zangthal great expanse clarity hrik freshness non-distracted sustaining is crucial. From Protector of Beings Glorious Sublime Lama's mouth: "Self-recognized dharmakaya own bed itself, wishing to hold unconfused ground whoever exists, all without error unconfused non-distracting doing is crucial, knowing like ocean meditation wise ones should know."
[9734-9756] Thus well spoken. At this introduction time, relaxed, self also newly certain uncommon produced, showing others. Again World Sun Dharma Lord Lama's mouth: "Introductions gradually introduced, well cared for. Alala, Olala, what is this without parts? Not introduced, not unintroduced, don't do, non-dharma action don't claim. Don't cling to delusion, don't hold lama's name doing non-dharma bad actions, name meaning must accord."
[9757-9780] Thus advised, future times entering this dharma should place thus in heart. Second point particular differentiation explaining sentient beings and wisdom's symbols extensively in two: root rigpa's deluded returning mode mind's introduction, and rigpa self-display possessing self-display wisdom introduction. First: from Introduction Ornament—"Emaho! Appearance as mind introduction, mind's arriving mode. Mind itself empty introduction, emptiness bliss expansion reached. Empty as rigpa introduction, rigpa itself expanse wisdom non-dual."
[9781-9806] Here three: outer object key point establishing inner mind, inner mind key point establishing secret expanse, secret expanse key point establishing unsurpassed rigpa. First has showing appearance object baseless delusion, and showing appearance holder own mind empty two. First: outer various displays red-blue container-contained five elements' expanse clear, these to own mind deluded face appearing, except external objects' things and inner mind's things both unrealized, baseless empty miracle non-existent clear appearance nature, like cataract sufferer's hair-falls and dream magical display.
Emaho!
Listen, dear practitioner! Look here at this precious crystal teaching [9538-9584]! Just as a crystal is pure by nature, clear inside and out without obstruction, so is the dharmakaya - the true nature of your own mind!
The crystal's inner light represents prajna, the life-force wisdom, while the outer clear light shows how emanation bodies arise. Do you see? The crystal itself demonstrates the ground wisdom, the primordial nature that abides unchanged!
Like a crystal reflecting all colors yet remaining pure and empty, your own awareness recognizes all appearances while itself remaining unstained. The lamp arrangements from the tantra show this directly - through example, through signs, through meaning itself!
Samantabhadra's appearance is like a mirror, dear one! When you look into a clear mirror, what do you see? Your own face! So too when you look into the nature of mind - you see the face of your own primordial wisdom, clear and unobstructed!
Do not seek elsewhere! The crystal-like rigpa is already present, spontaneously abiding, non-ceasing, without direction. This is the direct introduction to your own nature. Recognize it now!
Through example you understand the meaning. Through signs you gain confidence. Through deciding the essence, the three primordial wisdoms established in the base ripen as fruit. Without seeking, you see the result yourself!
Emaho!
Listen well, fortunate one! The five lights appear outwardly to the eye, yet their nature is clear light from within [9585-9616]! Like white light demonstrating compassion inseparable from itself - this is how the three kayas abide as one bindu!
Look here! When sunlight strikes a crystal, rays extend outward, yet the light arises from the crystal itself. So too does base-appearances arise from the base - but because of non-recognition, ignorance arises as knowable obscuration!
Samantabhadra transcends the base through wisdom's sense power! In a single moment, distinctions separate; in a single moment, complete Buddhahood! Before all Buddhas, like a great grandfather, already enlightened!
Dear practitioner, understand this: Buddhas without cause, without beginning or end, with a single wisdom eye unstained! The liberation base of Samantabhadra is demonstrated here. When you recognize base-appearance as it arises, you are liberated!
Yet sentient beings do not recognize their own appearances as self-appearances. Like various colored cloths placed over a crystal, like white light appearing as various colors - so does awareness arise as various delusions through the habit-continuum of rising and sleeping!
Do not be confused! These appearances are your own wisdom's display. Recognize them directly, without grasping. Rest in the nature as it is!
Emaho!
Hear the summary of introductions! [9952-9972] From that: "All buddhas' measure holder, example wisdoms examine. Sign wisdom measure holder, empty bindu lamp examine. Meaning wisdom measure holder, direct clear display examine." Briefly summarized: outer display object baseless, holding that appearance mind empty introduction, samsara delusion certain non-existent one knowing, that insufficient, root rigpa's meaning direct introduction, expanse rigpa non-separation introduction, carry to kadag's dharmakaya—this advice for supreme excellent ones.
[9973-9991] Second, self-display wisdom introduction has two: object faculties' differentiation and introduction sequence. First: excellent middling lesser three faculties seven each makes twenty-one. These also wisdom, training, liberation different. First excellent means wisdom and realization aspect. Differentiated seven: excellent's lesser, excellent's middling, excellent's excellent, excellent's supreme, excellent's best, excellent's peak, excellent's completion. These established from easy realization self-display. Middling also seven: middling's lesser, middling's middling, middling's excellent, middling's supreme, middling's best, middling's peak, middling's completion.
[9992-10016] Thus lesser also seven: lesser's lesser, lesser's middling, lesser's excellent, lesser's best, lesser's peak, lesser's peak held. Second: thus twenty-one faculties arising, twenty-one introductions arise. These too each introduction has two: common differentiation and special showing method. First: light and wisdom rigpa three, seven-group introduction: from Vajrasattva heart mirror tantra—"Rigpa strayed from base, entering path should know, example meaning introduction etc., twenty-one introductions should know."
[10017-10041] Snow or salt or ocean arisen crystal stainless, window light held, five colors light spontaneously arise. What are these? Blue, white, yellow, red, green. Crystal one following person, own right eye right hand held, placed above eye, display seen. Left hand left eye close. This is example introduction. Meaning thus abides in own heart center. This is meaning introduction.
Emaho!
Attend to the signs and examples! [10042-10072] Sign own finger pressing eye, light bindu moon-eye-like arises. This sign introduction. Dharmakaya introduction: face to sun mandala. Sambhogakaya introduction: thus-gone body painted cloth placed before self, crystal eye above placed, eye gazing at sky, sambhogakaya body with face ear seen. Similarly sambhogakaya pure land intermediate state arising know.
[10073-10102] Nirmanakaya introduction: dharma-possessing marks appearing own rigpa's miracle know. Day own light-ray's heap know. This is mind's habitual patterns hollow not abandoned knowing. This is nirmanakaya introduction. Channel root method appearance natural mode arising introduction. Thus seven aspects called light introduction. What is wisdom introduction? Dharmadhatu wisdom introduction examining metal bowl's essence: bowl well water-filled, clear showing mirror placed above eye, looking, bindu and atomic form arise. From that light and weapon-point-like radiate. This dharmadhatu wisdom introduction.
[10103-10132] Mirror-like wisdom introduction: silver mirror two between mandala powder-drawn, edge near each side mirror one each placed. From that two displays arise. Equality wisdom introduction: water moon determination. Discriminating wisdom introduction: butter lamp determination. Accomplishing wisdom introduction: crystal stainless determination. Non-abiding wisdom introduction: sky rainbow determination. Completely perfect wisdom introduction: cloudless sky determination. These seven wisdom introduction.
[10133-10162] Now showing rigpa's introduction: rigpa youth vase body introduction: white-clothed unstained person placed before self, jewel above eye placed, eye sky-raised looking, thus-gone peaceful body seen. This rigpa youth vase body introduction. Rigpa youth hero powerful body introduction: black house black unstained black-clothed placed before, as above looking, thus-gone wrathful body seen. Rigpa base-abiding introduction: clear ocean determination. Rigpa all-clear introduction: sun moon determination. Rigpa non-dual introduction: vase body determination.
Emaho!
See the complete introductions! [10163-10186] Rigpa with stain introduction: sun moon cloud-covered like determination. Rigpa not abiding anywhere introduction: eye mid-space gazing know. Thus seven rigpa introduction. Thus twenty-one completed, that person parinirvana time, rigpa from eye channel arising enters intermediate state's display. Second point special showing method has two: introduction's summary brief showing, and nature extensive differentiation. First: light and wisdom introduction seven establishes lesser faculties' certainty symbol. Body and thigle introduction seven establishes middling ones' light essence certainty. Rigpa and expanse introduction seven establishes excellent ones' certainty.
[10187-10206] From Introduction Ornament: "Twenty-one gradually introduction, light and wisdom itself, introduction seven aspects, lesser seven liberated. Body and thigle itself too, introduction seven aspects, middling seven's meaning. Rigpa and expanse seven, excellent ones' meaning."
[10207-10232] Second, three aspects: light and wisdom introduction seven: wisdom's self-light expanse moved display five lights clear self-light introduction. From that outer-clear arising expanse's wisdom display introduction. Mirror-like etc. five self-display knowing introduction. Between connecting thread ray display. Three bodies connected display. Clear light wisdom self-display display. Powder mother-son measure. Person wisdom inner-essence display—seven introductions.
[10233-10258] Second, thigle and body introduction seven: thigle five wisdoms' display pure thigle display five, metal bowl essence thigle self-introduction. Cloth cloth wisdom light display introduction. Swirling water first intermediate state display introduction. Peacock mirror meditation introduction. Staff metal bowl great bliss Brahma's door display thigle nine stacked introduction.
[10259-10283] Body has two: rigpa youth vase body, youth frowning body. These too half-body, self-isolated, heap mandala, bodhisattva, consort, father-mother pair connection appearing introduction five exist, peaceful wrathful two bodies family gathered thus seven. Third, rigpa and expanse introduction seven: rigpa introduction two—three bodies non-dual introduction, father-mouth jaw joining emanating introduction, rigpa body matured introduction.
Emaho!
Hear the expanse introductions! [10284-10306] Expanse introduction five: wisdom wind moved expanse display introduction. Five families cloth display expanse wisdom introduction. Expanse's ornament net and half-net hanging palace introduction. Window four directions center five rigpa five display mirror held showing expanse body introduction. Vessel water-filled flower five heap similarly held showing expanse heap introduction—seven. These too introduction time ganachakra and feast materials excellent arranged, clothes and dwelling place proper care.
[10307-10331] From Introduction Ornament Tantra: "Then fortunate followers, for seeing own essence, retreat place half-open, hole sun-rays possessing, clear showing mirror held, five lights outer arising seen. Eye above skilled one places, self-light clear outer also seen. Follower left corner each one looking, between connecting thread ray display seen. Or eye above light placed, again one looking at one, three bodies connected aspect also seen. Butter lamp essence itself that looks, wisdom clear self-own face meets."
[10332-10358] "Skilled one powder edge mirror two, clear eye supreme method looks, rigpa mother-son measures meeting, dharmata non-mother measures know. Khampa's reflection hollow sense door open, inner butter lamp placed wisdom door held. Metal bowl water-filled good inside look, thigle itself self-introduction is. Cloth white-red spread, clear possessing eye looks, wisdoms' lights self-face meet. Ocean pool or swirling water's edge, clear possessing eye looks, light heap sky-filling, first intermediate state display certainty establishes."
[10359-10385] "Peacock mirror itself garlanded, clear taking eye looks, thigle light possessing seeing, wisdom meditation itself face meets. Staff metal bowl hundred arranged on head, clear possessing as above looks, thigle nine stacked Brahma's meaning introduction. Five families reflections board placed, clear possessing as above looks, sky expanse itself form body, display itself experience meditation. Ornamented person before placed, clear possessing eye looks, light body going-coming ray possessing, that seeing sambhogakaya self-isolated display. Rigpa youth vase body called. Again no-display house in, person black color well-ornamented, before as above placed, clear possessing eye looks, wrathful body fearsome reflection sky going-coming signs possessing seen. Sambhogakaya wrathful body essence shown."
Emaho!
