[7491-7502] 
"Also not by such pacification. Without knowing direct superior seeing, like Mount Meru king of mountains—who can destroy it? Not liberated by antidote. Without knowing self-pure without searching, like muddy water wanting clear—clearing again and again, not cleared. Even clear, not dharmata. Without knowing self-appearance loose, like ordinary foolish appearance—apprehending grasping not reversed."
Know the key of self-liberation by itself like water's wave!
[7503-7532] 
Here also two mind-levels: self-liberation with effort—when affliction arises, recognizing and placing in own place, self-liberated dissolved in nature of pure place, never distracted instant in great equal self-liberation, training dynamic display.
Effortless: whatever arises cannot stand, self-dissolved dharmata, so method of viewing abandons without abandoning, liberated by nature flow or force.
From that same text: "These mind-levels two: with effort and effortless. With effort placed in own place, appearance familiarized measure. Wisdom-pure appearance itself. When outer inner all self-dawn, not born from conditions. However these arise, placed in own place self-liberated. Therefore yogin of appearance. Effortless like this: self-liberated by itself to itself..."
Emaho! Self-liberation without searching or achieving!
[7533-7537] 
"Whoever meets this, even with uninterrupted sins, liberated by familiarizing this—doubtless, narak."
[7538-7542] 
Second: particular explanation of primordial liberation's dharmata has three: showing no need for effort-antidotes because primordially liberated now self-liberated; instruction not departing from dharmata's nature; resting without ever experiencing going elsewhere from basis-free self-dissolution.
[7543-7581] 
From Pearl Garland: "Not liberated by effort, primordially liberated from the start."
Also: "Ignorance itself self-arisen, delusion's cause primordially Buddha. All-ground dharmakaya self-dawn, cut transmission's birth from root. Wish-fulfilling intention primordially abides, changers are self-placed. Breath primordially continuous, birth and death primordially nonexistent. Desires' objects primordially complete, grasping's extreme is meditation itself. Limbs unmoved primordially transcended, beings' path primordially traversed. Speech expressed inexpressible, primordially beyond speech and thought. Thought's dispersion primordially empty, primordially abides great meditation. Stains self-pure, abides great stainless wide-open. From no place of doing, from first free from activity-doing. From ground no arising, primordially self-arisen alone..."
Emaho! Primordially complete, nothing to do!
[7583-7617] 
From Tal 'Gyur: "Great Perfection nature's extreme: phenomena placed in own place. Appearance-awareness dharmata unified, primordial liberation just resting. Intention beyond mind; marked placed pure in own place; empty and existence extremes liberated; exhausted change without thought; mind-exhausted beyond thought."
From earlier: "Five elements primordially clear, appearance liberated in luminosity. Five senses naked placed, five grasping objects self-liberated in own place."
[7618-7627] 
Also from Tal 'Gyur: "Self-mind liberation called—gone one to one nowhere. Mind without liberator, complete from ground without coming-going. Not found by examination, no cause. Rootless ground abides empty-luminous. Self-clear abiding mind, liberated by key without partiality. Liberated by time without reference. Liberated without effort without diligence. Liberated by confidence without effort. Explained liberation by confidence. Primordially liberated without returning ground. Self-liberated by itself without antidote. Relaxed release, even seeing place, completely liberated effortless."
Three gates primordially liberated, so from first no need for effort-liberation. Body need not transform mudra, etc.—elements self-liberated by key, not returning to six realms. Speech need not effort heart-essence recitation, etc.—expression clear-pure liberated, speech self-liberated by sound-meaning key. Mind need not effort samadhi meditation, etc.—whatever thought liberated by intention key. Nothing arising from other, self-liberated—impossible to have antidote.
Emaho! Liberation without antidotes or effort!
[7628-7667] 
Liberation by just placing, liberation by just knowing key, primordial liberation, self-liberation, naked liberation, complete liberation, etc.—many, but here showing great self-liberation has no antidote, no effort needed.
Third: extensive explanation of self-liberation's intention has three: brief showing of essence; particular explanation of nature; conclusion of meaning.
From Pearl Garland: "To unceasing rigpa, no delusion cause so no return place. Primordially liberated, definitely transcended. Self-liberated, objects-conditions exhausted. Naked liberated, appearance pure. Extreme liberated, four extremes ceased. One liberated, multiplicity empty."
To nondual outer-inner wide-open rigpa—like crystal palace without stain—no ground key, no delusion cause, rootless rigpa without path. No path, no result-return place to three realms—primordially liberated like space, spontaneously complete intention.
Five great liberation modes, surpassing all common vehicles.
[7652-7671] 
Five: primordial liberation, self-liberation, naked liberation, extreme liberation, one liberation. First primordial liberation depending on no-return key, showing all view-meditation effort-dependence unnecessary.
Wisdom pervasive generally spread—no doing, no fabrication. Not arisen from anywhere, not gone anywhere, not abiding anywhere—unchanging meaning.
Liberation not like untying, so view-meditation effort unnecessary. Liberation called abiding in own system—no acceptance-rejection meaning.
Emaho! Five liberations transcending all vehicles!
[7672-7717] 
Like fruit of ali ka (eggplant) ripening from start—now no ripening cause.
Primordial liberation has three: understanding primordial liberation; establishing valid placement; liberation mode.
Understanding: not adventitious, liberated from first, now no liberating—key is rigpa itself never experienced delusion.
Establishing validity has three: reasoning validity; scripture validity; reason validity.
Reasoning: primordially rigpa itself liberated—no ground so no return; no root so no source; no characteristic so not established; unborn so no liberation cause.
Sign of primordial liberation: no characteristic seen by any meditation-accomplishment. Validated by cause-effect traceless reasoning—rigpa no stream, no result, karma and ripening impossible.
Scripture validity: from Meaningful Diligence—"Mind itself primordially liberated—how could outer liberation condition exist?"
Reason validity: established by release-relax-place reason—placing primordially liberated, self-liberated in own place, primordially liberated.
Also knowing primordially liberated by key of no source, no abiding, no going.
Liberation mode: called liberated because mind empty; or unliberated—merely conventional term—sign of primordially liberated.
Emaho! Primordially free, nothing to achieve!
[7718-7749] 
Liberated yet self-liberated. Like sky and clouds. Thus not like view-meditation conduct depending on other objects, with faults—"liberated by meaning" means dharma-exhausted.
Self-liberation has three: understanding self-liberation; establishing validity; liberation mode.
Understanding: no antidote meaning. Appearance itself self-liberated from appearance—no dharmata other than appearance. Similarly emptiness, etc.—nothing other than that itself liberating.
Like alcoholic cured by alcohol; poison destroyed by poison; iron cut by iron.
Afflictions liberated by that itself—called self-liberation.
Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.
Reasoning: dharmata's reasoning validates—all liberations are self-liberations, not other-untied. If other-liberated, like impossible one substance appearing as different forms. Like thing's characteristic established by thing.
Scripture: from Mind Section—"Liberation self-arisen, not from other."
Reasons: established by great self-liberation no-dispute reason.
Appearance self-liberated, no dependence on other antidote.
[7756-7777] 
Liberation mode: nothing other than self-liberated by itself. Whatever appears, appearance liberates itself. Whatever arises, liberation by that. Appearances manifold yet self-liberated equal, like waves and water. Clouds manifold yet sky equal. Even water and ice equal as water.
All liberations equal in equality—no hope for liberation, no fear of delusion, no trace.
Emaho! Self-liberation without other antidotes!
[7765-7781] 
No liberation cause or condition other than appearance. Liberated groundless—no abiding support, no root. Rootless mind itself—from Secret Heart: "This rootless mind itself—not male, not female, not neuter; not color, not shape; no mark, no class."
That itself no return place other than itself. No going place—never experienced birth. No arising place—nothing other than itself not self, called self-liberation.
Like snake's knot self-liberated without anyone untying.
[7782-7816] 
Third: naked liberation depending on seeing-release key, showing no dependence on tantra-scripture. Just by naked seeing, liberated in that—mother-child meeting liberation. Appearance itself unmixed by mind, uncut by appearance, placed—self-pure liberated.
Naked liberation seeing-release has four: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode; example.
Understanding: just by naked seeing, liberated in seeing that—first instant self-seen? Heard? Just by knowing—dharmata direct count reached!
Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.
Reasoning: no appearance mind-mixing, so basis-empty; empty-appearance equal; equal emptiness-appearance; awareness-appearance unseparated; equal-awareness; experience-liberation equal—so naked seeing.
Emaho! Liberated by naked seeing alone!
[7817-7840] 
Knowledge entering others doesn't arise. Scripture validates: from Golden Essence Tantra—"By naked liberation's great view, Buddhas and beings both liberated."
Reason: validated by free-from-directions self-pure reason. Thus appearance nakedly liberated—placed in naked place, liberated where placed, released where liberated.
Liberation mode: trained on particular objects, particularly nakedly liberated—gone nowhere, come from nowhere, no place to go. Not changing wherever abiding. Trained on general objects, all appearance gone to naked liberation.
Example: like sense-capable person going to temple—no viewing duality.
[7841-7870] 
Fourth: extreme liberation depending on freedom-from-reference key—reference not applicable anywhere. Liberated from one extreme, not abiding as two, liberated from two so not abiding as one. Similarly both, neither, etc.
Extreme: existence-extreme appearance, nonexistence-extreme non-appearance, both, neither—four extremes ceased called liberation.
Extreme liberation free-from-reference has three: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode.
Understanding: existence, nonexistence, appearance, emptiness extremes—reference inapplicable. Beyond this-is, this-isn't calculation.
Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.
Reasoning: validated by reference-free nature reasoning.
Emaho! Liberated from all extremes and references!
[7871-7917] 
From Great Dynamic Display Qualities Scripture: "Liberated by being free from extremes."
Reason: validated by one-known all-liberated reason. Knowing one free from extreme, thus appearance-concepts all liberated—no reference applicable anywhere.
Liberation mode: not abiding in existence extreme, liberated from nonexistence extreme. Not abiding in nonexistence extreme, liberated from existence extreme. Not abiding in both, liberated from both. Neither, liberated from neither.
[7887-7918] 
Fifth: one liberation depending on peerless key, showing method and wisdom not dependent. One is Great Perfection single thigle free from elaborations. Liberated in that nature, all multiplicities' extremes empty.
One liberation peerless key has four: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode; example.
Understanding: one liberation not invalid—nothing unrecognized from one liberated as one. Therefore rigpa beyond primordially liberated or not terminology.
Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.
Reasoning: all liberations not different—called liberation from one, nothing other. One itself is rigpa. Nothing other than self-knowing alone.
Scripture: from Golden Essence—"One alone liberated dharmata—multiplicity one taste."
Reasons: validated by one-known all-liberated. Knowing one as rigpa, all samsara-nirvana liberated.
Liberation mode: all appearance-awareness liberated by recognizing dharmata.
Emaho! One taste liberates all!
[7923-7933] 
Example: all salts' taste established, or molasses, or fire—knowing one knows all. From Bodhicitta Commentary: "Fire's nature hot, molasses' nature sweet—thus all dharmas' nature empty one."
[7932-7963] 
Thus five liberation modes not for one individual—by sense-faculty differences, whichever suitable liberates.
Third: five liberation modes' conclusion showing five: here five liberation modes free from reference—self-liberation free from object view-meditation-conduct dharma reference. Conditions liberated by conditions—like stain washed by stain, bad conditions liberated by bad, dawn as wisdom's companion.
Primordial purity liberated by primordial purity, rigpa liberated by rigpa.
Primordial liberation free from grasping-grasped unified reference—objects liberated by objects, like poison destroyed by poison.
Naked liberation not referencing samsara-nirvana—causes liberated by causes, like iron cut by iron.
Extreme liberation not referencing terminology words—dharmas liberated by dharmas, like wood-born fire burning that wood.
One liberation not referencing liberating mind—mind itself liberated by mind, like stone breaking stones.
From Pearl Garland: "Conditions liberated by conditions—I don't look at object dharmas. Objects liberated by objects—I don't look at grasping-grasped two. Causes liberated by causes—I don't look at samsara-nirvada two. Dharmas liberated by dharmas—I don't look at terminology words. Mind liberated by mind—I don't look at indicating mind..."
Emaho! Self-liberation in five modes!
[7965-7983] 
Self-liberated self-pacified vast expanse—from that same source: "Therefore ground-abiding rigpa, self-dawn thus appearance complete. Self-arisen thus ground itself complete. Self-appearance thus objects also complete. Self-liberated thus delusion-ground complete. Self-pure thus all paths complete. Self-knowing thus knowables complete. Self-pervasive thus result complete. Self-place thus cause-conditions complete. Self-realized thus dharmata complete. Self-reversed thus samsara-nirvana complete. Self-abiding thus tantra-scripture complete. Self-complete thus one-time complete. Self-aware thus instruction complete. Self-placed thus meditation complete. Self-nature thus expanse complete."
[7984-8012] 
Thus completed and liberated rigpa itself primordially pure from first, stainless. Heart, thus transmission exhausted. Single great bliss beyond speech-thought-expression. Primordially pure wide-open. Stone-enclosed pure emptiness. Generally appearing samsara-nirvana's fortune unmoved. Dharma-exhausted change-ceased beyond inanimate-animate. Abiding as natural ground-Buddha.
From Pearl Garland: "Emaho! Self-completed Great Perfection dharmakaya—pure from ka, stains exhausted. First arisen, transmission exhausted. Free from duality, beyond calculation. Suffering causeless, great bliss. Expression causeless, beyond speech-thought. Primordially self-aware pure. Exhausted overflow, not stone-enclosed. Exhausted things, abides empty. Both without increase, nature itself. Free from dharmas, beyond method. Unthought clear, change ceased."
Emaho! All completed in self-nature!
[8013-8037] 
Those abiding in meaning like sky rigpa—dharma-exhausted, appearance and body water-moon-like, unobstructed by walls and fences, obtain immeasurable eyes and superknowledges. Seeing noble truth, liberated from further existence.
Primordial purity ground liberation—four elements' particles powerless, burned by wisdom fire, like mist dissolving, showing body's miracle in sky. If meaningful, wisdom fire burns particles, blessing as relics and ringsels. If not meaningful, self-dissolves into peace, rigpa abides in dharmakaya expanse, form body with activities, benefiting beings until samsara not empty.
From Copper Letters and Signs Measures: "Appearance four measures not reached, yet stone-enclosed not appearing, primordial ground liberation exists."
Thus meaning clearly explained in khregs chod liberation manner, from Heap of Jewels Tantra: "Untransferred self-place placed mind—all these words too, no one trained, each mind understands appearing. This itself understood by own mind..."
[8038-8049] 
"...Inconceivable unthought, all appearances self-pure, all uncontrived spontaneous, become empty-luminous great rigpa's kind. Earth water fire wind four elements, each power not appearing, like mist dissolve for skilled. Delusion's various graspings, however thought unborn, grasping-grasped parts self-ceased, whatever not appearing self-exhausted. Clear-illuminator self-experienced, embodied all thus gone, disembodied needless to mention."
Emaho! Liberation into the natural state!
[8050-8060] 
When yogin's realization reaches measure, particles become partless, body stone-enclosed self-dissolves. Even slightly unreached, if surpassing others—even one srang heavy becomes light—rigpa dissolves into primordial purity.
Key point: from wide-open stone-enclosed pure rigpa nature's familiarization. Mind and its deluded appearance nonexistent, clear appearance aspect at that time self-pure in own face, mind and wisdom distinguished. Mind pure sees wisdom truth, mind bliss.
From Seng Ge Rtsal Rdzogs: "Seeing Buddha truth, Victor's child. Understanding thought, always bliss."
[8061-8082] 
From Treasury of Supreme Vehicle: "Again, showing instruction of liberating by excellent realization—nineteenth sequence."
Having definitely established khregs chod meaning, now extensive explanation of thod rgal's key for purifying stone-enclosed into light body has two: how surpassing khregs chod; and explanation of special thod rgal itself.
First: surpassing by seven specialties—appearance light specialty; practice method connection specialty; self-appearance direct seeing specialty; body key channel specialty; appearance-illuminator gate specialty; seeing faculty specialty; experience increase-appearing specialty.
First: khregs chod cannot purify outer deluded appearance's ground stones rocks, making objects, depending on intellectual imputation of illusion groundlessness, depending on mind's consciousness collection dharmas, quickly not liberating.
Thod rgal makes five lights expanse rigpa appearance as object, no need for intellectual imputation of deluded appearance's namelessness, mind's dharma eye consciousness etc. self-ceased, training...
Emaho! Thod rgal's swift path of light!
[8083-8102] 
Turns to nameless samsara. Life that light-liberates is special. From Tal 'Gyur: "This from showing own object, conditions not entering—wide-open spontaneous, from object-knowing appearance aspect, each directly liberated from own ground."
What difference since khregs chod also explained body-liberated from aggregates without appearance measure? Great difference! Khregs chod liberates but from partless particles, cannot go to light. Without going to light, vajra body not established—occasional illusion body not cut by ultimate. Without obtaining light body, great transference body not obtained, others' benefit great support not established.
From light and particle dissolving aspect, great transference meaning not done, eyes, superknowledges, miracles—great small difference exists.
[8103-8125] 
Second: Rigpa primordially said luminous, khregs chod measures emptiness, not seeing own light. Thod rgal pressing key, dharmata nature's luminosity inwardly held, objects' self-dawn luminosity outwardly appearing shown in method—surpasses.
From Self-Arising: "This self-appearance rigpa king—all have, unrecognized."
Third: Rigpa's wisdom khregs chod not-viewable, covered, not seen, decisively cut as one. Thod rgal opens wisdom's expanse, dharmata's sun rays clear.
From Tal 'Gyur: "Dharmata directly appearing, destroys intellectual apprehending view."
Fourth: Khregs chod depending on coarse channel-winds, thod rgal holding light channel essence, placing lamp on actual path.
From that: "Also channels and delusion wheels, nature-appearing five wisdoms..."
Emaho! Seven specialties of thod rgal!
[8126-8163] 
Khregs chod from six faculties' unpurified gates, seeking clarity in mind's dharmas. Thod rgal pure light-luminous gate, wisdom wind urged, four lamps' appearance dawns—surpasses.
From that: "How from gate arising, entering wind urges, from four lamps four activities arise."
Sixth: Khregs chod looking in rigpa self-clear faculty, seeking clarity. Thod rgal outer-inner wisdom wide-open faculty, expanse and wisdom meeting-free appearance, actually analyzing—special.
From Tal 'Gyur: "Pure expanse lamp, thigle body and deluded appearance, nature itself and own-nature, nondual meeting-free appearing."
Seventh: Khregs chod making outer objects inner mind delusion appear, accepting-rejecting-free increase, quickly not liberating. Thod rgal from moment with key, outer-inner deluded appearance with delusion-grasping self-dissolved, not abandoned in-place pure increase not depending.
Wisdom increase-appearing like waxing moon, above increasing, appearance four measures reached, quickly liberating.
From that: "Appearance mode not delusion, pure nature cause-conditions, existent nonexistent self-pure, five gates object-grasping pure, arising coarse pure, wisdom pure increase-appearing shows, from that exhausted dharmata."
These specialties if analyzed finely inconceivable, summarized spoken. Know great difference by wisdom eye possessing!
Emaho! Thod rgal's direct seeing!
[8165-8194] 
Second meaning showing special thod rgal itself has three: general showing three-key dharmata wheel; particular explanation of day-night luminous wheel; extensive showing meaning expanse wisdom wheel.
First has four: body three keys; gate three keys; expanse three keys; object three keys.
First: body's three postures however suitable, inner relaxed with purpose of channel-wind abiding pleasant. If deliberately restrained, wind etc. reverses and pervades, channels contract and over-tighten.
With gaze, when wind key very loose, outwardly held expelled from mouth—this special dharma key great crucial point.
Also nose exhaling-inhaling is common method—filling four wheels, generating mind clear samadhi. That method has wind reverse, pervade, swirl, dull—four obstacles arise, deluded appearance not dawning.
Here not making wind purification increase path, four wheels inwardly filled, mind all-thoughts ceasing but not completely ceasable, so action wind self-ceased expelled from mouth.
Nose taste-pure enters, then all four wheels' channels enter, different thoughts moving horse—here blocked, mouth and throat connected, throat channels hollow pipe's inside mind horse self-ceased expelled.
Wind mouth slowly outwardly drawn, held as long as abiding, horse and person each separate, person heart-inside rigpa dissolves, unthought meditation natural-flow achieved.
Emaho! Body keys for thod rgal!
[8195-8223] 
Wind gathering obstacle, mind unhappy; affliction thought movement; heart stabbing—all cleared! At those times, forcefully expelling is supreme key.
Not knowing this wind key, even meditating, appearance increase and signs measures certainly won't arise.
Second: seeing gate three keys—any gaze posture done, not restrained by effort, inner relaxed natural flow made. Eyes unmoving, gaze pressing is key.
From Tal 'Gyur: "Distant placement unmoving is key. This time three gazes combined."
Third: expanse three keys for guiding—eyes slowly corners and up-down, expanse appearance gap, eyes unmoving, knowing unmoved, placed in clear-emptiness.
From that: "Expanse key is guiding."
From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Dharmata memory awakened sky, five masses appearing golden garuda hovering. Apprehending grasping thought-extreme free manner soaring. Self-appearance direction-fall-free sky, empty-luminous elaboration-free garuda hovering. Appearance without apprehending manner soaring..."
[8224-8250] 
Fourth: outer object sky cloud-dissolved placed, rigpa clear-awake, appearance increase fast. Inner object expanse lamp placed, light-mother-child connected. Secret object rigpa self-clear placed, primordial purity dharma-exhausted intention self-place clear key.
From Self-Arising: "Sky empty mandala, uncontrived four lamps, unceased meaning clear. Rigpa expanse lamp, sky empty expanse center, expanse nature light body..."
Emaho! Object keys for light meditation!
[8251-8266] 
From Tal 'Gyur: "This object key like this: cloud-free outer object empty, yogin sky bird path abides. Not separate from this dharmata."
Also: "Object appearing characteristic: sky blue limitless, light and color shape, five wisdoms self-appearing showing. Pure expanse lamp, thigle body and deluded appearance, nature itself and own-nature, nondual meeting-free appearing."
[8267-8302] 
At this time, channels-inside wind moves, subtle thoughts sha-ra-ra arise, but no harm to direct meaning. Thoughts themselves cannot stand by themselves, liberated going along—like falcon catching prey flying. Scattered objects disperse, but unlike before chain link continuing, no distraction.
Karma and latencies not accumulated. Light meditation not destroyed. Dynamic display entered, wisdom spontaneously born, opening opportunity.
Gaze posture restrained, thick thoughts self-ceased; thin subtle thoughts all self-liberated.
From Tal 'Gyur: "Intention unmoved from one. Appearance appearance's immediate clear, like face and mirror. Liberation that and that itself liberated. Knowing movement empty-release. Seeing-knowing-rigpa not different. That itself self-liberated. One known all-liberated, two three number extreme exhausted..."
Emaho! Self-liberation in direct seeing!
[8303-8318] 
Seeing time, sky center lightning edge unmoving looking is key.
From Letterless: "Rigpa resting instruction itself. This is secret heart. Eyes very held, also examined meeting-free. From eye corner expanse arises, light subtle swirling arises. Nature chain link, subtle and moving and moving. Eyes sky element examined, Buddha body thigle dawns. That intention warmth obtained, rigpa body chain link, body with appearance."
[8319-8342] 
Here establishing three light bindings on meaning: intention essence binding, mind stain purification manner; nature unmoved even placement manner; from that signs measure time certain dawning manner—three.
First has three: intention essence actual; mind and latencies' example; separation manner brief binding.
First: from Samantabhadra heart mirror—"Unmoving sky, thus rigpa clear. Clear unmoving depth immeasurable manner. Empty-luminous expansive great bliss expanse pervading. One-pointed clear, ultimate expanse manner. Unmixed complete, spontaneous ground abides."
Rigpa's nature, four wisdoms self-dynamic dawning, showing realization superior seeing dharmata.
Four wisdoms from Self-Arising: "Also rigpa's nature, wisdom aspects four possessing. Wisdom aspects four like this: liberation-making wisdom, all liberating..."
Emaho! Wisdom essence of dharmata!
[8375-8405] 
Listen! Now Longchenpa brings the Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror tantra to drive the point home. These aren't just pretty metaphors— they're precise instructions on how afflictions bind you, and how wisdom liberates.
"Aho! Vajra holder, listen!" The tantra addresses you directly. Wake up!
"Immature conceptions in samsara—like a corpse bound in iron." Feel this! Your rigid thoughts, your fixed ideas about reality—they're the iron chains. Not liberated, the time of liberation doesn't arise. As long as ignorance binds you like this, you won't change, won't transform.
"Ignorance is like water—afflictions gather." Just as water collects in low places, ignorance is the ground where all afflictions pool. "Anger is fire like an eon-ending conflagration." It burns everything! "Desire for things is like drinking salt water." The more you indulge, the more you thirst—never satisfied.
"Delusion is thick like darkness in an empty house." You can't see anything clearly. "Pride and arrogance like a crushing mountain." It weighs you down, flattens you. "Jealousy and ill-will like a narrow ravine gorge." Trapped, constricted, no room to move.
These five afflictions obscure wisdom. But look deeper—mind is like a bitch thief, consciousness like a forest monkey, mind like impure mud, all-ground like a being-pig, knowing like a feather carried by wind. Grasping and grasped like man and woman entangled. Karma's varieties like birds caught in a net. Suffering's varieties like ripples on water.
The result of affliction? No method to endure it! This samsaric suffering, this spear of grasping-grasped—by doing you won't get out. But by placing awareness, you go out!
Emaho! The secret mantra king transforms afflictions into wisdom! Like raising a lamp in an empty house—the wisdom lamp makes ignorance known. Not by fighting it, not by suppressing it, but by recognizing its nature. This is the path, friend!
[8406-8437] 
Third: separation manner brief binding has three: direct self-time separation actual; separation validity placement; other expressions.
First: outer appearance light-luminous seen, without delusion inner self-clear meditation self-place clear time, mind and wisdom instant separated, all-ground eight collections wisdom-covered, samsara dharmas not clear. Past self-nature spontaneously complete.
From Samantabhadra heart mirror—"Rigpa free from mind actual Buddha. Wisdom free from mind actual intention. Rays free from darkness actual pure appearance."
From Self-Arising: "Rigpa free from mind actual Buddha. Vajrasattva free from mind I. Clear-illuminator appearance without thought knows. Thought-free wisdom equality, self's great self-liberation."
[8438-8456] 
Second validity: placed unmoving in appearance nature, samsara dharmas self-dissolved gone—like water unmoving muddiness self-dissolved.
Jewel water clear example shows intention depth immeasurable.
From earlier: "Self-arisen nectar drop this, like jewel water clear. With impurity placed, impurity clears. Thus heart-essence instruction this, applied affliction not become stain."
Alone loose appearance companion-dawning. Unborn expanse wisdom light-luminous. All have, all not seeing. Inconceivable like sky expanse. Clear shining like sun light. Unchanging like Mount Meru. Deep immeasurable like ocean depth. Unstained like mud lotus. Unapprehended like water moon. Appearing as anything like sky miracle. Clear complete like rainbow.
Emaho! Separation from all obscurations!
[8457-8478] 
"Turn all scriptures to root great scripture. Turn all instructions to free-from-expression. Turn all practices to free-from-activity. Turn all conducts to supreme uncontrived. Turn all meditations to great clear non-grasping. Turn all views to wide-open unattached. Turn all results to great wisdom decisive. All these to one non-abiding expanse. Abandon all samsara activities. Always familiarize with wisdom appearance. Know wisdom dawning time. Know ground dharmas all as essence-nature-compassion three. Know path dharmas all as five bodies five wisdoms. Know result dharmas all as three bodies irreversible. Know essence dharmas all as empty. Know nature dharmas all as clear. Know compassion dharmas all pervading beings. Know wisdom dharmas all unmixed. Know light dharmas all non-grasping. Know ray dharmas all without dispersion-gathering. Know rigpa dharmas all free from self-thought. Thus all dharmas as neither thought nor examined—turn!"
[8479-8490] 
Second: nature unmoved even placement has two: briefly showing essence nature placement.
From Tal 'Gyur: "Meditation characteristic appearance mode: characteristic empty-luminous rigpa, nature wherever unmixed, grasping and grasped extreme exhausted, dharmata own face pure."
Extensive explanation placing nature appearance:
From Sixth Treasury: "Past three bodies nose-placed..."
Emaho! All teachings converge in natural flow!
Future three bodies back-supported, present three bodies enjoyed—is Buddhas' result made present, called primordially abiding time-three equality.
Past five wisdoms made ground, future five wisdoms peak-placed, present five wisdoms made path—called clear by clear light gathered, time-three equality rigpa yoga.
Past rigpa confident, future rigpa measured, present rigpa made path—called mother held child, time-three equality rigpa yoga.
Past thigle part-held, future thigle mind-placed, present thigle gathered as one—called single root cut, time-three equality rolled yoga.
Past expanse interval-connected, future expanse extended, present expanse one ground abiding—called rigpa entered expanse, time-three equality primordially connected abiding.
Past lamps nose-placed, future lamps hand-held, present lamps clarified—called empty dharmadhatu lamp self-pure view, time-three equality primordially appearing.
Past lights path-placed, future lights mind-placed, present lights mind-placed—called all appearance self-reached, time-three equality primordially meeting-free.
Emaho! Time-three equality in all aspects!
