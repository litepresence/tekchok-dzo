[8491-8524] 
Future three bodies back-supported, present three bodies enjoyed—is Buddhas' result made present, called primordially abiding time-three equality.

Emaho! Time-three equality in all aspects!
[8531–8543]
Listen here, you who think three kayas are something you achieve one after another! Longchenpa explains something profound about gradual recognition - not gradual attainment!
First samadhi: "resting, three bodies gradually familiarized, reality nature yoga, by this meaning becomes supreme." This isn't about improving yourself step by step! "Gradually familiarized" means awareness becomes accustomed to its own natural state. Like getting used to sitting in your own home - you don't build it, you recognize you've always been there!
"Three bodies familiarized samadhi experience, not arising simultaneously" - The key teaching: they're not different experiences to collect! They're awareness recognizing its own natural expressions in different ways. Don't grasp at dharmakaya recognition thinking you've "attained" something!
"First samadhi obtains nirmanakaya" - When awareness rests in its own nature, the emanation body manifests naturally. Not something you create, not something you achieve through effort!
[8544–8560]
Now, listen to this about "knowing time, previously unseen dharmas, without thinking mind dawns!" This is crucial: When you truly recognize rigpa, you don't need scriptures or teachings anymore. "Previously unseen dharmas" - all the wisdom you thought was hidden suddenly becomes obvious! "Without thinking mind dawns" - wisdom arises by itself, not through intellectual effort.
"Own instruction conventional words, without holding mind spread" - Longchenpa isn't dismissing teachings! He's saying they become natural expressions rather than rigid rules. "Without holding mind" - awareness doesn't cling to concepts anymore.
[8561–8575]
"For person with fortune, dharma taste mind satisfied, body six seven days, existence not felt, above ground risen, mid-space going experience, own object arises." These are the signs of natural settling, not achievements to boast about! "Body six seven days" - when awareness rests naturally, the physical body lightens. "Existence not felt" - not because you've died, but because you've transcended attachment to feeling separate!
"Above ground risen, mid-space going experience, own object arises." This describes how recognition unfolds naturally - like clouds dispersing to reveal the sky. Not something you do, but something that happens when you stop trying!
[8576–8587]
"Rigpa uncontrived placed, thus obtains own nirmanakaya." The most profound teaching in these lines! "Uncontrived placed" means awareness rests without artificial arrangement. "Thus obtains own nirmanakaya" - your own enlightenment is already present, just unrecognized!
Emaho! You've been obtaining your own nirmanakaya all along - you just didn't recognize it!
[8586-8625] 
"Sound also by this self-power obtained. In brief, six superknowledges, fortunate one obtains, self and others' benefits, this person will accomplish."
Second: spontaneously complete samadhi measure—"Three bodies self-arisen intention, in brief thus experience measure obtained. Nirmanakaya yoga conduct, previously nonexistent great compassion, supreme arises in own stream. At this time nirmanakaya samadhi obtained. Clear unthought knowing experience, called sambhogakaya samadhi. Unleaked empty thigle body, effortlessly self-dawn time, dharmakaya samadhi, yogin possessing obtains."
Third: unmoved even placement time has two: light-luminous directly appearing time; instruction source striking time.
First: "All appearance self-powered becomes, rigpa directly shown time, called intention true-seeing time. All appearance self-directly dawns, experience seed increasing time, rigpa itself scale reached time. Being arising power exhausted, knowing inwardly looking time, rigpa source striking time. Dharmata condition-free, all appearance blissfully expansive time, called dharmata mother-child even time."
Emaho! Signs of samadhi accomplishment!
[8632-8658] 
"When samadhi power becomes, know lamp pure manifestation. When special power arises, know samadhi path widens. When rigpa body seen, know without hope. When special wisdom arises in stream, know mara deception. When effortless conduct overflows, know wisdom entry direction. When empty object pervades, know light. When lamp object appears, know expanse and object."
From Seng Ge Rtsal Rdzogs: "Appearance gradually gradually, skilled should examine well. Very subtle and moving time, familiarization firmly abide. Fluctuating and subtle and moving time, seeing well seize. Rounded and subtle and swirling time, skilled unmoved samadhi stabilize. Stacked and fiery and body-appearing time, familiarization appearance increase seize..."
[8659-8670] 
Second: day-night light-luminous wheel has three: expanse light-luminous dawning basis recognition; from that lamp practice showing; day-night wheel meditation manner certainty.
First: though explained before, here extremely summarized clear showing five: expanse abiding manner; lamp location manner; expanse-rigpa dawning manner; practice manner; specialty certainty manner.
Emaho! Day and night luminous wheel!
[8679-8695] 
"From abode entered path gate, variously emerged engaging meaning. Sky wherever pervading beings, rigpa meaning also just that."
Where is it? From that: "Emaho! Rigpa's dharmata abides in own heart center. Father-mother two possessing, method and wisdom manner abides. Father possessing method body, mother possessing wisdom body, light and rays manner abides. Expanse and rigpa well adorned, spontaneously complete great thigle abides."
[8696-8718] 
Also, how does rigpa in light expanse abide as body and wisdom? Certain location is what and what?
From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Own own citra jewel inside, colored light blazing vase manner. Inside wisdom fire light blazing. Measureless wisdom various appearing. Body essence each each, speech emanation immeasurable, heart intention transcending one."
"All-ground dharmadhatu great treasure, rigpa wisdom lump abides. Appearance non-grasping object treasure, rigpa wisdom expanse abides. Secret gathering jewel eight-cornered treasure, rigpa wisdom lump abides..."
Emaho! Rigpa abides in the heart center!
[8729-8773] 
"End time child egg shell liberated like." From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Ground-abiding rigpa, wisdom expanse three bodies complete, like peacock egg, inner light wisdom clearly shown. Path-dawning rigpa, like rainbow shown. End-conveyed rigpa, peacock chick eggs, burst engaging like."
Also, when wisdom not ripened, all opportunity opens. Appearing time light. Familiarizing time body-appears.
From that: "Elaboration-free expanse itself, light-luminous immediate contact arose. Appearing time light appears, complete time self-appearance. Familiarizing time becomes body. Wisdom method connected, ultimate five mandalas seen."
[8753-8773] 
Thus abiding body and rigpa and expanse and wisdom characteristics:
From that same: "Body characteristic like this: unchanging and clear, empty and thought-free. Rigpa characteristic like this: subtle and moving, chain link and moving. Expanse characteristic like this: vast and spontaneous thick, empty limitless, clear and warm and cool, wide and moving nature holding, pervading and extreme edge fence. Wisdom characteristic like this: arising and arising and self-clear, primordial and knowing and realized, clear and shining and pervasive, appearing and dark and opening, empty and clear wisdom supreme, secret mantra characteristics considered."
Emaho! Characteristics of the natural state!
[8774-8804] 
Second: lamp location manner—gods one fathom, demigods four inches, humans one colored-light, animals self-clear.
Bodhicitta arrow-length, nirmanakaya one fathom.
Own light wisdom appearance existing:
From that same: "Wisdom dharmata great small, six appearances' directions, well explained like this: Tusita abides one fathom, Strife abides four inches, Equal abides one colored-light, Two-possessing self-clear only, Hunger sesame only, Suffering horse-hoof only, thus explained abiding. Buddhas immeasurable, Bodhisattvas arrow-length, Nirmanakaya abides one fathom. Buddhas Bodhisattvas and, Nirmanakaya and gods, directly object appearing. Those below five objects, not shown not seen."
[8805-8825] 
Also, mid-space self-appearance Buddha Bodhisattva gods three lamp appearance great is object vast. Other five own body object, thus small.
Third: expanse-rigpa dawning manner has two: expanse inside existing five lights wisdom self-dawn outer object blue pervasive great light; from that blazing five-possessing great wisdom light two object-appearance self-dawn.
Rigpa is vajra chain link appearance part body with.
From Rtsal Rdzogs: "All Buddhas' peak intention, not beyond expanse-rigpa two."
From Vajra Chain Link itself: "Part body inconceivable, self-arisen expanse lamp, self-appearance light inconceivable, thigle empty lamp, ray-possessing thigle inconceivable, five wisdoms' nature, indicating words inconceivable, condition-free object appearance, unceased arising inconceivable."
Emaho! Expance and rigpa dawn as light!
[8826-8869] 
Fourth: practice manner has two: key binding; from that arising experience appearance.
First also general placement method and particular extraction method two:
From Self-Arising: "Dharmata self-appearance sky, rigpa wisdom unmoved, non-grasping manner placed becomes, wisdom pure self-appearance seen, ignorance deluded appearance dharmas reverse."
"Unsetting victory banner, unchanging lamp clear, thought-free wisdom, clear-dark five lights clear."
"Jewel nectar, doing and meditating not obtained. Lamp expanse appearance, unmoved clear non-grasping examine. Thus from meaning unmoved, jewel nectar lamp. Without abandoning-placing obtaining supreme, without grasping self-place liberated."
[8853-8869] 
Second: from Tal 'Gyur: "Body key by dawning, wisdom abiding posture by, thigle gathering swirling accomplishes, light extending gathering. Related binding wind key, entering action extreme distinguishes. That changing action wind exhausted, delusion's arrangement fitted. Rigpa key releasing and, gathering sky placing. Expanse key gathering and, drawing element's wide spread fitting. Appearance key increase and exhaust, various self-place liberated."
Emaho! Keys for binding the elements!
Listen, you who seek the nature of mind! [8880-8884] Here lies the method of thod rgal, the path of lamps and light. You gaze upon the bindus of light that arise from the vajra-strings of your own awareness—like a bird swiftly taking wing, they appear in an instant. Do you see? This very self-display is your own rigpa's play.
[8885-8890] If you strike these displays with recognition, they dissolve like deer swift to flee. Rest undistracted upon their meaning, and they circle like bees to nectar. When you truly look at your own display, it stands like a mirage—flickering, yet without substance.
[8891-8898] Do not be distracted by their outer form, and they become but tremors and flickers. Deeper still, undistracted from their meaning, they become like coals half-concealed—neither fully seen nor extinguished. Thus, if you gaze intensely, you perceive neither coming nor going, only light displaying itself.
[8899-8906] When you stabilize upon this meaning, you see the lamp of empty bindus. Looking directly at these, you perceive bindus with bodies. Undistracted from their meaning, deluded displays resolve into sambhogakaya forms. All these bodily displays are but illusion, rainbow, and magical display.
[8907-8924] Resting intensely upon them, day and night become one—like the eyes of a fox, seeing equally in darkness and light. Thus is your own mandala-display. Yet know this: these empty-form rainbow lights and bindus do not exist in the external space, though fools believe they do. They arise from within your body's pure light-channels, seen inwardly through the eye's pure light-channel. The heart's radiance spreads everywhere—now is the time when the base-display dawns. Knowing your own face, rest naturally in your own radiance, and through this you will see what lhun grub luminosity truly is.
Emaho!
[8925-8959] Listen here, dear yogin! Within self-reverse from obscuration without—here tantra and instruction say outer sky exists. Intentional condition: outer sky to eye place see portion exists. Nature outer exists, other-by also see possible, yet outer without know! Other-by self empty-form not-see, that body-by obscure. Self-by see light-root pure gap-from within arise, like sun arise appear see from hole-within!
Proof: eye close-from empty-form see—this-by within-in exist indeed! Therefore body etc. appear outer field-in without also exist like appear. Mirror-to look time face arise like: within light-root clear mirror-in, heart awareness face-like resonance appear that. Field-in without also within see, reference pure light-root quality portion-from arise. Outer inner two portion mix appear only—delusion many all true!
Manner thus understand: person wisdom-possess great-perfection expanse-from arise called, various self-free yogin I like! Manner this confident scripture join: Lion Power-Perfect great tantra-from—body appear that all, field appear not indeed! Example young girl-by mirror characteristic clear-to, self face appear see like!
Dharma-nature field sky-to, awareness appear body-to arise! Self location-condition see indeed, field-in exist not indeed! Reference pure manifest clear, self center-and mandala with, wisdom meaning-to field without, sentient-being time-at field like appear! See field-to realize great, understand field-in bliss great, appear see experience great! Self-awareness one-only companion supreme, appear field-in without by!
Emaho! Self-awareness without outer field!
[8960-9001] Listen, practitioner! Vajra nadi-thread itself-from portion body indeed think-not pervade—thus! This understand-reason one exist, intelligence-possess all-by know must. Nature realize easy by body-appear say, contradiction without explain must. Outer sky-to space-awareness-and lamp-appear say, confuse-possess all-to realize easy for!
Self within understand-reason former like indeed! Fifth special determine manner: awareness-to change without essential-point-by! First base-from transcend samsara-in delude also, awareness bad-to go without! Then lama-by face-introduce that lose-from wander, later decide time joy! First lose time delusion time awareness two-to good-bad distinction without!
Not-meditate awareness and meditate time-to distinction without! Wander time and pass time awareness-to good-bad without! Sleep-to go time and wake time, go-come awareness-to good-bad distinction without! But appear manner good-bad dream joy-suffering only exist—that-to depend-from path meditate! Essence good-to go hope not—awareness-to transfer-change without reason!
That word also self-arise from: E ma ho! Jewel precious nectar this! Beginning without time time, I jewel precious lose! That time suffering wrong wander, jewel precious nectar that! Search-by find place without indeed! Self-from self-arise self-by realize! Jewel precious nectar that! Lose not-feel find feel! Lose-by thing characteristic without! Find-by joy glow with! Find time and lose time, distinction without one state-in realize! Thus!
Also self-awareness state-in lose that, self state-from find! Self-awareness one wheel-from, other-to enter without!
Emaho! Self-awareness jewel never lost!
[9002-9042] Listen here, dear one! King treasure-in jewel lose-from jewel without-by suffering do! Treasure-from find-by joy-bliss expand, two both treasure one-from not-move! Awareness state-from samsara-nirvana two-as appear, thus like!
This vast Dharma-nature expanse realize—wish-fulfilling supreme self-essential-point determine secret-word! Second that-from lamp experience demonstrate three: preliminary place characteristic, actual lamp press-method, that-from appear arise-manner!
First: Life this action all abandon! Lama holy please do! Very secluded place darkness decorate room-in, immovable three-with sit! Lama yoga perfect meditate request heart-from place—thalgyur! Lamp press this-like: faith-possess samsara mind-free by, lama offer-and giving do, samsara connection all abandon! Secluded direction-or charnel-ground-in, companion abandon one-only abide must—thus!
Second: Ah-to place and clear enter two! First: cross-legged sit, thumb finger press-by red-clear clear light round appear-to place experience take! Session short-to number many do! Thumb finger effort release slow look! Again press-by appear see Dharma-nature manifest appear called!
That-from: self thumb and finger-by, bindu empty lamp press! Press that-from what arise? Dharma-nature manifest appear indeed—thus!
Clear enter: light five appear-from first smoke like, dull illusion like, cloud hover like, fire spark emanate like, sun and moon, star form like, intermediate-space rainbow like, light white clear, yellow clear, red clear, green clear, blue, various, net pattern, ray arise, round gather, bindu, stupa, god body, sentient-being form various there-here far-near self-appear!
Emaho! Lamp practice of clear light!
[9043-9102] Listen, fortunate practitioner! Clear enter-by wind five arise appear measure without arise—thalgyur! That-from wisdom expand experience: color and shape also, outer and inner all clear pervade, above-from above-to certain expand! This time body speech bliss sign, appear measure and manner-with join—thus!
Third that-from appear arise manner: First red-yellow round-from, later light five rim-to appear! Wind essential-point-by move from, outward hold slow essential-point! Then clear portion experience take-by: lamp mirror like, light slice like, bindu bowl like-from body with expand!
That-from thus press appear: First red pure, empowerment complete round self-clear complete! Finger two pure-from three-to become! Then again again press-by, wisdom five color: white red green blue yellow! Field-to appear effort! Then effort-without outer also, wind portion-by go-come and, mirror pure shape like-from, two and three portion appear!
That itself always familiarity-from, color five light-by also, slice like-from edge cut appear, field edge like-from see measure! That-from familiarity measure find-from, bindu center-to body with, half body pure-to while abide! That-to five five pair-with, very clear bindu-with connect, father-mother body appear possess! Delusion-appear cease-from pure-field indeed—thus!
This all time-at formerly demonstrate measure and sign manner all arise: Wisdom perfect appear space and, Dharma-nature pure appear awareness and, bindu ripen appear body-from mandala-to measure reach-from! Again Dharma-nature cease appear conduct—thalgyur! Wisdom perfect appear and, Dharma-nature first appear-from, appear three perfect-from cease become!
Thus experience take-by: effort supreme all year three, middle all year five, last all year seven month eleven! Day six Dharma-nature cease appear see light body free!
Emaho! Bindu and light perfection!
[9103-9207] Listen well, dear yogin! That-from: effort great-small-by, day and month year all-by, individual time-to certain accomplish! Move very without time all-from, individual measure-to reach indeed—thus!
This experience take secret essential-point great! Third day night wheel manner determine four: continuum-to sense-organ essential-point-to gather, memory door close! Dawn know object vase-in put, wisdom directly clear! Morning wisdom clear-to demonstrate, arise-feeling all self-place pure! Day appear vast-by strike, sign all suppress! This formerly also explain, here also leap-over companion-as explain summary experience take, little former-and not-different distinction exist!
Day time elephant gaze-by manifest-to look, delusion-appear self-cease release sign suppress! Night time bindu empty lamp-to cognition place: bindu expand time cognition clear portion expand, decrease time cognition increasingly subtle go-from, end reference without go state, cognition reference think emanate gather without equipoise!
Sleep-to go time forehead center-in, bindu empty dissolve manner mind place having, sleep-of luminosity essence seize! Midnight-at heart within-of luminosity-to mind hold having sleep by, dream luminosity-to liberate having, habit-continuum cease! Then morning lion gaze by, bow-span-of sky-to AH white one-to consciousness place by, clear-empty elaboration-from free-of meaning within-from arise! That manner-in how-much abide meditate—Six-Expanse from!
Body-of posture press having, consciousness sky-of range-to cast! Like-that eye space-between-to, elephant-of gaze by, memory-without great-spreading great-as place! Like-that awareness sky-to place, this-from separate without! Yogin continuum-by what meditate: daytime appear expand-spread, nighttime self-of place house-in! Time four equal-of measure hold, sense-organ door all self-gather having, bindu empty-of lamp-to yogin endowed mind place!
Emaho! Day-night wheel of luminosity!
[9143-9207] Listen, practitioner! Bindu itself expand time, consciousness itself expand place! Like-that bindu subtle become time, bindu increasingly-subtle-to, consciousness increasingly-subtle place! Sleep-and dream essential-point by, before attachment habit-continuum root-from extract! This-like nighttime time all-in, yogin fortune-with endowed act! This-by appear self-expand reach—thus!
Like-that day-night wheel-continuum-by experience take having, delusion-appear self-cease luminosity-to liberate! That-from: body-and field-and awareness by, self-appear pure-of measure all hold! Like-that self-appear measure grasp having, six-classes delusion-of appear cease! That cease time-at, awareness measure-to reach! Like-that measure-to when reach time, self-of body-also not-appear!
Elements-by produced flesh-blood body, elements self-place-at pure cause! This field-as appear cause! Delusion-by grasped mind-of body, elements self-place-at dissolve cause! This-also not-appear self-place-at dissolve! Awareness-by grasped light-of body, water-moon mandala like! This time Dharma-nature cease-and near! This-in what familiar Buddha-field!
Then body three limit exhaust having, action-free perfect body obtain! This time body-of limit all-and free-of near! Base-at familiar yogin-by, self-of place-also empty become! Path-at familiar yogin-by, elements coarse stain exhaust! Fruit-at indeed who familiar, not-return ground-to this-by reach—thus!
Also light-body-and samadhi-body two distinction: light-body awareness self-light stain without, Buddha-eye field-from sentient-being-by see unable! Samsara-and nirvana-in conduct, fruit appear-in not-abide wisdom one-cut-as arise fruit obtain!
Emaho! Perfect body beyond elements!
Attend now to the light-body! [9209-9227] The light-body and samadhi-body have differences: light-body is rigpa's self-light without stain, buddha-eye's object but unseen by sentient beings. Samadhi deity-body is ripened habitual patterns' born, extremely pure four elements' atoms, seen by sentient beings with divine eye. The third point extensively explains the fivefold doctrine's wheel of wisdom in three parts: essence briefly shown, nature extensively explained, and aspects gathering meaning.
[9228-9241] First: from Sengé Tsal Dzogchen, what are the five doctrines? With Mountain Summit Gathering's doctrine, view for meditation. With Wisdom Pouring's doctrine, ground to be taken. With Thigle Seeing Aperture's doctrine, examine display's arising. With Sun Moon Equal Measure's doctrine, carry meaning to its end. With Ocean Depths Opening's doctrine, carry rigpa to the expanse.
[9242-9267] The first's nature is Mah Dzogchen's changeless clear light rigpa, dharma-expanse and wisdom non-dual. When faculties realize this, three individual faculties—excellent, middling, lesser—have view, meditation, conduct, result each fourfold, making twelve aspects. From Tsal Dzog: "When Mountain Summit Gathering's doctrine dawns, Dzogchen view complete, excellent middling lesser faculties' views arise threefold. Excellent faculty's view: wisdom display spontaneously arising—own wisdom realizes non-conceptual rigpa with body. Meditation: unmoving in clarity like ocean's planets and stars. Conduct: ceaseless spontaneous like sky's meteor. Result: seeing unborn self-arisen display."
[9268-9304] Middling faculty's view realizes rigpa merely unborn. Meditation: like cloth floating on ocean, free from conceptual aspects. Conduct: unfabricated lunatic conduct, unimpeded in any display. Result: possessing self-abiding meditation through suppressing signs. Lesser faculty's view realizes displays as magical illusions or emanations. Meditation: like a lion cub separated from womb, recognizing own display, wisdom dawns in bardo, seeing enclosed wisdom. Conduct: possessing samsara-nirvana dualistic conduct. Result: leaving body, going to natural emanation body's pure land. Thus twelve aspects from three faculties' fourfold divisions.
Emaho!
Hear this, you who seek to purify! [9305-9327] The second Wisdom Pouring doctrine's nature is realizing rigpa's potency power perfected from the start. The three faculties' different realizations: From that same text—"When Wisdom Pouring's doctrine arises, again excellent middling lesser persons' views arise threefold. Excellent one's view realizes empowerment itself as unborn result, self-established. Meditation: through wisdom's application expanding bindus, great bliss space-equal meditation unmoved. Conduct: bodhicitta white-red without pure impure. Result: seeing buddha families' suchness."
Emaho!
