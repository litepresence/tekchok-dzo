Listen well, you fortunate ones! With characteristicless dharmata realization, see hungry ghost realms, lifespans, sufferings, karma, and karmic results, and emanate three measures of countless forms [14151-14153].
With all phenomena realized as self-luminous nature, see animal realms, sufferings, lifespans, karma, and karmic results, and emanate five measures of countless forms [14154-14158].
With all phenomena realized as equality, see human realms and so forth, and emanate hundreds of billions [14158-14159].
With all phenomena realized as empty of self or mine, see asura realms and characteristics, and emanate ninety thousand [14159-14161].
With all phenomena realized as free of words, see gods' realms, lifespans, and fall times, and emanate nine hundred thousand [14161].
Thus, through self-arising knowledge of others' benefit, the different types of beings—twenty-one hells, four hungry ghosts, two animals, four humans, three asuras, and though gods have many types, included in three realms—six birthplaces of gods, their forms, enjoyments, conduct, perceptions, and characteristics [14162-14175].
The six clairvoyances see and know faculties and powers [14175].
Thus thirty with outflows—the six sense faculty ways of seeing—and thirty without outflows—the six faculties' seeing others—sixty [14176-14177].
Emaho!

My devoted ones, understand this distinction! Regarding object, with outflows and without are spoken. The object, the deluded appearance, has outflows; dharmata free of elaboration, unmistaken, is without outflows. The meeting mind of these two is spoken thus [14178-14180].
In nature, the realizing mind of aryas is without outflows, equal; ordinary beings' is with outflows—know thus [14181-14182].
The sixth, Buddha's knowledge extremely without outflows clairvoyance six: Having completed the thirty-six, dwelling as samadhi, seeing and abiding in things' mode without mistake [14183-14186].
Essence expanding as form, see all appearances included in three kayas [14186-14187]. Knowledge expanding as wisdom, simultaneously see previous clairvoyances [14187-14188]. Activity expanding as deeds, see thirty-six perfect marks of emanation body activity [14188-14189].
Thus expanding, engaging in unceasing dharmata wisdom clairvoyance, seeing hidden objects [14189-14190].
Self-purifying signs wisdom, self-existing nature abiding clairvoyance, emptiness appearance [14190-14191].
Invisible faculties, knowledge, mind, wisdom, and wisdom, and compassion's aspects [14191-14196]—previously bound by self-belief in three kayas' hidden ordinary fixation, all liberated by knowledge, so called "great clairvoyance" [14197-14198].

You who seek liberation, listen! Thus sixty-eight in the first of six clairvoyances; twenty-four each in second and third; six each in remaining three—dividing parts makes one hundred thirty-four [14199-14201].
These also gather into six groups. The thirty-six, the fifth, sense faculty way seeing six, have outflows [14202-14203]. The first group's five faculties' seeing others thirty are without outflows [14204]. Know the final as extremely without outflows [14205].
These also, from Union of Sun and Moon: "Thus arising, in that type, six clairvoyances arise: knowing past births, death and transition, birth, others' minds, invisible hidden all knowing, seeing and knowing six realms' abodes, and faculties purified clairvoyance—six arise" [14206-14214].
The fourth, how dharani is obtained: All previously heard Dharma arises simultaneously, and previously unheard teachings also arise without measure, so called "dharmata bardo" [14215-14217].
From that: "At that time, unforgetting dharanis also arise in your own continuum. All previous teachings arise simultaneously in the continuum. Likewise, previously unheard teachings also arise, so called dharmata bardo" [14219-14224].

My heart-children, pay attention! The fifth, how samadhi is born: At that time, in pure dharmata nature, intellect's engagement ceases and you abide non-conceptually [14225-14226].
How it ceases: What ceases ceases in your own continuum [14228]. How does it cease? Grasping previous qualities' appearance as dharmata pure mode ceases [14229-14230].
What appearance at that time? Dharmata ceased appearance arises, so bad conceptual thoughts of previous attachment, future grasping, good clairvoyance, memory, and so forth definitely do not arise—like pure sky [14231-14233].
From Union of Sun and Moon: "Continuous samadhi continuum self-arising as nature, bad conceptual thoughts definitely do not arise" [14235-14236].
At this stage, know the twenty-one faculties' liberation and delusion ways [14237].
The sixth, how spontaneous accomplishment dissolves: Previously arisen now gathering within [14240-14241].
Eight modes of dissolving arise simultaneously [14242]:
- Compassion dissolving into compassion: like sun's rays gathering at sunset
- Six realms' appearance not seen in own face, impure delusion nameless, beyond visible appearance
- Light dissolving into light: like rainbow melting in sky, light and color signs' distinction gone, empty beyond grasping, single taste in dharmadhatu
- Form dissolving into form: like vase form, objects clear within, no signs' features as face and hands, pure
- Wisdom dissolving into wisdom: like child entering mother's lap, dharmata mother and child nondual, no grasping
- Non-duality dissolving into non-duality: like river into river, originally liberated, single taste as dharmakaya, equal, without distinction, free of elaboration [14242-14252]

Listen well, fortunate ones!
Wisdom dissolving into wisdom is like a child entering the mother's lap [14260].
Light dissolving into light is like a rainbow melting in space [14261].
Form dissolving into form is like a vase [14262].
Non-duality dissolving into non-duality is like a river dissolving into a river [14263].
Freedom from extremes dissolving into freedom from extremes is like space dissolving into space [14264].
Pure wisdom gate dissolving into essence original purity is like a lion taking a snow mountain [14265].
Impure samsara gate dissolving into pure wisdom gate is like drawing in a silken cord [14266].
The fifth, extensive explanation of essential instructions that liberate into those, has two: hitting the crucial point with dharmata meaning essential instruction, and focusing with three times essential instruction [14267-14269].
The first: Methods shown for hitting the crucial point in both this life and bardo [14270-14272].
From essence, nature, and compassion three crucial points:
Essence's crucial point: Recognize your own face directly, decide directly that it is so, and be confident directly of liberation—three [14275-14277].
First: Though nature appears as various lights, essence is rigpa radiance not beyond one, the empty-luminous original purity ground—decide this is your own face, the final liberation place, directly introduced as true seeing [14278-14280].
Second: In that nature, without fabrication, naturally in meditation, cut through completely, without distraction, without grasping—this is meditation [14281-14282].
Third: At that time, free of meditation object and subject, rigpa pure from ground shines and liberates, without abandoning good-bad thought collections, self-liberated—confidence and repetition [14283-14285].
Emaho!

My devoted students, listen! In natural ground, though various appear, they do not exist as appearance. Gather into one all-knowing pure luminosity, self-clear self-arising wisdom, and meditate with repetition [14286-14288].
That grasping also liberates—nothing else to do. This is the essential instruction of light-appearance liberating into dharmata [14289-14290].
Looking outward, clear inward rigpa, instantaneously naked essence—this is the second crucial great essential instruction [14291-14295].
Compassion's crucial point: Though various external objects to be tamed arise as conditions, and many rigpas to tame appear radiating, do not cut the outward radiating traces, do not examine your own face, do not negate inwardly—whatever arises, leave it in its own place, directly settled, boundless naked clear rigpa, grasping that, seeing liberation place truly [14296-14302].
That very clear free rigpa, without gaps, directly settled, exhausted, pure "ka"—this and bardo awareness arising unceasing are grasped, then ka-pure compassion rigpa is known and liberated [14303-14304]. This is the third crucial great essential instruction [14305].
These three are secret heart essence amrita, extremely pure, extremely secret [14306]. Words few but meaning great, sutra-tantra few but crucial great, depth essential but importance great. To heart-sons supreme, not others, seal of essential instruction [14307-14310].
Emaho!

You who wish to be free, understand! The three crucial points with citations:
From Talgyur: "Furthermore, dharmata essence: established as essence from nature. Since appearance mode is not one certain, entering paths are also different. With face, knowledge, and liberation seeing, entering, seeing, and habituation. From face recognition, own face. Confident heart is the place. Decided, confidence enters. Thus three's certain activity: essence complete, cause ceases" [14317-14328].
"Furthermore, dharmata nature explained: Here not one certain, whatever labeled thus appears. From various name bases, words and phrases' elaboration appears. From uncertain various names, meaning also empty of mere labeling. Since emptiness not established anywhere, nature pure thus appears" [14328-14337].
"Furthermore, dharmata compassion explained: Objects to be tamed various, taming forms also that many. From lineage and faculty displays, samsara-nirvana realization different. That itself placed as individual object is uncorrected meaning's intention" [14338-14344].
The second, focusing with three times essential instruction, has two: three times' places and method essential instructions [14346-14347].
Place crucial points three: entering knowing crucial point, liberation own face crucial point, completion face knowing crucial point [14348-14350].

Listen, my fortunate ones! The first: When rigpa enters outward clear light appearance, know radiance as self-display [14352]. When light enters inward into rigpa, know not moving from that ground of original purity [14353].
Second: At the time of four wisdoms preparation, outer, inner, and secret three liberations abiding in own face, knowing own face essential instruction—grasping that [14355-14356].
Aggregates' self-grasping ceasing, body liberates as clear light, dharmata abides in own face. Elements coarse and subtle particles liberated, appearance abides as clear light great bliss. Afflictions coarse and subtle liberated, rigpa abides as mother and child dissolved [14357-14359].
Outer delusion purified, rigpa knows meeting dharmata mother, and various conditioned appearances as objects liberate from coarse and subtle things, mother and child nondual liberation [14360].
How liberated? Earth element's characteristics self-purified, body's flesh bindings liberated. Water purified, blood; fire purified, warmth; wind purified, breath bindings liberated [14361-14365]. No thought horse, flesh and blood self-continuum grasping liberated. Inner rigpa without affliction stains, five wisdoms self-display. Objects' stains without, phenomena and dharmata nondual [14366-14369].
Emaho!

My heart-sons and daughters, understand! Thus abiding in own face, knowing thus, afflictions cannot arise in rigpa. Liberated from samsara's karmic ripening. Since afflictions cannot abide in rigpa's own face, secret rigpa dharmata—existence, non-existence, permanence, nihilism, thing and emptiness aspects do not fall anywhere. Outer objects and subjects, inner various thoughts holding as different, secret rigpa itself grasping also none—knowing own face [14370-14334].
Third, completion face knowing crucial point: Rigpa reaching spontaneous accomplishment precious jewel's own place, abiding in nondual original purity and spontaneous accomplishment, knowing that [14380-14381].
All samsara's phenomena purified at that time, so previous delusion not experienced is decided. Now impossible to delude, obtaining body of no-return, rigpa itself no-return place [14382-14384].
Samsara's deluded appearance, nirvana's pure appearance, when both dissolve into that dharmadhatu, existence and non-existence, permanence and nihilism not established anywhere, so samsara-nirvana equal, gone to ground liberation—at that time of spontaneous accomplishment dissolving, know thus [14384].
This is rigpa own face's great crucial point [14385].
Second, method essential instruction has two: previous essential instruction and this time's sharp-dull difference [14386-14387].
Emaho!

**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [14442-14480]
Listen well, you who practice the Dharma! Previous essential instruction: Having grown familiar with three crucial points, recognizing face—like recognizing a familiar object, at that time without doubt, liberated [14442-14444].
This time's essential instruction: Sharp rigpa rising from ground like a shooting star in space, instantly knowing own face and liberating [14445-14446]. Dull rigpa, not recognizing appearance's distinctions, through power of previous profound practice, like a lion cub separating from womb, coarse purified, instant five, twenty-one faculties' whichever way liberated [14447-14450].
These also from Union of Sun and Moon: "This time has three: entering time, liberation time, completion time" [14451-14455].
Entering time is two: rigpa entering into light, and light entering into rigpa [14456-14458].
Liberation is three: rigpa liberated from conditions and elements; rigpa without stains, liberated from afflictions; rigpa itself not falling anywhere, liberated from outer and inner phenomena [14459-14404].
Completion is rigpa itself all phenomena's appearance simultaneously liberated [14405].
Method is two: previous essential instruction's crucial point and this time's sharp-dull difference [14406-14407].
Third topic: Summarizing meaning through self-display faculties' liberation way has three: faculties' division generally shown, liberation-delusion sequence specifically explained, and faculties' individual liberation way extensively spoken [14408-14411].

My devoted ones, understand! First: Sharp, medium, dull faculties each have final, medium, supreme, peak, excellent, best, and complete—seven each, making twenty-one [14412-14418].
Wisdom appearance manner one, delusion basis of aspects one, realization measure one, knowing analysis one, self-display liberation manner one—each arise separately, so faculties also explained as twenty-one [14419-14424].
From Self-Arising: "Hey faithful retinue, listen! I have taught beings' ignorance. Since appearance arising modes are twenty-one, understand these well" [14425-14429].
Faculties shown with three types: supreme, medium, supreme has seven—supreme's final, supreme's medium, supreme's supreme, supreme's peak, supreme's excellent, supreme's best, supreme's complete [14430-14440].
This is supreme's division. That also, seeing-return one, wisdom appearance birth manner one, realization measure one, understanding time one, knowing analysis one—arising and abiding stability in respective appearance obtained [14441-14446].
Medium also has seven—medium's final, medium's medium, medium's supreme, medium's peak, medium's excellent, medium's best, medium's complete. That also wisdom birth measure one arises [14447-14456].
This is medium's. Final also has seven—final's final, final's medium, final's supreme, final's peak, final's excellent, final's best, final's complete [14457-14464].

You who seek liberation, listen! From Union of Sun and Moon: "Twenty-one faculties' individual stability obtained also exists. Those not understanding their own knowledge and without lama's teaching become bewildered at that appearance—surprise, fear, confusion, terror, losing perception, and so forth—taking samsara's near appropriation again. Thus twenty-one faculties' individual delusion also exists" [14466-14474].
Thus three faculties: Supreme liberate in three instants. Medium may obtain stability in five days [14475-14477]. Twenty-one instants obtain stability. Finals are born in natural nirmanakaya realm, breathing out without bardo, becoming Buddha [14478-14479].
Here three: twenty-one faculties' delusion manner, liberation manner, and reversing delusion about difference manner [14480-14483].
First: Those who haven't seen this teaching's gate, though seen, influenced by cowardice, laziness, and distraction—final of finals not obtaining power over dharmata bardo's self-display, greatly bewildered, not finding certainty, greatly appearing, wondering what lineage they come from, not recognizing face so frightened, not practicing even an instant directly, wondering if this is delusion or faculties' delusion, perception mistaken, and so on—taking samsara's near appropriation again, wandering through bardo, twenty-one faculties' delusion exists [14484-14494].
Emaho!
[14665-14702] 
Listen! Bindu appearance ceases. One instant, spontaneously accomplished appearance ceases. One instant, primordially pure truth seen. That too emanation from primordially pure ground not separate. Path faculties all's suchness obtained. Like example shooting star sky running manner. Shooting star that, light radiating-like, emanation opening, beings' benefit doing. Benefit three days capable.
Sharp faculties' peak: One day bardo abiding. That too four joining pristine awareness appearance, own appearance seeing. That too own eye from pristine awareness fire two arisen. Weapon rain falling that all ceased. Appearance ceasing non-existent dawning. That own consciousness awakening. Own object seeing. Spontaneously accomplished ground certainty obtaining. Again shooting star-like should know.
Sharp faculties' supreme: Two days Buddha. That too bindu appearance one day abiding. That too own heart from pristine awareness sun one dawns. From that light rays ten directions radiate. From that light rays' tip each each Tathagata body each dawns. By that appearance's objects all body's nature seen. Then again spontaneously accomplished appearance certainty obtaining, emanation seven days capable of benefit. That too shooting star-like.
Sharp's excellent: Three days bordo abiding. That too bindu one day abiding. That too certainty obtaining, pristine awareness appearance, own appearance aspect one dawns. That too two days abiding. First day light seen. Second day body seen. That body also big coarse seen. That confidence, spontaneously accomplished ground certainty obtaining. That too shooting star-like. Emanation also eleven days capable of benefit. Sharp's sharp...
Emaho! The sharp faculties liberate fastest—sometimes in one instant! They see the bindus, recognize them, and dissolve into the natural state. The "shooting star" is the sudden flash of recognition. Don't compare yourself to others—whatever your capacity, recognition liberates!
[14704-14736] 
Listen! Four days bardo abiding. That too own front, five bindus beautifully arranged, seeing. That own latency awakened, east bindu one day abiding. Likewise four directions' bindus one day each abiding. Then again spontaneously accomplished certainty obtaining, Buddha. Emanation also fourteen days capable of benefit.
Sharp faculties' medium: One day seeing. Five days seeing. That too thus: Four days bindu abiding. One day pristine awareness appearance abiding. That too own heart from light rays horse-drum-like one arisen. That too sky's expanse pillar-like coming. That own eye not distracted holding, looking. Sky's center, great bindu one beautifully clear that seeing. That confidence greatly arising. Own is thought consciousness one arisen. Confidence mother lap child entering pith instruction called.
Then that own awareness dissolving-dissolving. Non-reversing great measure arrow-like pith instruction called. Emanation also twenty-one days capable of benefit.
Sharp faculties' end: Six days needed. That too bindu four days. Pristine awareness and dharmadhatu one day. Likewise mirror-like one day. Then again own two eyes from pristine awareness mirror clear two excellently dawning. From that appearance immeasurable radiating. One own above bindu one seeing. One own front also great bindu one seeing. Then certainty obtaining, Buddha. Emanation also twenty-five days capable of benefit.
Emaho! The bindus (spheres of light) are the display of your own nature! When you see them, don't just watch—recognize them as your own awareness. The "mother lap child" is awareness returning to its source. These aren't complicated rituals—they're descriptions of what happens naturally when you recognize!
