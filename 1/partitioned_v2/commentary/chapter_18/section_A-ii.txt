"The great effortless spontaneous perfection!" Thus it is said.
[13272-13280] 
The second: specific explanation of how elements dissolve has two parts: sudden death by temporary conditions—the bodhisattva's breath-transference manner; and non-temporary conditioned gradual transference. The first: for those who suddenly die by collapse, fire, water, falling, or weapons without gradual element dissolution, rigpa transference—evil ones enter bad rebirths, good ones are born in good destinies. Those with little training from this view-meditation are born with happiness in high pure lands or as natural emanations.
[13281-13299] 
The second: the outer five elements dissolve into the inner five elements. The inner five dissolve into the secret five. The secret five dissolve into the perfect five elements, then enter the great path of clear light dharmata! The first outer elements: the body's parts earth, water, fire, wind, and space five—these are called outer because they appear and produce. We don't mean external visible object elements! How the body's coarse five elements each dissolve has two: outer five dissolving into inner five, and inner five dissolving into outer five. The first: at death-time's beginning, each element's power as before disappears—earth dissolves into earth, power lost; water into water, gathering moist; fire into fire, heat lessens; wind into wind, breathing becomes difficult; space into space, clarity of consciousness fades, memory unclear!
Emaho! The elements return to themselves—like rivers to the ocean!

When everything falls away—concepts, practices, even the notion of enlightenment—what remains? That naked awareness, completely free, utterly complete. This is what you've been seeking your whole life, and it's been right here all along.
You don't need to become a buddha. You already are one—you just don't recognize it. Like a poor person sitting on a treasure chest, not knowing what's beneath them.
Open your eyes! See what Longchenpa is pointing to. Don't let another moment pass in confusion.

Listen here, you fortunate ones! The text reveals how the mandala of the five Buddha families unfolds within the heart center. Like a master craftsman arranging precious jewels, the deities appear in perfect symmetry—Maitreya and the eight bodhisattvas in the eight directions, the eight goddesses of delight, and the guardians of the gates. Each Buddha sits upon a throne of lions, elephants, horses, peacocks, and garudas [13666-13669], radiant as sun and moon upon lotus seats in vajra posture.
You must understand—though your physical body seems absent at this time, the imprint of self-grasping still lingers like a dream [13684]. The light body manifests from the habitual tendencies not yet exhausted. What appears as external light is actually your own display, like reflections in a mirror. Do you see? The light rays streaming from the heart bind you to these visions through the connection of your own radiance [13687-13688].
This is the stage where recognition is everything. The deities appear not as external gods to be worshipped, but as the play of your own awareness. If you recognize this, you are liberated. If not, you wander further into confusion.
Emaho!
