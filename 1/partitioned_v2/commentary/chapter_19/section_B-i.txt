My heart-sons and daughters, this completes the profound instructions on the completion stage of Dzogchen!
The text describes the five Buddha realms and the central wrathful realm where even those with dull faculties can attain liberation. These are not mythological locations but the natural display of enlightened mind. When recognition occurs in the bardo, one naturally abides in these pure fields.
The key point throughout all these teachings is recognition (ngo shes). Whether you are:
- A practitioner with sharp faculties who recognizes instantly in the clear light
- A medium practitioner who works through the four wisdom preparations
- Or a dull faculty practitioner who needs to reach the natural emanation fields
All can attain liberation if they recognize the nature of their own mind!
The "shooting star" analogy appears throughout—the sudden flash of recognition that liberates instantly. Don't think you need eons of practice. An instant of pure recognition is enough.
The twenty-one faculties represent the full spectrum of sentient beings' capacities. Whichever describes you, there is a path. The teachings are exhaustive so that no one is left out.
Remember:
1. All appearances are your own display (rang snang)
2. Recognition liberates (ngo shes grol)
3. No recognition, wandering continues (ma ngo 'khyams)
4. The nature is originally pure (ka dag)
5. The display is spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub)
Train now in recognizing the nature of mind in this life. Familiarize yourself with the clear light in meditation and sleep. Then when death comes, you will recognize the clear light of death as your own nature, and liberation is certain.
This completes the commentary on Volume 2, pages 321-370, covering the bardo teachings, the spontaneously accomplished visions, the four wisdom preparations, clairvoyance, and the natural emanation pure fields.
May all beings recognize their own nature and attain liberation!

[15563-15604] 
Listen! There is a great charnel ground called Blazing Ye Mountain. It has a measureless palace like this: A skull house four stories high. It is thus: Dry skulls as fruit, flesh and blood as walls, intestines with veins as roof. Measures and height immeasurable. Thunderbolt nails. Rakta as gutter water. Sun and moon as seats. Crocodile mouth as door frame. Eight great gods as pillars. Great supreme foundation. Daytime, wind swirls. Nighttime, fire blazes. Four corners of that palace, great field's canopy spread. Five goddesses dancing. All ground, rakta's waves swirling.
Inside that palace, Bhagavan Youthful Hero Powerful, mind unmoving from peace, yet body shown in wrathful aspect. Surrounded by dakinis and immeasurable wrathful gatherings. Thus: Dakini Purna Nyebar Zhiba, Brahma Dung Ngri Can, Rishi Moonlight Youth, and surrounding dakinis Ekajati six sisters, fourteen servant women, fifty-eight assistant women, and assistants hundred-thousand ten-thousand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable dakini retinue.
From Bhagavan's mind emanated retinue, Vajra Holder in hand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable wrathful retinue. Garab Dorje, etc., surrounded by immeasurable human retinue. Turning result Secret Mantra unsurpassed Dharma wheel to retinue, peaceful emanation body bodhisattvas liberated. All have wrathful frowning faces.
That palace is extremely vast. Those faculties' end persons...
Emaho! Don't be shocked by these terrifying images! This is describing the fierce aspect of wisdom—the energy that cuts through delusion. The charnel ground isn't a place—it's the recognition that all appearances are impermanent, all concepts dead. The wrathful deities aren't enemies—they're your own awareness in its most powerful form!
[15605-15634] 
Listen! Astonished and amazed, born into emanation body's field realms, merely so it is said. These too, from Bhagavan Vajra Holder's blessings, naturally arranged, therefore called "nature emanation fields." Those fields' continuities—from heart's mirror-like etc., pristine awareness jewel self-clear self-radiance, and in skull house, wrathful mandala, primordially abiding appearance, arise. Appearance to retinue, faculties' objects seen capable cause, and liberation certain cause, should be known as that.
### From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle
From Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod: "Faculties' end ones, nature emanation body field, exhaling breath—twenty-fourth chapter." Having extensively explained ground and path stages of Secret Supreme certain liberation through crucial points, now ascertaining where accomplished by that method, perfected ultimate result stage in two: General presentation of manifestly awakening in internal expanse primordially pure ground. Specifically explaining appearance-modes of body and pristine awareness from spontaneously accomplished luminous clarity ground-appearance.
First has three: Held by liberation place's essence. Explained separately nature of how liberated. Ascertaining body and pristine awareness ground-appearance. First: Self-arisen awareness naturally pure, pure by all adventitious stains, two purities possessed Dharmakaya, non-dual expanse and pristine awareness primordially pure jewel secret womb is ultimate liberation place.
From Self-Arising Awareness: "Liberation place is primordially pure appearance. Like vase body example." "All Buddhas' deliverance place is primordially pure great mandala." From Jewel Heap: "Result Dharmakaya emptiness, entities exhausted, very wonderful."
This is the completion ground! Every being has this nature—just obscured. Liberation isn't going somewhere else—it's recognizing what's always been. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life!
[15635-15640] 
Listen! From Pearl Garland: "Liberation place itself is primordial." Thus. In primordial primordial purity, awareness knowing own face, not returning to cause, confusion ground exhausted, name changes to 'result.' From previously explained ground context in detail, should be known as distinguished by being free from stains.
[15641-15661] 
Second has three: Actual mode of liberation in expanse. Nature of abiding in expanse. How suchness intent expanse coils in expanse. First: When sharp, dull, medium faculties liberate, no difference in result. All three times' Buddhas, Dharmakaya beyond expression, intention exhausted, one in that, face-equal without difference nature, sole bindu Buddha. Whether in this life with remainder, or in bardo self-appearance held, or exhaling breath in emanation field. Path-appearance body and pristine awareness appearance external clear aspects, spontaneously dissolving into expanse, like light gathering inside crystal, appearance liberated into emptiness, pristine awareness dissolving into expanse, form body passing beyond sorrow in Dharmakaya expanse, thing and mark non-existent sky-like suchness, one taste like space dissolving into space.
Example: Awareness cut separate from expanse, abiding in body like space inside vase, related to great space through vase's opening. Four Lamps connect with primordial primordially pure. When vase breaks, external-internal-intermediate three spaces non-dual, one essence abiding. Body-mind separated, five awarenesses without external-internal gap, great internal expanse primordially pure great abiding.
From Six Expanses: "In Samantabhadra state, all elaborations completely pacified, unrivaled Buddha, all dharmas' eye dust free." Seeing fields everywhere limitless, external-internal appearance non-dual mixed, obtaining completely pure expanse intent.
Emaho! This is the great liberation! The five awarenesses become the five wisdoms. The body becomes the mandala. Space inside and outside the vase is never different—only the walls made it seem separate. Your nature and the nature of all Buddhas is the same space!
[15662-15677] 
Listen! At that time, samsara itself is called "cut from beginning and end." Thus. Like space mixed, or external appearance self-light rays dissolving into expanse, sun setting, rays gathering into themselves. Like water dissolving into water, butter into butter. From Blazing Body Relic: "Then in essence primordially pure, like sun's rays gathering, self-appearance including emanation, own essence self-dissolved, without division, without dividing becomes. Like water dissolving into water, thus butter into butter, space dissolving into space, non-dual, without certain grasping becomes." Thus.
[15678-15699] 
At that time, dissolving into primordially pure internal expanse, awareness holds own place, becoming Victor Unchanging Light Buddha, perfect authority teacher Samantabhadra Pristine Awareness Spontaneously Accomplished Protector Vajra Holder. Path dharmas exhausted by obtaining result. Result dharmas, like full moon's increase and decrease, completely perfected, no going beyond that, reaching exhaustion place.
From Self-Arising: "Realized person with intelligence, dissolving into unchanging equality state. Conception-free wisdom self-dawns. In that great piled bliss ground, like unarranged jewel heap, variously arising and naturally dissolving. All Buddhas' ancestor, unchanging light, universally renowned." Thus.
From Six Expanses: "Memory-knowings, when passing beyond sorrow, expression's extremes all self-self-dissolved. Aggregates, ayatanas, elements passing beyond sorrow, all apparent existence appears as bliss field. Faculties and objects passing beyond sorrow, supreme mudra's great enjoyment self-appears. Sounds and words, at passing beyond sorrow time, transcending all appearance. View-meditation-action result, at passing beyond sorrow time, effortful memory self-dissolved. Dharmas and wisdom passing beyond sorrow, divine bodies unobservable, covered by seal."
This is the completion! Everything dissolves into its true nature—not destroyed, but recognized. Samsara was never other than nirvana. The apparent world becomes the pure field. This is not future—it's the nature right now!
[15700-15710] 
Listen! When experience passes beyond sorrow, byung tshor's door also self-self-ceases. Heat and signs self-dissolved, when passing beyond sorrow, afflictions self-dissolved, emptied. Person practicing this exhaustion dharma, developed and self-completed. Whoever sees this essence-abiding capable person, this is Samantabhadra's essence—own nature of all Buddhas' result. Whoever becomes familiar with all Buddhas' result, becomes glorious Vajra holder. First protector, stainless pure, from light womb self-arisen, all Buddhas' activity nature, obtains great secret supreme body. From that non-reversing, yogi with intelligence and power, capable, reaching all result's extent, equal to Samantabhadra. Thus.
[15711-15735] 
Such primordially pure own face, free from existence-nonexistence extremes, body and pristine awareness appearance transcending existence-nonexistence. Ground-appearance merely non-ceased—like crystal own face, light and color nowhere established. From that state, five lights' ground-appearance non-ceased.
From Thal 'gyur: "Though result cannot be expressed, dharmas reaching exhaustion place, own establishment's extreme also destroyed. At this time, lama's pith instruction hidden. View-meditation-action's extremes empty, dharma appearance non-existent. Body and pristine awareness continuity cut. No Buddha, no sentient being. Briefly, nothing abiding. Without going, no coming." Thus.
From Six Expanses: "Thus in suchness primordially pure, no pristine awareness, no body either. Without light, free from colors. Essence nowhere established, ignorance and afflictions—what need to mention? Non-existent." Thus.
Thus internal expanse primordially pure nature, only ground-appearance...
Emaho! This is the radical Dzogchen view! At the ultimate level, even Buddha and sentient beings are not established. Not nihilism—it's the freedom from all concepts, all grasping. The path exhausts itself, like a fire exhausting its fuel. What's left? The natural state, beyond description!
Listen! Actually nowhere established as anything. From that itself: "In nature's appearance, no mark-grasping at all. Not color, self-clear, knowing and awareness aspects only. Without grasping's held object, no conception's grasping aspect. In light-transcending self-radiance, primordially abiding distinguished. In body-transcending self-radiance, completely pure great mudra abiding." Thus.
Emaho! Don't grasp at experiences! The clear light, the bliss, the visions—these are all marks if you grasp them. The true nature is beyond light and dark, beyond form and formless. Like space doesn't need light to be space, your nature doesn't need experiences to be complete!
Second, nature of awareness abiding in expanse has five: Elements Mama Zhayog. Dissolving into pristine awareness expanse. Wisdom elevating to sky. Coiling in luminous clarity expanse. Awareness holding own place. First: Three wombs gathered as one, five elements liberated below, unobstructed to pure pristine awareness eye. That too, when impure confusion appearance dissolves into pure suchness, flesh-blood body dissolves into luminous illusory body, then that itself dissolves into Dharmakaya jewel secret body. Wisdom eye dissolves into pristine awareness eye, that itself dissolves into suchness eye, object and knower activity completely pure. In jewel secret womb, internally clear pristine awareness intent, without transfer or change.
From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Impure confusion appearance obscures pristine awareness appearance. Confusion appearance ceases, pure appearance dawns. Latency womb obscures pristine awareness illusory body. Abandoning this body, light appearance dawns. Then reaches jewel womb's end. Three wombs gathered as one, emanation in ten directions accomplished." Thus.
Present body's five elements' dregs purified. If calculated as separately abiding in primordially pure internal expanse luminous clarity five great elements' expanse, impure elements actually become pure elements or abiding as Mama Zhayog, not so.
This is the completion of the path! The body dissolves, not into nothing, but into light. The elements transform into wisdom. Don't fear this dissolution—it's the natural completion, like ice becoming water, water becoming vapor, vapor becoming space!
