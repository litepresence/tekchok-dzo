[14738-14776] 
Listen! Non-reversing certainty obtained. Dissolution not held's time there, emanation dividing. Emanation days however dividing, that much abiding, then emanation also sun setting time rays gathering-like, awareness gathering, primordially pure ground dissolving. Wisdom subtle analyzing, this too crucial point great understanding existing.
Second, medium faculties seven's liberation manner, five instants. From Blazing Body Relic: Suchness bardo, instant liberation. Thus said. First instant, own appearance various dawns. Second, seen. Third, that state momentary consciousness held. Fourth, self-appearance realizing, truth's power obtained. Fifth, primordially pure liberation. Liberated, not dissolved's gap there, emanation divides. Emanation days samadhi's days one. Five instants and samadhi's days each joined, appearance's liberation manner shown.
From Self-Arising: Some five lights expanse liberated. Some five bodies expanse liberated. Some five bindus liberated. Some mirror expanse liberated. Some garland expanse liberated. Some upper-lower bindus liberated. Some garland empty liberated. That is medium's liberation manner.
That too thus: Medium certainty establishing, seven days certainty obtained. That too five days bindu appearance abiding. One day dharmadhatu abiding. One day mirror pristine awareness abiding. That too own heart from body one arisen. From that bodies countless radiating. That own consciousness awakening, power becoming, again shooting star-like. Emanation also twenty-six days capable of benefit.
Emaho! The five instants of liberation! Recognition can be that fast—if you're prepared. Don't think you need days or weeks—an instant of pure recognition is enough. The "emanation" that follows is natural compassion, not a return to confusion!
[14781-14820] 
Listen! Also own above, pristine awareness body variously radiating one seen. That certainty obtaining. That too shooting star-like. Emanation twenty-seven days capable of benefit.
Middle's supreme: Nine days needed. Again gathered five days. Pristine awareness four days. Then again certainty obtaining. Whatever appearing all mirror-like realizing, seeing, stability obtained. Emanation also thirty days capable of benefit.
Middle's excellent: Ten days needed. Again gathered five. Pristine awareness four days. Spontaneously accomplished appearance one day, then those bodies all non-dual realizing, Buddha. Emanation also thirty-one days capable of benefit.
Middle's excellent: Eleven days needed. Again gathered five. Pristine awareness five. Spontaneously accomplished one abiding. Then again certainty obtaining, all appearances light-house seeing, certainty obtained. Emanation also thirty-four days capable of benefit.
Middle's middle: Twelve days needed. Again gathered five. Separate body wrathful field ground one. Pristine awareness five days. Spontaneously accomplished one day abiding. Then certainty obtaining, stability obtained. Emanation also thirty-seven days capable of benefit.
Middle's end: Thirteen days needed. Again gathered upper-lower six. Pristine awareness five. Spontaneously accomplished two abiding. Then whatever appearing butter-lamp mandala-like seeing, certainty obtained. Emanation also thirty-nine days capable of benefit.
Emaho! The days are metaphorical—they represent stages of recognition, not calendar time! Some recognize quickly, some slowly. The "gathered" days are periods of confusion. The key is that liberation is possible at any stage—don't give up!
[14825-14876] 
Listen here, you who get stuck in the details of liberation! Longchenpa teaches something crucial about "self-appearance recognizing" - but you might miss the forest for the trees!
First, the seven accomplishments: "Twenty-first, primordially pure liberation" - do you hear the beauty of this? It's not number 21 in a sequence! It's "primordially pure" - liberation that was never stained to begin with! Not achieved through practice, but recognized as always already pure!
"Not dissolved's gap there, emanation opened, primordially pure dissolved" - Three ways recognition can happen: through dissolution of barriers, through opening of display, through recognizing primordial purity. These aren't stages - they're how awareness naturally manifests!
"Though twenty-one instants equal, samadhi's days many few existing, faculties sharp-dull posited." When recognition happens, time collapses! Twenty-one instants equal - because in rigpa, past and future don't exist separately. "Samadhi's days many few existing" - this describes natural abiding, not technical meditation achievement!
[14877-14892] 
Now the five colors liberation - oh, how students love to make this complicated! "Some white color liberated...some five colors liberated." Longchenpa is listing the natural display of awareness as it purifies itself. But then comes the master's warning: "That is end's Liberation manner!"
Don't you see the pattern? First liberation through self-appearance, then liberation through colors. But the colors correspond to the five Buddha families - this isn't about becoming all five Buddhas! It's about how your own awareness displays itself in different aspects!
"End faculties' liberation manner thus: End ground held, fourteen days needed, that too gathered upper-lower six, pristine awareness five, spontaneously accomplished three days abiding's end, own appearance seeing, Buddha." Listen carefully! This is describing different approaches based on capacities. Some need fourteen days (less capacity), some need just three days (higher capacity). But the result is always "own appearance seeing, Buddha" - recognizing your own face!
"Emanation also forty days capable of benefit" - When you recognize your own nature, the natural capacity to benefit others emerges spontaneously. Not something you develop, but what radiates naturally when recognition stabilizes!
Emaho! The colors of self-liberation aren't achievements - they're the natural display of your own awareness purifying itself!
[14867-14890] 
Listen! Spontaneously accomplished three days abiding's end, own appearance seeing, stability obtained. Emanation also fifty days capable of benefit. End's middle: Nineteen days needed. Again gathered, twelve days needed. Four pristine awarenesses abide. Sentient beings' faculties all Buddha ground obtained. Those bardos also dream-like.
End's end, that nature emanation birth, here liberation's category explained. Those faculties' liberation manner—crucial point great, should be known.
Fourth general meaning: Existence intermediate, karma's continuation yawning gap fox inserting-like pith instruction in two: Pith instruction's indication manner briefly shown. Intermediate's own face extensively explained.
First: Existence intermediate dream-like appearance, instant unobstructed object entering, instant former self-ceasing, dissolving, not identified. Now direct appearance clear, yet wavering confused dissolving, wherever thought object, instant traveling miracle existing time. This door seeing ones, intermediate's self-appearance recognizing coming, ten directions emanation field mind-made merely, suchness truth's blessings there born, bardo without Buddha.
This's preliminary pith instruction: Now awareness eye or Brahma's aperture from light's ball focusing, shooting star running-like projecting. That time's pith instruction: Field remembering, east etc., awareness naturally projecting.
This door not seen's migrating beings usual, Dharma trained ones, illusory body grasping. Non-existence training. Pure field mind-making, liberation possible, individual's practice texts arising like. Not Dharma habituated ones, pure field aspiration praying.
Emaho! Even in the bardo there's hope! If you recognize self-appearance, you can still be liberated or reach a pure realm. The "yawning gap" is the bardo—don't fall into it unconsciously! Train now to recognize awareness, and the transition becomes liberation, not just another rebirth!
[14891-14938] 
Listen! Refuge going. Womb door bad, turning back. Good choosing.
From Golden Rosary: "Confusion existence's mere aspect. Self-appearance natureless appearing. Self-appearance natureless knowing. Emanation remembering self-liberated." Thus.
Second, extensive explanation has twenty: Circling manner. Definition. Characteristics. Clairvoyance. Miracles. Life measure. Color. Head's looking way. Karma accumulating not accumulating's difference. Karma's signs. Name's enumerations. Body's measure. Birth place identifying. Activity's difference. Light's measure. Karma connection's difference. Next body and afflictions' connection manner. Three realms which included's difference. Next womb entering signs. Example near indication.
First, circling manner's difference: This door not seen or seen yet not confident and not taken into experience ones, for suchness bardo short. Self-appearance not recognizing, existence bardo again and again distracted. Flesh-blood self-grasping form non-existent, yet formerly body self-grasping habituated latency, dream body-like, all faculties complete, flesh form flawless existing-existing-like appearance arising. Former arisen existence's flesh form possessor. All faculties complete, unobstructed possessing. Same class divine eye pure seeing. Irreversible, that is smell-eater. Thus aspect labeled, explained. Flesh form and faculties self-characteristic existing, body taken, actually become, bardo and contradictory.
Therefore, arising basis mark-possessing body free, mind's existence name and four elements seed-aspect depending, body entering near, illusory body name two-possessing. Ground not held, karma all moving, circling.
Second, definition: Suchness appearance setting and six families' body actually not taken between appearance, thus intermediate called. That two joined's middle itself identified.
Emaho! Twenty aspects of the bardo! Longchenpa is being thorough so you have no doubt. The key points: you have clairvoyance but limited control, you're drawn by karma and attachment, and you don't recognize your own nature. But remember—all of this is appearance, empty, natureless. Recognize that, and you're free!
[14939-14970] 
Listen! Some god-human birth existence. Some lower migrations birth existence. Some liberation existence called. Intermediate existence called. Third, characteristics: Intermediate gap however abiding, upper half former's aspect. Lower half, later wherever born, that body and clothes and ornaments etc. existing thought, like dream's characteristics.
That too, god-human birth taken, that aspect. Form realm birth, first light body existing thought. Formless upward birth time, formless, aspect not arising, yet sky and mere wind appearance from birth. Formless from lower realm transferring time, half former's samadhi and mere wind self-emanated samadhi's aspect other non-existent. Half later, wherever born's aspect arising.
Demi-god and lower migrations three, that aspect arising. Unrelenting birth, passing through, no bardo. Likewise upward passing through and phowa projected, birth place wherever passing through, bardo not seen. Others intermediate path make.
Fourth, clairvoyance: Former suchness intermediate's clairvoyance aspect latency here existing, by its power former abiding world that vessel-essence's extent and height and measure and creation-destruction etc. and later birth place that vessel-essence's characteristics all instant mirror image arisen like seeing, known. Thus later abode whatever born there desiring and aspiring, born. God-human realm seeing, attachment, there birth. Demi-god and animal's forests and lake islands beautiful seeing, there birth. Hell hungry ghost's abode also light rays clear fire's appearance beautiful, attachment-like seeing, gone thought from birth. Briefly, whatever birth's abode that beautiful and joyful seeing.
Emaho! Your own desires create your destination! See beautiful realms, want to go there, and you're pulled there by attachment. Even hell can look beautiful through delusion. This is crucial—what you perceive depends on your karma and latencies. Train your mind now to recognize purity everywhere!
[14971-14996] 
Listen! Enemy chasing, refuge seen, there hidden mind moment attached, birth taken. That too, desire realm birth all, mind attachment's obvious power arisen, object great longing arising. Form realm birth, coarse appearance anger, light longing arising. Formless birth, no appearance whatsoever longing, mere nothing-existing mind abiding, joy arising. Vessel-essence appearance also mere instant, then latency set great power ceases.
Here clairvoyance arising's cause: Suchness seed existing, here obscuring body self-grasping non-existent, suchness above seeing's blessings arising.
Fifth, miracles: Faculties clear, body perfect appearing, like dream flying etc., sky going, consciousness wherever focused, there enters. Small, needle-eye and horse-drum's crack inside also enters. Great, horse-elephant and mountain-rock and sky also enters, form great-small uncertain sentient being becoming. Earth water fire wind mountain-rock etc. all passing through. Four elements' harm not struck. Whatever element entering capacity existing, rock's inside etc. and egg's inside sentient beings coming—crucial point. This time, vajra seat and mother's womb except, whatever unobstructed. Same class and divine eye possessors except, that not seen, by that sentient beings' abode classes all seen.
This miracle's continuum: From above Sambhogakaya's miracle seeing aspect arising. That too, instant arisen, again ceases, sets, other appearance arising. Other arising time, former forgotten, not seen, like dream former-later dream that not remembering. Sixth, life's measure...
Emaho! In the bardo you have powers—pass through matter, see other realms, travel instantly. But these are not "yours"—they're the natural capacities of the mind unbound by physical body. Don't get fascinated by them! Use them to recognize the nature of mind or reach a pure realm.
[14997-15032] 
Listen here, you who fear the bardo! Longchenpa explains something profound about the intermediate state - but you might miss the essential point while counting days!
"These twenty appearance-birth modes complete in seven days." The master isn't giving you a timetable of rebirth! He's describing how consciousness naturally manifests in different ways. But students immediately start counting: "If no life from that? Again latency's power!"
Look at this profound teaching: "Intermediate existence that life, seven days passed, exhausted. If no life from that? Again latency's power, former appearance awakened, mind body taken, seven times die." Do you understand? The bardo isn't some waiting room - it's the natural capacity of your mind to create new experiences! "Seven times die" means consciousness can project itself seven times before exhausting its momentum.
[15033-15065] 
"Seven times birth appears, like dream's birth-death." This is crucial! Like dreams appearing and disappearing each night - not because you're really dying and reborn, but because consciousness naturally displays itself! "Seven births also miraculously born" - consciousness can manifest without karmic momentum when conditions align!
"Death and birth all done in instant" - This is the key! In bardo, birth and death aren't sequential like in life. They happen simultaneously - instant manifestations of consciousness projecting and withdrawing.
"If virtue's power applied, seven sevens' seven periods greatly beneficial." When you apply practice during bardo, you're not accumulating merit for future rebirth - you're purifying the very momentum of consciousness itself!
[15066-15098] 
Now the colors of rebirth - listen carefully! "Later whatever born body's sign appearing. God-human birth, white. Demi-god and animal birth, yellow. Hungry ghost birth, smoke-like. Hell birth, black wool scattered-like." These aren't literal descriptions! White for god realm isn't about skin color - it's the purity of divine birth. Yellow isn't demi-gods being yellow - it's the quality of desire-energy manifesting!
"Seventh, color: Later whatever born body's sign appearing." By the seventh time, if you still haven't recognized nature, karmic patterns reassert themselves strongly. The color that appears indicates the predominant karmic tendency pulling consciousness toward particular realm!
[15099-15132] 
"This continuum: From above Sambhogakaya's color and hand-emblem seeing." The signs aren't random - they're your own sambhogakaya wisdom recognizing where consciousness is heading! But the crucial teaching: "Seventh, color: Later whatever born body's sign appearing" - if after seven cycles you still haven't awakened, the momentum strengthens.
Emaho! The bardo lasts at most forty-nine days - not because it's limited, but because your consciousness has that much natural momentum. But if you recognize mind's nature during any of these appearances, you're instantly liberated - no more counting days!
