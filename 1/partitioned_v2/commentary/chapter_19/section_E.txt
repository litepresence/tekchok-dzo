[17227-17230] 
Listen to this dedication! "Possessing a garland of lightning of the great cloud of excellent explanation, the rain of nectar of words and meaning falls from the path of the mind's sky." Longchenpa is saying: this text is like a storm of blessings!
The excellent explanation (*legs bshad*) is the great cloud (*sprin chen*). The hearing (*thos pa*) is the lightning (*glog*) that illuminates. From the sky of mind (*yid mkha'*), the rain of nectar (*bdud rtsi'i char*) falls. This fulfills the hopes of all beings without exception, increases the merit and harvest, and with the prosperity of the Victorious Ones, fills all beings with satisfaction, dispelling the poverty of existence and peace.
This is how you close a Dharma text—not with "The End" but with "May all benefit!" Every word written, every page composed, becomes an offering to all beings. This is the bodhisattva vow in action.
[17231-17238] 
The elements of all directions, as long as embodied beings remain—may this treasury of holy Dharma remain and accomplish limitless benefit and happiness! May the world and all beings, blissful and prosperous like the god realms, all abide on the path of liberation and simultaneously attain Buddhahood!
These aren't empty wishes. When a master like Longchenpa dedicates merit, it has power. He's not just hoping—he's establishing a connection, a field of merit that extends through time and space to benefit beings far into the future. Including you, right now, reading this.
[17239-17242] 
May all sentient beings, completely victorious over existence, without effort attain nirvana! May samsara be emptied and the grove of peace expand! May they become Dharma Kings of spontaneously accomplished twofold benefit!
The twofold benefit (*don gnyis*) is benefit for self and benefit for others. This is the mark of a Buddha—not just personal liberation, but the capacity to liberate all beings. And Longchenpa dedicates his work toward this end for all.
[17243-17246] 
Through this supreme virtue, the source of benefit and happiness, may the Buddha's teachings spread and expand! May the glory of the jewel of limitless qualities blaze! May the holy Dharma of luminosity-heart essence expand!
He's dedicating to the preservation and spread of the teachings. Not just his own text, but the entire Dharma. This is vast mind—beyond personal achievement, beyond sectarian concerns, toward the welfare of all beings through the preservation of the teachings.
[17247-17250] 
Leading limitless beings to the ground of near-peace with limitless life, beautified by forests, lakes, islands, flower-medicine realms everywhere, possessing eyes, clairvoyance, and concentration that discover unprecedented Dharma treasures, may they be filled with the fame and praise, the sound of drums, worshipped by Brahma and others, kinnaras!
This is pure land imagery—the vision of a world transformed by Dharma. But it's not just imagination; it's the result of practice. When you cultivate virtue, when you dedicate merit, you create the causes for such a world to manifest. This is how reality is shaped—through intention, through dedication, through the power of virtue.
[17251-17258] 
Transcending the path of the thousand-light-ray doer, infinitely vast, praised by the Victorious Ones as the ornament of the world, the supreme medicinal eye—through whatever auspiciousness beautifies all beings, falling like rain as praise-songs and flowers, may this supreme Dharma system fill the realms with an ocean of auspiciousness!
May my activity, establishing an ocean of bliss-joy completely, be like that, maturing the ocean of beings dwelling in hundreds of oceans, pleasing them all!
Longchenpa is dedicating his merit to span countless realms, countless eons, countless beings. This isn't modesty—this is the natural expression of realized mind. When you realize the nature of reality, your benefit for beings becomes as vast as space itself.
[17259-17262] 
Those whose wisdom and concentration are as vast as the sky-expanse, whose thought and conduct are vast oceans, immeasurable, vast in benefiting others, whose luminosity sun-moon appearance is vast, whose activities are vast, whose unchanging dharma-nature appearance enters the vast dharmadhatu—may they all!
This is the final dedication. Vastness upon vastness. The realized mind isn't small, isn't limited, isn't constrained by ordinary conceptions. It's as vast as space, as deep as the ocean, as luminous as the sun and moon.
This is what you've been reading. This is what Longchenpa offers. Don't let it be just words—let it transform your mind into this same vastness!
[17263-17270] 
Look at this image Longchenpa paints! Just as in the clear night sky, the moon (*ri bong 'dzin zer can*—the one holding the rabbit, i.e., the moon with its rabbit-shaped mark) radiates light, and the constellations fill the mandala at the center, causing the kunda flower groves to bloom—just so, this text radiates wisdom light!
The hundred rays of the heart essence (*snying po'i 'od brgya pa*) illuminate the sky of intelligence, the hundred-fold array of primordial wisdom's clear radiance. This is what you've been reading—not mere words, but light itself! The excellent path of the vajra heart essence becomes visible, causing the lotus of good fortune's intelligence to bloom.
Don't you see? The Dharma isn't a book you read—it's light that illuminates your mind. When you encounter these teachings, when you really let them in, the lotus of your own wisdom nature opens. That's the point of all of this!
[17271-17278] 
From the grove of lotuses of the supreme vehicle's heart essence, these various self-liberated yogis are born. Having taught the meaning of luminosity-heart essence, the Stainless Light Ray Thousand (*dri med 'od zer stong ldan*)—this is Longchenpa himself speaking through his composition—has gone forth.
All the key points of the secret nature, without exception, he has shown directly and unmistakenly to those with fortune. Klong chen rab 'byams bzang po—Longchenpa's name, "Vast Expanse Good Infinite"—he is the one who taught this. Tshul khrims blo gros bzang po (Longchenpa's full ordination name), in this manner, in this very year—he proclaims it!
This is the master's seal. He's not hiding. He's saying: I, Longchenpa, composed this. I stand behind it. The teachings are authentic, direct, complete.
[17279-17282] 
To those dwelling now and those coming in the future, to those fortunate ones who follow in later generations—with these key instructions of ultimate meaning (*mthar thug don gyi gnad*), with these intimate oral instructions (*gdams zin*), strive in practice! Apply yourself with diligence!
This isn't a casual suggestion. Longchenpa is looking through time, speaking directly to YOU, centuries later. He's saying: Don't just read this—practice it! The instructions are here, complete. What are you waiting for?
[17283-17290] 
The secret treasury is extremely vast. The tantras, scriptures, and oral instructions are numerous. The vajra treasury is deep and difficult to realize. Therefore, this supreme vehicle treasury, gathering all their meanings, is precious.
Having pleased the glorious protector, the holy guru, these profound treasuries are gathered here without error. The ocean-vast expanse of scripture, reasoning, and oral instruction—this place profound and vast is supreme and exalted.
Longchenpa is telling you: I didn't make this up. This comes from the vast ocean of the Buddha's teachings, the guru's blessings, the profound treasury. This is authentic transmission, not intellectual fabrication.
[17291-17294] 
From now on, do not show this to those without fortune. Do not discuss these uncommon philosophical positions in gatherings. Do not alter or change these words!
This is the seal of secrecy—not to hide the Dharma, but to protect it from misunderstanding. The teachings of Dzogchen are powerful. In the wrong hands, they become objects of debate, intellectual games, or worse. Keep them sacred. Preserve them purely.
[17295-17298] 
This treasury is entrusted to the glorious consort of mantra (*sngags kyi bdag mo*), to the great lay practitioner of the planets Rahu (*gza' yi dge bsnyen chen po rA hu la*), to the protector Damchen Dorje Legpa. Protect it! Guard it as the command of the Buddha!
These are the protectors of the text. In Tibet, texts are entrusted to dharmapalas—protectors who ensure the teachings remain pure and available to suitable recipients. This is how seriously Longchenpa takes this work.
[17299-17302] 
If in this there are errors, omissions, additions, or discrepancies in the source text—let the blood of their heart play as a festival of joy! Let their breath be cut off, their vitality stolen, their eyes and hearts cast on the ground!
Strong words! But this is traditional—protecting the text from corruption. Longchenpa is saying: May anyone who distorts these teachings face the consequences. This ensures the purity of the transmission across generations.
[17303-17306] 
By the ocean assembly of the oath-bound guardians of the vidyadharas' command, bless those fortunate ones who practice this! Having completed all wishes and desires, may they awaken to Buddhahood in the primordial ground!
This is the final dedication. Not just for the author, but for you, the practitioner. May you be blessed. May your practice succeed. May you realize the ultimate nature, right where you are, in the primordial ground of being.
This is the end of the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle. What a journey! Don't let it end here—let it begin here.
[17307-17310] 
Ah, here we are! Look at this—Longchenpa is signing his name to the work, but not with pride, with devotion. "Rab gsal blo gros"—the one with brilliant intelligence, stainless, following the noble path. He's describing himself through his qualities, not his ego. This is how a true master speaks: through the Dharma, not about himself.
And look who he's offering this to: "mang thos yon tan shin tu rgya che"—those who have heard much, whose qualities are vast, who desire awakening in one lifetime. This is you! If you've made it to this page, if you've held this text in your hands, if these words have entered your ears—Longchenpa wrote this for you. This supreme vehicle, this door to the unsurpassable—he placed it as a treasure (*mdzod*) right here, as ornament for the crown of faith.
Emaho! Like the jewels of the naga kings, this text is precious beyond measure. It doesn't belong in a dusty library—it belongs in your heart!
[17311-17314] 
Listen to these praises! The speech of the Buddha, stainless qualities, the peak of unsurpassable vehicles—this is the secret treasury of the Victorious Ones (*rgyal ba'i gsang mdzod*), wondrous and amazing. This treasury of jewels is difficult to manifest in the world. But here it is, appearing before you!
Like the udumbara flower that blooms once in an age—wondrous and rare—this text appears for those with fortune (*skal bzangs*). And whoever hears this, whoever holds it, whoever lets it penetrate their mind—they are the great bodhisattvas of the final existence. This isn't exaggeration! This is the power of the Dharma. Just to encounter this teaching plants the seed of liberation.
[17315-17318] 
White Dharma shining vast, adorned with the auspicious mandala of sun and moon—this is the offering. Space and time, the secret peak of the Victorious Ones, auspicious light rays equal to the limits of space—this is the vision. Buddha activity without limit, fulfilling all hopes and desires—this is the prayer. The piled-up auspiciousness of the glorious sun of auspiciousness—may there be auspiciousness in all times!
Don't skip over these verses as mere poetry. This is the completion, the sealing of the work. When you finish a great Dharma text, you dedicate the merit. You don't just close the book and walk away—you offer it to all beings. This is the bodhisattva path in action.
[17319-17324] 
"The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Jewel Treasury"—this is its name. Through limitless, immeasurable Dharma topics, the meaning of the result is definitively established. This place of unexcelled secret essence, luminosity, vajra heart—this is what you've been reading. This vast collection of the Tathagata's speech, the ocean of philosophical positions of self and other transcended—this is the work of the Omniscient Lord of Speech (*kun mkhyen ngag gi dbang po*), Longchenpa himself.
Completed! (*rdzogs so*)
Take a moment. Breathe. You've reached the end of one of the most profound texts ever written in Tibetan Buddhism. Not just read it—completed it. This is a milestone in your spiritual life. Don't let it pass unnoticed.
[17325-17327] 
Dge'o! Dge'o! Dge'o! Virtue! Virtue! Virtue!
Three times he proclaims it. Not just "good luck"—this is the celebration of merit. Each time you encounter the Dharma, virtue arises. Each time you practice, virtue increases. Each time you realize, virtue is perfected.
[17328-17330] 
And finally, the Dharani of Dependent Origination in Sanskrit:
*Om ye dharma hetu prabhava hetun tesam tathagato hyavadat*
*tesam ca yo nirodha evam vadi mahasramanah*
"Of all phenomena that arise from causes, the Tathagata has taught their cause, and their cessation too—thus speaks the Great Shramana."
This is the seal, the authentication. Everything that arose in this text arose from causes—the cause being Longchenpa's wisdom and compassion. And now it is complete. The work is done.
But for you? Now the real work begins. This isn't the end—it's the beginning. Take what you've learned and practice it. Turn knowledge into realization. Don't let this Treasury gather dust—let it transform your mind!
Sarva Mangalam. May all be auspicious.
