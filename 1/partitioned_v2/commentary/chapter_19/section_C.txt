[16515-16518] 
Listen here! Longchenpa is completing the discussion of Dharmakaya—the Body of Reality. Look at what he's saying: the qualities never reverse, never change, never transform! And the activity? It arises spontaneously, without cessation, abiding as the ground itself. This isn't some philosophical abstraction—this is describing your own nature!
The quote from Thal 'gyur (the consequence tradition) lays it out perfectly: Dharmakaya is body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity—all five! But don't mistake this for some cosmic administrator sitting on a throne. Body is emptiness, clarity, and signless nature. Speech is free from sound, words, and names—beyond all expression. Mind transcends thought and movement, beyond proliferation and analysis. Qualities are without coming or going, pervading expanse and pristine awareness, nature unalterable. Activity is unarisen, unborn, arising through dynamic energy without cessation, beyond created and uncreated.
Emaho! What a wonder! This is not describing something far away—this is pointing directly to what you are, right now, if you would only recognize it!
[16519-16533] 
Now we turn to the second topic: Sambhogakaya, the Enjoyment Body, explained extensively. Longchenpa gives us the structure: essence, definition, divisions, and enumerations—four aspects.
The essence-characteristic is great self-clarity, completely perfect. The way it abides is unmoving in nature—manifesting marks and examples, clear in families, unmoving. This is not some static thing—it's vibrant, luminous, yet utterly stable.
The definition of Sambhogakaya: appearing as Sambhogakaya, engaging in that very appearance, knowledge without obstruction engaging—this is it. The body is great self-clarity, vast display. Don't make it complicated! This is the radiance of your own awareness, wearing the ornaments of luminosity.
[16533-16547] 
Now the four divisions of Sambhogakaya:
1. The Body of Great Element Essence
2. The Body of All-Pervading Abiding
3. The Body of the Path of Appearance
4. The Body of Appearance for Trainees
The first: from the ground-appearance of Dharmakaya, self-arising, perfected as the body endowed with fivefold luminosity—this is the nature of ground-appearance as great elements: clarity-warmth, coolness, expansiveness, pervasiveness. Don't think this is physics! These are wisdom qualities, not material elements. The warmth of compassion, the coolness of clarity, the expansiveness of space-like mind, the pervasiveness of benefitting all.
[16547-16563] 
The second body: for all Buddhas and sentient beings alike, pervaded by light and light-dwellings, the portion manifesting. From Self-Arising: "Abiding as the heart of light for all, thought-free pure dharmadhatu, matchless sole unique one, center and circle and palace, awareness and emptiness and clarity."
This is describing the mandala of your own being! The palace is not somewhere in space—it's the space of your own awareness. The center is rigpa, the circle is its display, the palace is the dimension in which recognition occurs. Don't look for this in a thangka painting—look for it in the immediacy of your own experience!
Emaho! Like light filling a room the moment the lamp is lit, this body pervades all without effort or intention. What a wonder!
[16564-16582] 
In the expanse of light and color: mandala, retinue, individual clusters, kaya, wisdom, father, mother, body color, hand emblems, and so forth, clear. From the Secret Seed Tantra:
"On essence's appearance,
Essence kaya arises.
Like self and reflection,
Three kayas luminosity emptiness.
Not permanent, not entity,
Not severed, luminosity kaya,
Not different, without outer/inner."
This describes the nature of sambhogakaya—appearing as forms, colors, mandalas, deities, yet empty, not permanent, not different from the nature of mind itself. Like a reflection in a mirror—clearly appearing, yet without inherent existence.
[16583-16596] 
Fourth: sambhogakaya taming trainees, appearing individually as families and mandalas. Emanations divided, for trainees' power: sambhogakaya dharmakaya Vairochana Great Ocean. His manner of abiding: viewed from outside, inner clear; viewed from inside, outer clear; completely transparent, without front/back; from wherever viewed, appears showing face like that, face directions all pervading.
His pure realm: completely arranged ornament, holding sway over twenty-five world systems from lotus on palm.
Place: completely pure, thick arrangement.
Retinue: not different from himself.
Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearance.
Time: realization manifestly arisen.
This is the description of Vairochana's pure realm—not a physical place, but a dimension of pure appearance, completely clear, without inside or outside, pervading all directions.
[16597-16613] 
This self-appearance, though emanation from the perspective of looking at the primordial, is posited as sambhogakaya from the perspective of trainees looking at luminosity, perfect marks and signs.
Sambhogakaya's sambhogakaya: appearing as five family Buddhas' chiefs.
That itself's characteristic: essence different, nature one; measureless family mandalas of individual pure realms; place great Akanistha, five families of individual retinues; teaching engaging in five wisdoms of knowing; time: appearance taming expanding.
Sambhogakaya's nirmanakaya: five families' Buddhas and individual chief retinues.
That characteristic: appearance without nature, clear without conceptuality.
That pure realm: pure appearance enjoying devas and devis, inconceivable.
Place: Tushita, basis of wisdom arrangement.
Retinue: measureless Buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Time: time of awareness self-appearance.
That also: not yaksha abiding Tushita.
This clarifies the distinction—sambhogakaya appears in Akanistha, not the ordinary Tushita heaven. This is the pure dimension of wisdom, not the worldly god realm.
Emaho! Pure realms of wisdom light!
[16614-16629] 
Five families' pure realm appearances: pure by nature, self-clear appearance of five lights, engaging in great enjoyment as aspects of five wisdoms, free from all afflictions' pain.
These also, from the Ratnakuta:
"By self-clear pure sambhogakaya,
In five lights pure palace,
By speech of non-elaboration great bliss,
To five kaya families' retinues,
Non-entity pure dharmas,
From gathered five wisdoms mind, emerged,
Spread on tongue as pure light rays,
Also self-arisen six syllables,
Unspoken, shown as great self-arisen."
This is describing sambhogakaya—the enjoyment body of the Buddha. Not physical like nirmanakaya, not formless like dharmakaya, but appearing as light, as wisdom, in pure realms. The five lights are the five wisdoms. The teaching happens without words—through light, through wisdom, through spontaneous presence.
[16630-16639] 
Sambhogakaya: because essence shows Dharma as symbols, without words, thus "unspoken." Trainees hearing the six syllables' self-sound is appearing as speech, like dream words. From the Longchenpa's Six Spaces:
"From his own mouth unspoken,
Like dream characteristic,
To retinue's bodhisattvas,
Appears in wisdom analytic mind."
This is profound! Sambhogakaya teaching isn't verbal—it's direct transmission through symbols, through light, through wisdom. The "six syllables" are the essence of all mantras, appearing spontaneously.
[16640-16663] 
Fourth, extensive explanation of enumerations—from five: kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity.
Sambhogakaya's kaya: like empty-luminous rainbow.
Speech: like dream, trainees' self-appearance.
Mind: wisdom possessing characteristics, without interruption.
Qualities: complete in marks, signs, light rays' heaps; speech appearing as self-arisen syllables' appearance; mind become treasure of clairvoyance and oceanic samadhi.
Enlightened activity: turning measureless Dharma wheels without interruption.
From the Thalgyur:
"Sambhogakaya also: kaya, speech, mind,
Qualities and enlightened activity, five aspects.
Kaya: appearance without nature,
Clear and clear-maker, awareness pervading.
Speech: self-arisen self-appearance,
Emanation-gathering aspects' wheel.
Mind: without stream, seeing,
Knowing potency and intention.
Qualities: perfect marks and signs,
Intention-clear clairvoyance perfect."
This completes the picture of sambhogakaya—not a physical body, but a body of light, teaching through symbols, benefiting advanced bodhisattvas continuously.
Emaho! Enjoyment body of wisdom light!
[16672-16691] 
Essence, definitive terminology, division, enumeration—four. Essence: various, not fixed. Manner of abiding of that essence: free from attachment and fixation, samadhi mind non-conceptual nature, abiding evenly.
Definitive terminology: Emanating whatever tames whomever, thus "emanation." That itself, harmonious appearing form perfectly complete, thus "kaya."
Divided: common and uncommon systems—two. Common vehicle's famous three: from the Sutralankara:
"Craft and birth and supreme awakening—
Supreme awakening's emanation,
This Buddha emanation kaya,
Great method of liberation."
This describes nirmanakaya—the form body that appears to ordinary beings. Not fixed, not permanent, but appearing according to what's needed.
[16692-16714] 
Craft: paintings and so forth.
Birth: Buddha emanating as various forms for beings—horses, great fish, and so forth.
Supreme awakening's emanation: twelve deeds. From the Gyud Lama:
"From dharmakaya not moving,
By emanation's nature various,
Birth manifest birth,
Transferring from Tushita abode,
Entering womb and birth,
Skilled in craft abodes,
Enjoying play with queen's retinue,
Leaving home difficult practice,
Going to awakening heart,
Defeating mara hosts, perfecting,
Awakening Dharma wheel,
Together with all gods,
Always showing parinirvana,
In impure realms,
Showing abiding as long as existence."
These are the twelve deeds of the Buddha—emanations that appear according to the needs of beings, not bound by any fixed form or time.
[16715-16721] 
In this uncommon vehicle: impure emanation kaya, taming beings' emanation kaya, nature emanation kaya—three. First: hunters, butchers, and so forth, emanations.
This is profound! The Buddha appears not just in pure forms, but in impure forms too—appearing as hunters, fishermen, even criminals—to benefit beings who can only be reached in those forms. This is ultimate compassion—not holding to purity, but appearing wherever needed.
Emaho! Emanations everywhere, benefiting all!
[16729-16742] 
Akanistha, Abhirati, Glorious, Lotus Mound, Activity Perfectly Complete—five appearing as five family Buddhas, accomplishing benefit.
This also, emanations for trainees' power, nirmanakaya dharmakaya nature pure realm's teacher five families, and here in Jambudvipa, glorious great Vajradhara. His characteristics: taking birth in four types of bodies, completing thirty-six activities, accepting. His pure realm: possessing thousand three-thousand worlds' hundred billion worlds and so forth, included in one great Brahma eon.
His place: possessing thousand lotus flowers.
Retinue: beings included in four births.
Teaching: root of all pitakas, Sound Thalgyur.
Time: limitless lifespan, time of the Able One.
This describes the dharmakaya manifestation—not a physical place, but the ultimate nature itself, appearing as the five Buddha families, teaching the root tantras, with infinite retinue and timeless duration.
[16743-16748] 
Nirmanakaya sambhogakaya glorious Vajrasattva.
His pure realm: thousand three-thousand billion.
Place: meeting trainees' faculties.
Retinue: measureless eighth-ground bodhisattvas.
Teaching: definitive meaning vehicle.
Time: without fixation.
This is the sambhogakaya level—still appearing in form, but to advanced practitioners, teaching definitive meaning, not bound by time.
[16749-16758] 
Nirmanakaya's nirmanakaya: Shakyamuni and so forth. Gone forth to homelessness, enjoying his own activities. Pure realms: possessing four continents billion and so forth. Place: Vulture Peak Mountain and so forth. Retinue: common—two monk parents, two lay parents, thus four aspects, and measureless gods and humans. Uncommon retinue: measureless bodhisattvas. Teaching: various cause-effect vehicles. Time: great definite discrimination time of teaching Dharma to trainees.
This is the human-level manifestation—the historical Buddha, teaching in specific places, with specific students, in historical time.
[16759-16769] 
These also, from the Ratnakuta:
"Nirmanakaya without fixation,
From dharma-expanse, trainees' own abode,
To six realms' fortunate, awakened,
With elaboration word-speech,
Whatever faculties, all dharmas,
From mindfulness self-clear mind,
To faculties without desire, spread on tongue,
Shown as vehicles' enumeration of dharmas."
The key insight: nirmanakaya isn't fixed in one form. It appears wherever needed, to whoever is ready, teaching according to capacity. The Buddha isn't "somewhere else"—he's right here, appearing in response to your mind.
This is the magical display of enlightenment—not bound by time, place, or form, yet appearing in all times, places, and forms to benefit beings!
Emaho! Three kayas, three levels, benefiting all!
[16770-16789] 
Fourth, the extensive explanation of enumerations—from the five: kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity.
Kaya: appearing as whatever form beings believe in, each one's portion, marks and signs complete.
Speech: sixty branches' melodious sound, well-connected.
Mind: knowing how things are and how many, expansive.
Qualities: all dharmas of powers and so forth, knowing perfectly complete.
Enlightened activity: turning the Dharma wheel of five perfections, nature of outer, inner, secret three.
From the Thalgyur:
"Nirmanakaya also: kaya, speech, mind,
Qualities and enlightened activity, five aspects.
Kaya marks and signs,
Whatever trainees arise, body emanation.
Speech word-connection good,
Brahma's expanse sixty branches.
Mind by wisdom of knowables,
Abiding in intention of twofold benefit.
Qualities knowing perfectly complete,
Enlightened activity outer, inner, secret,
All activities perfectly complete,
Abide as five perfections."
This is the complete description of enlightened manifestation—not just form, but speech, mind, qualities, and activity. All five are spontaneously present, naturally complete.
[16790-16806] 
Outer five perfections:
- Perfect place: Vulture Peak Mountain
- Perfect teacher: Shakyamuni
- Perfect Dharma: various vehicles
- Perfect retinue: common and uncommon
- Perfect time: at the time of hundred-year lifespan
Inner five perfections:
- Perfect place: Akanistha
- Perfect teacher: Vajradhara
- Perfect retinue: dakinis, siddhas, bodhisattvas
- Perfect Dharma: secret mantra outer and inner dharmas
- Perfect time: time of conditions, karma, and fortune meeting
Secret five perfections:
- Perfect place: charnel ground, blazing fire mountain
- Perfect teacher: Youthful Hero Powerful
- Perfect retinue: dakinis and so forth
These describe the three levels of teaching: outer (sutra), inner (tantra), and secret (dzogchen). Each has its own context, its own teacher form, its own audience, its own Dharma, its own timing.
The key insight: the Buddha doesn't just teach one way. The teaching appears according to what's needed, where it's needed, when it's needed. This is the skillful means of enlightenment.
But don't get confused thinking these are separate teachings. They're all the same wisdom, appearing in different forms for different capacities. The essence is always the same—recognize your own nature!
Emaho! Five perfections, three levels, one wisdom!
[16807-16811] 
Dharma perfectly complete, nature Great Perfection, Secret Unexcelled Tantra essence seven—spoken at the time perfectly complete, the time of pure self-conditions. By this indicator, know that for all teacher nirmanakayas, outer, inner, and secret perfections exist as fivefold.
This is describing the conditions under which the Dharma is taught—when all factors are perfect: the teacher, the teaching, the time, the place, the audience. These aren't arbitrary; they're the spontaneous display of wisdom when conditions align.
[16812-16822] 
Second, the extensive explanation of the individual abodes of wisdom—three. Essence: self-nature of self-awareness, free from elaborations. From the Thalgyur:
"From concept-free dharma-nature self-sound,
Objectless wisdom appearance arises."
Definitive terminology also from that:
"Wisdom first arising,
By knowing, afflictions' faults purified."
This is the key insight: Wisdom isn't something you acquire; it's something you recognize. It's already present as the nature of your own awareness. When you recognize it, afflictions are naturally purified—not through force, but through seeing their true nature.
[16823-16840] 
Divided into three: Dharmakaya wisdom abiding in the basis; Sambhogakaya wisdom possessing its own characteristics; Nirmanakaya all-pervading wisdom.
First, essence, nature, compassion—three. Essence primordially pure wisdom: awareness empty-luminous, stainless, ultimate, dharmakaya free from elaborations' extremes, nature of twofold pure expanse, abiding as basis of arising of inseparable three kayas.
Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom: clear depth, light basis of arising, abiding—pure realms, palaces, light rays and so forth appear, fulfilling trainees' hopes.
Compassion all-pervading wisdom: at its own time, elaborations completely pacified, no conventional terminology of entering objects, yet abiding as basis of arising of all knowing wisdoms. From the state of great spontaneous expanse and wisdom, unmoving, without wavering, effortless exertion, seeds of beings' twofold benefit arise.
From the Longchenpa's Six Spaces:
"By essence primordially pure wisdom,
Separation from non-recognition's stain.
By nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom,
Separation from confusion's word-harm.
By compassion all-pervading wisdom,
All appears connected in one expanse."
This is the complete description of dharmakaya wisdom—three aspects, one nature. Primordially pure is the essence. Spontaneously accomplished is the nature. All-pervading compassion is the display.
Without the portion of dharmakaya emptiness' wisdom abiding in the basis, basis of arising or seed-like portion, Buddha, non-recognition awakened, upward cut off.
This is crucial! Without recognizing this dharmakaya wisdom that's already present, you can't progress on the path. It's the foundation, the seed, the basis of everything.
Emaho! Three wisdoms, one nature, complete!
[16841-16854] 
Listen carefully! Sentient beings, wandering in confusion through samsara, are cut off from the lower realms. From the unsuitability of tamer and tamed, from the wisdom abiding in the basis, they appear as external manifestation. Arising as beings' benefit throughout samsara's duration—this comes from the natural force of compassion, clear depth of knowing awareness perfect and complete.
From the Thalgyur:
"From dharmakaya emptiness' nature,
Wisdom knowing perfectly complete,
By force appears to sentient beings.
Without this, samsara-nirvana cut off—
Knowing awareness clear.
From self-knowing clear self-nature,
Natural force of compassion itself,
Not ceasing, without cessation."
This is the profound mystery! Compassion isn't something the Buddha creates or generates. It's the natural radiance, the spontaneous expression of the wisdom mind. Like light radiating from the sun without the sun "trying" to shine. The wisdom basis naturally appears as benefit for beings.
Without this force of compassion, samsara and nirvana would be cut off—there would be no connection between the ultimate nature and relative appearance. But because this wisdom-compassion is spontaneously present, the benefit of beings appears naturally, effortlessly!
[16855-16880] 
Second, the five wisdoms of sambhogakaya: possessing their own individual characteristics. For Vairochana, dharmadhatu wisdom is primary, the other four as retinue. For Akshobhya, mirror wisdom is primary. For Ratnasambhava, sameness. For Amitabha, discriminating. For Amoghasiddhi, all-accomplishing wisdom is primary—the remaining four as retinue for each. Thus twenty-five wisdoms, and from dividing those, immeasurable. Gathered, they condense into five.
From the Self-Arisen:
"Wisdom divisions thus:
From twenty-five essences,
Gathered, condense into five aspects."
How do they condense? From the Thalgyur:
"Sambhogakaya wisdoms possess characteristics,
Mirror—because pure actual objects,
Clear reflections of samsara-nirvana.
Sameness—because without direction/border.
Discriminating—shows sense-fields' objects.
All-accomplishing—not by effort.
Dharmadhatu—because without difference."
This is the mandala of wisdom! Each Buddha family has its primary wisdom and four supporting wisdoms. Five times five equals twenty-five. But it doesn't stop there—these can be subdivided infinitely, or gathered back into the five.
The key insight: these aren't separate things. Mirror wisdom reflects everything clearly without judgment. Sameness wisdom sees the equality of all phenomena. Discriminating wisdom knows the details. All-accomplishing wisdom acts without effort. Dharmadhatu wisdom is the space in which all appear.
They're all aspects of your own awareness! Stop thinking wisdom is something distant or difficult. It's the nature of your own mind.
[16881-16885] 
Third, the two wisdoms of nirmanakaya: entering to pervade all knowables. Knowing however many are included in appearance. Knowing however things are included in emptiness. Knowing all relative phenomena distinctly, without mixing, teaching according to the faculties, elements, and latent tendencies of immeasurable gatherings of trainees.
This is how the Buddha works in the world—not with one method, but with infinite skillful means. Knowing what each being needs, how they understand, what their capacity is, and teaching accordingly. This isn't effortful; it's the natural display of wisdom-compassion.
Emaho! The three kayas, the wisdoms, the compassion—all complete!
[16886-16898] 
Knowing the ultimate dharma-nature—emptiness, marklessness, luminosity—manifests the Dharma. This also from the Thalgyur:
"On nirmanakaya, knowables—
Knowing how things are,
Knows the natural state as own purpose.
Knowing how many,
Knows however trainees' minds abide.
Thus from compassion's manner of arising,
For trainees' various migrations,
Taming kayas are just that much."
Thus.
Here's the profound point: Nirmanakaya isn't separate from knowing. The emanation body appears based on knowing the natural state (how things truly are) and knowing trainees' minds (what they need). The taming kayas appear spontaneously from compassion, not from effort or contrivance.
This means the forms in which the Buddha appears—whatever forms benefit beings—are not fixed. They appear based on what needs to be tamed. Don't get attached to thinking the Buddha looks a certain way!
[16899-16922] 
The meaning of these wisdoms gathered in the three kayas, clearly summarized:
To such a Buddha, in the condition of dharmakaya, three wisdoms complete in the basis:
Essence primordially pure wisdom,
Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom,
Compassion all-pervading wisdom—
Without characteristics divided into types,
From awareness' clear portion, force or power,
Makes the basis of arising of knowing.
In the condition of sambhogakaya, the five wisdoms possessing characteristics are clear individually:
Dharmadhatu,
Mirror-like,
Sameness,
Discriminating,
All-accomplishing wisdoms—
Not object and subject, but close self-clear appearance.
At the time of nirmanakaya, two knowing wisdoms abide:
Knowing how things are and knowing how many.
These two also, with action and actor, are not—
Knowing in the manner of effortless spontaneous accomplishment.
Thus, the three wisdoms possessed by the Buddha's three kayas:
From the perspective of knowing the two—appearance and emptiness—of knowables appearing externally to nirmanakaya, all-knowing wisdom of dharma's nature peace; from the perspective of knowing self-clear appearance of sambhogakaya's close self-appearance luminosity-wisdom's knowables, all-knowing wisdom; dharmakaya inner-clear essence abiding wisdom portion merely making basis of arising.
This is sophisticated Dzogchen cosmology. Let me break it down simply:
- **Dharmakaya wisdom**: The basis, primordially pure, spontaneously present, all-pervading compassion. This is your own nature.
- **Sambhogakaya wisdom**: The five wisdoms that appear as light, as clarity, as the mandala of deities. This is the display of your nature.
- **Nirmanakaya wisdom**: The two knowings—knowing reality and knowing what beings need. This is how your nature benefits others.
They're not separate! They're three aspects of the same wisdom. When you recognize your own awareness, you recognize all three. Stop dividing them!
Emaho! Three kayas, three wisdoms, one nature!
[16923-16941] 
In the expanse of one's own primordially pure ground, self-knowing clarity—abiding in the portion of pure expanse. From the Sgron ma snang byed (Lamp Illuminating):
"To the perfect Buddha,
There are three wisdoms:
All-aspect knowing,
All-knowing wisdom,
Wisdom abiding in the basis.
Two wisdoms of nirmanakaya:
Knowing how things abide—knows the natural state,
Knowing how many—other-benefit.
Wisdom of sambhogakaya close by:
Luminosity self-appearance, knowables clear.
Wisdom of dharmakaya abiding in the basis:
Knowing portion makes clear,
No grasping, awareness-conceptuality.
Spontaneous force of compassion.
Clear and knowing, possessed of awareness,
Abiding without mixing with portions."
This is crucial! Three wisdoms:
1. **All-aspect knowing** (*rnam pa thams cad mkhyen pa*) - knowing all phenomena in all their aspects
2. **All-knowing wisdom** (*thams cad mkhyen pa'i ye shes*) - knowing the nature of all things
3. **Wisdom abiding in the basis** (*gzhi la gnas pa'i ye shes*) - primordial wisdom that never moved
Then for nirmanakaya, two wisdoms: knowing the natural state (how things are) and knowing what needs to be done for beings (how many things there are).
Sambhogakaya wisdom is the luminosity, the clear appearance of knowables.
Dharmakaya wisdom is beyond grasping, beyond conceptuality—spontaneous compassion.
These aren't separate things! They're all aspects of your own awareness. Right now, you have the capacity to know. That's wisdom. Don't look for it somewhere else!
[16942-16959] 
Third, the meaning gathering of the five—kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity—twofold: essence briefly shown, and nature extensively explained. First:
Thus, if all dharmas of the Buddha-ground are gathered: kaya inexhaustible ornament wheel, appearing with form-kaya marks and signs clear; dharmakaya possessing the nature of all elaborations completely pacified; speech inexhaustible ornament wheel, with inconceivable Dharma wheels; mind inexhaustible ornament wheel, abandonment and realization nature measureless, clairvoyance inconceivable, essence of oceanic samadhi like the great ocean; qualities inexhaustible ornament wheel, ten powers, four fearlessnesses, measureless great compassion, mindfulness and so forth; enlightened activity inexhaustible ornament wheel, spontaneously accomplishing twofold benefit for all beings pervading the reaches of space.
Just this much alone, all enumerations of dharmas of the Buddha-ground are included—know this!
Look at this! This is what Buddhahood actually is—not some far-off goal, but the inexhaustible display of your own nature. The form body with its marks, the speech that teaches, the mind of wisdom, the qualities that benefit, the activities that help beings—all spontaneously present, never exhausted, never ending.
This isn't something you need to build up. It's something you need to recognize. Right now, in your own experience, these five are present. The ground of your being IS the Buddha-ground. Stop looking elsewhere!
As it is said...
Emaho! All dharmas are complete!
From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Gyud, the Tantra of Lion Power Great Perfection:
"The kayas of the Buddhas,
Speech and mind mandala,
Qualities and enlightened activity—
Appear as five."
Thus it is taught.
This is the summary verse. Everything that appears from a Buddha—the forms, the speech, the mind, the qualities, the activities—all five are spontaneously present. Not created, not made, not cultivated. Naturally manifesting.
Second, the detailed divisions of the five—kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity. First, regarding kaya: essence, definitive terminology, division into three.
The essence of kaya: whatever is the Buddha-ground's support, without change or transformation. Definitive terminology: "kaya" because body is complete.
In the Buddha-ground, though there is neither body nor entity, names alone do not contradict. From the Ratnagotravibhaga (Dkon mchog sgron me):
"The dharmakaya is the body of the Victors.
By seeing, purifying views, one will know."
Just as it is said.
Here's the key point: Dharmakaya isn't a physical body, yet it's called "body." Sambhogakaya has no marks, yet it appears with marks. Nirmanakaya has no fixation, yet it appears in various forms. These aren't contradictions—they're the play of emptiness and appearance!
Divided: Dharmakaya free from elaborations; Sambhogakaya free from marks; Nirmanakaya free from fixation. From Tsal Dzog:
"Essence of kaya without change,
Definitive terminology of kaya possessing clear radiance,
Shown as divided into various aspects,
Possessing dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya.
Characteristic of dharmakaya free from thought,
Characteristic of sambhogakaya without clear cognition,
Characteristic of nirmanakaya showing various."
This is profound. Each kaya has its own characteristic: dharmakaya is beyond thought, sambhogakaya is beyond ordinary cognition, nirmanakaya shows variety. Yet they're not separate—they're three aspects of the same enlightened nature.
Regarding speech also: essence empty of sound, definitive terminology various Dharma heaps appearing in the expanse. Divided: the speech of great enlightened activity, appearing whatever tames whomever; Brahma's speech appearing as sixty branches; six realms' self-appearance and harmonious speech appearing according to each sound; beings' believing speech, sound satisfying the faculties; symbolic speech, making meaning understood through symbols shown; word-speech, afflictions purified through sound reaching trainees' ears.
These also are distinguished through the essential identity of nirmanakaya alone. For sambhogakaya, merely symbols. For dharmakaya, from unexpressible meaning-speech, appearance does not exist. The speech appearing as nirmanakaya is like the aspect of an echo.
Listen! Buddha speech isn't "someone talking." It's empty, yet it appears. It's like an echo—sound without a source. It appears in whatever form is needed to benefit beings. Sometimes as formal teaching, sometimes as ordinary conversation, sometimes as symbols, sometimes just as words. All are Buddha speech when recognized!
Emaho! The kayas, speech, and mind are complete!
