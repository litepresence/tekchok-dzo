[15736-15748] 
Listen! Actually nowhere established as anything. From that itself: "In nature's appearance, no mark-grasping at all. Not color, self-clear, knowing and awareness aspects only. Without grasping's held object, no conception's grasping aspect. In light-transcending self-radiance, primordially abiding distinguished. In body-transcending self-radiance, completely pure great mudra abiding." Thus.
Emaho! Don't grasp at experiences! The clear light, the bliss, the visions—these are all marks if you grasp them. The true nature is beyond light and dark, beyond form and formless. Like space doesn't need light to be space, your nature doesn't need experiences to be complete!
[15749-15773] 
Second, nature of awareness abiding in expanse has five: Elements Mama Zhayog. Dissolving into pristine awareness expanse. Wisdom elevating to sky. Coiling in luminous clarity expanse. Awareness holding own place. First: Three wombs gathered as one, five elements liberated below, unobstructed to pure pristine awareness eye. That too, when impure confusion appearance dissolves into pure suchness, flesh-blood body dissolves into luminous illusory body, then that itself dissolves into Dharmakaya jewel secret body. Wisdom eye dissolves into pristine awareness eye, that itself dissolves into suchness eye, object and knower activity completely pure. In jewel secret womb, internally clear pristine awareness intent, without transfer or change.
From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Impure confusion appearance obscures pristine awareness appearance. Confusion appearance ceases, pure appearance dawns. Latency womb obscures pristine awareness illusory body. Abandoning this body, light appearance dawns. Then reaches jewel womb's end. Three wombs gathered as one, emanation in ten directions accomplished." Thus.
Present body's five elements' dregs purified. If calculated as separately abiding in primordially pure internal expanse luminous clarity five great elements' expanse, impure elements actually become pure elements or abiding as Mama Zhayog, not so.
This is the completion of the path! The body dissolves, not into nothing, but into light. The elements transform into wisdom. Don't fear this dissolution—it's the natural completion, like ice becoming water, water becoming vapor, vapor becoming space!
[15774-15775] 
Listen! Impure five elements purified by power, with reference to appearing capable five pristine awarenesses' pure five great elements, pure result aspects are posited.
[15776-15805] 
That too, wind vajra cross arrangement well-made, samaya goddess coiling in sky, unmoving wind dissolving into expanse. Earth five jewels' stupa well-arranged and well-fashioned, dissolving into solid-free earth expanse. Water crystal wheel well-stacked, liberated from karma and affliction aspect, dissolving into moisture-free water expanse. Fire lotus net blazing, ripening unripened, dissolving into heat-free fire expanse. Space completely pure suchness, vast expanse, primordially pure, impure confusion opening, dissolving into space expanse. External objects, internal body, aggregates, elements, ayatanas, etc., all dharmas completely pure. Pristine awareness jewel essence, empty all-arising mandala vast expanse.
From Self-Arising: "Five jewels' plain is all even. Jewel secret sun, no rising-setting. Jewel water lotus, no stain. Jewel fire mandala, well-constructed. Jewel wind wisdom, no conception. Jewel earth mandala, great vehicle. Jewel space, without limit or center. Jewel empty mandala, well-drawn. Jewel body relic blazing stupa, well-stacked."
From Direct Introduction: "Eye and eye consciousness, ear and ear consciousness, nose and appearance consciousness, tongue and tongue consciousness, body and body consciousness knowing suchness, body completely passed beyond sorrow, form aggregate completely pure. Space completely passed beyond sorrow, conception aggregate completely pure."
Emaho! This is the completion of purification! The elements, the senses, the aggregates—all recognized as the display of wisdom. The stupa is not a building—it's your body recognized as the mandala. The jewels are not ornaments—they're the wisdom qualities naturally present!
[15806-15811] 
Listen! Earth completely passed beyond sorrow, feeling aggregate completely pure. Fire completely passed beyond sorrow, consciousness aggregate completely pure. Wind completely passed beyond sorrow, formation aggregate completely pure. Thus.
[15812-15828] 
Second, dissolving into pristine awareness expanse: Five afflictions purified as five pristine awarenesses' five self-radiances dissolving into internal expanse luminous clarity, abiding as ground-appearance of five clear depth colors. From Six Expanses: "Self-radiance moved, white aspect, abiding as great clear depth itself. Appearance self-dissolved, yellow aspect, unmanifest from depth, own face clear. Attachment-aversion self-dissolved, red aspect, clear depth unmixed, abiding greatly. Effort accomplishment movement self-freed, inexhaustible green, also first rays, unmanifest from depth, clear aspect. Unchanging perfection dark blue, primordially perfect, without making, abides." Thus.
Emaho! This is the completion of the alchemical process! The five afflictions—ignorance, attachment, aversion, pride, jealousy—transform into the five wisdoms. Not destroyed, not rejected—transformed through recognition! Like base metal becoming gold through alchemical process. Your confusion becomes wisdom when you recognize its true nature!
[15829-15841] 
Third, wisdom elevating to sky: Internal expanse five pristine awareness winds abiding unmoving, without transfer or change in own place. These too: Powerful Lady, Holding Dynamic Lady, Elevating Lady, Stable Lady, Appearing Making Lady. From these five: Water-pure nature, downward-clearing Powerful Lady, joins main-circle non-dual with pristine awareness wind, actually without division. Wind-pure nature, upward-moving Holding Dynamic, moves five main-circles in Dharmakaya state in an instant. Earth-pure nature, pervading ground-appearance aspect abiding Elevating Lady, without support-supported, abides as form body in Dharmakaya state. Appearing Making Lady, space-pure nature, non-existent equal four appearances' Dharmakaya and pristine awareness actually non-existent, abiding as internally clear in clear depth ground-appearance aspect. Stable Lady, earth-pure nature, life wind ground-appearance aspect, makes awareness pristine awareness non-conceiving intent unmoving from...
This is subtle body completion! The five winds, the five elements—all purified into the five wisdoms. The body becomes the mandala, the channels become wisdom's path. Don't make it complicated—it's the recognition that your physical body is the display of wisdom!
[15842-15849] 
Listen! From that itself: "Primordially self-pure great perfection, abiding at peak of perfections. Possessing marks self-pure, abiding as ground of great clear depth." Thus. From Self-Arising: "Jewel variously arranged net is even." Thus.
[15850-15869] 
Fourth, coiling in luminous clarity expanse has four: Dissolving without obscuration. Clear without conception. Existing without self. Non-mixed individually, not divided. First, dissolving without obscuration: Elements Mama Zhayog, dissolving into pristine awareness expanse, yet three kayas without gathering-separation, abiding as internally clear subtle pristine awareness. Second: Dharmakaya stainless, without front-back, without above-below, without directions-intermediate points, luminous, abiding as body and pristine awareness ground-appearance, without mind and breath, unsullied by all samsara dharmas.
Third: Existing, view's self-arisen king, free from latency-self. Fourth: In Dharmakaya expanse, five blazing jewel light bodies abiding as clear depth, first ground abiding in own place, yet without conception of that ground, now not divided as samsara confusion. That too, from wisdom ripening as body, moving five bodies in expanse.
[15870-15882] 
Fifth, awareness holding own place has four: Dharmakaya unchanging, vajra-like body. Pristine awareness unchanging, swastika-like life. Intent without gathering-separation, river-like continuity. Awareness without clear-obscure, sun-like rays. First: Awareness form body dissolving into Dharmakaya, becoming one essence, without transfer-change. Second: Essence-holding pristine awareness, nature characteristic-holding pristine awareness, compassion world-taming pristine awarenesses, as mere ground-appearance aspect, abiding without division from own face, so called "all-time pristine awareness." Third...
Don't be intimidated by the technical terms! This is describing the stability of recognition. Once you recognize, you don't "lose" it—it's not something that comes and goes. Like knowing your own name—you don't forget it and remember it. The "coiling" is complete integration!
[16025-16026] The karmic winds become pure and stainless, released into the wisdom-wind domain.
Like a snare catching something far away, then liberated at a distance. But what distance? The distance between you and yourself. That distance has no measure—it never existed!
This is the fireside teaching, friend. Sit close and listen. Liberation is not somewhere else—it's right here, closer than your own breath.
Emaho! Liberated where you stand!
[15883-15892] 
Listen! Without gathering or separation in continuous samadhi, without transfer or change from suchness beyond thought samadhi. Fourth: Self-arising awareness abiding as great internally clear spontaneous accomplishment, abiding without transfer or change in jewel womb. These too, from Self-Arising: "Jewel vajra seat, no change. Jewel empty path, no end. Intent self-abiding, shown as pith instruction." Thus.
[15893-15926] 
Third: How suchness intent expanse coils in expanse, in three parts: Briefly shown essence. Extensively explained aspects. Summarized meaning. First: In primordially pure expanse, spontaneously accomplished clear depth awareness pristine awareness luminous heart essence, being root of all Buddha dharmas, called "great scripture." Immeasurable, so vast. Buddhas, so powerful. View's ultimate deliverance place. Unchanging nail. Beyond this-side seeing intellect's examined object, bow. All-knowing mirror. All paths' traversed peak. Liberation object. Secret king's all dharmas' great treasury house.
From No Letter: "Awareness pristine awareness unmistakenly shown. Unchanging root great scripture. Vast dharma great appearance. Intent suchness great power. View self-arisen great deliverance place. Unchanging great nail letter. Always difficult great bow. Difficult to see great mirror. Difficult to traverse great path. Difficult to abide great object. Difficult to reach great ground. Appearance without existing, great appearance. Bottomless, difficult to measure great. Non-pervading self-radiance great. Great knowing without analyzer. Object-knowing non-dual great intent. Mindless great appearance."
Emaho! These "greats" are not exaggerations—they're pointing to the utter transcendence of your nature. Beyond all measure, beyond all limits, yet right here! Don't make it distant—it's the immediacy of your own awareness!
[15927-15942] 
Listen to these "great perfections"! Unchanging completely expansive great perfection. Subtle, difficult to grasp, great perfection. Vast, without seeing, great perfection. Round, without shape, great perfection. Shaking, without breath, great perfection. Clear, black color, great perfection. Non-existent, soft, great perfection. Appearing, difficult to examine, great perfection. Empty, appearing, great perfection. One, without break, great perfection. Appearing like two, completely perfect great perfection. Beautiful, without ornament, great perfection. Full, empty, great perfection. Ripened, not completed, great perfection. Body-like appearance, without coming-going, great perfection.
Emaho! What is Longchenpa doing? He's exploding all your concepts! Each pair of opposites—both are "great perfection." Not one or the other—both, neither, beyond! This is not philosophy—this is a direct pointing to the nature that can't be pinned down by any concept!
[15943-15961] 
That too, expanse and pristine awareness appearing as two, in Dharmakaya's state, appearing as ground-appearance to clear depth body. Second, extensive explanation of aspects has two: Essence, measured as empty—primordially pure, sky-like, nowhere established, free from extremes, great perfection, Dharmakaya's vast expanse. Aspects, measured as clear—in Dharmakaya expanse' depths, internally clear spontaneously accomplished pristine awareness, inexhaustible body-speech-mind ornament wheel's source, abiding as clear depth in subtle aspect.
From that side, divided: Pristine awareness mandala of five pristine awarenesses, primordially clear. Nothing above that pristine awareness, so high depth. Pristine awareness palace spontaneously accomplished, so vast, etc. From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Jewel-arranged mandala, unwritten, clear. Pristine awareness stable mountain king, unconstructed, high depth. Pristine awareness expansive palace, unmade, vast. Pristine awareness vast expanse ocean, unmuddied, self-radiance. Pristine awareness clear sun, unmade, without rising-setting. Emptiness expansive plain, unarranged, even. Pristine awareness unchanging path, untrained, without near-far. Awareness unchanging horse, running, without cessation. Awareness objectless river, without interruption."
Don't take these literally! The "palace," "mountain," "ocean" are metaphors for aspects of awareness. Unmade, untrained, unwritten—your nature is not a construction. It's naturally perfect, naturally clear, naturally expansive!
[15962-15968] 
Listen to these seven aspects of awareness-pristine awareness! Awareness pristine awareness seed—no increase or decrease. Awareness empty-clear pristine awareness—not divisible. Awareness non-grasping pristine awareness—free from identification extremes. Awareness conception-free pristine awareness—completely clear in non-cessation. Awareness all-clear pristine awareness—unmixed, completely perfect. Awareness all-appearing pristine wisdom—clear without grasping. Awareness all-clear pristine awareness—clear and spontaneously dense. Thus.
From Self-Arising: "Jewel measureless palace well-arranged. Jewel variously spread queen, good ornaments. Jewel beautiful horse, swift as wind. Jewel various plains inexhaustible." Thus.
Emaho! These aren't descriptions of some celestial realm—they're describing your own awareness! The "palace" is the expanse of rigpa. The "jewels" are its qualities. Everything is complete, nothing needs to be added. Like a king in his palace—you're already enthroned in the kingdom of awareness!
[15968-15988] 
Third, summarizing meaning-result: To Buddha of non-dual expanse and pristine awareness, virtue accumulations are immeasurable. From Jewel Array: "Perfectly completed Buddha's miracles immeasurable, uncalculable, ungraspable, immeasurable. Buddha's appearance transcends big-small extremes, like space. Buddha's power transcends is-isn't extremes, like great elephant. Buddha's capacity transcends abandonment-obtainment extremes, like lion. Buddha's virtue transcends empty-full extremes, like wish-fulfilling jewel. Buddha's nature transcends self-conception extremes, all-pervading pristine awareness itself. Buddha's abiding mode transcends faculties and objects, self-appearance itself. These are self-arisen intent's own words."
From Self-Arising: "Perfectly completed Buddha's intent has no limit. Buddha's realization immeasurable. Wisdom without calculation. No good-bad in abodes. No is-isn't in view. No edge-limit in ground. No transfer-change in path. No cause-return in result. Pristine awareness without clear-obscure. Wisdom without mind."
[15988-16000] 
Thus, Buddha actual ground, result perfected, no path for self to traverse. Buddhas Bhagavans are explained from the object as "path-cutter, entry-cutter, elaboration and existence guide cutter."
Emaho! What completion! Buddha has nowhere to go, nothing to become, nothing to do—yet benefits flow like a river. This is the perfection that's not achieved but recognized. Don't look for it elsewhere—it's the very awareness reading these words!
[16001-16004] 
Listen! With reference to compassion's path body guiding trainees, pristine awareness and activity appearing externally, accomplishing benefit, this is explained as "path of no-more-learning." Third: Ascertaining body and pristine awareness ground-appearance in two parts: Identifying ground-appearance. Extensive explanation of nature.
[16004-16023] 
First has ground-appearance itself and refuting wrong understandings. First: Dharmakaya of abandonment-realization ultimate, primordially pure spontaneously accomplished jewel womb—that is body and pristine awareness ground-appearance. That too, essence empty-clear self-arising pristine awareness, nowhere established as anything, nowhere divided, without making, without division, transcending speech, thought, expression, liberated from samsara-nirvana extremes, like sky nowhere established, yet becoming ground-appearance of all immeasurable virtues arising like sun, moon, planets, stars—therefore called pristine awareness perfection body.
From Thal 'gyur: "Buddhas' suchness—undivided, non-dividing, equal—how can sound, words, names exist? Reference-basis self-pure confusion pure, samsara-nirvana not famous as names. Unarisen, unborn, without cessation, all-arising pristine awareness, what is not?" Thus.
Emaho! This is your nature! Not established anywhere, yet the source of all virtues. Like space containing all worlds, yet not confined by them. Don't make it a thing, don't deny its function—let it be naturally perfect!
[16023-16044] 
"Suchness self-dissolved: Elements dissolved, dust and atoms finally ceased, even particles don't abide. Afflictions dissolved, confusion and conception-free attachment not abiding, latencies and all-arising, even dust-particles don't abide. Thus by dissolving coarse and subtle, five aggregates too gradually subtle. Four elements' body exhausted, all pristine awareness perfection body. Concept-free samadhi self-abiding, transcending artificial dharmas, therefore 'dharma' doesn't abide as word." Thus.
Second has three: Positing the position. Refuting it. Establishing correct system. First: Some early masters say...
Don't be shocked by "dissolved" and "ceased"—this isn't destruction! It's the recognition that all these "things" were never solid to begin with. Like waking from a dream—the dream didn't go anywhere, you just recognized it was a dream. The aggregates don't need to be destroyed—they need to be recognized as the display of awareness!
[16045-16048] 
Listen carefully! Some say at the time of perfectly manifest Buddhahood, that primordial purity is nowhere established as anything, so there's no body and pristine awareness dharma either, and no ground-appearance. Some others say: Body and pristine awareness actually abide, and without that, it would follow that result Dharmakaya and pristine awareness were not obtained, or obtained then lost.
[16048-16056] 
Refuting these has two parts: Reasoning: According to the first position, it would follow that Buddha lacks pristine awareness, so own-benefit and other-benefit don't arise—because no difference from empty space without anything. According to the second position, it would follow that Dharmakaya exists like substantial entities with marks, coarse material, like some substantialist proponents—because form self-characteristics are established, and aspect pristine awareness actually established, so no difference from conceptions.
Emaho! Longchenpa is destroying two extremes! Some say Buddha is just emptiness—nothing at all. Others say Buddha is a solid, permanent thing. Both are wrong! Buddha is beyond existence and non-existence, beyond permanence and annihilation. Like trying to describe space—can't say it's a thing, can't say it's nothing!
[16056-16073] 
Scriptural refutation: From Six Expanses: "Without two knowable pristine awareness, what difference from material things? Or else, completely empty, this itself only changes." Thus. From Illuminating Lamp: "Thus without pristine awareness aspect, difference from external empty space exists. Therefore from ground pristine awareness pervades. Without pristine awareness, empty and different, nothing becomes. If coarse pristine awareness exists, equal to conceptions." Thus.
These scriptures show: without the clear aspect of awareness, Buddhahood is just nihilism. But if you make it a coarse, graspable thing, it's no different from ordinary thoughts. The middle way is recognition—luminous, clear, yet ungraspable!
[16073-16079] 
Third, correct system: In primordially pure own-face, nowhere established as anything, transcending existence-nonexistence extremes, body and pristine awareness established like crystal. In that state or expanse or aspect, extremely subtle pristine awareness ground-appearance aspect abides triply stacked, like light inside crystal—though not directly visible object, abides as ground-appearance. Those three pristine awarenesses exist, becoming source of all body and pristine awareness. Dharmakaya unmoving, yet form body and activity appearing to trainees capable of appearing—this capability arises from that crucial point. If not thus, Buddha would be one taste with...
This is the key! Your nature is like a crystal—clear, empty, yet containing the potential for all light. The three wisdoms are always present, just not always manifest. Recognition doesn't create them—it reveals what's always been there!
[16080-16088] 
Listen! Without that pristine awareness, there would be no benefit for sentient beings and no immeasurable Buddha dharmas at all. From Samcaya: "Without pristine awareness, virtues don't increase, enlightenment and ocean-like Buddha dharmas also become non-existent." Thus.
That too, "without pristine awareness" statements are the perspective that essence is nowhere established. "Pristine awareness exists" statements speak of spontaneously accomplished nature aspect—no contradiction, primordially pure and spontaneously accomplished non-dual.
Emaho! This is the Great Perfection view! Not existence, not non-existence—beyond both! Like space: you can't say it exists (where is it?), you can't say it doesn't exist (it's undeniable). Pristine awareness is the same—don't make it a thing, don't deny its vivid clarity!
[16088-16100] 
Second, extensive explanation of nature: In primordially pure expanse's Dharmakaya state, pristine awareness spontaneously accomplished abides as subtle nature. Ground-abiding pristine awareness actually abides subtly. From its aspect, five characteristics-holding pristine awarenesses and knowable-knowing pristine awareness actually exist as ground-appearance aspect, not yet manifest.
From Thal 'gyur: "That too when mind ripens, abides as Dharmakaya's ground. Primordially pure, stains exhausted. Essence primordially without confusion. Appearance-maker unceased spontaneously accomplished." Thus.
Don't think ripening is becoming something new! It's like ice melting into water—it was always water, just temporarily solid. Your mind is always pristine awareness, just temporarily obscured. Ripening is recognition, not manufacture!
[16100-16114] 
That too, in primordially pure expanse, spontaneously accomplished abiding causes essence-nature-compassion aspects to actually appear subtly. Those three ground-abiding pristine awarenesses serving as ground-appearance for other two pristine awarenesses—from that itself: "Thus in liberated mind itself, not without compassion. By ground-abiding pristine awareness, natural dynamic ground-appearance made. By characteristic-holding pristine awareness, purified by conditions, ripening made. By knowing and knowable pristine awareness, to faithful ones, siddhi given." Thus.
The manner of those three ground-abiding ones making ground-appearance: Essence making three kayas' ground-appearance, yet three kayas different-appearance aspect not established. Nature making five lights' ground-appearance, yet colors self-characteristics not established.
This is subtle! The three kayas appear different, yet their ground is the same. The five lights appear different colors, yet they're not truly separate. Like different notes from one flute—distinct, yet from one source!
Listen! Compassion serves as the ground-appearance for two pristine awarenesses, yet there's no direct measurement of objects and aspects. From Thal 'gyur: "That too abiding as essence-body, dharmas and Dharma enjoyment emanation aspect, without dividing, without division mode, established from manner, from that—body colors, etc., not mind's object. Nature appearing-maker light mode. White, red, yellow, green, blue—not mark possessing entities, established from class-free knowables' manner. From compassion's various appearances, not one certain like this, therefore called 'ground' for various appearances."
Emaho! Do you see? The colors and forms aren't solid things—they're the play of light, the natural radiance of awareness. Like a rainbow has no substantial existence yet appears vividly, the kayas appear without being "things." Don't grasp at forms, don't reject them—let them be the spontaneous display!
From Six Expanses too: "Possessing marks self-pure, abiding as ground of great clear depth. Empty of pervader and pervaded, not cut from edge, appearing clear. Appearing-maker appearance aspect not ceased. All essences gathered, stainless, self-pure. Buddhas' great secret, abiding in nature's aspect. From compassion's various appearance aspects, emptiness aspect without cessation. Two knowable pristine awarenesses appear from appearance aspect. From non-existence's self-pure appearance, natural dynamic compassion, without effort of activity, without division in unmade appearance mode, primordially without division appears. Like sun's light, not self-made, nature itself thus appears."
This is describing how the display works! Compassion isn't something Buddha "does"—it's what awareness naturally does, like light naturally illuminates. The five colors aren't "out there"—they're the way awareness displays itself. Don't solidify, don't reject—recognize the play!
"Knowing knowables as they are, compassion aspect's pristine awareness, knowing own thing's mode. Without that pristine awareness' aspect, what's the difference from four elements' forms? Knowing all knowables, compassion's pristine awareness, knowing trainees' thoughts. Without this, equal to mere space. Therefore all-knowing pristine awareness appears in compassion's aspect. Not held by memory, abiding as nature itself. Grasping-grasped coarsely not abiding. Clear depth subtle aspect appearing, this is sentient beings' path. Increasing like seed above. This appearance not ceased, like suitable medicine's power, appearing suitably to six families. Therefore compassion."
Don't you see? This "compassion" isn't sentiment—it's the knowing-quality of awareness itself. Without it, Buddha would be no different from a rock. With it, Buddha knows all beings' needs without effort, like a mirror reflecting without deciding what to reflect!
That too from ground-appearance aspect, when appearing as Nirmanakaya, the two pristine awarenesses also actually benefit the six families of trainees...
This is the completion of the explanation—showing how the three kayas and five wisdoms actually function to benefit beings. Not theoretical, not abstract—this is the living reality of awakening!
