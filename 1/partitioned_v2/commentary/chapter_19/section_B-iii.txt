[16115-16129] 
Listen! Compassion serves as the ground-appearance for two pristine awarenesses, yet there's no direct measurement of objects and aspects. From Thal 'gyur: "That too abiding as essence-body, dharmas and Dharma enjoyment emanation aspect, without dividing, without division mode, established from manner, from that—body colors, etc., not mind's object. Nature appearing-maker light mode. White, red, yellow, green, blue—not mark possessing entities, established from class-free knowables' manner. From compassion's various appearances, not one certain like this, therefore called 'ground' for various appearances."
Emaho! Do you see? The colors and forms aren't solid things—they're the play of light, the natural radiance of awareness. Like a rainbow has no substantial existence yet appears vividly, the kayas appear without being "things." Don't grasp at forms, don't reject them—let them be the spontaneous display!
[16130-16152] 
From Six Expanses too: "Possessing marks self-pure, abiding as ground of great clear depth. Empty of pervader and pervaded, not cut from edge, appearing clear. Appearing-maker appearance aspect not ceased. All essences gathered, stainless, self-pure. Buddhas' great secret, abiding in nature's aspect. From compassion's various appearance aspects, emptiness aspect without cessation. Two knowable pristine awarenesses appear from appearance aspect. From non-existence's self-pure appearance, natural dynamic compassion, without effort of activity, without division in unmade appearance mode, primordially without division appears. Like sun's light, not self-made, nature itself thus appears."
This is describing how the display works! Compassion isn't something Buddha "does"—it's what awareness naturally does, like light naturally illuminates. The five colors aren't "out there"—they're the way awareness displays itself. Don't solidify, don't reject—recognize the play!
[16153-16175] 
"Knowing knowables as they are, compassion aspect's pristine awareness, knowing own thing's mode. Without that pristine awareness' aspect, what's the difference from four elements' forms? Knowing all knowables, compassion's pristine awareness, knowing trainees' thoughts. Without this, equal to mere space. Therefore all-knowing pristine awareness appears in compassion's aspect. Not held by memory, abiding as nature itself. Grasping-grasped coarsely not abiding. Clear depth subtle aspect appearing, this is sentient beings' path. Increasing like seed above. This appearance not ceased, like suitable medicine's power, appearing suitably to six families. Therefore compassion."
Don't you see? This "compassion" isn't sentiment—it's the knowing-quality of awareness itself. Without it, Buddha would be no different from a rock. With it, Buddha knows all beings' needs without effort, like a mirror reflecting without deciding what to reflect!
[16175-16176] 
That too from ground-appearance aspect, when appearing as Nirmanakaya, the two pristine awarenesses also actually benefit the six families of trainees...
This is the completion of the explanation—showing how the three kayas and five wisdoms actually function to benefit beings. Not theoretical, not abstract—this is the living reality of awakening!
[16176-16191] 
Listen! In primordially pure time, here, truly, non-existent, existing as seed-element mode. From Six Expanses too: "Essence, nature, and compassion's appearances appear to intelligent ones. Essence nowhere established, nature appears as clear appearance aspect. From compassion aspect, two pristine awarenesses arise without actor and action. Arising-appearance for two intellect levels, thus such pristine awareness activity appears free from effort and accomplishment. Buddhas' pristine awareness appears thus from the ground." Thus it is said.
Emaho! This is the key to understanding how enlightenment appears! Essence—empty, unestablished. Nature—clear, luminous. Compassion—unobstructed, appearing. These three aren't separate things—they're inseparable aspects of your own rigpa. The "two pristine awarenesses" appear according to the capacity of the perceiver. To deluded mind, they appear as samsara. To pure mind, as nirvana. Same display, different recognition!
[16191-16218] 
Thus, expanse and pristine awareness non-dual Dharmakaya ultimate is called "great primordially pure liberation place of non-dual primordially pure spontaneously accomplished." Though abiding as nature's ground-appearance, essence nowhere established, ultimate truth sole completely perfect, great perfection, transcending body and pristine awareness, sky-like suchness is ultimate result, great internal expanse, unsurpassed liberation place, body-speech-mind non-dual vajra secret spontaneously accomplished jewel womb. From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Tathagatas don't have arising and abiding in body. Why? Tathagatas lack body as substantial thing. Tathagatas' speech doesn't have transformable and untransformable. Why? Tathagatas' speech is empty. Tathagatas' mind doesn't have thinking and not-thinking. Why? Tathagatas' mind is free from conceptions." Thus. And from Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra Diamond Cutter too: "Those who see me in form, who know me in sound, entered into wrong rejection—those people don't see me. Guides are Dharmakaya. Suchness is not knowable. That cannot be known." Thus spoken.
This is radical! The Buddha has no body, no speech, no mind in the conventional sense. Don't misunderstand—this doesn't mean nothing exists. It means nothing exists as a solid, graspable, permanent "thing." The Dharmakaya is not an object of knowledge—it's the knowing itself!
[16218-16243] 
Prasangika-Madhyamikas hold actual Buddha as that pure empty Dharmakaya...
Longchenpa is engaging with philosophical positions here. He's showing that even the highest common vehicle view—Dharmakaya as emptiness—is a stepping stone to the Dzogchen view. Don't cling even to emptiness! The empty nature is not a void—it's the luminous clarity that knows itself. This is the view that cuts through all extremes while naturally expressing great compassion!
[16219-16228] 
Listen carefully! In one's own face, existence-nonexistence elaboration pacified, not even established as mere body and pristine awareness. Other-appearance as Buddha's compassion and trainees' aspiration prayers, form body and activity appearing together, this is like garuda's offering-pillar, wish-fulfilling jewel, and wish-fulfilling tree. From Avatamsaka: "Peaceful body clear like wish-fulfilling tree, like wish-fulfilling jewel, without conceptions, benefiting sentient beings' world until liberation, always. This appears while free from elaboration." Thus.
Emaho! What a metaphor! The Buddha's appearance isn't like a person deciding to help—it's as natural as a wish-fulfilling jewel granting wishes without intention. The garuda's offering-pillar appears spontaneously without being constructed. Your own nature, when recognized, benefits beings without you "trying to be compassionate." This is effortless compassion—much more profound than manufactured kindness!
[16228-16233] 
Here too, though similar to primordially pure's own face, from subtle pristine awareness existing in expanse, body and pristine awareness appear. Doing benefit for those who made aspiration prayers to be actually benefited by Buddha through it. Distinguished by the special feature of being spontaneously accomplished from essence aspect, not wishing to be produced by cause-aspiration prayers.
These are crucial points of primordially pure result—wise ones should know with very refined intelligence!
Don't miss this! The benefit to beings doesn't happen because Buddha "decides" to help. It happens spontaneously because that's the nature of awareness. Like the sun shining—it's not deciding to warm each person, it just shines. The aspiration prayers of beings align with this natural compassion, but they don't create it!
[16233-16242] 
Second general meaning: Specifically explaining appearance-modes of body and pristine awareness from spontaneously accomplished luminous clarity ground-appearance in two parts: General presentation of body divisions. Specifically explaining nature of three kayas. First has five: Explained as one body: Ground awareness one. Path awareness place one. Result awareness stainless primordially pure one—from this perspective, the unchanging vajra body, empty, heart of pristine awareness, spontaneously accomplished jewel womb, first Buddha, sky-like free from extremes.
From Self-Arising: Emaho! Great appearance, great clarity. Pure sky, free from limits. Elaboration-free suchness, unchanging. Free from extremes, center, directions, parts. Self-appearance dharmadhatu pure field. First Buddha, without cause. Last, not produced by conditions. Empty pristine awareness heart-endowed. Not abiding extremes, vajra body. Elaboration-free suchness...
This verse is magnificent! Don't read it as poetry—read it as your own nature described! "First Buddha without cause"—your nature was never created. "Not produced by conditions"—no circumstances can make or unmake it. "Empty pristine awareness"—the heart of wisdom that's always been yours!
[16255-16261] 
Listen to this verse! "Lord of essence-nature-compassion, three kayas of pristine awareness luminous clarity. In sky, sun rising, dispelling darkness. Five pristine awarenesses' characteristics clear. Buddha emanations manifoldly arising." Thus it is said.
Emaho! What a description! Your own nature—essence, nature, and compassion—is the three kayas. Not somewhere else, not later, not after practice! Right now, as the clarity of awareness, dispelling the darkness of confusion like the sun in the sky. The five wisdoms aren't accomplishments—they're the natural radiance of rigpa!
[16261-16277] 
Divided into two bodies: Ground primordially pure and spontaneously accomplished non-dual awareness. Path expanse and pristine awareness taken into experience. Result Dharmakaya appearing as two types, dual purpose perfected. From Thal 'gyur: "From Dharmakaya, form bodies appear clear." Thus.
Divided into three kayas: From essence aspect, empty-aware-knowing pristine awareness Dharmakaya. Self-appearance luminous clarity Sambhogakaya. Various Nirmanakaya. From Mu Tig Phreng Ba: "Three kayas, sole Buddha, five pristine awareness characteristics endowed. Abiding mode established by knowables' manner." Thus.
Don't think these divisions are real separations! They're pedagogical tools. Like describing water as H2O, as wet, as clear, as thirst-quenching—different descriptions, same water!
[16277-16298] 
Divided into four bodies: Three kayas' suchness, free from one-and-many extremes, Svabhavikakaya. Powers, fearlessnesses, eighteen unmixed dharmas, etc., awareness qualities realized, samadhi, superknowledges, great compassion—these are Dharmakaya. Perfected marks and signs, abiding in Akanistha Ghanavyuha realm, Sambhogakaya. Appearing as whatever tames trainees' essence, Nirmanakaya. From Thal 'gyur: "Nirmanakaya and Sambhogakaya and Dharmakaya Svabhavikakaya." Thus.
These also appear in common treatises, matching completely. From Abhisamayalankara: "Svabhavika with Sambhogakaya, likewise others Nirmanakaya, Dharmakaya with activities." Their extensive explanation: "The Sage's Svabhavikakaya, whatever unstained dharmas obtained, completely pure in all ways, those possessing characteristic nature." Thus.
Longchenpa is showing how Dzogchen integrates with common Mahayana. The four kayas of common vehicles are not rejected—they're included as aspects of the Dzogchen view. This is the "higher" vehicle not because it contradicts lower ones, but because it encompasses them while going beyond!
[16299-16314] 
Look at these verses from the Sutras! "The Sage's unique qualities, the eighteen explained, and the knowledge of all aspects—this is called Dharmakaya." The thirty-two marks and eighty excellent signs—this body, for the Great Vehicle's enjoyment, the Sage's Sambhogakaya is asserted. "Whatever benefit for beings in samsara equally performed—that body is the Sage's continuous Nirmanakaya." Thus it is said!
Emaho! The Buddha's qualities are not decorations—they're the natural expression of recognition! Like the sun's rays aren't separate from the sun, the kayas aren't separate from awareness. Longchenpa is quoting the Sutras to show the common vehicle's understanding before revealing the uncommon Dzogchen view.
[16314-16327] 
Divided into five bodies: Body of Manifest Perfect Enlightenment, abandonment-realization liberation-perfected peaceful attainment. Body of Unchanging Vajra, unchanging without transformation from primordially pure expanse. Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya—five. From Self-Perfected: "Five bodies, five pristine awarenesses." Thus it is said. From Self-Arising: "Five bodies of unchanging meaning abide." Thus. These divisions and others are immeasurable—enough elaboration!
Don't get lost counting bodies! Whether two, three, four, or five—it's all describing aspects of your own nature. Like describing a jewel by its color, clarity, cut, and carat—different aspects, one jewel!
[16327-16344] 
Second, specific explanation of the nature of three kayas: establishing meaningful connection and explaining contextual meaning in two parts. First has three: General presentation of attainment mode. Specifically explained as being result. Removing contradiction with explaining as path-appearance. First: From essence's ground-appearance appearing as three kayas, shown as attained through power of purifying three gates' stains to be purified. From Thal 'gyur: "Furthermore, the result stages: Dharmakaya by mind's activity, Sambhogakaya obtained through speech's form, Nirmanakaya by body." Thus.
These are cause-result of what is to be purified. As spontaneously accomplished by nature, knowing that attainment through causes and conditions is impossible—know this!
See? The purification isn't a manufacturing process—you're not building a Buddha from parts. It's removing obscurations from what's already perfect. Like cleaning a mirror: the reflection is already there, you just remove the dust!
[16344-16351] 
Second: From Mu Tig Phreng Ba (Pearl Garland): "Result three kayas, five pristine awarenesses." Thus. From Vajrasattva Heart Mirror: "Know that all result dharmas are three kayas, irreversible." Thus. Third: If someone says explaining three kayas as path-appearance contradicts...
Longchenpa is about to resolve an apparent contradiction. Some might think: "If the kayas are already perfect as the ground, how can they be a path we traverse?" Watch how he elegantly shows that these aren't contradictory but complementary perspectives!
[16352-16358] 
Listen! The early masters said: "Not the result"—but what did they mean? They were freeing us from extreme attachment to the three kayas as truly existent results. Or they were refuting those who hold the three cycles as ultimate. Having removed these contradictions, they also established it as result in reality. But those who don't understand the essence of primordially pure internal expanse as the nature—this is a great error, not good!
Emaho! See the skill of Longchenpa! He's showing how earlier masters used skillful means. When they said "not result," they weren't denying Buddhahood—they were protecting us from grasping. Like telling a child "don't touch the stove"—the stove exists, but the warning prevents harm. The three kayas are both path-appearance AND result—there's no contradiction!
[16358-16367] 
Here, as previously accepted, path-appearance exists, and it doesn't contradict being result. First, it is path-appearance—from the spontaneously accomplished womb of great primordial purity, like entering a house of ultimate result, then emerging from there, needing to appear externally from the primordially pure ground. The mode of appearance appears as abiding-essence-body.
There are two path-appearances: those making oneself Buddha before the result, and having made oneself Buddha, the path of guiding trainees through manifest body accomplishing benefit. From this, here we hold the no-more-learning path-appearance as the three kayas being path-appearance AND being result—non-contradictory, connected meaning.
Don't you see? The path and result aren't separate events in time—they're different aspects of the same recognition. Like a mirror reflecting: the reflection is both the appearing (path) and the complete image (result) simultaneously!
[16367-16378] 
The liberated Dharmakaya internal expanse, the three kayas appearing externally as path-appearance—body and pristine awareness display appearing, Dharmakaya as mind of pristine awareness, Sambhogakaya as its body, Nirmanakaya as appearing activity, producing benefit. This too is internal-clear ground-appearance body and pristine awareness, non-dual, non-separated Vajrasattva suchness, and from that externally clear, the three kayas' path-appearance self-arising—though similar in awareness state, internal-external distinction divided. From self-appearance aspect, in trainees' appearance field, Sambhogakaya-Nirmanakaya appearing, accomplishing benefit, though one as awareness-play, self-appearance not seen by trainees, but that which appears from it is seen—this distinction shows the two similar ones differentiated.
This is subtle! Your own awareness displays everything, but you don't see it as your own display—you see it as "external world." Like watching a movie and forgetting it's just light on a screen. The play of your own rigpa appears as samsara and nirvana, but until you recognize it, it seems like "real world out there." Recognition changes nothing in the display—only in how you understand it!
[16379-16383] 
Listen! Longchenpa quotes from Sengge Tsal Dzog (Lion's Perfected Power): "Vajrasattva's suchness and self-appearance mandala pure of the two—similar ground, one, yet difference of straying is great." This is a crucial warning! The nature of mind (Vajrasattva's suchness) and its self-display (the mandala) have the same ground—they're not two different things. But the difference between recognizing this and not recognizing it? Vast! Like the difference between a rich man and a beggar who both live in the same house but one knows he owns it and the other doesn't!
[16384-16400] 
Pay attention to this philosophical subtlety—it's easy to get confused! If internal expanse and external clear-appearance-path are not divided, and the three bodies are held as the result of self-appearance, then just as Nirmanakaya appears to trainees, the primordially pure Dharmakaya of the place of liberation would also appear to trainees. Since the three bodies are one in essence, Dharmakaya would appear as gathering-dispersing and colors!
Or alternatively, Nirmanakaya would not appear to trainees because Dharmakaya doesn't appear. This is the dilemma! Longchenpa is showing the logical consequences if you hold wrong views about the kayas.
The resolution? The three bodies should not be grasped as one in essence and one in appearance. Nirmanakaya is the compassion aspect. What appears from that compassion is reflected-image emanation, not actual Nirmanakaya, because it's not compassion itself.
[16400-16402] 
This distinction of tenets is extremely subtle—wise ones should examine and understand it in their minds. This is a crucial point!
Emaho! Longchenpa is protecting you from philosophical errors that could derail your practice for lifetimes. Don't just skim over this—ponder it deeply!
[16402-16413] 
Second: Explaining the meaning of the context in three parts: General presentation of the abodes of three bodies. Specific explanation of pristine awareness abodes. Summarizing the meaning of the five abodes of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.
From the first, from the three—Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya—first, extensive explanation of Dharmakaya's abode has four: essence, divisions, enumerations, extensive explanation. The essence of Dharmakaya is self-arising pristine awareness, empty-clear, free from elaboration.
[16413-16424] 
From five aspects—abiding mode, characteristics, nature, compassion, appearance-mode: Essence's abiding mode: Abiding unsullied by any flaw, primordially pure nature. That essence's characteristic: Empty, possessing the heart of awareness. That essence's nature: Not mixed with anything. That essence's compassion: Undivided, non-dividing, without division. That essence's appearance-mode: Without duality.
The definition is...
Don't make this abstract! This is describing your present moment of awareness. Unsullied by any problem—ever! Empty yet aware. Not mixed with thoughts or emotions. Compassion that doesn't need to divide subject from object. And it all appears without the duality of inside and outside, self and other. This isn't philosophy—this is your immediate experience when you stop grasping!
[16425-16428] 
Listen carefully! Longchenpa is explaining how designation works. "From the dharmas of mere designation aspect, ripened as body, without substantial existence." This is subtle—don't miss it! The body appears, yes, but it's ripened from mere designation, not from some solid thing. Characteristics by which nothing is definitively established. Emptiness nowhere established—therefore called Dharmakaya!
This is the crucial point: Dharmakaya is not "something" that exists somewhere. It's the recognition that there's no solid, findable essence. Like trying to grasp a rainbow—you can't, yet it appears. This appearance without graspability is Dharmakaya!
[16428-16432] 
Now the breakdown: Dharma means unstained dharmas of the Buddha ground, connected with awareness. Body means without marks, faces, or hands, merely spoken of as the essence of unchanging awareness. Don't look for a Buddha-form in Dharmakaya! No arms, no legs, no ornaments—just the naked fact of awareness itself, unchanging, ungraspable, yet vividly present.
[16432-16440] 
Divisions: Three Dharmakayas related to essence-characteristics, all-pervading abiding, and appearance-modes of divisions. First: With reference to suchness, nowhere established as any essence, free from elaboration extremes. Beyond holding to entity limits, without birth, death, transference, or change. Ultimate directly manifesting, suchness beyond thought.
This is pointing to the unfindable nature. Look for yourself—can you find the "thing" that's aware? Can you point to awareness? You can't! Yet it's undeniable. This unfindability is not a problem to solve—it's liberation itself!
[16440-16453] 
Second: Dharmakaya pervading all samsara and nirvana, possessing the two purities—pure of adventitious stains. From Hevajra: "Sentient beings are Buddha, only obscured by adventitious stains. Once removed, they are Buddha." And from Uttaratantra: "Perfect Buddha-body because it radiates, because suchness is undifferentiable, because of possessing potential—therefore all beings always possess Buddha-nature."
Emaho! What news! You're not becoming Buddha—you ARE Buddha, just temporarily obscured like the sun behind clouds. The clouds aren't the sun's nature, and your confusion isn't your nature. Remove the obscuration, and what's left? Buddha! Not a new acquisition, but recognition of what's always been!
[16453-16466] 
Third: Shown as aspects of awareness, emptiness, qualities, etc., according to respective vehicles. In this great complete perfection, if divided by display: Dharmakaya's Dharmakaya fields beyond thought. Suchness abiding beyond thought and expression. Great unmoving samadhi. Circle manifold, nature non-dual. Teaching unspeakable suchness. Suchness unchanging at any time.
Dharmakaya's Sambhogakaya fields, free from dust, stainless. Abode memory and mental thought self-dissolved. Samadhi, mind and mental factors' experience ceased, pristine awareness self-abiding.
Do you see? Every possible description still doesn't capture it. Yet these "fields" and "qualities" are not far away—they're the display of your own rigpa, right now, manifesting as the world you perceive!
[16467-16470] 
Continuing with the third body—this is crucial, so listen closely! "Empty circle self-appearance as agent"—this means the mandala-circle is empty yet appears, and this appearance is self-arising, performing its own function without anyone doing it. The teaching is completely pure of observed objects. Not established by time, therefore great equal great expansive!
Do you see? This is not a creation by some deity. The mandala appears spontaneously from the nature of reality itself. Like a rainbow appearing in the sky—no one paints it, yet it's vividly there. This is how Sambhogakaya manifests: self-arising, self-sustaining, without any external cause or creator!
[16470-16477] 
Now the Nirmanakaya of Dharmakaya—the Emanation Body emerging from the Body of Reality! Field and realm, emptiness without break or limit. Abiding as the great self-radiance of the clear depth of the ground-appearance of all abodes. Samadhi without cessation, self-clear. Circle without hierarchy, pure appearance-manifestation. Teaching unaltered nature. Time appearing as the essence itself.
This is describing how the Buddha appears in the world—not by leaving some heaven and traveling here, but as the spontaneous display of the ground itself. Like the sun's rays naturally illuminating everything without the sun deciding to shine. The Nirmanakaya is not a downgrade from Dharmakaya—it's Dharmakaya's own self-expression!
[16477-16487] 
These are all designated from the aspect of Dharmakaya as primordially pure self-abiding. From Ratnakuta (the Heap of Jewels):
"By Dharmakaya self-pure of grasping, in the measureless pure of elaboration, to the appearance-circle not different from itself, by signless speech, words without elaboration, released self-dissolved non-abiding, emerge from mind. Without speaking, without spoken, in the state of great equality demonstrated."
This verse is profound! It describes how teaching occurs without a teacher, how words appear without being spoken, how manifestation happens without leaving the nature. Don't think of three bodies as three different things—it's one awareness showing three faces like a jewel reflecting differently in different lights!
[16488-16510] 
These too are merely designated aspects—in reality, nowhere established, abiding as great completely perfect free from extremes. Again from that same source:
"This abode is called 'this'—the object with characteristics famous as names. Since appearance-form nowhere manifests, from the emptiness of non-existence, dharmodaya, in the great secret self-expanse, primordially abiding, without apprehending, as the mode of abiding, great play primordially emerged. In this, no one abides. By nothing made as abode. In this, no perfections. Free from abiding and coming. Thus the place of great primordial emptiness. From non-existence, the expanse-grove. In this, neither outside nor inside. Looking above and below—nothing. In directions and intermediate points—nothing. In this, not the slightest thing to grasp."
Emaho! What liberation! Longchenpa is demolishing every place you might try to stand. No abode, no inside or outside, no directions, nothing to grasp. This isn't nihilism—it's the freedom of recognizing that the nature transcends all location and limitation. You're not "in" the nature—the nature is what you are!
[16510-16514] 
Fourth: Extensive explanation of enumerations. From the five—body, speech, mind, qualities, activity—Dharmakaya's body: empty, clear, signless. Speech: beyond expression, sound, words. Mind: free from memory, thought, elaboration.
Don't compartmentalize! These are not separate departments in a cosmic bureaucracy. Body is emptiness-clarity, speech is spontaneous expression, mind is unobstructed awareness—all three are your own nature, right now, if you would just stop looking elsewhere!
Listen here! Longchenpa is completing the discussion of Dharmakaya—the Body of Reality. Look at what he's saying: the qualities never reverse, never change, never transform! And the activity? It arises spontaneously, without cessation, abiding as the ground itself. This isn't some philosophical abstraction—this is describing your own nature!
The quote from Thal 'gyur (the consequence tradition) lays it out perfectly: Dharmakaya is body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity—all five! But don't mistake this for some cosmic administrator sitting on a throne. Body is emptiness, clarity, and signless nature. Speech is free from sound, words, and names—beyond all expression. Mind transcends thought and movement, beyond proliferation and analysis. Qualities are without coming or going, pervading expanse and pristine awareness, nature unalterable. Activity is unarisen, unborn, arising through dynamic energy without cessation, beyond created and uncreated.
Emaho! What a wonder! This is not describing something far away—this is pointing directly to what you are, right now, if you would only recognize it!
Now we turn to the second topic: Sambhogakaya, the Enjoyment Body, explained extensively. Longchenpa gives us the structure: essence, definition, divisions, and enumerations—four aspects.
The essence-characteristic is great self-clarity, completely perfect. The way it abides is unmoving in nature—manifesting marks and examples, clear in families, unmoving. This is not some static thing—it's vibrant, luminous, yet utterly stable.
The definition of Sambhogakaya: appearing as Sambhogakaya, engaging in that very appearance, knowledge without obstruction engaging—this is it. The body is great self-clarity, vast display. Don't make it complicated! This is the radiance of your own awareness, wearing the ornaments of luminosity.
Now the four divisions of Sambhogakaya:
1. The Body of Great Element Essence
2. The Body of All-Pervading Abiding
3. The Body of the Path of Appearance
4. The Body of Appearance for Trainees
The first: from the ground-appearance of Dharmakaya, self-arising, perfected as the body endowed with fivefold luminosity—this is the nature of ground-appearance as great elements: clarity-warmth, coolness, expansiveness, pervasiveness. Don't think this is physics! These are wisdom qualities, not material elements. The warmth of compassion, the coolness of clarity, the expansiveness of space-like mind, the pervasiveness of benefitting all.
The second body: for all Buddhas and sentient beings alike, pervaded by light and light-dwellings, the portion manifesting. From Self-Arising: "Abiding as the heart of light for all, thought-free pure dharmadhatu, matchless sole unique one, center and circle and palace, awareness and emptiness and clarity."
This is describing the mandala of your own being! The palace is not somewhere in space—it's the space of your own awareness. The center is rigpa, the circle is its display, the palace is the dimension in which recognition occurs. Don't look for this in a thangka painting—look for it in the immediacy of your own experience!
Emaho! Like light filling a room the moment the lamp is lit, this body pervades all without effort or intention. What a wonder!
