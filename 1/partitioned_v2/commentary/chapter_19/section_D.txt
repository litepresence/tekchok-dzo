[16960-16965] 
From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Gyud, the Tantra of Lion Power Great Perfection:
"The kayas of the Buddhas,
Speech and mind mandala,
Qualities and enlightened activity—
Appear as five."
Thus it is taught.
This is the summary verse. Everything that appears from a Buddha—the forms, the speech, the mind, the qualities, the activities—all five are spontaneously present. Not created, not made, not cultivated. Naturally manifesting.
[16966-16982] 
Second, the detailed divisions of the five—kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity. First, regarding kaya: essence, definitive terminology, division into three.
The essence of kaya: whatever is the Buddha-ground's support, without change or transformation. Definitive terminology: "kaya" because body is complete.
In the Buddha-ground, though there is neither body nor entity, names alone do not contradict. From the Ratnagotravibhaga (Dkon mchog sgron me):
"The dharmakaya is the body of the Victors.
By seeing, purifying views, one will know."
Just as it is said.
Here's the key point: Dharmakaya isn't a physical body, yet it's called "body." Sambhogakaya has no marks, yet it appears with marks. Nirmanakaya has no fixation, yet it appears in various forms. These aren't contradictions—they're the play of emptiness and appearance!
[16983-16995] 
Divided: Dharmakaya free from elaborations; Sambhogakaya free from marks; Nirmanakaya free from fixation. From Tsal Dzog:
"Essence of kaya without change,
Definitive terminology of kaya possessing clear radiance,
Shown as divided into various aspects,
Possessing dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya.
Characteristic of dharmakaya free from thought,
Characteristic of sambhogakaya without clear cognition,
Characteristic of nirmanakaya showing various."
This is profound. Each kaya has its own characteristic: dharmakaya is beyond thought, sambhogakaya is beyond ordinary cognition, nirmanakaya shows variety. Yet they're not separate—they're three aspects of the same enlightened nature.
[16996-17007] 
Regarding speech also: essence empty of sound, definitive terminology various Dharma heaps appearing in the expanse. Divided: the speech of great enlightened activity, appearing whatever tames whomever; Brahma's speech appearing as sixty branches; six realms' self-appearance and harmonious speech appearing according to each sound; beings' believing speech, sound satisfying the faculties; symbolic speech, making meaning understood through symbols shown; word-speech, afflictions purified through sound reaching trainees' ears.
These also are distinguished through the essential identity of nirmanakaya alone. For sambhogakaya, merely symbols. For dharmakaya, from unexpressible meaning-speech, appearance does not exist. The speech appearing as nirmanakaya is like the aspect of an echo.
Listen! Buddha speech isn't "someone talking." It's empty, yet it appears. It's like an echo—sound without a source. It appears in whatever form is needed to benefit beings. Sometimes as formal teaching, sometimes as ordinary conversation, sometimes as symbols, sometimes just as words. All are Buddha speech when recognized!
Emaho! The kayas, speech, and mind are complete!
[17008-17022] 
Listen here! Buddha's speech—it's appearance without inherent existence. Like an echo, like a reflection. It appears to trainees through the gathering of their merit and the Buddha's blessing, but in reality, there are no syllables with self-characteristic.
From the Gyud Lama (Uttaratantra):
"The speech of the Victors
Is like an echo, without letters."
And just as an echo's sound
Arises from others' cognition,
Without conceptual fabrication or contrivance—
Just so is the Tathagata's speech.
Arising from others' cognition,
Without conceptual fabrication,
Just so is the Tathagata's speech.
Not abiding outside or inside.
What does this mean? When the Buddha speaks, he's not really "saying" anything! The words appear to you based on your own mind, your own karma, your own capacity. The Buddha doesn't open his mouth and produce syllables. The syllables appear spontaneously in your mind based on causes and conditions. This is the magical display of enlightened speech!
Don't think the Buddha is somewhere "over there" giving a talk. The teaching appears directly in your own awareness. The sound is empty, yet it appears. It's a reflection, an echo—profoundly clear, yet without inherent existence.
[17023-17033] 
From Tsal Dzog (Complete Potency):
"Empty of the nature of speech appearing,
Various definitive terminology of speech arises,
Shown as divided into six aspects:
The speech of Buddha's enlightened activity,
Brahma's divine offering-speech,
The self-sounds of six realms' confusion,
Beings' believing taming-speech,
The secret mother's symbolic speech,
Various sounds shown as speech."
These are the six types of Buddha speech! The enlightened speech isn't just one thing—it manifests differently depending on the context. Sometimes it's the formal speech of enlightened activity, sometimes it appears as divine speech, sometimes as the confused sounds of beings, sometimes as teaching that tames the mind, sometimes as secret symbolic communication. All of these are manifestations of the same enlightened speech, appearing according to what's needed.
Don't get stuck thinking Buddha speech means "the Buddha talking." It can appear as anything—wind in the trees, the cry of a bird, a stranger's words. When you're ready to hear the Dharma, the Dharma appears. That's Buddha speech!
[17034-17046] 
Third, regarding Mind—its essence is without confusion. Its definitive terminology: awareness clear in its own place. Divided: the mind of wisdom of abandonment perfectly complete, memory awakened; the mind of wisdom of realization perfectly complete, unchanging vajra mind; the mind of wisdom of enlightened activity perfectly complete, various knowing minds—three.
From That Very:
"Essence of mind without confusion,
Definitive terminology of mind appearing to thought,
Shown as divided into three:
Mind itself memory-awakened,
Vajra unchanging mind, and
Shown as various-knowing mind."
The Buddha's mind isn't something distant, something other. It's awareness clear in its own place—your own awareness! The three aspects are: the awakened memory (not forgetting the nature of reality), the unchanging vajra mind (not subject to birth and death), and the omniscient mind knowing all things.
But here's the key: these aren't three separate minds. They're three aspects of the same awareness. Your awareness, right now, has these qualities. You just don't recognize them yet!
[17047-17051] 
Fourth, regarding Qualities—their essence is the perfectly complete Dharma of the Buddha-ground. Definitive terminology: like a jewel, because all perfect excellent qualities arise spontaneously. Divided:
The qualities of the basis—dharmakaya abiding in its own place, self-benefit complete;
The qualities of the path-appearance—sambhogakaya clear in the mandala, other-benefit appearing.
This is the completion of the three kayas and five aspects. The qualities aren't something the Buddha acquires—they're spontaneously present, like a jewel naturally radiating light. Self-benefit is complete through dharmakaya. Other-benefit appears through sambhogakaya. Both are natural expressions of enlightened nature.
Stop looking for qualities somewhere else! They're right here, in your own nature, spontaneously complete. You don't need to build them up—you need to recognize what's already present!
Emaho! What a wonder!
[17052-17060] 
The qualities that carry to the end, the nirmanakaya guiding beings, connecting to the ultimate dharmakaya. From That Very:
"The essence of qualities produces all,
The definitive terminology of qualities accomplishes various,
Divided, shown as three:
Qualities abiding in the basis,
Qualities appearing in the path,
Qualities carrying to the end."
This is the structure of enlightened qualities—they're not just in the result, they're present throughout: in the ground (basis), on the path, and in the fruition. Don't think you have to wait until you're enlightened to experience Buddha-qualities. They're present right now, in your own nature, if you recognize them!
[17061-17069] 
Fifth, regarding enlightened activity also: essence, definitive terminology, division into three. The essence of enlightened activity is benefiting beings, spontaneously accomplishing until samsara is not emptied. From the Abhisamayalankara:
"Likewise, as long as this existence remains,
Activity is asserted to be uninterrupted."
This is crucial! A Buddha's activity doesn't stop. As long as there are beings in samsara, enlightened activity continues spontaneously, effortlessly. It's not that Buddhas "try" to help—helping is their nature, like the sun naturally shines.
[17070-17079] 
Definitive terminology: The enlightened activity of the three kayas, acting for trainees, purifying karma and afflictions, connecting to the level of Buddha. Knowing the realm of trainees and latent tendencies, accomplishing their benefit appropriately, without possessing effort or exertion—like the moon's reflection appearing in water.
From the Gyud Lama (Uttaratantra):
"The realm of trainees, the taming action,
Their abode and suchness—
The Lord always spontaneously engages."
This is the nature of Buddha activity—completely natural, completely responsive. Like the moon reflecting in water, it appears without the moon "trying" to reflect. The reflection appears when conditions are present. So too with enlightened activity.
[17080-17095] 
Divided into four: From the Rigpa Rangshar Chenpo Gyud:
"Peaceful and expansive,
Likewise powerful and wrathful."
Peaceful activity purifies beings' obscurations and serves as the method for pacifying all suffering, causing the ornament wheel of inexhaustible qualities to arise. Expansive activity increases beings' qualities and fulfills all desires and hopes. Powerful activity harmoniously gathers beings, and through the great river of empowerment ripens the unripened extensively. Wrathful activity cuts through the vicious, presses the three realms into the expanse, and having overwhelmed the three realms, liberates samsara into nirvana, establishing all in the fruition of supreme awakening.
These four activities—peaceful, expansive, powerful, wrathful—are the skillful means by which Buddhas work with beings. Not everyone needs the same medicine. Some need peace, some need expansion, some need empowerment, some need wrathful intervention. The Buddha knows what each being needs and responds appropriately.
This is the completion of the discussion of spontaneous accomplishment. The path is complete. The ground has been explained, the path detailed, the fruition described. Everything is present, complete, spontaneously accomplished.
What are you going to do with it?
[17096-17109] 
The Buddha activity—body, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity—adorned by the ornament wheel's pure realm, completely perfect and greatly expanded. This is the fruition, the result of all practice. Not just personal enlightenment, but the complete manifestation of all enlightened qualities.
From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Gyud, the tantra of Lion Power Great Perfection:
"Buddha activity accomplishes the essence,
Buddha activity does what needs to be done,
Divided, shown as four aspects."
And then: Emaho!
Peaceful and expansive,
Likewise powerful and wrathful—
Peaceful gathers into dharma-nature expanse,
Expansive shows various essences,
Powerful ripens the unripened,
Wrathful cuts through everything completely.
These are the four types of enlightened activity. Don't think "activity" means doing things in the ordinary sense. This is Buddha-activity—spontaneous, natural, effortless manifestation that benefits beings according to their needs. Sometimes peaceful, sometimes expansive, sometimes powerful, sometimes wrathful. All are compassion in different forms.
[17110-17120] 
This is the conclusion of the 25th chapter on spontaneous accomplishment, the final chapter. Thus, the mansion of excellent explanation, the jewel mansion, reaches the end of the dharmadhatu sky, completely arranged without exception, vast collections of inexhaustible Dharma topics, fulfilling the hopes of embodied beings, raining down like the wish-fulfilling jewel.
The glorious auspicious sun of bliss increases the feast of joy. The Teacher's Dharma rain falls in the three worlds. Those with various trainees to guide, possessing limitless followers—among them, the peak of great perfection, supreme and secret—this amazing, wondrous, authentic offering, clearly opened.
Longchenpa is describing his own work! Not with pride, but with dedication. He's offering this Treasury as a jewel mansion, a stupa of Dharma, reaching to the ends of space, benefiting all beings.
[17121-17135] 
The object of the Omniscient Lord of Mind's activity is whatever spreads through the realm of beings with fortune. The stainless, dust-free, fresh red sun beautifies the mansion of my intelligence. Even very difficult to realize realms should be seen by self and others.
Whatever appears as the nature of this—the place of deep ocean waves, the lake of unprecedented wisdom, even shaking the throne of conceptual fixation—the glorious great lake Unshakable, that unmoving, without waves or disturbance, deep and vast, difficult to realize, that has today appeared before my mind.
He's describing the nature of mind itself—the ocean of wisdom, unmoving, deep, vast. And he's saying: today, it has appeared. Not "I realized it" but "it appeared"—as if the wisdom dawned on its own, through the power of the practice and dedication.
[17136-17147] 
The ocean of vidyadharas, the assembly of oath-bound protectors, open the eye of delight in this. Through the profound and vast vajra realm, this stainless jewel mansion, extremely clear in nature, makes the Luminosity Heart Essence teaching remain long in the world, revealing the good path for the fortunate, causing the lotus of liberation to bloom.
From the sleep of the powerful holy elephant, concerned that the profound key points would be scattered and lost in other established philosophical systems, without delay, in the 25th chapter of Buddha's collection, gathering the heart meaning in one direction, I respectfully made it a support for the mind.
This is Longchenpa's explanation of why he wrote this text—to preserve the profound teachings from being lost, to gather the essential meaning, to make it accessible while keeping it profound.
[17148-17226] 
The text continues with extensive architectural metaphors comparing this Treasury to a great stupa, a mansion, a mountain of Dharma. The unsurpassed vehicle's Mount Meru, spontaneously high, the four-sided vase completely round, the conch of profound instruction, the wheel of Dharma limitless, the sun and moon of base, path, and fruition moved by wind, the flower and bell completely raised, the white parasol's peak, the jewel pinnacle vast.
This is the completion, the sealing of the entire work. After 415 pages, 25 chapters, thousands of verses—Longchenpa has built a mansion of Dharma, a stupa of wisdom, a treasury of jewels. And he offers it to you.
[17215-17218] 
Listen to this call to action: "Therefore, faithful ones desiring liberation, strive to enter this jewel treasury! Having separated from the darkness of non-recognition, luminosity manifest, in this life go to the other shore of the three realms' ocean!"
This is it! The whole point. Don't just read—enter! Don't just study—realize! Go to the other shore in this very life. This is possible. This is what Longchenpa is offering you.
The rest of the page is dedication of merit—offering the virtue of composing this immense work to all beings, wishing them to pacify the defilements of mind, to realize self-knowing luminosity like the sun and moon, to obtain the ground of spontaneously accomplished vajra peak possessing all supreme qualities, and to accomplish benefit and happiness for beings without separation of body and wisdom.
This is how you complete a Dharma text—with dedication, with offering, with the vow to benefit all beings. Take this into your heart. Don't let it be just words. Let it transform you!
Listen to this dedication! "Possessing a garland of lightning of the great cloud of excellent explanation, the rain of nectar of words and meaning falls from the path of the mind's sky." Longchenpa is saying: this text is like a storm of blessings!
The excellent explanation (*legs bshad*) is the great cloud (*sprin chen*). The hearing (*thos pa*) is the lightning (*glog*) that illuminates. From the sky of mind (*yid mkha'*), the rain of nectar (*bdud rtsi'i char*) falls. This fulfills the hopes of all beings without exception, increases the merit and harvest, and with the prosperity of the Victorious Ones, fills all beings with satisfaction, dispelling the poverty of existence and peace.
This is how you close a Dharma text—not with "The End" but with "May all benefit!" Every word written, every page composed, becomes an offering to all beings. This is the bodhisattva vow in action.
The elements of all directions, as long as embodied beings remain—may this treasury of holy Dharma remain and accomplish limitless benefit and happiness! May the world and all beings, blissful and prosperous like the god realms, all abide on the path of liberation and simultaneously attain Buddhahood!
These aren't empty wishes. When a master like Longchenpa dedicates merit, it has power. He's not just hoping—he's establishing a connection, a field of merit that extends through time and space to benefit beings far into the future. Including you, right now, reading this.
May all sentient beings, completely victorious over existence, without effort attain nirvana! May samsara be emptied and the grove of peace expand! May they become Dharma Kings of spontaneously accomplished twofold benefit!
The twofold benefit (*don gnyis*) is benefit for self and benefit for others. This is the mark of a Buddha—not just personal liberation, but the capacity to liberate all beings. And Longchenpa dedicates his work toward this end for all.
Through this supreme virtue, the source of benefit and happiness, may the Buddha's teachings spread and expand! May the glory of the jewel of limitless qualities blaze! May the holy Dharma of luminosity-heart essence expand!
He's dedicating to the preservation and spread of the teachings. Not just his own text, but the entire Dharma. This is vast mind—beyond personal achievement, beyond sectarian concerns, toward the welfare of all beings through the preservation of the teachings.
Leading limitless beings to the ground of near-peace with limitless life, beautified by forests, lakes, islands, flower-medicine realms everywhere, possessing eyes, clairvoyance, and concentration that discover unprecedented Dharma treasures, may they be filled with the fame and praise, the sound of drums, worshipped by Brahma and others, kinnaras!
This is pure land imagery—the vision of a world transformed by Dharma. But it's not just imagination; it's the result of practice. When you cultivate virtue, when you dedicate merit, you create the causes for such a world to manifest. This is how reality is shaped—through intention, through dedication, through the power of virtue.
Transcending the path of the thousand-light-ray doer, infinitely vast, praised by the Victorious Ones as the ornament of the world, the supreme medicinal eye—through whatever auspiciousness beautifies all beings, falling like rain as praise-songs and flowers, may this supreme Dharma system fill the realms with an ocean of auspiciousness!
May my activity, establishing an ocean of bliss-joy completely, be like that, maturing the ocean of beings dwelling in hundreds of oceans, pleasing them all!
Longchenpa is dedicating his merit to span countless realms, countless eons, countless beings. This isn't modesty—this is the natural expression of realized mind. When you realize the nature of reality, your benefit for beings becomes as vast as space itself.
Those whose wisdom and concentration are as vast as the sky-expanse, whose thought and conduct are vast oceans, immeasurable, vast in benefiting others, whose luminosity sun-moon appearance is vast, whose activities are vast, whose unchanging dharma-nature appearance enters the vast dharmadhatu—may they all!
This is the final dedication. Vastness upon vastness. The realized mind isn't small, isn't limited, isn't constrained by ordinary conceptions. It's as vast as space, as deep as the ocean, as luminous as the sun and moon.
This is what you've been reading. This is what Longchenpa offers. Don't let it be just words—let it transform your mind into this same vastness!
