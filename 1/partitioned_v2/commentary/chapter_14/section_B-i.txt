[1250-1265] Listen here, dear practitioner! You wander through six realms chasing phantoms, yet the lamp of self-light has never stopped radiating within you! Look—though it abides in your very heart, you do not know your own face. Like a blind man sitting before a mirror, you see nothing!
Consider how this light manifests: In humans, it appears as example and sign. In gods, clearly visible. In demigods, subtle and refined. In animals, merely dwelling in their own abode. In hungry ghosts, flickering like a dying flame. In hell beings, small as a sesame seed—yet still present! Six lights abide thus, though beings do not recognize them.
[1266-1269] Mark this well! That light within the heart is merely resonance itself. Do not confuse it with the light of karmic ripening that gods see from afar—that is contaminated virtue-result, not the self-light of heart-essence! One is like the moon's reflection in water; the other is the moon itself.
[1270-1302] Now, for those trained in the path, appearance manifests in nine aspects—hear them! Abode: Five self-lights spontaneously accomplished in the heart, five colors' thigles, five kayas as father-mother mandalas. Path: arising from distant visibility. Field: empty as sky. Body: upward appearance of five kayas and four wisdoms. Eye: self-arisen wisdom lamp knowing its own face. Essence: all-clear wisdom without ceasing. Example: like crystal. Time: appears in this life if experienced; naturally arises in bardo. Liberation place: original primordially-pure jewel secret cavity.
Understand this, fortunate one! What you seek outside has never been apart from you—not for a single instant! The nine aspects are complete in your own heart-mandala right now. Stop searching!
Emaho! The self-light of original purity!
[1303-1326] Listen, friend! These appearances aren't somewhere else—they're the play of your own mind right now. When outer light draws inward, when ground is seized and crystal light gathers within, this is like abiding as the basis of arising without clear form, yet clarity itself is never absent.
Look here! The Self-Arisen One explains how light, kaya, and primordial wisdom; the consort mother, elements, and aggregates; ground and Buddha family—all these are one taste, not separate things. To all beings this abides in their very own body. Don't seek it elsewhere!
That appearance of great wisdom abides in the center of your tsitta—your own heart center! The path arises from inside like an ocean; the field is the empty sky; the body is kayas and wisdom; the eye is the lamp of wisdom; the essence is the all-clear mirror. See how everything is perfect complete right where you are?
The example is the stainless lapis crystal kaya. The time is the dharmata intermediate state. When you arrive at the extent of the jewel cavity—this is it! If these appearances are seen as they are, this is called 'the manner of appearance of pure one-cutting in this intermediate state.' Recognize it now, don't wait for later!
[1327-1375] When the measure arrives—when the portion liberated from the binding of the five aggregates occurs—inside tone arises outward, and the great appearance of five lights arises in the sky above. From that itself comes the appearance of pure one-cutting.
Listen carefully! In the sky of pure wisdom, five lights unchanging and clear arise. Also five clusters of five arise in the manner of father-mother union. Here are the colors and their meaning:
Blue—Vairocana kaya, dharmadhatu wisdom, Akashadhatvishvari mother, empty sky element, form aggregate, ground of completed action, Thus-Come family.
White—Vajrasattva kaya, mirror wisdom, Mamaki mother, great river element, perception aggregate, ground of relinquished action, vajra family.
Yellow—Ratnasambhava kaya, equality wisdom, Buddha-Lochana mother, great producing ground element, formation aggregate, ground of various arising, jewel family.
Red—Amitabha kaya, discriminating wisdom, Pandaravasini mother, burning fire element, consciousness aggregate, ground showing aspects, lotus family.
Green—Amoghasiddhi kaya, all-accomplishing wisdom, Samayatara mother, supporting wind element, feeling aggregate, ground of finished action, karma family.
Emaho! Five lights, five colors, five kayas, five wisdoms, five mothers, five elements, five aggregates—all complete in your own mind! Don't think this is far away. It's right here, right now, the natural display of your own rigpa! Recognize, recognize, recognize!
[1376-1404] Now listen, dear one! The third topic: the manner of appearance in the intermediate state. In the dharmata-bardo, five wisdom lights dawn; from the final of the twenty-one sense-powers, the dharmata-bardo sets. But in the existence-bardo, beings rely upon impure light within themselves. There too, resonance dawns as six individual types.
From the Self-Arising Tantra: six impure delusion lights—at the final of the final sense-power, white dawns and yellow dawns, red dawns and green, likewise dark-blue dawns, flickering in a smoky manner. This is that impure delusion light. Thus when lights are summarized: delusion-light for unrealized beings and wisdom-light for realized ones—these two gather.
From that itself: light distinction is beyond thought! Pure wisdom light and impure delusion light are to be regarded. The expanse possesses light, thus body-wisdom-appearance is clear. Even in this delusion-time now, the appearance of five elements as five colors has not gone beyond—all beings dwell in that very nature! The Buddhas' exhaustion-meditations, rays, measureless bodies emanate, and also arise from that.
[1405-1419] The third meaning: dependent wisdom distinction in three aspects—essence, distinction, and distinction of certain terms explanation. First, essence: primordially uncompounded awareness. From expanse-rigpa, primordially-pure dharmata-emptiness nature dawns. From the Rigpa Rang-shar Great Tantra: Kye-ma! Secret-lord, certainly retain—non-dharma wisdom is self-arisen, all dharmas within become born, from that wisdom arising.
Second, distinction: the five wisdoms, when with defilement time, included by being-mindstream, are called naturally-spontaneously-accomplished wisdom.
Emaho! Wisdom lights in bardo are none other than your own mind's display! Recognize the pure, don't follow the impure. The difference is only recognition or non-recognition!
[1420-1428] Listen, practitioner! When defilements are purified and Buddha is realized, two pristine cognitions manifest as result—hear this distinction! There is the Buddha of realized manifestation and the Buddha of nature's spontaneous accomplishment. Though the primordial nature is spontaneously established, one must still realize and manifest it.
The term "pristine cognition" has no definitive fixed meaning—like pointing at the sky, the finger is not the sky itself!
[1429-1501] Three distinctions and two certain terms—pay attention! First, the five aspects: dharmadhatu pristine cognition without concept, mirror-like without ceasing yet clear, equality pristine cognition unmixed and complete, discerning pristine cognition realizing like before, action-accomplishing pristine cognition completing dharmas.
Apply word-meanings thus: dharmadhatu pristine cognition—great emptiness as object, clear light as appearance, pristine cognition as awareness engaging objects. These three gathered are called "expanse"—with two aspects: pure pristine cognition expanse and impure beings' expanse.
Mirror-like pristine cognition—example: mirror mandala. Whatever conditions come, it shows them. Similarly, stainless awareness becomes afflicted by conditions, yet when liberated through introduction, you know your own mark!
Equality pristine cognition—dharmas equal in essence, falling in no direction, equality Buddha lord of all. Discerning pristine cognition—awareness realizing various aspects separately. Action-accomplishing—whatever appears, awareness' nature is complete, action without concept.
Thus, know the great pristine cognition! Realize authentically, liberate with certainty!
Emaho! The five pristine cognitions complete in awareness!
[1503-1515] Listen here, friend! From the sutras we learn: ka, by not-born, all dharmas' door is thus—each word, each letter, each meaning applies and explains. But in some new tantras, the explanation of letter sounds also has faults in how it arises. If you think there's no difference between mantra and free translation, you're mistaken!
From the sutra treatises: briefly-explained, extensively-explained, and meaning-summarized—threefold application—and in those too, faults are observed. The nature-complete Great Completion tantras' instruction-tantras are easy to understand; each letter is spoken to be easy to understand. Great panditas, knowing each language correctly, attained realization; through their self-translation, they established difficult-to-understand expanse letters and sounds, translating and arranging them mistake-free and easy to understand. A translator endowed with kindness surpasses others. Thus the five wisdoms, from individually separate, become twenty-five, and with distinction parts as explained before—finished.
[1516-1544] The fourth meaning: enlightened-activity distinction in three aspects—four kinds of enlightened-activity essence briefly explained, nature complete manner progressively extensively explained, self-appearance dawn manner kind meaning summarized.
First, in essence: definite-word, distinction, mudra, deity-assembly, essence, mandala—and from these seven. The enlightened-activity essence meaning twofold spontaneously complete: wisdom essence dwells itself. From Rang-shar: all enlightened-activity wisdom, all actions do. From that: enlightened-activity buddha itself is called, action wisdom experience takes, enlightened-activity self itself speaks, from I arisen and I complete, complete ground likewise.
Distinction four: also from that—pacifying and enriching and likewise power and fierce are regarded.
Emaho! Four enlightened activities spontaneously complete! Don't think you need to add anything. All accomplishing is already accomplished in the nature of mind itself!
[1545-1562] Listen, dear practitioner! The mandala is not something to be drawn—it is primordially adorned, self-complete, and exists within yourself right now! The mudra is not something to transform—the ground itself is complete enlightenment, supreme body of the five kayas appearing. The deity-assembly is not produced—it is primordially complete, peaceful and wrathful, dwelling within your own being.
The mantra essence: channel-center letter wheel and that essence—four lamps as objects dawn. This too from the Self-Arising Tantra: all enlightened-activity mandala is not to be sought—it exists within the self; all enlightened-activity mudra is not to be transformed—it is complete within the four; all enlightened-activity deity-assembly is complete within one's own body; all enlightened-activity essence is called the great lamp of wisdom.
See how everything is already perfect? Don't go looking outside!
[1563-1587] Second: the nature-complete manner progressively extensively explained in two aspects—the original ground complete manner and the being-time complete manner. First, in two aspects from: generally shown.
The ground is originally primordially-pure; within, five wisdom lights in the depth of expanse are clear blue-green—all expanse is this; the dawn-basis of four enlightened-activity lights dwells, not to be counted. White, yellow, red, green—four that from blazing enlightened-activity explained. From that: that also four enlightened-activity meaning, blue-green itself is complete.
Four kinds of enlightened-activity ground are complete, therefore the color blue-green is explained. Four kinds of enlightened-activity meaning: ground is well complete, that also shows this thus. Color white and red various light, descended complete in the ground—white possesses the pacifying mandala; yellow is enriching light; red is regarded as power light; green is spoken as fierce light; blue-green is enlightened-activity complete light.
Emaho! Four lights, four activities—all spontaneously complete within your own mind! Don't think you need to create them!
[1600-1609] Listen well, dear one! When yellow increases from reality, all qualities arise—like a wish-fulfilling jewel fulfilling every need and desire! This is the great increase of reality, arising various qualities to liberate all beings.
[1610-1621] Three powers—attend! Red power of reality establishes without seeking—power of dharmakaya essence! Like yellow gold needing no seeking, the great mandala of ground-appearance needs no searching for its power. Reality's basis is power complete!
[1622-1636] Four fiercenesses—mark this! Green reality fierce—all fierce aspects complete! The basis itself pure as reality, arising without obstruction! Like wind's emanation moving without obstruction, from great ground-appearance pristine cognition arises without obstruction. What need for pristine cognition? Activity pure essence! Thus basis' essence is activity mandala complete!
[1637-1664] Four aspects for beings' time completion: First, pacifying—all beings' elements are self-arisen pristine cognition in the heart, white self-light of pacifying resonance abiding in the cit-ta mandala, soft and supple, white light-rays spreading like body, speech, and mind, all-pervading pristine cognition possessing crown ornament, abiding like pacifying mandala.
Second, increasing—unchangeable channel-heart light expands the body, great increasing activity! In the great unchangeable channel, body of great increasing activity, five lights expanding five bodies, awareness body expanding expanse, bodies of pristine cognition expanding expanse, light-rays expanding expanse—thus body and pristine cognition in non-abiding mandala, entering Buddha's path!
Emaho! Four activities spontaneously accomplishing!
[1665-1709] Listen, fortunate practitioner! Four powers gather in this appearance—understand! Bardo reality's pure appearance gathers four powers: distant-grasping and direct light-luminous two powers gather; expanse progress pristine cognition four-link power gathers; bindu measure reaching union mandala appearance power gathers; wisdom exhaustion spontaneous-accomplishment appearance power gathers.
From Self-Arising: activity power mandala! Self abiding in conch-shell mandala, four aspects of lamp clear, showing this: awareness' expanse by lamp, body pristine cognition power gathers; bindu empty by lamp, outer element power gathers; wisdom self-arisen by lamp, self that power gathers; distant-grasping water lamp by, delusion that power gathers; awareness concept-free great by, concept affliction power gathers—unchangeable great Buddha path, bardo appearance power gathers! Thus power mandala, self body complete!
Four fierceness: awareness resonance mind projects and gathers, realizes assembly, affliction possessing sense-faculty each gate exit arises! Not realizing, samsara itself not revolving produces delusion-appearance. Realizing, power trains, arises-by arises-liberated type without, like water dissolving into water-wave, awareness-top dissolves action!
From Self-Arising: fierce Buddha activity! Self to sense-faculty gate, fierce activity mandala abides! Eye sense-faculty not ceasing, object grasping concept explains fierce activity! Consciousness object arises, fierce mandala one—think! Affliction thousand thousand eighty itself, object arises engages, fierce activity shows! Thus activity four aspects, self-self body complete!
Emaho! Power mandala of spontaneous accomplishment!
From the *Rang Shar* Tantra—don't look for these four activities outside. They're your own mind's display. The path is complete right here.
Emaho! Four activities, four opportunities!
