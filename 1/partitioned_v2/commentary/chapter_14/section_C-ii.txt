[Line range] Don't miss this teaching, friend! It's pointing directly to your own nature.
The Great Perfection reveals that samsara and nirvana are not two different places. They're like two ways of seeing the same thing—like seeing a rope as a snake in dim light. The rope never was a snake; you just didn't see clearly.
Your confusion and your wisdom come from the same source. They're not enemies—just different manifestations of your own mind's power.
Recognition happens in an instant. Like turning on a light in a dark room. The darkness didn't go anywhere; light just revealed what was always there.
Emaho! Clear light dawns!
