[636-639] Five waters continue—together with all your bones, all your blood, all your lymph. They abide in your two eyes, moistening everything without holding to any fixed essence. This is the nature of water wisdom—not grasping, just flowing, just nourishing. Feel that moisture in your eyes right now? That's not just biology, friend—that's wisdom displaying!
[640-653] Five spaces, from Self-Arising Tantra:
- Space pervading all in common
- Space of clear tone without object
- Pure unmixed space
- Space indicating meaning
- Space liberating into pure field
These aren't five different spaces somewhere in the clouds! They're connected with actual awareness, five lights, the lamp of pure expanse, wisdom of signs, and the twenty-one pointing-out instructions. Certain confidence in example and meaning—this is what points you to what's already here!
[654-657] So all these five elements' awareness attributes summarized—they're the great elements. Their basis is the small elements. This completes the fifteenth division from the Treasury: Showing the Place of the Elements. Don't think you're done learning, though—this was just the foundation!
[658-663] Now that we've established elements as basis, we move to the fourfold purity of what's supported—the expanse and wisdom:
- Basis: the kayas
- Tone: the light
- Supported: the wisdom
- Activities: enlightened actions
See the structure? Foundation first, then what rests upon it. Don't try to understand kayas without understanding what they rest upon!
[664-676] First, the kayas—two aspects:
1. General presentation of three kayas' expanse
2. Particular explanation of five kayas
Three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects, though essence is one. From Self-Arising: "Three kayas, wisdom-appearance, without obstruction to anything, perceived objects being one, essence appearing individually." Not three separate things—one awareness, three ways of shining!
[677-684] This is how awareness itself appears:
- Awareness without thought = dharmakaya essence
- Awareness uncensored and clear = sambhogakaya
- Awareness appearing as whatever = nirmanakaya
Complete. Awakened. Right here, right now—not somewhere else, not later!
Emaho!
[685-705] Three aspects of expansion—first, completion. From Self-Arising: in the pure appearance of three kayas, one complete, two complete, all complete! Wisdom appearing unceasing and clear. Don't you see? It's not that you have to complete something—it's already complete! Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating. In awareness free from concept, five lights unceasing and clear. In great self-liberation without grasping, outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.
Listen to this carefully: "In awareness released from action, actor and acted complete in single moment." Not gradually, not step by step—in one moment! In awareness separated from mind, all variety complete. In great clear purity, deluded appearances complete. In great self-liberated self-appearance, other-arisen dharmas complete. Such is the manner of three kayas' completion. Not something you're working toward—what you already are!
[706-714] Awakening—what does it mean? Being without dualistic grasping. From the same nature:
- Without action, delusion awakens
- Without concept, afflictions awaken
- Without grasping, self-arising awakens
- Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens
- Without attachment, ignorance awakens
See the pattern? Nothing to do, nowhere to go! Just stop grasping and what was confused awakens to what it always was. This is the manner of three kayas' awakening!
[715-727] Expansion—qualities primordially accomplished, spontaneously expansive. From Self-Arising:
- In awareness free from concept, five lights clear, wisdom expansive
- In awareness free from actor/acted, three kayas expand without perceived object
- In awareness appearing without object, five lights expand without grasping mind
- In awareness great wisdom, self-appearance with meaning, fruit expands
Not acquiring qualities—recognizing what already is!
[728-750] Now the expansive explanation of place—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya has ten aspects: essence, definition, self-body, metaphor, sign, appearance, place, characteristic, object, intent.
Essence: empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence. Unchanging, cessation without, pervading three—this is dharmakaya essence. Definition: expanse primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya. Essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion.
Emaho! Three kayas complete, awakened, and expansive right now!
[751-756] Definition of dharmakaya—naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding. From Self-Arising: fearless, empty, and clear, all actions complete. This is dharmakaya's definition. Don't be afraid of emptiness, friend! It's not nothingness—it's clarity itself!
[757-762] Self-body—freed from all extremes of elaboration, without accomplishment anywhere. No outer, no inner, no within expanse. This is dharmakaya's self-body. Stop looking for it as something to find or achieve!
[763-774] Metaphors for dharmakaya—six beautiful images from Self-Arising:
- Like sun: through clear-light awareness, illuminating all
- Like ocean: through depth, vast and profound
- Like lotus: unstained by defects, pure by nature
- Like mountain: unchanging, immovable
- Like space: vast without boundary or center
- Like lion: possessing primordial confidence that surpasses all
Sun, ocean, lotus, mountain, space, lion—these are dharmakaya's metaphors. Not mere poetry! Each points to a quality of your own mind right now!
[775-779] Sign—transcending going and coming. Without going, without coming, without abiding. This is dharmakaya's self-sign. Not somewhere you travel to!
[780-784] Appearance—like empty-clarity of sky's expanse. Unceasing clear tone, empty by essence. This is dharmakaya's appearance. Clear yet empty, appearing yet unreal—like the sky!
[785-789] Place—great pure memory-thought. Without limit, without object, without grasping. This is dharmakaya's place. Not a location on a map!
[790-795] Characteristic—essence, nature, compassion, three inseparable. This is dharmakaya's characteristic. Not one, not three—indivisible!
[796-802] Object—self-clear awareness, empty without extremity, adorned within by five lights, spontaneously accomplished. In great inseparability of expanse and awareness. Clear, luminous, unmixed—this is dharmakaya's object.
[803-806] Intent—view unsevered by direction or side, meditation not established as entity or sign, conduct transcending apprehending and grasping.
Emaho! Dharmakaya complete in ten aspects!
[807-823] Dharmakaya's conduct—free from cessation, fixation, attachment. Not something you do, friend—it's what remains when you stop doing! Meditation—crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering. Not a technique, just recognition! View—unseen, yet seeing-complete. Not something to look at, but the looking itself! Fruition—unmade, unarisen, free from arising. Already perfect, never needed making! Activity—nothing to accomplish, yet accomplished-complete. Enlightened activity happens without anyone doing it!
[824-839] Now Sambhogakaya—five aspects. Essence from Self-Arising: birth exists yet death-free, possessing vajra. Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear. Five fathers, five fields, five clusters. Five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations. Five bases, five paths, five fruitions. Five abodes, five fields, five essences. This is sambhogakaya's essence—complete display of enlightenment!
[840-847] Though expressed as birth from expanse, birth lacks self-characteristic—death-free! Death-lord demon conquered. From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges. Arisen wisdom transcends all arising. Realizing wisdom transforms meaning. In vast kayas, outer and inner clear.
[848-858] Five lights: blue, white, yellow, red, green. Five kayas: essence-expanse, unchanging vajra, dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Five fathers: Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.
All this richness—not separate from you! Complete mandala of enlightenment right here!
Emaho!
[866-869] Five mothers: Akashagarbha, Buddha-Lochana, Mamaki, Pandaravasini, Samayatara. Five clusters surrounded by five buddhas, periphery ornamented by five lights' enclosure.
[872-884] Five primordials: paths primordially complete, kayas primordially established, rigpa primordially arisen, five lights primordially resonant, defilements primordially liberated. See? Not becoming pure—pure from the beginning!
Five knowledges from realization extent: know as five kayas, five wisdoms, five lights, self-appearance, great liberation free from duality.
[885-896] Five realizations: realize field as expanse, beings as kayas, appearance as light, arise-liberation free from category, wisdom as rigpa.
Five bases: light-clear basis is rigpa, phenomena basis is kunzhi, delusion basis is sems, path basis is lamp, thought basis is wisdom.
[897-902] Five common paths: accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, no-more-learning.
[903-908] Five uncommon paths: dharmata path of expanse, rigpa path of knowledge, light-clear path of two lamps, trekcho path of arise-liberation, thogal path of expanse-rigpa.
[909-920] Five fruitions: wisdom fruition liberated in rig, light fruition delusion-appearance ceases, realization fruition delusion-thought clears, self-appearance fruition brought to exhaustion, final fruition dissolves into expanse.
Five abodes: thigle abode in heart, wisdom abode in crown, lamp abode in eyes, expanse-appearance abode in sky, liberation-place abode in primordial purity.
[921-933] Five fields: rigpa's field is expanse, lamp's field is sky, wisdom's field is bardo, light's field is self-appearance, sambhogakaya's field is cluster.
Five essences: rigpa's essence primordial purity, wisdom's essence spontaneous accomplishment, light's essence five aspects, discriminating awareness essence realization, lamp's essence empty-clarity.
All these fives—just one display! Don't get lost counting, friend!
Emaho!
[934-937] In these five aspects appearing, some are sambhogakaya's essence, some field, some method, some appearance, some wisdom itself. Thus Longchenpa explains sambhogakaya as one unified essence appearing fivefold. Not five separate things—one display with five faces!
[938-943] Etymology of sambhogakaya—"longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku" means complete with qualities, engaging pure light-clarity, both benefits spontaneously complete, wisdom arrived at full measure, with marks, signs, body of radiating light rays.
[944-977] From Self-Arising, the complete explanation:
- Abiding in empty dharmata—complete
- Clear, unmixed, pervading all—complete
- In five wisdoms, gathering and separating not—complete
- Unequal to all, individual marks—complete
- Method and wisdom inseparable—complete
- Five appearances without marks—engage
- Without grasping, self-clear, playing in all—engage
- Crystal-clear, lucid, equally abiding—engage
- Vivid, soft, abiding in field, distributing emanations—engage
- Intent on two kayas, play to the extent—engage
All actions transcended—complete! Arisen from state, not made—complete! Emptiness-wisdom endowed. Clear without thought, grasping nonexistent. This is sambhogakaya's richness—not separate from your own clear awareness right now!
[978] Third, the characteristics...
Emaho! The complete enjoyment body!
[979-984] Characteristics of sambhogakaya: mandalas of five families, unmixed, clear in tone. From Self-Arising: individual colors unmixed, marks held. Marks and exemplary features excellent, light rays blazing. Father, mother, and kaya form held. Rich display of enlightenment—not abstract, vividly present!
[986-993] Manner of appearance: from single nature of rigpa, from expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates performing benefit. Kaya of rigpa unmoving from expanse, without change—two completions in field of self-appearance light-clarity. Inner and outer appearance. From same nature: in one nature, two essences—this is sambhogakaya's appearance.
[994-1014] Manner of abiding: expanse without acceptance or rejection, space without duality, vast expanse of five complete lights, abiding in great continuity of radiating emanations. From Self-Arising: correctly produced without reference, without mind of entering or liberation. How could grasping exist? Beyond words of attachment. Beyond abandoning object and abandoner. Beyond field, mind, intellect. In reference-free field, self-appearance cuts through words. Grasping-free, liberated in own place, emanations enacted in ten directions. In reference-pure field appearance, wisdom arises in one cut. From that, emanations widely arise. Sambhogakaya's abiding—not stuck anywhere, radiating everywhere!
[1015-1020] Third: Nirmanakaya's ground—five aspects: essence, etymology, characteristic, division, method of examination.
Emaho! Three kayas complete!
[1021] Essence of Nirmanakaya: from kaya of expanse and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya, performing benefit for others. Emanation—appearing for others' sake, not separate from dharmakaya and sambhogakaya.
[1022-1034] Etymology from Self-Arising—nine reasons it's called emanation-kaya:
1. Appearing suitable to world realm beings
2. Able to perform emanation-kaya's benefit
3. Performing all actions
4. Able to liberate countless beings into expanse
5. Brief in time in one field realm
6. Compassion arising without direction
7. Wrathful and fierce when needed
8. Peaceful and certain
9. Beings see as beautiful
All these ways compassion appears—not limited to peaceful forms!
[1036-1041] Characteristic: performing completion of two benefits for disciples. From Self-Arising: performing completion of actions, considered in two aspects.
[1042-1051] Divisions: generally nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, etc. Here, depending on completion of two benefits: emanation-kaya of completed actions and emanation-kaya of performing actions. Self-benefit spontaneously established—completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate. Through three connections' emanation, benefit for six realms' self-appearance. Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful. Samsara's self-appearance must be emptied, for delusion-appearance must be emptied.
[1052-1061] Common prayer: "May three lower realms be exhausted and emptied." For producing mind to liberate all beings. Particularly in bardo: releasing emanations, becoming Buddha—all actions. When six realms' stations appear in spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate, teaching Dharma performs benefit. By that cause, samsara becomes empty, dissolving into nirvana through spontaneous accomplishment—called "Buddha entering nirvana."
[1062] This crucial for all with wisdom!
[1063-1071] Appearance in emptiness for self-benefit, emanation arisen from oneself liberating oneself into expanse—called emanation-kaya of completed actions. From Self-Arising: liberating own continuum, manifestly awakened, then distributing emanations. Outer and inner actions complete. Thus considered emanation-kaya of completed actions.
Three kayas complete, friend—now recognize them in your own experience!
Emaho!
[1072-1080] Listen carefully, dear one! When seeing the eight gates of the spontaneously accomplished intermediate state completed, liberated by knowing one's own face—in that impure samsara gate, oneself radiating light rays from the secret space of sambhogakaya father-mother union, entering individually into pure wombs at each station, appearing to be born—through teaching Dharma, showing liberation.
This is like opening emanations in a dream, summarized merely as self-appearance. When channels and elements are nearly pure, in this life too the six realms appear inside the thigle, bound by three inner crucial points, reaching exhaustion ground—not depending on distributing emanations. This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, that is the power of realization.
[1081-1100] Second, the emanation-kaya of performing actions: to those abiding on the grounds, sambhogakaya appears; to the impure, supreme emanation-kaya appears; to the very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to their stations, performing benefit. From the Self-Arising Tantra: showing to each whatever tames them, appearing suitable to others—not deluded regarding others' benefit, able to transform into anything.
Afflictions are naturally nonexistent, yet latencies appear like a body. To beings arrived at the right time, showing great correct benefit. To whatever beings are to be tamed, appearing suitable to that very being.
[1101-1107] That emanation-kaya performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges: teaching Dharma in each being's own language; knowing faculties and latencies, showing what is suitable to that thought; great vehicle, small vehicle, various vehicles, secret mantra generation and completion stages.
Emaho! Emanation-kaya's skillful means are limitless! Like a master illusionist, the Buddha appears in whatever form benefits each being!
[1108-1113] Individual individuals, mind, wisdom, kunzhi—showing kunzhi as dharmakaya and so forth, though shown in many ways, the nature of Great Completion does not appear infinitely to all through the path, but only to some capable ones.
[1114-1137] From Self-Arising: knowing all languages, showing that in whichever language. Gathering suitable with suitability—some through words, some through dependent arising, some through aspiration and application, some through generation, some through both, some through five enlightenments, some through three samadhis, some showing expanse and wisdom. Great Completion meaning is without contradiction place, appearing to some persons with karma. Thus showing: some showing rigpa as empty, some showing absence-of-rigpa as empty, some showing rigpa-not as inert, some showing rigpa alone, some showing kunzhi as dharmakaya, some showing without virtue or non-virtue, some showing possessing meditation, some showing without meditation. Thus by emanation-kaya that shows.
[1138-1148] The unsurpassable secret mantra meaning was not spoken to some; what was not spoken does not become spoken. Though on occasion it becomes spoken, arhats, solitary realizers, and sutras—within which the name 'lower vehicle' does not exist—become proclaimers of unsurpassable vehicle. Therefore hidden from others of inferior mind, that person possessing those is considered emanation-kaya of performing actions.
[1149-1157] Although Great Completion may arise, from up to secretmost cycle of instructions of mind-vast and this instruction, know that this unsurpassable Heart Essence, not arising from existence of infinitely long path, is very rare enumeration of Dharma. Therefore similar to jewel, it should be held as precious treasure. In Supreme Sutra: because arising is rare, because stainless, because possessing power, and because becoming ornament of world—therefore jewel itself.
Emaho! Rare and precious Heart Essence!
[1158-1173] Fifth, method of examining emanation-kaya: Teaching Dharma with benefit and happiness to common beings through Buddha's emanation, the two benefits appear somewhat similar. From Self-Arisen: know the method of examining emanation—even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere. In crown ushnisha, one cluster of hair curling to the right; in heart center, form of vajra; birth in royal caste or high caste. Conducting conduct suitable to whatever, following whatever is spoken, not establishing one's own preferred desires. Deed, effort, and grasping naturally nonexistent, clearing doubt of whatever beings desire. Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya.
[1174-1176] Although these marks exist showing that as emanation, whether others are suitable emanations or not is uncertain. With pure mind produced, one should strive to tame one's own continuum.
[1177-1187] Second: individually explained, enumeration of five kayas—essence, etymology, appearance, division, meaning application. First, essence: blazing glory of complete marks and exemplary features. From Self-Arisen: essence possessing marks and exemplary features, nature holding individual marks.
[1188-1204] Second, etymology: called 'kaya of five families' because appearing as kayas of five different families. Third, appearance: appearing as father-mother kayas and wisdom. From Self-Arisen: appearing in manner of father-mother two—aspect holding father is kaya of method, aspect holding mother is kaya of wisdom. Method without cessation, wisdom without change.
Emaho! Five kayas complete!
[1205-1221] Fourth, divisions—two aspects. Division into five families: from that itself—family of Thus-Come, vajra family, jewel family, lotus family, karma family. Division into five kayas: Vairocana, Vajrasattva, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.
[1222-1237] Fifth, meaning application—two aspects. First, meaning application of five families: from Self-Arisen—in meaning of rigpa, Thus-Come family; in meaning of reason, vajra family because without birth and death; in meaning of rigpa, jewel family because various arise; in meaning of rigpa, lotus family because faultless and pure; in nature of rigpa, karma family because actions complete.
Second, meaning application of kayas: Vairocana because rigpa-appearance without cessation; Vajrasattva because rigpa realizes two benefits; Ratnasambhava because knowing through simultaneous rigpa; Amitabha because seeing one's own appearance; Amoghasiddhi because realizing rigpa without birth.
[1238-1249] Second benefit: detailed division of tone and light—two aspects: showing general abiding manner, individually explaining appearance manner. First: five lights of great chief, abiding as great spontaneous accomplishment primordially. Inside jewel-heart like risen crest, in center of clear light channels, in tone of five lights, wisdom of rigpa abides. From Self-Arisen: that appearance of great wisdom abides in center of tsitta.
Emaho! Five families and kayas!
Consider how this light manifests: In humans, it appears as example and sign. In gods, clearly visible. In demigods, subtle and refined. In animals, merely dwelling in their own abode. In hungry ghosts, flickering like a dying flame. In hell beings, small as a sesame seed—yet still present! Six lights abide thus, though beings do not recognize them.
Understand this, fortunate one! What you seek outside has never been apart from you—not for a single instant! The nine aspects are complete in your own heart-mandala right now. Stop searching!
Emaho! The self-light of original purity!
