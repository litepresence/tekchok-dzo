[1-2] 
Look here! Volume Two begins, and don't think this is just more of the same words. Longchenpa is shifting gears entirely. Volume One established the ground—*kun gzhi* and *chos sku*—but now he's bringing you face-to-face with how everything actually manifests. This is where the rubber meets the road.
[5-8] 
He's laid out the distinctions of alaya-ground and dharmakaya for you. Now he's turning to *rten 'byung*—dependent arising. But notice: he's not starting with some abstract philosophy about causes and conditions. He's starting with what's right in front of your nose—the elements themselves. There's the common way of understanding this, and then there's the deep individual nature of each element. Don't skip past this thinking you already know about earth, water, fire, wind, and space. You don't know them. Not yet.
[10-14] 
Two types of arising, he says. Outer and inner. Right there, stop! Don't immediately think "oh, outer means mountains, inner means my body." That's the trap. Longchenpa is pointing at how the very same five elements appear both as the world out there and as the channels, winds, and essences in your own vajra body. They arise from *rang shar*—self-arisen. You didn't create them. They didn't come from somewhere else. They're the spontaneous display of your own nature. Feel that?
[15-20] 
Listen closely now. The outer elements—earth, water, and so on—exist as the basis for the inner elements. They're connected, intertwined, inseparable. You can't have inner without outer, and here's the crucial point: neither samsara nor nirvana exist without depending on these two.
Emaho! What does this mean? It means your confusion and your enlightenment both depend on these very same five elements. Beings wander in the confused expanse of the five elements, yes, but they possess the *self-nature* of the great arising. That self-nature isn't dirty or broken—it's the same nature that Buddhas realize as pure. The only difference? Buddhas dwell in the five pure elements without the solidity of fixation, without the stains. The elements themselves don't change—you do!
[21-31] 
Pay attention to this distinction between great and small arising. The five great elements are luminosity-wisdom with five colors—the enlightened dimension of the elements. The five small elements are what you usually think of: solid earth, flowing water, and so on. But the pure elements? They're clear, warm, bright, cool, spacious, moving. These aren't poetic descriptions—they're the actual felt qualities when you recognize the elements as they truly are.
From the confused five elements, the five luminosities arrive in the expanse. This is key! The confused elements don't go anywhere. The luminosity arrives *within* them, meets them, transforms the meeting itself. Like the purity of spontaneously arisen appearance—it's not that you get rid of the appearance and replace it with purity. The appearance itself becomes recognized as pure.
[32-37] 
Now he's breaking down the small arising further: arising-form and actual arising. Arising-form is what appears outside—yes, the ordinary earth, water, fire, wind, space you see out your window. Actual arising refers to the five qualities within your body—the thin, and so forth, that become the basis for the inner arising. Your very body is composed of the same five elements, arranged differently. Pure realms have their own five dharma-elements, each distinct. This isn't just cosmology—it's a map of your own experience.
[38-43] 
Therefore—mark this word, "therefore"—all samsara and nirvana don't move from the expanse of the five elements. They never left. Before the five elements, there was no samsara, no nirvana. The elements are primordial. From the Self-Arisen tantra, he quotes: "Kye ho, Secret Lord, listen! The characteristics of the five arising—I show, you must understand."
Do you hear the urgency? This isn't academic. The tantra itself is saying: understand this! Not intellectually—directly. The five elements are not obstacles to enlightenment. They *are* enlightenment's display when recognized.
[44-55] 
The great arising, the Bhagavan, exists as the nature of all beings. All beings of the three realms move in the expanse of the five arising. Before the five arising existed, no Buddhas, no beings—not even names. The five arising themselves are the mother-expanse. Not established from the five arising—not even one being exists.
Read this carefully! "Not established from the five arising"—does this contradict what he just said? No! It completes it. Beings don't exist *from* or *apart from* the five elements. They are the five elements, and the five elements are empty of inherent existence. The two types of five arising of beings dwelling therein—this twofold nature is what you must recognize.
This page is the doorway. Walk through it.
[57-69] 
Now we're getting into the meat of it. Longchenpa is going to explain outer-arising in detail, and look at the structure—tenfold! He's laying out: essence, definitive terminology, purpose, characteristics, sequence of functions, dharma-nature, applied meaning, manner of liberation, division, and completeness. This isn't just a list; it's a complete mandala of understanding. Don't rush through these ten like they're boxes to check off. Each one is a doorway into direct recognition.
[70-79] 
First, the essence: Outer-arising appearing as form—what you see as earth, water, fire, wind, space—is the play of inner-arising's actuality. Do you hear this? That mountain you see outside? It's the play, the display, the sport of what's happening inside you. Gathered within the inner domain, these are the five elements. The outer five become the container, the world that holds sentient beings. The inner five become the support for mind and awareness itself.
This is crucial: your mind doesn't just happen to exist in a body made of elements. The very elements *are* the support for mind and *rig pa*—awareness. They're not separate from awareness; they're its foundation.
[80-87] 
From the Thalgyur tantra: The assertion is that from the particularities of general-common karma—yes, we share this world because of collective karma—and by individual karma-supports, relying upon the outer elements, karma itself, sustenance, faculties, entourage, and birth are complete.
Look at your life: your body, your senses, your relationships, your very birth—all of this depends on these five elements. This isn't theory; this is describing your actual situation right now.
[88-99] 
Second, definitive terminology. From the Self-Arisen again. Listen to these seven definitions of why they're called "great arising" (*'byung ba chen po*):
Not arisen through fabrication, spontaneously complete—they're not made by anyone, they just are. By that which produces, they are arising—they give rise to everything. By pervading all migrators—beings in all six realms—they're great. By simultaneous birth—everything arises at once, not sequentially—they're great. By existing in themselves—they don't depend on anything else. By being without change—their nature doesn't change even as their forms manifest. By appearing harmoniously—they work together perfectly.
This is the definitive terminology. Don't just memorize these seven; let them point you to the nature of the elements as they actually are.
[100-127] 
Third, the purpose—this is where it gets practical. From the Thalgyur:
Water gathers the clear essence and separates impurities—this is its function. In your body, water regulates heat and cold. Earth holds the foundation, establishes and coheres, ripens to produce roots (the channels), and its purpose is the relative thigle. Fire increases arising, ripens and clarifies, blazes and spreads to produce the eyes and senses—its purpose is warmth. Wind scatters and lifts, moves and quivers, holds the body together by moving—its purpose is the abode of mind.
The four elements (he's leaving out space for a moment) are the great mandala of self. They become the cause for accomplishing body, abide in the middle holding everything together, and in the end perform all functions of destruction. Through one cause—these elements appear as the master who performs all the various activities.
What is Longchenpa telling you? Your body isn't just flesh and bone—it's a mandala of elements, each with specific functions that support your very consciousness. When you meditate, when you practice, you're working with these elements. Understanding their purpose isn't academic—it's the basis of the completion stage practices!
[128-129] 
Fourth, characteristics—from among five. Earth's characteristic: solidity. This continues onto the next page, but already you can see: he's going to give you the specific characteristic of each element. Earth is solid. But don't think this means earth is just "hard stuff." Solidity here means stability, foundation, the quality of holding. This is the nature of earth as element—not just dirt, but the principle of stability itself.
Recognize these elements in your own experience. When you feel stable, grounded—that's earth. When you feel fluid, adaptable—that's water. When you feel clear, perceptive—that's fire. When you feel movement, change—that's wind. When you feel spacious, open—that's space. These aren't metaphors. This is how the elements actually appear in your mind and body.
[130-133] 
Continuing with the characteristics. Water's characteristic: moisture—not just wetness, but the quality of cohesion, binding things together, fluidity. Fire: warmth—not just heat, but the principle of transformation, maturation, clarity. Wind: movement—not just motion, but the principle of change, activity, dynamism. Space: openness and spaciousness—not just emptiness, but the principle of accommodation, the capacity to contain everything without obstruction.
These aren't abstract qualities. They're describing how the elements actually function in your experience and in the world. Feel them directly!
[134-145] 
Fifth, the sequence of functions. Now we get the embryology—the actual development of the body in the womb. From the Thalgyur:
Earth makes the basis of the body first. By producing, it ripens as flesh. Water gathers the entire body; by producing, it ripens as blood. Fire ripens the entire body; by producing, it ripens as warmth. Wind lifts the entire body; by producing, it makes breath ripen.
This is the order: earth establishes the foundation (flesh), water brings cohesion (blood), fire brings maturation (warmth), wind brings movement and vitality (breath). This isn't just physical development—it's the pattern of how manifestation occurs. Foundation first, then cohesion, then maturation, then dynamism. See this pattern everywhere!
[146-155] 
Sixth, dharma-nature. Though the elements are generally empty—yes, they're empty of inherent existence—here Longchenpa focuses on how they hold their own characteristic, their particular dharma-nature. From the Self-Arisen:
The cause of arising is earth—everything manifests from the ground, the basis. The wisdom of arising is fire—wisdom is the clarity, the knowing quality. The emanation of arising is wind—emanation is movement, activity, manifestation. The master of arising is water—water is the cohesive principle that holds everything together. The dharma-nature of arising is space—space is the fundamental nature, the openness in which everything arises.
Each element has a special role in the process of arising. This isn't just poetic—it's describing the mechanics of manifestation from the basis!
[156-166] 
Seventh, application of meaning—this is where Dzogchen really shows its profundity. From That Very (a tantra):
Within dharmakaya, primordially pure, by essence without change, arising earth also is. This is the key insight: the element earth isn't separate from dharmakaya. Its very unchanging essence IS the earth element.
By awareness-wisdom engaging meaning, arising fire also is. The engagement of awareness-wisdom with objects—that's fire.
By awareness-wisdom gone without movement into dimension, arising wind also is. When awareness rests without moving into the expanse, that's wind.
By awareness-wisdom gathering the three cavities as one, arising water also is. When the three centers (channels) are gathered, unified, that's water.
By wisdom dissolving into nondual empty-luminous, arising space is. The dissolution into the inseparability of emptiness and clarity—that's space.
Longchenpa is showing you: the five elements are not separate from the five wisdoms. They're the display of the five wisdoms in form. This is the completion stage view!
[167-172] 
Now the second part of applied meaning—connecting the outer five elements with inner awareness. From the Norbu Drathakod (Display of Jewels tantra):
The five outer arising are the common dharma of self-continuum. All outer-appearing elements, by connecting with self-awareness itself, are the common dharma.
This means: everything you see outside—mountains, rivers, sky—is actually appearing to your own awareness. It's not separate from your awareness. The divisions are thus: the characteristic of earth making solidity also... [continues]
Here's the pointing-out instruction hidden in this scholastic presentation: don't look at the world as separate from your mind. The solidity of earth appears in your awareness. The fluidity of water appears in your awareness. They're not "out there" separate from you—they're the display of your own rigpa!
[173-181] 
Continuing the application of meaning—connecting each element's characteristic with awareness-wisdom:
Earth's characteristic of making solidity connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth and destruction. Why? Because earth is stable, unchanging, not born and destroyed like conditioned phenomena. This is the unborn nature of dharmakaya appearing as earth's solidity.
Wind's characteristic of lifting connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction. Wind moves freely, nothing blocks it—that's the unobstructed nature of wisdom.
Fire's characteristic of burning connects with awareness-wisdom gone under the authority of afflictions. Fire consumes, burns up afflictions. This is the wisdom that has power over the kleshas.
Water's characteristic of moistening connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects. Water flows everywhere, pervades everything—that's how wisdom enters all phenomena without obstruction.
Space's characteristic of vastness connects with awareness without break in continuity. Space is never interrupted, never cut—that's the continuous nature of rigpa.
Each element is pointing to a quality of awareness. This is the profound interconnection!
[182-194] 
Eighth, the manner of liberation—from the Mutik Trengwa (Pearl Garland):
Space itself, by pervading emptiness, liberates space itself as entity. Space liberates into its own nature—pervading emptiness.
Wind, by appearing without graspable object, liberates into the function of gathering entities. Wind appears but you can't grasp it—it naturally liberates into gathering.
Fire, by consuming what ripens, liberates by moving and separating clarity from impurity. Fire burns, consumes, separates pure from impure.
Earth, when making the producer to lift, liberates into limitless empty non-entity. Earth's production function liberates into emptiness.
Water, by moistening what gathers, liberates into the function of ripening what burns. Water's moistening liberates into ripening.
This is describing how each element, when recognized in its true nature, liberates. Not by getting rid of it, but by recognizing its nature!
[195-225] 
Ninth, divisions—the 25-fold elements. This is complex but profound. Each element contains all five elements within it:
Space contains space-wind, space-fire, space-water, space-earth, and space-space.
Wind contains wind-wind, wind-space, wind-water, wind-fire, wind-earth.
Water contains water-water, water-space, water-wind, water-fire, water-earth.
Fire contains fire-earth, fire-space, fire-wind, water-fire, fire-earth.
Earth contains earth-earth, earth-space, earth-wind, earth-water, earth-fire.
Five elements, each with five sub-elements: twenty-five total. This isn't just taxonomy—it's describing how each element has the nature of all elements within it. Space has wind-like movement, fire-like consuming, water-like gathering, earth-like support. And so on for each.
This is the mandala principle: each part contains the whole. Each element is a complete mandala of all five. This interpenetration is the nature of reality!
By training in these distinctions, specific qualities are accomplished. Each combination has its own special function and quality. This is the basis of element transformation practices in the completion stage.
[226-239] 
From the Sound Thalgyur: by training in the sound-meaning of elements, common attainments are obtained. This is referring to how the elements manifest as sounds, and by understanding their meaning, you gain powers and abilities.
The particularities: training in form exhausts the body (you see through its solidity), knowing languages through sound, taking essence through smell, transforming entities into nectar through taste. These are completion stage practices!
From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: by becoming familiar with the sounds and meanings of earth, water, fire, and wind, you understand the self-sounds of the six races (types of beings), and clairvoyance arises. Each being, each realm, has its own elemental signature. Understanding this gives you insight into all realms.
These outer elements are the support and abode of all sentient beings. This completes the tenfold presentation of outer elements.
[240-258] 
Tenth: how samsara and nirvana are complete in the yogi's body and mind. This is the profound Dzogchen teaching of completeness (*tshang tshul*).
First, the general presentation: in the gathered body and mind of migrators, all primordially self-arises complete:
- Father and mother = method and wisdom
- Karma wind projecting = Dharmakaya awakening
- Five element seeds = five families' sound-potential
- Two essences of equipoise = union of method-wisdom of path's two accumulations
- Abiding in womb = abiding in base-dimension
- Body forming in seven sets of seven days = completing seven paths of seven pure elements
- Ten months in womb = completing ten grounds
- Becoming Buddha in three kayas = completing the path
- Birth = emanation-body
- Abiding engaging fields = enjoyment-body
- Death = arising of Dharma-nature empty
This is the profound teaching: your entire life—conception, gestation, birth, aging, death—mirrors the path to enlightenment. Every stage corresponds to a stage of the path!
[259-283] 
From the Mutik Trengwa, the Bhagavan speaks:
Not liberated by effort—don't try to create liberation!
Abiding liberated from primordial—you're already free!
From union of method and wisdom—father and mother are the cause.
The moving projecting wind—self-aware awakening, great bliss.
The seed from five causes—arises appearing from emptiness field.
Equipoise of bliss of the two—wisdom arisen from method.
Entering womb—self-awareness arising from base.
Seven sets of seven—measure of realization.
Ten months—traversing the grounds.
Birth—arising as kaya.
Producing body—base-appearing field.
Abiding in body—the base.
Aging—awakening confusion from delusion.
Sickness—confidence of realization.
Death—liberation into Dharma-nature empty.
All appearing sentient beings—primordially liberated without effort!
This is it! The whole path is already complete in your life. Birth, life, death—they're not obstacles; they ARE the path when recognized.
[284-297] 
Connecting with reversing delusion:
- Birth = awareness moving from dimension
- Body = the base
- Outer appearances = base-appearing spontaneous completion
- Sickness = realization meeting face-to-face
- Aging = awakening confusion from truth-clinging
- Death = final arrival at primordial purity ground
These arise primordially, so instruction introduces you to them, empowerment matures you, and meditation liberates.
If complete in partial similarity, you can't liberate through instruction alone—you need to be shown clearly that this partial similarity exists. This is Buddha's Dharma. The base-path is primordially complete. What Buddha teaches as symbols points to this essence.
[298-313] 
Second: completeness in body and mind specifically—threefold: body, mind, and awareness.
First, body: in this aggregate of four gathered elements, the outer container-world and inner essence-migrants are all complete. From the Mutik Trengwa: earth, water, fire, wind, space, sun, moon, forms of beings, planets, stars, clouds, trees, mountains, rocks, roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, smells, tastes, sounds, touches—all are present in the body!
Your body is a complete universe. Everything outside is also inside. This isn't metaphor—it's the actual structure of manifestation.
[265-283] (continuation from PAGE 5)
The verse continues explaining the completeness teaching: the moving projecting wind is self-aware awakening, great bliss. The seed from the five causes arises appearing from the field of emptiness. The equipoise of bliss is wisdom arisen from method. Entering the womb is self-awareness arising from the base.
Seven sets of seven days is the measure of realization. Ten months traverses the grounds. Birth is arising as kaya. Producing the body is base-appearing field. Abiding in body is abiding in the base. Aging is awakening confusion from delusion. Sickness is confidence of realization. Death is liberation into Dharma-nature empty.
This is the revolutionary Dzogchen view: your life IS the path. Every ordinary experience, when recognized, is an enlightened experience. You're not trying to get somewhere else—you're recognizing where you already are!
[284-297] (continuation)
The particular manner of reversing delusion: birth is awareness moving from dimension; body is the base; outer appearances are base-appearing spontaneous completion. Sickness is realization meeting face-to-face. Aging is awakening from truth-clinging confusion. Death, knowing self-face, shows arrival at primordial purity.
These arise primordially, so: instruction introduces, empowerment matures, meditation liberates. If you're already complete in partial similarity, you need the instruction to point it out clearly. This is what Buddha's Dharma does—it shows you what you already have. The base-path exists primordially in its complete measure.
[298-313] 
Now the second topic: completeness in body and mind specifically. This has three parts: body, mind, and awareness.
First, the body: this aggregate of four gathered elements contains everything. The outer container-world—the universe—and the inner essence-migrants—all beings—are complete right here in your body.
From the Mutik Trengwa (Pearl Garland): Earth, water, fire, wind, space, sun, moon, forms of males and females, planets, stars, clouds, trees, mountains, rocks, roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, smells, tastes, sounds, touches...
Longchenpa is listing everything in the universe and saying: it's all in your body. This isn't exaggeration. In the completion stage, you realize that your channels, winds, and essences correspond to cosmic structures. Your body is a mandala. The microcosm mirrors the macrocosm perfectly.
When you understand this, practices like tummo (inner fire), the various yogas of channels and winds—they're not just physical exercises. You're working with the cosmic elements concentrated in your vajra body.
[314-370] 
Longchenpa continues the detailed correspondences—everything in the universe is in your body. Music and canopies, banners and upper-canopies—all these appearing dharmas are complete in the yogi's body.
Here are the specific correspondences:
- Earth's portion: flesh (the solid substance)
- Water's portion: blood (gathering, flowing)
- Fire's portion: warmth (ripening, maturing)
- Wind's portion: breath (karmic vehicle)
- Space's portion: mind (awareness itself)
- Sun-moon: the two eyes (clarity, perception)
- Male: birth (active principle)
- Female: death (receptive dissolution)
- Planets: the gate-house of desire and two nostrils (openings)
- Stars: teeth (sparkling, distinct)
- Clouds: hair (covering, floating)
- Trees: channels (branching pathways)
- Mountains: the whole similar body (solid, upright)
- Rocks: bones (hard structure)
- Tree roots: heart (foundation)
- Trunk: legs (support)
- Branches: limbs (extensions)
- Flowers: five faculties (senses blooming)
- Fruit: happiness-suffering of body (result)
- Sound: voice (expression)
- Form: body (appearance)
- Smell: pores (openings)
- Taste: skin (surface contact)
- Touch: sickness (sensation)
- Music: internal organs (harmony)
- Canopy: urine (fluid covering)
- Parasol: legs (protection)
- Banner: name (identity)
- Upper-canopy: breath (covering atmosphere)
This isn't symbolic—it's actual structure. Your body literally IS the universe in concentrated form. The Mutik Trengwa verse confirms all this.
[371-389] 
Second: completeness in mind. All dharmas of samsara-nirvana, base and path, are completely present in mind. From the same source:
All white dharmas of transcendence are completely present in body and mind. Because samsara dharmas are empty of transcendence, they're also present. The list includes everything: mandala, deity, offering, mantra, mudra, concentration, empowerment, samaya, instruction, experience, development stage, hearing, contemplating, meditating, view, conduct, giving, ethics, patience, effort, concentration, wisdom, powers, aspiration, perfections, ten virtues, method and wisdom—all are present in body and mind.
This is the completion stage view: you don't need to go somewhere else to find these. They're already complete in your own body and mind.
[390-425] 
Third: completeness in awareness itself. This is the highest level—rigpa contains everything.
From the tantra: in whatever face of self-appearing awareness, all however-appearing dharmas are complete. This is the crucial point: it's not just that things are in your body or mind—they're in awareness itself, which is more fundamental than both.
The correspondences continue but at the awareness level:
- Sun and moon: method and wisdom
- Male: base, Female: path (the union)
- Planet: measure of realization
- Star: dharma
- Cloud: compassion pervading all
- Tree: path of expanding dharma-nature
- Mountain: view without change
- Rock: dharmakaya free from birth and destruction
- Root: one cause of all dharmas
- Branch: branch of awakening
- Trunk: one taste in emptiness
- Leaf: pervading dharmadhatu
- Flower: lamp of wisdom
- Fruit: three kayas self-complete
- Sound: sound of dharma-nature
- Smell: fame of buddha's speech
- Taste: taste of bliss of experience
- Touch: great concentration
- Music: complete mandala of five
- Canopy: potential of clear color
- Parasol: wisdom that protects
- Upper-canopy: great essential point of instruction
- Banner: buddha of manifest realization
Then the key verse: "All dharmas in the face of mind itself abide in the manner of primordial spontaneous completion. Therefore, dharmas of mind and entity are all merely imputed."
This is the ultimate Dzogchen view: everything is spontaneously complete in rigpa. Body, mind, world—all are imputed, mere labels, while awareness is the fundamental reality.
[426-444] 
Now transitioning to the second major topic: extensive explanation of inner arising. This has two parts: the common division and individual natures.
First: inner arising means the five elements of essence (subtle) rely upon the five coarse elements of the body. Wind, fire, earth, water, and space—each of the five abides as five, making twenty-five limbs (components).
The definite suitability: they're definite as five based on five different functions. From the Self-Arisen: the five great arising are complete in one's own body. Five winds make wisdom potential; five fires make wisdom potency; five earths make wisdom essence; five waters make wisdom object; five spaces make wisdom abode.
So each element has its subtle dimension that supports wisdom. This is describing the subtle body—the channels, winds, and essences that are the basis for completion stage practice.
[445-472] 
Now we enter the detailed presentation of inner arising, starting with wind (*rlung*). This has two parts: root division and branch division.
Root division—five principal winds from the Self-Arisen:
1. Life-holding wind (*srog 'dzin*)—abides in the life channel (heart area)
2. Color-and-radiance-producing wind (*bkra gzi mdangs skyed*)—abides in the chest
3. Fire-equal wind (*me mnyam*)—abides in the navel
4. All-pervading wind (*kun khyab*)—pervades the whole body
5. Karma wind without compassion (*snying rje med pa bsKal pa las*)—abides between heart and heart-membrane
Their functions in sequence:
- Life-holding: maintains life
- Color-producing: produces radiance/complexion
- Fire-equal: digests food
- All-pervading: enables going and sitting (movement)
- Karma: performs life-transference (death process)
These winds aren't just physiological—they're the subtle energy that carries consciousness and supports the meditative experiences.
[473-496] 
Second, branch division: each of the five winds subdivides into five, making 25 winds total.
First, the five life-holding winds:
1. Root-holding life
2. Protecting life
3. Spreading life
4. Impure life
5. Shattering life
Their functions:
1. Producing awareness potential
2. Producing bindhu (essence) potential
3. Producing light potential
4. Holding the root of non-awareness (ignorance)
5. Acting as helper to mind
The life wind potential relies on and abides in awareness potential. This is crucial: the vital energy and awareness are intimately connected.
Second, the five fire-equal winds:
1. Wind separating clear from impure
2. Wind producing warmth
3. Wind of clear-change (transforming clarity)
4. Wind gathering distinctions
5. Wind making praise
These support the digestive fire and transformative processes.
[497-501] 
The five fire-equal winds are nondual with:
- Life
- Awareness
- Lamp (of wisdom)
- Bindhu (essence)
- Wisdom
This nonduality is key—they're not separate things but different aspects of the same reality.
[502-512] 
Third, the five color-and-radiance-producing winds:
1. Consciousness-producing wind
2. Wind arising from mind
3. Wind possessing radiance
4. Wind of burning
5. Wind of wildness
Their objects:
- Wisdom object
- Appearing object
- Lamp object
- Non-awareness object
- Mind's object (the "horse" that carries mind)
These winds are responsible for the clarity and radiance of consciousness, producing the various cognitions and perceptions.
[513-526] 
Fourth, the five all-pervading winds:
1. Pervading the base
2. Pervading immediately
3. Pervading hatred and fear
4. Pervading memory
5. Pervading all body by holding
They appear in:
- Wisdom
- Lamp
- Knowing
- Thinking
- Mind's potency
These winds enable the spread of awareness throughout experience—cognitive, emotional, and physical.
[527-540] 
Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
1. Wind of making movement
2. Wind of making liberation
3. Wind of making reversal
4. Wind of making swiftness
5. Wind of moments
They pervade:
- Aggregates
- Moments (instantaneous time)
- Bardo
- Concepts
- Three: moments, actions, completion
These are the most subtle winds connected with karma and the process of death and transition.
[541-557] 
Thus twenty-five winds gather into five roots. The etymology from Self-Arisen:
- "Move-making wind"—because it makes movement on true ground
- "Life-holding wind"—because it holds life of pure wisdom
- "Color-radiance wind"—because it's the self-nature of five wisdom lights
- "Compassionless karma wind"—because it can liberate into wisdom's true dimension
- "Fire-equal wind"—because it abides without gathering or separating from wisdom's appearing
The essential point: in the five essence winds, relying on awareness wisdom, abiding in the heart, wisdom's self-sound-potential clears as five lights. When awareness separates from wind, wisdom dimension gathers. The non-manifest outer and inner arrives at the essential point of pure wind-mind.
This is describing the completion stage realization where wind and mind merge into wisdom.
[552-553] Now listen close—you want the heart of this in brief? Here it is. Longchenpa's pointing at what you already are, right now, reading these words. That awareness jewel of yours, it's not some treasure you dig up from the ground. It's primordially pure essence abiding in the secret cavity, in the palace of luminous self-nature. Don't go hunting for a palace somewhere else! This body of yours, this very mind—that's the palace. Essence, nature, compassion—these three aren't separate things you stack up like blocks. They're the master itself, inseparable, abiding as one. You looking for three different experiences? You'll miss the one that's staring you in the face!
[554-557] Look here—when essence abides as kaya, its own purpose isn't some object you can point at. It's not clear like "this is it." Yet it's self-clear, appearing as outer-kaya from a base that never stops, never ceases. Your nature is the base where five lights arise, where life wind moves, where four branches dance. This isn't theory, friend—this is what's happening in your chest right now, primordially abiding as the essence of speech. And compassion? It's self-arisen awareness essence, spontaneously complete. Not "becoming" complete—already complete! The wisdom of two-knowing—this is what you are, abiding without shift or change, without kaya and wisdom ever separating or gathering. Stop trying to unite what was never apart!
[558-560] What are these two knowings? Listen: depending on the inner-clear essence of dharmata—everything known. Depending on the outer-clear aspect of what's appearing—all aspects known. It's like this: you know what's inside the room, you know what's outside. But it's not two different knowers! One awareness, two ways of shining. Don't make this complicated.
[561-562] Five winds—now pay attention to your breath. Root life wind, the portion of compassion awareness wisdom—if pure, it's Buddha wisdom. If impure, it's the base of sentient beings' confused aggregates. Same wind, different recognition. The difference between buddha and sentient being isn't in the wind itself—it's in whether you recognize what it is!
[563-567] From that root, four branch winds emanate like rays from the sun—that's compassion's potency displaying. Upward-going wisdom horse, downward-clearing wisdom ray, fire-equal ripening power, all-pervading completing power. These four aren't somewhere else—they exist only in the portion of life wind itself. In the dimension of dharmadhatu, they don't emanate out. They abide only as essence, non-ceasing base of display, essence branch clear as light. See? Not going anywhere, not coming from anywhere.
[572-582] Kunsel says it like this—kaya abides like the form-reflection of an empty-luminous bubble. Speech abides like fire spark rays in the expanse of awareness. Mind's clear nature is life wind itself, like wisdom fire sparks without falling in any direction, abiding as five wisdoms. And all of this—wisdom that no concept can deceive. Not your thinking mind, friend. Wisdom itself, beyond the reach of your clever ideas!
[583] Emaho! What a wonder!
[584-589] Listen—what's being described here can't be fixed or altered. You can't grab it by the face, can't mark it with labels. Like trying to catch sky in your hands! Like trying to pin down the earth under your feet! It's clear yet subtle, like fire sparks dancing behind the five lights. This is dharmakaya, the heart essence of dharmadhatu itself. And where does it abide? As awareness itself, holding the basis of everything. Don't look for it somewhere else—it's what's reading these words right now!
[590-599] The palace where it abides—that's dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space. When dharmakaya abides in the precious cavity, it's called the pure original tone of dharmata. Awareness possessing the house of light, abiding in light's display. Longchenpa calls this the primordial common basis, the expanse of awareness—this is how the five winds connect and establish meaning. Not separate from you, friend. Never was.
[600-612] Now five fires—from the Self-Arising Tantra. Listen to this carefully:
- Fire pervading all outer and inner
- Fire illuminating all outer and inner
- Fire equalizing all outer and inner
- Fire of concept in outer and inner actions
- Fire accomplishing outer and inner actions
Where do these fires live? In your lungs, your eyes, your five limbs—that's six locations. In the gaps of your flesh, the soles of your feet, your palms. They produce warmth. Feel your hands right now—that warmth? That's it! Not philosophy, this is your own body speaking.
[613-626] Five earths now, from the same source:
- All-illuminating earth
- Unchanging vajra earth
- Precious earth from which all arise
- All-pervading earth showing appearances
- Earth of perfected accomplishment
These aren't separate things somewhere else. Together with awareness, together with lamp, together with thigle, together with wisdom, together with discriminating awareness—they abide in reliance. Everything interconnected, everything supporting everything else. Like a net of jewels reflecting each other!
[627-635] Five waters from Self-Arising:
- Unchanging water
- Peaceful, clear, pure water
- Water of extensively arising qualities
- Water without attachment
- Water of completion without grasping
These connect with all the channels. Your whole body is a mandala, friend—every part resonating with these elemental wisdoms!
Emaho! What a wonder this body of yours!
- Space pervading all in common
- Space of clear tone without object
- Pure unmixed space
- Space indicating meaning
- Space liberating into pure field
These aren't five different spaces somewhere in the clouds! They're connected with actual awareness, five lights, the lamp of pure expanse, wisdom of signs, and the twenty-one pointing-out instructions. Certain confidence in example and meaning—this is what points you to what's already here!
- Basis: the kayas
- Tone: the light
- Supported: the wisdom
- Activities: enlightened actions
See the structure? Foundation first, then what rests upon it. Don't try to understand kayas without understanding what they rest upon!
1. General presentation of three kayas' expanse
2. Particular explanation of five kayas
Three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects, though essence is one. From Self-Arising: "Three kayas, wisdom-appearance, without obstruction to anything, perceived objects being one, essence appearing individually." Not three separate things—one awareness, three ways of shining!
- Awareness without thought = dharmakaya essence
- Awareness uncensored and clear = sambhogakaya
- Awareness appearing as whatever = nirmanakaya
Complete. Awakened. Right here, right now—not somewhere else, not later!
Emaho!
