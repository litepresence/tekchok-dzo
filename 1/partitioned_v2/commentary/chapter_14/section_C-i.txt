Like snow falling on rock salt—on top of the appearance itself, self-liberation goes spontaneously, instantly. That also: arising appearance, ceasing appearance, coming and going appearance, and so forth—training in phenomena as different pieces, grasping and attachment liberated. Although appearing, empty of truth—like reflections, water-moon, sound-echo, emanations, illusions, mirages, optical illusions, like a dream horse completely pure.
Listen to this! Longchenpa gives you eight metaphors for how appearances are: like snow on rock salt, like reflections in a mirror, like the moon in water, like echoes, like magical emanations, like illusions created by a magician, like a mirage, like optical illusions, like a dream. What do all these have in common?
They appear, but they're not real! The reflection appears, but you can't drink it. The echo sounds, but has no source. The dream horse seems completely real while you're dreaming, but leaves no trace when you wake. This is how all phenomena are—they appear, vividly, but they're empty of inherent existence.
The practice is to see this directly. When appearances arise, let them self-liberate instantly, like snow falling on salt and dissolving immediately. Don't try to stop appearances. Don't try to maintain them. Just let them arise and cease naturally, seeing their empty nature.
[2347] 
Training in dharmata's unborn nature, the general form of dharmas, realizing peaceful from the primordial like space.
This is the view. All dharmas—all phenomena—are unborn. They never truly came into existence. They're peaceful from the very beginning, like space itself. Space has no center, no edge, no coming or going. In the same way, the nature of mind is unborn, peaceful, completely open.
[2348-2364] 
From the Six Vastnesses:
In the mind-itself where arising exists,
By self-dawning of six-realms' appearances,
Different forms are grasped,
Appearance matures complete as form.
In the mind-itself where ceasing exists,
By self-dawning as impermanent cause,
In appearances without nature,
Complete like a dream.
In the mind-itself where elaboration exists,
By self-dawning of various appearances,
In individual appearances of five gates,
Complete on the ground of grasping self-ground.
In the mind-itself where showing exists,
By self-dawning of sounds, words, names,
Concepts and minds self-pure,
Guru's secret instruction complete.
This is the Six Vastnesses tantra, pointing to how everything arises from mind. The six realms appear from mind. Forms appear from mind. Impermanence appears from mind. Concepts appear from mind. Everything is the self-dawning of mind's nature.
But notice: it says the appearances are grasped, that they mature complete as form, that they're like a dream, that they're complete on the ground of grasping. This is describing how the whole world appears—vividly, completely—yet it's all mind. The grasping creates the solidity, but the nature remains pure.
The guru's secret instruction is this: concepts and minds are self-pure. You don't need to purify them. You don't need to transform them. They're already pure from the beginning. Just recognize this!
Don't think these are just poetic descriptions. This is pointing to your actual experience. Right now, as you read these words, the appearance is vivid. But where is it? In your mind. And what is your mind? Unborn, peaceful, like space. This is the nature of your present experience.
Emaho! All appearances are the play of your own mind, like reflections in a mirror.
[2387-2401] 
From the Pearl Garland: Aggregates, elements, and sense-fields—liberated in family and family's lord. Thus it is said. Conditions are liberated by conditions, so I do not rely on observed dharmas. Objects are liberated in objects, so I do not rely on the two grasping and holding. Cause is liberated in cause itself, so I do not rely on the two samsara and nirvana. Dharmas are liberated in dharmas, so I do not rely on concepts and words. Mind-itself is liberated in mind, so I do not rely on indicating mind.
Listen to this! From the Pearl Garland tantra—everything self-liberates. The aggregates liberate themselves. The elements liberate themselves. The sense-fields liberate themselves. Conditions liberate themselves. Objects liberate themselves. Mind liberates itself.
What does this mean? It means you don't need to do anything! The liberation is already happening. The problem is your reliance, your grasping, your trying to fix things. Longchenpa repeats: "I do not rely." This is the key!
You don't need to rely on observed phenomena. You don't need to rely on grasping and holding. You don't need to rely on samsara or nirvana. You don't need to rely on concepts and words. You don't even need to rely on mind!
This is the ultimate freedom—complete non-reliance. Not rejection, but non-reliance. Things are as they are. Let them be. Don't try to control them, don't try to change them, don't try to rely on them for your happiness or your understanding. Just let everything self-liberate.
[2402-2416] 
From the Six Vastnesses:
In mind-itself where six-aggregates appear,
Thought-assemblies self-place pure.
In mind-itself where sounds and words appear,
Concepts and names self-place pure.
In mind-itself where coarse appearances,
Four elements' conditions self-place pure.
In mind-itself where grasping and holding appear,
Binding self-grasp pure.
In mind-itself where existence appears,
Phenomena self-place pure.
In mind-itself where non-existence appears,
Emptinesses self-place pure.
In mind-itself where existence and non-existence,
Establishing extremes self-place pure.
This is the view of the Great Perfection. Everything is self-pure in its own place. The six aggregates—self-pure. Thoughts—self-pure. Concepts—self-pure. The four elements—self-pure. Grasping and holding—self-pure. Even the idea of existence—self-pure. The idea of non-existence—self-pure. Both existence and non-existence together—self-pure.
What does "self-place pure" mean? It means each phenomenon is already pure in its own nature. You don't need to purify it. You don't need to transform it. You don't need to do anything to it. It's already pure from the beginning.
This is why the guru's instruction is so crucial. Once you receive this pointing-out instruction and recognize it, you see that everything has always been pure. The thoughts you've been trying to stop—they're pure. The emotions you've been trying to control—they're pure. The world you've been trying to understand—they're pure.
Stop trying to fix your mind! Stop trying to purify your experience! It's already pure. Just recognize this. That's all.
Emaho! Everything self-liberates in its own place!
[2447-2458] 
From that itself: By the twenty-one progressive trainings of mind-holding—first, placing on the ground; second, separating body-mind; third, seeing dharmata. At this time, possessing the body, speech, and mind piths, the yogin should settle. Mixing the moving wind-horse, throwing and gathering, if you rely skillfully on the three piths, mind's thoughts' continuum ceases. Thus spoke the meaning—to take into experience in three.
Listen! Now Longchenpa is giving you specific meditation techniques. Twenty-one progressive trainings for holding the mind. He condenses them into three main phases:
First: Settling the mind on the ground—finding stability, establishing the foundation.
Second: Separating body and mind—loosening the identification with physical form.
Third: Seeing dharmata—recognizing the nature of reality.
This is the path! You start by settling, then you separate, then you see. Don't think you can skip ahead. If you try to see dharmata before you've settled the mind, you'll just be imagining things. If you try to separate body-mind before settling, you'll just be scattered.
The three piths—body, speech, and mind—must be possessed, meaning you work with all three. The wind-horse (your energy, your prana) must be mixed with the practice, thrown out and gathered in. When you do this skillfully, thoughts naturally cease. Not by force, not by suppression, but by the natural power of the practice.
[2459-2476] 
Seven groups—first, self-mind dwelling on the ground. Second, body-mind separated from grasping attachment. Third, showing the seeing of dharmata.
First, the seven characteristics: Holding mind on white A. Suitable ground, comfortable cushion, body sitting cross-legged, meditate on white A shining at the nose-tip. When wind goes out, A also goes out. When drawing in, A also comes in—think this and mix with wind and meditate.
This is the White A practice—a classic Dzogchen technique. You visualize a white Tibetan letter A at the tip of your nose. As you breathe out, it goes out with the breath. As you breathe in, it comes in. You synchronize the visualization with your breathing. This gives the mind something to focus on while also working with the energy.
Why the nose-tip? This is the meeting point of the inner and outer. The breath comes in and out here. By placing the A here, you're working at the threshold between your inner world and the outer world.
If the body has hot disease, think that A has cold touch. If cold disease, think hot touch. Train day and night. An uncommon experience of mind free from emanating and gathering arises. All body-piths and wind-piths are equal.
This is the healing aspect! The visualization isn't just for concentration—it's also medicine. Hot disease, you visualize cooling. Cold disease, you visualize heating. The mind has power over the body when you know how to use it.
If dull, holding mind on the letter PHA—put one-pointed awareness, and saying PHAT fiercely, awareness comes thought-free, ha-de-ba, until thoughts don't arise, hold the mind, also saying PHAT day and night, taking into experience, mind emptiness-clear self-resonance meditation arises.
When you're dull, sleepy, scattered—use PHAT! This is fierce. PHAT is a wrathful mantra syllable. You say it sharply, fiercely. It cuts through the dullness like a sword. The awareness becomes sharp, clear, thought-free. This is the nature of mind itself—emptiness and clarity together.
Also, holding mind on the wrathful one's pleasure laugh. Saying HA fiercely and short, placing mind as before, thought-free clear resonance experience arises.
The wrathful deities' laughter—HA! Short, fierce, cutting through everything. This is another technique for when you need sharpness, clarity, intensity.
Holding mind on asuras' quarrel and dispute—sitting on mountain-peaks or rock-tops, etc.
This is about taking the challenging energy of conflict and using it as the path. Asuras are always fighting—this represents our own aggressive, competitive mind. Instead of suppressing it, you take it to a high place (mountain peak) and use that energy.
Emaho! These are the skillful means—twenty-one ways to work with the mind!
[Line range] Listen to this! The teachings here are not for scholars debating in comfort—they're for practitioners facing death.
When confusion arises, don't push it away. When clarity comes, don't grasp it. Both are your own mind's display, like waves on the ocean—appearing and disappearing, never separate from the water itself.
You think you need to purify your mind? That's like trying to wash water! The nature of mind has never been stained, never been pure. It simply IS.
Stop looking for buddhahood somewhere else. It's not in the next retreat, not after more years of practice. It's here—naked, obvious, completely free.
Don't believe me. Look for yourself!
Emaho! Mind and liberation are inseparable!

[2573-2577] Listen, friend! Who meditates union-bliss—by this, makes sense-objects the path. Who makes intermediate-space the path—by this, obtains power over mind. Thus it is. Don't reject appearances—transform them into the path of bliss!
[2578-2598] Furthermore, as auxiliary to these, the method of holding mind upon five objects of appearance—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. From the Thalgyur: eye, form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Train upon the ground of five sense-objects!
Forms—face-shapes and forms, arts and illusions, different types, and eye-magic etc.—various appearances. Sounds—lute, vase-drum, stringed instruments, clay-drum, flute, and pheng, har, etc. Smells—fragrance joined, and do through pleasing dependent-arising profound. Tastes—molasses with six, and grape-wine mixtures—variously transformed, dependent-arising branches joined.
Touch—the skilled one sits upon throne, scriptures mixed, joined elements, and by means of some tree leaves, by touch alone upon dharmata, dwells with non-separated mind. Thus it is.
[2599-2628] Especially, the stages of making four elements yoga. From that is spoken: training stage of three kayas itself, making qualities of elements chief, and supreme—earth, water, fire, wind. Trained upon sounds—certainly accomplished.
Upon explanation of water's sound, holds dakini's sound-melody. If always familiarized with this, certainly accomplishes emanation-body. Earth's sound—cool and heavy, possesses Great Brahma's sound-voice. If always hearing-training upon this, certainly accomplishes enjoyment-body. Fire's sound—self-made, trained, shows Vishnu-great's speech-melody. Who practices hearing upon this, certainly obtains dharma-body's qualities. Wind's sound—cutting, resounding, Garuda king's practice-speech. If knowing this always reciting, common training of three kayas.
Thus, sound-meaning of four elements, certainly apply to outer times. Winter, spring, summer, autumn—water, earth, fire, wind—apply certainly to sequence of times, and if made suited to yoga body, accomplishment—without doubt in this. Thus it is.
Emaho! Four elements yoga! Everything is the path when you know how to use it!
[2629-2637] 
Now listen! Gods and humans have their meditation practices too. What's their method? They hold the mouth and nose breath, make mind thought-free and unmoved—this is one-pointed awareness essence. No instantaneous thoughts, they say.
But does this show the great true meaning? No! It cannot indicate it. Stop right there! Don't think "thought-free" is the goal. It's just the beginning, not the end.
[2638-2671] 
Second, the bodhisattvas' meditation—two types: actual divisions and auxiliary arisen. First, briefly taught: from Rangshar—bodhisattvas' meditation is held by mind, arises by manner or force. Familiarized, becomes expanse, abandons food-concept. Ground-dwellers practice it. Thought-free by manner.
But this also cannot indicate the great meaning! Why? Because the nature's meaning is rigpa clear-light—not merely thought-free dwelling. Therefore cannot indicate great meaning.
Extensively explained—three types: Nature-force meditation arises spontaneously, non-thought manner, just placing body-speech relaxed. Focused-support meditation meditates antidote of view—nature without afflictions subtle-coarse, just suppressing afflictions' heads. Ground-dwellers' meditation—ground's actual concentration, only purifying self-ground latencies.
From Sun-Moon Union: Great Vehicle's meditation—by nature-force, unfabricated body-speech relaxed. By focused-support, suppress instantaneous afflictions' heads. By ground-dwellers', sustains self-self continuum.
Do you see? All these are methods, not recognition!
[2672-2685] 
Second: showing arisen-from-arising meditation—two: nature and fabricated. First, nature meditation—sentient beings all, when awareness distracted, arises from slightly trembling abiding, exists upon archer's eye, upon sleeping eye within rabbit and eagle, etc. Briefly: exists always when mind-consciousness is distracted.
Second is fabricated meditation: meditation, concentration, non-thought, thought-with deity generation-completion—all fabricated deliberately by mind, because deliberately done by intellect.
Emaho! Don't mistake these for Dzogchen, friend! Gods, humans, and bodhisattvas—their meditations are steps on the path, not the final recognition!
[Line range] Listen to this! The teachings here are not for scholars debating in comfort—they're for practitioners facing death.

[2718–2730]
Listen here, you who want to live forever! Longchenpa now teaches essence extraction practices - and you might think these are some secret alchemical formula! But the master is about to destroy your ideas about immortal!
First, "relying on jewels, lifespan equals sun and moon" - this isn't about wearing precious stones for magic! It's about recognizing that your own essence is as precious as Buddha-nature. When you rely on that recognition, your life becomes as stable as the cosmic order of sun and moon!
"Various stones' yoga—by weapons body pierced not!" This is profound! Some practitioners think they need special ritual objects, sacred implements. But Longchenpa says no - "by weapons body pierced not!" True yoga with stones is recognizing they're already expressions of your own wisdom!
[2731–2745]
Now the plant medicines: "Relying on plants—white hair and wrinkles not become!" Do you understand? When you recognize plants as expressions of rigpa, you don't need to consume them to gain their essence! "White hair" (wrinkles) disappearing - your own aging process stops when you see plants as wisdom-display!
"Juices and essences' extraction—radiant and youthful become!" Not because of chemical properties, but because recognizing plant essences as wisdom nectar naturally rejuvenates your recognition!
"Relying on meat—body healthy and strength increased!" Longchenpa isn't promoting vegetarianism! He's saying if you do eat meat, recognize it as wisdom-display and your body becomes healthy. If you don't eat meat, recognize plants as wisdom-display and your body becomes healthy. The issue isn't what you consume - it's whether you recognize what you consume as wisdom!
[2746–2754]
Now the wind practice - most profound! "Also relying on wind—wonderful great extraction explained!" The winds aren't something you control - they're the natural movement of your own energy! When you recognize winds as non-dual expressions of rigpa, you extract their essence naturally.
"Element continuity cut called: above and below winds known, wise ones wind's place hide, or wind's movement calculate, food yogin become!" This isn't complex astrology - it's recognizing how the five elements naturally express as the five wisdom winds!
Emaho! Essence extraction isn't about extending life - it's recognizing the eternal nature already present in all things!
[Line range] Listen to this! The teachings here are not for scholars debating in comfort—they're for practitioners facing death.
When confusion arises, don't push it away. When clarity comes, don't grasp it. Both are your own mind's display, like waves on the ocean—appearing and disappearing, never separate from the water itself.
You think you need to purify your mind? That's like trying to wash water! The nature of mind has never been stained, never been pure. It simply IS.
Stop looking for buddhahood somewhere else. It's not in the next retreat, not after more years of practice. It's here—naked, obvious, completely free.
Don't believe me. Look for yourself!
Emaho! Mind and liberation are inseparable!
[2792-2798] 
Listen! Now Longchenpa gives you the method—how to actually work with the winds and elements so that you recognize when death comes. This isn't theory; this is what you DO.
"Because the precipice of the six realms is equal." Understand this—all six migrations, all possible destinies, they're right there in your own body. The difference between enlightenment and hell is how you work with what's given.
"Pierce all points of body, speech, and mind." This means go deep—find the crucial points (*gnad*) where body, speech, and mind connect. "Mix mind-itself with dharmata." Let your naked awareness mix with the nature of reality itself—not as two things meeting, but as water mixing with water.
"Draw wind and awareness upward." This is the practice—when death comes, the winds drop. But if you've trained, you draw them up, you direct awareness. "Because deluded appearance is exhausted, always familiarize with wind."
Emaho! This is the key instruction!
[2799-2819] 
Now the methods for victory over obstacles—nectar and equal-taste of elements. Two crucial points here:
First, nectar (*bdud rtsi*). This isn't ordinary food. "Smeared reverse with food and beer, eaten, separate from bad smell." The alchemical reversal—what was impure becomes pure through transformation. Do oil—use essence boiled in pot. This is *chulen* practice, essence extraction.
From this: body's arising continuum is cut. Wonder! Great essence extraction explained. "Always reversing feces"—yes, you read that right. Finally the body's outflows cease. By essence-extracted oil, with marks shown, elements' continuums cease.
Feel what this means: when the body's elements' continuum is cut, sentient beings don't dwell in body. Without excrement, urine, etc. Without outer-inner wind. This time is the great yogi!
Food and clothes both become pure. Upon this lifespan and enjoyment—certainly accomplish as wished. This isn't deprivation; this is freedom from needing anything.
[2820-2836] 
Equal-taste of elements (*'byung ba ro snyoms*)—holding the four winds of earth, water, fire, and wind. Through extensive practice of channel-wind-essence in the four wheels' mandala, body essence-extraction pure, before as. From this accomplish lifespan, enjoyment, food, clothes.
The practice: hide wind mixed with body. By each self-body's elements, transform, use that itself. Meditate point-gathered mandala. By that familiarized, measure complete. From four powers equal, use blissfully, free from fear.
This also accomplishes food and clothes two, lifespan and enjoyment complete. At this time, inner vessel letter recite drive—or whatever method suits your capacity.
The point? These practices aren't ends in themselves. They're preparations so that when the bardo comes, you're ready. You've already tasted what it's like when the elements dissolve into equal taste. You recognize it. That's liberation!
[Line range] Listen to this! The teachings here are not for scholars debating in comfort—they're for practitioners facing death.
When confusion arises, don't push it away. When clarity comes, don't grasp it. Both are your own mind's display, like waves on the ocean—appearing and disappearing, never separate from the water itself.
You think you need to purify your mind? That's like trying to wash water! The nature of mind has never been stained, never been pure. It simply IS.
Stop looking for buddhahood somewhere else. It's not in the next retreat, not after more years of practice. It's here—naked, obvious, completely free.
Don't believe me. Look for yourself!
Emaho! Mind and liberation are inseparable!
[Line range] Wake up, friend! You're sleeping through the most precious teachings.
The Great Perfection isn't something you learn—it's something you recognize. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life and suddenly seeing them clearly. The recognition takes no time, but you might have spent years not noticing.
Your mind right now, as you read this, is complete and perfect. Not after you understand better. Not after you meditate more. Right now.
All your seeking, all your practices—they're like looking for your head with a lamp. You can't find it because it's never been lost!
Stop searching and see what's already here.
Emaho! Recognition is instant liberation!
[2956–2970]
Listen here, you who think Dzogchen needs special locations! Longchenpa tells about "wish-transfer" - and you might misunderstand completely!
First, understand what "Districts and forests etc., existing made non-existing, non-existing made existing!" This isn't about creating something from nothing! It's about recognizing that existence and non-existence are projections of mind. When you see this clearly, you don't need to search for pure lands - every place is already sacred!
"Other places existing here attracted—transfer!" Don't you see the trap? You think "If I could just go to that sacred mountain, I would be more realized!" But Longchenpa is about to destroy this geographical thinking: "Here existing other places projected—transfer!"
[2971–2983]
Now the profound example: "Mounts and girls etc., wind sky drawn, own place transferred!" Longchenpa recalls how Padmasambhava didn't need to travel to find sacred places - he drew them through realization! "Like great master Padma transferred Mangyul's mountains, Samye's Neutang and forests transferred, remaining until today!"
Do you understand? The master is saying: When you recognize mind's nature, you don't need external sacred places! Your own mind becomes the sacred mountain, the pure forest, the hidden valley. "Wind sky drawn" - through realization, you can transfer anywhere!
"This is yogin's wish-accomplishing supreme!" Not through traveling to holy sites, but through recognizing that everywhere is already holy!
[2984-2995] 
Now from Spontaneous Liberation: "Wish-transfer yogin fortunate, awareness-possessing mind gathered, form-appearance life-possessing, inner concordant action changes, own sickness etc. other transferred! Thus transferred, entities liberated!" Listen carefully! This isn't about magical powers to affect others! It's about how your recognition naturally affects your environment and relationships.
"Others reliance-connection method do, four elements solid things from, entities becoming reliance-connection, numbers and signs and words, visualization transformed, sickness etc. transferred!" These are the natural capacities that arise when someone recognizes their own nature - they don't need special techniques!
Emaho! Your own place is already sacred - you just need to recognize it!
[Line range] Wake up, friend! You're sleeping through the most precious teachings.
The Great Perfection isn't something you learn—it's something you recognize. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life and suddenly seeing them clearly. The recognition takes no time, but you might have spent years not noticing.
