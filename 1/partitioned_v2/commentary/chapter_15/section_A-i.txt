[Line range] Don't miss this teaching, friend! It's pointing directly to your own nature.
The Great Perfection reveals that samsara and nirvana are not two different places. They're like two ways of seeing the same thing—like seeing a rope as a snake in dim light. The rope never was a snake; you just didn't see clearly.
Your confusion and your wisdom come from the same source. They're not enemies—just different manifestations of your own mind's power.
Recognition happens in an instant. Like turning on a light in a dark room. The darkness didn't go anywhere; light just revealed what was always there.
Emaho! Clear light dawns!

[4132-4137] Listen! From Spontaneous Liberation: "Training stages of three kayas, relying on elements' qualities, supreme earth water fire wind sounds, trained certainly accomplished!" Thus four sounds yoga training stages spoken.
[4138-4143] Second, from that itself: "Samsara nirvana border not divided, three realms body speech mind also, connection cut not becoming, samsara nirvana border division explained!"
[4144-4146] From Instructions: "Thus also secret meaning itself, entering desiring excellent fortune!"
Do you see? Train in the four sounds! Earth, water, fire, wind—all are the three kayas! Samsara and nirvana not divided! Enter the secret meaning!
Emaho! Training in the four elements as three kayas!
[4184-4192] Listen! From Great Arrangement Chapter Thirty-Two: "Whoever desires to divide the border—body's action self-reverse outward, now wherever engaged, afterward not thus. That itself reverse, body also not abiding, three realms body also not entering!"
[4193-4198] Also at first body formation time, speech and mind two relying on that form. First body conduct must be done! Body conduct done, afterward body karma depleted, doing un-enthusiastic, body sins purified purpose exists! From Wheel Arrangement: "Who divided body's border, this samsara's latency exhausted!"
Do you see? Body's border must be divided! Reverse the body's actions! Exhaust samsara's latency!
Emaho! Dividing the body's border!
[4235-4240] Listen! Voice good-bad difference explained. Briefly, six beings' voices. Mind's mindfulness speech expresses. Here purpose two types: supreme and common divisions.
[4241-4249] Thus relying on speech's various expressed, three realms samsara continuity ceases. From Supreme Empowerment Tantra: "Fortune possessing, six families' voices, each suitable expressing, six beings' wheel ceases!" As above explained, moment's effort engaged. Great effort, that itself attachment reverse. Ordinary, that itself and appearance all equal, carefree recognition arises.
Do you see? Six beings' voices! Express suitably! Wheel ceases! Recognition arises!
Emaho! Six voices ceasing the wheel!
[4289-4293] Listen! From Vajra Stacked Palace: "Whoever's conceptualized wheel itself, who can turn it? Afterward that one's mind-stream ceases!"
[4294-4303] Then without projection-gathering, natural settling mindfulness' aperture self-ceases! From Glorious Sky Light: "Perception cut, aperture ceases!" Also body speech two without attachment, mind's root cut conduct appropriate. Self-traceless training, liberated from three realms! From Wheel Stacked: "Who divided mind's border, this not turning into mind!"
[4304-4308] Thus dividing border conduct three makes not entering three realms! From Near Empowerment: "Whichever border divided, not turning in three realms, to that natural settling shown!"
Do you see? Divide the border! Mind-stream ceases! Not entering three realms!
Emaho! Dividing the wheel's border!
[4335-4338] Listen! Natural settling ritual also: "This time body speech mind's key point, yogi possessing natural settling do!"
[4339-4345] These purposes two: Common purpose—body speech mind three's obstacles pacified, sins obscurations purified. Supreme purpose—body speech mind three liberated. From that itself: "This purpose two types, supreme common divisions shown!"
[4346-4354] Meaning two: Actual basis uncontaminated wisdom continuum shown method two. Actual basis word explanation and meaning flow distinction. First, word extreme decided and meaning foremost settling two. First, actual basis four extremes basis, actual not, like seeing palace not seeing king—some Great Perfection, basis approached, body cannot take in hand, dharmadhatu vast, dying time ordinary death.
Do you see? Natural settling! Two purposes! Know the distinction!
Emaho! Natural settling of body speech mind!
[4366-4375] 
Listen here, you who think wisdom is something you can find! Longchenpa destroys your worldly concept with just one phrase: "Later also meeting this difficult, world behind throwing away!"
What does this mean? The master is saying: When you encounter difficulties in Dzogchen practice, the tendency is to look for some exotic solution, some profound technique from another tradition! But Longchenpa laughs at this - "world behind throwing away" means abandoning ordinary conceptual frameworks entirely!
Don't you see? When practice becomes difficult, your mind immediately starts planning: "Maybe I need a different empowerment, maybe I need special mantra, maybe I need secret technique from ancient text." This is exactly what Longchenpa calls "throwing away the world" - abandoning this very world for some other world!
[4376-4385] 
Now the crucial teaching: "Rigpa natural settling actually introduced, vajra hanging-cord's vision seeing called!" What is "natural settling"? It's when awareness simply rests in its own nature, without any effort to maintain or improve it. Like water settling when you stop stirring - clarity happens by itself!
The "vajra hanging-cord" vision - this is profound! When awareness naturally settles, it sees through subtle channels directly. Not some visualization you create, not some technique you practice - it's the natural capacity of rigpa when not disturbed by conceptual mind.
"Also actually cannot be shown, rigpa said common ones expressed but foremost not arrived" - Oh, how this shatters your spiritual materialism! You think realization is something special that only advanced practitioners attain? Longchenpa says NO - rigpa has been expressed to everyone, but "foremost" (most realized) haven't recognized it because they're looking for something else!
"Like Vajra Seat not seeing telling its history, like blind color explaining to others" - This is devastatingly precise! A blind person trying to explain colors reveals their complete misunderstanding. But isn't this exactly what you do when you talk about enlightenment without having recognized it yourself?
[4386-4392] 
Listen to this about thoughts! "Sometimes unborn empty rigpa thought, sometimes various dawns thought" - Longchenpa is describing how conceptual mind continues even after recognition! It creates "unborn empty" thoughts and "various dawns" experiences - all still conceptual overlay.
"These two word instruction nicely explained essence empty sky-like, dawning manner not ceasing, like mirror's reflection explained, but now existing-existing!" - The danger here is subtle: You might think "sky-like" means some experience, "mirror reflection" means some realization. Longchenpa says these are just explanations - but awareness itself "now existing" is beyond all concepts!
Do you understand? Natural settling isn't an achievement - it's the cessation of seeking. Vajra vision isn't a technique - it's the natural clarity when seeking stops. Rigpa isn't something to be expressed - it's what's already present, unrecognized!
Emaho! Stop explaining Dzogchen and just let awareness settle!
[4393-4408] Listen! Thigle relying liberation signs: thigle subtle coil possessing! Rigpa channel key point relying liberation signs: hanging-cord subtle crooked connection possessing! These three rigpa actual not, but relying on that virtue force key point liberates! Rigpa seeing not enough, habituation needed signs: hanging-cord one to one connection possessing! Also direct that wisdom's vision pure eye seeing, seeing time that liberation born, like hero's heart struck by arrow! Dharmata vision pure eye seeing, first moment that distinction divided, second that itself realized liberated!
[4409-4412] These eyes also: Spontaneous presence ground dwell great mudra, life power humans sequential, wisdom dharmata prajna!
Do you see? Different eyes see different levels! Pure eye, wisdom eye, vajra eye—all leading to liberation!
Emaho! Eyes of liberation!
[4426-4432] Listen! Second, on three key points relying, direct natural settling not placed, view words outside scattered, key point three relying direct natural settling! Third, thus placed and practiced, four visions how dawning sequence! Fourth, these helpers or supports four, key point not habituated, habituation measure not reached, ultimate support oral instruction and dharma topics four spoken!
[4429-4432] From Glorious Mountain Stacked Tantra: "Direct key point desiring habituation, key point four sections divided!"
[4433-4443] Four dharma topics path completion certainty: outer four elements with stone exhausted, inner four times' increase-decrease exhausted, secret sun-moon four changes exhausted, unsurpassed body speech mind four basis emptied—thus four certain! Also outer four empowerments shown, inner four wheels channels ripen, secret four wisdoms actually clear, unsurpassed four lamps' increase shown—four dharma topics spoken! More than that talk useless, less root not desired meaning's result not ripen!
Do you see? Four sections! Four topics! Complete the path!
Emaho! Four key points completing the path!
[4462-4466] Listen! From Jewel Garland: "Body's key point three types: lion's manner and elephant manner, sage like abiding!"
[4467-4475] Here three kayas also reversal different, one body also postures different three: First, emanation body posture: like sage crouching, foot soles two pressed—method and prajna connection arising key point! Soles two earth pressed—grasping-holding action wind two pressed key point! Knees navel joined—body's elements compressed key point! Body straight stretched—channels not contracted, wind naturally slow key point! Hands crossed—dharmadhatu and rigpa mixed key point! Chin horizontally stretched—wind field sent, self-luminosity key point!
[4476-4481] From Spontaneous Liberation: "Emanation body posture: relying on sage crouching, dharmata appearance self-emanated, dharma eye sees!"
Do you see? Posture is practice! Lion, elephant, sage—each posture liberates!
Emaho! Three postures of the three kayas!
[4501–4510]
Listen here, you who want to understand the three bodies! Longchenpa now explains how each kaya has its own posture, its own way of abiding. Don't think these are just yoga positions you need to memorize! These are direct pointers to how awareness itself abides in different modes.
Look at the Sambhogakaya posture first. "Relying on elephant lying down" - what does this mean? The elephant represents power and stability, but lying down shows complete relaxation. When you rest in the nature of mind, not trying to achieve anything, all phenomena become "enjoyments" - pure displays of wisdom. The lotus eye sees everything directly because there's no effort involved. When desire objects are purified, you're not getting rid of them - you're seeing they were never real to begin with!
[4511–4525]
Now the Dharmakaya posture - listen carefully! "Golden bird" is the preciousness that flies above all concepts. When awareness abides as dharmakaya, it transcends the three realms automatically. The "lion's den" isn't a cave you find in Tibet - it's the fearless abiding where nothing can disturb rigpa. When Longchenpa says "press two foot soles to earth," he's telling you to be grounded in reality itself! Balance the elements - don't favor one over another. Feel the heat of primordial wisdom, not just your body heat!
And here's the secret: the winds! Primordial wisdom wind flows naturally when you stop trying to direct it. Karma wind - the winds of dualistic thinking - suppress themselves when you rest in non-duality. This isn't something you do - it's what happens when you stop doing!
[4526–4540]
Now understand what makes these postures work. The posture isn't physical - it's how awareness holds itself. When your hand "bends finger to earth," you're not doing mudra - you're recognizing that form and emptiness are inseparable. When you "suppress karma wind," you're not fighting thoughts - you're seeing they have no substance.
The lion posture represents fearlessness. When awareness abides as lion, there's no place for delusion to hide. The golden bird represents the spontaneous arising of wisdom - it doesn't need to flap its wings to fly.
All these postures point to one thing: stop trying to posture your mind! Let awareness rest in its natural state, and the three kayas will manifest naturally.
Do you see? Don't imitate the form - understand the meaning!
Emaho! Your own nature has been posturing perfectly all along!
[4541–4565]
Listen, yogin! Who dharmakaya abiding manner, who person body's pith, that accord who knows, this dharmakaya great bliss, yogin good make! Thus three kayas' postures made, three kayas' intent not passed!
Also nirmanakaya cross-legged is future time, austerity relying liberation sign! Sambhogakaya elephant is future time, deed-free spontaneous mode liberation sign! Dharmakaya lion is future time, correct confidence-free liberation sign!
Element body's posture manner, three kayas' posture become—what? Three kayas' light-clear self existing, heart abiding, posture made, self thus existing intent three manifest! Three kayas' self-possession existing, self's posture three kayas' posture become!
Emaho! Three postures, three liberations!
Body elements cold-heat, element body matched, cold-heat equalized! Three kayas' light body, three realms transcended!
Emaho! Body's elements become three kayas!
[4566–4575]
Listen here, you who wander in samsara! Longchenpa reveals something crucial: the three poisons and three realms are not separate things - they're the same energy appearing differently! When you're driven by desire, you take birth as a bird in the desire realm. When aversion rules your mind, you manifest as a snake in the hell realms. When ignorance clouds your awareness, you become a pig in the animal realm.
Don't think these are literal reincarnations! This is happening right now, in this very moment. When desire dominates your mind, you're creating the desire realm through your own attachments. The "bird form" isn't something you become after death - it's how your experience shapes itself when desire is chief!
Look at the details: "action and doer, speech chief" - when desire runs the show, everything becomes about doing and having. "Body ripening time, speech delight" - your physical existence matures through enjoyment, your speech revels in expressing what you want. This is the first samsaric wheel - the pattern of wanting and grasping.
[4576–4590]
Now the poison of aversion - the snake realm! "Latency producing, mind chief form" - anger comes from latent tendencies, but it takes over as the ruler of your mind. "Ripening time, mind changes many" - when aversion dominates, your mental state becomes unstable, jumping from one irritation to another. "Intellect change conceptuality great" - oh, how aversion loves to analyze and judge! It creates elaborate theories about why everyone else is wrong.
"Speech not-delight, sleep delight comes" - anger doesn't enjoy expressing itself positively. It finds pleasure in withdrawal, in dullness, in the stubborn refusal to engage. This is the hell realm - the contraction of awareness!
[4591–4596]
And ignorance - the pig form! "Moving-desire, body strength great, body coarse" - ignorance is characterized by crude, unrefined grasping. "Grooming delight" - the pig finds pleasure in wallowing in filth. Isn't this exactly how ignorance behaves? It delights in remaining stuck, in not knowing, in the comfortable mire of concepts.
But here's the master's teaching: each poison has its liberation posture! When you're caught in desire, the Sambhogakaya posture - the enjoyment body - shows you how all desires are pure displays of wisdom. When aversion burns, the Dharmakaya posture - the abiding nature - reveals that anger has never moved from emptiness. When ignorance wallows, the Nirmanakaya posture - the activity body - demonstrates how even pig-like delusion can express buddha-nature!
Emaho! The three poisons are the three kayas in disguise!
[4597–4610]
Listen here, you who talk too much! Longchenpa now teaches about speech - and you might not like what he has to say! The Great Perfection isn't about fancy prayers or elaborate mantras. It's about cutting through the very habit of talking!
First, speech training: "speaking less, ordinary speech cutting" - this means stop your ordinary chatter! Not just减少 quantity but cutting the very tendency to explain everything, to justify yourself, to fill silence with words. Short sessions train, then long train - this isn't about duration but about depth. Ten minutes of mindful silence beats hours of distracted chatter.
"Occasionally speech cause none, alone speak!" - this is profound! When you truly have something to say, speak. When not, remain silent. But silence isn't emptiness - it's pregnant with meaning. Alone doesn't mean lonely - it means resting in non-duality!
[4611–4625]
Now abiding - listen carefully! "Mantra and utterance etc., virtuous utterance not-deny" - Longchenpa isn't telling you to reject mantras! He's saying don't get stuck in them. When you abide in nature of mind, all virtuous utterances arise naturally. "Other word syllable not-mix" - this means don't corrupt your natural expression with forced techniques.
"This time body sign meaning understand!" - The body will show signs when your speech aligns with truth. Not dramatic miracles, but subtle shifts: lightness, clarity, effortless flow. When your speech comes from silence rather than from thinking, the body responds!
[4626–4631]
And swallowing - the crucial point! "Mantra etc. utterance all not-do" - This is the secret: when you recognize mind's nature, you don't need to do anything with mantra or speech! The mantra completes itself. "Firm: what not-utter, state not-transgressing" - When you rest in this non-doing, you naturally maintain samaya without effort.
"Body purified buddhas and bodhisattvas, sky-goers dakinis blessing" - When speech ceases into natural silence, the body becomes a pure vessel for wisdom. Buddhas recognize this purity, bodhisattvas admire it, dakinis are drawn to it!
Emaho! The Great Perfection's speech seals are not about saying more - they're about recognizing when silence says everything!
[4632–4681]
Listen, yogin! Thus body speech three bound, dharmadhatu vision in, this habituation becoming! Body and speech and mind main-point, know and rely, samsara liberate!
Second meaning: main-point three relying, direct self-point deliver three. Main-point three vajra seal bind, direct awareness self-face introduce, that-from vision dawning manner show! First two: main-point three general seal show, particular self main-point point deliver!
First: gate and field and wind-awareness main-point three. From Spontaneous Liberation: main-point three instruction separate not-do! Gate and field itself, wind and awareness main-point itself seal! Example: main-point hit weapon similar, body channels or meaning-heart main-point hit, dying similar not-feel!
Gate main-point threshold similar, field main-point escort similar, wind-awareness main-point bandit similar!
Emaho! Three main points vajra-sealed!
[4673–4719]
Listen here, practitioner! Seeing transmission lineage distinguished: from Self-Arisen Rigpa Tantra: "Thus body etc. all, main-point all greatly pressed, awareness itself and direct, guru's transmission from knowing!"
From Spontaneous Liberation: "Actual own tantra rely, body's main-point and speech and, mind's main-point rely, wind how relaxed, greatly throwing arise! Body and mind's connection cut, three realms also reverse not!"
[4720–4734]
Blessing wisdom actually see, this very thig-decided! Sambhogakaya wisdom eye existing, body blessing self-clear see, knowledge expand! Nirmanakaya prajna eye existing, heart blessing word-letter free see!
Emaho! Three eyes of the three kayas!
These are the pith instructions of the lineage! Practice them well!
Emaho!
[4720–4748]
Listen, yogin! Blessing wisdom actually see, this thig-decided! Sambhogakaya wisdom eye existing, body blessing self-clear see—knowledge expands! Nirmanakaya prajna eye existing, heart blessing word-letter free see!
Three gaze manner: laziness sambhogakaya, diligence nirmanakaya, equanimity dharmakaya gaze—auspicious, three determined! Definition: seeing dharmata, seeing dharmata pure obscurations exhausted! Posture samsara liberate!
[4749–4789]
Second, field main-point: outer dharmadhatu field sky empty cloud-free! Empty sky awareness empty place, field sky accord experience empty-clear, free from elaboration—wonderful appears! Entity characteristics-free purpose!
From Mind School, Condensed, Middle Mother: prajna paramita meditation, sky yoga!
Emaho! Field of dharmadhatu sky!
These are the pith instructions of the lineage! Practice them well!
Emaho!
