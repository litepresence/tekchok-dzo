[5060–5079]
Listen here, you who think meditation produces bliss! Longchenpa distinguishes between natural meditation and artificial meditation - and the distinction is life-changing!
"Direct perception's benefit: without this, even excellent qualities of view and meditation become bondage." Do you understand? When you lack direct perception, even good qualities become obstacles! You might have excellent concentration, brilliant understanding, but without directly seeing the nature of mind, these become chains binding you to subtle realms!
"The faults of not having direct perception are shown." What are these faults? Believing meditation achievement is progress, thinking view clarity comes from analysis, trusting philosophical understanding over direct recognition!
[5080–5095]
Now the crucial comparison: "But with it, gone and liberated—like the difference between rope and snake in dim light!" This is devastatingly precise! A rope can't free itself - it's still bound by its own nature. But a snake, though it moves in dimness, is naturally free!
"With direct perception, gone and liberated" - this is natural freedom. Awareness sees its own nature and recognizes there's nothing to be freed from!
"Without it, even excellent qualities become bondage" - The spiritual paradox! Excellent qualities without direct perception bind you more tightly than obvious flaws!
[5096–5111]
Now, transcendent knowledge-experience" - this isn't something you develop gradually! It's natural recognition that bypasses conceptual stages. Three experiences arise naturally when direct perception stabilizes: bliss, transformative, vision.
"First: binding body-speech main points, wind-mind relaxed, abiding in inner samadhi luminous-clear emptiness." These aren't techniques to master - they're the natural expression of awareness settling!
"Awareness vast, grasping-free bliss wide, anger-desire arisen without attachment grasping—this is natural meditation arrived at main point!" Listen carefully! The bliss isn't something you cultivate - it's what naturally arises when grasping ceases!
[5112–5135]
"Artificial meditation's bliss comes from changeable, coarse agitation or desire to sing-dance, becoming attachment." Oh, how Longchenpa exposes your spiritual materialism! You manufacture bliss through techniques, through agitation, through artistic expression - and it becomes attachment!
"But this bliss, though arisen as bliss, has the difference of awareness free from attachment obtaining freedom—know this as the difference between artificial meditation and natural wind-arrived meditation!" The crucial distinction: Artificial bliss binds you, natural awareness frees you!
Emaho! Stop cultivating and start recognizing what's already naturally present!
[5112–5130]
Listen here, you who try to measure your spiritual progress! Longchenpa explains why this is impossible - and you'll be relieved!
"Knowledge-experience is intellect, changing, measure not possible—conceived conventional aspects, memory-making, different, near-side conceptuality gathered." Do you understand? Ordinary knowledge builds concepts, stores memories, creates categories. But Longchenpa says "measure not possible" - like trying to measure clouds with a ruler!
"If you measure this, like a bird hiding in clouds—you cannot!" How perfect! The bird is awareness itself, and clouds are concepts trying to contain it. You can't measure the sky!
"No time for realizing meaning; seeing does not directly arrive." When you stop intellectualizing and just look directly, meaning arrives immediately - not through some gradual process!
[5131–5146]
"This is vision experience—seeing five wisdoms' color vision, transcending samsara's karmic end, grasped as object." These aren't achievements to collect! They're natural displays of awareness recognizing its own wisdom-nature!
"Seeing dhatu's vision, above that grasping conceptuality's portion missing, empty severed, grasping wrong, transcending samsara's three-fourths." Listen carefully! The vision isn't something you attain - it's awareness recognizing the natural purity of phenomena!
"Conceptuality's base-heap self-purified, grasping portion's half appearance self-characterized grasping wrong—this is called person and dharmas selflessness realization!" When conceptual thinking completely self-purifies, what remains is direct recognition without any grasping at all!
[5147–5170]
"In short, vision experiences are five wisdoms' color vision and dhatu vision gathered as two." The five wisdom colors aren't separate attainments - they're how rigpa naturally displays itself! Blue like space, yellow like earth, red like fire, white like water, green like wind - not elements to master but natural expressions of wisdom!
"First: joined with liberation manner from samsara's bondage—vision also upward-standing, rising side, boat-cut, pieces, cloth vision." These aren't techniques but descriptions of how recognition naturally manifests!
Emaho! Vision transcending karmic bondage - not through achievement but through recognition of what has always been free!
[5147-5176] Look here, dear practitioner! The wisdom palace takes shape—like sun-moon pair connecting, like lotus stack form, like stupa stack form, like thousand-petaled lotus! These arise from transcending the binding of five elements. They arise and cease together—one-arising, one-ceasing experience! From previous difference becoming, called "above increase." Thus awareness cause arises previously, empowerment sequence relies on arising.
Second vision manner particular explained: Wisdom five color vision and shape vision. First: Vajra family fully purify cause—mirror-like wisdom self-light color white form dawn, same vajra unmovable resonance white pierce dawn. Below: tathagata family fully purify cause, dhatu wisdom color blue form dawn, display resonance blue black dawn.
Jewel family fully purify cause—equality color yellow cloth, jewel source resonance refined gold like dawn. Lotus family fully purify cause—discriminate wisdom color red cloth, infinite resonance red coral like dawn. Karma family fully purify cause—action accomplish wisdom color green cloth dawn, actual accomplish resonance green indranila form like dawn.
Outer sequence blue vajra fence all surround—wisdom those difference not-existing show! From that, vision increase light five each chief color five five clear!
Understand, practitioner! These five wisdom lights are your own face—stop looking elsewhere!
Emaho! Five wisdom lights of original purity!
Listen here, dear practitioner! Do you not see how the visions of clarity dawn upon the path like the moon waxing full? When family differences arise in the mind [5177], do not grasp at them as real! The wisdom wind purifies all causes, and like a mirror standing upright [5178], the vision of mirror-like awareness naturally arises.
Look! Through practice and experience, these visions increase [5179]. The wing of equality dawns [5180], and delusion's vision exhausts itself near its own source [5181]. Then comes the discriminate vision, like boat-parts assembling [5182]. When subtle elements cease [5183], the victory-banner of accomplished action manifests as vision alone [5184].
Dear one, wisdom's self-resonance arises as individual clarity [5185], and the wisdom field becomes like a boat of conceptuality's coarseness ceasing [5186]. These paths arise in sequence [5187] - for those of great diligence, five days and five days; for middling practitioners, seven and seven; for lesser, twenty-one and twenty-one days [5188-5190].
See how below these visions, forms dawn with colors and shapes abiding for moments [5192-5193]? When these cease, the five wisdom shapes dawn [5193] - mirror-like shapes like spots in the eye [5194], increasing in excellent color [5195], with many lines dawning to the eye [5196]. This is the preliminary measure arriving [5197].
Then the net of equality dawns halfway [5198], purifying the wind completely [5199], completing the preliminary pure vision [5200]. Then heaps of flowers dawn [5201] through effortful gazing [5202], purifying the preliminary with thousand-petaled lotuses [5203]. Then weapon-like forms dawn [5204] with unfabricated nature [5205], completing the preliminary with wheels and various forms [5206]. Finally, the palace of dharmadhatu wisdom dawns [5207].
Thus practitioner, do not be distracted! These visions are your own nature displaying itself. Emaho!
Look here, devoted one! The awareness eye draws forth vision [5208], and from that, canopy tents and houses appear as preliminary purity [5209]. These too differ by diligence - three days, seven days, fourteen days of arising and ceasing as one [5210-5212]. Beyond that, experience increases vision even further [5213].
Listen! During this preliminary time [5214], conceptuality's difference raises and ceases as signs [5215]. Then the vision of awareness's self-essence dawns [5216]! Light points dawn like hanging cords gathering as one [5217], then two points connect - method and discriminating-awareness fully purify [5218], then five points connect as the five wisdoms enter [5219]. Direct connection of points - not different, merely small existence [5220] - experience increases beyond this [5221].
The Thalgyur declares: "The five-colored light, victory-banner and boat-part vision, seeing the field boat-only measure" [5223-5225]. The Self-Arising Tantra proclaims: "Seeing one's own face thus, upper joint four fingers apart, separate person of good capacity - how could they enter samsara?" [5227-5231].
Dear practitioner, whatever boat-part forms dawn accomplish emanation qualities [5232-5233]. Whatever fields dawn are the same heaps [5234-5235]. When outer visions cease, sixteen moments [5236-5238] - thus it is said.
Third, the awareness measure-arrive vision shows general manner [5240]. From explaining nature particularly [5241], first: points each dawn in half the body, purifying nirmanakaya [5243], then the body itself dawns each, directly seeing dharmata [5244], then body becomes five-by-five fathers and mothers as sambhogakaya wisdom measure-arrives [5245], then individual heaps with mandala vision [5246].
Thus, dear one, these are your own face - do not seek elsewhere! Emaho!
Listen well, practitioner! The mandala itself becomes periphery walls and individual chief-retinue form-vision [5247], the dharmakaya purification fully pure measure arriving [5248]. This is the awareness measure-arrive vision [5249]!
During preliminary time, body actions connect measures [5250-5251] - though separation results and purify-object, purify-agent cause-effect are merely designated [5252], they do not arise from production [5253]. Wisdom self-exists, resonating, purifying defilement obscuration forcefully through vision [5254].
The Thalgyur teaches: "Awareness measure-arrive vision, sambhogakaya marks-examples clear, uncertain color like rainbow, five families father and mother form-vision" [5255-5259]. The Bstan bu states: "Thus until body is reached, sixteen and ten and five and three, without doubt sambhogakaya" [5262-5265].
Second, explaining nature particularly [5266]: measure-arrive definition explained generally [5267], measure three explained particularly [5268]. First, awareness measure-arrive means awareness basis-abide becomes awareness manifest [5270], entering the path from basis-vision self-resonance spontaneously accomplished through dawn-door body-form-vision [5271-5272].
When path-vision exhausts near, mandalas complete [5273-5274]. Measure is first from half-body until body mandala complete [5275] - arriving means from that, exceeding place not existing, form-vision like full moon [5276-5277], waxing increase ceasing, mandala complete, self-essence not fabricated [5278].
Second, measure three particular explained: outer vision, inner body measure, secret awareness measure [5279-5282]. First: vision control lands, light-clear complete [5283]. The Thalgyur says: "Thus from arriving complete measure, direct entity-vision cease, earth stone vision melt, self-know whatever enter" [5285-5289].
Dear practitioner, do you see? Your own body becomes the mandala! Emaho!
Look here, devoted practitioner! Second, the inner body measure: when body dust purifies, from heart center white A, light-rays five coil like sun-reflection in intermediate-space, star-window inside dawn pierces [5302]. From crown uspa, wisdom wind abides, nature lifts vision [5303]. From urna, light-ray five fathoms, one light clear [5304]. Hand finger five-to, light five garland coil [5305].
See! Body hair-door etc., outer-inner part dust-particle scope, small each land realms number-not-exist, Buddha and beings measure-not-exist vision, spontaneously-accomplish door eight dawn vision, all here exceed lack not, self-vision-to vision [5306]! Crown-palate wrathful mandala and heart peaceful mandala [5307], body part all-to nature emanation, train-beings emanation, various emanation vision-through Buddha field-in self-vision beings benefit do vision [5308-5310].
Compassion door-from clairvoyance six sets, dharma all know wisdom dawns [5311-5312]. Pure wisdom door-from Buddha field pure, self-vision sambhogakaya complete, mind defilement pure, dust doubt separation itself obtains [5313-5314]. Ground and ground latencies self-pure, the Thalgyur declares [5315].
Measure-arrive body also thus becomes [5316], individual body dust free-from, intermediate-space light star-window vision [5317-5318]. Then light-ray hook shape, subtle and coil-through vision hold [5319-5320]. Body dust self-ceases, copper-shining stainless light body [5321-5322]. Center A mark, urna light-ray fathom one measure [5323-5324], crown-uspa wind-by lift vision [5325].
Peaceful-body hand finger from light garland form coil [5326-5327], sound-not mind activity [5328], head skull palace heruka manifest arises [5329-5330]. This time self-body measure-to arrives, copper-shining body three one coil [5331-5333].
Third, secret awareness measure: subtle coarse move mind pure although, all-ground consciousness only mind exists [5334-5336]. Awareness quality clairvoyance and eye-attachment not-exist dawns [5337] - this itself from!
Thus practitioner, your body is the mandala, your mind is the wisdom! Emaho!
Listen, dear practitioner! This time mind clear and clairvoyance six dawn, far and concealed become known, dharmas moment-by known become [5339-5342]. Measure-not Buddha realms and thus body also mind-to vision [5343-5344]. Empty mind-to defilement exhaust, nature not-move empty-clear obtain, unmixed equal-complete expanse-to pervade, manifest clear-through many separate-not, part not-exist elaboration-not [5345-5350].
That-also vision above two-to affliction-mind and mind-consciousness defilement manifest become purify-from, this obtain time collections eight first seven pure-from [5351-5352]. Subtle coarse defilement-from free, body mind connection cut-from [5353-5354]. Outer vision object awareness-to vision, investigate agent consciousness part all-ground consciousness power-by self-condition do [5355-5356].
Star-arrow sky-to move measure-like momentary investigate agent self-dawn that self-free antidote separate-to not-look pure [5357]. Vision above two time-at wind outward throw and inward not hold-from, conceptuality moment two-in not abide ability purify cause arise [5358-5359]. Body copper-shining, consciousness all-ground part concept-not object awareness fire-spark emit like clear-vivid [5360-5361].
Outer extending vision and inner self-vision vision aspect two see-through body mind separate cut [5362]. Realms three-to outward not return ground supreme mandala great accomplish [5363]. Again Thalgyur from: "Thus vision time all-to, body mind connect cut, contaminated exhaust body-from also, outward arise characteristic clear mind, star-arrow emit manner-by also, sky realm-to clear see" [5364-5370].
That itself first time all-to, wind and separate pure-from also, effort and pure wind action, body-from outward throw cause arise [5371-5374]. See agent two part-from also, body light-clear pure-to, mind fire-spark emit like, one-to not abide self-clear basis [5375-5378]. Vision aspect two manner-from arise, this-by body mind connect cut-from, realms three return not [5379-5381].
This time-at see agent also all-ground consciousness part star-arrow or fire-spark emit like and, awareness compassion wisdom part two exist-from [5382-5384]. See object outer inner two see wisdom part-to arise. This time-at antidote intentionally gaze manner set etc. not, always dharmata wheel-from not pass-from, practice measure complete by-say [5385-5388].
Dear one, your mind and body separate naturally - do not fear! Emaho!
Listen well, devoted practitioner! Fourth, dharmata exhaust vision has two aspects [5389]: exhaust manner shown briefly [5390], and nature explained extensively [5391]. First: before measure-arrive moon full like vision-from, self-resonance expanse-to dissolve manner [5392-5393]. That-from moon waning like, again body that fade-from bindu-to reach etc. first mind-to certain vision [5394-5396].
That container contents arise abide destroy empty four sequence-through vision four purify manner-to meaning sequence apply [5397]. Continuity samadhi-to abide-through dharmata wheel-from not pass [5477]. Eye and clairvoyance great control-through realms three dharma king regent-to power obtain [5478]. All-ground subtle knowable obscuration very cut white silk curtain merely-by cut except obscuration not-exist-from [5479].
Path dharma exhaust result by-say [5480]. That clear-from Buddha obscuration all separate-from inner expanse primordially-pure dharmakaya-to enter very peace [5481]. Thalgyur from: "Self-Buddha cease dharmata, element cease-from dust cease, dust and particle end cease-from, part merely also abide not, affliction cease-from delusion and, concept-free attachment not abide-from, latency and all-from arise, dust part merely also not abide, thus subtle coarse cease-from, aggregate five also end gradual subtle, element four body exhaust-from, all wisdom Sambhogakaya, concept-free samadhi self-abide, fabricate aggregate-from exceed-from, dharma by-say word-to not abide" [5482-5498].
Empty dharmata - channel wind coarse exhaust-from mind mental-events exhaust [5499-5500]. Body and wisdom vision aspect measure-arrive moon full like-also inner expanse-to set-from primordially-pure vision-to abide-from [5501]. Dharmakaya vision core result dharmata self-vision by-say express [5502].
Again before from: "Cause and result dharmata, conceptuality coarse source cease-from, memory self-pure continuum-from also, dependent-arising wind itself fully-pure, cause-from arise dharmata, primordial-from pure nature-to, one and many number exhaust, body and wisdom not-exist and, dharmas exhaust ground arrive, result dharmata is think" [5503-5513].
Dear practitioner, all dharmas exhaust into the ground - this is the result! Emaho!
[5398–5412]
Listen here, you who fear death! Longchenpa explains something profound: the four rivers - birth, aging, sickness, death - flow to exhaustion and cessation. But this isn't some philosophical theory! This is your direct experience, happening right now.
Look at the outer container disintegrating. "World exhausted, basis-place not-existing" - When the universe itself winds down, where can samsara continue? The cosmic show is ending, but you're still chasing appearances! The outer world ceases - this isn't apocalypse, it's the natural exhaustion of phenomena.
Now the inner sentient beings: "life span upward-growing, downward-decreasing" - This describes how beings mature then decline. But Longchenpa is pointing to something deeper: when outer container ceases, inner beings naturally exhaust too. If one doesn't happen, the other can't complete.
"These if not exhausted, self three realms not liberated!" - This is crucial! You can't achieve individual liberation while the cosmic support system remains active. The three realms continue because the conditions supporting them persist.
[5405–5412]
Now the profound teaching: "outer container's world exhausted, basis-place not-existing" - When the universe dissolves into emptiness, there's no ground to stand on. "Returning place not-existing" - Nowhere to go back to! "Main point" - This is the key realization!
"Inner sentient beings exhausted, birth-continuity ceased, awareness itself death free." When your own life-force exhausts naturally, without clinging or fear, recognition liberates you from death itself. Not that you don't die - you recognize death as exhaustion into dharmata!
"Then vision whatever's essence established not" - Whatever visionary experiences arise, they all establish in the same essential nature. This isn't hard to say - it's the simplest truth! "Dharmata exhaustion called, meaning's fruit!" - The complete exhaustion of all phenomena into their essential nature.
"Fruit is person this is not hard to say, mind's measure not!" - Don't measure your progress with concepts! "Dharmata exhaustion is measure-arrived time" - When all phenomena have exhausted into their nature, that's the time of completion.
Emaho! The exhaustion of dharmas isn't destruction - it's them coming home to rest!
