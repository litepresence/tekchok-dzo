[5802-5804] Listen! From the pure arising of Dzogchen speech's own face—Dzogchen speech certainly liberated, entered into the resonance of purity, meaning free from elaboration inwardly decided!
[5805-5808] Speech like a small-pot child emerging from between rocks—like gone! From prajna wisdom's empowerment, compassion gathered, arising! Dzogchen, beyond speech and thought, entered as the controller of speech's meaning, extremely elaborate-free word—grasping's extreme cut!
[5809-5811] Speech arising like cliff forms—from channel-abiding letters entered into wind's bindu, arising! Dzogchen inexpressible meaning entered into speech's sound!
Dear practitioner, do you see? Your speech is not ordinary chatter—it is the spontaneous display of wisdom! When you speak from recognition, every word liberates. When you rest in the nature of speech itself, elaboration ceases. Do not try to make your speech special—recognize its natural purity, and it becomes vajra speech!
Emaho! Speech liberation through Dzogchen words!
[5830-5833] Listen, dear practitioner! Extremely elaborate all near ceased, not-existing—empowerment! This also example faith, meaning's certainty! Also body's base is four elements' binding, liberating-released arising. Now elements self-nature return not-possible—main point!
[5834-5838] Speech's four: express-basis, express-condition, express-object, express-agent—four bindings liberated from. Now word self-nature say not-possible!
[5839-5844] Mind's four: mindfulness, no-mindfulness, unborn, intellect-transcended—four bindings liberated from. Now think naturally not-established!
[5858-5872] Thus empowerment four as example, faith by meaning thig-decided. Meaning: body, speech, mind, all dharmas, wind-mind-elaborate-free sphere, luminosity clear gathered!
Do you see? Body cannot be bound by elements! Speech cannot be captured by words! Mind cannot be held by thoughts! You are already empowered!
Emaho! Four empowerments—already complete!
[5873-5880] Listen, fortunate practitioner! Having heard the Buddha's qualities, do not obtain hope and thrill—the three self-established bodies, complete confidence! Having heard also of action and afflictions' cause and effect, do not fall into delusion-vision samsara fear—confidence beyond cause and effect!
[5881-5885] Having seen nirvana's own place, do not thrill with hope of liberation—primordial purity self-complete, strong place obtained, confidence! Four arising!
[5886-5889] From the Jewel Heap Tantra: "Four great confidences of unchanging view, non-returning wisdom measure also taken!" Thus aside from the four extreme reliances, sixteen visions conclude!
Dear practitioner, these four confidences are your own mind's nature! Do not seek them outside. Do not hope for them in the future. They are complete right now, primordially present. The three kayas are not somewhere else—they are your own body, speech, and mind when recognized. Rest in this confidence!
Emaho! Four great confidences—recognize them now!
[5907-5911] Listen here! From Self-Arisen: "Ground called does not exist elsewhere! To one truth-seeing person, all grounds completely exist!" That introduction-shown person—first, at truth-seeing time, joy arisen to that is first ground, Great Joy!
[5912-5921] To that, knowing own-vision is awareness—second ground Stainless obtained! Then habituation to that—third ground Light-Doing conquered! Then habituated, seeing light's vision—fourth ground Light-Radiating conquered! Then habituated to wisdom's vision, all afflictions self-nature purified, seeing wisdom—fifth ground Difficult-to-Overcome conquered! Then from light, dust body manifest—sixth ground Manifest conquered! Then habituation completed, afflictions far-gone—seventh ground Far-Going conquered!
Do you see? All ten grounds are in one moment of truth-seeing! Not sequential stages—simultaneous complete!
Emaho! The ten grounds of Dzogchen—all complete in one seeing!
[5935-5942] 
Listen here, you who love to count spiritual achievements! Longchenpa lists sixteen grounds of Great Perfection like they're some staircase you climb. But listen carefully - he's about to shatter your whole idea of progress!
First three grounds: "letter wheel great gathering ground conquered," "wisdom's vision abiding is fourteenth samadhi great ground conquered," "spontaneous presence ground certainly obtained is fifteenth vajra-holder ground obtained." Do you hear the numbers? Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen! This isn't mathematics - it's showing how conceptual mind loves to categorize and rank everything!
But then comes the crucial teaching: "Then primordial purity ground wisdom spontaneous dawns, above that other not-existing is, sixteenth wisdom teacher ground obtained, thus said!" Primordial purity ground - this is your own nature! When wisdom dawns in that ground, you don't move to another place. Above that, "other not-existing" - no higher attainment possible! The sixteenth ground is "wisdom teacher" - not because you've become something special, but because you recognize you've been wisdom all along!
[5943-5953] 
Now the master explains the danger: "These also appearance manner portions similar each joined merely, bodhisattva's ground ten actual not!" Do you understand? The sixteen grounds aren't sixteen different experiences to have! They're "appearance manner portions" - different ways recognition shows itself. Similar each, joined merely - not separate accomplishments but one recognition appearing differently!
"Bodhisattva's ground ten actual not!" - Oh, how this smashes your bodhisattva ambition! You think you need to complete ten stages before starting Dzogchen? Longchenpa says the actual grounds of bodhisattvas are only ten - and those aren't even real achievements, just conventional designations!
[5954-5962] 
And the profound point: "Also those grounds root awareness luminous-clear traverse not ground one's vision portion difference merely!" The root of all these grounds isn't some special vision - it's awareness itself, luminous and clear! "Traverse not ground one's vision portion" - you don't journey through different states. "Difference merely" - there's no real separation between one ground and another!
"Actually awareness's ground one merely, buddha vajra-holder obtain to cause ground particular existing not-need!" - This is revolutionary! All sixteen grounds are the same single ground of awareness! Becoming "buddha vajra-holder" doesn't add anything to your nature - it's just recognizing what's already true!
"Path main-point different entering door thus applied merely!" - Don't you see? All the methods, all the practices, are just "different entering doors" to the same room. The door doesn't matter - entering is what counts!
Emaho! Sixteen grounds? One ground! Stop counting and start recognizing!
[5963-5968] Listen here, dear practitioner! Dharmas exhausted, intellect-transcended meaning—zinc-tin reliance, wisdom change-change not recognized! In effortless vast great expanse, all primordially transcended. Bondage and liberation, abandon-accept not-existing manner—samsara nirvana nameless great roll!
[5969-5977] First three: Nature Dzogchen byar not sky-like meaning generally shown. Bondage liberation non-dual, own-mind emptiness root-free great thig-decided. Object-vision, mind's mirror collection, six great pervade! Outer vision, inner awareness, between grasping-holding, vision signs, samsara nirvana gathered dharmas all—primordial emptiness universal emptiness great! Appearance-emptiness, intellect-emptiness great! Pure-emptiness, liberation-emptiness great! Not experienced existent, not experienced non-existent. Not experienced true, not experienced false. Not experienced deluded, not experienced liberated. Not experienced samsara!
Do you see? Not experienced! All these categories—samsara, nirvana, true, false—you never experienced them! They are empty from the start!
Emaho! The three great emptinesses—beyond all experience!
[6027-6031] Listen, dear practitioner! Liberation arisen transcending object and thought! Roll into liberation direction-limitless, nameless! Not-look, look not—look-doer not, looked not see!
[6032-6035] Not-meditate, meditated not, transcended meditation, meditated also not liberated!
[6036-6041] Not-analyze, analyzed not, analysis not needed, analyzed also effort meaningless! Accomplishment not needed—already accomplished!
[6042-6048] Spontaneous self-liberation is the view! Effort-free self-established meditation! No-activity conduct! Result without hope! Dharmata's correct view spontaneously establishes all!
[6049-6052] From the Treasury: All these essence meanings are spontaneously presence's meaning! Not-thinking meditation is also meditation! Beyond intellect, spontaneously establish great!
Do you see, practitioner? You are looking for something that was never lost! Not-look, because there is nothing to see. Not-meditate, because you are already awakened. Not-analyze, because analysis is just more mind. Stop all this doing! Rest in what you already are!
Emaho! Spontaneous liberation beyond all meditation!
Listen here, dear practitioner! Self and grasp attachment object [6088]. First itself-from dharmata-to, this all self-by self vision [6089-6090]. Primordial vision before not know, self concept bind affliction five [6091-6092]. Primordial awareness self dawn, together abide face not meet [6093-6094].
Earth water fire wind element four, primordial self body [6095-6096]. Who not see eye dull [6097]. Very secret gather place speech essence, interval not self sound [6098-6099]. Who this itself not hear, ear power not-exist or [6100-6101].
Self abide expanse and awareness scent, separate occasion not self samsara, feel not experience nose cease or [6102-6104]. Essence three instruction one coil taste, primordial body mind essence, this itself not experience tongue cut or [6105-6107].
Vision self pure color ornament, self body separate not, body and shadow like, day night not abide [6108-6111]. Who also not touch body inert or [6112]. Suffering everywhere strike bliss dharma, forget not self abide [6113-6114]. Who not know mind dull, samsara latency again pile [6115-6116].
Primordial dharmakaya-to abide, who not see compassion place [6117-6118]. Power self concept object dawn-from, memory think move various [6119-6120]. Primordial Sambhogakaya self dawn, this all not memory forget worry [6121-6122].
Do doer conduct effort accomplish and, being gather noise all [6123-6124]. Primordial emanation body, who not know capability dull [6125-6126]. How think and memory move, river flow like interval not [6127-6128]. Always self mind attract, effort not self place meditate [6129-6130].
Experience not understand mind stray, container contents exist hear vision this [6131-6132]. Examine-by nature not-exist although, village city continuum cut like [6133-6134]. Primordial abide not see, power all door close or [6135-6136].
Thus and Thalgyur from [6137-6138].
Dear one, you have always been the Buddha - you merely forgot! Emaho!
[6139-6143] Listen, dear practitioner! The nature of visionary delusion—this is wisdom! Previously you did not see it as wisdom. Because the basis of conceptual delusion does not exist, the alaya is realized as the great dharmakaya. The continuity of delusion's self-concept has ceased!
[6144-6149] Thus, delusion-free vision arises from the key point of primordial fallenness. The aggregates of beings are the Buddha body—who does not know they are primordially so? The aggregates as Buddha, the lord of possession, channels and letters completely arise from the basis!
[6150-6153] Like bubbles in the eyes—who has not seen that wisdom is self-appearance?
Do you see, practitioner? Your delusion is wisdom! Your aggregates are Buddha! What you took as impure is primordially pure. What you took as deluded is primordially awake. Do not try to purify what is already pure. Do not try to wake up what is already awake. Simply recognize what you are—this is the Great Perfection!
Emaho! Your aggregates are the Buddha body—recognize this!
Listen, devoted practitioner! Self dawn from [6207]: Great perfection ati yoga-to, view and meditate and conduct not, although good teach mind-to hold, accomplish not ability move wish not [6208-6211]. Do not spontaneously complete before that itself meaning [6212].
Do and and doer where exist, conduct not dharmata self arise this [6213-6214]. Whatever direction-to not fall sky like, exist not is empty one only [6215-6216]. Not-exist not is true bliss body, make not is self arise concept not [6217-6218].
Great perfection ati yoga-to, meditate dharmata where exist [6219-6220]. Send and keep not dharma, meditate and not meditate end-from free [6221-6222]. Hold not mind defilement what, true awareness defilement not [6223-6224]. Defilement not pure dharmakaya-to, meditate and meditate do not [6225-6226].
Meditate-by true itself not find, find self awareness not become [6227-6228]. Why self awareness wisdom-to, distracted and not distracted not cause [6229-6230]. What-to hold exist-to, self arise wisdom exist not [6231-6232].
Thus and: again that also dharma all thus, birth not-from cease not, hold not-from self place free [6233-6237]. Reference not-from elaborate not, make-from not arise all-to exist, unconditioned-from fully pure expanse [6238-6240]. Hold term dharma separate, nature not-exist-from express separate [6241-6242].
Thus and Nor bu phra bkod from: "Ha ha, dharma not-from dharmata arise, object not-from object like vision, dharma not wisdom interior clear-from, memory not object-to not-exist" [6243-6250].
Thus and Seng ge rtsal rdzogs from: "Hold attachment not dharmata entity free this, Buddha all two not intention supreme, discriminate and mark word path, action effort not dharmata self place pure, ub chub samadhi dharmata object-to enter, pure and not pure term dharma not, one and two-from exceed primordial abide meaning, self body manner-to bindu one-by ub" [6251-6260].
Dear practitioner, do not meditate! Simply rest in what you already are! Emaho!
