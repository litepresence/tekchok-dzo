Great bliss liberation has no finding-time. You don't discover it. You don't achieve it. You stop drowning in the boat that's sinking into water. The mind that thinks it exists—this support, this foundation you stand on—is the deception itself. It's not real but it binds you tighter than chains.
Samantabhadra said it plainly: wanting dharmakaya as an object? Obstruction. Wanting whatever appears as mind? Obstruction. Wanting self-arising as something other than this? Obstruction. Even your longing for liberation can become a cage.
Does mind dissolve from existence into non-existence? The question assumes mind was something that could exist. But look—dissolve under examination and nothing holds. Un-examined, thoughts arise and dissolve on their own. No continuum going from here to there. No place where dissolution happens. No cause for dissolution. No condition for it.
So is destroying mind's house pointless since nothing was there to destroy? Exactly. That's the point. To primordially non-existent mind, there's nothing to get rid of—just recognition of what was never there. Memory's source going to dharmata isn't moving anywhere. It's seeing that there was never a mover.
The teaching calls it "destroying the house" but that's just words. Destroying the existent—nothing to destroy, nothing destroyed. Result is non-dual: object-mind without division, knowing without separation.
Sixteen non-existent dharmas—this isn't a new list to memorize. It's pointing at how everything you think is solid is empty. The Great Secret Certain Heart-Essence cuts through everything: mind was never born, so it never needs to be liberated. Movement is sudden, already free. Other instructions point at mind ultimately non-existent while pretending to exist conventionally.
Rest in that pretending. The pretending is the freedom.
Nothing more. The end of the path is not a place you arrive at. It's the recognition that you were never moving.
Rest now. The rest is complete.
PAGE 156
View and meditation are paths, but what are they path to? Self-liberation, self-dawning, self-placing—sounds contradictory until you see the point. Making the primordially non-existent, desiring non-existence of what was never there. The union isn't joining two things. There's nothing to join. Non-dual union is just recognizing that two never existed.
Here's the most crucial teaching across all vehicles: don't desire appearance as mind. Don't hold mind as something that exists. The great basis of buddhahood isn't found by grasping at experiences. It's there when you stop looking.
Objects appearing in mind's mirror—that's all there is. Six aggregates, everything that appears, all just clear appearance of non-existence. Outer appearances, inner thoughts, all the senses—just like cataract-hairlines you think you see, like illusions, like magic tricks. They appear but have no real basis.
Here's freedom: at the very moment of appearing, you're already beyond existence and non-existence. Nothing to hold onto, nothing to push away. You can say "it's" or "it's not," "exists" or "not exists," "appears" or "empty," "deluded" or "liberated," "good" or "bad," "mind" or "other." All designations work because none of them capture anything real.
Empty first. Then designation. The emptiness is prior. The labels come later. Like dreaming—there's no dreamer doing the dreaming. Like magic—no magician behind the illusion.
Rest in that prior space. The designations keep themselves company.
Nothing to add. Nothing to subtract. Just this.
PAGE 157
Virtue and vice, good and bad—they all dissolve suddenly. Their essence has no basis. They're self-liberated the moment they arise. Awareness has a primordial tone—if you try to grab it, you've already missed. The dharmata has no direction to point, no place to find.
All appearance, existence, samsara, nirvana—they're all the same great display: clear appearance of non-existence. Appearing without solidity. Like elements in sky, like dreams in sleep—not moving from awareness's nature. Everything self-appears in awareness, but awareness doesn't see samsara as something separate. Doesn't see nirvana as achieved. Both are just designations on something that was never divided.
Great liberation comes from not being caught in exists or not-exists. You can call it anything. Liberation isn't contradicted by any word. But words don't capture it.
Samantabhadra said: to unstained mind, appearance is not dependent on objects. That's what I showed—that's the great self-pure intention. Not cleaning up your mind, but recognizing the mind that was never stained.
From another text: entity of complete non-existence, not falling into any direction. Whatever deludes you is just appearance appearing harmoniously, yet that appearance isn't real. Like ornaments in dharmadhatu—beautiful, but not solid.
Great emptiness wisdom deludes from complete non-existence. Here's the paradox: not seeing emptiness as nihilism, not seeing it as something. Both sides cut.
The Pearl Garland puts it simply: that is me, that is beings. Mind arises from mind. Not many, just one. Samsara-nirvana is myself. Mandalas are just paths for those who need steps. Dharmas appear as dharmas. Abiding, moving, sitting, sleeping, living, dying—all arise from that. Earth, water, fire, wind, space—all from that.
From that—the vast awareness that can't be pointed to. Everything appears, nothing sticks.
Rest in that. The rest is effortless.
PAGE 158
Delusion was never real. From the very beginning, dharmakaya is like sky—vast, open, uncreated. But clouds of beings suddenly appear and obscure it. Clouds aren't separate from sky. They arise from sky, dissolve back into sky. You're like that—appearing suddenly, thinking you're real, but you were always sky.
The five afflictions—desire, anger, ignorance, pride, jealousy. They seem real when they blow through. But like clouds, they have no solidity. They arise conditioned, dissolve conditioned. Knowing this, how could you be bound? You're watching the weather. The weather can't trap the sky.
The ancient text keeps exclaiming: great wonder! This mind has no dwelling place, no going place. Six doors of perception all enter, yet nowhere to enter. All-gathering ground, yet nowhere to gather. Circling ignorance has no power to change anything. Afflictions have no root, no basis. Everything appearing is like clouds, like echoes.
How does an echo work? Sound against rock, bouncing back. The singer sings, the sound arises. But the tone itself never moved. Sound just appears, conditioned by conditions. Dharmas are like that. All of them.
Great wonder at the basisless! The path isn't adding something—it's recognizing that nothing was ever stuck. Primordial wisdom doesn't need an antidote because there's nothing to cure. Going and coming awareness, end without end, dwelling without dwelling—all great wonders when you stop trying to pin them down.
Rest in that wonder. The wondering is the rest.
PAGE 159
Here it is—the direct introduction. Not a method, not a technique. Just placing self-settled awareness in its own clarity. Not pushing outward, not pulling inward, not thinking in between. Looking directly at the nature of mind itself—outer, inner, middle: all empty. Self-clarity, no foundation needed.
Dharmakaya isn't confused by your views and meditations. Your concepts don't move primordial wisdom. The intention isn't fabricated by mental elaboration. In clarity, thought has no place to stand. In vastness, nothing to lose. In equality, no distance to cover.
Great self-tone without a doer. Tone and emptiness like ocean. Clear and pure like sun and moon. Vast and pervading like sky. Stable like a mountain king. This is the nature, primordial and complete.
All beings already abide here, not experiencing separation even for a moment. But we don't know our own face. We get mixed up in samsara through conceptual elaboration. The lama's instruction points directly: whether it appears as dawning or dwelling or whatever, just recognize self-settled nature. Stop wandering.
From the Lion Perfection: the path that lions cross without—action and effort falling away. The lion of effortlessness, darkness clearing into three powers. Primordial purity like untainted snow.
Samantabhadra kept pointing: when accept-reject fall away, self-liberation appears without direction. When dullness and excitement cease, great equal meditation arises. When hope and doubt dissolve, primordial confidence remains. The six aggregates naturally present, not manufactured.
This is not something to achieve. It's what's already the case when you stop pretending you don't know.
Rest now. The resting is the recognition.
PAGE 160
This dharma-nature—grasping at it is already wrong. It's not something to hold onto. Buddhas' intention is non-dual, beyond concepts of one and two. Pure and impure are just words. The path of words and signs points at something beyond words.
The great maintaining: maintaining view-meditation beyond objects, maintaining self-settled samadhi, maintaining intention transcending mind. But maintaining doesn't mean trying hard. It means resting in what's already the case.
In that face-introduction, no grasping at methods or antidotes. Just place awareness vast and wide, primordially set, no top or bottom, no distance to cover. Self-liberated.
The old texts keep pointing: whatever place the first place is, the last goes there. So just dwell in that meaning now. Not later. Not after you finish reading. Now.
In sky of non-grasping, in sky of non-consciousness—consciousness unmoved, supreme samadhi of non-wandering. Single buddha, single grove, single nature.
Self-dwelling: not making grasping elaboration on anything that appears. Outer, inner, middle—all empty. Wide open, self-liberated, vast place. Even when you sleep, sleep in that nature and dreams become clear light.
The thunder of recognition shakes everything but leaves nothing disturbed.
Rest now. The rest is already complete.
PAGE 161
Here are the actual instructions. Not philosophy—practice.
Three doors of spontaneous release: whatever appears, let it go. Don't chase, don't push away. Identify the nature: vast open gone, all self-liberated.
Body posture: cross-legged, eyes open, staring at the space in front. Cut the mind's habit of grasping and rejecting. Identify awareness's half-pure nature—already clear, already present. Let the five winds settle into space.
What appears: outer visions like smoke, mirage, rainbows—inner dharma-nature empty clear like dawn. Both are the same display, self-appearing, self-pure.
Train in three samadhis:
First: self-dwelling just-place. The power doors don't stop—sense experiences keep arising. But you don't use them, don't abandon them. Body stays natural, speech natural, mind unmoved. When objects appear, just know without moving. Clarity without thought.
Second: great thunder samadhi. Body like ordinary person, speech like ordinary speech, mind not tightened. Self-arisen awareness, not wandering anywhere.
Third: appearance expand samadhi. Body, objects, awareness—grasp all as self-appearing purity.
Then maintaining intention beyond mind has four aspects:
Mountain-just-place view: stable, unmoved like a king of mountains. Ocean-just-place intention: vast, unmoved by waves. Awareness-just-place instruction: clear, direct. Appearance-just-place method: whatever appears, let it be.
Don't doubt. The nature doesn't need to change.
Sit. Eyes soft, gazing at space. Identify clarity without moving.
That's the practice. Done.
Rest in that. No further instructions needed.
PAGE 162
The ocean of just-place carries intention without trying. Not appearance, yet appearances arise. Not empty, yet not existing as emptiness. Not clear, yet clarity itself. Not dull, yet excitement never stirs. Unmoved, unmoving, beyond all movement. The great method of place isn't made—it just is. Not making send and receive, not grasping or rejecting.
Not dwelling anywhere, not transcending anything—ocean-like primordial wisdom, vast and spontaneous, unmoved in space. From ocean depths impossible to measure, see the peak of victory never setting. Empty mind, great body unmade. By not-making, conquer all making. Primordially unarisen, unmade, just this.
Dharmata dwelling in sky—intention shown. Dharmakaya, primordial wisdom—thought completely abandoned. If no movement, no making, that's the intention of meditation.
When not grasping at appearances or their directions, like stars dawning in ocean depths, clarity never ceases. That's how self-arisen intention dwells.
Identify the naked burst of clear-empty awareness—wide wide wide self-clarity. Cut the mistake-place of samadhi-grasping. From within, copper-shining dharmakaya dawns.
Looking outward at self-knowing objects, great thought-free dharmakaya found within.
When gazing at outer appearances, place in the self-clarity dawning from within. Looking outward at awareness-clarity dharmata, see awareness free from all divisions.
Rest there. The rest has no further instructions.
PAGE 163
The great method of appearance is just-place awareness. Appearances great, yet not basis of all. The five elements appear like Buddha paths. The five greats—mother herself clear as appearance. Place in not-wandering nature, grasping non-existent.
Three vital points of dharmata's wheel in sky-equal space-clarity:
First: Instruction placing mind itself, action separate from dharmata's nature—realized not by action but by non-action place. Three doors self-settled vast.
Second: Instruction concepts dawning as primordial wisdom—dharmata's self-direct introduction.
Third: Instruction appearances non-existent, refute-establish—dharmata's liberation from self-place.
That nature separate from action is not realized by action. Realized by non-action. Place the three doors self-settled vast.
From the Great Garuda: if samsara and nirvana are action-action itself separate, what other doing exists from this great perfection?
Face-introduce appearance as mind's play. Play basis-non-existent clear appearance. Face-introduce as delusion if grasping clear appearance. Face-introduce self-clear non-existent appearance by non-grasping—outer object appearance, mind other non-established, empty object of samsara birth.
Face-introduce appearance-grasping mind basis-non-existent. Face-introduce basis-non-existent empty self-course. Face-introduce self-course track-non-existent primordially liberated—circle-maker self-mind liberated basis-non-existent, echoing in three realms name-non-existent dharmata.
Nature dharma-nature peace: perception object non-existent. Entity non-existent itself: appearance self-search self-appearance. Self meaning dharma-nature: appearance mind separate. Look self object, not making send-gather.
Rest there. The rest needs no further words.
[6957-6962] 
Listen here, you who cling to views! Longchenpa is showing you the progressive introduction—face-introduce mind to empty, then appearance to mind, then empty to awareness. Each step completes the previous. When you recognize appearance as mind, mind becomes complete. When you recognize mind as empty, happiness spreads through that emptiness. When you recognize empty as awareness—ah! That's dharmakaya itself, non-dual with space.
But watch out! Some hear "awareness itself and space are non-dual" and they attach to the words, grasping at some self-characteristic. They think they've got it conceptually. Don't be like that! This pointing is not the moon itself.
[6963-6972] 
This teaching has three aspects you need to understand: intended basis, purpose, and actual logical problems. Why? Because the words "appearance is mind" are provisional—skilful means, not ultimate truth. They don't approach the heart-essence intention of the Nyingthig teachings.
The intended basis: Longchenpa said these words provisionally, to guide those who grasp outer objects as truly existent. From the Self-Arising Tantra: "Sometimes show appearance to mind." See? Sometimes—not always, not ultimately. This appearance-is-mind view is designated only to stop attachment to outer objects. That's the purpose. Nothing more.
[6973-6981] 
Now the actual problems with this view—listen carefully! If appearance truly IS mind, then mind would have color and shape, because eyes see colors and shapes! And if appearance, mind, and empty awareness are all mixed together as one substance, then:
- Awareness would be deluded (ridiculous!)
- Appearance couldn't be seen by eyes (but it is!)
- Mind wouldn't be deluded (but ordinary mind IS deluded!)
Three contradictions from treating them as one thing! This distinction was explained before—don't think you can liberate yourself by just doing "appearance is mind" yoga. It's a step, not the destination.
[6982-6994] 
From the Self-Arising Tantra, the Buddha himself said: "Appearance-mind yoga—all arise from my mind. If mind itself is realized, what is there to do? All expressing that word—I said not liberated."
Even the scriptures refute this view! If mind doesn't exist, appearance wouldn't exist either—yet it does. When mind ceases, appearance would cease at that same time—yet it doesn't. And appearance exists even when there's no mind—further proof this view has problems.
There are five occasions when mind doesn't exist, explained in the Middle Extremes...
Emaho! Don't get stuck in the provisional—keep moving toward the ultimate!
[6996-7001] 
Listen—you want to know when mind doesn't exist? Here are the five occasions: deep sleep without dreams, fainting, and the two types of absorption (entering meditative equipoise), plus the state of being without any conception at all. In all these, where is your "appearance is mind" view then? Mind is gone, yet appearances still exist! This alone refutes that view.
To sum up: believing appearance is mind is great darkness of wrong conception—you must eliminate this!
[7002-7012] 
Now the third point—the crucial instruction that appearances are free from assertions and denials through self-liberation in their own place within dharmata:
The five outer elements don't exist—they're empty, naturally pure like the moon's reflection in water. No need to purify them! Inner mind's memories and thoughts naturally dissolve without trace—no need to destroy them with antidotes! Appearance and mind are spontaneously liberated from the start—no need to add acceptance or rejection! Rigpa is naked and bare—don't clothe it in elaborations!
Just release into great evenness without leaving a trace, and the five gates naturally enter as self-arisen self-liberation.
[7013-7037] 
From the Sixth Treasury (Klong Drug Pa)—listen to this!
"The great self-appearance of all sentient beings—no place to search elsewhere. By their own power, self-knowing..."
This is Samantabhadra's intention self-arising in the expanse! When you let go into the vast swaying of "khral ma khrol, sang ma seng" (unfabricated, unconstructed), everything becomes the mandala of spontaneously arisen meaning.
From the same text: appearances are all like illusions, dreams, reflections—unthought great image. Whatever arises in one's stream, appearances fall like rain, not remaining in the condition-stream. One obtains irreversible samadhi!
Emaho! When appearances self-liberate as delusion, how could non-delusion not liberate?
Listen to this supreme instruction from the Letterless Tantra!
"All arises from the unborn—deluded appearance is my mind. All abides—deluded appearance is my heart. All appears—deluded appearance is my body. All sounds—deluded appearance is my speech."
Look—seeing doesn't cease, appearing like my form. Hearing doesn't cease, sounding like my voice. Smelling doesn't cease, feeling like my scent. Tasting doesn't cease, spreading like my taste. Touching doesn't cease, moving like my mind. Secret afflictions are my miracles! Buddhas and sentient beings are my cemetery!
"All-doing I am—great self-clear appearance!"
But you might ask: if deluded appearance is left in its own place, won't it just become more deluded?
Listen! Ordinary beings grasp at self, so they're deluded. But yogins know there's no basis, so without fabrication they rest in natural flow—not deluded!
From the Pearl Garland: "Sentient beings in samsara are bound by their own conceptions. Knowing they're natureless, definitely liberated."
Delusion and liberation depend on inner knowing, not outer appearance! Outer appearance never did any deluding or liberating. Just leave appearances as they are—that's enough!
Tilopa said: "Appearance doesn't bind—grasping binds. Cut the grasping, Naropa!"
This resting in natural flow of rigpa in self-dawn essence—nothing needs deliberate correction through view, meditation, or conduct. You can't improve the nature! Spontaneous self-arisen wisdom cannot become untrue.
From Rtsal Rdzogs: "By thinking, wisdom's meaning isn't found. If wisdom's meaning found by thinking, self-arisen wisdom becomes false..."
Recognizing appearance and awareness as dharmata, whatever you do in conduct doesn't transcend dharmata!
Emaho! All activity becomes the path when resting in natural flow!
