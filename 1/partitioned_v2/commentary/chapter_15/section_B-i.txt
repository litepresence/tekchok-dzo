Listen here, you who fear death! Longchenpa explains something profound: the four rivers - birth, aging, sickness, death - flow to exhaustion and cessation. But this isn't some philosophical theory! This is your direct experience, happening right now.
Look at the outer container disintegrating. "World exhausted, basis-place not-existing" - When the universe itself winds down, where can samsara continue? The cosmic show is ending, but you're still chasing appearances! The outer world ceases - this isn't apocalypse, it's the natural exhaustion of phenomena.
Now the inner sentient beings: "life span upward-growing, downward-decreasing" - This describes how beings mature then decline. But Longchenpa is pointing to something deeper: when outer container ceases, inner beings naturally exhaust too. If one doesn't happen, the other can't complete.
"These if not exhausted, self three realms not liberated!" - This is crucial! You can't achieve individual liberation while the cosmic support system remains active. The three realms continue because the conditions supporting them persist.
[5405–5412]
Now the profound teaching: "outer container's world exhausted, basis-place not-existing" - When the universe dissolves into emptiness, there's no ground to stand on. "Returning place not-existing" - Nowhere to go back to! "Main point" - This is the key realization!
"Inner sentient beings exhausted, birth-continuity ceased, awareness itself death free." When your own life-force exhausts naturally, without clinging or fear, recognition liberates you from death itself. Not that you don't die - you recognize death as exhaustion into dharmata!
"Then vision whatever's essence established not" - Whatever visionary experiences arise, they all establish in the same essential nature. This isn't hard to say - it's the simplest truth! "Dharmata exhaustion called, meaning's fruit!" - The complete exhaustion of all phenomena into their essential nature.
"Fruit is person this is not hard to say, mind's measure not!" - Don't measure your progress with concepts! "Dharmata exhaustion is measure-arrived time" - When all phenomena have exhausted into their nature, that's the time of completion.
Emaho! The exhaustion of dharmas isn't destruction - it's them coming home to rest!
[5429-5476] Listen, fortunate one! Experience increase etc. vision not arising from exhaust also exists—this mind supreme instantaneous! Before purifying action potential, respect guru—from others merely exhaust manner exists.
Second nature extensive explained: Essence, definition, nature, dharmata, boundary—five aspects. Dharmata exhaust essence: outer light five vision body together exhaust, inner dust together concept aggregate together exhaust, experience vision object exhaust, primordially-pure vision sky-like manner awareness abides—thal 'gyur! Dharmata exhaust vision, experience vision from empty, body exhaust sense object also exhaust, concept aggregate delusion-from free, express basis word and separate—thus!
Definition: Dharma by body speech mind aggregate dharma affliction together, itself purify agent path vision luminosity meditate part together. Exhaust is empty—mind meditation object vision together self-reverse-from not-exist, not observe by-say! Thus dharmata certain definition: Dharma know aggregate gather-to, action do and characteristic hold, self-vision empty do-to, individual families hold, itself fabricate not-exist-to, natural abide-through real pervade, unfabricated original continuous-to, sound word name number exhaust—thus!
Nature: outer inner vision mind exhaust sky blue-grey resonance like primordially-pure self-resonance merely-to activity—rtsal rdzogs! This time exhaust characteristic, action-free sky like thus—thus!
Dharmata two: vision dharmata—outer inner dust together exhaust-from channel wind exhaust, that exhaust-from mind-to depend latency all-from arise characteristic defilement subtle seed part those also exhaust!
Emaho! Dharmata exhaustion of all phenomena!
Look here, dear one! Our guru holy Vimala and Padmakara very sublime such rely those this or bardo without-doubt free certain [5565]. Manner these secret conduct seed tantra from [5566]. Inner body exhaust ground arrive time, finger etc. thus vision [5567-5568].
This focus element self cease, birth and enter difference-by [5569-5570]. Dharma all exhaust self ground-to, what also hold not [5571-5572]. Abide is emanation body, this-by enter power control [5573-5574]. Birth self-power who obtain, that also that-to focus-from [5575-5576].
Again time thus do time, vision self-sound rustling, manifest reverse delusion vision, this-by beings benefit all do [5577-5580]. Awareness equal one cause, thousand three beings, transfer great this accomplish [5581-5583]. Thus gradual and instantaneous, body this-by accomplish [5584-5585].
That all body exhaust measure-from free, this all result certain [5586-5587]. Ground supreme mandala great accomplish [5588]. Thus vision four dawn that also path arise sequence by-say [5590]. Example ladder rung like, that also path abide part-from dawn agent not cease [5591-5592].
Path obtain part-from what also not establish not-exist [5593]. Thus vision four measure arrive-from this itself contaminated not vision Buddha-from [5594]. Vehicle common those-from especially sublime-from, dharma this meet-from diligence practice do-to effort do [5595-5596].
That itself-to Buddha accomplish desire person-by, this means possess thus thus [5597-5598]. Other conduct pride do itself is-from, entity see not [5599-5600]. That cause this all rare word, always jewel treasure this look [5601-5603].
Meaning four extreme rely instruction four above those support back support or closely arise [5604].
Dear practitioner, these teachings are rare jewels - treasure them! Emaho!
[5516-5520] 
Listen here, you who think Dzogchen is complicated philosophy! Longchenpa now addresses your intellectual tendency to create contradictions where none exist. He's about to smash your conceptual thinking with simple, direct truth!
"Fruit's primordial purity without body and wisdom—heart-essence misreading arises!" Do you understand what this means? You try to separate primordial purity (*ka dag*) from its natural expressions - body and wisdom. But Longchenpa says they're inseparable! Like trying to separate fire from heat!
"Outer appearance resonance body and wisdom crystal-light inwardly returned like portion, thus said, meaning not understood merely!" Oh, how students love to analyze! You think Longchenpa is giving complex doctrinal points. But he's saying: When you over-intellectualize, you miss the direct experience!
"Actually, inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence; uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished contradicts..." Longchenpa is listing all the logical contradictions you create when you try to understand primordial purity through concepts!
[5525-5540] 
Such contradictions - listen carefully! "Uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished" - this is what happens when you think time is linear! "Inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence" - this happens when you separate ground from path!
But here's the crucial point: Longchenpa says "Such faults accepting not suitable!" Why? Because these aren't real intellectual problems to be solved - they're symptoms of conceptual mind trying to grasp what's beyond concepts!
[5541-5548] 
Now, after destroying your intellectual errors, the master gives the actual teaching: "Fifth boundary: measure-arrived curtain from exhaustion beginning time, own four legs' fingers light five clear merely existing..."
This isn't some complex visualization technique! The "measure-arrived curtain" isn't something to practice - it's the natural display when awareness recognizes its own completeness. The "four legs' fingers light" aren't special powers - they're how your innate capacity expresses itself!
Emaho! Stop trying to understand primordial purity and just recognize it directly!
[5540-5542] Listen here, dear practitioner! This delusion-vision's vision appears like a mirror's reflection. That own body also like water-moon—wisdom illusory body, self-vision zinc-tin, free from elements' harm, vajra body obtained! For sentient beings' benefit, called arising as body of great transference!
[5543-5548] Others' impure eye, from merely stone-with zinc-tin not seen. Great master Vimala and Padma likewise! Then birth and entering, two powers obtained. Even instant Buddha, duration exists. Until samsara not emptied, doing sentient beings' benefit, also freedom power!
[5549-5556] Birth power is: entering dharmadhatu, putting rigpa into three thousand beings, all liberated at one time—great power obtained! Insects also dive into light! Birth power obtained, whatever desired emanated, spontaneously doing sentient beings' benefit!
Do you see? Your body is the vajra body! Not seen by impure eyes, but for those with pure vision—mirror-like, water-moon-like! You have the power of birth and entering. Use it for beings!
Emaho! Vajra body of great transference!
Listen, devoted practitioner! Body part stretch-by body consciousness self slow do [5650]. Knee chest join-by body element-from wisdom ability draw do [5651]. Hand palm armpit or knee top-to cross-from action and latency end do [5652].
Second rest wisdom vital: conceptuality emit and bliss part not arise this thus do [5653-5654]. Knee chest join hunched sit-from, emit action wind reverse need exist [5655-5656]. That reverse-from outer body various vision, inner-to mind abide [5657-5658].
Foot sole earth-to press-from life effort action wind reverse, that reverse-from outer body-to heat arise, inner-to dharmata birth not experience arise [5659-5661]. Hand-by nape-to embrace stretch, navel action wind reverse, that reverse-from inner-to conceptuality many cease, outer-to wisdom vision fully pure above increase [5662-5665].
Such vital those: body vital ability, channel vital wind-to, wind vital mind is cause [5666-5669]. Sambhogakaya posture-to also sound explain [5670-5671]. Elephant great by-saying power and vehicle great part-from express body vital that-by wisdom special lift cause [5672-5673].
Meaning divide two-from: set continuity vital, face cover sleep-by existence three overcome power do, knee chest join-by delusion wisdom-to dawn basis do [5674-5676]. Big-toe earth-to outward extend-from move do action wind harm do, hand fingers earth-to press-from, dharmata manifest dawn support do [5677-5679].
Nape mind little raise-from conceptuality wisdom-to dawn do [5680]. Second rest wisdom vital-to: face cover door three attachment existence overcome, hand foot four earth-to place-from, foot big-toe place outward push-from conceptuality action wind reverse [5681-5684].
Dear practitioner, these physical postures are the door to wisdom - practice them! Emaho!
[5606-5609] Listen, dear practitioner! Three unmoving body establishes the base. Three bindings take measure. Three obtainings give pointing. Four confidences show liberation measure!
[5610-5619] From Spontaneous Liberation: "There make extreme reliance and faith. Three unmoving base established, wind-mind arrived at key point! Three abidings measure taken, dream reverse and body, speech, mind—signs and measure certainly taken!"
[5620-5633] From Jewel Garland: "Three unmoving confidence place, self-nature path exhausted! Confidence remaining not, doubt self-liberated. Confidence again not, hope and fear released. Confidence path not, effort spontaneously accomplished!"
[5634-5649] Also from same: Three unmoving, three abidings, three obtainings—these are not techniques! They are recognition of what already is. Do not try to unmoving your body—recognize it is already unmoving!
Do you see? The base is already established! The measure is already taken! Stop trying to achieve what is already complete!
Emaho! Three unmoving, three abidings, three obtainings—all complete!
Look here, dear one! Sambhogakaya press-from this itself-to Buddha field realms three see become [5717]. Nirmanakaya press-from this itself-to beings benefit obstacle not-exist accomplish need exist [5718].
Second dawn agent gaze manner unmoving three [5719]. Mu tig phreng ba from: "Door is that itself unmoving and, thus-by" [5720-5722].
Nirmanakaya gaze manner-to look-from awareness compassion vision-to enjoy [5723]. That also eye relaxed rely-from samadhi separate not possible [5724]. Mind little down-to place-from emptiness think separate view hold do [5725]. Equal look-from affliction power-to become not possible [5726].
Sambhogakaya gaze manner-to look-from awareness nature vision manifest see [5727]. Body not move-from eye two right-to equal look-from, delusion all time one-to cease [5728-5729]. Corner-from look-from dharmata-from separate not possible [5730]. Left-to look-from expanse and awareness-to nail hit [5731]. That itself corner-to mind little press-from nadi go come cease [5732].
Dharmakaya gaze manner-to look-from awareness essence see [5733]. Eye two equal upward mind little reverse-from lower realm three birth place continuum cut [5734]. Eyebrow center-to press-from awareness-to wander place not-exist [5735]. Sky space-to focus-from expanse awareness-to separate place not-exist [5736].
Eye relaxed is all same [5737]. Third bind draw unmoving three: body limb bind-from six realms delusion wheel continuum cease [5738-5739]. Finger joints all bend-from body action destroy do [5740]. Occasion nape channel press-from light vision self manner dawn basis do [5741]. Body bind finger leave-from realms three name not-exist do [5742].
Second speech unmoving three: who and also speech not mix-from six realms common action empty do [5743-5744].
Dear practitioner, gaze without moving - this is the key! Emaho!
[5685-5692] Listen, dear practitioner! Through that returning, outward delusion-vision ceases, inward body and mind warmth arises. Two palms' ends pressed to earth, moving action wind returns. Through that returning, outward thigle and thigle-particles dawn, inward day-night without experience arises. Chin mind slightly raised, grasping action wind returns. Through that returning, outward body's vision sees, inward wind's movement exhausts!
[5693-5696] Dharmakaya's posture also explained in speech: Like three perfected lion's strengths, whoever is without fear, body's key point dispels three realms' fear.
[5697-5699] Also on meaning's flow distinctions: Continuous sitting key point—body sitting in dog's crouch causes dharmadhatu and rigpa to meet.
Do you see? Your body is the path! Press palms to earth, raise the chin—winds reverse, vision dawns! Do not think this is just exercise. These postures are wisdom's gateway! The body you drag around all day is actually the dharmakaya's throne!
Emaho! Reversing the winds through body postures!
[5745–5754]
Listen well, devoted practitioner! Longchenpa now teaches about the third aspect of mind unmoving - and this is crucial for your practice!
"Conceptuality not arise, thought generation cease, mind substance dharmata naked dawn!" What does this mean? When conceptual mind stops creating, awareness reveals itself naturally! The "mind substance" (*sems kyi rdzas*): This isn't some mysterious essence - it's the nature of mind itself, dharmata, naked and revealed!
"Example bee inside jar like, jar bind-from move not, that-like conceptuality not arise, appearance aspect mind clear-from bind do!" Oh, how perfect this analogy is! The bee trapped in a jar can't fly - but it can buzz against the glass. Similarly, your conceptuality can't arise when awareness holds it in clarity! The "appearance aspect" of mind isn't trapped - it's liberated into its natural brightness!
Now the physical practices: "Navel wisdom fire-from mind little turn-from coarse conceptuality clear light purify do!" When you warm the navel wisdom fire, subtle mind moves, and coarse conceptuality naturally purifies into clear light!
[5755–5768]
"Secret place channel little press-from emission reverse bliss wisdom-from not separate do!" This isn't about physical pressure - it's about recognizing how all experiences are wisdom manifesting!
"Navel fire burn-from red bindu melt-from crown white bodhicitta fall-from four joys arise, joy thought generation cease-from dharmata clear light dawn!" The four joys aren't physical sensations to cultivate! They naturally arise when conceptual thinking ceases and dharmata reveals itself as clear light!
[5769–5780]
"Thus example dream clear-from wake like, mind appear aspect clear light purify-from dharmata naked dawn basis do!" Like waking from dream - when clarity dawns, you see the dream was never real! The "appearance aspect" of mind purifies into clear light, revealing dharmata nakedly!
"Mudra partner practice-from that similar do, external bliss generate-from internal bindu melt-from wisdom clear light dawn!" External practices can support this, but the real practice is internal recognition!
But practitioner be careful! "Without knowing nature, merely bliss attachment generate-from animal birth cause become!" If you grasp at bliss experiences without recognizing their nature, you create more bondage!
"Therefore emptiness compassion not separate essence know-from bliss empty like appearance enjoy do!" The key: compassion and emptiness are inseparable! When you recognize bliss as empty appearance, you naturally express compassion!
Emaho! Conceptuality is the thief that steals your wisdom - let awareness unmoving reveal the naked dawn!
[5745-5746] Listen, dear practitioner! Through cutting the word's reversal, the word self-arisen wisdom dawns! Through blocking merely one's own speech, dharmas all abide in the inexpressible state—certain!
[5747-5752] Third, mind's three unmoving: Through not separating from focused stiffness, always abiding in Buddha's intent. Through entering awareness dharmadhatu's scope, not straying from entity's nature. Through always not separating from that itself, four visions measure arrived—certain! Also, moving by moving-turned returning is called—key point of liberating from those!
[5753-5761] Second, taking measure of three abidings: Three body's abidings free from action. Three wind's abidings taking measure of non-production. Three appearance's abidings confidence in non-reversal. First three: Abiding without dwelling in action, samsara's delusion cannot increase. Abiding in projecting and gathering limbs, delusion's wheel continuity ceases. Placing action in the ground, certain separation from accumulated action's ripening.
[5762-5764] Second three: Wind not going outward abiding, conditioned appearances various—no harm. Inward not blinking abiding, no support for various conceptual thought. Without going-coming outside-inside abiding, basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two—empty.
Do you see? Not moving is the key! When you stop chasing, wisdom dawns. When you stop blinking, concepts have no place to land. This is not doing something new—this is stopping the doing!
Emaho! Three unmoving, three abiding—liberation without moving!
[5774-5777] Listen, dear practitioner! Four empowerments' fruit arising as direct becoming! At dharmata direct perception time, body like tortoise-shell vessel put in—body's channels slowly abiding arising. That is Dzogchen meaning, effort-free, body's limbs entered!
[5778-5783] Pot empowerment's action purified, elaborate wisdom self-arisen certainly arises! At increase-above time, body like person tormented by disease gone—channels, central wind entered arising! Dzogchen negate-assert not-existing meaning generally entered, secret empowerment's action purified, non-elaborate wisdom self-arisen arises!
[5784-5788] At measure-arrived time, body like elephant sinking in mud—mind channels wind obtained arising! Dzogchen accept-reject not-existing meaning heart entered, prajna wisdom empowerment body purified arising—extremely non-elaborate wisdom self-arisen arises!
Do you see? Each empowerment purifies deeper! Body like tortoise-shell, like diseased person, like sinking elephant—all pointing to wisdom self-arisen!
Emaho! Four empowerments' wisdom self-arisen!
Dear practitioner, do you see? Your speech is not ordinary chatter—it is the spontaneous display of wisdom! When you speak from recognition, every word liberates. When you rest in the nature of speech itself, elaboration ceases. Do not try to make your speech special—recognize its natural purity, and it becomes vajra speech!
Emaho! Speech liberation through Dzogchen words!
