[7038-7051] 
Listen to this supreme instruction from the Letterless Tantra!
"All arises from the unborn—deluded appearance is my mind. All abides—deluded appearance is my heart. All appears—deluded appearance is my body. All sounds—deluded appearance is my speech."
Look—seeing doesn't cease, appearing like my form. Hearing doesn't cease, sounding like my voice. Smelling doesn't cease, feeling like my scent. Tasting doesn't cease, spreading like my taste. Touching doesn't cease, moving like my mind. Secret afflictions are my miracles! Buddhas and sentient beings are my cemetery!
"All-doing I am—great self-clear appearance!"
[7052-7059] 
But you might ask: if deluded appearance is left in its own place, won't it just become more deluded?
Listen! Ordinary beings grasp at self, so they're deluded. But yogins know there's no basis, so without fabrication they rest in natural flow—not deluded!
From the Pearl Garland: "Sentient beings in samsara are bound by their own conceptions. Knowing they're natureless, definitely liberated."
[7060-7084] 
Delusion and liberation depend on inner knowing, not outer appearance! Outer appearance never did any deluding or liberating. Just leave appearances as they are—that's enough!
Tilopa said: "Appearance doesn't bind—grasping binds. Cut the grasping, Naropa!"
This resting in natural flow of rigpa in self-dawn essence—nothing needs deliberate correction through view, meditation, or conduct. You can't improve the nature! Spontaneous self-arisen wisdom cannot become untrue.
From Rtsal Rdzogs: "By thinking, wisdom's meaning isn't found. If wisdom's meaning found by thinking, self-arisen wisdom becomes false..."
Recognizing appearance and awareness as dharmata, whatever you do in conduct doesn't transcend dharmata!
Emaho! All activity becomes the path when resting in natural flow!
[7085-7104] 
However appearances appear, they dawn as unceasing display—naturally arisen meaning's mandala! Eating and drinking become dharmata's approach. Sleeping and sitting become bodhi's practice. Activities become deity's abiding meditation. Stretching and bending become mandala practice. The three thousand worlds become spontaneously accomplished mandala.
Look at this!
- Rain falling by itself—splashing, sprinkling
- Roads and paths—the great natural line
- Footprints—colored sand of the mandala
- Movements—nature of mudra
- Speech—vajra recitation
- Thoughts—creation stage wheels
- Whatever appears—deity's display
- Your own body—the empowerment vase
- Descent—the continuous samaya
- Clear knowing—self-dawn instruction
Birth and death become dharmata's familiarity. The six collections' object-appearances self-arise as realization!
[7105-7149] 
From the Pearl Garland—marvel at this!
"Emaho! If appearances thus deluded also self-liberate, how could non-deluded not liberate? Whatever speech and activities—conduct of empty-aware-clear. Good and bad thoughts—meditation of river's great depths. Wrong view and right desire—yogin's view without distinction. All hope and doubt holding—uncontrived spontaneous result."
The Great Seal—by eating and drinking, approach. By sleeping and sitting, practice. Activities are deity abiding. Stretching and bending are mandala practice. The three thousand worlds are all mandalas where rain and steam sprinkle down.
Paths seen by beings are the great line. Footprints are colored sand dust. Those wanting to walk—posture itself! Moving limbs are mudra. However spoken—mantra words. Thoughts are creation stage. Mind movements are offerings. Form-appearances are deity body. Great sound speech is music. Your own body is the vase. Hair is the year's leaves, ornaments beautiful. Blood and water-essence waters are entrusted with essence substances. Self-appearing empowerments are given—perfect in un-transferred! Those wanting to transcend—samaya itself. Those wanting to protect—binding itself. Those wanting liberation—deviation! Those wanting non-existence—Supreme Sage!
All views are mudra's scope. Attachment to them is deviation experience. Clear knowing awareness is the instruction. Object and mind as two—field for that. Birth, aging, sickness, death—familiarity key. Six collections unceasing—realization!
[7150] 
Thus whatever the yogin does, generating in dharmata's nature—the deity mandala with empowerment completion and instruction...
Emaho! Every moment becomes the mandala when recognized!
[7151-7162] 
Completion—dharmata's mandala, natural flow, river continuum samadhi without break! Without effort, without depending on cause and effect, wondrous great accomplishments are spontaneously obtained. This is the great mandala of supreme ground!
From the Tal 'Gyur:
"Thus all is dharmata—nothing to accept, nothing to place, nothing's dharmata. Whatever appears, from its own dharmata, there's no fabricated dharmata elsewhere. However done, unthought arises. Without abandoning or accepting—self-appearance!"
[7163-7178] 
From Self-Arising:
"Don't attach to appearance. Don't establish non-existence. Don't abandon existence. Don't hope for non-existence. Don't apprehend existence. Don't establish what is done. Don't cease what arises. Don't view arising as fault. Don't abandon afflictions. Don't establish Buddhas. Don't meditate meditation. Don't view view. Don't cease deluded appearance. Don't seek pure appearance."
[7179-7182] 
From Nor Bu 'Phrul Bkod: "When knowing that cognizes objects appears to objects, appearance is self-appearance. At that time, let awareness release into openness."
[7183-7194] 
The third meaning—all transcended from the start in the great expanse of spontaneous evenness. Without bondage or liberation, without abandoning or accepting—in the great nameless samsara-nirvana. These are the twelve great vajra laughs of the great perfection, pointing to the greatness of the crucial key:
Great perfection of nature, great nameless samsara-nirvana, great transcendence of cause and effect, great already-complete without doing, great self-liberation without abandoning or accepting, great effortless dynamic display...
From the Great Heap of Jewels Tantra:
"Kye! Vajra heart-essence of all Buddhas' speech..."
Emaho! The twelve great laughs burst forth from the natural state!
[7196-7203] 
"Kye Speech Vajra! Look at self-arisen wisdom's view—wonder! Beyond virtue and vice, beyond view and meditation! Ground unmoved—whatever body and speech do, free from benefit and harm of virtue and vice. Ha ha!"
[7200-7208] 
"Look at the mode of abiding of reality's nature—wonder! Appearance doesn't change color, doesn't shift. However happiness or suffering is thought, nothing happens to the meaning. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"
[7204-7212] 
"Look at the wisdom of great emptiness, source of all—wonder! Whatever memory-thought conduct is done, appears as display. However done, liberates as unborn in unceasing expanse. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"
[7213-7223] 
"Look at wisdom of empty awareness pervading all—wonder! Unborn and abiding together from the start. Even if a man took sharp weapons and liberated all beings at one time, that person's stream is free from benefit and harm. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"
"Look at your own awareness, empty all-appearance wisdom—wonder! However appearing, all dawn as your own companion. Whatever appears, doesn't move from your own ground. Ha ha!"
[7224-7230] 
"Look at awareness-empty all-liberated appearance—wonder! Your own antidote is greatest! Afflictions self-liberate by themselves. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at awareness-empty all's nature—wonder! Without effort, result self-found. One finished, all samsara-nirvana purified as nondual. Ha ha!"
Emaho! These laughs shatter all conceptual mind!
[7231-7244] 
"Without practicing six perfections, collections complete at one time. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at naked rigpa, great emptiness all-even wisdom—wonder! All activities appear as ornaments. All abandoning and accepting liberated by view. Ha ha!"
"Look at emptiness of emptiness, great primordial emptiness—wonder! All Buddhas abide at home. By activity and meditation—falls, becomes! Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at nonempty emptiness, truly existent—wonder! Vehicle grasping at non-existence as self. Ha ha! Born, obtains unborn. Ha ha!"
[7245-7247] 
When you look at your own rigpa nakedly, twelve laughs abide in the nature—effort self-pacified. One should turn to the great beyond-mind, dharma-exhausted.
[7248-7263] 
Having explained Great Perfection's natural straightforward speech, one should believe in the mind's depth. Similarly, by the eight great marvelous words, one should turn to the meaning of samsara-nirvana dharma-exhausted objectless, from the Heap of Jewels:
"Emaho! Speech Vajra Heart Essence, you listen! By the key of your own rigpa free from birth and death—even for those who cut the life of billions of beings, and those always practicing ten perfections—no difference even a speck, thus have I, Samantabhadra, taught!"
"Vajra of all Buddhas' speech—by the key of no elaboration in dharmata, between the person always habituating to emptiness and the person not making emptiness mind for even an instant—no difference even a speck in becoming Buddha, thus have I taught!"
"Kye Speech Vajra! By the key of rigpa itself uncompounded, between the faithful one who did immeasurable compounded virtue and the person always delighting in taking life..."
Emaho! In the natural state, all extremes collapse into equality!
[7264-7290] 
"No difference even a speck in completing the collections—thus have I taught! Kye Speech Vajra! By the key of rigpa's wisdom without coming or going—between the person with various dharmata signs arisen in body and speech, and the person who hasn't trained mind even an instant in study and reflection—no difference even a speck in seeing reality—thus I taught!"
"By the key of no birth or cessation in dharmata—between one experiencing hell's heat and cold, and one experiencing Buddhas' bliss—no difference even a speck in obtaining realization—thus I taught!"
"By the key of rigpa's unchanging nature—between cutting through dharmic elaborations and eternalist view—no difference even a speck—thus I taught!"
"By the key of dharmakaya existing in oneself—between extensive outer offerings and praise, and sitting without activity—no difference even a speck in obtaining result—thus I taught!"
"Therefore, those who practice these great self-arisen words, finding confidence in unmaintained experience, are Buddhas inseparable from appearance and three kayas."
These eight word-kings are established by eight great unchanging meaning-reasons. For supreme minds, explain literally. For lesser minds, explain through two truths so they'll understand later.
Emaho! The natural state is beyond all partiality!
[7291-7318] 
From Self-Arising: "When lion utters its own roar, all carnivores faint and fear. When Great Perfection speaks its own words, all lower vehicles faint."
Therefore, this secret instruction for those without fortune who take cause and effect as definitive—keep secret! From the earlier text: "These words, don't speak them even a speck among hearers and self-Buddhas. Why? When they hear these words, they become fearful, terrified, faint. Not faithful to secret mantras, despising them—through that ripening they'll experience great hell. So don't even speak in the direction of wind!"
From general Secret Mantra: "To immature beings, revealing secret is the seventh root downfall."
From Bodhisattva Bhumis: "Showing emptiness to untrained mind is explained as root downfall." Therefore secret!
The eight marvelous words purifying eight consciousness-collections, twelve unchanging great adamantine letters—these bind to dharma-exhausted beyond-mind. Explained so heart-vessels don't contract. Without hope, doubt, binding, grasping—samsara-nirvana at one time released into great namelessness.
For great yogins who reach this nature, cause-effect virtue-vice explained directly—like Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, Tilopa. For us, though mind understands thus, not arriving through familiarity, so explain combined with not fearing nature and being careful about subtle karmic cause-effect.
[7320] 
Thus twelve vajra laughs explained three times as three bindings become thirty-six—corresponding to purifying the twelve links of dependent origination: direct, reverse, and completely cut.
Emaho! Secret teachings for those with fortune!
[7321-7327] 
Understanding the meaning of these bindings briefly explained, the word-meaning elaboration is enough. The second general meaning—decisive cutting on the spot, binding has three: decisive view as self-arisen wisdom, intention maintained as time-free three times, dharmata rested as nothing exhausted from the start.
[7328-7354] 
First: one's own rigpa, empty-luminous unchanging nature—this is bare wide-open direct nature. Decide definitely! Don't fabricate or mix anything with mind's view-meditation-conduct-result dharma. Practice uncontrived spontaneous great completion view-meditation, vast natural flow.
From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Secret mantra rigpa resting is the knot of view-meditation-conduct. For outer inner secret wisdom, mind's conceptions unmoved—this is secret mantra's secret view. Bhagavan Lion's dharmakaya abides in non-dual samadhi..."
"From dharmakaya source of all, dissolving into vast objectless expanse. Without acceptance-rejection, it's conduct. Seeing self-appearance, it's view. Not distracted from that, explained as meditation..."
"Without abandoning-placing, obtaining samadhi. Without falling to extremes, reaching own place. Uncontrived, self-arisen, complete from the start."
[7355-7357] 
Second: maintaining intention as time-free three times has two aspects: placing inward in the nature of empty-luminous equal clarity without fabrication, fresh, shimmering, radiant openness...
Emaho! Decisive view without elaboration!
[7358-7370] 
Without break, vast openness, placing time-free three times' pure intention in great river depth—oral instruction of self-clear own-place expanse.
First: adjusting body key and wind key, placing awareness self-clear appearance self-appearance without grasping-grasped—loosely!
From Sixth Treasury: "Suchness uncontrived, like sky unclouded. Self-dawn self-clear portion. Thus in clear sky, like sun's essence self-appearing. Nature stainless body. One gathered definite essence—this is my mandala!"
[7371-7394] 
Second: practicing with ten great methods cutting time-three's mind connection:
From same text: "One who doesn't follow past's trace, doesn't project future's hope, places present awareness in own place—all awareness without before-after mixes as one. One-gathered one nature called yogin of time-three equality."
Not tracing past's latencies. Not welcoming future's latencies. Not abiding present's latencies in stream.
By self-liberated memory method, mixing samsara-nirvana as nondual: cutting past memories' interval, pressing down future memories' head, letting present memories self-dissolve.
Not aiming at past mind. Not turning back to future mind. Not placing attention on present mind.
Not sending ransoms to past ignorance. Not casting fathers to future ignorance. Not taking present ignorance in lap.
Emaho! Cut all ties to the three times!
[7395-7416] 
Not biting at past aversion. Not hooking future aversion. Not feeding present aversion.
Not gathering past delusion's clouds. Not cutting ground with future delusion. Not raining with present delusion.
Not answering past Buddhas. Not inviting future Buddhas. Not offering to present Buddhas.
Exposing past desire itself. Cutting future desires. Removing present desires from objects.
Not holding tight past jealousy. Not gathering mind with future jealousy. Not placing mind in present jealousy.
This is the yogin realized in time-three equality, called great yogin realizing samsara-nirvana nondual!
[7417-7420] 
Also, three-time Buddhas are special rigpa wisdom experiences, instructed to abandon joy-fondness grasping. Other nine are objects of assertion-denial appearing, and self-abiding unspecified delusion. Grasping characteristics, cutting time-three's connection while abiding in dharmata—this is meditation on grasping characteristics.
[7421-7444] 
Third: resting dharmata exhausted-nothing from start. From Seng Ge Rtsal Rdzogs: "Virtue doesn't realize Buddha meaning. If virtue realizes Buddha meaning, Great Perfection nature becomes false..."
Emaho! Rest beyond all effort and achievement!
[7452-7464] 
First: general explanation of self-liberation's meaning. Second: particular explanation of self-liberation's dharmata. Third: extensive expression of self-liberation's intention.
First: In the path of Ati Vajra Heart Essence extracting from afflictions, purifying afflictions without abandoning in place—not like Hearers abandoning, not like Bodhisattvas abandoning, not like lower mantra creation stage transforming, not like completion stage self-pacifying, not like general common vehicles taming with antidotes, not like Mind Section placing in own system, not like Space Section making that dharmata.
[7465-7490] 
Why? If afflictions' suchness is not known as never experienced, not abandoned by abandoning. If mind abandons afflictions, abandoned and abandisher being one substance cannot purify. If wisdom abandons, mind doesn't see wisdom. Wisdom not seeing mind, not abiding together—actual contradiction—abandoned-abandisher term doesn't apply.
Not abandoned by before-after. Past-future substance contradiction. One exists, one ceases. If simultaneous, mutually mixed—abandoned becomes antidote, antidote becomes abandoned—for mind-stream one time simultaneous.
Also, afflictions arising from that mind itself—like body and shadow—no time of abandoning by abandoning. Similarly applies to training, etc.
From Sun Moon Union: "If suchness not realized, yogin like body and shadow. From that self-arisen—abandoning doesn't abandon. Training also not. Transforming doesn't transform..."
Emaho! Self-liberated from the very beginning!
