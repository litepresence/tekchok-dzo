Listen, devoted practitioner! Self dawn from [6207]: Great perfection ati yoga-to, view and meditate and conduct not, although good teach mind-to hold, accomplish not ability move wish not [6208-6211]. Do not spontaneously complete before that itself meaning [6212].
Do and and doer where exist, conduct not dharmata self arise this [6213-6214]. Whatever direction-to not fall sky like, exist not is empty one only [6215-6216]. Not-exist not is true bliss body, make not is self arise concept not [6217-6218].
Great perfection ati yoga-to, meditate dharmata where exist [6219-6220]. Send and keep not dharma, meditate and not meditate end-from free [6221-6222]. Hold not mind defilement what, true awareness defilement not [6223-6224]. Defilement not pure dharmakaya-to, meditate and meditate do not [6225-6226].
Meditate-by true itself not find, find self awareness not become [6227-6228]. Why self awareness wisdom-to, distracted and not distracted not cause [6229-6230]. What-to hold exist-to, self arise wisdom exist not [6231-6232].
Thus and: again that also dharma all thus, birth not-from cease not, hold not-from self place free [6233-6237]. Reference not-from elaborate not, make-from not arise all-to exist, unconditioned-from fully pure expanse [6238-6240]. Hold term dharma separate, nature not-exist-from express separate [6241-6242].
Thus and Nor bu phra bkod from: "Ha ha, dharma not-from dharmata arise, object not-from object like vision, dharma not wisdom interior clear-from, memory not object-to not-exist" [6243-6250].
Thus and Seng ge rtsal rdzogs from: "Hold attachment not dharmata entity free this, Buddha all two not intention supreme, discriminate and mark word path, action effort not dharmata self place pure, ub chub samadhi dharmata object-to enter, pure and not pure term dharma not, one and two-from exceed primordial abide meaning, self body manner-to bindu one-by ub" [6251-6260].
Dear practitioner, do not meditate! Simply rest in what you already are! Emaho!
[6261–6313]
Listen here! From Six Spaces: "Extreme-free center objective-reference not, thought not objects not! Deity not mantra also existing not! Dharma not tagged all transcended! Enemy not friend also existing not! Body not sense-power vision not! Dharmas thought not vision! What not where holding not! Self not self's retinue also not!"
This is the ultimate! Nothing to hold, nothing to reject. Like space, it accommodates all yet remains unchanged. Your attempts to grasp this are like trying to catch the wind—futile!
[6271–6313]
Appearance mind, mind awareness, awareness dharmata—self-nature not-established! Thus exhaustion's meaning complete! Dharmata exhausted, all exhausted, appearance exhausted, mind exhausted, dharmata exhausted, spontaneously exhausted, meaning complete!
Emaho! Complete exhaustion into dharmata!
[6314-6320] Listen, dear practitioner! From the Condensed Sutra: "Tathagatas always arisen, non-existing dharmas, all dharmas blissfully gone like! Childish intellect grasps characteristics, world engages in non-existing dharmas!"
[6321-6326] Also from King of Samadhi Sutra: "When this world arises, arises then ceases, abiding empty—know all dharmas thus! Middle beyond extremes, aspects perfectly clear, completely luminosity!"
[6327-6333] From Jeweled Heap Sutra: "Non-arisen dharmas not-ceased, nature thus completely clear! No objective-reference, no characteristics, no name, no definition—example and expression also exhausted!"
Do you see? All these sutras are pointing to the same truth—dharmas do not arise! You search for arising, but nothing ever arose. You fear ceasing, but nothing ever ceases. Rest in the non-arisen!
Emaho! The ultimate truth of non-arising!
[6357-6364] Listen here, dear practitioner! Mind, whichever of those two dawns—outward dawns, outer object; inward dawns, inner body! Fragments divided, particles portion not considered. Arisen vision-object not-existing see time, from that mind not-arisen awareness-ground grasping. Object conceptuality basis not-existing, root-free great thig-decided!
[6365-6371] Arisen maker sha-ra-ra o-la-la's mind and mind-arisen self, self-arisen instant's knowing substance two become. Self other-from not-arisen analyzed. Now arisen place self-arisen—arisen or thought color and shape? No color, no shape, not-existing color various, not-existing shape various! Thus appearing like mind, mind also dharmata free, dharmata also self-liberated!
Do you see? Mind is self-arisen! Not from outside, not from inside—just self-arisen! No color, no shape, yet appearing!
Emaho! The self-arisen nature of mind!

You want to understand mind? Forget everything you think you know. That's the problem—you already have a mind full of concepts about mind. Can't find a clean surface in a dirty room.
The Buddha said it clearly: mind is not outside. Not inside. Not between. Not blue. Not yellow. Not any color you can point to. What does that leave? You. Looking. Confused.
Kashyapa asked the right question—how do you search for something that has no edges? The diligence of fully searching mind isn't about finding something. It's about exhausting the search itself. When you stop looking for mind, what's left? That's the question. Don't answer it intellectually. Sit with it until the question dissolves.
Now here's where it gets uncomfortable. If mind exists, where did it come from? If it doesn't exist, what is this thinking right now? You can't say "it doesn't exist" because something is clearly happening. You can't say "it exists" because you can't find it anywhere.
The arguments pile up: If mind is one with body, when body dies, mind dies. But you know there's continuity—you've been born before, you'll be born again. If mind is different from body, where does it go between lives? And why do you forget everything when you're born? If mind is one single thing, why do you have contradictory thoughts? If mind is many, why do you feel like one person?
These are not puzzles to solve. They're koans to break you open. Stop trying to answer. Let the questions burn through your conceptual cage.
The deepest cut: if there's a place for mind to return to, there must be a cause. But causes are impermanent—they arise, they pass. How could permanent awareness depend on impermanent causes?
Here's the punchline you're not going to like: you're asking the wrong question. Mind isn't something that can be found because mind isn't a thing. Mind is the looking. Mind is what's aware of these words. Mind is the space in which "mind doesn't exist" appears.
Stop searching. Rest in what's already looking.
That's not an answer. That's the end of questions.
PAGE 151
Keep digging. The hole goes deeper than you think.
If mind has no returning place, how do beings keep coming back? If mind is many different things, why does your experience feel unified? Here's the paradox: if all minds were truly separate, your thoughts would interfere with mine. You'd conquer me. I'd defeat you. We'd merge into some mongrel consciousness with no clear owner. But you have your suffering. I have mine. We don't share it. So mind isn't many.
If mind is one single thing, when you die, do I die too? When you wake up, do I wake up? But your memories aren't my memories. Your fears aren't my fears. So mind isn't one.
Caught. Neither one nor many. Neither exists independently nor depends on causes. What do you do with that?
The search exhausts itself. You look for mind through every door—inside, outside, between, one, many—and find nothing to grab onto. That finding nothing is the realization. The emptiness isn't empty of meaning—it's full of primordial wisdom that can't be grasped by concepts.
But wait—if mind has no cause, how does anything happen? If mind has causes, those causes must produce results. If results are samsara, they're impure—how can liberation come from impurity? If results are liberation, samsara never arose in the first place. Caught again.
The scriptures say it plain: ignorance's wheel has neither exhaust nor increase. Being's realm has no end. The nature of mind isn't born, doesn't die, doesn't increase or decrease. What does that leave?
You. Looking. Not finding. Resting in not-finding.
That's not nihilism. That's freedom from conceptual boxes. Mind can't be caught because mind is the catching itself.
Stop trying to figure it out. The figuring is the trap. Rest in the space before questions arise.
Silence is the answer that asks nothing.
PAGE 152
Stop grasping at both sides. That's the whole path right there.
No increase means no birth. No birth means no death. No death means no evil in actions. What's left when you remove all the edges? Nothing to protect. Nothing to destroy. Just clarity shining through itself.
The text says it plain: the pair of existence and non-existence itself is non-existent. You're arguing about whether the shadow is real while ignoring the light that casts it. Both sides are conceptual traps. The Buddha didn't teach existence. Didn't teach non-existence. Pointed at something beyond your concepts.
How could beings be born if they're pure from the beginning? The question assumes beings exist to be born. But beings are like illusions—appearing without solid basis. You think you're real because you suffer? Dreams feel real too, until you wake.
If mind had conditions, it would be destroyed. But mind isn't destroyed in deep sleep. Isn't born when you wake. It just changes mode—like a lamp turning down low. The flame doesn't die. It just becomes harder to see.
The cloud example is perfect: clouds appear in the sky but aren't in the sky. They gather, dissolve, leave no trace. You see them, point at them, name them—but they were never separate from sky. You are like those clouds. Appearing in awareness, not separate from awareness, leaving no trace when you dissolve.
Your memories aren't real either. You remember yesterday's dream as if it happened—feel happiness finding the jewel, holding it tight. Then you wake and nothing was there. Right now, reading these words, you're doing the same thing. Holding thoughts as real. But after you die, after this life dissolves, what remains?
Nothing to find. Nothing to lose. The search itself was the mistake.
Rest in the sky. The clouds take care of themselves.
PAGE 153
The supreme path has no traces. Peace without cause or condition. Not achieved. Not arrived at. Already the case.
Does mind have form? No—you can't point to it, weigh it, photograph it. Does mind exist without form? How would you know? Through thoughts? But thoughts come and go. Where's the thought from a moment ago? It dissolved. The present thought hasn't been born yet. The future thought doesn't exist. What's left?
If movement-thought is one, how can it be many different thoughts? If it's many, what makes them one mind? Caught in both directions. Neither holds.
Thus mind's existence is unestablished. Not proven. Not disproven. Simply unfindable—like trying to find the edge of space. You look everywhere and find no inside or outside.
This is not depressing. This is liberation. Rootless sky means nothing to hold onto, nothing to lose. No birth-basis means no place to return to after death. Your memories, your thoughts, your entire life—dissolving like morning mist in the sun. No basis. No owner. No problem.
This is faith: not believing in something, but recognizing the lack of solid ground. Three realms, countless beings, infinite stories—all appearing in that sky, never staining it, never separate from it.
Actions become light when you see this. Virtue and vice still matter for ordinary life, but they don't trap you in the grund You help others not because you're saving souls but because helping is what clarity does.
This is the ease: sudden thoughts arise, sudden thoughts pass. No harm sticks. No benefit gets stuck either. The wheel turns without a turner. Buddha-nature not achieved because it was never lost.
Rest in the rest that needs no rest.
Nothing more to say. The sky says it all.
PAGE 154
Cut through everything. That's the only tool you need.
When you finally stop trying to find mind, ease arises. Not the ease of getting what you want—the ease of nothing to get. No returning place, no support, no house to maintain. The house of mind ceasing isn't destruction. It's just rest. The child builds houses in sand and knocks them down. No loss. No tragedy.
Here's the radical teaching: Buddha doesn't exist. Not even as a concept. Not even as a name. You're not becoming Buddha—you're recognizing that the whole project was based on a misunderstanding. The hope for results, the effort on the path, the striving to achieve liberation—all of that is what's being cut.
Samsara and nirvana are just names. Labels you slap on experience. The liberation measure is not finding meaning in those labels. They're empty sounds. Pointing at nothing. You thought you needed to escape samsara to reach nirvana? You're pointing at the same thing with different words.
Mind itself is non-existent. Having nothing, being nothing. No cause to find, no reason to seek. The four aspects of non-existence, the sixteen dharma-dwellers—this is not a new system to learn. It's describing the cessation of all systems. Destroying mind's house means there was never a house. Just appearances before-after, arising and dissolving.
Iron destroys iron. Impermanent destroys impermanent. Wisdom destroys ignorance. But who is destroying what? No one doing it. Like writing on water—no trace left. Looking for mind in mind is like looking for treasure in a poor man's house—it was never there to find.
The dissolve has no place to hold. That's why it's called liberation—not because you achieve something, but because there's nothing left to lose.
Stop searching. The search is the trap. The ease is on the other side of stopping.
Rest now. The rest has no further instructions.
PAGE 155
Great bliss liberation has no finding-time. You don't discover it. You don't achieve it. You stop drowning in the boat that's sinking into water. The mind that thinks it exists—this support, this foundation you stand on—is the deception itself. It's not real but it binds you tighter than chains.
Samantabhadra said it plainly: wanting dharmakaya as an object? Obstruction. Wanting whatever appears as mind? Obstruction. Wanting self-arising as something other than this? Obstruction. Even your longing for liberation can become a cage.
Does mind dissolve from existence into non-existence? The question assumes mind was something that could exist. But look—dissolve under examination and nothing holds. Un-examined, thoughts arise and dissolve on their own. No continuum going from here to there. No place where dissolution happens. No cause for dissolution. No condition for it.
So is destroying mind's house pointless since nothing was there to destroy? Exactly. That's the point. To primordially non-existent mind, there's nothing to get rid of—just recognition of what was never there. Memory's source going to dharmata isn't moving anywhere. It's seeing that there was never a mover.
The teaching calls it "destroying the house" but that's just words. Destroying the existent—nothing to destroy, nothing destroyed. Result is non-dual: object-mind without division, knowing without separation.
Sixteen non-existent dharmas—this isn't a new list to memorize. It's pointing at how everything you think is solid is empty. The Great Secret Certain Heart-Essence cuts through everything: mind was never born, so it never needs to be liberated. Movement is sudden, already free. Other instructions point at mind ultimately non-existent while pretending to exist conventionally.
Rest in that pretending. The pretending is the freedom.
Nothing more. The end of the path is not a place you arrive at. It's the recognition that you were never moving.
Rest now. The rest is complete.
