[4790-4793] Listen here, dear practitioner! From that itself: "Self-face awareness hanging-cord, going-coming free, sky held!" From Instructions: "Within dharmadhatu hanging-cord, placed not separate!"
[4794-4801] Also wind slow rely, deed-free meaning tantra arises! Awareness hanging-cord A placed, conceptuality source exhausted, delusion base return, wisdom mother-son meet! Awareness wind free, going-coming not—awareness self-matured!

Do you see? The hanging-cord is your own awareness! Not separate from dharmadhatu! Place the A, exhaust conceptuality, mother-son meet! This is direct!
Emaho! Hanging-cord of awareness—direct path!
[4816–4857]

[4891–4895]
Listen here, you who wait for some spectacular vision! Longchenpa explains measure-arrived awareness - and you might miss the revolutionary simplicity!
"When awareness reaches its full measure, vision arises—not as something new, but as what has always been." Do you understand this? You're looking for three kayas as some future attainment, but Longchenpa says they're your path itself! Like standing in a lake searching for water - you're missing that you're already standing in it!
"Like searching for water while standing in a lake, you miss what is under your feet!" The visions of the three bodies don't come from elsewhere. When coarse and subtle grasping ceases, dharmata exhausts itself into pure vision. This isn't gradual improvement but immediate recognition!
[4896–4905]
The three kayas dawn as path-vision, leading to pure expanse where all dharmas are exhausted—this is primordial purity itself. Your own self-vision dissolves into awareness, and from expanse of awareness, three kayas spontaneously function. This is the heart-essence that other vehicles do not even hear named—the intent of the king of vehicles!
Now, the crucial distinction: "Conventionally, you speak of direct perception—senses meeting objects, mind engaging conditions, self-awareness experiencing sensation." But yogic direct perception is different! It enters the actual point, particular correct awareness and its vision-object without duality, free from grasping and holding.
This isn't philosophy—this is your own experience when recognition dawns! When awareness directly meets its own nature, there's no separation between seer and seen, no knower and known!
[4906–4919]
Now, four aspects of nature explained in detail. First: direct perception of dharmata. When conceptual mind ceases, the senses don't stop functioning - they function as natural display of wisdom! But there's no grasping, no holding, no "I am experiencing this."
The second aspect: luminous clarity - not intellectual brightness but the natural radiance of awareness itself!
The third: unobstructed capacity - awareness flows freely without conceptually imposed limitations!
The fourth: non-conceptual self-recognition - rigpa knowing its own nature without any mediation of concepts!
Emaho! Measure-arrived vision reveals what was never hidden - your own face, finally seen directly!
[4920–4931]
Listen, friend! The Clear-Meaning says: all gathered in mind, inner self unmoving, abiding yet eye sees form—this mind is sense-born. But this is worldly direct perception, not the transcendent kind!
The direct perception meeting ultimate dharmata is awareness' essence existing in the heart. Like the sun and its rays—cause and effect certain—you meet this through faith in reasoning, not through ordinary senses. This transcends both worldling and transcendental realms. While worldly direct perception focuses on mind knowing objects, this is awareness direct perception—seeing the main point sealed within!
[4932–4941]
Now, four ways dharmata is named. Listen carefully! Samsara's dharmas versus nirvana's dharmata—this is dharmata. Appearances as dharmas versus emptiness as dharmata—this is dharmata. What lacks main point not liberating versus what exists certainly liberating—famous as dharmata. Dhatu as dharmas versus awareness as dharmata, both non-dual—this is it!
[4942–4953]
Direct perception is actually seen in sense-power's field without relying on intellect. However much you seek with intellectual wisdom, the time of finding never comes! The seeker lacks eyes—luminous clarity possesses no form. As the Collection says: "Wisdom investigates but finds not the bottom of aggregates." This luminous vision is not the form famous in terms—it cannot be destroyed by the four elements' harm. Form can be crushed, but this is not form!
Emaho! Direct perception beyond the senses!
[4954–4963]
Listen here, yogin! Three main points establish the base within: dharmata as inner field, gate of dawn, and wind's abiding. Through secret habituation, ripening signs, and ultimate exhaustion, you take the measure. The three kayas complete the fruit—therefore called "three," determined as four groups of three!
[4964–4971]
Or understand it this way: dharmata contains the three kayas spontaneously present. Their self-resonance dawns outward as three visions—dharmakaya's resonance as inner experience, awareness-emptiness; sambhogakaya's resonance as five lights outwardly clear, wisdom self-clear; nirmanakaya's resonance as dawn-liberation, limitless with discriminating awareness potency. Through three bases established, entities are non-different. Through three paths, obstacles cleared, no near or far in the path. Through three measures, measure delivered, no randomness or confusion. Through three fruits, delivered to exhaustion's end—no yes-no, no doubt. This is called direct perception!
[4972–4983]
In ordinary times, you see pleasure, displeasure, and equanimity—three appearances of pleasure, pain, and middle. When taking guru's instructions into experience, you directly see dhatu, awareness, and dharmas as three. Whatever appears is dharmata appearing. Whatever field it appears in is dhatu. However it appears is light, light-house, awareness, hanging-cord together. Through experiencing this vision, you buddha without seeing the fruit as stone—dharmata's self-exhaustion!
Emaho! The three that are simultaneously liberated!
[4984–5002]
Listen here, you who think Dzogchen has complex systems! Longchenpa quotes three tantras to show one essential point - and you might miss the simplicity!
From the Letterless Tantra: "Unborn direct perception—by buddhas, objectless pure vision seen." This isn't about some special ability only buddhas have! It's describing the natural capacity of mind itself - direct perception without mediation of concepts!
And from the Magical Display: "Jewel Wish-Fulfilling, Desire Glory, all buddhas' direct perception." Do you see? All these expressions point to the same thing - recognizing directly without any interference!
[5003–5015]
From the Jewel Mound Tantra: "Direct means seeing; three means three kayas; arriving certainly in the buddha-field." Listen carefully! "Arriving certainly" doesn't mean traveling somewhere - it's recognizing you're already there! The buddha-field isn't some distant pure land - it's your own awareness when free from conceptual veils!
"The purpose? Through this main point, you liberate without error or obstacle." The liberation Longchenpa speaks of isn't achieved through techniques - it's the natural result of recognizing what has always been true!
[5016–5021]
"As that same text says: 'Without dharmata direct perception's main point, like a blind person going to a cliff.'" Oh, how this shatters your spiritual seeking! You think direct perception is some advanced practice? Longchenpa says it's like a blind person accidentally finding the edge of a cliff - not through skill, but through accident!
This is revolutionary: When conceptual searching stops, direct perception happens naturally, without any special method! You don't need to "develop" it - you just need to stop blocking it with concepts!
Emaho! The main point is just seeing - and you've been seeing all along!
[5022–5035]
Listen here, you who wonder about the view of dharmata! Longchenpa explains something profound about how rigpa relates to phenomena - and you might get lost in philosophy!
"Dharmata not-objectified dharmata is not phenomena: Phenomena not dharmata is not Dzogchen." These lines destroy your intellectual tendency to make categories! Don't you see? Longchenpa is saying: When you try to define dharmata as objects, you're already wrong. When you call phenomena "dharmata," you're confusing levels!
"Dharmata not-objectified: Phenomena not dharmata's not-objectification: dharmata empty but phenomena not-empty - not Dzogchen." This is even more subtle! You might think "Dzogchen says phenomena don't exist." But that's nihilism! Longchenpa says dharmata is empty - but appearing phenomena aren't empty in the same way!
"Not-objectification" means don't reify appearances as things! They appear, but not as solid objects with independent existence.
[5036–5045]
Now listen to the crucial error: "Appearance-only ultimate: appearance-only ultimate, emptiness-only ultimate - not Dzogchen." This is exactly what philosophy does! It splits reality into two camps - appearance vs emptiness, eternalism vs nihilism. Longchenpa says this dualistic thinking misses the point entirely!
"Appearance-only ultimate: appearance-only ultimate" means treating appearances as ultimately real. "Emptiness-only ultimate" means treating emptiness as some separate truth. Both are conceptual boxes that Dzogchen transcends!
"Not-objectification: appearance and emptiness inseparable" - This is the revolutionary teaching! When you try to define either appearance or emptiness as ultimate, you miss their inseparability. Like trying to separate water from wetness!
Emaho! Stop philosophizing and just recognize the inseparability of appearance and emptiness!
[5060–5079]
Listen here, you who think meditation produces bliss! Longchenpa distinguishes between natural meditation and artificial meditation - and the distinction is life-changing!
"Direct perception's benefit: without this, even excellent qualities of view and meditation become bondage." Do you understand? When you lack direct perception, even good qualities become obstacles! You might have excellent concentration, brilliant understanding, but without directly seeing the nature of mind, these become chains binding you to subtle realms!
"The faults of not having direct perception are shown." What are these faults? Believing meditation achievement is progress, thinking view clarity comes from analysis, trusting philosophical understanding over direct recognition!
[5080–5095]
Now the crucial comparison: "But with it, gone and liberated—like the difference between rope and snake in dim light!" This is devastatingly precise! A rope can't free itself - it's still bound by its own nature. But a snake, though it moves in dimness, is naturally free!
"With direct perception, gone and liberated" - this is natural freedom. Awareness sees its own nature and recognizes there's nothing to be freed from!
"Without it, even excellent qualities become bondage" - The spiritual paradox! Excellent qualities without direct perception bind you more tightly than obvious flaws!
[5096–5111]
Now, transcendent knowledge-experience" - this isn't something you develop gradually! It's natural recognition that bypasses conceptual stages. Three experiences arise naturally when direct perception stabilizes: bliss, transformative, vision.
"First: binding body-speech main points, wind-mind relaxed, abiding in inner samadhi luminous-clear emptiness." These aren't techniques to master - they're the natural expression of awareness settling!
"Awareness vast, grasping-free bliss wide, anger-desire arisen without attachment grasping—this is natural meditation arrived at main point!" Listen carefully! The bliss isn't something you cultivate - it's what naturally arises when grasping ceases!
[5112–5135]
"Artificial meditation's bliss comes from changeable, coarse agitation or desire to sing-dance, becoming attachment." Oh, how Longchenpa exposes your spiritual materialism! You manufacture bliss through techniques, through agitation, through artistic expression - and it becomes attachment!
"But this bliss, though arisen as bliss, has the difference of awareness free from attachment obtaining freedom—know this as the difference between artificial meditation and natural wind-arrived meditation!" The crucial distinction: Artificial bliss binds you, natural awareness frees you!
Emaho! Stop cultivating and start recognizing what's already naturally present!
