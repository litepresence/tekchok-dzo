Fortunate one, pay attention! Common signs [13761-13800]: if limb and nail luster gone—nine months certain; person's eye film dissolving—five months likewise; death-lord Yama self-risen—twenty-one days death; nothing helps. If foot's sole protrudes outward—one month likewise.
If examining other's body [13801-13820]: person disease-struck, teeth's root gathering pus—nine days also die. Likewise various five days also die. Limbs repeatedly moving-contracting—seven days. Eyes bean-sprout looking—three days die. Eye joints greatly shaking—half month.
Cheek's vein broken [13821-13860]—likewise nineteen days. Person life's formation doing, breath layered rough—six months. Nose's nasika broken—seven days die. Eye varana broken—five days die. Left cheek flesh fallen—one day likewise die. Upper-lower teeth meeting—three days certainly.
Tongue black thigle arisen [13861-13880]—two days also die. Ear attached to head—that very night midnight. Chest's lheng-na destroyed—half month certainly. Sleep root gone—half month likewise.
Emaho!
Listen, you who seek truth! Third: reversal methods [13881-13910]—special fields gathering collections, elements' dependent connection wheel, deceiving demons with ransom—three reverse even exhausted life. Sun-Moon Union states: "Signs arisen in body, death-deceiving ritual explained. Person reversal action begun: own guru, sangha, gathering special field, pleasing with gifts and feasts, these rituals begun."
Elements' sounds balanced [13911-13940]—tala leaf, elements' five wheels, four calculations navel aureole included, earth-water-fire-wind-space wheels five made, colors distinguished by elements. Navel spokes five, each own five syllables, aureole ali's groups surrounding.
Thus wheels written [13941-13970], offering, praising, confession, each desired prayer. Navel elements' deity contemplated, syllable's number recited and stabilized. Then in kapala sealed, these wheels placed, five-colored cord swastika bound.
Wood, water, fire, earth [13971-14000], different types' breath, all mixed with meal and relics, form body one cubit. Five faculties' syllables written on paper, placed inside. This cures exhausted elements.
If demon-grasped [14001-14020], person's age-years past measure, color changed, own stains cloth-piece, likewise elements' substances, mixed with meal made form. Cotton, silk, feathers decorated, that form; harmonious torma likewise.
That form finally [14021-14040], person's age-years yoga around, blessed, these words spoken: "Take, take, powerful ones! Thirst, attachment, fixation, memory, grasping, thought, touch—release, pacify, liberate!" These words three times spoken.
Emaho!
Ah, precious disciple! Then in river's bed sent [14041-14060]—from death reversal, no doubt, Narag-kan.
Fourth: death-point appearances [14061-14080]—elements each dissolving, channel-wind disturbance signs: earth dissolving into earth sign—body heavy, unable to rise; water dissolving—mouth and nose's water flows out then dries; fire dissolving—body's edges' warmth departs, radiance and vitality withdraw; wind dissolving—layered breath arises, body's strength departs.
Sun-Moon Union [14081-14100]: "Earth into earth dissolving, likewise water, fire, wind, each self-dissolving, thus comes to person's body. Earth self-dissolving, body heavy, food not taken, rising and going strength all gone. Water into water dissolving, mouth-nose's water flows. Likewise fire into fire, mouth-nose very dry, body's edge warmth departs. Likewise wind into wind, breath rough rough, limbs shake, eyes also upward turn."
Fifth: crucial pointing-out instructions [14101-14120]—three: best, familiar space-awareness self-placed; middle, transference training; last, depending on other conditions.
First [14121-14140]: yogin alone dying, if non-separation in clear light's appearance, at that time also not depending on others, self-appearing clarity from that nature unwaveringly placed. Body key posture, three or cross-legged or lion's lying, rigpa space-awareness directed, dying—at that instant upward zangthal liberation, no dharmata bardo.
Sun-Moon Union [14141-14160]: "Then that fortunate person's appearance self-clear, non-dwelling awareness self-place." Lion-posture aggregates: rigpa directed at eyes, mind slightly sky-path made; if space-awareness not changing, that person without bardo becomes Buddha without doubt. Dying breath also becomes slow.
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate one! Space-awareness familiar ones [14161-14180], dying where snow or rock cave or without people, mind-distracting conditions not existing, crucial. Shantideva: "Dwellers nearby whoever, not grieving; this one Buddha-recollection, etc., no one becomes distracted."
Second: as before shown, transference crucial done [14181-14200]—wind consciousness entering, life-wind from heart's place moving time, this is the time. Rigpa from heart directed at own guru's kaya-colors, hi-gi sound seven or twenty-one to Brahma-opening thrown, ka-dag's ground instantly zangthal liberation.
Sun-Moon Union [14201-14220]: "Four winds gradually ceasing, great wind moving time; consciousness wind-mounted, wind trained; that above matured is crucial; rigpa gathering and throwing crucial; that too hi-gi throwing; that very guru's face meeting."
Rigpa's wisdom wind consciousness entering time [14221-14240], here transference, instructions here clearly pointed out. Sun-Moon Union: "Then guru's instructions, own mind familiarized; these meanings clearly point out."
Breath-transference time [14241-14260], entering object and place—transference; entering kaya and wisdom—space-awareness instruction. Two; also in space-awareness, familiar ones not depending on other conditions, and depending—two explained, thus instructions threefold.
Third: depending on other conditions [14261-14280]—that time guru or vajra sibling, samaya without wavering, clearly points out.
Emaho!
Fortunate child, understand! That also like present clear light carrier [14281-14300], bardo's clear light like that carrier, those two bridge-joined; space-awareness carrier similar appearance shown: "Son of family, this present clear light is self-arisen wisdom itself—without modifying mind, rest in this nature; upward zangthal you become Buddha."
Also [14301-14320]: "Look without changing this appearance; present clear light dharmata mother's clear light, all appearances buddha-fields dawning, mixed will become; that time recognize self-appearance; that time ka-dag ground you become Buddha."
There not recognizing [14321-14340], clear light lhundrub dissolving time, kaya and wisdom's appearance dawns; then four wisdoms' meeting appearance dawns; then lhundrub's eight doors dawning—you recognize self-appearance; self-recognized immediately ka-dag ground you well-go, three times spoken; oneself also that appearance equally placed, again there clear pointing.
That certainly liberates [14341-14360]. Sun-Moon Union: "If space-awareness unclear, dharmata bliss bardo, rigpa's appearance grasping, before shown lights mind-do; that obtains true appearance. If those unclear, own guru present, above instruction clearly point; no guru, vajra sibling, awareness's clear pointing do."
Thus instructions pointing [14361-14380], prolonged death or dharma-view disharmonious others, death-point with three jewel instructions benefit others shown: breath outer stopped, inner not stopped time, oneself momentary dharmata direct intention placed; then other person's breath separated, gap that mouth-nose three and own mouth-nose three joined.
Emaho!
Listen, you fortunate one! Wind upward going, three dum-bu [14381-14400]: outward first dum-bu white om contemplated, thrown; second red ah with thrown; last whatever not contemplated, thrown. Returning three all hum contemplated, that awareness blue hum own rigpa drawn.
Speech also hum [14401-14420] reciting, drawn to gap under foot, strongly drawn. That time own body-speech-mind three strengthened, drawn inside gap, his wind warm completely inside comes out—certain.
That time other person's eyes hri-gi comes [14421-14440]; then body also har rising able comes. Thus arisen, eye's thusness dharmata direct appearance shown; eyes arisen, thigle empty space lamp thumb-index showing, like placed, clear light self-existing this is; from body exiting time, dharmata bardo self-equipped dawning, self-appearance this is, not other—recognize self.
Three times struck [14441-14460], appearance seen or instruction heard, saying, voice emerging good; sign arisen also succeeded. Dharmata bardo non-conceptual samadhi obtained, becoming Buddha certain.
Sun-Moon Union [14461-14480]: "If benefiting others, that compassion mind-grasping, three doors door-opened, breath blocked, inhaled, thrown; three syllables entering, body-speech-mind strengthened, breath with skilled do. Thus repeatedly done, that person's appearance like this: if body's strength obtained, instructions strike; awareness clear, intention equally placed; faculties' doors self-near, eye's thusness look; equally abiding mind arisen, non-conceptual samadhi obtained."
This instruction [14481-14500] is crucial provision-striking, great perfection's crucial vital point. Thus faculties gathered, again death reversed by crucial, now not dead effort crucial!
Emaho!
Ah, precious disciple! Sixth: birth-place signs [14501-14520]—heat upward dissolving, best ka-dag, middle bardo, last nirmanakaya breath-giving certain; ordinary beings born in higher realms, breath-giving. Also: dying time eyes making film, sign-heat gathering, animal birth.
Right hand waving [14521-14540], heat gathering at crown—god. Words confused, heat gathering right armpit—asura. Left foot earth-pounding, heat gathering foot sole—hell. Body yellow, lusterless, heat gathering throat—preta. Words clear, memory not lost, heat gathering eyes—human birth.
Sun-Moon Union [14541-14580]: "Outer appearance like this: if heat upward dissolving, great breath-giving becomes; eyes unclear making film, lower realm places born; right hand waving, that person god-place; mouth words confused, asura likewise born; left foot earth-pounding, hell-place; body color yellow lusterless, preta-realm; mouth sentient-being voice speaking, animal-place; tongue stammering mouth meeting, likewise animal birth-place; words clear memory not lost, human-place."
Outer signs these [14581-14600], inner signs these joined: crown heat gathering, god-place; likewise foot sole heat gathering, hell-place; right armpit heat gathering, asura-realm; likewise throat heat gathering, preta-realm; likewise sign heat gathering, animal birth-place; eyes heat gathering, human birth.
Thus signs possessed [14601-14620]—certain, definite. These especially animals: sign heat gathering, mouth meeting, or mouth various animal voices speaking, or eyes film-appearance covered—outer-inner signs complete.
Emaho!
Listen, child of good lineage! Seventh: birth-place purification ritual [14621-14640]—three: death-point purification, corpse purification, subsequent purification.
First [14641-14660]: Sun-Moon Union, "A syllable's connection, breath and that number joined; if then not dead, crown mouth-directed, breath, awareness body's center also, a contemplated gathering do."
Thus ritual-possessed time [14661-14680]: that person's breath not separated, syllable breath with doubtless abiding purifying. Generally beings not seeing this Dharma's door, higher realms drawn, this method shown.
That person's heart inside [14681-14700] white light sphere egg-like contemplated, gradually upward-going contemplated, together with own also that consciousness thus contemplated; oneself also that consciousness thus contemplated, with that person's age-years wind outward going long and short joined, short time with vowel reciting.
Breath rough going time [14701-14720], that crown mouth-directed, a-a twenty-one spoken, wind phu-ru-ru comes, even evil one higher realm proceeds; intellectual view-meditation also dharmata proceeds.
If hell-birth signs [14721-14740], breath-separating time, that consciousness heart or navel a-contemplated, five lights fire burnt, own upper garment moment abiding, place upward proceeds.
Emaho!
Fortunate one, pay attention! Preta, animal, asura, god, humans also [14741-14760] upward proceed; human birth to liberation proceeds. Lower sufferings not experienced, higher happiness obtained—benefiting means ritual.
That too contemplation prolonged death [14761-14780], upward proceeds; complete as before. Second: corpse purification [14781-14800]—before corpse mandala two cubits etc. done, saffron etc. good scent sprinkled, eight-petaled lotus beautiful colors drawn, center jewel or stone if white earth transformed, vase mouth-ornament neck-ring dharani cord with, pure water vase-substances filled, four directions coral or madder a-four written.
Vase five lights' mansion contemplated [14801-14820], inside teacher Samantabhadra blue equipoise and with, yabyum's directions five families' buddhas; above guru lineage contemplated, instantly invited, stabilized; om ah hum svaha and a-hundred-thousand reciting.
Intervals om abhyagatakye [14821-14840]: "So-and-so's negativity and obscurations all shantim-kuru-ye svaha," saying; from dharani cord held, oneself Vajrasattva contemplated, light-rays embracing dharani cord going, guru and deity each kaya's part nectar descending, vase filling contemplated.
Offering and praising [14841-14860], knowing; finally a-a spoken, wisdom ones invited, samaya ones water-dissolved contemplated; vase that corpse's crown placed, a-lo age-number spoken; vase's water wisdom five's water-stream contemplated, with a washed, negativity purified contemplated—much a spoken, from hell's place proceeds.
Emaho!
Listen, you who seek liberation! Then vase throat held [14861-14880], bhy-lo age-number washing, from preta proceeds. Then vase secret-place held, rgya and wind's joining, from animals proceeds. Then vase right armpit held, kyem spoken washing, from asuras proceeds. Then vase crown held, tam spoken washing, from gods' place proceeds.
Then om ah hum svaha [14881-14900] spoken, vase heart held washing, human birth-place purified, precious human body drawn, that life liberation-fortune proceeds.
Thus three or five or seven days [14901-14920] done, aggregates burnt or transported, higher gods or liberation signs sky not arising impossible.
Sun-Moon Union [14921-14940]: "That itself dead time, that aggregates with outflows, vase crown placed, a syllable's essence and, wisdom water-stream purified, hell's places emptied, from that proceeds likewise. Preta signs possessed, bhye syllable's connection, breath with number seven; tongue's upper bhye placed, awareness essence that gathers; likewise vase mouth's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, preta places emptied, from that proceeds likewise."
Animal signs possessed [14941-14960], rgya syllable's connection, this one's place purifying; breath with nine times, sign rgya marked, awareness ones emptiness, repeatedly wind with thrown. Likewise vase sign's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, animal places emptied, from that proceeds likewise.
Emaho!
Ah, precious disciple! Who god signs arisen [14961-14980], tam syllable's connection, breath with number also; eleven with awareness trained; crown tam syllable contemplated; awareness outflowless eyes drawn; likewise vase crown's upper, wisdom water-stream purified, god's places emptied, that obtains human birth-place.
Asura signs possessed [14981-15000], kem syllable's connection, breath with twenty number; right armpit itself right also, kem syllable expert placed; awareness that gathers, breath with thrown; likewise vase armpit's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, asura places emptied, that proceeds likewise.
Who human signs [15001-15020], a syllable's connection, breath with gathered number; mouth's upper a syllable; awareness crown drawn, twenty-one; likewise vase mouth's upper, wisdom water-stream purified, human birth higher proceeds.
Third: subsequent purification [15021-15040]—explained before as consciousness transference, here similar. These rituals, though extensively taught in other tantras, here the great perfection's crucial points condensed—recognize thus.
All these bardo instructions [15041-15060] are the vital heart-essence of the path. Like a mother bird teaching her chicks to fly, these instructions guide the dying through the in-between. Do not take them lightly, fortunate one!
Practice these while alive [15061-15080]—then at death, recognition will arise spontaneously. Like a warrior who has trained with his weapon, when battle comes he acts without hesitation. Train now, liberate then!
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate one! Thus we have journeyed through the signs of the three times [15081-15100]—the path appearances, the maturation signs, the bardo instructions. All these are condensed from the sutras and tantras, the pith instructions of the victorious ones.
The four visions of thodgal [15101-15120]—direct crossing to the spontaneous presence of the dharmakaya. Like a mountain climber who finally sees the peak through the clouds, the practitioner sees the kayas directly. Not through gradual steps but direct perception!
Spontaneous liberation [15121-15140] means just this: without abandoning confusion, it is purified; without blocking thoughts, they cease; without training duality, it is resolved. Your own nature is primordially pure—like a lotus rising unstained from mud.
Dharmata nature [15141-15160] is not somewhere else. It is this very awareness reading these words, hearing these sounds, thinking these thoughts—yet free from grasping. Like the sky that holds all clouds yet is never touched by them.
The thigle expands [15161-15180], pervades, dissolves into itself. This is not annihilation but the great perfection—where ground, path, and result are inseparable. You have never been separate from the buddha-nature; you only forgot, like a rich man who dreams he is poor.
Now remembering [15181-15200], recognize! This is the crucial moment. Do not postpone liberation to some future life—seize it now, in this very breath, this very thought. The door is open; walk through!
Emaho!
Ah, precious disciple! We have arrived at the conclusion of this section on signs [15201-15220]—the marks of liberation, the indications of maturation, the portents of the path. Like a skilled physician reading the pulse, the wise practitioner reads these signs.
The four lamps shine [15221-15240]—the lamp of space, the lamp of thigle, the lamp of wisdom, the lamp of water. Each illuminates a facet of your true nature. Together they dispel the darkness of ignorance, revealing the primordial mandala that has always been present.
Thodgal's four visions [15241-15260]—dharmata appearing, experiences maturing, awareness reaching full measure, exhaustion of phenomena. Like the dawn progressing to full day, recognition deepens until all is light. This is not gradual cultivation but direct manifestation!
Spontaneous liberation [15261-15280]—the hallmark of the great perfection. Not achieved through effort but recognized through relaxation. Like ice naturally melting in spring sunshine, confusion dissolves when exposed to the warmth of awareness. No need to hammer at it!
The dharmata nature [15281-15300]—empty yet luminous, beyond existence and non-existence, transcending all conceptual extremes. Like a bird flying through the sky leaving no trace, the realized mind moves through phenomena without grasping or rejecting.
Thus the path is complete [15301-15320]—ground as recognition, path as maturation, result as spontaneous presence. All three are one taste in the great expanse. Rest in this, fortunate one, and let all efforts cease!
Emaho!
