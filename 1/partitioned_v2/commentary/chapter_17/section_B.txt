Listen here, you fortunate one! The text speaks of the signs that arise when you are close to complete liberation—like a traveler seeing the smoke of their destination village rising in the distance [1-5]. When you no longer wish to mingle with ordinary folk, when you feel you could soar through space, when the dissolution of appearances brings joy rather than fear—these are not ordinary experiences, you understand?
The root text says [10810-10814]: "Not wishing to associate with people"—this means you have naturally turned your mind away from samsaric chatter. Like a swan separating milk from water, you naturally gravitate toward solitude. Line 10814 speaks of having no attachment to body and life—you are like a beggar who has found a jewel in the rubbish heap; what need have you for the heap anymore?
Then comes the teaching on thigle, the bindus [10825-10845]. The text explains three types: the thigle of the body's channels, the thigle of the path, and the thigle of the final fruition. Think of it like this: the thigle in your channels is like the seed of a medicinal tree already planted in the soil. The path thigle is like the sap rising through the trunk. The fruition thigle is the fully ripened healing fruit!
Line 10832 speaks of the essence of thigle as "separate yet not separate, dwelling as one without duality." You must understand this directly, not merely as intellectual understanding. When you gaze at the sky and sky-gaze gazes back—this is the nature of thigle, beyond one and many.
The path thigle [10850-10853] is moved by the wisdom wind through the channels—like water flowing naturally downhill without being pushed. You don't need to force it! The four lamps shine upon their objects naturally, like the sun illuminating the valley without choosing which flowers to touch.
Line 10843 tells us of the five wisdom thigles dwelling unmoving in the central channel—this is your true nature, always present, like butter already in milk. You don't need to add anything or go anywhere!
Meditate on this, fortunate disciple. These signs and thigles are not fantasies but the natural display of your own rigpa when it matures. Like a lion who has no fear of the snare because he knows his strength, when these signs arise, know that liberation is certain.
Emaho!
Ah, precious one, listen well! Here we come to the essence of the path thigle—six aspects that illuminate the nature of mind like the sun dispelling darkness [10855-10860].
The root text [10855] speaks of the "unfabricated, all-pervading dharmata thigle." You must understand: this is not something you create through effort, like a potter shaping clay. It is already present, like the sky that needs no painting to be blue! When you rest without fabrication, this thigle naturally dawns.
Line 10856 describes Samantabhadra's thigle that appears without good or bad, large or small. Think of a clear mirror—it reflects a beautiful face or an ugly one without preference or judgment. Your awareness is exactly like this! It does not discriminate between pure and impure appearances; all are equally the play of dharmata.
The dharmadhatu thigle of line 10857 is clarity without inside or outside. Have you ever looked at the ocean on a calm day? The water and sky meet without a clear boundary. So it is with the dharmadhatu—where is the division between your mind and the universe? There is none!
Line 10858 speaks of the thigle of pure dharmadhatu, free from extremes and partiality. Like a bird flying through the sky leaving no trace, the pure dharmadhatu leaves no mark of going or staying, coming or going. It is beyond all conceptual pigeonholes!
The great wisdom thigle of line 10860—"unfabricated from the beginning, appearing directly unobscured by any affliction"—this is your true face! Afflictions are like clouds in the sky; they never truly touch or taint the sky's nature. Similarly, anger, desire, and ignorance never truly obscure your innate wisdom.
Then the text turns to the signs of maturation. Line 10877 speaks of external signs: "From the burning relics, the thigle becomes a sphere." When a realized master passes, sometimes the body transforms into light, leaving only relics—round, like bindus. This is not magic, you understand? It is the natural result of having recognized and stabilized the nature of mind.
Line 10882 says: "All these are signs of your own experience." Do not look outside for confirmation! When you recognize rigpa, you know it yourself, like tasting honey—you don't need someone else to tell you it is sweet.
The text warns [10884-10891]: "The mind does not engage with others even for an instant." This does not mean becoming cold or indifferent! It means your mind is so content in its own nature that it does not grasp at external distractions. Like a mountain hermit who has found inner peace, you are complete within yourself.
The final lines [10892-10899] promise: even in two years, if you know the measure of rigpa, you will dwell inseparable from the self-appearance of dharmadhatu and awareness. This is not mere philosophy! It is the living experience of ground, path, and fruition as one.
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate disciple! Now we arrive at the section on the kayas—the Buddha bodies [10900-10908]. Like a master jeweler examining precious gems, we must understand the nature of these manifestations.
The root text [10906] says the essence is "the abiding nature as the support of all phenomena beyond sorrow." You must realize: these kayas are not statues in a temple, remote and separate from you! They are your own nature displaying itself. Like fire that is both heat and light inseparable, the kayas are the natural expression of dharmata.
Line 10908 gives the etymology: "stainless self-perfect great zangthal." Zangthal means unobstructed, penetrating everywhere! Think of sunlight streaming through a window—it fills the room completely, leaving no corner dark. So does the stainless nature penetrate all phenomena.
The text distinguishes the three kayas [10910-10912]: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya. But listen carefully! In the Great Perfection, these are not merely results to be attained later—they are the path's own appearances. Like a dreamer who realizes he is dreaming, the dream becomes the path to awakening.
Line 10914 explains: "According to this Great Perfection system, the three kayas are considered as path appearances." This is profound! The very appearances you see right now—if recognized—are the kayas. Your ordinary perception is actually the three kayas in disguise, like a poor man who does not know he wears a jewel in his hair.
Line 10916 clarifies: "Dharmakaya is self-appearance." Whatever dharmas exist, as long as mind exists to perceive them, this is the path. As long as kayas exist, as long as body exists—these are path appearances, not the final ultimate. Do not mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself!
When the essence of practice matures and reaches its measure [10919-10923], we arrive at "the appearance of exhaustion"—approaching dissolution into kadag. Like ice melting back into water, all appearances naturally return to their source.
Line 10926 speaks of Lhungrub's appearances: "From the appearance of spontaneous presence, kayas, pure lands, and teachers appear." This is not creation from nothing! It is like reflections in a mirror—the mirror does not create the reflections, yet they clearly appear.
The signs of having accomplished the kayas are then described [10935-10967]: "Whoever has reached the measure of the kayas—to that fortunate being, these signs appear." When Chokyi Kaya is practiced, others cannot see the body; the yogin plays freely within himself. This is not mere invisibility—it is that the yogin's body has become indivisible from space itself!
Emaho!
Ah, you who seek liberation! The signs of sambhogakaya ripeness [10968-11017] manifest as powers: flying through space, passing through mountains, diving under earth, floating on water without sinking. But listen—if you lack confidence in the inseparability of space and awareness, these become mere sorcery!
The nirmanakaya signs [11018-11025] are even more amazing—spontaneous teachings flowing from your mouth, understanding texts you never studied, speaking words of Dharma that accord with beings' capacities. This is truly the lion's roar of speech!
See the bodily signs [11026-11043]: strength surpassing youth, grey hair turning black, wrinkles smoothing like a field after rain. And compassion [11044-11057]—previously absent, now arising from the depths for beings' welfare, willing to give body and limbs.
When these arise, you have touched the nirmanakaya. This is not mere imagination—it is your own nature manifesting! Like a lamp whose flame naturally rises upward, these signs arise naturally from recognition of your true face.
The text warns [11058-11077]: one who possesses these signs but lacks confidence in dharmadhatu and rigpa—the elements will self-exhaust but this is not true liberation. Do not be like a merchant who displays his goods but has no wealth!
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate one! When you possess these nirmanakaya signs and desire to benefit beings, you take miraculous birth in the nirmanakaya realms [11026-11041]—dwelling sixty-eight thousand years for others' benefit, then manifesting in countless world-systems, all while absorbed in ka-dag.
You may wonder [11042-11056] about the five hundred years of self-benefit—there is no contradiction! For self-benefit one may dwell five hundred years; for others' benefit, countless aeons. Both are possible without conflict. Like a tree that grows for centuries yet gives shade immediately, time is not an obstacle for the realized.
Like water dissolving into water, like butter into butter, like space into space [11047-11056]—so your own nature dissolves into itself without any grasping at essence. This is not annihilation; it is spontaneous liberation! The waves return to the ocean; the rays return to the sun.
The inner awareness signs [11057-11074] are: bliss, non-attachment to worldly concerns, all appearances shining as light, seeing kayas in light without cessation, body at ease without grasping, mind one-pointed, awareness naturally relaxed, unfabricated meditation arising in your being.
This is your inheritance, fortunate child! Not something to be achieved from outside, but your own nature recognizing itself. Like a prince who discovers he has been wearing the crown all along, the realization dawns that you were never separate from the three kayas.
Emaho!
Ah, listen well! The text now reveals rigpa—your own awareness [11075-11087]. Like a vajra chain, awareness appears as your own appearing. Through the guru's pith instructions, previously unrecognized awareness becomes recognized.
Threefold rigpa [11088-11096]: base-establishing rigpa is the natural state beyond good and bad; path-appearing rigpa goes by various names—mind-nature, unborn, co-emergent wisdom, beyond intellect, dharmakaya; lhaktong rigpa sees the vajra chain's kaya directly, free from conceptual investigation.
The character [11097-11103] is this: naturally clear, naked, spontaneously perfected—just this! The result is liberation into ka-dag's spontaneity through practicing just this. Not practicing something else, not going somewhere else—resting in what is already present!
See the signs [11104-11124]: wherever you direct attention, awareness enters there; body follows like a shadow; you can transform others' faith; conceptual fixation ceases. One who recognizes this directly dwells in the self-liberated ground. Like a garuda circling higher with each wing-beat, recognition deepens naturally.
The text quotes [11125-11135]: "Body light and spontaneously clear, touching earth without obstruction, speech's power perfected, words exhausted of elaboration, mind able to transfer consciousness." These are not fairy tales! They are the natural display when rigpa matures.
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate child! From such practice [11136-11143] arise these signs and measures: body light and spontaneously clear, touching earth without obstruction, speech's power perfected, words exhausted of elaboration, mind able to transfer consciousness.
The five senses [11144-11161] dissolve into their natureless state—this is the measure! Now the text distinguishes signs more precisely [11162-11182]: outer body signs, inner awareness signs, and how they combine.
When you are truly confident in ka-dag's realization, no more births in samsara! Signs: body without parasites, hair and nails not growing. Then after three months, others see you in five-colored light, kayas of the five families rising into space and dissolving.
This [11183-11231] is the great fortunate one reaching exhaustion! Different combinations of signs lead to different liberations—in the bardo, as a nirmanakaya, or directly. Know these distinctions well! Like different streams flowing into the same ocean, all paths of recognition lead to buddhahood, yet the manner of arrival varies.
The supreme bodhisattva [11212-11231] holds beings with compassion, remaining for hundreds of thousands of years in a single human body to perfect benefit for others. This is the great play of spontaneous presence!
Emaho!
Ah, listen! Signs are mere indications, not guarantees [11232-11244]. Having signs does not mean liberation; liberation always has signs. Do not be deceived by ordinary spiritual attainments or gradual paths of shravakas and pratyekabuddhas—these are different grounds without the great pure result.
One with complete body and speech signs [11245-11264] dwells on the great sameness ground, then manifests for others' benefit for countless aeons in a single human body, perfecting enlightenment without intermediate births.
Body and mind signs together [11265-11278] bring swift self-liberation; speech and mind signs bring rainbow body in ten years; all three signs complete bring Buddhahood in two years! Like a mighty river that gathers tributaries, combined signs create a torrent of realization.
But listen [11279-11291]—without distinguished outer and inner signs, mere signs are uncertain. Do not deceive yourself claiming Dzogchen view while lacking genuine confidence in the natural state! A clay pot painted gold is still clay inside.
The text warns [11292-11310]: one who claims confidence without signs is merely intellectualizing. Such a person wanders long in samsara. But for thodgal practitioners who truly mature space and awareness, these signs arise inevitably.
Emaho!
Fortunate one, pay attention! One without signs who claims confidence in self-appearing nature [11274-11283]—this is mere intellectual view and meditation. Such a person cannot liberate and will remain long in samsara.
But for thodgal practitioners [11284-11291], these signs arise as certain liberation without deception. Therefore exert special effort! One who matures space and awareness—how could these signs not arise? Apply yourself diligently!
Now the text summarizes [11292-11310] signs of liberation and buddhahood versus signs of taking rebirth through the six realms' confusion. Two aspects: brief presentation and extensive explanation.
The brief [11311-11337]: even if dharmata is realized directly, without sufficient effort one may not reach measure. When the material body separates, without taking further existence, one is liberated from contaminants. The signs: body relics, self-arisen images, great light and sound display, manifest buddhahood!
This is the Great Perfection's unique path—recognition in this life, liberation in this life! Like finding a wish-fulfilling jewel in your own pocket, you discover you possessed the treasure all along.
Emaho!
Listen! In Dzogchen there are two buddhahood modes [11318-11337]: manifest complete buddhahood with signs, light, and material remains; and true complete buddhahood without aggregates' remainder through pure effort.
From the Vajrasattva Mirror Tantra [11338-11411]: these signs—light, sound, relics, kayas, earth-shaking and so forth—manifest for the one achieving manifest buddhahood. This is not ordinary; it is your own nature displaying its power!
The extensive explanation [11412-11425] covers five topics: kayas, relics, light, sound, and earth-shaking. The kaya's essence [11426-11443] is divine appearance—full kayas, half-kayas, father-mother forms, spheres, great mandalas, stupas, wheels, vajras, jewels, lotuses, and more.
From generation and completion practice [11444-11471], seed syllables, attributes, half-forms appear gradually; full forms appear as couples, spheres, mandalas. Peaceful and wrathful kayas [11472-11482] both manifest—peaceful cannot emanate; wrathful possesses the power to manifest!
The result [11483-11498] is liberation according to sequence: when both peaceful and wrathful arise, consciousness dissolves into space and dharmakaya's self-radiance dawns—liberation without bardo, included in this life's liberation!
Emaho!
Ah, precious disciple! When peaceful kaya arises [11443-11486], appearances cease and clear light's self-appearance dawns; within five samadhi days one is liberated. When wrathful kaya arises [11487-11505], from the eyes Vajrasattva's nose-thread appears, sound-light-ray three self-appear, and liberation comes in five moments!
The text quotes extensively [11506-11526]: "If both arise, without bardo one becomes Buddha." This is the measure of confidence in great ka-dag! Whether through five days or five moments, recognition is the key—not the duration but the depth of seeing.
Peaceful kaya's arising [11527-11540] connects through clear light to ka-dag, so spontaneous presence's emanation does not arise from bardo. But wrathful kaya [11541-11571]—through sound-light-ray self-appearing—allows emanation after twenty-one samadhi days.
This distinction [11572-11597] is profound: peaceful dissolves completely into ka-dag; wrathful maintains the basis for emanation. Like a lamp extinguished versus a lamp covered, the result differs though both are light.
The place [11598-11613] is the crucial point of difficult Döndam Wangchuk's great secret seal—understand this well! Not even skilled teachers should speak of it casually; recognize it as my blessing.
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate one! The text now explains relics extensively [11437-11476]—the common distinctions, specific distinctions, and the difference between relics and ringsel.
Generally, all beings are buddhas from the beginning [11477-11505]—the five elements in their nature, the five kayas' essence. Unmatured relics exist potentially; through practice they mature into five types: shariram (bone essence), chariram (flesh), churiram (blood), beriram (body), nyariram (karma). These are not ordinary remains—they are wisdom essence manifesting!
From the Blazing Relics Tantra [11506-11536]: "The supreme being who passes beyond sorrow—relics of all buddhas arise. From distinctions of buddha families, relics arise five by five." This is your potential made manifest!
The specific distinctions [11537-11571] explain colors: blue-black Vajra family, white Buddha family, yellow Ratna, red Padma, green Karma. These indicate the pure realm of liberation—Vajrasattva's realm for blue, Vairochana's for white, and so forth.
Shariram [11572-11586] is the size of a mustard seed, white and radiant—like a tiny sun containing infinite light. This is bone's essence purified, appearing when the channels' wind has matured the dharmakaya nature.
Emaho!
Ah, listen carefully! The five relics' characteristics [11527-11556] are beautifully described: shariram white and radiant, chariram dark blue, churiram yellow, beriram red, nyariram green—all round and smooth like sesame seeds, containing fivefold light at their core.
From the Blazing Relics [11557-11570]: peaceful relics liberate into self-appearing certainty of their respective families; wrathful relics achieve dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, effective enlightenment kaya, and unchanging vajra kaya. Five relics, five kayas—inseparable!
The text quotes [11571-11586]: "Shariram achieves unborn, churiram achieves effective, chariram achieves sambhogakaya, nyariram achieves nirmanakaya, pancharam achieves vajra nature." This is not mere poetry—it is the direct correlation between practice and result!
Ringsel [11587-11613] differs from relics—they are similar but ringsel can be destroyed by elements, while relics cannot. Ringsel are like the husk; relics are like the seed. Both indicate liberation, but relics are indestructible, like a diamond that survives the fire that burns the mountain.
The locations [11614-11644] where they arise: shariram from the crown, chariram from between the ribs, churiram from above the liver, beriram from the kidneys, nyariram from above the lungs. Each location corresponds to an element's purification.
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate child! Light's nature is five-colored self-clarity [11619-11621]—arising from pure elements meeting practiced awareness's self-radiance. It manifests as three types: upward-reaching, radiating spokes, and surrounding aureole.
Or [11625-11635]: like a ladder reaching to the sky, or like a dome of light appearing in space's center. The result: if aureole appears, liberation in first bardo; if reaching upward, dissolution into ka-dag without bardo; if radiating spokes, enlightenment in final bardo's time.
The Vajrasattva Mirror teaches [11636-11641]: "Light appearing like a house—five days to stability, manifest buddhahood. Light like a ladder—seven days to manifest buddhahood." The duration indicates the depth of recognition.
The Blazing Relics states [11642-11655]: "Light has three aspects—surrounding aureole with circumference from whose trail it arises: this achieves certainty in first bardo. If reaching upward, without bardo, instantly Buddha. If radiating from spokes, in final bardo finds manifest enlightenment."
When lhundrub appears [11656-11667], emanations spread to benefit beings everywhere. This is the great play—recognizing your own nature, then naturally benefiting others without effort, like a lamp that illuminates simply by being lit.
Emaho!
Ah, you who seek truth! Sound's nature [11669-11682]—what the ear faculty hears. Distinctions: unpleasant, pleasant, and middling, but here the peaceful dharma-sound (long, slow, continuous) and wrathful thunder-sound (short, fierce)—called ur and thug.
Causes [11678-11682]: general cause is elemental; here arising from stability attainment. Result: sambhogakaya and emanating nirmanakaya. The peaceful sound [11683-11693] brings stability in seven samadhi days from peaceful kaya; wrathful sound brings liberation to wrathful kaya.
The five families [11694-11715] determine direction: from the east Vajra family, south Ratna, west Padma, north Karma, above Tathagata. Listen for the sound's direction when the yogin passes—it reveals the family of buddhahood!
The text quotes [11716-11719]: "From ur arises in seven days, from thug in fourteen days manifest buddhahood." Duration indicates intensity of recognition—fierce recognition, swift result!
Sound is not mere vibration [11720-11735]—it is the dharmata's voice, your own nature declaring itself. Like an echo that reveals the presence of a canyon, sound reveals the depth of realization. Those who hear with recognition are liberated upon hearing; those who hear without recognition merely accumulate causes.
Emaho!
Listen well! Earth-shaking's essence [11721-11725]—the container world's foundation, support of sentient beings. Cause: the passing being's power moving wind. Distinctions: great shaking, greater shaking, completely great shaking, and universal great shaking—four types.
The result [11726-11747]: ordinary beings achieve bodhisattva grounds and so forth. When breath separates, if it shakes in the center, shravaka's ground of white appearance attained, then abiding in seven trainings. This includes eight lower grounds: rigs, eighth, seeing, thinning, done knowing, shravaka, pratyekabuddha.
Three days after death [11748-11758], if east shakes—pratyekabuddha ground. Six days, south—bodhisattva grounds: joy, stainless, light-maker, light-radiating, difficult to purify, manifest, far-going, immovable, excellent intelligence, dharma cloud—these ten cause grounds plus universal light result ground, eleven total.
Nine days [11759-11763], upward shaking—vidyadhara ground: maturation ground, life-control ground, great seal ground, spontaneously accomplished ground—four. These are not ordinary places! They are recognition's stages made manifest.
The text warns [11764-11793]: merely reaching these grounds quickly is insufficient; one must complete their full training. Like a traveler who reaches a city's gate but must still enter and explore, reaching is not completion.
Emaho!
Fortunate one, understand this! Earth-shaking signs [11794-11822] indicate the six realms' rebirth when liberation is not achieved. Two paths exist: dharmata bardo and samsara bardo—without these, no path exists. Results: buddha or sentient being—no other destination.
The five paths to buddhahood [11823-11842]: accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, completion. Samsara's confused paths [11843-11857]: dream path, habitual path, karma's end path, uncertain illusion path, uncertain cause-result path. Know these well!
Hell-realm signs [11858-11881]: at death, dark clouds gathering like smoke, rain, steam, great wind, hail, falling dust. These indicate the eight hot hells, eight cold hells, neighboring, sentient-being hell, vajra hell—seven destinations of intense suffering.
The Avatamsaka Sutra [11882-11900] teaches: rejecting Dharma leads to Avici hell, lasting an entire kalpa, suffering immeasurable. Even when the great fire kalpa burns, you remain—such is the result of abandoning the holy Dharma!
For tantric practitioners [11901-11913], violating vajra guru samaya leads to Vajra Hell—lasting until the ocean is emptied by hair-strands, kalpas as numerous as ocean drops. Do not take samaya lightly!
Emaho!
Listen, child of the lineage! Preta-realm signs [11914-11928]: at death, unclear sky with fading light like western sunset, dead sun and moon, yellow clouds covering them, rain falling with subsequent cold, evening rain. These indicate external, internal, sudden, distinctive, inverted, karmic, and enjoyment-obscured preta realms.
Animal-realm signs [11929-11935]: at death-transfer, dark and hazy sky without warmth, covered by dark clouds, valley blue with smoke appearance, hazy unpleasant sky. This leads to animals with many legs, no legs, four legs, winged, scaled—countless varieties.
Asura-realm signs [11936-11950]: fierce wind rising from all directions, terrifying dark red cloud-forms appearing, clouds swirling violently with thunder roaring and lightning flashing, sun and moon obscured. Five asura types: five-cornered, six-faced, long-armed, big-bellied, sky-going with matted hair.
God-realm signs [11951-11963]: at breath-separation, clear pure sky with bright sun and moon, no wind or dust, directions beautiful and joyful. This leads to six desire-god families, five pure abode gods, fifteen clear light birth-places, four limitless perception entrances.
Human-realm signs [11964-11984]: clear sky without dust, gentle white clouds stretching like silk, sun and moon with rainbow light surrounding—indicating precious human birth in the three higher realms.
Emaho!
Ah, listen well! These are general arrangements [11985-12008], but specific exceptions exist. Bad signs—wind, hail, etc.—may be sent by non-human wrathful ones or appear when evil beings die. Good signs—rainbows, clear sky—may appear when good beings die or attain concentrations.
The key [12009-12034]: these signs arise from the dying person's own mind. If they lived well and good signs appear, this is appropriate; if they lived badly but good signs appear, it is others' signs affecting them—like finding a rainbow when seeking profit, called "meeting rainbow's meaning."
The Blazing Relics Tantra [12035-12075] teaches extensively: black sky, rain, steam, wind, hail, dust all indicate hell-realm birth. Yellow fading light, dead sun and moon indicate preta. Dark hazy sky indicates animals. Fierce wind and terrifying clouds indicate asuras. Clear sky with bright luminaries indicates gods. Clear sky with gentle clouds indicates humans.
These signs [12076-12091] arrive two or three days before birth in that realm. Without signs, where one takes rebirth is known through their own karma—death-time visions of hell-fire, hunger-thirst fears, confused awareness, or visions of previous human realms, mountains, oceans, god-palaces, gardens, or dawn-like appearances.
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate one! From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle [11992-12010]: these various signs of the three times are definitively established. Thus the general topics of instructions, effort, and sharp faculties for liberation in this life with signs have been taught.
Now for middling practitioners [12011-12035], extensive establishment of bardo's manifest complete buddhahood is taught. Two aspects: general bardo arrangement and specific natures extensively explained.
Bardo's essence [12036-12050]: external phenomena appearing to internal mind's moment. All appearances from inner dharmadhatu ka-dag elsewhere are bardo's state—ka-dag's display as kayas and wisdoms is pure dharmata bardo; confused appearances of six realms are impure confusion bardo.
Where do pure and impure exist [12051-12070]? Between ka-dag's space and emergence, returning to ka-dag must occur, so between ka-dag's nature. From the beginning in first ka-dag [12071-12085], confusion's basis is inexpressible; non-confusion likewise. This point, if wisdom exists, is the great crucial seal.
Bardo's etymology [12086-12100]: "bar" means between above-below, before-after; "do" means holding extremes together like a connecting cord—like a pillar's middle binding cord.
Emaho!
Ah, precious disciple! Bardo distinctions [12101-12120]: common and uncommon. Some common vehicles consider birth-death bardo, dream bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo, etc. But uncommon Secret Mantra King here distinguishes: nature-abiding bardo, death-point bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo—four.
Appearances' modes [12121-12150]: for three realms generally, afflictions manifest as grasping-fixation. For six realms specifically: gods see nectar in water, humans see water, pretas see pus—one substance, different minds. From Two Truths: "Mind differs, therefore single entity appears as unrealized."
Individual persons [12151-12160]—one person seen as enemy and friend by different people; happiness-suffering, confusion-non-confusion, attachment-aversion, good-bad, dharma-undharma all appear variously. Future karma's good-bad operates through diverse cause-effect.
In short [12161-12180]: whatever appears to anyone is like good-bad various dreams—though appearing, unestablished, they appear in empty clarity. Nature-abiding bardo's appearance [12181-12200]: five aggregates' bondage obscures five kayas' appearance; elements and sense-bases obscure light and color; karma and afflictions obscure wisdom and dharmata.
This is [12201-12220] the four reversals' difficult-to-cross river whirlpool, day-night circling in various karma and habitual patterns.
Emaho!
