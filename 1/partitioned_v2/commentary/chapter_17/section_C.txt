Ah, precious disciple! Bardo distinctions [12101-12120]: common and uncommon. Some common vehicles consider birth-death bardo, dream bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo, etc. But uncommon Secret Mantra King here distinguishes: nature-abiding bardo, death-point bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo—four.
Appearances' modes [12121-12150]: for three realms generally, afflictions manifest as grasping-fixation. For six realms specifically: gods see nectar in water, humans see water, pretas see pus—one substance, different minds. From Two Truths: "Mind differs, therefore single entity appears as unrealized."
Individual persons [12151-12160]—one person seen as enemy and friend by different people; happiness-suffering, confusion-non-confusion, attachment-aversion, good-bad, dharma-undharma all appear variously. Future karma's good-bad operates through diverse cause-effect.
In short [12161-12180]: whatever appears to anyone is like good-bad various dreams—though appearing, unestablished, they appear in empty clarity. Nature-abiding bardo's appearance [12181-12200]: five aggregates' bondage obscures five kayas' appearance; elements and sense-bases obscure light and color; karma and afflictions obscure wisdom and dharmata.
This is [12201-12220] the four reversals' difficult-to-cross river whirlpool, day-night circling in various karma and habitual patterns.
Emaho!
Listen well! Death-point bardo's appearance [12221-12240]: body's elements disturbed, experiencing outer body's suffering; mental events' path lost, experiencing inner mind's suffering; habitual grasping's dam burst, experiencing this life's appearance's separation though attached; remembering non-virtuous deeds, fearing fall into lower realms.
Grasping-fixation's attachment [12241-12260] remembers cherished supported body, fearing the collapse of the aggregates' fortress—who experiences this? One parted from bempo rig, dwelling in the suffering of fearing death.
Dharmata bardo's appearance [12261-12280]: aggregates' self-grasping support abandoned, kaya and wisdom's dharmata appears directly; karma and habitual patterns' connection severed, nature's samadhi dharmata is enjoyed; faculties' grasping objects emptied, self-appearing clear light dharmata is practiced.
Samsara bardo's appearance [12281-12295]: outer body's samsara, mental body with complete faculties moving without obstruction; inner mind's samsara, various thoughts moving and engaging; body-mind gathered samsara, moving without obstruction to all except two supports.
Two supports [12296-12310]: vajra seat accomplished through blessing, and mother's womb. Scholars generally identify the vajra seat as India, but here it is ka-dag's unchanging inner space, excellent place where all buddhas awaken, pure nirvana's door. Mother's womb is impure samsara's door, any of six realms' birth-places—not literal words.
Emaho!
Fortunate child, understand! General sutra places [12311-12340] have two truths, two intentions—four modes. Tantra sections have literal and non-literal—six limits to be known.
The Thalgyur states [12341-12361]: "Bardo's appearance: nature-abiding aggregates, elements, afflictions as objects; death-point like bubbles floating, awareness not abiding one-pointedly. Dharmata bardo with kayas and wisdoms, light and color; thigle, elements' appearances—as whatever appears, dharmata's mansion."
Samsara's appearance [12362-12378]: various flashing, flickering like dream appearances—true appearance, false mind's object. Six families' lights: white, blue, yellow, red, green, multicolored—each realm's objects appearing.
Bardo boundaries [12379-12400]: nature-abiding from leaving mother's womb until final death-sickness strikes; death-point from breath not yet ceased until inner breath stops; dharmata from inner breath stopped until clear light dawns and lhundrub appears; samsara from lhundrub ceasing and flickering dream-like appearance until entering mother's womb.
This [12401-12413] is called "instruction for provisions when meeting the traveler"—provisions given to the traveler setting out on the death-journey, crucial instructions for the death-point's pain and various appearances.
Emaho!
Listen, you fortunate one! Now specific instructions for each bardo [12414-12440]: nature-abiding bardo—entering the nest like a bird certain the hunter won't harm; death-point bardo—clearing the unclear like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror; dharmata bardo—confidence in self-appearing like meeting a familiar person or a child entering mother's lap; samsara bardo—guiding continuation like putting a stake in a narrow crack.
First [12441-12460]: like a bird checking if the hunter has left before entering its nest, without harm, established without need to eliminate elaborations, without doubt or obstruction—you too first desire liberation from samsara, examine which method is profound, which crucial point great. Whatever Dharma you have confidence in, do not reach final limit, doubt-enter, or not arrive at goal—abandon these three.
First hearing trains mind [12461-12470]; middle thinking decides; finally meditation practices—like building a nest comfortable, like entering without fear of danger or anxiety.
These extensively taught before; here briefly summarized [12471-12495]: looking at outer appearances, seeing objects like illusory deception—baseless empty self-form only. Though various phenomena appear, they are view-meditation-conduct's mirror, dharmata's play unceasingly appearing.
Like looking at a single poppy's stem [12496-12515]—white, red, various colors—all are your own mind's empty play. Seeing thus, appearances are liberated where they appear, confusion baselessly liberated, illusion's peak only appearing, liberated from outer objects' grasping samsara.
Emaho!
Ah, listen with full attention! Looking at the perceiver [12516-12535]: moving-empty beyond partiality, har-sang without clarity, self-clear recognizing—great dharmata beyond arising-abiding-ceasing is recognized. Grasping without support, sky-like nature, self-liberated vastness.
Without support, ye-re! Spontaneous, zangthal! Without truth, bun-ne! Beyond root, khre-se! In great dharmata's equal nature, smile with joy, gle-ge! Resting thus, inner grasping mind's stake is extracted—this has purpose!
When object-mind are recognized baseless rootless [12536-12560]: secret self-awareness free from grasping-fixation elaboration goes. Rigpa self-clear ka-dag great, guru's instruction introduces, four lamps cause space-awareness non-separation, clear light nature meditating.
Outer space's appearing self-radiance's five lights clear [12561-12580]—like mirror's reflections, appearing externally but essence internally dwelling. Appearance-emptiness like moon in water—know thus! Do not attachment-grasp to appearances.
Looking at outer appearance's clear light [12581-12600]: inner rigpa's clear light is clear back. Rigpa free from meditation-concept's antidote, vast view of natural clarity; resting in natural presence's clear meditation; clear light conduct without accepting-rejecting; ka-dag self-clear result found.
Without abandoning confused appearance, it is abandoned; without blocking confused thought, it ceases; without training duality, it is purified; faults without abandoning are pure from ka; qualities without seeking are spontaneously accomplished.
Emaho!
Listen, child of good lineage! Three realms completely liberated's meaning [12601-12620]: view beyond view's object, meditation beyond meditation's mind, conduct beyond conduct's calculation, result beyond result's phenomena. Samsara expelling's fortune, dharmata manifest appearance's pure land wide, joy's source good country, nine desires' self-arising palace found.
Original protector King Unchanging Light [12621-12640] and five lights' spontaneous presence queen gathered, supreme boy light inconceivable meeting his own parents—this is called the time of joy-bliss inseparable's eternal fortune.
These extensively taught before [12641-12660]; now specifically: Sun and Moon Union states, "Listen Sugata! These are all included, obtaining one abiding thigle." What is that? Placing various, self-arrived; intentions show timing; exhaustion shows intention; stable confidence non-reversing signs.
Thus matters are included [12661-12680]: space's lamp who sees directly practices dharmadhatu; thigle's lamp who sees obtains support of all with effort; wisdom's lamp who sees realizes general and specific characteristics; water's lamp who sees obtains power over faculties.
Who matures vajra chain [12681-12700]: rigpa arrives at the capital. The result: these three kayas are self-awareness's ground. Nature-abiding bardo who matures these, all elements self-exhaust, changing without doubt.
Emaho!
Fortunate disciple, now death-point bardo instructions [12701-12720]—clearing unclear like a beautiful woman mirror-looking—eight aspects: certain death causes with examples, death signs investigation, reversal methods, death-point appearances, crucial pointing-out instructions, birth-place signs, purification rituals, uncommon other places.
First [12721-12750]: difficult to obtain Jambudvipa as Dharma-practicing place, obtained; difficult to obtain leisure and endowments, obtained; difficult to meet guru good spiritual friend, met; difficult to enter sublime Dharma precious door, entered; difficult to know unsurpassed instructions unfabricated, known; difficult to abandon samsara suffering's ocean, abandoned to go to liberation enlightenment's island—if not practiced now with effort and courage, outer such favorable conditions will not occur again.
Nagarjuna's statement [12751-12770]: "Dwelling in favorable place, relying on holy beings, oneself well-prayed, previous virtues arise—you possess the four great wheels." Shantideva: "This leisure is extremely difficult to obtain; for one who has accomplished purpose, if not diligent now, when will favorable conditions arise again?"
From the Treasury [12771-12800]: having obtained such leisure, if not diligent now, the dead go to lower realms; for kalpas numbering billions, even happy realms' sound is not heard—what need to speak of obtaining happiness?
Emaho!
Listen carefully! Present happiness-suffering and all appearances [12801-12820] arise from previous karma; this life's karma produces future's appearance. Those who did bad karma before have incomplete faculties, crippled limbs, ugly form, dependent on others here.
Those who accumulated good karma [12821-12850] have clear faculties, beautiful form, pleasing to see, wealth, enjoyments, always self-controlled and powerful. Future birth too depends on present's good-bad conduct.
Those gathering collections, practicing generosity, ethics, etc. [12851-12880], are born in happy realms' higher worlds with high status. Those patient, faithful dwell beautiful, heroic, central lands, honored by all, unharmed by others.
Previously respectful to gurus [12881-12900]—now meeting true gurus, practicing Dharma, born in good lands with all desires. Previously respectful to Three Jewels [12901-12920]—now well-ordained, celibate life complete, practicing sublime vehicle Dharma.
Previously trained in hearing, contemplating, meditating [12921-12950]—now great wisdom, Dharma topics immeasurable, hearing-contemplating-meditating accomplishing self and others' benefit. Those who did evil—born in lower realms, even higher realms have incomplete faculties, little merit, suffering.
Emaho!
Ah, precious one! In short [12951-12970]: previous life's actions, present life's body-mind patterns know; future birth where, present's conduct depends. Samadhiraja Sutra: "Previous actions—look at present body; future where—look at present mind."
Thus thinking [12971-12990], abandon non-virtue, practice virtue, always rest mind in sublime Dharma—nothing else can help! Daughter Jewel Sutra: "Here father, mother, relatives, friends, dependents cannot be refuge; sons, daughters not saviors. Without virtues, no other world-protector exists."
Advice to King [12991-13010]: "Time comes, king must go; enjoyments, friends, relatives won't accompany. Wherever beings go, karma follows like shadow."
Second [13011-13030]: contemplating certain death causes, always produce renunciation and weariness. Though impermanent, grasping permanence, attached to this life—confused beings! Fall into birth-death's river without knowing liberation; experience various sufferings without ceasing.
Separated from true spiritual friends [13031-13050], no path-showing protector, Dharma-eye closed, wandering in ignorance darkness. Thinking thus, this difficult-to-obtain leisure, joyfully produce eager mind or practice Dharma.
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate disciple! Though impermanent, grasping permanence [13051-13080], attached to this life's appearances—confused beings! Fall into birth-death's river without liberation; experience sufferings without weariness. Without true friends, no path-showing protector; Dharma-eye closed in ignorance darkness.
Contemplating certain death [13081-13100]: though obtained difficult leisure, this four-element compound aggregate certainly disintegrates—conditioned nature. Like bubble-popping aggregate, when will this destroy? Now on this unbroken support, do I accomplish liberation's sublime Dharma?
This life's dream-illusion appearance [13101-13120]—what does it accomplish? Ratnakuta Tantra: "No seat to remain on conditioned forms; stable life, death-time certainly comes. Six collections' objects appearing—no permanence. Person's memory-thoughts-feelings inexhaustible. Body's arising suffering without clarity."
Thus though impermanent [13121-13140], grasping permanence, attached to this life—I must not be thus! Whatever benefit to others, enemies tamed, lands taken, whatever done—all essenceless and deceptive. Look only at your own mind!
Mar-me-mdzad-ye-shes [13141-13160] stated: "Worldly conduct looking far—all done meaningless, suffering cause. Whatever thought doesn't benefit—accustom to looking at own mind!"
Emaho!
Listen well! Specific contemplation [13161-13180]: conditioned things impermanent like dreams, illusions, etc. Intended Array: "Alas, conditioned things impermanent; born, disintegrating nature. Born then disintegrating—therefore quickly peaceful, happy."
Star, dewdrop, lamp, illusion [13181-13200], bubble, dream, lightning, cloud—conditioned things similar to these. Thus person's life span: uncertain, sudden, instantaneous—time cannot be grasped like this.
Extensive Play Sutra [13201-13220]: "Life impermanent like playful cloud; descending mountain waterfall, quickly swiftly goes."
Intended Array [13221-13240]: some die in womb, some just born, some running, some old, some young, some in youth—what confidence have the living?
Thus thinking impermanence [13241-13260], quickly certain to die, this life's business—attachment-aversion, fighting, laziness, hoarding, great desire, factionalism, taming enemies, hearing without applying, all talk with spiritual friends—what use?
Generally speaking [13261-13280]: life short, knowables many; life span unknown—like swan taking milk from water, accept one's desires. From today, strive at profound Dharma!
Also [13281-13300]: outer appearances looking, year's seasons four changes, impermanent continuous; day-night instant changes, moment impermanent; birth-death sequence thinking, nature impermanent.
Emaho!
Fortunate child, understand! Shop, traveler, gathering-separation thinking—quickly die, certainly die, when die unknown; non-Dharma doesn't help!
Inner magic body's age [13301-13320]: mind's dawning door, happiness-suffering sequence—previous-later changing, impermanent, unstable, changing, moving. No example of dying then returning.
Think only death [13321-13340], not wandering even instant-moment. Bodhicaryavatara: "Day and night, I should only think this."
This life's mind not reversed until practicing concentration [13341-13360]—other Dharma activities aside, only this heart-thinking needed. Nothing deeper for reversing samsara!
Great master Padma [13361-13380] also stated: "Impermanence without distraction, death spur—day-night intervals always meditate." Thus though far, think samsara's formation-destruction, life impermanent; though near, think instant-moment, life impermanent.
Faculties and objects impermanent [13381-13400]—situations change; retinue and possessions impermanent—now exist, now gone; parents and relatives impermanent—gone then none; land and neighbors impermanent—much separation; time and age impermanent—appearance changes; happiness-suffering, enemy-friend impermanent—like traveler's inn.
Emaho!
Listen, you fortunate one! In short [13401-13420]: all sentient beings sleep on birth-death, wear happiness-suffering clothes, spread grasping-fixation's bed, sleep self-grasping's sleep, dream habitual patterns' dreams. Three realms' samsara house where five poisons feast—beings too, sleeping then rising, no beginning-end or awakening time.
Thus thinking [13421-13450], now must exert effort for liberation means from samsara's dark house! Karma and afflictions controlled, samsara person; though impermanence manifest, grasping truth; fallen into birth-death river, not knowing liberation; experiencing sufferings, no weariness time.
Separated from true friends [13451-13480], no path-showing protector, wandering in ignorance darkness. Thus thinking, this difficult leisure—produce joyful mind or practice Dharma. Supreme guide, captain—meeting qualified gurus, obtaining profound supreme Dharma nectar, now with effort cross samsara ocean's further shore.
Life impermanent like sunset mountain shadow [13481-13500]; cliff tree wind-moved; cloud-lightning like grass-tip dew—quickly going to death. If now not thinking "I will die," lazily distracted, death-time no help.
Thus now as fallen from above [13501-13520], fear-terror-panic, practice essence meaning. From now I too, forest flowers, empty of people, waterfall sound, solitary pleasant cliff mountain dwelling, thinking "essenceless four times," virtue as ornament, world-built, supreme nectar obtained.
Emaho!
Ah, precious disciple! At that medicine tree flower forest [13501-13520], peaceful Dharma cloud canopy, vidyadhara buddhas' golden lightning flashing, this life's clear light essence accomplished.
From liberation's mansion jewel palace [13521-13540], peaceful Dharma drum sound resounding, all migrators ignorance sleep awakened, original ground manifest enlightenment.
Weariness mind nature clear [13541-13560], going alone to peaceful forest, heart-wishing prayer words spoken—virtuous devotion quickly accomplish.
These are interim verses [13561-13580].
Second: death signs investigation [13581-13600]. Thalgyur states: "Death signs also twenty-one; gone to charnel ground, solitary place, worship guru and give; moreover with food and drink, satisfy other beings; then investigate outer-inner-secret death signs."
Thus generally [13601-13630], not knowing when death comes, investigate with mo, pra, etc., surpassing worldly outsiders. Yogins determine time: gone to empty valley, forest, charnel ground, jungle, mountain area, etc.; examine life-form, etc.
Sun-Moon Union: "Death-lord demon rising, death-point bardo thus examine; solitary place or empty valley, death time grasping is crucial."
Emaho!
Listen, child of the lineage! Actual investigation [13621-13660] has uncommon and common. Uncommon: sky-space reflection becoming impermanent, dissolving; no moon-form, death. Limbs four parts broken, four months; above that head broken, three months; upper-lower separated, two months; gathered lump, one month. Know that timing!
Sky-earth connection cord [13661-13700]: if broken, nineteen days not exceeded. From Sumeru's side, white lion not descended—sixteen days certainly. If at mountain-plain border, wish-fulfilling tree waist broken—this too experts distinguish.
Ocean water's film [13701-13720] dissolving, these too experts distinguish separately. Earth's cities, if monk's staff broken—nine days likewise die.
Sumeru mountain peak [13721-13740], unchanging sun set—three days also die. Rituals completely abandoned, investigate self-awareness essence meaning.
Sumeru's inside [13741-13760], dakini's sound broken—thirteen or five. From wish-fulfilling tree, death-lord demons rising—seven days certainly not deceived; not beneficial—emptiness habituation crucial.
Emaho!
Fortunate one, pay attention! Common signs [13761-13800]: if limb and nail luster gone—nine months certain; person's eye film dissolving—five months likewise; death-lord Yama self-risen—twenty-one days death; nothing helps. If foot's sole protrudes outward—one month likewise.
If examining other's body [13801-13820]: person disease-struck, teeth's root gathering pus—nine days also die. Likewise various five days also die. Limbs repeatedly moving-contracting—seven days. Eyes bean-sprout looking—three days die. Eye joints greatly shaking—half month.
Cheek's vein broken [13821-13860]—likewise nineteen days. Person life's formation doing, breath layered rough—six months. Nose's nasika broken—seven days die. Eye varana broken—five days die. Left cheek flesh fallen—one day likewise die. Upper-lower teeth meeting—three days certainly.
Tongue black thigle arisen [13861-13880]—two days also die. Ear attached to head—that very night midnight. Chest's lheng-na destroyed—half month certainly. Sleep root gone—half month likewise.
Emaho!
