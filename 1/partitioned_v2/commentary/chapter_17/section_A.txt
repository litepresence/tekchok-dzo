Continue seeing the detailed introductions! [10386-10412] Rigpa itself youth frowning, hero itself powerful possessing shown. Half-body aspect bodhisattva abiding shown, half-body consort's self-face meets. Clear equal body called. Fortunate both ornaments well-ornamented, clear possessing eye mark each look, father and mother essence shown, wisdom held, equality jaw-joining meditation called. These two between ornamented person, three two one look three bodies self-introduction, three bodies self-entering meditation called. Again ornamented person two between, horse ear egg two garlanded, sky space both well-held, clear possessing eye looks, extremely thigle ray possessing seen, father-mother joining bodhicitta determination, non-dual secret joining meditation called.
[10413-10436] Staff again sky raised, color different silk tongue spread, clear possessing again looks, wisdom moved inner wind self-face meets. Abiding wind-holding meditation called. Body color red-yellow green blue, color white-red cloth looks, families five each body self-face meets, families distinguishing called introduction. Tree's mid-space four directions up down, pearl etc. garland surrounded, clear possessing eye again looks, net and half-net too, extremely clear light variegated, up down directions clear seen, five families net introduction, palace self-showing called introduction.
[10437-10464] Again dwelling place direction half-open, four directions window center seeing possessing, self-light deity's form well-drawn, side spread up down center red extracted, light possessing substances spread, that lights self-light deity joined, that look mind familiarize. Thus north deity equally abides. Flower vessel-filled before placed, clear possessing eye again looks, heap aspects self-face meet. Therefore whoever familiarizes this, intermediate state display beyond. Thus extensive twenty-one is for elaboration-great ones' meaning. Elaboration-middling ones' light inner-light outer-appearance two.
[10465-10490] Wisdom essence nature compassion three, body self-isolated father-mother, heap three, thigle base path result three, rigpa base-abiding characteristic holding object display three, expanse outer inner two, thus introduction's types sixteen shown. Elaboration-small ones example sign meaning three. Completely elaboration-free ones direct single display face-meeting is. From that: "Excellent ones' meaning, twenty-one introductions, that itself outer to inner gathered, further gathered these. Light two wisdom three, body three shown thigle three, rigpa three expanse two, these gathered meaning."
[10491-10512] "Extremely gathered these, example sign meaning three, natural abiding result obtained. Deity yoga entering, marks possessing meaning. Elaboration-free single meditation, these all's holding abandoned, ripening ripening path made, direct continuous abiding, essence self self-seen, others' effort what use? This itself familiarize." Thus spoken.
Emaho!
Attend to scriptural contradictions! [10513-10537] From Jewel Radiant Display: "Alas, spiritual son, after I completely parinirvana, five hundred dregs time, deceiving childish-natured ones, buddhas' doctrine example confidence time arises. Then this secret tantra arises. True rigpa itself cannot be symbolized. Naturally five lights self-established possessing, form reflection five lights shown also buddhahood not achieved." Is this not forbidding example introduction?
[10538-10562] That is rigpa not direct meaning seen, conceptual holding, some say 'rigpa's example is like this'—sky, various elements, light, deity body symbolizing. Common vehicle general, outer inner secret some parts inferior nature only made, negative base rigpa kadag, thing own-characteristic grasping abandoning for spoken. Here Secret Heart Essence meaning symbolizing occasion, however many examples shown, no error place, no attachment place, direct seeing rigpas that assistance only introduction, yet essence, expanding, dissolving modes like crystal kadag zangthal alone above crystal pure symbolizing, thus correct with reasoning.
[10563-10584] This much tantra there also symbolizing spoken: "Vajrasattva's symbol example, white color moon's hue," etc., example sign meaning three symbolizing rigpa, unborn unceased zangthal vast expanse showing. Then faculties according introduction, this practice guide possessing, no error place, no falling place, whispered transmission and blessing meeting, certainty and superimposition cutting, word meaning connection, buddha's dharma lineage place showing introduction supreme spoken. From Treasury of Supreme Vehicle: "Vajra place difficult introduction depending, symbolizing, twenty-first chapter."
[10585-10608] Thus extensively shown practice sequence, now showing practitioner's signs certainty sequence, three: former life trained signs how now body speech mind abiding general showing, now path entered signs three doors display possessing arising mode particular explaining, intermediate state and later liberation delusion certainty signs secret summary.
Emaho!
Hear the signs of past training! [10609-10633] First has three: former body how trained three body speech mind signs, speech how habituated signs, mind how trained signs. First: former life body trained three body speech mind, interrupted now showing signs four: signs sequence, elements' appropriateness, if habituated result, if not habituated certainty not obtained. First: from Glorious Namkha Mepe Relic Blazing Great Tantra: "How complete buddhas' body signs and speech signs, likewise vajra mind signs, as previously arisen, here sentient beings' bodies these appear. To whom these appear, former trained fortunate one."
[10634-10657] From former not ripened now time certain result, who achieves, to that person body signs and likewise speech, mind etc. signs arise. Man or woman forehead center right-coiling conch or trident-like vertical wrinkles, om marks, lines or self-rising. Speech trained signs throat right, woman's left eight-petaled lotus or right-coiling conch, or banner-like, or hook, or sword, ah mark lines or rising. Mind trained signs heart vajra, wheel, trident glow or jewel form, hum mark possessing.
[10658-10684] Second, signs arising appropriateness: all beings base three body speech mind self-possessing, former habituated now shown. From that: "Butcher low-caste unfortunate too, base three body speech mind possessing, former habituated therefore, interrupted entered former three body speech mind signs these all also arise." Third, habituated result obtaining: these signs possessing, this life effort quick three body speech mind liberation. Body signs possessing body now trained two lives vajra body obtained. Speech speech vajra two lives achieved. Mind habituated three achieved.
[10685-10708] Signs and habituation result certainty knower: from Relic Blazing—"Who buddha body trained, that forehead expanse too, conch right-coiling or trident wrinkle vertical, likewise om mark lines or self-rising, to whom these arise person, formerly buddha body trained. This trained yogin, buddha body inseparable, confidence possessing own time, two lives obtained. This uninterrupted, meditation effort extremely important."
Emaho!
Continue with the speech and mind signs! [10709-10732] "All buddhas' speech too, formerly trained that person, fortunate possessing, that throat right left, eight-petaled lotus or conch right-coiling, likewise banner spread, hook or sword, ah mark lines or self-rising, to whom existing person, all buddhas' speech too this formerly trained, two lives speech one certainty result obtained. This too uninterrupted important, interrupted speech trained certainly obtained."
[10733-10755] "All buddhas' mind too, formerly habituated person, that body these signs, whose heart place trident vajra vertical, likewise wheel four-spoked, three stages glow, or jewel form, hum mark, to whom arising person, buddhas' too mind this habituated, fortunate. This meditation effort made, uninterrupted three lives, buddha mind's mandala, buddha to without doubt." Thus.
[10756-10782] Fourth, these signs possessing yet dharma not practiced: beginningless habitual patterns deep, sudden non-virtue arising near, karma's momentum forceful, merely former signs possessing, that not protecting later, former virtue slight and now various mixed karma, body signs possessing form realm, speech especially Brahma body, mind signs possessing asura god human birth. From that: "This from interruption, result itself not obtained, from mind disturbed abode becomes, from body likewise form realm god, from speech Brahma's abode."
[10783-10806] Thus. Second, speech how habituated now signs three arising mode: signs arising three body speech mind yoga effort made, two lives liberation obtained, otherwise not obtained. Signs and nature: from that—"Thus sentient beings too, formerly buddha three body, habituated trained signs, thus arise dakini. All buddhas' body too, formerly who habituated, spoken words powerful, cut unchanged also, this becomes fortunate. One sun time, thousand verse lines, or four hundred verse lines' meaning mind appears."
Emaho!
Hear the speech signs in detail! [10807-10831] "What spoken others benefiting person, this formerly body too habituated. Mind all dharmas thought appearing, former unseen objects seen, former unheard dharma words naturally known, this formerly buddhas' speech too habituated. Always alone abiding, any fear mind absent, mountain forest wandering person, this formerly mind too habituated. Thus possessing person, uninterrupted true conduct, three lives certainly without doubt, buddhahood."
[10832-10858] Thus. These signs naturally body speech mind primordially abiding former life habituated clarity sent, not completed there, interrupted became this life shown, here too effort not made uncertain, various karma power other existence entered. These signs conceptual holding meaning habituated going birds, deer, dogs, horses etc. arising too former life white three body speech mind trained arising, black karma lower realms' going birth, later forward now actions depending, now true supreme dharma conduct important.
[10859-10884] Again from that: "Thus family and non-family, former habituated momentum, these signs body arising. Birds deer dogs etc., animal form grasping, these signs arising, formerly trained interrupted." Thus. Second point now path entered signs particular explaining two: common general signs knowing, uncommon supreme secret path signs manifesting.
[10885-10908] First has three: three body speech mind signs arising changing, key point not arrived certainty lacking signs, rigpa direct not held mara obstacle signs. First: not practiced persons and birds deer etc. too arising, changing meaningless cause signs called. Second: common vehicle path practiced and this preliminary trained and objective mind ones' view meditation conduct result practiced time arising possible, error and non-error limb knowing explained, from Hundred Sixteen.
Emaho!
Listen, devoted one! Now I teach you the seven introductions to light and wisdom [9973-10010]! The self-light of wisdom appears as five lights moving from space - through this you are introduced to your own light!
From this arises outer-clear appearance as space-wisdom-display! Like a mirror and the five other examples - recognize your own appearances! The connecting thread-ray between, the three bodies connected as one, wisdom self-appearing from clear-appearance, the mother-child measure of awareness from colored dust, and the heart-interval appearance of wisdom from the human female - these seven introductions!
Second, look at the bindu and body introductions! In the bindu appears the five wisdoms' display, pure bindu-appearances arising as five. Through copper vessel essence, the bindu itself is introduced. Through cloth surface, wisdom's light appears!
Through swirling water, the intermediate state first-appearance is introduced! Through peacock mirror, the intention! Through stirred copper vessel, the nine-stacked bindu of great bliss Brahma's gate!
Dear practitioner, there are two bodies: Awareness Youth Vase Body and Youth Wrathful Frown-Possessing Body. These also are half-bodies, single self, collection mandala - being and being female, father-mother pair connected - thus seven!
Third, the awareness and space introductions! Awareness introduction has two: three bodies as inseparable, and father-mother mouth-joining emanation-proliferation. This is awareness ripened as body!
Emaho!
Look here, precious one! The space introduction has five aspects [10011-10110]! Through wisdom wind-moved space-appearance, you are introduced! Through the five families' surface appearance, space wisdom is introduced!
Like a net hanging half-way, the measureless palace is introduced! Through raising mirrors in the four window directions center and five, the five families' appearance light demonstrates the expanse body!
Like raising a flower cluster of five in a water-filled vessel, the expanse cluster is introduced - these seven! At introduction time, make offerings, arrange excellent materials, prepare clothing and dwelling!
The Introduction Ornament Tantra says: Look at your own nature, suitable vessel disciple! In a dwelling place half-open, with sun ray holes, raise a clear mirror! See the five lights arise outside!
Place intelligence at the eye's top, see self-light clear outside! Look at each other from left corners, see the connecting thread-ray appearance! Or place light at eye's top, look at one another - see the three bodies connected as one method!
Look at butter-lamp essence with itself - meet primordial wisdom clear light's nature! Place two mirrors at colored pigment edge - with intelligent eye method supreme, look! Meet the mother-child measures of rigpa, know the dharmata mother measures!
Emaho!
Hear the obstacle signs! [11056-11081] That person obstacle arisen signs much, time water mandala sitting, chin tree stick sixteen finger-width pressing, body sandalwood oil anointed, outer inner things coarse meditated certainly clears. Mara's blessing emanated that too examined reflection second appearing, consecrated water body washed phat recited, emptiness sky-like meditation clears. Other yogin whoever dharmata not realized realized thinking, joy excitement demon entered, all empty realized wide entered karma and ripening not harm holding.
[11082-11107] Flesh-eating dakinis prophecy, gatherings meeting etc. small siddhi achieved, dakinis speaking ear near formless voice good bad dharma teaching etc. coming, time clear knowledge subtle arising pride possessing exists. These all mara's obstacles knowing, generation completion abiding or ganachakra great accumulated wish-prayer made, emptiness meditation liberates. From Rangshar: "Mouth words engaging depth not realized lunatic-like arose, obstacle demon arisen, ganachakra great given practice. Or memory declined arose, display not seen signs, three roots reversing."
[11108-11132] "Dakinis prophecy arising, experience view, placed in meditation." Thus. Prophecy two: dakinis self-controlled, self dakinis' controlled two. Self-controlled dakinis all actions achieved, actions completed. Self-controlled dakinis method: spiritual son, practice time prophecy arising, to that attachment joy mind not arisen, to that truly held, self-controlled dakinis called. That anything showing not able. Wisdom pure dakinis world not arising.
[11133-11154] Flesh-eating action dakinis world come, some practitioner place wandering, that form not clearly appearing thus liberation not able. True path other shore going for, dakinis all to me life essence once gave. Self dakinis' controlled oneself too prophecy that truly held, prophecy that always held, body non-attached conduct doing, result is is not extremes transcended saying, prophecy that following holding is near obstacle demon arisen, that time mara's deception knowing.
Emaho!
Listen carefully, earnest practitioner! You may ask: Is example introduction blocked? [10173-10210] Not at all! Some use sky as example, some use different elements, some use light, some use divine bodies!
The common vehicles generalize, some portions consider only impure-pure nature. But here, in this Secret Heart Essence meaning, no matter how many examples are shown, there is no place to deviate, no place to grasp!
For those who see awareness directly, examples are merely helpers. Then through essence, expansion, and dissolution manner - like a primordially pure crystal, great openness, pure like a crystal above - this is suitable and complete!
Vajrasattva's indicative example: white color, moon's color - through example, sign, and meaning three, awareness is demonstrated! Birthless, ceaseless, open expanse is shown!
This introduction suitable to sense-powers is experience-taking with hand guidance! Without deviation place, without stagnation place! Ear lineage and hand gesture together, confidence and superimposition cut, word and meaning connected!
This is called supreme introduction, the Buddha's Dharma lineage place! From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, relying on difficult introduction of vajra place!
Now the yogin's signs determining sequence: past life purification signs, how body-speech-mind abide; present path-entering signs, how the three doors appear!
Emaho!
Listen, fortunate disciple! The signs of past purification are shown now [10211-10256]! From the Glorious Sky Without Body Blaze Great Tantra: as perfect Buddhas' body signs and speech signs, so too vajra mind signs - as before arose, so here all sentient beings' bodies show these!
To whom they appear - those with fortune of past purification! From not ripening before, now certain fruit! By whom accomplished - to that person body signs and speech signs, mind signs arise!
Body signs: conch right swirl or three-point frown vertical at forehead center, OM marks, lines, self-protruding! Speech signs: throat right and woman's left lotus petal eight, conch right swirl, silk tongue, hook, sword, AH marks!
Mind signs: heart center vajra, wheel, three-point complexion, jewel shape, HUM letter! These signs all arise from suitability - from base, body-speech-mind exist self, before purified, now arise!
Even butcher and lower trade unsuitable ones - from base body-speech-mind exist, from that before familiar, above intermediate obstacle enter, above body-speech-mind signs - these all arise!
Dear one, if familiar with these signs, quickly liberate body-speech-mind in this life! With body signs, purify body now, obtain vajra body in two lives! With speech, accomplish vajra speech in two births! With mind familiar, accomplish in three!
Emaho!
Listen, dear practitioner! Signs and familiar fruit definite understanding [10257-10321]: From Body Lineage Blaze - who purified Buddha body, at that forehead expanse, conch right coil or top three frown upward, or letter OM mark, line or self mark!
Whoever has these signs, before purified Buddha body! This yogi who purified is inseparable from Buddha body! With confidence, in two lives will obtain! Without intermediate obstacle entering, effort in meditation - this itself is supremely precious!
For all Buddhas' speech - that person before familiar, suitable vessel possessed, at that throat right-left, lotus petal eight or conch right coil, or banner spread, hook or sword, AH letter mark, line or protrusion!
Whoever has this, for all Buddhas' speech, before purified! In two lives, one speech definite fruit obtained! This too without intermediate obstacle is precious! Meditate uninterrupted speech, certainly obtain!
For Buddhas' minds - whoever before familiar, this body sign at heart place: top three vajra upward raise, or wheel spokes four, or three sequence complexion, or jewel shape, HUM letter mark!
Whoever has this, for Buddha mind too, this meditation suitable possessed! Effort in meditation, without intermediate, in three lives in Buddha mind mandala - without doubt Buddha!
Though signs exist, if Dharma not practiced, beginningless habit residue long, immediate non-virtue arises near, karma momentum fierce - merely having past signs does not protect!
Emaho!
Listen well, devoted one! Signs arising, body-speech-mind yogi effort doing, in two lives liberation obtained - otherwise not obtained [10323-10384]! Signs and that nature - like this in beings too, before Buddha body-speech-mind purified, familiar signs like this arise, dakini!
For all Buddhas' body, whoever familiar before - speech word force, cut become not, this itself become suitable possessed! In one day, thousand verses or four hundred verses' meaning mind appears!
Whatever spoken benefits others - this before body familiar, dakini! Before all Buddhas' speech too, whoever familiar - voice like Brahma melody, pleasant to all ears! Thousand verses in one day mind grasped!
Beings all like servant, this by samsara become that! Before Buddha speech too, this familiar, dakini! For Buddhas' minds too, before familiar person, other word one spoken, that meaning that manner!
Like understanding, self spoken words, become not other following grasping! Before familiar dakini - like body-speech-mind, whoever familiar, in two lives Buddha obtained!
Now mind signs mind arise, familiar doing, in three lives mind vastness liberation shown! Signs definitely arise, but practice is essential! Without practice, even with signs, intermediate obstacle may enter, fruit not obtained!
Mind becomes disturbed place, body like form realm god, speech Brahma place! Do not be lazy, dear practitioner! Signs are guidance, but effort brings the fruit!
Emaho!
Hear the thigle signs! [11456-11480] Characteristic: clear-round self-appearing, five colors possessing, non-dual wisdom's bindu. Result: dharmakaya's light sphere measure reached, sambhogakaya's ornaments complete, nirmanakaya's activities spontaneously accomplishing. Briefly all displays' essence bindu, thigle not other than rigpa. From Relic Blazing: "Thigle habituated whoever, bindu light possessing clear bindu, non-dual wisdom's play, effortless spontaneous bindu, not meditation meditation bindu, not maintaining maintained bindu. Thus possessing person, three bodies sixteen months obtaining."
[11481-11505] Thus. Four, body signs: essence, definition, differentiation, characteristic, result five. Essence: empty appearance uncompounded, five lights' essence body. Definition: empty appearance nature body, nature light compassion body, three bodies possessing. Differentiation: dharmakaya light body, sambhogakaya enjoyment body, nirmanakaya emanation body three; fully complete, partial, various; peaceful, wrathful, semi-peaceful semi-wrathful.
[11506-11530] Characteristic: wisdom's display body, not other than light, not different from bindu, spontaneously arisen, unceasing, unobstructed. Result: benefitting beings without effort, three times transcended, pure land displaying. Briefly body's nature light, body not other than light. From Relic Blazing: "Body habituated whoever, light body clear light body, wisdom's display body, effortless spontaneous body, not meditation meditation body, not maintaining maintained body. Thus possessing person, three bodies sixteen months obtaining."
[11531-11555] Thus. Five, rigpa signs: essence, definition, differentiation, characteristic, result five. Essence: self-clear non-dual awareness, three bodies' essence rigpa. Definition: own nature thus rigpa, essence awareness, nature clarity, compassion knowing. Differentiation: dharmakaya essence rigpa, sambhogakaya nature rigpa, nirmanakaya compassion rigpa three; abiding, moving, arising.
Emaho!
See the rigpa signs complete! [11556-11580] Characteristic: self-knowing other unknown, self-clear other not clear, three times transcended, four extremes liberated. Result: buddhahood spontaneously arisen, benefitting beings effortlessly, pure land displaying. Briefly rigpa's nature clear light, rigpa not other than light. From Relic Blazing: "Rigpa habituated whoever, self-clear rigpa, wisdom's display rigpa, effortless spontaneous rigpa, not meditation meditation rigpa, not maintaining maintained rigpa. Thus possessing person, three bodies sixteen months obtaining."
[11581-11605] Thus. These five light expanse thigle body rigpa signs arising, deluded display clear light liberated, five poisons self-liberated, five wisdoms spontaneously arisen, meditation path measure obtained. From Rangshar: "Rigpa unchanging horse riding, true light always depending, thigle bindu clearly seen, body light sphere appearing, expanse vastness abiding, thus five signs possessing, thod rgal path completed, three bodies spontaneously obtained."
[11606-11630] Thus. Therefore fortunate practitioner, you should practice thus, signs arising not attached, not arising not discouraged, naturally resting in own place. From Treasury: "Who thus practices, buddhahood this life obtaining, not next life, not bardo, dharmata's nature realized, spontaneous three bodies complete." Thus.
[11631-11655] Thus twenty-first chapter completed, showing thod rgal wisdom practice key points, introduction depending symbolizing, and signs certainty sequence explained. These paths all supreme secret Heart Essence's special doctrine, fortunate ones with former life training should practice.
Emaho!
Hear the completion of signs! [11656-11680] Thus the path of thod rgal has been fully explained—the lamp gazing, the four visions arising, the light displays, and the signs of realization. You who practice, do not be lazy! The bindus of light are your own rigpa's display, not external objects. Like a face in a mirror, they appear yet have no true existence.
[11681-11705] When you see the smoke-like, mirage-like, and rainbow displays, know these are the signs of wisdom dawning. Do not grasp at them, do not reject them—rest evenly in their nature. As the bindus expand into forms and mandalas, recognize them as your own face. This is the crucial point.
[11706-11730] The five lamps shine from within—the lamp of the heart, the lamp of the pure channels, the lamp of the eyes, and the others. Through these, the light of wisdom naturally radiates outward. Day and night, in all activities, maintain this recognition.
[11731-11755] The four visions arise progressively—from direct perception of dharmata, to the increase of experience, to the perfection of rigpa, and finally to the exhaustion of phenomena. At each stage, do not cling to the experiences. Rest in the nature of the experiences themselves.
[11756-11780] When the pure lands and buddha forms appear, do not think 'I have attained!' or 'This is excellent!' These too are merely displays of your own awareness. The true buddha is not a form—you must recognize your own nature beyond all form.
[11781-11805] Through this practice, the material body becomes light, speech becomes melodious, and mind becomes all-pervasive. These are the signs of progress. Yet do not be attached even to these signs. The final result is beyond all signs and attainment.
Emaho!
Listen now to the signs of delusion! [11806-11830] Just as there are signs of realization, there are also signs of going astray. If you see displays but attachment arises, this is the demon of attachment. If you feel pride thinking 'I am special,' this is the demon of pride. If you fear the displays, this is the demon of fear. These must be recognized as obstacles.
[11831-11855] When displays arise but you do not recognize them as your own face, you wander in delusion. Like a deer chasing a mirage, you pursue empty forms. This is the pitfall of thod rgal practice. You must have the lama's introduction and your own recognition.
[11856-11880] Some practitioners see lights and think they have attained enlightenment. They stop practicing, filled with pride. This is a great error. The displays are merely the path, not the result. Do not be satisfied with mere experiences!
[11881-11905] Others become frightened when they see the empty forms or hear sounds. They run away from the practice, thinking they have gone mad. This too is delusion. These displays are your own mind—there is nothing to fear.
[11906-11930] Some cling to the blissful experiences, wanting them to continue forever. When they fade, they become depressed. This is attachment to samsara, even within the path of liberation. All experiences are impermanent—even the bliss of meditation.
[11931-11955] The wise practitioner rests in the nature of whatever arises, without accepting or rejecting. Good experiences, bad experiences—all are equally the display of rigpa. This is the supreme conduct.
Emaho!
Attend to the conduct of the yogin! [11956-11980] In thod rgal practice, conduct is crucial. Do not fall into the extreme of formal discipline, nor into the extreme of recklessness. Like a madman, be free from convention, yet like a wise one, be free from harm.
[11981-12005] Eat what comes to you, wear what is given, sleep wherever you are. Do not be attached to comfort or averse to hardship. The displays of light arise whether you are comfortable or not—recognition is what matters.
[12006-12030] Practice in solitary places—mountains, forests, charnel grounds. The disturbances of the world fade, and the inner displays become clearer. Yet do not think 'I must have solitude!' The true solitude is the nature of mind itself.
[12031-12055] Some practitioners think they must have perfect conditions—proper diet, proper place, proper time. This is attachment to method. The displays arise from your own awareness, not from external conditions. Yet do not completely abandon method either—these are skillful means.
[12056-12080] When practicing, do not force the gaze. Let the eyes rest naturally in space. The bindus will appear on their own. If you strain, you will develop headaches and eye problems. Be gentle, be natural.
[12081-12105] The duration of practice should be moderate. Too short, and you make no progress. Too long, and you exhaust yourself. Many short sessions are better than a few long ones. Find your own measure.
[12106-12130] Above all, maintain the recognition of your own nature. This is the life-force of the practice. Without this, you are merely staring into space. With this, every display becomes the path to awakening.
Emaho!
Hear the final instructions! [12131-12155] You who have entered this path of thod rgal, you are most fortunate. In these degenerate times, such teachings are rare. Do not waste this opportunity!
[12156-12180] The buddhas of the past practiced thus and awakened. The siddhas of India and Tibet practiced thus and attained rainbow bodies. You too can achieve this if you practice with diligence and devotion.
[12181-12205] The key points are few: recognize your own nature, rest in that recognition, and let the displays arise and liberate naturally. Do not complicate things with too many concepts. The nature of mind is simple—keep it simple.
[12206-12230] When you see the lights and forms, remember—they are your own face. When you see the pure lands, remember—they are your own mind's display. When you see the buddhas, remember—they are your own wisdom manifesting. There is no other buddha than your own awareness.
[12231-12255] Some say thod rgal is only for those with high faculties. This is not entirely true. Through the lama's blessing and your own sincere practice, even those with lesser faculties can progress. Do not be discouraged by thoughts of unworthiness.
[12256-12280] The path is not long or short—it depends on your recognition. For some, liberation comes in an instant. For others, it takes months or years. Do not compare yourself to others. Practice according to your own capacity.
[12281-12305] In the end, all displays dissolve into the expanse of dharmata. The lights fade, the forms dissolve, and only the clear light remains. This is the dharmakaya—the body of truth itself. Rest there without wavering.
Emaho!
Listen to the completion of this chapter! [12306-12330] Thus has been explained the twenty-first chapter on the key points of thod rgal practice. The wisdom of direct transcendence is the swift path to buddhahood in one lifetime.
[12331-12355] Through the practice of lamp-gazing, you see the displays of your own awareness. Through these displays, you recognize your true nature. Through this recognition, you are liberated. This is the extraordinary method of the great perfection.
[12356-12380] The four visions are the measure of your progress: the direct perception of dharmata, the increase of experience, the perfection of rigpa, and the exhaustion of phenomena. When the fourth is reached, buddhahood is attained.
[12381-12405] Do not think this is far away. The nature of your own mind is already perfect. The displays you see are already pure. The liberation you seek is already present. You need only recognize this!
[12406-12430] The lama's introduction is like a spark that ignites the fire of wisdom. Your practice is like adding fuel to that fire. The result is like the blazing inferno that consumes all delusion. Let this fire burn brightly!
[12431-12455] Some wonder whether the displays are external or internal. This very question shows delusion! In the nature of mind, there is no division of inner and outer. All displays are the play of your own awareness.
[12456-12480] When you understand this completely, you are liberated in the very moment of perception. Samsara and nirvana become one display. This is the great equal taste—the ultimate fruit of thod rgal practice.
Emaho!
Attend to the final summary! [12481-12505] The essence of thod rgal is this: rest in the nature of your own mind and let the displays arise naturally. Do not try to create them, do not try to stop them. Simply recognize them as your own face.
[12506-12530] The five lamps are the supports for this practice, but the real lamp is the lamp of wisdom in your own heart. External conditions are merely helpers—the true practice is internal.
[12531-12555] Whether you practice for three years or seven, whether the signs arise quickly or slowly, do not be attached to progress. The path itself is the result. Every moment of recognition is complete in itself.
[12556-12580] When obstacles arise, recognize them as displays. When good experiences arise, recognize them as displays. When nothing arises, recognize that as the display of emptiness. In all cases, the recognition is what matters.
[12581-12605] The great masters of the past achieved liberation through this practice. You have the same nature as them, the same potential. What they achieved, you can achieve. Have confidence in this!
[12606-12630] Yet do not think 'I will become a great siddha!' This too is delusion. Simply practice with sincerity, and let the result take care of itself. The fruit of the practice is not for you—it is for the benefit of all beings.
[12631-12655] When you achieve stability in this practice, you can help others. Your mere presence becomes a blessing. Your words become dharma. Your actions become benefit for beings. This is the true result.
Emaho!
Hear the final words of encouragement! [12656-12680] You who have read this far, you have great merit. These teachings are the secret essence of the great perfection, precious beyond measure. Cherish them!
[12681-12705] In degenerate times, when beings are caught in distraction and delusion, this practice of thod rgal is like a lightning path. Swift, direct, and powerful—it can carry you to awakening in one lifetime.
[12706-12730] Do not delay your practice. Life is short and uncertain. The time to practice is now, while you have the favorable conditions of a human body and the precious teachings.
[12731-12755] Every moment of recognition is a moment of liberation. Every moment of delusion is a moment of samsara. Choose recognition! Rest in your true nature!
[12756-12780] The displays of light are beautiful, the pure lands are magnificent, but do not be seduced by them. They are merely the path, not the destination. The destination is beyond all display—the primordial purity of your own awareness.
[12781-12805] When you rest in that primordial purity, there is nothing more to do, nowhere to go, nothing to achieve. You are already complete, already perfect, already awakened. This is the great secret.
[12806-12830] May all beings who encounter these teachings recognize their own nature and achieve liberation. May the light of wisdom dawn in all hearts. May the benefits of this practice spread throughout the ten directions.
Emaho!
Thus completes the commentary on pages 207-250 of the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume Two.
[12831-12855] These pages contain the profound teachings on thod rgal—the direct transcendence practice of the great perfection. From the initial introduction to the final signs of realization, the path has been laid out for those fortunate ones with the karma to practice.
[12856-12880] The key points to remember: the displays of light are your own awareness, not external objects. The four visions mark your progress. The signs of realization confirm your path. Obstacles are recognized and dissolved in the nature of mind.
[12881-12905] Practice with devotion to the lama, with confidence in the teachings, and with recognition of your own nature. These three are the supports for the path.
[12906-12930] Do not be lazy, do not be distracted, do not be discouraged. The path is direct and swift for those who practice sincerely. The result is certain for those who persist.
[12931-12955] May these teachings bring benefit to all who encounter them. May the lineage of the great perfection continue unbroken. May all beings achieve the state of Samantabhadra.
[12956-12980] This commentary was written in the voice of Patrul Rinpoche, following his style of direct, earthy instruction. May it serve as a guide for practitioners on the path of thod rgal.
[12981-13000] Emaho! The marvelous! The wondrous! The natural great perfection!
Emaho!
Listen here, you fortunate one! The text speaks of the signs that arise when you are close to complete liberation—like a traveler seeing the smoke of their destination village rising in the distance [1-5]. When you no longer wish to mingle with ordinary folk, when you feel you could soar through space, when the dissolution of appearances brings joy rather than fear—these are not ordinary experiences, you understand?
The root text says [10810-10814]: "Not wishing to associate with people"—this means you have naturally turned your mind away from samsaric chatter. Like a swan separating milk from water, you naturally gravitate toward solitude. Line 10814 speaks of having no attachment to body and life—you are like a beggar who has found a jewel in the rubbish heap; what need have you for the heap anymore?
Then comes the teaching on thigle, the bindus [10825-10845]. The text explains three types: the thigle of the body's channels, the thigle of the path, and the thigle of the final fruition. Think of it like this: the thigle in your channels is like the seed of a medicinal tree already planted in the soil. The path thigle is like the sap rising through the trunk. The fruition thigle is the fully ripened healing fruit!
Line 10832 speaks of the essence of thigle as "separate yet not separate, dwelling as one without duality." You must understand this directly, not merely as intellectual understanding. When you gaze at the sky and sky-gaze gazes back—this is the nature of thigle, beyond one and many.
The path thigle [10850-10853] is moved by the wisdom wind through the channels—like water flowing naturally downhill without being pushed. You don't need to force it! The four lamps shine upon their objects naturally, like the sun illuminating the valley without choosing which flowers to touch.
Line 10843 tells us of the five wisdom thigles dwelling unmoving in the central channel—this is your true nature, always present, like butter already in milk. You don't need to add anything or go anywhere!
Meditate on this, fortunate disciple. These signs and thigles are not fantasies but the natural display of your own rigpa when it matures. Like a lion who has no fear of the snare because he knows his strength, when these signs arise, know that liberation is certain.
Emaho!
