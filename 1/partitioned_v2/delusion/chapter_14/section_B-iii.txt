[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [INTERNAL-EXTERNAL DUALISM]
MISREADING:
External elements are physical world; internal elements are body/mind—two separate domains.
WHY IT ARISES:
Subject-object dualism.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Missing the non-dual nature of inner-outer.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Environment seen as separate from practitioner.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DUALISTIC ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PURIFIED ELEMENTS LITERALISM]
MISREADING:
"Pure" elements are cleaner or better versions of regular elements.
WHY IT ARISES:
Moral language of "pure" and "impure."
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Purification understood as cleaning or refining.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the ontological transformation.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SUBTLE BODY MATERIALISM]
MISREADING:
The subtle body (channels, winds, essences) is a subtle physical body, like an energetic anatomy.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Body" suggests physical structure. New age subtle anatomy.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reification of subtle body as quasi-physical.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the wisdom-dimension of subtle body.
