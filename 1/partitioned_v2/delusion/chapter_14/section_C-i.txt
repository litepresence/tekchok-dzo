[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SUBTLE BODY MATERIALISM]
MISREADING:
The subtle body (channels, winds, essences) is a subtle physical body, like an energetic anatomy.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Body" suggests physical structure. New age subtle anatomy.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reification of subtle body as quasi-physical.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the wisdom-dimension of subtle body.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].

MISREADING:
Mind (sems) and consciousness (rnam shes) are equivalent terms for ordinary awareness.
WHY IT ARISES:
English "mind" covers both. Lack of distinction.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Missing the crucial distinction between dualistic mind and non-dual rigpa.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Rigpa reduced to "being conscious" or "mindful."
