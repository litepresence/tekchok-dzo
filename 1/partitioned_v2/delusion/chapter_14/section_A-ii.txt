[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL ANATOMY]
MISREADING:
The three main channels (central, left, right) are actual physical nerves or blood vessels.
WHY IT ARISES:
"Channel" suggests plumbing or wiring. Anatomical curiosity.
PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Looking for channels in cadavers or MRI scans.
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the non-physical nature of subtle body.
CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].
