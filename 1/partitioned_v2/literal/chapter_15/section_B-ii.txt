[5831] This also example faith-to meaning connection cut
[5832] That also body basis is element four bind free do cause arise-from

[5834] Speech four is express basis
[5835] Express condition

[5837] Express agent four bind-from free-from
[5838] Now express word self continuum-to speak not possible
[5839] Mind four
[5840] Memory
[5841] Memory not

[5843] Mind exceed four bind-from free
[5844] Now memory think object wheel-to enter not possible
[5845] Thus sign body-to dawn
[5846] Essence speech-to know
[5847] Confidence mind-to correct
[5848] Measure dream-by catch
[5849] Diligence sequence-by
[5850] Great-to dream completely cease
[5851] Habituation great cause arise-from action latency-by benefit harm not
[5852] Middle dream-to dream-to know habituation certain cause arise-from
[5853] Latency good bad conceptuality not-exist
[5854] Low dream good-to become is latency pure taste one-from abandon antidote cause effect action-to avoid need
[5855] Thus abide three
[5856] Mu tig phreng from
[5857] Pure expanse is abide and
[5858] Thus awareness essence abide
[5859] Vision all abide
[5860] Thus
[5861] Third obtain three nail strike
[5862] Outer vision-to power obtain-from vision condition field realm-to free
[5863] Inner illusion body-to power obtain-from dust together luminosity-to free
[5864] Secret awareness-to power obtain-from wind mind delusion exhaust

[5868] Luminosity dawn-from subtle coarse cease
[5869] Expanse awareness dawn-from object mind cease
[5870] Thus
[5871] Fourth confidence four free measure hold
[5872] Hell hot cold suffering see or hear although fear dread not confidence and
[5873] Buddha quality hear although obtain hope and excitement not self place body three complete confidence and
[5874] Action affliction cause result hear although delusion vision samsara fall fear not-from cause result repeat confidence and
[5875] Nirvana self place see although free hope joy not-from primordially-pure self complete certain ground obtain confidence and four arise
[5876] Rinpoche spungs pa tantra from
[5877] Not change view confidence great four-by
[5878] Not return wisdom measure also hold
[5879] Thus
[5880] Thus extreme rely four addition-to
[5881] Vision sixteen-by conclusion gather
[5882] Vision and
[5883] Increase and
[5884] Obtain and
[5885] Near obtain four set each vision four-to enter-from
[5886] Ground sixteen vision complete
[5887] Dharmata manifest vision increase eye
[5888] Near increase eye that itself
[5889] Obtain nadi see
[5890] Near obtain that-to habituation obtain
[5891] Experience increase vision increase light

[5903] Thus vision sixteen-to certain realize person-by self continuum wisdom-to ripen time obtain-from
[5904] Vision sixteen-to certain protector vajra holder-by by-say
[5905] Thus cause and result ground designate sequence sixteen also here light body-to free and

[5912] That-to self vision is recognize
[5913] Ground second stainless obtain
[5914] Then that-to habituation
[5915] Ground third light do ground obtain
[5916] Then that-to habituation-from light vision see is four light emit ground obtain
[5917] Then wisdom vision see that-to habituation-from

[5919] Wisdom see is five purify difficult ground obtain
[5920] Then light-from effulgence body manifest become that is ground six manifest become ground obtain
[5921] Then habituation end arrive-from affliction far go is seven far go ground obtain
[5922] Then that manner-from not move
[5923] Eight not move ground obtain
[5924] Then quality complete
[5925] Nine good intelligence ground obtain
[5926] Then wisdom vision-to self know catch-from vision natural dawn
[5927] Dharma all cloud like see-from habituation
[5928] Ten dharma cloud like ground obtain
[5929] That is person truth see shell this itself not abandon-from obtain
[5930] Person shell abandon those is thus obtain
[5931] Delusion vision cease-from heap vision-to dawn is eleven all light ground obtain
[5932] Then vision that-to also not attach-from outer inner dharma all-by not stain
[5933] Twelve not attach lotus possess ground obtain
[5934] Then self heart-from wisdom ray line dawn-from sky space-from light heap five wheel manner abide
[5935] Thirteen letter wheel great collection ground obtain
[5936] Then wisdom vision-to abide is ground fourteen samadhi great ground obtain
[5937] Then spontaneously-accomplish ground-to certainty obtain is fifteen vajra holder ground obtain
[5938] Then primordially-pure ground-to wisdom natural dawn-from that above other not-exist
[5939] Sixteen wisdom guru ground obtain by-say said
[5940] Those also vision manner-by aspect equal each apply is bodhisattva ground ten actual not
[5941] Ground those also root awareness luminosity purify traverse not ground one vision aspect-from divide
[5942] Meaning-to awareness ground one
[5943] Buddha vajra holder obtain-to cause ground special need not
[5944] Path vital different entry door-to thus apply cause
[5945] Common like cause result sequence-by ground each obtain manner and
[5946] Mantra outer inner like generation completion effort accomplish ground obtain purify not need
[5947] That itself from
