[6388] Thus
[6389] That time outer object-to vision all not-exist vision basis not suddenly
[6390] Inner mind-to concept all dawn free trace not

[6392] These arya ratnakuta-by said

[6394] Mind that outer-to also not observe
[6395] Inner-to also not observe
[6396] Those two both interval-to also not-exist and not observe
[6397] Blue not
[6398] Yellow not is by-say etc.-from
[6399] That-to diligence all among supreme become is mind fully search diligence by-say until said
[6400] Second one and different examine
[6401] Mind house destroy instruction
[6402] That also mind by-say this exist cause what-from arise and
[6403] Not-exist move and memory know wheel this what is and
[6404] Memory know aspect these condition what-to depend-from arise and
[6405] Condition not memory sudden this not suitable and
[6406] If mind this body and one exist body destroy time also destroy become and
[6407] Not-exist follow go return not certain-from body sick mind place-to come and
[6408] Birth before after wheel come suitable not and
[6409] Mind by-say here one is realm one power cease-from realm other also die suitable and
[6410] One not realm form different like realm mind entity different suitable and different body one inside-in insect etc. being those all
[6411] Person one life time do time live suitable and
[6412] If one is body one-to outer inner being number-not-exist come this what is and
[6413] If mind this-to return place exist
[6414] First cause exist need-from
[6415] Cause exist conditioned not permanent-from again destroy-from action-to good bad not suitable and
[6416] Return-place not-exist then being aggregate number-not-exist these come suitable not and
[6417] Mind that various is then realm-to self other thought suddenly come suitable not and
[6418] Mutual intermix from
[6419] Self conquer and
[6420] Not die and
[6421] Suffering not-exist and

[6424] If different is then
[6425] Realm many exist-from

[6427] One only think is then what one die-from all die or
[6428] One born-from all born suitable or
[6429] Thus aspect many door-from self mind-to one and different controversy-from examine search-from
[6430] Any also not-find is dharma-nature primordially pure meaning wisdom power-by realize
[6431] Mind-to cause not-exist return not possible-from action accumulate-to end not-exist faith and
[6432] Mind-to cause exist result come need
[6433] Result samsara is then not pure-from liberate not possible
[6434] Transcended is then samsara come suitable not
[6435] Both is then
[6436] Samsara nirvana different like mind also different become and
[6437] If different then
[6438] Body mind different like memory thought family one-to gather desire also different many become-from
[6439] Family one-to gather-from know
[6440] Also mind-to cause not-exist then mind these suitable not by-say
[6441] These mind cause-from arise not-exist intelligence not is-from
[6442] Mind-from arise not is then mind this itself-to dwell only-to not realize not-exist
[6443] These birth and
[6444] Death and
[6445] Abide etc. exhaust also not is and
[6446] Increase also not is-from
[6447] Scripture-from
[6448] Ignorance illusion-wheel this-to exhaust-not-exist increase not-exist
[6449] By-say and
[6450] Also
[6451] Being realm nature that also end not-exist
[6452] By-say said-from
[6453] Thus cause not-exist-from mind-to increase not-exist realize
[6454] Increase not-exist-from birth not-exist realize
[6455] Birth not-exist-from death not-exist realize
[6456] That know-from action-to also bad not-exist realize
[6457] Condensed-from
[6458] Exist not-exist this two not-exist dharma
[6459] By-say
[6460] Thus primordially from-beginning self empty not-exist know-from
[6461] From-beginning pure-from being birth suitable how become
[6462] By-say arise
[6463] That also mind-to condition not-exist
[6464] Exist then appearance various-to appear like mind also condition-by color etc. various become and
[6465] Mind different-to go-from memory thought one-to not suitable and
[6466] Mind-to condition exist then certainly destroy become-from
[6467] Mind action-result not-exist conclude and
[6468] Mind cease also that action exist then
[6469] Very contradict
[6470] Body color and sense-base good bad all body cease also dwell by-say equal
[6471] Thus illusion like dwell only-by clear
[6472] Condition not-exist then now memory thought various this what-from arise by-say
[6473] Now memory thought this condition-from arise not-exist
[6474] Sudden yesterday dream jewel find-from happy and true hold-from
[6475] Wake then what also not-exist like
[6476] Now memory thought also true hold-from attach although that after-to what also not-exist-from circumstance true-false like appear-from establish not-exist
[6477] Example sky cloud various sudden gather that where go trace not-exist sudden dissolve like equal
[6478] Cloud that sky-to not-exist although that nature-in appear like
[6479] Condition and cause mind-to not-exist although appear appear like time cause condition not-exist one and many and time three examine-from not-exist certain
[6480] Root wisdom-from
[6481] Seed cease and not-cease-from
[6482] Sprout birth not-exist
[6483] You-by dharma all
[6484] Illusion arise like show
[6485] By-say and
[6486] Condition five is exist not-exist
[6487] By-say-from
[6488] All-doing-from also
[6489] Cause and condition not-exist peace supreme path
[6490] By-say etc. explained
[6491] That-from mind exist then
[6492] Entity form-possess-to exist or
[6493] Form not-exist-to exist
[6494] Form-possess-to not-exist exist then power direct-perception-to see suitable-from see suitable not observe direct-perception valid-cognition-by clear
[6495] Form not-exist-to exist then how know
[6496] Movement know by-say
[6497] Movement that need and direction part and
[6498] Past future present three meet examine-from not establish
[6499] Movement before and now movement meet then meet part memory-thought before that now not cease exist need and
[6500] Exist then before is contradict and
[6501] Now before and part that cease conclude and not meet then now memory-thought cause not-exist movement suitable not conclude-from stop
[6502] Movement one is or different
[6503] One then various-to movement lose and
[6504] Different then move-make one is-from lose
[6505] Thus mind exist-to not establish
[6506] Root separate sky like realize-from
[6507] Birth and birth-basis not-exist-from return place not-exist
[6508] Place not-exist then memory-thought before after interval-to face-introduce-from there dissolve-from mind-to basis not-exist recognize
[6509] That know-from return place not-exist faith
[6510] That know-from realm three name not-exist great-to decide
[6511] That dharma-from action virtue vice benefit harm not-exist mind happy
[6512] Also appearance know before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[6513] Mind-to cause and characteristic-to not establish recognize
[6514] That know-from mind itself empty-to identify grasp not-exist faith
[6515] That believe-from mind by-say cause condition-from not arise decide
[6516] That dharma-from memory-thought sudden thought-by benefit harm not-exist mind happy
[6517] Also mind happy
[6518] Also mind before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[6519] Mind-to root not-exist recognize
[6520] That know-from mind itself one wheel-to elaboration different not-exist faith
[6521] That believe-from made dharma-by buddha not become decide
[6522] That cut-from mind not-exist meaning-from not realize side not-exist-from mind happy
[6523] Also dharma-nature before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[6524] Mind-to birth not-exist recognize
[6525] That know-from propensity body all-ground-by not harm faith
[6526] That believe-from now mind birth not possible decide
[6527] That dharma-from now mind house cease and return place and return-support not-exist mind happy
[6528] Thus mind search time four measure grasp-from
[6529] Buddha not-exist-from buddha name only-to also not-exist
[6530] Result-to hope hold mind turn
[6531] That turn-from path effort exertion-to make dharma not-exist
[6532] Thus not-exist dharma-to what also not-exist-from samsara nirvana-to designate name only-from meaning-to not find-to liberate measure by-say
[6533] That-from mind itself not-exist-to what also not-exist-from
[6534] Mind-to cause reason not-exist-from see not-exist and
[6535] Thus not-exist face-introduce four turn and
[6536] Dharma-possessor sixteen-to realize
[6537] Mind house destroy
[6538] Example child house build destroy like
[6539] That also action-by action destroy iron-by iron destroy like and
[6540] Not permanent-by not permanent destroy illusion person-by illusion city destroy like and
[6541] Made-by not permanent destroy corpse-on corpse stack like and
[6542] Not permanent-by made destroy wisdom now-by ignorance before destroy like
[6543] Thus mind-by mind destroy-from both track not-exist-to dissolve water-on letter write like and
[6544] Not-exist-by not-exist search also not find poor house-in wish-fulfilling jewel not-exist search-also find place not-exist like equal
[6545] Mind not-exist-to destroy place not-exist
[6546] Example dissolve time water-to hold place not-exist like
[6547] That-from mind not-exist meaning not know-from
[6548] View meditation conduct mind-to search
