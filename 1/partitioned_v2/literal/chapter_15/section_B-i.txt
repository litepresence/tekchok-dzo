[5453] Exhaust is empty
[5454] Mind meditation object vision together self-reverse-from not-exist
[5455] Not observe by-say
[5456] That itself from

[5466] Thus
[5467] Nature
[5468] Outer inner vision mind exhaust sky blue-grey resonance like primordially-pure self-resonance merely-to activity
[5469] Rtsal rdzogs from
[5470] This time exhaust characteristic
[5471] Action-free sky like thus
[5472] Thus
[5473] Dharmata-to two-from
[5474] Vision dharmata
[5475] Outer inner dust together exhaust-from channel wind exhaust
[5476] That exhaust-from mind-to depend latency all-from arise characteristic defilement subtle seed part those also exhaust
[5477] Continuity samadhi-to abide-through dharmata wheel-from not pass

[5479] All-ground subtle knowable obscuration very cut white silk curtain merely-by cut except obscuration not-exist-from
[5480] Path dharma exhaust result by-say
[5481] That clear-from Buddha obscuration all separate-from inner expanse primordially-pure dharmakaya-to enter very peace
[5482] Thal 'gyur from
[5483] Self-Buddha cease dharmata
[5484] Element cease-from dust cease
[5485] Dust and particle end cease-from
[5486] Part merely also abide not

[5490] Dust part merely also not abide
[5491] Thus subtle coarse cease-from
[5492] Aggregate five also end gradual subtle
[5493] Element four body exhaust-from
[5494] All wisdom Sambhogakaya
[5495] Concept-free samadhi self-abide
[5496] Fabricate aggregate-from exceed-from

[5498] Thus
[5499] Empty dharmata
[5500] Channel wind coarse exhaust-from mind mental-events exhaust
[5501] Body and wisdom vision aspect measure-arrive moon full like-also inner expanse-to set-from primordially-pure vision-to abide-from
[5502] Dharmakaya vision core result dharmata self-vision by-say express
[5503] Again before from
[5504] Cause and result dharmata

[5513] Result dharmata is think
[5514] Thus
[5515] That-also word later this three-to delusion-from
[5516] Result primordially-pure-to body and wisdom not-exist think Nyingtigpa arise-from
[5517] That error great
[5518] Outer vision resonance body and wisdom crystal light inward return like part-to thus say that intention not understand merely
[5519] Meaning-to inner expanse-to not-exist spontaneous-accomplishment contradict and
[5520] Unconditioned is-from future not-exist completely perish-to go contradict and
[5521] Again expanse-from body and wisdom dawn basis-from beings benefit arise contradict and
[5522] Samantabhadra basis expanse pure end arrive-from beings and Buddha-to path show compassion and action show contradict etc. fault many exist-from
[5523] Fault such accept suitable not
[5524] Fifth boundary

[5528] That-also body form that now beings benefit actual extensive not arise
[5529] Finger light-to awareness focus-from
[5530] Outer vision and
[5531] Self body light-clear all inner expanse-to increasingly dissolve-to go
[5532] Direct entity-vision blue pure merely-from
[5533] Light body-to fade crystal light inward dissolve like
[5534] Body and vision self-resonance also reverse
[5535] Inner clear spontaneously-accomplish jewel shell-in body and wisdom depth resonance merely-to awareness abide
[5536] Outer vision blue-in vision part merely also not-exist crystal mirror self-lucid-to shadow like abide
[5537] Awareness dharmakaya-to Buddha coiled
[5538] Outer vision-to inward return body that Buddha action equal not accomplish sign
[5539] That-also birth and enter control-from awareness beings-to compassion focus-from whatever not-exist primordially-pure vision that self-reverse-from
[5540] Delusion vision vision this mirror reflection like vision
[5541] Self body that also water moon like wisdom illusion body-to self-vision copper-shining-from element harm separate vajra body obtain
[5542] Beings benefit-to transfer great body arise by-say
[5543] Other eye not-pure-from dust together merely-from copper-shining-to not see
[5544] Master great Vimala and
[5545] Padma like
[5546] Then birth and enter two control obtain-from
[5547] Momentary Buddha although delay exist
[5548] Beings benefit samsara not empty until do although self-power possess
[5549] Birth control
[5550] Inner expanse-to enter occasion beings three-thousand-to awareness enter all time one-to free power great obtain
[5551] Insects also light-to cease
[5552] Birth control obtain-from whatever desire emanate-from beings benefit spontaneously-accomplish do
[5553] Enter control
[5554] Inert-to awareness enter although move and sound make do
[5555] Lotus and wishing tree and jewel etc.-from dharma sound arise-from beings all ripen and
[5556] Food clothes rain make do
[5557] That-also birth and enter control this two exhaust follow inner expanse-to enter occasion not-there obtain-from
[5558] Beings benefit-to inward not return bardo beings three-thousand instantaneous free make-from expanse-to enter
[5559] Do birth control-from inward return gradual three-thousand free make-from
[5560] Birth enter many kalpa field dust number-to beings benefit whatever do
[5561] Earth treasure and
[5562] Jewel and
[5563] Dharma classification etc.-from time long some benefit accomplish although that means-to momentary also pass not-exist-from
[5564] Other-from compassion wonder arise and activity vision enter cause
[5565] Our guru holy Vimala and Padmakara very sublime such rely those this or bardo without-doubt free certain
[5566] Manner these secret conduct seed tantra from
[5567] Inner body exhaust ground arrive time
[5568] Finger etc. thus vision
[5569] This focus element self cease
[5570] Birth and enter difference-by
[5571] Dharma all exhaust self ground-to
[5572] What also hold not
[5573] Abide is emanation body
[5574] This-by enter power control
[5575] Birth self-power who obtain
[5576] That also that-to focus-from
[5577] Again time thus do time
[5578] Vision self-sound rustling
[5579] Manifest reverse delusion vision
[5580] This-by beings benefit all do
[5581] Awareness equal one cause
[5582] Thousand three beings
[5583] Transfer great this accomplish
[5584] Thus gradual and instantaneous
[5585] Body this-by accomplish
[5586] That all body exhaust measure-from free
[5587] This all result certain
[5588] Ground supreme mandala great accomplish
[5589] Thus
[5590] Thus vision four dawn that also path arise sequence by-say
[5591] Example ladder rung like
[5592] That also path abide part-from dawn agent not cease
[5593] Path obtain part-from what also not establish not-exist
[5594] Thus vision four measure arrive-from this itself contaminated not vision Buddha-from
[5595] Vehicle common those-from especially sublime-from
[5596] Dharma this meet-from diligence practice do-to effort do
[5597] That itself-to
[5598] Buddha accomplish desire person-by
[5599] This means possess thus thus
[5600] Other conduct pride do itself is-from
[5601] Entity see not
[5602] That cause this all rare word
[5603] Always jewel treasure this look
[5604] Thus
[5605] Meaning four extreme rely instruction four above those support back support or closely arise
[5606] That also unmoving three speech-to basis establish
[5607] Vow three measure hold
[5608] Obtain three nail strike
[5609] Confidence four free measure show those
[5610] Thal 'gyur from
[5611] That-to extreme rely faith do
[5612] Unmoving three-to basis establish-from
[5613] Wind mind vital-to arrive
[5614] Abide three measure hold-from
[5615] Dream reverse and body speech mind
[5616] Sign and measure certain hold
[5617] Obtain three nail strike-from
[5618] Contaminated aggregate not vision
[5619] Thus and
[5620] Mu tig phreng ba from
[5621] Measure is confidence four yogin itself
[5622] Thus
[5623] First unmoving three-by basis establish-from nirvana basis seal
[5624] Body unmoving three-by vital press and
[5625] Speech unmoving three-by path clear and
[5626] Mind unmoving three-by gorge wrap coil
[5627] First body unmoving three-to
