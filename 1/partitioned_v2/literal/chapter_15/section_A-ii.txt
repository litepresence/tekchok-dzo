[4836] Each-one and
[4837] Three-bind interval vision until that
[4838] Previous from
[4839] Then point see
[4840] Thus it is said
[4841] That-also outer luminous-clear look cause inner conceptuality separate equal limitless liberate
[4842] Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance and
[4843] Spontaneous-completion light-resonance two outer-inner pair connect cause
[4844] Dhatu-awareness gathering-separate not-existing intent called
[4845] Third vision four dawning sequence two
[4846] Essence briefly show and
[4847] Nature extensively explain
[4848] First
[4849] Vision four all time body posture abide
[4850] Eye gaze manner gaze
[4851] Wind-awareness mode slow three main-point harmonize
[4852] Particularly vision first two purify later two effort rely mode purify
[4853] Luminous-clear liberate therefore dhatu-awareness non-dual called
[4854] These main-point awareness vajra hanging-cord separate not-do main-point arise
[4855] That meaning explain
[4856] Awareness essence nature compassion three not-differentiable base-abide and that resonance light channel pure vision from golden thread like coil curve interval point bind
[4857] Vajra buddhas sentient-beings all essence good-bad not-existing equal unchanging abide part place
[4858] Lu example water channel good from water increase decrease not-existing emerge similar
[4859] Body and wisdom increase opening various path-vision complete until that from dawning cause
[4860] Gu that inside dharmata not-mistaken view and meditation pull cause
[4861] Rgyud samsara-nirvana pervade vision those collections from
[4862] Body and
[4863] Point radiate and
[4864] Arise and
[4865] Gather etcetera clear cause
[4866] From Thalgyur
[4867] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[4868] That-from vision four become
[4869] Dharmata direct vision cause
[4870] Intellect grasp view suppress
[4871] Experience-vision above increase cause
[4872] Delusion vision cease cause
[4873] Awareness measure arrive vision cause
[4874] Three-bodies realize path-vision transcend
[4875] Dharmata exhaust vision cause
[4876] Three-realms samsara stream cut
[4877] Thus it is said
[4878] That-also vision four number determine outer sun-moon time four increase decrease and
[4879] Inner body speech mind four binding-from liberate and
[4880] Secret empowerment four determination show and
[4881] Actual lamp four vision determine rely four determine
[4882] Sequence determine
[4883] First base dharmata direct not-see remaining three dawning base not-existing basis and supported base first dharmata direct vision dawning
[4884] That same dawn cause dharmas all meaning see self-arisen wisdom self-from find called
[4885] Then direct that experience not-experience word only fruit not-arise cause
[4886] Meaning experience cause that experience above increase arise
[4887] Thus experience arisen measure firm make need
[4888] Not-firm experience end not-existing dharmas possess not-existing and
[4889] Buddha expand cause not-arise cause
[4890] Experience firm measure arrive cause
[4891] Awareness measure arrive vision arise
[4892] Awareness vision measure arrive though that-from other not-change three-bodies fruit desire difference not-existing
[4893] Actual vision mark dharmas fruit meaning hope ordinary and difference not-existing cause
[4894] Vision experience base dissolve
[4895] Subtle coarse vision holding cease-from
[4896] Pure dharmata exhaust experience dharmata exhaust vision arise
[4897] Those also first two nirmanakaya
[4898] Measure arrive sambhogakaya
[4899] Exhaust dharmakaya vision path make three-bodies path-vision dawn fruit dharmata exhaust pure dhatu arrive cause
[4900] Self-vision potency three-bodies awareness mode dissolve cause
[4901] Awareness pure fruit
[4902] Awareness dhatu-from originally self-potency three-bodies dawn fruit function called

[4906] Second individual nature extensively explain four
[4907] Dharmata direct
[4908] Experience above increase
[4909] Awareness measure arrive
[4910] Dharmata exhaust vision extensively explain
[4911] First two
[4912] Direct general connection place and
