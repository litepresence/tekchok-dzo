[3922] Now, again, for those free from elaborations, the good path of rigpa self-appearance, the secret great vajra essence, is shown in two aspects:
[3923] The manner of being definitely superior through surpassing the common vehicle,
[3924] And explaining the path itself which possesses distinctions.
[3925] First:
[3926] Surpassing through seven piths.
[3927] Other paths, through great wisdom, quickly realize and liberate; those of small wisdom do not liberate. This path sees through the pith of sense-powers, and effort great or small alone—sense-powers sharp or dull—does not constitute the pith.
[3928] Others, through intellect confidence in self-dharmatā, throw emptiness meditation like a dark stone. This mind, not relying on intellect, directly exists like direct perception—thus not relying on intellect is the pith.
[3929] Others rely progressively on expressing words, hoping to primordially realize meaning. This, not relying on a single word-letter, directly sees meaning—thus words do not make Buddha, which is the pith.
[3930] Others, making the meaning of self-natural-state a mind-object, rely on time to distinguish ground, path, and fruit. This, directly becoming self-clear, does not rely on mind-made thought's ground and path—thus Buddha is the pith.
[3931] Others, relying before and after on cause-effect, seek enlightenment elsewhere. This, not relying on good or bad actions of cause-effect, self-dawns enlightenment—thus effort and accept-reject do not exist, which is the pith.
[3932] Others, relying on channels, winds, bindus, etcetera, spread youth-time to accomplish enlightenment. Aging, power exhausts, not liberating. This, self-arising clear light sun-moon dawning from within, possesses effort—thus aging old-young does not exist, which is the razor pith.
[3933] Others rely on regarding the final fruit as three bodies. This, the three bodies dawning as path-appearance, final clear light primordially-pure vastness spontaneously-accomplishes rigpa's definite establishment—this is the pith.
[3934] Others, through intellect confidence in self-dharmatā, throw emptiness meditation like a dark stone. This mind, not relying on intellect, directly exists—thus not relying on intellect is the pith.
[3935] Others rely progressively on expressing words, hoping to primordially realize meaning. This, not relying on a single word, directly sees meaning—thus words do not make Buddha, which is the pith.
[3936] Others, making self-natural-state meaning a mind-object, rely on time to distinguish ground, path, and fruit. This, directly becoming self-clear, does not rely on mind-made ground and path—thus Buddha is the pith.
[3937] Others, relying before and after on cause-effect, seek enlightenment elsewhere. This, not relying on cause-effect good-bad action, self-dawns enlightenment—thus effort and accept-reject do not exist, which is the pith.
[3938] Others, relying on channels, winds, bindus, etcetera, spread youth-time to accomplish enlightenment. Aging, power exhausts, not liberating. This, self-arising clear light sun-moon dawning within, possesses effort—thus aging old-young does not exist, which is the razor pith.
