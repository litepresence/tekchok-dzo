[3018] Is certainty taken self-experience.
[3019] Second, actual—three:
[3020] Dharmata-meaning point,
[3021] Means, and—
[3022] Focus point,
[3023] Channel-wind binding point.
[3024] From three: train, transform, cut.
[3025] Meditate all three—very difficult, and—
[3026] Yet also said whichever one enough—easy, two medium.
[3027] Train all in practice when do guide this—meditate all time.
[3028] First train dream—day appearances all—last night's dreamed dream—clear aspiration—made emanate-transform, and.
[3029] Train outer truth-without time—training-rigpa look—arise-arise base-without, root-free nature—naked, clearly meditate.
[3030] All fixation-without, truth-without, base-without, recognition-without—recognize appearances' nature—one-pointed—meditate without losing effort-force—appearances only—actually illusion-dream arise—karma, latency, deluded-appearance, deluded-grasping all cease.
[3031] And arise without distraction from that state within dream.
[3032] Day-night dharmata-wheel—not beyond.
[3033] Dream-transform from appearance-emptiness two.
[3034] Appearance-transform point—depend made upon showing deity-form in mirror, and.
[3035] Transform all appearances to deity's mandala, and—
[3036] Transform to Buddha's realm, and—
[3037] Do by fierce aspiration transforming illusion's eight-examples.
[3038] Transform emptiness—like smoke clearing, cloud gathering in sky.
[3039] Moment-emptiness deluded-appearance—wide flat flat meditate.
[3040] Become that thus within dream.
[3041] Upon this itself how appear time—dream cut.
[3042] Not establish rigpa-hold top intermediate-space.
[3043] Not hold appearance form-reflection top here-rig.
[3044] Not confused by thought of connection between appearance-mind two.
[3045] Whatever mind not do—vast release inner-clear self-clear rigpa.
[3046] Made thus—first dream coarse.
[3047] Then subtle.
[3048] Then fade.
[3049] Gone increasingly few, finally anything not dream—practice meaning day-night mixed self-clear rigpa concentration—meditation called day-night union.
[3050] Upon second means-focus point:
[3051] Stir, and—
[3052] Squeeze.
[3053] From three: throw point.
[3054] First point—dream use time, not held, not mastered—held mastered.
[3055] Easy mastered—train mixed-mixed by stirring mutual reverse of meditated.
[3056] Also accomplish by stirring sequence of placed wind-mind in wheels four's place.
[3057] Squeeze—throat hide mind, squeeze channel by lion-sleep way body-point, focus squeeze.
[3058] Dream squeeze—sleep without other-thought distraction.
[3059] Throw point—fierce aspiration reach oral-instruction point.
[3060] Think red-A white-lotus four-petals center in throat center sleep time, and.
[3061] Contract channel-waves, sleep that state, by.
[3062] Other not profound than this point—dream arise.
[3063] Train that, and—
[3064] Stir, and—
[3065] Transform, and—
[3066] Squeeze, and—
[3067] Supreme precious combine three—cut, point, throw.
[3068] Accomplish great experience this point—explained three stir squeeze point throw wheel channel place, occasion here.
[3069] Third, channel-wind binding point.
[3070] Precious companion all dream time.
[3071] Also point enter wind-drop net.
[3072] Think dissolve recollection-wheel nose all samsara-nirvana appearance-existence, project slowly wind lion-sleep way time, and.
[3073] Draw wind inner.
[3074] And place focus clear bright like mirror form-reflection heart bliss state all appearance fall drop HAM crown.
[3075] Train again-again, and.
[3076] Reverse upward all appearance to throat's wheel, and.
[3077] Hold mind become one red-A, and.
[3078] Secret great point this—sleep holding throat wind-essence.
[3079] Become wake delusion—finally cease dream-latency by thus point-bound.
[3080] Possible dream cease—though focus all complete not—great effort this time.
[3081] And quickly hold dream medium.
[3082] Finally cease—become virtue-latency finally.
[3083] Go finally few from many dream first—those.
[3084] Little fade dream first—great effort.
[3085] And very clear dream medium.
[3086] Arise many unclear finally.
[3087] Held first—those.
[3088] Become virtue middle.
[3089] Called dream clear-light wake—become sleep clear-light time finally dream cease.
[3090] From Thalgyur:
[3091] Dream-point path-take.
[3092] First place point empowerment.
[3093] First train body-speech-mind.
[3094] And depend mastered signs.
[3095] Suppress and examine.
[3096] Hold certainty latency three.
[3097] Time reach point then.
[3098] Cut and transform, train.
[3099] Throw point, squeeze, stir.
[3100] By made karma-point draw-reverse.
[3101] And finally cease karma-dream.
[3102] Extract root latency-delusion.
[3103] By self-effort this time.
[3104] Know medium, cease great.
[3105] Certainly change finally.
[3106] Many first dream—those.
[3107] Finally stop fade great.
[3108] Upon very clear medium.
[3109] Know is finally.
[3110] Change then unclear finally.
[3111] Reach measure all those.
[3112] Thus it is.
[3113] Instruction transform confusion to clear-light—this dream-point.
[3114] From that:
[3115] Who meditates sleep-yoga.
[3116] By this, confusion is made into the path.
[3117] Thus it is.
[3118] Third, the illusory body: making appearance-existence into the yoga of illusion.
[3119] Herein, daytime training of the illusory body upon reflection, and.
[3120] Nighttime training of the illusory body in dream—two aspects.
[3121] First: appearance of reflection arising in mirror, and.
[3122] Upon these outer-inner phenomena difference not existing.
[3123] Holding as true—what use?
[3124] All are illusion-reflection appearance—knowing this with non-distracted aspiration, meditate whatever appears as illusion-reflection, and.
[3125] Especially upon one's own form appearing in mirror.
[3126] Putting on clothes, and.
[3127] Putting ornaments, and.
[3128] Removing those, throwing outside, and.
[3129] Praising, and.
[3130] Disparaging, etcetera—doing these.
[3131] Though that form appears there, like meaning not established.
[3132] Upon this appearance—self-other.
[3133] Enemy-friend.
[3134] Food-clothing.
[3135] Enjoyment.
[3136] Pleasant-unpleasant.
[3137] Denial-affirmation.
[3138] Birth-death.
[3139] Happiness-suffering.
[3140] Sickness-pain.
[3141] Whatever arises, remembers, appears—all samsara-nirvana phenomena like reflections inside mirror, knowing essence not existent from time of appearance itself.
[3142] Mastering deluded-appearance truthless illusion-nature.
[3143] Seeing own body also as illusion-body, without doubt holding bardo illusory-body.
[3144] As said in the Ljonpa-asked Sutra:
[3145] Upon completely pure mirror-mandala.
[3146] Like face-reflection appearing.
[3147] How nature not established.
[3148] Ljonpa, know phenomena.
[3149] Thus said, and.
[3150] From Arya Samadhiraja Sutra:
[3151] How night-water-moon.
[3152] Though appearing in clear defilement-not-exist lake.
[3153] Water-moon empty hollow essence not exist.
[3154] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3155] How people many midst.
[3156] Illusionist by forms emanate and.
[3157] Horse elephant chariot various make.
[3158] Like various appearance not-true upon that.
[3159] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3160] How water-field moist tree.
[3161] Though person cuts that for desire of essence.
[3162] Inside and outside—all essence not exist.
[3163] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3164] Thus it is.
[3165] Second, nighttime training illusory-body in dream: knowing all appearance as dream like before, training mastery all appearance-existence as illusion-dream.
[3166] Mastering birth-death, denial-affirmation, all deluded-appearance as dream-illusion.
[3167] In dream also thus arising, attachment sesame-grain not exist.
[3168] Again from that:
[3169] How in young girl's dream.
[3170] Seeing son arise and die.
[3171] Joy upon arising, not-joy upon dying—like this.
[3172] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3173] Thus it is.
[3174] At this time path-application virtues arise in self.
[3175] From Abhisamayalankara:
[3176] In dream also all phenomena.
[3177] View as dream-like, etcetera.
[3178] Sign of application reaching peak.
[3179] Taught as twelve aspects.
[3180] Thus it is.
[3181] Thus training illusory-body daytime-nighttime.
[3182] True-attachment to deluded-appearance not exist, and.
[3183] Seeing body also as transparent, shadow-form-like appearance, truth-not-exist.
[3184] Shadow not exist upon body, and.
[3185] Holding bardo illusory-body, becoming final-existence person.
[3186] Like holy precious lama Gyalwa Zhangton and scholar Nyibum.
[3187] Those also from Thalgyur:
[3188] Train illusory-body dream.
[3189] By that mastery, body itself also.
[3190] Become like shadow-form.
[3191] By that intermediate body.
[3192] These become self-held.
[3193] Thus it is.
[3194] Fourth, practicing depending on instruction of four-times equal-application to clear-light.
[3195] Outer four-times equal-application holding channel-wind in channel.
[3196] Inner four-times equal-application instruction expression cease.
[3197] Secret four-times equal-application instruction mind unmodified settle.
[3198] That-ness four-times equal-application instruction clear-light mother-son unite.
[3199] From that:
[3200] From outer four times.
[3201] Train mastery yoga-body, and.
[3202] Point: hold all channels in source.
[3203] By inner four times.
[3204] Train mastery yoga-speech, and.
[3205] Point: cut all expression-ornaments.
[3206] Also by secret four times.
[3207] Train mastery yoga-mind, and.
[3208] Point is familiar with sleep.
[3209] By that-ness four times.
[3210] Gather body and speech-mind by that.
[3211] Mix great clear-light sleep.
[3212] Thus familiar, apply certainty to three kayas.
[3213] Yogi.
[3214] Thus it is.
[3215] Those practice methods extensive, clear in Four Times Equal Application.
[3216] Here, summarizing points of clear-light four-times equal-application to teach—four aspects.
[3217] Daytime: apply seal to appearance.
[3218] Dusk: gather senses to place.
[3219] Midnight: put knowable in vase.
[3220] Dawn: make wisdom clear.
[3221] First, from two: samadhi and post-meditation.
[3222] Samadhi: mixing sleep, hold wind gently with lion-sleep method, and.
[3223] Not blinking eye, holding mind on five-light mass inside heart, sleep by.
[3224] Time outer appearance gradually diminishing.
[3225] Sleep and dream gap, one clear thought-not-exist consciousness exists—that recognize as clear-light, and.
[3226] Sleep by not dull in that state, sleep clear-light arise.
[3227] Dream not exist.
[3228] Consciousness self-clear in samadhi state.
[3229] Gone to sleep, know near form-sound-smell aspects not cease, and.
[3230] Not gone, arise wake from that state by condition, and.
[3231] Day appearance, only thought cease, appearance aspect itself clear.
[3232] That also, six-aggregate mind-consciousness cease, and.
[3233] Five-door consciousness not cease, clear.
[3234] Time mind-consciousness dissolve into clear-light, wind enters central, and.
[3235] Five-door consciousness thought-not-exist, though object appears, not gone to grasp power.
[3236] Called clear thought-not-exist clear.
[3237] This time bliss clear-light exist in samadhi state.
[3238] Clear clear-light exist not-cease appearance.
[3239] Thought-not-exist clear-light, thought-not-exist self-abide exist in that state by.
[3240] In ground-nature clear-light primordially-pure.
[3241] Child self-clear clear-light mix two-not-exist, and.
[3242] Called clear-light mother-child mix by wisdom-clear also clear arise.
[3243] From Thalgyur:
[3244] By great clear-light transference.
[3245] Train sleep samadhi, and.
[3246] Outer appearance clear daytime-nighttime not-different by mastery.
[3247] This accomplishes great clear-light.
[3248] Thus it is.
[3249] Bliss clear-light exist in simultaneous-joy time of equipoise-nature.
[3250] Clear clear-light exist day-night mix samadhi time.
[3251] Thought-not-exist clear-light exist time mind grasp-thought dissolve.
[3252] Also exist other time, recognize difficult, and.
[3253] That time example clear, easy know meaning.
[3254] From bliss clear-light not able separate samadhi, experience arise appearance joy-bliss arise.
[3255] From clear clear-light: smoke, and.
[3256] Mirage, and.
[3257] Firefly, and.
[3258] Cloud, and.
[3259] Lightning, and.
[3260] Flame, and.
[3261] Moon, and.
[3262] Rahu, and.
[3263] Jewel black form, and.
[3264] Light-five appearance, and.
[3265] Drop, and.
[3266] Deity-form, and.
[3267] Sentient-being, and.
[3268] See many pure-land, and.
[3269] See form though coarse cut, and.
[3270] Able go through meditation-hall wall fence, etcetera, and.
[3271] Many eye-clairvoyance arise.
[3272] Thought-not-exist clear-light samadhi sign-mix, and.
[3273] Whatever-appear look time, thought-not-exist ease go, and.
[3274] Any speech non-dual thought-not-exist go, and.
[3275] Arise immeasurable experience think always dwell sky state.
[3276] These profound points, experience certainty establish manifest by valid-cognition.
[3277] Samadhi not mix sleep, sit cross-legged, and.
[3278] Put blinking eye to space, consciousness half-essence time.
[3279] Little lower eye, direct look, one experience trace arise.
[3280] Recognize that, meditate in state.
[3281] Awareness self-clear sky-like clear, that is clear clear-light, and.
[3282] That experience: familiar in that state, appearance-mind pervade not-exist, become like one sky.
[3283] Think exist in sky space, and.
[3284] Arise immeasurable think body-mind separate sometimes, etcetera.
[3285] That time also arise countless rainbow-light drop form appearance.
[3286] Called color clear-light, wind-five clear self-essence outer.
[3287] See self body particle inner organ, appear like day-night, and.
[3288] See also other body inside, pure-land, country place, sentient-being action do, death-transition, birth take.
[3289] Second post-meditation, called rise from samadhi, is.
[3290] Rise from that state, view these outer appearances light-five form, instantly sentient-being grass-tree arise appearance.
[3291] View illusion eight-example, and.
[3292] View like sky, and.
[3293] Correct point: train one pervade grasp-not-exist empty-clear appearance, mix with now what experience.
[3294] Second, dusk: gather senses to place.
[3295] Sit cross-legged, from secret to Brahma-aperture, central inside white-A hollow piled like exist, all upward one one dissolve, meditate until Brahma son aperture, and.
[3296] Finally place mind in all sky state.
[3297] Third, midnight: put knowable in vase.
[3298] Sleep, lion-sleep method, put light-five lamp inside heart, sleep.
[3299] Fourth, dawn: make wisdom clear.
[3300] Put upward lion gaze, and.
[3301] By holding mind on one white-A hovering in sky bow-length from crown.
[3302] First clear A, then that also not-exist, other thought not-change, arise clear half-essence, meditate in that state.
[3303] These very important points by experience, very effort do.
[3304] Fifth, transference: three aspects.
[3305] Great: clear-light transference.
[3306] Medium: illusory-body transference.
[3307] Finally: body-speech transference.
[3308] That is not three transference places.
[3309] Three capacities of transference-doer.
[3310] Some apply three transference, other is.
[3311] Here, if self masters clear-light, death-time from that state extract awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmadhatu.
[3312] If master illusory-body, death-time from illusory-body state project awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmata meaning deity-form, hold bardo illusory-body, buddha.
[3313] If those two not mastered, depend body-speech-mind three points channel-wind, transference to Brahma-aperture, and.
[3314] From Thalgyur:
[3315] Three aspect transference types.
[3316] By sense distinction.
[3317] Clear-light and illusory-body and.
[3318] Upon finally body-speech mind.
[3319] Thus it is.
[3320] Support-have channel-wind dependent-origination action depend transference, and.
[3321] Two: support-not mind focus only transference, actual transference and actual-not transference said, and.
[3322] From Thalgyur:
[3323] Two aspect body-speech transference.
[3324] Actual transference and actual-not.
[3325] Actual: wind train method.
[3326] Sound craft illusion-skill and.
[3327] By train dependent relate.
[3328] By individual element internal harmony.
[3329] Accomplish body-speech-mind focus.
[3330] Actual-not: show mind familiar power.
[3331] Thus it is.
[3332] Brahma-aperture is transference path.
[3333] From Four Vajra Seats:
[3334] From upper nine apertures.
[3335] If immediately do mind transference.
[3336] Day like kill Brahmin, and.
[3337] Also do five borderless.
[3338] Without doubt become liberated this.
[3339] Thus it is.
[3340] Sixth, two: union bardo instruction.
[3341] Point of union realization by practicing this life, and.
[3342] Actual bardo instruction.
[3343] First is.
[3344] Though generally many bardo distinctions, regarding need upon this occasion.
[3345] Birth-death bardo.
[3346] Dream bardo.
[3347] Dharmata bardo.
[3348] From four chapters: existence bardo and.
[3349] Train capacity instruction first two.
[3350] Illusory-body clear-light point daytime, and.
[3351] By familiar with bardo arise manner.
[3352] Certainty measure bardo liberate master in dream.
[3353] If that also summarize point one.
[3354] Especially not abandon exist.
[3355] Especially not establish not-exist.
[3356] Not attach obvious to exist.
[3357] Not do sad-thought to not-exist.
[3358] Do-place, good-bad, appearance-manner, and.
[3359] Upon whatever grasp-thought.
[3360] Not cut past trace.
[3361] Not welcome future before.
[3362] Not depend on continuum present latency with antidote.
[3363] Stretched not-stretched.
[3364] Puffed not-puffed.
[3365] Hesitant not-hesitant.
[3366] By practice appearance mind-touch trace-not arise appearance.
[3367] Liberate appearance-moment appearance.
[3368] Liberate grasp thing.
[3369] That also liberate appearance-moment.
[3370] Like bird take trace.
[3371] Liberate move-moment move.
[3372] Trace not self-dissolve.
[3373] That also like space hail dissolve.
[3374] Liberate two-not-exist appearance consciousness.
[3375] Boundary not-exist outer-inner.
[3376] That also like water dissolve water.
[3377] Thus realize, cut latency attachment, and.
[3378] From Klongchenpa Six:
[3379] Whatever person not cut past trace.
[3380] Not raise future hope.
[3381] If put present consciousness place.
[3382] Mix not-exist before-after, and.
[3383] Called what essence one-gathered, yogi realize time-three equal.
[3384] Thus it is.
[3385] Second is actual bardo instruction.
[3386] Earth water fire wind space gradually dissolve, and.
[3387] Time space dissolve into clear-light.
[3388] Upward Ha and downward A two gather heart, bliss-clear thought-not-exist clear-light.
[3389] Appearance, and.
[3390] Increase, and.
[3391] Attain, and.
[3392] Four wisdoms: near-attain, moment one, and.
[3393] Two and three and.
[3394] Arise four, and.
[3395] Yogis familiar with clear-light before recognize that, clear-light mother-child mix, and.
[3396] Moment upward transparent in primordially-pure dharmakaya dharmadhatu.
[3397] For those not recognize there, existence bardo, medium senses arise deity illusory-body, liberate.
[3398] Finally continue good, and.
[3399] Certainty liberate meeting supreme dharma future.
[3400] From Mayajala:
[3401] Though not obtain liberation this birth.
[3402] Obtain liberation existence other birth.
[3403] Thus it is.
[3404] Also said future liberate those with faith in that-ness common path, and.
[3405] From Four-Eight:
[3406] If know that here.
[3407] Though not obtain nirvana.
[3408] Effort not other birth.
[3409] Like law certainty obtain become.
[3410] Like thus said.
[3411] With elaboration of those, Mahayana samadhi explained complete.
[3412] Third, from two Sugata intentions.
[3413] Briefly teach is.
[3414] From Rangshar:
[3415] Sugata intention is.
[3416] Know sky expanse.
[3417] Also become familiar that.
[3418] Spontaneous arise wisdom appearance.
[3419] Correct path also thus.
[3420] Thus it is.
[3421] Extensively explain is.
[3422] Upon sun-moon union.
[3423] Two Sugata intentions.
[3424] Sensation cease by not-modify place.
[3425] Obtain warmth measure by not-meditate look.
[3426] Thus it is.
[3427] That also: dharmata mother appearance, not spread gather hope, great boundary-not-exist samadhi-post-meditation intention, gap-not river-continuum yoga.
[3428] Is place one become space, not distracted not-distracted, nature end-middle not-exist sky.
[3429] This time called daytime-nighttime union meditation.
[3430] Daytime pass portion.
[3431] Nighttime samsara portion.
[3432] By arise not distinguish daytime-nighttime difference.
[3433] Daytime meditation experience clear cause not exist.
[3434] Is gradually gone nighttime unclear not exist.
[3435] Two meaning: that instruction ocean relax method.
[3436] Call ocean eye water essence.
[3437] Called ocean relax by place that not move.
[3438] That also: not meditate not meditate.
[3439] Point is gazing not blinking eye beyond meditate do.
[3440] By do thus, like ocean not stain by grasp object not exist, appear object exist spread relax all whatever appear reflection etcetera planet ocean example.
[3441] Though appear appearance face, outer appearance arise measure yogi eye path.
[3442] By not stain, grasp object not exist, consciousness not lose appearance moment.
[3443] Outer appearance not stain consciousness.
[3444] Inner consciousness not grasp appearance.
[3445] Called spontaneous meditation six-aggregate, liberate object grasp grasp-not-exist, cut relate appearance consciousness.
[3446] This actual meditation, and.
[3447] From two: cut error place.
[3448] Actual: gather wind-mind point, put consciousness self-place, is.
[3449] From Thalgyur:
[3450] Upon mind settle meditation called.
[3451] Is cut outer-inner move.
[3452] Grasp grasp cease.
[3453] Said, and.
[3454] From letter not exist.
[3455] Relax itself self-arise not modify primordially.
[3456] Mind not modify appearance not change.
[3457] Show intention dwell dharmata sky.
[3458] Abandon all thought dharmakaya wisdom, and.
[3459] Is meditation intention move do not exist.
[3460] If not hold focus direction.
[3461] Like planet arise ocean.
[3462] Clear aspect grasp-not-exist not cease.
[3463] Intention dwell manner thus.
[3464] Thus it is.
[3465] Complete dharmata relax intention that time.
[3466] From Klongchenpa Six:
[3467] Upon mind itself pure exist.
[3468] As self-pure all objects door-five.
[3469] Like clear water not defile.
[3470] Complete self-place all appearance.
[3471] Thus it is.
[3472] Second, cut error place is.
[3473] If that also go memory-not by cease six-aggregate.
[3474] Error place: go one direction shamatha.
[3475] Error place: go spread scattering.
[3476] Error place: not find self-essence depth clear.
[3477] Error place: hold peg one-pointed.
[3478] Know other error place from meditation self-dwell grasp-not-exist vast-liberate self-clear awareness, briefly.
[3479] From Thalgyur:
[3480] Is meditation dwell head.
[3481] Upon clear all sense doors.
[3482] Mind thought not move.
