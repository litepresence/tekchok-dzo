[1252] To path-trained appearance manner;
[1253] Intermediate state appearance manner.
[1254] First:
[1255] Although light radiantly abides in oneself, to six realms not knowing own face, now lamp's self-light exists in subtle portions.
[1256] From that itself:
[1257] To all unrealized beings:
[1258] In humans, example-exists;
[1259] In gods, visible;
[1260] In demigods, subtly exists;
[1261] In animals, merely in own abode;
[1262] In hungry ghosts, flickers;
[1263] In hell realms, like sesame grain—
[1264] Thus six lights abide.
[1265] Thus spoken.
[1266] That light also merely tone existing inside heart.
[1267] By nature, ripening-result latencies' light exists in gods as distant visibility, etcetera;
[1268] Contaminated ripening-result virtue's light,
[1269] Not heart essence's self-light.

[1292] Eye:
[1293] Through wisdom's self-arisen lamp, knowing own face and moving to expanse.
[1294] Essence:
[1295] All-clear, non-ceasing wisdom.
[1296] Example and simile: Like crystal,
[1297] Although five lights in ground-abiding self not clear, they exist as arising ground.
[1298] When conditions experientially taken and intermediate state lamp, ground-appearance fills sky with five lights.
[1300] Time: If experientially taken, can also appear in this life;
[1301] Intermediate state naturally arising time.
[1302] Liberation place: To first primordially pure jewel secret cavity,
[1303] Drawing outer light inward, seizing the ground, gathering crystal light inward—abiding as arising's ground though clarity unclear.
[1304] In those words also, from Self-Arisen:
[1305] Light, kaya, and wisdom,
[1306] Mother, element, and aggregate,
[1307] Ground and family—thus explained.

[1309] And: to all beings, thus;
[1310] Each abiding in own body.

[1313] That great wisdom appearance
[1314] Abides in tsitta's center.
[1315] Path: arising from ocean's inside;
[1316] Field: empty sky;
[1317] Body: kayas and wisdom;
[1318] Eye: wisdom's lamp;
[1319] Essence: all-clear mirror.
[1320] Example and simile: stainless lapis crystal kaya;
[1321] Time: dharmata intermediate;
[1322] Arrived at jewel cavity's extent.
[1323] To this appearance, this appearance manner.
[1324] Thus spoken.
[1325] If these appearances seen in this, called "pure one-cutting intermediate state appearance manner."
[1326] Also, when measure arrives—five aggregates' binding liberated portion,
[1327] Inside tone arising outside, five lights' great appearance arising in sky above.
[1328] From that itself:
[1329] Pure one-cutting appearance:
[1330] In pure wisdom's sky,
[1331] Five lights unchanging, clear—
[1332] Also five clusters of five,
[1333] Father-mother manner arising.
