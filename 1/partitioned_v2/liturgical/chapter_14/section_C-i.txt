[2472] Say fierce phat—awareness thought-free ha-de-ba one come, until thought not-arise hold mind, also phat day-night experience take—arise meditation self-resonance emptiness-clear mind/
[2473] /Also: mind hold wrathful pleasure laugh/
[2474] Say short fierce ha—place mind like before, arise experience clear resonance thought-free/
[2475] /Mind hold asura quarrel dispute/

[2481] /And turbid red blood outer appearance/
[2482] /And flicker yellow/
[2483] /And waver green/
[2484] /And dissolve/
[2485] /After become blue-clear/
[2486] See essence establish not what—self-cease outer appearance/
[2487] Arise experience self-liberate see appearance/
[2488] /This time rely food suitable wind/
[2489] /Place mind letter ram navel/
[2490] /Mind hold expel hum thought—hum long vowel with mix wind, not-distract other hold mind from that nature/
[2491] Occasion say short hum—arise experience purify thought dharmata/
[2492] /Likewise: meditate ram navel, accord pith body wind, and */
[2493] Meditate deity body/
[2494] Place mind do emanate subtle body pore gate nose-tip—arise experience great pure clear awareness/
[2495] /Second: seven pith forehead grasp attachment body-mind/
[2496] Like before pith body wind/
[2497] /Mind hold bindu white-red mix pea locket eyebrow-center/
[2498] /That arise wind experience/
[2499] /Hold wind exist nose-hole two nose skeleton—channel three straight like stick center body exist/
[2500] Purify sin obscuration demon obstacle—shoot like arrow
[2501] /Draw in like hook—enter mother-nose central/
[2502] Arise experience emptiness-clear rigpa—hold mind fill wisdom wind four wheel three channel/
[2503] /Mind hold come in go out two draw between distance mile—arrow white wind nose-tip, arise experience clear thought-free/
[2504] /Mind hold not-distract not-dissipate not-scatter not-blur clear—like rainbow fence five light body give, arise experience pure light-clear/
[2505] /From shoot sky space wind-mind/
[2506] By fixing the mind upon letters, orbs of light, or mandalas of sun and moon—rising ever higher until they sink into space, becoming invisible—an experience arises of emptiness utterly free from conceptual mind.
[2507] By placing the mind within the ear and holding it thus, simultaneous and one-pointed, arises the experience of sound-meditation.
[2508] By holding the mind upon the subtle divine form within the heart, arises the pure clear-light experience. Thus the bardo clear-light matures, and the divine form, ring-sel, and rainbow lights manifest.
[2509] Third: the seven sets demonstrating the seeing of dharmata.
[2510] Holding the mind upon gradual emptiness:
[2511] First, cool the body's many parts.
[2512] Analyze them with many names and so forth.
[2513] Upon the head alone, cool with many names.
[2514] When those names are examined for meaning and the meaning dissolves into atoms, seek where the name abides—
[2515] When not found, within that state where nothing moves in the mind—emptiness displayed in the depths—without searching, anger, remembrance or thought, place simultaneously. An experience of emptiness without duality arises.
[2516] Apply to all appearances exactly as the body is.
[2517] Holding the mind upon instantaneous emptiness:
[2518] Whatever appears, when intensely viewed, think "emptiness cleared, cleared, cleared away."
[2519] Train upon all form-appearances, sound-appearances, and so forth. An experience like placing upon a mirror arises.
[2520] Holding the mind upon impermanence: training appearances to be without fixation.
[2521] Whatever appears without fixation, without truth—appearing variously, thus not true—becoming without boundary, through impermanence—thinking thus and training—
[2522] Arises the experience of separation from planetary fixation.
[2523] Upon whatever appears of the five elements, awareness just-big, placed without distraction—
[2524] Liberation in that very place—experience like a dream arises.
[2525] Holding the mind upon non-thought: appearances whatever appears, awareness whatever becomes—the moment's continuum without parts—thought-free—primordially abides—recognizing that, gathering, reaching, training—arises great thought-free self-abiding meditation.
[2526] Holding the mind upon union.
[2527] When duality appears and duality-grasping arises, through intensely viewing that within oneself, arises the experience of great self-pure non-duality. And furthermore—
[2528] Through making father-mother bliss the path, arises the experience of bliss-emptiness non-duality.
[2529] Making intermediate space the path:
[2530] Meditate rigpa dissolving-dissolved into intermediate space, and—
[2531] Meditate all appearances and mind, within the space of sky, pervasive and full, without any support, and—
[2532] Meditate sky and all phenomena as equal.
[2533] Arises the experience of extreme-free great emptiness.
[2534] The meaning of these also from Sun-Moon Union:
[2535] By placing the mind upon the letter A—
[2536] Phenomena-fixation reverses to its own place.
[2537] By placing the mind upon the generated deity—
[2538] Purifies the body's impurity.
[2539] By means of the vajra-song of speech—
[2540] That satisfies the mind.
[2541] By placing the mind from the letter HUM—
[2542] That cleanses speech-impurity.
[2543] Who holds the mind upon RAM—
[2544] By that purifies all phenomena.
[2545] Who dwells upon the letter HA—
[2546] Exhausts all confusion.
[2547] Who dwells mind upon PHAT—
[2548] That abandons body-speech harm.
[2549] Who meditates upon the brow-center drop—
[2550] By this wind becomes familiarized.
[2551] Who holds mind upon the channels of the staff—
[2552] By that closes the doors of the senses.
[2553] Who familiarizes mind at the nose-tip—
[2554] Gathers vast elements to their own place.
[2555] Who meditated self-light body-support—
[2556] By this becomes familiarized with bardo ground.
[2557] Who projects mind to sky—
[2558] By this becomes familiarized with emptiness.
[2559] Who holds mind upon the ear—
[2560] By this freely uses all sounds.
[2561] Who holds mind upon the heart-center—
[2562] By this thought purifies to self-place.
[2563] Who dwells in emptiness—
[2564] By this stops phenomena-fixation.
[2565] Who meditates sudden emptiness—
[2566] Memories instantaneously empty.
[2567] Who trains impermanence in mind—
[2568] By this reverses samsara-fixation.
[2569] Who holds mind upon five elements—
[2570] By that body-signs arise.
[2571] Who meditates non-thought wisdom—
[2572] By this stops characteristics-fixation.
[2573] Who meditates union-bliss—
[2574] By this makes sense-objects the path.
[2575] Who makes intermediate-space the path—
[2576] By this obtains power over mind.
[2577] Thus it is.
[2578] Furthermore, as auxiliary to these, the method of holding mind upon the five objects of appearance—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch:
[2579] From the Thalgyur:
[2580] Eye, form, sound, smell, taste, and touch.
[2581] Train upon the ground of the five sense-objects, and—
[2582] Forms—face-shapes and forms, and—
[2583] Arts and illusions, different, and—
[2584] Eye-magic, etc.—various.
[2585] Sounds—lute, vase-drum, and—
[2586] Stringed instruments, clay-drum, flute, and—
[2587] Pheng, har, etc.
[2588] Smells—fragrance joined, and—
[2589] Do through pleasing dependent-arising profound.
[2590] Tastes—molasses with six, and—
[2591] Grape-wine mixtures—variously transformed.
[2592] Dependent-arising branches joined.
[2593] Touch—skilled one sits upon throne.
[2594] Scriptures mixed, joined elements, and—
[2595] By means of some tree leaves,
[2596] By touch alone upon dharmata,
[2597] Dwells with non-separated mind.
[2598] Thus it is.
[2599] Especially, the stages of making the four elements yoga:
[2600] From that is spoken:
[2601] The training stage of the three kayas itself,
[2602] Making the qualities of elements chief, and—
[2603] Supreme—earth, water, fire, wind.
[2604] Trained upon sounds—certainly accomplished.
[2605] Upon explanation of water's sound,
[2606] Holds dakini's sound-melody.
[2607] If always familiarized with this,
[2608] Certainly accomplishes emanation-body.
[2609] Earth's sound—cool and heavy,
[2610] Possesses Great Brahma's sound-voice.
[2611] If always hearing-training upon this,
[2612] Certainly accomplishes enjoyment-body.
[2613] Fire's sound—self-made, trained.
[2614] Shows Vishnu-great's speech-melody.
[2615] Who practices hearing upon this,
[2616] Certainly obtains dharma-body's qualities.
[2617] Wind's sound—cutting, resounding,
[2618] Garuda king's practice-speech.
[2619] If knowing this always reciting,
[2620] Common training of three kayas.
[2621] Thus, the sound-meaning of four elements,
[2622] Certainly apply to outer times.
[2623] Winter, spring, summer, autumn—
[2624] Water, earth, fire, wind—
[2625] Apply certainly to sequence of times, and—
[2626] If made suited to yoga body,
[2627] Accomplishment—without doubt in this.
[2628] Thus it is.
[2629] Thus, summarizing the meaning of gods' and humans' mind-holding.
[2630] From Rangshar:
[2631] Gods' and humans' mind-holding:
[2632] Having held mouth-nose breath, and—
[2633] Thought-free, unmoved mind—
[2634] Is the nature of one-pointed awareness.
[2635] Spoken to be without instantaneous thought.
[2636] Cannot indicate the great true meaning.
[2637] Thus it is.
[2638] Second: the bodhisattva's meditation—two:
[2639] Actual divisions, and—
[2640] Arisen as auxiliary.
[2641] First, from two:
[2642] Briefly taught.
[2643] From Rangshar:
[2644] The bodhisattva's meditation—
[2645] Is holding by mind, and—
[2646] Arises by manner or force.
[2647] Familiarized, becomes expanse, and—
[2648] Abandoning food-concept.
[2649] Practiced by ground-dwellers.
[2650] Thought by manner is without.
[2651] That also cannot indicate great meaning.
[2652] Thus it is.
[2653] That also—nature's meaning is rigpa clear-light, and—
[2654] Not merely thought-free dwelling—therefore cannot indicate great meaning.
[2655] Extensively explained—three from:
[2656] Nature-force meditation is—
[2657] Arises spontaneously-accomplished, non-thought manner, and—
[2658] Only placing body-speech relaxed-down.
[2659] Focused-support meditation is—
[2660] Meditate antidote of view—nature without afflictions subtle-coarse, and—
[2661] Only suppress afflictions' heads.
[2662] Ground-dwellers' meditation—ground's actual concentration—only purifying self-ground latencies.
[2663] That from Sun-Moon Union:
[2664] The Great Vehicle's meditation—
[2665] By nature-force meditation—
[2666] Unfabricated body-speech relaxed-down.
[2667] By focused-support meditation—
[2668] Suppress instantaneous afflictions' heads.
[2669] By ground-dwellers' meditation—
[2670] Sustains self-self continuum.
[2671] Thus it is.
[2672] Second: showing arisen-from-arising meditation—two:
[2673] Nature, and—
[2674] Fabricated meditation.
[2675] First, nature meditation is—
[2676] Sentient beings all—when awareness distracted—arises from slightly trembling abiding, and.
[2677] Exists upon archer's eye, and—
[2678] Upon sleeping eye within rabbit and eagle, etc.
[2679] Briefly: exists always during times when mind-consciousness is distracted.
[2680] Second is fabricated meditation:
[2681] Meditation, concentration, non-thought, thought-with deity generation-completion, etc.—all are fabricated deliberately by mind, and—
[2682] Because deliberately done by intellect.
[2683] Here, depending upon purpose, placed as three, and—
[2684] That—upon yogi, food and clothes immediately harm.
[2685] Ultimately, dream and latencies harm, because circulates through three realms.
[2686] Those antidotes—meditation session cutting food fixation.
[2687] Meditation session cutting clothes fixation.
[2688] Meditation session cutting dream and latencies fixation—train from three.
[2689] First is:
[2690] Depending upon various essence-extraction, and—
[2691] From two: depend upon wind.
[2692] Various essence-extraction is:
[2693] Five-elements essence-extraction, and—
[2694] Medicine, and—
[2695] Grass, nectar, etc.—many, yet precious-jewels essence-extraction—supreme profound.
[2696] Essence-extraction of gathered precious-jewels and five nectars is.
[2697] From Thalgyur:
[2698] By essence extraction wish.
[2699] Method of joining five nectars:
[2700] Upon equal elements at other times,
[2701] Skilled, well-joined proportions, and—
[2702] Place within precious-jewels vessel.
[2703] Then honey, ushira.
[2704] And well-close the mouth.
[2705] And gradually take mercury drops.
[2706] Like bean-stones inside.
[2707] If skilled ones use as food,
[2708] Also great essence-extraction.
[2709] Become without doubt.
[2710] Thus it is.
[2711] Wind upper-lower joined, and—
[2712] Drawn within roma's channel, and—
[2713] Think throat's wheel full of nectar taste, and—
[2714] Hide earth-water wind—appearances all become food.
[2715] Dissolve into throat and roma.
[2716] Meditate bliss of meditation pervading—accomplished food-yoga.
[2717] These from Thalgyur.
[2718] Essence extraction like this:
[2719] By depending upon precious jewels,
[2720] Lifespan equals sun and moon.
[2721] By practicing various stones,
[2722] Weapons strike not the body.
[2723] By practicing depending upon herbs,
[2724] Becomes without white hair and wrinkles.
[2725] By essence-practice, by essence-extraction,
[2726] Becomes youthful with splendor.
[2727] By practicing depending upon flesh,
[2728] Becomes with body essence, strength generated.
[2729] Moreover by depending upon wind,
[2730] Explained wonder-great essence-extraction.
[2731] Called elements continuum-cut.
[2732] By upper-lower wind know.
[2733] Skilled—hide in wind-place.
[2734] Or calculate wind-change.
[2735] Becomes food-yoga.
[2736] Thus by essence extraction,
[2737] Cut sentient-beings' suffering.
[2738] Thus it is.
[2739] That—austerity and,
[2740] Essence extraction distinction:
[2741] If little stones, water, etc. support, eaten, drunk, mantra, focus merely made path—this is austerity.
[2742] Pills, small-vessel, support exists or not—also suitable, and.
[2743] If yoga made of wind and essence—becomes called essence extraction.
[2744] Second, from three: train in meditation session cutting clothes fixation.
[2745] Dependent-arising profound, flesh practice, and—
[2746] Stone practice, and—
[2747] Herb practice, and—
[2748] Essence practice, etc.
[2749] As explained from Dakini-treasury.
[2750] Depending fierce-woman fire-heat, body vajra-posture, wind joined, and.
[2751] Navel, fire blazes from RAM, emanation mandala, great-bliss wheel, between pervading, heat blazes, and.
[2752] Focus holding wind within channel, and.
[2753] Wind flows left nose, time much hold, purified, accomplished clothes-meditation.
[2754] Depending upon wind is.
[2755] Sit cross-legged, wind drawn within, pressed, stomach hot fire gone, time slowly hold, and.
[2756] Slowly released, and—
[2757] Wind's trace little held, also drawn by—
[2758] Heat arises, without sentient-beings, and—
[2759] Afflictions and thought cease by nature.
[2760] Also from Thalgyur:
[2761] Clothes yoga like this:
[2762] Do by profound dependent-arising of wind.
[2763] From wind extending and gathering,
[2764] Also by point of carrying going-coming.
[2765] Focus each element, and—
[2766] Divide suited to yoga body.
[2767] By dependent-arising practice.
[2768] From one, six, seven, three.
[2769] Pills, powder, well-joined.
[2770] Do by stomach-released rubbing-end.
[2771] Thus it is.
[2772] Third: train in meditation session cutting dream and latencies fixation:
[2773] Channels-wind.
[2774] Dream.
[2775] Illusory-body.
[2776] Clear-light.
[2777] Transference.
[2778] From six: union and bardo.
[2779] First, shown before.
[2780] Especially channel's point below navel, avadhuti below-tip above, near navel, red essence, fire-seed red sparkles, fire blazes from touch-hot.
[2781] Warmed within channel, from crown's HAM red-white bodhicitta dripping, pervading all four wheels and body, meditate, enter channel-wind from central below-tip, and.
[2782] Purify channel-wind drop water-one within cavity of four wheels.
[2783] Heat and wisdom arising from that—supreme means of actual path explained.
[2784] As branch of that, depending upon wisdom, make help as shown before, other-body means-path point, and.
[2785] If not depend, great-bliss drop blazing-flowing, and—
[2786] Know by experience of two bliss-channels slowly contracted, tongue little moved.
[2787] By entering certainty of equal clear-light point through wind practice.
[2788] That certainty from Thalgyur:
[2789] Depending upon wind, separate karma-mind.
[2790] Because cut three-realms escape-hole.
[2791] Reverse body-speech fixation from depth.
[2792] Because six-realms' precipice equal.
[2793] Pierce all points of body-speech-mind.
[2794] Because mix mind-itself with dharmata.
[2795] Draw wind-awareness upward.
[2796] Because exhaust deluded-appearance.
[2797] Always familiarized with wind.
[2798] Thus it is.
[2799] Upon doing victory over that means and obstacles—nectar and:

[3016] Here suitable as preliminary—because not free from intellect truth-grasping—merely held dream, emanate-transform not dharmata meaning.
[3017] Before most not explained this exists—very important point said suppression explanation, dream point oral-instruction, and.
