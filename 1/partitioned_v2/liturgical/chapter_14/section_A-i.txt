[4] 
[5] Thus having shown the distinction of alaya-ground and dharmakaya, and so forth,
[6] Now, regarding the explanation of dependent arising's nature, there are two:
[7] The common distinction,
[8] And the extensive explanation of individual natures.
[9] First:
[10] Outer-arising and inner-arising—two types.
[11] From the Self-Arisen:
[12] The two types of arising are shown.
[13] Outer-arising and inner-arising.
[14] Thus it is said.
[15] Outer-arising—earth, water, and so forth—these exist as the basis for inner-arising; connected as basis and dependent, therefore established as twofold.
[16] Without depending upon these two, no beings nor buddhas exist.
[17] All beings move within the confused expanse of the five-arising,
[18] Possessing the self-nature of the great arising.
[19] All buddhas dwell in the expanse of the five pure-arisings: earth without solidity, and so forth,
[20] Moving in the complete cessation of the five great arising's stains.
[21] Furthermore, the five great arising possess luminosity-wisdom and five colors;
[22] The five small arisings are earth, water, fire, wind, and space.
[23] The five pure arisings are:
[24] Clear,
[25] Warm,
[26] Bright,
[27] Cool,
[28] Spacious,
[29] Holding the self-nature of movement.
[30] From the five confused arisings, the five luminous arrive in the expanse, meeting the inner expanse,
[31] Like the purity of the great arising of spontaneous presence's appearance.
[32] Regarding the small arising, also arising-form,
[33] And actual arising—two.
[34] Arising-form is the five appearing now externally: earth, water, fire, wind, and space.
[35] Actual arising is the five qualities of the body—thin, and so forth—becoming the five inner-arising bases.
[36] Inner-arising:
[37] The five individual dharma-arisings, bases of pure realms.
[38] Therefore all samsara and nirvana do not move from the expanse of the five-arising;
[39] Before the five-arising, samsara and nirvana do not arise.
[40] From the Self-Arisen:
[41] Kye Ho! Secret Lord, listen!
[42] The characteristics of the five-arising:
[43] I show—you must understand.
[44] The great arising, Bhagavan,
[45] Exist as the nature of all beings.
[46] All beings of the three realms
[47] Move in the expanse of the five-arising.
[48] Before the time when the five-arising did not exist,
[49] Neither buddhas nor beings—even names did not exist.
[50] The five-arising themselves are the mother-expanse.
[51] Not established from the five-arising,
[52] Not even one birth-going being exists.
[53] The five-arisings of beings dwelling therein
[54] Are shown as twofold.
[55] Thus it is said.
[56] Second: regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are two:
[57] The extensive explanation of outer-arising,
[58] And the extensive explanation of inner-arising.
[59] First among these:
[60] Essence,
[61] Definitive terminology,
[62] Purpose,
[63] Characteristics,
[64] Sequence of functions,
[65] Dharma-nature,
[66] Applied meaning,
[67] Manner of liberation,
[68] Divisions,
[69] And the tenfold manner of completeness.
[70] First, the essence:
[71] Outer-arising appearing as form is the play of inner-arising's actuality;
[72] Therefore, gathered within the inner domain, these are the five-arising.
[73] From the Self-Arisen:
[74] The outer-arising are thus:
[75] Earth and water and fire,
[76] And likewise wind and space.
[77] Thus it is said.
[78] The five forms of outer-arising become the appearing container-support for beings;
[79] The five actualities of inner-arising become the support for mind and awareness.
[80] From the Thal 'gyur:
[81] The assertion regarding arising is thus:
[82] From the particularities of general-common karma,
[83] By individual karma-supports of beings,
[84] Relying upon the outer-arising,
[85] Karma, sustenance, and faculties,
[86] Entourage and birth—complete.
[87] Thus.
[88] Second, the definitive terminology:
[89] From the Self-Arisen:
[90] The definitive terminology of arising is thus:
[91] Not made by fabrication, spontaneously complete;
[92] By that which produces, they are arising;
[93] Pervading all migrators, they are great-arising;
[94] By simultaneous birth, they are great-arising;
[95] Existing in themselves, they are great-arising;
[96] Without change, they are great-arising;
[97] Appearing harmoniously, they are great-arising.
[98] The definitive terminology of great-arising—thus.
[99] Thus.
[100] Third, the purpose:
[101] From the Thal 'gyur:
[102] The inquiry into arising's purpose is thus:
[103] Water gathers the clear essence
[104] And separates the impurities—this is its function.
[105] As it acts within each individual body,
[106] Its purpose is known as heat and cold.
[107] Earth holds the foundation
[108] And performs establishing and cohering functions.
[109] By ripening, it produces roots and so forth;
[110] Its purpose is known as the relative thigle.
[111] Fire increases the arising
[112] And performs ripening and clarifying functions.
[113] By blazing and spreading, it produces eyes and so forth;
[114] Its purpose is made known as warmth.
[115] Wind scatters and lifts
[116] And performs moving and quivering functions.
[117] By moving and trembling, it holds the body;
[118] Its purpose is known as the abode of mind.
[119] The four arising—the great mandala of self—
[120] Become the cause for accomplishing body and so forth,
[121] Abide in the middle and perform the holding function,
[122] And in the end perform all destruction functions.
[123] Through one cause, the great arising
[124] Appear as the master performing the various.
[125] Thus, regarding intention, self and other,
[126] Skilled in the meaning of completed action.
[127] Thus.
[128] Fourth, the characteristics—from among five:
[129] Earth-characteristic: solidity.
[130] Water-characteristic: moisture.
[131] Fire-characteristic: warmth.
[132] Wind-characteristic: movement.
[133] Space-characteristic: openness and spaciousness.
[134] Fifth, the sequence of functions:
[135] From the Thal 'gyur:
[136] The sequence of inner-arising's functions:
[137] Earth makes the body's basis;
[138] By producing, flesh ripening is asserted.
[139] Water gathers the entire body;
[140] By producing, blood ripening is asserted.
[141] Fire ripens the entire body;
[142] By producing, warmth ripening is asserted.
[143] Wind lifts the entire body;
[144] By producing, breath ripening is made.
[145] Thus.
[146] Sixth, the dharma-nature:
[147] Though generally empty, here the dharma-nature that holds its own characteristic, made authoritative as dharma-nature:
[148] From the Self-Arisen:
[149] The dharma-nature of the five-arising:
[150] Arising's cause is earth.
[151] Arising's wisdom is fire.
[152] Arising's emanation is wind.
[153] Arising's master is water.
[154] Arising's dharma-nature is space.
[155] Thus.
[156] Seventh, the application of meaning—from two:
[157] The application of meaning to the five-arising's essence:
[158] From That Very:
[159] The application of meaning to arising is thus:
[160] Within dharmakaya nature, primordially pure,
[161] By essence without change, arising-earth also is.
[162] By awareness-wisdom engaging meaning, arising-fire also is.
[163] By awareness-wisdom, unmoved, gone into expanse, arising-wind also is.
[164] By awareness-wisdom gathering three cavities as one, arising-water also is.
[165] By wisdom dissolving into nondual empty-luminous manner, arising-space is.
[166] Thus.
[167] The application of meaning connecting the five-arising's individual meanings with inner awareness:
[168] From the Norbu 'phrul bkod:
[169] The five outer-arising are the common dharma of self-continuum;
[170] By connecting all outer-appearing arising with self-awareness itself, they are the common dharma.
[171] The divisions are thus:
[172] Earth-characteristic, making solidity, also—
[173] Connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth and destruction.
[174] Wind-characteristic, making lifting,
[175] Connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction.
[176] Fire-characteristic, making burning,
[177] Connects with awareness-wisdom gone under afflictions' authority.
[178] Water-characteristic, making moistening,
[179] Connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects.
[180] Space-characteristic, vastness,
[181] Connects with awareness-characteristic without break in continuity—thus it is said.
[182] Eighth, the manner of the five-arising's liberation:
[183] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[184] Space itself, by pervading emptiness,
[185] Space itself liberates as entity.
[186] Wind, by appearing without graspable object,
[187] Liberates into entity-gathering's function.
[188] Fire, by consuming what ripens,
[189] Liberates by moving and separating clear from impure.
[190] Earth, when making the producer lift,
[191] Liberates into limitless empty non-entity.
[192] Water, by moistening what gathers,
[193] Liberates into burning-ripening's function.
[194] Thus.
[195] Explaining divisions:
[196] Each of the five-arising—earth of earth, and so forth—five sets of five;
[197] Enumeration of portions: twenty-five.
[198] Again from That Very:
[199] Space's wind toward entity,
[200] Space's fire makes gathering,
[201] Space's water makes burning,
[202] Space's earth opens opportunity,
[203] Space's space appears.
[204] Wind's wind toward stability,
[205] Wind's space: great sound-potential,
[206] Wind's water: great quickness and speed,
[207] Wind's fire: great projection and gathering,
[208] Wind's earth: clear form-reflection.
[209] Water's water: sound-echo,
[210] Water's space: without obstruction,
[211] Water's wind: flows attachment-free,
[212] Water's fire: makes gathering,
[213] Water's earth: makes pervading.
[214] Fire's earth: makes producing,
[215] Fire's space: burns entity,
[216] Fire's wind: makes blazing,
[217] Fire's water: makes destroying,
[218] Fire's earth: holds.
[219] Earth's earth: pervades migrators,
[220] Earth's space: the mahayana,
[221] Earth's wind: makes snow-empty,
[222] Earth's water: produces entity,
[223] Earth's fire: dries.
[224] Thus.
[225] By training in these distinctions, distinguished qualities; each accomplished. In that commentary it is explained—
[226] From the Sound Thal 'gyur also, it is stated that by training in the elements' sound-meaning, common attainments are obtained.
[227] By that sound-meaning's particularities,
[228] Definite showing of general forms.
[229] By training in form, body becomes exhausted.
[230] By sound, languages are known.
[231] By smell, taking essence is accomplished.
[232] By taste, entity becomes nectar.
[233] Thus it is said; and
[234] From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:
[235] Earth, water, fire, wind—
[236] The four elements' sounds and meanings,
[237] By becoming familiar,
[238] The six races' self-sounds
[239] Arising clairvoyance accomplishes.
[240] Thus.
[241] These are the outer-arising—all beings' support and abode.
[242] Tenth, regarding that and also other topics—the manner of showing how samsara-nirvana dharmas are complete in the yogi's body-mind—threefold:
[243] Generally showing the partial-similarity completeness manner,
[244] Explaining in particular the body-mind completeness manner,
[245] Making understood through the play of great definite symbols.
[246] First:
[247] In this dharma of gathered body-mind of migrators, all primordially self-arise with complete parts—
[248] Father and mother as method and wisdom's portion;
[249] Karma-projecting wind as dharmakaya-awakening's portion;
[250] Five elements' seeds as five families' sound-potential's portion;
[251] Two equipoise essences as path's two accumulations' method-wisdom union's portion;
[252] Womb-abiding as base-expanse-abiding's portion;
[252] Body forming in seven seven-day sets as seven pure elements' seven paths' completing's portion;
[253] Ten womb months as ten grounds' completing's portion;
[254] Three-kaya buddhahood as path-completing's portion;
[255] Birth as emanation-body;
[256] Body-abiding engaging fields as enjoyment-body;
[257] Death as dharmakaya emptiness's portion arising;
[258] The manner in which migrators, primordially traversing base-path-result, are liberated.
[259] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[260] The Bhagavan spoke:
[261] Not liberated by effort,
[262] Abiding liberated from primordial.
[263] From method and wisdom's union,
[264] Father and mother are themselves the cause.
[265] Projecting wind's moving portion—
[266] Self-aware awakening, great bliss.
[267] Five-arising cause's seed
[268] Arises, appearing from emptiness-field.
[269] Two's bliss equipoise
[270] Is wisdom itself arisen from method.
[271] Womb-belly entering
[272] Is self-awareness arising from base.
[273] Seven seven-sets' realization measure.
[274] Ten months' grounds traversing.
[275] Birth itself is kaya-arising.
[276] Producing body is base-appearing field.
[277] Body-abiding is the base.
[278] Aging is delusion's confusion-awakening.
[279] Sickness itself is realization-confidence.
[280] By death, liberation into dharmata-emptiness.
[281] Thus all appearing beings
[282] Are primordially liberated without effort.
[283] Thus.
[284] Connecting with delusion-reversing particular manner:
[285] Birth is awareness moving from expanse's portion.
[286] Body is the base.
[287] Outer-appearing portion is base-appearing spontaneous completion.
[288] Sickness is realization meeting face-to-face.
[289] Aging is truth-clinging's confusion-awakening.
[290] Death, when knowing self-face, shows final arrival at primordial purity's ground in inner expanse's portion.
[291] By these arising primordially, instruction introduction and
[292] Empowerment,
[293] Liberation through meditation—suitable.
[294] If complete in partial similarity, not able to liberate through instruction;
[295] By clearly showing that partial similarity exists, buddha's dharma it is called.
[296] Existing in base-path's primordial measure,
[297] What becomes shown as symbol-meaning by buddha's speaking also arrives at this essence.
[298] Second, explaining body-mind completeness manner in particular—threefold:
[299] Body,
[300] Mind,
[301] Awareness completeness manner.
[302] First:
[303] In this four-arising gathered aggregate, outer container-world's portion and
[304] Inner essence-migrants' portions—all complete.
[305] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[306] Earth, water, fire, wind,
[307] Space, sun, and moon,
[308] Born males and females' forms,
[309] Planets, stars, and clouds,
[310] Trees, mountains, and rocks,
[311] Roots, trunks, and branches,
[312] Leaves, flowers, and fruits,
[313] Smells, tastes, sounds, and touches.
[314] Music, canopies,
[315] Banners, and upper-canopies,
[316] Those appearing surrounding dharmas—
[317] Are complete in the yogi's own body.
[318] Thus.
[319] Explaining these portions extensively:
[320] Earth's portion: flesh;
[321] Water's portion: blood;
[322] Fire's portion: warmth;
[323] Wind's portion: breath;
[324] Space's portion: mind;
[325] Sun-moon's portion: two eyes;
[326] Male's portion: birth;
[327] Female's portion: death;
[328] Planet's portion: desire's gate-house and two nostrils;
[329] Star's portion: teeth;
[330] Cloud's portion: hair;
[331] Tree's portion: channels;
[332] Mountain's portion: whole similar body;
[333] Rock's portion: bones;
[334] Tree-root's portion: heart;
[335] Branch's portion: limbs;
[336] Flower's portion: five faculties of eye and so forth;
[337] Fruit's portion: accomplished as body's happiness-suffering;
[338] Sound's portion: voice;
[339] Form's portion: body;
[340] Smell's portion: pores;
[341] Taste's portion: skin;
[342] Touch's portion: sickness;
[343] Music's portion: channels and internal organs;
[344] Canopy's portion: urine;
[345] Parasol's portion: legs;
[346] Banner's portion: name;
[347] Upper-canopy's portion: breath.
[348] Also, from the Mu tig phreng ba, thus stated:
[349] Earth is flesh, entity itself;
[350] Water is blood, gathering itself;
[351] Fire is warmth, ripening all body;
[352] Wind is breath, karma's container;
[353] Space is mind, body's potential;
[354] Sun-moon is eye, making clear;
[355] Male is birth itself;
[356] Female appears as death;
[357] Planet is in mouth, star is teeth;
[358] Cloud is in hair, tree is channels;
[359] Mountain is in body, rock is bones;
[360] Root is in heart, trunk is legs;
[361] Branches are in limbs;
[362] Flower itself is five faculties;
[363] Fruit is accomplished in body;
[364] Smell is pores, taste is skin;
[365] Sound is in voice, touch is sickness;
[366] Music is internal organs, canopy is water;
[367] Parasol is legs, banner is name;
[368] Upper-canopy is breath.
[369] These are complete in the yogi's body.
[370] Thus.
[371] Second, in mind all samsara-nirvana dharmas, base and path, are completely present.
[372] Again from That Very:
[373] All white transcendence dharmas
[374] Are completely present in body-mind;
[375] Because samsara dharmas are empty of transcendence,
[376] Mandala, deity, offering,
[377] Mantra, mudra, concentration,
[378] Empowerment, samaya,
[379] Instruction-giving, experience,
[380] Likewise development stage,
[381] Hearing, contemplating, meditating,
[382] View, conduct, meditation,
[383] Giving, ethics, patience,
[384] Effort, concentration, wisdom,
[385] Power, aspiration, wisdom,
[386] Likewise method's perfection,
[387] Ten virtues' conduct, and so forth,
[388] Method and wisdom themselves,
[389] Thus, from and so forth,
[390] Those transcendence-indicating dharmas
[391] Abide completely in body-mind,
[392] Up to thus stated.
[393] Third, awareness completeness manner:
[394] Again from that:
[395] In whatever self-appearing awareness's face,
[396] All however-appearing dharmas are complete.
[397] Thus stated; and
[398] Thus in awareness itself:
[399] Sun and moon: method and wisdom;
[400] Male: base, female: path;
[401] Planet: realization measure, star: dharma;
[402] Cloud: compassion pervading all;
[403] Tree: dharmata-expanding path;
[404] Mountain: view without change;
[405] Rock: dharmakaya free from birth and destruction;
[406] Root: all dharmas' one cause;
[407] Branch: awakening's branch itself;
[408] Trunk: one taste in emptiness;
[409] Leaf: pervading dharmadhatu;
[410] Flower: wisdom's lamp itself;
[411] Fruit: three kayas self-complete.
[412] Sound: dharmata-field's sound;
[413] Smell: buddha-speech's fame;
[414] Taste: experience's bliss taste;
[415] Touch: great concentration;
[416] Music: five's complete mandala;
[417] Canopy: clear color's potential;
[418] Parasol: protecting wisdom;
[419] Upper-canopy: instruction's great essential point;
[420] Banner: manifest realization's buddha;
[421] All dharmas in mind-itself's face
[422] Abide in primordial spontaneous completion's manner.
[423] Therefore, mind and entity dharmas
[424] Are all merely imputed.
[425] Thus.
[426] Second meaning: inner-arising extensive explanation—two:
[427] Common divisions and
[428] Individual divisions' nature.
[429] First:
[430] Inner-arising: essence's five-arising inwardly rely upon body's five coarse arising;
[431] Wind and
[432] Fire and
[433] Earth and
[434] Water and
[435] Space—five, each abiding as five, twenty-five limbs.
[436] Thus, definite suitability: definite as five, depending on five different functions;
[437] From the Self-Arisen:
[438] The five great arising are complete in one's own body.
[439] That also: five winds make wisdom-potential;
[440] Five fires make wisdom-potency;
[441] Five earths make wisdom-essence;
[442] Five waters make wisdom-object;
[443] Five spaces make wisdom-abode. Thus.
[444] Second, five:
[445] Wind and
[446] Fire and
[447] Earth and
[448] Water and
[449] Space nature extensive explanation.
[450] First among these, from two:
[451] Root division extensive explanation and
[452] Branch division extensive explanation.
[453] Root division:
[454] From the Self-Arisen:
[455] What are the five wind types?
[456] Life-holding wind and
[457] Color-radiance producing wind and
[458] Fire-equal wind and
[459] All-pervading wind and
[460] Compassionless karma wind—five.
[461] Those winds abide in all beings' bodies' head and tail. Thus.
[462] That also: life-holding wind abides in life-channel;
[463] Color-radiance producing abides in chest;
[464] Fire-equal abides in navel;
[465] All-pervading abides, pervading whole body;
[466] Karma wind abides between heart and heart-membrane.
[467] Their functions also:
[468] Life-abiding and
[469] Radiance-producing and
[470] Food-digesting,
[471] Going-sitting, and
[472] Life-transference function performing—thus in sequence.
[473] Second, branch division:
[474] From each of the five winds also abiding as five:
[475] First, the five life-holding winds from the Self-Arisen:
[476] In life-holding wind also five:
[477] Root-holding life and
[478] Protecting life and
[479] Spreading life and
[480] Impure life and
[481] Shattering life—five. Thus.
[482] Those also according to sequence:
[483] Awareness-potential producing and
[484] Bindhu-potential producing and
[485] Light-potential producing and
[486] Non-awareness root holding and
[487] Existing in life-channel in mind-helper making manner.
[488] Life-wind potential relies upon and abides in awareness-potential.
[489] Second, the five fire-equal winds:
[490] Again from that:
[491] In fire-abiding wind also five:
[492] Clear-impure separating wind and
[493] Warmth-producing wind and
[494] Clear-change wind and
[495] Distinctions-gathering wind and
[496] Praise-making wind—five. Thus.
[497] Those also according to sequence:
[497] Nondual with life,
[498] Nondual with awareness,
[499] Nondual with lamp,
[500] Nondual with bindhu,
[501] Abide nondual with wisdom.
[502] Third, the five color-radiance producing winds—also from That Source:
[503] In color-radiance producing wind also five: consciousness-producing wind and
[504] Mind-arising wind and
[505] Radiance-possessing wind and
[506] Burning wind and
[507] Wildness wind—five. Thus.
[508] Those also according to sequence: wisdom-object,
[509] Appearing-object,
[510] Lamp-object,
[511] Non-awareness object,
[512] Mind-object horse making.
[513] Fourth, the five all-pervading winds:
[514] From the Self-Arisen:
[515] In all-pervading wind also five:
[516] Base-pervading and
[517] Immediate-pervading and
[518] Hatred-fear pervading and
[519] Memory-pervading and
[520] All body-pervading by holding—five. Thus.
[521] Those also according to sequence:
[522] Wisdom-appearing,
[523] Lamp-appearing,
[524] Knowing-appearing,
[525] Thinking-appearing,
[526] Mind-appearing potency making.
[527] Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
[528] Again from That Source:
[529] In compassionless aeon-karma wind also five:
[530] Movement-making wind and
[531] Liberation-making wind and
[532] Reversal-making wind and
[533] Swiftness-making wind and
[534] Moments wind—five. Thus.
[535] Those also according to sequence:
[536] Aggregates-pervading,
[537] Moments-pervading,
[538] Bardo-pervading,
[539] Concepts-pervading,
[540] Three-pervading—moments, actions, completion.
[541] Thus, twenty-five also gather into five roots.
[542] These terms' explanation:
[543] From the Self-Arisen:
[544] Because of true-ground movement-making,
[545] Move-making wind it is called.
[546] Because of pure wisdom's life-holding,
[547] Life-holding wind it is called.
[548] Because of five wisdom-lights' self-nature existing,
[549] Color-radiance producing wind it is called.
[550] Because of wisdom's true expanse liberation ability,
[551] Compassionless aeon-karma wind it is called.
[552] Because of wisdom-appearing's non-gathering non-separating abiding,
[553] Fire-equal wind it is called. Thus.
[554] Thus, in the five essence winds, relying on awareness-wisdom, now abiding in heart,
[555] That is wisdom's self-sound-potential clearing as five lights' essential point.
[556] When awareness separates from wind, wisdom-expanse gathering,
[557] Outer-inner's non-manifest also arrives at pure wind-mind's essential point.
[552] Explaining briefly summarized here:
[553] Primordially pure essence's awareness-jewel abides in luminous self-nature's palace, in secret cavity, as essence-nature-compassion-three's master.
[554] Although that essence, abiding as kaya, has unclear self-purpose, it is self-clear, appearing as outer-kaya from appearance's non-ceasing base.
[555] Nature: five lights' arising base, life wind, and four branches, primordially abiding as speech's essence.
[556] Compassion, self-arisen awareness-essence, spontaneously complete as two-knowing's wisdom.
[557] Abiding without shift or change from kaya-wisdom's non-gathering non-separating intention.
[558] The two-knowing:
[559] Depending on dharmata's inner-clear essence, all-knowing;
[560] Depending on dharmapossessor's outer-clear aspect, all-aspect-knowing appearing as wisdom.
[561] Five winds: from root life-wind's portion, compassion, awareness-wisdom—if pure, buddha-wisdom;
[562] If impure, become beings' realization-aggregate arising-base.
[563] Four branch winds emanating from that, from compassion-potency, like sun's rays:
[564] Upward-going wisdom-horse and
[565] Downward-clearing wisdom-ray, potential-light, and
[566] Fire-equal ripening-possessing power, and
[567] Completing-pervasion possessing power—four.
[568] Although these also exist only in life-wind's portion,
[569] In expanse, not emanated;
[570] Abiding only as emanation's non-ceasing base's essence.
[571] Essence-branch clear as light.
[572] Thus stated, also from the Kun gsal:
[573] That kaya's abiding manner:
[574] Like empty-luminous bubble's form-reflection.
[575] That speech's abiding nature:
[576] Like fire-sparks' rays, four branch winds
[577] Clear in awareness-expanse.
[578] That mind's clear nature:
[579] Life-wind's self-essence,
[580] Like wisdom fire-sparks without falling-direction,
[581] Abide as essence-of-essence's five wisdoms.
[582] Thus.
[583] That also is wisdom not deceived by any concept.
[584] Altering and transforming—
[585] Not able to be grasped by face or designated by mark,
[586] Like earth and sky,
[587] Clear and subtle, like sparks of fire behind the five lights,
[588] The expanse's heart essence, dharmakaya,
[589] Abiding as awareness itself, holding all's basis.
[590] Its abiding palace is
[591] From that very source:
[592] Dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space—
[593] Thus it is said.
[594] When that dharmakaya abides within the precious interior,
[595] It is called dharmata's pure original tone,
[596] The house possessing awareness-light,
[597] Abiding in light's display.
[598] This is called the primordial common basis, awareness-expanse,
[599] The meaning of establishing connection with the five winds.
[600] Second, the five fires' extensive explanation, from Self-Arisen:
[601] There are five fires:
[602] Outer-inner all-pervading fire,
[603] Outer-inner all-illuminating fire,
[604] Outer-inner all-equalizing fire,
[605] Outer-inner action's concept fire,
[606] Outer-inner action's accomplishing fire—thus five.
[607] These also, in sequence,
[608] Reside in lungs,
[609] Eyes and five limbs, making six,
[610] Flesh gaps,
[611] Two soles of feet,
[612] And two palms of hands, producing warmth.
[613] Third, the five earths as well:
[614] From that same source:
[615] There are five earths:
[616] All-illuminating earth,
[617] Unchanging vajra earth,
[618] Precious earth from which all arise,
[619] All-pervading earth showing appearances,
[620] Perfected accomplishment earth—thus five.
[621] These also, in sequence,
[622] Together with awareness,
[623] Together with lamp,
[624] Together with thigle,
[625] Together with wisdom,
[626] Together with discriminating awareness, they abide in reliance.
[627] Fourth, the five waters also from Self-Arisen:
[628] The five water kinds are:
[629] Unchanging water,
[630] Peaceful, clear, pure water,
[631] Extensively arising qualities' water,
[632] Attachment-free water,
[633] Completion-without-grasping water—thus five.
[634] These also, according to sequence,
[635] Together with all channels—
