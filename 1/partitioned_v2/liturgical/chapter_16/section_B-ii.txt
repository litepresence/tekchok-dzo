[9244] See interior wisdom obscured.
[9245] Conduct:
[9246] Endowed with conduct grasping samsara-nirvana two.
[9247] Fruit:
[9248] Having abandoned body, breath reaches nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[9249] Second, the essence of wisdom's general filling intention:
[9250] Realizing awareness's power-empowerment perfected from the beginning.
[9251] Different manners of realizing by three sense-powers:
[9252] From that same source:
[9253] At the time when wisdom's general filling intention arises,
[9254] Also, by best, middle, and last three sense-powers of the person, three view manners arise.
[9255] Best sense-power realizes only by demonstrating birthless fruit as self-nature through empowerment.
[9256] Intention:
[9257] Through wisdom practice, spreading to bindu, unmoving from sky-equal great bliss intention.
[9258] Conduct:
[9259] Conduct without pure-impure in white-red awakening mind.

[9278] Third, the essence of bindu range-penetration intention:
[9279] Buddha-hood through penetrating self-appearance's range by self-arising awareness wisdom of the intermediate, self-realizing.
[9280] Different by distinction of person's sense-power.
[9281] From that:
[9282] At the time when bindu range-penetration intention arises,
[9283] Also, for best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three view-signs arise.
[9284] The view of best sense-power:
[9285] Like a meteor moving in the sky,
[9286] Arising as wisdom-power quality,
[9287] Realizes liberation in three moments.
[9288] Intention:
[9289] Abides pervasive to all open clarity, like sun arising in space-between.
[9290] Conduct:

[9307] Or did that arise from me—realizes thus thinking.
[9308] Intention:

[9310] Conduct:
[9311] Endowed with doubt and indecision conduct.
[9312] Fruit:

[9314] Fourth, the essence of sun-moon equal gap intention:
[9315] Realizing appearance-emptiness as equality without ceasing.
[9316] Separated individually by sense-power.
[9317] From Power-Perfect:
[9318] At the time when sun-moon equal gap intention penetrates expanse,
[9319] For best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three view-signs arise.
[9320] The view of best sense-power:
[9321] Realizes wisdom as open.
[9322] Intention: not separate from wisdom river's channel without ceasing.
[9323] Conduct:
[9324] Conducts display without ceasing by great wisdom conduct.

[9339] Fruit:
[9340] Seizing tutelary deity's illusory body in intermediate,
[9341] Obtaining fruit of pure appearance. Thus it is spoken.
[9342] Fifth, the essence of ocean expanse-penetration intention:
[9343] Abiding in force-samadhi of nature as Dharma-nature equal-clear state.
[9344] Separated by individual sense-power.
[9345] From Power-Perfect:
[9346] At the time of ocean expanse-penetration intention,
[9347] Also, three view-signs arise for three sense-powers.
[9348] The view of best sense-power:
[9349] Realizes whatever appears by great wisdom's activity as self-appearance itself.
[9350] Intention:
[9351] Like being intoxicated by alcohol with small attachment to appearance.
[9352] Conduct:

[9366] Intention:
[9367] Abiding in god and human mind-holding.
[9368] Conduct:
[9369] Endowed with fabricated two-grasping conduct.
[9370] Fruit:
[9371] Obtaining god and human status. Thus it is spoken.
[9372] Third, summarizing meaning by aspect:
[9373] These five intentions bind all secret heart-essence yogins.
[9374] Arising of yogin's experience:
[9375] By mountain general meaning, transcending view of great perfection without high-low, slack-tight equality.
[9376] By wisdom's general filling, grasp ground as self-abiding Dharma-nature in that manner.
[9377] By bindu range-penetration, examine awareness's liberation manner from space-appearance.
[9378] By sun-moon equal gap, deliver intention to Dharma-ceasing expanse.
[9379] By ocean expanse-penetration, stably hold ground at primordially pure ground of space-awareness.
[9380] Also, first: like lion's play conquering fear of delusory appearance destruction, washed high by view.
[9381] Second: like king-awareness empowerment obtaining self-power Dharma-nature.
[9382] Third: like peacock chick emerging from egg, reaching pure space.
[9383] Fourth: like equal sun-moon without two, expanding greatly all-equal vastness.
[9384] Fifth: establishing supreme secret bindu meaning gathered in intention like sun arising from mountain neck, self-appearance clear as wisdom.
[9385] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[9386] The intention of mountain's general meaning
[9387] Is like lion's play.
[9388] The intention of wisdom's general filling
[9389] Is like empowerment from king's head.
[9390] The intention of bindu's range-penetration is like peacock chick emerging from egg.
[9391] The intention of sun-moon equal gap is like entering equality without sun and moon two.
[9392] The intention of ocean's expanse-penetration
[9393] Is like sun arising from mountain's neck. Thus it is spoken.
[9394] Thus, dividing each of the five aspirations into three sense-powers makes fifteen; dividing each of these into view, intention, conduct, and fruit fours makes sixty Dharma enumerations—purifying sixty enumerations of eon's increase-decrease, sentient beings' affliction, and view.
[9395] Demonstrated as pure complete nature of wisdom experience, spoken by Vajra-Holder.
[9396] ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[9397] The twentieth chapter establishing the essential point of taking experience of spontaneous leap-over wisdom.
[9398] Thus having demonstrated all methods of taking experience through guidance method,
[9399] Now, extensively explaining the sequence of how to take experience through introduction, has two aspects:
[9400] Establishing all Dharmas by general introduction sequence,
[9401] And extensively explaining mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction.
[9402] First, the preparation preceding introduction:
[9403] From two actual introductions,
[9404] First:
[9405] Prepare dwelling-place direction half with sun's light-ray together, crystal without stain.
[9406] From Introduction Ornament Tantra:
[9407] Dwelling direction indeed to half,
[9408] Aperture possessing sun's light-ray,
[9409] By extending mirror making clear,
[9410] See light's appearance coming outside.
[9411] Thus it is spoken.
[9412] From that, by teacher's blessing demonstrating mirror example of Vajra-Mind introduction previously arisen,
[9413] The manner of arising in this Jambu continent:
[9414] From Samsara Dong-Sprug Precious Secret Tantra:
[9415] Holding the lineage of five Buddhas,
[9416] Five crystal stupa thousand-spans,
[9417] Possessing the nature of five wisdoms,
[9418] Holding the lineage of five sky-expanses,
[9419] Expanding to pervade the sky without appearance,
[9420] Individually clear, colors unmixed,
[9421] Three: essence, nature, compassion.
[9422] Essence: pure ground without ceasing.
[9423] Nature: five great elements.
[9424] Compassion: completely demonstrated form-body.
[9425] From Vajra-space mandala,
[9426] Nature spontaneously complete body,
[9427] Water-moon body possessing five wisdoms,
[9428] Possessing self-nature of unclear-clear.
[9429] Five crystal stupa thousand-spans,
[9430] Descended to Vajra-Holder's left.
[9431] Possessing three aspects of tone,
[9432] Enters corner in north-east direction.
[9433] In nighttime direction, see daytime.
[9434] When wisdom placed near right corner,
[9435] Become seeing certain single Buddha.
[9436] Wisdom, superior-seeing wisdom,
[9437] Is single Buddha intention.
[9438] When applying meaning with nectar tongue,
[9439] Awareness cuckoo is one word.
[9440] Supreme of changeless vajra body,
[9441] Instruction commentary possessing corner-proceeding,
[9442] Is Vajra-Mind's testaments.
[9443] Thus it is spoken.
[9444] Then to the place of thirty-three,
[9445] Upper story of Complete Victory Palace,
[9446] Descended to Potalaka.
[9447] Then descended to peak of Five-Peaks Mountain,
[9448] Then descended to Vajra-Seat,
[9449] Then descended to Gangs-Ti-Se,
[9450] Then that great stupa emanated as light-ray,
[9451] Speaking "dispel sentient beings' concepts"—
[9452] From the beginning when this world formed, from Vajra-space mandala emanation, nature's blessing,
[9453] Teacher Vajra-Holder descended to the left of Joyful-Stacked who went for beings' benefit,
[9454] Thirty-three and
[9455] Five-Peaks Mountain and
[9456] Vajra-Seat and
[9457] Descended one to one for beings' benefit in the interval of Snow-mountain Ti-Se,
[9458] Now abiding in the jewel light-emanating house at Ti-Se's peak,
[9459] Sky-goers, accomplished ones, and many awareness-mantra holders worship and aspire.
[9460] Though there is no actual mirror like that,
[9461] For determining indicative examples: various jewels,
[9462] Or self-arisen crystal from snow, ocean continent, etc., should be made into introduction mirror.
[9463] From Introduction Ornament:
[9464] Jewel heart-essence jewel blazing light, or
[9465] Jewel lapis lazuli blue, water-crystal, or
[9466] Earth's heart-essence jewel eye-ma-phug,
[9467] By stone's heart-essence jewel crystal,
[9468] Establish all Buddhas' state.
[9469] Thus it is spoken.
[9470] From Jewel Intricate Display:
[9471] The indicative example of Vajra-Mind:
[9472] White without stain, moon's color,
[9473] Examine from interval of dark and appearance.
[9474] By jewel luminosity without stain,
[9475] Endowed with five colors of appearance,
[9476] Five bodies not individually separate,
[9477] Not separate to front and back.
[9478] Great light of appear-clear Dharma-nature,
[9479] Clear Dharma-nature blazing all-as.
[9480] Supreme lamp making appearance,
[9481] In sky-expanse of great emptiness,
[9482] All appearance arises as light.
[9483] That arising itself is not separate.
[9484] Cannot be grasped by anyone.
[9485] If possessing wisdom eye,
[9486] Like full moon of self-appear without stain,
[9487] See beautiful-face mandala,
[9488] Meditate great perfect without distraction.
[9489] Thus it is spoken.
[9490] Wash that mirror like that with mantra-water, with devotion to one's root guru,
[9491] Bless with OM AH HUM hundred thousand times, scatter flowers with dependent-origination heart-essence, speak auspicious words,
[9492] Request rule with seven branches,
[9493] Speak auspicious words again,
[9494] Offer garments imagining five colored silks and incense powder.
[9495] All examples should precede.
[9496] Second, regarding actual direct introduction:
[9497] Lineage and
[9498] Direct introduction—two aspects.
[9499] Lineage:
[9500] Lineage through the Buddha's intention,
[9501] Lineage through signs of awareness-holders,
[9502] And lineage through personal ear-whispered transmission—three are spoken.
[9503] Actual direct introduction:
[9504] The precious instruction of direct introduction, the single vehicle,
[9505] Single family,
[9506] Single bindu,
[9507] Single eye of primordial wisdom.
[9508] When shown through the mirror of Vajrasattva as a single example,
[9509] Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.
[9510] The vastness free from elaboration,
[9511] The body ornamented with merit,
[9512] To the emanation Vajra Light-Vitality,
[9513] The Bhagavān of Infinite Splendor,
[9514] From the vastness of pure non-birth,
[9515] Emitted three drops of the supreme enlightenment essence,
[9516] From the manifest body appearing like a water-moon mandala,
[9517] Bringing forth the body-drop, the crystal secret body, established as example wisdom.
[9518] From the vastness of speech free from elaboration,
[9519] The speech-drop, extracting the essence of enlightenment mind nectar,
[9520] Introduction to the wisdom of meaning.
[9521] From the state unchanging like the vajra mind,
[9522] The mind-drop, bringing forth the clear lamp of enlightenment mind essence,
[9523] Established with certainty through the wisdom of signs.
[9524] The body-drop ornamented with five self-arisen wisdoms,
[9525] Through primordial wisdom naturally completely pure and stainless, clear without front or back,
[9526] Great direct-penetration wisdom,
[9527] Clear without outside or inside,
[9528] Non-dual wisdom,
[9529] From the inside of non-inside,
[9530] Through condition-free wisdom parts intermixed and clear,
[9531] Non-intermixed completely perfect wisdom,
[9532] The supreme inconceivable child-appearance and time simultaneously arisen,
[9533] Simultaneously arisen wisdom,
[9534] Holding the lineage of the body of infinite appearance,
[9535] Eliminating the thoughts of beings,
[9536] Called the great bodily relics.
[9537] Through the example showing the three bodies and five wisdoms, the wisdom of Vajrasattva is clear.
[9538] Though there are many forms of showing examples, among examples, that which becomes supreme is called the precious crystal.
[9539] Through showing by means of the crystal, naturally completely pure, clear without outside or inside,
[9540] Recognize the dharmakāya.
[9541] Relying on the inner light of the crystal,
[9542] From the wind possessing four limbs that becomes the life of prajñā,
[9543] Recognize the manner of clarity as the body of prajñā.
[9544] Relying on the light of outer clarity,
[9545] Recognize the manner of arising of light as the emanation body.
[9546] Through showing by means of the crystal support, recognize the nature of ground-abiding wisdom.
[9547] Recognize the wisdom holding the characteristic of inner clarity.
[9548] Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through outer clarity.
[9549] Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through dissolving inside.
[9550] Through showing the various appearances of the crystal,
[9551] Recognize the manner of appearing.
[9552] Through showing the nature of the crystal itself, recognize the single abiding nature.
[9553] Through the crystal possessing its own light, recognize as Rigpa wisdom.
[9554] These also, when summarized from the definite aspect of showing examples:
[9555] From the Tantra of Arranged Lamps:
[9556] Through intention signs and ear-continuum lineage,
[9557] The valid cognition of secret mantra meaning arises.
[9558] Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.
[9559] Relying on signs, confidence is born.
[9560] Through deciding the essence of meaning,
[9561] The three wisdoms established in the ground,
[9562] Abiding in the manner of a seed,
[9563] Through prajñā arising from conditions,
[9564] Through ripening in the manner of fruit,
[9565] The darkness of non-recognition is cleared.
[9566] Through the self-purification of obstacles to the knowable,
[9567] The fruit not sought is seen by oneself.
[9568] The meaning thus spoken should be introduced in sequence.
[9569] To that, first the general ground of self-arisen nature body
[9570] Should be introduced.
[9571] In that, nature, nature, and compassion abide as three.
[9572] That single bindu possessing the essence of empty Rigpa,
[9573] The teacher holds a single clear mirror,
[9574] Shows the student,
[9575] And speaks these words:
[9576] "This mirror of Samantabhadra's clear appearance,
[9577] "Through appropriate examples, makes one recognize the nature.
[9578] "That meaning of recognition is the introduction to clear appearance.
[9579] "First, the introduction to Samantabhadra's abiding nature.
[9580] "Rigpa abiding in direct penetration is like crystal.
[9581] "Rigpa, thought-free and clear, is like crystal.
[9582] "Rigpa abiding in spontaneous presence is like crystal.
[9583] "Rigpa, unceasing and direction-free, is like crystal."
[9584] Thus it is said.
[9585] Though five lights are clear to outer eye,
[9586] Possessing nature of clear from within,
[9587] Nature:
[9588] White light also abides not separate from that, demonstrating compassion.
[9589] Though crystal essence demonstrates primordially pure and three,
[9590] By non-separation, understand through that example how single bindu meaning abides within.
[9591] Then demonstrating delusion-base:
[9592] Extend crystal to sun-ray,
[9593] Demonstrate outer two interior lights,
[9594] Condition of cause: ignorance of one self-nature at time of base-appear arising from base.
[9595] Field possessing five colors,
[9596] Demonstrate mind searching all for that subtle white.
[9597] That beginning move arises together with light,
[9598] Arises as knowable's obscuration: co-arising ignorance.
[9599] By wisdom's sense-power transcending from All-Good base, separate distinction in one moment,
[9600] Complete Buddha in one moment,
[9601] Is before Buddha as great-grandfather without common of all Buddhas.
[9602] By this liberation manner,
[9603] Should know all first Buddha's arising manner and arising manner.
[9604] First Buddha without cause,
[9605] Buddha without beginning or end,
[9606] One wisdom eye without stain.
[9607] Thus spoken from Manjushri.
[9608] Demonstrating All-Good's liberation base.
[9609] Also, having known base-appear arising from base and liberating, speaks that immeasurable Buddhas not deluded in samsara now also arise from space.
[9610] That base-appear, sentient beings not knowing as self-appear,
[9611] Arises as affliction-obscuration of all-imagined ignorance.
[9612] Thus,
[9613] Delusion various arises by awareness rise-sleep habit-continuum.
[9614] That also like placing hopes on various colored crystal cloth,
[9615] Or placing each white light on each white color etc.
[9616] There, awareness-wisdom and concept-collection net.
[9617] Entering body's interior,
[9618] Manner of four-holding awareness abiding in heart center,
[9619] Give introduction to manner pervading all sentient beings.
[9620] That is also introduction of nature's delusion manner.
[9621] Delusion arising from condition like crystal light.
[9622] Various things appearing like crystal light.
[9623] Appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal.
[9624] Without exhaust, without increase, like crystal light.
[9625] Make all thus spoken understood, well apply sign meaning.
[9626] Sign meaning of liberating deluded sentient beings:
[9627] From Lamp Blaze:
[9628] Base itself, wisdom making fruit ripen.
[9629] By ripening in wisdom-body,
[9630] That essence-itself Dharma-body
[9631] Ripens in wisdom Dharma-body.
[9632] From thus speaking.
[9633] From heart center, wisdom three-stack lung wind and wisdom's two tones meeting,
[9634] Power becoming mind,
[9635] Example of abiding unmoving dissolving in base manner.
[9636] Example of white mind, interior light emanating outer.
[9637] Called sixth mind.
[9638] Example of five lights wisdom.
[9639] Awareness holding base.
[9640] That example introduction of mind and wisdom two is suitable.
[9641] Intermediate introduction: sound, light, ray three,
[9642] And Vajra-Mind heart-interval nadi path introduction etc. appropriate all, produce certain knowing in crystal.
[9643] Yogin applying essence and knowing, making confidence, should be diligent in experience.
[9644] Liberation manner as fruit:
[9645] Though above interior-clear primordially pure liberation base is clear as self-arise essence-itself body,
[9646] Called outer-clear,
[9647] Give introduction to mixing five lights and white two.
[9648] This has great essential point if wisdom exists.
[9649] Path wisdom or
[9650] Desiring wisdom without extremely not abiding middle,
[9651] Or desiring wisdom without in our great perfect primordially pure,
[9652] Though delusion pure from root,
[9653] Arising without ceasing two bodies.
[9654] Wisdom must exist in space,
[9655] That mixing of five lights and white is mirror wisdom.
[9656] Example of white arising separately, emanation-body emanating from enjoyment-body.
[9657] Those are introduction of Buddha-hood as all-knowing in two-possessing purity.
[9658] Called "who superior passed from Buddha nirvana":
[9659] Emanation-body and enjoyment-body dissolving into Dharma-body,
[9660] By being free from crystal sun's condition,
[9661] Abiding undeluded having seized stable ground at beginning's primordially pure base,
[9662] Though liberated like that, essence not separate,
[9663] By distinction of aware and not-aware,
[9664] Called all-knowing: all abiding only in wisdom-body.
[9665] Mainly possessing two wisdoms.
[9666] Existing as interior-clear, that essence delivering to cease ground and first human's common-base self-arise essence-itself body are not separate.
[9667] However, like sun obscured by cloud,
[9668] From portion of realization becoming manifest by liberating from all obscurations, knowing self-essence like liberation,
[9669] Beginning base and
[9670] End liberation ground two—very great distinction.
[9671] Great essential point.
[9672] Wisdom swirling in space like crystal light.
[9673] Dharma-body arising clear-pure like crystal itself.
[9674] Thus it is spoken.
[9675] That Dharma-body of knowing self-essence, self itself abiding in self-bed,
[9676] If desiring to hold stable ground of undeluded Dharma-body now also,
[9677] Great essential point is keeping undistracted, clear, snap in manner of great open naked self-clear,
[9678] From glorious holy guru protector of beings' mouth:
[9679] Dharma-body of knowing self-essence is self-bed itself,
[9680] All who desire to hold stable undeluded ground,
[9681] Essential point is doing not-wrong, not-deluded, not-distracted,
[9682] Let wisdom-possessing know intention like ocean.
[9683] Thus well spoken.
[9684] At time of all this introduction, relaxing freshly, self also producing uncommon new confidence, should demonstrate to others.
[9685] Also from World Sun Dharma-Lord Guru's mouth:
[9686] Should carefully give introductions in sequence.
[9687] Ha-le!
[9688] Ho-le!
[9689] Without portion of what exists.
[9690] Not introduction.
[9691] Not introduced, do not.
[9692] Do not declare non-Dharma action.
[9693] Do not follow for delusion.
[9694] Do not do bad non-Dharma actions taking guru etc.'s name.
[9695] Thus making instruction: need to make name and meaning together.
[9696] Respectfully place in mind thus all who have entered this Dharma in future times.
[9697] Second meaning: extensively demonstrating mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction has two aspects:
[9698] Mind's introduction of delusion reversing manner from root awareness,
[9699] And self-appear wisdom's introduction of awareness with self-appear.
[9700] First:
[9701] From Introduction Ornament:
[9702] E-ma-ho!
[9703] Manner of coming to mind by giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[9704] Reach expanding bliss of empty by giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[9705] Giving introduction of empty as awareness,
[9706] Awareness itself without space and wisdom two. Thus it is spoken.
[9707] In this, three:
[9708] Establishing inner mind by outer field's essential point,
[9709] Establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point,
[9710] Establishing supreme awareness itself by secret space's essential point.
[9711] First, demonstrating deluded baseless appearance field,
[9712] From two: demonstrating self-mind empty of appearance-holding.
[9713] First: these various outer white-red appearances, clear in expanse gathered by five elements of container-contents,
[9714] Except appearing on face of self-mind's delusion, outer meaning thing,
[9715] And inner mind's thing, both not established,
[9716] Should understand as like deluded hair-shadow and dream illusion appearance, nature of clear-appear without base-without empty miracle.
[9717] From Six Expanses:
[9718] All appearance is illusion,
[9719] Like dream and reflection.
[9720] Thus it is spoken.
[9721] From Root Wisdom:
[9722] Like dream, like illusion,
[9723] Like gandharva city,
[9724] Like-that arising and like-that abiding,
[9725] Like-that also not destroyed. Thus it is spoken.
[9727] Appearing to mind whatever appears,
[9728] Like appearance to impure sense-power of eye-defect's hair-shadow.
[9729] From that same source:
[9730] To mind itself existing as object,
[9731] Various appearances self-arise.
[9732] Name and color individually
[9733] Complete as two aspects of form.
[9734] Thus it is spoken.
[9735] Though appearing to mind, these outer-clear appearance manners are not self's mind,
[9736] Existing also without self,
[9737] Abiding as field,
[9738] Color,
[9739] Because seeing as shape etc.
[9740] Not mind because those do not exist in mind.
[9741] Here, giving introduction like dream delusion of clear-appear, not existing: these appearances of outer appearance fields like form etc.,
[9742] "This is form,"
[9743] Thinking color etc., arising-arising, first the appearance-field of arising, holding that is called "mind of appearance,"
[9744] Called "mind of grasping,"
[9745] Having seized essence, called "mind of field."
[9746] Questioning if that mind of appearance exists: not true by holding clear-appear without field,
[9747] Also not existing by color not established as essence seize,
[9748] Also not existing by examining in three: arise, cease, abide.
[9749] Called "giving introduction of mind itself as empty,"
[9750] Give introduction as wisdom Buddha without self-dissolving place.
[9751] Therefore ordinary Dharma and
[9752] Great perfect ordinary's appearance,
[9753] Not separating appearance field,
[9754] Desiring outer appearance field self-characteristic as mind
[9755] Is mistake into odor-with various-true mind-only.
[9756] Here, at time of giving introduction of appearance as mind, mind holding as appear-not-appear,
[9757] Mind of appearance to mind first meeting field,
[9758] After, examining that distinction as mental event, desiring called "mind of holding,"
[9759] Called "samsara: delusion-hold, delusion-appear, purify, abandon."
