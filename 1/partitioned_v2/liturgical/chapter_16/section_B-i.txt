[8491] Supporting the back toward the three kayas of the future,
[8492] Enjoying the three kayas of the present
[8493] Is making manifest the fruit of the buddhas,
[8494] Called abiding primordially in the equality of the three times.
[8495] Making the five wisdoms of the past the basis,
[8496] Directing the peak toward the five wisdoms of the future,
[8497] Making the five wisdoms of the present the path
[8498] Is called gathering the clear light of clarity,
[8499] The yoga of awareness in the equality of the three times.
[8500] Having confidence in the past awareness,
[8501] Holding the measure of the future awareness,
[8502] Making the present awareness the path
[8503] Is called the mother holding the son,
[8504] The yoga of awareness in the equality of the three times.
[8505] Holding the portion of the past thigle,
[8506] Directing the mind toward the future thigle,
[8507] Gathering the present thigles into one
[8508] Is called cutting the single unique root,
[8509] Called the yoga practitioner gathered in the equality of the three times.
[8510] Joining with the gap of the past expanse,
[8511] Expanding with the expanse of the future,
[8512] Abiding in one ground with the present expanse
[8513] Is called awareness entering the expanse,
[8514] Called abiding primordially connected in the equality of the three times.
[8515] Directing the nose toward the lamps of the past,
[8516] Holding in hand the lamp of the future,
[8517] Striking clarity upon the present lamps
[8518] Is the view of the self-pure lamp of the empty dhatu,
[8519] Appearance primordially in the equality of the three times.
[8520] Giving the path to the lights of the past,
[8521] Placing the mind upon the lights of the future,
[8522] Lowering the mind upon the present lights
[8523] Is called self-confidence reaching all appearances,
[8524] Primordially without gathering or separating in the equality of the three times.
[8525] Third, from that, the way signs, measures, and times certainly appear has three parts:
[8526] The signs of the three kayas of clear light,
[8527] The measure of spontaneously accomplished samadhi,
[8528] The time of unmoved equal placement.
[8529] The first is:
[8530] Again from that same source:
[8531] By direct placement in the first samadhi,
[8532] Through gradual familiarity with the three kayas,
[8533] In the yoga of the nature of entities,
[8534] This meaning becomes supremely near.
[8535] The samadhi experience of familiarity with the three kayas
[8536] Is not instantaneous arising—
[8537] All this is the gradual object of mind.
[8538] First, obtaining the nirmanakaya samadhi:
[8539] At that time, in one's own knowing,
[8540] All dharmas not seen before
[8541] Appear in the mind without thought.
[8542] The words of one's own pith instruction terms
[8543] Clear in the mind without being held.
[8544] For the person possessing good fortune,
[8545] The mind expanding by the taste of dharma,
[8546] For six or seven days the body
[8547] Does not feel what exists,
[8548] Rising above the earth,
[8549] The experience of going in mid-space
[8550] Arises as one's own activity field.
[8551] When awareness unfabricated is placed in the castle,
[8552] One obtains the nirmanakaya thus.
[8553] Passed that, by awareness unmoving,
[8554] The sambhogakaya itself also
[8555] In the continuum of one's own knowing,
[8556] Without all effort in self-appearance,
[8557] Arises thus as experienced taste.
[8558] Also the light appearances not seen before,
[8559] Who sees piece by piece—
[8560] This too trains toward the sambhogakaya.
[8561] For that yogi possessing fortune and family,
[8562] Each experience of self-clear knowing clears,
[8563] By familiarity with self-clear mind,
[8564] The inner clear, mind moving, is not cast outward,
[8565] Mind does not follow the traces of entities,
[8566] Worldly actions do not appear to mind.
[8567] By this one obtains the complete sambhogakaya.
[8568] Then, awareness in the sky,
[8569] By the view manner of great direct placement,
[8570] By equal placement without distraction,
[8571] Again the dharmakaya samadhi appears.
[8572] At that time, knowing clears from the depths,
[8573] Directly engaging like an infant,
[8574] This is the measure of increasing appearance.
[8575] By sharp and quick knowing,
[8576] One sees buddhas not seen before.
[8577] By this, at that time, people—
[8578] Hundreds of thousands of myriads appear to mind,
[8579] Crafts without knowing that the body's
[8580] Previous not-made actions,
[8581] All miracles and letters,
[8582] Signs, speech, and dependent arising,
[8583] Whatever was not seen before—
[8584] All this is experienced as taste,
[8585] Earth, water, fire, and wind.
[8586] Through this, sound too attains autonomy.
[8587] Summarily, the six clairvoyances as well
[8588] This fortunate one obtains,
[8589] And benefits both self and others—
[8590] This person shall accomplish.
[8591] Thus it is spoken.
[8592] Second, the measure of spontaneously accomplished samadhi:
[8593] From that very source:
[8594] The intention of the three self-arisen bodies
[8595] Is summarily found as experience-measures thus.
[8596] The yoga conduct of emanation-body—
[8597] Formerly nonexistent great compassion
[8598] Arises supreme within one's continuum.
[8599] At this time, emanation-body samadhi is obtained.
[8600] The experience of clear yet non-conceptual cognition
[8601] Is called enjoyment-body samadhi.
[8602] The uncontaminated emptiness bindu-body,
[8603] When self-arising without effort—
[8604] The samadhi of Dharma-body
[8605] This endowed yogin obtains.
[8606] Thus it is spoken.
[8592] Second, the measure of spontaneously perfect samadhi:
[8593] Again from that same source:
[8594] The self-arisen intention of the three bodies
[8595] Is found in summary as measures of experience thus.
[8596] Practicing the yoga of emanation-body,
[8597] Great compassion previously nonexistent
[8598] Arises supreme within one's own continuum.
[8599] At this time, the samadhi of emanation-body is obtained.
[8600] The experience of clear non-conceptual knowing
[8601] Is called the samadhi of enjoyment-body.
[8602] The bindu-body of uncontaminated emptiness,
[8603] When self-arising without effort—
[8604] The samadhi of Dharma-body
[8605] This yogin endowed obtains.
[8606] Thus it is spoken.
[8607] Third, the time of immovable equipoise has two aspects:
[8608] The time when luminosity appears manifestly,
[8609] And the time when instructions strike the arising-place.
[8610] First:
[8611] From that same source:
[8612] When all appearances become self-powered,
[8613] When awareness is demonstrated manifestly,
[8614] This is called the time of true-seeing intention.
[8615] When all appearances arise in self-direction,
[8616] When experience-seed increases,
[8617] This is called the time when awareness reaches balance.
[8618] When the power of arising persons ceases,
[8619] When cognition looks inward,
[8620] This is the time of striking awareness's arising-place.
[8621] When Dharma-nature, free from conditions, causes all appearances to spread wide in bliss,
[8622] This is called the time of mother-son Dharma-nature equality.
[8623] When the true light-rays of all Buddhas fill and expand one's body,
[8624] When body manifests enlightenment,
[8625] This is called the time of obtaining self-stability.
[8626] Thus it is spoken.
[8627] Second, the time of striking the instruction arising-place:
[8628] From Self-Arising:
[8629] When cognition-awareness arises in the continuum,
[8630] Recognize the face of body.
[8631] When realization arises in the continuum, recognize the face of awareness's field.
[8632] When samadhi becomes power, recognize the lamp's face of complete purity.
[8633] When special power arises,
[8634] Recognize the spreading of samadhi's path.
[8635] When seeing the body of awareness, know without desiring mind.
[8636] When special wisdom arises in the continuum, recognize demonic deception.
[8637] When difficulty-free conduct overflows the expanse,
[8638] Recognize wisdom's direction of entry.
[8639] When emptiness pervades the field, recognize light.
[8640] When lamp appears in the field,
[8641] Recognize space and field.
[8642] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8643] When appearance comes piece by piece,
[8644] The expert must thoroughly examine.
[8645] When extremely subtle and flickering,
[8646] Through familiarity, thoroughly settle.
[8647] When fluttering, subtle, and flickering,
[8648] Through seeing, thoroughly hold.
[8649] When round, subtle, and coiling,
[8650] The expert steadies samadhi without distraction.
[8651] When sinking, blazing, and hurling appear,
[8652] Through familiarity, hold the expanding appearance.
[8653] When truly appearing in every way,
[8654] The expert explains the gathering of appearance.
[8655] When without attachment and fixation,
[8656] The expert must know the method of holding.
[8657] This is the characteristic of secret mantra familiarity.
[8658] Thus it is spoken.
[8659] Second, the day-night luminosity wheel has three aspects:
[8660] Recognizing the space-luminosity arising-base,
[8661] Demonstrating lamp-experience from that,
[8662] Determining the day-night wheel manner of meditation.
[8663] First:
[8664] Although explained formerly,
[8665] Here it is thoroughly condensed, five clear demonstrations:
[8666] The manner of space,
[8667] The manner of lamp's location,
[8668] The manner of space-awareness arising,
[8669] The manner of taking experience,
[8670] The manner of special determination.
[8671] First:
[8672] The space-luminosity bliss-gone heart essence abides without difference in all sentient beings.
[8673] From Jewel Variegated:
[8674] Like butter spontaneously present within sesame or mustard seed,
[8676] Within sentient beings appearing as bodies,
[8677] The thus-gone seed
[8678] Abides with compatible light as self-nature.
[8679] From that abiding, through pure doors of entering the path,
[8680] Emerge variously and conduct benefit.
[8681] Sentient beings pervade like the sky—
[8682] The meaning of awareness is also just thus.
[8683] Thus it is spoken.
[8684] Where does it exist?
[8685] From that same source:
[8686] Ah! The location-condition of awareness
[8687] Abides within one's own heart center.
[8688] Holding the portions of father-mother two,
[8689] It abides as method and wisdom.
[8690] Holding the father's portion, method-body,
[8691] Holding the mother's, wisdom-body,
[8692] It abides as light and light-ray.
[8693] Thoroughly adorned by space and awareness,
[8694] It abides as spontaneously complete great bindu.
[8695] Thus it is spoken.
[8696] How do body and wisdom abide within awareness's expanse of light?
[8697] What are the determined locations?
[8698] From Power-Perfect:
[8699] Within each self, citta jewel,
[8700] Color-filled light blazes, vase-manner,
[8701] Within, wisdom-fire light blazes,
[8702] Measureless wisdoms many appear.
[8703] Upon each body essence,
[8704] Speech emanations numberless,
[8705] Mind intention unsurpassable, one.
[8706] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8707] The all-ground great dharma-arising treasure,
[8708] Awareness wisdom abides as mound,
[8709] Appearance hold-without, field-treasure,
[8710] Awareness wisdom abides in space.
[8711] Secret-assembly jewel eight-cornered treasure,
[8712] Awareness wisdom abides as mound,
[8713] Appearance hold-without, field-treasure,
[8714] Awareness wisdom abides in space.
[8715] Secret-assembly jewel eight-cornered treasure,
[8716] Awareness wisdom father-mother manner,
[8717] Life-assembly jewel four-cornered treasure,
[8718] Awareness wisdom abides in bindu,
[8719] Meaning-coil bandha measureless treasure,
[8720] Awareness wisdom abides as wrathful-body,
[8721] Cease-without clear two-door treasure,
[8722] Space and nadi-thread abide.
[8723] Emptiness sign-free sky treasure,
[8724] Awareness wisdom abides as light—
[8725] This is demonstrated as the secret treasure.
[8726] Thus it is spoken.
[8727] Moreover, that nature of awareness, base-heart location, abides within the five space-lights like a peacock egg.
[8728] When arising on the path-space, sky rainbow-light and
[8729] When reaching the end, like a fetus liberated from the eggshell.
[8730] From Power-Perfect:
[8731] The awareness abiding in the base
[8732] Perfects the three bodies in wisdom-space.
[8733] Like a peacock egg,
[8734] Within, light-wisdom clearly demonstrated.
[8735] The awareness arising on the path
[8736] Is demonstrated like a rainbow.
[8737] The awareness delivering to the end
[8738] Is like peacock chicks
[8739] Breaking through and emerging.
[8740] Thus it is spoken.
[8741] Moreover, when wisdom is unripe, all open;
[8742] At the time of appearance, light;
[8743] At the time of familiarity, body-appearance.
[8744] From that:
[8745] From the space without elaboration,
[8746] Unobstructed luminosity contact arises.
[8747] At the time of appearance, light appears;
[8748] At the time of perfection, self-appearance.
[8749] At the time of familiarity, becomes body.
[8750] By wisdom-method relation,
[8751] See the five ultimate mandalas.
[8752] Thus it is spoken.
[8753] The characteristics of thus-abiding body, awareness, space, and wisdom:
[8754] From that same source:
[8755] The characteristic of body is thus:
[8756] Unchanging, clear,
[8757] Empty, and free of concepts.
[8758] The characteristic of awareness is thus:
[8759] Subtle, emanating,
[8760] Nadi-thread, and moving.
[8761] The characteristic of space is thus:
[8762] Vast, spontaneously thick, infinitely empty,
[8763] Clear, warm, cool,
[8764] Holding the nature of flexibility and movement,
[8765] Pervading, rim-wall.
[8766] The characteristic of wisdom is thus:
[8767] Arising, arisen, self-clear,
[8768] From, knowing, and realizing.
[8769] Clear, blazing, infinitely pervading,
[8770] Appearing, dark, opening,
[8771] The supreme wisdom of emptiness-clear—
[8772] These are considered the characteristics of secret mantra.
[8773] Thus it is spoken.
[8774] Second, the manner of lamp's location:
[8775] For gods, one cubit.
[8776] For demigods, four fingers.
[8777] For humans, one color-point.
[8778] For animals, self-clear.
[8779] For pretas, like a sesame seed.
[8780] For hell-beings, like a horse-hoof.
[8781] For Buddhas, immeasurable.
[8782] Bodhicitta, one arrow;
[8783] For emanation-body, one fathom.
[8784] The existence of self-light wisdom-appearance
[8785] From that same source:
[8786] Wisdom locations, large and small,
[8787] From the six directions of appearance
[8788] Are thoroughly explained thus:
[8789] For those in Joyful, one cubit abides.
[8790] For those in Strife, four fingers abide.
[8791] For those with equal, one color-point.
[8792] For those with two, only self-clear.
[8793] For those with hunger, like sesame seed.
[8794] For those with suffering, like horse-hoof.
[8795] Thus it is explained they abide.
[8796] For Buddhas, immeasurable.
[8797] For Bodhisattvas, one arrow.
[8798] For emanation-bodies, one fathom abides.
[8799] For Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,
[8800] And emanation-bodies and gods,
[8801] They appear in manifest fields.
[8802] Below those, in five fields,
[8803] Undemonstrated, they are not seen.
[8804] Thus it is spoken.
[8805] Moreover, the great lamp-appearance of Buddha, Bodhisattva, and god triad self-appearing in intermediate space is due to vast fields; the other five are small because they are fields of one's own body.
[8806] 
[8807] Third, the arising manner of space-awareness has two aspects:
[8808] Space is the outer field-pervasion of great blue light, the self-glow of five lights existing within as five wisdoms; from that expanding, five-possessed great wisdom light two self-arise as field-appearance.
[8809] 
[8810] Awareness is the appearance of vajra nadi-thread with portion-body.
[8811] From Power-Perfect:
[8812] The view-essence of all Buddhas
[8813] Does not surpass space-awareness two.
[8814] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8815] From Vajra Nadi-Thread itself:
[8816] Portion-body is unthinkable.
[8817] To self-arisen space-lamp,
[8818] Self-appear light is unthinkable.
[8819] To bindu-empty lamp,
[8820] Ray-possessed bindu is unthinkable.
[8821] To the essence of five wisdoms,
[8822] Demonstrating words are unthinkable.
[8823] To condition-free field-appearance,
[8824] Cease-free arising is unthinkable.
[8825] Thus it is spoken.
[8826] Fourth, the manner of taking experience has two aspects:
[8827] Constriction by essential point, and
[8828] The experience-appearance arising from that.
[8829] First, also general placing-method, and
[8830] Particular essential-method, two:
[8831] First:
[8832] From Self-Arising:
[8833] In the sky of self-appearing Dharma-nature,
[8834] Awareness-wisdom without distraction,
[8835] When placed in hold-free state,
[8836] See pure wisdom's self-appearance;
[8837] Reverse non-awareness's delusion-appearances.
[8838] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8839] Upon the banner without setting,
[8840] The lamp without change is clear.
[8841] Upon wisdom without concepts,
[8842] The five lights without clear-obscure are clear.
[8843] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8844] Upon jewel precious nectar,
[8845] By doing and meditating, one does not find.
[8846] Upon lamp's space-appearance,
[8847] Examine without distraction, clear, without holding.
[8848] Thus, not distracted from meaning,
[8849] This is the precious nectar lamp.
[8850] Without release and placing, the supreme finding;
[8851] Without holding, self-liberation.
[8852] Thus it is spoken.
[8853] Second:
[8854] From Thalgyur:
[8855] Body's essential point is by resonance.
[8856] Wisdom's posture is by pure.
[8857] Bindu coils and stirs, accomplishing.
[8858] Light extends and gathers.
[8859] Connection-possessed restraining is wind's essential point.
[8860] Entering action is distinguished by end.
[8861] By that changer, wind ceases.
[8862] Join with delusion's encounter.
[8863] Awareness's essential point: releasing and
[8864] Coiling, placing in sky.
[8865] Space's essential point: gathering and
[8866] Drawing, joining element-overflow.
[8867] Appearance's essential point: increasing and ceasing,
[8868] Various self-liberations.
[8869] Thus it is spoken.
[8870] Moreover, when seeing body, look at that perfect essential point's resonance without changing.
[8871] When at wisdom-fortress-mouth etc., posture does not change.
[8872] When bindu does not expand, roll to eye-center and constrict light-root.
[8873] When light overflows, place at brow.
[8874] When concepts scatter, bind and emit wind.
[8875] Awareness's essential point: release nadi-thread to sky.
[8876] Space's essential point: gather to center, lead from eye-corners, look.
[8877] These are all essential points.
[8878] Second, thus when taking experience, the essential points of space-awareness gradually arising through experience:
[8879] From first experience-taking until perfect end.
[8880] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8881] That self-appearing awareness-thing
[8882] Abides in wisdom's nadi-thread.
[8883] Like swift-flying winged ones
[8884] Going everywhere in mere moments,
[8885] When reached by arrow,
[8886] Becomes like swift deer.
[8887] Then, not distracted from meaning,
[8888] Like bees circling nectar.
[8889] Then, when looking at self-appearance,
[8890] It abides like a mirage.
[8891] Then, not distracted from meaning,
[8892] Becomes only movement or fluttering.
[8893] Not distracted from that meaning,
[8894] Becomes sinking and blazing.
[8895] Therefore, when looking very carefully,
[8896] See light-appearance without going or coming.
[8897] When stable in that meaning,
[8898] See the bindu-empty lamp.
[8899] When truly looking at that,
[8900] See bindu with body.
[8901] Not distracted from that meaning,
[8902] Delusion-appearances become seen as enjoyment-body.
[8903] All those body-appearances
[8904] Are like illusion-rainbow.
[8905] Becoming thoroughly stable in that,
[8906] Day and night without—
[8907] Like the eye of a vixen,
[8908] Without day and night.
[8909] Self-appearing mandala is thus.
[8910] Thus it is spoken.
[8911] Moreover, all empty-form rainbow-light bindu-bodies etc.
[8912] Are widely said to exist in outer intermediate space, and
[8913] One holds that they exist there,
[8914] But this is error, not thus.
[8915] All exist within the clear light-root of the inner body.
[8916] By the clarity of eye's light-root, one sees empty-forms inwardly.
[8917] Moreover, the heart's resonance-root pervading all and emanating
[8918] Is now the time of base-appearance arising.
[8919] Knowing self-face and clearly placing in self-glow,
[8920] Going increasingly clear,
[8921] When wind-mind pure, seeing what spontaneous appearance is within body, when entering within as power-base dissolves,
[8922] Reaching measure, goes to cease.
[8923] When setting again, base-appearance dissolves into base, liberating into primordial purity,
[8924] When that appearance appears to expand, expanding without self-characteristic.
[8925] There is no obscuration from reversing inward.
[8926] Here, what tantra and instruction say exists in outer sky:
[8927] For now, said intentionally—when placing eye on outer sky condition, the portion seen and seeming to exist there.
[8928] Naturally, if it existed outside, others could also see it;
[8929] Know it does not exist outside.
[8930] That others do not see one's empty-form is due to body obscuration.
[8931] Self-seeing is like seeing sun-arisen appearance within the hole of seeing-arising through pure light-root's gap.
[8932] The proof: by seeing empty-forms with closed eyes, one knows they exist within.
[8933] Therefore, body-appearances etc. appear as if existing in outer fields, though not existing there—
[8934] Like face appearing when looking in mirror.
[8935] In the mirror of clear inner light-root,
[8936] That heart-awareness's face-like resonance-appearance
[8937] Arises from the portion of pure light-root's quality, seen within though not in field.
[8938] Outer and inner two portions mixing in mere appearance—delusions also, many are true.
[8939] Understanding manner thus, a person possessing wisdom, arisen from Great Perfection's expanse, is called
[8940] A yogin like myself of various self-liberation.
[8941] Joining these manners with confident scripture:
[8942] From the great Lion Power-Perfect Tantra:
[8943] All those body-appearances
[8944] Are not field-appearances.
[8945] Like a young girl
[8946] To the mirror's clear characteristic,
[8947] Seeing her own face appear—
[8948] To Dharma-nature's field-sky,
[8949] Awareness-appearance arises as body.
[8950] Seeing one's own location-condition
[8951] Does not exist in field.
[8952] Pure reference manifestly clear,
[8953] With one's own center and mandala.
[8954] Though wisdom-meaning has no field,
[8955] At sentient-being time, appears like field.
[8956] Great realization in seen field,
[8957] Great bliss in understood field,
[8958] Great experience in seen appearance,
[8959] Self-awareness alone, supreme companion.
[8960] Because not existing in the field of appearance,
[8961] From Vajra Nadi-Thread itself:
[8962] Portion-body is unthinkable.
[8963] Thus it is spoken.
[8964] This has a reason to be understood; intelligent ones should know it.
[8965] Naturally easy to realize, saying body-appear has no contradiction,
[8966] For the confused, it should be explained that space-awareness and lamp-appearance in outer sky are easy to realize.
[8967] The reason for understanding within oneself is as before.
[8968] Fifth, the manner of special determination:
[8969] By the essential point of awareness without change,
[8970] First, though transcending from base and deluding in samsara, awareness does not go bad.
[8971] Then, when the lama introduces the face, losing and wandering, later at deciding time there is joy.
[8972] At first losing, the two awarenesses of delusion-time have no good-bad distinction.
[8973] Awareness not meditated and
[8974] At time of meditating, without distinction,
[8975] At time of wandering and
[8976] At time of passing, awareness has no good-bad.
[8977] At time of going to sleep and
[8978] At time of waking and
[8979] At time of going-coming, awareness has no good-bad distinction, like thus.
[8980] However, there is only dream joy-suffering of good-bad appearance manner;
[8981] Depending on that, one meditates the path.
[8982] It is not hope that essence goes to good,
[8983] For awareness has no transfer-change.
[8984] Thus also from Self-Arising:
[8985] E ma ho!
[8986] This precious jewel nectar,
[8987] At the time of beginningless time,
[8988] I lost the precious jewel.
[8989] At that time, wandering wrongly in suffering.
[8990] That precious jewel nectar,
[8991] Has no place to find by searching.
[8992] Self-arisen from self, realized by self.
[8993] That precious jewel nectar,
[8994] Not feeling loss, feeling finding.
[8995] By losing, things without characteristics;
[8996] Possessing joy's glow by finding.
[8997] Time of finding and time of losing,
[8998] Realized in one state without distinction.
[8999] Thus it is spoken.
[9000] Moreover, that losing in self-awareness's state, though finding from self's state,
[9001] From self-awareness's one wheel,
[9002] Does not enter elsewhere.
[9003] Losing jewel in king's treasury, doing suffering by jewel's absence.
[9004] Though joy-bliss expands by finding from treasury, both do not move from one treasury, like thus.
[9005] Samsara-nirvana two appearing from awareness's state is also thus.
[9006] This is the secret word of determining the self-essential-point of supreme wish-fulfillment, realizing vast Dharma-nature's expanse.
[9007] Second, demonstrating lamp-experience from that has three aspects:
[9008] Preliminary characteristics of place,
[9009] Actual lamp-pressing method,
[9010] From that, manner of appearance-arising.
[9011] First:
[9012] Abandoning all actions of this life,
[9013] Making the holy lama pleased,
[9014] Sitting with three immovables in a room decorated by darkness in a very secluded place,
[9015] Perfecting lama-yoga, meditating, placing request from heart.
[9016] From Thalgyur:
[9017] Lamp-pressing is thus:
[9018] By faithful one, mind-free from samsara,
[9019] Do lama-offering and giving,
[9020] Abandoning all samsara connections,
[9021] In secluded direction or charnel-ground,
[9022] One must abide alone, abandoning companions.
[9023] Thus it is spoken.
[9024] Second:
[9025] Placing on AH, and
[9026] Entering clearly, two:
[9027] First:
[9028] Sitting cross-legged, placing on red-clear clear round light-appearance by thumb-finger pressing, taking experience.
[9029] Making sessions short, number many,
[9030] Releasing thumb-finger effort, looking slowly,
[9031] Seeing appearance by pressing again is called Dharma-nature manifest appearance.
[9032] From that same source:
[9033] By one's own thumb and finger,
[9034] Press the bindu-empty lamp.
[9035] What arises from that pressing
[9036] Is Dharma-nature manifest appearance.
[9037] Thus it is spoken.
[9038] Entering clearly:
[9039] Then from five-light appearance, first like smoke,
[9040] Like dull illusion,
[9041] Like hovering clouds,
[9042] Like emanating fire sparks,
[9043] Sun and moon,
[9044] Like star forms,
[9045] Like intermediate-space rainbow,
[9046] White clear light,
[9047] Yellow clear,
[9048] Red clear,
[9049] Green clear,
[9050] Blue,
[9051] Various,
[9052] Net pattern,
[9053] Arising rays,
[9054] Round gatherings,
[9055] Bindus,
[9056] Stupas,
[9057] God-bodies,
[9058] At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here-there, far-near,
[9059] By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.
[9060] From Thalgyur:
[9061] From that, wisdom-expanding experience,
[9062] Also of color and shape,
[9063] Pervading all outer and inner clearly,
[9064] Certainly expanding from above to above.
[9065] At this time, body-speech bliss signs;
[9066] Join with appearance measure and manner.
[9067] Thus it is spoken.
[9068] Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:
[9069] From first red-yellow round,
[9070] Later appears as five-light rim.
[9071] Also from moving by wind's essential point,
[9072] Essential point of holding outward slowly.
[9073] Then by taking clear portion as experience,
[9074] Lamp like mirror,
[9075] Light like slice,
[9076] Expanding with body from bindu like bowl.
[9077] From that:
[9078] Thus pressing appearance:
[9079] First pure red,
[9080] Complete empowerment, round, complete self-clear.
[9081] From two pure fingers become three.
[9082] Then by pressing again and again,
[9083] The colors of five wisdoms—
[9084] White, red, green, blue, yellow—
[9085] Appear in field, effort.
[9086] Then also outer without effort,
[9087] Go-come by wind's portion,
[9088] From mirror-pure shape like,
[9089] Appear as portions of two and three.
[9090] From constant familiarity with that itself,
[9091] Also by five-color light,
[9092] Edge-cut appears from mere slice,
[9093] See measure from mere field-edge.
[9094] From finding familiarity measure from that,
[9095] With body to bindu center,
[9096] Abide while in pure half-body,
[9097] To that with five-five pairs,
[9098] Connect with very clear bindu,
[9099] Possessing father-mother body-appearance,
[9100] Pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing.
[9101] Thus it is spoken.
[9102] At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise.
[9103] Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and
[9104] Dharma-nature pure appearance, awareness, and
[9105] Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala,
[9106] Again conducting Dharma-nature cease-appearance.
[9107] From Thalgyur:
[9108] Wisdom-perfect appearance and
[9109] From Dharma-nature first appearance,
[9110] From three appearances perfecting, become ceasing.
[9111] Thus it is spoken, and:
[9112] At this time, body-speech-mind measures;
[9113] When seeing individual appearances,
[9114] Signs complete by ripening in self,
[9115] Ceasing measures all manifestly appear.
[9116] Thus it is spoken.
[9117] Thus by taking experience, supreme effort ones: three years;
[9118] Middle ones: five years;
[9119] Last ones: seven years, eleven months,
[9120] Six days: seeing Dharma-nature cease-appearance, liberating into light-body.
[9121] From that same source:
[9122] By great-small effort in this,
[9123] By days, months, years,
[9124] Certainly accomplish at individual times,
[9125] From times without much moving,
[9126] Reach individual measures.
[9127] Thus it is spoken.
[9128] This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking.
[9129] Third, determining the day-night wheel manner has four aspects:
[9130] Gathering sense-organs to essential point of continuum, closing memory's door;
[9131] Putting knowable objects in vase at dawn, wisdom clear directly;
[9132] At morning, demonstrating clear wisdom, all arisen feelings pure in self-place;
[9133] Striking with vast appearance by day,
[9134] Suppressing all signs.
[9135] Though these were explained formerly,
[9136] Here also explained as leap-over companion, summarizing: taking experience,
[9137] There is distinction slightly different from former.
[9138] Daytime, looking at manifest by elephant-gaze,
[9139] Releasing to self-ceasing delusion-appearances, suppressing signs.
[9140] Nighttime, placing cognition on bindu-empty lamp;
[9141] When that bindu expands, cognition also expands clear portion;
[9142] When decreasing, cognition goes increasingly subtle, in the state of going to referenceless end, equipoise without thought of emanating or gathering references.
[9143] As sleep approaches, placing mind in the state of dissolving empty bindu at the forehead center,
[9144] Seize the essence of sleep-luminosity.
[9145] At midnight, holding mind to the luminosity within the heart and sleeping,
[9146] Dreams liberate into luminosity, the continuum of habits ceasing.
[9147] Then at dawn, by lion's gaze casting consciousness to a white AH in the bow-span of sky,
[9148] The meaning free of clear-empty elaboration arises from within.
[9149] Meditate abiding in that state for as long as possible.
[9150] From Six Expanses:
[9151] Pressing the bodily posture,
[9152] Cast consciousness to the range of sky.
[9153] Likewise, eyes to the space between,
[9154] By elephant gaze
[9155] Place in great spreading without memory.
[9156] Thus cast awareness to sky.
[9157] Without separating from this,
[9158] The yogin who meditates continuously
[9159] Expands appearances by day.
[9160] At nighttime, in one's own dwelling,
[9161] To hold the measure of four equal times,
[9162] Gathering sense doors oneself,
[9163] To the lamp of empty bindu,
[9164] The endowed yogin places mind.
[9165] When that bindu expands,
[9166] Place consciousness expanding as well.
[9167] When bindu becomes subtle,
[9168] Bindu increasingly subtle,
[9169] Place consciousness increasingly subtle.
[9170] By essential point of sleep and dream,
[9171] Extract root of former attachment habits.
[9172] Thus in all times of night,
[9173] The fortunate endowed yogin acts.
[9174] By this, reach self-expansion of appearances.
[9175] Thus it is spoken.
[9176] Thus by taking experience in the day-night wheel continuum,
[9177] Delusory appearances self-cease, liberating into luminosity.
[9178] From that same source:
[9179] By body, field, and awareness,
[9180] Hold all measures of pure self-appearance.
[9181] Having grasped the measure of self-appearance thus,
[9182] Appearances of six classes' delusion cease.
[9183] At the time of ceasing that,
[9184] Awareness reaches the measure.
[9185] When thus reaching the measure,
[9186] One's own body also does not appear.
[9187] The flesh-blood body produced by elements
[9188] Because elements are pure in their own place,
[9189] Because this appears as field,
[9190] The mind-body grasped by delusion
[9191] Because elements dissolve in their own place,
[9192] This also dissolves, not appearing in its own place.
[9193] The light-body grasped by awareness
[9194] Is like the water-moon mandala.
[9195] At this time, near Dharma-nature cessation,
[9196] Whoever becomes familiar with this, Buddha-field.
[9197] Then, having exhausted the three bodies' limits,
[9198] Obtain the action-free perfect body.
[9199] At this time, all limits of body
[9200] Are near to freedom.
[9201] The yogin familiar with the base
[9202] Also empties one's own place.
[9203] The yogin familiar with the path
[9204] Exhausts coarse elemental stains.
[9205] Whoever is familiar with the fruit
[9206] Reaches the non-return ground by this.
[9207] Thus it is spoken.
[9208] Moreover, the distinction between light-body and samadhi-body: the light-body, awareness's self-light without stain, is beyond the range of sentient beings' sight, visible only to Buddha-eye,
[9209] The samadhi god-body should be understood as having the distinction of appearing to those with god-eye among sentient beings possessing very clear, pervasive particles of the four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum.
[9210] Third, extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse has three aspects:
[9211] Briefly demonstrating the essence,
[9212] Extensively explaining the nature,
[9213] Summarizing the meaning by aspect.
[9214] First:
[9215] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[9216] Also, what are the five intentions?
[9217] By intention of mountain's general meaning, transcend through view.
[9218] By intention of wisdom's general filling, grasp the ground.
[9219] By intention of bindu's range-penetration, examine the manner of appearance arising.
[9220] By intention of sun-moon equal gap, deliver to meaning's end.
[9221] By intention of ocean expanse-penetration, deliver awareness to space. Thus it is spoken.
[9222] Second, from five:
[9223] First, the essence of mountain's general meaning intention is awareness of great perfect nature, luminosity without transfer or change, space and wisdom non-dual.
[9224] When realizing that by sense-power,
[9225] When space-awareness appears as field, view, intention, conduct, and fruit arise as four-fours for best, middle, and last three sense-powers of the person, thus twelve portions.
[9226] From Power-Perfect:
[9227] At the time when mountain's general meaning intention arises,
[9228] Reach the end of great perfect view.
[9229] For best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three views arise.
[9230] For best sense-power, the view of wisdom-appearance spontaneously arising
[9231] Is realizing awareness of self's wisdom without realization together with body.
[9232] At that time, intention is unmoving in clarity, like planets and stars arising on the ocean.
[9233] Conduct is ceaseless power-arising conduct, like casting sky-spear.
[9234] Fruit is seeing appearance of birthless self-arising.
[9235] The view of middle sense-power
[9236] Realizes only self's awareness without birth.
[9237] Intention is free from concept portions, like flags attaching to ocean.
[9238] Conduct is unblocked spontaneous, like mad-one.
