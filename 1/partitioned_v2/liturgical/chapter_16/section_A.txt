[7491] Also not thus peace itself;
[7492] Not knowing direct insight:
[7493] Like Meru mountain king,
[7494] Not capable to break by whoever.
[7495] Not liberate by antidote;
[7496] Not knowing self-pure without searching:
[7497] Like desiring clear sediment in muddy water,
[7498] Not clear later-later.
[7499] Although that itself clear: not dharmata;
[7500] Not knowing spontaneous self-appearance: like ordinary fool appearance,
[7501] Not reverse apparent attachment.
[7502] By thus saying: should know vital point of self-by-self liberating like water trace.
[7503] This also: from two mind levels—
[7504] Self-liberation with effort:
[7505] Identify whatever arisen affliction, place in self-place—train power in great equal self-liberation of pure abiding-movement nature, self-liberating complete complete gone without wandering even moment.
[7506] Without effort:
[7507] That arisen incapable to bear, self-liberated dharmata—
[7508] Liberate by nature nature or force without needing abandon that view-method to that.
[7509] These two mind levels: first distinction and
[7510] Abide like before-after.
[7511] From That Itself:
[7512] These two mind levels:
[7513] All with effort and without effort.
[7514] Place all with effort in self-place,
[7515] All measures of familiarized appearance:
[7516] Itself pure primordial wisdom appearance.
[7517] When self-dawning to all outer-inner,
[7518] Not arise by that condition.
[7519] Although those arise-change until,
[7520] Liberate in self-place itself by self-place.
[7521] From that: yogi appearance.
[7522] All without effort thus:
[7523] Self-by-self liberated to self itself,
[7524] From self blank self self-liberated—
[7525] Like splitting all iron by iron, and
[7526] Like breaking all stone by stone:
[7527] Self antidote self itself great,
[7528] By realizing nature complete great.
[7529] Whatever familiarized thus:
[7530] Find all meanings of non-searching placing,
[7531] Spread great bliss without meditating,
[7532] Directly know in nature itself.
[7533] Through whomsoever this wisdom meets,
[7534] Even they who bear inexpiable misdeeds,
[7535] Through habituating but to this alone—
[7536] Doubtless, they attain liberation.
[7537] Thus it is proclaimed.
[7538] The second: specific explanation of primordially-liberated ground-body, having three parts:
[7539] First, the demonstration that since liberation is finished from the beginning, at present self-liberation occurs without need for antidote of effort or striving. Second, the instruction not to transgress from the nature of that abiding-reality. Third, resting without having experienced going elsewhere from merely basisless self-dissolution in natural condition.
[7540] First: From the Pearl Garland:
[7541] Not through effort is liberation attained,
[7542] */ From the beginning abiding liberated.
[7543] And further:
[7544] Through non-recognition itself self-occurred,
[7545] */ Cause of delusion from the beginning purified.
[7546] */ Kun-gzhi as dharmakaya self-appeared,
[7547] */ Stream of birth cut at the root.
[7548] */ Yid-bzhin dgongs-pa primordially abiding,
[7549] */ Movement-makers self-settled.
[7550] */ Breath from the beginning stream-cut,
[7551] */ Birth and death from the start nonexistent.
[7552] */ Desire's qualities primordially perfected,
[7553] */ Attachment's extreme is cultivation itself.
[7554] */ Limbs unmoved, primordially gone,
[7555] */ Beings' path from the beginning traversed.
[7556] */ Spoken speech inexpressible,
[7557] */ From the beginning beyond speech and thought's object.
[7558] */ Thought's emanation-gather primordially empty,
[7559] */ From the beginning abiding in great meditation.
[7560] */ Defilements self-purified,
[7561] */ Defilement-less great zang-thal abiding.
[7562] */ Through made-by not having arising-place,
[7563] */ From the very beginning free of action and actor.
[7564] */ From basis other-arisen dharma not existing,
[7565] */ From the beginning self-occurred single-alone.
[7566] */ One and two's number exhausted,
[7567] */ Thig-le free from moon.
[7568] */ Darkness from the beginning thoroughly purified,
[7569] */ Rig-pa's appearance luminosity-pervading.
[7570] */ Samsara changeless, ceased-finished,
[7571] */ From the beginning spontaneously-perfect buddha-ground.
[7572] */ Sign's entity empty-purified,
[7573] */ Self-grasping thought from the beginning exhausted.
[7574] */ Conditions by conditions self-liberated,
[7575] */ Reference-points are cog-bzhag.
[7576] Thus.
[7577] Second: From Thal-'gyur...
[7578] Nature of great perfection's extreme:
[7579] Dharmas settled in their own place,
[7580] Appearance-awareness dharmata unity—
[7581] Ye-grol reaches cog-bzhag itself.
[7582] Dgongs-pa beyond thought,
[7583] Marked settled in self-place purified,
[7584] Empty and entity extremes liberated,
[7585] Movement-exhausted, concept not existing,
[7586] Thought-exhausted, mind beyond.
[7587] Thus.
[7588] From the previous:
[7589] */ Elements five themselves primordially pure,
[7590] */ Appearance as luminosity itself liberated.
[7591] */ Sense-faculties five themselves cer-settled,
[7592] */ Grasping's objects five self-place liberated.
[7593] Thus.
[7594] Third: From Thal-'gyur:
[7595] Rang-mind liberation called—
[7596] */ From one to one gone not.
[7597] */ Mind not-existing who liberates,
[7598] */ Basis perfected, going-coming not.
[7599] */ Examined not-found, cause-reason not,
[7600] */ Basis-root not-existing, empty-luminosity abides.
[7601] */ That mind self-luminous abiding,
[7602] */ Liberated by essence, direction-partition not.
[7603] */ Liberated by time, reference-basis not.
[7604] */ Liberated effort-less, effort not.
[7605] */ Liberated by confidence, effort-striving not.
[7606] */ To that, liberation by confidence explained.
[7607] */ Ye-from liberated, returning-basis not.
[7608] */ Self-liberated, antidote not.
[7609] */ Cer-loosened at seeing-place also,
[7610] */ Completely liberated, effort-less.
[7611] Thus.
[7612] That also: gates-three ye-from liberated, from-beginning effort by liberation not-needed. Body's mudra-turning etc. whatsoever not-needed—elements self-essence liberated, six-realms back not-returning. Speech's effort, essence-recitation etc. do not-needed—expression clear-pure liberated, speaking all sound-meaning's essence liberated. Mind's effort, meditation cultivation etc. do not-needed—what thought, dgongs-pa's essence liberated. Other from arising not, self-liberated, antidote existing not-possible.
[7613] Thus self-liberation's essence: antidote not-existing.
[7614] To liberation called...
[7615] Settled-only by liberation,
[7616] Knowing-only by essence-peak liberated,
[7617] Ye-grol, rang-grol, cer-grol,
[7618] Completely-liberated and so forth—
[7619] Though many, this great rang-grol
[7620] Antidote not-existing, effort not-needed is shown.
[7621] Third: extensive explanation of rang-grol's dgongs-pa, having three:
[7622] Essence briefly shown, nature individually explained, meaning's conclusion.
[7623] First: From Pearl Garland:
[7624] To rig-pa without cessation,
[7625] */ Delusion-cause not-existing, returning-place not.
[7626] */ Ye-grol is definitely transcended,
[7627] */ Rang-grol is objects-conditions exhausted,
[7628] */ Cer-grol is appearances purified,
[7629] */ Extreme-liberation is four-extremes ceased,
[7630] */ Single-liberation is many emptied.
[7631] Thus: outer-inner non-dual zang-thal's rig-pa, direct like crystal without stain. To rig-pa basis-not-existing's essence by, delusion's cause not-existing, root separated—path not. Path not-existing, result three-realms returning-place not. That ye-from liberated-finished, sky-like dgongs-pa spontaneously-accomplished-finished. Great five liberation-manners with, common vehicles all from particularly transcended essence.
[7632] Second: five—ye-grol, rang-grol, cer-grol, mtha'-grol, gcig-grol's nature extensively explained.
[7633] First ye-grol: relying upon returning-basis not-existing's essence, view-meditation effort-striving dependent all shown. Ye-she pervading, generally released, made and altered not-existing's meaning. From-whence also not-arisen, to-where also not-gone, wherever not-abiding, change not-existing's meaning.
[7634] Liberation is not like untying—view-meditation by effort not-needed. Liberation called: from abiding in rang-lugs, accepting-rejecting not-existing's meaning.
[7635] Thus body-speech-mind three relaxed-settled in rang-lugs, mind itself naturally arrived—to liberation called. That also permanently thus abiding, from common vehicles transcended.
[7636] Example of ye-from liberated...
[7637] A-li-ka's fruit, primordially ripened—
[7638] Now ripening cause not-existing, like.
[7639] Ye-grol having three: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner.
[7640] Ye-grol's understanding: not adventitious, from beginning liberated-finished. Now again liberating cause not-existing's essence—rig-pa itself from delusion not-experienced arisen.
[7641] Ye-grol as placing's establishment, having three: reason by establishment, scripture by establishment, logical-reason by establishment.
[7642] Reason by establishment: ye-from rig-pa itself liberated's essence. Rig-pa to basis not-existing, returning-place not. Root not-existing, arising-place not. Characteristics not-existing, certainty not-reached. Birth not-existing, liberating cause not-existing.
[7643] That also as ye-grol sign: meditation-accomplishment whatsoever by characteristics seeing not. That also cause-effect sequence-not's reason by established. Rig-pa to continuum not-existing, result not—karma and ripening existing not-possible.
[7644] Scripture by establishment: From Brtson-pa-don-ldan:
[7645] */ Mind itself ye-from liberated,
[7646] */ Outside from liberated condition how possible?
[7647] Thus.
[7648] Logical-reason by establishment: gtad-yal-rag-gzhag's logical-reason by accomplished. Gtad-pa ye-from liberated, that itself self-place liberated—ye-from liberated because.
[7649] That also: mind from arising-place not-existing, abiding-place not-existing, going-place not-existing's essence—ye-from liberated known.
[7650] Liberation-manner: mind empty is liberation called, or not-liberated called convention-only not-designatable. Ye-from liberated-finished's sign: now that to again liberate not-needed—mind ye-from buddha-ed.
[7651] Ye-from liberated that to: liberating cause not-existing known.
[7652] Second rang-grol: relying upon antidote not-existing's essence, lama's instruction dependent all shown.
[7653] Thus: appearing-sounding dharmas all, arisen also self from arisen...
[7654] Liberated also self-liberated—
[7655] Example like sky and cloud.
[7656] Thus: object-other dependent cultivation, view and conduct defect-possessing like not. Liberation by meaning called: dharmas exhausted to.
[7657] Rang-grol having three: understanding, establishment, liberation-manner.
[7658] Rang-grol's understanding: antidote not-existing's meaning. Appearance itself from appearance self-liberated—apart from appearance, dharmata whatsoever not. Thus empty etc., itself by liberated, apart not.
[7659] Example: alcohol-sick by alcohol destroyed, poison by poison destroyed, iron by iron cut—etc. like. Afflictions itself, that itself by liberated—rang-grol called.
[7660] Rang-grol as placing's establishment, having three: reason by established, scripture by established, logical-reason by established.
[7661] Reason by established: dharmata's reason by established. Liberation all rang-grol is—other by untied like not established. If other-liberation is, entity one form different appearing not-possible like. Entity's characteristic, entity certainty reached like.
[7662] Scripture by established: From Sems-sde:
[7663] */ Liberation self-occurred, other from not.
[7664] Thus.
[7665] Logical-reason by established: rang-grol-chen-po controversy-basis not-existing's logical-reason by accomplished established. Thus appearance rang-grol is—antidote other dependent not.
[7666] Liberation-manner: self by self-liberated, apart not, other not. From other text also: desire-possessing desire path made liberation etc. explained. From Kye-rdo-rje:
[7667] */ Like fire by burned to,
[7668] */ Fire that itself by warm do.
[7669] Thus etc. spoken like.
[7670] Appearance appearance self's peak from liberated itself...
[7671] Apart from appearance, liberating-cause or liberated-condition other not.
[7672] That basis-not liberated, abiding's support not, basis-root not. That basis-root not-existing's mind itself—that: From Gsang-snying:
[7673] */ Basis-root not-existing's mind this,
[7674] */ Male female not, neuter not,
[7675] */ Color not, shape not,
[7676] */ Signless not, lineage not.
[7677] Thus: that itself self from apart returning-place not, going-place not, birth not-experienced. Whence arisen's place not that—itself self not-existing's dharma, apart not: rang-grol called.
[7678] Example: snake's knot, who by not-untied, self-liberated—like.
[7679] Third cer-grol: relying upon seeing-yal's essence, tantra scripture dependent all shown.
[7680] Cer by seeing only by, that itself liberated—mother-child meet, liberation is. Appearance that itself thought not-altered, appearance by not-cut settled, self-pure liberated.
[7681] Cer-grol seeing-yal four: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner, example.
[7682] Cer-grol's understanding: cer by seeing only by, that itself seeing liberated. Moment first self to see or hear, awareness only by liberated—that to dharmata direct's reckoning reaches.
[7683] Cer-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7684] Reason: gtang-yal where also not-perceived established. Appearance seeing-peak, appearance only liberated. Awareness moving-peak, moving only liberated. Empty self-place's essence by, form cer seeing—form slight-only shown, that itself liberated. Thus sound etc. also.
[7685] That liberated how known? Form as seeing, form not-existing elaboration cut. That to cer settled, that itself liberated...
[7686] Other to entering awareness not-arising by.
[7687] Scripture by established: From Gser-gyi-snying-po's tantra:
[7688] */ Cer-grol-chen-po's view-gaze by,
[7689] */ Buddhas beings two both liberated.
[7690] Thus.
[7691] Logical-reason: direction-free self-pure's logical-reason by established. Thus appearance cer-grol is—that itself cer-place settled, settled-place liberated, liberated-place yal because.
[7692] Liberation-manner: dharma-possessing part trained, part cer-place liberated. Wherever gone not, whence come not, wherever going-place not, wherever abiding change not. Dharma-possessing general trained, appearances all cer-grol gone.
[7693] Example: like blind-intellect temple gone, seeing-limit not.
[7694] Fourth mtha'-grol: relying upon reference apart basis-not-existing's essence. Reference what to also not-pointing essence—one's extreme from liberated is, two not-abiding, two from liberated one also not-abiding. Thus both, both not etc.
[7695] Extreme: existing's extreme appearance, not-existing's extreme not-appearance, both both not's extreme four cease—liberation called convention.
[7696] Mtha'-grol reference apart three: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner.
[7697] Mtha'-grol's understanding: existing, not-existing, appearing, empty's extreme—whatsoever reference not-pointing. Meaning by this is this not's reckoning beyond.
[7698] Mtha'-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7699] Reason: reference-free essence reason by established. Whatsoever not-referenced, extreme apart is—extreme whatsoever abiding not. Therefore extreme-free, center not-perceived view called.
[7700] Scripture by established...
[7701] From Rtsal-chen-yon-tan-rdzogs-pa's scripture:
[7702] */ Extreme apart, liberation called, thus.
[7703] Logical-reason: one knowing all liberated's logical-reason by established. One extreme apart knowing—thus appearance designation all from liberated is, reference whatsoever not-approaching because.
[7704] Liberation-manner: existing extreme not-abiding, not-existing extreme liberated. Not-existing extreme not-abiding, existing extreme liberated. Existing-not-existing both not-abiding, both liberated, both not by, both not liberated.
[7705] Fifth gcig-grol: relying upon peerless basis-not-existing's essence, means and wisdom dependent all shown.
[7706] One great-perfection thig-le single-alone, elaboration apart is—that's natural-condition liberated, many number's extreme all emptied.
[7707] Gcig-grol peerless basis four: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner, example.
[7708] Gcig-grol's gcod-ba: gcig-grol that not-established not—one one liberated, apart not-recognized whatsoever not. Therefore rig-pa to: ye-from liberated not-liberated convention beyond.
[7709] Gcig-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7710] Reason by established: liberation all different not—one other not-existing, liberation called. Single-one rig-pa itself—that also self-awareness single-alone, not-existing's dharma apart not.
[7711] Scripture by established: From Gser-gyi-snying-po:
[7712] */ Single liberation's dharmata is,
[7713] */ Many taste-one is because.
[7714] Thus.
[7715] Logical-reason by established: one knowing all-liberated by established. One awareness knowing—samsara-nirvana all liberated because.
[7716] Liberation-manner: dharmata as recognition, appearance-awareness all liberated.
[7717] Example: many taste-one knowing—salt one's taste, certainty reached if...
[7718] Salt all's taste certainty reached, or molasses and fire—one recognition, knowing all knowing—like.
[7719] From Byang-chub-sems-'grel:
[7720] */ Fire's nature heat,
[7721] */ Molasses nature sweet like.
[7722] */ Thus dharmas all also,
[7723] */ Nature empty single.
[7724] Thus like.
[7725] Thus liberation-manner five, person one calculate not—faculties' difference by, what aspiration, liberation is.
[7726] Third: liberation-manner five's conclusion five show. That also here: liberation-manner five those reference-basis apart. Rang-grol is: grasping view, meditation, conduct dharma's reference apart. Conditions conditions by liberated—example like dirt by dirt washed. Condition bad, condition bad by liberated, ye-she's companion appear. Ka-dag ka-dag by liberated, rig-pa rig-pa by liberated.
[7727] Ye-grol: grasping-grasped unity reference apart. Objects objects by liberated—poison by poisons destroyed like.
[7728] Cer-grol: samsara-nirvana two not-referenced, cause causes liberated—example iron by iron cut like.
[7729] Mtha'-grol: convention word not-referenced, dharma dharma liberated's example—wood from arisen fire, that wood that burned like.
[7730] Gcig-grol: liberating-doer thought not-referenced, mind-itself mind liberated's example—stone by stones cut like.
[7731] From Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
[7732] */ Conditions conditions by liberated because,
[7733] */ Grasping dharmas to not-reference.
[7734] */ Objects objects liberated to,
[7735] */ Grasping-grasped two not-reference.
[7736] */ Cause cause liberated to,
[7737] */ Samsara-nirvana two not-reference.
[7738] */ Dharma dharma liberated to,
[7739] */ Convention word not-reference.
[7740] */ Mind-itself mind liberated to,
[7741] */ Indicating-doer thought not-reference.
[7742] */ Dirt by dirt washed like,
[7743] */ Thus pure pure liberated.
[7744] */ Poison's poisons destroyed,
[7745] */ Iron's irons cut,
[7746] */ Stone's stones severed,
[7747] */ Wood's woods burned like.
[7748] */ Self-self enemy self does,
[7749] */ Lineage not-different liberation not.
[7750] Thus.
[7751] That-also: all rig-pa complete not-existing's essence by, rig-pa liberated time, dharmas all liberated—support-basis destroyed, support-dharma destroy like...
[7752] Rang-grol self-destroy, basis expanse equalized is.
[7753] That from:
[7754] */ Therefore basis-abiding rig-pa to,
[7755] */ Self-appeared because appearance perfected.
[7756] */ Self-occurred because basis perfected,
[7757] */ Self-appearance because objects also perfected.
[7758] */ Rang-grol because delusion-basis perfected,
[7759] */ Rang-pure because path all perfected.
[7760] */ Rang-awareness because knowables perfected,
[7761] */ Rang-pervading because result perfected.
[7762] */ Rang-place because cause-conditions perfected,
[7763] */ Rang-realized because dharmata perfected.
[7764] */ Rang-reversed because samsara-nirvana perfected,
[7765] */ Rang-abiding because tantra scripture perfected.
[7766] */ Rang-perfected because time-one perfected,
[7767] */ Rang-known because instruction perfected.
[7768] */ Rang-settled because meditation perfected,
[7769] */ Rang-feature because expanse perfected.
[7770] Thus.
[7771] Thus perfected liberated rig-pa, that itself beginning from ka-dag is, dirt not-existing, heart is, continuum exhausted. Single-alone great-bliss, speech-thought expression beyond. Ye-from thoroughly-pure zang-ka, stone-with pure empty. General-appearance samsara-nirvana's projection-feature not-stained. Dharmas exhausted, movement-dissolved, inert-awareness beyond. Natural basis's buddha abiding.
[7772] From Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
[7773] */ E-ma rang-rdzogs-chen-po's dharmakaya:
[7774] */ Ka-from pure, dirt exhausted,
[7775] */ First arisen, continuum exhausted.
[7776] */ Moon apart, reckoning beyond,
[7777] */ Suffering cause-less, great-bliss.
[7778] */ Expression's cause-less, speech-thought beyond,
[7779] */ Ye-from self-awareness thoroughly-pure.
[7780] */ Outflows exhausted, stone-with not,
[7781] */ Entity exhausted, empty abiding.
[7782] */ Two's increase-not, essence,
[7783] */ Dharma apart, means beyond.
[7784] */ Concept-not clear, movement-dissolved,
[7785] */ Inert-awareness non-dual, accumulations-two perfected.
[7786] */ Rival moon-not, cog-bzhag rang,
[7787] */ Altered word-not, all-pervading.
[7788] */ Think-doer mind-not, mindfulness apart,
[7789] */ Fresh itself, natural natural-condition.
[7790] */ Unaltered supreme, natural abiding.
[7791] Thus.
[7792] Thus outer-appearance, inner-body-mind all not-existing, clear-appearance water-moon like, realized rtsal-manifested...
[7793] Rig-pa sky-like meaning relying-upon: dharmas exhausted, appearance body water-moon like manifested. Walls, fence etc. touch not—eye, clairvoyance measureless attained. Aryas' truth seeing, again existence completely liberated.
[7794] Ka-dag ground liberated: elements-four's atom power-not, ye-she's fire burned. Mist dissolved like, sky's space body miracle shown. Meaning become: ye-she's fire burned atoms, those body-relic, self-relic blessing confer. Not-become: self-dissolved peace made, rig-pa dharmakaya's expanse abiding. Form-body activities with, samsara not-empty until, beings' benefit do.
[7795] From Zangs-yig-can and Rtags-tshad: appearance four measure not-reached also, stone-with not-visible, from-beginning's place liberated existing. Khregs-chod as liberation's manner clearly—rin-po-che-spungs-pa's tantra from spoken:
[7796] Not-released self-place settled's,
[7797] */ Mind this word all.
[7798] */ Who by trained not,
[7799] */ Individual intellect understood appear.
[7800] */ This itself self intellect understood,
[7801] */ Not-visible concept not-existing by.
[7802] */ Appearances all self-pure from,
[7803] */ All zang-ma thal-byung.
[7804] */ Empty-luminosity great's kind become.
[7805] */ Earth water fire wind elements four,
[7806] */ Individual power not-visible.
[7807] */ Mist like wise dissolve.
[7808] */ Delusion's attachment varieties—
[7809] */ How thought, birth-not.
[7810] */ Grasping-grasped aspects self-ceased,
[7811] */ What not-visible self-exhausted.
[7812] */ Clarity-doer self experience,
[7813] */ Bodied all thus gone.
[7814] */ Body-less mention what-needed?
[7815] Thus.
[7816] Yogin this's realization measure reached if: atom part-not, body stone-with self-place dissolve...
[7817] Slight not-reached also, other from transcended is—if corpse that pound-one etc., weight-only even to light etc., rig-pa ka-dag dissolved.
[7818] This's essence: rig-pa's essence zang-thal stone-with pure, habituating's portion from arisen. Mind that's delusion-appearance not-existing, clear-appearance portion also, time that self-face thoroughly-pure, mind ye-she distinguished. Mind pure, ye-she's truth seeing, thought bliss.
[7819] From Seng-ge-rtsal-rdzogs:
[7820] */ Buddha truth see, jina's son,
[7821] */ Concept heart understand, always bliss.
[7822] Thus extensively spoken, peak reached time.
[7823] [### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle]
[7824] From Theg-pa'i-mchog-rin-po-che'i-mdzod:
[7825] */ Also excellent realization liberation instruction's chapter shown, order nineteen.
[7826] Thus khregs-chod's meaning certainty placed. Now: thod-rgal's essence from stone-with light-body pure method extensively explained, two.
[7827] Khregs-chod from particularly transcended manner, particular thod-rgal itself explained.
[7828] First: particular seven by transcended:
[7829] */ Appearance light's particular,
[7830] */ Experience technique connected particular,
[7831] */ Self-appearance direct seeing particular,
[7832] */ Body essence nerve's particular,
[7833] */ Appearance-making gate's particular,
[7834] */ Seeing faculty's particular,
[7835] */ Experience increase-appearance's particular—seven.
[7836] First: khregs-chod by outer delusion-appearance's earth, stone, mountain etc., purify able-not. Object made illusion, basis-not etc., addition intellect dependent. Mind's consciousness gathered dharma dependent, quick liberation-not itself.
[7837] Thod-rgal: light-five, expanse-awareness appearance object made. Delusion-appearance name-not, intellect addition not-needed. Mind's dharma-eye consciousness etc., self-ceased training...
[7838] Samsara name-only repeat—life that, light liberated particular entered.
[7839] From Thal-'gyur:
[7840] */ This self-object shown from,
[7841] */ Circumstantial-conditions entering not.
[7842] */ Zang-ma and thal-byung,
[7843] */ Object awareness appearance aspect from,
[7844] */ Straight self basis from liberated.
[7845] Thus.
[7846] Well: khregs-chod manifested also, appearance measure not-reached, aggregates liberated shown—particular what? Very great: khregs-chod by manifested also, atom part-not from, light go not-possible. Light gone-not, vajra-body not-established. Occasional illusion-body, final not-decide. Light-body not-attained, transference great body not-attained—other benefit vast, support that not-accomplish because. Light atom dissolve portion from: transference great benefit not-do, clairvoyance and miracle accomplish, vast small particular existing.
[7847] Second: rig-pa ye-from luminosity spoken, that khregs-chod by empty measure, self-light not-see that. Thod-rgal by essence-held, dharmata essence luminosity inside captured time, dharma-possessing self-resound luminosity outside appearance technique shown existing—transcended.
[7848] From Rang-shar:
[7849] */ Self-appearance rig-pa's king this,
[7850] */ All existing, realization not.
[7851] Thus.
[7852] Third: rig-pa's ye-she khregs-chod see-not, cover addition, see not one decide that. Thod-rgal ye-she's sight open, dharmata's sun-rays clear.
[7853] From Thal-'gyur:
[7854] */ Dharmata direct appearance by,
[7855] */ Intellect grasping view suppressed.
[7856] Thus.
[7857] Fourth: khregs-chod coarse nerve-wind dependent, thod-rgal light-nerve clear recognized, lamp actual path made.
[7858] That from:
[7859] */ Also nerve delusion-mandala by,
[7860] */ Nature appearance ye-she five,
[7861] */ Bubble eye see.
[7862] Thus.
[7863] Fifth...
[7864] Khregs-chod: faculties six's gate not-pure, mind's dharma clear-seek from. Thod-rgal: pure luminosity's gate, ye-she's wind moved, lamp four's appearance arise—transcended.
[7865] That from:
[7866] */ Gate how arisen is,
[7867] */ Entering wind moved by.
[7868] */ Lamp four, actions four arisen.
[7869] Thus.
[7870] Sixth: khregs-chod see-not, rig-pa self-clear faculty clear-seek from. Thod-rgal: outer-inner ye-she zang-thal faculty, expanse and ye-she gather-separate not appearance, direct examine particular entered.
[7871] From Thal-'gyur:
[7872] */ Pure expanse lamp to,
[7873] */ Thig-le body delusion-appearance pure,
[7874] */ Nature itself, essence itself,
[7875] */ Non-dual gather-separate not appear.
[7876] Thus.
[7877] Seventh: khregs-chod outer-object, inner-mind's delusion-appearance appear made, abandon-accept not condition addition, quick those liberation-not itself. Thod-rgal: essence-held moment from, outer-inner delusion-appearance, delusion-grasper with self-dissolved. Not-abandoned place pure, addition not-dependent. Ye-she's increase-appearance, moon waxing upward increase. Appearance four measure reached, quick liberated itself.
[7878] That from:
[7879] */ Appear manner delusion not,
[7880] */ Cause-conditions pure nature to.
[7881] */ Entity entity-not self-pure from,
[7882] */ Gates-five's object-attachment pure.
[7883] */ Elements coarse pure,
[7884] */ Ye-she pure increase-appearance show.
[7885] */ That exhausted dharmata.
[7886] Thus.
[7887] These particular: subtle distinguish thought beyond also, outline only spoken. Briefly: rig-pa's meaning direct seeing, see existing, delusion moment reverse. Intellect dependent delusion-appearance, path made not-deluded result seek—particular great, wisdom-eye possessing realize.
[7888] Dharma this: essence such existing, all's peak supreme called.
[7889] Meaning second: particular thod-rgal itself shown, three...
[8165-8167] 
[7891] The wheel of dharmatā's three crucial points,
[7892] The wheel of day-night luminosity,
[7893] The vast wheel of face-expanse wisdom—
[7894] Thus the three wheels turn.
[8168-8173] 
[7896] Four divisions present the first:
[7897] Body's three settling points,
[7898] Gate's three seeing points,
[7899] Expanse's three guiding points,
[7900] Object's three appearance points.
[8174-8176] 
[7902] First: Body's posture, whichever three held,
[7903] Stomach relaxed, nerve-wind ease abiding—
[7904] This purpose exists.
[7905] If deliberately held, wind wrong, spread arise,
[7906] Nerve twist tight—the cause.
[8177-8184] 
[7908] Gaze held, wind essence very slow,
[7909] From outer held, nose drawn—
[7910] This particular dharma, great gathering.
[7911] Common method: nose out-inhale,
[7912] Wheel four's inside filled,
[7913] Mind clear-clear, meditation produced.
[7914] Wind wrong, spread, coil, dull—
[7915] Four obstacles arise,
[7916] Delusion-appearance not appearing.
[7917] Here: wind purified, increase path not made.
[7918] Wind gather obstacle mind unhappy, affliction thought movement, heart ache—all clear. Time those fierce throw, essence supreme.
[7919] That-also: wind essence this not-know, cultivate appearance increase, sign measure arise—definitely not-become.
[7920] Second: seeing gate essence three. Gaze three whichever doing, effort held not, stomach relaxed self-arrive made. Eye not-move, gaze held essence that.
[7921] From Thal-'gyur:
[7922] */ Distant-settled move not essence,
[7923] */ This time gaze three apply.
[7924] Thus.
[7925] Third: guiding expanse essence three. Eye slow corner up-down, expanse appearance limit, eye not-move, recognition movement-not, awareness clear-empty piece piece settle—essence.
[7926] That from:
[7927] */ Expanse essence guiding is.
[7928] Thus.
[7929] From Rtsal-rdzogs:
[7930] */ Dharmata mindfulness dissipated sky to,
[7931] */ Clouds-five appear, golden garuda soar.
[7932] */ Grasping-attachment concept-extreme apart, condition coo.
[7933] */ Self-appearance direction-fall-not sky to,
[7934] */ Empty-luminosity elaboration apart garuda soar.
[7935] */ Appearance grasping not, condition coo.
[7936] */ Sign elaboration apart sky to,
[7937] */ Grasping-grasped apart dharmakaya garuda soar.
[7938] */ Dharmata self-appearance thig-le, condition coo.
[7939] Thus.
[7940] Fourth: outer object sky cloud dissolve gaze, rig-pa clear-dissolved portion, appearance increase quick. Inner object expanse lamp gaze, luminosity mother-child connect. Secret object rig-pa self-clear gaze, ka-dag dharmas exhausted dgongs-pa, self-place clear essence existing.
[7941] From Rang-shar:
[7942] */ Sky empty mandala in,
[7943] */ Unaltered lamp forms four,
[7944] */ Not-ceased meaning clear.
[7945] */ Rig-pa expanse lamp is,
[7946] */ Sky empty expanse-center in.
[7947] */ Expanse nature light body,
[7948] */ Not-ceased cease-not clear.
[7949] */ Ye-she five heart body,
[7950] */ Knot manner arise.
[7951] */ That also: go and come,
[7952] */ Move and flicker.
[7953] */ Rig-pa expanse lamp to,
[7954] */ Placed rig-pa not-move if,
[7955] */ Changeless realization excellent explained.
[7956] */ Wisdom self-occurred lamp is,
[7957] */ Superimposition all cut.
[7958] */ Thig-le empty lamp is,
[7959] */ Effort not shine become if,
[7960] */ Distant-ropes water lamp by,
[7961] */ That gaze not-distracted if,
[7962] */ Complete meditation measure spoken.
[7963] Thus.
[7964] From Thal-'gyur:
[7965] */ This object essence such:
[7966] */ Cloud apart outer object empty to,
[7967] */ Yogin sky bird-path abides.
[7968] */ This not-apart dharmata.
[7969] Thus.
[7970] Also: object appearance characteristic. Sky blue-green limit-not, light color form and, ye-she five self-appearance show.
[7971] To pure expanse lamp:
[7972] */ Thig-le body delusion-appearance pure,
[7973] */ Nature itself, essence itself,
[7974] */ Non-dual gather-separate not appear.
[7975] Thus.
[7976] This's time: nerve inside wind movement, thought subtle sha-ra-ra arise also, direct meaning harm not. Thought that itself, self self-hold not-possible, liberated clear-clear go—bird fledgling held fly like. Yal object emanate also, previous knot one one continuous, spread distraction that like not. Karma habitual-patterns not-accumulate, luminosity meditation not-destroy, rig-pa's rtsal manifest make, wisdom thol-byung arise open.
[7977] That also: gaze held effort, thought great self-cease. Great small subtle all, rang-grol gone is.
[7978] From Thal-'gyur:
[7979] */ Dgongs-pa one from move not,
[7980] */ Appearance appearance's thog clear.
[7981] */ Face mirror like from,
[7982] */ Liberated that, that itself liberated.
[7983] */ Awareness movement empty-yal,
[7984] */ Seeing-awareness rig-pa different not.
[7985] */ That itself self's thog liberated,
[7986] */ One knowing all liberated because.
[7987] */ Two three's number extreme exhausted,
[7988] */ Concept grasping object not-appear.
[7989] */ Movement grasping ye-from empty,
[7990] */ Empty dgongs-pa clear perfected.
[7991] */ Many's number extreme exhausted.
[7992] Thus.
[7993] This's time: view-meditation conduct three, dgongs-pa expanse-one gather.
[7994] From Rdo-rje-sems-dpa' heart mirror:
[7995] */ Extreme-cut direction-fall not, view measure possess.
[7996] */ Clear concept not, meditation measure possess.
[7997] */ Self-occurred altered not, conduct measure possess.
[7998] */ Great-bliss outflows not, enlightenment entity-not this.
[7999] */ Grasp not-get, water-moon like.
[8000] */ Desire-all self-occurred, rich treasure like.
[8001] Thus.
[8002] That-also: expanse-awareness appearance not-arise, eye corner equal gaze...
[8003] In viewing, the essential point is to gaze unmoving at the midst of the sky's expanse, like unto a waterfall's cascade. And thus, from the letterless state:
[8004] */ Rig-pa resting in equipoise—this upadesa itself,
[8005] */ This the secret thig-le of enlightened intent.
[8006] */ The eyes held steadfast in absorption,
[8007] */ And thus examined apart from gathering and dispersal.
[8008] */ From the very corner of the eyes the expanse emerges,
[8009] */ Light subtle and swirling arises.
[8010] */ Its nature: lu-gu-rgyud itself,
[8011] */ Subtle, flickering, and mobile.
[8012] */ The eyes examined as the element of space,
[8013] */ The thig-le of the Buddha-body dawns.
[8014] */ Attaining the warmth of that very dgongs-pa,
[8015] */ Rig-pa's body—lu-gu-rgyud itself—
[8016] */ Together with the body, appearance dawns.
[8017] Thus.
[8018] Furthermore, at this juncture, establishing the three points of luminosity: the manner of mind's obscurations being purified in the dgongs-pa of essence; the manner of resting evenly unmoving in the state; and from that, the manner of signs, measures, and definitive time dawning. Of these three, the first has three aspects: the dgongs-pa of essence itself; the metaphor demonstrating mind and habitual patterns; and the essential summary of the manner of separation from these.
[8019] Of the first, from the Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind:
[8020] */ In the unmoving sky, rig-pa clear like unto it,
[8021] */ Clear yet unwavering—depth unfathomable.
[8022] */ Empty-luminosity, vast and open, in the great bliss expanse I wander,
[8023] */ Single-pointed clarity in the state of dharmata expanse.
[8024] */ Unmixed and perfected, established in spontaneous presence.
[8025] Thus.
[8026] The nature of rig-pa, wherein the four wisdoms self-manifest as one's own rtsal, demonstrates the natural state of superior seeing. The four wisdoms, from Rang shar:
[8027] Furthermore, regarding the nature of rig-pa:
[8028] */ The fourfold wisdom it possesses,
[8029] */ These four wisdoms are thus:
[8030] */ The liberating wisdom—
[8031] */ Liberates all completely.
[8032] */ Liberates into the pure field of kleshas,
[8033] */ Liberates into the state free from concept and birth,
[8034] */ Liberates into the expanse of rig-pa from non-recognition,
[8035] */ Liberates conceptual wisdom into the state.
[8036] */ Therefore, the liberating wisdom.
[8037] */ The activating wisdom—
[8038] */ Activates the five bodies into pure expanse,
[8039] */ Activates the five lights into non-grasping expanse,
[8040] */ Activates rig-pa ye-shes into expanse,
[8041] */ Activates the lamp into space-expanse.
[8042] */ Therefore, the activating wisdom.
[8043] */ The gathering wisdom—
[8044] */ Gathers elements into the five lights,
[8045] */ Gathers space into the lamp,
[8046] */ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
[8047] */ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
[8048] */ Therefore, the gathering wisdom—
[8049] */ Gathers elements into the five lights,
[8050] */ Gathers space into the lamp,
[8051] */ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
[8052] */ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
[8053] */ Therefore, the gathering wisdom.
[8054] */ The discriminating wisdom—
[8055] */ Discriminates non-recognition and rig-pa as two,
[8056] */ Discriminates kleshas and ye-shes as two,
[8057] */ Discriminates pure and impure as two,
[8058] */ Discriminates samsara and nirvana as two,
[8059] */ Discriminates realization and non-realization as two,
[8060] */ Discriminates good and bad as two.
[8061] */ Therefore, the discriminating wisdom.
[8062] Thus.
[8063] Furthermore, the second: through the purification at that very time of mind and habitual patterns—the objects to be purified by dgongs-pa...
[8375] The metaphor for this is:
[8376] From the mirror of Vajrasattva's heart:
[8377] "A ho! Listen, Vajra holder!
[8378] Unripened conceptual samsara
[8379] Is like a corpse on a gibbet with irons inserted—
[8380] Without liberation, the time of liberation does not arise.
[8381] With the irons of ignorance inserted, one cannot become liberated.
[8382] Ignorance is like water—it gathers afflictions.
[8383] The fire of aversion is like a mass of fire at the end of an eon.
[8384] Attachment to entities is like drinking salt water.
[8385] Delusion's thickening is like darkness in an empty house.
[8386] Pride and arrogance are like overthrowing a mountain.
[8387] Jealousy and ill-will are like blindness in a narrow valley.
[8388] These five afflictions obscure wisdom.
[8389] The mind is like a thieving bitch.
[8390] Consciousness is like a forest monkey.
[8391] Mind is like impure mud and swamp.
[8392] The alaya is like a pig being.
[8393] Knowing is like a bird's feather carried by the wind.
[8394] Apprehending and grasping are like man and woman.
[8395] The distinction of karma is like a bird tangled in snares.
[8396] The distinction of suffering is like a whirlpool in water.
[8397] There is no method to endure the fruit of afflictions.
[8398] This fixated peg of apprehending and grasping, the suffering of samsara—
[8399] Through action one cannot exit; through release one becomes liberated.
[8400] Abandoning all done dharmas, easy accomplishment.
[8401] Abandoning all thought, supreme wisdom unmoving.
[8402] By the king of secret mantra, afflictions become wisdom.
[8403] Like raising a lamp in an empty house,
[8404] By the lamp of wisdom, ignorance becomes awareness.
[8405] Thus it is said.
[8406] Third, the summary of the way of separation from that has three parts:
[8407] The actual way of separation in one's own time through direct perception,
[8408] Establishing the proof of separation,
[8409] Speaking of other enumerations.
[8410] The first is:
[8411] By looking at the clear light of outer appearances,
[8412] Without delusion, when the meditation of inner self-tone is clear in its own place,
[8413] Mind and wisdom split instantly—the alaya with its eight collections is obscured by wisdom,
[8414] Samsara dharmas are not clear.
[8415] Spontaneously accomplished as one's own passed nature is—
[8416] From Samantabhadra's mind mirror:
[8417] Awareness separated from mind is actual buddhahood,
[8418] Wisdom separated from intellect is actual intent,
[8419] Light rays separated from interior are actual pure appearance.
[8420] Thus it is said, and
[8421] From Self-Arising:
[8422] Awareness separated from mind is actual buddhahood,
[8423] I, Vajrasattva, separated from intellect,
[8424] Know without concept in clarifying appearance,
[8425] Concept-free discriminating awareness equality is
[8426] Great self-liberation through itself.
[8427] Thus it is said.
[8428] Second, the proof is:
[8429] By placing unmoved in the nature of appearance, samsara dharmas go to self-awakening—like sediment self-awakening through unmoved water.
[8430] Showing intent difficult to measure in depth through the metaphor of a jewel in clear water—
[8431] From the previous:
[8432] This drop of self-arising nectar,
[8433] Like a jewel in clear water,
[8434] When possessing sediment is placed, the sediment clears.
[8435] Thus this heart pith instruction,
[8436] When applied, afflictions do not become stains.
[8437] Thus and:
[8438] Single and alone, easily appearing as companion,
[8439] In the unborn expanse, clear light wisdom,
[8440] Exists in all, yet seen by none.
[8441] Like the sky's expanse, immeasurable by measure,
[8442] Like the sun's light, clear and shining,
[8443] Like Mount Meru, king of mountains, unchanging,
[8444] Like the ocean's depth, deep and difficult to measure,
[8445] Like the lotus of mud, without stain,
[8446] Like the moon in water, without face-grasping,
[8447] Like the sky's miracle, appearing as whatever,
[8448] Like the rainbow, clear and complete.
[8449] Thus it is said.
[8450] Third, speaking of other enumerations is:
[8451] All intent such as expanse and awareness dissolving into the single expanse of root awareness, cutting and deciding—
[8452] Again from that same source:
[8453] Deliver all meaning into the expanse without arising,
[8454] Make recognize the lamp of the enlightenment path,
[8455] Gather all dharmas into the nature separated from speech,
[8456] Deliver all tantras into the great tantra without letters, the great tantra of one's own awareness.
[8457] Deliver all scriptures into the great root scripture without showing.
[8458] Deliver all oral instructions separated from the basis of speech.
[8459] Deliver all accomplishments separated from actor and acted.
[8460] Deliver all conduct into the great supreme unfabricated.
[8461] Deliver all meditations into the great clear without grasping.
[8462] Deliver all views wide open, not attached to anything.
[8463] Deliver all fruits into the great wisdom of single cut.
[8464] Gather all those into a single expanse of non-abiding.
[8465] Release all actions of samsara.
[8466] Constantly familiarize with the appearance of wisdom.
[8467] Recognize the time when wisdom arises.
[8468] Know all basis dharmas as essence, nature, and compassion—three.
[8469] Know all path dharmas as five kayas and five wisdoms.
[8470] Know all fruit dharmas as three kayas without returning.
[8471] Know all essence dharmas as empty.
[8472] Know all nature dharmas as clear.
[8473] Know all compassion dharmas as pervading all beings.
[8474] Know all wisdom dharmas as unmixed.
[8475] Know all light dharmas as without grasping.
[8476] Know all ray dharmas as without emanating or gathering.
[8477] Know all awareness dharmas as separated from self-concept.
[8478] Thus deliver all dharmas without conceptualizing or thinking anything.
[8479] Second, regarding the way of placing unmoved and equal in the nature, from two:
[8480] The brief presentation of placing in the nature of essence is:
[8481] From Thal 'gyur:
[8482] The characteristic of meditation, the way of appearing:
[8483] The characteristic of empty-clear awareness,
[8484] Nature unmixed wherever,
[8485] Apprehending and grasping extremes exhausted,
[8486] Dharmata's own face pure.
[8487] Thus it is said.
[8488] The extensive explanation of placing in the appearance of nature is:
[8489] From Six Expanses:
[8490] Direct the nose toward the three passed kayas.
