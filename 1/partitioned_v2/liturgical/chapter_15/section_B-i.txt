[5398] Similar to the increase and decrease of the four—birth, aging, sickness, and death—
[5399] The outer container's arising manner dissolves, and
[5400] The inner contents' beings' life measure rising and
[5401] Waning downward—the sign of exhaustion.
[5402] If these do not exhaust, the self is not free from the three realms.
[5403] Thus, through the exhaustion of the outer container world,
[5404] Support-ground not existing,
[5405] The vital point of no ground of return.
[5406] Through the exhaustion of inner contents' beings, the birth continuum cut,
[5407] Now awareness itself is separate from death.
[5408] Then, whatever essence vision may have, there is no establishment,
[5409] Difficult to express as "this is" or "this is not,"
[5410] Therefore called "dharmata exhaustion"—the meaningful result.
[5411] The result: difficult for a person to express "this is" or "this is not," for it is inconceivable.
[5412] Moreover, dharma exhaustion: at the time of measure-arrival, the dharmas of outer objects, inner body, together with dust, exhausted—here, the dharmas included by the all-ground consciousness mind exhausted,
[5413] And purifying the root non-awareness that abides as the dharmata of the three doors of the all-ground part.
[5414] Depending upon the dharmas of delusion,
[5415] That luminosity of vision without arising or destruction, abiding as ultimate dharmata,
[5416] Through the exhaustion of those two dharmatas, is called "dharmata exhaustion."
[5417] Vision: when that previous spontaneously accomplished vision, existing, dissolves inward, part by part going,
[5418] The primordially pure vision, like a cloudless sky, momentarily abiding naturally pure, is called "vision"—
[5419] Not like vision as entity and characteristic.
[5420] At this time, there is no reference even to mere dharmas—dharmata exhaustion.
[5421] The dharma-possessor object and
[5422] The dharmata's emptiness, the holding part, included by the object-possessor,
[5423] The time of return of the three realms' mind, mental-events, together with all-ground.
[5424] The manner of exhaustion:
[5425] Gradual and
[5426] Instantaneous, from the two.
[5427] Gradual exhaustion is at the time of the four visions arriving at measure.
[5428] Instantaneous exhaustion is through habituating having seen dharmata manifestly at first.
[5429] There is also exhaustion without the arising of visions of increasing experience and so forth—
[5430] This is called "supreme instantaneous mind."
[5431] Moreover, merely through each act of respect for the guru, greater than others, possessed of the potential of previously purified action—such an exhaustion manner merely exists.
[5432] Second, the extensive explanation of nature has five parts:
[5433] Essence,
[5434] Definition,
[5435] Nature,
[5436] Dharmata,
[5437] Boundary.
[5438] The essence of dharmata exhaustion:
[5439] Outer lights-five vision, together with bodies, exhausted;
[5440] Inner dust, together with concepts and aggregates, exhausted;
[5441] Experience vision objects exhausted,
[5442] Awareness abiding in a manner like the sky, the primordially pure vision.
[5443] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5444] The vision of dharmata exhaustion—
[5445] Experience vision emptying,
[5446] Body exhausted, sense objects also exhausted,
[5447] Free from concepts, aggregates, and delusion,
[5448] Separate from words of expressive basis.
[5450] Definition:
[5451] "Dharma" means the dharmas of body, speech, and mind aggregates, together with afflictions.
[5452] "Itself" is together with the part of meditating the luminosity vision of the purifying path.
[5453] "Exhaust" is "empty,"
[5454] Mind's meditation, together with object-vision, self-reversing, not existing—
[5455] Called "non-observation."
[5456] From that itself:
[5457] Thus the certain definition of dharmata—
[5458] To the gathering of dharma-knowing aggregates,
[5459] Doing actions and holding characteristics,
[5460] Making self-vision empty,
[5461] Holding individual families.
[5462] "Itself" is to the unfabricated,
[5463] Pervading the real through natural abiding,
[5464] To the unfabricated, original, continuous,
[5465] Exhausting the numbers of sounds, words, and names.
[5467] Nature:
[5468] Outer and inner vision-mind exhausted, activity merely upon primordially pure self-resonance like the resonance of blue-grey sky.
[5469] From the Rtsal rdzogs:
[5470] At this time, the characteristic of exhaustion—
[5471] Like the sky, free from action.
[5473] Dharmata has two parts:
[5474] The dharmata of vision:
[5475] Through the exhaustion of outer and inner dust, channels and winds exhaust.
[5476] Through that exhaustion, the subtle defilements, the seed-parts of latencies depending upon mind, with the characteristic of arising from all, also exhaust.
[5477] Abiding in the samadhi of continuity, not passing beyond the wheel of dharmata,
[5478] Controlling the great eye and clairvoyance, obtaining the power as regent of the dharma king of the three realms.
[5479] The all-ground subtle knowable obscurations very cut—except for being cut by merely a white silk curtain, there are no obscurations.
[5480] This is called "the result of path dharmas exhaustion."
[5481] Having cleared that, separation from all Buddha-obscurations, entering the primordially pure dharmakaya of the inner expanse, the very peace.
[5482] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5483] The dharmata of self-Buddha cessation:
[5484] Elements ceasing, dust ceases,
[5485] Dust and particles ultimately cease,
[5486] Not even a mere part abides.
[5487] Afflictions ceasing, delusion and
[5488] Concept-free attachment not abiding,
[5489] Latencies and all-arising
[5490] Not even dust-parts abide.
[5491] Thus through subtle and coarse cessation,
[5492] The five aggregates also gradually subtle at the end,
[5493] The body of four elements exhausted,
[5494] All is wisdom, Sambhogakaya.
[5495] Concept-free samadhi self-abiding,
[5496] Having exceeded the aggregates of fabrication,
[5497] "Dharma" does not abide in words.
[5499] The empty dharmata:
[5500] Through the exhaustion of coarse channels and winds, mind and mental-events exhaust.
[5501] The vision aspect of body and wisdom, like the measure-arrived full moon, also setting into the inner expanse, abiding in primordially pure vision,
[5502] This is expressed as "the dharmakaya vision, the core result dharmata, self-vision."
[5503] Again from the previous:
[5504] The dharmata of cause and result:
[5505] Coarse conceptuality source ceasing,
[5506] Memory self-pure from the continuum also,
[5507] Dependent-arising wind itself fully pure,
[5508] The dharmata arising from cause.
[5509] To the primordially pure nature,
[5510] The numbers of one and many exhaust,
[5511] Body and wisdom non-existent,
[5512] Arriving at the ground of exhausted dharmas—
[5513] Considered to be the result dharmata.
[5515] Moreover, delusion regarding these three later words.
[5516] Nyingtigpas who think that in the result primordially pure there is no body and wisdom having arisen—
[5517] That is a great error.
[5518] They have not understood the intention of that being said regarding the part like the resonance body and wisdom of outer vision, crystal light returning inward.
[5519] If in meaning there is nothing in the inner expanse, it contradicts spontaneous accomplishment;
[5520] Being unconditioned, it contradicts going to complete non-existence in the future;
[5521] It contradicts the arising of benefit for beings from the basis of dawn of body and wisdom from the expanse;
[5522] It contradicts Samantabhadra, having arrived at the end of pure basis expanse, showing the compassion and action of showing the path to beings and Buddhas—such faults exist in great number.
[5523] Such faults are not suitable to accept.
[5524] Fifth, the boundary:
[5525] At the time of beginning exhaustion from the measure-arrived curtain, there merely exists the clarity of five lights in the fingers of one's own four hands and feet,
[5526] The occasion from which there is outward entry into the inner expanse and
[5527] The boundary of inward return to outer vision.
[5528] Moreover, although that body form does not actually arise extensively as benefit for beings at this time,
[5529] Focusing awareness upon the light of the fingers,
[5530] Outer visions and
[5531] The luminosity of one's own body increasingly dissolve and go into the inner expanse,
[5532] From merely the pure blue of direct objective vision,
[5533] Like light-body fading and crystal light dissolving inward,
[5534] The self-resonance of body and vision also reverses,
[5535] Awareness abiding merely upon the depth resonance of body and wisdom within the shell of inner clear spontaneously accomplished jewel,
[5536] Like a shadow abiding in the self-lucidity of a crystal mirror, without even a mere part of vision in the blue of outer vision,
[5537] Awareness buddha-fied into dharmakaya, coiled.
[5538] If returning inward to outer vision, the sign that that body does not accomplish the equal of Buddha action,
[5539] Moreover, through control of birth and entry, awareness focusing compassion upon beings, that primordially pure vision without anything, self-reversing.
[5540] This vision of delusion-vision appears like a mirror's reflection,
[5541] And that self-body also, like the moon in water, self-appears as wisdom illusory body through copper-shining, free from elemental harm, obtaining the vajra body—
[5542] Called "arising as the great transfer body for the benefit of beings."
[5543] Others' impure eyes see merely dust together, not the copper-shining—
[5544] Like the great master Vimala and
[5545] Padma.
[5546] Then, having obtained control over birth and entry,
[5547] Although buddha-fied in a moment, there is delay,
[5548] Yet doing the benefit of beings until samsara is not empty, possessing self-power.
[5549] Control over birth:
[5550] At the occasion of entering the inner expanse, entering awareness into three thousand beings, obtaining the great power to free all simultaneously,
[5551] Even insects cease into light.
[5552] Having obtained control over birth, emanating whatever is desired, spontaneously accomplishing the benefit of beings.
[5553] Control over entry:
[5554] Although entering awareness into inert things, making them move and emit sound,
[5555] Through the dharma sound arising from lotus, wishing tree, jewel, and so forth, ripening all beings,
[5556] Making rain of food and clothes.
[5557] Moreover, having obtained these two controls over birth and entry following exhaustion at the occasion not-there of entering the inner expanse,
[5558] If not returning inward for beings' benefit, having made three thousand beings in the bardo free instantaneously, entering the expanse;
[5559] If doing, through control over birth, returning inward, gradually making three thousand free,
[5560] Doing whatever benefit for beings through many births and entries for kalpas numbering the dust of fields.
[5561] Through earth treasures,
[5562] Jewels,
[5563] Dharma classifications, and so forth—although benefit may be accomplished after a long time, there is not even a moment's passing in that means,
[5564] For compassion wonder arises from others and activity vision enters.
[5565] Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara, such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt in this life or the bardo.
[5566] This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra:
[5567] When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion,
[5568] Fingers and so forth appear thus.
[5569] Focusing this, elements naturally cease.
[5570] Through the difference of birth and entry,
[5571] Upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted,
[5572] Without holding anything whatsoever,
[5573] One abides—this is the emanation body.
[5574] Through this, the power of entry's force,
[5575] Who has obtained self-power over birth,
[5576] Also focusing upon that,
[5577] Again at times doing thus,
[5578] The self-sound of vision rustling,
[5579] Manifestly reverses, appearing as delusion.
[5580] Through this, doing all benefit for beings,
[5581] For awareness is equal and one,
[5582] The great transfer of three thousand
[5583] Beings is accomplished by this.
[5584] Thus through gradual and instantaneous,
[5585] The body is accomplished by this.
[5586] All that is free from body-exhaustion measure.
[5587] All this, certain result,
[5588] Accomplishes the great mandala, supreme ground.
[5590] Thus the dawning of the four visions is called "the sequence of path-arising"—
[5591] Like the rungs of a ladder.
[5592] That also: from the part of abiding in the path, the dawn-agent does not cease;
[5593] From the part of obtaining the path, nothing whatsoever is unestablished.
[5594] Thus, through the four visions arriving at measure, buddha-fying without contaminated vision in this itself,
[5595] Especially sublime from the common vehicles,
[5596] Having met this dharma, one should make effort to practice with diligence.
[5597] Upon that itself:
[5598] For a person desiring to accomplish Buddhahood,
[5599] If possessing this means, it is thus.
[5600] For other conduct is pride itself,
[5601] Not seeing entity.
[5602] Therefore this is all rare words—
[5603] Always look to this jewel treasure.
[5605] Fourth meaning: the four instructions of extreme reliance are the back-support or closely-arisen support of the above.
[5606] That also: establishing basis through three unmoving in speech,
[5607] Holding measure through three vows,
[5608] Striking nails through three obtains,
[5609] Showing measure of freedom through four confidences.
[5610] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5611] Upon that, one should have faith in extreme reliance.
[5612] Through establishing basis in three unmoving,
[5613] Wind-mind arrives at the vital point.
[5614] Through holding measure with three abidings,
[5615] Reversing dreams and body, speech, and mind,
[5616] Certain holding of signs and measure.
[5617] Through striking nails with three obtains,
[5618] Contaminated aggregates not visible.
[5620] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5621] Measure is the yoga of four confidences.
[5623] First, sealing the basis of nirvana through establishing basis with three unmoving:
[5624] Pressing the vital with three body-unmoving,
[5625] Clearing the path with three speech-unmoving,
[5626] Coiling wrapped in the gorge with three mind-unmoving.
[5627] First, to the three body-unmoving:
[5628] Bringing vital channels through pervading posture-unmoving,
[5629] Straightening the path through dawn-agent gaze-unmoving,
[5630] Blocking wind's going and coming through bind-draw unmoving.
[5631] First:
[5632] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5633] The body's vitals are these three:
[5634] The lion manner and elephant manner,
[5635] Know like a rishi.
[5637] Regarding the emanation body posture:
[5638] Sound explanation and
[5639] Meaning division, from the two.
[5640] First:
[5641] Body straight makes channels straight,
[5642] Stretching made unmoving, wind arises continuously,
[5643] Through that, various conceptualities cease.
[5644] The "like" is by example: like the manner of meditating samadhi of rishis Agastya and Vashistha at Meru's side.
[5645] Regarding meaning division, from the two:
[5646] First, the vital of setting continuity:
[5647] Pressing the two foot-heels draws the essence of method and wisdom,
[5648] Pressing the foot-soles to the earth empties the action of emitting and gathering wind, and makes wisdom-heat descend into the body.
[5649] Sitting with the body generally hunched closes the channel-mouth of consciousness entry.
[5650] Stretching the body parts makes the body consciousness naturally slow.
[5651] Joining knee and chest draws ability of wisdom from the body's elements.
[5652] Crossing the hands at armpit or atop the knee ends the limits of action and latency.
[5653] Second, the vital of resting wisdom:
[5654] If conceptuality emits and bliss does not arise, do thus:
[5655] Joining knee and chest, sitting hunched,
[5656] There is need to reverse the emitting action-wind.
[5657] Through that reversal, outer various bodies appear,
[5658] Mind abides inward.
[5659] Pressing the foot-soles to the earth reverses life-effort action-wind.
[5660] Through that reversal, heat arises in the outer body,
[5661] Experience of unborn dharmata arises inward.
[5662] Embracing and stretching the nape with the hands
[5663] Reverses navel action-wind.
[5664] Through that reversal, many conceptualities cease inward,
[5665] Increasing fully pure wisdom vision outward.
[5666] Such vitals are:
[5667] Body vital is ability,
[5668] Channel vital is to wind,
[5669] Wind vital is to mind.
[5670] Regarding Sambhogakaya posture also:
[5671] Sound explanation:
[5672] "Great elephant" expresses from the part of power and great vehicle, for that body vital lifts special wisdom.
[5673] Dividing meaning, from the two:
[5674] The vital of setting continuity:
[5675] Sleeping face-covered makes power to overcome the three existences.
[5676] Joining knee and chest makes basis for delusion to dawn as wisdom.
[5677] Extending the big toe outward to earth harms moving action-wind.
[5678] Pressing hand fingers to earth
[5679] Supports dharmata manifestly dawning.
[5680] Raising the nape a little makes conceptuality dawn as wisdom.
[5681] Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5682] Face-covering overcomes the existence of attachment-holding of three doors.
[5683] Placing four hands and feet to earth,
[5684] Pushing outward with the placed foot big-toe reverses conceptuality action-wind.
[5685] Through that reversal, outer delusion vision ceases,
[5686] Heat arises in body and mind inward.
[5687] Pressing both hand-palms to earth reverses moving action-wind.
[5688] Through that reversal, outer bindus and small bindus dawn,
[5689] Experience without day and night arises inward.
[5690] Bending the nape a little reverses grasping action-wind.
[5691] Through that reversal, seeing outer body-vision,
[5692] Exhausts wind's movement inward.
[5693] Regarding Dharmakaya posture also:
[5694] Sound explanation:
[5695] Like one with complete lion's three abilities not fearing anything,
[5696] That body vital clears the fears of the three realms.
[5697] Regarding dividing the manner of meaning:
[5698] The vital of establishing continuity:
[5699] Sitting in dog-curl makes expanse and awareness meet.
[5700] Pressing foot-soles to earth ceases various conceptualities.
[5701] Bending all hand-finger joints and placing inside the two feet empties the movement of action and affliction.
[5702] Resting the upper body in a gap makes always not separate from dharmata.
[5703] Carrying channels to the nape makes support without place to stick from dharmata's meaning.
[5704] Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5705] Placing both foot-soles to earth, pushing the knee a little outward, sitting in dog-curl
[5706] Reverses pervading action-wind.
[5707] Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5708] The continuum of affliction ceases cut inward.
[5709] Placing both hand-palms inward ceases grasping action-wind.
[5710] Through that ceasing, seeing outer wisdom vision,
[5711] The continuum of object-possessor grasping conceptuality ceases inward.
[5712] Resting the upper body in a gap and stretching the nape
[5713] Reverses emitting action-wind.
[5714] Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5715] The continuum of affliction ceases inward.
[5716] Moreover, pressing the Dharmakaya posture completes Buddha-wisdom in this itself.
[5717] Through pressing Sambhogakaya, in this itself one sees the three realms of Buddha-fields.
[5718] Through pressing Nirmanakaya, in this itself there is need to accomplish unobstructed benefit for beings.
[5719] Second, the three unmoving of dawn-agent gaze manner:
[5720] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5721] "The door is that itself unmoving."
[5723] Looking as Nirmanakaya gaze manner, enjoying the vision of awareness-compassion.
[5724] That also: relying on relaxed eye, impossible to separate from samadhi.
[5725] Placing mind a little downward holds the view separate from emptiness-thought.
[5726] Looking equally, impossible to come under affliction's power.
[5727] Looking as Sambhogakaya gaze manner, manifestly seeing the vision of awareness-nature.
[5728] Without moving body, looking equally with both eyes to the right,
[5729] All delusion ceases in one time.
[5730] Looking from the corner, impossible to separate from dharmata.
[5731] Looking to the left strikes the nail of expanse and awareness.
[5732] Pressing that itself a little to the corner ceases the nadi's going and coming.
[5733] Looking as Dharmakaya gaze manner, seeing the essence of awareness.
[5734] Reversing both eyes equally upward a little cuts the continuum of birth-places of the three lower realms.
[5735] Pressing between the eyebrows—no place for awareness to wander.
[5736] Focusing upon the sky space—no place to separate from expanse-awareness.
[5737] Eye relaxation is the same for all.
[5738] Third, the three unmoving of bind-draw:
[5739] Binding body limbs ceases the continuum of the delusion-wheel of six realms.
[5740] Bending all finger joints destroys body action.
[5741] Pressing the nape channel on occasion makes basis for light vision to dawn in self-manner.
[5742] Leaving body bind at fingers makes the three realms nameless.
[5743] Second, the three unmoving of speech:
[5744] Not mixing speech with anyone empties common action of six realms.
[5745] Cutting the return-mixing of words, words dawn as self-arisen wisdom.
[5746] Blocking even merely one's own expression, certain abiding in the manner of all dharmas inexpressible.
[5747] Third, the three unmoving of mind:
[5748] Not separating from the inert of focus, always abiding in Buddha's intention.
[5749] Having entered awareness into the expanse-manner, no place to wander from entity-manner.
[5750] Not separating always from that itself, certain arrival of four visions at measure.
[5751] That also is called "reversing from moving, moving, moving"—
[5752] The vital that frees from those.
[5753] Second, holding measure with three abidings has three parts:
[5754] Through three body abidings, separation from action;
[5755] Through three wind abidings, holding measure of non-arising;
[5756] Through three vision abidings, faith of non-returning.
[5757] First three:
[5758] Abiding not abiding in body action, impossible to increase samsara's delusion.
[5759] Abiding limb emitting and gathering, delusion-wheel continuum ceases.
[5760] Placing action at the basis, certain separation from accumulated action-ripening.
[5761] Second three:
[5762] Abiding wind not going outward, no harm from different condition-vision.
[5763] Abiding eye opening inward, no support for different conceptuality.
[5764] Abiding without outer-inner going and coming, empty basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two.
[5765] Third, three vision abidings:
[5766] Abiding without movement in light, recognition of not returning to three realms.
[5767] Abiding without movement in awareness, exhaustion of action and ripening end.
[5768] Abiding without shaking in body, body's contaminations naturally exhaust.
[5769] At this time, body four signs arriving at measure:
[5770] Arises through obtaining certainty at the basis of four powers.
[5771] Speech four measures arriving:
[5772] Arises through obtaining certainty on the path of four powers.
[5773] Mind four measures arriving:
[5774] Arises through the four powers' result becoming manifest.
[5775] That also: at the time of dharmata manifesting, the body like a tortoise put into a shell bowl,
[5776] Arises through the body's channels abiding relaxed.
[5777] That is the great perfection's meaning, free from action-effort, entering the body limbs.
[5778] Through the pure action of vase-empowerment,
[5779] Elaboration-together wisdom certainly arises self-arisen.
[5780] At the time of upper increase, the body going like a person tormented by sickness, arises through wind entering the central channel,
[5781] The great perfection's meaning without negation-establishment entering the general.
[5782] Through the pure action of secret empowerment,
[5783] Elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5784] At measure-arrival, the body like an elephant sinking in mud,
[5785] Arises through mind hitting channels and winds.
[5786] The great perfection's meaning without accepting-rejecting entering the heart.
[5787] Arising through body action purified by wisdom-yeshe empowerment,
[5788] Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5789] At exhaustion, the body going like dew on a dakini's ear,
[5790] Arises through mind entering the luminosity-net.
[5791] The great perfection's self-free equal meaning entering the body-eye, through word-empowerment body action purified,
[5792] Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5793] Those are shown nearby by examples—
[5794] The signs of body's delusions naturally ceasing in meaning.
[5795] The sign-measure letters are intended for the general manner of meaning;
[5796] Vimal said these are placed very upon meaning.
[5797] Speech basis also like the four visions and sequence:
[5798] Speech going like a mute manner, arises through consciousness entering inner channels.
[5799] This is the great perfection's expressive basis, self-pure, entering speech-symbols,
[5800] Cutting elaboration outward, clear in the manner of inner wisdom.
[5801] Speech going like a crazy person's self-words bursting forth:
