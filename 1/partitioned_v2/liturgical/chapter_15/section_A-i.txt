[4523] /dharma-body posture/
[4524] /example lion den enter like/
[4525] foot bottom two earth place element equal heat pith/
[4374] The manner of Dharmakaya's abiding—
[4375] Who knows this body's key point,
[4376] Compatible with that, the yogin
[4377] Becomes pure in great bliss of Dharmakaya.
[4378] Thus it was spoken.
[4379] By performing the three bodies' postures,
[4380] One does not transgress the intent of the three bodies.
[4381] The hunched nirmanakaya—sign of future liberation through asceticism;
[4382] The elephant sambhogakaya—sign of future spontaneous liberation through non-action;
[4383] The lion dharmakaya—sign of future genuine fearless liberation.
[4384] Why does the elemental body's gaze
[4385] Transform into the three bodies' gaze?
[4386] The three bodies, luminous and clear, dwell in the heart's innate presence.
[4387] By making the gaze thus,
[4388] One manifests the three intents abiding within.
[4389] Since the three bodies exist as one's own constituents,
[4390] One's own gaze goes into the three bodies' gaze.
[4391] When cold elemental body harmonizes with nirmanakaya—balanced warmth;
[4392] When hot—with dharmakaya;
[4393] When balanced—with sambhogakaya—auspicious.
[4394] Particularly, vision increases swiftly.
[4395] If posture is not bent, awareness's self-resonance in body's channels
[4396] Does not arise; without raising it, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky.
[4397] Therefore gaze is precious.
[4398] Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness.
[4399] When dawn comes, ordinary abiding cannot increase;
[4400] Moreover, it decreases again. Therefore gaze is precious.
[4401] As snake's limbs, though in body, are not manifest—
[4402] Bend them and they appear—
[4403] So awareness dawns from gaze's key point.
[4404] Are postures limited to three only?
[4405] If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?
[4406] All sentient beings, led by three afflictions into three realms—
[4407] From that, liberation.
[4408] Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—
[4409] Therefore determined as three.
[4410] From the wheel of samsaric karma:
[4411] Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges;
[4412] Action and doer, speech chief, becoming;
[4413] When ripening into body, delight in speech,
[4414] Object chief, desire great,
[4415] Delight in desire comes.
[4416] To take that into the pure path,
[4417] Sambhogakaya posture is shown.
[4418] Such beings, always performing supreme sambhogakaya posture,
[4419] Become supreme experts in dharmata's meaning.
[4420] From samsara's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—
[4421] Pig emerges;
[4422] That same producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.
[4423] When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great,
[4424] Not delighting in speech,
[4425] Always delighting in sleep comes.
[4426] Always abiding in dharmakaya posture,
[4427] Determined to abide in dharmata for three times.
[4428] First, aversion impure ripening into form—
[4429] Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;
[4430] This, delighting in body action, desire to move,
[4431] Body strength great, body coarse,
[4432] Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.
[4433] Always abiding in nirmanakaya posture, determined to become buddha.
[4434] Therefore posture is determined as three.
[4435] Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,
[4436] Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.
[4437] More than that not needed;
[4438] Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.
[4439] At this time, speech main-point: cutting speech.
[4440] From Thalgyur:
[4441] Speech—training, abiding, swallowing—
[4442] Must be made firm.
[4443] Thus it was said.
[4444] First, speech training:
[4445] Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech;
[4446] Then train long;
[4447] Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone.
[4448] Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying;
[4449] Not mixing even one syllable with others.
[4450] At this time, body's sign makes meaning understood.
[4451] Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance;
[4452] Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—
[4453] Not even body sign.
[4454] From Seed Tantra:
[4455] Speech like a mute,
[4456] Not making sign with anyone,
[4457] Thus, whoever does this—
[4458] Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut.
[4459] Thus it was said.
[4460] Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind.
[4461] Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists.
[4462] By body purified, buddhas and bodhisattvas and sky-goer dakinis
[4463] Bless, liberating body into illusory body.
[4464] Then, object blocked, speech purified—
[4465] Sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes.
[4466] Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—
[4467] That sign: first seeing non-human form,
[4468] Then clairvoyance arises.
[4469] Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection.
[4470] Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.
[4471] From Thalgyur:
[4472] Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished.
[4473] Thus it was said.
[4474] Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—
[4475] Dhatu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut.
[4476] From Seed Tantra.
[4477] Thus binding body, speech, and three—
[4478] In dharmadhatu's vision,
[4479] This becomes habituation.
[4480] Thus it was said, and:
[4481] Body and speech and mind's main-point—
[4482] Know and rely, liberate from samsara.
[4483] Thus it was said.
[4484] Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are:
[4485] Bind three main-points in vajra seal;
[4486] Introduce awareness's own face directly;
[4487] Show vision's dawning manner from that.
[4488] First, two are:
[4489] Show general seal of three main-points,
[4490] Deliver particular self's main-point to point.
[4491] First: three main-points—gate, field, and wind-awareness.
[4492] From Thalgyur:
[4493] Three main-points—do not separate from instruction;
[4494] That also: gate and field itself,
[4495] Wind and awareness main-point itself seal.
[4496] Thus said.
[4497] Example: like weapon hitting vital point—
[4498] Channels or heart-meaning etcetera main-point hit,
[4499] Whatever done, not feeling, dying similar.
[4500] Three main-points also: dharmata no ground for change.
[4501] Gate main-point: cause to see;
[4502] Field main-point: cause not to change;
[4503] Wind-awareness main-point: deliver to sign-measure.
[4504] That also: gate main-point like threshold;
[4505] Field main-point like escort;
[4506] Wind-awareness main-point like bandit.
[4507] Arrow hit, person cannot change power, captured;
[4508] Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand—
[4509] Impossible not to hit dharmata direct main-point.
[4510] That also: field not existing, no basis ground;
[4511] Gate not existing, beings' path lost;
[4512] Wind-awareness main-point not existing, knowing-awareness does not penetrate inside—
[4513] Therefore three main-points determined.
[4514] More than that: limitless, lose main-point;
[4515] Few: meaning not accomplished—therefore three determined.
[4516] Second: deliver particular self's main-point to point:
[4517] Determine general sequence of three main-points,
[4518] Deliver individual main-points to point.
[4519] First: body, speech, mind three not moving,
[4520] Gate and field and wind-awareness bound.
[4521] Seeing differentiated by lineage scripture:
[4522] From Self-Arising Awareness Tantra,
[4523] Thus body, etcetera—
[4524] By fully pressing all main-points,
[4525] Awareness itself and directly,
[4526] From guru's instruction, know.
[4527] Thus said, and:
[4528] From Thalgyur:
[4529] Relying upon actual main, self mind,
[4530] Body main-point and speech and also,
[4531] Relying upon mind main-point,
[4532] Making wind somehow slow,
[4533] Arising from fully projecting,
[4534] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4535] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4536] Thus said, and:
[4537] Gate: look with three-bodies' eye;
[4538] Field: separate from obscuration-doer;
[4539] Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness.
[4540] Thus it was said.
[4541] Second: from three main-points—gate,
[4542] Field,
[4543] And wind-awareness.
[4544] First: wisdom does not dawn with ordinary gaze manner;
[4545] Train in three bodies' gaze manners.
[4546] From Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra:
[4547] By dharmakaya gaze manner,
[4548] Press and extract three-realms' samsara;
[4549] Sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground;
[4550] Nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field.
[4551] Thus said, and:
[4552] From Letterless:
[4553] Gaze eye at sky element.
[4554] Thus said, and:
[4555] From Secret Sound Tantra:
[4556] Lower, reverse, corner—three;
[4557] Gaze manner types three, famous.
[4558] Thus it was said.
[4559] That also: nirmanakaya, lower, buddha, looking at disciples;
[4560] Sambhogakaya, corner look, buddha, looking at field-realm;
[4561] Dharmakaya, reverse, buddha, looking at base.
[4562] Yogin with bad eye faculty:
[4563] Harmonizing with nirmanakaya gaze manner, eye not dim purpose exists.
[4564] Eye possessing fault:
[4565] Harmonizing with sambhogakaya, eye clear purpose exists.
[4566] Eye faculty good:
[4567] Harmonizing with dharmakaya mode, swift vision arrives at measure purpose exists.
[4568] Not moving from those, determined to realize within three-eyes.
[4569] Dharmakaya: dharmata eye existing in speech.
[4570] By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—
[4571] This same, certain.
[4572] Sambhogakaya: wisdom eye existing in body;
[4573] By that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands.
[4574] Nirmanakaya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart;
[4575] By that blessing, seeing separate from sound word,
[4576] Hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmata's meaning dawns within.
[4577] That also: three-eyes gaze,
[4578] Dharmata eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point.
[4579] Equal gaze at wisdom's corner,
[4580] Equal mixing samsara-nirvana taste—main-point.
[4581] Look with discriminating-awareness lowered,
[4582] Actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point.
[4583] What is three gaze manners' determination?
[4584] Lazy one: sambhogakaya;
[4585] Diligent one: nirmanakaya;
[4586] Equanimity one: dharmakaya gaze manner—auspicious;
[4587] Therefore three determined.
[4588] Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmata,
[4589] Gaze pure, obscuration exhausted;
[4590] Mode: liberating from samsara.
[4591] Second, field's main-point:
[4592] Outer dhatu's field: empty sky, separate from clouds.
[4593] Inner dhatu's field: gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot,
[4594] Dhatu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.
[4595] From Thalgyur:
[4596] Dhatu: outer and inner;
[4597] Outer: gaze at cloud-separate sky;
[4598] When dust and rain removed,
[4599] Press direct main-point, expert,
[4600] Make inner lamp the path.
[4601] Thus it was said.
[4602] That also: outer awareness dawning field;
[4603] Inner: experience increasing field.
[4604] Awareness and experience, from two not existing,
[4605] Called samsara-nirvana mixed.
[4606] That also: earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse—
[4607] Gaze at field, not liberate.
[4608] First: not desire vision dawn;
[4609] Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like,
[4610] Knowing also compatible with that arises,
[4611] Emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.
