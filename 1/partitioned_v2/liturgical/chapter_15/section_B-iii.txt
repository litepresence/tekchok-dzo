[6207] From the Self-Dawning:
[6208] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6209] No view, meditation, or conduct.
[6210] Yet hold well-taught in mind.
[6211] Without accomplishing, without wishing to move ability,
[6212] The meaning of that itself, spontaneously complete without doing, as before.
[6213] Where are doings and doers?
[6214] This self-arisen dharmata without conduct,
[6215] Not falling in any direction, like space,
[6216] Not existence—only oneness of emptiness,
[6217] Not non-existence—true bliss body,
[6218] Not made—self-arisen, concept-free.
[6219] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6220] Where is dharmata of meditation?
[6221] Dharma without sending or keeping,
[6222] Free from end of meditated and non-meditated.
[6223] What defilement of hold-free mind?
[6224] True awareness without defilement;
[6225] Upon stainless pure dharmakaya,
[6226] Nothing to meditate or be meditated.
[6227] Not finding true itself by meditating;
[6228] If found, self-awareness becomes non-existent.
[6229] Why? In self-awareness wisdom,
[6230] Without distracted or non-distracted.
[6231] Where there is holding,
[6232] Self-arisen wisdom does not exist.
[6235] That also: dharmas thus:
[6236] No ceasing from non-birth;
[6237] Free at self-place from non-holding;
[6238] No elaboration from non-reference;
[6239] Existing in all, not arisen from making;
[6240] Fully pure expanse through unconditioned;
[6241] Term of holding separate from dharmas;
[6242] Separate from expression through non-nature.
[6244] From the Nor bu phra bkod:
[6245] Ha ha!
[6246] Dharmata arising from non-dharma;
[6247] Object-like vision from non-object;
[6248] Dharma-free wisdom interiorly clear,
[6249] Memoryless: non-existent as object.
[6251] From the Seng ge rtsal rdzogs:
[6252] This entity-free dharmata without holding-attachment,
[6253] Supreme non-dual intention of all Buddhas.
[6254] Discrimination and marks, path of words,
[6255] Self-place pure dharmata without action-effort,
[6256] Ub chub samadhi entering dharmata-object.
[6257] Pure and impure terms non-existent as dharmas;
[6258] Primordially abiding meaning exceeding one and two,
[6259] Ub by one bindu in the manner of self-body.
[6261] From the Klong drug pa:
[6262] No reference in endless center;
[6263] No thinking, no objects;
[6264] No deity, no mantra either;
[6265] Beyond all designation of non-dharma;
[6266] No enemy, no friend either;
[6267] No body, no vision to powers;
[6268] Dharmas not visible by thinking;
[6269] No holding of what is non-existent where;
[6270] No I, no possessions of I;
[6271] No expanse, no awareness body either;
[6272] No ripening of virtue or evil;
[6273] No life, no reference to cut;
[6274] No collection, no field to accumulate;
[6275] No Buddha, no beings;
[6276] No abiding, no emptiness either.
[6278] From Samantabhadra's Mind Mirror:
[6279] To enlightenment essence without deviation or obstacle,
[6280] Where is holding deviation and obstacle?
[6281] Completely non-existent: deviation-free obstacles.
[6282] To dharmakaya separate from obstacles,
[6283] Holding deviation-obstacle as two is afflicted.
[6284] To unborn dharmakaya arising from self,
[6285] Capability-delusion of hoping to come from other.
[6286] To unborn awareness separate from thought,
[6287] Oh wonder, shown in words and letters!
[6289] From the Yi ge med pa:
[6290] Where is doer of unmade?
[6291] No lord of unfabricated fabrication;
[6292] Separate from view-doing dharmas of non-view;
[6293] Fully clear see-doer of non-seeing;
[6294] Separate from appear-direction of non-appear-doer;
[6295] Pervading ten directions, untouchable, of non-writing;
[6296] Separate from effort-accomplish dharmas of non-effort;
[6297] Separate from many dharmas of non-oneness;
[6298] Clear without outer-inner of non-outer-inner.
[6300] Also from the Common Secret Illusion:
[6301] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6302] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6303] All born from unborn,
[6304] Unborn from merely born.
[6305] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6306] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6307] All abiding from non-abiding,
[6308] Non-abiding from merely abiding.
[6309] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6310] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6311] Going and coming from non-going-coming,
[6312] Non-going-coming from going-coming itself.
[6314] Also from the Ratnakuta Sutra:
[6315] The Thus-Come always born,
[6316] Non-dharma,
[6317] All dharmas like the Blissfully-Come.
[6318] Childish intellects holding marks,
[6319] Practicing non-existent dharmas in the pure world.
[6321] Also from the Samadhiraja Sutra:
[6322] When this world realm arises and
[6323] Ceases after arising, abiding empty,
[6324] Like before, so also after—
[6325] Know all dharmas thus.
[6327] From the Arya Ratnakuta Sutra:
[6328] Non-awareness like space,
[6329] All dharmas without characteristics,
[6330] Without support, without abiding, without taking—
[6331] Fully know as like emanations.
[6333] From the Guhyasamaja:
[6334] These entities unborn,
[6335] Dharma and dharmata non-existent,
[6336] Selfless like space—
[6337] This manner of enlightenment shown.
[6339] Second: two parts regarding cutting connection to great root-free emptiness of self-mind without binding or freeing:
[6340] General explanation through examining three goings of arising-places, and
[6341] Particular certainty through examining one and different.
[6342] First:
[6343] Although essence is end-free like space,
[6344] Without inner examination by self, remaining in thought "is," going like a darkness-stone through empty meditation,
[6345] Through not thinking copper-shining directly, not separating the difference-edge of samsara-nirvana,
[6346] Need discriminating wisdom for realization dawning as certain knowledge.
[6347] From the Yi ge med pa:
[6348] Although awareness nature pervades all,
[6349] Said to reach dharma instruction.
[6350] Here, to be realized through guru's instruction, three parts:
[6351] Examining arising-place and arising-agent;
[6352] Examining abiding-place and abiding-agent;
[6353] Examining going-place and going-agent.
[6354] First, from the two:
[6355] Arising place: outer various objects appearing,
[6356] Inner: aggregates appearing as form.
[6357] When either of those two minds dawns:
[6358] Dawned outward: outer object;
[6359] Dawned inward: inner body.
[6360] Examining dust-particles without parts, dividing layer by layer,
[6361] Seeing arising-place's vision-object non-existent, recognizing mind did not arise from that—cutting connection to great root-free basis of concept holding grasped object.
[6362] If arising-agent sha-ra-ra o-la-la's mind and mental-events arise from themselves, momentary knowing becomes two substances;
[6363] Examining complete: not arising from self or other.
[6364] Now, thinking that arising-place arises self-arisen:
[6365] Color,
[6366] Shape,
[6367] Sign,
[6368] Characteristic,
[6369] Big-small,
[6370] Direction-part, etc.—examining what exists, not abiding anywhere.
[6371] Merely mind-examined, basisless, gone everywhere primordially pure,
[6372] Inner holding-concept, basisless like sky, realized by self,
[6373] All grasping-holding appearing as dharma and dharmata, realized at that time as great support-free without object.
[6374] Realizing today mind's primordial non-arising at first—understanding meaning of great elaboration-free dharmakaya.
[6375] Second: middle abiding-place and abiding-agent.
[6376] Third: likewise destroying and examining end going-place and going-agent two,
[6377] Touching intention of great self-luminous Sambhogakaya and
[6378] Self-free self-dawning emanation body.
[6379] Outer-inner objectless, unsupported awareness;
[6380] Grasping-holding basisless;
[6381] Understanding meaning of equal intention without interval.
[6382] Self-buddha great equality dawning interiorly as unmeditated river-flow samadhi.
[6383] From the Thal 'gyur:
[6384] Mind: first arising place,
[6385] Middle abiding place, end going place.
[6386] Thus examining and analyzing the three,
[6387] Purify mind, know mind's abiding manner.
[6389] At that time, all outer object-vision non-existent, suddenly basisless vision;
[6390] All inner mind-concepts dawn-free, without trace.
[6391] Called "dawning in mind-exhaustion the intention of dharma-exhaustion" through seeing great copper-shining without connection between vision and mind.
[6392] These are said in the Arya Ratnakuta:
[6393] Kashyapa, herein bodhisattvas mahasattvas begin the diligence of fully searching mind.
[6394] That mind is not observed outwardly,
[6395] Not observed inwardly,
[6396] Not existing and not observed in the interval of both.
[6397] Not blue,
[6398] Not yellow, and so forth.
[6399] Supreme among all diligences to that is the diligence of fully searching mind—thus said.
[6400] Second: examining one and different—
[6401] The instruction of destroying mind's house.
[6402] Moreover: if this called "mind" exists, from what cause does it arise?
[6403] If non-existent, what are this movement and memory-knowing wheel?
[6404] Upon what condition do these memory-knowing aspects depend to arise?
[6405] Without condition, these sudden memory-knowings are unsuitable.
[6406] If this mind exists as one with body, it would also be destroyed when body is destroyed;
[6407] If non-existent, with uncertain following-return, body-sickness would come to mind.
[6408] Unsuitable for before-after birth wheel to come.
[6409] If "mind" here is one, through one realm's powers ceasing, other realms should also die;
[6410] If not one, realm minds should differ like realm forms differ; if different, all those insects and beings inside one body
[6411] Should live when one person's life-time is done.
[6412] If one, what is this coming of numberless outer-inner beings to one body?
[6413] If this mind has a returning place,
[6414] First there must be a cause.
[6415] If cause exists, conditioned and impermanent, destroyed again—unsuitable for good or bad in actions.
[6416] Without returning place, the coming of numberless sentient being aggregates is unsuitable.
[6417] If that mind were various, self-other thoughts suddenly coming to realms is unsuitable.
[6418] Through mutual intermixing,
[6419] Self-conquest,
[6420] Non-death,
[6421] Absence of suffering,
[6422] Possession of retinue and enjoyments bringing happiness,
[6423] Defeat of others and all shared perceptions coming uniformly is unsuitable.
[6424] If they were different,
[6425] Since many realms exist,
[6426] It would be suitable for some to come with agreement with others through self-defeat, happiness, and so forth.
[6427] If one only thinks, would all die through one dying,
[6428] Or would all be born through one being born?
[6429] Thus, examining and searching one's own mind through the door of many aspects with the controversy of one and different,
[6430] Finding nothing is realizing with the power of wisdom the meaning of primordial purity of dharmata.
[6431] Mind having no cause, return is impossible—boundless faith in accumulation of actions.
[6432] Mind having cause, result must come.
[6433] If result is samsara, impure, liberation is impossible.
[6434] If transcended, samsara's coming is unsuitable.
[6435] If both,
[6436] Samsara and nirvana being different, mind also becomes different.
[6437] If different,
[6438] Like body and mind being different, desires gathered in one family of memory-thought would become many different—from
[6439] Knowing through gathering in one family.
[6440] Moreover: if mind has no cause, these minds are unsuitable.
[6441] These do not arise from mind's cause, for they are not intelligence.
[6442] Not arising from mind, there is no failure to realize mind's mere dwelling in itself.
[6443] These birth,
[6444] Death,
[6445] Abiding, and so forth neither exhaust
[6446] Nor increase—
[6447] From scripture:
[6448] "In this ignorance-illusion wheel, no exhaustion, no increase."
[6449] And:
[6450] "The nature of the realm of beings also has no end."
[6451] Thus said.
[6453] Thus, through causelessness, know increase not existing in mind.
[6454] Through non-increase, know non-birth.
[6455] Through non-birth, know non-death.
[6456] Knowing that, know also no evil in actions.
[6457] From the Condensed:
[6458] "This pair of existence and non-existence is the dharma of non-existence."
[6460] Thus, knowing self-empty from primordial beginning,
[6461] "How could beings be born, being pure from the beginning?"
[6462] Thus it is said.
[6463] Moreover, mind is conditionless:
[6464] If it existed, like appearances appearing variously, mind also would become various in color, etc., through conditions.
[6465] Mind having become different, memory-thought is unsuitable as one.
[6466] If mind had conditions, it would certainly be destroyed—
[6467] Concluding no action-result in mind.
[6468] Even if mind ceases, if its action exists,
[6469] This is greatly contradictory,
[6470] Equal to saying that body's color, sense-bases, good and bad all dwell even when body ceases.
[6471] Thus, clear through mere dwelling like illusion.
[6472] If conditionless, from what does this various memory-thought now arise?
[6473] This present memory-thought does not arise from conditions—
[6474] Like happiness and holding as true upon finding yesterday's dream jewel,
[6475] When waking, nothing exists.
[6476] Even though now's memory-thought is held as true and attached, after that nothing exists—there is no establishment from circumstance's true-false-like appearance.
[6477] For example: like sky's various clouds suddenly gathering, without trace of where they went, suddenly dissolving,
[6478] Though clouds do not exist in sky, they appear in its nature.
[6479] Though conditions and causes do not exist in mind, like appearing appearances, at the time of appearing, cause and condition do not exist—certain of non-existence through examination of one, many, and three times.
[6480] From the Root of Wisdom:
[6481] "From seed ceased and not ceased,
[6482] Sprout's birth does not exist.
[6483] You have shown all dharmas
[6484] Arising like illusions."
[6486] "The fifth condition is non-existent."
[6487] Thus said.
[6488] Also from the All-Creating:
[6489] "The supreme path of peace without cause and condition."
[6490] Thus explained, and so forth.
[6491] Therefore, if mind exists,
[6492] Does entity possess form,
[6493] Or exist formlessly?
[6494] It does not possess form—for if it existed, it would be suitable for sense-power's direct perception; clear through valid cognition of direct perception not observing the suitable-for-seeing.
[6495] If it exists formlessly, how is it known?
[6496] If known through movement,
[6497] That movement is merely needed, direction-part,
[6498] And past-future-present three meeting—unestablished through examination.
[6499] If former movement and present movement meet, the meeting-part's former memory-thought would need to exist now without ceasing;
[6500] If it existed, this contradicts being former.
[6501] If present's former and that part cease, and they do not meet, present memory-thought would have no cause—movement is unsuitable, thus stopped.
[6502] Is movement one or different?
[6503] If one, the becoming-various is lost;
[6504] If different, since move-maker is one, it is lost.
[6505] Thus, mind's existence is unestablished,
[6506] Realizing like rootless sky.
[6507] Birth and birth-basis not existing, no returning place.
[6508] Place not existing, memory-thought before-after interval facing-introduces, dissolving there—recognizing no basis in mind.
[6509] Knowing that, faith in no returning place.
[6510] Knowing that, deciding upon the great namelessness of three realms.
[6511] Through that dharma, mind's ease without benefit-harm of virtuous and vicious actions.
[6512] Moreover, appearance-knowing before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6513] Recognizing mind's non-establishment as cause and characteristic.
[6514] Knowing that, faith in no identifying-grasping of mind's emptiness itself.
[6515] Believing that, deciding mind does not arise from causes and conditions.
[6516] Through that dharma, mind's ease without benefit-harm from sudden memory-thoughts' thoughts.
[6517] Moreover, mind's ease.
[6518] Moreover, mind before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6519] Recognizing no root in mind.
[6520] Knowing that, faith in no different elaborations in mind's single wheel.
[6521] Believing that, deciding buddhahood not achieved through fabricated dharmas.
[6522] Cutting that, mind's ease without failure to realize from non-existent mind's meaning.
[6523] Moreover, dharmata before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6524] Recognizing no birth in mind.
[6525] Knowing that, faith that propensities are not harmed by body's all-ground.
[6526] Believing that, deciding mind's birth impossible now.
[6527] Through that dharma, mind's ease without returning place and returning-support, mind's house ceasing.
[6528] Thus, through grasping the measure of four times of mind-searching,
[6529] Buddha not existing, buddha also not even name-only.
[6530] Mind turning from holding hope for results.
[6531] That turning, no dharmas making path effort-exertion.
[6532] Thus, non-existent dharma having nothing, called "liberation's measure" through not finding meaning from mere names designated as samsara-nirvana.
[6533] Therefore, mind itself non-existent having nothing,
[6534] Mind having no cause-reason, not seen,
[6535] Thus turning four face-introducings of non-existence, and
[6536] Realizing sixteen dharma-possessors
[6537] Is destroying mind's house.
[6538] Like child's house built and destroyed;
[6539] Like that: action destroys action, iron destroys iron;
[6540] Impermanent destroys impermanent, like illusion-person destroys illusion-city;
[6541] Made destroys impermanent, like corpse stacked on corpse;
[6542] Impermanent destroys made, like present wisdom destroys former ignorance.
[6543] Thus, mind destroying mind, both dissolve without track, like letters written on water;
[6544] Not-exist seeking not-exist also not finding, like no finding-place though searching for wish-fulfilling jewel not existing in poor house.
[6545] Non-existent mind having no place to destroy
[6546] Is like no holding-place in water when dissolving.
[6547] Therefore, not knowing non-existent mind's meaning,
[6548] Searching mind for view-meditation-conduct
