[5080] Transcend knowing experience—
[5081] Empty, clear, extreme separate,
[5082] Realize measure with discriminating-awareness potency.
[5083] This same: from habituation of first, middle, end—
[5084] Knowing pleasure happiness experience,
[5085] And end change experience,
[5086] And vision experience, three arise.
[5087] First is:
[5088] Bind body speech main-point,
[5089] Wind mind relax from latency;
[5090] Inner samadhi pervades luminous-clear empty state,
[5091] And spacious knowing, grasp-hold not-existing,
[5092] Pleasure happiness vast, arise spread-desire,
[5093] Though not-existing attachment grasp, even hair-tip,
[5094] Arise from arriving at nature meditation main-point.
[5095] Fabricated meditation: pleasure happiness arise,
[5096] Great experience change,
[5097] Coarse throb or song dance desire arise,
[5098] Cause attachment grasp to go.
[5099] This: though dawn pleasure happiness,
[5100] Also self-power obtain pleasure happiness,
[5101] Grasp not-existing, knowing difference existing,
[5102] Fabricated meditate.
[5103] Know difference of meditation arriving at nature wind.
[5104] End change experience: wind experience vision part is:
[5105] Like firefly,
[5106] Like cloud,
[5107] Like smoke,
[5108] Like haze,
[5109] Like moon dawn,
[5110] Like star dawn,
[5111] Like sky brightening, blue vision existing,
[5112] Like sun dawn, outer inner unimpeded vision—
[5113] Eight.
[5114] Become clear dim and dawn cease cause:
[5115] Not firm, cannot stand, change go—
[5116] Called end change experience,
[5117] Cause is wind moving experience.
[5118] These do existing, need purify wind mind.
[5119] Vision experience is:
[5120] Great awareness self-resonance luminous-clear.
[5121] Occasion: outer vision increases,
[5122] From arriving at measure;
[5123] Self-resonance dissolves into base,
[5124] Reverse inner, only outer clear need;
[5125] Cause need dissolve into spontaneous-completion pure dhatu.
[5126] Inner clear: in self-light expanse,
[5127] Awareness body wisdom palace,
[5128] Originally abide spontaneous-completion great,
[5129] Not-existing change.
[5130] Therefore here: vision experience is chief.
[5131] Knowing experience: is intellect,
[5132] Change, cannot stand measure,
[5133] All-conceptual conventional appearance possessor,
[5134] Remember doer difference,
[5135] Near-side concept gather cause.
[5136] Do measure this: similar to bird
[5137] Doing hide cover, place measure in cloud.
[5138] Time not existing to realize meaning,
[5139] See self-point not arrive.
[5140] This: vision experience,
[5141] See wisdom five color vision,
[5142] Transcend half end of samsara action,
[5143] Grasp field vision.
[5144] See dhatu vision: that above,
[5145] Not existing grasp concept part half,
[5146] Grasp empty extreme wrong cause,
[5147] Transcend two-thirds samsara part.
[5148] Self-purify all-concept base ground,
[5149] Grasp part half,
[5150] Grasp vision self-characteristic wrong cause,
[5151] Called person and dharmas grasp-hold self not-existing concept.
[5152] Briefly: all vision experiences—
[5153] Wisdom five color vision,
[5154] And dhatu vision,
[5155] Two gather.
[5156] Above increase is:
[5157] Go those visions more beautiful, more good, more many.
[5158] General show this purify manner,
[5159] And particular explain vision manner—two from:
[5160] First is:
[5161] Apply samsara liberate manner from binding;
[5162] That vision: up-stand,
[5163] And wing dawn,
[5164] And boat-part,
[5165] And part,
[5166] And cloth vision—five complete,
[5167] From obtaining power of wisdom five color.
[5168] Liberate from binding:
[5169] Five manifest move—desire,
[5170] Aversion,
[5171] Delusion,
[5172] Pride,
[5173] Jealousy.
[5174] Cause not existing other than latency only,
[5175] Itself transcend samsara half.
[5176] Then: net form,
[5177] And net half,
[5178] And eye many line,
[5179] And like eye spot form,
[5180] And see like canopy tent house—
[5181] Transcend from self made by form etcetera aggregate five collection.
[5182] Transcend world self three two,
[5183] Pure blessing of dharmata view.
[5184] Then: wisdom entity pure shape vision.
[5185] Like wisdom palace shape,
[5186] And like sun-moon pair connect form,
[5187] And like lotus stack form,
[5188] And like stupa stack form,
[5189] And see like lotus thousand-possess form—
[5190] Transcend element five binding cause.
[5191] Those also: called experience one-arise one-cease;
[5192] That also: called above increase,
[5193] Cause become difference from previous.
[5194] Thus: awareness cause arise,
[5195] Arise from previously relying on empowerment sequence.
[5196] Second: particular explain vision manner:
[5197] From two—wisdom five color vision,
[5198] And shape vision.
[5199] First is:
[5200] Fully purify vajra family cause:
[5201] Mirror-like wisdom self-light,
[5202] Dawn white color form;
[5203] That same vajra unmovable resonance,
[5204] Pierce white, dawn.
[5205] Below that: fully purify tathagata family cause:
[5206] Dhatu wisdom, dawn blue color form;
[5207] Display resonance, dawn blue-black.
[5208] Fully purify jewel family cause:
[5209] Equality color yellow cloth,
[5210] And very pierce Jewel Source resonance,
[5211] Like refined gold, dawn.
[5212] Fully purify lotus family cause:
[5213] Discriminate wisdom color red cloth,
[5214] And very red Infinite resonance,
[5215] Like coral color, dawn.
[5216] Fully purify karma family cause:
[5217] Action accomplish wisdom,
[5218] Dawn green color cloth;
[5219] Very green Actual Accomplish resonance,
[5220] Like indranila form, dawn.
[5221] Those: outer sequence, blue vajra fence all surround is:
[5222] Show wisdom those not-existing difference.
[5223] That-from vision increase:
[5224] Five five clear, each chief color five light.
[5225] Arise from family and family difference.
[5226] Then: fully purify wisdom wind cause,
[5227] Mirror-like condition up-stand vision is;
[5228] Arise experience increase, rely that.
[5229] Equality wing dawn vision is:
[5230] Near itself, delusion vision exhaust.
[5231] Then: discriminate boat-part vision is:
[5232] Time element subtle cease.
[5233] Action accomplish victory-banner form only vision is:
[5234] Arise from wisdom self-resonance individual clear.
[5235] Then: dhatu wisdom field boat-only vision is:
[5236] Arise from coarse conceptuality cease.
[5237] Those path arise sequence is:
[5238] To great diligence: interval five five days;
[5239] To middle: seven seven days;
[5240] To low: twenty-one twenty-one days,
[5241] From previous vision ceasing,
[5242] Also form dawn below vision those.
[5243] Here interval color and shape: arise abide moment.
[5244] Then: from those ceasing,
[5245] Also dawn wisdom five shape form;
[5246] Become like mirror-like shape eye spot form.
[5247] Arise cause: very good increase that color.
[5248] Habituation that: dawn eye many line.
[5249] Arise cause: this preliminary measure arrive.
[5250] Then: dawn equality net half.
[5251] Arise cause: that wind purify pure.
[5252] That-from: arise preliminary pure complete net vision.
[5253] Then: dawn discriminate flower heap.
[5254] Arise cause: gaze manner effort.
[5255] That-from: dawn lotus thousand-possess,
[5256] Arise cause preliminary purify.
[5257] Then: dawn action accomplish weapon like.
[5258] Arise cause: nature not-fabricate.
[5259] That-from: arise various wheel etcetera form vision,
[5260] Arise cause preliminary complete.
[5261] Then: dawn dhatu wisdom palace.
[5262] Arise from drawing awareness from eye.
[5263] That-from: arise like canopy tent house,
[5264] Arise cause preliminary pure make.
[5265] Those also: difference of diligence,
[5266] Day three,
[5267] Seven,
[5268] Fourteen: one-arise one-cease.
[5269] That beyond: experience increasing above vision.
[5270] These: mind preliminary time,
[5271] Sign is that cease raise conceptuality difference.
[5272] Then: dawn awareness self-essence vision;
[5273] Light those dawn point,
[5274] Arise cause gather hanging-cord one.
[5275] Then: two points connect vision,
[5276] Arise cause fully purify method discriminating-awareness.
[5277] Then: five points connect vision,
[5278] Arise cause five wisdoms enter.
[5279] Direct: manner not different point connect,
[5280] Cause small existing.
[5281] That beyond: experience increasing above vision.
[5282] From Thalgyur:
[5283] Also light of color five:
[5284] Vision boat-part only victory-banner;
[5285] Measure see field boat-only.
[5286] Thus said, and:
[5287] From Self-Arising Tantra:
[5288] Thus see self-face:
[5289] From upper joint finger-four,
[5290] Separate good-capacity person—
[5291] How possible enter samsara?
[5292] Whatever dawn form boat-part,
[5293] This accomplish emanation quality;
[5294] Whatever dawn only field see,
[5295] Same is heap;
[5296] Whatever is outer vision cease,
[5297] Sixteen moment;
[5298] This also thus become.
[5299] Thus it was said.
[5300] Third: awareness measure-arriving vision,
[5301] General show vision manner,
[5302] And particular explain nature—two from:
[5303] First is:
[5304] Then: in each point, dawn each body half,
[5305] Arise cause nirmanakaya fully purify purify;
[5306] Then: dawn each body self-only,
[5307] Arise cause nirmanakaya vision, dharmata direct see;
[5308] Then: those bodies become father-mother five five,
[5309] Itself sambhogakaya wisdom measure arrive;
[5310] Then: vision with individual heap mandala.
[5247] The peripheral walls of that very mandala, together with the individual principal retinues that appear therein, arise through the purification of the Dharmakaya reaching its full measure.
[5249] These are the visions of awareness arriving at its measure—the signs that actions and activities of the body during the preliminary phase, together with their connections, will not arise again in future.
[5252] Although these visions appear through reaching the vital points of the preliminary phase and other antidotes that purify each defilement to be purified, they are merely designated as the causal result of separation and the causal relationship between what purifies and what is purified. They do not arise from being produced by that, for wisdom's self-existing resonance appears through the force of purifying the obscurations of defilement.
[5255] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5256] The vision of awareness arriving at its measure—
[5257] The marks and examples of Sambhogakaya clearly manifest
[5258] From the rainbow lights of indeterminate color
[5259] The five families appear as fathers and mothers.
[5261] From the Bstan bu:
[5262] From such bodies up to their limit,
[5263] Six, ten, and five-three—
[5264] Without doubt, this is Sambhogakaya.
[5266] Second, the explanation of the nature in particular has two parts:
[5267] The general explanation of the definition of "arriving at measure," and
[5268] The particular explanation of the three measures.
[5269] The first: "Awareness arriving at measure" means
[5270] The awareness of the basis-abide becoming manifest,
[5271] Having entered the path-tradition,
[5272] Through the body-visions of the spontaneously accomplished self-resonance of basis-vision dawning,
[5273] The path-visions approach exhaustion,
[5274] And the mandalas become complete.
[5275] "Measure" is from the first half-body up to the completion of the body-mandala.
[5276] "Arrive" means there is no place beyond that—complete manifestation.
[5277] These are like the form of the full moon,
[5278] The mandala complete through the waxing and waning, without fabrication upon self-essence.
[5279] Second, the explanation of the three measures in particular has three parts:
[5280] Outer visions,
[5281] Inner body measure,
[5282] Secret awareness measure.
[5283] The first is controlling the visions and the completion of the realms in luminous clarity.
[5285] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5286] The measure of completion having thus arrived—
[5287] Direct objective visions cease,
[5288] The vision of earth and stones melts away,
[5289] Self-knowing enters into everything,
[5290] Inert things move when directed,
[5291] The measure of wind's movement is grasped,
[5292] The body's dust-particles become visible.
[5293] Whatever appears becomes complete as form-bodies,
[5294] From that fathers and mothers embrace,
[5295] The five and five fathers and mothers unite,
[5296] All within the round periphery—
[5297] The yogin's body also luminous,
[5298] Appearing to go, come, and sit.
[5299] All is awareness arriving at its measure.
[5301] Second:
[5302] Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white A, five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window, piercing into the light-star-window within the intermediate space.
[5303] Rising through the crown, wisdom wind abides, appearing naturally uplifted.
[5304] From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly.
[5305] Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil.
[5306] Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth, outer and inner parts smaller than the scope of dust-particles, each containing numberless lands and realms, measureless Buddhas and beings appear—these are all visions of the spontaneously accomplished eight doors dawning here, appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.
[5307] In the crown-palace, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala.
[5308] In all parts of the body, natural emanations,
[5309] Emanations taming beings,
[5310] Various emanations appear, doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields.
[5311] Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and
[5312] The wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn.
[5313] Through the door of pure wisdom, the pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakaya.
[5314] The mind's defilements purified, obtaining the separation from dust and doubt,
[5315] The latencies of ground and grounds self-purify. From the Thal 'gyur:
[5316] The body arriving at measure also becomes thus:
[5317] Free from the dust of individual bodies,
[5318] The light-star-window of intermediate space appears.
[5319] Then light-rays in the shape of hooks,
[5320] Subtle and coiling, hold the vision.
[5321] The body's dust naturally ceasing,
[5322] The copper-shining stainless light-body.
[5323] The A mark in the center,
[5324] And the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure.
[5325] The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing.
[5326] From the peaceful body's fingers,
[5327] Light-garlands coil in form.
[5328] Activity of silent mind,
[5329] From the skull palace of the head,
[5330] Herukas manifestly arise.
[5331] At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—
[5332] The copper-shining three bodies coil as one.
[5334] Third, the secret awareness measure:
[5335] Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified,
[5336] There exists merely the all-ground consciousness mind,
[5337] Dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye.
[5338] From that itself:
[5339] At this time the mind is clear,
[5340] Together with the six clairvoyances,
[5341] Far and concealed
[5342] Dharmas become known in a moment.
[5343] Measureless Buddha-realms and
[5344] Likewise bodies appear to mind.
[5345] Defilements exhaust in empty mind,
[5346] Nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity.
[5347] Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse,
[5348] Through manifest clarity, not separate from the many.
[5349] Without parts, without elaboration.
[5351] That also: in the two upper visions, purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness,
[5352] At the time of obtaining this, through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections,
[5353] Free from subtle and coarse defilements,
[5354] The body-mind connection cut,
[5355] Outer visions' objects appear to awareness.
[5356] The investigating agent consciousness part, acting as self-condition through the power of all-ground consciousness,
[5357] Like a shooting star moving in the sky, the momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing, pure without looking to separate antidotes.
[5358] At the time of the two upper visions, wind is thrown outward and not held inward,
[5359] Arising through the ability to purify conceptuality not abiding in two moments,
[5360] The body copper-shining,
[5361] The all-ground consciousness part clear-vivid like fire-sparks of concept-free object-awareness emitting.
[5362] Seeing the two aspects of outer extending vision and inner self-vision, body and mind separate and cut,
[5363] Accomplishing the great mandala, the supreme ground of not returning outward to the three realms.
[5364] Again from the Thal 'gyur:
[5365] At all times of such vision,
[5366] The cutting of body-mind connection,
[5367] From the contaminated exhausted body also,
[5368] The mind with clear characteristics arising outward,
[5369] Like a shooting star emitting,
[5370] Clearly seen in the realm of space.
[5371] At the first times of that itself,
[5372] From separation from wind also,
[5373] Through the action of pure wind, effortful,
[5374] Arising from throwing outward from the body.
[5375] From the part of the two see-agents also,
[5376] The body luminous and pure,
[5377] The mind like fire-sparks emitting,
[5378] Not abiding as one, self-clear basis,
[5379] Arising in the manner of two vision aspects.
[5380] Through this, having cut body-mind connection,
[5381] There is no returning to the three realms.
[5383] At this time, the see-agent also, like a shooting star or fire-sparks, the all-ground consciousness part,
[5384] Together with the compassion-wisdom part of awareness,
[5385] Arise as the wisdom part seeing the two outer and inner objects.
[5386] At this time there is no intentionally setting gaze manner etc. through antidote,
[5387] For one never passes beyond the wheel of dharmata.
[5388] This is called "completion of practice measure."
[5389] Fourth, the dharmata-exhausting vision has two parts:
[5390] Brief showing of exhaustion manner, and
[5391] Extensive explanation of nature.
[5392] First:
[5393] From the vision like the full moon of previous measure-arrival,
[5394] The manner of self-resonance dissolving into the expanse,
[5395] Like the moon waning from that,
[5396] Again that body fading until reaching the bindu, certain vision to the first mind.
[5397] That applies in sequence to the manner of purifying the four visions through the fourfold sequence of container-contents' arising, abiding, destruction, and emptiness.
