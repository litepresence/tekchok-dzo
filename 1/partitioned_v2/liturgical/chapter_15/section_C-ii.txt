[7038] From Letter Non-Existent:
[7039] All arising: delusion appearance my mind;
[7040] All abiding: delusion appearance my heart;
[7041] All appearing: delusion appearance my body;
[7042] All sounding: delusion appearance my speech.
[7043] Seeing not-ceasing: appear like my form;
[7044] Hearing not-ceasing: sound like my sound;
[7045] Smelling not-ceasing: feel like my smell;
[7046] Tasting not-ceasing: tone like my taste;
[7047] Feeling not-ceasing: quick like my mind;
[7048] Secret afflictions: my miracles;
[7049] Buddhas beings: my cemetery;
[7050] All-making I: great self-clear appearance.
[7051] Thus it is said.
[7052] Then: if allowing delusion appearance to self-place release, will delusion not go again?
[7053] Although ordinary beings delude by grasping as self,
[7054] Yogis: by knowing basis-non-existent, not delude by placing self-settled without correcting-changing.
[7055] From Pearl Garland:
[7056] Those beings in samsara
[7057] Bind by self concepts' actions;
[7058] Certain liberate by knowing nature non-existent.
[7059] Thus it is said.
[7060] Also: delusion and liberation rely on inner knowing,
[7061] For outer appearance makes no delusion and liberation—
[7062] Enough to place appearance straight.
[7063] By Tilopa:
[7064] Appearance not bind; grasping binds—
[7065] Cut grasping, Naropa.
[7066] Thus the instruction.
[7067] That also: only placing self-know that actual meaning in self-tone nature,
[7068] Not correctable to good by purposefully corrected view-meditation-action, for nature unchangeable, and
[7069] For self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes not true.
[7070] From Perfection:
[7071] By thought not find primordial wisdom meaning;
[7072] By thought finding primordial wisdom meaning—
[7073] Self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7074] By meditation not see dharmakaya;
[7075] By meditation seeing dharmakaya—
[7076] Self-appearance dharmata becomes false.
[7077] By looking not realize awareness meaning;
[7078] By looking realizing awareness meaning—
[7079] Ceaseless dharmakaya becomes false.
[7080] By dharma not cut ignorance trace;
[7081] By dharma cutting ignorance trace—
[7082] Primordially pure primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7083] Thus it is said.
[7084] Thus: whatever conduct manner made, not transcend dharmata by realizing appear-know to dharmata.
[7085] Whatever appearance manner appears: dawn in play non-ceasing,
[7086] Dawn in mandala of self-arisen meaning.
[7087] Eating-drinking: dharmata approaching;
[7088] Sleeping-sitting: enlightenment accomplishing;
[7089] Formations: abiding meditation;
[7090] Exhaling-inhaling: mandala accomplishing;
[7091] Three-thousand: spontaneously accomplished mandala.
[7092] Rain-water: drip drip of self-settling;
[7093] Path: great bindu of nature;
[7094] Foot: color powder;
[7095] Movement: mudra nature;
[7096] Speech: vajra recitation;
[7097] Memory-thought: generation stage wheel;
[7098] Whatever appears: deity play;
[7099] Self-body: empowerment vase;
[7100] Descending: continuum samaya;
[7101] Knowing-awareness: self-clear instruction;
[7102] Birth-death: dharmata familiarity measure;
[7103] Self-dawn realization of aggregate six object appearance.
[7104] Spontaneously accomplished in great intention of three realms completely liberated.
[7105] From Pearl Garland:
[7106] E ma: thus all appearances—
[7107] If delusion itself self-liberates,
[7108] By what non-existent delusion not liberate?
[7109] All speaking and doing actions:
[7110] Conduct of empty-aware clarity.
[7111] Good and bad thoughts:
[7112] Meditation is great river space;
[7113] Wrong view, right desire:

[7115] Hope and doubt grasping:
[7116] Result copper spontaneously arisen;
[7117] Desiring apparent mahamudra:
[7118] Eating-drinking to approaching;
[7119] Sleeping-sitting is accomplishing;
[7120] Formations: abiding;
[7121] Exhaling-inhaling: mandala accomplishing;
[7122] All three-thousand: to mandala;
[7123] Rain and steam: drip drip established;
[7124] Going path object: great bindu;
[7125] Foot trace: powder;
[7126] Desire to go: manner itself;
[7127] Limb movement: mudra;
[7128] Whatever like speaking: mantra words;
[7129] Thoughts: generation stage;
[7130] Mind moving: offering;
[7131] Appearing as form: deity body;

[7135] Blood and yellow water: all water;
[7136] Filled by substance of heart-meaning etc.;
[7137] Self-to appearing empowerments: all given;
[7138] Not conferring: complete in itself;
[7139] Desire to pass: to samaya;
[7140] Desire to keep: bind;
[7141] Desire to liberate: decline;
[7142] Desire non-existence: supreme;
[7143] All seeing: have mudra;
[7144] Attaching to that: experience;
[7145] To know-awareness clear instruction:
[7146] Object mind two: object to place;
[7147] Birth-age-sickness-death: familiarity vital point;
[7148] Aggregate six non-ceasing: realization.
[7149] Thus it is said.
[7150] Thus: yogi whatever made, deity wheel generated in dharmata nature, with empower complete instruction.
[7151] From dharmata wheel complete, self-settled river-continuum samadhi bridge not cut,
[7152] Effort exertion,
[7153] Cause-effect not depending: obtain great wonderful wonder attainment by nature, supreme ground great mandala complete.
[7154] That also from Thalgyur:
[7155] Thus all by dharmata:
[7156] What to accept: not exist;
[7157] What to place: not exist even a little;
[7158] Dharmata non-existent wherever.
[7159] From self dharmata whatever appears:
[7160] Fabricated dharmata not exist side-to;
[7161] Whatever like made: not-thinking arise;
[7162] Abandon and accept non-existent: face self-appearance.
[7163] Thus said, and:

[7165] Not attach to appearance;
[7166] Not establish non-existent;
[7167] Not abandon existent;

[7181] Appearance self-appearance;
[7182] That time: should release know wide-to mouth—extensively said.
[7183] Three meanings spontaneously equal in great vast space: all primordially transcended complete,
[7184] Echo bind-liberate abandon-accept non-existent in nature, great name-non-existent samsara-nirvana.

[7285] Buddha in non-separate appearance and three bodies—thus said.
[7286] These eight word kings, established by eight great reasons of unchangeable meaning:
[7287] Should explain literally to sharp minds,
[7288] For certain in awareness nature that-only.
[7289] Although explain divided into two truths for inferiors, make realize later;
[7290] If explain straight: become hated.
[7291] From Self-Arising:
[7292] Lion expressing self-voice: all wild animals faint and fear;
[7293] Complete Great speaking self-voice: all lower vehicles faint—thus said.
[7294] Therefore: secret instruction for those desiring definitive meaning of cause-effect without capacity:
[7295] From before that:
[7296] These words: to hearers and
[7297] Self-Buddhas etc.—inside, not speak even dust.
[7298] Why?
[7299] By all these hearing these words:
[7300] Fear,
[7301] Astonishment,
[7302] Become faint;
[7303] Not faithful to secret mantras, mind arising—
[7304] By that ripening: become experiencing great hell of beings.
[7305] What to say of showing and hearing?
[7306] Not speak even in wind direction—thus said.
[7307] Also from common Secret Mantra:
[7308] To beings not completely ripened,
[7309] Proclaiming secrets: seventh.
[7310] Thus said, and:
[7311] Also from Bodhisattva Grounds:
[7312] Showing emptiness to untrained mind—explained as root downfall: secret.
[7313] That also: eight great wonder words making eight consciousness aggregates pure, and
[7314] Twelve great unchangeable nail letters—echo dharma-exhaust non-doing great to instruction, heart not small explained.
[7315] Release mind to great name-non-existent samsara-nirvana at one time, without hope-doubt binding-attachment.
[7316] Great yogis arrived at nature: explain straight cause-effect virtue-sin non-existent, like Padma, Vimala,

[7318] Although we ourselves realize thus in mind, not arrive through familiarity—
[7319] Explain together with not fearing nature and avoiding slight cause-result.
[7320] Thus: twelve vajra laughters explained three times in three instructions become thirty-six—root afflictions, dependent-arising twelve entering manner, and
[7321] Reverse from manner, and
[7322] Completely disperse: thirty-six—understand together with pure places.

[7360] Together with body vital point and wind vital point: firm place in self-clear knowing, self-appearance appearance without grasping-holding.
[7361] From Six Spaces:
[7362] If not making that suchness,
[7363] Like sky not covered by clouds,
[7364] Part clear primordially from primordial tone,
[7365] Thus in clear sky
[7366] Like self-appearance of sun heart,
[7367] Body stain-non-existent essence,
[7368] Heart essence certain one-gathered,
[7369] Mandala of I itself is.
[7370] Thus it is said.
