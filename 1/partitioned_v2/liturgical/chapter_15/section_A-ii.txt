[4720] By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—
[4721] This same, certain.
[4722] Sambhogakaya: wisdom eye existing in body;
[4723] By that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands.
[4724] Nirmanakaya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart;
[4725] By that blessing, seeing separate from sound word,
[4726] Hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmata's meaning dawns within.
[4727] That also: three-eyes gaze,
[4728] Dharmata eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point.
[4729] Equal gaze at wisdom's corner,
[4730] Equal mixing samsara-nirvana taste—main-point.
[4731] Look with discriminating-awareness lowered,
[4732] Actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point.
[4733] What is three gaze manners' determination?
[4734] Lazy one: sambhogakaya;
[4735] Diligent one: nirmanakaya;
[4736] Equanimity one: dharmakaya gaze manner—auspicious;
[4737] Therefore three determined.
[4738] Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmata,
[4739] Gaze pure, obscuration exhausted;
[4740] Mode: liberating from samsara.
[4741] Second, field's main-point:
[4742] Outer dhatu's field: empty sky, separate from clouds.
[4743] Inner dhatu's field: gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot,
[4744] Dhatu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.
[4745] From Thalgyur:
[4746] Dhatu: outer and inner;
[4747] Outer: gaze at cloud-separate sky;
[4748] When dust and rain removed,
[4749] Press direct main-point, expert,
[4750] Make inner lamp the path.
[4751] Thus it was said.
[4752] That also: outer awareness dawning field;
[4753] Inner: experience increasing field.
[4754] Awareness and experience, from two not existing,
[4755] Called samsara-nirvana mixed.
[4756] That also: earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse—
[4757] Gaze at field, not liberate.
[4758] First: not desire vision dawn;
[4759] Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like,
[4760] Knowing also compatible with that arises,
[4761] Emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.
[4762] Gaze awareness at sky empty—
[4763] Field compatible with sky, experience empty,
[4764] Clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns.
[4765] Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristic.
[4766] From Mind Section:
[4767] Yogin abides in sky's bird-path.
[4768] Thus said, and:
[4769] From Collection:
[4770] Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning.
[4771] Thus said, and:
[4772] From Middle Mother:
[4773] Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
[4774] Is making sky-yogin, said, etc.—scriptures immeasurable.
[4775] That also: field outer-inner mixed,
[4776] Called equal limitless view;
[4777] Called dhatu-awareness non-dual view;
[4778] Called dhatu-awareness mixed, samsara-nirvana taste equal view.
[4779] This same, from Instruction-Child also:
[4780] Dhatu and awareness gaze manner,
[4781] Sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.
[4782] Thus spoken.
[4783] Third, wind-awareness main-point:
[4784] When field and gate two meet,
[4785] Rely on slow wind, called capturing awareness.
[4786] That also: somehow slow wind,
[4787] Shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point.
[4788] That also: wind and slow cause—
[4789] Outer: become yogin's life-extending helper;
[4790] Inner: make cause for conceptuality to cease;
[4791] Secret: do action of awareness direct seeing;
[4792] Actual: make buddha, not seeing contaminated.
[4793] That thus, also from Thalgyur:
[4794] Make wind somehow slow,
[4795] Arising from fully projecting,
[4796] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4797] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4798] Thus said, and:
[4799] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom,
[4800] Arising from fully projecting,
[4801] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4802] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4803] Thus said, and:
[4804] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom.
[4805] Thus it was said.
[4806] Awareness main-point: hanging-cord, place in dhatu fence, make not move.
[4807] From that same:
[4808] Self-face awareness hanging-cord,
[4809] Capturing sky, separate from going-coming.
[4810] Thus said, and:
[4811] From Instruction-Child:
[4812] Hanging-cord inside dhatu,
[4813] Arrange place, do not separate.
[4814] Thus it was said.
[4815] That also: relying on slow wind,
[4816] Action separate meaning arises in mind;
[4817] Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead,
[4818] Conceptuality source exhausted from;
[4819] Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet.
[4820] Awareness, separate from wind, going-coming not existing—
[4821] Self-arisen awareness enters.
[4822] That also: if guide, rely on body main-point,
[4823] Do five-six days;
[4824] Then practice gate, only that much;
[4825] Then seek field, do six-seven days;
[4826] Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience.
[4827] That: very purified, meditation knowing arises;
[4828] Other: wrong not-wrong cause, see flickering vision,
[4829] No faith—when guide finishes, what to say? Nothing.
[4830] Various divinations arise near,
[4831] Therefore make pure those not gone thus.
[4832] That: general, when apply great guide,
[4833] Preliminary measure arrives,
[4834] Purify with diligence,
[4835] Actual main: faith, not ordinary, arises.
[4836] Actual main: hit point-delivery,
[4837] Direct delight, special arises.
[4838] Subsequent support: explain dharma end-cut,
[4839] Knowing capable of maintaining experience practice,
[4840] Doubt and conceptuality end,
[4841] Purpose exists: mind not desiring other dharma.
[4842] Second: introduce awareness self-face directly:
[4843] Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like,
[4844] With dhatu luminous-clear vision—
[4845] This, not-deluded buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance.
[4846] Look at state: all concept-doers pure,
[4847] Elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within—
[4848] Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent,
[4849] Meet face of transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom.
[4850] First Samantabhadra, equal capacity.
[4851] When this habituation arrives at measure—
[4852] Liberating with stone into light;
[4853] If not arrived, traverse bardo
[4854] Or nature-emanation field;
[4855] Cut six-realms' delusion precipice.
[4856] Thus introduce, and:
[4857] From Self-Arising Instruction:
[4858] Thus, whoever sees—this person,
[4859] First Samantabhadra,
[4860] Capacity itself is equal.
[4861] Thus said, and:
[4862] From Thalgyur:
[4863] Hanging-cord nature is:
[4864] By all conceptuality pure,
[4865] Base-buddha, not deluded.
[4866] Thus it was said.
[4867] Third: show vision's dawning manner from that:
[4868] Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning,
[4869] Bind tiny point to hanging-cord,
[4870] From first white-pure star-scatter like,
[4871] Point possessing five colors,
[4872] Each one,
[4873] Three-bind interval vision until that.
[4874] From previous:
[4875] Then see point.
[4876] Thus it was said.
[4877] That also: look at outer luminous-clear,
[4878] Inner conceptuality separate,
[4879] Equal limitless liberating;
[4880] Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance,
[4881] And spontaneous-completion light-resonance,
[4882] Two—outer-inner pair connect;
[4883] Called dhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent.
[4884] Third: vision four dawning sequence, two are:
[4885] Briefly show essence,
[4886] Extensively explain nature.
[4887] First: when all four visions,
[4888] Body abiding in posture,
[4889] Eye gazing at gaze manner,
[4890] Wind-awareness mode slow,
[4891] Three main-points harmonize.
[4892] Particularly: first two visions purify,
[4893] Later two not relying on effort,
[4894] Mode purify,
[4895] Liberate into luminous-clear,
[4896] Therefore called dhatu-awareness non-dual.
[4897] These main-points: arise from not doing—
[4898] Separate awareness vajra hanging-cord—main-point.
[4899] Explain that meaning:
[4900] Awareness—essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable,
[4901] Base-abide and that resonance,
[4902] From light channel pure vision,
[4903] Like golden thread coil,
[4904] Curve interval point bind.
[4905] Vajra: all buddhas and sentient beings,
[4906] Essence not existing good-bad,
[4907] Equal, unchanging,
[4908] Place in abiding part.
[4909] Lu: like good water channel,
[4910] Water emerges without increase or decrease.
[4911] Body and wisdom increase-opening,
[4912] Various path-visions until complete,
[4913] From that, dawning cause.
[4914] Gu: inside that,
[4915] Pull not-mistaken dharmata view and meditation.
[4916] Rgyud: pervading samsara-nirvana,
[4917] From those vision collections,
[4918] Body and
[4919] Point radiating and
[4920] Arising and
[4921] Gathering etcetera, clear cause.
[4922] From Thalgyur:
[4923] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom;
[4924] From that, vision becomes four:
[4925] By dharmata direct vision,
[4926] Suppress intellect-grasping view;
[4927] By experience-vision increasing above,
[4928] Cause delusion vision to cease;
[4929] By awareness measure-arriving vision,
[4930] Transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision;
[4931] By dharmata exhausting vision,
[4932] Cut three-realms' samsara stream.
[4933] Thus it was said.
[4934] That also: vision four number determined—
[4935] Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease;
[4936] Inner: body, speech, mind four, liberating from binding;
[4937] Secret: showing empowerment four determination;
[4938] Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.
[4939] Sequence determined:
[4940] First, base dharmata direct not see,
[4941] Remaining three dawning base not existing—
[4942] Basis and supported base,
[4943] First: dharmata direct vision dawning.
[4944] That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning,
[4945] Called self-arisen wisdom self-found.
[4946] Then: direct that, if not experience experience,
[4947] Word only, fruit not arise;
[4948] Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise.
[4949] Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure;
[4950] If not firm, experience no end,
[4951] Not possessing dharmas,
[4952] Buddha not arising cause;
[4953] Arrive at firm experience measure cause.
[4954] Awareness measure-arriving vision arises.
[4955] Though awareness vision arrives at measure,
[4956] If not changing from that to other,
[4957] Not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit,
[4958] Not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit
[4959] From actual vision-mark dharmas.
[4960] Vision-experience dissolves into base;
[4961] Subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases;
[4962] Experience dharmata exhaustion,
[4963] Dharmata-exhausting vision arises.
[4964] Those also: first two—nirmanakaya;
[4965] Measure-arriving—sambhogakaya;
[4966] Exhausting—dharmakaya vision.
[4967] Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn,
[4968] Arrive at fruit dharmata-exhausting pure dhatu—cause.
[4969] Self-vision potency dissolves
[4970] Into three-bodies' awareness mode;
[4971] Awareness pure fruit,
[4972] Originally from awareness dhatu,
[4973] Self-potency three-bodies dawn,
[4974] Called functioning fruit.
[4975] Vehicle other: name also not hear essence;
[4976] Vehicle king: called intent.
[4977] This main-point: difficult to realize, is one.
[4978] Second: extensively explain individual nature, four are:
[4979] Dharmata direct,
[4980] Experience increasing above,
[4981] Awareness measure-arriving,
[4982] Extensively explain dharmata-exhausting vision.
[4983] First, two are:
[4984] General direct connection place,
[4985] Identify self-characteristic.
[4986] First: general direct—conventional term famous direct,
[4987] And ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—two from;
[4988] First: sense-power direct—form etcetera, object five, vision nature,
[4989] And mind direct—object near enjoy, cause certain, conceptuality object in vision,
[4990] And self-awareness direct—within pleasure pain etcetera experience called vision,
[4991] And yogin's direct itself—meaning near meet, actual point enter,
[4992] Particular correct awareness and that vision-object non-dual state,
[4993] Grasp-hold-separate experience certainty.
[4994] From Clear-Meaning:
[4995] Gathering mind from all,
[4996] Inner self unmoving,
[4997] Though abide, eye forms—
[4998] Seeing mind is sense-born.
[4999] Thus explained, like:
[5000] Ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—
[5001] Awareness essence dharmata
[5002] Existing in heart, determine;
[5003] That self-resonance, heart-to-eye connect cause,
[5004] Like sun and light-ray,
[5005] Certain cause-effect, reasoning faith meet.
[5006] That reason: from world and transcend two,
[5007] This is transcend direct.
[5008] Transcend: object-know mind chief,
[5009] Mind cause certain,
[5010] And main-point seal see chief,
[5011] Awareness direct—two from,
[5012] This called awareness direct.
[5013] Second: identify self-characteristic,
[5014] Called dharmata direct vision.
[5015] Apply dharmata word near, four from:
[5016] Samsara dharmas,
[5017] Called this dharmata nirvana dharmata;
[5018] Vision dharmas,
[5019] Called this dharmata empty;
[5020] Dharmas not liberating from non-existing main-point,
[5021] Famous dharmata this dharmata existing liberating certain;
[5022] Dhatu dharmas,
[5023] Awareness dharmata famous,
[5024] Desire non-dual both.
[5025] Direct: actually see existing in sense-power activity field;
[5026] That also: not rely on intellect—
[5027] Intellect wisdom, whatever seek, time not existing to find;
[5028] Seeker not eye-possess,
[5029] Cause not luminous-clear form-possess.
[5030] From Collection:
[5031] Investigate wisdom, aggregates' bottom not find.
[5032] Thus it was said.
[5033] This luminous-clear vision, term-famous, not form-possess—
[5034] Subtle particle and coarse entity,
[5035] Self-characteristic this not existing cause,
[5036] Element-four harm, destroy, crush not possible cause;
[5037] Form-possess: existing destroy crush possible,
[5038] That cause form's characteristic.
[5039] Three enumeration: outer body, speech, mind three,
[5040] Establish base with main-point three.
[5041] Inner: dharmata field main-point;
[5042] Dawn cause: gate main-point;
[5043] Wind abiding: three main-points clear path,
[5044] Secret: habituation measure sequence,
[5045] Ripen: sign sequence,
[5046] Ultimate end: exhaust sequence,
[5047] And take measure with three,
[5048] Supreme vision.
[5049] Ripen: point;
[5050] Complete: body and three fruit complete cause;
[5051] Three group: four determine,
[5052] Therefore called three.
[5053] Or: dharmata three-bodies spontaneous-completion existing,
[5054] Self-resonance vision three,
[5055] Outer dawn number;
[5056] Dharmakaya self-resonance: inner experience awareness-empty;
[5057] Sambhogakaya self-resonance: light five outer clear,
[5058] Wisdom self-clear;
[5059] Nirmanakaya self-resonance: dawn liberation,
[5060] Equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three,
[5061] Rely therefore called three.
[5062] That also: base three establish base,
[5063] Entity not-existing difference main-point,
[5064] And path three clear obstacle,
[5065] Path not-existing near far,
[5066] And measure three deliver measure,
[5067] Not-existing similar different random,
[5068] And fruit three exhaust end deliver,
[5069] Not-existing yes-no doubt,
[5070] Therefore called direct.
[5071] Ordinary time: see three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity,
[5072] Dawn three—pleasure, pain, middle;
[5073] Guru instruction experience take time:
[5074] Direct see three—dhatu, awareness, dharmas.
[5075] Dharmata direct: main-point not-existing add intellect word;
[5076] Habituation time: main-point self-cease delusion vision,
[5077] See three-bodies' light point;
[5078] Measure arrive time: direct see three—clear, empty, pleasure;
[5079] Main-point: dharmata self-exhaust.
[5080] Thus: three enumeration place other rely,
[5081] Determine simultaneous liberate fruit.
[5082] Vision: whatever dawn, dharmata dawn;
[5083] Field: whatever dawn, dhatu dawn;
[5084] Manner: whatever dawn, light, light-house,
[5085] Awareness hanging-cord with dawn.
[5086] Buddha: not-seeing with stone,
[5087] Fruit: take that vision experience.
[5088] Thus: dharmata direct vision essence—
[5089] Dhatu awareness luminous-clear vision.
[5090] From Letterless:
[5091] Direct buddhas without birth,
[5092] See vision pure without field.
[5093] Thus said, and:
[5094] From Illusion:
[5095] Jewel, wish-fulfilling, desire-glory—
[5096] All buddhas' direct.
[5097] Thus it was said.
[5098] Definitive-meaning: see three-bodies' vision.
[5099] From Jewel Heap Tantra:
[5100] Direct called see;
[5101] Three called three-bodies;
[5102] Certain arrival at field realm.
[5103] Thus it was said.
[5104] Purpose: liberate without error obscuration, this main-point.
[5105] That same, from:
[5106] Dharmata direct main-point not existing—
[5107] Similar to going to precipice without eye.
[5108] Thus it was said.
[5109] Main-point from Thalgyur:
[5110] Main-point: arrow not moving;
[5111] Apply three gaze manners this time.
