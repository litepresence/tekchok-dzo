[5802] Arises through purifying the self-essence of great perfection expressive words.
[5803] Through entering the resonance of pure certain freedom of great perfection expressive words,
[5804] Cutting elaboration-free meaning inward.
[5805] Speech going like an earthen jar child emerging from a rock gap,
[5806] Arises through compassion gathering into wisdom-yeshe power.
[5807] Through entering the transformation of speech with meaning exceeding great perfection's speak-think,
[5808] Cutting the end of holding words as very elaboration-free.
[5809] Speech arising like the manner of split rock,
[5810] Arises through letters abiding in channels entering wind bindus.
[5811] Through entering the sound of speech with inexpressible great perfection meaning,
[5812] Arises through leaving, exceeding the object of speech, very elaboration-free.
[5813] Expression arises as inexpressible meaning to example.
[5814] Mind's four signs also, to be known through the four visions and sequence:
[5815] Mind going like caught on a dakini's ear,
[5816] Arises through mixing awareness with luminosity.
[5817] Great perfection hold-free self-free, entering mind's vision,
[5818] Arises through completing elaboration-together empowerment.
[5819] Mind going like a person hit by poison thorns,
[5820] Arises through freeing into the expanse of unborn mind.
[5821] Great perfection unborn self-place free, entering mind's arising place,
[5822] Through completing empowerment of primordially non-existent elaboration.
[5823] Mind going without return basis like a person recovered from fever,
[5824] Arises through catching fully pure mind wind.
[5825] Great perfection primordially free without return basis, entering mind's abiding place,
[5826] Through very elaboration-free self-vision self-freeing.
[5827] Mind going like dying immediately after an arrow hits a person's heart,
[5828] Arises through habituation becoming special.
[5829] Great perfection momentary quick-doing measure, entering mind's life:
[5830] Power of all very elaboration near-ceasing and non-existing.
[5831] This also is faith through example, cutting meaning's connection.
[5832] Moreover, body's basis, arising as the doer of freeing the binding of four elements—
[5833] Now the vital point: impossible for elements to return to self-continuum.
[5834] Speech four: express basis,
[5835] Express condition,
[5836] Express object,
[5837] Express agent—free from the binding of four,
[5838] Now impossible to speak words in self-continuum.
[5839] Mind four:
[5840] Memory,
[5841] No memory,
[5842] Non-arising,
[5843] Mind-exceeding—free from the binding of four,
[5844] Now impossible to enter the wheel of memory-thought object.
[5845] Thus, signs dawning in body,
[5846] Known in essence-speech,
[5847] Confidence correcting mind,
[5848] Measure caught by dream,
[5849] Through diligence sequence:
[5850] Great: completely ceasing dreams,
[5851] Arising through great habituation, no benefit or harm by action and latency.
[5852] Middle: arising through certain habituation of knowing dream as dream,
[5853] No conceptuality of good or bad latency.
[5854] Low: becoming well-abiding in dream through single taste of pure latency, need to avoid cause-effect action of abandoning antidotes.
[5855] Thus the three abidings:
[5856] From the Mu tig phreng:
[5857] Abiding is the pure expanse,
[5858] Thus abiding is awareness essence,
[5859] Abiding are all visions.
[5861] Third, striking nails with three obtains:
[5862] Through obtaining power over outer vision, freeing vision-conditions into field-realms.
[5863] Through obtaining power over inner illusory body, freeing dust together into luminosity.
[5864] Through obtaining power over secret awareness, exhausting wind-mind delusion—
[5865] Called "near to obtaining power over the meaningful result."
[5866] Again from that itself:
[5867] Through awareness dawning, cause-conditions cease;
[5868] Through luminosity dawning, subtle-coarse cease;
[5869] Through expanse-awareness dawning, object-mind cease.
[5871] Fourth, holding measure of freedom through four confidences:
[5872] Confidence without fear or dread, although seeing or hearing the suffering of hot and cold hells;
[5873] Confidence of spontaneous three-kaya completion, without hope or excitement of obtaining, although hearing Buddha qualities;
[5874] Confidence of repeating cause-result, without fear of falling into samsara of delusion-vision, although hearing cause-result of action and affliction;
[5875] Four confidences arise: confidence of obtaining the certain ground of primordially-pure self-completion, without joy of hope for freedom, although seeing nirvana's self-place.
[5876] From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:
[5877] Through four great confidences of unchanging view,
[5878] Also holding the measure of non-returning wisdom.
[5880] Thus, in addition to the four extreme reliances:
[5881] Concluding gathering through sixteen visions:
[5882] Vision,
[5883] Increase,
[5884] Obtain,
[5885] Near obtain—four sets, each entering the four visions,
[5886] Completing the sixteen-ground vision:
[5887] Dharmata manifest vision: increase is eye;
[5888] Near increase: eye's that itself;
[5889] Obtain: seeing nadi;
[5890] Near obtain: obtaining habituation to that.
[5891] Experience increase vision: increase is light;
[5892] Near increase: bindu;
[5893] Obtain: bindu clear as five colors;
[5894] Near obtain: various rays emitting from moving and shifting.
[5895] Measure-arrive vision: increase is body;
[5896] Near increase: vision as father-mother;
[5897] Obtain: possessing five and five heaps;
[5898] Near obtain: mandala complete.
[5899] Exhaust vision: increase not abiding in body and wisdom;
[5900] Near increase: empty without focus;
[5901] Obtain: inexpressible;
[5902] Near obtain: dharmata not established anywhere, like non-existence—sixteen.
[5903] Thus, a person certain in sixteen visions, having obtained the time of ripening self-continuum into wisdom,
[5904] Is called "certain in sixteen visions by protector Vajradhara."
[5905] Thus, the sixteen sequences designated at the ground of cause and result, complete here in freeing as light-body and
[5906] Freeing in the bardo.
[5907] From the Rig pa rang shar:
[5908] "Ground" does not exist separately elsewhere.
[5909] In one person seeing truth, all grounds are complete.
[5910] That also: that person to whom introduction is shown—
[5911] First, at the time of seeing truth, joy arising to that is first ground: Very Joyful.
[5912] Recognizing that as self-vision is
[5913] Second ground: obtaining Stainless.
[5914] Then, habituation to that is
[5915] Third ground: obtaining Light-Doing Ground.
[5916] Then, habituating to that and seeing light-vision is fourth: obtaining Light-Emitting Ground.
[5917] Then, having habituated to seeing wisdom-vision,
[5918] Purifying all afflictions by nature,
[5919] Seeing wisdom is fifth: obtaining Difficult-to-Purify Ground.
[5920] Then, that effulgence body manifesting from light is sixth: obtaining Manifest Ground.
[5921] Then, habituation arriving at the end, afflictions gone far, is seventh: obtaining Far-Going Ground.
[5922] Then, unmoving from that manner is
[5923] Eighth: obtaining Unmoving Ground.
[5924] Then, qualities complete is
[5925] Ninth: obtaining Good Intelligence Ground.
[5926] Then, having caught self-knowing at wisdom-vision, vision dawning naturally,
[5927] Habituating seeing all dharmas like clouds is
[5928] Tenth: obtaining Dharma-Cloud-Like Ground.
[5929] That is obtaining without abandoning this very shell of truth-seeing.
[5930] Those persons who abandon the shell obtain thus.
[5931] Vision ceasing delusion-vision, dawning as heap-vision is eleventh: obtaining All-Light Ground.
[5932] Then, not attaching to that vision also, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas is
[5933] Twelfth: obtaining Non-Attaching Lotus-Possessing Ground.
[5934] Then, from self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner:
[5935] Thirteenth: obtaining Great Collection Wheel of Letters Ground.
[5936] Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is fourteenth: obtaining Great Samadhi Ground.
[5937] Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is fifteenth: obtaining Vajra-Holder Ground.
[5938] Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that, is
[5939] Sixteenth: obtaining Wisdom-Guru Ground.
[5940] Those are applied through similar aspects of vision manner, not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds.
[5941] Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness luminosity without purifying or traversing.
[5942] In meaning, it is one awareness ground.
[5943] For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed,
[5944] For they are applied thus to different entry-doors of path vitals.
[5945] The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and
[5946] Mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification.
[5947] From that itself:
[5948] Therefore, although inconceivable beings exist, there is not more than one wisdom essence.
[5949] "Ground" and "path" do not exist separately.
[5950] Know that there is no need to purify or traverse ground and path.
[5951] From the Kun byed:
[5952] Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified.
[5954] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[5955] Showing the summary of the Luminous Vajra Essence Path, the eighteenth chapter.
[5956] Thus, having shown the actual path,
[5957] Now, regarding the path's difference: for great powers, the supreme means of freeing without meditation—bringing certainty to the secret instruction of cutting (Trekcho)—has three parts:
[5958] Cutting the path through bringing self-essence to the point,
[5959] Binding the summary through cutting connection-words at the point,
[5960] Clearing obstacles through cutting freedom-confidence at the point.
[5961] First has three:
[5962] Bringing certainty to the essence, sky-like, beyond accepting, rejecting, action, and effort in the nature of great perfection.
[5963] Introducing changeless wisdom, direct copper-shining, intention of exhausted dharmas beyond mind.
[5964] Cutting the path to great nameless samsara-nirvana in the manner without binding, freeing, accepting, or rejecting—all primordially transcended in the vast expanse of spontaneous equality.
[5965] First has three:
[5966] General explanation of the meaning, sky-like, without doing, in the nature of great perfection.
[5967] Cutting connection to great root-free emptiness of self-mind, without binding or freeing.
[5968] Vastly pervading the great equality of six aggregates, mirror of mind's object-vision.
[5969] First:
[5970] Great primordially empty, completely empty: all dharmas included by samsara-nirvana, outer vision, inner awareness, middle grasping, holding, vision, and signs.
[5971] Great empty by mind's vision-emptiness.
[5972] Great empty by purity, empty by freedom.
[5973] Not experiencing existence, not experiencing non-existence;
[5974] Not experiencing truth;
[5975] Not experiencing falsehood;
[5976] Not experiencing delusion, not experiencing freedom;
[5977] Not experiencing samsara;
[5978] Not experiencing nirvana;
[5979] Not experiencing "is," not experiencing "is-not";
[5980] Not experiencing vision, not experiencing emptiness.
[5981] All equally vast;
[5982] Pervasion leveled-vast;
[5983] "Is" and "is-not" direction-vast;
[5984] Existence and non-existence vision-vast;
[5985] Unmoving equal-vast;
[5986] Spontaneous-equal primordial-vast;
[5987] Manner-equal basis-vast.
[5988] Vast;
[5989] Leveled;
[5990] Buddha-ed;
[5991] Freed;
[5992] Exhausted;
[5993] Emptied;
[5994] Everywhere-leveled, buddha-ed;
[5995] Pervasively-vast, primordially buddha-ed;
[5996] Spontaneously-equal, expanse buddha-ed;
[5997] Word-vast, equally buddha-ed, unmoving.
[5998] Unmoving;
[5999] Unabiding;
[6000] Untaking;
[6001] Ungoing;
[6002] Uncoming;
[6003] Unthinking;
[6004] Unconceptualizing;
[6005] Unobserving;
[6006] Unequaling;
[6007] Unchanging.
[6008] Before: not experiencing delusion;
[6009] Now: not abiding in delusion;
[6010] End: delusion impossible.
[6011] Before: not experiencing freedom;
[6012] Now: not entering freedom;
[6013] End: freedom impossible.
[6014] Before: no transcendence;
[6015] Now: no abiding;
[6016] Future: no arising.
[6017] Limitless, leveled-buddha, empty;
[6018] Abiding-manner basis non-existent;
[6019] Is-manner path non-existent;
[6020] Free-manner result non-existent.
[6021] View-meditation name non-existent;
[6022] Direction-limit dharma non-existent;
[6023] Existence-non-existence end non-existent;
[6024] Sky-expanse non-existent.
[6025] Primordially buddha-ed, beyond action-effort;
[6026] Vastly buddha-ed, beyond view-meditation.
[6027] Freely buddha-ed, beyond reference and thought;
[6028] Cutting the path to nameless buddhahood everywhere, in all directions.
[6029] Nothing to look at, nothing looked at;
[6030] No viewer;
[6031] Not seen by looking.
[6032] Nothing to meditate;
[6033] Nothing meditated;
[6034] Beyond meditation;
[6035] Not freed by meditating.
[6036] Nothing to analyze;
[6037] Nothing analyzing;
[6038] No need to analyze;
[6039] Analyzing is useless effort.
[6040] No need to accomplish;
[6041] Already accomplished;
[6042] Nothing to accomplish;
[6043] Not accomplished by accomplishing;
[6044] No need for accomplishment.
[6045] Nothing to do;
[6046] No doer;
[6047] Already done;
[6048] Beyond doing;
[6049] Doing also limited;
[6050] No need to do;
[6051] Nothing to do to dharma;
[6052] Doing is not dharma;
[6053] Not-doing: nothing to accomplish.
[6054] Not abandoning samsara;
[6055] Not taking nirvana;
[6056] Accomplishment: direction placed.
[6057] Primordially equal, leveled-vast, original, nameless.
[6058] Whatever vision, abiding as primordially buddha-ed without basis from the ground—bind-free effort self-ceases.
[6059] Whatever dawn, everywhere limitlessly level-placed, primordially pure, self-empty, vastly.
[6060] Whatever buddha-ed, interior vastness of self-mind without doing, effort ceasing everywhere without equal level, abiding as primordially empty and self-pure without trace.
[6061] Applying scripture to the meaning realized by oneself—all dharmas primordially self-dawning in the abide-manner of great perfection nature.
[6062] From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:
[6063] The nature of great perfection:
[6064] All meanings enter the center of mind;
[6065] Non-vision, objectless, without conceptuality,
[6066] Uncut, naturally cutting at self-ground.
[6067] Non-awareness of not experiencing delusion severed,
[6068] Unexamined, primordially cutting, abiding.
[6069] Above, who has not felt all this?
[6070] All these coarse elements also,
[6071] Naturally ceasing from the first,
[6072] Without place to go, naturally going,
[6073] Self-body primordially non-existent,
[6074] Known here without before or after.
[6075] All this, timeless, vastly timed,
[6076] By one, two, and six-three:
[6077] Non-vision, vision, and half-vision,
[6078] In self-sound of non-vision doing,
[6079] Exceeding ground-holding ground.
[6080] Who has not felt primordial abiding?
[6081] Path without primordial traverse,
[6082] This path primordially near,
[6083] This also primordially abiding from self,
[6084] Not seen before—dull self-knowing.
[6085] Intention of non-abiding samadhi:
[6086] Primordially abiding without meditation.
[6087] This also: who did not know before?
[6088] The object of attachment to self and grasping:
[6089] From the very first, in dharmata,
[6090] All this self-vision by self—
[6091] Not knowing primordial vision before.
[6092] Five afflictions binding self-concept,
[6093] Primordially self-dawning awareness,
[6094] Abiding together, faces not meeting.
[6095] Four elements—earth, water, fire, wind—
[6096] Primordially self-body,
[6097] Dull eye of whoever has not seen.
[6098] Very secret gathering place, speech-essence,
[6099] Self-sounding without interval.
[6100] Whoever has not heard this itself—
[6101] Does ear-power not exist?
[6102] Self-abiding expanse and awareness-scent,
[6103] Self-samsara without occasion to separate.
[6104] Nose ceased from not experiencing feeling?
[6105] Three essences, one coiled instruction-taste,
[6106] Primordially body-mind essence—
[6107] Tongue cut from not experiencing this?
[6108] Self-pure vision, color-ornament,
[6109] Without separating from self-body,
[6110] Like body and shadow,
[6111] Abiding without day or night.
[6112] Inert body, untouched by anyone?
[6113] Dharma of bliss striking suffering everywhere,
[6114] Self-abiding without forgetting.
[6115] Dull mind of whoever has not known.
[6116] Piling again the latencies of samsara,
[6117] Primordially abiding as dharmakaya—
[6118] The place of compassion, unseen by whoever.
[6119] From self-concept object's dawning at powers,
[6120] Various memories, thoughts, and movements,
[6121] Primordially self-dawning as Sambhogakaya—
[6122] Worried forgetting, not remembering all this.
[6123] Do, doer, conduct, effort, accomplishment, and
[6124] All noise of gathered beings
[6125] Primordially as emanation body—
[6126] Dull capability of whoever has not known.
[6127] How thoughts and memories move,
[6128] Like a river's flow, without interval,
[6129] Always attracting self-mind.
[6130] Effortless self-place meditation—
[6131] Straying mind, not understanding experience.
[6132] This vision hearing existing container-contents,
[6133] Although natureless through examination,
[6134] Like cutting the continuum of village-city,
[6135] Not seeing primordial abiding.
[6136] Doors of powers closed?
[6138] From the Thal 'gyur:
[6139] This nature of delusion-vision—
[6140] Not seen before as wisdom,
[6141] From basis of delusion with concept not existing,
[6142] Realizing all-ground as great dharmakaya,
[6143] Delusion's self-concept continuum ceases.
[6144] Thus, non-deluded vision
[6145] Arises from the split vital point primordially.
[6146] Buddha-body of beings' aggregates,
[6147] Primordially existing—who did not know?
[6148] Aggregates as Buddha-lord,
[6149] Arising from letters abiding in channels.
[6150] Wisdom in bubbles and eyes—
[6151] Who has not seen as self-vision?
[6153] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[6154] Regarding nature-vision dharmas:
[6155] Subtle and coarse reversed through non-defilement;
[6156] Delusion reversed through non-grasping-holding;
[6157] Action-wind reversed through non-movement;
[6158] Entity reversed through copper-shining;
[6159] Emptiness reversed through clarity;
[6160] Generation stage reversed through primordial realization;
[6161] Conduct reversed through non-effort;
[6162] Meditation reversed through non-seeking placement;
[6163] Vision reversed through self-freedom;
[6164] View reversed through manifest vision;
[6165] Terms reversed through non-sound-words;
[6166] Attachment reversed through not experiencing existence;
[6167] Other-dependence reversed through not experiencing non-existence;
[6168] Mental examination reversed through non-grasping;
[6169] Number-end reversed through uniqueness;
[6170] Other arising and ceasing through all-pervading.
[6171] Darkness buddha-ed through self-dawning;
[6172] Dharmakaya pervading through essence;
[6173] Sambhogakaya expanding through clear vision;
[6174] Emanation body arising through mother-child meeting;
[6175] Method arising through existent realization;
[6176] Memory buddha-ed through thought-exceeding;
[6177] Establishment view complete through non-eternal-cut.
[6179] Again:
[6180] Exceeding ground, direction, and limit;
[6181] Non-existent existence, non-existence, and like-vision;
[6182] Not activity-field of all sounds and measures;
[6183] No field of counting one, two.
[6184] Accomplished by descending into great emptiness;
[6185] Not activity-field of scripture and reason;
[6186] Not indicated by tantra and instruction.
[6187] Through view, meditation, and conduct,
[6188] That meaning will not be known.
[6189] That meaning: no accomplishment as result;
[6190] Dharmas obscure that itself.
[6191] Not accomplished by thinking;
[6192] Not to be examined even by wisdom.
[6193] Through giving, ethics, and patience,
[6194] That itself separate from harm-benefit result.
[6195] Through hearing, thinking, and meditation,
[6196] Not seeing that, even examining supreme.
[6197] No mandala therein;
[6198] No deity, no generation seed;
[6199] What to do with mantra and mudra?
[6200] No need to elaborate offerings, etc.;
[6201] Where are power and vow?
[6202] No approach or accomplishment;
[6203] No wheel emanation;
[6204] No protection, no protectable field;
[6205] Exceeding harm and obstacle fields.
