[6549] Great bliss liberation's doctrine finding-time not-exists—
[6550] Like boat sinking, entering water.
[6551] Non-existent mind's existing-support itself deceives and binds—thus said.
[6552] From Samantabhadra's Heart Mirror:
[6553] "Desiring appearance as dharmakaya is obstruction to me."
[6554] "Desiring whatever-appears as mind is obstruction to me."
[6555] "Desiring self-arising as other is obstruction to me."
[6556] Thus said.
[6557] Then: does "mind dissolving" mean existing becomes non-existent?
[6558] Dissolving: as before, unestablished through examination;
[6559] Even unexamined, from sudden memory-thoughts' thought dissolving,
[6560] Mind's self-continuum does not go from existence to non-existence.
[6561] Dissolve-cause and dissolve-condition nowhere exist.
[6562] Then: is destroying mind's house purposeless, since nothing to destroy?
[6563] To primordially non-existent mind,
[6564] Only making realize non-existent nature—
[6565] Not that mind's house's basis or entity exists.
[6566] Memory's source having gone to dharmata,
[6567] Making understand non-existence,
[6568] Conventionally called "destroying house."
[6569] Destroying the existent—nothing whatsoever.
[6570] Therefore, placing above whatever-appears object-vital-point of appearance—the so-called "term's result"—
[6571] Inert appearance without grasping there, result of non-dual object-mind;
[6572] Placing above whatever-knowing moves,
[6573] Mind's house self-destroying, movement-thought-liberated result;
[6574] Thus, identifying non-dual inert-knowing union wisdom's dissolving place, non-existent result.
[6575] Thus, result-three's times also upon four vital-points of dissolving-time facing-introduction,
[6576] Know sixteen non-existent dharmas as before.
[6577] This also: from Great Secret Certain Heart-Essence's Cutting-Through—mind primordially non-existent, self-liberated;
[6578] Movement sudden, primordially liberated;
[6579] Instruction other and mind ultimately non-existent;
[6580] Pretending conventionally existent.
[6581] Two: making path through view and meditation upon mind.
[6582] Though merely self-liberating, self-dawning, self-placing may seem discordant,
[6583] The meaning is not discordant:
[6584] Here, making primordially non-existent, and
[6585] Elsewhere desiring non-existence of the existent—thus.
[6586] Also union:
[6587] Desiring union where two existents connect one-to-one elsewhere, and
[6588] Here, no cause to enter union through primordial non-existence,
[6589] Non-existent essence having no different distinction—two not different, thus called "non-dual union."
[6590] This vital point, most crucial among all vehicles, extremely important and crucial:
[6591] From this, not desiring appearance as mind, and
[6592] Showing the great basis of buddhahood not experienced as existent mind.
[6593] Depending on this, face-introducing appearance as mind, and
[6594] Face-introducing mind itself as empty—know this as Heart Essence instruction intention.
[6595] If some instructions thus arise possibly, decide they are merely provisional below, not definitive meaning.
[6596] Third: objects appearing in mind's mirror dawning, aggregates six pervading expansive great equality:
[6597] Outer various appearances,
[6598] Inner sudden memory-thoughts,
[6599] All powers six appearances with objects,
[6600] Merely clear appearance of non-existence.
[6601] In meaning, nowhere outer-inner, like cataract-hairlines,
[6602] Illusion,
[6603] Eye-magic,
[6604] Emanation—appearing in mind although,
[6605] Know transcending exist-not-exist extremes from the very time of appearing.
[6606] From appearance's side, however designated, not contradictory;
[6607] Allow "is,"
[6608] Allow "is not,"
[6609] Allow "exists,"
[6610] Allow "not exists,"
[6611] Allow "appears,"
[6612] Allow "empty,"
[6613] Allow "deluded,"
[6614] Allow "liberated,"
[6615] Allow "good,"
[6616] Allow "bad,"
[6617] Allow "mind,"
[6618] Allow "other"—
[6619] However designated,
[6620] From empty's side, empty first by that itself which designates.
[6621] Designation is mind,
[6622] Mind is non-existent,
[6623] Like dream actions and illusion actions—no maker for non-existence.
[6625] Virtue, non-virtue, etc.—that itself sudden.
[6626] That essence: basisless, self-liberated.
[6627] Awareness's primordial tone exists in part—if identified, intention's dharmata direction has nowhere else to grasp.
[6628] All appearance-existence samsara-nirvana dharmas—great appearance of clear appearance of non-existence in awareness's nature, self-dawning, self-appearing:
[6629] Like four elements' appearances dwelling in sky's nature,
[6630] Like various dreams and sleep,
[6631] Not moving from sleep-awareness's nature.
[6632] Although all self-appear in awareness's nature,
[6633] Awareness does not see delusion-appearance samsara,
[6634] Does not see pure appearance transcended,
[6635] Samsara-nirvana does not see awareness.
[6636] All, unmoving in basisless great equal nature,
[6637] Transcending seer and seen through non-establishment of essence,
[6638] Dawning from awareness's nature—merely designated "samsara-nirvana awareness's self-tone or play."
[6639] Great liberation from exist-not-exist extremes,
[6640] Designation not contradictory,
[6641] Not established in meaning.
[6642] All appearance-existence samsara-nirvana dharmas dawn as merely clear appearance of non-existence.
[6643] From Space Six:
[6644] "To mind itself without stain,
[6645] Appearance separate from object-conditions
[6646] Is called 'great self-pure intention'—
[6647] Samantabhadra I have shown."
[6649] From Jewel Display:
[6650] "Entity of complete non-existence,
[6651] Not falling in any direction,
[6652] Entity of whatever delusion—
[6653] Merely appearing as harmonious appearance,
[6654] Yet that meaning does not arise,
[6655] Appearance like dharmadhatu ornament.
[6657] Great emptiness wisdom
[6658] Deludes from complete non-existence—"
[6660] From Pearl Garland:
[6661] "That is I, that is beings,
[6662] That is mind, arisen from mind,
[6663] Not many, singularly one,
[6664] Samsara-nirvana is myself,
[6665] Mandalas etc. are gradual entry,
[6666] Dharmas, appearing as dharmas,
[6667] Abiding, moving,
[6668] Sitting, sleeping, lying,
[6669] Life, also cutting,
[6670] Three worlds arise from that.
[6671] Briefly: as appears,
[6672] All dharmas arise from that—
[6673] Earth, water, fire, wind, space,
[6674] Great elements arise from that."
[6676] Thus to dwelling dharmata:
[6677] Delusion not-existing from the beginning,
[6678] In dharmakaya like sky,
[6679] Obscured by sudden beings' clouds.
[6680] Also non-deluded dwelling dharmata
[6681] Appears in mind as deluded manner.
[6683] Beings' five afflictions themselves:
[6684] In meaning, they do not exist—
[6685] Like clouds in sky,
[6686] Sudden, with conditions,
[6687] Clouds arise from sky itself.
[6688] Knowing thus dissolve into sky,
[6689] Called "non-different one nature."
[6690] Thus afflictions' stains themselves,
[6691] Knowing self-arising, self-ceasing,
[6692] How could beings be bound?
[6694] Appearance-manner unestablished like
[6695] Appearing as grasping, yet nowhere established—
[6696] Shown also as great placelessness.
[6697] From Heap of Jewels:
[6698] "This mind itself without dwelling place,
[6699] Without going place, wondrous!
[6700] To six minds entering all,
[6701] Without depending place, wondrous!
[6702] To all-gathering all-ground,
[6703] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6704] To circling-deluding ignorance,
[6705] Without changing power, wondrous!
[6706] To all object-attaching afflictions,
[6707] Without basis-root, wondrous!
[6708] To subtle and coarse stains,
[6709] Without grasping place, wondrous!
[6710] To coarse elemental forms,
[6711] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6712] To person's depending life-breath,
[6713] Without time-setting, wondrous!
[6714] To six aggregates' object appearances,
[6715] Without permanence, wondrous!
[6716] To person's arisen memory-thought feelings,
[6717] Without exhaustion, wondrous!"
[6720] "This basisless dharmata—
[6721] Great wonder, placed without searching!
[6722] To going-coming awareness—
[6723] Great wonder, without end!
[6724] To primordially dwelling great wisdom—
[6725] Great wonder, without antidote!"
[6727] Also from Arya Samadhi Raja, common vehicle:
[6728] "How in mid-space, little cloudless,
[6729] Momentarily cloud mandala appears,
[6730] Arising-ceasing, that cloud mandala—
[6731] Examine from what first it arose!
[6732] Know all dharmas thus.
[6733] How person dwells in rock mountain hollow,
[6734] From singing, speaking, laughing, crying,
[6735] Echoes arise depending on conditions,
[6736] Yet that tone from sound never moves.
[6737] Know all dharmas thus."
[6738] Extensively said.
[6739] Second meaning: face-introducing foundation primordial wisdom without move-change, copper-shining dharma-exhaust mind-transcend intention—three:
[6740] Direct face-introduction of copper-shining awareness through dharma-exhaustion and mind-transcendence:
[6741] Maintain the intention of self-clear nature-abiding in great pervasion-expansion,
[6742] Place the three vital points of dharmata's wheel in the great sky-equal space-clarity.
[6743] First:
[6744] Just place self-settled awareness in self-clarity,
[6745] Not sending outward,
[6746] Not gathering inward,
[6747] Look at self-nature without thinking in-between—
[6748] Outer, inner, and middle: non-existent;
[6749] Self-clear foundation:
[6750] Dharmakaya not confused by view-meditation,
[6751] Primordial wisdom not moved by concepts,
[6752] Intention not fabricated by elaboration-gathering;
[6753] In clarity: thought non-existent;
[6754] In abiding: grasping non-existent;
[6755] In vastness: losing non-existent;
[6756] In equality: interval non-existent.
[6757] Great self-tone without entering-maker;
[6758] Great great intention self-settled from primordial time:
[6759] Tone and empty like ocean,
[6760] Clear and pure like sun and moon,
[6761] Vast and pervading like sky,
[6762] Stable and abiding like king of mountains.
[6763] This meaning and all beings: though existing primordially in self, not experiencing separation even for a moment,
[6764] Yet through face-not-knowing, mixed in samsara by bad thought elaborations—
[6765] Now, through lama's instruction identifying, whether dawning or dwelling or whatever, just as face-introduction to self-settled place nature, make only nature-not-wandering.
[6766] From Lion Perfection:
[6767] E ma: path that lion crosses not;
[6768] Lion of action-effort non-existent:
[6769] To white snow of release-place non-existent,
[6770] Powers three of cleared darkness perfect.
[6771] I, lion of thought-non-existent tone:
[6772] To good snow of primordial purity, stain-not,
[6773] Powers three of cleared element perfect.
[6774] Thus said, and:
[6775] From Six Spaces:
[6776] To mind-itself of permanent-cease non-existent:
[6777] Appearance of separation from good-bad:
[6778] Intention of separation from abandon-accept—
[6779] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6780] To mind-itself of accept-reject non-existent:
[6781] Appearance of self-liberation direction-non-existent—
[6782] Intention of great pervasion-expansion—
[6783] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6784] To mind-itself of dull-excitement non-existent:
[6785] Meditation of great release-equal—
[6786] Intention of six aggregates spontaneous—
[6787] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6788] To mind-itself of concern non-existent:
[6789] Appearance of separation from hope-doubt—
[6790] Intention of primordial place, confidence-possessing—
[6791] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6792] Thus said.
[6793] From Perfection:
[6794] This dharma-nature, entity-separate, grasping-attachment non-existent—
[6795] Buddhas' intention dharma of non-duality;
[6796] Particular emptiness and signs' word path,
[6797] Dharma-nature of action-effort non-existent, pure in self-place;
[6798] Complete samadhi, entering from dharma-nature object.
[6799] Pure and impure: term dharmas non-existent;
[6800] Meaning primordially dwelling, transcending one and two;
[6801] Self-body in nature, entering single bindu;
[6802] Time non-existent realization: samadhi not-wandering clear;
[6803] Extreme and center non-existent: dharma-nature name-separate;
[6804] Change not: straight, pervading all;
[6805] Made not: spontaneously accomplished in arising place.
[6806] Thus it is said.
[6807] Second: maintaining that nature has three:
[6808] Maintaining view-meditation object-transcending great,
[6809] Maintaining samadhi self-settled great,
[6810] Maintaining intention mind-transcending great.
[6811] First:
[6812] In that face-introduction nature, without mind-grasping effort and purpose-meditation antidote entering—place awareness vast wide, primordially placed, height-top vast, interval non-existent, self-liberated.
[6813] From Jewel Display:
[6814] Vast: dharma-nature completely pure;
[6815] Great: view wonderful great;
[6816] Appearance face: mandala self-appearance itself;
[6817] Object and object-non-existent: completely pure;
[6818] Outer and inner non-existent: completely appear;
[6819] Empty and not-empty: transcending words.
[6820] Thus said, and:
[6821] From Lion Perfection:
[6822] To whatever place the first place is,
[6823] The last goes to that place;
[6824] Now: dwell in that meaning.
[6825] Thus said, and:
[6826] Also:
[6827] In sky of grasping-thought non-existent,
[6828] In sky of consciousness non-existent—
[6829] Consciousness mind unmoved:
[6830] Supreme samadhi of non-wandering,
[6831] Single Buddha grove manner.
[6832] Thus it is said.
[6833] Second has three:
[6834] Self-dwelling just-place:
[6835] Without making grasping-elaboration on aggregate-object appearance, outer-inner-middle non-existent, wide, self-liberated, vast place—
[6836] Even when going to sleep, sleeping in that nature, dreams dawn in clear light.
[6837] Great thunder is:
[6838] Identifying the nature: three doors spontaneously released, whatever dawns suddenly hit, self-liberated, vast vast gone.
[6839] Appearance expansion:
[6840] Body cross-legged, eyes staring at interval appearance,
[6841] Cut mind's sending-gathering, identify half-pure awareness nature—bind five winds to space,
[6842] Self-appearance pure clear light: outer smoke, mirage, rainbow light, etc., and inner dharma-nature empty clear appearance pure like dawn.
[6843] From Six Spaces:
[6844] Train thus in three samadhis:
[6845] Self-dwelling just-place samadhi:
[6846] Not stopping power doors,
[6847] Not using body actions,
[6848] Not abandoning sleep,
[6849] Not cutting apart with mind—
[6850] Brief: body speech in self-place,
[6851] Mind-arising parts outward not lost;
[6852] To power objects six,
[6853] Know-awareness action: mind unmoved;
[6854] To self-appearance not-thinking great,
[6855] Clear thought-non-existent: experience arises.
[6856] Great thunder samadhi:
[6857] Body from ordinary like,
[6858] Speech separate from spoken words,
[6859] Mind not bound tight,
[6860] Self-dawn to self: not wandering.
[6861] Appearance expand samadhi:
[6862] By body and object and awareness,
[6863] Grasp all pure self-appearance measures.
[6864] Thus it is said.
[6865] Third: maintaining intention mind-transcending has four:
[6866] Mountain just-place view,
[6867] Ocean just-place intention,
[6868] Awareness just-place instruction,
[6869] Appearance just-place method.
[6870] First:
[6871] Identify this self-clear awareness, whatever dawns—place in nature without move-change like mountain king view.
[6872] From Letter Non-Existent:
[6873] Mountain just-place view: secret itself;
[6874] Not doubt: change by nature non-existent.
[6875] Thus it is said.
[6876] Second:
[6877] Body cross-legged,
[6878] Eyes ha-re placed at interval appearance,
[6879] Clear place in nature like ocean unmoved by waves—half-pure consciousness.
[6880] From That Itself:
[6881] The intention of ocean just-place:
[6882] Not appearance, yet makes appear;
[6883] Not empty, yet not existent as empty;
[6884] Not clear, yet object of great clarity;
[6885] Not dull, excitement by nature non-existent.
[6886] Unmoved, immovable, not becoming moved;
[6887] Unstirred, not stirring, transcending all stirring—
[6888] See great method of place: not arisen by making;
[6889] Nature of just-place one: not making send-gather.
[6890] Not dwelling: no transcendence from that;
[6891] To ocean-like secret primordial wisdom,
[6892] Primordially spontaneously vast: unmoved, place in space.
[6893] From great ocean depth difficult to measure,
[6894] See peak of victory banner never setting;
[6895] Empty mind non-existent: great body not made,
[6896] By non-making conquer all making;
[6897] Just-place itself: primordially unarisen, unmade,
[6898] Appearance unchanged: not made by mind.
[6899] Dharma-nature dwell in sky: intention shown;
[6900] Dharmakaya primordial wisdom: completely abandon thought;
[6901] If no move-make: intention of meditation.
[6902] If not grasping appear-object and focus-direction,
[6903] Like planet-star dawning in ocean depth—
[6904] Grasping not on object, clear part not ceasing:
[6905] Thus is self-arisen intention dwell manner.
[6906] Thus it is said.
[6907] Third:
[6908] Identify wide wide wide self-clear foundation naked burst of clear-empty awareness primordial wisdom—cut samadhi mind-attachment mistake place, copper-shining foundation dharmakaya dawns from within.
[6909] From Lion Perfection: looking outward to many self-know objects—
[6910] Great thought-non-existent dharmakaya found within.
[6911] Thus it is said.
[6912] Fourth:
[6913] When widely looking at outer five-object appearance, place in nature of clear clear foundation self-clear dawning from within.
[6914] From That Itself:
[6915] Looking outward to awareness-clear dharmata object—
[6916] See inside awareness of separation from various.
[6917] Thus said, and:
[6918] From Letter Non-Existent:
[6919] Great method of appearance just-place awareness:
[6920] Appearance great: not basis of all;
[6921] Appear like five element Buddhas' path;
[6922] Five greats: mother itself clear as appearance;
[6923] In not-wandering nature: place great grasping-non-existent.
[6924] Thus it is said.
[6925] Third: placing three vital points of dharmata's wheel in great sky-equal space-clarity has three:
[6926] Instruction placing mind itself action-separate by nature of dharmata's separation from effort-exertion;
[6927] Instruction concepts dawning as primordial wisdom by vital point of dharmata's self-direct introduction;
[6928] Instruction appearance non-existent refute-establish by vital point of dharmata's liberation from self-place.
[6929] First:
[6930] That nature separate from action: not realized by action, realized by non-action place—place three doors self-settled vast.
[6931] From Thalgyur:
[6932] Also other action-separate dharmata:
[6933] Liberate-to liberate by action non-existent.
[6934] Thus said, and:
[6935] From Great Garuda:
[6936] Therefore if samsara-nirvana action-action itself separate,
[6937] What other doing exists from this great perfection?
[6938] Thus said, and:
[6939] From Six Objects:
[6940] Basis place by separating from action.
[6941] Second:
[6942] Face-introduce appearance as mind's play;
[6943] Face-introduce play basis-non-existent clear appearance;
[6944] Face-introduce as delusion if grasp clear appearance;
[6945] Face-introduce self-clear non-existent appearance by non-grasping—decide outer object appearance and mind other-to non-established, empty object of samsara birth.
[6946] Also face-introduce appearance-grasping mind that basis-non-existent;
[6947] Face-introduce basis-non-existent empty self-course;
[6948] Face-introduce self-course track-non-existent primordially liberated—
[6949] Circle-maker self-mind liberated basis-non-existent, echo in three realms name-non-existent dharmata.
[6950] From Perfection:
[6951] Nature dharma-nature peace: perception object-to non-existent;
[6952] Entity non-existent itself: appearance self-search self-appearance;
[6953] Self meaning dharma-nature: appearance mind separate;
[6954] Look self object: not making send-gather.
[6955] Thus it is said.
[6956] Here some face-introduce appearance to mind.
[6957] Face-introduce mind to empty, and
[6958] From decorated face-introduction:
[6959] E ma ho: by face-introducing appearance to mind, complete to mind;
[6960] By face-introducing mind itself to empty, spread happiness to empty;
[6961] By face-introducing empty to awareness—
[6962] That only dharmakaya, awareness itself and space non-dual, appears to attach words to meaning self-characteristic.
[6963] This has intended basis,
[6964] Need purpose,
[6965] Actually harm-making valid cognition—three exist, not approaching heart-essence intention direction.
[6966] Intended basis:
[6967] For provisional purpose of grasping outer object meaning not other-to, those words said;
[6968] From Self-Arising:
[6969] Sometimes show appearance to mind.
[6970] Thus it is said.
[6971] That also: designate from only appearance to deluded mind, appearance not other-to.
[6972] Need purpose: only abandon attachment to outer objects.
[6973] Actually harm-making:
[6974] If appearance is mind, mind would be certain color shape etc. by eye etc. powers, for appearance certain as form etc. shape and color; and
[6975] Appearance mind,
[6976] Mind empty,
[6977] Empty awareness—if these three, from mutual mixing:
[6978] Conclude awareness to delusion, and
[6979] Conclude appearance not seen by eye etc., and
[6980] Conclude mind not deluded—
[6981] For these three essence substance one.
[6982] This distinction explained in detail before, and
[6983] Not liberating by making appearance mind yoga,
[6984] From Self-Arising:
[6985] Appearance mind yoga:
[6986] All arise from my mind;
[6987] What doing exists if mind itself realized?
[6988] All expressing that word—
[6989] I said not liberated.
[6990] By that scripture also harm, and
[6991] Conclude appearance non-existent when realizing mind non-existent;
[6992] From conclude appearance ceasing at time mind ceases,
[6993] Also harm from appearance existing at mind non-existent occasion.
[6994] To mind non-existent occasion: five exist.
[6995] From Middle Extremes:
[6996] Mind non-existent: sleep and faint,
[6997] Absorption entering: two,
[6998] Always perception non-existent.
[6999] Thus it is said.
[7000] Briefly gathered:
[7001] This desiring appearance as mind—great darkness of wrong thought—needs clearing.
[7002] Third: instruction appearance non-existent refute-establish by vital point of dharmata self-place liberated:
[7003] Outer five objects non-existent empty self-pure like water moon: purify not needed;
[7004] Inner mind memory thought self-dissolve track-non-existent: destroy not by effort exertion two antidotes;
[7005] Appearance mind primordially liberated spontaneous: abandon-accept superimpose not needed.
[7006] To naked copper-shining awareness: not putting elaboration garment, complete complete complete, track-non-existent equal great, releasing inside—
[7007] Enter freeing to self-arisen primordial tone of five doors.
[7008] That also: burst awareness foundation naked, self-clear essence inner,
[7009] From that nature: know as self-tone of self-arisen primordial wisdom, distinguish-non-existent whatever dawns of memory thought good bad, not follow track.
[7010] Appearance mind rough not rough,
[7011] Clear not clear,
[7012] In this that manner, releasing to vast pervasion—self-dawn in Samantabhadra's intention space.
[7013] From Six Spaces:
[7014] Great self-appearance of all beings;
[7015] Place not existent for search from other;
