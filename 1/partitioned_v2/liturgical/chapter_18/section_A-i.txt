[13149] That time son-of-family, you-of body stabilize.
[13150] Speech stabilize.
[13151] Mind stabilize do.
[13152] Awareness stabilize do.
[13153] That-by birth not-exist become.
[13154] Thus path show, thus spoken as say, and
[13155] Dedicate, and
[13156] Aspire, and
[13157] Auspicious say, karma conclude.
[13158] This ritual, to disciples belonging to this Nature Great Perfection, specially spoke,
[13159] Secret mantra common clearly taught seven-sections-from more deep and superior, therefore this dharma's vajra masters, by those tradition obtain please.
[13160] Eighth: common not-is, realm other show, two are:
[13161] Yogin's death-manner general show, and
[13162] Elements dissolve manner difference explain.
[13163] First: faculties inferior, middle, and superior become, death-manner three-from.
[13164] Inferior: like above taught, accord with world, die.
[13165] Sick time also diviner and
[13166] Doctor and
[13167] Service various do: supreme dharma truth characteristics not-see sign is, and
[13168] Divination, ritual, medicine, astrology hope: tirthika and difference not.
[13169] Then die time also: relatives, circle students, friends surround, die.
[13170] Die after also: virtue, grief, lament do, and
[13171] Seven-sections, corpse cremate etcetera do is.
[13172] Karma first-of ordinary those-of death-manner from,
[13173] Dharma part even not-exist: ordinary those and same.
[13174] Middle and superior those thus examine,
[13175] Thus not-die if, meaning-of yogin not-is.
[13176] That-to: deer and
[13177] Lion and
[13178] Beggar and
[13179] Child like die four: yogin middle-of death-manner.
[13180] Condition without die like attached, those solitude-to die.
[13181] Example: deer kill, that human not-go cave or
[13182] Valley empty or
[13183] Forest edge or
[13184] Wilderness hermitage-to die like.
[13185] Yogin that, anyone see not, die: any-to fear from free sign is.
[13186] Beggar like die is:
[13187] Example beggar who is distinction not, hole or
[13188] Market street or crossroads or shop etcetera-to die like.
[13189] Yogin that also thus die: realm attachment cease, dharma sphere use sign is.
[13190] Also child, all die not-die distinction not state-to die like.
[13191] Yogin that also delusion some-from calculate not,
[13192] Die condition and die place and die to fear and not-die joy also not: ordinary just pass like die, delusion appearance cease sign is.
[13193] Superior those-of death-manner is:
[13194] Sky-goer and
[13195] Knowledge-holder and
[13196] Fire-heap and
[13197] Sky like death-manner four-from.
[13198] Yogin diligence superior, this same aggregates not-exist depart: sky-goer die time, corpse anyone not-see and same,
[13199] Bardo not-exist buddha sign.
[13200] Yogin supreme one, other teach purpose-to, people all see, space light-heap center-in sound and light include vanish is.
[13201] Knowledge-holder those, realm above-from above-to leap time, aggregates include space-to sound and light include, all see go like.
[13202] Continent thought-not-pervade, emanation thought-not-pervade-by benefit do sign:
[13203] Great Yogin Power Lord Lhetsun Lion-Power like.
[13204] Yogin practice end reach death-manner is:
[13205] Example: cause fuel-wood finish-by, fire-heap great exist those also, self finish-from die like.
[13206] Cause elements finish-by, condition aggregates lump not-exist go: afflictions self-from liberate sign is.
[13207] Example: Tsari holy Dgyer Mi Majo two, cave-from light-heap-to blaze, space-to go like.
[13208] Yogin primordial-pure realm, dust particle body-of vase break time, before-after not, one-in mix is:
[13209] Sky like death-manner.
[13210] Body appear-of interval, substance separate cut space and like:
[13211] Realization primordial-pure, body within heart-of light-clear abide, and
[13212] Pot break-by, outer space and pot-of space mix, which is not-know like.
[13213] Body dust particle departed aggregates this is, and that within awareness this is, not-know buddha.
[13214] This primordial-pure realm sudden-through liberate sign.
[13215] That-to: sky and sky-goer death-manner two, body dust particle departed, primordial-pure break-through liberate death-manner is, and
[13216] Fire-heap and knowledge-holder two, leap-through spontaneous liberate death-manner.
[13217] Death-manner thus who-from arise:
[13218] Nature Great Perfection faith sign: common tradition year not-enter, and
[13219] That same meaning enter sign: direct meaning see-by, intellect word purpose not-depend, and
[13220] Primordial-pure realization enter-by, self-of next migration place which is, face know, and
[13221] Die to difficulty and fear not: life accomplish and die deceive service any not do, and.
[13222] Natural-state action-effort from free confidence obtain-by, door three-of action any not do, and
[13223] All basis not-exist primordial-emptiness great realize-by, any-to entity characteristics-grasp from free, nature-of state-from moment even not-separate meaning vast-expanse from arise.
[13224] Thus yogin those-to death examine and
[13225] Deceive and
[13226] Clarify not need.
[13227] View-meditation from surpass, dharma-by benefit-harm not, and
[13228] Self-appear primordial-pure and spontaneous arise-by, liberation place self-nature as appear.
[13229] Spontaneous primordial-pure expanse-into dissolve-from liberate, because.
[13230] Thus also
[13231] From Sun-Moon Face-Union,
[13232] Yogin this thus examine:
[13233] Inferior faculty inferior is,
[13234] Existence bardo-to spread continue.
[13235] Example rooster-cut like.
[13236] Like-that faculty middle those:
[13237] Deer like death-manner is
[13238] Yogin death-manner.
[13239] Like-that lion like and
[13240] Who beggar like and
[13241] Like-that child like die:
[13242] Yogin middle-of die place is.
[13243] Who sky-goer death-manner and
[13244] Like-that knowledge-holder death-manner and
[13245] Fire-heap like self finish and
[13246] Not-see sky garuda like and
[13247] This all elements self finish
[13248] Not-see not-take thus
[13249] Yogin self-of sphere is.
[13250] This-to habituation-of self-momentum obtain.
[13251] Die time this know-by,
[13252] Body mind transference-of characteristics know.
[13253] Thus abide yogin-to,
[13254] Die condition permanent and impermanent not,
[13255] Like-that fear all free and
[13256] Body-of attachment extreme also free.
[13257] View itself and meditation-by also
[13258] Yogin possess-to benefit-harm free.
[13259] Benefit free harm-of fruit not-exist-by,
[13260] This-to abide sphere also not.
[13261] Cause and effect-of ripening free.
[13262] Therefore this-to habituation supreme:
[13263] Self-arise self-liberate birth-not-exist expanse.
[13264] Time not-change appear change.
[13265] Spontaneous primordial-pure expanse-into dissolve.
[13266] Hope fear two-of extreme from free.
[13267] Cause effect two-of extreme finish-from,
[13268] Sphere awareness two-not-exist primordial-pure expanse.
[13269] Therefore this meaning realize-by sufficient.
