[11762] The Grounds of Power and Spontaneity
[11763] Four there are: the ground of power over life, the ground of the Great Seal, and the ground of spontaneous accomplishment. Yet these persons do not swiftly attain the fruit; having first obtained their respective grounds, they must remain for long periods training to bring them to perfection, as proclaimed in the Blazing Reliquary Tantra:
[11764] When earth trembles at the time
[11765] A being separates from breath,
[11766] This one obtains the sravaka ground.
[11767] Likewise, should it tremble in three days,
[11768] The self-same ground gives rise to motion—
[11769] This is the pratyekabuddha's ground.
[11770] When in six days it comes to be,
[11771] This is the bodhisattva's ground,
[11772] Entering therein, O dakini.
[11773] If in nine days it should come
[11774] That earth does tremble and transform,
[11775] This one has power to freely roam
[11776] The ground of the vidya-dhara.
[11777] Yet buddhahood's fruit does not appear
[11778] To one endowed with trembling grounds;
[11779] Thus in grounds and paths alike
[11780] Long cultivation must one dwell.
[11781] Those of scant learning nowadays, failing to understand that the vehicles' entry-paths are distinct, apply all grounds of the causal vehicle's path and stages only to the nature of causes. This resembles calculating for all travelers the days required to reach Lhasa based only on the days needed by burden-bearers—yet not all can be indicated thus. Just as horsemen, swift-footed ones, birds, and others cover in a few days what takes the heavily-burdened long periods, so too slower ones take more time—these are not certain.
[11782] Likewise, the methods and wisdom-activities of each path should be understood by the wise and discerning.
[11783] The second topic concerns the signs of birth-taking by the six realms' confusion. This has two aspects: the general arrangement and the presentation of actual signs.
[11784] First: For all sentient beings there are two paths to go, two results—making four in all. Without the intermediate state of dharmata and the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible. Without the two—the buddha-return and the being-return—there is no destination.
[11785] Page 272 - Liturgical Translation
[11786] To proceed toward buddhahood, there are five paths: the path of accumulation, the path of application, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, and the path of completion.
[11787] The path of confusion leading to birth as a sentient being also has five continua: the path of dreams, the path of latent tendencies, the path of the limits of karma, the path of the uncertain confusion-mandala, and the path where cause and result are each uncertain.
[11788] Regarding results, the distinctive buddha-fruits are twofold: the fruit of buddhahood just-as-it-is, and the fruit of buddhahood with manifest realization.
[11789] The results of birth as a sentient being are six: hell, hungry ghost, animal, human, god, and asura—beyond these, no destination exists.
[11790] Second, regarding actual signs, from among six:
[11791] First, the sign of birth in hell: at the time of death, the sky gathers with black clouds, and one proceeds as if darkness were kindled. When rain, steam, great wind, hail, and dust-whirlwinds swirl, one takes birth among the eight hot hells, the eight cold hells, the intermittent hells, the neighboring hells, the unbearable birth-being hell, and the seven vajra hells.
[11792] The latter two, although included in the category of the eight hot hells, are distinguished separately due to their long lifespans and great suffering.
[11793] Moreover, by the karma of immediate actions and so forth, all who take birth in the last of the hot hells dwell for one intermediate kalpa, while those who have abandoned the Dharma remain billions of hundreds of thousands of kalpas longer—hence it is called the Unbearable Birth-Being Hell. As proclaimed in the Noble Sutra of the Transcendence of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines:
[11794] Through the ripening of the karma of abandoning Dharma,
[11795] One takes birth in the great unbearable birth-being hell,
[11796] Experiencing unbearable suffering.
[11797] Even when the great fire-gathering kalpa arises there,
[11798] One takes birth where the great birth-being hell exists
[11799] In the eastern worlds—thus it is proclaimed
[11800] To extend throughout the ten directions, limitless and boundless.
[11501] Breaking great samaya toward vajra guru.
[11502] Signs of birth as hungry ghost, animals, asura, god, human.
[11503] First, breaking great samaya:
[11504] To break samaya with the vajra guru is the greatest downfall,
[11505] For the guru is the embodiment of all Buddhas.
[11506] Thus breaking great samaya.
[11507] Second, signs of birth as hungry ghost:
[11508] Attachment to giving arises, desire for food and drink intensifies,
[11509] The mouth constricts, the throat narrow.
[11510] Thus the signs of birth as hungry ghost.
[11511] Third, signs of birth as animal:
[11512] Delusion increases, stupidity prevails,
[11513] Fear arises, confusion of direction.
[11514] Thus the signs of birth as animal.
[11515] Fourth, signs of birth as asura:
[11516] Jealousy arises, competitive mind intensifies,
[11517] Aggression toward others, desire for superiority.
[11518] Thus the signs of birth as asura.
[11519] Fifth, signs of birth as god:
[11520] Pride increases, attachment to bliss,
[11521] Complacency arises, neglect of Dharma.
[11522] Thus the signs of birth as god.
[11523] Sixth, signs of birth as human:
[11524] Equanimity toward the six objects,
[11525] Desire to practice virtue, aspiration for liberation.
[11526] Thus the signs of birth as human.
[11527] Herein, the purpose of knowing signs:
[11528] Recognizing the signs, one can purify.
[11529] Through purification, better rebirth is attained.
[11530] Thus the purpose of knowing signs.
[11531] Herein, the method of purification:
[11532] Confession, restoration, and accumulation of merit.
[11533] Through these, samaya is repaired.
[11534] Thus the method of purification.
[11535] Thus breaking great samaya and its signs are explained.
[11536] Good rainbow lights, pure skies.
[11537] Inner signs certain for six realms.
[11538] Dissolving warmth from foot-sole, teeth, navel, throat, crown.
[11539] First, good rainbow lights:
[11540] Rainbow lights appearing at death,
[11541] White, red, green, blue—auspicious signs.
[11542] Thus good rainbow lights.
[11543] Second, pure skies:
[11844] 11544] The sky appearing clear and cloudless,
[11545] Without obscuration, naturally luminous.
[11546] Thus pure skies.
[11547] Third, inner signs certain for six realms:
[11548] For hell: heat, for hungry ghosts: cold,
[11549] For animals: darkness, for asuras: battle,
[11550] For gods: light, for humans: neutrality.
[11551] Thus inner signs for six realms.
[11552] Fourth, dissolving warmth from foot-sole:
[11553] The warmth withdraws from the soles of the feet,
[11554] Sign of birth in the hell realms.
[11555] Thus dissolving from foot-sole.
[11556] Fifth, dissolving warmth from teeth:
[11557] The warmth withdraws from the teeth,
[11558] Sign of birth in the animal realms.
[11559] Thus dissolving from teeth.
[11560] Sixth, dissolving warmth from navel:
[11561] The warmth withdraws from the navel,
[11562] Sign of birth in the human realm.
[11563] Thus dissolving from navel.
[11564] Seventh, dissolving warmth from throat:
[11565] The warmth withdraws from the throat,
[11566] Sign of birth in the god realms.
[11567] Thus dissolving from throat.
[11568] Eighth, dissolving warmth from crown:
[11569] The warmth withdraws from the crown,
[11570] Sign of liberation or birth in pure realms.
[11571] Thus dissolving from crown.
[11572] Herein, the importance of recognition:
[11573] Recognizing these signs, one can direct the mind.
[11574] Through direction, liberation is attained.
[11575] Thus the importance of recognition.
[11876] Page 275 - Liturgical Translation
[11877] From that one's following, learning might arise; therefore these are explained for turning back. As proclaimed in the Blazing Reliquary Signs Tantra:
[11878] Thus for all sentient beings,
[11879] When the life-formations are enacted,
[11880] By the sky's own characteristic
[11881] All these exercise in birth-places.
[11882] Whoever dies, at that time
[11883] The sky turns gloomy-black, darkness black,
[11884] Likewise rain and steam and wind,
[11885] Hail and dust-whirlwinds arise—
[11886] To whoever these befall,
[11887] Without intermediate state,
[11888] They become in hell's birth-place,
[11889] O dakini.
[11890] Sky like mist, light yellow,
[11891] Sun and moon die,
[11892] Without wind and dust,
[11893] Yellow mist, sun not visible,
[11894] Rain or traces, or at twilight
[11895] These will fall—thus to whoever
[11896] These befall, in hungry ghost
[11897] Birth-place they are born, O dakini.
[11898] Sky gloomy without wind,
[11899] Clouds black without gaps,
[11900] Or mist appears,
[11901] Gloomy joyless—whoever
[11902] Does the life-formation,
[11903] This is the animal place.
[11904] Greatly fierce, disturbed by wind,
[11905] Clouds black-massed, fearful forms,
[11906] Greatly disturbed with coming-going,
[11907] Thunder and lightning's tongue protrude,
[11908] Sun and moon unable to be seen—
[11909] Thus to whoever these befall,
[11910] This is the asura birth-place.
[11911] Sky clear and pure,
[11912] Sun and moon's appearance clear,
[11913] Wind and dust unable to rise,
[11914] This is the god's birth-place.
[11915] Also in clear pure sky,
[11916] Undivided clouds like white silk,
[11917] Greatly thin, thread-like appear,
[11918] Or sun and moon with light-housed—
[11919] Thus to whoever these befall,
[11920] This human birth-place is obtained.
[11921] Thus whoever possesses signs,
[11922] Is certainly of the six races;
[11923] Formations without such signs
[11924] Are signless and uncertain.
[11925] Thus all those signs
[11926] Come from two to three days,
[11927] These are signs of birth there
[11928] In that birth-place—thus proclaimed.
[11929] Even those who die without signs—where they take birth is known by their own karma.
[11977] Yet at the time of death, the appearance of hell-fire,
[11978] The appearance of hunger, thirst, and fear,
[11979] Consciousness becoming gloomy, or thinking one dwells among animals,
[11980] Or not seeing lands of humans before,
[11981] Or the experience inside Meru or inside the ocean,
[11982] Or appearances of seeing inside divine mansions or pleasure groves,
[11983] Or seeing appearances like white clarity—these are explained in the sūtras as inner signs certain for individual six realms.
[11984] Also from the tantra sections:
[11985] Warmth from the soles of the feet,
[11986] Teeth,
[11987] Navel, and
[11988] Throat,
[11989] Between the eyebrows,
[11990] And dissolving from the crown are said to be signs of taking birthplaces of the six realms.
[11991] Also, though signs that have arisen appear in agreement with one's own mind, they should be known as certain signs of individual birthplaces.
[11992] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[11993] The certain establishment of the arrangement of signs of the three times—the twenty-second chapter.
[11994] Thus having shown the sequence of signs, the method of liberation in this life for those of excellent faculties, effort, and places of the general instruction,
[11995] Now, for establishing extensively the Dharma arrangement of completely perfect buddhahood in the bardo for those of medium faculties, there are two:
[11996] The general establishment of the intermediate state and
[11997] The extensive explanation of individual natures.
[11998] First, regarding the essence of the intermediate state:
[11999] Definition,
[12000] Division,
[12001] Appearance pattern,
[12002] And ground boundary—five aspects.
[12003] First, the essence:
[12004] The situation of outer objects and inner mind appearing as dharmas.
[12005] Furthermore, all appearances other than inner space of primordial purity are the situation of the intermediate state.
[12006] The aspect of appearance of the face of self-arising activity through the two form bodies from the self-radiance of ground-appearance appearing as body and wisdom is the pure intermediate state of dharmatā,
[12007] While all impure dharmas of deluded appearance of the six realms are the intermediate state of delusion.
[12008] Between which of these two dharmas of pure and impure does it exist?
[12009] Since from the space of primordial purity it must dissolve back into primordial purity through outward movement, it exists in the interval of primordially pure nature.
[12010] First, that also arises from that.
[11964] Page 277 - Liturgical Translation
[11965] The first also arises from that, the last also must be delivered to that nature's state. In the space of primordial purity there is no intermediate state; that self does not depend on other dharmas before or after, nor is entry into anyone's interval possible, for it transcends the limits of transfer-change and appearance-emptiness.
[11966] From the Thal-logical Result:
[11967] In the primordial purity of the beginning,
[11968] The ground of confusion cannot be expressed;
[11969] Likewise, what of the unconfused?
[11970] This point too, if wisdom exists, is of great import.
[11971] Second, the etymology: "intermediate" (bar) is expressed from the aspect of being the center dharma of any upper, lower, before, or after—like the intermediate state of dream existing between going toward sleep and waking. "Ma" indicates center. "Do" (two) dwells in the center like a connecting rope joining beginning and end—the connecting rope of the center of two.
[11972] Third, divisions: from common and uncommon. From some common vehicles, birth-death intermediate state, dream intermediate state, dharmata intermediate state, existence intermediate state, and so forth are desired. In this uncommon vehicle, the secret king, four are regarded: nature intermediate state, death-time intermediate state, dharmata intermediate state, and existence intermediate state.
[11973] From the Thal-logical Result:
[11974] Such is the dharmata of intermediate state,
[11975] The greatly secret dharmata explained;
[11976] Divided, from four aspects—thus.
[11977] Fourth, appearance-pattern: from two. First, as shown generally: appearance in the general aspect of the three realms is desired as the manifestation of grasping-grasped, attachment-aversion, and afflictions; the subtle, form, and formless.
[11978] Appearance in each of the six realms individually: in one cause-water, by gods as nectar, etc. From the Two Truths:
[11979] Mind alone differentiates things,
[11980] Thus sees objects as unestablished.
[11981] For an individual in the category of doors, to one donor many enemies and friends appear.
[12001] Ground-boundary of nature-remaining intermediate state.
[12002] Death-time intermediate state.
[12003] Dharmatā intermediate state.
[12004] Existence intermediate state.
[12005] First, ground-boundary of nature-remaining:
[12006] The nature remaining as the ground of all,
[12007] Primordially pure, spontaneously present.
[12008] Thus the ground-boundary of nature-remaining.
[12009] Second, death-time intermediate state:
[12010] From the moment of death until the clear light,
[12011] The dissolution of elements and consciousness.
[12012] Thus the death-time intermediate state.
[12013] Third, dharmatā intermediate state:
[12014] The clear light of dharmatā dawning,
[12015] Recognition brings liberation.
[12016] Thus the dharmatā intermediate state.
[12017] Fourth, existence intermediate state:
[12018] From the dharmatā clear light until conception,
[12019] The wandering in the bardo of becoming.
[12020] Thus the existence intermediate state.
[12021] Herein, the duration:
[12022] The death-time lasts until the clear light.
[12023] The dharmatā lasts a maximum of four days.
[12024] The existence lasts a maximum of forty-nine days.
[12025] Thus the duration of intermediate states.
[12026] Herein, the appearances:
[12027] In death-time: dissolution of elements.
[12028] In dharmatā: clear light dawning.
[12029] In existence: karmic visions arising.
[12030] Thus the appearances.
[12031] Herein, the liberation:
[12032] In death-time: through recognition of dissolution.
[12033] In dharmatā: through recognition of clear light.
[12034] In existence: through recognition of illusory nature.
[12035] Thus liberation in intermediate states.
[12036] Herein, the preparation:
[12037] Through hearing, contemplating, and meditating,
[12038] Recognition is prepared for death and bardo.
[12039] Thus the preparation.
[12040] Herein, the importance:
[12041] Without preparation, wandering continues.
[12042] With preparation, liberation is certain.
[12043] Thus the importance of preparation.
[12044] Thus the four intermediate states are explained.
[12045] Thus the instructions on intermediate states are complete.
[12027] Page 279 - Liturgical Translation
[12028] By meaning, separating inanimate from consciousness, remaining in death-fearing suffering.
[12029] The appearance of the dharmata intermediate state: abandoning the support of aggregate self-grasping, body and wisdom's dharmata appears manifest; karma and latent-tendency's connection cut, enjoying the dharmata of nature-meditation; faculty grasp-doer's object empty, exercising in the dharmata of self-appearance clear-light.
[12030] The appearance of the existence intermediate state: outer body's existence as mind-body with all faculties complete goes unobstructed; inner mind's existence thinking in many think-doers, mind enters; body and mind's gathered existence goes unobstructed in all except the two supports, mind loose.
[12031] The two supports: the vajra seat accomplished from blessing, and the mother's womb.
[12032] Therein, most masters identify the vajra seat as that in India, but here it is desired as that in which all buddhas abide in the door of liberation from suffering in the supreme place of buddhahood in the inner space of primordially-pure unchangeable. The mother's womb is desired as the impure door of samsara in any of the six realms' birth-places; know that this is not the literal meaning.
[12033] Generally, sutra places have two: provisional meaning and definitive meaning; intention and indirect intention—bound by four manners. Tantra section places have two on top of that: literal and not literal—know these bound by six limits.
[12034] These too from the Thal-logical Result:
[12035] Intermediate state's appearance:
[12036] Nature-remaining aggregates and
[12037] Elements and afflictions appear as objects,
[12038] Death-time's mist-gloom rising,
[12039] Consciousness not remaining as one.
[12040] Dharmata intermediate state: body and
[12041] Wisdom, light and color,
[12042] Drops expanding and elements appearing,
[12043] Whatever appears: dharmata's measured palace.
[12044] Existence's appearance flickering,
[12045] Flashing like dream appearance,
[12046] True-appearance false, mind's object,
[12047] White-mist etc., six races' light,
[12048] Each individual's focused object appears—thus.
[12049] Fifth, ground-boundary: from four.
[12121] The ground boundary of the intermediate state of remaining in nature is from exiting the mother's womb until struck by the disease of the final death condition.
[12122] From there until breath is cut by gasping is the death-time intermediate state.
[12123] From inner breath being cut, clear light arises; the interval of spontaneously accomplished appearance is the dharmatā intermediate state.
[12124] From there, spontaneously accomplished dissolves, appearing like flashing dreams until entering the mother's womb is the ground boundary of the existence intermediate state.
[12125] These introductions shown at the final time of death are called the instruction of giving a robe-shake to the traveler crossing.
[12126] That traveler has entered the path of death.
[12127] The suffering of death is great,
[12128] And if the various path appearances are not known as own-appearance, there is danger of arising as enemies.
[12129] If known, there is danger of appearing as helpers.
[12130] To hit that shake at death,
[12131] Is called the instruction of hitting with robe-shake; the example and meaning fit.
[12132] These are the general establishment of the intermediate state.
[12133] There is need to divide in half for ease.
[12134] Second, regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are four:
[12135] For the intermediate state of nature, the tone-instruction like entering a box with rope cut, deciding the class of knowables,
[12136] For the death-time intermediate state, the instruction like looking in a beautiful woman's mirror, giving clarity to what is unclear,
[12137] For the dharmatā intermediate state, the instruction like meeting a familiar person or a child entering the mother's lap through confidence in own-appearance,
[12138] For the existence intermediate state, the instruction like inserting a fox into a broken fox hole through the continuity of karma.
[12139] First:
[12140] Before doing the entering-box, examine whether caught or not caught by the enemy of harm; without harm, with the box ready, whenever entering that box later, no need to cut superimpositions, without doubt,
[12141] And without obstruction or attachment, entering like that yogin, first desiring liberation from saṃsāra, examining which method is profound and which point is great, abandoning three—deciding the limit of that Dharma of self-confidence, entering with doubt, and not arriving at the beginning.
[12142] First, cultivate the mind through hearing.
[12143] In the middle, decide through contemplation.
[12144] Finally, repeating with meditation, making the mind at ease is like approaching the box.
[12145] Like entering the box, settling meanings, entering at death without danger or fear.
[12146] The meanings of these were extensively shown before.
[12147] Here, explaining slightly in condensed practice:
[12148] Looking at outer appearance, seeing the appearing object like an illusory confusion mandala,
[12149] When seeing only the self-form of groundless emptiness,
[12150] All dharmas appearing variously as the mirror of view, meditation, and conduct have arisen from the beginning.
[12151] For it is the self-power of dharmatā's ceaseless play arising.
[12152] Also, looking at the various white and red appearing like eating under a garment house,
[12153] When seeing whatever appears, whatever arises, whatever is heard, all as the play of self-dissolved emptiness, without hand to correct or discard the blockage of appearance,
[12154] Appearance liberates from the ground of appearance, confusion liberates as groundless, arising only as the peak of illusion, liberated from saṃsāra of grasping outer objects.
[12155] The dharmas—pieces of mountains, excellent-born women, etc.—whatever first arises as appearing object, cut in pieces, put greatly wherever it appears,
[12156] Without entering the great consciousness as investigator,
[12157] Appearance is not changed by mind.
[12158] Mind is not seized by appearance; dissolve in self-place.
[12159] Without preventing the six consciousness groups, putting in self-place, dharmatā appearance arises spontaneously.
[12160] Thus looking at outer dharmas, when knowing as the self-form of objectless emptiness, grasping is pure like objectless space.
[12161] This is called realizing grasping as without nature.
[12162] Thus looking at the consciousness of the outer looker,
[12163] Moving dissolves in emptiness without outline,
[12164] When realizing as self-clear without sudden dissolving,
[12165] Realizing inner dharmatā as great without birth, cessation, or ground,
[12166] Grasping spreads as self-dissolved in the nature of supportless sky-like state.
[12167] In supportless ye re.
[12168] Remaining in direct penetration,
[12169] Pervading without truth,
[12170] Fixed without root.
[12171] In the nature of the great equalness of dharmatā, smiling ge, put with joy.
[12172] There is need for the twist-nail of grasping mind to come out.
[12173] Thus when realizing object and mind as groundless and root-free,
[12174] The secret self-awareness of grasping-grasped, free from elaboration, goes to remaining.
[12175] When meditating in the nature of clear light without gathering or separating space-awareness through the four lamps of introduction by the master's word to the great self-clear primordial purity,
[12176] The five lights of outer space-appearance self-radiance are clear like form-reflections inside a mirror.
[12177] Though aspects appear outer, essence remains inner.
[12178] Knowing appearance-emptiness like water-moon form-reflections,
[12179] Do not do grasping attachment of joy-play in appearance.
[12180] Looking far in the clear light of outer appearance,
[12181] Inner awareness clear light clears near.
[12182] Awareness, free from meditation mind and antidote, wide view of pure vast nature,
[12183] Clear meditation of self-descended nature-remaining,
[12184] Without accepting or rejecting in clear light conduct,
[12185] Through obtaining the fruit of primordially pure self-clear,
[12186] Abandon delusion appearance without abandoning,
[12187] Block delusion thought without preventing,
[12188] Pure without training dual-grasping,
[12189] Pure from the beginning without abandoning faults,
[12190] Spontaneously accomplished qualities without seeking.
[12191] The meaning of complete liberation of the three realms,
[12192] Transcending the object of view,
[12193] Transcending the mind of meditation,
[12194] Transcending the calculation of conduct,
[12195] Transcending the Dharma of result,
[12196] In the fortune of emptying saṃsāra,
[12197] The field of dharmatā manifest appearance is spacious.
[12198] In the good circle of the land of the source of bliss,
[12199] Having obtained the self-arisen palace according to desire,
[12200] With the first lord, the King of Unchanging Light,
[12201] And the five-light spontaneously accomplished queen gathered,
[12202] The supreme inconceivable holy child-appearance meets his own father and mother.
[12203] It is called the time of obtaining the eternal establishment of inseparable joy-bliss.
[12204] The extensive scripture of these was shown before.

[12135] Doing certainty by clear situation, from Sun-Moon Union:
[12136] Exclamation! Conqueror, you listen:
[12137] By condensing all those,
[12138] The drop remaining as one is obtained.
[12139] And what and what are they?
[12140] By putting, self-spread is obtained;
[12141] By intentions, time is shown;
[12142] By exhaust-patterns, intention is shown;
[12143] By stable confidence, the not-turning sign.
[12144] Thus meanings are condensed.
[12145] These are that result:
[12146] Who sees the space-lamp
[12147] Manifestly exercises in dharma-space;
[12148] Who sees the drop-lamp
[12149] Obtains the hope-base of those with effort;
[12150] Who sees the wisdom-lamp
[12151] Realizes general and self-characteristic;
[12152] Who sees the water-lamp
[12153] Obtains power over faculties;
[12154] Who is habituated in lu-gu-rgyud,
[12155] Awarenesses obtain balance.
[12156] By that result of three bodies,
[12157] All these are self-awareness ground.
[12158] In the intermediate state of nature-remaining,
[12159] The birth-being habituated to these,
[12160] All elements as self-vanish,
[12161] Become in this without doubt.
[12162] These dharmas I proclaimed,
[12163] All sutras and tantras here condensed—thus extensively said.
[12164] Second, the eightfold instruction like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror for giving clarity to unclear in the death-time intermediate state: thinking the cause of certain death with many examples, examining death's signs, showing reversal methods, showing death-time appearance, showing giving instruction, showing birth-place signs, showing purifying rites, showing other uncommon places.
[12165] First has three: training in dharma without opportunity for leisure-freedom by thinking on the difficult-to-obtain manner; showing the rite of training; producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on continuous cause of certain decay; meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death.

[12167] Difficult to be born: born in the place of dharma exercise from karma-ground of Jambu-continent. Difficult to obtain: obtaining leisure with endowments. Difficult to meet: meeting master virtuous friend. Difficult to enter: entering the door of holy dharma jewel. Difficult to know: knowing unsurpassed instruction exactly not wrong. Difficult to abandon: abandoning samsara's suffering ocean, the time to go to liberation's buddha-continent—now if not accomplished producing effort and courage, later such favorable conditions complete are not possible. Therefore appropriate to meditate day and night in profound meaning without opportunity for leisure-freedom.
[12168] From the presence of Arya Nagarjuna:
[12169] Remaining in favorable land,
[12170] Relying on holy birth-beings,
[12171] Virtue arisen from before-training good prayers by self,
[12172] You possess the four great wheels—thus.
[12173] From the presence of Arya Shantideva:
[12174] This leisure endowment is greatly difficult to obtain;
[12175] For the birth-being who has obtained purpose accomplishment,
[12176] If effort is not made in this,
[12177] Where will proper obtainment be later?
[12178] Having obtained such leisure,
[12179] If effort is not made now,
[12180] Go to negative path as corpse of the dead;
[12181] In billions of hundred-thousand kalpas,
[12182] Not even hearing the sound of happy path,
[12183] What need to mention obtaining happy path?—thus said.
[12184] That too: all this present pleasure-pain and appearance become from before karma; later appearance is produced by present karma. Those who did evil karma before ripen here as incomplete faculties, crooked limbs, etc., ugly forms, poor, become under others' power. Those who gathered good karma before, here clear faculties, beautiful forms, pleasing to the mind when seen.
[12501] Possessing retinue, enjoyment, prosperity.
[12502] Where to be born depends on present thought-conduct.
[12503] Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation.
[12504] First, possessing retinue:
[12505] When possessing a retinue of disciples,
[12506] One has gathered the accumulations and benefits beings.
[12507] Thus possessing retinue.
[12508] Second, enjoyment:
[12509] The enjoyment of Dharma, the supreme bliss,
[12510] Not worldly pleasure, but the joy of liberation.
[12511] Thus enjoyment.
[12512] Third, prosperity:
[12513] The prosperity of virtue and wisdom,
[12514] The wealth of the seven noble riches.
[12515] Thus prosperity.
[12516] Fourth, where to be born depends on present thought-conduct:
[12517] The realm of rebirth is determined by present mind and action,
[12518] Virtuous conduct leads to higher realms,
[12519] Non-virtuous conduct leads to lower realms.
[12520] Thus where to be born depends on thought-conduct.
[12521] Fifth, Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation:
[12522] As stated in the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement:
[12523] "Through virtuous thought and conduct,
[12524] One attains the higher realms and liberation.
[12525] Through non-virtuous thought and conduct,
[12526] One falls into the lower realms of suffering."
[12527] Thus the quotation.
[12528] Herein, the importance of thought:
[12529] Thought is the forerunner of all actions,
[12530] Pure thought leads to pure results.
[12531] Thus the importance of thought.
[12532] Herein, the importance of conduct:
[12533] Conduct manifests thought in action,
[12534] Virtuous conduct purifies the mind.
[12535] Thus the importance of conduct.
[12536] Herein, the result:
[12537] Through pure thought and conduct,
[12538] One attains the higher realms and liberation.
[12539] Thus the result.
[12540] Herein, the summary:
[12541] Retinue, enjoyment, and prosperity arise from virtue.
[12542] Rebirth depends on present thought and conduct.
[12543] Thus the summary.
[12544] Thus possessing retinue, enjoyment, and prosperity is explained.
[12545] Thus the dependence of rebirth on thought-conduct is established.
[12546] Thus the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation is complete.

[12232] For dharma alone benefits; other than dharma, nothing reaches benefit. From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:
[12233] Here father, mother, relatives,
[12234] Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;
[12235] Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.
[12236] Except these quality-possessors,
[12237] No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.
[12238] From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:
[12239] As time's danger, king becoming to go,
[12240] Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;
[12241] Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,
[12242] Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.
[12243] Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay: having obtained such difficult leisure, yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded, like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation dharma.
[12244] Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion? From the Ratnagotra Tantra:
[12245] In coarse element forms,
[12246] Alas, no ground to sit;
[12247] To birth-being's stable life breath,
[12248] Alas, time does not strike;
[12249] In group six's object appearance,
[12250] Alas, nothing permanent;
[12251] In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,
[12252] Alas, nothing exhausts;
[12253] In suffering arisen from body,
[12254] Alas, nothing pure—thus.
[12255] Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused. Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others, enemies conquered, lands obtained—yet doing whatever, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.
