[12308] For dharma alone benefits; other than dharma, nothing reaches benefit. From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:
[12309] Here father, mother, relatives,
[12310] Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;
[12311] Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.
[12312] Except these quality-possessors,
[12313] No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.
[12314] From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:
[12315] As time's danger, king becoming to go,
[12316] Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;
[12317] Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,
[12318] Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.
[12319] Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay: having obtained such difficult leisure, yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded, like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation dharma.
[12320] Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion? From the Ratnagotra Tantra:
[12321] In coarse element forms,
[12322] Alas, no ground to sit;
[12323] To birth-being's stable life breath,
[12324] Alas, time does not strike;
[12325] In group six's object appearance,
[12326] Alas, nothing permanent;
[12327] In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,
[12328] Alas, nothing exhausts;
[12329] In suffering arisen from body,
[12330] Alas, nothing pure—thus.
[12331] Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused. Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others, enemies conquered, lands obtained—yet doing whatever, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.
[12332] Page 287 - Liturgical Translation
[12333] From the presence of Glorious Atisha:
[12334] Exclamation! Looking far at world's conducts,
[12335] All doing is purposeless, cause of suffering;
[12336] Whatever is thought, benefit not reached—
[12337] Habituate looking at self's mind,
[12338] Like thus requested.
[12339] Third, instruction for meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death: generally, impermanent compounded dharmas resemble dream, illusion, etc. From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:
[12340] Exclamation! Compounded things are impermanent,
[12341] Characteristics of dharmas of arising and perishing;
[12342] Than becoming to perish after birth,
[12343] Therefore quick peace is bliss.
[12344] Like star, dust, eye-disease, lamp,
[12345] Magical-illusion, dew, water-bubble,
[12346] Dream, lightning, cloud—
[12347] Compounded dharmas resemble that—thus.
[12348] Especially, example of birth-being's impermanent life from the Great Secret Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[12349] Whatever body-possessing birth-beings,
[12350] Life is impermanent like dream,
[12351] By dream establishment not exists;
[12352] Life impermanent like rushing-water,
[12353] By falling-water not exist sitting as one;
[12354] Life like grasp-not wind,
[12355] By wind birth-being seize not;
[12356] Life like short-duration emanation,
[12357] By emanation always remain not;
[12358] Life like true-not magical-illusion,
[12359] By magical-illusion true ground seize not;
[12360] Life like not-staying traveler,
[12361] By traveler always sit not;
[12362] Life like not-certain rain-cloud,
[12363] By cloud time seize not.
[12364] Thus birth-being's life extent
[12365] Is thus not certain as one,
[12366] Sudden and thunder-fall,
[12367] Time thus not seized.
[12368] From the Extensive Play Sutra:
[12369] Life impermanent like play's cloud,
[12370] Like mountain-cascade falling-water goes quick fast—thus.
[12371] From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:
[12372] Some remain in womb then die,
[12373] Likewise some after birth...
[12374] Page 288 - Liturgical Translation
[12375] Some at only stopping cough, likewise some completely running, some old and some young, some dying after descending into youth—in that, thus "this human is young," what pride-confidence of the alive?
[12376] Thus thinking certain quick death by impermanence: this life's activity—attachment-aversion, fight-quarrel, laziness, hoard-store, great year-wish difference, faction side-grasp, enemy-friend subdue-protect, hearing yet word-explain not fitting meaning, and all friends—what benefit? Thus must think from heart. To do speech:
[12377] Life duration short, knowable forms many;
[12378] Life's extent also not known how much;
[12379] Like goose taking milk from water,
[12380] Do accept self's desire.
[12381] Thus: from today, need effort in profound dharma. That too, also looking at outer object's appearance, continuous impermanent by sun-moon-time-four change; moment impermanent by day-night moment change; nature impermanent by thinking birth-death sequence-row; thinking on gathered-yet-separate like shop traveler; quickly die, certainly die, when die opportunity not exist, thus thinking dharma-not-by benefit not exist.
[12382] Inner self's illusion-body youth, mind's arise-door, pleasure-pain sequence-rows changing before-after, thus also thinking impermanent, not-stable, changing, transferring, as not having example of returning after death. Thinking death only without being distracted moment-instant.
[12383] From Conduct Entrance:
[12384] Day and night all in, by self,
[12385] Appropriate to think this only—thus.
[12386] That too, meditating samadhi in interval of mind not turned from this life, and though putting other dharma exercise of doing, need to think this only from heart, for no dharma more profound than this for turning mind from samsara.
[12387] From the presence of Master Great Padma also...
[12388] Page 289 - Liturgical Translation
[12389] Give urge by death impermanent without distraction; day and night divided in sessions, always do meditation—like thus said.
[12390] Therefore, though thinking long in existence attachment-decay, life impermanent; though thinking in near moment-instant, life impermanent. Faculty and object impermanent, situation changes; retainer and wealth substance impermanent, now exist yet now not exist; father, mother, relative impermanent, not exist after passing; land person and neighbor impermanent, many separations; sun, moon, old, young impermanent, appearance changes; pleasure-pain and enemy friend impermanent, like traveler-house.
[12391] In short, all birth-beings put pillow in birth-death, wear pleasure-pain garment, spread grasping-grasped seat, take ignorance bed, sleep self-grasping sleep, dream latent-tendency dream. All goers exercising in five poisons' self-nature in three realms' samsara house, also sleeping and arising, in sleep and dream without beginning-end and wake time—think this.
[12392] Now from samsara's darkness-house, need to bring out effort in liberation's method.
[12393] Samsara-pa become by power of karma and affliction,
[12394] Though impermanent manifests, grasp as true;
[12395] Though fallen in birth-death's water-fall, liberation not known;
[12396] Though experience various sufferings, no time to forget;
[12397] True friend separate, no protector showing path,
[12398] Dharma's eye closed, wandering in ignorance darkness.
[12399] Thinking these, in difficult-to-obtain leisure,
[12400] Appropriate to produce joy-mind or accomplish dharma;
[12401] Supreme become guide showing true path,
[12402] Having met mark-possessing masters,
[12403] At this time obtaining profound dharma supreme nectar,
[12404] By effort accomplish, crossing supreme other-side of existence-three ocean.
[12405] Life impermanent like setting-mountain's shadow,
[12406] Like precipice-edge tree moved by wind,
[12407] Like cloud and lightning, grass-tip dew,
[12408] Think to die quickly as self.
[12409] If now "die" not remembered from heart,
[12410] Benefit not reached at die-time by laziness-distraction;
[12411] Therefore now like falling to beginning,
[12412] Train in essence-meaning by fear-terror.
[12413] From now, self also in flower forest,
[12414] Empty by birth-beings, hearing falling-water's sound,
[12415] Dwelling near solitary, mind-pleasing cliff-mountain,
[12416] Mind of "not existent essence in four times" virtue,
[12417] Cultivated by world person as ornament-cause,
[12418] Having obtained supreme nectar than all,
[12419] May proclaim great sound of impermanent empty!
[12420] Page 290 - Liturgical Translation
[12421] There in beautiful medicine tree flower grove,
[12422] Possessing cloud canopy of peaceful dharma manner,
[12423] By flickering gold light of awareness-holder conqueror,
[12424] May one life's clear-light essence be accomplished!
[12425] From liberation's mansion jewel palace,
[12426] By resounding tone of peaceful dharma manner drum sound,
[12427] All goers not remaining wake from ignorance sleep,
[12428] May manifestly buddha in original ground!
[12429] The clear-natured one with weariness-mind,
[12430] Desiring to go one-along to peaceful forest,
[12431] Speaking tone of wished words from heart:
[12432] May quickly accomplish by pure faith virtue!
[12433] Thus called are interval verses.
[12434] Second, examining death's signs from the Thal-logical Result:
[12435] Death's signs also twenty-one;
[12436] Gone to solitary charnel-ground direction,
[12437] Do worship and give to master;
[12438] Also by eating and drinking,
[12439] Do please other goers;
[12440] From that, also examine outer, inner, secret death signs—thus said.
[12441] All ordinary not knowing when die,
[12442] Transcended in distinction from world outsiders examining by divination, pra, etc.;
[12443] Yogin's seizing time certainly:
[12444] Gone to person-not-exist valley empty, retreat, charnel-ground, forest-retreat, mountain valley, etc., doing life form examination, etc.
[12445] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12446] At the time of death-lord demon rising,
[12447] Thus examine death-time intermediate state;
[12448] In solitary place or valley empty,
[12449] Precious to seize death's time—thus.
[12450] Examining actual: from uncommon and common. First, from that self: form-reflection in sky's space, becoming impermanent and dissolving, moon-form not existing is death. Limb four break in four months; above that head break in three months; upper lower divide in two months; roll in fist in one month—know that time.
[12451] Sky-earth two's connection-rope: if becoming cut, not able more than nineteen days. From Meru's sides, not falling from white lion, not liberated by sixteen days. If at mountain and plain boundary, wish-fulfilling tree waist breaks—these also examine by wise one.
[12541] When the ocean's water vapor dissolves,
[12542] This too is divided by the wise in sequence.
[12543] In earth's villages and cities,
[12544] If the monk's smoke itself breaks,
[12545] In nine days he will thus perish.
[12546] On the peak of Meru mountain,
[12547] If the unchanging sun sets,
[12548] In three days he will also die.
[12549] Completely abandon rites,
[12550] Examine the meaning of self-awareness essence.
[12551] From inside the hollow of Meru,
[12552] If the ḍākinī's sound breaks,
[12553] In thirteen or five days.
[12554] If from the wish-fulfilling tree,
[12555] The demon of death-lords rises,
[12556] In seven days he cannot be liberated.
[12557] That will not become benefit.
[12558] Habituation to emptiness is precious.
[12559] Thus.
[12560] Second, the common:
[12561] Also from that itself,
[12562] If the luster of limb nails is gone,
[12563] In nine months he cannot but perish.
[12564] If the vapor of the birth-being's eyes dissolves,
[12565] In five months likewise.
[12566] If the death-lord Yama himself rises,
[12567] In twenty-one days he dies.
[12568] Nothing can benefit that.
[12569] If the ankle of the foot protrudes outward,
[12570] In one month likewise.
[12571] If examining another's body,
[12572] When the birth-being is struck by disease,
[12573] Tartar accumulates at the tooth root,
[12574] In nine days he will also die.
[12575] In various five days likewise,
[12576] In that way also death.
[12577] Limbs repeatedly move and contract,
[12578] That is in seven days.
[12579] When eyes look with sticking grains,
[12580] In three days tro-ta.
[12581] If the eye joints are greatly disturbed,
[12582] That is in half a month.
[12583] If the cheek channels break,
[12584] In nineteen days likewise.
[12585] The birth-being does life formation,
[12586] If breath is also agitated in gasping,
[12587] That is in six months.
[12588] If the nose ma-si-ka breaks,
[12589] In seven days he will perish.
[12590] If the eye ba-ra-na breaks,
[12591] In five days he will also perish.
[12592] If the left cheek flesh falls,
[12593] In one day he will likewise perish.
[12594] If upper and lower teeth become closed,
[12595] In three days he cannot but perish.
[12596] If black drops arise on the tongue,
[12597] In two days he will also perish.
[12598] If ears stick to the head,
[12599] That is at midnight of that night.
[12600] If the chest protruding nose collapses,
[12601] In half a month he cannot but perish.
[12602] If there is no root for falling asleep,
[12603] That is also in half a month.
[12604] Thus.
[12605] Third, showing the method of reversal.
[12606] Gathering accumulations in special lands,
[12607] And doing the wheel of elemental dependent origination,
[12608] Through the three—deceiving demons with ransoms—explained to reverse even from exhausted life.
[12609] From that itself:
[12610] When signs arise in the body thus,
[12611] The rite of deceiving death is explained.
[12612] Beginning the karma of reversing the birth-being,
[12613] With one's own master and virtue assembly,
[12614] Gathering accumulations in special lands,
[12615] Pleasing with gifts and feasts,
[12616] Begin these rites.
[12617] For equal portions of elemental sounds,
[12618] On the palm tree's leaf,
[12619] The wheel of the five elements,
[12620] With four calculations, center and rim,
[12621] Wheels of earth, water, fire, wind, and sky,
[12622] Make five wheels,
[12623] Divided by colors according to elements.
[12624] In the center wall and five,
[12625] Five letters of each self,
[12626] Surrounded by the group of Ali at the rim.
[12627] Having written wheels thus,
[12628] Worship, praise, and confess impurity,
[12629] Make prayers according to each individual's desire.
[12630] Thinking of the elemental god in the center,
[12631] Recite and insert the number of letters.
[12632] Then in a fitted clay vessel,
[12633] Inserting all those wheels,
[12634] Bind crosswise with five colored threads.
[12635] Wood, water, fire, and earth,
[12636] In the mouth-vapor of disagreeing races,
[12637] Mix all that with dough-food,
[12638] Make a form of one cubit in the mixture.
[12639] Letters on the five faculties,
[12640] Write on paper and put inside unfolded.
[12641] By that restore weak elements.
[12642] If seized by demons,
[12643] Dough-food the extent of the birth-being's age,
[12644] Change the color itself,
[12645] With cloth-pieces of one's own stains,
[12646] Also elemental substances like that,
[12647] Mix with food and form.
[12648] With wool-colors, silk, and feathers,
[12649] Adorn those forms.
[12650] Also tormas agreeing with those,
[12651] Those too are like that.
[12652] In the last of that form, the dough-food,
[12653] Surround by the yogin's number of years.
[12654] Having blessed, recite these words:
[12655] "Take, take, O powerful ones,
[12656] Craving, attachment, grasping,
[12657] Remembering, seizing, thinking, and touching.
[12569] Page 293 - Liturgical Translation
[12570] Release, peace, and liberate—recite these words three times. From that, send to river's channel. In reversing from death, no doubt in naraka—thus.
[12571] Fourth, showing death-time's appearance: individual appearances of channel-wind disturbed at individual elements' dissolving times. Sign of earth dissolving in earth: body heavy, not able to rise. Sign of water dissolving in water: water flows outward from mouth and nose, then dries. Sign of fire dissolving in fire: heat lost from body's four edges, luster and complexion gathered. Sign of wind dissolving in wind: breath gasps not arising, body's strength lost.
[12572] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12573] Earth dissolving in earth,
[12574] Likewise water, fire, and wind,
[12575] Individual individual dissolving in self—
[12576] Thus come in birth-being's body.
[12577] By earth dissolving in self,
[12578] Body heavy, food not taken,
[12579] All strength of rising and going exhausted.
[12580] At time of water dissolving in water,
[12581] Water of mouth and nose drips.
[12582] Likewise by fire dissolving in fire,
[12583] Mouth and nose greatly dry,
[12584] Heat of body's edges lost.
[12585] Likewise by wind dissolving in wind,
[12586] Breath coarse-coarse, limbs move,
[12587] Eye also turns upward—thus.
[12588] Fifth, three in instruction of giving: putting space-awareness self-place in excellent habituated; middle purifying transfer; last relying on other conditions.
[12589] First: yogins dying alone, without gather-separate in clear-light's appearance, at that time also not depending on other, by clear self-appearance, putting without distraction from that nature. Body key-posture of three which-any, or cross-legged, or by lion's sleep-method, dying in awareness space-awareness placed nature, in that moment liberating as upward penetrate-through, without dharmata intermediate state.
[12590] Also from that self:
[12591] At that time, the fortune-possessing birth-being,
[12592] If appearance self self-clear,
[12593] Thus consciousness not-remaining in self-place—thus.
[12594] Page 294 - Liturgical Translation
[12595] By lion's sleep-method of aggregates: placing awareness self in eye, doing mind little interval-space as path. If space and awareness not changing, that person without intermediate state, no doubt in buddha; dying one's breath also becomes slow—thus.
[12596] Space-awareness habituated ones: at death-time, in snow, cave, person, etc., dying without mind-distracted conditions is important. Also by peaceful god:
[12597] Whoever stays near,
[12598] Also not doing grief,
[12599] By this no one becomes distracted
[12600] In buddha remembering, etc.—
[12601] Like thus said.
[12602] Second, doing transfer's key as shown before. That also, at time of life-wind entering consciousness-wind, lifting place from heart, being time, awareness from heart, thinking self's master's body color-filled, throwing by seven or twenty-one hig sounds to brahma-opening, liberating as moment-by penetrate-through in primordially-pure ground.
[12603] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12604] Though four winds cease by sequence,
[12605] At time moved by one great wind—
[12606] From thus:
[12607] Consciousness riding wind, purifying in wind,
[12608] Also precious to send above;
[12609] Precious to gather and throw awareness;
[12610] That also throwing by hig,
[12611] That meeting to master's mouth—thus.
[12612] At time of awareness's wisdom wind entering consciousness, here transferring, instructions hit clear here. From that self:
[12613] At that time, master's instructions,
[12614] Familiarize in self's continuum;
[12615] Also hit clear by these meanings—thus.
[12616] Transfer entering place and place at breath transfer-time, and instruction of space-awareness entering body and wisdom, are two; also in space-awareness, not relying on other conditions of habituated, and relying—explained as two. That is the place of instruction's form becoming three.
[12617] Third, relying on other conditions: at that time, by one without stain in master or vajra brother existence samaya, hitting clear.
[12618] Page 295 - Liturgical Translation
[12619] That also resembling now's clear-light send-ma, like intermediate-state's clear-light early-ma; for reason of joining those two middle, showing appearance like space-awareness send-ma:
[12620] Exclamation! Son of the race, this present clear-light is actual self-arisen wisdom; in this nature, put mind without fabricating, and you are buddha in upward penetrate-through. Also look at this appearance not changing; this present clear-light becomes mixed with dharmata mother's clear-light, all appearances arising in buddha-field. At that time, do recognize as self-appearance. At that time, you are buddha in primordially-pure ground.
[12621] If not recognized there, at time of clear-light dissolving in spontaneously-accomplished, body and wisdom's appearance arises. From that, wisdom four preparation's appearance arises. From that, spontaneously-accomplished's hundred doors arise—by you, do recognize as self-appearance. After recognizing self-face, recite three times "you are well gone to primordially-pure ground"; self also putting equally moment in that appearance, and also giving clear in that. Liberated certain by that.
[12622] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12623] If space-awareness not clear,
[12624] In dharmata bliss intermediate state,
[12625] For grasping awareness's appearance,
[12626] Do in mind lights shown before;
[12627] By that obtain true appearance.
[12628] If those not clear,
[12629] At self's master remaining,
[12630] Also hit clear above instruction;
[12631] If master not exist, vajra brother,
[12632] Also do hit clear of knowing—thus.
[12633] Like that, hitting instruction continue to dying, or showing benefit to other by three jewel-form instructions at death-time for others of not-agreeing dharma awareness. That also: at that time of outer breath cut, inner breath not cut, do remain in manifest dharmata meaning for moment's interval by self. From that, other person separating from breath, that gap's mouth-nose three and self's mouth-nose three joined, wind going upward in three pieces.
[12634] Page 296 - Liturgical Translation
[12635] Here gathering in three from: there, first piece think white AOM and throw; second with red AH throw; last throw without thinking anything. Here all three think as HUM, that consciousness blue-green HUM pull to self's awareness. Also in speech thus HUM cause, forcefully pull to shoe-sole. At that time, producing body-speech-mind three strength of self, pulling inside shoe-sole shoe-sole, that one's wind warm pierce certainly arises to self's inside.
[12636] At that time, coming by HRIQ between that other person's eyes; from that, body also comes able to rise suddenly. Like that becoming, show eye's thusness dharmata manifest appearance. When eye becomes suddenly, putting like introducing drop-empty lamp by thumb-finger: clear-light existing in self, that is this; this self at time of coming out from body, dharmata intermediate state arising as self-possessive, this is self-appearance, not other—do recognize self-face, thus hitting three times. When saying "see that appearance" or "understand that instruction," if voice comes, good; even if sign arises, it is hit.
[12637] Obtain not-thinking samadhi in dharmata intermediate state, certain to become buddha. That also from Sun-Moon Ga-Union:
[12638] If doing other's benefit,
[12639] For grasping that self by compassion,
[12640] Open door three's doors,
[12641] Breath: hold, inhale, and throw;
[12642] By inserting syllable three letters,
[12643] For producing body, speech, mind strength,
[12644] Do with breath together by wise one;
[12645] By doing like that again and again,
[12646] That one's appearance like this:
[12647] If obtaining body's strength,
[12648] Do hit instructions;
[12649] Yet if consciousness becomes clear,
[12650] Put equally in meaning self;
[12651] Faculty doors in self near,
[12652] Put eye's thusness looking;
[12653] If mind of equal remaining arises,
[12654] Obtain not-thinking possessing samadhi—thus.
[12655] This instruction called "hitting as robe-shake" is one great-important point of this Great Completion. Like that, gathering faculties, also hitting clear by key of reversing death again.
[12656] Page 297 - Liturgical Translation
[12657] Important meditation producing effort in not dying now. Sixth, showing birth-place signs: warmth dissolving to crown, certainly giving breath as excellent primordially-pure, middle intermediate state, last emanation-body. Ordinary birth-beings giving breath by birth in high realms. That also: at death-time, eye doing dust-eye, warmth gathering to genitals, birth toward animal. Hand moving right, warmth gathering to crown, god. Word confused, warmth gathering in right armpit, asura. Left foot moving, striking earth, warmth gathering to foot-sole, hell. Body yellow, luster not existing, warmth gathering to throat, hungry ghost. Word clear, memory not losing, warmth gathering in eye, birth in human birth-place.
[12658] Also from that self:
[12659] Outer appearance like this:
[12660] If warmth dissolves upward,
[12661] Become giving great breath;
[12662] If eye not clear, dust-eye,
[12663] Birth toward negative-path places.
