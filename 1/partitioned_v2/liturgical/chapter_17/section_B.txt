[10810] Heart not desiring human association,
[10811] Thinking of flying in sky,
[10812] Perception of joy when this appearance ceases,
[10813] No attachment to body and life,
[10814] Mind not entering whatever appearance,
[10815] Clear awareness not dull,
[10816] Awareness naturally slow,
[10817] Joy when associating,
[10818] Not able to be aroused by any affliction,
[10819] Not holding thought even when affliction arises,
[10820] Attachment not arising to beautiful forms,
[10821] Not hating ugly forms,
[10822] Perception of food and drink not arising through samadhi power,
[10823] Making others' minds not accord when associating with humans.
[10824] These are signs before complete nirvana.
[10825] Of the third, signs of familiarity with bindu—five aspects:
[10826] Bindu essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[10827] Essence: not different, dwelling as one, without duality.
[10828] Definition: bindu not-change, LE vast, greatly pervading all.
[10829] Division: body-dwelling channel bindu, nature path bindu, complete result bindu—three.
[10830] Of the first, conventional cause bindu white and red two, ultimate wisdom bindu five—two categories.
[10831] Wisdom bindu five and ground bindu good, light upper-bur, dwelling unmoved in general body channel.
[10832] From Result Exposition:
[10833] Body place is this:
[10834] In crown and heart channel,
[10835] Unfabricated pure reality dwells.
[10836] Path bindu good, moved by wisdom wind from within channel, goes.
[10837] Good bindu makes four lamps arise as object.
[10838] Good peak moves various wisdom analysis within channel.
[10839] Good bindu possessing ornament, depending on four lamps, shows appearance of increasing experience.
[10840] Nature path bindu is:
[10841] Reality bindu without fabrication, pervading all;
[10842] Samantabhadra bindu appearing without good, bad, big, or small;
[10843] Expanse bindu clear without outer or inner;
[10844] Pure expanse bindu arising without deviation, obscuration, or direction-falling;
[10845] Wisdom bindu dwelling without primordial making;
[10846] Great wisdom bindu appearing directly, unobscured by any affliction—six.
[10847] Complete result bindu:
[10848] Dharma-kaya bindu single, free of elaboration, beyond identification, primordially pure essence, variously appearing as ways of arising, without any establishing cause.
[10849] Bindu characteristic: free of various pain, round without elaboration, showing awareness appearance, great transparent wisdom, gathering five rims into one as kaya place, essence beyond identification because emptiness does not establish as thing.
[10850] From that, increase of appearance arises, virtue arising directionless, characteristics unstained by any defect, capacity unceasingly appearing as various play, essence self-pure because characteristics are without duality, nature self-liberated because reasoning arises directionless.
[10851] From such bindu becoming expanse, outer signs are certain.
[10852] From Blazing Relics:
[10853] Who becomes expanse bindu,
[10854] This fortunate one sees singly.
[10855] Empty bindu lamp,
[10856] Self-arising without effort—
[10857] All these are own experience signs.
[10858] Word elaborations cut,
[10859] Other mind not entering even for an instant, no occasion,
[10860] Speech-continuum exhausted from saying,
[10861] Thought to speak to others
[10862] Not possible in this person—
[10863] How could sound words follow?
[10864] Thus in whom this appears,
[10865] That one decides the single elaboration-free.
[10866] Thus possessing signs,
[10867] Even in two years from that,
[10868] Knowing awareness measure,
[10869] Dwelling without separation
[10870] From expanse and awareness own-appearance—
[10871] That also dissolves elements to self,
[10872] Without doubt this changes.
[10873] Fourth, kaya—five aspects:
[10874] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[10875] Essence: abiding as support of nirvana dharmas, nature always dwelling.
[10876] Definition: stainless transparent-penetrate, great self-complete.
[10877] Division: dharma-kaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya—three.
[10878] Though common vehicles consider three kayas as result, Great Perfection's system considers three kayas as path appearance. Dharma-kaya is own-appearance—as long as dharma exists, mind exists, this is path. As long as kaya exists, body exists, this is path appearance—not final.
[10879] This main reaching complete measure is exhaustion appearance, dissolving near primordially pure.
[10880] Sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are path appearance—various appearing dharmas exist in rank, not final extreme-free mark-free equality.
[10881] At measure-reaching time, kayas, fields, and teachers appear from spontaneously accomplished appearance.
[10882] Characteristic: path appearance clear-light empty nature.
[10883] Result: when primordially pure jewel secret inside moves, inner clear three kayas dwell only as arise-basis.
[10884] Familiarizing with such path appearance kaya reality, obtained appear-experience three kaya signs.
[10885] From Blazing Relics:
[10886] Kaya measure trained,
[10887] Upon fortunate person,
[10888] Before, signs like this:
[10889] Who familiar with dharma-kaya,
[10890] Body not seen by others
[10891] In their seen activity-field,
[10892] Yogin plays self-freely.
[10893] Samadhi of not-seeking, placed,
[10894] Arises in own continuum,
[10895] Awareness not-thinking experience,
[10896] Appears in all yogins' minds.
[10897] Thus arisen persons
[10898] See dharma-kaya appearance,
[10899] Seeing this, all buddhas'
[10900] Kayas gather in expanse.
[10901] Signs of familiarity and confidence with sambhogakaya:
[10902] Person experiencing thus
[10903] Plays in five kayas, five wisdoms,
[10904] By gaze of great play—
[10905] Thus possessing signs,
[10906] That fortunate possessing yogin,
[10907] Upon empty bindu lamp
[10908] Arising without effort,
[10909] Appearance also becoming kaya,
[10910] Person seeing gradually
[10911] Sees sambhogakaya root by this.
[10912] Continuum familiar thus,
[10913] Speech clear, possessing voice,
[10914] Words of lying say
[10915] Not arising from this mouth—
[10916] Likewise words of non-virtue action
[10917] Always saying, expression-end ceases.
[10918] Thus possessing signs,
[10919] If practice this meaning,
[10920] Fly in sky,
[10921] Transparently penetrate mountain rocks,
[10922] Enter under ground,
[10923] Arise without drowning in water.
[10924] Thus arisen fortunate one,
[10925] If confidence not entering expanse-awareness,
[10926] Elements dissolve to self,
[10927] Change is not self—
[10928] From this, transferring birth,
[10929] In reality bardo,
[10930] Liberate in five instants.
[10931] What person possessing fortune,
[10932] Familiar with nirmanakaya,
[10933] This person becoming confident,
[10934] These body, speech, mind signs,
[10935] In whom arise,
[10936] This also becomes fortune.
[10937] Meaning of dharma heard before,
[10938] Also in own continuum
[10939] Arises simultaneously—
[10940] This becomes dakini.
[10941] Likewise various words
[10942] Of dharma not heard before,
[10943] Speak from mouth by nature—
[10944] Likewise words of other secret mantra
[10945] Tantras, as words,
[10946] How clear according to order—
[10947] Likewise all dharmas,
[10948] All word meaning forms,
[10949] Beings' faith,
[10950] Dharmas and accord,
[10951] How asking, that answer,
[10952] This fortunate one speaks,
[10953] This is speech lion.
[10954] Strength greater than previous,
[10955] Gain fast foot strength,
[10956] Body without wrinkles,
[10957] White hair becomes black,
[10958] Likewise like sixteen years,
[10959] Possessing youth luster,
[10960] Example: grass upon youth,
[10961] Rain falls again,
[10962] Grows like self-grow—
[10963] Compassion not existing before
[10964] Arises from depth in this,
[10965] After that enters beings' benefit.
[10966] When beings arise
[10967] For benefit of own body,
[10968] However this desires,
[10969] Able to give body and limbs—
[10970] What need to mention outer possessions?
[10971] Likewise able to give
[10972] Body etcetera to own guru as before.
[10973] Thus in whom arises,
[10974] This one touches nirmanakaya.
[10975] Thus when nirmanakaya signs exist, if desire, take miraculous birth in nature nirmanakaya field, dwell sixty-eight thousand years for beings' benefit, from that state emanate millions of four continents, do immeasurable benefit for beings, cross ground of primordially pure.
[10976] If think contradiction with nature emanation completing five hundred years—no contradiction. Though dwelling five hundred for self-benefit, dwelling limitless for other-benefit—no contradiction.
[10977] Also from that:
[10978] Thus possessing person,
[10979] After in nirmanakaya field,
[10980] Taking miraculously born body,
[10981] Dwelling sixty-eight thousand years,
[10982] This person does beings' benefit.
[10983] Then from essence nature,
[10984] In Jambudvipa etcetera continents,
[10985] By sixty thousand million emanations,
[10986] Taking suitable bodies,
[10987] Does beings' benefit—
[10988] This becomes, dakini.
[10989] Then to essence primordially pure,
[10990] Like sun rays gathering,
[10991] Own emanation with,
[10992] Self-dissolves into own essence,
[10993] Becomes without difference, without distinction.
[10994] As water dissolves in water,
[10995] Likewise butter in butter,
[10996] As sky dissolves in sky,
[10997] Essence becomes without identification.
[10998] Inner awareness experience:
[10999] From Self-Arisen:
[11000] Possessing that joy,
[11001] Without attachment to worldly,
[11002] All appearance arising as light,
[11003] Seeing kaya mass not ceasing in light,
[11004] Body joy without grasping,
[11005] Awareness one-pointed,
[11006] Awareness naturally slow,
[11007] Awareness not distracted,
[11008] Awareness not entering other,
[11009] Realizing awareness as not anything,
[11010] Awareness not changing,
[11011] Awareness clear without ceasing,
[11012] Awareness ceasing without thought,
[11013] Awareness self-liberating without grasping,
[11014] Small grasping at outer-inner dharmas,
[11015] No attachment or clinging to body.
[11016] Fifth, awareness—five aspects:
[11017] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[11018] Essence: appearing as vajra chain.
[11019] From Lion Power Complete:
[11020] Own-appearance awareness thing that,
[11021] Dwells as wisdom chain.
[11022] Definition: previously not-aware, aware by guru pith-instruction, therefore awareness.
[11023] Division: three—ground-dwell awareness beyond virtue-defect fault, path-appearance awareness famous in respective philosophical systems, insight awareness.
[11024] Mind-itself, unborn, co-emergent wisdom, mind-beyond, meaning alaya, bodhicitta called—whatever name, pervading all buddhas and beings, self-awareness wisdom self-clear empty naked this.
[11025] Insight awareness: direct appearance of vajra chain kaya, free from thought word cage, without bright-dim of virtue-defect fault-merit, if diligence not distracting from that view, accomplishes light-body transparent-penetrate.
[11026] Characteristic: this naked self-clear.
[11027] Result: liberates into primordially-pure transparent-penetrate by practicing that.
[11028] Though commonly considering three kayas as result, here making path, not establishing primordially-pure extreme-free great as kaya and wisdom, considers result like crystal not-ceasing arise-basis—great distinction.
[11029] Signs of training such awareness:
[11030] From Blazing Relics:
[11031] Who familiar with awareness,
[11032] These signs upon that body:
[11033] Able to insert self-awareness there,
[11034] Wherever thing is placed,
[11035] Body follows that
[11036] Wherever ground dwells,
[11037] As same as awareness,
[11038] Able to change others' faith,
[11039] Self-ceasing thought-continuum clinging,
[11040] Possessing inner signs—
[11041] Who knows directly,
[11042] This goes to elements' own-place,
[11043] This fortunate one dissolves,
[11044] Gains supreme unborn siddhi.
[11045] From Result Exposition:
[11046] Thus from practice,
[11047] Signs and measure this-like:
[11048] Body light, appearing transparent-penetrate,
[11049] Without touch, without obstacle to ground,
[11050] Speech power complete, speech pair exhausted,
[11051] Mind able to transfer,
[11052] Eye, form, nose, tongue,
[11053] All body sense-faculties cease—
[11054] Measure of becoming without nature.
[11055] Third: grasping well path measures by saying other distinctions of signs—three aspects:
[11056] General showing of unborn obtaining signs,
[11057] Particular explanation of qualities signs,
[11058] Separate saying of distinction of three mixed signs.
[11059] Of the first:
[11060] Yogin entering confidence in primordially-pure realization, signs of not taking birth again in existence—no insects on body, hair and fingernails not growing. Then in three months, seen by others, five lights center, five race kayas, rising in sky and dissolving.
[11061] From Blazing Relics:
[11062] Who, by whom, unborn
[11063] Root-cut person that,
[11064] Signs like this also arise.
[11065] Who possesses this sign,
[11066] Is equal fortune with me.
[11067] Insects etcetera on body,
[11068] All these birth continuum ceases.
[11069] Who hair and fingernails,
[11070] All these not growing, continuum ceases—
[11071] This is without birth.
[11072] Thus possessing signs,
[11073] Even in three months,
[11074] This dissolves elements to self,
[11075] Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[11076] Own body in light tone center,
[11077] With race this becomes.
[11078] This is exhaustion time yogin, great fortune.
[11079] Second: praise of that qualities—appearance body speech qualities, immeasurable awareness empty qualities not.
[11080] Enjoying peaceful-wrathful mandalas and dharma-kaya qualities in own-appearance buddha field.
[11081] From that:
[11082] Thus realized person,
[11083] Existing-non-existing qualities inconceivable,
[11084] Wisdom dwelling as one,
[11085] Great teacher self-showing self,
[11086] Primordial tone dwelling in self without arrangement,
[11087] From nature of method and wisdom,
[11088] Buddha race also appearing as two,
[11089] All this appearing as that retinue,
[11090] From ground-appearance without nature,
[11091] Appearing as dharma unspeakable, unthinkable, inexpressible,
[11092] Also equality of three times,
[11093] Primordially all these self-dwelling.
[11094] Third: from single only signs, from two mixed, from three possessing—if body signs complete, liberate in bardo; if body and speech two exist suitably, possessing speech signs on body, liberate in emanation field; if mind signs complete, liberate in bardo in three instants; if all three complete, do other benefit with compassion, knowing self-benefit obtain certainty, blessed for countless lives, doing benefit, that support liberates into light; if body and mind signs two exist, obtain self-benefit quickly and liberate; if speech and mind signs gather, obtain light-body in ten years; also if three signs of body, speech, and mind gather, other benefit not arising, liberate in two years.
[11095] From that:
[11096] Effort-possessing person,
[11097] Body signs complete,
[11098] In bardo reality,
[11099] See truth, buddha.
[11100] Body possessing speech signs,
[11101] This in emanation field,
[11102] Breath-out, take one birth.
[11103] Who possesses mind signs,
[11104] This between two births
[11105] Of life formation,
[11106] Like shooting star in sky,
[11107] In three instants as shooting way,
[11108] With emanation also,
[11109] Self-dissolves into essence.
[11110] If body, speech, mind signs gather,
[11111] This great bodhicitta,
[11112] Compassion possessing beings' holder,
[11113] This for holding beings,
[11114] In hundred thousand million years,
[11115] Even with one human body,
[11116] Completing this meaning,
[11117] Not entering between two births,
[11118] Complete attainment.
[11119] Also whoever fortunate,
[11120] Possessing body and mind signs,
[11121] Thus possessing, in ten years,
[11122] Dissolves elements to self-place,
[11123] Appearance not appearing,
[11124] Delivers to pure reality ground.
[11125] Who body, speech, mind signs,
[11126] Thus to fortunate person,
[11127] To whoever fortunate gathering,
[11128] Even in two years from this,
[11129] Dissolves this elements to self,
[11130] Without doubt this changes.
[11131] Outer-inner certain signs exist as liberate measure thus. Liberate not pervaded by merely existing signs. Because liberate pervaded by existing signs, this special is important.
[11132] From Blazing Relics:
[11133] All body, speech, mind signs,
[11134] Some arisen person,
[11135] Not completely liberated—
[11136] Worldly common siddhi and
[11137] Gradually sravaka pratyekabuddha,
[11138] All these grounds,
[11139] This entered that ground,
[11140] Without pure great result.
[11141] Who possesses body, speech,
[11142] Signs complete person,
[11143] Even in equal great ground,
[11144] All these go, dakini.
[11145] Thus said signs only exist without certainty. Now without any outer-inner liberate signs, gone without meditation, action not harm, meditation not needed. Later do not place skull on head. Though saying view-meditation complete, seeing reality original meaning, know demon enters deceiving other and self both by sending lie.
[11146] From that:
[11147] Thus not possessing signs,
[11148] Entering confidence in own-appearance,
[11149] Who claims acceptance that,
[11150] Examination view and
[11151] Likewise examination meditation—
[11152] All these liberate,
[11153] This not able,
[11154] Long in samsara,
[11155] This person also dwells.
[11156] That also: instruct with special diligence to leap-over meditation yogin because these signs arise without deception, certain liberation.
[11157] From that:
[11158] Therefore expanse-awareness familiar important.
[11159] Who familiar with expanse and awareness,
[11160] Those signs explained above,
[11161] Impossible to not arise.
[11162] Do diligence as well spoken.
[11163] General meaning third: conclusion of signs certain of liberation and confusion in bardo and next life—two aspects.
[11164] Signs of yogin liberating and obtaining enlightenment, and showing signs of six beings taking birth through confusion.
[11165] Of the first, two aspects:
[11166] Brief showing of signs,
[11167] Extensive explanation.
[11168] Of the first:
[11169] Even meditating reality direct meaning, if diligence inferior, measure not reached. At time of separating solid-awareness with stone, signs of liberating from defilements without taking existence—complete buddhahood by great appearance of self-relics, sound, and light.
[11170] That also: Great Perfection's system has two buddha ways—complete buddha by appearing signs is nirvana with remainder, stone with residue; perfectly complete buddha by excellent diligence, pure stone with, is nirvana without aggregates' remainder.
[11171] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror Tantra:
[11172] Nirvana that also two:
[11173] Perfectly complete buddha and
[11174] Complete buddha.
[11175] Of that, perfectly complete buddha is
[11176] Buddhahood without aggregates' remainder.
[11177] To complete buddha person,
[11178] Light and
[11179] Sound and
[11180] Relics and
[11181] Kaya and
[11182] Earth move etcetera arise, said.
[11183] From Blazing Relics:
[11184] Excellent wisdom-power person,
[11185] Elements dissolve to self-place
[11186] From confusion appearance this,
[11187] To essence result,
[11188] Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[11189] Result becomes self-ground.
[11190] Thus outer signs,
[11191] What from nirvana,
[11192] To that kaya and relics and
[11193] Likewise light and sound and
[11194] Earth moves.
[11195] Second, extensive explanation—five:
[11196] Kaya, relics, light, sound, and earth move.
[11197] Of the first, essence, division, cause, place, and result.
[11198] Essence: appearing as deity forms—single kaya, half-kaya, father-mother, mass, great mandala; according to that direction, stupa, wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, cross, sword, etcetera.
[11199] From not reaching creation-completion, letters, hand-symbols, half-kaya, self-single appear; from complete, father-mother, mass, mandala appear.
[11200] Division: peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya two.
[11201] From Blazing Relics:
[11202] To race-possessing nirvana,
[11203] That remainder contaminated,
[11204] Aggregates' trace burned purified,
[11205] To that kaya two—
[11206] Peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya.
[11207] From Self-Arisen:
[11208] Kaya form two exist,
[11209] Peaceful and wrathful said,
[11210] Wrathful thus-gone,
[11211] Peaceful cannot power emanation.
[11212] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11213] Kaya also two,
[11214] Peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya.
[11215] Continuum: two from essence cause—all beings primordial clear-light kaya; from existing relics, here creation-completion clearly shows manifest cause, arising from gathered pure elements.
[11216] Latency exists, not-ripe nature;
[11217] Manifest ripe, appearing as relics.
[11218] From former:
[11219] Beings primordial,
[11220] Self-place great ground dwell,
[11221] By ripe not-ripe distinction,
[11222] Manifest and latency.
[11223] Place: much arising from head or spine, though also from other. Here clear-light familiar arising kaya shown arising from those two.
[11224] From Blazing Relics:
[11225] Likewise kaya from head,
[11226] Or from spine vertebrae joint.
[11227] Result: rank of obtaining liberation.
[11228] That peaceful-wrathful both arise, consciousness dissolves into sky. At time of primordially-pure sky own-tone arising, liberate without reality bardo, buddhahood, included within this-life liberation, because that is future part separate from this support.
[11229] If peaceful kaya arises, this appearance ceases, immediately dissolves, liberates in samadhi five days.
[11230] Samadhi days called concentration ground part—yogins have long-short difference.
[11231] If wrathful kaya arises, from eye arises Vajrasattva nose-rope, sound-light-ray three arise as own-appearance, liberates in five instant parts.
[11232] Thus from Blazing Relics:
[11233] If both arise,
[11234] This without bardo,
[11235] Essence primordially-pure great,
[11236] This becomes possessing confidence.
[11237] Five days see truth,
[11238] That also dissolves into buddha.
[11239] If wrathful kaya arises,
[11240] This in reality bardo,
[11241] In five instant parts,
[11242] Liberates, dakini.
[11243] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11244] If peaceful kaya arises, immediately upon this appearance ceasing, obtains stability, cannot emit emanation kaya.
[11245] If wrathful kaya arises, obtains stability in that, in twenty-one days can emit emanation kaya.
[11246] That peaceful kaya arising, delivering clear-light path, liberating transparent-penetrate into primordially-pure ground, own-appearance emanation not arising from bardo. Primordially-pure separates that emanation appearance, not ground for own-appearance emanation arising.
[11247] However, other-appearance is basis for sambhogakaya-nirmanakaya arising, other benefit activity arises depending on that, though know primordially-pure lacks actual emanation appearance portion.
[11248] That wrathful kaya arising, knowing sound-light-ray three as own-appearance, at liberation time, spontaneously accomplished ground-appearance arises, stays a moment.
[11412] Through remaining for a moment in the arising of spontaneously accomplished ground-appearance,
[11413] Upon completing twenty-one days of samādhi,
[11414] Through the gate of impure own-appearance, saṃsāra appears as the six classes of beings.
[11415] Through the gate of purity, the emanation kāya emanates, taming whatever and benefiting.
[11416] Like illusion benefiting illusion,
[11417] Own-appearance benefits through own-appearance.
[11418] What need for liberation before emanating emanations?
[11419] For if self is not liberated, since self-benefit is not complete, there is no occasion for other-benefit to arise.
[11420] That emanation is only like a shooting star running,
[11421] Explained as uncertain regarding long or short duration.
[11422] Confusing able and unable to emit emanations,
[11423] Many focus their minds on whether buddhas can or cannot benefit others.
[11424] This is a great error.
[11425] Buddhas that do not benefit are not desired in the Great Vehicle and are impossible in reality.
[11426] Those liberated in primordial purity without transparent penetration, where spontaneously accomplished doors of the bardo arise without delay, have no emanations,
[11427] For the impure field of emanation does not appear at that time.
[11428] From the spontaneously accomplished door appearing, the impure appears.
[11429] If emanation does not benefit there,
[11430] Since the appearance of saṃsāra has not set, to complete the incomplete buddha activity of own-appearance, emanation appears to open.
[11431] Having benefited through that, emptying saṃsāra, again that emanation appearance goes to the ground of primordial purity, dissolving within the eight spontaneously accomplished doors.
[11432] That primordially pure ground, beyond appearing and not appearing, is without actual difference of individual three kāyas from merely the basis of arising of the three kāyas.
[11433] From that, know the way other-benefit arises again in ground-appearance.
[11434] This place is the supreme difficulty, the great secret vajra seal.
[11435] If from now on one arises who can speak without error, know it to be through my power.
[11436] Second, the extensive explanation of relics has three parts.
[11274] Brief show by common division,
[11275] Extensive explanation by special division,
[11276] Concluding meaning by distinction of relics and ringsels.
[11277] Of the first:
[11278] Generally all beings buddhas primordially, dwell as wisdom five nature individually and not individually, five relics not ripe as latency existing for holding that kaya race and life. Yogin trains clear-light essence path, ripens manifestly.
[11279] Five ringsel etcetera arising, liberating race separately.
[11280] From Blazing Relics:
[11281] To supreme person nirvana,
[11282] All buddhas' relics arise.
[11283] From buddha race distinction,
[11284] Relics race five-five arise.
[11285] Ringsel thus-gone relics,
[11286] Likewise called ringsel,
[11287] Is vajra race relics.
[11288] Ringsel jewel,
[11289] Ringsel lotus,
[11290] Likewise called ringsel,
[11291] Is action race relics.
[11292] That also: from five relics races to person, whatever arises one or all complete, to five race mass appearance, relics race is sign of liberating as that buddha.
[11293] From that:
[11294] Method-possess nirvana,
[11295] Body this all arises.
[11296] If individual race relics arise,
[11297] Also in reality bardo,
[11298] See buddha of individual race,
[11299] Liberate.
[11300] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11301] Relics also five:
[11302] Dark-blue color, Vairocana field complete buddha;
[11303] White color, Vajrasattva;
[11304] Yellow color, Ratnasambhava;
[11305] Red color, Amitabha;
[11306] Green color, Amoghasiddhi;
[11307] Various colors, reached ground of spontaneously accomplishing five kayas.
[11308] Second, special division—color of five relics races, measure of big-small, distinction of place, from what cause arises—four.
[11309] First color: five possessing portions of five races. That also peaceful relics color and wrathful relics color arise as two portions.
[11310] Peaceful color said in Blazing Relics:
[11311] Ringsel white,
[11312] Ringsel blue-black,
[11313] Ringsel yellow,
[11314] Ringsel red,
[11315] Ringsel green.
[11316] In Self-Arisen, wrathful relics color said:
[11317] That race shown this-like:
[11318] Ringsel white luster,
[11319] Ringsel blue-black,
[11320] Ringsel possessing heat yellow,
[11321] Ringsel dark-blue,
[11322] Ringsel red-green-black—
[11323] Likewise color division.
[11324] Measure of big-small: ringsel equal mustard seed, same as white mustard; others between poppy seed and small mustard seed, oily, round, gathered.
[11325] Place: ringsel dwells head, ringsel rib joint, ringsel liver top, ringsel kidney, ringsel dwells lung top.
[11326] Cause: two from peaceful relics cause—ringsel pure bone, ringsel pure heat, ringsel pure blood, ringsel pure elements, ringsel pure awareness gather arise in body.
[11327] Wrathful relics cause: ringsel skull luster head, ringsel pure blood, ringsel pure joint, ringsel pure foot, ringsel from pure five elements arise.
[11328] From Self-Arisen:
[11329] Ringsel from head arises,
[11330] Ringsel from blood arises,
[11331] Ringsel from joint arises,
[11332] Ringsel from foot arises,
[11333] Ringsel five elements
[11334] From pure correctly arises.
[11335] That five relics all very round shape, oily, gathered,
[11336] Depth clear five lights exist, sun show time very shining, clear.
[11337] From Blazing Relics:
[11338] Alas listen dakini,
[11339] Ringsel called white luster,
[11340] Oily gathered, color clear,
[11341] Equal mustard seed grain,
[11342] This from pure bone,
[11343] Arisen gathered ripe,
[11344] Method-possess from that head.
[11345] Ringsel called blue-black,
[11346] Equal poppy seed or
[11347] Or equal small mustard seed,
[11348] This pure heat gathered,
[11349] From that rib joint,
[11350] Arise, dakini.
[11351] Ringsel color yellow,
[11352] Equal poppy seed, from blood,
[11353] From that liver top arises.
[11354] Ringsel red luster,
[11355] Measure big-small equal poppy seed,
[11356] This gathered elements gathered,
[11357] From fortunate kidney,
[11358] Arise, dakini.
[11359] Ringsel indra,
[11360] Equal poppy seed, color clear,
[11361] From pure awareness,
[11362] This from lung top arises.
[11363] All these round gathered shape,
[11364] All depth clear five colors.
[11365] Peaceful relics liberate to race ground of certain own-appearance,
[11366] Wrathful relics—
[11367] Dharma-kaya,
[11368] Sambhogakaya,
[11369] Nirmanakaya,
[11370] Evident-awakening meaningful kaya,
[11371] Obtain unchangeable vajra kaya.
[11372] From Self-Arisen:
[11373] Ringsel obtains unborn,
[11374] Ringsel meaningful,
[11375] Ringsel obtains sambhogakaya,
[11376] Ringsel obtains nirmanakaya,
[11377] Ringsel vajra.
[11378] Third, concluding meaning by distinction of relics and ringsels:
[11379] Ringsel called like relics,
[11380] Round shape, whatever five color dwells.
[11381] Ringsel cause pure white red, flesh bone heat breath pure gathered arise,
[11382] Relics arise from very pure of pure.
[11383] Produce place and arise place—arise from between body joints and flesh skin, produce; ripen place—because exist in all bone and flesh and skin, thus from all those arise.
[11384] That flesh and skin and bone from arise, and blood and serum pure from arise, and heat from arise, and breath from arise—four races, color white and red-yellow and red and green-dark-blue five arise.
[11385] This result: breathing out as nature emanation.
[11386] That also: if arises to heart-essence meditation fortunate, that is; other all uncertain—some higher-realm birth, some lower-realm birth etcetera, common beings, bird and dog etcetera, evil, good friend examination scholar also arise.
[11387] Relics not breaking by elements' harm, not breaking even struck by iron hammer; ringsel fears—even ashes burned also break, ringsel not arising. Important to not burn too much when burning corpse hoping for ringsel.
[11388] That also from Blazing Relics:
[11389] This and also like,
[11390] Ringsel tiny is,
[11391] Equal sesame seed dust particle,
[11392] This elements can break,
[11393] This emanation field.
[11394] Ringsel between joints or
[11395] Or between flesh and skin,
[11396] All these from produce arise.
[11397] That people common and
[11398] Buddha ringsel—
[11399] Very pure not-pure, five light exist not,
[11400] Know by bodhi-tree and leaf.
[11401] Third, light—four aspects:
[11402] Essence, cause, division, and liberate measure result.
[11403] Light essence is
[11404] Self-clear five colors.
[11405] Continuum: from beyond two gathering of pure elements and familiar awareness own-tone, arises at time.
[11406] Division: by occasion—upward-stand, wing-arise, rim three; or like ladder sky-piercing insert, reaching sky center appearing as light house.
[11407] Result: if rim arises, liberate in first bardo; if upward-stand sky-pierce like arises, liberate without reality bardo by primordially-pure transparent-penetrate; if wing-arise, liberate at last bardo life.
[11408] If light ladder like inserts around died body or house or crematorium, liberates in wisdom four union in samadhi seven days; if light house like arises, liberates in five days upon mass appearance.
[11409] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11410] Light two:
[11411] Light arising as house way,
[11412] Light upward-stand ladder way.
[11413] That light house like obtains stability from five days, complete buddha.
[11414] That light ladder like complete buddha in seven days.
[11415] From Blazing Relics:
[11416] Light form three:
[11417] With rim around,
[11418] From whatever trace arises,
[11419] This in first bardo,
[11420] Obtain certain result.
[11421] If upward stand,
[11422] This bardo not appearing,
[11423] Buddha in instant.
[11424] If light appears from wing,
[11425] This in last bardo,
[11426] Obtain complete awakening.
[11427] That spontaneously-accomplished appearance emanation spreads, from that state emanation out-emanates to world ten directions also for beings' benefit—own-appearance reflection beings six and other-appearance self-character beings two fields, two emanations doing benefit.
[11428] From that:
[11429] Thus in light mandala,
[11430] Whoever person gains enlightenment,
[11431] This by fortunate great mind,
[11432] By emanation to ten directions,
[11433] Does beings' benefit by nature—
[11434] This does, dakini.
[11435] Fourth, sound—four aspects:
[11436] Essence, division, cause, and result measure.
[11437] Sound essence: resounding in ear faculty.
[11438] Division: though exist pleasant, unpleasant, middle etcetera, here slow continuity long peaceful drum-sound and fierce short wrathful thunder-sound two—called hum and thug.
[11439] Cause: general cause from condition of two clashing in sky gap, here arises from cause of obtaining stability.
[11440] Result: obtaining sambhogakaya and from that emanation spreading.
[11441] That slow continuity long hum obtains stability from peaceful kaya in samadhi seven days; hum thug stack fierce short liberates to wrathful kaya.
[11442] That two also exist in five races.
[11443] Examining sign of liberating in whatever five race: if resounds east of yogin died place or corpse direction, vajra race; south, jewel race; west, lotus race; north, action race; if arises up, accomplishes buddha of thus-gone race.
[11444] From Blazing Relics:
[11445] Where died place house,
[11446] East direction near,
[11447] Sound very resounds,
[11448] This becomes vajra race.
[11449] Likewise south direction,
[11450] Sound appears jewel race.
[11451] West lotus likewise.
[11452] North becomes action race.
[11453] Likewise up thus-gone.
[11454] Sound nature this-like:
[11455] Hum thug stack and
[11456] Continuity long gentle long sound,
[11457] By peaceful wrathful distinction.
[11458] Thus possessing sound,
[11459] This sambhogakaya,
[11460] Able kaya result.
[11461] That all equal sambhogakaya measure.
[11462] Thus also sambhogakaya,
[11463] Able to emit emanation kaya,
[11464] By method of able accord enter,
[11465] This ground final-reach.
[11466] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11467] Sound also two:
[11468] If hum arises, complete buddha in seven days;
[11469] If thug arises, complete buddha in fourteen days.
[11470] Fifth, movement—four aspects:
[11471] Essence, cause, division, and result.
[11472] Essence: vessel under ground supporting and lifting beings.
[11473] Cause: that person's power moves wind, moving.
[11474] Division: four—very moving, greatly moving, all very moving.
[11475] Result: common person, bodhisattva race etcetera, and though not seeing this door, death in preliminary training, or some conceptual object, or common labelled liberation labelled person doing faith and diligence in path, life transfer signs.
[11476] That breath separate immediately, if moves center, obtains sravaka noble ground white form seeing, dwells purifying later seven; that race and eighth and seeing and diminish and done realize and sravaka and pratyekabuddha ground—eight inferior grounds.
[11477] Death three days, if moves east, obtains pratyekabuddha ground. This—stream-enterer, once-returner, never-returner, arhat ground—four.
[11478] Death six days, if moves south, bodhisattva ground. This—great joy, stainless, light-maker, light-radiant, difficult-training, manifest, far-gone, immovable, excellent wisdom, dharma-cloud—ten cause grounds, all-light result ground—eleven.
[11479] Death nine days, if moves up with little sound, obtains awareness-holder ground. This—maturation ground and
[11480] Page 271 - Liturgical Translation
[11481] The Grounds of Power and Spontaneity
[11482] Four there are: the ground of power over life, the ground of the Great Seal, and the ground of spontaneous accomplishment. Yet these persons do not swiftly attain the fruit; having first obtained their respective grounds, they must remain for long periods training to bring them to perfection, as proclaimed in the Blazing Reliquary Tantra:
[11483] When earth trembles at the time
[11484] A being separates from breath,
[11485] This one obtains the sravaka ground.
[11486] Likewise, should it tremble in three days,
[11487] The self-same ground gives rise to motion—
[11488] This is the pratyekabuddha's ground.
[11489] When in six days it comes to be,
[11490] This is the bodhisattva's ground,
[11491] Entering therein, O dakini.
[11492] If in nine days it should come
[11493] That earth does tremble and transform,
[11494] This one has power to freely roam
[11495] The ground of the vidya-dhara.
[11496] Yet buddhahood's fruit does not appear
[11497] To one endowed with trembling grounds;
[11498] Thus in grounds and paths alike
[11499] Long cultivation must one dwell.
[11500] Those of scant learning nowadays, failing to understand that the vehicles' entry-paths are distinct, apply all grounds of the causal vehicle's path and stages only to the nature of causes. This resembles calculating for all travelers the days required to reach Lhasa based only on the days needed by burden-bearers—yet not all can be indicated thus. Just as horsemen, swift-footed ones, birds, and others cover in a few days what takes the heavily-burdened long periods, so too slower ones take more time—these are not certain.
[11501] Likewise, the methods and wisdom-activities of each path should be understood by the wise and discerning.
[11502] The second topic concerns the signs of birth-taking by the six realms' confusion. This has two aspects: the general arrangement and the presentation of actual signs.
[11503] First: For all sentient beings there are two paths to go, two results—making four in all. Without the intermediate state of dharmata and the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible. Without the two—the buddha-return and the being-return—there is no destination.
