[9760] In two truths,
[9761] Of mind and mental-event, three realms',
[9762] Superimposing aspect is concept.
[9763] Thus it is spoken.
[9764] From Treasury:
[9765] "Concept and examine coarse-subtle."
[9766] Thus explained as abandonment, entering together all meaning—this great essential point should be realized by those possessing supreme holy wisdom intelligence.
[9767] Also, need one like this for meeting baseless outer-inner.
[9768] Second, establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point:
[9769] When not seizing essence by examining mind,
[9770] Not becoming like inert,
[9771] Though declaring not knowing spread-spread clear without essence seize,
[9772] Give introduction as inner Dharma-space of Dharma-ceasing, arising primordially pure, stain-free space of self-clear empty self-tone manner,
[9773] Realization of limit-free, stain-free arises from within.
[9774] Seeing also secondary appearance of luminosity space-appear by familiarizing in that manner.
[9775] From Introduction Ornament:
[9776] By empty not-existing from-beginning,
[9777] Element self-ceasing, light-appearance ray.
[9778] By empty free of action-agent,
[9779] Obtain light-appearance indicating three bodies.
[9780] Thus it is spoken.
[9781] Third, establishing supreme awareness by secret space's essential point:
[9782] That mind-pure empty in space is not mere empty extreme,
[9783] Clear — snap,
[9784] Give introduction to Dharma-body free from stain, wisdom of awareness by individual self-clear self-clear.
[9785] Not going to extreme from awareness portion,
[9786] Not going to eternal by thing not-existing,
[9787] Placed in decided manner in great vast limit-free expanse of not-two-both and not-two-both by nowhere declaring.
[9788] Self-appear awareness self-tone nadi-thread with bindu.
[9789] From that same source:
[9790] By awareness abiding in base,
[9791] Meet space of gathered Dharma-nature.
[9792] By awareness holding characteristic,
[9793] Meet pure complete space.
[9794] By nadi-thread awareness,
[9795] Meet light space of nature.
[9796] Thus it is spoken.
[9797] Thus giving introduction to baseless appearance field.
[9798] Transcend samsara of appearance field's container-contents.
[9799] Giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[9800] Knowing object of self-dissolving arise-liberate.
[9801] Giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[9802] Cut root of grasp-hold delusion.
[9803] Giving introduction of empty as space-awareness,
[9804] Rolling experience of three bodies into one,
[9805] For obtaining perfect Buddha in one life,
[9806] Demonstrating introduction of delusion reversing manner from mind as very important.
[9807] By example introduction:
[9808] Meaning of wisdom of awareness existing in self,
[9809] Demonstrating sign confidence by awakening mind's lamp.
[9810] From that same source:
[9811] Holding measure of all Buddhas,
[9812] Examine example wisdoms.
[9813] Holding measure of sign wisdom,
[9814] Examine lamp of empty bindu.
[9815] Holding measure of meaning wisdom,
[9816] Examine clear manifest appearance.
[9817] Thus it is spoken.
[9818] Briefly summarized:
[9819] Outer appearance field baseless,
[9820] Giving introduction of mind of holding that appearance as empty,
[9821] Knowing samsara delusion as one groundless,
[9822] Not sufficient by that,
[9823] Giving introduction manifestly to meaning of root awareness, giving introduction without gathering-separation of space-awareness,
[9824] Instruction to supreme excellent intelligences: should deliver to primordially pure Dharma-body.
[9825] Second meaning: introduction of self-appear wisdom has two aspects:
[9826] Distinction of sense-power of instruction object,
[9827] And sequence of instruction introduction.
[9828] First:
[9829] Dividing best, middle, and last three sense-powers into sevens makes twenty-one.
[9830] Those all also: wisdom,
[9831] Purification,
[9832] Different liberation.
[9833] First, called "best":
[9834] Portion of wisdom and realization.
[9835] Also dividing that, seven:
[9836] Best's last and
[9837] Best's middle and
[9838] Best's best and
[9839] Best's advanced and
[9840] Best's supreme and
[9841] Best's peak and
[9842] Best's end reaching.
[9843] Placing those all from portion of easily realizing self-appear.
[9844] Also seven for middle:
[9845] Middle's last and
[9846] Middle's middle and
[9847] Middle's best and
[9848] Middle's advanced and
[9849] Middle's supreme and
[9850] Middle's peak and
[9851] Middle's end reaching.
[9852] Likewise, also seven for last:
[9853] Last's last and
[9854] Last's middle and
[9855] Last's best and
[9856] Last's supreme and
[9857] Last's advanced and
[9858] Last's peak and
[9859] Last's peak complete.
[9860] Second:
[9861] Thus twenty-one sense-powers arise, twenty-one introductions also arise.
[9862] That also, from individually giving introduction, two:
[9863] Common distinction,
[9864] Distinct indicative manner.
[9865] First:
[9866] To three: light, wisdom, awareness,
[9867] Giving introduction as seven groups.
[9868] From Vajra-Mind Heart Mirror Tantra:
[9869] Awareness transcends from base,
[9870] Should know twenty-one introductions—example meaning introduction etc.—for making known entering path.
[9871] Snow or
[9872] Conch or
[9873] One crystal without stain arising from ocean:
[9874] Extend to window's appearance,
[9875] Five colors of light spontaneously arise.
[9876] Also, what are those?
[9877] Blue color and
[9878] White and
[9879] Yellow and
[9880] Red and
[9881] Green.
[9882] That person following one crystal: hold right eye with right hand,
[9883] Place on eye's top, appearance will be seen; block left eye with left hand.
[9884] That is example introduction.
[9885] Meaning thus abides in self's heart center.
[9886] That is meaning introduction.
[9887] Press eye with self's thumb, sign: bindu of light arises like fish eye.
[9888] That is sign introduction.

[9892] Place Thus-come body drawn on cloth before self,
[9893] Place crystal on eye's top,
[9894] Look eye to sky,
[9895] Enjoyment complete body possessing mouth, eye, ear will be seen.
[9897] Giving introduction to emanation body:
[9898] Make know essence: dharma-possessor appearing as sign is miracle of self-awareness.
[9899] Make know as mass of self's light rays on Dharma day.
[9900] Make know essence without abandoning this interior of concept habit-continuum.
[9901] That is emanation body's introduction.
[9902] That root bind method introduction of appearance arising in self-manner.
[9903] Thus seven aspects called "light introduction."
[9904] What is wisdom's introduction?
[9905] Examining essence of copper vessel: introduction of Dharma space's wisdom.
[9906] Fill copper vessel well with water,
[9907] Place clear-making mirror on eye's top, look:
[9908] Bindu and
[9909] Arising as bindu particle manner,
[9910] Also from that, light and
[9911] Emanate like weapon point.
[9912] That is Dharma space's wisdom introduction.
[9913] What is mirror-like wisdom's introduction?
[9914] Draw dust-color mandala between two silver mirrors,
[9915] Place mirror each on two near sides comparing interval,
[9916] From that, two appearances arise.

[9920] Seize essence on lamp.
[9921] Introduction of action-accomplishing wisdom:

[9923] Introduction of non-abiding wisdom:
[9924] Seize essence by sky rainbow.
[9925] Introduction of completely complete wisdom:
[9926] Seize essence by cloudless sky.
[9927] Those seven are wisdom's introduction.
[9928] Now demonstrating awareness's introduction:
[9929] Introduction of awareness youth vase body:
[9930] Place one wearing white clothes before self,
[9931] Place jewel on eye's top,
[9932] Extend eye to sky and look.
[9933] Will see Thus-come's peaceful body.
[9934] That is introduction of awareness vase body.
[9935] Introduction of awareness youth hero power-possessing body:
[9936] Place one wearing black clothes in house's darkness before self,
[9937] Look like above,
[9938] Will see Thus-come's wrathful body.
[9939] Introduction of awareness base-abiding:
[9940] Seize essence on clear ocean.
[9941] Introduction of awareness all-clear:

[9946] Seize essence on like sun-moon obscured by cloud.
[9947] Introduction of awareness not abiding in anything:
[9948] Should know by looking eye to space-between.
[9949] Thus seven are awareness's introduction.
[9950] Having completed twenty-one thus,
[9951] At the time when that Buddha-family son passes from nirvana,
[9952] Awareness arises from eye path, enters intermediate appearance. Thus it is spoken.
[9953] Second, two aspects of distinctive indicative manner:
[9954] Briefly demonstrating introduction's condensation,
[9955] And extensively separating that nature.
[9956] First:
[9957] Demonstrate confidence-indicative example of seven last sense-powers by seven introductions to light and wisdom,

[10133] At wisdom, three—essence, nature, compassion.
[10134] At body: self-single, father-mother.
[10135] Three collections.
[10136] At bindu: three—base, path, fruit.
[10137] At awareness: three—base-abiding, characteristic-holding, field-appearance.
[10138] At space: two—outer, inner; demonstrating by sixteen enumeration of introduction.
[10139] To all small elaboration: three—example, meaning, sign.
[10140] To all very free from elaboration: meeting essence by manifest single appearance.
[10141] From that same source:
[10142] For purpose of all great ones,
[10143] By twenty-one introductions,
[10144] Gather that from outer to inner.
[10145] Also gathered: these all.
[10146] At light, two; at wisdom, three.

[10158] To abiding by manifest continuum,
[10159] By self seeing self heart-essence,
[10160] What do by all other efforts?
[10161] Should familiarize with this itself.
[10162] Thus it is spoken.
[10163] Abandoning inner scriptural contradiction:
[10164] From Jewel Intricate Display:
[10165] Alas, Buddha-family son, after I completely pass from nirvana,
[10166] At the time of five hundred degenerations,
[10167] By those possessing deceiving child's nature,
[10168] The time arises of making confidence in Buddha's intention through example.
[10169] At that time, this secret tantra of self arises.
[10170] True awareness itself cannot be demonstrated by example.
[10171] To five lights of nature existing as self-nature,
[10172] Though demonstrating five lights of image, will not become Buddha.
[10173] Question: Is example introduction not blocked?
[10174] That is: without seeing meaning of manifest awareness, mind-examining-holding—some say awareness's example is like this, like sky;
[10175] Some say different elements;
[10176] Some say light;
[10177] Demonstrate by god's body.
[10178] Common vehicle general,
[10179] Making only pure nature of low for some portions of outer-inner secret,
[10180] To negate base of primordially pure awareness,
[10181] Is spoken for negating grasping at thing's self-characteristic.
[10182] At this occasion demonstrating meaning of secret heart essence,
[10183] However much demonstrating example, no deviation,
[10184] No grasping place.
[10185] Those seeing manifest awareness, though introduction only as that's helper,
[10186] Again essence,
[10187] Expansion,
[10188] By dissolve manner, like crystal, great open primordially pure—demonstrate by crystal above pure,
[10189] With suitability.
[10190] That tantra also demonstrates this little, speaks thus.
[10191] From that same source:
[10192] Indicative example of Vajra-Mind:
[10193] White color, moon's color,
[10194] Etc., thus demonstrating awareness by three: example, sign, meaning,
[10195] Demonstrating birthless, ceaseless, open expanse.
[10196] Then this introduction suitable to sense-power:
[10197] With experience-taking hand-guidance,
[10198] Without deviation place, without stagnate place,
[10199] Ear lineage and hand gesture together,
[10200] Confidence,
[10201] Cutting superimposition,
[10202] Connecting word and meaning.
[10203] Supreme introduction spoken for demonstrating place of Buddha's Dharma lineage.
[10204] ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[10205] Demonstrating by relying on difficult introduction of vajra place,
[10206] The twenty-first chapter.
[10207] Thus having extensively demonstrated sequence of taking experience,
[10208] Now, demonstrating sequence of determining signs of yogin experience-taker has three aspects:
[10209] Generally demonstrating meaning of how purifying signs in former life now abide in body, speech, mind;
[10210] Explaining distinction of arising manner to three-door appearance possessing signs of now entering path.
[10211] Summarizing conclusion with secret signs of determining liberation-delusion in intermediate and after.
[10212] First has three:
[10213] Signs of how previously purifying body, speech, mind by body;
[10214] Signs of how familiarizing by speech;
[10215] Signs of how training by mind.
[10216] First:
[10217] Four for demonstrating now those signs of purifying through body gate to three body, speech, mind in former life by obstacle:
[10218] Sign sequence,
[10219] Arising suitability,
[10220] Fruit if familiar,
[10221] Not obtaining certainty if not familiar.
[10222] First:
[10223] From Glorious Sky Without Great Blazing Body Tantra:
[10224] How all perfect Buddhas'
[10225] Body's signs and speech's signs,
[10226] Likewise vajra mind's signs,
[10227] Like formerly arising,
[10228] Here also on all sentient beings' bodies
[10229] These all will appear.
[10230] To whoever this itself appears,
[10231] Fortune of purifying before,
[10232] From not ripening before,
[10233] Now time certain fruit:
[10234] To that person accomplishing by whoever,
[10235] Body's signs and likewise speech,
[10236] Mind etc.—these signs arise.
[10237] Thus it is spoken.
[10238] Signs of purifying to Buddha body in former life: in forehead center of born man or woman—conch swirling right or three-point-like frown vertical,
[10239] All OM marks,
[10240] Lines or
[10241] Existing as self-protrusion.
[10242] Signs of purifying to speech: right throat of born man,
[10243] In woman's left—eight-petal lotus or
[10244] Conch swirling right or
[10245] Like silk tongue or
[10246] Hook and
[10247] Sword and
[10248] All AH marks—lines or
[10249] Arising as self-protrusion.
[10250] Signs of extensive mind: in heart center—vajra and
[10251] Wheel and
[10252] Three points' complexion or
[10253] Jewel shape or
[10254] Together with letter aspect HUM.
[10255] Second, suitability of those signs arising:
[10256] Now arising by former purification: three body, speech, mind existing in self from base in all beings.
[10257] From that same source:
[10258] Also to butcher, prostitute, without fortune:
[10259] Three body, speech, mind exist from base,
[10260] Having familiarized before from that,
[10261] Entering obstacle above,
[10262] Signs of above body, speech, mind
[10263] Arise also in all this.
[10264] Thus it is spoken.
[10265] Third, manner of obtaining fruit by familiarizing:
[10266] Liberating into three body, speech, mind quickly if effort in this life by possessing those signs.
[10267] Also, if now purifying to body having body's signs, obtain vajra body in two lives;
[10268] Accomplishing speech vajra in two births by speech;
[10269] Accomplishing in three by familiarizing to mind.
[10270] Determining knowledge of fruit of sign and familiarizing:
[10271] From Body Blaze:
[10272] Who purified to Sugata body,
[10273] Also in that forehead space:
[10274] Conch swirling right,
[10275] Or three-point frown vertical,
[10276] Likewise also letter OM,
[10277] Line or self-protrusion.
[10278] Person to whom this sign arises:
[10279] Before purified to Buddha body,
[10280] That yogin purifying this,
[10281] Not separate from Buddha body,
[10282] At self time possessing confidence,
[10283] Will obtain in two lives.
[10284] Not entering obstacle to this,
[10285] Diligent in meditation itself,
[10286] This itself is very important.
[10287] To all Buddhas' speech:
[10288] That person purified before,
[10289] To fortune-possessing,
[10290] In that throat's right-left:
[10291] Eight-petal lotus or
[10292] Or conch swirling right,
[10293] Likewise extending silk tongue or
[10294] Hook or sword and
[10295] Marked by letter AH,
[10296] Line itself or protrusion.
[10323] Long time of beginningless habit-continuum,
[10324] Immediate non-virtue arising near,
[10325] By karma's force strong,
[10326] From only possessing former signs,
[10327] Not protecting by that, after,
[10328] By karma mixed various of former little virtue and now,
[10329] Sign-possessing body: form,
[10330] Speech: distinction from that, Brahma caste,
[10331] Sign-possessing mind: birth in demigod.
[10332] From that same source:
[10333] From obstacle in this itself,
[10334] Not obtaining fruit itself,
[10335] From mind, mind-disturbing place,
[10336] From body, likewise form realm god,
[10337] To speech, Brahma place.
[10338] Thus it is spoken.
[10339] Second, also to manner of three now signs arising by how familiarized by speech:
[10340] If sign arises, making diligent yogin to three body, speech, mind,
[10341] Obtain liberation in two lives,
[10342] Not obtaining otherwise.
[10343] Sign and that nature:
[10344] From that same source:
[10345] Also to all sentient beings like that,
[10346] To three Buddha bodies before,
[10347] Also as sign of familiarizing and purifying,
[10348] Thus arise, sky-goer.
[10349] To all Buddhas' body itself,
[10350] Of whoever familiarized before,
[10351] Stable spoken words,
[10352] Also without change from ceasing.
[10385] Again from that same source:
[10386] Whatever being in whose mind possesses these signs,
[10387] Toward the buddha's kaya, speech, and mind also,
[10388] By this I teach familiarity.
[10389] Unlearned meditation self-descends,
[10390] And the mind obtains ease by its nature.
[10391] By this, previously familiar with the kaya,
[10392] Dharmas appear to the mind through thought,
[10393] And seeing objects not seen before,
[10394] Words of dharma not heard before
[10395] Are known as the nature.
[10396] By this, previously familiar
[10397] With the buddha's speech, O Dakini.
[10398] Always dwelling alone,
[10399] Without fearful mind toward anything,
[10400] The person roaming mountains and forests—
[10401] By this, previously also familiar
[10402] With the mind, O Dakini.
[10403] Such a person possessing these,
[10404] If practicing truth without gap,
[10405] Without obstacle in three lives
[10406] Will doubtlessly attain buddhahood.
[10407] Thus it is said.
[10408] These signs, primordially abiding in body, speech, and mind by nature, are clearly sent through familiarity in previous lives.
[10409] Not having reached the end of that very thing,
[10410] Having become an obstacle, they arise in this life.
[10411] Here also, if without effort, it is called uncertain,
[10412] Entering other existences through the power of different karma.
[10413] These signs, through familiarity with mind apprehending and holding meaning, arise in many beings—birds, wild animals,
[10414] Dogs, horses, and so forth—through training the white kaya, speech, and mind in previous lives.
[10415] Born into lower existence beings through black karma,
[10416] From later on depending on present actions,
[10417] Practicing the supreme truth dharma in the present is essential.
[10418] Again from that:
[10419] Thus in family and not family,
[10420] By the force of previous familiarity,
[10421] These signs arise in the body.
[10422] Birds, wild animals, dogs, and so forth,
[10423] In apprehending animal forms,
[10424] These signs arise.
[10425] Previously trained, now obstacles.
[10426] Thus it is said.
[10427] Second meaning: explaining particular signs of those who have entered the path in the present, in two parts:
[10308] Hear now the signs that mark the path of awakening—the common general signs known to all, and the supreme secret signs of the uncommon vehicle, made manifest through direct realization.
[10309] Of the first, there are three aspects:
[10310] Signs of confusion, where mind deceives itself through self-created delusion;
[10311] Signs of failing to reach the essential point of oral instruction, bringing uncertainty;
[10312] Signs of demonic obstacles, when direct awareness remains unseized.
[10313] The first category manifests even in those who have not entered practice—ordinary beings, birds, and wild creatures alike may display these transient transformations, yet they remain meaningless, mere signs of circumstance.
[10314] The second category arises during engagement with common vehicles, through preliminary training, or when conceptual minds undertake view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. To distinguish between deviation and correct path, I shall explain.
[10315] From among the one hundred and sixteen signs, fifty arise in body, speech, and mind with uncertain measure:
[10316] Examination and skill with words, self-arising;
[10317] Knowing others' minds in part;
[10318] Seeing divine forms;
[10319] Relics falling upon the body;
[10320] Power arising in speech;

[10329] Clarity of sense-faculties;
[10330] Great happiness beyond the ordinary;

[10332] Exceptional joy;
[10333] Increasing awareness;
[10334] Constant desire to sing from the heart;
[10335] Longing to wander;
[10336] Eyes not attaching to others;
[10337] Swiftness of foot;
[10338] Mind expanding into openness;
[10339] Constant transformation of awareness;
[10340] Mind not settling into one-pointedness;
[10341] Fine analysis of words through examination;
[10342] Hearing the voices of dakinis;
[10343] Dwelling with people of borderlands, experiencing their ways;
[10344] Heart trembling always;
[10345] Body hair standing upright;
[10346] Letters self-arising from fingernail centers;
[10347] Teeth growing even in old age;
[10348] Showing blessings upon others' bodies;
[10349] Leaping into sky while legs crossed;
[10350] Wheels existing in palm centers;
[10351] Nets connecting the toes;
[10352] Light emanating from the mouth;
[10353] Feelings of coming and going;
[10354] Knowing emanation of body into animal forms;
[10355] Small relics falling from limbs;
[10356] Behold—gods and asuras appearing to fight;
[10357] Knowing letters and designs previously unknown;
[10358] Sounds emanating from the eyes;
[10359] Able to converse with non-human beings;

[10362] Knowing when others' elements will stir;
[10363] Fire sparks emanating from the body;
[10364] Wondrous sounds arising from clapping palms.
[10365] Of dream signs bringing uncertainty, sixty-six in number:
[10366] Always teaching dharma in dreams,
[10367] Listening,
[10368] Reading,
[10369] Holding,
[10370] Meditating,
[10371] Seeing divine forms,

[10424] Dreaming of the gods' lord placing one upon a four-footed jewel throne, lifting into sky and traveling;
[10425] Dreaming of naga lords raining jewels upon oneself;
[10426] Dreaming of bardo visions arising;
[10427] Dreaming of sitting upon an elephant, four powerful men lifting by the four feet, rising through sky's depths;
[10428] Dreaming of dwelling atop a golden wheel, leaping three times into sky.
[10429] Thus spoke the Blazing Relics Tantra Commentary.
[10430] Of the third, signs of obstacles:
[10431] Knowing emanation of body into various forms;
[10432] Light emanating from the body;
[10433] Sounds arising in whatever direction one goes;
[10434] Power entering others;
[10435] Gatherings assembling;
[10436] Crafting superimpositions of words.
[10437] When these signs greatly manifest in a person, they indicate obstacles arising. In such times, sit in water mandala, insert a sixteen-finger wooden stick into the nape, smear the body with sandalwood oil, and meditate coarsely upon outer and inner things—this certainly dispels.
[10438] When knowing emanation from demonic blessings, examine and see the second reflection. Wash the body with dharani water, utter PHAT, and meditate on emptiness like sky—this dispels.
[10439] Moreover, when a yogin thinks they have realized reality without truly realizing it, demons of bliss enter. Realizing all as empty, entering the profane, thinking action and result cannot harm—know this is demonic deception.
[10440] When flesh-eating dakinis prophesy before one, when gatherings and the like accomplish small siddhis, when dakinis converse and formless sounds speak of good and bad, expound dharma—these come with subtle clairvoyance and conceit.
[10441] Knowing all these as demonic obstacles, dwell in creation-completion or accumulate great merit and make aspirations, or meditate on emptiness—this liberates.
[10442] From Awareness Self-Arisen:
[10443] When engaging mouth-words without realizing depth, becoming like madness—know this is obstacle demon. Abandon great gatherings and enter practice. Or if mindfulness is lost, this is the sign of not seeing vision—reverse the three roots.
[10444] When dakinis prophesy, this is experience-vision—settle intent upon that.
[10445] Of prophecy, there are two:
[10446] Dakini coming under one's power,
[10447] Self coming under dakini's power.
[10448] When dakini comes under one's power, all actions accomplish and deeds complete.
[10449] The method to bring dakinis under one's power: when prophecy comes during practice, do not generate attachment or joyful mind toward that, do not hold that as true—then dakini comes under one's power.
[10450] That one cannot show any meaning. Wisdom-pure dakinis do not appear in the world. Flesh-eating action dakinis come to the world, inspecting practitioners' places. They cannot liberate because form does not clearly appear.
[10451] For the authentic path, dakinis gave me the life essence at once.
[10452] When self comes under dakini's power, holding that prophecy as true, always holding to that prophecy, conducting oneself without attachment to body, saying one has transcended the extreme of result being or not-being—following that prophecy is obstacle demon approaching.
[10453] Know demonic deception at that time.
[10454] Of the second, uncommon supreme secret signs made manifest—three aspects:
[10455] General showing of body, speech, and mind signs of preliminary training;
[10456] Particular explanation of clear-light signs of main training;
[10457] Expression of other distinctions of signs, grasping the measure of the path.
[10458] Of the first, from three aspects:
[10459] Signs of nose-training of three kayas, preliminary training of four elements' sound and meaning.
[10460] From Blazing Relics:
[10461] What sounds of elements,
[10462] Who is familiar with sounds of six races,
[10463] Elements do not harm this,
[10464] Likewise fire does not burn,
[10465] Water does not drown nor carry away,
[10466] Foot not touching ground,
[10467] Able to go through mid-space,
[10468] Wind does not chill nor shake—
[10469] Thus in whom these arise,
[10470] Is familiar with four elements' sounds.
[10471] Signs of mind nose-training, preliminary training measure of body, speech, and mind:
[10472] From that:
[10473] Knowing in an instant
[10474] Beings appearing and not appearing,
[10475] Because six races do not take form,
[10476] Know sounds of six beings,
[10477] Because six beings' mind-continuum is self-cut,
[10478] Know all their thoughts,
[10479] Because confusion thought is exhausted—
[10480] Briefly, six clairvoyances arise,
[10481] Six beings' appearance
[10482] Abides in own nature,
[10483] Cutting later birth-continuum.
[10484] Thus this person cuts,
[10485] All these own signs arise.
[10486] Signs of awareness nose-training, separating samsara-nirvana border:
[10487] From that also:
[10488] Before separating samsara-nirvana border,
[10489] Body, speech, and mind go,
[10490] Familiar in conduct,
[10491] Thus tantra signs arise.
[10492] Body attachment self-reverses,
[10493] Confusion attachment continuum cuts,
[10494] No attachment to own body,
[10495] Conduct in sky,
[10496] Likewise able to enter ground,
[10497] Knowing thought and non-thought meaning,
[10498] Dharma also speaks from mouth.
[10499] Thus in whom these arise,
[10500] By body, speech, and mind,
[10501] Is liberated from all
[10502] Samsara realization bondage,
[10503] Later body, speech, mind connection cuts.
[10504] Of the second meaning, particular explanation of main signs—two aspects:
[10505] General showing of common view-meditation signs;
[10506] Particular explanation of direct clear-light signs.
[10507] Of the first:
[10508] View free of extremes, trained like sky, going through sky, circumambulating Jambudvipa in an instant;
[10509] Solid things dissolving when gazed upon.
[10510] Meditation of self-settled clarity, trained samadhi, wondrous signs of body, speech, and mind arise.
[10511] From Blazing Relics:
[10512] Signs of familiarity with view:
[10513] Upon the fortunate person,
[10514] These likewise arise.
[10515] Because emptiness expands body and mind,
[10516] Like dakinis in sky,
[10517] Turning self-control over wind,
[10518] Able to travel all Jambudvipa
[10519] In six hundred instants like wind,
[10520] Because own-mind realizes emptiness,
[10521] Able to dissolve whatever is gazed upon.
[10522] This gains great confidence in view.
[10523] Signs of training in meditation:
[10524] No insects on body,
[10525] Because compassion completes other benefit,
[10526] Because concept mind-continuum is empty,
[10527] Body becomes like cotton,
[10528] Because awareness possesses deathless meaning,
[10529] Body becomes like sixteen years passed.
[10530] Because reality moisture pervades mind,
[10531] Hair becomes oily.
[10532] Thus mind does not wander,
[10533] Sits where placed,
[10534] Cannot enter confusion objects.
[10535] This gains meditation oneself,
[10536] Obtains buddhahood in two lives.
[10537] These are certain signs of conceptual object beings.
[10538] Of the second, particular explanation of direct clear-light signs—five aspects:
[10539] Light, expanse, bindu, kaya, and awareness trained to measure.
[10540] Of the first, light—five aspects:
[10541] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[10542] Light's essence shows awareness tone.
[10543] Definition: appearing clear, therefore light.
[10544] Division: own-characteristic daytime-holding light, wisdom five own-tone, and light of measure of familiarity from practice increasing above direct experience until reaching measure—two aspects.
[10545] Characteristic: self-illuminating without depending on other illuminators.
[10546] Result: becoming condition for buddhahood in inconceivable dharma-expanse state.
[10547] Familiarizing with such light, confusion-appearance liberates into clear-light, special signs of body and speech appear.
[10548] From Blazing Relics:
[10549] Who is familiar with light,
[10550] In self-seen activity-field,
[10551] Earth, water, fire, and wind—
[10552] Four-elements appearance self-dissolves,
[10553] Gradually enjoying five colors.
[10554] Signs not separate from this,
[10555] In others' seen activity-field,
[10556] Like madness, obstacle-free,
[10557] Without attachment to whatever,
[10558] Transparently penetrating mountain rocks,
[10559] Likewise appearing to enter ground depths,
[10560] Transparently penetrating all waters,
[10561] Body without clothes,
[10562] Naked, obstacle-free to whatever,
[10563] Food and desires self-free—
[10564] This upon this appearance,
[10565] Elements dissolve to self-place,
[10566] Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[10567] Without doubt obtain result.
[10568] As outer appearance experience-signs,
[10569] So inner awareness arises.
[10570] Signs of nirvana arise when person enters path without error.
[10571] From Self-Arisen:
[10572] Ride changeless awareness horse,
[10573] Always look at correct light,
[10574] Teacher's words indicate great meaning,
[10575] Correctly hold this measure of seeing awareness king,
[10576] Obtain happiness dwelling alone,
[10577] Because own-appearance arises as companion,
[10578] Accord with others' minds,
[10579] Because not separate from own that,
[10580] Become without attachment and clinging,
[10581] Because going to own ground,
[10582] Not become hostile to whatever,
[10583] Because gaining own meaning,
[10584] Even like cotton leaf,
[10585] Because worms and insects are free.
[10586] Signs of familiarity with expanse—five aspects:
[10587] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[10588] Essence: vast, pervading great, clear by nature, self-clear.
[10589] Definition: called center, called expanse—the nature of reality things, vast, without end.
[10590] Division: outer expanse sky, inner expanse lamp, secret expanse light and bindu, unsurpassed expanse great appearance of confusion-appearance self-ceasing.
[10591] According to rank: awareness, wisdom, three kayas, result object.
[10592] Characteristic: vast and opening, able to appear, pervading, appearing as clear object, like clear mirror expanse.
[10593] Briefly: not reality thing, produces power to clearly appear as object making reality appear.
[10594] Result: depending on not-mistakenly understanding reality object, seeing reality own essence, making direct non-change into path, buddhahood.
[10595] Familiarizing with such expanse, wondrous outer signs appear as experience.
[10596] From Blazing Relics:
[10597] Who is familiar with expanse,
[10598] Outer-inner breath movement ceases,
[10599] Goes like bird in sky,
[10600] Likewise like fish in water—
[10601] This fortunate one goes,
[10602] And sees objects not seen before,
[10603] Continent and Meru together,
[10604] Sees from one sitting place,
[10605] Likewise buddha-fields
[10606] Not seen before,
[10607] All these sees at one time.
[10608] Thus possessing signs,
[10609] From this in sixteen months,
[10610] Dharma-expanse also sees.
[10611] Inner experience-signs:
[10612] From Vajrasattva's heart mirror,
[10613] These before-signs arise in that person:
[10614] Joyful experience sitting alone,
[10615] Body light like cotton leaf,
[10616] Heart not desiring human association,
[10617] Thinking of flying in sky,
[10618] Perception of joy when this appearance ceases,
[10619] No attachment to body and life,
[10620] Mind not entering whatever appearance,
[10621] Clear awareness not dull,
[10622] Awareness naturally slow,
[10623] Joy when associating,
[10624] Not able to be aroused by any affliction,
[10625] Not holding thought even when affliction arises,
[10626] Attachment not arising to beautiful forms,
[10627] Not hating ugly forms,
[10628] Perception of food and drink not arising through samadhi power,
[10629] Making others' minds not accord when associating with humans.
[10630] These are signs before complete nirvana.
[10631] Of the third, signs of familiarity with bindu—five aspects:
[10632] Bindu essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[10633] Essence: not different, dwelling as one, without duality.
[10634] Definition: bindu not-change, LE vast, greatly pervading all.
[10635] Division: body-dwelling channel bindu, nature path bindu, complete result bindu—three.
[10636] Of the first, conventional cause bindu white and red two, ultimate wisdom bindu five—two categories.
[10637] Wisdom bindu five and ground bindu good, light upper-bur, dwelling unmoved in general body channel.
[10638] From Result Exposition:
[10639] Body place is this:
[10640] In crown and heart channel,
[10641] Unfabricated pure reality dwells.
[10642] Path bindu good, moved by wisdom wind from within channel, goes.
[10643] Good bindu makes four lamps arise as object.
[10644] Good peak moves various wisdom analysis within channel.
[10645] Good bindu possessing ornament, depending on four lamps, shows appearance of increasing experience.
[10646] Nature path bindu is:
