[8491-8530] [STRUCTURE] Page 199 Analysis
**Analysis:** This page continues the exposition of theg mchog mdzod with detailed
examination of Dzogchen view, practice, and realization. Line range 8491-8530.
[8491] [STRUCTURE] # Structural Overview
**Analysis:** The page begins at line 8491 and extends through 8530,
presenting sequential development of the Dzogchen teachings on mind, appearance,
and liberation.
[8491-8493] [PHILOLOGY] Key Terminology
**Analysis:** Technical terms in this section require precise philological attention.
The Tibetan text employs standard Dzogchen vocabulary with specific nuances.
[8511] [CONTEXT] Doctrinal Context
**Analysis:** This section participates in the broader Nyingma doxographical discourse,
distinguishing Dzogchen view from lower vehicles through unique terminological choices.
[8491-8530] [CONCEPT] Philosophical Developments
**Analysis:** The conceptual framework presented here advances the understanding of:
1. Primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*)
2. Self-liberation (*rang grol*) of thoughts and appearances
3. Direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) to mind-nature
4. Great perfection (*rdzogs chen*) view and practice
[8531-8570] [STRUCTURE] Samādhi Progression and Gradual Attainment
**Analysis:** This page presents samādhi progression and addresses the gradual vs. sudden attainment issue. The structure includes citation on gradual perfection through familiarization with three bodies, followed by analysis of the non-sudden nature of realization despite Dzogchen's claim to suddenness.
[8531-8545] [PHILOLOGY] Gradual Perfection Citation
**Analysis:** The verse citation presents:
- *Ting 'dzin dang po cog gzhag gis*: first samādhi through mere settling
- *Sku gsum rim gyis goms pa yis*: through gradual familiarization with three bodies
- *Dngos po gshis kyi rnal 'byor la*: to yoga of entity-nature
- *Don 'dis mchog tu nye bar 'gyur*: becomes very near to supreme
Key terms:
- *Rim gyis*: gradual, in stages
- *Goms pa*: familiarization, habituation
- *Cog gzhag*: mere settling, resting
[8546-8548] [CONCEPT] The Paradox of Gradual Development
**Analysis:** The text presents a crucial paradox:
- *Cig car skye ba ma yin te*: not arising suddenly/instantly
- *'Di kun rim gyis blo yul lo*: all this is gradual, object of mind
This acknowledges that despite Dzogchen's emphasis on sudden recognition (*cig car*), the stabilization of that recognition occurs gradually.
[8549-8560] [CONTEXT] Three Bodies Familiarization
**Analysis:** The three bodies (*sku gsum*) progression:
1. First: attaining Nirmāṇakāya (*thog ma ting 'dzin sprul sku thob*)
2. Previously unseen dharmas appear spontaneously (*sngar ma mthong ba'i chos rnams bsams pa med par blo la 'char*)
3. Without grasping conceptual words (*ma bzung bzhin du*), mind clarifies
This represents the gradual path (*rim gyis*) even within Dzogchen.
[8561-8570] [STRUCTURE] Fruitional Experience
**Analysis:** The fruitional dimension:
- *Skyes bu skal dang ldan pa la*: for fortunate beings
- *Chos kyi ro yis sems rgyas pas*: mind expands through taste of Dharma
- *Rjes kyi las can du 'gyur*: becomes one with after-effect karma
The "taste of Dharma" (*chos kyi ro*) indicates non-conceptual fruitional experience that transforms the practitioner.
[8536-8540] [PHILOLOGY] *Nye bar 'gyur* and *Mchog*
**Analysis:** The phrase *mchog tu nye bar 'gyur* (becomes very near to supreme):
- *Mchog*: supreme, ultimate
- *Nye bar 'gyur*: approaches, becomes near
- Indicates progressive approximation to full awakening
This terminology bridges the apparent contradiction between Dzogchen's "already complete" view and the need for practice.
