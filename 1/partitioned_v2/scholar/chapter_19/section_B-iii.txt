[16115-16134] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terminology
**Analysis:** Key terminology in this section includes:
- *dbang po*: Primary technical term requiring philological precision
- *nges pa*: Particle usage (*kyis*, *las*) determines philosophical reading
- *sangs rgyas*: Contextual semantic field distinguishes Dzogchen usage
- *sprul pa*: Classical Tibetan grammatical conventions apply
[16135-16155] [CONTEXT] Doctrinal Framework
**Analysis:** This section participates in Nyingma doxographical discourse,
distinguishing capacity-based pedagogy (*dbang po dang sbyar ba*) across vehicles.
