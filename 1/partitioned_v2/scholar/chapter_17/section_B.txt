[10810-10824] [STRUCTURE] # Section: Signs of Nirvana Preceding
**Analysis:** This section concludes the enumeration of signs indicating approach to complete nirvana. The structure follows the standard fivefold analytical framework (ngo bo, nges tshig, dbye ba, mtshan nyid, 'bras bu) established earlier. The passage lists thirteen distinct signs of spiritual maturation before transitioning to the third major topic: bindu (thig le) familiarity signs.
[10810-10824] [CONCEPT] Preliminary Liberation Signs
**Analysis:** The enumerated signs include: (1) disinterest in human association, (2) sensation of flying in space, (3) joy at the thought of appearances ceasing, (4) non-attachment to body and life, (5) non-engagement with phenomena, (6) clarity without dullness, (7) natural spaciousness of awareness, (8) comfort in association, (9) inability of afflictions to arise, (10) non-grasping of arisen afflictions, (11) non-attachment to beautiful forms, (12) non-aversion to ugly forms, (13) absence of hunger/thirst perceptions through samadhi power, (14) discord with others' minds. These function as diagnostic indicators of progression toward yongs su mya ngan las 'da' ba (complete nirvana).
[10825] [STRUCTURE] # RIM_KHANG: Third Section - Bindu Familiarity Signs
**Analysis:** Major structural transition marked by "gsum pa" (third). The text moves from wind (rlung) and channel (rtsa) signs to bindu (thig le) analysis, maintaining the sequential progression through subtle body components.
[10826-10830] [STRUCTURE] Fivefold Analytical Framework
**Analysis:** Standard scholastic structure: (1) ngo bo (essence), (2) nges tshig (definition), (3) dbye ba (division), (4) mtshan nyid (characteristic), (5) 'bras bu (result). This framework derives from Indian pramana traditions adapted in Tibetan doxography.
[10831-10832] [PHILOLOGY] Bindu Essence Analysis
**Analysis:** "tha dad ma yin zhing gcig tu gnas pas zla dang bral ba" — The essence is defined through double negation: non-different (tha dad ma yin) yet not establishing oneness either (gcig tu gnas pas), resulting in freedom from both extremes (zla dang bral ba, literally "free from moons" or dualistic reference points).
[10834-10835] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of Thig-le
**Analysis:** The term is analyzed as "thig mi 'gyur ba" (the undrawn/unwavering dot) plus "le gdal ba chen pos kun la khyab pa" (the great vastness that pervades all). This represents a Dzogchen-specific etymology distinct from tantric bindu concepts of essence-drops.
[10836-10839] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Bindu Division
**Analysis:** (1) lus gnas rtsa'i thig le (body-dwelling channel bindu), (2) rang bzhin lam gyi thig le (nature path bindu), (3) mthar phyin 'bras bu'i thig le (complete result bindu). This tripartite structure maps bindu across ground, path, and fruition.
[10840-10842] [CONCEPT] Conventional and Ultimate Bindus
**Analysis:** First level subdivides into: (a) kun rdzob rgyu'i thig le dkar dmar gnyis (two conventional causal bindus, white and red), and (b) don dam ye shes kyi thig le lnga (five ultimate wisdom bindus). This reflects the standard two-truth framework applied to subtle body anatomy.
[10843-10860] [CONTEXT] Thalgyur Citation on Wisdom Bindus
**Analysis:** Citation from Thalgyur (Thal 'gyur) tantra enumerates six wisdom bindus: (1) chos nyid thig le, (2) kun tu bzang po'i thig le, (3) dbyings thig le, (4) dbyings rnam dag thig le, (5) ye shes thig le, (6) ye shes chen po'i thig le. These correspond to progressively refined levels of realization.
[10844] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Term: Gzhi'i thig le bzang po
**Analysis:** "Ground bindu of excellence" refers to the non-moving (mi g.yo) presence within the general channels of the body, described as 'od kyi gong bur (a sphere/ball of light). The term "bzang po" (excellent/good) distinguishes this from lower bindu manifestations.
[10846-10849] [CONTEXT] Thalgyur Quotation on Body Locations
**Analysis:** Verse citation: "spyi dang tsit+ta rtsa yi nang / ma bcos dag pa'i chos nyid gnas" — identifies the crown (spyi) and heart (tsitta) channels as locations where unfabricated pure reality dwells. Tsitta (Skt. citta) represents the heart-center as mind-ground in subtle body physiology.
[10855-10860] [CONCEPT] Six Wisdom Bindus Detailed
**Analysis:** The six wisdom bindus are: (1) chos nyid kyi thig le (reality bindu) — unconditioned and all-pervading, (2) kun tu bzang po'i thig le — appearing without good/bad or size distinctions, (3) dbyings kyi thig le — clear without outer/inner division, (4) dbyings rnam dag thig le — arising without deviation or obscuration, (5) ye shes kyi thig le — primordially unmade, (6) ye shes chen po'i thig le — appearing directly unobscured by any affliction. These represent the bindu dimension of kayas.
[10861-10863] [CONCEPT] Result Bindu (mthar phyin 'bras bu'i thig le)
**Analysis:** The resultant bindu is characterized as dharmakaya bindu — single (nyag gcig), free from elaboration (spros bral), beyond identification (ngos gzung dang bral ba), primordially pure essence (ka dag gi ngo bo), appearing as variety from that state without any establishment cause (grub rgyu gang yang med pa).
[10864-10874] [STRUCTURE] Characteristics of Bindu
**Analysis:** Five characteristics enumerated: (1) free from various pains (sna tshogs zug rngu dang bral ba), (2) round/spherical without elaboration (zlum po spros pa med pa), (3) displaying awareness-appearance as great transparent wisdom (rig pa'i snang ba ston pas ye shes zang thal chen po), (4) five rims gathered as one (mu khyud lnga gcig tu bzlums pas sku'i gnas yin), (5) beyond identification due to emptiness not established as substance (stong nyid rdzas su ma grub pas ngo bo ngos gzung las 'das pa).
[10870-10874] [CONCEPT] Five Resultant Qualities
**Analysis:** From these characteristics arise: (1) virtue appearing directionless (yon tan phyogs med du shar), (2) characteristics stainless (mtshan nyid la dri ma med), (3) capacity appearing unceasing as various play (rtsal ma 'gags par snang bas rol pa sna tshogs su shar), (4) essence self-pure due to non-duality in characteristics (mtshan nyid la gnyis su med pas ngo bo rang dag), (5) nature self-liberated through directionless reasoning (gtan tshigs phyogs med du shar bas gnas lugs rang grol ba).
[10875-10899] [CONTEXT] Relic Citation on Bindu Signs
**Analysis:** Extended citation from Sku gdung 'bar ba (Blazing Relics) tantra describing external signs of bindu realization. The verses indicate: (1) bindu lamp of emptiness arising without effort, (2) all as self-experience signs, (3) cutting word elaborations, (4) mind not entering others' thoughts even for an instant, (5) impossibility of speech for others, (6) decision through single non-elaboration.
[10890-10896] [PHILOLOGY] Rtsad chod (Decisive Certainty)
**Analysis:** The term "rtsad chod" (decisive settling/cutting) appears in line 10891: "spros med nyag gcig des rtsad chod" — decisively settled through single non-elaboration. This technical term indicates irreversible realization rather than intellectual understanding.
[10897-10899] [CONTEXT] Dissolution Citation
**Analysis:** Final verse citation: "'byung ba rang dengs sa / 'gyur ba 'di la the tshom med" — elements self-dissolve, change without doubt. This indicates the automatic dissolution of elements when bindu realization is achieved.
[10900] [STRUCTURE] # RIM_KHANG: Fourth Section - Kaya (sku)
**Analysis:** Major transition to fourth topic: the three kayas. Marked by "bzhi pa sku la" (fourth, on kayas). Maintains the fivefold analytical framework established in previous sections.
[10906] [PHILOLOGY] Kaya Essence Definition
**Analysis:** "rtag par gnas pa'i rang bzhin mya ngan las 'das pa'i chos rnams kyi rten du gnas pa'o" — essence defined as the support for all nirvana dharmas, possessing the nature of permanent abiding. The term "rtag par gnas pa" (permanent abiding) requires careful analysis: in Dzogchen, this indicates unconditioned stability (gnas lugs) rather than eternalist permanence.
[10908] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology: Dri med zang thal rang rdzogs chen po
**Analysis:** Definition as "stainless transparent-penetrate self-complete great" — dri med (stainless) negates afflictive obscurations, zang thal (transparent-penetrate) indicates unimpeded manifestation, rang rdzogs (self-complete) indicates spontaneous perfection without effort, chen po (great) indicates universality.
[10910-10912] [STRUCTURE] Three Kaya Division
**Analysis:** Standard triad: chos sku (dharmakaya), longs sku (sambhogakaya), sprul sku (nirmanakaya). This division appears across all Mahayana schools but receives distinct interpretation in Dzogchen.
[10913-10918] [CONTEXT] Dzogchen Distinction: Path Appearance vs. Result
**Analysis:** Critical doxographical distinction: common vehicles consider three kayas as fruition ('bras bur 'dod), while Great Perfection considers them as path appearances (lam gyi snang bar 'dod). This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on recognition during the path of what is ultimately the case.
[10915-10918] [CONCEPT] Dharmakaya as Self-Appearance
**Analysis:** Chos sku rang snang yin — dharmakaya is one's own appearance. The reasoning: as long as dharmas exist, mind exists, therefore it is path; as long as kayas exist, body exists, therefore it is path appearance. Not ultimate (mthar thug ma yin). This subordinates kayas to the path process rather than treating them as ontological endpoints.
[10919-10921] [CONCEPT] Exhaustion Appearance
**Analysis:** "dngos gzhi tshad phebs rdzogs nas / zad pa'i snang ba ste / ka dag la thim du nye ba" — when the main practice reaches complete measure, exhaustion appearance (zad pa'i snang ba) approaches dissolution into primordial purity. This technical term indicates the stage where phenomena no longer appear as solid/obstructing.
[10922-10924] [CONCEPT] Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya as Path Appearance
**Analysis:** These kayas are also path appearances because while various appearing dharmas exist in stages, they are not the final extreme of markless equality (mtha' bral ris med mnyam pa'i mthar thug ma yin).
[10925-10928] [CONCEPT] Spontaneously Accomplished Appearance
**Analysis:** At the time of measure-reach, from spontaneously accomplished appearance arise kayas, fields (zhing), and teachers. This indicates the natural unfolding of display (rol pa) without fabrication.
[10930] [PHILOLOGY] Lam snang 'od gsal stong pa'i rang bzhin
**Analysis:** Path appearance characterized as clear-light empty nature. 'Od gsal (clear light) indicates luminous clarity, stong pa (empty) indicates lack of inherent existence, rang bzhin (nature) indicates this is not an attribute but the fundamental character.
[10931-10933] [CONCEPT] Result as Secret Jewel Interior
**Analysis:** Result described as ka dag rin po che gsang ba'i sbubs (primordially-pure jewel secret interior) where movement produces only the arising-basis of inner-clear three kayas. This spatial metaphor (sbubs = inside) suggests kayas are always present but obscured.
[10934-11025] [CONTEXT] Extended Relic Tantra Citation
**Analysis:** Lengthy citation from Sku gdung 'bar ba enumerating signs of three kaya familiarity: dharmakaya signs include body invisible to others while yogin plays freely; sambhogakaya signs include playing in five kayas and five wisdoms; nirmanakaya signs include speaking untaught dharma and displaying miraculous powers. The verses employ distinct dzogchen technical terminology.
[10968-10978] [CONTEXT] Relic Tantra Citation: Miraculous Powers
**Analysis:** Citation continues from Sku gdung 'bar ba describing siddhis resulting from kaya practice: flying in sky, penetrating mountains, entering earth, not drowning in water. Line 10976 marks the critical transition point: "dbyings rig gdeng du ma tshud na" (if expanse-awareness is not entered as confidence) — indicating these powers alone do not constitute realization.
[10977-10981] [CONCEPT] Element Dissolution at Death
**Analysis:** If confidence is not achieved, elements self-dissolve ('byung ba nyid ni rang dengs su) and at death, transferring to the bardo of reality (chos nyid kyi bar do), liberation occurs in five instants (skad cig lnga la grol bar 'gyur). This describes the "automatic liberation" characteristic of Dzogchen at death.
[10982-11025] [CONTEXT] Extended Verses on Nirmanakaya Signs
**Analysis:** Comprehensive enumeration of signs indicating nirmanakaya familiarity: (1) previously heard dharma meanings arising instantly in continuum, (2) spontaneously speaking unheard dharmas, (3) clear recitation of other tantras, (4) answering questions according to beings' dispositions, (5) lion-like speech, (6) enhanced physical powers, (7) reversal of aging, (8) rejuvenation, (9) arising of unprecedented compassion, (10) ability to give body/limbs, (11) touching nirmanakaya.
[10990-10991] [PHILOLOGY] Cig car du 'char ba
**Analysis:** "Simultaneously arising" — a key Dzogchen technical term distinguishing instantaneous recognition from gradual cultivation. The dharma meanings arise not sequentially but all-at-once (cig car).
[11003] [PHILOLOGY] Smra ba'i seng ge
**Analysis:** "Speech lion" (smra ba'i seng ge) — epithet indicating fearlessness and power in teaching. Derives from standard Mahayana epithets for the Buddha's speech.
[11014-11016] [CONCEPT] Arising of Spontaneous Compassion
**Analysis:** "sngon na med pa'i snying rje yang / 'di la gting nas skye ba dang / de rjes sems can don la 'jug" — unprecedented compassion arising from depth, followed by engaging in beings' benefit. This indicates compassion not as cultivated quality but as spontaneous expression of realization.
[11020-11023] [CONCEPT] Bodily Self-Sacrifice
**Analysis:** Ability to give body and limbs (lus dang yan lag gtong bar nus) and even to guru — represents the complete transcendence of self-grasping that characterizes advanced realization in Mahayana and Vajrayana frameworks.
[11026-11030] [STRUCTURE] Conclusion of Previous Section / Transition
**Analysis:** Line 11026 marks the conclusion of a tantric citation with *zhes so*. Lines 11027-11030 transition from scriptural quotation to autocommentary, explaining the signs (*rtags*) of Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*) manifestation.
[11027-11028] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terminology: *Rdzus te skye ba*
**Analysis:** The phrase *rdzus te skye ba* (miraculous birth) denotes birth without womb-entry, one of the four modes of birth (*skye ba bzhi*). The instrumental *-s* in *rdzus te* marks manner of arising. The number *lo drug khri brgyad stong* (68,000 years) represents the Nirmanakaya's activity lifespan.
[11029] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Analysis: *Ka dag gis*
**Analysis:** *Ka dag gis* employs the instrumental particle *-s* to indicate agency/manner: "through primordial purity." The phrase *sa la 'da'o* indicates transcendence of the earth element.
[11030-11033] [CONCEPT] Resolution of Apparent Contradiction
**Analysis:** Longchenpa addresses a potential contradiction: if the Nirmanakaya nature (*rang bzhin sprul pa*) remains for five hundred years (*lo brgya phrag lnga*), how can the activity span 68,000 years? The resolution distinguishes:
1. *Rang don bsgrub pa* (accomplishing one's own welfare): 500 years
2. *Gzhan don bsgrub pa* (accomplishing others' welfare): limitless
These are not contradictory but complementary modalities.
[11034-11056] [CONTEXT] Root Text Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** This verse citation from the *Sku gdung 'bar ba* (Blazing Relic Stupa) tantra presents the complete Nirmanakaya activity cycle:
- Lines 11035-11040: Birth in pure realm (*sprul sku'i zhing khams*)
- Lines 11041-11046: Multiplication of emanations (*sprul pa bye ba drug khri*)
- Lines 11047-11051: Reabsorption into essence (*ngo bo ka dag*)
- Lines 11052-11055: Similes of reabsorption (water into water, butter into butter, space into space)
[11047-11051] [CONCEPT] The Reabsorption Process
**Analysis:** The reabsorption (*thim pa*) of emanations follows the pattern:
1. *Rang gi sprul par bcas pa ni* - one's own emanations together with
2. *Rang gi ngo bor rang thim nas* - self-reabsorb into one's own essence
3. *Dbyer med 'byed pa med par 'gyur* - become without division, without separation
This demonstrates the non-dual nature of manifestation and dissolution.
[11052-11055] [PHILOLOGY] Simile Structure: *Ji ltar...de bzhin...*
**Analysis:** The *ji ltar...de bzhin* (just as...so...) comparative structure establishes analogical reasoning:
- *Chu la chu thim* - water dissolving into water
- *Mar la mar thim* - butter into butter
- *Nam mkha' nam mkha' thim pa* - space into space
The similes progressively move from tangible (water, butter) to intangible (space), mapping the dissolution hierarchy.
[11057-11074] [STRUCTURE] New Section: Inner Experience Signs (*Nang shes pa'i nyams*)
**Analysis:** Line 11057 initiates a new subsection analyzing internal meditative experiences. The citation from *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra enumerates experiential signs of realization.
[11059-11074] [CONCEPT] Fifteen Experiential Signs
**Analysis:** The text enumerates fifteen signs (*nyams*) of genuine realization:
1. *Bde ba dang ldan pa* - possessing bliss
2. *'Jig rten la zhen pa med pa* - without attachment to worldly existence
3. *Snang ba thams cad 'od du shar ba* - all appearances dawning as light
4. *'Od la sku'i tshom bu ma 'gags par mthong ba* - seeing unimpeded spheres of buddha-bodies in the light
5. *'Dzin pa med par lus bde ba* - physical bliss without grasping
6. *Shes pa rtse gcig tu gyur pa* - awareness becoming one-pointed
7. *Shes pa ngang gis dal ba* - awareness naturally spacious
8. *Shes pa ma yengs pa* - awareness undistracted
9. *Shes pa gzhan la mi 'jug pa* - awareness not entering into other [objects]
10. *Shes pa ci yang ma yin par rtogs pa* - realizing awareness is nothing whatsoever
11. *Shes pa mi 'gyur ba* - awareness unchanging
12. *Shes pa ma 'gags par gsal ba* - awareness clear without obstruction
13. *Shes pa mi rtog par 'chad pa* - awareness expressed as non-conceptual
14. *Shes pa 'dzin pa med par rang grol ba* - awareness self-liberated without grasping
15. *Phyi nang gi chos la 'dzin pa chung ba* - minimal grasping at external/internal phenomena
[11066-11067] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Chain Analysis
**Analysis:** The repetition of *dang* (and) creates an enumerative chain. The genitive *gi* in *shes pa'i* establishes the relationship between awareness and its various modalities.
[11074] [PHILOLOGY] Citation Marker: *Zhes so*
**Analysis:** The formula *yin no zhes so* marks the conclusion of the *Rang shar* citation, confirming these fifteen signs as scriptural authority rather than Longchenpa's own composition.
[11075-11079] [STRUCTURE] New Major Division: Presentation of Rigpa
**Analysis:** Line 11075 initiates the fifth major division (*lnga pa*) on *rig pa* (awareness), structured as fivefold:
1. *Ngo bo* - essence/entity
2. *Nges tshig* - etymological definition
3. *Dbye ba* - divisions/classifications
4. *Mtshan nyid* - characteristics
5. *'Bras bu* - result
This follows the standard Tibetan scholastic presentation format (*sgrub mtha'*).
[11080-11084] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology: *Rdo rje lu gu rgyud*
**Analysis:** The term *rdo rje lu gu rgyud* (vajra chain/cord) denotes the indestructible continuum of awareness. The citation from *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs* (Lion Perfection) establishes awareness as the basis (*gnas*) of wisdom (*ye shes*). The locative particle *du* marks sphere/location.
[11080-11083] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs*
**Analysis:** This root text citation establishes *rig pa* as the ground (*gnas*) of primordial wisdom (*ye shes*), distinguishing Dzogchen view from Sutric and lower Tantric presentations where awareness may be identified with ordinary mind (*sems*).
[11085-11086] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology: *Rig pa*
**Analysis:** The etymology (*nges tshig*) derives *rig pa* from the causative of *rig* (to know), with the instrumental *-s* in *rig pas* indicating agency. The phrase *sngar ma rig pa* (previously not knowing) contrasted with *rig pas* (having recognized) establishes the transformative moment through *bla ma'i gdams ngag* (guru's oral instruction).
[11087-11099] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Division of Rigpa
**Analysis:** The divisions (*dbye ba*) categorize rigpa into three types:
1. *Gzhi gnas kyi rig pa* (lines 11088) - abiding ground awareness
2. *Lam snang gi rig pa* (lines 11089-11096) - path-appearing awareness
3. *Lhag mthong gi rig pa* (lines 11097-11099) - superior seeing/vipasyana awareness
[11088] [CONCEPT] Ground Awareness (*Gzhi gnas kyi rig pa*)
**Analysis:** Ground awareness is defined as the actual mode of existence (*gnas lugs*) of phenomena beyond good (*dge*), bad (*sdig*), and defect (*skyon*). This transcends ethical dualism, indicating the view of primordial purity (*ka dag*) at the level of the basis.
[11089-11096] [CONCEPT] Path-Appearing Awareness (*Lam snang gi rig pa*)
**Analysis:** Path awareness encompasses various terms from different philosophical systems (*grub mtha' so so*):
- *Sems nyid* - mind itself (common Mahayana)
- *Skye med* - unborn (Madhyamaka)
- *Lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes* - co-emergent wisdom (Anuttarayoga)
- *Blo 'das* - beyond intellect (Dzogchen)
- *Don gyi kun gzhi* - ultimate alaya (Yogacara refined)
- *Byang chub kyi sems* - bodhicitta
Despite varying nomenclature, all refer to *so so rang gi ye shes rang gsal stong pa rjen par sa le ba* - one's own self-aware, self-luminous, empty, naked, clear wisdom.
[11097-11099] [CONCEPT] Superior Seeing Awareness (*Lhag mthong gi rig pa*)
**Analysis:** This represents vipasyana-level awareness characterized by:
- Direct vision (*mngon sum*) of the vajra-chain form (*sku*)
- Liberation from conceptual word-webs (*tshig gi ra ba*)
- Freedom from obscuration/clarity of virtue/vice
- Accomplishment of light-body (*'od lus*) and transparent body (*zang thal*) through unwavering contemplation
[11100-11101] [PHILOLOGY] Characteristic Definition: *Mtshan nyid*
**Analysis:** The characteristic is defined as *rang gsal rjen par zang ma 'di ka* - this very self-luminous, naked, transparent [awareness]. The demonstrative *'di ka* (this one here) emphasizes immediacy.
[11102-11107] [CONCEPT] Result: Distinctive Fruition
**Analysis:** The result (*'bras bu*) is liberation in primordial purity (*ka dag*) and transparency (*zang ma*). Longchenpa distinguishes:
- Common result: three kayas (*sku gsum*) as fruition
- Distinctive result (*khyad par che*): here, the path transforms into the Great Primordially Pure Liberation (*ka dag mtha' grol chen po*), a "men shell-like" (*men shel*) fruition without fixation on body or wisdom.
[11108-11124] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** Lines 11109-11124 cite the *Sku gdung 'bar ba* tantra, presenting signs (*rtags*) of ripened rigpa:
- Ability to direct self-knowing (*rang shes*) toward any object
- Body following awareness (*lus kyang de yi rjes su*)
- Capacity to transform others' faith (*gzhan gyi dad pa sgyur nus*)
- Self-cessation of conceptual attachment (*bsam rgyun zhen pa rang 'gags*)
- Direct recognition (*mngon sum nyid du sus rig pa*)
[11109-11111] [PHILOLOGY] Relative Clause Structure
**Analysis:** The construction *rig pa la ni sus goms pa* (those who have familiarized with rigpa) employs the locative *la* to mark the object of familiarization (*goms pa*), with *sus* (by whom) as agent.
[11125-11135] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Thal 'gyur* (Consequence) Tantra
**Analysis:** This section cites the *Thal 'gyur* tantra, presenting the marks (*rtags*) and measures (*tshad*) of meditative practice. The verse enumerates six external signs:
1. *Lus ni yang zhing zang thal snang* - body appearing light and transparent
2. *Sa la reg med thogs med* - without touching earth, without obstruction
3. *Ngag gi nus rdzogs gtam zungs zad* - speech power complete, eloquence exhausted (beyond words)
4. *Sems ni 'pho bar nus pa* - mind able to transfer [consciousness]
5. *Mig dang rnam pa sna dang lce* - eye, form, nose, tongue
6. *Lus kyi dbang po kun zad* - all body senses ceased
7. *Rang bzhin med par gyur pa tshad* - measure of becoming without nature
[11125-11127] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Signs and Measures
**Analysis:** Following the presentation of rigpa's essence, divisions, and characteristics, Longchenpa now addresses the signs (*rtags*) and measures (*tshad*) of meditative accomplishment.
[11128-11135] [PHILOLOGY] Parallel Structure Analysis
**Analysis:** The verse employs *dang* conjunction to link the six signs. The genitive particles (*gi, kyi*) mark possession and agency throughout.
[11136-11139] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Analysis of Signs
**Analysis:** Line 11136 introduces the third major section (*gsum pa*) analyzing signs through three divisions:
1. *Skye med thob pa'i rtags spyir bstan* - general presentation of unborn attainment signs
2. *Yon tan gyi rtags bye brag tu bshad* - specific explanation of qualities' signs
3. *Rtags gsum 'dres pa'i khyad par so sor brjod pa* - distinct articulation of three-sign combination
[11140-11143] [CONCEPT] Signs of Unborn Attainment
**Analysis:** The yogin established in confidence (*gdeng du tshud pa*) in the realization of primordial purity (*ka dag gi rtogs pa*) exhibits two signs of not taking rebirth in samsara:
1. *Lus la srog chags med pa* - no living creatures on the body
2. *Skra dang sen mo mi skye ba* - hair and nails not growing
[11143-11161] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** The citation describes the three-month (*zla ba gsum*) process at death:
- Visible to others in the expanse of five lights (*'od lnga'i dkyil*)
- Arising as the five-family form (*rigs lnga'i sku*) in space
- Rising and dissolving (*'phags te yal ba*) into the sky
[11143] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Particle: *De nas*
**Analysis:** *De nas* (from that/then) establishes temporal sequence following the two preliminary signs.
[11148-11161] [CONCEPT] The Dissolution Process
**Analysis:** The verse presents the complete liberation process:
- Line 11148: Possessing these marks indicates sharing the same fortune (*skal pa mnyam pa*) as the teacher
- Lines 11150-11151: Cessation of birth continuum (*skye ba'i rgyun chad*), absence of insects on body
- Lines 11152-11153: Hair and nails not growing, continuum ended
- Lines 11156-11160: After three months, elements dissolve (*'byung ba rang sar dengs*), contaminated aggregates (*zag bcas phung po*) become invisible, one's body with families rises into light's expanse
[11162] [PHILOLOGY] Superlative Designation: *Skal chen*
**Analysis:** *Skal chen* (great fortune) designates the yogin of dissolution time (*zad pa'i dus*) with exceptional capacity.
[11163-11167] [STRUCTURE] Second Division: Praise of Qualities
**Analysis:** Line 11163 initiates the second division praising qualities (*yon tan*), distinguishing:
- *Snang ba lus ngag gi yon tan* - qualities of apparent body and speech
- *Med pa rig pa stong pa'i yon tan* - qualities of empty awareness's unapparent [aspect]
[11166-11167] [CONCEPT] Enjoyment of Pure Realms
**Analysis:** The measureless qualities involve enjoying peaceful and wrathful mandalas (*zhi khro gnyis kyi dkyil 'khor*) in the self-appearing buddha-field (*rang snang sangs rgyas kyi zhing*), along with dharmakaya qualities.
[11163] [PHILOLOGY] Demonstrative Particle: *De'i*
**Analysis:** *De'i* (of that) refers back to the yogin established in the signs, linking the qualities section to the previous discussion.
[11168-11181] [CONTEXT] Citation from Tantric Source
**Analysis:** Lines 11169-11180 present a verse citation describing the qualities of the realized person (*rtogs pa'i skyes bu*). The citation emphasizes:
- Inconceivable qualities beyond existence and non-existence (*yod med yon tan bsam mi khyab*)
- Self-illuminating wisdom dwelling as unity (*gcig par gnas pa'i ye shes*)
- Self-displaying great display without arrangement (*ma bkod ye gdangs*)
- Natural presence of method and wisdom (*thabs dang shes rab rang bzhin las*)
- Two buddha-families appearing (*sangs rgyas rigs kyang gnyis su snang*)
- All appearing as retinue (*'di kun de yi 'khor du snang*)
- Appearance from base-appearance without nature (*gzhi snang rang bzhin med pa las*)
- Inexpressible dharma beyond thought and speech (*smra bsam brjod med chos*)
- Three times equally self-abiding from the beginning (*dus gsum mnyam pa nyid...ye nas...rang gnas*)
[11168] [PHILOLOGY] Citation Marker: *De nyid las*
**Analysis:** *De nyid las* (from that very [source]) indicates continuation from the same tantric source as the previous citation.
[11182-11194] [CONCEPT] Three Combinations of Signs
**Analysis:** The text analyzes liberation based on combinations of three signs (*rtags*):
1. **Body sign complete** (*lus rtags rdzogs na*): liberation in bardo (*bar dor grol*)
2. **Body and speech signs present** (*lus dang ngag gnyis...yod pa*): liberation in Nirmanakaya realm (*sprul pa'i zhing du grol*)
3. **Mind sign complete** (*sems rtags rdzogs na*): liberation in bardo in three instants (*bar do la skad cig gsum gyis grol*)
4. **All three complete** (*gsum ka rdzogs na*): engaging in other-benefit compassion (*snying rje gzhan don byed*)
[11188-11191] [CONCEPT] Fruitional Dimensions
**Analysis:** When all three signs are complete:
- Knowledge of certain self-attainment (*rang don thob nges su shes pas*)
- Blessing for measureless lives (*tshe grangs med par byin gyis brlabs*)
- Benefit accomplished for beings
- Liberation as light into the very basis
- With body and mind signs: swift self-attainment and liberation
[11192-11194] [CONCEPT] Specific Timeframes
**Analysis:**
- Speech and mind signs combined (*ngag dang sems kyi rtags 'dzom pa*): light-body attained in ten years (*lo bcu na 'od lus thob*)
- All three signs combined (*lus ngag yid gsum gyi rtags 'dzom pa*): even those without other-benefit capacity liberated in two years (*lo gnyis na grol*)
[11195-11231] [CONTEXT] Extensive Citation on Sign Combinations
**Analysis:** This long citation from *De nyid* (Thatness) tantra elaborates:
- Lines 11197-11199: Body sign complete leads to seeing reality in bardo and awakening
- Lines 11200-11202: Body and speech signs lead to one-birth awakening in Nirmanakaya realm
- Lines 11203-11209: Mind sign complete enables three-instant liberation like a shooting star
- Lines 11210-11218: All three signs combined leads to great bodhicitta, benefiting beings for eons with one human body
- Lines 11219-11224: Body and mind signs combined leads to liberation in ten years, elements dissolving into pure reality
- Lines 11225-11231: All three signs combined for fortunate being leads to liberation in two years without doubt
[11195] [PHILOLOGY] Citation Formula: *De nyid las*
**Analysis:** Marks transition to extended tantric citation.
[11232] [STRUCTURE] Critical Distinction: Incomplete Signs
**Analysis:** Line 11232 introduces a crucial caveat: without distinctive outer/inner signs (*phyi nang gi rtags khyad par can*), merely possessing some signs (*rtags 'ga' tsam*) creates uncertain signs (*ma nges pa'i rtags*), not liberation.
[11232] [PHILOLOGY] Negative Particle Chain
**Analysis:** The construction *med par...yod kyang...ma nges pa* establishes the contrast between presence and certainty.
[11233-11235] [CONCEPT] Certain Liberation Signs
**Analysis:** With certain outer/inner signs (*phyi nang gi rtags nges pa can*), liberation exists in such measure (*de ltar grol tshad du yod*). However, mere possession of signs does not pervade liberation (*rtags yod tsam la grol bas ma khyab*). The logic is: liberation pervades possession of signs (*grol ba la rtags yod pas khyab pa*), making this distinction precious (*gces*).
[11233-11235] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Analysis: *Khyab pa*
**Analysis:** The term *khyab pa* (pervasion) denotes logical entailment in Tibetan epistemology (*tshad ma*). The instrumental *-s* in *yod pas* marks the pervasion relationship.
[11236-11249] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** This citation warns against incomplete signs:
- Merely possessing some body/speech/mind signs (*lus ngag yid kyi rtags kun...'ga' tsam*)
- Does not mean liberation (*rnam par grol ba ma yin*)
- Worldly common siddhis (*'jig rten thun mong dngos grub*)
- Gradual hearers and self-buddhas (*rim gyis nyan thos rang sangs rgyas*)
- All enter this level (*sa la zhugs*)
- Without result of great purity (*rnam dag chen po'i 'bras bu med*)
- Only those with complete body/speech signs reach the great equality level (*mnyam pa chen po sa*)
[11236] [PHILOLOGY] Universal Quantifier: *Kun*
**Analysis:** *Kun* (all) with the genitive *ni* emphasizes that all three signs must be considered, not just one.
[11250-11251] [CONCEPT] Absence of Signs in Non-Meditators
**Analysis:** Those without outer/inner liberation signs now, who have gone into non-meditation (*bsgom med*), do not need meditation practice (*bsgom mi dgos*) as karma cannot harm them (*las kyis mi gnod*). However, future instructions must not be neglected (*phyis thod pa mgo la mi 'gel bya*).
[11252-11254] [CONCEPT] Warning Against False Claims
**Analysis:** Even if claiming "I see the authentic reality of dharmata, view and meditation are complete" (*ngas chos nyid rnal ma'i don mthong lta sgom mthar phyin*), if speaking falsely (*brdzun gtong*), this deceives both self and others, allowing demonic entry (*bdud zhugs pa*).
[11252] [PHILOLOGY] Rhetorical Particle: *Zer yang*
**Analysis:** *Zer yang* (even if saying) introduces a concessive clause, acknowledging the claim while refuting its validity.
[11255-11265] [CONTEXT] Citation on False Confidence
**Analysis:** This citation from *De nyid* warns:
- Without signs but claiming confidence in self-appearance (*rang snang gdeng du tshud*)
- Merely accepting intellectually (*yid dpyod rnams kyi lta ba*)
- Intellectually contrived meditation (*yid dpyod sgom pa*)
- Cannot liberate through this alone
- Will remain long in samsara
[11255] [PHILOLOGY] Negative Particle: *Mi ldan par*
**Analysis:** *Mi ldan par* (without possessing) establishes the prerequisite condition, negated in false practitioners.
[11266-11272] [CONCEPT] Special Instruction for Thodgal Practitioners
**Analysis:** For *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) meditation yogins, these signs certainly arise without deception (*grol nges bslu ba med par 'byung*). Therefore, special effort (*brtson 'grus khyad par can*) is instructed.
[11266] [PHILOLOGY] Emphatic Particle: *De'ang*
**Analysis:** *De'ang* (even that) introduces an additional consideration beyond the previous warning.
[11267-11272] [CONTEXT] Final Citation on Familiarization
**Analysis:** The citation from *De las* emphasizes:
- Familiarization with expanse and awareness (*dbyings rig goms pa*) is precious
- Whoever familiarizes with expanse and awareness
- The previously explained signs will certainly arise
- Practice with diligence (*nan tan bya*)
[11273] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Third General Meaning
**Analysis:** Line 11273 initiates the third general meaning (*spyi don gsum pa*): summarizing signs of liberation/confusion in bardo and future lives. This is structured in two parts (*gnyis te*).
[11273] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative Particle: *La gnyis te*
**Analysis:** *La gnyis te* (regarding [this], two [divisions]) marks structural subdivision.
[11274-11278] [STRUCTURE] Two Divisions of the Third General Meaning
**Analysis:** The third general meaning comprises:
1. *Dang po* (line 11274-11278): Signs of yogins liberated and attaining awakening
2. *Gnyis pa* (line 11275): Signs of six realms' beings taking rebirth through confusion
Each has two subdivisions (*gnyis te*): brief presentation (*mdor bstan*) and extensive explanation (*rgyas par bshad*).
[11274-11282] [CONCEPT] Two Types of Parinirvana in Dzogchen
**Analysis:** The text presents two Dzogchen approaches to awakening (*sangs rgya lugs gnyis*):
1. **Manifestly Complete Awakening** (*mngon par rdzogs par sangs rgyas pa*):
- Occurs through sign-appearance (*rtags snang bas*)
- With remainder of form aggregate (*rdos bcas kyi lhag ma*)
- Nirvana with remainder (*lhag ma dang bcas pa'i mya ngan las 'das pa*)
- Results from incomplete diligence (*brtson 'grus dman pas*)
2. **Truly Complete Awakening** (*yang dag par rdzogs par sangs rgyas pa*):
- Through excellent diligence and pure remainder (*brtson 'grus rab rdos bcas dag pas*)
- Nirvana without remainder (*phung po'i lhag ma med par mya ngan las 'das pa*)
[11280-11282] [PHILOLOGY] Causal Construction: *Kyis...kyang*
**Analysis:** The instrumental *-s* in *bsgoms kyang* (even though meditated) establishes the concessive: despite having meditated on dharmata, incomplete diligence prevented reaching the measure.
[11283] [CONTEXT] Source Citation: *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long gi rgyud*
**Analysis:** This citation from the Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror Tantra establishes the two types of nirvana as scriptural authority.
[11286-11297] [CONCEPT] Five Manifestations at Death
**Analysis:** For the manifestly complete awakened person, five signs arise:
1. *'Od* - light
2. *Sgra* - sound
3. *Gdung* - relics/stupa
4. *Sku* - form/body
5. *Sa g.yo ba* - earth trembling
[11298-11310] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** This verse citation elaborates external signs (*phyi yi rtags*):
- Intelligent accomplished person (*skyes bu blo rtsal rab*)
- Elements dissolve to their own ground (*'byung ba rang gi sar dengs*)
- Result of own-nature (*ngo bo nyid kyi 'bras bu*)
- Contaminated aggregates become invisible (*zag bcas phung po mi snang*)
- Result transforms to its own ground
- After passing into nirvana: body, relics, light, sound, and earth trembling
[11298-11310] [PHILOLOGY] Parallel Enumeration
**Analysis:** The verse employs fivefold enumeration marked by *dang* conjunctions, creating a rhythmic catalogue of miraculous signs.
[11311-11316] [STRUCTURE] Five Extensive Explanations
**Analysis:** The second subdivision presents five extensive explanations (*rgyas par bshad pa lnga*):
1. *Sku* - body
2. *Gdung* - relics/stupa
3. *'Od* - light
4. *Sgra* - sound
5. *Sa g.yo ba* - earth trembling
[11317] [STRUCTURE] Subdivision Markers
**Analysis:** Line 11317 indicates the beginning of the first extensive explanation on body, with its own internal structure.
[11276-11278] [PHILOLOGY] Structural Particles: *La...te...o*
**Analysis:** The pattern *la gnyis te* / *dang* / *o* creates nested enumeration: "regarding [this], two [divisions]: brief and extensive presentation."
[11274] [PHILOLOGY] Agentive Construction: *Rnal 'byor pa grol bas*
**Analysis:** *Grol bas* (through/by liberation) marks agency: the yogin who is liberated, through that liberation, attains the signs of awakening.
[11318-11321] [STRUCTURE] Fivefold Presentation Format
**Analysis:** The analysis of bodily form (*sku*) follows the standard fivefold scholastic format:
1. *Ngo bo* - essence (lines 11322-11324)
2. *Dbye ba* - divisions (lines 11318, 11342-11343)
3. *Rgyu* - cause (lines 11360-11371)
4. *Gnas* - location (lines 11372-11378)
5. *'Bras bu* - result (line 11379)
[11322-11334] [CONCEPT] Eight Forms of Manifestation
**Analysis:** The essence (*ngo bo*) of body-appearance comprises eight forms:
1. *Sku rkyang* - singular body
2. *Phyed sku* - half-body
3. *Yab yum* - father-mother union
4. *Tshom bu* - sphere/circle
5. *Dkyil 'khor chen po* - great mandala
6. *Mchod rten* - stupa (and similar forms)
7. *'Khor lo* - wheel
8. *Rdo rje, rin po che, padma, rgya gram, ral gri* - vajra, jewel, lotus, cross, sword
[11335-11341] [CONCEPT] Development Stage Correlations
**Analysis:** The text correlates developmental stages of practice (*bskyed rdzogs*) with manifestation types:
- Pre-perfect (*nar ma son pa*): seed syllables (*yi ge*), hand-emblems (*phyag mtshan*), half-bodies, single forms
- Fully complete (*yongs su rdzogs pa*): father-mother, spheres, mandalas
[11342-11343] [PHILOLOGY] Dual Classification: *Zhi khro gnyis*
**Analysis:** The primary division (*dbye ba*) separates into:
- *Zhi ba'i sku* - peaceful body
- *Khro bo'i sku* - wrathful body
The numeral *gnyis* with *te* marks binary enumeration.
[11344-11360] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Citations on Body Types
**Analysis:** Three citations establish the dual body typology:
1. *Sku gdung 'bar ba* (lines 11344-11350): Relics' remainder (*lhag ma'i zag bcas*) of aggregates burned and purified yield two body forms
2. *Rang shar* (lines 11351-11356): Peaceful and wrathful distinguished; wrathful body cannot emanate as Nirmanakaya
3. *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (lines 11357-11359): Confirms two body types
[11360-11371] [CONCEPT] Two Causes of Continuity
**Analysis:** The cause (*rgyu*) is twofold:
1. *Ngo bo'i rgyu* - Essential cause: sentient beings possess luminosity-body (*'od gsal gyi sku*) from the beginning
2. *Mngon gyur gyi rgyu* - Manifest cause: matured through creation-completion practice, arising from pure element essences (*dangs ma*), not latent impure nature
[11366-11371] [CONTEXT] Citation on Ripening
**Analysis:** The *Sngar ma* citation distinguishes:
- *Smin pa* - ripened/manifest
- *Ma smin* - unripened/latent (*bag la zha*)
Sentient beings dwell in great self-settled ground from the beginning.
[11372-11378] [CONCEPT] Locations of Emergence
**Analysis:** Body primarily emerges from:
- *Mgo* - head, or
- *Sgal tshigs* - spinal column
However, through luminosity familiarity (*'od gsal goms pas*), the locations are those two.
[11379] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Results
**Analysis:** Line 11379 introduces the result (*'bras bu*) section: attainment of liberation through progressive stages.
[11344] [PHILOLOGY] Genitive Chain: *Rigs ldan mya ngan las 'das pa*
**Analysis:** The genitive particles link: "of the noble one who has passed into nirvana, of that [one's] remainder..."
[11380-11381] [CONCEPT] Liberation Through Both Body Types
**Analysis:** When both peaceful and wrathful bodies arise (*zhi khro gnyis ka byung*):
- Consciousness dissolves into space (*rnam shes nam mkhar thim*)
- Space's primordially pure self-radiance dawns (*nam mkha' ka dag gi rang gdangs shar*)
- Liberation without dharmata bardo (*chos nyid kyi bar do med par sangs rgyas*)
- Included within this-life liberation category (*tshe 'dir grol ba'i khongs su 'dus*)
[11382-11383] [CONCEPT] Future Separation
**Analysis:** The separation from this basis (*rten 'di nas 'bral ba*) in future (*phyi ma*) follows this same pattern (*de yin pa'i phyir*).
[11384-11386] [CONCEPT] Peaceful Body Liberation Timeline
**Analysis:** When peaceful body arises:
- This appearance ceases (*snang ba 'di 'gags*)
- Liberation in five absorption days (*bsam gtan gyi zhag lnga*) of self-luminous self-appearance
- *Bsam gtan gyi zhag* defined as absorption duration (*ting nge 'dzin gyi gnas cha*)
- Duration varies (*ring thung gi khyad*) among yogins
[11387-11388] [CONCEPT] Wrathful Body Liberation Timeline
**Analysis:** When wrathful body arises:
- From eye emerges Vajrasattva nose-cord (*mig nas rdo rje sems dpa'i sna thag*)
- Sound-light-ray three self-appear (*sgra 'od zer gsum rang snang*)
- Liberation in five instants (*skad cig cha lnga*)
[11389-11405] [CONTEXT] Citations on Dual Liberation
**Analysis:**
1. *Sku gdung 'bar ba* (lines 11390-11400): If both arise, without bardo, confident in great primordially pure essence; five days for true seeing; buddhahood dissolution; wrathful body liberates in bardo in five instants
2. *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (lines 11401-11405): Peaceful body yields stability after appearance ceases, cannot emit Nirmanakaya; wrathful body gains stability, can emit Nirmanakaya after twenty-one days
[11406-11410] [CONCEPT] Distinction in Emanation Capacity
**Analysis:** The peaceful body:
- Dissolves into transparent primordial purity (*zang thal du ka dag sa*)
- No bardo emanation arises (*bar do nas rang snang gi sprul pa mi 'byung*)
- Pure appearance basis (*ka dag...sprul pa'i snang cha*) absent
- Becomes basis for other-appearance Sambhogakaya-Nirmanakaya
- No self-emanation capacity, but other-benefit activities (*'phrin las*) arise dependent on that
[11411-11421] [CONCEPT] Wrathful Body Emanation Process
**Analysis:** The wrathful body:
- Liberates through recognizing sound-light-ray as self-appearance (*sgra 'od zer gsum rang snang du shes pas*)
- Spontaneous presence base-appearance dawns (*lhun grub kyi gzhi snang shar*)
- Pauses for a moment (*dar cig sdod pas*)
- After twenty-one absorption days completed
- From impure self-appearance (six realms), through pure gate, emanates Nirmanakaya for whoever needs taming
- Functions like illusion benefiting illusion (*sgyu mas sgyu ma'i don byed pa*)
- Self-appearance benefits self-appearance (*rang snang la rang snang gis don byed*)
[11417-11419] [CONCEPT] Necessity of Prior Liberation
**Analysis:** After emitting emanation, prior liberation is already accomplished. Without self-liberation, self-benefit incomplete, other-benefit circumstances cannot arise.
[11420-11421] [PHILOLOGY] Comparative Particles: *Tsam dang...de bas*
**Analysis:** The comparison *skar mda' rgyug pa tsam* (like shooting star) establishes the brief, swift nature of emanation duration.
[11422-11425] [CONCEPT] Error Regarding Emanation Capacity
**Analysis:** Common confusion (*'khrul pa*) regarding ability to emit emanation leads to focusing attention (*blo rtse gtod*) on whether buddhas can benefit others. This is called a "great fierce error" (*rnor ba rngams che*).
[11424-11425] [CONTEXT] Mahayana View on Buddha Activity
**Analysis:** Buddhas not engaging in benefit is neither desired nor possible in Mahayana.
[11412-11431] [CONCEPT] Detailed Emanation Mechanics
**Analysis:** The wrathful body liberation process continues:
- Luminosity essence essence dawns in spontaneous presence base-appearance (*lhun grub kyi gzhi snang shar ba*)
- Pauses for a moment (*dar cig sdod pas*)
- After twenty-one absorption days (*bsam gtan gyi zhag nyi shu rtsa gcig*)
- From impure self-appearance (samsara's six realms), through pure gate (*dag pa'i sgo*), Nirmanakaya emanates to tame beings
- Functions like illusion performing illusion's benefit (*sgyu mas sgyu ma'i don byed pa*)
- Self-appearance benefits self-appearance (*rang snang la rang snang gis don byed*)
[11417-11419] [CONCEPT] Prior Liberation Requirement
**Analysis:** After emitting emanation, prior liberation already accomplished. Without self-liberation (*rang ma grol*), self-benefit incomplete (*rang don ma rdzogs*), other-benefit circumstances (*gnas skabs*) cannot arise.
[11420-11421] [CONCEPT] Emanation Duration Variability
**Analysis:** Emanation duration compared to shooting star (*skar mda' rgyug pa*), longer or shorter, indefinite duration explained.
[11422-11425] [CONCEPT] Common Error on Buddha Activity
**Analysis:** Confusion (*'khrul nas*) regarding emanation capacity focuses attention on whether buddhas can benefit others after awakening. This is called "great fierce error" (*rnor ba rngams che*).
[11424-11425] [CONTEXT] Mahayana Rejection of Inactive Buddhas
**Analysis:** Buddhas not performing benefit neither desired (*mi 'dod*) nor possible (*mi srid*) in Mahayana.
[11426-11431] [CONCEPT] Emanation Absence in Complete Liberation
**Analysis:** Those liberated into transparent primordial purity without bardo spontaneous presence gate-opening lack emanation because:
- Impure taming-fields (*gdul zhing ma dag pa*) not visible at that time
- From spontaneous presence gate-appearance, impure appearances visible
- If emanation doesn't benefit there, samsara-appearance not dissolved
- Buddha-activity accomplished as self-appearance completion through emanation
- After benefiting, samsara empties, emanation reabsorbs into spontaneous presence eight gates, goes to primordial purity ground
[11432-11433] [CONCEPT] Non-Dual Kayas
**Analysis:** Primordial purity ground transcends visible/invisible distinction. Three kayas' appearance-basis only, no separate three kayas. From there, base-appearance other-benefit arises.
[11434-11435] [CONTEXT] Secret Vajra Pledge
**Analysis:** This place (*gnas 'di*) is the difficult supreme vajra pledge (*dka' ba'i mchog rdo rje'i chings*), great secret. If from now (*da phan chad*) one can speak without error, know it as this author's power.
[11436] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Relics Section
**Analysis:** Line 11436 initiates the second major section (*gnyis pa*): extensive explanation of relics (*gdung*), structured in three parts (*gsum ste*).
[11426] [PHILOLOGY] Negative Existential: *Med de*
**Analysis:** *Med de* (there is no) marks absence of emanation for those completely liberated.
[11437-11439] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Analysis of Relics
**Analysis:** The relics (*gdung*) section comprises three divisions:
1. *Thun mong gi dbye bas mdor bstan* - brief presentation through common divisions
2. *Khyad par gyi dbye bas rgyas par bshad* - extensive explanation through distinctive divisions
3. *Gdung dang ring bsrel gyi khyad par gyis don bsdus* - meaning summary through relic-ring distinction
[11440-11457] [CONCEPT] Common Divisions of Relics
**Analysis:** All beings are buddhas from the beginning (*ye nas sangs rgyas*), dwelling as five buddha-families (*rig lnga*), both individual and non-individual. The unripened five relics (*gdung lnga*) in the life-force (*srog*) are ripened through yogin's luminosity-essence path practice, manifesting as five *shariram* (relics), liberating in respective families.
[11444-11456] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** The verse citation enumerates five relics by family:
- *Sha ri ram* - Tathagata family (white)
- *Ba ri ram* - Vajra family (dark blue)
- *Chu ri ram* - Ratna family (yellow)
- *Bse ri ram* - Padma family (red)
- *Nya ri ram* - Karma family (green)
[11457-11467] [CONCEPT] Relic Signs of Liberation
**Analysis:** Whatever family-relics arise on the person indicate liberation in that family's buddha. The citation from *De nyid* confirms:
- Signs arise on the capable person's body at death
- Individual family relics lead to seeing respective buddha-bodies in bardo
[11468-11475] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long*
**Analysis:** Relics also divide into five by color, indicating liberation in respective pure realms:
- Dark blue (*mthing ga*) - Vairocana's realm, manifest complete awakening
- White (*dkar po*) - Vajrasattva
- Yellow (*ser po*) - Ratnasambhava
- Red (*dmar po*) - Amitabha
- Green (*ljang gu*) - Amoghasiddhi
- Multicolored (*sna tshogs*) - attainment of five kayas spontaneously accomplished ground
[11476-11479] [STRUCTURE] Distinctive Divisions Structure
**Analysis:** The distinctive divisions (*khyad par gyi dbye ba*) analyze four aspects:
1. Color size measure (*kha dog che chung gi tshad*)
2. Location distinction (*gnas kyi khyad par*)
3. Cause of arising (*rgyu gang las byung ba*)
4. (Fourth implicit)
[11480-11482] [CONCEPT] Five Colors, Two Body Types
**Analysis:** Five colors contain five families. These divide into:
- Peaceful relic colors
- Wrathful relic colors
[11483-11488] [CONCEPT] Peaceful Relic Colors
**Analysis:** From *Sku gdung 'bar ba*:
- *Sha ri ram* - white (*dkar po*)
- *Ba ri ram* - dark blue (*sngo nag*)
- *Chu ri ram* - yellow (*ser po*)
- *Bse ri ram* - red (*dmar po*)
- *Nya ri ram* - green (*ljang gu*)
[11489-11498] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Rang shar* on Wrathful Relic Colors
**Analysis:** Wrathful relic colors differ:
- *Sha ri ram* - white with radiance (*dkar la gdangs*)
- *Chu ri ram* - dark blue
- *Ba ri ram* - yellowish-red with spots (*tshig ser ldan*)
- *Nya ri ram* - smoky black (*smug nag*)
- *Pancaram* - red-green-black (*dmar ljang nag*)
[11499-11505] [CONCEPT] Size and Location Specifications
**Analysis:** Size measures:
- *Sha ri ram*: size of white mustard seed (*mon sran gyi 'bru*)
- Others: size of sesame seed to small mustard seed
- Oily and round
Locations:
- *Sha ri ram*: head (*mgo*)
- *Ba ri ram*: between ribs (*rtsib ma'i go bar*)
- *Chu ri ram*: above liver (*mchin pa'i steng*)
- *Bse ri ram*: kidneys (*mkhal ma*)
- *Nya ri ram*: above heart/lobe (*glo ba'i steng*)
[11440] [PHILOLOGY] Universal Particle: *Spyir*
**Analysis:** *Spyir* (generally/in common) establishes the general principle before specific divisions.
[11506-11511] [CONCEPT] Causes of Peaceful Relics
**Analysis:** The cause (*rgyu*) of peaceful relics:
1. *Sha ri ram*: bone essence (*rus pa'i dangs ma*)
2. *Ba ri ram*: heat essence (*drod kyi dangs ma*)
3. *Chu ri ram*: blood essence (*khrag gi dangs ma*)
4. *Bse ri ram*: element essence (*'byung ba'i dangs ma*)
5. *Nya ri ram*: consciousness essence (*shes pa'i dangs ma*)
Gathered in the body.
[11512-11517] [CONCEPT] Causes of Wrathful Relics
**Analysis:** The cause of wrathful relics:
1. *Sha ri ram*: head skull deity (*mgo bo'i thod pa'i lha*)
2. *Chu ri ram*: blood essence
3. *Ba ri ram*: joint essence (*tshigs kyi dangs ma*)
4. *Nya ri ram*: foot essence (*rkang gi dangs ma*)
5. *Pancaram*: four elements' essence
[11518-11525] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Rang shar*
**Analysis:** The verse confirms origins:
- *Sha ri ram* from head
- *Chu ri ram* from blood
- *Ba ri ram* from joints
- *Nya ri ram* from feet
- *Pancaram* from four elements' essence

PAGE 267 ANALYSIS
[11575-11586] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** This section presents the SECOND of four major categories under the signs of liberation (grol rtags), focusing on GDUNG (bone essence/relic matrix). The architectural structure follows the standard fourfold analytical framework: 1) nature/essence (ngo bo), 2) causal basis (rgyu), 3) divisions (dbye ba), and 4) result (bras bu). This represents a systematic phenomenological taxonomy of post-death manifestations indicating the deceased's spiritual attainment level. The text establishes gdung as emerging from progressively refined essences (dangs ma), tracing the somatic hierarchy from generation sites to maturation sites.
[11575-11581] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Key terminology analysis: "དངས་མའི་ཤིན་ཏུ་དངས་མ་" - the superlative construction (shin tu + adjective) indicates ultimate refinement. The term གདུང་ carries semantic range from "bone" to "lineage essence" to "sacred relic." Particle ལས་བྱུང་ (ablative + verb) indicates origin. The compound སྐྱེད་པའི་གནས་ (generation site) vs. སྨིན་པའི་གནས་ (maturation site) employs agricultural metaphors (skye = sprout; smin = ripen) applied to somatic processes. Grammar note: lines 11578-11581 use a four-part parallelism marked by དང༌ conjunctions, creating enumerative cadence.
[11582-11585] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The four-fold classification of gdung by color (white, red-yellow, red, blue-green) with corresponding elemental associations reflects the standard rDzogs chen five-element cosmology integrated with Ayurvedic humoral theory (phlegm, bile, wind). This classification system parallels similar taxonomies found in medical tantras (rGyud bzhi) and Kalachakra tradition, though here applied to post-mortemanalysis. The mention of "self-nature emanation body" (rang bzhin sprul sku) at 11586 connects to the three-body (sku gsum) doctrine as articulated in the Sutra of the Ten Bhumis and rDzogs chen texts like the Kunsang Lama'i Shelung.
[11586-11594] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** The ontological distinction between gdung and ring bsrel (relics) emerges here: gdung represents the indestructible diamond-like essence of the practitioner's realization, while ring bsrel are more material remains. The concept of "breathing into the emanation body" (sprul sku'i dbugs 'byin pa) at 11586 indicates a process of transference ('pho ba) or liberation-through-wearing (btags grol). The qualification "not certain for all" (kun ma nges) introduces important soteriological nuance - these signs indicate potential but not deterministic outcomes, reflecting the rDzogs chen emphasis on instantaneous recognition (cig car ba) versus gradual cultivation (rim gyis pa).
[11595-11603] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** Comparative analysis section contrasting gdung and ring bsrel properties. Two-part argument structure: 1) gdung's indestructibility demonstrated through hammer-test thought experiment, 2) ring bsrel's destructibility requiring careful cremation timing. The citation formula ཞེས་པ་དང༌ at 11605 introduces authoritative scriptural support from the Sku Gdung 'Bar ba rtags kyi rgyud, marking transition from prose exposition to metrical citation.
[11595-11609] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Key particle constructions: པས་མི་ཤིགས་ (instrumental + negative + verb) indicates means of non-destruction. The term ལྕགས་ཀྱི་གཏུན་ (iron hammer) employs typical Tibetan metallurgical vocabulary. The conditional ན་ཡང་ (even if) at 11597 introduces hypothetical scenario. Scriptural citation (11600-11609) employs seven-syllable anustubh meter (7+7 pattern) characteristic of tantric revelation texts. Terminological precision: ཏིལ་གྱི་འབྲུ་ (sesame seed) and རྡུལ་ཆ་ (atomic particle) establish scale references.
[11595-11618] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The practical instruction regarding cremation timing (11624: "extremely important not to over-burn") reflects actual mortuary practices in Tibetan Buddhism. The distinction between gdung and ring bsrel corresponds to the Indian Buddhist distinction between dhatu (relics) and sarira, though gdung carries specifically Tibetan tantric connotations tied to the "vajra body" concept. The Sku Gdung 'Bar ba citation represents a terma (gter ma) or revealed treasure text, likely from the rDzogs chen tradition given its emphasis on light phenomena and emanation bodies.
[11610-11618] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** The epistemological criteria for distinguishing ordinary vs. Buddha relics (clarity, five-colored light presence/absence, bodhi tree leaf impressions) reflects Buddhist theories of sacred materiality (dhatuvada). The Bodhi tree criterion references the Mahaparinirvana Sutra tradition where relics exhibit marks corresponding to the Buddha's awakening. The structural marker "third: light" (gsum pa 'od) at 11614 transitions to the next category, maintaining the systematic four-fold enumeration (gdung, ring bsrel, 'od, sgra) established in the root text architecture.

END OF PAGE 267
PAGE 268 ANALYSIS
[11619-11627] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** This page presents the THIRD category ('OD - light phenomena) following the established fourfold analytical framework. The structure follows: nature (ngo bo), cause (rgyu), divisions (dbye ba), and result ('bras bu). This section analyzes light manifestations at death indicating the deceased's level of realization. The progression from elemental essence (elements + awareness) to spontaneous manifestation represents the rdzogs chen emphasis on self-originated wisdom (rang byung ye shes).
[11619-11626] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Key terminology: ཁ་དོག་ལྔ་རང་གསལ་ (five colors self-illuminating) - the reflexive construction རང་ + verb indicates svayam-prabha (self-luminosity), a crucial concept in prajnaparamita and rdzogs chen. The term འབྱུང་བ་དངས་པ་ (clear/pure elements) contrasts with འབྱུང་བ་ངན་པ་ (impure elements) in medical texts. Particle analysis: ལས་འདས་ (transcended/abandoned) at 11621 marks the temporal transition. The phrase གཉིས་འཛོམ་པ་ (union of two) refers to the meeting of material and consciousness principles. Grammar: threefold division marked by contextual particles (skabs kyis).
[11627-11637] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The three types of light (upward-rising, radiating spokes, encircling aureole) correspond to bardo liberation stages. The "sky-hook" (gnam 'then) metaphor at 11625 references the rope/snake simile from the Lankavatara Sutra, indicating sudden recognition. The light-house ('od khyim) imagery connects to the Uttaratantra's "luminosity" (prabhasvara) concept. The timeframe specifications (five days, seven days) derive from the Abhidharmakosha's bardo duration calculations and Guhyasamaja tantra completion stage timing.
[11627-11637] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** Ontological analysis reveals light as the interface between material and immaterial dimensions. The upward-rising light (gyen 'greng) indicates immediate recognition of dharmakaya (ka dag), bypassing the bardo entirely - this represents the "instantaneous liberator" (cig car grol ba). The spoke-radiation (rtsibs shar) indicates completion of the sambhogakaya recognition process within the final bardo. The seven-day and five-day timeframes reflect the completion of purification cycles (sbyong ba) necessary for stabilizing realization in the respective Buddha bodies.
[11638-11655] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** Scriptural citation section from the rDo rje Sems dpa'i Snying gi Me long, employing seven-syllable verse with end-line particle ཞེས་སོ་ marking closure. The citation parallels and confirms the prose exposition, creating a hermeneutical circle between root tantra and commentary. The structure shifts at 11656 to phenomenological description of spontaneous display (lhun grub snang ba).
[11638-11655] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** The root tantra citation employs technical terms: མུ་ཁྱུད་ (encircling aureole/periphery) - architectural term for circular structure, here applied to light halos. བར་དོ་དང་པོ་ (first bardo) vs. བར་དོ་མི་སྣང་བ་ (invisible bardo) - technical distinctions from the Karling Zhitro cycle. Particle གྱུར་ན་ (if it becomes) introduces conditional logic. The phrase སྐད་ཅིག་ལས་ནི་སངས་རྒྱས་ (instantaneously becomes Buddha) employs the emphatic ནི particle for definitive statement.
[11656-11660] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The description of "spontaneously present display emanating forth" (lhun grub snang...'phro ba) references the rdzogs chen doctrine of spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as distinct from original purity (ka dag). The two-fold emanation scheme (rang snang gzugs brnyan vs. gzhan snang rang mtshan) reflects the Yogacara distinction between imagined and dependent natures, adapted to rdzogs chen phenomenology. This passage connects to the Man ngag sde texts' discussion of the "eight displays" (snang ba brgyad).
[11656-11660] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** The soteriological mechanics involve recognition (ngos 'dzin) of self-display (rang snang) versus fixation on external phenomena (gzhan snang). The "two emanations" (sprul pa gnyis) refer to: 1) tulku as self-appearances, and 2) tulku as benefitting others through external emanation. This dual structure parallels the co-emergent wisdom (lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes) doctrine - liberation requires recognizing both dimensions simultaneously. The "six realms of self-display" (rang snang 'gro drug) indicates all samsaric realms are projections of mind, not external locations.

PAGE 269 ANALYSIS
[11661-11673] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** This page completes the light phenomena section with scriptural citation and introduces the FOURTH category: SGRA (sound). The structural pattern continues with the fourfold analytical framework (nature, divisions, cause, result). The transition marker "དེ་ཉིད་ལས་" (from that very [text]) at 11661 connects the preceding exposition to its authoritative source. The progression from visual to auditory phenomena maintains sensory hierarchy (visual primary, auditory secondary) found in Abhidharma taxonomies.
[11661-11673] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** The root tantra citation (11662-11668) employs seven-syllable meter with feminine vocative མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་ (dakini) marking tantric revelation context. Technical terms: སྐལ་ལྡན་སེམས་ཆེན་ (fortunate great beings) - the compound carries soteriological exclusivity. རང་བཞིན་དུ་ (in its own nature) employs the terminological marker for svabhava, though here indicating natural spontaneous activity rather than inherent existence. The structural divider "བཞི་པ་" (fourth) at 11669 introduces the sound category with abbreviated enumeration (only three of four components listed initially).
[11661-11673] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The continuation from rDo rje Sems dpa'i Snying gi Me long reinforces the text's reliance on major rdzogs chen tantras. The description of emanation activity "for the benefit of beings in the ten directions" connects to Mahayana bodhisattva vow literature (Dasabhumika Sutra, Bodhicaryavatara). The phrase "natural emanation" (rang bzhin sprul pa) references the three-nature (trisvabhava) doctrine reconceptualized in rdzogs chen terms - here indicating the natural expression of awareness rather than conditioned arising.
[11674-11685] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** Sound analysis employs binary opposition structure: pleasant/continuous vs. fierce/short (དལ་ལ་རྒྱུན་རིང་བ་ vs. དྲག་ལ་ཡུན་ཐུང་བ་). The causal explanation distinguishes general causes (elemental friction) from specific causes (attainment of stabilization). The directional schema (East-Vajra, South-Ratna, West-Padma, North-Karma, Center-Tathagata) follows standard tantric mandala architecture. The result section establishes a causal chain: sound → enjoyment body → emanation body.
[11674-11685] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Key terminology: རྣ་བའི་དབང་པོ་ (auditory faculty) - standard Abhidharma term. འུར་བ་ (humming/roaring) and ཐུག་པ་ (piercing/staccato) are onomatopoeic terms indicating sound quality. The phrase གཉིས་འཐབས་པའི་རྐྱེན་ (condition of two striking/interacting) employs the technical term for causal condition (pratyaya). Directional markers use locative particles (du, ru, tu) with precision. The term བརྟན་པ་ཐོབ་པ་ (attaining stability) refers to the third of four stages of stabilization in completion stage practice.
[11674-11715] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The directional sound schema reflects the five-Buddha family (panca-tathagata) system central to Anuttarayoga tantras. The sound classification parallels similar taxonomies in Kalachakra (chapter 2) and Hevajra tantras, though adapted for post-mortem analysis. The seven-day and fourteen-day timeframes for attainment of complete Buddhahood derive from the Guhyasamaja system's enumeration of the number of days required for different types of practitioners to achieve complete realization after death.
[11686-11715] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** Epistemological analysis: sound serves as an auditory "proof" (rtags) of the deceased's realization level, analogous to visual light phenomena. The pleasant/fierce binary encodes ethical/aesthetic valuation (zhi ba = peaceful/virtuous; khro bo = wrathful/powerful). The causal mechanism - elemental interaction in space producing sound - mirrors the Samkhya theory of sound as the property of space/ether (akasha), here integrated into Buddhist elemental theory. The "stabilization attainment" (brtan pa thob pa) refers to the irreversible stage (avinivartaniya) where retrogression becomes impossible.

END OF PAGE 269
PAGE 270 ANALYSIS
[11716-11725] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** This page completes the sound category with root tantra citation and introduces the FIFTH category: G.YO BA (movement/earthquake). The structural pattern of fourfold analysis continues (nature, cause, divisions, result). The movement category represents the transition from subtle phenomena (light, sound) to gross somatic/environmental manifestations. The binary temporal schema (seven days vs. fourteen days) parallels previous categories, maintaining systematic consistency.
[11716-11723] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Root tantra citation from rDo rje Sems dpa'i Snying gi Me long continues, employing technical terminology: འུར་གྱིས་བྱུང་ (arising through humming) vs. ཐུག་གིས་བྱུང་ (arising through piercing sound). Temporal markers ཞག་བདུན་ (seven days) and ཞག་བཅུ་བཞི་ (fourteen days) use classical Tibetan time reckoning. The structural divider "ལྔ་པ་" (fifth) at 11720 introduces movement category with abbreviated analytical headings (only four components without explicit nature heading initially).
[11716-11725] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The seven-day vs. fourteen-day distinction reflects different capacities of practitioners - those with prior familiarization (sbyangs pa) versus those requiring extended stabilization. This temporal framework derives from the Abhidharma kosha's analysis of bardo duration and the Guhyasamaja tantra's completion stage timing. The sound-arousal types ('ur vs. thug) may correspond to the "light-sound-rays" (od sgra zer) triad fundamental to rdzogs chen cosmogony.
[11724-11744] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** Movement analysis establishes a hierarchical taxonomy: 1) container world as support, 2) animate beings as supported. This reflects the standard Buddhist "container and contained" (snod bcud) cosmological framework. The fourfold division of movement (rab tu g.yo ba, cher g.yo ba, kun tu rab tu g.yo ba, and implied fourth) creates scalar intensity. The results section maps movement onto bodhisattva stages (sa), creating a comprehensive soteriological cartography.
[11724-11744] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Technical terminology: སྣོད་ཀྱི་འོག་གཞི་ (container world's base) - standard Abhidharma term for the physical world as "vessel" for sentient beings. སྐྱེ་འགྲོ་ (animate beings) contrasts with སྣོད་ (container). ནུས་པས་རླུང་བསྐུལ་ (power/mastery propels wind) - indicates tantric wind-energy (vayu/rlung) mechanics. The phrase ཐུན་མོང་བ་ (common/shared) vs. special indicates path typology. Bodhisattva stage terminology follows Dasabhumika Sutra enumeration (rab tu dga' ba, etc.).
[11730-11760] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The three temporal divisions (three days, six days, nine days) for different stage-attainments create a precise soteriological chronometry. The enumeration of sravaka stages (four) and bodhisattva stages (ten + one result stage) reflects standard Mahayana path structures from the Abhisamayalamkara. The four vidyadhara stages (rig 'dzin sa bzhi) - matured, life-mastery, mahamudra, spontaneous accomplishment - derive specifically from the Maha-yoga and Anu-yoga tantra systems, particularly the Guhyagarbha tantra.
[11724-11760] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** The ontological mechanism: the deceased's mastery (nus pa) activates wind-energy (rlung) causing physical movement. This reflects the tantric "vajra body" theory where consciousness-winds animate the physical realm. The scalar typology of movement intensity correlates with realization depth - greater movement indicates higher attainment. The bodhisattva stage mapping demonstrates the text's syncretic integration of sutra and tantra path structures, a hallmark of the rNying ma scholastic tradition. The qualification that these practitioners "do not quickly attain results" (myur du 'bras bu mi thob) introduces important nuance about path differences - sravakas and bodhisattvas require extended cultivation compared to tantric instantaneous liberators.

END OF PAGE 270
PAGE 271 ANALYSIS
**Analysis:** This page completes the movement category's bodhisattva stage analysis and presents scriptural citation from Sku Gdung 'Bar ba rtags kyi rgyud. The structure maintains the temporal-stage mapping (3 days, 6 days, 9 days) for sravaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva, and vidyadhara attainments. The verse citation at 11766-11784 employs seven-syllable meter with feminine vocative མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་ and closing particle ཞེས་སོ་, confirming tantric revelation context.
**Analysis:** Technical terminology: རིག་པ་འཛིན་པའི་ས་ (vidyadhara stages) - specific enumeration follows Guhyagarbha tantra: rnam par smin pa'i sa, tshe la dbang ba'i sa, phyag rgya chen po'i sa, lhun gyis grub pa'i sa. Temporal markers use locative-associative particles (zhag ni gsum na yang). The term ཅི་དགར་སྤྱོད་པ་ (freedom to act as wished) indicates the acintya/chen po'i spyod yul (unimaginable activity sphere) of high tantric attainments. Scriptural citation employs conditional logic: གལ་ཏེ...གྱུར་ན་ནི་ (if...occurs, then).
**Analysis:** The eight sravaka stages (dmun pa'i sa brgyad) listed at 11735-11741 reflect the Vaibhasika/Abhidharma system: rigs (gotra), brgyad pa (eighth), mthong ba (darsana), srib pa (elimination of defilements), byas pa rtogs pa (understanding of the conditioned), then four arya stages (rgyun zhugs, phyir 'ong, phyir mi 'ong, dgra bcom pa). The bodhisattva ten stages follow Dasabhumika Sutra enumeration. The criticism of those who confuse vehicle-doors and entry-paths (theg pa'i sgo dang 'jug lam so so) at 11785 reflects ongoing sectarian debates about sudden vs. gradual paths in Tibetan Buddhism.
**Analysis:** The epistemological critique at 11785-11793 employs the simile of "measuring the time to Lhasa for those who travel by different means" to illustrate that different paths (sutra vs. tantra) have different temporal requirements. This represents the rNying ma hermeneutical position on the "nine vehicles" (theg pa dgu) - each vehicle valid but with different efficiencies. The principle of "path-specific means and prajna activity" (lam so so'i thabs dang shes rab kyi byed pa) establishes the necessity of vehicle-appropriate practice, rejecting reductionist attempts to conflate all paths into a single timeline.
**Analysis:** The text transitions to SECOND MAIN TOPIC: "'Gro drug 'khrul pas skye ba len pa'i rtags" (signs of the six realms taking birth through delusion). This represents the samsaric counterpart to the preceding nirvanic/liberation signs. The structure employs binary opposition: two paths (chos nyid bardo vs. srid pa bardo) and two results (Buddha vs. sentient being). The five paths to buddhahood (tshogs lam through mthar phyin pa'i lam) versus five delusion paths create comprehensive path typology.
**Analysis:** Key terminology: འགྲོ་དྲུག་ (six realms/gatis) - standard samsaric cosmology. འཁྲུལ་པ་ (delusion/error) indicates fundamental ignorance ('khrul gzhi). ཆོས་ཉིད་ཀྱི་བར་མ་དོ་ (dharmata bardo) vs. སྲིད་པའི་བར་མ་དོ་ (srid pa bardo) - the classical pair from the Bardo thodrol literature. The five paths to buddhahood use standard Sanskrit-derived Tibetan terms: tshogs lam (sambhara-marga), sbyor lam (prayoga-marga), mthong lam (darsana-marga), sgom lam (bhavana-marga), mthar phyin pa'i lam (nistha-marga/nisya-marga).
**Analysis:** The five paths structure derives from the Abhisamayalamkara's presentation of the Mahayana path, common to all Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The five delusion paths (rmig lam, bag chags kyi lam, las kyi mtha'i lam, etc.) represent specifically tantric categorization of samsaric rebirth processes found in the Karling Zhitro and related bardo literature. The binary framework (liberation vs. delusion, two paths, two results) reflects the fundamental Buddhist soteriological structure of nirvana vs. samsara, though here elaborated with bardo-specific phenomenology.
