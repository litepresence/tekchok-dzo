[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the exhaustion of dharmatā (chos nyid zad pa) through comparative metaphor [5398-5401], existential implications [5402-5411], and definitional analysis [5412-5428]. The structure employs analogy (birth-death four), causal reasoning (pas/bas), and enumeration (rim gyis/cig car). The passage concludes with technical definitions distinguishing conditioned vs. unconditioned exhaustion.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5398]: skye rga na 'chi bzhi'i 'phel zad pa (birth-aging-illness-death four's waxing-waning): biological metaphor for cosmic cycles. phyis snod (outer vessel/container): inanimate environment. nang bcud (inner essence): sentient beings.
Line [5402-5411]: 'khrul pa'i chos (delusion dharmas): phenomena of error. chos nyid don dam (dharmatā ultimate): ultimate truth. chos can dang chos nyid (dharmin and dharmatā): subject and nature distinction.
Line [5412-5418]: kun gzhi'i cha sgo gsum (all-base's three doors): body-speech-mind as expressions of fundamental ignorance (ma rig pa). rtsa ba'i ma rig pa (root ignorance): original non-recognition.
Line [5424-5428]: rim gyis (gradual) vs. cig car (instantaneous): classical distinction in Buddhist praxis. snang ba bzhi tshad du phyin pa (four visions arriving at measure): completion of visionary path as prerequisite for gradual exhaustion.
[CONTEXT] This passage addresses a critical juncture in Dzogchen theory—the "exhaustion" of phenomena into dharmatā. The distinction between gradual (rim gyis) and instantaneous (cig car) exhaustion reflects broader Tibetan debates about realization modalities. The cosmic metaphor (outer vessel/inner essence) derives from Abhidharma cosmology but reinterpreted through Dzogchen's lens of spontaneous perfection. The critique of denying form-kāya (sku) and wisdom (ye shes) in result-phase reflects Nyingma polemics against nihilistic interpretations of emptiness.
[CONCEPT]
• Exhaustion modalities:
- Gradual: four visions completed, phenomena gradually dissolve
- Instantaneous: immediate recognition of dharmatā, simultaneous liberation
- Supreme intellect instantaneous (blo mchog cig car): special capacity
• Dharmatā exhaustion dimensions:
- Outer: five-light vision with form-kāya exhausted
- Inner: subtle body with thought-aggregates exhausted
- Secret: experience-vision objects exhausted
- Result: pure-from-beginning vision cloudless sky-like
• Cosmological parallels:
- Birth-aging-illness-death waxing-waning
- Outer vessel disintegration
- Inner essence lifespan limits
- Three realms non-liberation if incomplete
[STRUCTURE] This page presents detailed definitional analysis of dharmatā exhaustion through fivefold schema [5432-5457]: essence (ngo bo), definition (nges tshig), nature (rang bzhin), dharmatā proper (chos nyid), and boundary (sa mtshams). The structure employs scriptural citation (Thal 'gyur), etymological analysis, and dialectical reasoning to establish precise technical understanding.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5438-5441]: phyi 'od lnga'i snang ba (outer five-light vision): perceptual dimension of exhaustion. nang rdos bcas rtog tshogs (inner with subtle body thought-aggregates): cognitive-somatic dimension. nyams snang gi yul (experience-vision objects): phenomenal content.
Line [5450-5456]: chos (dharma/phenomena): lus ngag sems kyi tshogs pa (body-speech-mind aggregates) including nyon mongs (afflictions). zad pa (exhaustion): stong pa (emptiness/void), blo'i sgom pa yul snang dang bcas pa rang log nas med (meditation's objects with appearance self-reverse into non-existence).
Line [5457]: mi dmigs pa (non-observation): epistemological state where subject-object duality collapses; Madhyamaka term adapted for Dzogchen context.
[CONTEXT] This passage provides systematic philosophical analysis of the fourth vision's culmination. The fivefold definitional schema (ngo bo, nges tshig, rang bzhin, chos nyid, sa mtshams) derives from Indian pramāṇa tradition applied to Dzogchen phenomenology. The Thal 'gyur citation authenticates the technical description within the Snying thig lineage. The equation of exhaustion with emptiness (stong pa) reflects the integration of Madhyamaka and Dzogchen soteriologies—exhaustion is not mere cessation but recognition of primordial emptiness.
[CONCEPT]
• Fivefold definitional schema:
- Essence (ngo bo): outer-inner-secret dimensions of exhaustion
- Definition (nges tshig): phenomena as aggregates with afflictions
- Nature (rang bzhin): spontaneous dissolution of appearance-emptiness
- Dharmatā: path appearances with luminous-clear meditation
- Boundary: transition point from manifestation to pure domain
• Exhaustion mechanics:
- Experience-vision empties (nyams kyi snang ba stongs)
- Body exhausted, sense-objects exhausted (lus zad dbang po'i yul yang zad)
- Thought-aggregates liberated from delusion (rtog tshogs 'khrul pa las grol)
- Beyond expression and ground (brjod gzhis tshig dang bral)
• Non-observation (mi dmigs pa):
- Meditation and objects self-reverse
- Beyond conceptuality yet not void
- Dharmatā as ultimate fact (don gyi 'bras bu)
[STRUCTURE] This page presents the result-phase implications of exhaustion through teleological analysis [5477-5481], scriptural citation [5482-5498], and philosophical synthesis [5499-5515]. The structure moves from soteriological attainment (empowerment as regent) to cosmological transformation (elements dissolving), concluding with critical distinctions about emptiness interpretation.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5477-5478]: rgyun gyi ting nge 'dzin (continuum samadhi): unbroken meditative absorption. chos nyid kyi 'khor lo (dharmatā wheel/chakra): mandala of ultimate nature. spyan dang mngon shes chen po (eyes and great superknowledges): five eyes and six clairvoyances. khams gsum chos kyi rgyal po'i rgyal tshab (regent of dharma-king of three realms): attainment equivalence with Buddha.
Line [5482-5498]: Thal 'gyur citation on dissolution: 'byung ba dengs pa (elements dissolving), rdos pa 'gag (subtle body ceasing), rdul dang phra rab (atoms and particles), nyon mongs dengs pa (afflictions dissolving), bag la nyal (latency), kun nas ldang (arising).
Line [5499-5502]: stong pa'i chos nyid (emptiness dharmatā): rtsa rlung rags pa (channels winds coarse) exhaustion leading to sems dang sems byung (mind and mental factors) exhaustion. nang dbyings (inner expanse): dimension into which visions dissolve.
[CONTEXT] This passage marks the culmination of the four visions discussion, establishing the soteriological result of exhaustion-practice. The "regent of the dharma-king" (chos kyi rgyal po'i rgyal tshab) terminology reflects Mahāyāna political metaphors for buddhahood. The Thal 'gyur citation describes the somatic transformation—progressive dissolution of elements (earth-water-fire-air-space) followed by subtle body (rdos pa) cessation, culminating in wisdom-kāya. The critique of "snying tig pa" who deny form-kāya and wisdom in result-phase reflects internal Nyingma debates about the status of manifestation post-realization.
[CONCEPT]
• Attainment hierarchy:
- Continuum samadhi in dharmatā chakra
- Five eyes and six superknowledges mastery
- Three realms dharma-king regent empowerment
- All-base subtle obscurations severed
• Cosmic dissolution sequence:
- Elements dissolve ('byung ba dengs pa)
- Subtle body ceases (rdos pa 'gag)
- Atoms and particles extinguished
- Afflictions and latency dissolved
- Five aggregates gradually refined
- All becomes wisdom completion-kāya
• Critical distinctions:
- Spontaneous completion requires form-kāya/wisdom
- Uncompounded does not mean annihilation
- Manifestation ground for sentient beings' welfare
- Samantabhadra's compassion display requires basis
[STRUCTURE] This page presents critical philosophical analysis addressing potential misinterpretations of emptiness in Dzogchen result-phase [5516-5523], followed by boundary-marker analysis [5524-5539]. The structure employs dialectical reasoning (gal ba/contradiction), teleological analysis, and phenomenological description of the transition point (sa mtshams) between measure-completion and exhaustion.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5516-5518]: 'bras bu'i ka dag (result pure-from-beginning): term for fruition-phase primordial purity. snying tig pa: follower of Snying thig tradition (possibly pejorative in this context). shel 'od (crystal light): metaphor for transparent luminosity. dgongs pa ma lon pa (intent not realized): failure to understand implicit meaning.
Line [5519-5523]: lhun grub (spontaneous completion): one of two aspects of ground (gzhi) along with ka dag. 'dus ma byas (uncompounded): asaṃskṛta, unconditioned. gtan brlag (annihilation): nihilistic destruction, denied as implication. 'char gzhi (manifestation ground): basis from which appearance arises for others' benefit.
Line [5524-5539]: sa mtshams (boundary/limit): transition between phases. rkang lag bzhi'i sor mo (four limbs' digits): fingers-toes as somatic markers. 'od lnga (five lights): elemental colors. 'khyil ba (coiled/withdrawn): description of awareness absorbed into dharmakāya.
[CONTEXT] This passage represents Longchenpa's philosophical defense of Dzogchen against nihilistic interpretation. The critique targets those who, understanding emptiness (stong pa nyid) literally, deny all manifestation in the result-phase. Longchenpa argues this contradicts: (1) spontaneous completion (lhun grub), (2) uncompounded nature (not annihilation), (3) compassionate activity for beings, and (4) Samantabhadra's own display. This reflects Nyingma internal debates and broader Tibetan Buddhist concerns about Hva-shang-style "emptiness of everything" misinterpretations. The boundary-marker description provides concrete phenomenological criteria for transition between third and fourth visions.
[CONCEPT]
• Philosophical errors critiqued:
- Denying form-kāya and wisdom in result
- Confusing uncompounded with annihilation
- Negating manifestation ground for others' benefit
- Undermining compassionate activity
• Boundary markers (sa mtshams):
- Five lights visible in digits
- Transition to inner expanse
- Outer vision return-turning point
- Form-kāya's capacity for others' welfare
• Coiled absorption ('khyil ba):
- Awareness enters dharmakāya
- Like crystal light withdrawing inward
- Body and vision's self-resonance reverses
- Inner-clear spontaneous-completion jewel treasury
[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes mastery over birth and manifestation [5540-5557] through simile [5540-5542], scriptural authority [5543-5545], and functional description [5546-5557]. The structure employs analogical reasoning (mirror, water-moon), causal markers (pas/bas), and enumerative logic (two powers). The passage concludes with teleological implications for benefitting beings.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5540-5542]: me long gi gzugs brnyan (mirror image): simile for delusory appearance—apparent yet insubstantial. chu'i zla ba (water-moon): classical metaphor for reflection-emptiness. ye shes sgyu ma'i sku (wisdom illusion-kāya): nirmāṇakāya as wisdom-display. zang thal (unimpeded): quality of realized manifestation. rdo rje'i sku (vajra-kāya): indestructible body of awakening.
Line [5543-5545]: slob dpon chen po bi ma la (great teacher Vimalamitra): Indian master who transmitted Dzogchen to Tibet. padma bzhin no: Padmasambhava, "Like Padma," indicating equivalent attainment.
Line [5546-5557]: skye ba la dbang ba (power over birth): capacity to emanate at will. 'jug pa la dbang ba (power over entry/engagement): capacity to interact with phenomena. sems can gsum stong (three thousand sentient beings): standard Buddhist numerical expression for vast numbers.
[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the soteriological result of Dzogchen practice—attainment equivalent to Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava. The "great transference body" ('pho ba chen mo'i sku) represents the highest Nyingma classification of realization, where the practitioner leaves the body as light without remainder. The two powers (over birth and engagement) correspond to nirmāṇakāya capacities—spontaneous emanation and skillful interaction. The emphasis on others' vision (gzhan gyi mig ma dag pa) explains why ordinary beings perceive the master's physical body while realized beings perceive the light-form.
[CONCEPT]
• Attainment equivalence:
- Mirror-like delusory appearance
- Water-moon wisdom-illusion body
- Unimpeded vajra-kāya
- Great transference embodiment
• Two powers (dbang):
- Power over birth (skye ba): emanation at will
- Power over engagement ('jug pa): interaction with phenomena
- Simultaneous liberation of three thousand beings
- Insects also dissolve into light
• Somatic markers:
- Others' impure vision sees only physical body
- Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava as exemplars
- Self-power mastery (rang dbang 'byor ba)
- Benefitting beings until samsara empties
[STRUCTURE] This page synthesizes the four visions as path-arising stages (lam skye ba'i rim pa) through scriptural citation [5566-5589], metaphorical illustration [5590-5591], and comparative analysis [5592-5599]. The structure employs citation markers (zhes so), comparative particles ('dra'o), and superlative reasoning (khyad par du 'phags pa).
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5566]: gsang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud (Secret Practice Seed Tantra): citation from Gsang ba snying po or related tantra. nang lus zad pa'i sar phyin (arriving at inner body exhaustion stage): technical description of completion-phase.
Line [5567-5589]: Verse citation on: sor mo (fingers) as locus of light-emanation, 'byung ba rang dengs (elements self-dissolve), skye 'jug khyad par (birth-entry distinction), chos kun zad pa (all dharmas exhausted), 'dzin pa med (without grasping), sprul pa'i sku (nirmāṇakāya), 'jug shugs (entry-momentum), skye ba rang dbang (birth self-power), snang ba'i rang sgra (vision's self-sound), sil snyad (rustling), 'khrul par snang (appear as delusion), sems can don kun (all beings' welfare), rig pa mnyam gcig (awareness singular equality), 'pho ba chen mo (great transference), rim dang cig car (gradual and instantaneous), sa mchog dkyil 'khor chen po (supreme ground great mandala).
Line [5590-5591]: skas kyi gdang bu (stairway steps): metaphor for progressive yet connected stages. Lam skye ba'i rim pa (path-arising stages): Dzogchen equivalent to bodhisattva bhūmis.
[CONTEXT] This passage synthesizes the four visions as stages of path-arising (lam skye ba'i rim pa)—a Dzogchen reconceptualization of the bodhisattva path. The Gsang ba snying po citation grounds the presentation in canonical tantra. The stairway metaphor captures Dzogchen's unique position: stages exist as descriptive categories yet are simultaneously transcended in instantaneous recognition. The comparison with "common vehicles" (theg pa thun mong ba) establishes Dzogchen's superiority while acknowledging shared soteriological goals. The emphasis on diligent practice (brtson pas nyams su len pa) despite the rhetoric of spontaneity reflects Longchenpa's balanced presentation.
[CONCEPT]
• Four visions as path stages:
- Dharmatā vision: initial recognition
- Increasing experience: maturation
- Awareness at measure: completion
- Exhaustion: liberation into ground
• Stairway metaphor:
- Stages like steps on ladder
- Each stage supports the next
- Yet all are single continuum
- Path-arising without separate attainment
• Superiority to common vehicles:
- Four visions as Dzogchen bhūmis
- Exhaustion of outflows (zag bcas)
- Buddha-appearance in this life
- Result-vehicle distinction
[STRUCTURE] This page continues the synthesis of four visions as path stages with scriptural citation [5600-5615], structural markers defining diligence (brtson 'grus) [5616-5645], and concluding exhortation. The passage employs enumeration (seven branches), quotative authentication, and teleological reasoning.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5600-5615]: Verse citation on 'gro ba'i don (beings' welfare), pha rol phyin (pāramitā), dngos grub (siddhis), tshogs gnyis (two accumulations), lam 'di (this path), snying po (essence), gces pa (precious), zad pa'i lus (exhausted body), dngos med (non-substantial), gsang sngags (secret mantra), rdzogs rim (completion stage), blo yi yul (mind's object), sbyor drug (six applications), yon tan (qualities), dgos 'dod (needs and desires).
Line [5616-5620]: brtson 'grus (diligence/vīrya): defined as dam pa'i chos la dga' ba (joy in sublime dharma) + nyams su len pa (putting into practice).
Line [5621-5645]: Seven branches (yan lag bdun): snyan ngag (poetry/kāvya), brda' gsang (secret symbols/sandhabhāṣa), grub mtha' (philosophical systems), bsdus don (condensed meaning), mchan 'grel (annotations), le'u 'grel (chapter commentary), gal mdo (critical analysis)—the complete scholarly apparatus for textual study.
[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the practical requirements for Dzogchen realization—diligent practice supported by comprehensive study. The seven branches represent the complete Tibetan monastic curriculum applied to Dzogchen texts. The emphasis on "this life's body" (tshe 'di'i lus) reflects Nyingma assertions about attainability of full awakening in a single lifetime, distinct from gradualist paths requiring countless eons. The reference to six applications (sbyor drug) of Guhyasamāja completion stage demonstrates Dzogchen's integration of classical tantric methodology while transcending it.
[CONCEPT]
• Diligence definition:
- Joy in sublime dharma
- Putting into practice
- Not mere study but realization
- Single life attainment possible
• Seven scholarly branches:
- Poetry (snyan ngag): literary refinement
- Secret symbols (brda' gsang): tantric code
- Philosophical systems (grub mtha'): doxography
- Condensed meaning (bsdus don): summary
- Annotations (mchan 'grel): glosses
- Chapter commentary (le'u 'grel): structural analysis
- Critical analysis (gal mdo): polemics

- Qualities and needs spontaneously fulfilled
[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the three immovabilities (mi 'gul ba gsum) and three stabilizations (sdod pa gsum) through enumeration markers [5646-5760], causal analysis [5761-5768], and concluding synthesis. The structure employs tripartite division (body, wind, vision) with three subdivisions each, creating a ninefold schema of stabilization.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5646-5650]: tshig gi 'dre ldog (word's reversal/counter): reversal of conceptual fixation. tshig rang byung gi ye shes (word self-arisen wisdom): spontaneous wisdom beyond language. rang gi brjod pa (self-expression): auto-communication of realization.
Line [5651-5653]: gtad pa'i 'bem (focused inert): concentrated fixation. sangs rgyas kyi dgongs pa (buddha's intent): enlightened perspective. dbyings kyi go rar tshud pa (entered domain's portal): access to expanse.
Line [5657-5660]: 'gul bas 'gyu 'gyus pas ldog pa (reverse by moving-agitation): technical definition of immovability—freedom from fluctuation. gnyen po (antidote): counteractive factor.
Line [5671-5685]: Body three stabilizations: las dang bral ba (free from activity), 'khrul pa 'phel med (delusion not increase), las kyi rnam smin dang bral ba (free from action's ripening). Wind three stabilizations: rkyen snang tha dad pas gnod pa med (conditions' various appearances not harm), rnam rtog tha dad kyi rten med (various thoughts' support not exist), 'khor 'das gnyis su 'dzin pa'i gzhi stongs pa (samsara-nirvana duality's basis empty).
[CONTEXT] This passage presents the stabilization phase of Dzogchen practice—the consolidation of recognition into unshakeable realization. The three immovabilities correspond to three gates (body, speech/wind, mind/vision), while the three stabilizations provide more detailed phenomenology of each. The "focused inert" (gtad pa'i 'bem) refers to concentrated fixation that must be transcended—the paradox of effortful non-effort. The "portal of the domain" (dbyings kyi go ra) terminology derives from Mahāyoga spatial metaphors for Dzogchen expanse. The passage reflects Longchenpa's systematic presentation of practice phases beyond initial recognition.
[CONCEPT]
• Three immovabilities (mi 'gul ba gsum):
- Body: free from activity fixation
- Speech/wind: free from conditionality
- Mind/vision: free from samsara-nirvana duality
• Three stabilizations (sdod pa gsum) detailed:
- Body: activity non-abiding, limb extension-contraction ceased, activity established in ground
- Wind: not going outward, not held inward, no going-coming
- Vision: no flickering in light, no wavering in awareness, no trembling in form
• Ninefold schema:
- Each gate has three degrees of stabilization
- Progressive deepening from coarse to subtle
- Culminating in four measures of body, speech, mind
[STRUCTURE] This page continues the analysis of three stabilizations focusing on vision [5769-5784], introduces the four measures (tshad bzhi) [5785-5795], and presents the three perfect knowledges (gzhi shes gsum) [5796-5810]. The structure employs enumeration, scriptural citation, and definitional analysis, concluding with teleological synthesis.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5769-5784]: 'od la 'phrig pa med par sdod pa (stabilization without flickering in light): vision stabilization one. rig pa la 'phrig pa med pa (without wavering in awareness): two. sku la 'dar ba med pa (without trembling in form): three. dbang bzhi (four empowerments): anuttarayoga tantric initiations.
Line [5785-5795]: tshad bzhi (four measures): lus kyi tshad (body measure—dbang bzhi'i gzhi la nges pa), ngag gi tshad (speech measure—dbang bzhi'i lam nges pa), sems kyi tshad (mind measure—dbang bzhi'i 'bras bu nges pa), phyir mi ldog pa'i tshad (non-return measure).
Line [5796-5810]: gzhi shes gsum (three ground knowledges): gzhi (ground), lam (path), 'bras bu (result). yid ches (confidence/faith): epistemic trust. phyir ldog (return): regression from realization.
[CONTEXT] This passage integrates tantric empowerment theory (dbang bzhi) with Dzogchen stabilization practice. The four measures establish concrete criteria for progress: body measure through empowerment basis certainty, speech measure through empowerment path certainty, mind measure through empowerment result certainty, and non-return measure through irreversibility. The three ground knowledges parallel the classical Buddhist triad of ground-path-result but reconceived from Dzogchen's spontaneous perspective. The emphasis on "four visions arriving at measure" (snang ba bzhi tshad du phyin pa) as irreversible indicates the point of no return on the path.
[CONCEPT]
• Four measures (tshad bzhi):
- Body: four empowerments' basis certainty
- Speech: four empowerments' path certainty
- Mind: four empowerments' result certainty
- Non-return: irreversible from liberation
• Four signs of body measure completion:
- Four empowerments' basis obtained
- Four signs: body light, speech melody, mind non-conceptual
- Body karmic outflows exhausted
- Spontaneous completion of realization
• Three ground knowledges (gzhi shes gsum):
- Ground: original purity recognized
- Path: meditation without separation
- Result: confidence in attainment
- Teleology: three times equality
[STRUCTURE] This page presents the definitive meaning of exhaustion (zad pa nges don) through scriptural citation [5811-5825], definitional analysis [5826-5840], and enumerative exposition of four visions arriving at measure [5841-5850]. The structure employs quotative authentication, etymological analysis, and teleological synthesis.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5811-5825]: Verse citation on chos rnams zad pa (dharmas exhausted), blo yi yul (mind's object), nges pa med (no certainty), sprul sku'i snang ba (nirmāṇakāya vision), 'ja' lus (rainbow body), sems kyi dri ma (mind's stain), dbang po (sense faculty), dngos su (actually), zad pa'i lus (exhausted body), rdo rje sku (vajra body), lhun grub (spontaneous completion).
Line [5826-5840]: zad pa'i nges don (exhaustion's definitive meaning): distinguished from provisional ('khrul snang—delusory appearance) and pure ka dag (pure-from-beginning). chos zad pa'i snang ba (dharmas exhausted vision): phenomena naturally self-liberated.
Line [5841-5850]: snang ba bzhi tshad du phyin pa (four visions arriving at measure): enumerated as chos nyid snang ba (dharmatā vision), nyams gong 'phel (increasing experience), rig pa tshad phebs (awareness arriving at measure), chos zad pa (exhaustion of dharmas).
[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the relationship between exhaustion (zad pa) and spontaneous completion (lhun grub) as result-phase attainments. The rainbow body ('ja' lus) appears as the somatic signature of complete realization—the body dissolves into light leaving only hair and nails, or nothing at all. The distinction between delusory appearance ('khrul snang) and exhaustion-vision (chos zad pa'i snang ba) clarifies that exhaustion is not mere cessation but recognition of primordial purity. The four visions as definitive criteria provide measurable indicators of progress on the path.
[CONCEPT]
• Definitive meaning of exhaustion:
- Not mere cessation but recognition
- Natural self-liberation of phenomena
- Spontaneous completion as result
- Rainbow body as somatic proof
• Four visions as criteria:
- Dharmatā vision: initial recognition
- Increasing experience: maturation
- Awareness at measure: completion
- Exhaustion: final liberation
• Somatic transformation:
- Body's karmic outflows exhausted
- Sense faculties transformed
- Vajra body attained
- Spontaneously complete without practice
[STRUCTURE] This page presents the sixteenth topic—three recognitions (ngos shes gsum)—through enumeration markers [5851-5865], detailed exposition [5866-5880], and concluding synthesis [5881-5895]. The structure employs tripartite division of recognition types and their respective functions in the path.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5851-5865]: ngo shes (recognition): technical term for correct identification of meditative experiences. yid ches (confidence): epistemic certainty. lam 'di'i gnad (this path's crucial point): essential instruction.
Line [5866-5880]: snang ba'i ngo shes (vision recognition): identifying visionary phenomena correctly. rig pa'i ngo shes (awareness recognition): recognizing awareness-nature. blo yi ngo shes (mind recognition): cognitive certainty. zad pa'i ngo shes (exhaustion recognition): understanding exhaustion-phase. gnas skabs (occasion): temporary state. mthar thug (final limit): ultimate destination.
Line [5881-5895]: de dag nyams su len (practice those): application phase. phyir mi ldog pa'i nges pa (non-return certainty): irreversible attainment. 'khrul rtog (delusion-thought): erroneous cognition to be abandoned.
[CONTEXT] This passage establishes recognition (ngo shes) as the cognitive foundation of Dzogchen practice. Unlike gradual paths that emphasize transformation, Dzogchen emphasizes recognition of what is already present. The four recognitions provide diagnostic tools for navigating the four visions: recognizing visions as self-display, recognizing awareness as the ground, recognizing mind's constructs, and recognizing exhaustion as perfection. The emphasis on "this life's body" (tshe 'di'i lus) reflects Nyingma assertions about attainability of full awakening without awaiting future lives.
[CONCEPT]
• Four recognitions (ngo shes bzhi):
- Vision recognition: identifying visionary marks
- Awareness recognition: knowing the knower
- Mind recognition: distinguishing conceptual from non-conceptual
- Exhaustion recognition: understanding dissolution
• Recognition functions:
- Diagnostic: identifying path stages
- Prognostic: predicting attainment
- Therapeutic: correcting errors
- Teleological: orienting toward goal
• Practice requirements:
- Put into practice (nyams su len)
- Non-return certainty
- Abandon delusion-thought
- Final limit as destination
[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes characteristics, confidence, and non-confusion (mtshan nyid yid ches 'khrul med) through fivefold definitional schema [5896-5920], scriptural citation [5921-5930], and concluding synthesis. The structure employs enumeration (five aspects), etymological analysis, and phenomenological description.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5896-5920]: mtshan nyid (characteristics): defining marks. yid ches (confidence): epistemic trust. 'khrul med (non-confusion): error-free recognition. nges shes (certain knowledge): definite understanding. blo yi yul (mind's object): cognitive domain.

[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the epistemological foundations of Dzogchen practice—certain knowledge (nges shes) of appearance-emptiness inseparability. The five aspects provide a comprehensive framework: (1) characteristics—knowing what to recognize, (2) confidence—trust in the path, (3) non-confusion—freedom from error, (4) certain knowledge—definite understanding, (5) mind's object—cognitive domain. The verse citation grounds the presentation in canonical authority, emphasizing luminous-clear self-arisen wisdom as the nature of mind.
[CONCEPT]
• Five aspects of recognition:
- Characteristics: defining marks of stages
- Confidence: epistemic trust in path
- Non-confusion: error-free discrimination
- Certain knowledge: definite understanding
- Mind's object: cognitive domain mastery
• Appearance-emptiness inseparability:
- Not first appearance then emptiness
- Simultaneous co-emergence
- Naturally pure from beginning
- Self-arisen wisdom as basis
• Teleological implications:
- Three thousand worlds as domain
- Nectar of immortality
- Mind's stains purified
- Perfect buddhahood attained
[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the sixteenth topic's concluding section on three immovabilities (mi 'gul ba gsum) through enumeration [5931-5945], scriptural citation [5946-5960], and final synthesis. The structure employs tripartite division, comparative analysis, and teleological conclusion.

[CONTEXT] This passage concludes the detailed analysis of Tögal practice with the mind's three immovabilities. The progression from body (physical) to wind (energetic) to mind (cognitive) represents the standard subtle-body hierarchy in tantric Buddhism. The verse citation emphasizes mind-itself (sems nyid) as dharmakāya—a key Dzogchen formulation distinguishing between ordinary mind (sems) and mind-nature (sems nyid). The integration of ground-path-result (gzhi-lam-'bras bu) provides the overarching framework for understanding Dzogchen as both transcendence of and completion within Buddhist soteriology.
