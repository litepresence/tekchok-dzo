[7452-7454] [STRUCTURE] Self-Liberation Chapter Opening
**Analysis:** This page initiates the *rang grol* (self-liberation) methodology section within the Ati Vajra Heart Essence (*ati rdo rje snying po*) chapter. The tripartite structure follows classical Tibetan exegetical format: *spyir bstan pa* (general explanation), *bye brag tu bshad pa* (particular explanation), and *rgyas par brjod pa* (extensive expression). The text positions Atiyoga against seven soteriological methods through systematic negation.
[7452] [PHILOLOGY] *Rang grol gyi go don*
**Analysis:** The term *rang grol* (self-liberation) derives from *rang* (self/own) + *grol* (liberate/release). The compound suggests reflexive liberation without external agency. This opening formula (*go don spyir bstan pa*) establishes the hermeneutical framework for the section.
[7455-7490] [CONTEXT] Seven Soteriological Methods
**Analysis:** The page systematically negates lower approaches to establish *rang grol* uniqueness:
1. **Hearer/Self-Realized Vehicle** (*nyan rang*): abandonment methodology
2. **Bodhisattva Vehicle** (*sems dpa'*): gradual practice
3. **Lower Mantra** (*sngags 'og ma*): generation stage (*bskyed rim*) transformation
4. **Completion Stage** (*rdzogs rim*): self-pacification
5. **Common Vehicle** (*theg pa thun mong ba*): antidote-based taming
6. **Mind Section** (*sems sde*): system placement
7. **Space Section** (*klong sde*): dharmatization
This doxographical arrangement maps the broader Tibetan Buddhist landscape while asserting Dzogchen's primacy.
[7456-7490] [CONCEPT] The Self-Liberation Paradox
**Analysis:** The philosophical argumentation proceeds through logical analysis (*gtan tshigs*):
**Impossibility of Abandonment** (*spong ba mi rigs pa*):
- If mind abandons afflictions: single substance (*rdzas gcig*) renders separation impossible
- If wisdom abandons: non-abiding together (*lhan cig mi gnas*) prevents mutual cognition
- Temporal analysis: past-future opposition prevents sequential abandonment
- Simultaneity leads to mutual mixing (*phan tshun 'chol ba*)
**The *rang grol* Resolution**:
- Recognition that afflictions arise from mind itself (*sems de nyid*)
- Like body and shadow: inseparable yet distinct
- No temporal interval for abandonment to occur
- Direct knowledge (*mngon sum rig*) transcends methodological accumulations
[7479-7490] [PHILOLOGY] *Nyi zla kha sbyor* Citation
**Analysis:** The citation from Sun-Moon Union (*Nyi zla kha sbyor*) demonstrates intertextual continuity within the Nyingma tradition. The simile of *lus dang grib ma* (body and shadow) illustrates simultaneity and inseparability of afflictions from mind's nature. The particle *ste* marks the citation as authoritative textual support.
