[4720-4733] [STRUCTURE] Three Eyes and Their Functions
**Analysis:** The section presents a detailed analysis of the three eyes (*spyan gsum*) and their respective empowerments (*byin rlabs*). The structure follows a triadic pattern:
1. Dharmakaya eye empowerment (4720-4721): Enables direct seeing of wisdom
2. Sambhogakaya eye empowerment (4721-4723): Enables self-clear seeing, expands knowledge
3. Nirmanakaya eye empowerment (4723-4725): Enables seeing free from sound-words, dawns dharmata meaning
Each section uses the construction "eye exists in X, by its empowerment sees Y, result Z"—creating a formal logical structure. The section concludes with definitional analysis (*nges tshig*) at 4732-4733.
[4720-4733] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Functions and Epistemic Markers
**Analysis:** The ablative *-las* in *'khor ba las grol* (4726, 4733) marks liberation-from, while the instrumental *-kyis* in *chos nyid kyi spyan* (4719) marks the eye as the agent of dharmata-seeing. The term *thag chod* (decided/resolved) at 4720 functions as an epistemic marker indicating certainty. The phrase *gsum du nges* (determined as three) at 4728, 4731 appears as a hermeneutical formula establishing the sufficiency of the triadic classification. The particle *ste* in *rtogs byed thams cad dag nas* (4725) marks the locus of purification: from all conceptual activity.
[4725-4727] [CONTEXT] Technical Integration of Gaze and Liberation
**Analysis:** The three gazes are presented as technical operations:
1. **Dharmata eye upward gaze** (*chos nyid kyi spyan gyen la bzlog*): Clears latencies (*bag chags*) downward—the "upward" indicates transcendent direction
2. **Wisdom eye equal-corner gaze** (*ye shes kyi zur la mnyam por bltas*): Equalizes samsara-nirvana taste (*'khor 'das ro mnyam*)
3. **Discriminating awareness eye lowered gaze** (*shes rab kyis phab nas bltas*): Brings down wisdom vision (*ye shes kyi snang ba*)
The voice at 4728-4731 is Longchenpa's synthetic commentary, providing psychological (*blo*) correlations for gaze selection: laziness (*le lo*) → Sambhogakaya, diligence (*brtson 'grus*) → Nirmanakaya, equanimity (*btang snyoms*) → Dharmakaya. This reflects *kusala-mula* (skillful root) typology from Abhidharma.
[4734-4748] [CONCEPT] Field-Pith: Outer and Inner Dimensions
**Analysis:** The section treats the second pith: field (*yul gyi gnad*). Two dimensions are established:
1. **Outer field** (4734-4740): Sky-space empty, separate from clouds (*sprin dang bral ba*)
2. **Inner field** (4735-4742): Between eyebrows (*smin mtshams*) at *mdzod spu* (treasure-hair/urna)
The inner field creates specific visionary experiences (*dbyings snang mthing ga*—blue dhatu-vision) and the five radiances (*'od lnga*). The text at 4743-4745 establishes the non-dual (*gnyis su med*) nature of awareness and experience (*rig pa dang nyams*), calling this "samsara-nirvana mixed" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*). This reflects the *advaya* (non-dual) position distinguishing Dzogchen from Madhyamaka's *advaita* (non-difference).
The prohibition at 4746-4748 against using coarse elements (*'byung bzhi'i dngos po*) as objects reflects the critique of *kasina* practices and similar concentration techniques in favor of "objectless" (*yul med*) meditation.

[4749-4767] [STRUCTURE] Sky-Gazing and Scriptural Citations
**Analysis:** The section develops the field-pith through the sky-gazing technique (*nam mkha'i lta ba*). The structure:
1. Technical description (4749-4752): Empty awareness placed on empty sky produces compatible experience
2. Scriptural citations (4752-4763):
- *Sems sde* (Mind Section): Yogin abides in sky's bird-path
- *Sdud pa* (Collection): Investigate meaning in sky
- *Yum bar ma* (Middle Mother): Prajnaparamita meditation is sky-yoga
3. Terminological analysis (4761-4763): Various names for this view
The transition at 4768 introduces the third pith: wind-awareness (*rlung rig gi gnad*).
[4749-4767] [PHILOLOGY] Comparative Particle Usage and Vision Terminology
**Analysis:** The comparative particle *dang mthun pa* (compatible with) at 4750 establishes the relationship between sky (*nam mkha'*) and experience (*nyams*). The term *mthun* appears frequently in this section, indicating correspondence rather than identity. The ablative *las* in *sems sde las* (4752) and other citations marks textual source. The term *snang ba* (vision/appearance) appears with multiple qualifiers: *dbyings snang* (dhatu-vision), *ye shes snang* (wisdom-vision), *nyams snang* (experiential vision)—distinguishing ontological levels of appearance. The phrase *ris med* (limitless/boundaryless) at 4761 indicates the non-discriminating nature of this view.
[4749-4788] [CONTEXT] Multiple View Classifications
**Analysis:** The text presents three equivalent formulations:
1. *Mnyam pa ris med kyi lta ba* (equal limitless view): Outer and inner fields mixed
2. *Dbyings rig gnyis med kyi lta ba* (dhatu-awareness non-dual view)
3. *'Khor 'das ro mnyam gyi lta ba* (samsara-nirvana taste-equal view)
These correspond to three levels of realization:
- Cosmological (*mnyam pa*): Equality of all phenomena
- Epistemological (*gnyis med*): Non-duality of knowing and field
- Soteriological (*ro mnyam*): Equal taste of cyclic and liberated states
The citation from *Bstan bu* (Instruction-Child) at 4764-4767 provides the lineage transmission (*brgyud pa*) authority.
[4768-4788] [CONCEPT] Wind-Awareness Pith: Mechanics and Functions
**Analysis:** The third pith (*rlung rig gi gnad*) operates through slowness (*dal ba*):
1. **External function** (4772): Life-extending helper (*tshe rgyas pa'i grogs*)
2. **Internal function** (4773): Cessation of conceptuality (*rnam par rtog pa nub pa*)
3. **Secret function** (4774): Direct seeing of awareness (*rig pa mngon sum du mthong ba*)
4. **Actual function** (4775): Buddha-making, contaminated non-seeing
The technical term *dal ba* (slow/easy) indicates both temporal slowness and "ease" or non-effort. The text at 4770 specifies the technique: wind shoots far outward (*phyir rgyang ring po 'phren*), held outward (*phyir bzung*), placed (*gzhag*)—creating a "pregnant pause" that interrupts ordinary breathing patterns.
The threefold repetition of the *Thal 'gyur* verse (4776-4788) emphasizes the severing of body-mind connection (*lus sems kyi 'brel chad*) as the central mechanism.

[4789-4801] [STRUCTURE] Awareness Pith and Practice Integration
**Analysis:** The section treats the awareness pith (*rig pa'i gnad*) using the *lu gu rgyud* (hanging-cord) metaphor. The structure:
1. Technical description (4789-4793): Awareness as hanging-cord in dhatu-fence
2. Scriptural citations (4790-4797):
- *De nyid las* (from That itself): Self-face awareness
- *Bstan bu* (Instruction-Child): Dhatu inside hanging-cord
3. Mechanism explanation (4798-4801): How slow wind produces meaning
4. Transition to direct introduction (4802-4811): Practical schedule and requirements
The section bridges technical description and practical application, a characteristic Dzogchen pedagogical move.
[4789-4801] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terms of Awareness Stabilization
**Analysis:** The term *lu gu rgyud* (hanging-cord) functions as a central metaphor. Etymologically: *lu* (water conduit), *gu* (that which curves), *rgyud* (continuum)—suggesting a curved connecting thread. The particle *la* in *dbYings kyi ra bar* (4792, 4796) marks location: the dhatu-fence (*ra ba*). The phrase *mi 'gul bar byed* (makes unmoving) at 4789 uses the causative *byed* with negative *mi*, indicating deliberate stabilization. The term *rang chod* (self-cut) at 4799 and 4815 appears in both verb and noun forms, indicating the auto-liberating quality of awareness.
[4790-4801] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Sources and Lineage
**Analysis:** The two scriptural citations establish lineage authority:
1. *Rang ngo rig pa* (Self-face awareness): Likely from the *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arising Awareness), a key *sems sde* (Mind Section) text
2. *Bstan bu* (Instruction-Child): A lineage text attributed to Garab Dorje or early Nyingma masters
The explanation at 4798-4801 presents the mechanism: slow wind (*rlung dal ba*) produces action-separation (*bya dang bral ba*), meaning arises in mind (*don rgyud la skye*). This reflects the *prana-citta* (wind-mind) correlation central to Tibetan Buddhist physiology.
[4802-4811] [CONCEPT] Practice Schedule and Epistemic Prerequisites
**Analysis:** The text presents a graduated practice schedule:
1. **First** (*dang po*): 5-6 days relying on body-pith (*lus kyi gnad*)
2. **Then** (*de nas*): Practice gate (*sgo*) only that much
3. **Then** (*de nas*): Seek field (*yul*), 6-7 days
4. **Then** (*de nas*): Deliver to direct self-point (*mngon sum rang thog tu phab*), take experience
The epistemic requirements at 4808-4811 distinguish three levels:
- Preliminary (*sngon 'gro*): Arriving at measure with diligence
- Actual (*dngos gzhi*): Uncommon faith arises
- Result (*'bras bu*): Special joy in direct perception
- Post-support (*rjes rgyab*): Knowing how to maintain practice, cutting doubt
The warning at 4807-4808 against "this or that" (*'al ma 'ol*) practice reflects the critique of eclecticism (*khu tshur*) in favor of single-pointed practice.
<Generated from Tibetan page: /home/oracle/extinction-event/EV/theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod/1/volume_2/tibetan/PAGE 109.txt>
[4812-4830] [STRUCTURE] Direct Introduction to Awareness Nature
**Analysis:** The section presents the second major topic (*don gnyis pa*): direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) to awareness' own face (*rig pa'i rang ngo*). The structure follows the "pointing-out" (*ngo sprod*) genre:
1. Technical description (4813-4815): Awareness as vajra hanging-cord with clear light
2. Direct introduction formula (4820): "Thus pointing out"
3. Scriptural citations (4821-4830):
- *Rang byung bstan pa'i bka'*: Equal capacity with first Samantabhadra
- *Thal 'gyur*: Hanging-cord nature as base-buddha
The phrase *ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum* (essence, nature, compassion three) at 4856 (in next page) indicates the section prepares for this triadic analysis.
[4812-4830] [PHILOLOGY] Metaphorical Language and Ontological Claims
**Analysis:** The extended metaphor at 4813 uses multiple images:
- *Rdo rje'i lu gu rgyud* (vajra hanging-cord)
- *Gser gyi skud pa* (golden thread)
- *Nam mkha' la lding ba* (sky-hovering)
These metaphors establish awareness as:
1. Indestructible (*rdo rje*)
2. Precious/connective (*gser gyi skud pa*)
3. Unbounded (*nam mkha'*)
The term *kadag* (*ka dag*) at 4814, 4828 appears as *ka dag* (primordial purity), distinct from *dag* (merely purified). The phrase *sgyu ma'i skur grol* (liberated into illusory body) at 4824 uses the standard Dzogchen formulation that recognizes the body as illusory without denying its appearance.
[4816-4830] [CONTEXT] Soteriological Outcomes and Lineage
**Analysis:** Three soteriological outcomes are presented at 4816-4819:
1. **Complete habituation** (*goms pa tshad du phyin na*): Liberation with stones into light (*rdos bcas 'od du 'grol*)
2. **Incomplete habituation** (*ma phyin*): Traverse bardo (*bar do*) or nature-emanation field (*rang bzhin sprul pa'i zhing*)
3. **General result** (*'gro drug*): Cut delusion precipice of six realms
The lineage citations at 4821-4830 establish:
- *Rang byung bstan pa* (Self-Arising Instruction): Garab Dorje lineage
- *Thal 'gyur*: Atiyoga source text
The term *kun tu bzang po* (Samantabhadra) at 4816, 4823 refers to the primordial Buddha, establishing the practitioner as originally enlightened (*gdod ma'i sangs rgyas*).
[4831-4845] [CONCEPT] Vision Mechanics and Dhatu-Awareness Integration
**Analysis:** The section introduces the four visions (*snang ba bzhi*) at 4845:
1. *dByings 'od lnga'i rang gdangs* (five light dhatu self-resonance)
2. *Lu gu rgyud la thig le phra mos 'brel ba* (hanging-cord bound by tiny spheres)
3. *Dkar zang zing* (white-pure) star-scatter appearance
4. *Thig le kha dog lnga ldan* (five-colored spheres)
The technical description at 4841-4844 presents the mechanism: looking at outer luminous-clear (*phyi 'od gsal*) separates inner conceptuality (*nang rnam rtog*), liberating into equal-limitless. This establishes the *ka dag* (primordial purity) awareness-resonance and *lhun grub* (spontaneous completion) light-resonance as outer-inner pair-connected (*phyi nang zung du 'brel*). The term *'dres pa* (mixed) at 4844 indicates non-dual integration, not merely juxtaposition.

[4845-4857] [STRUCTURE] Four Visions Framework
**Analysis:** The section presents the *don gsum pa* (third topic): the sequence of four visions (*snang ba bzhi 'char ba'i rim pa*). The structure:
1. Brief indication of essence (*ngo bo mdor bstan pa*) at 4846
2. Extensive explanation of nature (*rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa*) at 4847
3. Technical requirements (4848-4853): Posture, gaze, and wind-awareness mode
4. Definition of awareness as vajra hanging-cord (4854-4857)
This mirrors the classical *prakriti* (essence) and *prabhava* (nature) distinction from Abhidharma, applied to visionary experience.
[4845-4877] [PHILOLOGY] Vision Terminology and Numerical Determination
**Analysis:** The term *rim pa* (sequence/order) at 4845 indicates progressive stages. The phrase *ngang gis 'byongs nas* (naturally purified) at 4852 uses *ngang* (mode/state) to indicate effortless process. The numerological analysis at 4877-4881 presents four-fold determinations (*nges pa*):
- **External**: Moon waxing-waning (*zla ba 'phel zad*), four seasons
- **Internal**: Four body-speech-mind-binds (*lus ngag yid sems bzhi*)
- **Secret**: Four empowerments (*dbang bzhi*)
- **Actual**: Four lamp visions (*sgrom ma bzhi*)
This four-fold analysis reflects the *caturmukha* (four-faced) hermeneutics of Buddhist tantra.
[4848-4857] [CONTEXT] Integration of Practice Elements
**Analysis:** The text at 4848-4853 integrates all previously discussed elements:
- Body in posture (*lus bzhugs stangs*)
- Eye in gaze manner (*mig gzigs stangs*)
- Wind-awareness in slow mode (*rlung rig ngang gis dal ba*)
The requirement that "not relying on effort, mode naturally purifies" (*rtsol ba la ma ltos par ngang gis 'byongs*) distinguishes Dzogchen from *tsa-lung* (channel-wind) practices requiring deliberate manipulation. The definition of awareness at 4855-4857 uses the *ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje* (essence-nature-compassion) triad from *Zab chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol* (Karma Lingpa's revelation).
[4858-4890] [CONCEPT] Vajra Hanging-Cord: Detailed Analysis
**Analysis:** The section provides an etymological (*nges tshig*) analysis of *rdo rje lu gu rgyud*:
1. **Lu** (4858-4859): Like a good water conduit (*chu'i lu*), increases-decreases without manifesting—body and wisdom's increase-opening (*'phel sgo*), path-vision not complete until manifestation (*lam snang*)
2. **Gu** (4860): Within that, dharmata and non-mistaken view-practice are drawn in (*'gugs par byed*)
3. **Rgyud** (4861-4865): Pervading samsara-nirvana, clarifies:
- Body (*sku*)
- Thig le radiating (*'phro ba*)
- Dawning (*mched pa*)
- Gathering (*'du ba*)
The verse citation from *Thal 'gyur* (4866-4877) presents the four visions as liberating:
- Dharmata direct vision: Subdues intellect-held views
- Experience increasing: Causes delusion vision to cease
- Awareness measure-arriving: Surpasses body-three realization path
- Dharmata exhausting: Cuts three realms' samsara continuum
The sequence (*go rims*) analysis at 4882-4889 establishes logical necessity: first vision provides basis (*rten*), without which others lack foundation (*gzhi*).

[4891-4905] [STRUCTURE] Vision Completion and Soteriological Results
**Analysis:** The section presents the completion dynamics of the four visions and their soteriological results. The structure:
1. Third vision dynamics (4891-4894): Awareness arriving at measure
2. Fourth vision (4894-4896): Dharmata exhausting
3. Integration with three bodies (4897-4902): Mapping visions to kayas
4. Unique fruition formulation (4902-4905): Vehicle-king's intent
The term *thug pa* (arriving at/concluding) at 4899 indicates the terminus of the path, distinguishing Dzogchen's "path of exhaustion" (*zad lam*) from gradualist paths.
[4891-4905] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Functions in Vision Dynamics
**Analysis:** The particle *yang* in *de dag kyang* (4897) marks continuation from previous discussion. The locative *la* in *lam du byas pa* (4899) indicates instrumental usage: made into path. The term *thim pa* (dissolution) at 4894, 4900 appears with both transitive and intransitive senses—vision dissolves into base, potency dissolves into awareness mode. The phrase *theg pa gzhan nas* (from other vehicles) at 4903 uses ablative *nas* to mark exclusion: this essence not even heard of (*ming yang mi grag*) in other vehicles.
[4891-4905] [CONTEXT] Kaya-Vision Correspondences
**Analysis:** The text establishes the classical Nyingma correspondence:
| Vision | Kaya | Characteristic |
|--------|------|----------------|
| First two (*dang po gnyis*) | Nirmanakaya | Preliminary manifestation |
| Measure-arriving (*tshad phebs*) | Sambhogakaya | Stable clarity |
| Exhausting (*zad pa*) | Dharmakaya | Complete liberation |
This differs from Sarma presentations where the four visions typically map to four kayas (including *svabhavikakaya*). The voice at 4902-4905 is Longchenpa's authoritative summary: this is the *snying po* (essence) and *theg pa rgyal po* (vehicle-king's) intent, using royal metaphor for Dzogchen's supremacy.
[4906-4931] [CONCEPT] Direct Perception: Conventional and Ultimate
**Analysis:** The section transitions to the second subtopic (*gnys pa*): individual natures. The analysis of *mngon sum* (direct perception) at 4914-4931 presents four types:
1. **Sense-power direct** (*dbang po'i mngon sum*): Forms, etc., five objects
2. **Mind direct** (*yid kyi mngon sum*): Object near enjoyment, certain cause
3. **Self-awareness direct** (*rang rig pa'i mngon sum*): Within pleasure, pain, etc.
4. **Yogin's direct** (*rnal 'byor gyi mngon sum*): Particular correct awareness, grasp-hold separate
The Yogin's direct is distinguished from the others by its object (*yul*): entry into *de kho na nyid* (thusness/thatness). This reflects the *yogipratyaksa* (yogi perception) concept from *Pramana* (epistemology) traditions, particularly Dharmakirti's *Pramanavarttika*.
The citation from *Rnam 'grel* (Pramanavarttika) at 4920-4925 establishes epistemic authority for direct perception, with Longchenpa's commentary adapting pramana theory to Dzogchen realization.

[4926-4953] [STRUCTURE] Dharmata Direct Perception Analysis
**Analysis:** The section continues the analysis of dharmata direct perception (*chos nyid mngon sum*), presenting:
1. Ontological location (4926-4928): Awareness' essence in heart
2. Epistemic certainty (4928-4931): Yogic versus worldly perception
3. Technical definition (4932-4953): Terminological analysis of *chos nyid*
The structure follows *abhidharma* methodology: establishing the locus (*gnas*), then the distinguishing characteristics (*mtshan nyid*). The phrase *nges tshig* (definitive word) at 4932 marks the transition to etymological analysis.
[4926-4953] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological Distinctions
**Analysis:** The term *chos nyid* (dharmata) is analyzed through four semantic fields:
1. **Samsara-nirvana distinction** (4934-4935): Samsara = *chos* (phenomena); Nirvana = *chos nyid* (dharmata)
2. **Appearance-emptiness distinction** (4936-4937): Appearance = *chos*; Emptiness = *chos nyid*
3. **Bondage-liberation distinction** (4938-4939): Without pith = *chos*; With pith, certain liberation = *chos nyid*
4. **Dhatu-awareness distinction** (4940-4941): Dhatu = *chos*; Awareness = *chos nyid*
The final definition (4941) presents the Nyingma non-dual position: both considered non-different (*dbyer med*). The term *mngon sum* (direct) at 4942 is defined as "directly visible to sense-power object" (*dbang po'i spyod yul la dngos su bltar yod*), distinguishing yogic direct perception from ordinary perception.
[4926-4953] [CONTEXT] Pramana Theory and Dzogchen Adaptation
**Analysis:** The section engages with *Pramana* (epistemology) tradition:
- Distinction between worldly (*'jig rten pa*) and supramundane (*'das pa*) direct perception (4928)
- Dharmakirti's influence evident in the fourfold direct perception typology
- Longchenpa's adaptation: "This is called awareness direct" (*'di rig pa'i mngon sum zhes bya*)
The critique of intellect-searching (*yid dpyod*) at 4943-4946 reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition over inferential cognition (*rjes dpag*). The citation from *Sdud pa* (Dharmakirti's *Sambandhapariksa* or similar) at 4947-4949 establishes that discriminating awareness cannot find the aggregates' depth, supporting the "objectless" meditation approach.
[4950-4953] [CONCEPT] Luminous Appearance and Formlessness
**Analysis:** The section presents the ontological status of luminous-clear appearance (*'od gsal gyi snang ba*):
- Not conventionally famous form-possessing (*th snyad la grags pa'i gzugs can min*)
- Neither subtle particle (*phra ba rdul phran*) nor coarse particular (*rags pa dngos po rang mtshan*)
- Indestructible by four elements (*'byung bzhi'i gnod pas gzhig cing gzhom du mi rung*)
The form-possessing (*gzugs can*) at 4952 is defined as "possessing the characteristic of form" (*gzugs kyi mtshan nyid de*), i.e., destructible. This establishes luminous appearance as *nimitta* (markless) in the sense of lacking defining characteristics (*mtshan nyid*), while still being perceptible.

[4954-4983] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Enumeration of "Three"
**Analysis:** The section presents a complex numerological analysis establishing why "three" is the determinate number for direct perception. The structure:
1. Outer: Three piths establish base (*gzhis gsum gyis gzhis bchas pa*)
2. Inner: Three paths clear obstacles (*lam gsum gyis geegs bsal ba*)
3. Secret: Three measures deliver to measure (*tshad gsum gyis tshad la phab pa*)
4. Result: Three fruits deliver to exhaustion point (*'bras bu gsum gyis zad sar bskyal ba*)
Each level uses *gsum* (three) with different referents, creating a hermeneutical spiral that reinforces the triadic structure.
[4954-4971] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative Logic and Negative Determination
**Analysis:** The section uses *rtags* (sign/reason) logic to establish determinations:
- Base: Three piths → no difference in entity (*dngos po la tha dad med pa*)
- Path: Three paths → no near-far in going path (*'gro lam la nye ring med pa*)
- Measure: Three measures → no similar-different-random (*'dra min dang chal chol med pa*)
- Result: Three fruits → no yes-no-doubt (*yin min dang the tshom med pa*)
The negative determinations (*med pa*) establish the *apophatic* (via negativa) character of Dzogchen realization. The term *gsum tshig* (three group) at 4963 indicates the grammatical structure: three items grouped as four determinations.
[4954-4983] [CONTEXT] Integration of Practice and Result
**Analysis:** The text presents the correspondence between ordinary and yogic experience:
| Ordinary | Yogic |
|----------|-------|
| Pleasant (*dga'*) | Dharmata direct (*chos nyid mngon sum*) |
| Unpleasant (*mi dga'*) | Awareness measure-arriving (*rig pa tshad phebs*) |
| Equanimity (*btang snyoms*) | Dharmata exhausting (*chos nyid zad pa*) |
The threefold structure appears in:
- Guru's instruction: Dhatu, awareness, dharmas (*dbyings rig chos gsum*)
- Dharmata direct: Pith without intellect-word addition
- Habituation: Three bodies' light-point, self-ceasing delusion
- Measure-arriving: Clear-empty-pleasure (*gsal stong bde gsum*)
The definition of vision at 4979-4981 uses threefold structure:
- Whatever dawns, dharmata dawns
- Whatever field, dhatu dawns
- Whatever manner, light-light-house-awareness hanging-cord dawns
[4974-4983] [CONCEPT] Dharmata Self-Exhaustion
**Analysis:** The section presents the *chos nyid zad pa* (dharmata exhausting) as the culmination:
1. Pith without intellect-word addition (*yid dpyod tshig gi sgro 'dogs su med pa*)
2. Habituation: Three bodies' light-point, delusion self-ceases
3. Measure-arriving: Direct seeing of clear-empty-pleasure three
4. Result: Dharmata self-exhausts (*chos nyid rang zad pa*)
The phrase *gsum zhes grangs kyi gnas gzhan la brten nas* (4978) indicates that "three" is a conventional enumeration relying on other bases, but the fruit liberates simultaneously (*cig car*). This reflects the *ekaksana* (one-instant) liberation teaching of the *Prajnaparamita*.

[4984-5011] [STRUCTURE] Essence, Definition, and Purpose
**Analysis:** The section presents the classical *mtshan nyid* (definition) structure for dharmata direct perception:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*) at 4984-4991: Unborn direct, object-pure vision
2. Definition (*nges tshig*) at 4992-4997: Seeing three bodies' vision, arriving at field-realm
3. Purpose (*dgos pa*) at 4998-5002: Liberation without obstacle
4. Pith (*gnad*) at 5003-5011: Scripture citations for practice
This mirrors the *laksana* (characteristic), *vyakti* (definition), and *prayojana* (purpose) structure from Indian philosophical texts.
[4984-5011] [PHILOLOGY] Scriptural Citations and Technical Definitions
**Analysis:** Multiple scriptural sources are cited:
- *Yi ge med pa* (Letterless): Unborn direct, object-pure (4984-4987)
- *Sgyu 'phrul* (Maya): Jewel, desire, glory—all buddhas' direct (4988-4991)
- *Rin po che rnam par brtsegs pa'i rgyud* (Ratnakuta): Direct = seeing; three = three bodies (4993-4997)
- *Thal 'gyur*: Rope without movement is pith (5003-5006)
- *Yi ge med pa*: Eye pressed, eye-corner dhatu arises (5007-5011)
The definition at 4992 uses *mtshan nyid* (definition) in the technical sense: seeing three bodies' vision (*sku gsum gyi snang ba mthong ba*). The term *rgyang zhags* (rope/snare) at 5004 appears in Dzogchen as a metaphor for immovable awareness.
[4984-5037] [CONTEXT] Multiple Tantric Sources
**Analysis:** The section integrates sources from various classes:
- *Atiyoga* (*Yi ge med pa*, *Thal 'gyur*): Highest yoga
- *Yoga tantra* (*Sgyu 'phrul drva ba*): Illusion Net
- *Sutra* (*Rin po che brtsegs pa*): Ratnakuta collection
This reflects Longchenpa's encyclopedic approach, integrating sources across the *nine vehicles* (*theg pa dgu*). The voice alternates between citation and commentary, with *zhes so* marking quotations and *zhes bya* marking definitional statements.
[5012-5037] [CONCEPT] Vision Characteristics and Practice Methods
**Analysis:** The section presents the characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) of dharmata direct perception vision:
1. From *Thal 'gyur* (5013-5017):
- Exits certainly from sense-power gate
- Clear in cloudless sky
2. From other sources (5018-5033):
- Channels and delusion-mandala: Five wisdoms seen as bubbles
- *Rang shar*: Five wisdoms, light body, clear in hanging-cord
- *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs*: Self-vision rigpa entity abides as wisdom hanging-cord
- *Nor bu 'phra bkod*: Perfect buddha rigpa lu gu rgyud body fully clear
The practice method at 5034-5037 presents a graduated approach:
1. First: Short sessions, many repetitions
2. Second: Extend sessions, prolong duration
3. Third: Day-night without distinction, placed in dhatu-fence, unmoving
This mirrors the standard *bsgom rim* (meditation stages) but adapted to Dzogchen's direct approach.

[5038-5062] [STRUCTURE] Result and Liberation Dynamics
**Analysis:** The section presents the result (*'bras bu*) of dharmata direct perception practice. The structure:
1. Citation from *Sgron ma 'bar ba* (5038-5042): Dhatu makes awareness's field; vajra is hanging-cord
2. Detailed result description (5043-5062): Multi-level dissolution process
3. Concluding citation from *Thal 'gyur* (5050-5062): Direct seeing-knowing-realizing-liberating
The phrase *rang bzhin gyis gnas* (5048) indicates natural abiding, the *prakrti-stha* concept of innate liberation.
[5038-5062] [PHILOLOGY] Dissolution Terminology and Liberation Mechanics
**Analysis:** The result description uses a cascade of dissolutions:
- Outer dhatu-vision, eye unmoving → inner awareness abides in base (*gzhis*)
- Resonance self-dissolves from self → circle separates (*'khor nas*)
- Lung wind horse separates (*bral ba*)
- Wisdom sky dissolves into dhatu sky
- Equal limitless liberation
The term *thim* (dissolve) appears multiple times (5045, 5047, 5057), marking the progressive deepening of realization. The negative determinations at 5055-5058 establish the *apophatic* nature of liberation: not untying (*bkrol ba ma yin*), nature aimless (*rang bzhin dmigs med*), partless (*cha shas med*).
[5038-5062] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Authority and Terminological Integration
**Analysis:** The citation from *Sgron ma 'bar ba* (Blazing Lamp) at 5038-5042 establishes the technical terms:
- Dhatu (*dbyings*): Makes awareness's self-field (*rang yul*)
- Vajra (*rdo rje*): Is hanging-cord (*lu gu rgyud*)
- Placement (*gzhag pa*): Inside this (*'di nang du*)
The *Thal 'gyur* citation at 5050-5062 presents the progressive epistemic structure:
- Seeing (*mthong ba*) → Knowing (*shes pa*) → Realizing (*rtogs pa*) → Liberation (*grol ba*)
This reflects the *pratyaksa-parijna* (direct perception-complete knowledge) to *vimukti* (liberation) progression in Buddhist soteriology.
[5063-5079] [CONCEPT] Increasing Experience Vision
**Analysis:** The section transitions to the second vision (*snang ba gnyis pa*): experience increasing above (*nyams gong 'phel*). The structure:
1. Brief indication (5065-5068): Purifying dhatu-awareness above-above
2. Extensive explanation (5069-5079): Two types of experience
The experience analysis distinguishes:
- **Knowing experience** (*shes nyams*): Worldly, from concentration (*ting nge 'dzin*), pleasure-bliss-mind-attachment, singing-dancing
- **Vision experience** (*snang nyams*): To be discussed subsequently
The term *gong nas gong* (above from above) at 5065 indicates progressive intensification. The *Thal 'gyur* citation at 5069-5075 presents the characteristics:
- Wisdom color emerges outward
- Up-standing (*gyen 'greng*) and wing-dawning (*rtsibs shar*)
- Various thig-le in body itself
- Clear in coarse vision field
This establishes the second vision as intensification of the first, not qualitatively different in essence but quantitatively greater in manifestation.
[STRUCTURE] This page initiates analysis of the "transcend knowing experience" ('das pa'i shes nyams), a technical term indicating meditative experiences beyond conceptual cognition. The passage establishes a threefold typology: (1) knowing pleasure happiness experience (shes pa dga' bde'i nyams), (2) end change experience (mthar 'gyur gyi nyams), and (3) vision experience (snang ba'i nyams). Structural markers include "first is" (dang po ni) introducing the initial category, followed by "fabricated meditation" (bcos ma'i bsgoms pa) as dialectical counterpoint, concluding with comparative analysis using "difference" (khyad) terminology.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5080]: 'das pa (past participle of 'da' ba, to transcend/pass beyond) + shes (knowing) + nyams (experience) = "transcend knowing experience," indicating supra-cognitive meditative states. stong gsal mtha' bral (empty clear extreme separate): classic Dzogchen triad describing realization beyond extremes. rtogs tshad (realization measure): technical term for diagnostic criteria of authentic recognition.
Line [5086-5087]: gnad du gcun pa (bound at the main point): technical physical yoga term for body/speech binding techniques. bag la zha nas (from latency relaxing): bag la nyal (latency) + zha ba (to relax), describing the settling of wind-mind (rlung sems).
Line [5088]: bag yangs (spacious/open): term for non-dual spaciousness. gzung 'dzin (grasping and holding): shorthand for subject-object duality. khrol chags su skyes (arisen as spread-desire): technical term for bliss-expansion in Dzogchen physiology.
Line [5089]: bcos ma (fabricated/artificial): key dialectical term contrasting with rang bzhin (natural). 'khrab pa (throbbing): coarse somatic experience indicating non-authentic meditation.
[CONTEXT] This passage operates within Result Vehicle (Dzogchen) framework, specifically the Tögal (thod rgal) visionary path. The three experiences correspond to classical Dzogchen taxonomy from tantras such as the Kun byed rgyal po and commentarial traditions of the Vima snying thig and Mkha' 'gro snying thig. The "eight" (brgyad) mentioned line [5100] refers to the eight major visionary signs (sna tshogs snang ba) preceding full awakening, distinct from the "four visions" (snang ba bzhi) schema. The distinction between bcos ma (fabricated) and rang bzhin (natural) meditation reflects the Nyingma critique of contrived practice versus spontaneous self-liberation (rang grol).
[CONCEPT]
• Three experiences typology:
- Knowing bliss experience: non-dual spaciousness (bag yangs), natural samadhi (rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan)
- End-change experience: visionary instability, wind-based phenomena (rlung g.yo ba), eight signs
- Vision experience: awareness self-resonance (rig pa'i rang gdangs), spontaneous completion (lhun grub)
• Key dialectical distinctions:
- Fabricated vs. natural meditation (bcos ma vs. rang bzhin)
- Coarse throb vs. subtle bliss ('khrab pa vs. khrol chags)
- Grasping vs. non-grasping (zhen 'dzin vs. zhen med)
• Physiological correlations:
- Body/speech binding (lus ngag gnad du gcun pa) → wind-mind settling
- Inner samadhi (nang ting nge 'dzin) → luminous-emptiness pervasion
- Self-resonance dissolution (rang gdangs thim pa) → pure spontaneous domain
