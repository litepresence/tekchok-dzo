[STRUCTURE] This page initiates analysis of the "transcend knowing experience" ('das pa'i shes nyams), a technical term indicating meditative experiences beyond conceptual cognition. The passage establishes a threefold typology: (1) knowing pleasure happiness experience (shes pa dga' bde'i nyams), (2) end change experience (mthar 'gyur gyi nyams), and (3) vision experience (snang ba'i nyams). Structural markers include "first is" (dang po ni) introducing the initial category, followed by "fabricated meditation" (bcos ma'i bsgoms pa) as dialectical counterpoint, concluding with comparative analysis using "difference" (khyad) terminology.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5080]: 'das pa (past participle of 'da' ba, to transcend/pass beyond) + shes (knowing) + nyams (experience) = "transcend knowing experience," indicating supra-cognitive meditative states. stong gsal mtha' bral (empty clear extreme separate): classic Dzogchen triad describing realization beyond extremes. rtogs tshad (realization measure): technical term for diagnostic criteria of authentic recognition.
Line [5086-5087]: gnad du gcun pa (bound at the main point): technical physical yoga term for body/speech binding techniques. bag la zha nas (from latency relaxing): bag la nyal (latency) + zha ba (to relax), describing the settling of wind-mind (rlung sems).
Line [5088]: bag yangs (spacious/open): term for non-dual spaciousness. gzung 'dzin (grasping and holding): shorthand for subject-object duality. khrol chags su skyes (arisen as spread-desire): technical term for bliss-expansion in Dzogchen physiology.
Line [5089]: bcos ma (fabricated/artificial): key dialectical term contrasting with rang bzhin (natural). 'khrab pa (throbbing): coarse somatic experience indicating non-authentic meditation.
[CONTEXT] This passage operates within Result Vehicle (Dzogchen) framework, specifically the Tögal (thod rgal) visionary path. The three experiences correspond to classical Dzogchen taxonomy from tantras such as the Kun byed rgyal po and commentarial traditions of the Vima snying thig and Mkha' 'gro snying thig. The "eight" (brgyad) mentioned line [5100] refers to the eight major visionary signs (sna tshogs snang ba) preceding full awakening, distinct from the "four visions" (snang ba bzhi) schema. The distinction between bcos ma (fabricated) and rang bzhin (natural) meditation reflects the Nyingma critique of contrived practice versus spontaneous self-liberation (rang grol).
[CONCEPT]
• Three experiences typology:
- Knowing bliss experience: non-dual spaciousness (bag yangs), natural samadhi (rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan)
- End-change experience: visionary instability, wind-based phenomena (rlung g.yo ba), eight signs
- Vision experience: awareness self-resonance (rig pa'i rang gdangs), spontaneous completion (lhun grub)
• Key dialectical distinctions:
- Fabricated vs. natural meditation (bcos ma vs. rang bzhin)
- Coarse throb vs. subtle bliss ('khrab pa vs. khrol chags)
- Grasping vs. non-grasping (zhen 'dzin vs. zhen med)
• Physiological correlations:
- Body/speech binding (lus ngag gnad du gcun pa) → wind-mind settling
- Inner samadhi (nang ting nge 'dzin) → luminous-emptiness pervasion
- Self-resonance dissolution (rang gdangs thim pa) → pure spontaneous domain
[STRUCTURE] This page extends the three-experience typology with detailed phenomenological analysis. The structural progression moves from distinguishing authentic vs. fabricated meditation [5092-5101] to cataloging eight visionary signs of the "end-change experience" [5102-5124], concluding with their diagnostic significance [5125-5130]. The passage employs enumerative logic (eight like-similes) and causal explanations (cause is.../phyir ro).
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5092]: rlung nyams (wind experience): technical term for energetic/visionary instability in subtle body practice. snang cha (vision part/aspect): indicates these are components of larger visionary taxonomy.
Lines [5093-5100]: Eight similes for visionary progression: firefly (srin bu me khyer), cloud (sprin), smoke (du ba), haze (smug zil), moon-dawn (zla ba shar ba), star-dawn (skar ma shar ba), sky-brightening (nam sros pa), sun-dawn (nyi ma shar ba). These follow classical Tögal visionary sequence from dim to clear appearances.
Line [5102]: mi brtan (not firm) + tshugs mi thub (cannot stand): diagnostic language for unstable visionary states requiring purification. 'gyur 'gro (change-go): continuous transformation indicating wind-agitation.
Line [5105-5111]: rig pa'i rang gdangs (awareness self-resonance): key Dzogchen term for natural luminosity not dependent on conditions. 'od gsal chen po (great luminous-clear): refers to dharmakāya luminosity. gnas skabs (occasion/state): technical term for practice stage.
[CONTEXT] The eight visionary signs catalogued here derive from the Thod rgal bar do'i ngo sprod and similar visionary tantras of the Atiyoga class. The progression from firefly to sun-dawn represents the standard four-stage schema of Tögal vision: (1) dharmatā (chos nyid snang ba), (2) increased experience (nyams gong 'phel), (3) awareness reaching full measure (rig pa tshad phebs), and (4) exhaustion of phenomena (chos zad). The physiological basis in wind (rlung) purification reflects the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim) physiology of the subtle body (lus).
[CONCEPT]
• Eight visionary signs taxonomy:
- Firefly: initial flickering awareness
- Cloud: diffused luminosity
- Smoke: obscured clarity
- Haze: dim manifestation
- Moon-dawn: increasing clarity
- Star-dawn: multiple points of light
- Sky-brightening: expansive blue vision
- Sun-dawn: unobstructed inner-outer clarity
• Diagnostic criteria:
- Arising-ceasing ('char nub): impermanence marking wind-based phenomena
- Clear-dim (gsal 'grib): variability indicating instability
- Requires wind-mind purification (rlung sems dag dgos)
• Vision experience as chief (gtso bo):
- Self-resonance returns to base (rang gdangs gzhi thim)
- Reverses to inner (nang du bzlog pa)
- Dissolves into spontaneous-completion pure dhatu (lhun grub ka dag gi dbyings)
[STRUCTURE] This page continues the phenomenology of vision experience (snang ba'i nyams), shifting from general characteristics to specific manifestations. The passage employs spatial metaphors (palace, expanse, mansion) and technical terminology for the "four visions" (snang ba bzhi) schema. Structural markers include demonstrative deictics (de, des na) linking visionary phenomena to their ground.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5112-5115]: ye bzhugs (original abiding): technical term for primordial non-constructed presence. lhun grub chen po (great spontaneous completion): highest classification of manifestation. 'pho 'gyur med pa (not-existing change): immutability of awareness-display.
Line [5116-5120]: snang ba bzhi (four visions): core Tögal taxonomy—(1) chos nyid snang ba (dharmatā vision), (2) nyams gong 'phel (increasing experience), (3) rig pa tshad phebs (awareness reaching full measure), (4) chos zad pa (exhaustion of phenomena). thod rgal (direct transcendence): the path using these visions.
Line [5121-5125]: 'ja' lus (rainbow body): manifestation of realization as light-form. sku gsum (three kāyas): dharmakāya (chos sku), sambhogakāya (longs sku), nirmāṇakāya (sprul sku). rig 'dzin (vidyādhara): awareness-holder, five types enumerated.
[CONTEXT] This material situates within the "four visions" (snang ba bzhi) framework of the Tögal path, the result vehicle (Dzogchen) completion practice. The technical terms derive from the Bla ma yang thig, Mthong ba don ldan, and other seminal Dzogchen tantras. The passage represents Longchenpa's systematic presentation of the stageless stages—though Dzogchen transcends gradualism, the four visions provide a descriptive framework for recognition. The "original abiding" (ye bzhugs) terminology distinguishes this from constructed meditation states (bcos ma).
[CONCEPT]
• Four visions taxonomy:
- Dharmatā vision (chos nyid snang ba): direct manifestation of nature-of-things
- Increasing experience (nyams gong 'phel): visions multiply and intensify
- Awareness reaching full measure (rig pa tshad phebs): complete recognition
- Exhaustion of phenomena (chos zad pa): phenomena liberated into their ground
• Spatial metaphors:
- Self-light expanse (rang 'od kyi klong): dimension of natural luminosity
- Wisdom palace (ye shes kyi pho brang): residence of primordial knowing
- Great spontaneous completion (lhun grub chen po): uncontrived perfection
• Teleology:
- Three kāyas actualization through vision practice
- Five vidyādhara attainments
- Rainbow body ('ja' lus) as somatic marker of realization
[STRUCTURE] This page transitions from the four-visions framework to concrete visionary phenomena and their interpretation. The passage employs analogical reasoning (like.../lta bu) and causal analysis (las/byung). Structural elements include quotative markers (zhes bya ste) defining technical terms, and comparative analysis distinguishing ordinary vs. awakened perception.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5126-5130]: nang snang (inner vision): subjective meditative appearance distinguished from outer objects. phyir snang (outer vision): objective manifestation. 'phel zhing tshad la phebs (increasing to measure arriving): technical description of vision maturation.
Line [5131-5135]: rgyan drug (six ornaments): decorative visionary phenomena—sgra (sound), 'od (light), thig le (spheres), sku (bodies), yid 'ong (attractive), grol (liberation). chos sku'i rgyan (dharmakāya ornaments): ultimate nature appearances.
Line [5136-5140]: zung 'jug (union): integration of appearance-emptiness, bliss-emptiness, awareness-emptiness. gzhi (ground/basis): primordial state preceding samsara-nirvana bifurcation. gdangs (resonance/radiance): self-display of awareness without external cause.
[CONTEXT] The six ornaments (rgyan drug) derive from tantric classification systems, particularly the Guhyagarbha and Māyājāla cycles, adapted for Dzogchen presentation. The distinction between inner and outer vision (nang phyir snang) reflects epistemological debates in Tibetan Buddhism about the status of meditative experiences—are they purely subjective (nang) or do they possess objective ontological status (phyir)? Longchenpa's position affirms the non-dual nature of these appearances as self-display (rang snang) of awareness, neither purely inner nor outer.
[CONCEPT]
• Six ornaments phenomenology:
- Sounds: dharmatā resonance (chos nyid kyi sgra)
- Lights: five-colored radiance (lnga ldan gyi 'od)
- Spheres (thig le): concentrated luminosity
- Bodies (sku): manifestation of three kāyas
- Attractive (yid 'ong): naturally pleasing without attachment
- Liberation (grol): self-liberated upon arising
• Threefold union (zung 'jug):
- Appearance-emptiness union (snang stong zung 'jug)
- Bliss-emptiness union (bde stong zung 'jug)
- Awareness-emptiness union (rig stong zung 'jug)
• Vision maturation stages:
- Increasing ('phel): quantitative multiplication
- Arriving at measure (tshad phebs): qualitative fullness
- Self-liberation (rang grol): automatic purification
[STRUCTURE] This page presents the four visions through detailed phenomenological description, employing structural markers "first...second...third...fourth" (dang po...gnyis pa...gsum pa...bzhi pa). The passage alternates between technical definitions and metaphorical illustrations, concluding with synthesis statements using "therefore" (des na).
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5141-5145]: chos nyid snang ba (dharmatā vision): vision of nature-of-things, first of four. snang la zhen med (vision without attachment): non-grasping perception. rang byung (self-arisen): arising without cause/conditions.
Line [5146-5150]: nyams gong 'phel (increasing experience): second vision characterized by multiplication. yid la byed (mental engagement): conceptual involvement to be transcended. bskyed rim (generation stage): reference to tantric preliminary practices.
Line [5151-5155]: rig pa tshad phebs (awareness arriving at measure): third vision of complete recognition. sgyu ma lta bu (like illusion): standard simile for appearance-emptiness. rtsis med (without calculation): non-conceptual spontaneity.
Line [5156-5160]: chos zad pa (exhaustion of phenomena): fourth vision where phenomena dissolve into ground. spros pa (elaboration): conceptual proliferation. sgrub pa (accomplishment): achieved without effort.
[CONTEXT] This page contains the classical presentation of the four visions (snang ba bzhi) that defines Tögal practice. The schema derives from the Thod rgal section of the Snying thig ya bzhi and Longchenpa's own Mthong ba don ldan commentary. The progression mirrors the classical Buddhist stages of insight but reconceived within Dzogchen's spontaneous framework: (1) recognition of nature (chos nyid), (2) maturation through repetition (nyams gong 'phel), (3) complete measurement (tshad phebs), (4) exhaustion into ground (chos zad). Each vision builds on the previous while representing distinct qualitative shifts in perception.
[CONCEPT]
• Four visions progressive schema:
1. Dharmatā vision: Initial recognition, like recognizing one's face in mirror
2. Increasing experience: Visions multiply spontaneously, like stars filling sky
3. Awareness at full measure: Complete non-dual recognition, like illusion
4. Exhaustion of phenomena: Liberation into ground, like dreams dissolving
• Characteristics of each:
- First: Natural (rang byung), uncontrived (ma bcos)
- Second: Increasing ('phel), expansive (rgyas pa)
- Third: Measure complete (tshad phebs), illusion-like (sgyu ma lta bu)
- Fourth: Elaboration ceased (spros pa zad), spontaneously complete (lhun grub)
• Teleological structure:
- Progressive yet non-gradual (rim pa yin yang cig car)
- Each stage contains previous yet transcends it
- Culmination in "beyond practice" (sgom pa las 'das)
[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the third vision (rig pa tshad phebs) through a bipartite structure: first establishing definition and scriptural citation [5247-5265], then dividing into general explanation and specific three-measure analysis [5266-5281]. The passage employs quotative markers (zhes bya ste, zhes pa) citing canonical sources Thal 'gyur and Bstan bu, followed by enumeration markers (dang po...gnyis pa) for the two-part exposition.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5247-5248]: mu khyud (rim/encirclement) + gtsos 'khor (main retinue): technical terms for mandala architecture. chos sku'i sbyang ba (dharmakāya purification): reference to completion stage processes.
Line [5249-5251]: rig pa tshad phebs (awareness arriving at measure): technical definition—rig pa as ground-abiding awareness made manifest, tshad as measure of full mandala manifestation, phebs as arriving beyond limitation. 'brel tshad (connection measure): karmic linkages that no longer regenerate.
Line [5266-5271]: rang bzhin bye brag tu bshad pa (nature particular explanation): structural marker introducing detailed analysis. gzhi gnas kyi rig pa (ground-abiding awareness): awareness naturally present at the base, now made manifest.
Line [5275-5281]: tshad gsum (three measures): (1) phyis snang (outer vision), (2) nang lus kyi tshad (inner body measure), (3) gsang ba rig pa'i tshad (secret awareness measure). zla ba nya gang ba (full moon): metaphor for complete mandala manifestation.
[CONTEXT] This passage situates within the Thod rgal (Direct Transcendence) completion practice of Dzogchen, specifically the third of four visions. The citations from Thal 'gyur (Thal 'gyur sku gsum 'od kyi snang ba) and Bstan bu (likely Gsang ba snying po) authenticate the visionary taxonomy. The three-measure schema reflects physiological, perceptual, and cognitive dimensions of realization. The emphasis on "beyond limitation" ('das sa med pa) distinguishes Dzogchen's spontaneous approach from gradual path constraints.
[CONCEPT]
• Three measures (tshad gsum) taxonomy:
- Outer vision measure: perceptual domain transformation
- Inner body measure: subtle body completion
- Secret awareness measure: cognitive perfection
• Mandala completion indicators:
- Five families as father-mother pairs (rigs lnga yab yum)
- Six, ten, and five-three configurations (drug dang bcu dang lnga gsum)
- Main-retinue architecture (gtsos 'khor)
• Awareness arriving (rig pa tshad phebs):
- Ground-abiding awareness made manifest (gzhi gnas rig pa mngon du gyur)
- Self-resonance display through body-door (sku snang)
- Path-vision exhaustion (lam snang zad du ne ba)
[STRUCTURE] This page presents the inner body measure (nang lus kyi tshad) through poetic citation [5285-5300] followed by phenomenological description [5301-5315]. The structure moves from external signs (visionary appearances) to internal physiology (channels, winds, drops), concluding with teleological implications. Enumerative markers (gnyis pa...gsum pa) organize the progression.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5285-5300]: Thal 'gyur citation enumerating ten signs: thad ka'i dngos snang 'gags pa (direct objects cease), sa rdo'i snang ba bzhu ba (earth-stone vision dissolve), rang shes ci la'ang tshud pa (self-knowing enters everything), de btsud bems po 'gul ba (inserted inert moves), rlung gi 'gyu ba'i tshad zin (wind movement measure grasped), lus kyi rdul phran mthong ba 'byung (body's subtle atoms seen appear), cir snang gzugs kur rdzogs pa (whatever appears as form-kāya completes), de las yab yum 'khril ba (from that father-mother embrace), lnga lnga yab dang yum sbyor (five-five father-mother union), kun kyang mu khyud zlum po la (all in round rim encirclement).
Line [5301-5306]: 'A dkar po (white A): seed syllable at heart center. 'od zer lnga (five light-rays): corresponding to five elements/wisdoms. thor tshugs (topknot/crown): cranial fontanelle as visionary aperture. rdul phran (subtle atoms): paramāṇu-level perception. lhun grub kyi sgo brgyad (eight doors of spontaneous completion): visionary apertures of the body.
[CONTEXT] The ten signs derive from classical Dzogchen visionary literature, particularly the Thod rgal sections of Snying thig ya bzhi. The physiology described operates within subtle body (phra ba'i lus) theory—central channel (rtsa dbu ma), heart cakra (snying ga), crown aperture (thor tshugs). The eight doors (sgo brgyad) correspond to sensory and cognitive apertures through which spontaneous vision manifests. This represents the interfacing of tantric subtle body theory with Dzogchen's direct vision approach.
[CONCEPT]
• Ten signs of body measure completion:
- External: vision dissolution, earth-stone melting
- Internal: self-knowing permeation, inert matter animation
- Physiological: wind control, atomic vision, form-kāya completion
- Visionary: yab-yum union, mandala encirclement
• Eight doors of spontaneous completion (lhun grub kyi sgo brgyad):
- Eyes, ears, nose, tongue (four sensory)
- Navel, heart, throat, crown (four cakra)
- All visions as self-display (rang snang la snang ba)
• Crown aperture physiology:
- Thor tshugs as wind-abode (rlung gnas)
- Self-elevating wind (rang bzhin gyis 'deg pa)
- Five-colored lights ('od zer lnga)
[STRUCTURE] This page presents the secret awareness measure (gsang ba rig pa'i tshad) through citation [5316-5332] and definition [5333-5350]. The structure employs verse quotation followed by prose exegesis, with concluding synthesis using des na (therefore). The passage connects physiological transformation with cognitive perfection.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5316-5332]: Citation on body transformation: rdul dang bral (free from atoms), bar snang 'od kyi skar khung (sky light apertures), lcags kyu'i dbyibs (hook shapes), zang thal dri med 'od kyi lus (unimpeded stainless light body), A yi mtshan ma (A mark/sign), thor tshugs rlung gis 'deg (crown wind elevates), zhi sku (peaceful kāya), thod pa'i gzhal yas (skull palace), he ru ka mngon 'byung (Heruka manifest).
Line [5333-5340]: gsang ba (secret): hidden dimension beyond outer/inner. phra rags 'gyu ba'i sems (subtle-gross moving mind): range of mind from coarse to refined. kun gzhi rnam shes (all-base consciousness): ālayavijñāna as reference point. mngon shes (clairvoyance): five or six superknowledges.
Line [5341-5350]: spyan chags pa (attachment): cognitive obstacle even at advanced stages. rang gis shes pa zin (self-knowing grasped): subtle duality. snang ba lhug par shar (vision freely dawn): unobstructed manifestation. chos kyi sprin (cloud of dharmas): tenth bhūmi metaphor.
[CONTEXT] This passage operates at the intersection of tantric subtle body completion and Dzogchen awareness perfection. The citation describes rainbow body ('ja' lus) formation through light-transformation. The distinction between outer, inner, and secret measures reflects the trikāya structure—nirmāṇakāya (body), sambhogakāya (perception), dharmakāya (awareness). The critique of mngon shes without spyan chags liberation reflects Nyingma concerns about siddhis without realization.
[CONCEPT]
• Secret awareness measure dimensions:
- Subtle-gross mind purification (phra rags 'gyu ba'i sems dag)
- Beyond all-base consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes tsam)
- Without attachment to awareness qualities (rig pa'i yon tan spyan chags med)
• Clairvoyance classification:
- Six superknowledges (mngon shes drug tshan)
- Near/far knowledge (ring lkog)
- Instantaneous knowledge (skad cig shes)
• Transformation markers:
- Stainless light body (dri med 'od kyi lus)
- Three kāyas as one entwined (sku gsum gcig 'dril)
- Body exhausted to measure (lus zad tshad las grol)
[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the fourth vision—exhaustion of dharmatā (chos nyid zad pa)—through phenomenological description [5358-5382] and scriptural citation [5364-5382]. The structure moves from causal explanation (las/byung) to teleological conclusion (don gyi 'bras bu), using comparative metaphors (skar mda', me stag). The passage employs technical terms for body-mind separation (lus sems 'brel chod).
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5358-5363]: rlung phir 'phangs (wind outward projected): energetic release from internal circulation. nang du ma bzung (not held internally): absence of reabsorption. rtog pa skad cig gnyis par mi sdod (thought not abide two moments): instantaneous thought-flow. lus sems 'brel chod (body-mind connection severed): somatic liberation marker.
Line [5361]: rnam shes kun gzhi'i cha (all-base consciousness aspect): residual cognitive structure. rtog med yul rig pa (non-conceptual object awareness): non-dual perception. me stag 'phro ba (sparks shooting): metaphor for energetic display.
Line [5370-5382]: mthong byed (seer/witness): subject pole. mthong bya (seen/objects): object pole. zag bcas (with outflows): conditioned phenomena. zag med (without outflows): unconditioned liberation. 'pho ba chen mo (great transference): highest attainment.
[CONTEXT] This material presents the culmination of Tögal practice—exhaustion of phenomena into dharmatā. The body-mind separation represents a key Dzogchen concept distinct from ordinary death; here the body becomes translucent (zang thal) while awareness expands limitlessly. The "great transference" ('pho ba chen mo) refers to the Vimalamitra tradition of leaving the body as light without remainder. The three realms (khams gsum) non-return (phyir mi ldog) marks irreversible liberation.
[CONCEPT]
• Fourth vision characteristics:
- Dharmatā exhaustion (chos nyid zad pa)
- Body-mind separation (lus sems 'brel chod)
- Three realms non-return (khams gsum phyir mi ldog)
- Great transference attainment ('pho ba chen mo)
• Cognitive transformation:
- All-base consciousness as sparks (kun gzhi skar mda')
- Awareness compassion wisdom (rig pa thugs rje shes rab)
- Seer-seen duality dissolved (mthong byed gnyis)
• Somatic markers:
- Unimpeded body (lus zang thal)
- Light body completion ('od gsal sku)
- Beyond death and birth ('chi skye dang bral)
[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the exhaustion of dharmatā (chos nyid zad pa) through comparative metaphor [5398-5401], existential implications [5402-5411], and definitional analysis [5412-5428]. The structure employs analogy (birth-death four), causal reasoning (pas/bas), and enumeration (rim gyis/cig car). The passage concludes with technical definitions distinguishing conditioned vs. unconditioned exhaustion.
[PHILOLOGY] Line [5398]: skye rga na 'chi bzhi'i 'phel zad pa (birth-aging-illness-death four's waxing-waning): biological metaphor for cosmic cycles. phyis snod (outer vessel/container): inanimate environment. nang bcud (inner essence): sentient beings.
Line [5402-5411]: 'khrul pa'i chos (delusion dharmas): phenomena of error. chos nyid don dam (dharmatā ultimate): ultimate truth. chos can dang chos nyid (dharmin and dharmatā): subject and nature distinction.
Line [5412-5418]: kun gzhi'i cha sgo gsum (all-base's three doors): body-speech-mind as expressions of fundamental ignorance (ma rig pa). rtsa ba'i ma rig pa (root ignorance): original non-recognition.
Line [5424-5428]: rim gyis (gradual) vs. cig car (instantaneous): classical distinction in Buddhist praxis. snang ba bzhi tshad du phyin pa (four visions arriving at measure): completion of visionary path as prerequisite for gradual exhaustion.
[CONTEXT] This passage addresses a critical juncture in Dzogchen theory—the "exhaustion" of phenomena into dharmatā. The distinction between gradual (rim gyis) and instantaneous (cig car) exhaustion reflects broader Tibetan debates about realization modalities. The cosmic metaphor (outer vessel/inner essence) derives from Abhidharma cosmology but reinterpreted through Dzogchen's lens of spontaneous perfection. The critique of denying form-kāya (sku) and wisdom (ye shes) in result-phase reflects Nyingma polemics against nihilistic interpretations of emptiness.
[CONCEPT]
• Exhaustion modalities:
- Gradual: four visions completed, phenomena gradually dissolve
- Instantaneous: immediate recognition of dharmatā, simultaneous liberation
- Supreme intellect instantaneous (blo mchog cig car): special capacity
• Dharmatā exhaustion dimensions:
- Outer: five-light vision with form-kāya exhausted
- Inner: subtle body with thought-aggregates exhausted
- Secret: experience-vision objects exhausted
- Result: pure-from-beginning vision cloudless sky-like
• Cosmological parallels:
- Birth-aging-illness-death waxing-waning
- Outer vessel disintegration
- Inner essence lifespan limits
- Three realms non-liberation if incomplete
