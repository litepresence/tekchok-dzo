[STRUCTURE]
This page continues the citation-based structure with extensive quotations from major Nyingma tantras: *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arising Awareness), *Nor bu 'phrul bkod* (Magical Display of Jewels), and *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs* (Lion's Perfected Power). The structure alternates between verse citations (*zhes pa*) and the connecting tissue of Longchenpa's commentary. The *Rig pa rang shar* verses establish the impossibility of view, meditation, and conduct (*lta sgom spyod med*), then paradoxically enjoin the reader to "hold in mind the excellent teaching" (*legs bstan yid la zung*). This dialectical structure - negating then affirming - is characteristic of Dzogchen's "beyond yes and no" (*yin min las 'das*). The verses from *Nor bu 'phrul bkod* present a five-line revelation formula: reality emerges from no-thing, appears as object without object, is known by wisdom-without-dharmas, and remains without object in non-recollection.
[PHILOLOGY]
Key terms: *rtsal sgrugs* (power display), *smon pa* (aspiration), *byar med* (nothing to do), *lhun rdzogs* (spontaneously complete), *ye yengs* (primordially non-distracted). The particle *kyang* (also/even) appears in concessive function: *'on kyang legs bstan yid la zung* (nevertheless, hold the excellent teaching in mind). The term *yang dag* (authentic) modifies *rig pa* (awareness), distinguishing authentic awareness (*yang dag rig pa*) from mind (*sems*). The construction *gla yod* (how could there be?) appears repeatedly: *bya dang byed pa gla yod* (how could there be action and agent?). The compound *sgeg pa'i* (*sgyu 'phrul*) indicates the magical display/illusion nature of phenomena. The term *'ub* (swirl/unite) in *thig le gcig tu 'ub* describes the coalescence of all phenomena into a single sphere.
[CONTEXT]
The *Rig pa rang shar* is one of the Seventeen Tantras (*rgyud bcu bdun*) of the Upadesa (Men Ngag De) category, attributed to the eighth-century transmission to Vimalamitra. The *Nor bu 'phrul bkod* and *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs* are also among these seventeen. The phrase *rdzogs chen a ti yo ga* (Great Perfection Atiyoga) explicitly identifies the vehicle. The negation of *bsgom pa* (meditation) while affirming a natural state that is "neither meditated nor not meditated" (*bsgoms dang ma bsgoms*) reflects the *advaya* (non-dual) logic applied to practice. The critique of *sbyin pa dang tshul khrims bzod pa* (generosity, discipline, patience) - the first three perfections (*pha rol tu phyin pa*) - demonstrates Dzogchen's transcendence of the six perfections (*sad paramita*).
[CONCEPT]
The concept of *snying po* (essence/heart) as *chos sku* (dharmakāya) pervading all indicates the immanence of enlightenment. The threefold classification of kāyas - *chos sku* (dharmakāya) through essence (*snying po yin pas*), *longs sku* (sambhogakāya) through clarity (*gsal bar snang bas*), and *sprul sku* (nirmāṇakāya) through mother-child meeting (*ma bu 'phrad pas*) - presents the "resultant" view of Dzogchen: the kāyas are not achieved but recognized as spontaneously present. The term *yang dag* (authentic) applied to *rig pa* creates a technical distinction between ordinary mind (*sems*) and pure awareness (*rig pa*), a hallmark of the *sems sde* tradition. The phrase *bsam dang bral ba'i rig pa* (awareness free from thought) establishes the non-conceptual nature of recognition. The "excellence" (*mchog*) of buddhas' intention (*dgongs pa*) refers to the highest teaching of Atiyoga, which is "beyond one and two" (*gcig dang gnyis las 'das*).
[STRUCTURE]
This page continues the citation-based exposition with verses from the *Klong drug pa* (Six Spaces), *Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long* (Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind), and *Yi ge med pa* (No Letters). The structure maintains the pattern of quotation followed by implicit commentary. The *Klong drug pa* verses present a systematic negation in paired *med* (non-existent) constructions: center-without-extremes, thought-without-objects, no deity yet mantra exists, no dharma yet transcends all imputations, no enemy yet no friend, no body yet no faculties appear. This culminates in the radical negation: "no buddha, no sentient being, no abiding, no emptiness" (*sangs rgyas med cing sems can med/gnas med stong pa nyid kyang med*). The *Kun tu bzang po* verses address error and obscuration (*gol sgrib*), asserting their non-existence in the dharmakāya.
[PHILOLOGY]
The construction *X med Y kyang med* (no X, also no Y) creates a symmetrical negation pattern. The term *mtha'* (extreme) in *mtha' med dbus su* (center without extremes) reflects the Madhyamaka *madhyama pratipad* (middle way) reinterpreted in Dzogchen's absolute sense. The compound *gol sgrib* (error and obscuration) represents the twin obstacles to recognition: *gol* (deviation/error) and *sgrib* (obscuration/veil). The particle *yang* (also/even) intensifies the negation: *gnas med stong pa nyid kyang med* (not even emptiness abides). The term *rnam smin* (ripening/karma) appears in *sdig pa'i rnam smin med* (no ripening of misdeeds), indicating the transcendence of karmic causality. The construction *...med pa las...* (from the non-existent...) indicates emanation without source.
[CONTEXT]
The *Klong drug pa* is another of the Seventeen Tantras, focusing on the "spatial" dimensions of awareness. The equation of "no buddha, no sentient being" (*sangs rgyas med cing sems can med*) echoes the *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa* and *Prajñāpāramitā* literature but is radicalized in Dzogchen's claim that these are not merely empty of inherent existence but spontaneously pure from the beginning. The *Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long* is an important *sems sde* tantra on primordial buddhahood. The reference to *byang chub snying po* (bodhicitta) as free from error and obscuration indicates that the "awakening mind" is not a cultivation but a recognition of innate purity. The phrase *nyon re mongs* (*nyon mongs*/affliction) suggests that holding error and obscuration as dual is itself the affliction.
[CONCEPT]
The concept of *chos med* (no dharma) transcends even the dharma of emptiness: this is not nihilism but the recognition that "dharmas" as reified entities do not exist, while the natural condition (*chos nyid*) spontaneously manifests. The negation of karma (*rnam smin*) and its ripening does not negate conventional causality but asserts that in the recognition of awareness, karmic traces are "self-liberated" (*rang grol*). The phrase *chos kyi sku ni sgrib dang bral ba la* (in the dharmakāya free from obscuration) establishes the intrinsic purity of the nature of mind. The concept of *skye med* (unborn) as *bsam dang bral ba'i rig pa* (awareness free from thought) distinguishes the "unborn" of Dzogchen from the *anutpāda* of Madhyamaka: not merely the absence of arising, but the positive presence of awareness beyond conceptual constructs. The "magical display" (*sgyu 'phrul*) formula - unborn yet all is born, born yet unborn - captures the paradoxical logic of *svābhāvika-kāya*: appearance and emptiness are inseparable.
[STRUCTURE]
This page transitions from tantric citations to sutra references, demonstrating the unity of the Great Vehicle's ultimate teaching. The structure presents: (1) citations from the *Dkon mchog ta la'i mdo* (Ratnagotravibhāga), (2) the *Ting nge 'dzin rgyal po'i mdo* (Samādhirāja Sūtra), (3) the *'Phags pa dkon mchog brtsegs pa* (Ārya Ratnakūṭa), (4) the *Gsang 'dus* (Guhyasamāja), followed by Longchenpa's transition to the second major section of "pointing out essence." This second section (*gnyis pa*) addresses the "non-duality of bondage and liberation" (*'ching grol gnyis su med pa*), subdivided into (a) general presentation through analysis of source, location, and destination (*byung gnas 'gro gsum*), and (b) specific determination through analysis of one and many (*gcig dang tha dad*). The structure then introduces the threefold analysis: source-ariser (*byung sa byung mkhan*), location-abider (*gnas sa gnas mkhan*), and destination-goer (*'gro sa 'gro mkhan*).
[PHILOLOGY]
The term *de bzhin gshegs pa* (tathāgata) appears in the *Ratnagotra* citation with the radical claim that tathāgatas are "always arising" (*rtag tu skye*) - an apparent contradiction to the doctrine of non-arising resolved through Dzogchen's perspective. The compound *bde bar gshegs pa* (sugatā/buddha) equates all phenomena with buddhahood. The term *byis pa'i blo can* (childish intelligence) refers to those who grasp at characteristics (*mtshan mar 'dzin*). The *Samādhirāja* citation uses the temporal formula *sngon bzhin* (as before) and *phyis kyang de bzhin* (later also thus) to establish the eternal sameness of dharmas. The phrase *ma rig nam mkha'* (ignorance like space) appears in the *Ratnakūṭa* citation, equating fundamental ignorance with space - not a defilement but the very condition of display. The term *sgyu 'dra* (like illusion) indicates the *māyā-like* nature of phenomena.
[CONTEXT]
The *Ratnagotravibhāga* (Uttaratantra) is the major Indian śāstra on buddha-nature (*tathāgatagarbha*), providing doctrinal foundation for Nyingma interpretations of universal enlightenment. The *Samādhirāja Sūtra* is a key *prajñāpāramitā* text emphasizing the sameness of all phenomena in their emptiness. The *Ratnakūṭa* is a vast collection of Mahāyāna sūtras, the citation here from its section on emptiness. The *Guhyasamāja* citation bridges sutra and tantra, as it is a major *father tantra* of the Sarma schools but cited here by Nyingma as supporting the dzogchen view. The transition to "analysis of source, location, and destination" (*byung gnas 'gro gsum gyis brtags pa*) reflects the standard Buddhist analytical meditation on the arising, abiding, and passing of phenomena, here applied to the mind itself.
[CONCEPT]
The concept of *de bzhin nyid* (suchness/tathatā) as the equivalence of all phenomena with buddhahood (*sangs rgyas dang 'dra*) is the foundation of "buddha-nature" thought. Longchenpa's citation of these sutras demonstrates Nyingma's claim to represent the authentic Great Vehicle, not merely a tantric innovation. The phrase *ma rig nam mkha' ji bzhin te* (ignorance is like space) is crucial: ignorance is not a defilement to be removed but the very "space" in which wisdom manifests. This distinguishes Dzogchen's "primordial purity" (*ka dag*) from gradualist approaches that view ignorance as adventitious. The threefold analysis (*byung gnas 'gro gsum*) of mind represents the "analytical wisdom" (*so sor rtog pa'i shes rab*) required to cut through (*thag bcad*) the root of dualistic perception. The term *gshis mtha' grol* (essence free from extremes) indicates that awareness is not merely empty of extremes but spontaneously free from their possibility.
[STRUCTURE]
This page executes the threefold analysis of mind's source, location, and destination as introduced in the previous page. The structure follows a rigorous logical examination: (1) analysis of external appearances (*phyi sna tshogs yul du snang ba*) and internal aggregates (*nang phung po gzugs su snang ba*), (2) reduction to atomic insubstantiality (*rdul phran cha med*), (3) recognition that mind does not arise from these (*sems ma byung*), (4) analysis of the arising-agent (*byung mkhan*), (5) recognition of baseless, rootless awareness (*gzhis med rtsa bral*). The structure then applies this analysis to location (*gnas sa*) and destination ('gro sa), concluding with recognition of the three kāyas. The page culminates in a citation from the *Thal 'gyur* (Consequence/Prasaṅgika) tradition, demonstrating Nyingma's synthesis of Madhyamaka analytical method with Dzogchen's direct recognition.
[PHILOLOGY]
The term *shar* (dawn/arise) appears repeatedly as the operative verb for both external appearances and internal thoughts: *phyi ru shar na* (if it dawns externally), *nang du shar na* (if it dawns internally). The compound *tshal pa tshal par* (part by part/particle by particle) indicates analytical reduction. The term *rdul phran* (subtle atom) references the *paramāṇu* of Abhidharma and the consequent *anavasthā* (infinite regress) argument if atoms are divisible. The phrase *gzhis med rtsa bral* (baseless, without root) becomes the concluding formula for the collapse of dualistic perception. The term *sha ra ra 'o la la* is onomatopoeic for mind's chattering/fluctuating quality. The construction *...rang las rang...* (from itself to itself) appears in *khong rang las khong rang byung* (it arose from itself to itself), indicating self-arising without external cause. The term *sangs seng* (suddenly clear) or *sang sang* suggests instantaneous recognition.
[CONTEXT]
The analysis of *byung sa* (source) draws on Abhidharma and Madhyamaka methods of examining the origin of phenomena, here applied specifically to the mind. The reference to *rdul phran* (atoms) and their partlessness (*cha med*) engages with the historical Buddhist debate on the ultimate constituents of matter, resolved here through the recognition that mind does not arise from matter at all. The *Thal 'gyur* (Prasaṅgika) citation demonstrates Nyingma's acceptance of Candrakīrti's analytical tradition while going beyond it to direct recognition. The threefold analysis (*byung gnas 'gro gsum*) mirrors the *trikāla* (three times) analysis in Indian philosophy: where does the mind come from, where does it stay, where does it go? The phrase *sems sbyangs sems kyi gnas lugs shes* (purifying mind by knowing mind's natural condition) indicates that "purification" is not a process but a recognition.
[CONCEPT]
The concept of *gzhis med rtsa bral* (baseless, without root) is the Dzogchen resolution of the Madhyamaka *niḥsvābhāva* (without inherent existence): not merely that phenomena lack inherent existence, but that awareness itself has no ground or foundation (*gzhis med*) - it is "groundless" in the sense of being spontaneously self-arisen. The analysis of *byung sa* (source) and *byung mkhan* (ariser) resolves the subject-object dichotomy: neither does mind arise from external objects (*phyi yul*) nor from internal form (*nang gzugs*), nor does it arise from itself as a substantial entity. The three kāyas are recognized as spontaneously present: *chos sku spros bral chen po* (dharmakāya free from elaborations), *longs sku rang gsal chen po* (sambhogakāya self-clear), *sprul sku rang grol rang shar* (nirmāṇakāya self-liberated, self-arisen). The phrase *ma bsgoms chu bo rgyun gyi bsam gtan* (non-meditated samādhi of river-flow) describes the natural continuity of awareness without deliberate meditation.
[STRUCTURE]
This page concludes the analysis of mind's source-location-destination and transitions to the second aspect under "non-duality of bondage and liberation": analysis of one and many (*gcig dang tha dad la brtags pa*). The structure continues the threefold examination, applying it now to the philosophical problem of whether mind is singular (*gcig*) or multiple (*tha dad*). The opening summary (*snang sems 'brel med zang thal chen por mthong ba*) establishes the vision of appearances-mind as unconnected direct penetration. The page then cites the *'Phags pa dkon mchog brtsegs pa* (Ārya Ratnakūṭa) on the search for mind (*sems yongs su tshol ba*), presenting the standard Mahāyāna analysis: mind is not found externally, internally, or in-between; it has no color or form. This sutra citation serves as scriptural authority for the subsequent logical analysis.
[PHILOLOGY]
The compound *snang sems* (appearances-mind) indicates the nondual vision where external appearances and internal mind are not separate. The term *'brel med* (unconnected) suggests the non-causal, non-sequential nature of this vision. The phrase *chos zad kyi dgongs pa blo zad la shar ba* (the intention of exhausted phenomena dawning as intellect-exhausted) encapsulates the Dzogchen view: when conceptual exhaustion (*blo zad*) meets phenomenal exhaustion (*chos zad*), recognition occurs. The term *sems kyi khang bu* (mind's house/cell) is a metaphor for the enclosed nature of conceptual mind. The compound *'du byed* (conditioned factors) in *'du byas mi rtag* (conditioned things are impermanent) references the second seal of the dharma. The particle *pas* marks logical consequence: *rgyu yod na 'dus byas mi rtag pas* (if there is a cause, conditioned things are impermanent, therefore...).
[CONTEXT]
The *Ratnakūṭa* citation on searching for mind references the extensive literature on *cittamātra* (mind-only) analysis, particularly the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* and *Prajñāpāramitā* discussions of mind's unfindability. The assertion that mind is not blue (*sngon po*), not yellow (*ser po*), etc., follows the standard negation of perceptual attributes applied to the mind. The analysis of one and many (*gcig dang tha dad*) is the classic Buddhist and Indian philosophical dilemma: is the self/mind singular (like the ātman of Vedānta) or multiple (like the momentary cittas of Abhidharma)? Dzogchen's answer transcends both: neither singular nor plural, nor both, nor neither - the tetralemma (*catuṣkoṭi*) applied to mind itself. The *sems kyi khang bu bshig pa* (destroying mind's house) indicates the dismantling of the conceptual construction of self.
[CONCEPT]
The concept of *snang sems 'brel med* (appearances-mind unconnected) is paradoxical: appearances and mind are not connected by causation, yet they are not separate. This is the Dzogchen resolution of idealism vs. realism: appearances are mind, but mind is not the "cause" of appearances - both arise simultaneously as spontaneous display (*rtsal*). The phrase *chos zad blo zad* (exhaustion of phenomena, exhaustion of intellect) describes the meeting point of analysis and recognition: when conceptual elaboration is exhausted, the natural state appears. The analysis of one and many demonstrates that mind cannot be a singular entity (because it appears differently in different beings) nor multiple (because it has no parts). This is the *anekānta* (non-one-sided) logic of Madhyamaka applied to destroy the reified concept of mind, leaving only the "baseless awareness" (*gzhis med rig pa*) as the residuum of analysis. The term *lam gyi gnad tha dad pa'i 'jug sgo* (entry doors of different path vitals) refers to the various Buddhist vehicles, all transcended in Dzogchen's direct recognition.
[6416-6425] [STRUCTURE] Analysis of One and Many Applied to Mind
**Analysis:** This section applies the classical Buddhist logical dilemma of one (*gcig*) and many (*tha dad*) to the nature of mind (*sems*). The structure presents a trilemma: (1) if mind were singular, absurd consequences follow (all beings would die simultaneously); (2) if minds were multiple, shared perception would be impossible; (3) the body-mind analogy demonstrates the impossibility of consciousnesses uniting into a single stream. This follows the standard Madhyamaka deconstructive methodology applied to the specific case of mind.
[6416] [PHILOLOGY] *Ldog pa med na*
**Analysis:** The phrase *ldog pa med na* (if there is no reversal/return) introduces a conditional analysis. The term *ldog pa* denotes logical reversal or return to a previous state. Without such reversal, the aggregates (*phung po*) of beings would arise in absurd ways. The particle *na* marks the protasis (if-clause) of a conditional construction.
[6417-6423] [CONCEPT] Consequences of Plural Minds
**Analysis:** If minds were various/plural (*sna tshogs pa*):
- Self and other thought (*rang gzhan gyi rtog pa*) would arise simultaneously (*thang cig tu*)
- Mutual intermingling (*phan tshun 'chol ba*) would prevent distinct experiences
- Self-conquest (*rang rgyal ba*), not dying (*ma shi ba*), absence of suffering, and defeat of others would all be impossible
- The entire structure of samsaric experience would collapse
[6424-6428] [CONTEXT] Classical Buddhist Debate
**Analysis:** The *gal te tha dad pa yin na ni* construction engages with the classical Indian philosophical debate between:
- Ātmavādins (eternalists asserting a singular self)
- Buddhist *anātmavādins* (denying both singular and plural self)
The argument that one dying implies all die (*gcig shi bas kun shi ba*) references the standard critique of universal self theories found in Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*.
[6429-6431] [STRUCTURE] Search and Non-Finding
**Analysis:** Having exhausted logical analysis (*rgal bas brtags te btsal bas*), the text arrives at the quintessential realization: not finding anything (*gang yang ma rnyed pa*) constitutes the realization (*rtogs pa*) through wisdom-power (*shes rab kyi dbang pos*) of the meaning pure from the beginning in reality (*chos nyid ka nas dag pa'i don*).
[6430] [PHILOLOGY] *Chos nyid ka nas dag pa*
**Analysis:** The phrase *chos nyid ka nas dag pa* (pure from the beginning in dharmatā/reality) employs *ka nas* (from the primordial) to indicate timeless purity, not achieved through purification. The term *chos nyid* (dharmatā) denotes the ultimate nature of phenomena, distinct from conventional characterizations.
[6431-6439] [CONCEPT] The Causal Dilemma
**Analysis:** The text presents a trilemma regarding mind's causation:
1. **If mind has no cause** (*sems la rgyu med*):
- Return/reversal (*ldog pa*) is impossible
- Karma-accumulation (*las kyi bsags pa*) becomes endless without resolution
2. **If mind has cause** (*sems la rgyu yod na*):
- Results (*'bras bu*) must follow
- If result is samsara (*'khor ba*), impurity prevents liberation
- If transcended (*'das pa*), samsara's arising becomes illogical
3. **If both** (*gnyis ka yin na*):
- Samsara and nirvana would be different (*'khor 'das tha dad pa*)
- Therefore mind would also become different
- Memory and thought-streams could not unite into one family (*rigs gcig tu 'dus pa*)
The resolution: *rigs gcig tu 'du bas shes so* (known through gathering into one family) transcends the dilemma.
[6440-6453] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Citations from *Kun byed rgyal po*
**Analysis:** The citations from the All-Creating King (*Kun byed rgyal po*) establish the Dzogchen view:
- *Ma rig 'khrul 'khor 'di la zad med 'phel ba med* (This ignorance-illusion-wheel has no exhaustion, no increase)
- *Sems can khams kyi rang bzhin de yang ma mtha' med* (The nature of the realm of beings is also without end)
These establish the non-arising (*skye ba med pa*) and non-increase (*'phel ba med pa*) of mind, foundational to the self-liberation (*rang grol*) view.
[6454-6459] [STRUCTURE] Causal Implications: No Increase, No Birth
**Analysis:** This section traces the logical implications of mind having no cause (*rgyu med*). The structure follows a chain: no increase → no birth → no death → no agent/receiver (*las po*). Each negation builds upon the previous, culminating in scriptural citation from the *Samādhirāja-sūtra* (*Ting nge 'dzin rgyal po mdo*).
[6454-6455] [PHILOLOGY] *'Phel ba med pas skye ba med*
**Analysis:** The causal chain uses the ablative particle *pas* (because of/from) to indicate logical consequence:
- *'phel ba med pas* (from no increase)
- *skye ba med par shes* (know no birth)
- *skye ba med pas 'chi ba med par shes* (from no birth, know no death)
This demonstrates the Madhyamaka method of deconstructing temporal processes applied to mind.
[6456] [CONCEPT] Agent Without Object
**Analysis:** The phrase *las la po'ang ngan med par shes te* (and one knows there is also no bad/harm for the agent) indicates that without birth and death, the entire structure of karma—agent, action, and recipient—collapses. The term *las po* (agent/doer) finds no referent.
[6457-6459] [CONTEXT] *Samādhirāja-sūtra* Citation
**Analysis:** The citation *yod dang med pa 'di gnyis med pa'i chos yin te* (existence and non-existence, these two are dharmas of non-existence) from the King of Samādhi Sūtra establishes the transcendence of binary conceptual extremes. This situates the text within the *Prajñāpāramitā* tradition of non-dual wisdom.
[6460-6462] [PHILOLOGY] *Ye gdod ma nas rang gdod med*
**Analysis:** The phrase *ye gdod ma nas rang gdod med pa* (primordially, from the beginning, without self-establishment) employs *gdod ma nas* (from the primordial) and *rang gdod med* (without self-establishment) to indicate that mind has never arisen as a substantial entity. The rhetorical question *sems can skye bar ga la 'gyur* (how could beings arise?) underscores the impossibility of samsaric emergence.
[6463-6471] [STRUCTURE] Critique of Conditions Applied to Mind
**Analysis:** The text shifts to analyze conditions (*rkyen*) applied to mind, presenting another trilemma:
1. If conditions exist: mind would become various (*sna tshogs su 'gyur*), preventing unified memory-thought streams
2. If conditions exist: mind would necessarily be impermanent (*g tan 'jig par 'gyur*)
3. Without conditions: present memory-thought would be impossible
The resolution maintains *sgyu ma ltar gnas pa tsam* (merely existing like illusion) as the Middle Way.
[6463-6465] [CONCEPT] Condition Analysis
**Analysis:** The argument *sems la rkyen med pa* (mind has no conditions) parallels the earlier causal analysis:
- If conditions exist: colors/appearances would vary (*kha dog sogs pa sna tshogs su 'gyur*)
- This would make unified consciousness impossible (*dran bsam gcig tu mi rigs*)
- The body-color and sense-faculties (*lus kyi kha dog dang skye mched*) would all differ even while occupying a body
[6466-6471] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological Precision
**Analysis:** Key terms in the condition critique:
- *Rkyen* (condition): distinguished from *rgyu* (cause)—conditions are external supporting factors
- *Gtan 'jig pa* (certain destruction/impermanence): marks the necessary consequence of conditioned existence
- *Sgyu ma ltar gnas pa tsam* (merely existing like illusion): the *māyā-upamā* (illusion simile) common to both Madhyamaka and Yogācāra, indicating apparent existence without substantial nature
[6472-6488] [CONTEXT] *Rtsa ba shes rab* and *Kun byed rgyal po* Citations
**Analysis:** The page cites two authoritative sources:
1. **Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (lines 6480-6484):**
- *Sa bon zhing dang ma zhing las/myu gu skye ba ma yin te* (From seed, field, or no-field, sprout is not born)
- *Khyod kyis chos rnams thams cad ni/sgyu ma 'byung ba bzhin du bstan* (You taught all dharmas arise like illusion)
2. **All-Creating King (lines 6486-6488):**
- *Rkyen lnga po ni yod ma yin* (Five conditions do not exist)
These establish the intertextual continuity with both Indian Madhyamaka and Tibetan Nyingma tantric sources.
[6472-6476] [CONCEPT] Dream and Illusion Analogies
**Analysis:** The text employs the *svapnopamā* (dream simile):
- Present memory-thought (*da lta'i dran bsam*) is compared to joy at finding jewels in last night's dream (*mdang gi rmi lam gyi nor bu rnyed pa la dga' ba*)
- Upon waking (*sad du*), nothing exists (*ci yang med pa*)
- Similarly, present fixation (*zhen*) on apparent reality reveals no true existence (*rjes la ci yang med pa*)
This illustrates *gnas skabs kyi bden rdzun* (apparent truth of the temporary state)—appearances without substantial existence.
[6477-6479] [CONCEPT] Cloud and Sky Simile
**Analysis:** The simile of clouds (*sprin*) in space (*nam mkha'*):
- Clouds gather temporarily (*glo bur du 'khrigs pa*) without going anywhere when they dissipate (*gar song cha med glo bur du yal ba*)
- Even while clouds appear (*snang ba*), they do not exist in space (*nam mkha' la med kyang de'i ngang na snang ba*)
- Similarly, appearances arise without cause/condition in mind
This demonstrates the *āgantuka* (adventitious) nature of appearances while mind remains unobscured.
[6489-6490] [STRUCTURE] Conclusion of Causal Analysis
**Analysis:** The section concludes with citation from the All-Creating King establishing the "path without cause and condition" (*rgyu dang rkyen med zhi ba mchog gi lam*). This marks a transition from deconstructive analysis to the positive assertion of Dzogchen view—primordial peace (*zhi ba*) as the supreme path without dependence on causal conditions.
[6489] [PHILOLOGY] *Rgyu dang rkyen med zhi ba mchog gi lam*
**Analysis:** The phrase employs:
- *Rgyu dang rkyen med* (without cause and condition): ablative construction indicating freedom from
- *Zhi ba* (peace/cessation): the primordial state, not achieved through effort
- *Mchog gi lam* (supreme path): superlative indicating this transcends all lower vehicles
This is the *niṣprapañca* (non-conceptual) path distinguished from causal vehicles.
[6491-6493] [STRUCTURE] Ontological Status of Mind
**Analysis:** The text shifts to direct ontological inquiry: *sems yod na* (if mind exists), is it:
1. Material/formed (*dngos po gzugs can du yod dam*)
2. Formless (*gzugs med du yod*)
This binary presents the standard options for mind's substantial existence, both of which the text will negate.
[6494] [CONCEPT] Refutation of Material Mind
**Analysis:** The argument against material mind:
- If material: would be perceptible to sense-faculties (*dbang po'i mngon sum*)
- Would be visible/observable (*bltar rung ba*)
- But no such observable mind is perceived (*dmigs pa'i mngon sum*)
This follows standard Buddhist critique of materialism (*bhautika*), distinguishing mind from physical form (*rupa*).
[6495-6501] [PHILOLOGY] Movement Analysis
**Analysis:** The analysis of movement (*'gyu ba*) employs the standard Buddhist causal triad:
- *'Das ma 'ongs da lta gsum* (past, future, present three)
- *Phrad pa* (contact/meeting): the necessary condition for causation
The argument: if past and present movement meet (*'gyu ba sna ma dang da lta'i 'gyu ba phrad na*), then past memory would still exist unceased (*ma 'gags par yod dgos*). But this contradicts pastness (*sna ma yin par 'gal*). If they don't meet (*ma phrad na*), present cognition would arise without cause (*rgyu med 'gyur*).
[6495-6501] [CONTEXT] Classical Buddhist Kinematic Analysis
**Analysis:** This analysis of motion references:
- The *Kālakārīya* analysis of time and motion
- Nāgārjuna's critique of motion in *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* Chapter II
- The broader Buddhist project of deconstructing temporal processes
The conclusion *khegs so* (refuted/defeated) marks the successful negation of movement as a substantial entity.
[6502-6504] [STRUCTURE] One or Many Movement
**Analysis:** Applying the one/many dilemma to movement itself:
1. If one (*gcig*): variety (*sna tshogs par*) would be lost—movement could not appear in diverse forms
2. If different/plural (*tha dad*): mover (*'gyu byed*) being one would be lost—the unity of the moving subject collapses
Both options lead to *nyams* (loss/deficiency), demonstrating the untenability of substantialized movement.
[6505-6521] [CONCEPT] Fourfold Direct Introduction (*ngo sprod*)
**Analysis:** The text presents four methods of direct introduction to mind's nature:
1. **Space-Without (*nam med*)** [6508]:
- Without space, memory-thought cannot be introduced (*ngo sprad*)
- Therefore mind has no ground (*sems la gzhi med*)
- Knowing this: no reversal place (*ldog sa med*)
2. **Appearance-Awareness (*snang shes*)** [6512-6516]:
- Introduction between former and later appearances
- Mind not established as cause or characteristic (*rgyu dang mtshan nyid du ma grub*)
- Thought (*dran bsam*) adventitious (*glo bur gyi rtog pa*)
3. **Mind Former-Later (*blo sna phyis*)** [6518-6521]:
- Introduction between former and later mind
- Mind has no root (*rts ba med*)
- Mind itself is one wheel of display (*sems nyid gcig gi 'khor lo*)
Each method progressively refines the recognition of mind's nature through direct introduction rather than conceptual analysis.
[6505] [PHILOLOGY] *Sems yod par ma grub*
**Analysis:** The phrase *sems yod par ma grub* (mind is not established as existing) employs the negative perfective *ma grub* (not established/proven) to indicate that mind cannot be substantiated through either existence or non-existence. This is the Madhyamaka *niḥsvabhāva* (without own-nature) applied specifically to mind.
[6506] [CONCEPT] Rootless as Space
**Analysis:** The simile *rtsa bral nam mkha' 'dra* (like space without root) establishes:
- No birth (*skye ba med*)
- No birthplace (*skye gzhi med*)
- Therefore no reversal place (*ldog pa'i sa med*)
Space (*nam mkha'*) serves as the quintessential example of uncaused, unconditioned, non-substantial existence.
[6510] [PHILOLOGY] *Khams gsum ming med chen po*
**Analysis:** The phrase *khams gsum ming med chen po* (three realms, great namelessness) employs:
- *Ming med* (nameless): beyond all designation and conceptual imputation
- *Chen po* (great): superlative indicating the vastness of this realization
This marks the transcendence of the entire samsaric structure through recognition of mind's nature.
[6511] [CONCEPT] Beyond Karma
**Analysis:** The realization that *las dge sdig gi phan gnon med* (no benefit or harm from virtuous or non-virtuous karma) does not constitute antinomianism but rather the transcendence of karma's operation from the perspective of realized mind. The phrase *blo bde ba* (mind at ease/peace) indicates the soteriological fruit of this recognition.
[6522-6527] [STRUCTURE] Breaking the House of Mind: Sixteen Dharmas
**Analysis:** This page synthesizes previous analyses into the "destruction of mind's house" (*sems kyi khang bu bshig pa*). The structure presents four similes (*dpe*) for self-destruction through analysis, culminating in the "fourfold direct introduction" (*ngo sprod pa bzhi*) and sixteen dharmas of non-existence (*med pa'i chos bcu drug*).
[6522] [PHILOLOGY] *Blo bde ba*
**Analysis:** The term *blo bde ba* (mind at ease/peace) marks the soteriological conclusion of analysis. The particle *pas* indicates causal consequence: through cutting (*chod pa*) the misconception of mind's existence, one realizes the non-existence from which no deviation is possible (*ma rtogs pa'i logs pa med*).
[6523-6527] [CONCEPT] Fourfold Direct Introduction
**Analysis:** The four introductions continue from previous page:
4. **Dharmatā Former-Later** [6523-6527]: Introduction between former and later dharmatā reveals mind without birth. Knowing this: propensities (*bag chags*) and body alaya cannot harm. The "house of mind" is like a child's sandcastle—built while dissolving.
[6528-6532] [STRUCTURE] Fruition of Non-Existence
**Analysis:** The conclusion of the four times analysis (*dus bzhi*):
- No buddha exists → buddha is merely name (*ming tsam*)
- Hope for fruition (*'bras bu la re ba*) is reversed (*blo ldog*)
- Therefore no path of effort (*'bad rtsol*)
- Liberation's measure (*grol ba'i tshad*) means not finding anything in existence or non-existence
[6528-6532] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological Precision
**Analysis:** Key terms:
- *Sangs rgyas med pas* (because buddha does not exist): ablative *pas* indicating consequence
- *Ming tsam* (mere name): nominalist critique of substantial buddhahood
- *'Khor 'das su btags pa* (designated as samsara/nirvana): the merely nominal status of all dichotomies
[6533-6548] [STRUCTURE] Sixteen Dharmas and Three Results
**Analysis:** The sixteen dharmas (*chos can bcu drug*) break mind's house through four sets of four analyses each, culminating in three results (*'bras bu gsum*):
1. **Appearance-mind nondual without fixation** (*bem rig gnyis med*) [6571]
2. **Mind's house self-destructed, movement-thoughts cleared** (*'gyu ba rtogs sangs*) [6573]
3. **Knowing the dissolution place** (*yal sa*) of nondual matter-awareness [6574]
[6536-6548] [CONCEPT] Four Similes of Destruction
**Analysis:** The destruction of mind's house (*sems kyi khang bu bshig pa*) employs four similes:
1. **Child's sandcastle** (*byis pa'i khang bu*) [6538]: Built while collapsing—illusory construction
2. **Iron destroyed by iron** (*lcags kyis lcags 'jig*) [6539]: Mind analyzes mind into non-existence
3. **Impermanent destroyed by impermanent** (*mi rtag pas mi rtag pa 'jig*) [6540-6542]:
- Illusory person destroys illusory city (*sgyu ma'i mi sgru ma'i grong khyer bcom*)
- Compounded destroyed by compounded (*byas pas mi rtag pa 'jig*) like corpses heaped (*ro la ro brtsegs*)
- Awareness destroys previous unawareness (*rig pa da ltar bas ma rig pa sna ma 'jig*)
[6543-6546] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Analogies
**Analysis:** The similes draw on:
- *Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra*: illusory city and illusory beings
- *Prajñāpāramitā*: dream and magical display analogies
- *Cintāmaṇi* (wish-fulfilling jewel) [6544]: Like a poor person searching in a poor house, there is no finding-place (*rnyed pa'i gnas med*)
- Letters on water (*chu la yi ge bris pa*) [6543]: Mind's traces dissolve without residue
[6547-6548] [PHILOLOGY] *Sems med pa'i don*
**Analysis:** The phrase *sems med pa'i don ma shes par* (without understanding the meaning of mind's non-existence) sets up the critique: those who seek through view, meditation, and conduct (*lta sgom spyod pa*) while searching in mind are like those grasping at water when waves subside (*rdib pa'i tshe chu la 'dzin pa*)—there is no place to grasp.
**Analysis:** This page addresses objections to the analysis of mind's non-existence. The structure presents: (1) objection that dissolution (*yal ba*) implies transformation from existence to non-existence; (2) response that dissolution was never established and is adventitious; (3) objection that destroying mind's house is futile; (4) response that recognizing primordial non-existence is the destruction itself.
**Analysis:** The objection *sems yal zhes yod pa de med par song ba ma yin nam* (doesn't "mind dissolved" mean it went from existence to non-existence?) employs the terminative *par* indicating transformation. The response uses *yal rgyu dang yal rkyen gang du yang med* (nowhere is there cause or condition of dissolution) to deny that dissolution is an event requiring causal support.
**Analysis:** The citation from Samantabhadra's Mirror of Mind presents three obscurations (*sgrib pa gsum*):
1. *Snang ba chos skur 'dod pa* (viewing appearances as dharmakāya) - subtle reification
2. *Cir snang sems su 'dod pa* (viewing whatever appears as mind) - idealism
3. *Rang byung gzhan 'dod pa* (desiring self-arising as other) - dualism
These represent the Nyingma critique of both eternalist and nihilist extremes, as well as the error of reifying even nondual awareness.
**Analysis:** The concept of *yal ba* (dissolution) is carefully distinguished from transformation:
- Upon analysis (*dpyad na*): never established (*ma grub pa*)
- Without analysis (*ma dpyad na*): adventitious thought (*glo bur gyi dran bsam*) dissolves
- Never was there a "mind-owning continuum" (*sems rang rgyud pa*) to undergo transformation
This preserves the *niḥsvabhāva* (without own-nature) of mind without falling into nihilism.
**Analysis:** The three results (*'bras bu gsum*) represent the fruitional dimension of analysis:
**Analysis:** The term *tha snyad kyi 'bras bu* (conventional result) indicates that these results are pedagogical designations, not ultimate attainments. Key phrases:
- *Dran pa'i khungs chos nyid du song bas* (source of memory having gone to reality)
- *Med pa go bar byas pa* (made the non-existent understood)
- *Bem po'i snang ba* (inert appearance) - matter/appearance
- *Yul sems gnyis med* (object-mind nondual)
**Analysis:** The progression of three results:
1. **Nondual without fixation** [6571]:
- Inert appearances placed on object (*yul gyi gnad*)
- Without fixation (*'dzin med*)
- Object-mind nondual result
2. **Self-destructed, thoughts cleared** [6573]:
- Whatever knowing placed on knowing's ground (*shes pa gang 'gyus kyi steng du*)
- Mind's house self-destructed (*sems kyi khang bu rang zhig*)
- Movement-thoughts cleared (*'gyu ba rtogs sangs*)
3. **Dissolution place known** [6574]:
- Inert-awareness (*bem rig*) nondual
- Union wisdom (*zung 'jug ye shes*)
- Dissolution place (*yal sa*) recognized
- Result of non-existence (*med pa'i 'bras bu*)
**Analysis:** The page transitions to the *gsang chen nges pa snying thig* (Great Secret Definitive Essence/Heart Essence) section. The structure presents:
- *Khregs chod* (Cutting Through) instruction: *sems ye med rang sangs* (mind primordially non-existent, self-liberated)
- Distinction from other instructions: some merely provisional (*drang ba*), not definitive (*nges don*)
**Analysis:** The text distinguishes Dzogchen from other approaches:
- *Lta sgom sems la lam byed gnyis* (view and meditation making mind the path) - lower approaches
- *Rang grol rang shar rang gzhag* (self-liberated, self-arisen, self-placed) - Dzogchen
- The distinction of *don mi mthun* (meaning not discordant) despite apparent differences
- *Zung 'jug* (union) here means non-dual in non-existence, not two things united
**Analysis:** The phrase *theg pa kun las rtse mor gyur pa'i gnad* (key point that is the pinnacle of all vehicles) establishes Dzogchen's superiority within the Nyingma doxography. The instruction encompasses:
- Not viewing appearances as mind (*snang ba sems su mi 'dod pa*)
- Mind never experienced as ground (*sems yod ma myong gzhi sangs*)
- Heart Essence (*snying thig*) intent of direct introduction
