[1849-1858] [CONCEPT] Self-Path and Impurities
**Analysis:** "Self-path in, gate three of defilements and dross-with aggregates" (*rang lam du sgo gsum gyi dri ma dang gdos bcas kyi phung po*). This refers to the three gates (body, speech, mind) and the five aggregates with their impurities.
"When those pure, below ground-path incidental complete sign dawn" (*de dag dag dus 'og ma'i sa lam zhar la rdzogs pa'i rtags shar*). Signs of completion dawn incidentally when lower paths are purified through upper completion.
"Upper complete by, below incidental complete become, intending, Great Completion one in, training-traverse not need, speak" (*gong ma rdzogs pas 'og ma zhar la rdzogs par 'gyur ba la dgongs nas rdzogs pa chen pos gcig pa la / sbyang bgrod mi dgos par gsung*). This expresses the Dzogchen view that when the upper/ultimate is complete, the lower/relative completes spontaneously without need for gradual training.
"Ground one rigpa spontaneously-accomplish" (*sa gcig ni rig pa lhun grub*). "All-do to, not-transform not-train rigpa spontaneously-complete" (*kun byed la / ma bsgyur ma sbyangs rig pa lhun rdzogs*). This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on non-effort and spontaneous presence.

**Analysis:** "Third: supreme abode definite in, yogin distinction generally show" (*gsum pa bla med pa'i gnas nges pa la rnal 'byor gyi dbye ba spyir bstan pa*). This begins the section on yogin qualifications.
From *rang shar*: "Inconceivable yogin also" (*bsam gyis mi khyab rnal 'byor*).
[1894-1908] [CONTEXT] Eight Qualities of a Qualified Vessel

[1944-1958] [CONCEPT] Physical Marks of a Great Completion Vessel
**Analysis:** From the tantra on physical characteristics:
- "Male female two whichever" (*pho mo gnyis ni gang yang rung*)
- "Color this possess, Great Completion vessel speak" (*kha dog 'di dang ldan pa ni / rdzogs pa chen po'i snod du gsungs*)
- "Limbs thick color nose, teeth good white like conch" (*yan lag rags shing kha dog nas / so nyid thags bzangs dkar la 'dril*)

[1991-2005] [CONTEXT] Practice Like a Wandering Yogi
**Analysis:** From *Man ngag rin po che'i 'khor lo* (Precious Instruction Wheel):
- "Enemy friend abandon side in, wandering like manner practice" (*dgra gnyen spangs pa'i phyogs su / sprang po lta bu'i tshul gyis bsgrub*)
"Second: practice like deer, very secluded mountain valley cliff bird-nest possess or forest wilderness or mountain peak or snow shoulder or empty valley great go, three actions abandon practice" (*gnyis pa ri dwags ltar bsgrub pa ni rab tu dben ba'i ri ngogs brag gi bya skyibs can nam nags khrod dam / ri rtse'am / gangs 'dabs sam / lung stong chen por song la bya ba gsum spangs la bsgrub*).
"Also body action trade agriculture sky take move" (*de'ang lus kyi bya ba tshong so nam mkhar len sgul skyod*). "Hand circumambulate etcetera" (*phyag bskor ba la sogs pa*). "Speech expression whatever all" (*ngag gi brjod pa gang ci yang rung ba thams cad*). "Mind spread-gather memory thought different, own instruction contradiction all abandon" (*sems kyi 'phro 'du dran bsam tha dad pa rang gi gdams ngag dang 'gal ba rnams thams cad spangs*). "Instruction supreme one-pointedly not-distracted practice" (*man ngag dam pa gcig pu la rtse gcig tu ma yengs pas bsgrub*).
"Need body slow by channels relaxed, channels relaxed by wind-mind nature relaxed" (*dgos pa ni lus dal bas rtsa dal / rtsa dal bas rlung sems rang bzhin gyis dal*).
[1849-1858] [CONCEPT] Self-Path Purification
**Analysis:** The text discusses purifying the three gates (*sgo gsum*) of defilements (*dri ma*) and the five aggregates (*phung po*) with their dross (*gdos*). "When those pure, below ground-path incidental complete sign dawns" (*de dag dag dus 'og ma'i sa lam zhar la rdzogs pa'i rtags shar*). This expresses the Dzogchen principle that completion of the upper/ultimate level spontaneously completes the lower levels.
"Upper complete by, below incidental complete become, intending, Great Completion one in, training-traverse not need, speak" (*gong ma rdzogs pas 'og ma zhar la rdzogs par 'gyur ba la dgongs nas rdzogs pa chen pos gcig pa la / sbyang bgrod mi dgos par gsung*). This is a key Dzogchen tenet: when the ultimate is realized, the relative paths complete naturally without gradual training.
"Ground one rigpa spontaneously-accomplish. All-do to, not-transform not-train rigpa spontaneously-complete" (*sa gcig ni rig pa lhun grub / kun byed la / ma bsgyur ma sbyangs rig pa lhun rdzogs*). Emphasizes non-effort and spontaneous perfection.

This introduces the section on practitioner qualifications.
From *rang shar*: "Inconceivable yogin also" (*bsam gyis mi khyab rnal 'byor*).

[1991-2005] [CONTEXT] Wandering Yogi Practice
**Analysis:** From *Man ngag rin po che'i 'khor lo*:
- Practice like wandering yogi on side abandoning enemies and friends
- Practice like deer: very secluded mountain valleys, cliffs with bird nests, forests, mountain peaks, snow shoulders, or great empty valleys
- Abandon three actions (body, speech, mind)
- Body: trade, agriculture, sky gazing, movement
- Speech: all expressions
- Mind: abandon spread-gather, different memories/thoughts contradicting own instructions
- Practice supreme instruction one-pointedly without distraction
- Need: body slow relaxes channels, channels relaxed wind-mind nature relaxes
[1849-1858] [CONCEPT] Great Completion Non-Training
**Analysis:** The path purifies three gates' defilements and aggregates with dross. When pure, lower paths complete incidentally. The Great Completion view: upper completion makes lower complete spontaneously without training. Ground is one: rigpa spontaneously accomplished. All activities without transformation or training—rigpa spontaneously complete.
[1859-1908] [STRUCTURE] Yogin Qualifications
**Analysis:** Section on supreme abode with two parts: general yogin distinction and particular vessel-person explanation. Eight qualities required: guru respect, generosity, faith, wisdom, diligence, shame regarding non-virtue, weariness of samsara, devotion to Great Completion. From Thal 'gyur: view-meditation holder needs faith, diligence, generosity, guru respect, vows, shame. Alternative: long slow nature, dull lazy, small concept, slow nature.
[1944-1958] [CONTEXT] Physical Marks
**Analysis:** Great Completion vessel marks: male or female, specific color, thick limbs, conch-white teeth, red eye corners, right-curling black hair, small body-respect, normal outer conduct, forceful words, or words spoken as person speaks.
[1991-2005] [PHILOLOGY] Wandering Yogi

Abandon three actions. Body: trade, agriculture, movement. Speech: all expressions. Mind: abandon contradictory thoughts. Practice supreme instruction one-pointedly. Body slow relaxes channels, channels relaxed makes wind-mind nature relax.
[1849-1858] [CONCEPT] Spontaneous Completion
**Analysis:** Purification of three gates and five aggregates with defilements. Lower paths complete incidentally from upper completion. Great Completion: one ground, no training needed. Rigpa spontaneously accomplished without transformation or training.
[1859-1908] [STRUCTURE] Vessel Qualities
**Analysis:** Supreme abode section: yogin distinction and vessel-person explanation. Eight qualities: guru respect, generosity, faith, wisdom, diligence, shame, samsara weariness, Great Completion devotion. From Thal 'gyur: view-meditation requires faith, diligence, generosity, guru respect, vows, shame. Alternative qualities: slow nature, dull, small concept.
[1944-1958] [CONTEXT] Marks of Vessel
**Analysis:** Physical characteristics: either gender, specific color, thick limbs, white teeth, red eye corners, right-curling black hair, humble body attitude, normal conduct, forceful speech, or speech matching person's words.
[1991-2005] [CONTEXT] Practice Methods
**Analysis:** From Man ngag rin po che'i 'khor lo: wandering yogi practice abandoning friends/enemies. Deer practice in secluded mountains, cliffs, forests, peaks, snows, empty valleys. Abandon body/speech/mind actions. One-pointed practice of supreme instruction. Body relaxation leads to channel relaxation leads to wind-mind relaxation.
[1894-1911] [CONTEXT] Eight Qualities of Vessel
**Analysis:** Eight qualities (*brgyad ldan*): guru respect, great generosity, faith, wisdom, great diligence, shame regarding non-virtue, weariness of cyclic existence, devotion to Great Completion with capacity for practice. From *Thal 'gyur*: view-meditation holder needs excellent faith, diligence, generosity, guru respect, vows, shame regarding sin, unchanging stable holding. Alternative: long slow nature, dull lazy free-flowing, small concept, slow nature, body-speech action free, wisdom possess hold.
[1912-1943] [CONTEXT] Nor Bu 'Phrul Bskod Citation
**Analysis:** From *Nor bu 'phrul bkod chen po'i rgyud*: "Kye ma! Listen divine race, I teach well retain mind" (*kye ma nyon cig lha yi rigs / ngas bstan legs par yid la zung*). "Appearance mandala great this, all teach not do, secret capable some teach" (*snang ba'i dkyil 'khor chen po 'di / kun la bstan par mi bya ste / gsang ba thub pa 'ga' la bstan*). "Secret mantra secret supreme this, teach race thus: secret yearning capable make, secret meaning respect, wisdom intelligence great, samaya vow possess teach" (*gsang sngags gsang ba'i dam pa 'di / bstan pa'i rigs ni 'di lta ste / gsang ba'i gnyer gtad thub par byed / gsang ba'i don la gus pa dang / shes rab blo rtsal che ba dang / dam tshig sdom pa ldan la bstan*). Vajradhara questioned by special retinue: Great Completion instruction secret meaning not self-evident (*rdzogs chen man ngag gsang don 'di / rang gar bstan pa ma yin te*). Definite scripture rgyal khu byug mchog. Person's race, conduct great, color characteristic three asked. Buddha Vajradhara from samadhi arose, special retinue commanded: "Kye ma! Special retinue assembly listen, I teach well listen" (*kye ma khyad par 'khor tshogs nyon / nga yis bstan gyis legs par nyon*). Race distinction thus: royal race and brahmin race, likewise great merchant race, especially great persons, secret mantra definite meaning teach speak.
[1944-1974] [CONTEXT] Physical Characteristics
**Analysis:** Male female two whichever, color this possess, Great Completion vessel speak. Thick limbs color nose, teeth good white conch-like, eye corners mind-just red, hair characteristic great, right curl black color, body respect small, outer conduct normal, words force speak, or word aspect all, one by whatever speak like, person that also like speak, Great Completion instructions speak. These all one in complete, butcher race or prostitute race, sweeper race also suitable, low race whoever is, secret instruction essence this give. Small cause provisions not, own provisions use also, remainder without completely give. Secret essence three instruction this, race color examination methods, I nirvana after, secret instruction essence this, definite king thus teach, those teach person, above instruction teach.
[1975-1990] [STRUCTURE] Two Practice Methods
**Analysis:** Second: how experience-take manner definite, practice manner two: wandering manner practice and deer manner practice. First: own place abandon, other place go, whoever own name good bad, what know not-know etcetera face not-know make, normal pretend, food clothes begging live, cave village little go or secluded or inn etcetera without sign practice. This time own excellence name not-boast, desire not mark. Other guru dharma etcetera hint not do, own instruction faith doubt not mark.
[1944-1958] [CONTEXT] Physical Marks of the Suitable Vessel
**Analysis:** The *Rang Shar* tantra enumerates the physical characteristics marking one as a suitable vessel (*snod*) for Great Perfection teachings. These are not social privileges but somatic indicators of subtle body capacity:
**Physical Marks:**
- Male or female (*pho mo gnyis*)—gender non-specific
- Specific coloration (*kha dog 'di dang ldan pa*) indicating constitutional type
- Thick limbs (*yan lag rags shing*)
- Nose with good coloration (*kha dog*)
- Teeth white like conch (*so nyid thags bzangs dkar la 'dril*)
- Eye corners slightly red (*mig rtsa yid tsam dmar ba*)
- Hair characteristics: curls to the right (*g.yas su 'khyil*), black color (*kham nag mdog*)
- Small body/limited stature (*lus la bkur sti chung ba*)—not imposing presence
- Ordinary external conduct (*phyi yi spyod lam tha mal mdog*)
- Forceful speech (*tshig rnams shugs byung smra ba*) or the ability to mirror others' speech patterns (*gcig gis gang ltar smras pa ltar*)
These marks indicate a constitution capable of sustaining the energetic transformations of Dzogchen practice, not social status.
[1959-1974] [CONCEPT] Caste Irrelevance in Dzogchen Transmission
**Analysis:** When the above qualities are complete (*de rnams gcig la tshang ba na*), social origin becomes irrelevant. Longchenpa lists the lowest castes:
- Butcher caste (*shan pa'i rigs*)
- Prostitute caste (*smad 'tshong rigs*)
- Chāṇḍāla/untouchable caste (*phyags dar khrod pa'i rigs*)
- Any low caste (*rigs ngan gang dag*)
The secret instruction essence (*gsang ba'i man ngag bcud*) is given regardless. The phrase *rgyu chung* (small cause) indicates the practitioner brings minimal resources—using only their own provisions (*rang gi yo byad*) and giving completely without remainder (*lhag ma med par yongs su sbyin*).
The lineage (*rigs*) and color examination methods (*kha dog brtag thabs*) are part of the esoteric transmission. Longchenpa notes that after his parinirvāṇa (*mya ngan 'das 'og tu*), this secret instruction essence (*yang bcud*) will be taught to the definitive king (*nges pa'i rgyal po*)—the qualified practitioner.
[1975-1990] [STRUCTURE] Two Modes of Practice
**Analysis:** The text transitions to the second topic (*don gnyis pa*): how to practice experientially. Two modes (*bsgrub lugs gnyis*):
1. **Wandering Yogi Style** (*sprang po'i tshul*): Abandon own locale, go to other regions. Make it so that no one knows your name, good or bad, what you know or don't know. Pretend to be ordinary. Live by begging for food and clothes. Dwell in caves, villages, secluded places, or inns without obvious signs.
During this time:
- Not boasting of one's qualities (*rang gi yon tan ming ngom pa med*) = mark of few desires (*zhe 'dod med pa'i rtags*)
- Not hinting at others' gurus or dharmas (*gzhan gyi bla ma dang chos la dri brda mi byed*) = mark of confidence and doubtlessness in one's own instructions (*rang gi man ngag la yid ches shing the tshom med pa'i rtags*)
The phrase *de skad du yang* (thus it is said) introduces further scriptural citation.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2017-2050]
Page 39 initiates the third major subdivision (gsum pa) of the conduct section: "the actual meaning of taking into experience" (nyams su blangs pa'i don dngos). This section marks a transition from preparatory conduct discussions to systematic presentation of actual practice modalities. The structural organization follows the canonical fourfold division found in the Nor bu 'phra bkod (lines 2022-2027): conduct-progressive-yogin (spyod pa rgyun gyi rnal 'byor), meditation-progressive-yogin (sgom pa rgyun gyi rnal 'byor), view-progressive-yogin (lta ba rgyun gyi rnal 'byor), and result-progressive-yogin ('bras bu rgyun gyi rnal 'byor). This tetradic structure reflects the standard soteriological progression in Tibetan Buddhist doxography.
The page is framed by two scriptural citations: the Man ngag rin po che'i 'khor lo (lines 1991-1994) at the opening and the Thal 'gyur (lines 2011-2016) toward the close. Between these citations, Longchenpa presents the "deer-like accomplishment" (ri dwags ltar bsgrub pa) as the second of two conduct modalities, following the "beggar-like accomplishment" (sprang po lta bu'i tshul) discussed in the preceding section.
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: sprang po] - Wylie: sprang po. Technical term referring to an ascetic beggar or wandering renunciant. In the context of Tibetan religious practice, this denotes the lifestyle of total dependence on alms, without fixed abode. The term carries connotations of authentic spiritual poverty rather than mere material deprivation. Philologically related to sprang (to beg, request alms).
[TERM: dben ba] - Wylie: dben ba. Etymologically derived from the verb dben pa (to be empty, secluded). In Buddhist technical vocabulary, denotes physical and mental solitude, the foundational condition for advanced meditation. The intensifier rab tu (greatly, thoroughly) compounds this to indicate total withdrawal from social and sensory engagement.
[TERM: yengs pa] - Wylie: yengs pa. Verb meaning to be distracted, dispersed, scattered. The negative construction ma yengs pa (undistracted) is a technical descriptor of proper meditative absorption. The causative form yengs su gzhug (to cause distraction) appears in instructions for cutting through dullness.
[TERM: rtse gcig] - Wylie: rtse gcig. Literally "one-pointed," "one peak." A central technical term in Tibetan meditation theory denoting single-pointed concentration. The phrase rtse gcig tu (in a one-pointed manner) modifies the verbal action of practice.
[PARTICLE ANALYSIS: -ng] - The instrumental particle -ng (often reduced to -s or -ng in orthography) appears frequently: dben ba'i (genitive), lta bu'i (genitive of comparison), spyod pa'i (genitive). These genitive constructions establish relationships between conduct types and their defining characteristics.
[TERM: gdams ngag] - Wylie: gdams ngag. Literally "sacred word of advice" or "personal instruction." In the Nyingma tradition, this refers to the pith oral teachings transmitted from guru to disciple, distinguished from general scriptural teachings (lung). The term appears with the honorific dam pa (sacred, sublime).
[TERM: rlung sems] - Wylie: rlung sems. Compound technical term combining prana/wind (rlung; Skt. prana) and mind (sems; Skt. citta). This denotes the subtle wind-mind continuum central to tantric physiology and Dzogchen practice. The compound functions as a singular concept in Tibetan Buddhist subtle body theory.
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Man ngag rin po che'i 'khor lo] - "From the Precious Wheel of Instructions: In the direction of abandoned enemy and friend, accomplish with beggar-like manner." This citation establishes the scriptural authority for the beggar conduct modality. The text is classified among the Nyingma tantric corpus, though specific textual identification requires further philological investigation.
[CITATION: Thal 'gyur] - "By possessing faith and separating from samsara's mind, one should offer worship to the guru and give. Having abandoned all samsara's connections, one should dwell alone, abandoning companions." This citation from the Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Result) tantra emphasizes the prerequisites for authentic practice: faith (dad ldan), separation from samsara ('khor ba'i yid bral ba), and solitude (grogs spangs gcig pur gnas pa).
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Nyingma-Sarma Distinction] - The page exhibits characteristic Nyingma organizational structures. The fourfold division of yogic practice (conduct, meditation, view, result) appears in Sarma presentations but is here integrated with specifically Nyingma terminological preferences. The emphasis on "own instructions" (rang gi gdams ngag) rather than received textual authority reflects the Nyingma emphasis on direct transmission lineages. The citation from the Nor bu 'phra bkod—a Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class—exemplifies this textual preference.
[CONCEPTUAL MAPPING: Deer Conduct Parameters] - The page establishes seven environmental parameters for deer-like retreat practice: (1) mountain-side rock with bird-shelter (ri ngogs brag gi bya skyibs can), (2) forest grove (nags khrod), (3) mountain peak (ri rtse), (4) snow slope (gangs 'dabs), (5) great empty valley (lung stong chen po), with the abandonment of three actions (bya ba gsum spangs). This typology of solitary locations reflects the standard Tibetan reclusive taxonomy found across retreat manuals (sgrub yig).
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Threefold Abandonment Mechanism] - The text presents a hierarchical causal chain: body relaxed (lus dal bas) → channels relaxed (rtsa dal bas) → wind-mind naturally relaxed (rlung sems rang bzhin gyis dal) → thought-force ceases (rnam rtog shugs kyis 'gag cing) → non-thought samadhi arises (mi rtog pa'i ting nge 'dzin rgyud la skye'o). This represents the Dzogchen presentation of progressive physiological and mental pacification, distinct from sutra-based gradualist approaches.
The fourfold causal progression operates through the following mechanism: (1) Physical relaxation of the body eliminates coarse physical tension; (2) Channel relaxation follows as the nadis (subtle channels) are no longer constricted by physical holding patterns; (3) Wind-mind relaxation occurs naturally (rang bzhin gyis) as the pranic currents flow unimpeded; (4) Thought-force naturally ceases without suppression. This results in the arising of non-conceptual samadhi (ting nge 'dzin; Skt. samadhi).
[ANALYSIS: Speech and Mind Relaxed] - Parallel structures govern speech and mind: (1) Speech relaxed (ngag dal bas) → inexpressible meaning arises in the mindstream (brjod du med pa'i don rgyud la skye); (2) Mind's memory discards emanation-gathering (sems kyi dran pas 'phro 'du spangs pas) → samadhi arises in its own manner (ting nge 'dzin rang lugs su skye ba). The "inexpressible meaning" (brjod du med pa'i don) corresponds to the ineffable nature of realization in Dzogchen discourse.
[LIST ANALYSIS: Progressive Yogin Categories] - The four categories of progressive yogin establish a comprehensive framework:
1. Spyod pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor - Conduct-progressive-yogin: emphasis on behavioral transformation
2. Sgom pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor - Meditation-progressive-yogin: emphasis on meditative stabilization
3. Lta ba la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor - View-progressive-yogin: emphasis on cognitive understanding
4. 'Bras bu la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor - Result-progressive-yogin: emphasis on actualization of fruition
Each category receives extensive treatment in subsequent pages, with the present page establishing the structural framework. The term rgyun du byed pa (doing continuously, progressive doing) indicates that these are not static attainments but ongoing processes of cultivation.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2051-2074]
Page 40 presents the detailed exposition of conduct-progressive-yogin (spyod pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor), the first of the four categories established in the previous page. The structural organization follows a fourfold division (lines 2051-2055):
1. Appearance-power-transform conduct (snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa)
2. Instruction: appearance direct-placement method (de'i man ngag snang ba cer bzhag gi thabs)
3. Ground-rise intention of appearance-existence (de las snang srid gzhi bzhengs kyi dgongs pa)
4. Fruit of affliction-ground-transformation (nyon mongs pa gnas bsgyur gyi 'bras bu)
This tetrad reflects the standard Tibetan Buddhist pedagogical structure: ground (gzhi), path (lam), and fruit ('bras bu), with the "instruction" (man ngag) serving as the essential method connecting ground and fruit.
The page opens with an extensive citation from the Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud (Jewel-Heap Tantra; lines 2029-2050), comprising twenty-two verses that establish the theoretical foundation for conduct practice. This is followed by the threefold subdivision of the first topic (lines 2056-2064).
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: snang ba] - Wylie: snang ba. Primary Dzogchen technical term denoting "appearance" or "manifestation." In contrast to the Sarma schools' emphasis on emptiness (stong pa nyid), Nyingma Dzogchen privileges appearance as the self-display of awareness (rig pa). The term appears in compound forms: snang srid (appearance-existence), snang ba dbang bsgyur (appearance power-transform).
[TERM: cer bzhag] - Wylie: cer bzhag. Critical Dzogchen technical term variously translated as "direct placement," "naked placement," or "immediate resting." The first syllable cer (naked, direct, immediate) emphasizes non-artificiality. The second syllable bzhag (to place, set, establish) denotes the method of allowing awareness to rest in its natural state without modification. This term distinguishes Dzogchen meditation from structured tantric visualization practices.
[TERM: gzhi bzhengs] - Wylie: gzhi bzhengs. Compound meaning "ground-rise" or "basis-establishment." Technical term in Dzogchen cosmology and epistemology denoting how the ground (gzhi) manifests as the various appearances of samsara and nirvana. The verb bzhengs (to rise, to emerge) implies spontaneous emergence rather than causal production.
[TERM: gnas bsgyur] - Wylie: gnas bsgyur. Compound technical term meaning "ground-transformation" or "basis-transformation." In Dzogchen, this refers to the alchemical process whereby the basis (gnas; Skt. ashraya) of delusion—afflictions and conceptual mind—is transformed into wisdom. Distinct from the Sarma concept of "path purification," Dzogchen emphasizes the transformation of the basis itself.
[TERM: khrigs chags] - Wylie: khrigs chags. Compound meaning "orderly arrangement" or "systematic structure." In the citation from the Jewel-Heap Tantra (line 2031), this refers to the systematic approach to experience-taking. The term carries connotations of proper ordering and methodical progression.
[TERM: spyod pa spyi'i ngo bo] - Wylie: spyod pa spyi'i ngo bo. "General essence of conduct." Technical doxographical phrase indicating the presentation of conduct from the perspective of all vehicles (theg pa), establishing common features before differentiating specific approaches. This reflects the standard Tibetan hermeneutical method of moving from the general (spyi) to the specific (bye brag).
[TERM: gsang chen] - Wylie: gsang chen. "Great Secret." Standard designation for the Vajrayana, particularly the higher tantras. In Nyingma classification, this refers specifically to Mahayoga and Anuyoga, as distinct from Atiyoga (Dzogchen).
[PARTICLE ANALYSIS: gi/gyi] - The instrumental/genitive particle appears in various forms: gyi (after final -g), gyis (instrumental), kyi (after final -g, -ng). In line 2052: snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa—here gyi functions as a genitive linking "appearance-power-transform" to "conduct."
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud] - The Jewel-Heap Tantra citation (lines 2029-2050) presents a comprehensive outline of the conduct system:
- Progressive distinction (de rim bye brag)
- Four owners' manner (bdag po bzhi yi tshul)
- Four meaning essences (don gyi ngo bo bzhi)
- Four domain knowledges (yul rig rnam bzhi)
- Cutting the birth-continuum of appearances (snang ba'i skye rgyun gcod)
- Four placement methods (bzhag thabs man ngag rnam bzhi)
- Self-release of appearance-existence dharmas (snang srid chos rnams rang phyen bya)
- Four pure manner liberation piths (dag lugs grol ba'i gnad bzhi)
- Self-power transformation of afflictions (nyon mongs rnams la rang dbang bsgyur)
This elaborate structure demonstrates the systematic nature of Nyingma conduct theory. The twenty enumerated meanings (don nyi shu) mentioned in line 2028 receive detailed treatment in subsequent pages.
[CITATION: Rang shar] - "From Self-Arisen" (rang shar las)—the citation in lines 2067-2072 references a Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class. The quoted passage distinguishes characteristic vehicle conduct from the conduct of the Great Perfection: "Not-attach hold conduct is characteristic vehicle conduct, great attach meaning bind, method not liberate how become." This establishes the critique of sutra-based gradualism from the Dzogchen perspective.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Three Vehicle Classification] - The page presents a tri-level doxographical hierarchy:
1. Characteristic Vehicle (mtshan nyid kyi theg pa) - Sutra-based gradual conduct
2. Mantra General (gsang sngags spyi'i spyod pa) - Outer/inner tantric conduct
3. Great Perfection Spontaneous Accomplishment (rdzogs pa chen po lhun gyis grub pa'i spyod pa) - Atiyoga conduct
This threefold structure appears across Nyingma literature as the standard vehicle (theg pa) classification within the outer/inner division of the dharma.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Three Conduct Categories] - Lines 2061-2063 establish the typology of conduct:
1. Ma chags 'dzin pa'i spyod pa - Not-attach hold conduct: conduct without fixation or grasping
2. Dgag sgrub med pa'i spyod pa - Negate-affirm not conduct: conduct without rejection or acceptance
3. Chags la zhen med kyi spyod pa - Attach not-cling conduct: conduct with engagement but without attachment
This tripartite classification reflects the Dzogchen integration of engagement (not withdrawal) with non-attachment. The first category represents basic non-fixation; the second represents transcending the duality of acceptance/rejection; the third represents the highest level of engaged non-attachment.
[ANALYSIS: Progressive Conduct Framework] - The page establishes a comprehensive framework linking conduct (spyod pa), instruction (man ngag), intention (dgongs pa), and fruit ('bras bu). This represents the Nyingma understanding that conduct is not merely behavioral ethics but a complete transformative system:
Conduct establishes the behavioral foundation → Instruction provides the method → Intention reveals the aim → Fruit actualizes the transformation
This framework distinguishes Nyingma conduct theory from both sutra-based ethics (which lacks tantric method) and Sarma tantra (which emphasizes deity yoga over appearance transformation).
[ANALYSIS: The Four Owners] - The Jewel-Heap citation references "four owners" (bdag po bzhi). In Nyingma doxography, these typically correspond to:
1. The deity (lha) or yidam as the owner of enlightened appearance
2. The guru (bla ma) as the owner of transmission
3. The dakini (mkha' 'gro ma) as the owner of activity
4. The dharma protector (chos skyong) as the owner of obstacles
However, the specific identification of the four owners in this context requires examination of the full Jewel-Heap commentary tradition.
[ANALYSIS: Self-Power Transformation] - The phrase rang dbang bsgyur (self-power transform) in line 2039 indicates that the transformation of afflictions occurs through the yogin's own capacity rather than through external intervention. This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on self-liberation (rang grol) as opposed to liberation dependent on external conditions.
The page establishes that authentic conduct in the Great Perfection requires: (1) suitable ground (gnas), (2) proper method (thabs), (3) continuous practice (rgyun du byed pa), and (4) recognition of the fourfold result ('bras bu). This systematic presentation provides the foundation for the detailed conduct instructions that follow.
