[SA BCAD: 2051-2074]
Page 40 presents the detailed exposition of conduct-progressive-yogin (spyod pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor), the first of the four categories established in the previous page. The structural organization follows a fourfold division (lines 2051-2055):
1. Appearance-power-transform conduct (snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa)
2. Instruction: appearance direct-placement method (de'i man ngag snang ba cer bzhag gi thabs)
3. Ground-rise intention of appearance-existence (de las snang srid gzhi bzhengs kyi dgongs pa)
4. Fruit of affliction-ground-transformation (nyon mongs pa gnas bsgyur gyi 'bras bu)
This tetrad reflects the standard Tibetan Buddhist pedagogical structure: ground (gzhi), path (lam), and fruit ('bras bu), with the "instruction" (man ngag) serving as the essential method connecting ground and fruit.
The page opens with an extensive citation from the Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud (Jewel-Heap Tantra; lines 2029-2050), comprising twenty-two verses that establish the theoretical foundation for conduct practice. This is followed by the threefold subdivision of the first topic (lines 2056-2064).
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: snang ba] - Wylie: snang ba. Primary Dzogchen technical term denoting "appearance" or "manifestation." In contrast to the Sarma schools' emphasis on emptiness (stong pa nyid), Nyingma Dzogchen privileges appearance as the self-display of awareness (rig pa). The term appears in compound forms: snang srid (appearance-existence), snang ba dbang bsgyur (appearance power-transform).
[TERM: cer bzhag] - Wylie: cer bzhag. Critical Dzogchen technical term variously translated as "direct placement," "naked placement," or "immediate resting." The first syllable cer (naked, direct, immediate) emphasizes non-artificiality. The second syllable bzhag (to place, set, establish) denotes the method of allowing awareness to rest in its natural state without modification. This term distinguishes Dzogchen meditation from structured tantric visualization practices.
[TERM: gzhi bzhengs] - Wylie: gzhi bzhengs. Compound meaning "ground-rise" or "basis-establishment." Technical term in Dzogchen cosmology and epistemology denoting how the ground (gzhi) manifests as the various appearances of samsara and nirvana. The verb bzhengs (to rise, to emerge) implies spontaneous emergence rather than causal production.
[TERM: gnas bsgyur] - Wylie: gnas bsgyur. Compound technical term meaning "ground-transformation" or "basis-transformation." In Dzogchen, this refers to the alchemical process whereby the basis (gnas; Skt. ashraya) of delusion—afflictions and conceptual mind—is transformed into wisdom. Distinct from the Sarma concept of "path purification," Dzogchen emphasizes the transformation of the basis itself.
[TERM: khrigs chags] - Wylie: khrigs chags. Compound meaning "orderly arrangement" or "systematic structure." In the citation from the Jewel-Heap Tantra (line 2031), this refers to the systematic approach to experience-taking. The term carries connotations of proper ordering and methodical progression.
[TERM: spyod pa spyi'i ngo bo] - Wylie: spyod pa spyi'i ngo bo. "General essence of conduct." Technical doxographical phrase indicating the presentation of conduct from the perspective of all vehicles (theg pa), establishing common features before differentiating specific approaches. This reflects the standard Tibetan hermeneutical method of moving from the general (spyi) to the specific (bye brag).
[TERM: gsang chen] - Wylie: gsang chen. "Great Secret." Standard designation for the Vajrayana, particularly the higher tantras. In Nyingma classification, this refers specifically to Mahayoga and Anuyoga, as distinct from Atiyoga (Dzogchen).
[PARTICLE ANALYSIS: gi/gyi] - The instrumental/genitive particle appears in various forms: gyi (after final -g), gyis (instrumental), kyi (after final -g, -ng). In line 2052: snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa—here gyi functions as a genitive linking "appearance-power-transform" to "conduct."
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud] - The Jewel-Heap Tantra citation (lines 2029-2050) presents a comprehensive outline of the conduct system:
- Progressive distinction (de rim bye brag)
- Four owners' manner (bdag po bzhi yi tshul)
- Four meaning essences (don gyi ngo bo bzhi)
- Four domain knowledges (yul rig rnam bzhi)
- Cutting the birth-continuum of appearances (snang ba'i skye rgyun gcod)
- Four placement methods (bzhag thabs man ngag rnam bzhi)
- Self-release of appearance-existence dharmas (snang srid chos rnams rang phyen bya)
- Four pure manner liberation piths (dag lugs grol ba'i gnad bzhi)
- Self-power transformation of afflictions (nyon mongs rnams la rang dbang bsgyur)
This elaborate structure demonstrates the systematic nature of Nyingma conduct theory. The twenty enumerated meanings (don nyi shu) mentioned in line 2028 receive detailed treatment in subsequent pages.
[CITATION: Rang shar] - "From Self-Arisen" (rang shar las)—the citation in lines 2067-2072 references a Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class. The quoted passage distinguishes characteristic vehicle conduct from the conduct of the Great Perfection: "Not-attach hold conduct is characteristic vehicle conduct, great attach meaning bind, method not liberate how become." This establishes the critique of sutra-based gradualism from the Dzogchen perspective.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Three Vehicle Classification] - The page presents a tri-level doxographical hierarchy:
1. Characteristic Vehicle (mtshan nyid kyi theg pa) - Sutra-based gradual conduct
2. Mantra General (gsang sngags spyi'i spyod pa) - Outer/inner tantric conduct
3. Great Perfection Spontaneous Accomplishment (rdzogs pa chen po lhun gyis grub pa'i spyod pa) - Atiyoga conduct
This threefold structure appears across Nyingma literature as the standard vehicle (theg pa) classification within the outer/inner division of the dharma.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Three Conduct Categories] - Lines 2061-2063 establish the typology of conduct:
1. Ma chags 'dzin pa'i spyod pa - Not-attach hold conduct: conduct without fixation or grasping
2. Dgag sgrub med pa'i spyod pa - Negate-affirm not conduct: conduct without rejection or acceptance
3. Chags la zhen med kyi spyod pa - Attach not-cling conduct: conduct with engagement but without attachment
This tripartite classification reflects the Dzogchen integration of engagement (not withdrawal) with non-attachment. The first category represents basic non-fixation; the second represents transcending the duality of acceptance/rejection; the third represents the highest level of engaged non-attachment.
[ANALYSIS: Progressive Conduct Framework] - The page establishes a comprehensive framework linking conduct (spyod pa), instruction (man ngag), intention (dgongs pa), and fruit ('bras bu). This represents the Nyingma understanding that conduct is not merely behavioral ethics but a complete transformative system:
Conduct establishes the behavioral foundation → Instruction provides the method → Intention reveals the aim → Fruit actualizes the transformation
This framework distinguishes Nyingma conduct theory from both sutra-based ethics (which lacks tantric method) and Sarma tantra (which emphasizes deity yoga over appearance transformation).
[ANALYSIS: The Four Owners] - The Jewel-Heap citation references "four owners" (bdag po bzhi). In Nyingma doxography, these typically correspond to:
1. The deity (lha) or yidam as the owner of enlightened appearance
2. The guru (bla ma) as the owner of transmission
3. The dakini (mkha' 'gro ma) as the owner of activity
4. The dharma protector (chos skyong) as the owner of obstacles
However, the specific identification of the four owners in this context requires examination of the full Jewel-Heap commentary tradition.
[ANALYSIS: Self-Power Transformation] - The phrase rang dbang bsgyur (self-power transform) in line 2039 indicates that the transformation of afflictions occurs through the yogin's own capacity rather than through external intervention. This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on self-liberation (rang grol) as opposed to liberation dependent on external conditions.
The page establishes that authentic conduct in the Great Perfection requires: (1) suitable ground (gnas), (2) proper method (thabs), (3) continuous practice (rgyun du byed pa), and (4) recognition of the fourfold result ('bras bu). This systematic presentation provides the foundation for the detailed conduct instructions that follow.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2075-2146]
Page 41 presents the detailed exposition of the third category of conduct: Great Perfection spontaneous accomplishment conduct (rdzogs pa chen po lhun gyis grub pa'i spyod pa; lines 2087-2096). This section is pivotal as it transitions from the conduct of lower vehicles to the distinctive Atiyoga approach. The page then moves to the second major subdivision: extensive explanation of secret great definite conduct (gsang chen nges pa'i spyod pa rgyas par bshad pa; lines 2097-2146).
This second subdivision bifurcates into:
1. Extensive explanation of the nature of twenty-one conducts (spyod pa nyi shu rtsa gcig gi rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa; lines 2097-2145)
2. Progressive of doing vajra song dance (rdo rje'i glu gar bya ba'i rim pa; line 2099)
The twenty-one conducts section opens with an extensive citation from the Nyi zla kha sbyor gyi rgyud (Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra; lines 2100-2145), presenting eleven animal-based conduct metaphors. The structural progression moves from naturalistic metaphors (bee, deer) through behavioral modifications (mute, madman) to the culmination in fearlessness (lion).
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: lhun gyis grub pa] - Wylie: lhun gyis grub pa. "Spontaneously accomplished" or "naturally perfected." Critical Dzogchen technical term denoting that enlightenment is not produced through effort but naturally present. The term lhun (spontaneously, naturally, effortlessly) distinguishes Dzogchen from all graduated paths requiring deliberate cultivation. Related to the Dzogchen triad: ka dag (primordial purity), lhun grub (spontaneous presence), and thugs rje (compassionate responsiveness).
[TERM: gshis la blang dor 'dzin rtsol med pa] - Wylie: gshis la blang dor 'dzin rtsol med pa. "In the nature (gshis), without acceptance-rejection holding-effort." Complex technical phrase encapsulating the Dzogchen view: the natural state (gshis) is beyond the dualistic activities of accepting (blang) or rejecting (dor), beyond holding ('dzin) or effort (rtsol). This phrase serves as a concise definition of Dzogchen conduct.
[TERM: ye grol ye spyod] - Wylie: ye grol ye spyod. "Primordially liberated, primordial conduct." Technical compound indicating conduct that is not adopted but naturally manifest from the recognition of primordial liberation. The prefix ye- (primordial) negates any notion of temporal development or acquisition.
[TERM: byar med byas med] - Wylie: byar med byas med. "Nothing to do, nothing done." Famous Dzogchen negational formula from the Rang shar (Self-Arisen) citation (lines 2093-2096). This binary negation eliminates both the possibility of action (bya ba) and the completion of action (byas pa), establishing the transcendence of karma and deliberate practice.
[TERM: 'gro med 'ong med gnas pa med] - Wylie: 'gro med 'ong med gnas pa med. "No going, no coming, no abiding." Tripartite negation eliminating the three modes of temporal movement. This formula appears in Prajnaparamita literature and is here integrated into Dzogchen conduct theory to indicate the transcendence of all conventional directional and temporal categories.
[TERM: nyi zla kha sbyor] - Wylie: nyi zla kha sbyor. "Sun-Moon Mouth-Join." Title of a Nyingma tantra in the Anuyoga class. The imagery of sun and moon joining represents the union of method (thabs; male, sun) and wisdom (shes rab; female, moon). The tantra is cited extensively as an authoritative source for conduct instructions.
[ANIMAL CONDUCT TERMS] - The page presents eleven animal-metaphor conducts:
1. Bung ba (bee) - enjoying all dharmas' taste
2. Ri dwags (deer/musk deer) - abandoning delusion conditions
3. Lkugs pa (mute) - abandoning delusion speech
4. Thi bya (peacock) - cutting secret mantra doubt
5. Smyon pa (madman) - abandoning single-dwelling objects
6. Seng ge (lion) - abandoning fear mind, going charnel-ground
7. Khyi phag (dog-pig) - abandoning pure-impure thought
8. Ldom bu (cloud) - experiencing memory thought instant
9. Bu chung (child) - abandoning long delusion clinging
10. Rnga mo (echo) - guiding world-appropriate words
11. Glang chen (elephant) - turning depth samsara battles
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Rang shar (Self-Arisen)] - Lines 2090-2096 cite from the Rang shar, a major Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class. The citation establishes the four negations defining Dzogchen conduct:
- Byar med (nothing to do)
- Byas med (nothing done)
- Byung sa med (no arising ground)
- 'Gro med (no going)
- 'Ong med (no coming)
- Gnas pa med (no abiding)
- Chags pa med (no attachment)
- Zhen pa med (no clinging)
This eightfold negation encapsulates the Dzogchen transcendence of all dualistic categories of action and location.
[CITATION: Nyi zla kha sbyor gyi rgyud] - The Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra provides the primary scriptural source for the twenty-one conducts. The citation structure (lines 2100-2145) presents a systematic typology of conduct metaphors, each pairing an animal with a specific behavioral modification and spiritual benefit. This reflects the tantric pedagogical method of using accessible natural imagery to point to subtle internal transformations.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Atiyoga Conduct Distinction] - The page explicitly contrasts Atiyoga conduct with lower vehicles (lines 2087-2096). The characteristic vehicle conducts operate through acceptance-rejection ('dzin rtsol); the mantra general conducts operate through method with effort (thabs yod kyang rtsol sgrub); the Atiyoga conduct operates through accordance with the natural state itself (gshis la... de nyid dang mthun par). This triadic structure reflects the standard Nyingma vehicle classification.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Animal Metaphor System] - The twenty-one conducts employ zoomorphic metaphors that function on multiple levels:
1. NATURALISTIC LEVEL: Each animal represents specific behavioral characteristics observable in nature (bees gathering nectar, deer fleeing hunters, lions fearless).
2. PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL: The animal behaviors map onto mental states (bee = enjoyment, deer = avoidance of samsara, mute = silence, madman = spontaneity).
3. TRANSFORMATIVE LEVEL: Each metaphor indicates a specific transformation: enjoyment without clinging (bee), abandonment of conditions (deer), cutting conceptual proliferation (mute), transcending social convention (madman), fearlessness (lion).
4. HIERARCHICAL LEVEL: The sequence progresses from naturalistic behaviors (bee, deer) through social transgression (madman) to the culmination of mastery (lion).
[ANALYSIS: Peacock Conduct] - The thi bya (peacock) conduct (line 2107-2108) exemplifies the tantric principle of transformation: "by peacock like conduct, cut secret mantra doubt." The peacock in Indian symbolism consumes poison and transforms it into beautiful plumage. This represents the advanced tantric capacity to transform afflictions (nyon mongs) into wisdom without rejection.
[ANALYSIS: Madman Conduct] - The smyon pa (madman) conduct (lines 2109-2110) represents the transgressive aspect of tantric practice: "abandon one-dwelling objects." This indicates transcendence of fixed abode, social convention, and predictable behavior patterns. In Tibetan religious history, the "holy madman" (smyon pa) tradition represents the visible manifestation of this principle.
[ANALYSIS: Dog-Pig Conduct] - The khyi phag (dog-pig) conduct (lines 2113-2114) addresses the pure-impure dichotomy: "abandon pure impure thought." Dogs and pigs in traditional South Asian culture represent the lowest, most impure animals. By emulating their disregard for purity distinctions, the practitioner transcends the attachment to ritual purity that characterizes lower vehicles.
[ANALYSIS: Conduct Typology Structure] - The twenty-one conducts are organized into functional groups:
- SENSORY TRANSFORMATION: bee (taste), echo (sound)
- AVOIDANCE/SOLITUDE: deer, mute, child
- TRANSCENDENCE OF DICHOTOMIES: peacock (poison/wisdom), dog-pig (pure/impure), madman (convention/spontaneity)
- POWER/MASTERY: lion (fearlessness), elephant (samsara battles), mountain (unchanging)
This systematic organization reflects the comprehensive nature of Nyingma conduct theory, addressing every aspect of human experience and spiritual development.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2123-2168]
Page 42 completes the twenty-one conducts section with the remaining animal metaphors (lines 2123-2145) and transitions to the detailed exposition of vajra song and dance (rdo rje'i glu gar; lines 2147-2168). The structural organization follows the threefold division established in the previous page:
1. Time of song dance (glu gar gyi dus; line 2148)
2. Song dance actual (glu gar dngos; line 2149)
3. Song dance benefit (glu gar gyi phan yon; line 2150)
The twenty-one conducts conclude with eleven additional animal metaphors, bringing the total to twenty-two enumerated forms (lines 2146 note: "though twenty-two enumeration exist, although two deer like conduct gather as one—explain as twenty-one"). This numerical adjustment reflects the organic development of the conduct system rather than rigid categorical imposition.
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: ru shan] - Wylie: ru shan. Technical term meaning "boundary," "dividing line," or "demarcation." In the phrase 'khor 'das ru shan (samsara-nirvana boundary), this denotes the conceptual and experiential divide between cyclic existence and liberation. The boundary-divide conduct ('khor 'das ru shan 'byed pa'i spyod pa) represents the advanced capacity to distinguish without dualistic fixation.
[TERM: tshogs] - Wylie: tshogs. In tantric context, denotes the "accumulation" of merit and wisdom (bsod nams dang ye shes kyi tshogs). In the context of song dance timing (line 2153), this refers to the preliminary practice phase of tantric ritual.
[TERM: dbang bskur] - Wylie: dbang bskur. "Empowerment" or "initiation." The standard Tibetan translation for Sanskrit abhisheka. The term appears in the context of five pure times (rnam lnga dag pa'i tshe) for vajra song practice.
[TERM: dkyil 'khor] - Wylie: dkyil 'khor. "Mandala" or "circle." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit mandala. In the context of song dance, this refers to the creation and visualization of the mandala as a context for practice.
[TERM: ting nge 'dzin] - Wylie: ting nge 'dzin. "Samadhi" or "meditative absorption." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit samadhi. The compound indicates deep meditative stabilization, distinct from ordinary concentration.
[TERM: rnal 'byor] - Wylie: rnal 'byor. "Yogin" or "practitioner." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit yogin. In Nyingma contexts, this specifically denotes tantric practitioners who have received empowerment and engage in the two stages (bskyed rim, rdzogs rim) or Dzogchen practices.
[TERM: skal ldan] - Wylie: skal ldan. "Fortune-possessor" or "suitable vessel." Technical term indicating a practitioner who possesses the karmic fortune (skal ba) to encounter and successfully practice the dharma. The term combines skal (portion, fortune) with ldan (possessing).
[ANIMAL CONDUCT TERMS - CONTINUED] - The page completes the twenty-one conducts:
12. Ri dwags (deer) - abandon son-enemy concept
13. Rgya mo (tortoise) - decide desire content time
14. Dred mo (bear) - not spread samsara seed
15. Bram ze (brahmin) - abandon other enjoy food
16. Dpa' mo (heroine/dakini) - divide samsara-nirvana boundary
17. Chu yig (water-letter) - place memory support self-place
18. Nam mkha'i mdung skor (sky-dagger) - completely use phenomena
19. Bar snang rlung 'dra (mid-air wind-like) - abandon grasp hold thought
20. Bya khyung (garuda) - cut abyss waves
21. Ri bo (mountain) - above use unchanging self-pure
22. Thog chen (thunder) - use appearance outward not-turn
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Nyi zla kha sbyor - Song Dance Section] - Lines 2156-2168 cite the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra on the vajra song practice. The passage describes five specific occasions for vajra song:
1. Time of samsara-nirvana boundary-divide conduct
2. Accumulation (tshogs)
3. Empowerment (dbang bskur)
4. Mandala accomplishment time
5. Samadhi upward-spread time
These five pure times (rnam lnga dag pa'i tshe) represent formal ritual contexts where vajra song serves as an auxiliary practice. The instruction emphasizes secrecy: "ordinary not-see, secret do" (tha mal pas ma mthong bar gsangs te bya ba).
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Conduct Numerology] - The explanation in line 2146 clarifies the enumeration: though twenty-two forms are mentioned (rnam grangs nyer gnyis yod kyang), two deer-like conducts are gathered as one (ri dwags lta bu'i spyod pa gnyis gcig tu phyogs sdebs pas), resulting in the standard enumeration of twenty-one (nyer gcig tu bshad do). This reflects the organic, non-rigid nature of tantric categorical systems.
[RITUAL CONTEXT: Vajra Song] - The vajra song (rdo rje'i glu) represents a distinctive Nyingma practice form combining vocalization (glu) with movement (gar). Unlike ordinary singing, vajra song is non-conceptual (mi rtog) and serves as a support for meditative stabilization (bsam gtan gnas pa'i grogs). The practice is specifically associated with charnel-ground (dur khrod) retreat contexts.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Tortoise Conduct] - The rgya mo (tortoise) conduct (lines 2125-2126) exemplifies contentment: "decide desire content time" ('dod pa'i chog shes dus tshod bcad). The tortoise withdraws into its shell, representing the practitioner's withdrawal from external desire-objects while remaining content. This reflects the paramita of contentment (chog shes) integrated into tantric conduct.
[ANALYSIS: Bear Conduct] - The dred mo (bear) conduct (lines 2127-2128) addresses karmic propagation: "not spread samsara seed" ('khor ba'i sa bon spel mi bya). The bear hibernates, representing cessation of activity that produces karmic seeds (sa bon; Skt. bija). This conduct emphasizes non-action as the cessation of samsaric perpetuation.
[ANALYSIS: Brahmin Conduct] - The bram ze (brahmin) conduct (lines 2129-2130) addresses sustenance ethics: "abandon other enjoy food" (gzhan gyi longs spyod zas rnams spang). This represents the abandonment of food and enjoyments obtained through exploiting others, reflecting the ethical dimension of tantric conduct.
[ANALYSIS: Heroine/Dakini Conduct] - The dpa' mo (heroine) conduct (lines 2131-2132) addresses the samsara-nirvana relation: "divide samsara-nirvana boundary" ('khor 'das rnams kyi ru shan dbye). The feminine dpa' mo (Skt. virya, dakini) represents dynamic wisdom that cuts through the apparent dichotomy between cyclic existence and liberation.
[ANALYSIS: Water-Letter Conduct] - The chu yig (water-letter) conduct (lines 2133-2134) addresses memory support: "place memory support self-place" (dran pa'i rten nyid rang sar gzhag). The water-letter represents fluid, non-grasping mindfulness that requires no external support but rests in its own place (rang sar gzhag).
[ANALYSIS: Sky-Dagger Conduct] - The nam mkha'i mdung skor (sky-dagger) conduct (lines 2135-2136) represents complete utilization: "completely use phenomena" (dngos po rnams la zang thal spyad). The phurba (mdung skor) ritual dagger represents the ability to penetrate and completely engage with all phenomena without obstruction.
[ANALYSIS: Thunder Conduct] - The thog chen (great thunder) conduct (lines 2143-2144) represents unidirectional application: "use appearance outward not-turn" (snang ba phyir mi ldog par spyad). Thunder travels in one direction without returning, representing the irreversible application of wisdom toward liberation without regression.
[ANALYSIS: Vajra Song Pedagogy] - The song dance section (lines 2147-2168) presents vajra song as a method that:
1. Precedes all conduct (spyod pa kun gyi sngon du 'gro)
2. Supports non-conceptual meditation (mi rtog bsam gtan gnas pa'i grogs)
3. Captures dakini minds (mkha' 'gro ma yi yid rnams 'phrog)
4. Turns six-type samsara clinging (rigs drug 'khor ba'i zhen pa bzlog)
The practice requires reliance on the non-conceptual mind (mi rtog rgyud la bsten dus su) and should be taken as the occasion ('di nyid skabs su blang bar bya). This framing integrates vocal/musical practice into the comprehensive conduct system.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2169-2214]
Page 43 provides the detailed technical exposition of vajra song and dance actual (glu gar dngos), organized according to the threefold structure of body (lus), mind (sems), and speech (ngag; lines 2178-2180). This follows the standard tantric tripartite analysis of all practice activities. The body ritual subdivision (lus kyi cho ga) further bifurcates into attire (chas) and dance (bro gar; line 2181-2182), demonstrating the systematic organization of ritual performance theory.
The page presents two primary ritual contexts:
1. Accumulation-mandala-enter samadhi spread time (tshogs dang dkyil 'khor la 'jug pa dang ting nge 'dzin spel dus; lines 2182-2183)
2. Samsara-nirvana boundary divide time ('khor 'das ru shan 'byed pa'i tshe; line 2195)
The first context involves formal peaceful-wrathful deity practice; the second involves the transgressive naked conduct at the boundary between cyclic existence and liberation. This dual presentation reflects the integration of conventional tantric ritual with the advanced Dzogchen conduct of boundary-transcendence.
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: cho ga] - Wylie: cho ga. "Ritual" or "ceremony." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit vidhi. In tantric contexts, cho ga denotes the formal procedural structure of ritual activities. The phrase lus kyi cho ga (body ritual) indicates the somatic dimension of vajra song practice.
[TERM: chas] - Wylie: chas. "Attire," "costume," or "ornamentation." Technical term for ritual dress and adornment. Distinguished from ordinary clothing (gos), chas indicates the transformative symbolic garment that supports deity yoga practice. The peaceful attire (zhi ba'i chas) and wrathful attire (khro bo'i chas) represent the two primary soteriological modalities in tantric Buddhism.
[TERM: bro gar] - Wylie: bro gar. "Dance." The performative dimension of vajra song. The term bro indicates dance as movement, while gar (Skt. nata) suggests artistic performance. Combined, these denote the choreographed movement accompanying tantric vocalization.
[TERM: lhab lhub] - Wylie: lhab lhub. Onomatopoetic term describing the fluttering movement of silk garments. This vivid descriptive term indicates the flowing quality of peaceful deity attire.
[TERM: dbu rgyan] - Wylie: dbu rgyan. "Crown ornament." The specific head adornment worn by peaceful deities, distinct from the wrathful bone ornaments. The crown represents the five buddha families and the transmutation of the five poisons.
[TERM: rus pa'i rgyan drug] - Wylie: rus pa'i rgyan drug. "Six bone ornaments." The standard set of wrathful attire: crown, earrings, necklace, bracelets, girdle, and ash-application. These represent the six paramitas and the transcendence of ordinary aesthetics.
[TERM: thal chen] - Wylie: thal chen. "Great ash." The sacred ash applied to the body in wrathful deity practice, symbolizing the burning of defilements and the transcendence of purity/impurity dichotomies.
[TERM: bhan+d+ha] - Wylie: bhan+d+ha. Sanskrit loanword (bandha) meaning "bond" or "seal." In wrathful attire, this refers to specific binding ornaments or markings.
[TERM: phur pa] - Wylie: phur pa. "Peg" or "dagger." The ritual phurba used in wrathful practice to subvert obstacles. Holding the phurpa (phur pa 'dzin pa) indicates the activation of wrathful power.
[TERM: phyag rgya] - Wylie: phyag rgya. "Mudra" or "seal." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit mudra. In the context of deity dance (bro gar gyi lha'i phyag rgya), this refers to the ritual hand gestures that accompany and seal the practice.
[TERM: sngags dang snying po] - Wylie: sngags dang snying po. "Mantra and essence." The dual object of speech practice—mantra (sngags; Skt. mantra) and essence/syllable (snying po; Skt. hrdaya). This represents the outer mantra recitation and inner essential practice.
[TERM: gcer bu tha mal du gnas pa] - Wylie: gcer bu tha mal du gnas pa. "Dwell naked ordinary." Technical phrase describing the advanced conduct of transcending all conventions, including clothing. The term gcer bu (naked) indicates complete vulnerability and openness; tha mal (ordinary) indicates non-contrivance.
[TERM: DA ma ru] - Wylie: DA ma ru. "Damaru." The skull-drum used in tantric practice, typically made from two skull caps joined together. The damaru represents the union of method and wisdom and the sound of emptiness.
[TERM: gling bu] - Wylie: gling bu. "Flute." The thigh-bone trumpet used in wrathful practice. The gling bu produces a piercing sound that summons dakinis and dispels obstacles.
[CONTEXT]
[RITUAL CONTEXT: Peaceful-Wrathful Attire] - The page presents detailed specifications for peaceful (zhi ba) and wrathful (khro bo) attire. This dual classification reflects the fundamental tantric doctrine that enlightenment manifests through both peaceful and wrathful modalities. The peaceful attire (lines 2184-2186) includes:
- Silk garments (dar)
- Jewel ornaments (rin po che'i rgyan chas)
- Fluttering cloth (gos kyi lhab lhub)
- Peaceful crown ornament (zhi ba'i dbu rgyan)
- Vajra and bell (rdo rje dril bu)
The wrathful attire (lines 2187-2191) includes:
- Six bone ornaments (rus pa'i rgyan drug)
- Great ash application (thal chen gyi byug pa)
- Corpse paint (zhag gi zo ris)
- Bandha (bhan+d+ha)
- Phurpa (phur pa)
This detailed presentation indicates the page's function as practical ritual instruction rather than mere theoretical exposition.
[RITUAL CONTEXT: Forest-Lake-Island Enhancement] - Lines 2199-2206 describe enhanced practice in natural settings (nags dang mtsho gling la sogs par). The yogin employs:
- Damaru, bell, flute (DA ma ru, dril bu, gling bu)
- Flower head ornaments (me tog gi mgo rgyan)
- Deity body meditation (lha'i sku bsgom pa)
- Rigpa introduction training (rig pa'i ngo sprod thog tu sbyang ba)
- Three-fold samadhi spread (gsum spel)
This integration of musical performance, deity yoga, and Dzogchen pointing-out instructions exemplifies the Nyingma synthetic approach to practice.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Body-Speech-Mind Integration] - The page demonstrates the Nyingma integration of the three vajras (rdo rje gsum): body (lus) through dance and attire, speech (ngag) through mantra and melody, mind (sems) through deity meditation and rigpa training. This tripartite structure appears across Buddhist tantra but receives distinctive Dzogchen elaboration in Nyingma sources.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Vajra Song as Skillful Means] - The page presents vajra song as a comprehensive skillful means (thabs) integrating:
1. SOMATIC: Body posture, movement, and attire
2. VOCAL: Mantra recitation, melodic expression, instrumental accompaniment
3. COGNITIVE: Deity visualization, rigpa recognition
This multifaceted approach addresses practitioners at multiple levels of capacity, providing entry points through physical, vocal, or contemplative engagement.
[ANALYSIS: Naked Conduct Significance] - The gcer bu (naked) conduct (line 2196) represents the apex of transgressive practice. By transcending the fundamental human convention of clothing, the practitioner symbolically transcends all dualistic fixations. However, the modifier tha mal (ordinary) is crucial—this is not exhibitionism or shock value, but ordinary, uncontrived naturalness. The naked body is the "ordinary" body, stripped of social signification.
[ANALYSIS: Dance Choreography] - The page describes specific dance movements:
- Right-extend left-raise (g.yas brkyang g.yon bskul)
- Left-extend right-bend (g.yon brkyang g.yas bskum)
These paired oppositional movements represent the integration of dualistic extremes. The choreography is not arbitrary but encodes the tantric principle of non-dual wisdom through physical enactment.
[ANALYSIS: Vocal Technique] - The speech practice (lines 2209-2214) involves:
1. Long and short vowels (dbyangs... ring po dang thung ngu)
2. Consonant letters (gsal byed kyi yi ge)
3. Curved pleasant melodies ('khyog por gdangs snyan po)
4. Nasal pronunciation of seed syllables (sa sna drangs): om, e, hum, he, lye, shag
5. Supreme vajra words (rdo rje'i tshig): e ma ki ri ki ri, mashta ba li ba li
This technical presentation indicates that vajra song is not spontaneous expression but a trained vocal discipline involving precise phonetic, melodic, and energetic elements.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2215-2270]
Page 44 presents two major textual units: (1) the continuation and completion of the vajra song section with extensive Sanskrit mantra citation (lines 2215-2238), and (2) the dharmata song section (lines 2239-2262) followed by the benefits of song dance (glu gar gyi phan yon; lines 2263-2270). The structural organization marks a transition from technical ritual instruction to the philosophical exposition of the songs' ultimate nature.
The Sanskrit citation (lines 2215-2238) comprises a complex liturgical sequence combining bija syllables, deity names, and dharani formulas. This represents the continuation of the vajra song verbal techniques introduced in the previous page. The dharmata song section (lines 2239-2262) then presents the ultimate meaning of song as the self-expression of Samantabhadra (kun bzang yab yum), shifting from formal technique to spontaneous wisdom-display.
[PHILOLOGY]
[SANSKRIT MANTRA ANALYSIS] - The page presents an extensive liturgical sequence requiring philological analysis:
Lines 2215-2238 contain Sanskrit mantras in Tibetan transcription:
- Sa mi ta pu ru pu ru (likely "samita puru puru" - fully pacified)
- Ku ta li ma su ma su (possibly "kutali masu masu")
- I ka ra su li bha ta ye (invocational formula)
- Tsa ki ra bhu li sa la ye (dakini-related mantra)
- Sa mun+ta tsar+Ya su b+ha yai (auspiciousness invocation)
- B+he ta sa b+h+ya ku le yai (fearlessness formula)
- Sa ka ri d+hU ka na (dakini name)
- Ma ta ri bai ta na (goddess invocation)
- Ba ra li hi sA na
- Ma kharta ki la nAM (wrathful deity)
- SaM b+ha ra ta me ka tsang+taM pa
- Sur+Ya ta ra e pa sha na pa (solar deity)
- Ra na b+hi ti sa b+hu ra lA pa
- Ma smin sa gu li ta ya pa
- 'Gu ra 'gu rA sa ga kha ra na lI
- Na ra na rA i thar pa TA la (liberation formula)
- Sir na sir Ne b+he sa ras pa laM
- Bhun rda bhun rda tshiSha sa ke laM
The sequence concludes with bija syllables (lines 2233-2238):
- sa sA / ri rI / li lI / a AI / mi mI / ra ra rA
These represent the five seed syllables in their short and long forms, forming a sonic mandala.
[TERM: chos nyid kyi glu] - Wylie: chos nyid kyi glu. "Dharmata song." Technical term distinguishing the ultimate nature of song (expressing the dharmata, the nature of phenomena) from conventional vajra song technique. The phrase indicates spontaneous wisdom-expression rather than deliberate composition.
[TERM: kun bzang yab yum] - Wylie: kun bzang yab yum. "Samantabhadra father-mother." The primordial buddha couple representing the union of awareness (yab; male, space) and emptiness (yum; female, wisdom). The dharmata song is described as their "aim" (dgongs pa) or expressive intention.
[TERM: ma skyes pas na mi 'gag] - Wylie: ma skyes pas na mi 'gag. "By not-born, not-cease." Technical phrase from the dharmata song indicating the primordial nature of phenomena: because they have never arisen (ma skyes), they never cease (mi 'gag). This reflects the Madhyamika doctrine of non-origination applied to Dzogchen cosmology.
[TERM: kun tu khyab] - Wylie: kun tu khyab. "All-pervading." Technical descriptor of dharmata as omnipresent, without center or boundary. The term khyab (to pervade) functions as a key descriptor in Dzogchen epistemology.
[TERM: bde chen chos mchog] - Wylie: bde chen chos mchog. "Great bliss, supreme dharma." Compound epithet for the nature of mind as simultaneously blissful (bde chen) and the supreme teaching (chos mchog). This integrates the tantric emphasis on bliss with the sutric emphasis on dharma.
[TERM: mkha' mnyam] - Wylie: mkha' mnyam. "Sky-equal." Technical Dzogchen term describing the equal nature of liberation—like space, without partiality or distinction. The sky serves as the primary metaphor for the nature of mind in Dzogchen literature.
[TERM: ye grol lhun mnyam] - Wylie: ye grol lhun mnyam. "Primordially liberated, spontaneously equal." Compound technical term encapsulating two core Dzogchen concepts: primordial liberation (ye grol) and spontaneous equality (lhun mnyam). Together, these indicate that enlightenment is not achieved but naturally present.
[TERM: khyab gdal khang bzangs] - Wylie: khyab gdal khang bzangs. "Pervade expanse palace." Metaphor for the nature of mind as a spacious mansion (khang bzangs) that pervades (khyab) and expands (gdal) without limit.
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Nyi zla kha sbyor - Benefits Section] - Lines 2264-2270 cite the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra on the benefits (phan yon) of vajra song:
1. Chief method of yogin (rnal 'byor thabs kyi gtso)
2. Sound-not vajra song (grag pa med pa rdo rje'i glu)
3. Satisfies all buddha minds (sangs rgyas kun gyi yid kyang tshim)
4. Yogin's experience companion (rnal 'byor pa yi nyams kyi grogs)
5. Captures dakini minds (mkha' 'gro ma yi yid rnams 'phrog)
6. Turns six-type samsara clinging (rigs drug 'khor ba'i zhen pa bzlog)
These benefits frame vajra song as simultaneously: (a) a method for the yogin, (b) an offering to buddhas, (c) a support for experience, and (d) a means of liberating beings in the six realms.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Bija Syllable System] - The page's bija syllable sequence (lines 2233-2238) represents the sonic dimension of tantric cosmology. Each syllable corresponds to:
- sa: Akshobhya/buddha family
- ri: Amitabha/lotus family
- li: Amoghasiddhi/karma family
- a: Vairochana/buddha family
- mi: Ratnasambhava/jewel family
- ra: additional resonance
This systematic employment of seed syllables reflects the integration of sonic yoga (sgra'i rnal 'byor) into Nyingma practice.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Mantra as Dharmata Expression] - The page demonstrates two levels of vajra song:
1. CONVENTIONAL: The Sanskrit mantras (lines 2215-2238) function as deliberate ritual speech
2. ULTIMATE: The dharmata song (lines 2239-2262) expresses the nature of phenomena directly
The transition from the former to the latter reflects the Nyingma hermeneutical principle: all conventional practices ultimately point to the natural state. The elaborate mantra recitation is not an end in itself but a support for recognizing the dharmata song that is spontaneously present.
[ANALYSIS: Dharmata Song Content] - The dharmata song verses (lines 2240-2261) enumerate sixteen aspects of dharmata:
1. Not-born, not-cease
2. No going, no coming, all-pervading
3. Great bliss, supreme dharma, unmoving
4. Sky-equal liberation, no stain
5. No root, no support
6. No abode, no taking, great dharma
7. Primordially liberated, spontaneously equal, great expanse
8. No binding, no releasing
9. Pervade expanse palace, primordially existent
10. Beyond pervade, not-decline
11. Great expanse, sky expanse
12. Great dharma blazing, sun-moon center
13. Direct, spontaneously accomplished
14. Great vajra mountain, great lotus
15. Wisdom song, sun lion
16. Great sound music, unequalled
This enumeration serves as both descriptive cosmology and contemplative instruction—the practitioner contemplates each quality as an aspect of their own mind.
[ANALYSIS: Song Benefits Typology] - The six benefits (lines 2265-2270) organize vajra song function according to recipient:
1. For the yogin: chief method (thabs kyi gtso)
2. For the practice: sound-not (grag pa med pa)
3. For the buddhas: mind-satisfaction (yid... tshim)
4. For the yogin's experience: companion (grogs)
5. For the dakinis: mind-capture (yid... 'phrog)
6. For beings: clinging-reversal (zhen pa bzlog)
This multi-directional benefit structure reflects the Mahayana principle that practice serves self and others simultaneously.
[ANALYSIS: The Six Realms Liberation] - The final benefit—turning six-type samsara clinging (rigs drug 'khor ba'i zhen pa bzlog)—indicates that vajra song functions as a means of liberating beings in all six realms (god, demigod, human, animal, hungry ghost, hell). The sonic dimension of practice is thus not merely personal cultivation but universal benefit.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2271-2310]
Page 45 completes the benefits section of vajra song (lines 2271-2288) and transitions to the third major subdivision: time-seizing by definite sequence conduct (go rims nges pa'i spyod pas dus tshod gzung ba; lines 2289-2310). This section is organized into three progressive categories:
1. Beginning practitioner's conduct (las dang po pa'i spyod pa; line 2290)
2. Samsara-nirvana boundary-divide conduct ('khor 'das ru shan 'byed pa'i spyod pa; line 2291)
3. Vow-path-raising conduct (brtul zhugs lam du bslang ba'i spyod pa; line 2292)
This tripartite structure reflects the standard pedagogical progression from preliminary to advanced practice. The beginning practitioner's conduct section (lines 2293-2301) cites extensively from the Dbus mtha' (Center-Edge) text, establishing the ten dharma actions (chos spyod bcu) as the foundational practice framework.
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: skal dang ldan pa] - Wylie: skal dang ldan pa. "Possessing fortune and suitable." Compound technical term indicating the karmic capacity and personal suitability for dharma practice. The term skal (portion, fortune, share) implies that practice capacity is distributed according to karma.
[TERM: ngang 'du] - Wylie: ngang 'du. "Nature-gathering." Technical term for the inner gathering or integration of meditative experience. Related to the natural state (ngang) and the process of collection or integration ('du ba).
[TERM: rang dal 'thob] - Wylie: rang dal 'thob. "Obtain self-relaxation." Technical phrase indicating the achievement of natural relaxation through practice. The term dal (relaxed, loose, slow) is a key descriptor of proper meditative state in Dzogchen.
[TERM: gsal rnams 'debs] - Wylie: gsal rnams 'debs. "Beat clarity forms." Technical phrase describing the activation or arousal of clear appearances in meditation. The verb 'debs (to beat, strike) suggests the vigorous arousal of clarity.
[TERM: shes pa gcig pa'i dpung] - Wylie: shes pa gcig pa'i dpung. "One-knowledge army." Metaphor for the unified awareness that conquers all obstacles. The term shes pa (knowledge, awareness) is distinguished from sems (mind) as the non-conceptual knowing quality.
[TERM: yid can] - Wylie: yid can. "Mind-possessor"—a sentient being. Distinguished from lus can (body-possessor), indicating beings characterized by mental activity.
[TERM: dbang dang dam tshig] - Wylie: dbang dang dam tshig. "Empowerment and samaya." The two pillars of tantric practice: initiation (dbang) that transmits authority, and vows (dam tshig) that bind the practitioner to the path.
[TERM: las dang po pa] - Wylie: las dang po pa. "First-action-one" or "beginning practitioner." Technical doxographical category for those at the initial stages of practice. Contrasts with advanced practitioners (rtogs ldan) and realized masters (bla ma).
[TERM: chos spyod bcu] - Wylie: chos spyod bcu. "Ten dharma actions." Standard enumeration of preliminary practices:
1. Yi ge 'dri (writing letters) - copying scriptures
2. Mchod (worship) - making offerings
3. Sbyin pa (giving) - generosity
4. Nyan (hearing) - studying teachings
5. Klog (reading) - reciting texts
6. 'Dzin pa (holding) - memorization
7. 'Chad (explaining) - teaching
8. Kha ton (recitation) - liturgical recitation
9. Sems pa (contemplating) - reflection
10. Bsgom pa (meditating) - formal meditation
[TERM: bung ba tshang 'tshol ba] - Wylie: bung ba tshang 'tshol ba. "Bee house-seeking." Metaphor for the practitioner's search for dharma meaning, compared to bees gathering nectar from flowers. The bee is attracted to all flowers without discrimination, representing unbiased dharma study.
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Dbus mtha'] - Lines 2294-2301 cite the Dbus mtha' (Center-Edge), a Nyingma text presenting the ten dharma actions. The citation establishes the accumulation of merit (bsod nams phung po) as the immediate result of these practices. The phrase dpag tu med (immeasurable, measureless) emphasizes the vastness of merit accumulated through consistent practice.
[CITATION: Rdo rje gsang ba'i glu] - Lines 2285-2288 cite the Vajra Secret Song on the purpose of practice: "By Vajra Secret Song, for need of closing lower-realms gate, buddha itself activity." This frames vajra song as having both salvific (liberating beings) and revelatory (expressing buddha-activity) functions.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Threefold Conduct Progression] - The page establishes a clear progression:
1. BEGINNING: Ten dharma actions (foundational merit accumulation)
2. INTERMEDIATE: Profound instruction experience-taking + samsara-nirvana division
3. ADVANCED: Seven of twenty-one conducts
This reflects the Nyingma pedagogical principle that conduct must be appropriate to the practitioner's capacity. One cannot begin with advanced transgressive conduct without foundational training.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Three Wisdoms Structure] - The bee metaphor section (lines 2308-2310) presents the three wisdoms (shes rab gsum):
1. Thos pa'i shes rab (hearing wisdom) - distinguishes dharma from non-dharma
2. Bsam pa'i shes rab (contemplation wisdom) - realizes meaning and suppresses afflictions
3. Sgom pa'i shes rab (meditation wisdom) - extracts affliction roots through instant placement
This reflects the standard Buddhist epistemological triad: study, reflection, meditation. However, the Dzogchen emphasis on rtogs thog tu bzhag pa (instant placement of realization) distinguishes the Nyingma approach from gradualist interpretations.
[ANALYSIS: Peacock as Preliminary] - The commentary explains that the peacock (thi bya) conduct serves as a companion to the three wisdoms. Just as the peacock eats poison and transforms it into beauty, the practitioner uses the three wisdoms to transform conceptual superimpositions (sgro 'dogs) into realization. This indicates that transgressive conduct requires preliminary wisdom development.
[ANALYSIS: Progressive Conduct Typology] - The three categories of definite-sequence conduct represent:
1. LOWER: Conventional virtue (ten dharma actions)
2. MIDDLE: Tantric method (profound instructions + samsara-nirvana division)
3. UPPER: Dzogchen spontaneity (twenty-one conducts, specifically the first seven)
This structure reflects the Nyingma integration of sutra, tantra, and ati vehicles into a single progressive path.
[ANALYSIS: Samsara-Nirvana Division] - The second conduct category ('khor 'das ru shan 'byed pa'i spyod pa) represents the pivotal transition from conventional to transgressive practice. By dividing (dbye ba) samsara and nirvana, the practitioner recognizes their non-duality while maintaining the conventional distinction. This "dividing" is not a dualistic separation but a wisdom-recognition of the boundary.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2311-2334]
Page 46 presents the detailed exposition of the seven primary conducts from the twenty-one, forming the core practical instruction of the section. The structural organization follows a coordinated progression where each conduct serves as a "companion" (grogs su) to the previous, creating an integrated practice system. The seven conducts are:
1. Peacock conduct (thi bya tshang du 'jug pa) - lines 2315-2316
2. Deer conduct (ri dwags lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2317-2318
3. Mute conduct (lkugs pa lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2319-2320
4. Madman conduct (smyon pa lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2321-2322
5. Dog-pig conduct (khyi phag lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2323-2324
6. Lion conduct (seng ge lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2325-2327
7. Appearance-power-transform conduct (snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa) - lines 2328-2333
The section concludes with the transition to the instruction section (de'i man ngag; line 2334), setting up the next page's content.
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: sgro 'dogs] - Wylie: sgro 'dogs. "Superimposition" or "conceptual overlay." Technical epistemological term from Madhyamika philosophy denoting the projection of inherent existence onto phenomena. The phrase sgro 'dogs bcad pa (cutting superimposition) indicates the wisdom that eliminates conceptual proliferation.
[TERM: 'dzal 'dzol] - Wylie: 'dzal 'dzol. "Confusion" or "mix-up." Term indicating the disorder that arises when superimpositions have not been thoroughly cut. The negated form 'dzal 'dzol med par indicates the clarity that follows proper preparation.
[TERM: the tshom med pa] - Wylie: the tshom med pa. "Without doubt." Technical term indicating the decisive confidence that arises from having cut through superimpositions. Doubt (the tshom) is one of the five obscurations (sgrib pa lnga) obstructing meditation.
[TERM: gnong gis mi mi rgyu ba] - Wylie: gnong gis mi mi rgyu ba. "People not going out of fear." The phrase gnong gis indicates the fear (gnong; perhaps from gnod pa, harm) that prevents ordinary people from entering solitary retreat locations.
[TERM: rma'i gnong] - Wylie: rma'i gnong. "Hunter's fear." Technical phrase describing the deer's fear of hunters, serving as the metaphorical basis for the practitioner's fear of samsara.
[TERM: yan gar ba] - Wylie: yan gar ba. "Hiding alone" or "solitary concealment." Term describing the deer's behavior and, by extension, the hermit practitioner's retreat.
[TERM: dran pa rengs pa] - Wylie: dran pa rengs pa. "Memory becomes rigid" or "mindfulness freezes." Technical phrase describing the state when conceptual memory (dran pa) ceases its normal associative function. This "freezing" is a precursor to non-conceptual wisdom.
[TERM: gza' gtad] - Wylie: gza' gtad. "Planetary attachment" or "astrological fixation." Technical term indicating conventional constraints, including astrological concerns about planetary influences. The phrase gza' gtad med pa indicates transcendence of such conventional limitations.
[TERM: shugs las 'byung] - Wylie: shugs las 'byung. "Arising from force/power." Technical phrase indicating spontaneous emergence from the force of practice, distinct from deliberate fabrication.
[TERM: 'dem kha med pa] - Wylie: 'dem kha med pa. "Without picking and choosing." Technical phrase describing the dog-pig conduct's transcendence of preferences. The term 'dem kha (choice, selection) indicates the ordinary discriminatory mind.
[TERM: zil gyis mi non] - Wylie: zil gyis mi non. "Not overwhelmed by splendor/power." Technical term indicating the mastery state where others cannot dominate or intimidate the practitioner. The term zil (splendor, power) indicates the imposing presence of advanced realization.
[TERM: phar gnon pa] - Wylie: phar gnon pa. "Suppressing the far shore" or "overpowering the other side." Technical phrase indicating the lion-like capacity to overcome all opposition.
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Nyi zla kha sbyor - Three Wisdoms] - Lines 2311-2314 cite the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra on the three wisdoms for cutting superimpositions:
1. Thos pa'i shes rab kyis phyi'i sgro 'dogs bcad pa - hearing wisdom cuts outer superimpositions
2. Bsam pa'i shes rab kyis nang gi sgro 'dogs bcad pa - contemplation wisdom cuts inner superimpositions
3. Sgom pa'i shes rab kyis gsang ba'i sgro 'dogs bcad pa - meditation wisdom cuts secret superimpositions
This tripartite structure reflects the progressive deepening of insight: external phenomena, internal thoughts, and most subtle conceptual patterns.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Conduct as Sequential System] - The page presents the seven conducts not as alternatives but as a coordinated progression. Each conduct "serves as a companion" (grogs su) to the previous, indicating that they support and enhance each other. This integrated approach distinguishes Nyingma conduct theory from elective practice menus.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Progressive Conduct Logic] - The seven conducts follow a sophisticated developmental logic:
1. PEACOCK (2315-2316): Superimposition-cutting preparation. The peacock eats poison (afflictions) after the three wisdoms have cut conceptual overlays. This is the foundation—transformation requires preparation.
2. DEER (2317-2318): Solitude-seeking. Having tasted the poison of samsara through the peacock's transformation, the practitioner seeks isolation like a deer fleeing hunters. Fear of samsara (gnong) motivates retreat.
3. MUTE (2319-2320): Speech cessation. In solitude, external communication ceases. This silences the verbal dimension of conceptual proliferation.
4. MADMAN (2321-2322): Conceptual freeze. When speech ceases, memory/mindfulness "freezes" (rengs pa)—the associative mind stops. This produces spontaneous (shugs las 'byung) conduct beyond social convention.
5. DOG-PIG (2323-2324): Beyond pure/impure. With conceptual mind frozen, the practitioner transcends the pure/impure dichotomy, accepting whatever sustenance appears without preference ('dem kha med pa).
6. LION (2325-2327): Fearless mastery. Having transcended conventional categories, the practitioner becomes fearless like a lion, overpowering (gnon pa) all opposition. This produces the siddhis: mind-control, revivification, miracles, dharmata-blazing, element-control.
7. APPEARANCE-POWER-TRANSFORM (2328-2333): Integrated capacity. The lion's mastery manifests as the capacity to transform appearances at will—this is the conduct that gives its name to the entire category.
[ANALYSIS: The Six Siddhis] - Lines 2329-2333 enumerate six attainments from lion conduct:
1. Able to overpower others' minds (gzhan gyi mi dbang bsgyur nus)
2. Able to kill and restore (bsad pa slar gso nus pa)
3. Accomplishing miracles (rdzu 'phrul grub)
4. Dharmata experience blazing (chos nyid kyi nyams 'bar ba)
5. Free from fear in all directions (phyogs yan re dogs dang bral)
6. Able to transform four elements ('byung bzhi la dbang bsgyur nus pa)
These correspond to the classical siddhis of tantric tradition, here presented as natural byproducts of conduct completion rather than goals to be achieved.
[ANALYSIS: The Appearance-Power-Transform Mechanism] - The final section (lines 2334) introduces the instruction method (man ngag): seeing whatever appears as mind-itself directly placed (gang snang snang gi thog tu sems nyid cer bzhag tu bltas pas). This represents the essence of Dzogchen practice—direct recognition that appearances are mind, mind is empty, and emptiness is spontaneous presence.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2335-2386]
Page 47 presents the detailed instruction for appearance direct-placement (snang ba cer bzhag), forming the technical core of the conduct section. The structural organization follows an analogical exposition:
1. Snow-on-rock-salt simile (lines 2335-2336)
2. Appearance training in various phenomena (lines 2337-2346)
3. Dharmata training in unborn nature (lines 2347)
4. Six Vastnesses citation (lines 2348-2369)
5. Ground-rise intention emergence (lines 2370-2385)
6. Transition to fruit section (line 2386)
The page integrates practice instruction with philosophical exposition, using the Six Vastnesses (Klong drug pa) as the primary scriptural source for understanding the relationship between mind and appearance.
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: rdo tshan] - Wylie: rdo tshan. "Rock salt." Technical term in the simile describing how appearances self-liberate like snow falling on rock salt. Rock salt (sodium chloride in crystalline form) absorbs moisture immediately, serving as a metaphor for instant self-liberation.
[TERM: lhan gyis 'gro] - Wylie: lhan gyis 'gro. "Goes spontaneously" or "self-proceeds." Technical phrase indicating natural, effortless movement without deliberate direction. This describes the self-liberating quality of awareness.
[TERM: rang zhig] - Wylie: rang zhig. "Self-liberation" or "natural liberation." The most fundamental technical term in Dzogchen practice theory. The rang (self) indicates that liberation is intrinsic, not achieved through external intervention.
[TERM: 'dzin zhen] - Wylie: 'dzin zhen. "Grasping-clinging" or "fixation-attachment." Compound technical term for the dualistic mind that apprehends phenomena as inherently existent. The phrase 'dzin zhen grol nas indicates liberation from this fixation.
[TERM: bden pas stong pa] - Wylie: bden pas stong pa. "Empty of truth" or "devoid of inherent existence." Standard Madhyamika formulation indicating the lack of svabhava (inherent nature) in phenomena.
[TERM: chos can] - Wylie: chos can. "Phenomena-possessor" or "qualified subject." Technical term from Buddhist logic (hetuvidya) indicating the subject of a philosophical proposition. Here used to categorize various types of appearances.
[TERM: dum bu pa] - Wylie: dum bu pa. "Piece-like" or "fragmentary." Technical term describing the appearance of phenomena as distinct, separate entities. Training in dum bu pa means seeing through the apparent fragmentation of experience.
[TERM: chos spyi'i rnam pa] - Wylie: chos spyi'i rnam pa. "General form of dharmas." Technical epistemological term indicating the universal aspect of phenomena, distinguished from individual particulars (rang gi mtshan nyid).
[TERM: gdod ma nas zhi ba] - Wylie: gdod ma nas zhi ba. "Peaceful from the primordial." Technical Dzogchen phrase indicating that the nature of phenomena has never been disturbed, that peace is not achieved but original.
[TERM: skye ba yod pa'i sems nyid] - Wylie: skye ba yod pa'i sems nyid. "Mind-itself where arising exists." Technical phrase identifying the ground of appearance as the mind's nature. The phrase does not assert that mind arises, but that in the nature where arising appears, that itself is mind.
[TERM: 'gro drug] - Wylie: 'gro drug. "Six types" or "six realms." Standard enumeration of samsaric existence: gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings. The six realms appear through the self-dawning of mind.
[TERM: rang sar dag] - Wylie: rang sar dag. "Self-place pure." Technical phrase indicating that phenomena are pure in their own location without needing transformation. This is the Dzogchen doctrine of rang dag (self-purification).
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Klong drug pa] - Lines 2348-2369 present an extensive citation from the Six Vastnesses (Klong drug pa), a major Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class. The passage presents six modes of appearance arising from mind-itself:
1. Arising (skye ba yod pa): six-realm appearances self-dawn as different forms
2. Ceasing ('gag pa yod pa): impermanence self-dawns as natureless appearance
3. Elaboration (spros pa yod pa): various appearances self-dawn as individual perceptions
4. Showing (bstan du yod pa): sounds/words/names self-dawn as pure concepts
5. Visible (mthong du yod pa): conditions self-dawn as unmixed self-clarity
6. Existence-nonexistence (yod dang med pa): extremes self-dawn as self-place pure
This sixfold structure encompasses all possible phenomena within mind's self-display.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Self-Dawning Doctrine] - The citation's repeated use of rang shar (self-dawn, self-arise) reflects the central Dzogchen doctrine that phenomena are not created by mind but are the spontaneous display (rang snang) of mind's nature. This distinguishes Dzogchen from Cittamatra (mind-only) positions that assert mind creates phenomena.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Eight Metaphors for Appearance] - Lines 2339-2346 present eight similes for the nature of appearance:
1. Reflections (gzugs brnyan)
2. Water-moon (chu zla) - moon reflected in water
3. Sound-echo (sgra brnyan)
4. Emanations (sprul pa)
5. Illusions (sgyu ma)
6. Mirages (smig rgyu)
7. Optical illusions (mig yor)
8. Dream horse (rmi lam rta)
These eight similes function as contemplative supports—practitioners train in seeing all appearances through these analogies to recognize their illusory, insubstantial nature.
[ANALYSIS: Snow-on-Rock-Salt Simile] - The opening simile (lines 2335-2336) presents instant self-liberation: like snow falling on rock salt, appearances dissolve immediately upon arising without trace. This represents the highest level of Dzogchen practice—self-liberation at the moment of appearance (char grol) rather than through subsequent analysis.
[ANALYSIS: Phenomena as Different Pieces Training] - The phrase chos can tha dad dum bu pa la bslabs pas (lines 2339) indicates training in seeing phenomena as different pieces or fragments. This does not mean accepting fragmentation but training to see through the apparent separateness of phenomena to recognize their unified nature.
[ANALYSIS: Six Vastnesses Structure] - The Six Vastnesses citation presents a complete phenomenology:
- ARISING: Forms appear as the six realms
- CEASING: Impermanence appears as natureless
- ELABORATION: Variety appears as individual perceptions
- SHOWING: Language appears as pure concept
- VISIBLE: Conditions appear as unmixed clarity
- EXISTENCE/NONEXISTENCE: Extremes appear as self-pure
Each mode demonstrates how a different type of phenomenon is the self-dawning of mind, complete in its own place.
[ANALYSIS: Ground-Rise Intention] - Lines 2370-2385 present the dgongs pa (intention, aim) of snang srid gzhi bzhengs (appearance-existence ground-rise). Key passages:
- "Although not trained in samsara-nirvana dharmas, all self-dawn in mind, without obstacle to anything" (lines 2370-2371)
- "In mind-itself where there is no hope or fear, appearance without hope-fear is called 'directly-placed confidence intention'" (lines 2373-2375)
- "In mind-itself without appearance aspect, the sole subtle appearance is called 'great freedom from elaboration intention'" (lines 2377-2379)
- "By thus settling mind in intention, the yogin obtains power over mind and is liberated from stain-binding" (lines 2381-2384)
This establishes that the ground of appearance is itself the intention of Samantabhadra—spontaneous wisdom-display without deliberate aim.
[ANALYSIS: Two Types of Intention] - The citation distinguishes:
1. YE BZHAG GDENG LDAN DGONGS PA - Directly-placed confidence intention: appearance without hope or fear
2. SPROS BRAL CHEN PO'I DGONGS PA - Great freedom from elaboration intention: the subtle appearance in the absence of coarse manifestation
These represent two aspects of the same reality: the apparent and the subtle, both equally the display of mind's nature.
