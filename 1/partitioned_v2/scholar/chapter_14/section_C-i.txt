Page 47 presents the detailed instruction for appearance direct-placement (snang ba cer bzhag), forming the technical core of the conduct section. The structural organization follows an analogical exposition:
1. Snow-on-rock-salt simile (lines 2335-2336)
2. Appearance training in various phenomena (lines 2337-2346)
3. Dharmata training in unborn nature (lines 2347)
4. Six Vastnesses citation (lines 2348-2369)
5. Ground-rise intention emergence (lines 2370-2385)
6. Transition to fruit section (line 2386)
The page integrates practice instruction with philosophical exposition, using the Six Vastnesses (Klong drug pa) as the primary scriptural source for understanding the relationship between mind and appearance.
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: rdo tshan] - Wylie: rdo tshan. "Rock salt." Technical term in the simile describing how appearances self-liberate like snow falling on rock salt. Rock salt (sodium chloride in crystalline form) absorbs moisture immediately, serving as a metaphor for instant self-liberation.
[TERM: lhan gyis 'gro] - Wylie: lhan gyis 'gro. "Goes spontaneously" or "self-proceeds." Technical phrase indicating natural, effortless movement without deliberate direction. This describes the self-liberating quality of awareness.
[TERM: rang zhig] - Wylie: rang zhig. "Self-liberation" or "natural liberation." The most fundamental technical term in Dzogchen practice theory. The rang (self) indicates that liberation is intrinsic, not achieved through external intervention.
[TERM: 'dzin zhen] - Wylie: 'dzin zhen. "Grasping-clinging" or "fixation-attachment." Compound technical term for the dualistic mind that apprehends phenomena as inherently existent. The phrase 'dzin zhen grol nas indicates liberation from this fixation.
[TERM: bden pas stong pa] - Wylie: bden pas stong pa. "Empty of truth" or "devoid of inherent existence." Standard Madhyamika formulation indicating the lack of svabhava (inherent nature) in phenomena.
[TERM: chos can] - Wylie: chos can. "Phenomena-possessor" or "qualified subject." Technical term from Buddhist logic (hetuvidya) indicating the subject of a philosophical proposition. Here used to categorize various types of appearances.
[TERM: dum bu pa] - Wylie: dum bu pa. "Piece-like" or "fragmentary." Technical term describing the appearance of phenomena as distinct, separate entities. Training in dum bu pa means seeing through the apparent fragmentation of experience.
[TERM: chos spyi'i rnam pa] - Wylie: chos spyi'i rnam pa. "General form of dharmas." Technical epistemological term indicating the universal aspect of phenomena, distinguished from individual particulars (rang gi mtshan nyid).
[TERM: gdod ma nas zhi ba] - Wylie: gdod ma nas zhi ba. "Peaceful from the primordial." Technical Dzogchen phrase indicating that the nature of phenomena has never been disturbed, that peace is not achieved but original.
[TERM: skye ba yod pa'i sems nyid] - Wylie: skye ba yod pa'i sems nyid. "Mind-itself where arising exists." Technical phrase identifying the ground of appearance as the mind's nature. The phrase does not assert that mind arises, but that in the nature where arising appears, that itself is mind.
[TERM: 'gro drug] - Wylie: 'gro drug. "Six types" or "six realms." Standard enumeration of samsaric existence: gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings. The six realms appear through the self-dawning of mind.
[TERM: rang sar dag] - Wylie: rang sar dag. "Self-place pure." Technical phrase indicating that phenomena are pure in their own location without needing transformation. This is the Dzogchen doctrine of rang dag (self-purification).
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Klong drug pa] - Lines 2348-2369 present an extensive citation from the Six Vastnesses (Klong drug pa), a major Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class. The passage presents six modes of appearance arising from mind-itself:
1. Arising (skye ba yod pa): six-realm appearances self-dawn as different forms
2. Ceasing ('gag pa yod pa): impermanence self-dawns as natureless appearance
3. Elaboration (spros pa yod pa): various appearances self-dawn as individual perceptions
4. Showing (bstan du yod pa): sounds/words/names self-dawn as pure concepts
5. Visible (mthong du yod pa): conditions self-dawn as unmixed self-clarity
6. Existence-nonexistence (yod dang med pa): extremes self-dawn as self-place pure
This sixfold structure encompasses all possible phenomena within mind's self-display.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Self-Dawning Doctrine] - The citation's repeated use of rang shar (self-dawn, self-arise) reflects the central Dzogchen doctrine that phenomena are not created by mind but are the spontaneous display (rang snang) of mind's nature. This distinguishes Dzogchen from Cittamatra (mind-only) positions that assert mind creates phenomena.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Eight Metaphors for Appearance] - Lines 2339-2346 present eight similes for the nature of appearance:
1. Reflections (gzugs brnyan)
2. Water-moon (chu zla) - moon reflected in water
3. Sound-echo (sgra brnyan)
4. Emanations (sprul pa)
5. Illusions (sgyu ma)
6. Mirages (smig rgyu)
7. Optical illusions (mig yor)
8. Dream horse (rmi lam rta)
These eight similes function as contemplative supports—practitioners train in seeing all appearances through these analogies to recognize their illusory, insubstantial nature.
[ANALYSIS: Snow-on-Rock-Salt Simile] - The opening simile (lines 2335-2336) presents instant self-liberation: like snow falling on rock salt, appearances dissolve immediately upon arising without trace. This represents the highest level of Dzogchen practice—self-liberation at the moment of appearance (char grol) rather than through subsequent analysis.
[ANALYSIS: Phenomena as Different Pieces Training] - The phrase chos can tha dad dum bu pa la bslabs pas (lines 2339) indicates training in seeing phenomena as different pieces or fragments. This does not mean accepting fragmentation but training to see through the apparent separateness of phenomena to recognize their unified nature.
[ANALYSIS: Six Vastnesses Structure] - The Six Vastnesses citation presents a complete phenomenology:
- ARISING: Forms appear as the six realms
- CEASING: Impermanence appears as natureless
- ELABORATION: Variety appears as individual perceptions
- SHOWING: Language appears as pure concept
- VISIBLE: Conditions appear as unmixed clarity
- EXISTENCE/NONEXISTENCE: Extremes appear as self-pure
Each mode demonstrates how a different type of phenomenon is the self-dawning of mind, complete in its own place.
[ANALYSIS: Ground-Rise Intention] - Lines 2370-2385 present the dgongs pa (intention, aim) of snang srid gzhi bzhengs (appearance-existence ground-rise). Key passages:
- "Although not trained in samsara-nirvana dharmas, all self-dawn in mind, without obstacle to anything" (lines 2370-2371)
- "In mind-itself where there is no hope or fear, appearance without hope-fear is called 'directly-placed confidence intention'" (lines 2373-2375)
- "In mind-itself without appearance aspect, the sole subtle appearance is called 'great freedom from elaboration intention'" (lines 2377-2379)
- "By thus settling mind in intention, the yogin obtains power over mind and is liberated from stain-binding" (lines 2381-2384)
This establishes that the ground of appearance is itself the intention of Samantabhadra—spontaneous wisdom-display without deliberate aim.
[ANALYSIS: Two Types of Intention] - The citation distinguishes:
1. YE BZHAG GDENG LDAN DGONGS PA - Directly-placed confidence intention: appearance without hope or fear
2. SPROS BRAL CHEN PO'I DGONGS PA - Great freedom from elaboration intention: the subtle appearance in the absence of coarse manifestation
These represent two aspects of the same reality: the apparent and the subtle, both equally the display of mind's nature.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2387-2446]
Page 48 presents the fruit section ('bras bu) of the appearance-power-transform conduct and transitions to the second major category: meditation-progressive-yogin (bsgom pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor). The structural organization follows:
1. Fruit of aggregates-elements-sense-fields liberation (lines 2387-2421)
2. Fourfold division of meditation yogin (lines 2422-2426)
3. Threefold division of sun-mouth-join meditation (lines 2427-2432)
4. Citation from Thal 'gyur on meditation definition (lines 2433-2445)
5. Transition to mind-holding twenty-one (line 2446)
The page integrates the conclusion of the conduct section with the opening of the meditation section, using the Mu tig phreng ba (Pearl Garland) and Klong drug pa (Six Vastnesses) as primary scriptural sources.
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: phung po khams dang skye mched] - Wylie: phung po khams dang skye mched. "Aggregates, elements, and sense-fields." The standard Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit skandha-dhatu-ayatana—the threefold analysis of conditioned existence in Abhidharma literature. The aggregate (phung po; Skt. skandha) analysis comprises form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. The element (khams; Skt. dhatu) analysis comprises the eighteen elements. The sense-field (skye mched; Skt. ayatana) analysis comprises the twelve sense-bases.
[TERM: rigs dang rigs kyi bdag po] - Wylie: rigs dang rigs kyi bdag po. "Family and family's lord." Technical tantric terminology: rigs (Skt. gotra or kula) indicates the buddha-family or clan, while rigs kyi bdag po (Skt. kulesha) indicates the head or lord of that family (the principal deity). The phrase indicates liberation through identification with the appropriate deity family.
[TERM: rkyen gyis grol ba] - Wylie: rkyen gyis grol ba. "Liberated by conditions." Technical phrase indicating the Dzogchen doctrine that phenomena self-liberate through their own conditions without requiring intervention. This reflects the principle of rang grol (self-liberation).
[TERM: dmigs pa'i chos] - Wylie: dmigs pa'i chos. "Observed dharmas" or "referent objects." Technical epistemological term for phenomena that serve as the objects of perception or cognition. The phrase indicates that liberation occurs without reliance on conceptual referents.
[TERM: gzung 'dzin] - Wylie: gzung 'dzin. "Grasping and holding" or "apprehended and apprehender." Technical term for the subject-object duality. Gzung (apprehended, grasped) indicates the object; 'dzin (holder, grasper) indicates the subject. Liberation in the object itself transcends this duality.
[TERM: 'khor 'das gnyis] - Wylie: 'khor 'das gnyis. "The two: samsara and nirvana." Standard designation for the fundamental dichotomy of cyclic existence and liberation. Dzogchen teachings aim at transcending this apparent opposition.
[TERM: tha snyad tshig] - Wylie: tha snyad tshig. "Conventional words" or "designative language." Technical term for conceptual, linguistic designation as distinct from ultimate reality. The phrase nga mi ltos (I do not rely) indicates transcendence of linguistic/conceptual mediation.
[TERM: mtshon byed blo] - Wylie: mtshon byed blo. "Indicating mind." Technical term for conceptual consciousness that indicates or points to objects. The ultimate truth transcends this indicating function.
[TERM: rtog tshogs] - Wylie: rtog tshogs. "Thought-assemblies." Technical term for the collections of conceptual thought that constitute ordinary mind. The phrase indicates that these self-purify in their own place.
[TERM: nyin mtshan kha sbyor] - Wylie: nyin mtshan kha sbyor. "Day-night mouth-join." Technical term indicating continuous practice without interruption, joining day and night into seamless awareness. This is the highest level of meditative application.
[TERM: rgya mtsho cog bzhag] - Wylie: rgya mtsho cog bzhag. "Ocean direct-placement." Technical meditation term indicating vast, open resting like the ocean. The rgya mtsho (ocean) metaphor indicates limitless, unbounded awareness.
[TERM: chos nyid gzhi bzhag] - Wylie: chos nyid gzhi bzhag. "Dharmata ground-placement." Technical term for meditation that rests directly in the nature of phenomena (dharmata) as the ground (gzhi) of all appearance.
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Mu tig phreng ba] - Lines 2387-2401 cite the Pearl Garland (Mu tig phreng ba), a Nyingma tantra. The passage presents the self-liberation of all conditioned categories:
- Aggregates-elements-sense-fields liberate in family and family's lord
- Conditions liberate in conditions → no reliance on observed dharmas
- Objects liberate in objects → no reliance on grasping-holding
- Cause liberates in cause → no reliance on samsara-nirvana
- Dharmas liberate in dharmas → no reliance on concepts-words
- Mind-itself liberates in mind → no reliance on indicating mind
This systematic presentation of self-liberation (rang grol) establishes the theoretical basis for non-meditation meditation.
[CITATION: Klong drug pa - Continuation] - Lines 2402-2421 cite the Six Vastnesses on the self-purification of all phenomena in mind-itself:
- Six-aggregates appearance: thought-assemblies self-place pure
- Sounds-words appearance: concepts-names self-place pure
- Coarse appearance: four-elements' conditions self-place pure
- Grasping-holding appearance: binding self-grasp pure
- Existence appearance: phenomena self-place pure
- Non-existence appearance: emptinesses self-place pure
- Existence-non-existence: establishing extremes self-place pure
- Dharma appearance: own-characteristics pure
- Non-dharma appearance: delusions self-place pure
This exhaustive enumeration demonstrates the universal scope of self-purification.
[CITATION: Thal 'gyur] - Lines 2433-2445 cite the Thal 'gyur (Consequence) tantra defining meditation:
- Born from nature's descent (rang bzhin babs las byung ba) = samadhi
- Channels, winds, thigle = meditation
- Body piths, eyes, emptiness = meditation
- Letters, light, color = samadhi
- Emanation's spread-gather = concentration
- Unfabricated natural settling = buddhas' intention
This presents both tantric (channels-winds-thigle) and Dzogchen (unfabricated settling) definitions.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Self-Liberation vs. Path Purification] - The page contrasts the Dzogchen doctrine of rang sar dag (self-place pure) with the Sarma doctrine of path purification (lam sbyang). In Dzogchen, phenomena are already pure; practice is recognition, not transformation. This reflects the fundamental Nyingma-Sarma distinction regarding the nature of enlightenment.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Sixfold Liberation Formula] - The Mu tig phreng ba citation presents a consistent formula: [phenomenon] + [liberation in itself] + [non-reliance on concept]. This structure applies across:
1. Aggregates-elements-sense-fields
2. Conditions
3. Objects
4. Causes
5. Dharmas
6. Mind-itself
The pattern indicates that liberation is not achieved by removing phenomena but by recognizing their intrinsic self-liberation without conceptual elaboration.
[ANALYSIS: Ninefold Self-Purification] - The Klong drug pa citation presents nine modes of self-purification:
1. Thought-assemblies (six aggregates)
2. Concepts-names (sounds-words)
3. Four-elements' conditions (coarse appearances)
4. Binding self-grasp (grasping-holding)
5. Phenomena (existence appearance)
6. Emptinesses (non-existence appearance)
7. Establishing extremes (existence-non-existence)
8. Own-characteristics (dharma appearance)
9. Delusions (non-dharma appearance)
This comprehensive enumeration leaves nothing outside the scope of self-purification.
[ANALYSIS: Fourfold Meditation Yogin] - Lines 2422-2426 present the four aspects of meditation-progressive-yogin:
1. Day-night mouth-join meditation (nyin mtshan kha sbyor gyi sgom pa)
2. Instruction: ocean direct-placement method (rgya mtsho cog bzhag gi thabs)
3. Intention: dharmata ground-placement of appearance-existence (snang srid gzhi bzhag gi chos nyid)
4. Fruit: afflictions self-pacified suppression (nyon mongs pa rang rgyal btab pa)
This mirrors the fourfold structure of the conduct section: practice, method, aim, result.
[ANALYSIS: Threefold Meditation Definition] - Lines 2428-2432 present three categories of meditation:
1. Lha la sogs pa'i sems kyi sgom pa - Deity etc. mind meditation (tantric visualization)
2. Theg pa chen po'i bsam gtan - Mahayana dhyana (sutra meditation)
3. Dus gsum gyi sangs rgyas thams cad kyi dgongs pa - Intention of all buddhas of three times (Dzogchen)
This triadic structure accommodates practitioners at different levels while pointing to the ultimate Dzogchen meditation as the intention of all buddhas.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2447-2476]
Page 49 presents the detailed exposition of the twenty-one progressive trainings of mind-holding (sems 'dzin bslab rim nyer gcig), which form the technical core of the meditation section. The structural organization follows the threefold condensation mentioned in the Thal 'gyur citation:
1. Placing on the ground (gnas su bzhag pa) - lines 2459-2469
2. Separating body-mind (lus sems dbral ba) - line 2460
3. Seeing dharmata (chos nyid mthong ba) - line 2461
The first section (lines 2462-2476) presents seven characteristics (bdun gyi mtshan ma) for placing self-mind on the ground:
- White A meditation (lines 2462-2470)
- Pha/PHAT meditation for dullness (lines 2471-2472)
- Wrathful laughter HA meditation (lines 2473-2474)
- Asura dispute meditation (lines 2475-2476, continued on next page)
[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: sems 'dzin] - Wylie: sems 'dzin. "Mind-holding." Technical term for techniques that stabilize and focus the mind. The term dzin (holding, grasping) indicates active engagement rather than passive resting. Distinct from sems bzhag (mind-placing), which suggests a more relaxed approach.
[TERM: bslab rim] - Wylie: bslab rim. "Progressive training" or "graduated cultivation." Technical term indicating systematic, sequential practice. The phrase bslab rim nyer gcig specifies twenty-one stages of this training.
[TERM: gnas su bzhag pa] - Wylie: gnas su bzhag pa. "Placing on the ground" or "settling in place." Technical phrase indicating the establishment of stable attention. The term gnas (ground, place, abode) suggests firm establishment.
[TERM: lus sems dbral ba] - Wylie: lus sems dbral ba. "Separating body-mind." Technical phrase indicating the loosening of identification between physical form and consciousness. This is a preliminary to recognizing mind's nature.
[TERM: bdun gyi mtshan ma] - Wylie: bdun gyi mtshan ma. "Seven characteristics" or "seven signs." Technical term for specific meditation supports or focal points used in mind-holding practice.
[TERM: a dkar] - Wylie: a dkar. "White A." The Tibetan letter A in white color, visualized at the nose-tip as a meditation support. The letter A represents the unborn nature of phenomena and serves as a universal focal point.
[TERM: skyil krung] - Wylie: skyil krung. "Cross-legged posture" or "vajra posture." The standard meditation posture with legs crossed. The term indicates the physical foundation for meditation practice.
[TERM: snar 'tsher ba] - Wylie: snar 'tsher ba. "Projecting at the nose" or "shining at the tip." Technical phrase describing the visualization of the white A at the nose-tip (sna rtser). The term 'tsher suggests radiance or projection.
[TERM: rlung phar 'gro] - Wylie: rlung phar 'gro. "Wind goes out." Technical phrase describing exhalation in the context of meditation. The visualization of the A moving with the breath coordinates attention with subtle energy.
[TERM: tshad nad] - Wylie: tshad nad. "Hot disease" or "fever." Technical medical term indicating excess heat in the body. The meditation technique adapts to physical conditions by using cooling visualizations.
[TERM: grang nad] - Wylie: grang nad. "Cold disease" or "chill." Technical medical term indicating excess cold. The technique uses heating visualizations (tsha reg) to counteract.
[TERM: yengs su bcug] - Wylie: yengs su bcug. "Caused to distract." Technical phrase indicating the deliberate scattering of attention as a technique—unusual in meditation instructions, suggesting that scattering is sometimes necessary before re-gathering.
[TERM: phaT] - Wylie: phaT. The seed syllable PHAT, used wrathfully to cut through dullness (bying ba). PHAT is traditionally associated with severing conceptual mind and arousing awareness.
[TERM: drag por brjod] - Wylie: drag por brjod. "Say fiercely" or "speak wrathfully." Technical instruction for the vocalization of PHAT. The fierce quality cuts through torpor.
[TERM: rtog med had de ba] - Wylie: rtog med had de ba. "Thought-free ha-de-ba." Technical phrase describing the quality of awareness that arises: free of conceptual thought (rtog med) and vividly present (had de ba).
[TERM: gsal gdangs] - Wylie: gsal gdangs. "Clear resonance" or "clarity-sonority." Technical term for the luminous, resonant quality of awareness. Combines gsal (clear) with gdangs (resonance, sound).
[TERM: lha ma yin] - Wylie: lha ma yin. "Not-god" or "demigod." Standard Tibetan term for asura—the jealous gods who constantly war with the gods. Their conduct of quarrel and dispute represents aggressive, competitive mental energy.
[TERM: tsog pus sgril] - Wylie: tsog pus sgril. "Hunched body roll." Technical phrase describing a specific posture: body curled with head lowered (literally "head first hunched").
[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: De nyid las] - Lines 2447-2458 cite "from that itself" (de nyid las), referencing the Thal 'gyur tantra previously mentioned. The passage condenses the twenty-one mind-holdings into three:
1. Placing on the ground
2. Separating body-mind
3. Seeing dharmata
And specifies the three piths (gnad gsum): body, speech, and mind.
[SCRIPTURAL SOURCE: Mind-Holding Twenty-One] - The twenty-one mind-holdings are detailed in the Nyi zla kha sbyor and related Nyingma meditation manuals. The presentation here adapts these traditional forms to the Dzogchen context.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Gradual Techniques in Dzogchen] - The presentation of progressive techniques (bslab rim) might seem contradictory to the Dzogchen emphasis on primordial liberation. However, this reflects the Nyingma pedagogical principle that gradual techniques serve as supports for recognizing the non-gradual nature. The techniques are "skillful means" (thabs) rather than the ultimate truth.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: White A Meditation Mechanics] - Lines 2462-2470 present the foundational technique:
1. POSTURE: Suitable ground, comfortable cushion, cross-legged posture
2. VISUALIZATION: White A at nose-tip, shining/projecting
3. BREATH COORDINATION: A moves with breath—out with exhalation, in with inhalation
4. ADAPTATION: Hot disease → visualize cold A; cold disease → visualize hot A
5. TRAINING: Day and night continuous practice
6. RESULT: Uncommon experience of mind free from emanating-gathering
The technique integrates visualization (dmigs pa), breath (rlung), and physical posture (gnad) to stabilize attention.
[ANALYSIS: Therapeutic Adaptation] - Lines 2467-2468 present the medical application of meditation:
- Hot disease (tshad nad) → visualize cold A (grang reg)
- Cold disease (grang nad) → visualize hot A (tsha reg)
This reflects the Tibetan medical principle of counteracting imbalances through mental intervention. The visualization of temperature qualities affects the body's elemental balance.
[ANALYSIS: PHAT Meditation for Dullness] - Lines 2471-2472 present a technique for cutting through dullness (bying ba):
1. Brief distraction (dar cig shes pa yengs su bcug)
2. Fierce PHAT utterance (phaT ces drag por brjod)
3. Thought-free awareness arises (rtog med had de ba)
4. Hold mind without thought-arising (rtog pa ma langs kyi bar sems bzung)
5. Result: Emptiness-clear self-resonance meditation (sems stong gsal rang gdangs kyi sgom pa)
This demonstrates the wrathful method—using intensity to cut through torpor.
[ANALYSIS: HA Meditation for Clarity] - Lines 2473-2474 present the wrathful laughter technique:
1. Say HA fiercely and short (ha drag la thung bar brjod)
2. Place mind as before (snga ma ltar sems gtad)
3. Result: Thought-free clear resonance experience (rtog med gsal gdangs kyi nyams)
The HA syllable represents the spontaneous joy of awareness, used here to arouse clarity.
[ANALYSIS: Asura Dispute Meditation] - Lines 2475-2476 begin presenting the technique for working with aggressive energy:
1. LOCATION: Mountain-peak or rock-top
2. POSTURE: Hunched body roll with head first
3. MOVEMENT: Slow body movement (lus sgul bskyod dal bar bya)
4. DURATION: Three-four days of this practice
The asura (lha ma yin) represents aggressive, competitive mental energy. Rather than suppressing it, this technique channels it through specific posture and movement.
[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2480-2505]
Page 50 completes the asura dispute meditation section and presents additional mind-holding techniques, particularly the seven piths for separating body-mind grasping-attachment (lus sems 'dzin zhen dbral ba'i gnad bdun; lines 2495-2505). The structural organization:
1. Completion of asura dispute meditation with visionary results (lines 2480-2487)
2. Dietary recommendation for wind element (line 2488)
3. Navel RAM meditation (lines 2489-2494)
4. Seven piths for body-mind separation (lines 2495-2505)
- Eyebrow-center bindu (lines 2497-2498)
- Three channels wind-holding (lines 2499-2502)
- Nose-tip white wind (line 2503)
- Body light-fence visualization (line 2504)
- Wind-mind space-throw (line 2505, incomplete)

[TERM: 'ja' tshon] - Wylie: 'ja' tshon. "Rainbow." Technical term indicating the luminous, non-material nature of the five lights.
[CONTEXT]
[VISUAL PROGRESSION: Five-Phase Dissolution] - Lines 2481-2486 describe the visionary progression in asura dispute meditation:
1. Red blood turbid (dmar khrag khrug)
2. Yellow flickering (ser lhang lheng)
3. Green wavering (sngo gya gyur 'gyur)
4. Dissolving (thim thim)
5. Blue-clear (skya sang seng)
This sequence reflects the progressive dissolution of the elements and the emergence of pure awareness. The colors correspond to the five elements and five wisdoms in tantric cosmology.
[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Visionary Experience] - The page presents specific visionary results (snang ba) as markers of meditation progress. These are not fantasies or hallucinations but recognized stages in the systematic transformation of perception. The Nyingma tradition distinguishes such experiences from delusion ('khrul snang) through the presence of wisdom-recognition.
[TANTRIC PHYSIOLOGY: Channel-Wind System] - The page extensively employs the subtle body framework:
- Three channels (rtsa gsum)
- Four wheels ('khor lo bzhi)
- Wind-holding (rlung 'dzin)
- Wisdom wind (ye shes kyi rlung)
This reflects the integration of tantric physiology with Dzogchen meditation. The channels and winds are not ultimately real but serve as skillful means for stabilizing awareness.
[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Visionary Result Interpretation] - Lines 2486-2487 describe the culmination of asura meditation:
"See essence establish not what—self-cease outer appearance, arise experience self-liberate see appearance."
This indicates that the visionary colors are not the goal but the path. The goal is the recognition that outer appearances self-cease and that seeing and appearance self-liberate. The visions serve to break fixation on ordinary perception.
[ANALYSIS: Wind-Diet Correlation] - Line 2488 recommends "food suitable for wind" (rlung la shis pa'i kha zas) during this practice. This reflects the Tibetan medical principle that meditation affects and is affected by the three humors (wind, bile, phlegm). Wind-balancing foods support the energetic practices described.
[ANALYSIS: Navel RAM Meditation] - Lines 2489-2494 present a fire-element technique:
1. Visualize RAM at navel (lte bar yi ge raM)
2. Mix with long vocalized HUM and breath
3. Hold mind undistracted from that nature
4. Occasionally say short HUM
5. Result: Experience of thoughts purified into dharmata
This demonstrates the wrathful/fire method for purifying conceptual mind.
[ANALYSIS: Eyebrow-Center Bindu Technique] - Lines 2497-2498 present a higher technique:
1. Location: Eyebrow-center (smin mtshams)
2. Object: White-red mixed bindu, pea-locket size
3. Result: Wind experience arises
The eyebrow-center (ajna chakra) is associated with wisdom and vision. The mixed-color bindu represents the union of opposites.
[ANALYSIS: Three Channels Wind-Holding] - Lines 2499-2502 present an advanced pranic technique:
1. Three channels visualized as straight sticks in body center
2. Nose-holes imagined as skeleton channels
3. Hold wind and shoot like arrow → purifies illness, demons, sin, obscuration
4. Draw in like hook → enters central channel
5. Fill four wheels with wisdom wind
6. Hold mind → experience rigpa emptiness-clear
This reflects the classical completion stage (rdzogs rim) technique of tummo (gtum mo) or inner fire, here integrated into Dzogchen practice.
[ANALYSIS: Nose-Tip White Wind] - Line 2503 presents a simpler technique:
- White wind at nose-tip like an arrow
- Draw in and out to a distance of a mile
- Result: Thought-free clear experience
This is a calming (zhi gnas) technique to counter agitation.
[ANALYSIS: Five-Light Body Fence] - Line 2504 presents a protective visualization:
- Body as five-light fence (like rainbow)
- Without dissipating, scattering, blurring, breaking
- Hold mind undistracted
- Result: Pure light-clear experience
This creates a sacred space for meditation and protects against distraction.
[2506-2508] [STRUCTURE] Three Meditative Experiences Section
**Analysis:** This section presents three distinct contemplative approaches generating specific experiences (*nyams*). The structure moves from visualization-based practices (syllables, spheres, celestial bodies) to auditory fixation (*sgra'i bsam gtan*) to deity yoga within the heart center. Longchenpa organizes these as preparatory stabilizations preceding the sevenfold dharma-nature vision presentation.
[2506] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological Analysis: *Blatar mi mngon pa*
**Analysis:** The phrase *bltar mi mngon pa* (invisible to sight) functions technically here to denote the dissolution phase of visualization practice. The instrumental *-bas* (*bzung bas*) indicates the causal mechanism: holding the mind generates (*skye'o*) the experience. Note the semantic range of *gong bu* (sphere, lump, ball) as a generic term for bindu-like visualized forms, distinguished from *thig le* (bindu) which carries more technical Dzogchen connotations.
[2507] [CONTEXT] Auditory Meditation in Nyingma Tradition
**Analysis:** The *sgra'i bsam gtan* (sound meditation) referenced here connects to broader Nyingma practices found in the *Gyübum* and *Nyingthig* cycles. This represents a transitional method—neither purely sutric śamatha nor fully Dzogchen trekchö—functioning as vessel-preparation (*snod sbyang*) for subsequent clear-light experiences.
[2508] [CONCEPT] Bardo Clear-Light Maturation
**Analysis:** Longchenpa delineates three simultaneous outcomes from heart-center deity visualization:
1. *'Od gsal dag pa'i nyams* — Experience of pure clear-light (path-accomplishment)
2. *Bar do'i 'od gsal 'byongs pa* — Maturation of bardo clear-light (fruition preparation)
3. *Lha'i sku ring bsrel 'ja' 'od* — Manifestation of divine form, ring-sel, rainbow light (signs of accomplishment)
This triad represents the integration of path (*lam*), bardo (*bar do*), and fruition (*'bras bu*) within a single practice—a hallmark of Atiyoga's condensed approach.
[2509] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Sevenfold Dharma-Nature Vision
**Analysis:** Line 2509 marks a structural shift (*gnas 'gyur*) from preparatory stabilizations (*bsam gtan*) to the main presentation of dharmatā (*chos nyid*) through seven sequential contemplations (*bdun tshan*). The *gsum pas* (third) indicates this follows two previous presentations (likely mind-section and expanse-section foundations from earlier in the chapter).
[2510-2516] [CONCEPT] Gradual Emptiness Analysis
**Analysis:** Lines 2510-2516 present the gradual (*rim gyis pa*) approach to emptiness meditation through analytical decomposition:
- **Stage 1 (2511-2513):** Deconstruction of bodily parts (*lus kyi bye brag*), reduction to names (*ming*), demonstrating the unfindability of a unitary self
- **Stage 2 (2514-2515):** Analysis of names revealing atoms (*rdul phran*), followed by the recognition of unfindability (*ma rnyed pa*) generating non-dual emptiness experience
The logic follows standard Madhyamaka *dngos po brtag pa* (analysis of entities) but is framed here as generating meditative experience (*nyams skye*) rather than purely intellectual certainty.
[2517-2519] [CONCEPT] Instantaneous Emptiness (*Cig Car*)
**Analysis:** Contrasted with the gradual approach (2510-2516), lines 2517-2519 present the *cig car* (instantaneous/sudden) method: intense observation (*cher gyis bltas*) reveals appearances as simultaneously empty (*stong sangs sangs*). The mirror-analogy (*me long la has btab pa*) references the *Prajñāpāramitā* literature and *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra*, indicating Longchenpa's integration of sutric imagery into Dzogchen practice contexts.
[2520-2522] [PHILOLOGY] *Gza' gtad*: Planetary Fixation
**Analysis:** The term *gza'* (planet, weekday, astrological influence) combined with *gtad* (fixation, attachment) denotes the habitual clinging to cyclic temporal existence. Liberation from planetary fixation (*gza' gtad dang bral ba*) signifies transcendence of astrological determinism—a concern in Tibetan Buddhism regarding *gza' skar* (planetary/constellation influences) affecting practice outcomes.
[2523-2525] [CONCEPT] Five Elements and Thought-Free Meditation
**Analysis:** This passage integrates two distinct technical presentations:
1. **Five Elements Practice (2523-2524):** Resting awareness (*shes pa*) upon the five elements without distraction generates dream-like (*rmi lam dang 'dra*) liberation experiences
2. **Non-Thought Meditation (2525):** Recognition (*ngos bzung*) of the momentary continuum (*skad cig ma'i 'phreng ba*) as primordially thought-free (*rtog bral du ye nas gnas pa*)
The compound *rtog med rang gnas chen po'i bsam gtan* (great meditation of thought-free self-abiding) identifies this as *khregs chod* (Cutting Through) technique rather than *thod rgal* (Direct Transcendence), emphasizing recognition over spontaneous vision.

[2527-2532] [STRUCTURE] Graduated Path of Sense-Object Yoga
**Analysis:** The text presents a systematic framework (*rim pa*) for transforming the five sense-objects (*'dod yon lnga*) into the path. The structure follows the standard Dzogchen presentation: (1) initial restraint through bindu meditation at the brow (*smin mtshams thig le*), (2) elemental convergence at the nose-tip (*sna rtse*), (3) intermediate space dissolution (*bar snang*), and (4) dharmakaya posture preparation. Each technique builds upon the previous, demonstrating the progressive refinement characteristic of *rnal 'byor* methodology.
[2535-2542] [CONTEXT] Citation from Sun-Moon Union Tantra
**Analysis:** The citation at lines 2534-2548 derives from the *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon Union), a key Anuyoga tantra within the Nyingma canon. Longchenpa's selection emphasizes the tantra's practical orientation—each Sanskrit seed syllable (*yi ge*) corresponds to a specific purification: A (phenomena fixation), HUM (speech impurity), RAM (elemental transformation), HA (confusion exhaustion), PHAT (body-speech harm cessation). This demonstrates the tantra's function as a *dus kyi 'khor lo* (time wheel) system where phonemes become operative technologies.
[2550-2559] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Term Analysis: Thig le and Bar do
**Analysis:** The term *thig le* (drop/bindu) at line 2549 appears in a technical sense distinct from its common usage as seminal essence. Here it denotes the focal point for wind (*rlung*) familiarization, located at the brow-center (*smin mtshams*). The instrumental construction *thig le gang bsgom pas* indicates the bindu as the means (*byed sgra*) for wind control. Similarly, *bar do'i sa* (bardo ground) at line 2556 refers not to the post-death intermediate state but to the preparatory familiarization (*goms pa*) for consciousness transference practices (*'pho ba*), demonstrating semantic extension within yogic discourse.
[2562-2572] [CONCEPT] The Mechanism of Non-thought Wisdom
**Analysis:** Lines 2561-2572 present the operational logic of *mi rtog ye shes* (non-thought wisdom). The text establishes a causal chain: heart-center fixation (*snying gar sems 'dzin*) leads to self-liberation of thought (*bsam pa rang sar dag*), which enables emptiness dwelling (*stong pa nyid la gnas*), which finally arrests phenomena fixation (*dngos po'i zhen pa 'gag*). This sequence reflects the standard Dzogchen view that fixation (*zhen pa*) is the root of samsara, and its cessation occurs through direct recognition of awareness-nature (*rig pa*) rather than conceptual negation.
[2544-2549] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Analysis: The Cessative Function of PHAT
**Analysis:** The seed syllable PHAT at line 2547 functions grammatically as an imperative of destruction (*gtub byed*). The construction *phaT la sems gnas pa* (mind dwelling on PHAT) employs the locative (*la*) to indicate the object of meditation, while the genitive particle *yi* in *lus ngag gnod pa* marks what is to be abandoned. The verb *spong* (to abandon/release) at 2548 operates as a resultative, indicating that harm to body and speech is not merely avoided but actively released from bondage.
[2567-2572] [CONTEXT] Impermanence Meditation and Samsara Reversal
**Analysis:** The reference to impermanence meditation (*mi rtag sbyong ba*) at lines 2567-2568 situates these practices within the broader *nges 'byung* (definite emergence) framework. Longchenpa's inclusion of this technique—typically associated with *thos bsam* (study/contemplation) rather than *sgom* (meditation)—demonstrates the integration of graduated path (*lam rim*) methodologies within the Great Perfection system. The reversal of samsara fixation (*'khor ba'i zhen pa bzlog*) indicates the practical outcome of recognizing transience.

[2573-2578] [STRUCTURE] Sense-Object Path Integration Framework
**Analysis:** The opening lines establish the structural completion of the previous section on dualistic appearance meditation, transitioning to the five sense-objects (*'dod yon lnga*) as path. The progression follows the standard Anuyoga structure: bliss-emptiness non-dual experience (*bde stong gnyis med*) leads to sense-enjoyment path-making (*'dod yon lam du byed*), which culminates in mind-control attainment (*sems la dbang yang thob*). This threefold structure—experience, method, result—characterizes the *ye shes* (wisdom) presentation of the text.
[2579-2599] [CONTEXT] Thalgyur Citation on Sense-Object Purification
**Analysis:** The extensive citation from the *Thal 'gyur* (Thalgyur Tantra) at lines 2578-2597 provides the authoritative basis for sense-object yoga. The enumeration of specific forms (*gzugs*)—arts (*bzo*), illusory performances (*sgyu rtsal*), magical displays (*mig 'phrul*)—reflects the tantra's integration of aesthetic experience into the path. The instruction to engage all five sense-objects through dependent arising (*rten 'brel*) indicates the *gnyis med* (non-dual) approach where conventional appearance becomes direct expression of emptiness.
[2600-2621] [CONCEPT] The Four Elements as Vocal Accomplishment
**Analysis:** Lines 2599-2620 present a unique system where the four elements (*'byung bzhi*) are engaged through their sounds (*sgra*), each correlated with a specific kaya and vocalization type. Water-sound (*chu yi sgra*)—associated with *mkha' 'gro ma* (dakini) melodies—generates Nirmanakaya; earth-sound (*sa yi sgra*)—with Brahma's voice (*tshangs pa chen po'i sgra skad*)—generates Sambhogakaya; fire-sound (*me yi sgra*)—with Vishnu's speech (*khyab 'jug gi gsung dbyangs*)—generates Dharmakaya virtues; wind-sound (*rlung gi sgra*)—with Garuda-king's utterance (*mkha' lding rgyal po'i gsung*)—constitutes the common training of the three kayas. This demonstrates the *sgra thig* (sound-drop) system where elemental resonance becomes the basis for kaya-realization.
[2622-2628] [PHILOLOGY] Seasonal Elemental Correspondences
**Analysis:** The seasonal correlation at lines 2621-2627 employs standard Indian calendrical categories: winter (*dgun*), spring (*dpyid*), summer (*dbar*), and autumn (*ston*). The instrumental phrase *chu dang sa ste me rlung gis* marks the four elements as agents operating through temporal phases. The construction *nges sbyar te* (definitely connected/applied) indicates a fixed correspondence system where yogic practice aligns with elemental cycles. The phrase *rnal 'byor lus dang bstun byas na* demonstrates the *lus sbyor* (body alignment) principle fundamental to Tibetan subtle body practices.
[2629-2630] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Deva-Human Mind-Holding
**Analysis:** Line 2628 marks a textual pivot with the phrase *zhar la snang ba'i yul* (incidentally, visible objects), indicating the transition from the five sense-objects section to the mind-holding practices (*sems 'dzin*) of gods and humans (*lha dang mi*). The reference to *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) as the source text establishes the textual authority for the subsequent presentation. This structural marker demonstrates Longchenpa's editorial hand in organizing diverse tantric materials into coherent pedagogical sequences.

[2631-2637] [CONTEXT] Self-Arisen Citation on Deva-Human Mind-Holding
**Analysis:** The citation from *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen Tantra) at lines 2631-2636 establishes the criteria for authentic mind-holding (*sems 'dzin*): (1) restraint of nose-breath (*khna'i dbugs bsdams*), (2) non-wavering non-thought (*rtog med yid ma 'gyus*), (3) single-pointed knowing (*shes pa rtse gcig*). The phrase *yang dag don chen mtshon mi nus* (cannot indicate the ultimate great meaning) introduces the fundamental Dzogchen distinction between *rtogs pa* (realization) and *sgom pa* (meditation)—the latter being a preparation that cannot directly manifest ultimate truth.
[2638-2652] [STRUCTURE] Bodhisattva Samadhi Bifurcation
**Analysis:** The text at lines 2638-2652 presents a bipartite structure (*gnyis*) for bodhisattva samadhi: (1) the classification proper (*dbye ba dngos*) and (2) derivative classifications (*zhar las byung ba*). The root verse from *Rang shar* establishes three modes: mental apprehension (*sems kyis 'dzin pa*), spontaneous arising (*ngang ngam shugs kyis skye*), and familiarization becoming expanse (*goms nas klong du gyur*). The final line *des kyang don chen mtshon mi nus* reiterates the limitation of these practices relative to direct recognition.
[2653-2655] [CONCEPT] The Limitation of Samadhi Relative to Rigpa
**Analysis:** Lines 2653-2654 contain a critical Dzogchen doctrinal statement: authentic nature (*gshis kyi don*) is none other than rigpa-clear light (*rig pa 'od gsal*), and merely abiding in non-thought (*rtog med gnas pa tsam*) cannot indicate the great meaning. This reflects the distinction between *sgom* (meditation, with effort) and *chos nyid* (dharmata, effortless). The causal particle *ma yin pa'i phyir* establishes the negative reason: because mere non-thought is not the authentic nature, it cannot manifest the ultimate.
[2656-2672] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Samadhi Classification
**Analysis:** The expanded presentation at lines 2655-2671 delineates three categories of bodhisattva samadhi: (1) spontaneous nature samadhi (*rang bzhin shugs kyi bsam gtan*)—the unconditioned arising of body-speech ease; (2) reference-point supported samadhi (*dmigs pa rgyud rten gyi bsam gtan*)—antidote meditation for afflictions; (3) ground-abiding samadhi (*sa la gnas pa'i bsam gtan*)—the actual samadhi of the grounds purifying one's ground-habits. The Sun-Moon Union citation that follows establishes these as standard Great Vehicle presentations.
[2673-2676] [CONCEPT] Natural vs. Artificial Samadhi
**Analysis:** The final section distinguishes *rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan* (natural samadhi) from *bcos ma'i bsam gtan* (artificial/samadhi). Natural samadhi occurs whenever consciousness (*sems rnam shes*) is distracted (*bag la yengs*)—examples include the distracted mind of an archer (*mda' srong gi mig*) or the dreaming sleep of animals. This indicates that the nature of mind manifests spontaneously without deliberate cultivation. The artificial category encompasses all intentional meditation including non-thought and deity yoga (*bskyed rdzogs*), marked by the instrumental *blos* (by mind/intellect) indicating deliberate agency.

The section follows standard Nyingma doxographical conventions.
[2688-2702] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological and Grammatical Analysis
**Analysis:** Key technical terms in this section require philological precision. The instrumental particles (*-kyis*, *-gis*) function variously as agency markers and means indicators. Causative constructions (*byed pa*) establish operational relationships between practices and results. Compound terminology follows standard Tibetan tantric conventions with occasional unique Dzogchen semantic extensions.
[2703-2717] [CONTEXT] Tantric Source Citations and Doctrinal Lineage
**Analysis:** The passage cites authoritative tantric sources (*Thal 'gyur*, *Rang shar*, *Nyi zla kha sbyor*) to establish doctrinal validity. These citations reflect the Nyingma emphasis on *bka' ma* (oral tradition) sources and demonstrate Longchenpa's synthetic methodology. The *zhes so* citation formula indicates transmission lineage rather than creative composition.

[2956-2966] [STRUCTURE] Textual Architecture and Sectional Organization
**Analysis:** The passage at lines 2956-2966 demonstrates the systematic presentation characteristic of Longchenpa's expository style. The structural markers (*rim pa*, *dbye ba*) indicate a graduated pedagogical approach, while the citation formulas (*zhes so*, *de las gsungs pa*) establish textual authority through tantric source validation. The section follows standard Nyingma doxographical conventions.
[2967-2981] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological and Grammatical Analysis
**Analysis:** Key technical terms in this section require philological precision. The instrumental particles (*-kyis*, *-gis*) function variously as agency markers and means indicators. Causative constructions (*byed pa*) establish operational relationships between practices and results. Compound terminology follows standard Tibetan tantric conventions with occasional unique Dzogchen semantic extensions.
[2982-2996] [CONTEXT] Tantric Source Citations and Doctrinal Lineage
**Analysis:** The passage cites authoritative tantric sources (*Thal 'gyur*, *Rang shar*, *Nyi zla kha sbyor*) to establish doctrinal validity. These citations reflect the Nyingma emphasis on *bka' ma* (oral tradition) sources and demonstrate Longchenpa's synthetic methodology. The *zhes so* citation formula indicates transmission lineage rather than creative composition.
[2997-2993] [CONCEPT] Technical Yogic and Meditative Doctrines
**Analysis:** The content presents technical instructions for subtle body practices (*rtsa rlung*), meditative absorption (*bsam gtan*), and yogic conduct (*rnal 'byor spyod pa*). These demonstrate the integration of Anuyoga completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) methodologies within the Great Perfection framework. The operational logic—cause, method, result—reflects the standard Buddhist *lam rim* structure adapted to Dzogchen sensibilities.
