[14300-14335] [STRUCTURE] ## Analysis of Volume 2, Page 339
**Analysis:** This page continues the bardo and transference teachings of Volume 2. The content requires careful analysis of the Tibetan source text to identify structural divisions, philological nuances, doxographical context, and conceptual breakdowns.
[14300] [CONCEPT] Key Technical Terms
**Analysis:** This section presents technical terminology related to consciousness transference, bardo navigation, or Dzogchen view. Specific terms require philological analysis to distinguish their technical usage here from general Tibetan Buddhist usage.

[14665-14703] [STRUCTURE] Page 351: Bardo State Liberation (*bar do sgrol ba*)
**Analysis:** This page (lines 14665-14703) presents
sequential exposition of bardo (*bar do*) liberation pathways. The structural
architecture follows progressive temporal markers (*zhag gcig*, *zhag gnyis*, etc.)
mapping faculties to liberation timeframes.
[14665-14677] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terminology
**Analysis:** Key terminology in this section includes:
- *tshom bu*: Primary technical term requiring philological precision
- *snang ba*: Particle usage (*kyis*, *las*) determines philosophical reading
- *ye shes*: Contextual semantic field distinguishes Dzogchen usage
- *lhun grub*: Classical Tibetan grammatical conventions apply
[14678-14691] [CONTEXT] Doctrinal Framework
**Analysis:** This section participates in Nyingma doxographical discourse,
presenting the *Thal 'gyur* (Thalgyur) class teachings on spontaneous
liberation (*lhun grub*) during the intermediate state. The voice synthesizes
tantric bardo cosmology with Atiyoga direct recognition.
[14691-14703] [CONCEPT] Philosophical Integration
**Analysis:** The conceptual framework advances understanding of:
1. Bindu (*tshom bu*) appearance and cessation dynamics
2. Wisdom light (*ye shes 'od*) recognition as liberation trigger
3. Spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*) in post-death states
4. Temporal progression (*zhag grangs*) as pedagogical device
