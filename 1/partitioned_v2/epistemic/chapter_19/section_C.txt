[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL EXPRESSION DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CAUSAL ATTTRIBUTION]
<Thus essence kayas three not established, nature five wisdoms not established, compassion emanations not established. Not established from where arise? From ground's power natural expression. Natural expression not other than ground, ground not other than natural expression. Self-appearances ground's play, play not different from player. The display arises spontaneously without cause, not from something other than itself. Risk of causal attribution: seeking a cause for appearance rather than recognizing spontaneous presence.>
[16564-16575] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MANDALA COMPONENTS MANIFESTATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: COSMOLOGICAL REIFICATION]
<Light and color's expanse: center, retinue, individual clusters, body, wisdom, father, mother, body color, hand marks etc. clear. Secret seed essence from, essence nature's appearance. The mandala components (center, retinue, deities) are spontaneous manifestations of the ground, not constructed realities. Risk of cosmological reification: treating these as actual celestial realms rather than the self-display of awareness.>
[16614-16625] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE FAMILIES PURE REALM]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIAL LITERALISM]
<Five families' field appearance, nature pure, five lights' appearance self-clear, great enjoyment five wisdoms' aspect engaging, afflictions' pain all free. These also from Jewel Heap: "Self-clear pure sambhogakaya, five lights pure measureless palace, elaboration-free great bliss speech, body five families' retinue, entity not pure dharmas, wisdom five gathered heart from issued." The five families' pure realm is the nature of mind, not a location. Risk of spatial literalism: reading this as geographical place rather than the spontaneous display of wisdom.>
[16672-16683] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION BODY DEFINITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: FUNCTIONAL REDUCTIONISM]
<Essence, definitive term, division, enumeration four: essence—various not fixed, essence's abiding manner, attachment free, samadhi mind non-conceptual mode equally abiding. Definitive term: whatever tames thus emanated, emanation; that suitable appearance form perfect, body. The definition points to what spontaneously manifests for beings' benefit, not a functional role. Risk of functional reductionism: reducing emanation to mere utility rather than recognizing its nature as ground's display.>
[16729-16740] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE BUDDHA FIELDS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: HIERARCHICAL SPATIALIZATION]
<Akanistha, Abhirati, Glorious, Lotus Stacked, Las-rab-rdzogs-pa five, five families' pure Buddha appearance benefit. Also magical emanation tamed's power doing, emanation body dharmakaya nature pure field teacher five families and, Jambudvipa here glorious Vajradhara great, marks birth four's body arose, activity thirty-six completion accepted. Field thousand three-thousand's thousand ten-million fields etc. Brahma great kalpa one included authority. Abode flowers lotus thousand possessing, retinue birth four included beings. The five Buddha fields represent aspects of awareness, not hierarchical locations. Risk of hierarchical spatialization: ranking these fields as better/worse rather than recognizing them as non-dual display.>
[16770-16781] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE PERFECTED ACTIVITIES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ATTRIBUTION ERROR]
<Fourth enumeration extensively explained: body speech mind qualities activity five: body beings whatever desired appearance, each part marks signs perfect; speech limbs sixty's sound meter connection good; mind as it is and as many knowing vast; qualities powers etc. dharmas all knowing complete; activity outer inner secret three's dharma wheel perfect five nature turn. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Emanation body also body speech mind, qualities activity five." Body marks and signs, tamed whoever arose body emanation; speech word connection good. These describe spontaneous display, not attained qualities. Risk of attribution error: treating these as qualities possessed rather than natural expression.>
[16807-16818] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE PERFECTED TEACHER]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PERSONIFICATION]
<Dharma perfected, nature Great Perfection, secret unsurpassed tantra essence seven, time perfected self-conditions pure time taught. Thus indicating teacher emanation body all outer inner secret perfected five five should know. Meaning two: wisdom's abode particular explanation three: essence—self-rigpa's nature elaboration free. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Concept free dharmata self-resonance from, objective-free wisdom appearance dawns." The perfected teacher is the spontaneous display, not a person. Risk of personification: attributing these qualities to an individual rather than recognizing the ground's nature.>
[16841-16852] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL COMPASSION ENERGY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VOLUNTARISM]
<Beings delusion circling lower classes from, tamed and tamer not suitable, ground abiding wisdom outer appearance dawned. Samsara as long beings' benefit arises, nature energy's compassion deep clear knowing perfect from arose. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Dharmakaya empty nature from, wisdom knowing perfect part, energy beings to dawns, that not samsara nirvana classes, knowing knows and clear, self-knowing clear self-nature from, nature energy's compassion." Compassion is spontaneous energy, not willed. Risk of voluntarism: treating compassion as cultivated or chosen rather than ground's natural expression.>
[16886-16897] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ULTIMATE DHARMATA KNOWING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: COGNITIVE APPROPRIATION]
<Ultimate dharmata knowing empty and, marks not and, clear light dharma evident. That also from Spontaneous Liberation: "Emanation body knowing objects, as knowing entity's, mode self's benefit knows, as many tamed's, thought as abides knows, thus compassion's dawning manner, tamed's beings various, tamer body also that much." The knowing is dharmata's self-recognition, not cognition. Risk of cognitive appropriation: treating this as a form of knowledge acquisition rather than empty-clear self-recognition.>
[16923-16934] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-KNOWING THREE WISDOMS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ENUMERATIVE SUBSTANTIALISM]
<Self-abode kadag's dharmadhatu self-knowing clear dharmadhatu pure aspect abiding. From Lamp Illuminating: "Truly perfected Buddha, wisdom aspect three: aspect all knowing, all knowing wisdom, ground abiding wisdom. Emanation body's wisdom two: as knowing mode knows, as many other benefit, sambhogakaya wisdom side's, clear light self-appearance known clear." The three wisdoms describe one self-knowing, not separate entities. Risk of enumerative substantialism: treating the three wisdoms as countable substances rather than aspects of non-dual recognition.>
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE KAYA DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: MULTIPLICATIVE REIFICATION]
<From Lion Perfected Great Perfection Tantra: "Buddhas' body and, speech and mind mandala and, qualities activity five appearance." Second: body and, speech and, mind and, qualities and, activity five's thorough divisions. The five are classifications of one display, not five separate things. Risk of multiplicative reification: counting body, speech, mind, qualities, activity as five distinct existences rather than descriptions of non-dual ground.>
