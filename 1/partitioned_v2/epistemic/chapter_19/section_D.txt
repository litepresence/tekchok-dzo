[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE KAYA DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: MULTIPLICATIVE REIFICATION]
<From Lion Perfected Great Perfection Tantra: "Buddhas' body and, speech and mind mandala and, qualities activity five appearance." Second: body and, speech and, mind and, qualities and, activity five's thorough divisions. The five are classifications of one display, not five separate things. Risk of multiplicative reification: counting body, speech, mind, qualities, activity as five distinct existences rather than descriptions of non-dual ground.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: LINGUISTIC LITERALISM]
<Meaning actually not aspect appearance, tamed's merit and Buddha's blessings gathering from sound also syllables self-characteristic not. From Tantra Supreme Continuation: "Victorious ones' speech that, echo like letters not. As echo's sound, other's consciousness from arose, concept not and made not, thus Tathagata's speech, other's consciousness from arose, concept not and remember not."

From that itself: "Qualities essence all produce, qualities definitive term various accomplish, division aspect three shown: ground abiding qualities, path appearing qualities, end guiding qualities."

Pacifying and enriching, likewise empowering and wrathful explained. Pacifying dharmata dharmadhatu gathers, enriching various essence shows, empowering unripened ripened makes."
