[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COMPASSION WISDOM GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DUALISTIC FUNCTIONALISM]
<Compassion wisdom two's dawning ground do, object and aspect actual meet not. From Spontaneous Liberation: "That also essence body abiding, dharma and sambhogakaya enjoyment emanation's part, not divided doing not manner, momentum established from, body color etc. mind object not, nature dawning light's manner, white red yellow and green blue, marks appearance not, appearance not knowing's momentum established, compassion dawning various from." Compassion and wisdom are non-dual, not functional complements. Risk of dualistic functionalism: treating compassion and wisdom as separate functions that work together rather than inseparable aspects of the ground.>
[16176-16187] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KADAG SEED ABIDING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: POTENTIALITY ERROR]
<Kadag time this actual, who not, part seed's manner abiding. From Six Expanse: "Essence nature and, compassion's appearance pure, childish intellects appearance, essence whatsoever not established, nature appearance aspect clear appearance, compassion's part wisdom two, doer and doing not dawned, dawn appearance intellect level two's for, wisdom activity thus." The seed metaphor describes primordial completion, not potential awaiting development. Risk of potentiality error: treating the seed as potential to be actualized rather than always-already perfect.>
[16219-16230] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – APPEARANCE WITHOUT PROLIFERATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]
<Self-face existence non-existence's proliferation ceased, body and wisdom even not established, other-appearance Buddha's compassion and, tamed's aspiration form body activity with appearance, space bird's offering pillar and jewel and wish-fulfilling tree like desire. From Avatamsaka: "Peace body wish-fulfilling tree like clear becomes, mind-jewel as non-conceptual, liberation in between world benefit always, this proliferation free appearance is." Here also kadag's self-face that like, subtle wisdom dharmadhatu exists from body and wisdom dawns. The freedom from proliferation is not non-existence. Risk of nihilism: interpreting non-establishment as utter void rather than freedom from conceptual extremes.>
[16255-16266] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE KAYA LUMINOSITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: HIERARCHICAL TRIPARTITION]
<Essence nature compassion's self, wisdom body three light clear, sky sun dawn darkness dispels, wisdom five's marks clear, Buddha emanation immeasurable arise. Body two divisions: ground kadag and spontaneous presence non-dual rigpa, path dharmadhatu and wisdom two experience, result dharmakaya aspect two dawned benefit completion. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Dharmakaya form body clear." The three kayas are descriptions of one nature, not hierarchical levels. Risk of hierarchical tripartition: treating the three kayas as graduated stages rather than simultaneous aspects.>
[16299-16310] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BUDDHA EXCLUSIVE DHARMAS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ATTRIBUTION ERROR]
<Muni only's non-mixed dharmas, eighteen explained whatever and, aspect all knowing and, dharmakaya called. Marks thirty-two and, signs eighty's self this, great vehicle near enjoyment for, muni's sambhogakaya body intended. Whoever samsara as long as, beings benefit various. The eighteen exclusive dharmas and marks describe recognition, not attainments. Risk of attribution error: treating these as qualities possessed by a Buddha rather than descriptions of non-dual recognition.>
[16352-16363] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RESULT NON-RESULT]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CONTRADICTION]
<Lama early ones say: result not say, result three bodies attachment's extreme holding free make intended, or three circles sheath final that refute intended, contradiction removal done, meaning result place also, kadag's inner dharmadhatu's essence not intended transformation is, very mistaken not good. Here before accepted as path appearance also is, result also is not contradictory think, first path appearance is, spontaneous presence sheath kadag great that meaning result house like from, there enter and there from open ground kadag outer appearance dawns must. The apparent contradiction between result and non-result is resolved in non-dual view. Risk of contradiction: taking the negations literally rather than as pointing to primordial completion.>
[16378-16392] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PATH AND FRUITION UNITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TELEOLOGICAL CONFUSION]
<Path appearance path fruition's manner path also is, that from open appearance wisdom path manner fruition also is. From Self-Arisen: "Dharmakaya within spontaneous presence's essence kadag that path manner fruition also is." Path three: essence path dharmakaya's manner is, nature path sambhogakaya's manner is, compassion path emanation's manner is. These three one nature's different aspects, dharmakaya spontaneous presence, sambhogakaya light rays appearance, emanation wisdom's compassion's compassion's manifestations three limitless. The unity of path and fruition transcends teleological development. Risk of teleological confusion: treating the path as leading to a future fruition rather than recognizing their non-dual nature.>
[16423-16437] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE KAYAS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ONTOLOGICAL MULTIPLICITY]
<Spontaneous presence from kayas three: sambhogakaya light's aspect appearance, emanation wisdom compassion's manifestation, both dharmakaya's manner is. Thus kayas three appearance-mode only different, essence not different. Essence one nature three bodies is, nature spontaneous presence three bodies is, compassion capacity three bodies is. Spontaneous presence within three bodies abiding, spontaneous presence light five colors light sambhogakaya, spontaneous presence manifestations emanation body, both dharmakaya's essence is. The three kayas are aspects of one spontaneous presence, not ontologically distinct entities. Risk of ontological multiplicity: treating the kayas as separate existences rather than descriptions of one ground.>
[16456-16470] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMPTY APPEARANCE MANIFESTATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]
<Essence empty appearance clear spontaneous presence from, kayas three appearance-mode clear, five lights wisdom's display, dharmakaya non-conceptual clear light, sambhogakaya five lights ornament wheel, emanation spheres light various forms, all self-appearances not other, natural expression clear light essence. Empty and clear inseparable: empty is not void but the capacity for appearance, clear is not substance but unobstructed manifestation. The ground is empty appearance, not empty then appearance. Risk of substantialism: treating appearance as emerging from or grounded in something substantial rather than recognizing empty-clear as inseparable.>
[16491-16504] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL EXPRESSION DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CAUSAL ATTTRIBUTION]
<Thus essence kayas three not established, nature five wisdoms not established, compassion emanations not established. Not established from where arise? From ground's power natural expression. Natural expression not other than ground, ground not other than natural expression. Self-appearances ground's play, play not different from player. The display arises spontaneously without cause, not from something other than itself. Risk of causal attribution: seeking a cause for appearance rather than recognizing spontaneous presence.>
