[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL EMANATION GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: LINEAGE EXCLUSIVISM]
<There frightened blocked emanation body field born. These also Bhagavan Vajradhara's blessings from, nature arranged, therefore natural emanation field called. Fields those continuities: heart like mirror etc., wisdom jewel self-clear self-resonance and, skull house wrathful mandala primordially abiding appearance arose. Retinue appearance and, senses final seeing able cause and, liberation certain cause also that is, should know.

Risk of lineage exclusivism: claiming these teachings belong only to Dzogchen rather than recognizing them as pointing to universal nature.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LIBERATION AS ORIGINAL PURITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]
*Mu-tig-phreng-ba*: "Liberation place itself is primordial!" Primordial primordial purity, awareness self-recognition, now cause not return, confusion-basis exhausted, result called name becomes! Detailed above ground's section explained, particularly stain-free divided, know!
[CONTEXT] FRUITION TERMINOLOGY: The shift from "ground" (*gzhi*) to "result" (*'bras bu*) is nominal, not ontological. Longchenpa establishes that "result" is merely a name for recognition of what was never other than primordially pure. This reflects the *snying thig* view that path and fruition are non-dual.
Second, three: expanse liberation actual; expanse dwelling nature; expanse dharmatā's intent how coiled! First: faculties sharp-dull-medium three liberation time, result difference not, time three Buddhas all intent exhausted Dharmakāya expression-free that itself one, face-equal difference-free nature thigle essence single Buddha! Also this life spontaneously accomplished or bardo self-appearance recognized, or emanation field breath sent, path-appearance's body and wisdom's appearance outer-clear aspects, spontaneous presence dissolution manner stages expanse into dissolve, crystal-light inside gathered like time, appearance emptiness liberates! Wisdom expanse dissolved, form-body Dharmakāya's expanse parinirvāṇa, entity and sign not, space-like dharmatā taste one—space space into dissolve like!
Risk: Temporalization—reading dissolution as chronological process rather than atemporal recognition.

[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]
<That time samsara itself first-last cut called. Thus sky mixed or, outer appearance self-light's rays dharmadhatu dissolved, sun setting rays self gathered; water into water dissolved; butter into butter dissolved likewise. From blazing relic: then essence kadag, from sun rays gather like, self-appearance emanation with, self-essence self-dissolved, difference not division not becomes. As water into water dissolves. The dissolution analogies point to non-dual recognition, not literal merging of substances. Risk of substantialism: treating dissolution as mixing of entities rather than recognition of non-duality.>

[RISK: PERSONIFICATION]
<Experience nirvana exhaustion time feelings' gate also self self-ceased. Heat and signs self-exhausted nirvana time afflictions self-exhausted emptied made. Exhaustion dharma this practice's person develop and self-perfected. Essence this abiding's person fortunate who sees: this Buddhas all's result Samantabhadra's essence self-abides.

First protector stainless purity light's sheath self-arisen dawned, Buddhas all's activity's self also secret supreme great body obtained, from that not-returning yogi intelligence power possessing fortunate. Result all's measure arrived Samantabhadra equal. Samantabhadra represents the ground's nature, not a person. Risk of personification: treating Samantabhadra as an entity rather than the primordial state.>

[RISK: CONCEPTUALIZATION]
<Actual wherever established not, that itself from: nature's appearance, marks holding not at all, color not self-clear, knowing and rigpa's aspects merely, holding's object whatever not, therefore conceptualization's holding aspect not. Light transcended self-resonance, primordially distinction abides. Body transcended self-resonance, pure great mudra abides. The natural appearance transcends all conceptual marks. Risk of conceptualization: attempting to mentally grasp or categorize the transcendent nature.>
