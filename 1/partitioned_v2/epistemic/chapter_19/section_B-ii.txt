[15736-15747] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL APPEARANCE WITHOUT MARKS]
[DECLERATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CONCEPTUALIZATION]
<Actual wherever established not, that itself from: nature's appearance, marks holding not at all, color not self-clear, knowing and rigpa's aspects merely, holding's object whatever not, therefore conceptualization's holding aspect not. Light transcended self-resonance, primordially distinction abides. Body transcended self-resonance, pure great mudra abides. The natural appearance transcends all conceptual marks. Risk of conceptualization: attempting to mentally grasp or categorize the transcendent nature.>
[15774-15785] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ELEMENTS PURIFICATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ALCHEMICAL LITERALISM]
<Impure five elements pure five wisdoms' great elements appearance visible relying, pure result divisions arranged. Also wind vajra cross arrangement good, samaya goddess sky coiling unmoved wind dharmadhatu dissolved. Earth jewel five's stupa even balanced manner abiding, hard not earth dharmadhatu dissolved. Water crystal wheel stacked good, karma and afflictions' part free, moist not water dharmadhatu dissolved. Fire lotus net light blazing, unripened ripened made, hot not fire dharmadhatu dissolved. Space pure dharmata expanse vast, primordially pure impure delusion opening space dharmadhatu dissolved. Outer objects, inner body, aggregates elements and sense-bases etc. dharmas all pure, wisdom jewel's essence empty all-arising mandala expanse. The elemental purification is metaphorical, not alchemical transformation. Risk of alchemical literalism: treating these as literal elemental transmutations rather than recognition of wisdom nature.>
[15806-15817] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AGGREGATES DISSOLUTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ANNIHILATIONISM]
<Earth completely nirvana, feeling aggregate pure. Fire completely nirvana, consciousness aggregate pure. Wind completely nirvana, compositional factors aggregate pure. Second, wisdom dharmadhatu dissolved: five afflictions five wisdoms pure self-resonance five inner dharmadhatu clear light dissolved, deep resonance five color's ground abiding. From Six Expanse: self-resonance moved white part, deep clarity great itself abides. The dissolution of aggregates into dharmadhatu is not annihilation but purification. Risk of annihilationism: mistaking dissolution for destruction rather than recognition of purity.>
[15842-15851] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DEEP CLARITY GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]
<From that itself: "Primordially self-pure great, perfected peak abides, stone-with marks self-pure, deep clarity great ground abides." From Self-Arisen: "Jewel variously arranged net, balanced." Fourth, clear light dharmadhatu coiling four: dissolving not-dull. The deep clarity is the ground's nature, not a substantial entity. Risk of substantialism: treating clarity as a thing rather than the empty luminosity of awareness.>
[15883-15892] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMADHI CONTINUITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: MEDITATIONISM]
<Continuous samadhi gathering-separation not, dharmata inconceivable samadhi change not. Fourth: self-arisen rigpa inner clear spontaneous presence great abiding, jewel sheath change not abides. These also from Self-Arisen: "Jewel vajra seat change not, jewel empty path termination not, intent self-abiding oral instruction shown." The samadhi continuity is natural, not cultivated. Risk of meditationism: treating this as achieved through meditation effort rather than recognition of natural state.>
[15927-15936] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GREAT PERFECTION QUALITIES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ATTRIBUTION ERROR]
<Unchanging completely vast great, subtle holding difficult great, great seeing not great, round shape not great, moving breath not great, clear color black great, not-existing soft great, appearance examining difficult great, empty appearance great. These paradoxical qualities describe what transcends ordinary categories. Risk of attribution error: applying ordinary conceptual attributes to the transcendent ground.>
[15962-15971] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA WISDOM SEED]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SEED POTENTIALITY ERROR]
<Rigpa wisdom's seed increase-decrease not, rigpa empty-clear wisdom not divided, rigpa holding-free wisdom face-taking extreme free, rigpa concept-free wisdom not-ceased completely clear, rigpa all-clear wisdom not-mixed completely perfected, rigpa all-appearance wisdom clear holding not, rigpa all-clear wisdom clear spontaneous thick. From Self-Arisen: "Jewel measureless palace arrangement good, jewel variously spread lady ornament good." The seed metaphor points to what is already complete, not potential to be developed. Risk of seed potentiality error: treating rigpa as a seed to be nurtured rather than recognizing its primordial completion.>
[16001-16010] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-LEARNING PATH]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM]
<Tamed guide compassion path body and, wisdom and activity outer appearance dawned relying, non-learning path explained. Third, body and wisdom's dawning ground certainly two: dawning ground ascertainment, nature extensively explained. First also dawning ground actual and, that wrong view refutation two: first, abandonment-realization final dharmakaya kadag spontaneous presence jewel sheath that body and wisdom's dawning ground is. The non-learning path is not anti-intellectual but recognition beyond acquisition. Risk of anti-intellectualism: rejecting study and reflection rather than recognizing their provisional nature.>
[16045-16054] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BUDDHAHOOD WITHOUT GRASPING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]
<Truly Buddha time's kadag that whatsoever not established, body and wisdom's dharma also not, dawning ground also not. Some say: body and wisdom actually abiding, that not, result's dharmakaya and wisdom not obtained, or obtained then declined. Refutation two: reasoning first, Buddha wisdom not, self-benefit and other benefit not arise, what not sky empty difference not. Second, entity-speak some like, dharmakaya that entity and marks established, coarse like existing. The Buddha's wisdom transcends existence and non-existence. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "not established" as utter non-existence rather than freedom from conceptual extremes.>
[16080-16089] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WISDOM NEGATION AND AFFIRMATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CONTRADICTION]
<That wisdom not, beings' benefit and Buddha's dharma immeasurable certainly not become. From Condensed: "Wisdom not, qualities increase not bodhi and, ocean-like Buddha dharma also not become." These wisdom not said, essence whatsoever not established negation. Wisdom existing said, nature spontaneous presence part described, contradiction not, kadag and spontaneous presence non-dual. Second, nature extensively explained: dharmadhatu kadag's dharmakaya's mode wisdom spontaneous presence subtle nature abiding. The apparent contradiction between wisdom's existence and non-existence is resolved in non-dual understanding. Risk of contradiction: taking the negations and affirmations as logical opposites rather than skillful means.>
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COMPASSION WISDOM GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DUALISTIC FUNCTIONALISM]
<Compassion wisdom two's dawning ground do, object and aspect actual meet not. From Spontaneous Liberation: "That also essence body abiding, dharma and sambhogakaya enjoyment emanation's part, not divided doing not manner, momentum established from, body color etc. mind object not, nature dawning light's manner, white red yellow and green blue, marks appearance not, appearance not knowing's momentum established, compassion dawning various from." Compassion and wisdom are non-dual, not functional complements. Risk of dualistic functionalism: treating compassion and wisdom as separate functions that work together rather than inseparable aspects of the ground.>
