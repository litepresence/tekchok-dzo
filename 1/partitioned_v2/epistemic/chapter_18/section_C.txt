[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
<Masterful analysis:
The assertion that this ground (*sa*) transcends the coarse appearance of body and wisdom (*sku dang ye shes kyi snang ba rags pa las 'das pa*) marks definitive Dzogchen view. The emanation (*sprul pa*) dividing downward to benefit beings—arising from *ka dag* (primordial purity) through *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence) as ground-appearance (*gzi snang*)—describes the non-dual display: benefit is not "done to others" but awareness's self-recognition appearing as "other." The crucial instruction: the dream example (*rmi lam dpe*) clarifies that even when "benefiting beings," no benefit has occurred apart from self-appearance (*rang snang*)—this is not nihilistic denial of compassion but radical pointing to the non-dual nature of apparent "self and other." The Dzogchen integration: emanation (*sprul pa*) is not a buddha-power exercised upon beings but the natural display (*rang bzhin*) of recognition when confusion self-liberates.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]
<Masterful analysis:
The three moments (*skad cig gsum*) structure describes recognition phases: first, aggregate appearances cease (*'gags*) along with four wisdom preparations (*ye shes bzhi sbyor*); second, spontaneous presence door (*lhun grub kyi sgo*) is seen; third, that also ceases, and primordial purity appearance (*ka dag gi snang ba*) is seen through self-face recognition. This is not temporal sequence but simultaneous aspects of single recognition: what appears as "three moments" is the pedagogical description of what occurs in one instant of *rig pa*. Risk of temporalization: reading this as "first this, then that, finally enlightenment" rather than recognizing all three as modalities of ever-present ground. The analogy to swift, slow, and very slow arrows (*mda' shugs*) indicates capacity differences (*dbang po rab 'bring tha ma*) in recognition-speed, not hierarchical stages to traverse—supreme faculties recognize instantly what takes others longer to stabilize, but the "recognition" itself is identical.>
[14649-14664] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
<Masterful analysis:
The *Rang Shar* citation enumerates liberation modes (*grol lugs*) for those of supreme faculties (*dbang po rab*) at the moment of completion: some liberate through three moments, some through mirror-like aggregate, some through mother-father union, some through flickering (*mer mer shig shig*) giving rise to self-arisen bliss, some through compassion-rays, some through two aggregates, some through whatever-appearance-as-body. The phrase *de ni rab kyi grol lugs so*—"this is the supreme liberation mode"—indicates these are not different attainments but recognition-marks of the same *rig pa*. The ultimate point: in one moment (*skad cig gcig*), one buddhas and emanation arises naturally (*rang bzhin du 'byung*). This is Dzogchen's radical immediacy: the "path" is not sequential cultivation but recognition that fruition has never been absent. The "six other grounds" (*gzhan drug gi sar*) contrasted with the final moment indicate that even meditative days (*bsam gtan gyi zhag*) of other vehicles are surpassed instantly when recognition occurs.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO RECOGNITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]
Heap-appearance ceases; momentary spontaneous presence appearance ceases; momentary primordial purity truth seen! Emanation from primordial purity ground not separate—path all empowerments' suchness obtained; like shooting star sky-running mode, shooting star that light-radiates similar, emanation emanated beings' benefit done. Benefit done in three days possible.
[CONTEXT] BARDO DOCTRINE: The reference to "three days" (*zhag gsum*) indicates the *snying thig* teaching on the duration of the bardo state. Unlike common Buddhist views of 49 days, Dzogchen asserts recognition can occur instantaneously or within three days for those with supreme faculties. The "shooting star" (*skar mda'*) simile appears in *Sgra thal 'gyur* as the sudden flash of recognition amidst darkness.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FACULTY-PERFECTION PATH]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: FACULTY ELITISM]
Supreme faculties' tip: one day bardo dwells! Also four wisdom conjunctions' appearance self-appearance seen—also from own eye wisdom fire two arisen, weapons fall from mouth, appearance ceaseless dawns, there self-awareness awakened, own sphere seen, spontaneous presence ground certainty obtained; again shooting star-like should be known! Supreme faculties' best: two days become Buddha! Also heap-appearance one day dwells—also from own heart wisdom sun one dawns, from that light-rays directions radiate! From that light-ray tips each one thus-come body dawns! That appearance's entire sphere body's nature seen!
Epistemic precision: The "four wisdom conjunctions" (*ye shes bzhi sbyor*) refer to the progressive visions (*snang ba bzhi*) of thod rgal practice. The path described is "instantaneous" (*cig car*) for supreme faculties, recognizing self-appearance as wisdom-display. Risk: Faculty elitism—interpreting "supreme faculties" as ontological hierarchy rather than recognition-readiness.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO STAGES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]
<Four days bardo abides. Self-front five clusters clearly dwell seen, self-latency awakened to that, eastern cluster one day abides. Likewise four directions' clusters day each abide. Then spontaneous presence certainty obtained, Buddha. Emanation fourteen days benefit can do. Senses supreme medium: day rising sees, five days sees. Also thus: four days cluster abides, one day wisdom's appearance abides. That self-heart light rays horse-ear like arise, sky's space standing pillar comes. That self-eye not wandering held, looked. The temporal markers (days, stages) are instructional provisionality, not ontological description. Risk: literalizing the temporal sequence as metaphysical reality rather than pedagogical scaffolding.>
