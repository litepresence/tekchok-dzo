[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]
<Masterful analysis:
The description of forceful elemental compression (*drag tu khams kyis thub thang du sgril zhing sgul bskyod byas pas*) producing visions of red blood-turbidity, yellow flickering, green wavering, dissolving, and blue-clear appearance operates within *tantric transformative view*. These are preparatory signs (*rtags*) on the path, not the final Dzogchen recognition. The sequence—from distorted elemental appearances (*dmar khrag khru dang ser lhang lheng*) through dissolution (*thim thim*) to clear blue (*sngon sang seng*)—maps the progressive purification of confused perception into luminosity. Risk of reification: practitioners may fixate on these visionary experiences as attainments rather than transitional phenomena. The definitive Dzogchen view recognizes these "stages" as already complete in the ground, not sequential achievements.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] → [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: MEDITATION AS DOING]
<Masterful analysis:
The practical instructions—relying on wind-suitable food (*rlung la shis pa'i kha zas*), placing mind on the letter RAM at the navel (*lte bar yi ge ram la sems gtad*), mixing HUM with wind and mind—are *upāya* from tantric subtle body yoga (*rtsa rlung thig le*). The visualization of deity body (*lha'i skur sgoms*) and subtle body emanation (*sku phra mo 'du byed*) through nose-tip and pores operates as pedagogical bridge. Risk: "meditation as doing"—practitioners may approach these as productive techniques generating realization rather than recognition of pre-existing nature. The transition to Dzogchen occurs when these practices reveal that "clarity-purity experience" (*shes pa gsal dag chen po'i nyams*) is not produced but recognized as awareness's own display.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]
<Masterful analysis:
The seven pith instructions (*gnad bdun*) for body-mind grasping at the forehead involve sophisticated subtle body mechanics: mixing white-red bindus (*thig le dkar dmar*) at the eyebrow-center like a pea in a locket, holding wind through the two nostrils of the "hanging corpse" skeleton, shooting wind like an arrow to purify demons and obscurations, drawing it back like a hook into the central channel (*dbu ma'i ma snas*), and filling the four wheels (*'khor lo bzhi*) with wisdom wind. These are technical practices from *anuyoga* completion stage. Risk: reifying channels (*rtsa*), winds (*rlung*), and wheels (*'khor lo*) as anatomical realities rather than symbolic coordinates for awareness-recognition. The Dzogchen integration recognizes these "structures" as designations for dimensions of single awareness, not subtle physiology requiring manipulation.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] → [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY] → [DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
<Masterful analysis:
The advanced practices—drawing white wind like an arrow from miles away, holding awareness on the body's five-colored light-fence like a rainbow without blur or scatter, and shooting wind-mind into sky-space—transition from tantric technique to Dzogchen recognition. The "thought-free clarity experience" (*rtog med gsal ba'i nyams*) and "light-clear purity" (*'od gsal dag pa*) indicate approaching definitive view. The final instruction of shooting wind-mind into sky-space (*rlung sems nam mkha'i mthongs su 'phangs*) metaphorically dissolves the practitioner/environment boundary. This is not spatial projection but recognition that awareness has no center or periphery—the "sky" is none other than awareness's own spacious nature (*nam mkha'i rang bzhin*).>
