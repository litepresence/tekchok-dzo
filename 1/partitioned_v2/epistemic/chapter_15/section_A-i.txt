The three-kaya posture practice (*sku gsum gyi bzhugs stangs*) marks transition from *sems*-side methodology to definitive recognition. The three postures—sprul sku frog-posture (*tsog pu*) for future austerity-based liberation, longs sku elephant-posture (*glang po*) for future effortless natural liberation, chos sku lion-posture (*seng ge*) for future authentic fearless liberation—operate initially as *instructional provisionality*. The question arises: how does elemental body's posture become three-kaya posture? The answer reveals Dzogchen integration: three kayas abide in heart (*snying la gnas*) as self-existing clear light (*sku gsum 'od gsal rang la yod pa*)—posture practice makes manifest (*mngon du byed*) the three intentions already present. The three kayas are self-nature (*rang chas su yod pas*), so one's own posture becomes three-kaya posture. The correlations—cold elements with sprul sku requiring temperature balance, hot elements with chos sku, balanced with longs sku—are provisional correlations for practitioners whose recognition operates through elemental harmony. The crucial point: without posture control, wisdom's self-radiance in channels is not evoked; without evocation, wisdom-appearance does not dawn in external space. Posture is essential (*gces so*), not as cause but as recognition-condition.>

<The threefold classification of beings according to affliction ripening operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The opening statement establishes the karmic structure: sentient beings (*'gro ba*) are led into three realms (*khams gsum*) by three afflictions (*nyon mongs pa gsum*), and liberation occurs through the same three doorways—body, speech, and mind (*lus ngag yid gsum*). This presents a precise karmic taxonomy: the three poisons (desire, confusion, anger) ripen as three forms (bird, pig, snake), each emphasizing one of the three doors (speech, mind, body) as predominant. The first elaboration—desire-unpurified (*'dod chags ma dag pa*) ripening into bird-form (*bya'i gzugs su byung ba*) with action and speech predominant (*bya ba dang byed pa ngag gtso che ba*), love of speaking (*smra ba la dga' ba*), focus on speech objects (*brjod bya la gtsor byed*), great desire (*'dod pa che*), and desire-joy (*'dod chags la dga' ba*)—serves diagnostic function. The Sambhogakaya posture (*longs sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for desire-types: when one always maintains this posture, one becomes skilled in dharmata meaning (*chos nyid kyi don la mchog tu mkhas pa*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*), meeting practitioners through their predominant karmic pattern. Risk of determinism: interpreting these correlations as fixed destinies rather than recognition-entry points. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "desire," "confusion," and "anger" are modalities of single awareness; the "postures" are not corrective therapies but pointing-devices revealing that all three poisons are wisdom-display when recognized. The phrase "certainly become buddha" (*sangs rgya bar nges*) refers to recognition, not temporal attainment.>

The phrase "waking the sleeper" (*bag la nyal slong bar byed pa*) is significant: this affliction-type is characterized by dormant tendency (*bag la nyal*) that requires awakening. The Dharmakaya posture (*chos sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for confusion-types: when one always abides in this posture, one definitely abides in dharmata throughout three times (*chos nyid la dus gsum du gnas par nges so*). The phrase "three times" (*dus gsum*)—past, present, future—indicates that recognition transcends temporal becoming: it is not that one will attain something in future, but that one recognizes what has always been abiding. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners whose confusion manifests as mental dullness and conceptual proliferation. Risk of path-essence confusion: treating "abiding in dharmata" as progressive attainment rather than recognition of primordial abiding.

The snake-form is characterized by movement and physicality: the being loves to move, has great bodily power, and loves physical adornment (*byi dor*—refining/adorning the body). The Nirmanakaya posture (*sprul pa sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for anger-types: when one always abides in this posture, one certainly awakens (*sangs rgya bar nges so*). The phrase "certainly awakens" (*sangs rgya bar nges*) appears here without the qualification "skilled in dharmata meaning" that appeared for the desire-type. This is significant: for the anger-type, the connection to nirmanakaya (manifestation body) points directly to awakening as activity-display. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners whose anger manifests as physical restlessness and aggression. Risk of essentialism: treating "anger-types" as ontologically separate category rather than recognition-pattern description. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "anger" is a manifestation of awareness's energy (*lung*); the Nirmanakaya posture is not anger-management therapy but revelation that anger-energy is itself the display of wisdom when recognized.>

The declaration—"three postures are certain" (*bzhugs stangs gsum du nges so*)—establishes pedagogical completeness: there are exactly three postures, not more (superfluous) nor fewer (incomplete). The rationale—sentient beings' aspirations (*'gro ba'i smon so*) appearing in body, speech, and mind, and liberation occurring through the bondage of those same three—indicates that the three postures precisely correspond to the three bondage-structures. The phrase "not more" (*de las mang na mi dgos*) addresses the danger of proliferation: adding more postures would miss the precise recognition-coordinate. The phrase "not fewer" (*nyung na ma tshang bas*) addresses the danger of incompleteness: fewer postures would miss some practitioners' predominant patterns. The final line—"at this time, cutting off speech about the speech-point" (*'di'i dus ngag gi gnad smra ba bcad pa ste*)—marks the transition from karmic-structural teaching to direct introduction. The "speech-point" (*ngag gi gnad*) refers to the esoteric transmission that cannot be expressed in words; "cutting off" (*bcad pa*) indicates that the definitive teaching now goes beyond conceptual elaboration. Risk of categorization: treating the three postures as rigid categories rather than skillful-means (*upāya*) that point beyond all categories. The Dzogchen view recognizes that body, speech, and mind are never truly separate; the three postures are recognition-facilitating devices, not ontological divisions.

The four phases constitute a precise pedagogical progression: (1) Training (*bslab pa*): first reduce speaking, cutting ordinary conversation (*tha mal gyi gtam smra ba bcad pa*), beginning with short sessions (*thun chung ngu*) then extending to longer periods (*de nas ring du bslab*); even when no occasion for speaking, speak only one word (*skabs su smra rgyu med kyang gcig pu smra'o*).

(3) Recitation (*la bzla*): all mantra-recitation and expressions cease (*sngags la sogs pa brjod pa thams cad mi bya*).

This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for gradual path practitioners. Risk of asceticism: interpreting this as value of silence itself rather than recognition-support.

The phrase "scattering and gathering" (*'phro 'du*) refers to mind's ordinary movement of thought: scattering outward (*'phro*) toward objects and gathering inward (*'du*) as mental engagement. The phrase "self-decides" (*rang chod do*) means that this movement naturally self-resolves, not through suppression but through recognition that movement and stillness are not truly separate. The reference to "however blocked" (*ji ltar lkug pa*) indicates that the method of blocking speech is provisional; the definitive point is that speech's nature has never needed blocking. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*): the recognition that speech, thought, and awareness are one nature (*ngo bo gcig*). Risk of essentializing non-speech: treating "silence" as ultimate state rather than recognizing that speech itself is awareness-display.

The first effect—through cutting speech (*ngag gi smra ba bcad pa*), the unspeakable meaning (*brjod du med pa'i don*) arises in the continuum (*rgyud la skye ste*)—indicates that meaning transcends expression not because speech stops but because recognition realizes the unspeakable nature of all expression. The second effect—through not mixing speech with others (*'gro ba gzhan dang ngag ma 'dres pa*), body is trained (*lus 'byongs pa'i dgos pa yod*)—establishes the necessity of body training: without body-training, buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot bless (*sangs rgyas dang byang chub sems dpa' ... byin gyis brlabs nas*).

This is not spatial gazing but recognition of awareness's own expanse (*dbyings*). The *Thal 'Gyur* citation—"Mind (*sems*) is accomplished (*'grub*) through placing (*gtad pa*) in expanse (*dbyings la*)"—provides definitive pointing: mind's accomplishment is not attainment of new state but recognition of its nature as expanse. The phrase "placing" (*gtad pa*) does not mean fixing or forcing but allowing recognition to settle naturally. The definitive integration: when body and speech are controlled (*gtso bo lus ngag gnyis gcun pas*), mind naturally follows (*sems zhor la 'chun nas*), space-rigpa dawns (*dbyings rig 'char zhing*), and element-bonds sever (*khams su gyi 'ching ba gcod de*). This establishes that all training (body, speech, mind) is ultimately preparation for recognition: when gross activity (body) and verbal activity (speech) settle, mind naturally reveals itself as space-rigpa awareness (*dbyings rig*). The phrase "space-rigpa" (*dbyings rig*) is crucial: it indicates that awareness (*rig pa*) and its display as expanse (*dbyings*) are inseparable. Risk of meditative-absorption misunderstanding: treating "placing mind in expanse" as meditative absorption state rather than direct recognition of awareness's nature. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "element-bonds severing" (*khams su gyi 'ching ba gcod*) refers to recognizing that elements were never truly binding; the severing is recognition of self-liberation, not elimination of something real.

<The detailed explanation of the three gnads—door (*sgo*), object (*yul*), and wind-rig (*rlung rig*)—operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation establishes: "The three gnads should not be separated from secret instruction" (*gnad gsum man ngag 'bral mi bya*)—they are door, object, and wind-rig gnads. The metaphorical elaboration: door-gnad is like a guard (*so pa*), object-gnad is like a guest (*'gron po*), wind-rig gnad is like a butcher (*jag pa*). The functional description: door-gnad makes seeing happen (*sgo'i gnad kyis mthong bar byed*), object-gnad makes unchanging (*yul gyi gnad kyis mi 'gyur bar byed*), wind-rig gnad places signs onto measure (*rlung rig gi gnad kyis rtags tshad la 'bebs pa*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). The analogy with lethal points (*dper na gnad la zin pa'i mtshon dang 'dra ste*): just as striking a vital point (*lus kyi rtsa rgyus sam don snying la sogs pa'i gnad la phog na*) makes one feel nothing regardless of activity (*ci byas kyang mi 'tshor bar 'chi ba dang 'dra bar*), so the three gnads transform one into dharmata—not gradually but instantly (*chos nyid la 'gyur ba'i sa med*). The necessity of all three: without object-gnad, no basis for support (*yul med na rten sa'i gzhi med*); without door-gnad, losing path of going (*sgo med na 'gro ba'i lam stor*); without wind-rig gnad, awareness does not resolve inward (*rlung rig gi gnad med na shes rig nang du mi chod pa*). Therefore these three are definite (*gnad gsum du nges la*): not more (*de las mang na*)—infinite would lose the gnad (*mtha' yas pas gnad stor la*); not fewer (*nyung na*)—purpose would not be accomplished (*don mi 'grub pa*). Risk of anatomical literalism: treating "door," "object," and "wind-rig" as anatomical structures rather than recognition-coordinates. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these three gnads are not entities but modes of recognition: door refers to how awareness perceives, object refers to what awareness perceives, wind-rig refers to the energetic dimension of awareness.>

[RISK: SEQUENTIALIZATION]
<The second subdivision—placing on one's own individual gnad (*bye brag rang gi gnad thog tu dbab pa*)—operates from definitive *rigpa-side* as direct introduction. This subdivision contains two aspects: determining the general order of the three gnads (*gnad gsum spyi'i rim pa nges pa*) and placing on each individual gnad (*so so'i gnad la thog tu dbab pa*). The phrase "general order" (*spyi'i rim pa*) indicates the sequential recognition process, but the Dzogchen view recognizes that in actual recognition, all three gnads operate simultaneously, not sequentially. The phrase "determining" (*nges pa*) means recognizing definitively that these three are necessary and sufficient, not tentatively considering them. The phrase "placing on each individual gnad" (*so so'i gnad la thog tu dbab pa*) refers to direct application of each gnad in one's own experience: not theoretical understanding but experiential recognition. The opening of this section—"body, speech, and mind unmoving (*lus ngag sems gsum mi 'gul zhing*) and controlling door, object, and wind-rig (*sgo dang yul dang rlung rig gcun pa*)"—establishes the state for applying the gnads: when gross activity of body, speech, and mind settles, the subtle gnads become accessible. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*): the recognition that awareness is not achieved through controlling the gnads but through recognizing that the gnads are awareness's own display. Risk of sequentialization: treating the "general order" as temporal sequence rather than pedagogical presentation. The Dzogchen view recognizes that body, speech, and mind "unmoving" (*mi 'gul*) does not mean physical immobilization but resting in awareness without grasping at activity.>

<The citations establishing the necessity of oral transmission and subtle body practice operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The *Rang byung rig pa'i tantra* (Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra) citation—"Thus, by thoroughly pressing all body-points etc. (*de ltar lus la sogs pa yi gnad kun rab tu gzir ba yis*), rigpa itself directly (*rig pa nyid dang mngon sum du*)—known from guru's oral transmission (*bla ma'i lung las shes pa yin*)"—establishes that gnad-pressing (*gnad gzir*) is not mere technique but preparation for direct recognition through authentic lineage. The *Thal 'Gyur* elaboration—"Actual basis relied upon in one's continuum (*dngos gzhi rang gi rgyud bsten na*), body-point and speech and mind-point relied upon (*lus kyi gnad dang ngag dang yang sems kyi gnad la brten pa yis*), wind somehow made slow (*rlung ni ci nas dal byas te*), excellently projected (*rab tu 'phang pa*), from this body and mind's connection severed (*lus dang sems kyi 'brel chad de*), not reversing even in three realms (*khams gsum du yang zlog pa min*)"—describes the mechanics of subtle body practice (*rtsa rlung thig le*) within Dzogchen context. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from physical-energetic preparation. Risk of subtle body reification: treating "pressing gnads" and "making wind slow" as manipulations rather than recognition-facilitating conditions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "body-mind connection severed" does not mean eliminating connection but recognizing that they were never truly separate; "not reversing in three realms" indicates that recognition transcends samsara/nirvana duality.>

[RISK: THREEFOLD ESSENTIALIZING]
<The concise definition of the three gnads operates from definitive *rigpa-side* pointing to recognition. The statement—"Door is three-kaya eyes seeing (*sgo ni sku gsum mig gis blta*), object is free from obscurations (*yul ni sgrib byed bral ba'o*), slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom (*rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub*)"—provides definitive recognition-coordinates: (1) Door (*sgo*) refers to the three kayas as the three ways awareness sees itself—not external forms to visualize but awareness's own display as trikaya; (2) Object (*yul*) refers to whatever is perceived being free from obscurations (*sgrib byed bral ba*)—not that objects lack veils but that recognition sees all appearances as already free; (3) Slow wind-rigpa (*rlung rig dal ba*) refers to the natural settled state of subtle energy (*rlung*) and awareness (*rig pa*) when not agitated by dualistic grasping, which naturally accomplishes wisdom (*ye shes 'grub*). The phrase "slow" (*dal ba*) indicates natural settling, not forced suppression. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of threefold essentializing: treating "door," "object," and "wind-rig" as separate entities to master rather than recognition-aspects of single awareness. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these three are not sequential: the "door" is awareness seeing, the "object" is what awareness sees (which is itself), and "slow wind" is the natural state of awareness's energy. All three point to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated.>

[RISK: VISUALIZATION MISUNDERSTANDING]
<The detailed instruction on door-gnad—the first of the three gnads—operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The opening statement: ordinary seeing-mode (*tha mal pa'i lta lugs*) does not dawn wisdom (*ye shes mi 'char bas*), therefore train in three-kaya seeing-modes (*sku gsum gyi gzigs stang gsum la bslab*). This establishes that ordinary perception is not wrong but incomplete for recognition; the three-kaya seeing-modes are not new ways to see but recognition of how awareness has always seen. The *Dpal nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud* (Glorious Space-Equal Tantra) citation describes three kayas' functions: (1) Dharmakaya seeing-mode (*chos kyi sku yi gzigs stangs*)—pressing the three realms' samsara (*khams gsum 'khor ba spyibs na 'don*), meaning seeing all samsara as already pressed into dharmata; (2) Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*)—samsara's basis not destroyed (*srid pa'i gzhi ma 'jig*), indicating that recognition sees without destroying appearances; (3) Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*)—liberating into buddha-fields (*sangs rgyas zhing du sgrol*), indicating manifestation-liberation. Additional citations: *Yi ge med pa* (Scripture Without Letters): "Eye is examined in space-element" (*mig ni nam mkha'i khams su brtag*), indicating that the eye itself is examined as space-expanse; *Gsang ba sgra rgyud* (Secret Sound Tantra): three seeing-modes—casting down, turning back, and glancing (*phab dang zlog dang zur gyis ni gzigs stangs rnam pa gsum du grags*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of visualization misunderstanding: treating "three-kaya seeing" as visualizations of forms to see rather than recognition of awareness's own seeing. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these "modes" are not sequential practices but descriptions of how recognition sees: all three kayas are simultaneously present in recognition.>

[RISK: ABILITY-TYPE DETERMINISM]
<The detailed application of three-kaya seeing based on practitioner's eye-quality operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The clarification—casting down Nirmanakaya awakening (*sprul sku phab nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at trainees (*gdul bya la gzigs la*); glancing at Sambhogakaya awakening (*longs sku la zur gzigs nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at realms (*zhing khams la gzigs pa*); turning back Dharmakaya awakening (*chos sku bzlog nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at basis (*gzhi la gzigs pa'o*)—indicates that each kaya-emphasis serves different pedagogical purpose: (1) Nirmanakaya casting-down (*phab*) directs gaze downward toward beings needing guidance; (2) Sambhogakaya glancing (*zur*) directs gaze sideways toward pure realms; (3) Dharmakaya turning-back (*bzlog*) directs gaze inward toward the basis. The instruction for different eye-qualities: (1) For those with poor eye-sight (*mig shas ngan pa*), following Nirmanakaya seeing-mode prevents eye-obscuration (*mig mi 'grib pa'i dgos pa yod*); (2) For those with eye-fault (*mig la skyon chags*), following Sambhogakaya mode makes eye clear (*mig gsal ba'i dgos pa yod*); (3) For those with good eye-sight (*mig shas bzang*), following Dharmakaya mode quickly places appearance onto measure (*myur du snang ba tshad la phebs pa'i dgos pa yod*). The definitive statement: "If not moving from those, three eyes certainly enter into interior (*de dag las ma g.yos na spyan gsum khong du chud par nges te*)"—establishes that without wavering from these modes, recognition occurs. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of ability-type determinism: treating eye-quality as fixed category rather than recognition-condition. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "three eyes entering interior" refers to recognition's self-introduction, not physical eye-training. The phrase "Dharmakaya has dharmata-eye" (*chos sku la chos nyid kyi spyan yod pas*) indicates that Dharmakaya seeing is recognizing dharmata, not looking at something called dharmata.>

[RISK: BLESSING REIFICATION]
<The threefold blessing-bestowal (*byin rlabs*) structure marks definitive Dzogchen transmission. The statement: through Dharmakaya's blessing (*de'i byin rlabs kyis*), wisdom is directly seen (*ye shes dngos su mthong bas*)—definite in this (*'di nyid la thag chod*); through Sambhogakaya's blessing, self-clarity is seen (*de'i byin rlabs kyis rang gsal du mthong bas*)—knowledge expands (*mkhyen pa rgyas*); through Nirmanakaya's blessing, seeing without sound-words (*de'i byin rlabs kyis sgra tshig dang bral bar mthong bas*)—all hearing-contemplating-mediating, dharmata's meaning dawns from within (*thos bsam sgom pa la rag ma lus par chos nyid kyi don khong nas 'char ro*). This is not sequential reception but simultaneous dimensions of single recognition. The "blessing" (*byin rlabs*) is not external infusion but the collapse of apparent separation between recognizer and recognized: when recognition occurs, it is not that something new appears but that what has always been present is recognized. The three eyes (*spyan gsum*) viewing: (1) Dharmata's eye turning upward (*chos nyid kyi spyan gyen la bzlog pas*) clears latencies downward (*bag chags thur la sel ba'i gnad*), indicating that transcending dualistic gaze naturally clears habitual patterns; (2) Wisdom's corner looking evenly (*ye shes kyi zur la mnyam por bltas pas*) balances saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as same taste (*'khor 'das ro mnyam du bsre ba'i gnad*), indicating that recognition sees samsara and nirvana as not two; (3) Prajñā's looking downward (*shes rab kyis phab nas bltas pas*) actually settles wisdom-appearance (*ye shes kyi snang ba dngos su 'bebs pa'i gnad*), indicating that wisdom-display naturally manifests without effort. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of blessing reification: treating "blessing" as external power transmission rather than recognition of what has always been present.>

[RISK: CAPACITY DETERMINISM]
<The determination of three seeing-modes (*gzigs stangs gsum*) operates from *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for different practitioner capacities. The question: "What makes three definite?" (*gzigs stangs gsum du nges pa ci yin zhe na*). The answer: lazy ones need Sambhogakaya (*le lo can la longs sku*), diligent ones Nirmanakaya (*brtson 'grus can la sprul sku*), equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture (*btang snyoms can la chos sku'i gzigs stangs*), therefore three are definite (*shis pas na gsum du nges so*). This establishes that the three seeing-modes are not sequential stages but skillful-means matching practitioner's predominant capacity (*dbang po*). The definition (*nges tshig*): by seeing, looking at dharmata (*gzigs pas chos nyid la gzigs pas*), obscurations are exhausted (*rnam dag sgrib pa zad pa'o*); by posture (*stangs kyis*), one liberates from samsara (*'khor ba las grol bar byed pa'o*). The phrase "obscurations exhausted" (*sgrib pa zad pa*) refers to recognition-elimination: when recognition sees dharmata, obscurations are not removed but recognized as never having existed. The phrase "liberates from samsara" (*'khor ba las grol*) refers to recognition-liberation: samsara is not exited but recognized as self-liberated display (*rang grol). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of capacity determinism: treating "lazy," "diligent," and "equanimous" as fixed categories rather than recognition-condition descriptions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all three seeing-modes are ultimately pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The three modes are different pedagogical approaches for different habitual patterns, not hierarchical stages of attainment.>

<The detailed explanation of object-gnad (*yul gyi gnad*) operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The opening statement: object-gnad is (1) outer expanse's object (*phyi'i dbyings kyi yul*)—empty space free from clouds (*nam mkha' stong pa sprin dang bral ba*); (2) inner expanse's object (*nang gi dbyings kyi yul*)—the treasury between eyebrows (*smin mtshams kyi mdzod spu*)—expanse-appearance blue and the five radiating from it (*dbyings snang mthing ga dang de las mched pa rnam lnga'i rang gdangs*). The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Expanse is outer and inner—outer holds cloud-free sky (*phyi ni sprin bral mkha' la 'dzin*); when dust-rain clears, wise ones press the gnad (*bag rdul char gyis dengs dus su mkhas pa mngon gsum gnad gzir dang*); inner lamp makes path (*nang gi sgron ma lam du bya'o*)." This establishes the structure: (1) Outer object: sky without clouds—pure awareness-expanse; (2) Inner object: lamp between eyebrows—subtle energy focus; (3) The "pressing gnad" (*gnad gzir*) occurs when coarse defilements clear, not through effort. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of anatomical literalism: treating "treasury between eyebrows" as literal anatomical location rather than recognition-coordinate. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" (*phyi*) and "inner" (*nang*) are conventional designations, not actual separate spaces: both refer to dimensions of single awareness. The phrase "expanse-appearance blue and five radiating" (*dbyings snang mthing ga dang de las mched pa rnam lnga'i rang gdangs*) indicates the natural display of awareness as five colors, not visualizations to create.>

[RISK: OBJECT-GNAD DUALISM]
<The definitive clarification of outer and inner objects operates from *rigpa-side* pointing to recognition's non-duality. The explanation: outer is the object where rigpa dawns (*phyi rig pa 'char ba'i yul yin la*), inner is the object where experience increases (*nang nyams 'phel ba'i yul te*); because rigpa and experience are non-dual (*rig pa dang nyams gnyis su med pa las*), it is called "saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixed" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa zhes bya'o*). This establishes that outer and inner are not separate: the object of recognition (*yul*) is not something other than recognition (*rig pa*) and experience (*nyams*). The warning: placing object on coarse earth-water-fire--air objects (*sa chu me rlung gi dngos po rags pa la yul du gtad pas*) will not liberate (*mi grol te*)—first, appearance does not want to dawn (*dang po snang ba 'char du mi 'dod*); later, when dawning, even knowing as coarse objects (*phyis shar dus gtan kyang dngos po rags pa ltar shes pa*), produces agreement with that (*de dang mthun pa skye bas*), so emptiness-unthinkable experience does not dawn from within (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams nang nas mi 'char la*). This is crucial: if one grasps at coarse physical objects as the object of gnad, recognition cannot occur because coarse objects are already solidified by dualistic perception. The phrase "emptiness-unthinkable experience" (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams*) refers to the direct recognition beyond concept (*rtog pa*) of emptiness (*stong nyid*). Risk of object-gnad dualism: treating "object" (*yul*) as something external to recognize rather than awareness's own display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" and "inner" are pedagogical designations pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The "mixing" of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*) is not a mixing of two separate things but the recognition that they were never truly separate.>
