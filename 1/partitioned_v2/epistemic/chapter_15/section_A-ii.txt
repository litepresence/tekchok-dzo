<The threefold blessing-bestowal (*byin rlabs*) structure marks definitive Dzogchen transmission. The statement: through Dharmakaya's blessing (*de'i byin rlabs kyis*), wisdom is directly seen (*ye shes dngos su mthong bas*)—definite in this (*'di nyid la thag chod*); through Sambhogakaya's blessing, self-clarity is seen (*de'i byin rlabs kyis rang gsal du mthong bas*)—knowledge expands (*mkhyen pa rgyas*); through Nirmanakaya's blessing, seeing without sound-words (*de'i byin rlabs kyis sgra tshig dang bral bar mthong bas*)—all hearing-contemplating-mediating, dharmata's meaning dawns from within (*thos bsam sgom pa la rag ma lus par chos nyid kyi don khong nas 'char ro*). This is not sequential reception but simultaneous dimensions of single recognition. The "blessing" (*byin rlabs*) is not external infusion but the collapse of apparent separation between recognizer and recognized: when recognition occurs, it is not that something new appears but that what has always been present is recognized. The three eyes (*spyan gsum*) viewing: (1) Dharmata's eye turning upward (*chos nyid kyi spyan gyen la bzlog pas*) clears latencies downward (*bag chags thur la sel ba'i gnad*), indicating that transcending dualistic gaze naturally clears habitual patterns; (2) Wisdom's corner looking evenly (*ye shes kyi zur la mnyam por bltas pas*) balances saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as same taste (*'khor 'das ro mnyam du bsre ba'i gnad*), indicating that recognition sees samsara and nirvana as not two; (3) Prajñā's looking downward (*shes rab kyis phab nas bltas pas*) actually settles wisdom-appearance (*ye shes kyi snang ba dngos su 'bebs pa'i gnad*), indicating that wisdom-display naturally manifests without effort. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of blessing reification: treating "blessing" as external power transmission rather than recognition of what has always been present.>

[RISK: CAPACITY DETERMINISM]
<The determination of three seeing-modes (*gzigs stangs gsum*) operates from *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for different practitioner capacities. The question: "What makes three definite?" (*gzigs stangs gsum du nges pa ci yin zhe na*). The answer: lazy ones need Sambhogakaya (*le lo can la longs sku*), diligent ones Nirmanakaya (*brtson 'grus can la sprul sku*), equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture (*btang snyoms can la chos sku'i gzigs stangs*), therefore three are definite (*shis pas na gsum du nges so*). This establishes that the three seeing-modes are not sequential stages but skillful-means matching practitioner's predominant capacity (*dbang po*). The definition (*nges tshig*): by seeing, looking at dharmata (*gzigs pas chos nyid la gzigs pas*), obscurations are exhausted (*rnam dag sgrib pa zad pa'o*); by posture (*stangs kyis*), one liberates from samsara (*'khor ba las grol bar byed pa'o*). The phrase "obscurations exhausted" (*sgrib pa zad pa*) refers to recognition-elimination: when recognition sees dharmata, obscurations are not removed but recognized as never having existed. The phrase "liberates from samsara" (*'khor ba las grol*) refers to recognition-liberation: samsara is not exited but recognized as self-liberated display (*rang grol). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of capacity determinism: treating "lazy," "diligent," and "equanimous" as fixed categories rather than recognition-condition descriptions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all three seeing-modes are ultimately pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The three modes are different pedagogical approaches for different habitual patterns, not hierarchical stages of attainment.>

The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Expanse is outer and inner—outer holds cloud-free sky (*phyi ni sprin bral mkha' la 'dzin*); when dust-rain clears, wise ones press the gnad (*bag rdul char gyis dengs dus su mkhas pa mngon gsum gnad gzir dang*); inner lamp makes path (*nang gi sgron ma lam du bya'o*)." This establishes the structure: (1) Outer object: sky without clouds—pure awareness-expanse; (2) Inner object: lamp between eyebrows—subtle energy focus; (3) The "pressing gnad" (*gnad gzir*) occurs when coarse defilements clear, not through effort. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of anatomical literalism: treating "treasury between eyebrows" as literal anatomical location rather than recognition-coordinate. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" (*phyi*) and "inner" (*nang*) are conventional designations, not actual separate spaces: both refer to dimensions of single awareness. The phrase "expanse-appearance blue and five radiating" (*dbyings snang mthing ga dang de las mched pa rnam lnga'i rang gdangs*) indicates the natural display of awareness as five colors, not visualizations to create.>

[RISK: OBJECT-GNAD DUALISM]
<The definitive clarification of outer and inner objects operates from *rigpa-side* pointing to recognition's non-duality. The explanation: outer is the object where rigpa dawns (*phyi rig pa 'char ba'i yul yin la*), inner is the object where experience increases (*nang nyams 'phel ba'i yul te*); because rigpa and experience are non-dual (*rig pa dang nyams gnyis su med pa las*), it is called "saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixed" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa zhes bya'o*). This establishes that outer and inner are not separate: the object of recognition (*yul*) is not something other than recognition (*rig pa*) and experience (*nyams*). The warning: placing object on coarse earth-water-fire--air objects (*sa chu me rlung gi dngos po rags pa la yul du gtad pas*) will not liberate (*mi grol te*)—first, appearance does not want to dawn (*dang po snang ba 'char du mi 'dod*); later, when dawning, even knowing as coarse objects (*phyis shar dus gtan kyang dngos po rags pa ltar shes pa*), produces agreement with that (*de dang mthun pa skye bas*), so emptiness-unthinkable experience does not dawn from within (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams nang nas mi 'char la*). This is crucial: if one grasps at coarse physical objects as the object of gnad, recognition cannot occur because coarse objects are already solidified by dualistic perception. The phrase "emptiness-unthinkable experience" (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams*) refers to the direct recognition beyond concept (*rtog pa*) of emptiness (*stong nyid*). Risk of object-gnad dualism: treating "object" (*yul*) as something external to recognize rather than awareness's own display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" and "inner" are pedagogical designations pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The "mixing" of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*) is not a mixing of two separate things but the recognition that they were never truly separate.>

<The definitive teaching on awareness (*rig pa*) and emptiness (*stong pa*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The opening statement—nam mkha' stong pa la rig pa stong pa gtad pas ("having placed awareness-as-emptiness upon space-as-emptiness")—establishes the non-dual basis where space, emptiness, and awareness are not separate entities. The subsequent analysis of experience-emptiness equal to space (*nyams stong gsal 'phro 'du dang bral ba*) appearing as spontaneous-uncorrected display (*phyal yas pa cig 'char*) marks the definitive mode: awareness never departs from its own self-display. The statement of purpose—dngos po mtshan dang bral ba'i dgos pa yod de ("there exists a purpose of phenomena free from characteristics")—refers to recognition-function, not ontological status. The citation from sems sde (mind class) on yoga's abiding in space indicates that even provisional teachings point toward definitive ground. The *yul nam mkha' dang mthun pa'i nyams stong* ("experience-emptiness consistent with space") phrase establishes that valid experience is inseparable from the empty nature of appearance.

These are not three stages or optional perspectives but a single recognition described from different angles: (1) the nature of awareness is the display (*dbyings*), not a separate object; (2) awareness never becomes separate from its own display; (3) in that non-separation, samsara and nirvana are already the same taste. The phrase *dbyings* (expanse) refers to awareness's own capacity to display; *rig pa* refers to the knowing quality; they are one nature (*ngo bo gcig*), two aspects (*rnam pa gnyis*). The citation from bstan bu continues this analysis.

The instruction: relying on object (*yul*) and door (*sgo*) together, when wind is calmed (*rlung dal ba*) then hold awareness in concentration (*rig pa btson du gzung ba*)—this is *upāya* (skillful means), not definitive truth. The explanation that wind becomes calm causes expansion outward and holding inward is a provisional causal description for recognition preparation, not actual causation. The internal movement of concepts ceasing (*nang du rnam par rtog pa nub pa*) when wind is calmed creates conditions for recognition. The secret practice of awareness directly seeing (*gsang bar rig pa mngon sum du mthong ba*) and working in that manner accomplishes that even afflictions do not appear in that nature—all this describes the experiential process, not ontological transformation. The goal—sangs rgya bar byed pa ("to fully awaken")—refers to recognition of what was never obscured, not attainment of new state.

The repeated statement—rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub ("by wind-awareness calming, wisdom is accomplished")—appears three times with slight variations in the Tibetan (rab tu 'phang ba las byung bas / ces pa dang*). The crucial analysis: from fully releasing, body and mind connection dissolved, therefore even not reversed in three realms (*khams gsum du yang zlog pa min*). This establishes definitive recognition: when awareness recognizes itself, body-mind duality never existed, so "reversing" it is meaningless. The three realms do not dissolve because they never truly existed as separate from awareness. The final statement—rig pa'i gnad lu gu rgyud dbyings kyi ra bar bzhag nas mi 'gul bar byed pa ste ("having placed the awareness-gnad in the middle of the continuum between vessel-hook-continuum and expanse, make it not waver")—points to direct introduction. The "middle between" (*ra bar*) does not refer to spatial location but to the recognition that awareness is neither grasping at form (*lu*—vessel) nor clinging to continuum (*nu*—thread) but resting as expanse (*dbyings*).

[RISK: VISUALIZATION-INTERPRETATION]
<The three eyes (*spyan gsum*) description operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structural recognition coordinates. The analysis continues from previous gnad: the wind-rig method enables recognition of three-eyed viewing. These are not literal eyes to visualize but recognition's three modes of seeing: (1) seeing through the dharmata-eye clearing latencies downward; (2) seeing through wisdom-eye looking evenly as same-taste of samsara-nirvana; (3) seeing through prajña-eye looking downward which settles wisdom-appearance. The "looking" directions (upward, even, downward) refer to recognition's orientation toward aspects of itself, not spatial directions. The instruction that "lazy ones need Sambhogakaya posture, diligent ones Nirmanakaya, equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture" (*g.yo ba ni longs sku, brtson 'byor ni sprul sku, btang snyoms ni chos sku'i bzhugs stangs la bzhag*) indicates that different practitioners require different entry-points based on their predominant capacity (*dbang po*).

The commentary elaborates: through slow-wind reliance (*rlung dal ba bsten pas*), the meaning of separation from activity arises in continuum (*bya ba dang bral ba'i don rgyud la skye*); awareness-knot placed in "A" syllable (*rig pa lu gu rgyud ar la gtad pas*) causes conceptual sources to exhaust (*rnam par rtog pa'i khungs zad nas*), delusion returns to ground (*'khrul pa gzhi la log ste*), and mother-child wisdoms meet (*ye shes ma bu phrad pa'o*). The phrase "mother-child wisdoms meeting" (*ye shes ma bu phrad*) refers to the meeting of primordial wisdom (mother) and recognition wisdom (child)—not two things meeting but recognition of their inseparability. The crucial statement: "Awareness separated from wind, without going-coming (*rig pa rlung dang bral nas 'gro 'ong du med pa*), is awareness entering itself (*rig pa la rang byan tshud pa*)." This establishes that recognition is not produced but discovered: awareness has never truly been separate from itself; the apparent separation is wind-agitation (*rlung*), and when wind settles, awareness naturally enters itself.

This produces extreme training (*shin tu 'byongs*) and meditative knowing (*sgom shes pa*).

The phrase "unconfused buddha" (*ma 'khrul pa'i sangs rgyas*) refers to awareness itself, which has never been confused—only apparently so through dualistic perception. The phrase "primordial purity spontaneous presence self-radiance" (*ka dag lhun grub kyi rang gdangs*) indicates the three aspects: (1) primordial purity (*ka dag*)—never corrupted by defilements; (2) spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*)—not created by causes; (3) self-radiance (*rang gdangs*)—self-displaying without external agent. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of visualization misunderstanding: treating "golden thread hovering in sky" as visualization to create rather than metaphorical description of awareness's subtle self-radiance.

The citation: "Slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom (*rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub*); from that (*de las*) appearance becomes four (*snang ba bzhir 'gyur te*)—(1) dharmata actual appearance (*chos nyid mngon sum snang ba yis*) destroys intellectual grasping-view (*yid dpyod 'dzin pa'i lta ba bsnubs*); (2) experience-appearance increase upward (*nyams snang gong du 'phel ba yis*) causes delusion-appearance to disappear (*'khrul pa'i snang ba nub par byed*); (3) rigpa measure-reached appearance (*rig pa tshad phebs snang ba yis*) transcends three-kaya realization-path-appearance (*sku gsum rtogs pa'i lam snang 'das*); (4) dharmata exhaustion-appearance (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba yis*) cuts three-realm samsara continuum (*khams gsum 'khor ba'i rgyun thag bcad*)." These four appearances are not sequential stages but simultaneous modalities of recognition-deepening: (1) direct appearance (*mngon sum*)—recognition itself; (2) experiential increase (*nyams 'phel*)—recognition's deepening; (3) measure-completion (*tshad phebs*)—recognition's fullness; (4) exhaustion (*zad pa*)—recognition's consummation. The phrase "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) indicates that recognition reaches its natural measure without exceeding or falling short. The phrase "exhaustion" (*zad pa*) refers to exhaustion of dualistic perception, not exhaustion of awareness itself. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of fourfold appearance essentializing: treating these "four" as mandatory sequential progression rather than recognition-descriptions. The Dzogchen view recognizes these as awareness's own display (*rang snang*), never departing from primordial purity (*ka dag*), spontaneously self-liberating (*rang grol) without effort (*lhun grub*).>

[RISK: FOURFOLD DIVISION REIFICATION]
<The detailed enumeration of fourfold appearance divisions operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The statement: "The four appearances are definitely (*snang ba bzhir grangs nges pa ni*)" then lists: (1) external (*phyir*) sun-moon four-times increase-decrease (*nam zla dus bzhi'i 'phel zad pa*); (2) internal (*nang du*) body-speech-mind-consciousness four bindings liberation (*lus ngag yid sems bzhi'i bcings pa las dgrol ba*); (3) secret (*gsang bar*) four-empowerments definitive showing (*dbang bzhi'i nges pa ston pa*); (4) suchness (*de kho na nyid du*) four-lamp appearances definitive (*sgron ma bzhi'i snang ba nges pa*), therefore looking at that (*la ltos nas*) four are definite (*bzhir nges so*). This establishes that the "four appearances" manifest on multiple levels: external (cosmic cycles), internal (subtle body), secret (empowerment), and suchness (ultimate). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from structural mapping. Risk of fourfold division reification: treating these "four" as rigid categories rather than pedagogical presentation of the same recognition from different angles. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "external sun-moon," "internal four bindings," "secret four empowerments," and "suchness four lamps" all refer to the same recognition displayed through different modes: the cosmic, the energetic, the empowering, and the ultimate. All four point to awareness's self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated nature.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SEQUENTIAL STAGE FETISHISM]
<The explanation of definite sequence (*go rims nges pa*) operates from *sems*-side pedagogy. The explanation: without seeing first ground dharmata-directly (*dang po'i gzhi chos nyid mngon sum ma mthong na*), the remaining three have no arising-basis (*lhag ma gsum gyi 'char gzhi med pas*), therefore first dharmata-direct-appearance arises as support-base (*rten dang brten pa'i gzhir dang po chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba 'char ba'o*). When that itself (*de nyid shar bas*) dawns, seeing all dharmas' meaning (*chos thams cad kyi don mthong bas*), obtaining self-arisen wisdom from self (*rang byung gi ye shes rang las rnyed pa zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that recognition is not attainment of new wisdom but recognition of what has always been self-arisen (*rang byung*). The crucial instruction: that appearance (*de nas mngon pa de*) if not taken as experience (*nyams su ma myong na*), no fruit arises from mere words (*tshig tsam la 'bras bu mi 'byung ba las*), but experiencing the meaning (*don nyams su myong bas*) causes that experience to increase upward (*de'i nyams gong 'phel du byung ba'o*). Therefore, the measure of experience-arisen (*de ltar nyams skyes pa'i tshad*) must be stabilized (*brtan par byed dgos te*): without stabilizing (*ma brtan na*) no confidence enters experience (*nyams la thug pa med pas*), not holding dharma (*chos la zin pa med*), and no warmth arises (*sangs la rgya rgyu mi 'byung ba las*)—when reaching the measure of experience-stabilization (*nyams brtan pa'i tshad la phebs pas*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of sequential stage fetishism: taking the "first...then..." structure as mandatory temporal progression rather than pedagogical presentation of logical dependence. The Dzogchen view recognizes that the "sequence" describes recognition's logical structure, not its temporal unfolding: recognition must first recognize its own nature before "deepening" can occur, but in actual recognition, all four aspects are simultaneously present.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: FRUITION DEFERRAL]
<The arising of awareness-measure-reached appearance (*rig pa tshad phebs kyi snang ba byung ba*) marks definitive Dzogchen view. The crucial distinction: even when rigpa-appearance reaches measure (*rig pa'i snang ba tshad la phebs*), if it does not change into something other than that (*kyang de las gzhan du mi 'gyur na*), it is not different from considering three kayas as fruition (*sku gsum 'bras bur 'dod pa dang khyad med la*), and from apparent marks/signs (*dngos snang mtshan ma*) one does not hope for meaning's fruition (*chos la don gyi 'bras bu re ba thun mong ba rnams dang khyad med pa las*)—this indicates that Dzogchen view does not treat three kayas as goals to attain in future but as recognition of what is present. The explanation: appearance-experience (*snang nyams*) dissolves into ground (*gzhi la thim ste*), subtle-coarse appearance-grasping ceases (*phra rags kyi snang 'dzin nub nas*), and through engaging in primordial purity dharma-exhaustion (*ka dag chos zad la spyod pas*), dharmata-exhaustion-appearance arises (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba byung ba'o*). This establishes that recognition is not progressive but revelatory: when experience dissolves into its ground, grasping ceases, and one abides in primordial purity (*ka dag*), what arises is dharmata-exhaustion—not dharmata destroyed but recognition that dharmata has never been obscured (*zad pa*). The detailed structure: first two (*de dag kyang dang po gnyis*) are Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*), measure-reached (*tshad phebs*) is Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*), exhaustion (*zad pa*) is Dharmakaya (*chos sku*). Through making them path-appearance (*chos sku'i snang ba lam du byas pas*), three kayas appear as path-appearance (*sku gsum lam snang du shar bas*), and fruition dharma-exhaustion primordial purity reaches expanse (*'bras bu chos zad ka dag gi dbyings la thug pa'i phyir*). The conclusion: self-appearance's potency-three kayas (*rang snang gi rtsal sku gsum*) dissolve into rigpa's state (*rig pa'i ngang du thim pas*)—this is rigpa-primordial-purity's fruition (*rig pa ka dag gi 'bras bu*). From rigpa's expanse (*rig pa'i dbyings nas*), primordially self-potency-three kayas arise (*gdod kyis rang rtsal sku gsum shar bas*) and perform benefit (*don byed pa*), which is called (*zhes bya ste*) "essence not even heard by name from other vehicles" (*g pa gzhan nas ming yang mi grag pa'i snying po*) and "King of Vehicles' intention" (*g pa rgyal po'i dgongs pa*). This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of fruition deferral: interpreting "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) as a goal to achieve rather than recognition's own self-display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that fruition was never separate from ground of recognition: three kayas are not attained but recognized as self-display (*rang snang*).>

The detailed analysis of direct appearance (*dang po la gnyis te*) includes two aspects: (1) general connection-establishment (*mngon sum spyi'i 'brel dgod pa dang*)—recognizing the fundamental connection between appearance and awareness; (2) individual characteristic ascertainment (*rang gi mtshan nyid dngos gzung ba'o*)—recognizing the unique characteristics of each appearance. The four types of direct appearance: (1) *dang po ni spyir mngon sum*—conventional direct appearance (*kun rdzob tha snyad la grags pa'i mngon sum*), which appears as five sense-objects (*dbang po'i mngon sum gzugs sogs yul lnga snang ba'i rang bzhin*); (2) *yid kyi mngon sum*—mental direct appearance (*nyid kyi mngon sum*), which appears as conceptual certainty in conceptual object (*yid kyi mngon sum yul nye bar spyod pa rgyu mtshan nges pa'i rtog yul na snang ba*); (3) *rang rig pa'i mngon sum*—self-awareness direct appearance (*rang rig pa'i mngon sum*), which experiences internal bliss/suffering (*nang du bde sdug la sogs myong ba ces pa'i snang ba*); (4) *rnal 'byor gyi mngon sum*—yogic direct appearance, which directly encounters suchness (*nyid kyi don nye bar mjal ba de kho na nyid*), entering suchness, individual correct rigpa and its appearance-object non-dual (*so so yang dag pa'i rig pa dang de'i snang yul gnyis su med pa*), free from grasping-grasped experience certainty (*'dzin dang bral bar myong ba'i nges pa ste*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of direct appearance classification: treating these "four types" as rigid categories rather than pedagogical presentation. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all four "direct appearances" are conventional designations (*tha snyad*) for what is ultimately single awareness-display (*rang snang*). The phrase "conventional direct appearance" (*kun rdzob tha snyad la grags pa'i mngon sum*) indicates that even "direct appearance" is ultimately conventional when spoken of as "type"—actual recognition transcends all classification. The phrase "self-awareness direct appearance" refers to awareness's self-knowledge (*rang rig*)—not separate knower and known. The phrase "yogic direct appearance" refers to recognition through yoga (union) of samsara-nirvana (*'khor 'das*), not a special achievement beyond ordinary experience. The definitive view transcends even these four: direct appearance is not "seen" (*mthong ba*) but recognized as awareness's own nature (*rang ngo*).>

[RISK: VISUALIZATION-INTERPRETATION]
<The wisdom-lights (*ye shes lnga*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The analysis that also, basis and delusion-circle (*gzhan yang rtsa dang 'khrul 'khor gyis*) nature's five-lights (*rang bzhin gnas pa'i ye shes lnga*)—this establishes that awareness's five lights are recognition's own display, not caused by basis or delusion. The instruction that in water-well, eyes seeing (*chu bur migis mthong ba'o*)—this is *upāya* describing recognition's capacity to see its own reflection (like water-well reflecting sky). The statement that from self-born (*rang shar las*) wisdom-lights, having light (*ye shes lnga ldan 'od kyi sku*)—establishes that five lights are awareness's own luminous quality, not external illumination. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "five lights" and "water-well" as visual techniques rather than recognition-descriptions.>

[RISK: REIFICATION]
<The vessel-hook-continuum (*lu gu rgyud*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The instruction that in vessel-hook-continuum, thoroughly-shining (*lu gu rgyud du rab tu gsal*)—establishes that recognition is already luminous in the continuum of form (*lu* = vessel/body), hook (*gu* = connection), continuum (*rgyud* = thread/sequence). The statement that also going and coming (*de yang 'gro dang 'ong ba dang*)—this indicates that recognition's display appears and disappears continuously, like coming and going. The teaching on grasping and destruction (*'gul ba dang ni 'phrig pa'o*)—this is *sems-side* provisional describing delusion's function: grasping at phenomena as "grasp-able" and "destruction-possible." Risk of reification: treating "vessel-hook-continuum" as anatomical structure rather than metaphor for recognition-display.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SENG GE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PERSONIFICATION]
<The *Seng Ge* (Lion?) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation from *Seng Ge* (*seng ge rtsal rdzogs las*): self-display (*rang snang*), phenomena (*rig pa'i dngos po de*) in vessel-hook-continuum, abiding (*ye shes gu lu rgyud du gnas*)—this establishes that awareness's phenomena abide within the vessel-hook-continuum of recognition-display. The citation from *Nor Bu Phra* (Precious-One who constructed?) (*nor bu 'phra bkod las*): suffering (*rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma*)—this is *sems-side* provisional describing how delusion manifests as suffering, like carrying heavy burden. The statement that also, in that, yang (*la yang dag par rdzogs pa'i sangs rgyas rig pa lu gu rgyud kyi sku yongs su gsal lo zhes so*)—establishes that the Fully-Awakening's awareness in vessel-hook-continuum is thoroughly shining.

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: METHODOLOGISM]
<The experience method (*nyams su blang lugs*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured approach. The instruction that in affliction and ground, great-quantity (*dang po thun chung la grangs mang du bya*)—this describes that many recognitions (*grangs*) should occur within the context of affliction (*dang po*) and ground (*thun chung la*). The two, three (*gnyis pa la thun bskyed cing yun bsring*)—refers to recognition of two aspects or three aspects with consistency (*yun bsring*). The statement that three (*gsum pa la nyin mtshan med par nyams su blangs zhing*)—indicates that the three recognitions are distinguished without characteristics (*nyin mtshan med*). Risk of methodologism: treating "experience method" as graduated technique rather than recognition-framework.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIALIZATION]
<The awareness-in-expanse-between (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcug pa las*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that awareness in expanse's between, not waver, make (*mi 'gul bar byed de*)—this is the definitive instruction on how recognition rests. The "between" (*ra bar*) does not refer to spatial location but to the recognition that awareness is neither grasping at display nor separate from it. The instruction to "make not waver" (*mi 'gul bar byed*)—this is not effort to stabilize something unstable but recognition of what has never moved. Risk of spatialization: treating "in expanse's between" as literal location rather than recognition-description of non-duality.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: FRUITION REIFICATION]
<The *Sgron ma 'bar ba* (Blazing Lamp) citation—"Expanse makes awareness's own field (*dbyings kyis rig pa'i rang yul byed*); vajra is hanging cord (*rdo rje nyid ni lu gu rgyud*); this placed within (*'di nyid nang du gzhag par bya*)"—establishes definitive Dzogchen view through tantric imagery. The phrase "hanging cord" (*lu gu rgyud*) refers to the self-coiled nature of awareness, never requiring unknotting. The statement "this placed within" (*'di nyid nang du gzhag par bya*) indicates that recognition is not production of something new but recognition of what has always been present within. The term "fruition" (*'bras bu*) in Dzogchen does not mean future attainment but recognition of ever-present ground (*gzhi*). This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of fruition reification: treating "fruition" as something to attain rather than recognition of what has always been present. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "vajra" (*rdo rje*) refers to awareness's indestructible nature, not an external implement. The "hanging cord" (*lu gu rgyud*) is metaphorical description of awareness's self-arisen and self-coiled nature, not an actual cord to untangle.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBTLE BODY REIFICATION]
<The detailed explanation of fruition (*'bras bu*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The explanation: when outer expanse-appearance (*phyi'i dbyings snang la*) eye does not move in its own time (*mig mi 'gul ba'i rang dus na*), inner rigpa abides in ground (*nang du rig pa gzhi la gnas pas*), radiance self-dissolves (*gdangs rang thim la*) returning (*'khor nas*), separated from spleen-wind's horse (*glo ba'i rlung gi rta dang bral bas*), wisdom's sky (*ye shes kyi nam mkha'*) dissolves into expanse's sky (*dbyings kyi nam mkha' la thim nas*), liberating as equal-limitless without category (*ngo mnyam ris med du grol bas*). This describes not attainment but recognition of ever-present nature. The phrase "spleen-wind's horse" (*glo ba'i rlung gi rta*) refers to subtle energy riding wind—the apparent movement of subtle energy when not recognized. The phrase "separated from" (*dang bral bas*) indicates that when recognition occurs, apparent separation between energy and awareness ceases. The conclusion: primordial purity's rigpa (*ka dag gi rig pa*) not moving from expanse (*dbyings la ma g.yos par*), heart-center naturally (*snying ga na*) clear-light intention (*'od gsal ba'i dgongs pa*) self-naturally abides (*rang bzhin gyis gnas te*). The yogi (*rnal 'byor pa*) is called (*zhes bya bas*) "dharmata primordial clear-light captured" (*chos nyid gdod ma'i 'od gsal zin pa*), samsara name-empty (*'khor ba ming med du*), three realms corpse cut (*khams gsum gdar sha chod pa yin te*). The phrase "primordial clear-light captured" (*gdod ma'i 'od gsal zin pa*) does not mean capturing something but recognizing what has always been present. The phrase "samsara name-empty" (*'khor ba ming med du*) indicates that samsara was never truly existent as name-entity. The phrase "three realms corpse cut" (*khams gsum gdar sha chod pa*) refers to recognition that cyclic existence was never truly real—the "corpse" is the death of apparent reality through recognition. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of subtle body reification: treating "spleen-wind's horse" as anatomical entity rather than metaphorical description of energy-movement. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all descriptions point to recognition: awareness has never moved from expanse, heart-center is naturally clear-light, and samsara was name-empty from the beginning.>

[RISK: LIBERATION PROGRESSIVE MISUNDERSTANDING]
<The *Thal 'Gyur* citation on direct-appearance gnad (*chos nyid mngon sum gnad*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation: "Therefore (*des ni*) dharmata direct-appearance gnad (*chos nyid mngon sum gnad*)—seeing merely knows (*mthong ba tsam gyis shes pa dang*), knowing realizes (*de shes pa yis rtogs pa dang*), realizing merely liberates (*rtogs pa tsam gyis grol bar 'gyur*), liberation is not separate (*grol zhes bkrol ba ma yin te*)—sky dissolves into sky (*nam mkha' dag ni nam mkha' la*), dissolves (*thim nas*), self-nature unobservable (*rang bzhin dmigs med pas*), without category (*ris med cha shas yod ma yin*), without parts (*mngon sum rnyed pa'i skal ldan pa*), three realms samsara name-empty (*khams gsum 'khor ba ming med pas*), three realms corpse cut (*srid gsum gdar sha chod pa'o*)." This is definitive pointing: liberation is not result of practice (*grol bkrol ba ma yin*) but recognition of nature's already-liberated state. The phrase "seeing merely knows" (*mthong ba tsam gyis shes pa*) indicates that recognition is not intellectual understanding (*rtogs pa*) but immediate knowing (*shes pa*). The phrase "knowing realizes" (*de shes pa yis rtogs pa*) indicates that recognition (*shes pa*) naturally realizes without effort. The phrase "realizing merely liberates" (*rtogs pa tsam gyis grol bar 'gyur*) establishes that liberation is not produced by realization but recognized as ever-present. The phrase "sky dissolves into sky" (*nam mkha' dag ni nam mkha' la thim nas*) indicates that recognition is not transformation but revelation of what has always been. The phrase "self-nature unobservable" (*rang bzhin dmigs med pas*) refers to awareness's self-nature being beyond objectification, not that it cannot be recognized. The phrase "without category without parts" (*ris med cha shas yod ma yin, mngon sum rnyed pa'i skal ldan pa*) indicates that recognition transcends all classification, not that it is featureless. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of liberation progressive misunderstanding: treating "liberation" as progressive process rather than recognition of ever-present state. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "three realms corpse cut" (*khams gsum gdar sha chod pa*) refers to recognition that cyclic existence was never truly real, not destruction of something real.>

[ORDINARY COGNITION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: EXPERIENCE INCREASE ACCUMULATION]
<The experience-increasing appearance (*nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba*) section presents experiential dimension of recognition. The brief teaching (*mdor bstan pa ni*): expanse-rigpa upwardly increasingly purified (*dbyings rig la gong nas gong du sbyangs pas*), outer expanse-appearance (*phyir dbyings snang du*) rigpa-snake-knot non-dually abides (*rig pa lu gu rgyud dbyer med du gnas pa bzhin*); inner primordial purity empty-expanse (*nang du ka dag gi stong dbyings la*) self-radiance (*rang gdangs kyi*) rigpa-expanse (*rig dbyings*) non-dually abides (*gnyis med du gnas pas*), clear-light mother-child meet (*'od gsal ma bu 'dres te*), various appearance-experiences increase (*snang nyams sna tshogs su 'phel ba ni*). This describes the natural unfoldment of recognition when dualistic confusion dissolves: not accumulation of experience (*nyams 'phel*) in conventional sense but revealing of what was always present. The phrase "upwardly increasingly purified" (*gong nas gong du sbyangs pas*) indicates progressive clearing of obscurations, not progressive building of recognition. The phrase "rigpa-snake-knot non-dually abides" (*rig pa lu gu rgyud dbyer med du gnas pa*) refers to awareness's self-coiled nature never separate from expanse, not an actual knot. The phrase "clear-light mother-child meet" (*'od gsal ma bu 'dres te*) refers to primordial wisdom (mother) and recognition wisdom (child) meeting—not two things meeting but recognition of their inseparability. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of experience increase accumulation: treating "experience increase" (*nyams 'phel*) as accumulation of special experiences rather than natural unfoldment of recognition. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "increase" (*'phel*) refers to clearing of obscurations revealing what was always present, not building something new.>

<The *Thal 'Gyur* citation on experience-appearance increase (*nyams kyi snang ba gong 'phel ni*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation: "Experience-appearance increase upward is (*nyams kyi snang ba gong 'phel ni*)—wisdom color outwardly arising (*ye shes kha dog phyir byung nas*), upright-standing and spokes arise (*gyen 'greng ba dang rtsibs shar dang*), various thigle as body (*thig le sna tshogs sku nyid du*), clear to appearing object's field (*rags par snang ba'i yul la gsal*), it is said (*ces so*)." The phrase "wisdom color outwardly arising" (*ye shes kha dog phyir byung nas*) indicates that wisdom-display naturally manifests outwardly when recognition occurs. The phrase "upright-standing and spokes arise" (*gyen 'greng ba dang rtsibs shar dang*) refers to the natural manifestation of five-color energy as awareness-display. The phrase "various thigle as body" (*thig le sna tshogs sku nyid du*) indicates that subtle energy-drops manifest as body without separation. The phrase "clear to appearing object's field" (*rags par snang ba'i yul la gsal*) indicates that recognition clears apparent objects by recognizing them as awareness-display. The extensive explanation (*rgyas par bshad pa ni*): experience-increase's experience two (*nyams gong 'phel ces pa'i nyams la gnyis te*), knowing's experience (*shes pa'i nyams dang*) and appearance's experience (*snang ba'i nyams so*). This is not dualistic separation but pedagogical presentation of recognition's experiential aspects: knowing (*shes pa*) refers to awareness's self-knowing nature; appearance (*snang ba*) refers to awareness's self-display. The phrase "knowing's experience and appearance's experience" indicates that recognition involves both self-knowing and self-displaying as experiential dimensions. The continuation: knowing's experience arises from reliance (*shes nyams la 'jig rten pa'i shes nyams*... [text continues]). This establishes that knowing-experience depends on reliance on recognition-basis. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of experience qualification: treating "knowing's experience" and "appearance's experience" as separate categories rather than dimensions of single recognition. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "experience" (*nyams*) is not achievement but natural radiance of recognition when confusion self-liberates.>

The statement from that, beginning and worn-out (*'di nyid thog ma bar dang mthar goms pa las*)—this indicates that recognition is not through gradual practice but primordial beginning.

The gnad: body-speech gnad (*lus ngag gnad*)—accumulated wind, mind's object, separated (*gcun pas rlung sems bag la zha nas*)—this indicates that when wind is calmed and mind-object separation recognized, recognition rests naturally.

The worn-out experience (*mthar 'gyur gyi nyams ni*) wind experience's appearance (*rlung nyams kyi snang cha ste*)—this indicates that recognition's experience through wind is described as seeing various displays like child (*rin bu me khyer lta bu dang*).
