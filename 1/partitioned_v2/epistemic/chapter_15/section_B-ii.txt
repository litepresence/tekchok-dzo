[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DHARMAKAYA POSTURE THREE UNMOVING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: POSTURAL OBSESSION]
<Dharmakaya's posture speech explained: three unmoving essence realized, three bindings measure obtained, three confidences liberation shown, four fearlessnesses. Body like three perfected lions' strengths, whoever without fear, body's key point dispels three realms' fear. Continuous sitting key point—body dog's crouch dharmadhatu and rigpa meet. The posture is support for recognition, not recognition itself. Risk of postural obsession: fixating on physical position rather than recognizing mind's nature.>
[5717-5734] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR EMPOWERMENTS FOUR CONFIDENCES]
[DECLERATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: RITUALISM]
<Four empowerments' fruit direct becoming arising! Dharmata direct perception body like tortoise-shell vessel—channels slowly abiding. Dzogchen meaning effort-free, body's limbs entered! Pot empowerment elaborate wisdom self-arisen! Increase-above body like diseased person—central wind entered! Secret empowerment non-elaborate wisdom! Measure-arrived body like sinking elephant—mind channels wind obtained! Heart entered prajna wisdom! Four confidences: view confidence, meditation confidence, action confidence, result confidence. The empowerments and confidences are recognition, not ritual transmissions. Risk of ritualism: treating these as ceremonies rather than pointing to natural state.>
[5873-5892] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR GREAT CONFIDENCES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CERTAINTY AS ATTACHMENT]
<Buddha's qualities heard also obtain hope and thrill not—self-established three bodies complete confidence! Action and afflictions' cause-effect heard also delusion-vision samsara fall fear not—cause-effect transcended confidence! Nirvana's own place seen also liberate hope's joy-thrill not—primordial purity self-complete strong place obtained confidence! Four arising! From Jewel Garland. The four confidences are natural expressions, not attained certainties. Risk: treating confidence as attachment to certainty rather than freedom from doubt.>
[5907-5934] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TEN GROUNDS SIMULTANEOUS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: STAGE PROGRESSION]
<From Self-Arisen: "Ground called elsewhere existing not! Truth-seeing person one to grounds all complete existing!" Introduction-shown person that, first truth-seeing's time joy arisen is first ground Great Joy! That self-vision awareness-ground second ground Stainless obtained! Then habituation third ground Light-Doing! Habituated light's vision seeing fourth ground Light-Radiating! Fifth Difficult-to-Overcome, sixth Manifest, seventh Far-Going, eighth Immovable, ninth Perfect Intellect, tenth Cloud-Dharma! All ten grounds are complete in one moment of truth-seeing. Risk of stage progression: reading these as sequential rather than simultaneous.>
[5935-5962] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GROUNDS ELEVEN TO FIFTEEN]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: HIERARCHICAL SUPERIORITY]
<Thirteen letter wheel gathering great ground conquered! Then wisdom's appearance abiding fourteenth ground Great Samadhi conquered! Then spontaneous presence ground certainty obtained fifteenth ground Vajra-Holder obtained! The enumeration continues but all are primordially complete. Risk of hierarchical superiority: treating higher numbers as better rather than recognizing all as descriptions of one ground.>
[5963-6002] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE GREAT EMPTINESSES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: EMPTINESS AS VOID]
<Dharmas exhausted intellect-transcended meaning zinc-tin reliance wisdom change-change not recognition! Effortless vast great expanse all primordially transcended, bondage liberation abandon-accept not-existing manner samsara nirvana nameless great roll! Three: nature Dzogchen byar not sky-like meaning, bondage liberation non-dual own-mind emptiness root-free great thig-decided, object-vision mind's mirror collection six great pervade! First: outer vision inner awareness grasping-holding vision signs samsara nirvana gathered dharmas all—primordial emptiness universal emptiness great! Appearance-emptiness, intellect-emptiness, pure-emptiness, liberation-emptiness great! The three great emptinesses are not void but freedom from extremes. Risk of emptiness as void: nihilistic interpretation rather than emptiness as luminous clarity.>
[6027-6041] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND MEDITATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ANTI-MEDITATION NIHILISM]
<Object-thought transcended liberation arisen! Direction-limitless nameless arisen roll! Not-look look not, look-doer not, looked not see! Not-meditate meditated not, meditate transcended, meditated also not liberate! Not-analyze analyzed not, analyzed not see! Spontaneous self-liberation is view! Effort-free self-established meditation! No-activity conduct! Result not-hope! The transcendence of meditation is not rejection but recognition of natural completion. Risk of anti-meditation nihilism: rejecting all practice rather than recognizing practice and non-practice as non-dual.>
[6088-6105] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-APPEARANCE GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SOLIPSISM]
<Self and holding's attachment object, first itself dharmadhatu, this all self self-appearance! From Jewel Garland. The self-appearance is not solipsistic projection but the ground's natural display. Risk of solipsism: interpreting "self-appearance" as individual mind's creation rather than the non-dual play of awareness.>
[6139-6161] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DELUSION AS WISDOM]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DELUSION AFFIRMATION]
<Vision delusion's nature this, wisdom is previously not seen! Concept-with delusion's basis not-existing, alaya dharmakaya great realized! Delusion's self-concept continuity ceased! Thus delusion-free vision, primordially fallen main-point from arising! Beings' aggregates buddha body, primordially is who not awareness! Aggregates buddha possession-lord, channels abiding letters completely arise! Vision delusion is wisdom when recognized. Risk of delusion affirmation: mistaking this as permission to remain deluded rather than urgent call to recognize.>
[6162-6185] 
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BUBBLES IN EYES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PHENOMENAL ILLUSION]
<Bubbles in eyes—wisdom self-appearance who not seen? From Jewel Garland: "This also quality gem, Again quality this-like." Two-non-existent self-dissolving, river space analogies. Water drops indistinguishable yet flowing, space no separation. Two-non-existent both extremes dissolved, single-one free from elaboration. All bodies speeches continuums exhaust into nirvana by self-dissolving. Extreme self pure—like space dissolving into space. The analogies point to non-dual recognition, not phenomenal illusion. Risk of phenomenal illusion: treating appearances as merely illusory rather than wisdom-display.>
