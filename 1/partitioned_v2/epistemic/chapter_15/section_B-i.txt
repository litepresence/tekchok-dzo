[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LINEAGE BLESSING AS SELF-LIBERATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DEVOTIONALISM]
"Our supreme gurus Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava—those relying on such supreme ones, this life or bardo without doubt liberated!"
[CONTEXT] LINEAGE HISTORY: Vimalamitra (*bi ma la*) and Padmasambhava (*pad+ma 'byung gnas*) represent the two primary transmission streams of *snying thig*—the oral lineage (*snyan brgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*). Longchenpa received both streams, integrating them in his *mdzod* corpus. The assertion that reliance on such masters guarantees "this life or bardo" liberation reflects the Nyingma view of lineage blessing (*byin rlabs*) not as external grace but as recognition-support.
Epistemic precision: The phrase "this or bardo" (*'di'am bar do*) establishes the two-fold temporal framework—immediate recognition or recognition during intermediate state. Risk: Devotionalism—misunderstanding reliance on gurus as faith-based dependency rather than recognition-facilitation.

Citation from *gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*: "Inner body exhaustion place reached, fingers and so on thus appearing, this relied-upon elements self-cease! Birth and entering's distinction, all dharmas exhausted self-place, anything grasping not, dwelling thus emanation body! This entering force's power, birth's self-power who obtained? That also that relied-upon, again time thus done, appearance's self-sound rustling, manifest reverse confusion appears! This beings' benefit all does! Awareness equal one thus! Three thousand beings' great transference this accomplishes! Thus gradual and instantaneous body this accomplishes! All body exhaustion measure liberated! All fruit certain! Supreme ground great mandala accomplished!"
[CONTEXT] TANTRIC CITATION: The *gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud* (Secret Practice Seed Tantra) belongs to the *rdo rje phreng ba* (Vajra Garland) cycle, cited frequently in Nyingma *snying thig* literature. The "three thousand beings" (*stong phrag gsum*) refers to the cosmic number of sentient beings in traditional cosmology, here liberated through the "great transference" (*'pho ba chen mo*), the Dzogchen practice of consciousness-transference at death.
Epistemic precision: The paradox "appearance's self-sound rustling, manifest reverse confusion appears" (*snang ba'i rang sgra sil skad de mngon du log ste 'khrul par snang*) captures the Dzogchen view that recognition of appearance as self-liberated simultaneously reveals and transcends confusion. Risks: Nihilism—reading "body exhaustion" as literal destruction; Reification—taking "great mandala" as spatial entity.

The gnad that no doubt (*'di'am bar do*) arises (*'byung*) from this proper reliance—this indicates that when reliance is correct, liberation (*'di'am bar do*) arises spontaneously without doubt (*'byung*).

That reversed, outer body's appearance seen, inner wind's movement exhausts! Dharmakāya's dwelling also: sound explained: "Lion three powers complete, to any not fear," body vital-point three realms' fear dispels!
[CONTEXT] POSTURE SYMBOLISM: The "lion posture" (*seng ge*) represents the Dharmakāya stance—fearless, unmoving, and all-vanquishing. This triad of postures (elephant for Sambhogakāya, lion for Dharmakāya) mirrors the three-kāya structure in somatic form, a characteristic Nyingma *snying thig* teaching.
Meaning's manner division also: continuous joining vital-point: body dog-joint sitting, expanse and awareness joining makes! Sole feet earth pressing, various conceptions cease! Hand's fingers joints bent, feet two's inner side inserted, karma and afflictions' movement empties! Upper body hollow placed, always dharmatā not separate makes! Root neck placed, dharmatā's meaning not moving support makes! Second, resting wisdom's vital-point: both soles earth placed, knee slightly outer, dog-joint sitting—pervasive karma-wind reverses! That reversed, outer wisdom direction pure appearance seen, inner afflictions' stream bundle ceases! Both palms inner side inserted, grasping karma-wind ceases!
