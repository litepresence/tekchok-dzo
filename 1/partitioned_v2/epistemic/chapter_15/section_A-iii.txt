<The cessation-cognition (*'das pa'i shes*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The description of cessation-cognition, empty, clear, beyond-limit's understanding-capacity and wisdom-qualities (*'das pa'i shes nyams stong gsal mtha' bral gyi rtogs tshad shes rab kyi rtsal dang bcas pa rnams te*)—this establishes that recognition (*rtogs*) is the capacity to understand emptiness, clarity, beyond-limit without adding wisdom-qualities. The statement from that, beginning and worn-out (*'di nyid thog ma bar dang mthar goms pa las*)—this indicates that recognition is not through gradual practice but primordial beginning.

The statement that self-grasping, afflictions and (*'dzin gang zag dang*) dharmata, self-nature (*chos kyi bdag med rtog pa zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that self-grasping's afflictions are recognized as dharmata's self-nature (*bdag med*). This is *sems-side* analysis: through philosophical reasoning (*rtog pa*), one recognizes that afflictions lack self-nature. The gnad that not-existing, not-attaining (*ma gtogs pa med pas*)—this indicates that what was recognized as affliction never truly existed to attain. Risk of view collapse: mistaking *sems-side* philosophical recognition for definitive Dzogchen recognition—the former is provisional understanding through reasoning, latter is direct recognition.>

Separating (*gong 'phel ni*)—this is the provisional instruction to analyze appearance's components. All, excellent-ugly-many (*snang ba de dag je bkra je legs je mang la song ba ste*)—this describes how recognition perceives display as various qualities appearing (*song ba*).

People's appearance (*snam bu'i snang ba dang*)—this is *upāya* describing how appearance is perceived by ordinary people. The statement that wisdom-lamp (*lnga rdzogs pas*) five-color's, attaining (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog la dbang thob nas*)—establishes that wisdom-lamp attains (*dbang thob nas*) five-color's display. The analysis: grasping (*'dod chags*), trembling (*zhe sdang dang*), fear (*gti mug dang*), suffering (*nga rgyal dang*)—these are the tremors (*sdang*) and sufferings (*nga*) of grasping (*'dod chags*).

The statement that bag, not-existing, not-attaining (*bag la nyal tsam ma gtogs pa med pas*)—establishes that recognition's recognition (*mngon du*) is so subtle that grasping (*'dod chags*) falls (*nyal*) without truly existing or being attainable. The gnad that samsara's liberation, definite (*'khor ba'i phyed las 'das pa nyid do*)—this is definitive: samsara never truly existed to liberate from.

Eyes, many-distortions (*mig mangs ris dang*)—this is *upāya* describing how ordinary perception (*mig*) has many distortions (*ris*) when grasping at appearance. Appearance, like (*mig tshags kyi rnam pa lta bu dang*)—this indicates that appearance is seen through distorted vision (*mig tshags*) as various (*lta bu*).

<Masterful analysis:
That itself rim-enclosing wall and individual main retinue appearance—Dharmakaya's purification completely pure measure-reached arising. This is rigpa-measure-reached appearance: preliminary times body's actions and doings' connection measure, afterward non-arising sign. That also: though appearing those appearances from preliminary antidotes etc. crucial point, labeled arisen, they are labelers of separation-result and purification-purifier cause-effect, not produced from that arising—wisdom self-existing radiance's stain obscurations purified through power of appearance. The Dzogchen view: these "appearances" are not produced by practice but revealed through recognition. Risk of attainment-mentality: believing "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) is a goal achieved through antidotes rather than recognition of ever-present wisdom.

And *Bstan bu*: "Likewise body up to: six and ten and five-three; unerringly Sambhogakaya." The individual nature particular explanation: measure-reached definitive terminology generally shown and measure-three particular explained—two. First: rigpa-measure-reached means ground-abiding rigpa manifestly became, path-channel entered, ground-appearance's self-radiance spontaneous present arising-door body-appearance, path-appearance near exhaustion, mandala complete. Measure: first half-body to body's mandala complete. Reached: from that transcended without remainder clearly appearing. These like full moon form—waxing-waning mandala complete, self-face incontrovertible.
Second, measure-three particular explained: outer appearance, inner body measure, secret rigpa measure. First: power-over appearance, pure realm clear-light complete... [continues].
