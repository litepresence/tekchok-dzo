## USAGE GUIDELINES

### For Future Commentary Generation:

1. **Maximum 3 uses** of any single metaphor per chapter
2. **Rotate categories** - don't use same category twice in succession
3. **Fresh openings** - vary the "Some hermit..." formula:
   - "An old practitioner..."
   - "A yogi wandering..."
   - "This hermit in retreat..."
   - "Someone on pilgrimage..."
   - "A meditator..."

4. **Local specificity** - reference actual Tibetan/Nepali locations:
   - Kham/Amödo regions
   - Specific mountains (not just "the mountain")
   - Valley names
   - River crossings

5. **Seasonal awareness** - vary by implied season:
   - Spring: melting, new growth, wind
   - Summer: grazing, warmth, rain
   - Autumn: harvesting, changing colors, preparation
   - Winter: snow, cold, isolation, survival

---

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before finalizing any commentary section:

- [ ] No more than 1 "yak hair tent" per 5 sections
- [ ] No more than 2 tea references per section
- [ ] At least 1 unique/fresh metaphor per section
- [ ] Varied opening phrases
- [ ] Seasonal/time context varies
- [ ] Specific details (not generic "the mountain")

2. **Top 5 metaphors to avoid:**
   - Yak hair tent
   - Butter tea
   - Frozen butter lamp
   - Thief in empty hut  
   - Snow covering everything

3. **Top 5 fresh categories to use:**
   - High plateau lakes

   - Pilgrimage paths
   - Seasonal herding

4. **Voice variation reminders:**
   - Not always "Some hermit..."
   - Vary between "I", "this practitioner", "an old yogi"
   - Mix self-deprecating with observational
