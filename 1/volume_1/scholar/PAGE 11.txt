[323-325] [STRUCTURE] # The Threefold Body Activity: Outer Level
**Analysis:** The text presents three "face-hand" (*zhal phyag*) activities of the body:

1. **Wisdom face-hand** (*ye shes kyi zhal phyag*) — perfects the body's self-nature through wisdom
2. **Light face-hand** (*'od kyi zhal phyag*) — liberates self-appearance through luminosity  
3. **Discerning face-hand** (*shes rab kyi zhal phyag*) — perfects knowledge through prajñā

The term *zhal phyag* (Skt. *mukhahasta*) refers to symbolic hand-gestures (*mudrā*) combined with facial expressions that indicate specific enlightened qualities. The instrumental *kyis* indicates these are means (*thabs*) by which the body's qualities are perfected (*rdzogs par mdzad*).

[326-330] [CONCEPT] The Four Inner Body Activities
**Analysis:** The inner activities (*nang gi bzhi*) correspond to the classical major and minor marks of a Buddha (*lakṣaṇa* and *anuvyañjana*):

1. **Thirty-two marks** (*mtshan sum cu rtsa gnyis*) — major physical characteristics (ushnisha, wheel-marks on feet, etc.)
2. **Eighty signs** (*dpe byad brgyad cu*) — minor aesthetic qualities (copper-colored nails, round fingers, etc.)
3. **Light-ray masses** (*'od zer gyi tshogs*) — radiance indicating transcendent qualities
4. **All-pervasive face** (*zhal kun du thal le*) — complete enjoyment (*longs spyod pa*) characteristic

This enumeration follows the *Ratnagotravibhāga* and mainstream Buddhist buddhology, demonstrating Longchenpa's grounding in common Mahāyāna framework.

[331-335] [CONCEPT] The Four Secret Body Activities
**Analysis:** The secret level (*gsang ba*) describes non-conceptual, non-dual qualities:

1. **Without front or back** (*mdun dang rgyab med pa*) — non-directional, non-spatial presence; appearance-aspect (*snang cha*) complete
2. **Inside-looking, outside-clear** (*nang nas bltas na phyir gsal*) — when looking inward, outward is clear; emptiness-aspect (*stong cha*) perfected
3. **Outside-looking, inside-clear** (*phyir nas bltas na nang gsal*) — when looking outward, inward is clear; non-duality perfected
4. **Tip pervading all directions** (*rtse mo phyogs kun tu zang thal*) — non-dwelling without cessation (*mi gnas 'gag pa med pa*)

This describes the Dzogchen realization that awareness is simultaneously empty and clear (*stong gsal*), with no separation between inner/outer, and no fixation in any direction.

[336-340] [STRUCTURE] # The Four Outer Speech Activities
**Analysis:** The speech activities at the outer level describe emanation and communication:

1. **Six self-arisen syllables from tongue** (*rang byung gi yi ge drug ljags las 'phros*) — mantra as spontaneous expression
2. **Entering father's face** (*yab kyi zhal du zhugs pa*) — dissolving into the source of appearance
3. **Emerging from mother's space** (*yum gyi mkha' las 'thon pa*) — arising from emptiness
4. **Emanating and gathering** (*'phro zhing 'du ba*) — continuous play without nature

The father-mother symbolism (*yab yum*) represents the non-dual union of appearance (*snang*) and emptiness (*stong*), skillful means (*thabs*) and wisdom (*shes rab*).

[341-345] [CONCEPT] The Four Inner Speech Activities
**Analysis:** Inner speech transcends ordinary verbal communication:

1. **Self-nature explained** (*rang gi ngo bos bshad pa*) — intrinsic expression without words
2. **Non-word** (*tshig ma yin pa*) — beyond speech and thought (*smra bsam las 'das*)
3. **Appearing as understood meaning** (*don go bar snang ba*) — immediate comprehension
4. **Many light-rays from face** (*'od zer du ma zhal las 'phros*) — teaching through radiance

The phrase *brjod du med pa* (inexpressible) refers to the *nirabhilāpya* nature of ultimate truth in Madhyamaka philosophy.

[346-349] [CONCEPT] The Four Secret Speech Activities
**Analysis:** Secret activities involve pure engagement through threefold practice (*spyor ba*):

1. **Pure body practice** (*sku'i spyor ba dag pa*) — engagement with self-arisen dharma
2. **Pure speech practice** (*gsung gi spyor ba dag pa*) — engagement with outflow-free (*zag pa med pa*) dharma
3. **Pure mind practice** (*thugs kyi spyor ba dag pa*) — enjoyment of all-knowing wisdom
4. [Implied fourth] **Pure face practice** (*zhal gyi spyor ba dag pa*) — enjoyment of all-knowing dharma

The term *zag pa med pa* (outflow-free/without āsrava) indicates the transcendence of defilements (*kleśa*) and the impurities that bind beings to saṃsāra.
