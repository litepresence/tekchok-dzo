[10907-10924] [STRUCTURE] Scripture and Philosophical Analysis Integration
The section integrates scriptural citation with philosophical analysis in three phases: (1) continuation of the thugs rje description with two-line summary (10907-10908); (2) extended citation from Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Prasaṅga) tantra (10909-10924); (3) philosophical analysis of the citation's implications (10925-10944). The Thal 'gyur citation presents the threefold ground (essence-nature-compassion) and its relationship to the three bodies (dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya), culminating in the assertion that manifold appearance is the reason ground is called "ground."

[10907-10924] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terms from Thal 'gyur Citation
The citation employs key Dzogchen terminology: "thog ma" (beginning, primordial) qualifies essence and nature; "rnam pa gsum" (three aspects) refers to the triad; "skur gnas" (abiding as body) identifies essence with kāya; "ma phye 'byed pa med" (without division or divisibility) asserts seamlessness; "babs las grub" (arisen from natural expression) describes spontaneous manifestation; "sku mdog" (body-color) refers to manifest form; "shes bya'i babs" (expression of knowables) indicates the ontological ground of cognition; "sna tshogs snang phyir gzhi" (called ground because of manifold appearance). The term "spros pa" (elaboration, prapañca) appears as "spros pa chen po" (great elaboration).

[10907-10924] [CONTEXT] Thal 'gyur Tantra as Nyingma Source
The Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Prasaṅga) is one of the Seventeen Tantras (rgyud bcu bdun) of the Nyingma tradition, specifically associated with the esoteric instruction class (man ngag sde). The name "Thal 'gyur" connects to the prasaṅgika (consequentialist) approach of Madhyamaka—using consequences rather than autonomous arguments. In Dzogchen, this refers to the "self-consequences" of ground—the spontaneous unfolding of appearances without causal production. The citation presents the "primordial" (thog ma) state prior to differentiation into the three bodies.

[10907-10924] [CONCEPT] Manifold Appearance as Ground's Definition
The culminating phrase "sna tshogs snang phyir gzhi zhes bya" (called ground because of manifold appearance) provides a definitional statement: ground is named "ground" precisely because it serves as the basis for the appearance of manifold phenomena. This reverses ordinary understanding: ground is not a substratum underlying appearance; rather, the capacity for manifold appearance constitutes ground. This is a functional definition—ground is what grounds appearance, not a thing that preexists appearance.

[10925-10944] [STRUCTURE] Dilemma Analysis and Resolution
The philosophical analysis presents a four-step argument: (1) from the perspective of primordial purity's exclusion, nothing is established, so external manifest colors/bodies are not established as categories (10925); (2) yet from the sphere of spontaneous present nature, there exists subtle appearance of five lights, bodies, rays, and bindus (10926-10927); (3) if one falls into the extreme of mere primordial purity, the aspect of body and wisdom arising is missing—if nothing exists in ground, how can it arise? If it exists, it contradicts "nothing exists" (10928-10935); (4) resolution: primordial purity's nature is spontaneous presence, containing subtle wisdom-appearance (10936-10937); (5) consequence: freedom from eternalism (by not asserting coarse externality) and freedom from nihilism (by asserting subtle interior clarity) (10938-10939); (6) synthesis: extreme-free self-arisen wisdom—empty in essence, clear in nature, unceasing in compassion (10940-10943).

[10925-10944] [PHILOLOGY] Philosophical Argumentation Terms
The analysis employs formal argumentation: "ldog pa nas gzhal na" (analyzed from the perspective of exclusion) uses ldog pa (exclusion, vyāvṛtti), a technical term from Dharmakīrti's epistemology. The phrase "ris can du ma grub" (not established as categories/classes) denies substantial classification. The interrogative "yod dam med" (does it exist or not) presents the horns of a dilemma. The verb "'byung bar mi 'thad" (cannot arise) employs 'thad (be logical, valid). The phrase "rtag pa'i mtha'" (extreme of eternalism) and "chad pa'i mtha'" (extreme of nihilism) reference the classic Indian philosophical extremes.

[10925-10944] [CONTEXT] Prasaṅgika Dilemma Structure
The argument employs the classic Madhyamaka dilemma structure: if X exists, then problem A; if X does not exist, then problem B; therefore, X is neither existent nor nonexistent. Here applied to the subtle appearance of wisdom in ground: if the five lights exist in ground, ground is not "nothing exists"; if they don't exist, they cannot arise. Longchenpa's resolution—asserting subtle inner clarity (nang gsal phra ba) while denying coarse external establishment—parallels the Prāsaṅgika distinction between conventional and ultimate truth, though Dzogchen adds the dimension of self-arisen wisdom.

[10925-10944] [CONCEPT] Subtle Existence as Middle Way
The resolution posits a "subtle existence" (phra ba)—the five lights, bodies, and wisdoms exist as inner clarity (nang gsal), not external manifestation (phyir gsal). This is the Dzogchen middle way: ground is not utterly nonexistent (like space) because it contains the potential for manifestation; yet not substantially existent (like matter) because it has no external form. The "subtle" (phra ba) indicates that existence here is not ordinary existence but a luminous, self-illuminating presence that transcends the existent/nonexistent dichotomy.

[10940-10944] [PHILOLOGY] Synthesis Formula
The culminating formula presents the triad: "ngo bo stong pas" (essence empty) + "rang bzhin gsal bar snang tshul ma 'gags" (nature's clarity-appearance unceasing) + "thugs rje go ma 'gags pas" (compassion's understanding unceasing). The phrase "mtha' bral rang byung gi ye shes" (extreme-free self-arisen wisdom) synthesizes the conclusion. The term "dngos po gshis kyi gnas lugs" (mode of abiding of entity-nature) identifies this as the ontological status of ground itself. The particle "ni" marks definitional equivalence.

[10940-10944] [CONTEXT] Extreme-Free (mtha' bral) as Dzogchen Signature
The term "mtha' bral" (free from extremes) is the signature Dzogchen position, transcending: (1) existence/nonexistence (yod/med); (2) eternalism/annihilationism (rtag/chad); (3) one/many (gcig/du ma); (4) coming/going ('ong/'gro). This parallels Nāgārjuna's catuṣkoṭi-negation but with a crucial difference: Dzogchen asserts the positive existence of self-arisen wisdom as the "middle" that is free from extremes. It is not merely the negation of extremes but the affirmation of a wisdom that naturally transcends them.

[10940-10944] [CONCEPT] Self-Arisen Wisdom as Ontological Ground
The concept of "rang byung gi ye shes" (self-arisen wisdom) resolves the dilemma by positing a wisdom that is neither existent (produced by causes) nor nonexistent (mere absence). It "arises" (byung) without cause (rang), thus transcending conditioned arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This is not the wisdom of a buddha (which would be a quality of a person) but wisdom as the ontological ground of all appearance—the "clearing" in which manifestation occurs. It is empty (no inherent nature), clear (luminous manifestation), and unceasing (continuous display)—the three aspects unified.

[10944] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Two-Part Specific Explanation
The line marks transition to the second major division: "gnyis pa so so'i cha las rgyas par bshad pa la gnyis te" (second, the extensive explanation from individual aspects, divided into two). This indicates the shift from the common/condensed presentation to the specific/detailed analysis. The "two" refers to: (1) extensive explanation from the perspective of essence's empty exclusion; (2) extensive explanation from the perspective of nature's manifest exclusion.
