[11854-11944] [STRUCTURE] Arising-Dissolution Appearance Modes
The text presents the third major division: establishing the validity ('thad pa) of arising-dissolution appearance modes. The structure bifurcates into: (1) this life (tshe 'di) appearances during practice, and (2) the intermediate state (bar do) appearances. The this-life section enumerates: (a) impure saṃsāra door appearances as direct dharmatā, (b) wisdom door appearances and experiences, (c) light-appearance as enhancement of experience, (d) kāya-appearance as recognition arriving at measure, (e) exhaustion of dharmatā as non-dual and liberation-appearance, (f) compassion-appearance as wisdom-love arising. The intermediate state section presents: (a) basis arising as primordially pure appearance, (b) basis-manifestation light radiance, (c) lhundrub's kāya-appearance, (d) wisdom and light-appearance, (e) the two doors of pure wisdom and impure saṃsāra, (f) recognition leading to dissolution back into the basis.

[11854-11944] [PHILOLOGY] Appearance-Terminology
The passage employs specialized appearance terminology: snang ba (appearance), nyams (experience), 'char (arising), nub (dissolution), thim (dissolving). The phrase snang ba bzhi yi tshul (mode of the four appearances) references the standard four-vision structure. The compound cig car ba dang rim gyis su (simultaneous and gradual) presents the two modalities of appearance. The term thod rgal ye shes (direct transcendence wisdom) indicates advanced practice realization. The particle thug pa (culminating in) indicates the terminus of appearance sequences.

[11854-11944] [CONTEXT] Thod rgal and Bardo Integration
The passage integrates thod rgal (direct transcendence) practice with bardo (intermediate state) teachings, establishing a continuum between advanced meditation and post-death experience. The eight modes of arising ('char tshul brgyad) referenced here correspond to the eight previously discussed qualities. The instruction that these appearances are illusory (sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad) references the eight examples of illusion standard in Mahayana literature. The mirror and dream analogies derive from standard Dzogchen pedagogical repertoire.

[11854-11944] [CONCEPT] Appearance as Self-Dissolving
The conceptual framework establishes that all appearances—whether in this life or the intermediate state—are self-dissolving displays of the basis. The key recognition is that appearances require no abandonment (spang mi dgos) or acceptance (blang mi dgos); they naturally dissolve (rang log) like dreams upon waking. The eight examples of illusion establish that appearances lack inherent existence while manifesting clearly. The great self-dissolution (rang log chen po) is not an act of will but the natural resolution (yal ba) of the play of awareness. Liberation (grol ba) occurs through recognizing appearances as the basis's own display, not through transforming them into something else. The passage concludes with the essential point (gnad): understanding this single point enables effortless liberation.
