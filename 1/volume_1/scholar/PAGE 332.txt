[13526-13565] [STRUCTURE] Fifty-Seven Days: Elements Dissolving
The text presents the fifty-seventh day of gestation and the dissolution of element powers. The structure establishes: (1) wind scattering gathered phenomena, (2) water gathering and earth pressing, (3) the generation of sense organs and aggregates through element action.

[13526-13565] [PHILOLOGY] Gestational Terminology
The term zhag lnga bcu (fifty days) marks a specific gestational phase. The compound 'byung ba'i nus pa (elemental power) identifies the energetic basis of development. The phrase dbang po (sense faculty) establishes the sensory apparatus.

[13526-13565] [CONTEXT] Death and Gestation Parallels
The text parallels gestation and death processes. The fifty-seventh day dissolution mirrors the death process where elements dissolve. This establishes the continuity between birth, life, and death as cycles of element manifestation.

[13526-13565] [CONCEPT] Body as Elemental Construction
The text conceptualizes the body as constructed from elemental interactions. Channels generate from elements; elements manifest through channels. This interdependence shows that the physical and energetic are inseparable, forming the basis for both saṃsāra and liberation.
