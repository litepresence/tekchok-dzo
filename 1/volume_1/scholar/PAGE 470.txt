[00001-00051] [STRUCTURE] Gateway Appearances and Temporal Determination

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage introduces four topics: (1) how awareness appears through gateways, (2) how to cut deviations, (3) gateway appearances, and (4) temporal determination. The organization: (1) awareness vs. appearance, (2) gateway emergence of appearances as light, body, and sphere, (3) temporal characteristics of wisdom manifestation. The passage integrates phenomenology with temporal analysis.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: rig pa (awareness), snang ba (appearance), sgo (gateway), thon nas (emerging from), 'od dang sku dang thig le (light, body, and sphere), dus tshad (temporal measure). The term "rtsal gzhi thog tu thim" (power-ground dissolved above) indicates the upward movement of subtle energies. "Phyal phyam yangs pa khrol chags su har re sang nge gnas" describes the quality of wide-open relaxed clarity. The "sky-like space of equality" (mkha' mnyam stong pa'i ngang) indicates the dharmadhātu.

- **[CONTEXT]** The *Nor bu 'phra bkod* citation establishes that awareness emerges through gateways, dissolves into sky-like emptiness, and that primordial wisdom appears universally while remaining complete in its own state. This reflects the rdzogs chen doctrine of "self-appearance" (rang snang): appearances are not external objects but manifestations of awareness. The distinction between awareness (rig pa) and appearance (snang ba) reflects the fundamental rdzogs chen dyad.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents a sophisticated phenomenology of visionary experience: awareness, when viewed or self-recognized at the time of gateway appearance, becomes without projection or gathering—wide-open and relaxed. Appearances emerge through gateways as light, body, and sphere, manifesting method and wisdom as non-dual and inseparable. The characteristics described (unimpeded, ceaseless, vast, self-luminous) indicate the "youthful vase body" (gzhon nu bum sku) or "rainbow body" ('ja' lus) attainments. The temporal analysis indicates that these appearances manifest during specific phases of practice, particularly during the dissolution of elements and the emergence of clear light.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants noted.
