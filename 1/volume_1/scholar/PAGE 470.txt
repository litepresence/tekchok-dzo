[LINE 20051-20059] [STRUCTURE] Cutting Deviations in View
**Analysis:** Page establishes that cutting deviations depends on decisive establishment (གཏན་ལ་ཕབ་) of self-clear rig pa with radiance viewed through sense-gates, free from discriminating intellect. Thal 'gyur citation: view-essence is not moved by intellectual words. This reflects the prasaṅgika-madhyamaka influence — liberation through freedom from extremes rather than conceptual refinement.

[LINE 20060-20078] [CONTEXT] Non-Deviating Meditation: Twelve Criteria
**Analysis:** From Nor bu 'phra bkod: meditation without deviation is defined negatively through twelve exclusions: (1) sense-gates clear, (2) not moved by mental thought, (3) not outwardly lost, (4) not attribute-defined clarity, (5) not emptiness with separation, (6) not continuous bliss, (7) not apathetic equanimity, (8) resting in mindful awareness-clarity, (9) without perverse refinement, (10) pleasant internal movement of grasping, (11) clear mode-grasping, (12) not fallen into extremes of color/letter transformation.

[LINE 20079-20091] [CONTEXT] Spontaneous Liberation in Conduct
**Analysis:** From Seng ge rtsal rdzogs: when conceptualization arises in that state, conduct liberates through whatever dualistic appearance arises — spontaneously arising, spontaneously liberated, without antidote/rejection entering between, without meditating benefits of introduction. Whatever appears is placed there-that liberates. The result: suddenly dawned without marks, universally vast, bubble-bubble dawned, not entering grasping into dharmas possessing two.

[LINE 20092-20111] [CONCEPT] The Nature of Dzogchen Result
**Analysis:** Extended verse citation: Dzogchen result is great self-perfected primordial attainment (རང་རྫོགས་ཡེ་ཐོབ་ཆེན་པོ་), not produced by meditation, effort, or fabrication. Five stanzas establish: (1) familiarity exists but not arisen by meditation — arrives at four thought-free states, (2) meaning difficult to realize — not found by words, arrives at instructions/secret essence, (3) awareness thought-free — not realized by meditation, arrives at great sent-place, (4) self-arisen wisdom — not accomplished by effort, arrives at two certain essences, (5) result single-pointed — not completed by production, arrives at three attachment-free instructions.

[LINE 20051-20111] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terms for Fruition
**Analysis:** གཏན་ལ་ཕབ་པ་ (decisively established) — crucial Dzogchen term for certain recognition; མ་ཡེངས་པ་ (non-distracted); མ་གོལ་གནས་པ་ (non-deviating abiding); ཐལ་བྱུང་དུ་གྲོལ་ (spontaneously liberated); སྤང་གཉེན་ (antidote and remedy); བསྐྱལ་ས་ཆེན་པོ་ (great place of sending/liberation); ངེས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་ (certain/definitive essence).

[LINE 20051-20111] [CONCEPT] The Paradox of Effortless Perfection
**Analysis:** This section articulates the central Dzogchen paradox: result is "primordially attained" (ཡེ་ཐོབ་) yet requires recognition; it is "not produced by meditation" (བསྒོམས་པས་བྱུང་བ་མ་ཡིན་) yet requires familiarity (གོམས་པ་); it is "not accomplished by effort" (བསྒྲུབས་པས་འགྲུབ་པར་མི་འགྱུར་) yet requires decisive cutting (ཐག་ཆོད་). The six "thoroughfares" (ཐུག་) — change-free, thought-free, instructions, secret essence, great sent-place, certain essence, attachment-free instructions — map the trajectory of recognition. The phrase གདོད་ཀྱིས་མི་བསྒྲུབ་པར་ (not to be newly accomplished from the beginning) encapsulates the teaching that enlightenment is discovery, not production.
