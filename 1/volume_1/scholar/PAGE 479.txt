[00001-00007] [CONTEXT] Colophon and Textual Closure

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This brief colophon marks the conclusion of the fourteenth chapter (rim khang bcu bzhi pa) on "The Presentation of Abiding Supported Knowledge" (brten pa shes pa'i gnas rnam par gzhag pa). The structure: (1) pedagogical exhortation to understand well and practice, (2) restriction against broadcasting to unsuitable recipients, (3) textual source citation, (4) chapter colophon.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: legs par khong du chud par byas (understood well), rgyud la nyams su blang (put into practice in one's being), phyogs bcur thams cad la bsgrag cing bshad pa'i gnas ma yin (not a place for broadcasting and explaining in all directions), theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod (Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle—the title of this text), brten pa shes pa'i gnas (abode of supported knowledge), rim khang bcu bzhi pa (fourteenth chapter). The phrase "legs par khong du chud" indicates deep internalization, not mere intellectual comprehension.

- **[CONTEXT]** The colophon reflects standard Buddhist tantric conventions: (1) exhortation to practice, (2) restriction on transmission (to prevent misunderstanding and maintain lineage integrity), (3) source identification. The "Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle" (*Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod*) is Longchenpa's major systematic work on rdzogs chen, integrating tantra, pramāṇa, and Great Perfection. This chapter (14) focuses on the "four lamps" (sgron ma bzhi) and related practices.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents the ethical-pedagogical framework of esoteric Buddhism: profound teachings require proper preparation and suitable recipients. Broadcasting "in the ten directions" (phyogs bcur) to unsuitable audiences violates tantric precepts and can lead to: (1) profanation of sacred teachings, (2) misunderstanding and wrong practice, (3) karmic obstruction for teacher and student. The colophon thus serves as both closure and warning, emphasizing that the preceding detailed phenomenological and metaphysical analysis is meant for committed practitioners with proper preparation and guidance, not for general dissemination.

- **[VARIANT]** No manuscript variants attested. The citation format [### CITATION] indicates editorial addition marking the textual source.
