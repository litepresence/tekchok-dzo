[11547-11606] [PHILOLOGY] Detailed Mark Analysis
The section catalogs standard Buddhist "marks": "mtshan bzang po sum cu rtsa gnyis" (thirty-two major marks, lakṣaṇa); "dpe byad bzang po brgyad cu" (eighty minor marks, anuvyañjana); "yangs pa'i chos drug" (six greatnesses of vastness). The fivefold structures enumerate: sku lnga (five bodies), ye shes lnga (five wisdoms), rigs lnga (five families), kha dog lnga (five colors), 'od lnga (five lights), yab lnga (five fathers), yum lnga (five mothers), gzugs lnga (five forms), sgra lnga (five sounds), dri lnga (five smells), ro lnga (five tastes), reg lnga (five touches), chos lnga (five dharmas), snang ba lnga (five appearances), gtso bo lnga (five chiefs), 'khor lnga (five retinues).

[11547-11606] [CONTEXT] Standard Buddhist Iconography in Dzogchen
The thirty-two major and eighty minor marks are standard descriptions of a Buddha's physical body in mainstream Buddhism. Their appearance here indicates Dzogchen's integration of conventional Buddhist iconography into its cosmogony. The sambhogakāya (enjoyment body) possesses these marks as its natural display. The fivefold structures correspond to the five Buddha-families (buddha-kula) of Vajrayāna: Akṣobhya (east, blue), Ratnasambhava (south, yellow), Amitābha (west, red), Amoghasiddhi (north, green), Vairocana (center, white). Each has consort (yum), retinue ('khor), and realm.

[11547-11606] [CONCEPT] Natural Emanation (rang bzhin sprul pa)
The "natural emanation body" (rang bzhin sprul pa'i sku) is conceptually significant: unlike "taming beings emanation" ('gro 'dul sprul pa) which responds to sentient beings' needs, natural emanation arises spontaneously from ground's nature without reference to beings. It represents the "aesthetic" dimension of enlightenment—Buddha's display for its own sake, not instrumental. The natural emanation body enjoys unceasing qualities, powers, and miracles not for benefit but as spontaneous expression. This parallels the Hindu concept of līlā (divine play)—manifestation without purpose.

[11547-11606] [PHILOLOGY] Purity of Sense Powers
The section lists six purified sense powers: "mig rnam par dag pa" (eye completely pure), "snyan rnam par dag pa" (ear completely pure), "shangs rnam par dag pa" (nose completely pure), "ljags rnam par dag pa" (tongue completely pure), "sku rnam par dag pa" (body completely pure), "thugs rnam par dag pa" (mind completely pure). The term "rnam par dag pa" (completely pure, pariśuddha) indicates transcendence of ordinary sensory limitations. The taming beings emanation body possesses these six purities, enabling it to perceive and respond to beings' needs perfectly.
