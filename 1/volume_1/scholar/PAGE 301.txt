[12455-12500] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom and Practice Relationship
The text presents the relationship between self-arisen wisdom and practice. The structure establishes: (1) wisdom not produced by practice but recognized through it, (2) practice as the removal of obstacles to wisdom, (3) the non-contradiction of spontaneous presence and effort, and (4) wisdom as the result that was never absent.

[12455-12476] [PHILOLOGY] Practice-Wisdom Terminology
The term sgrub pa (practice, sādhana) appears with relationship terms: ye shes dang 'brel ba (connection with wisdom). The phrase "sgrib pa sbyang ba" (purification of obscurations) describes practice's function. The compound rtsol sgrub (effortful accomplishment) contrasts with lhun grub (spontaneous presence). The term rnyed pa (discovery) describes the result.

[12477-12500] [CONTEXT] Effort-Spontaneity Resolution
The wisdom-practice relationship addresses the apparent contradiction between spontaneous presence and effortful practice. The text resolves this by distinguishing recognition (which is spontaneous) from preparation (which requires effort). This reflects the standard Dzogchen distinction between the path of preparation and the path of recognition.

[12455-12500] [CONCEPT] Practice as Obstacle Removal
The text conceptualizes practice not as producing wisdom but as removing what obscures it. Practice is like cleaning a mirror—revealing what was always there. The effort is real but directed at removal rather than creation. Wisdom is the "discovered" rather than "manufactured" result, present from the beginning.
