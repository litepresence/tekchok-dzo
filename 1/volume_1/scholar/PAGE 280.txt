[11664-11681] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Faults-Qualities Logic Section
The section marks transition to the second major subsection: "second, specifically explaining faults-qualities logic, three [topics]" (11664); (1) general showing of quality aspect eight; (2) division into fault-quality aspect by condition; (3) establishing logic of arising-cessation appearance manner. The structure: announcement of transition, enumeration of three subtopics, beginning of first subtopic.

[11664-11681] [PHILOLOGY] Transition and Enumeration
The phrase "gnyis pa" (second) marks the second main topic. "Skyon yon gyi 'thad pa" (faults-qualities logic) employs 'thad pa (logic, validity, pramāṇa). "Bye brag tu bshad pa" (specifically explained). The three subtopics: "yon tan gyi cha brgyad spyir bstan pa" (general showing of quality aspect eight); "rkyen gyis skyon yon gyi char dbye ba" (division into fault-quality aspect by condition); "'char nub snang tshul gyi 'thad pa dgod pa" (establishing logic of arising-cessation appearance manner). The first subtopic begins with "dang po ni" (the first is).

[11664-11681] [CONTEXT] Structure of Ground-Appearance Chapter
The chapter on ground-appearance (gzhi snang) is organized: (1) general showing of manner of arising; (2) specific explanation of faults-qualities logic; (3) showing manner of dissolving into primordial ground. The current section begins (2), which analyzes WHY ground-appearance manifests as either fault (confusion) or quality (wisdom). The eight quality aspects and the conditional division explain the mechanisms of manifestation. This reflects the scholastic method of causal analysis.

[11669-11681] [STRUCTURE] First Subtopic: Quality Aspect Eight
The section presents the argument: (1) if not spontaneously present in primordial ground, purpose of ground-appearance arising is nonexistent; (2) if ground-appearance spontaneous presence manner of arising is nonexistent, purpose of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa arising is nonexistent; (3) therefore, showing arising door of ground and ground-appearance as internal dimension subtle and external dimension coarse; (4) moreover, mind itself clear light dimension, if from spontaneous presence self-radiance compassion does not arise as what arises; (5) saṃsāra-nirvāṇa two would be severed, one cannot be taming object and taming agent for another; (6) sentient beings' self-appearance confusion; (7) Buddhas' self-face completely pure; (8) because appearance is not one; (9) though appearance is not one, benefit of sentient beings arises because compassion exists in ground, arising from ground-appearance.

[11669-11681] [PHILOLOGY] Logical Argumentation
The argument employs prasaṅga (consequence) structure: "ma grub na...don ma mchis/mi mchis/med pas" (if not established...purpose is nonexistent). "Skyon yon gyi char dbye ba" (division into fault-quality aspect) indicates the analytical method. The terms: "nang dbyings phra ba" (internal dimension subtle) vs. "phyi dbyings rags pa" (external dimension coarse). "Sems nyid 'od gsal gyi dbyings" (mind itself clear light dimension). "Rang gdangs" (self-radiance). "'Byung byed" (what arises/arising agent). "Sde chad" (severed, disconnected). "Gdul bya" (taming object, disciple). "'Dul byed" (taming agent, teacher). "Rang ngo rnam dag" (self-face completely pure).

[11669-11681] [CONTEXT] Internal-External Distinction in Dzogchen
The distinction between "internal dimension subtle" (nang dbyings phra ba) and "external dimension coarse" (phyi dbyings rags pa) reflects the standard Dzogchen cosmogonic structure: (1) internal—mind's clear light nature, subtle, primordial; (2) external—manifested world, coarse, derivative. The internal is the "ground" (gzhi) of the external. The distinction is not spatial (inside/outside body) but ontological—internal refers to the dimension of awareness, external to the dimension of manifestation. Both are ultimately non-dual.

[11669-11681] [CONCEPT] Spontaneous Presence as Necessary Condition
The argument establishes spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as the necessary condition for: (1) ground-appearance arising; (2) saṃsāra-nirvāṇa existing; (3) benefit of sentient beings being possible. Without spontaneous presence: (a) ground would be mere emptiness (unable to manifest); (b) no path or result could exist; (c) compassion could not function. This establishes that primordial purity (ka dag) ALONE is insufficient—ground must possess the dynamic capacity for manifestation (lhun grub). This is the Dzogchen synthesis of emptiness and appearance.
