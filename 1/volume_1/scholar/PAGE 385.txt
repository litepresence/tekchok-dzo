[16130-16137] [CONTEXT] Preliminary Practices for the Space Lamp
**Analysis:** Lines 16130-16134 explain the preliminary: first settling the basis of body, speech, and mind (lus ngag yid gsum gzhi 'chos pas)—hence called "space" (dbyings). Without compressing the body-essential, wisdom won't be controlled; without compressing the speech-essential, the inexpressible meaning won't be found; without compressing the mind-essential, movement won't be cut in one's own continuum—but compressing them, these are accomplished. Line 16135: because direct perception and self-liberated path are chief, it is called "rnam par" (variously/fully). Line 16136: seeing space through the gate-essential and stopping deluded appearance is called "pure" (dag pa). Line 16137: through the arising-gate essential, seeing the dharmata-space and settling decisively.

[16138-16146] [CONCEPT] Essential Points of Practice
**Analysis:** Lines 16138-16146 present the progressive essential points (gnad) of practice: (1) The object-essential of appearance—whatever appears has no sticking point in dharmata; (2) The wind-essential of striking gzer—different conceptualizations cease; (3) The luminosity-essential of arising—coarse and subtle elements reverse; (4) The essential of seeing direct perception dharmata-appearance—the continuum of view-meditation-conduct-result that meets dharmata's meaning through intellect and words is cut; (5) Seeing the experience-enhancing appearance—undeluded material cognition self-ceases; (6) Seeing the awareness-reached-limit appearance—enjoys the two form-kayas; (7) Seeing the dharmata-exhaustion appearance—liberated from the three kayas' self-continuum bonds. Thus making result the path, causally accomplishing effort and achievement transcends all vehicles.

[16147-16152] [CONCEPT] The Lamp as Cover and Essential
**Analysis:** Line 16147: The lamp is like covering a vessel's mouth (kha khyer sgron pa), a branch of practice-essential taught as four final-support pith instructions (mthar rten gyi man ngag bzhi). Line 16147-16148: with three unchanging as the basis, conceptual increase-decrease ceases, with nowhere to go from dharmata and self-appearance; with three abidings all measure-taken, body-speech-mind know not returning to the three realms; with three obtainings striking gzer, the four causes-conditions wind-minds' connection-cord is cut, thereafter the four cannot gather together; with four confidences liberation-measure is held, without hope or fear for samsara-nirvana, arrived at the certain object dharmata-space.

[16153-16161] [STRUCTURE] Relationship of Lamps to Ground, Path, and Result
**Analysis:** Lines 16153-16155: Because the four lamps exist, through the four ripening empowering blessings (dbang bzhi), one's continuum is purified; through the path four appearances reach measure; the result four kayas dissolve into space—these arise from that essential. Lines 16156-16160 present a metaphor: the precious treasure vase's intention, the jewel mind in the heart-vase, the self-arisen lamp-fire abiding like space; through the middle mouth's connection-cord space, the four lamps bridging; like the outer great space, bringing together mother and child at the liberation-place of original purity; when the measure is reached or dharmata of self-luminous bardo arises, the substantial body-vessel breaks, and spontaneous precious treasure pours into the secret hollow—these arise from practicing the four lamps' dharmata. Lines 16161ff: Summarizing the enumeration of the four lamps.
