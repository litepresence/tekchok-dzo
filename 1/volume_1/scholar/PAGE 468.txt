[00001-00047] [PHILOLOGY] The Fourfold Yoga: Continuous Practice Modalities

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage introduces four continuous yogas (rnal 'byor rgyun gyi/rgyun gyis): view-yoga, meditation-yoga, conduct-yoga, and the method of cutting deviations. The organizational structure: (1) fourfold yoga of continuous practice, (2) specific deviations for each yoga, (3) the essential point that there are no deviations in the vajra-intertwined itself. The passage emphasizes "continuous" (rgyun gyi/rgyun gyis) practice throughout the four times (dus bzhi).

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: rnal 'byor rgyun gyis (continuous yoga), gol sa (deviation/error), stong pa nyid la bltas (looking at emptiness), gzugs med skye mched mu bzhir gol (deviation into formless sense-bases like space), dngos po nyid (thing-ness/reification), lu gu rgyud (vajra-intertwined), bag la nyal ba (latent hatred). The term "smyon pa" (madman) indicates the "crazy wisdom" (smyon pa'i ye shes) modality of conduct. "'Jig tshogs lta" (view of perishing-aggregate) refers to the satkāyadṛṣṭi, the view of the transitory composite.

- **[CONTEXT]** The *Nor bu 'phra bkod* (Jewel Pinnacle Array) citation establishes the centrality of the vajra-intertwined body (lu gu rgyud kyi sku) as the object of continuous view-yoga. The three deviations for each yoga reflect standard Buddhist warnings against extremes: view can fall into emptiness-extreme, reification-extreme, or eternalism-extreme; conduct can become demonic (lha ma yin), egoistic ('jig tshogs lta), or ethically neutral (lung ma bstan); meditation can fall into dullness (lteng nas mun snang), attachment (chags pas 'khor ba), or nihilism (chad pa mu med).

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents a comprehensive typology of errors and correctives in rdzogs chen practice. The four continuous yogas require: (1) unwavering recognition of the vajra-intertwined for view, (2) continuous familiarity with the vajra-intertwined for conduct, (3) uninterrupted connection to the vajra-intertwined for meditation. The crucial insight: deviations are conceptual constructs (rtog pas btags pa); in the actual nature of the vajra-intertwined, no deviation exists. This reflects the rdzogs chen doctrine that error and correction are equally empty conceptual superimpositions.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants noted.
