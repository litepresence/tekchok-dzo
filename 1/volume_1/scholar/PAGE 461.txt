[19597] [PHILOLOGY] Essential Point Pressing and Experiential Integration
**Analysis:** *de dag kyang mngon sum dbang po'i yul la gnad gzir dus rnal 'byor pa gcig la ldog pas dbye na cha tshang du yod de*—"These also, when striking the essential point in the perceptual field of manifest sense-power, divided by reversals—one yogi has them complete."

- *Mngon sum dbang po'i yul* = direct sense-power object
- *Gnad gzir* = essential-point press/strike
- *Ldog pas dbye na* = divided by reversals/approaches
- *Cha tshang du yod* = complete-as existing

This indicates all fifteen awareness-typologies are accessible to direct perception and can be realized by a single practitioner through different approaches.

[LINE 19598-19617] [STRUCTURE] The Fifteen Aspects of Rig Pa (Rig Pa'i Rnam Pa Bco Lnga)
**Analysis:** Page opens with systematic enumeration of fifteen modes/aspects (རྣམ་པ་བཅོ་ལྔ་) of awareness (rig pa), each illustrated through similes: lion (unconquerable by conceptual fixation), elephant (unmoving from dharmatā), garuḍa (dwelling in dharmadhātu), rainbow (distinct yet unified radiance-awareness), fire (burning all afflictions), space (vast non-conceptuality), wind (spontaneous wisdom), vulture (confidence in self-appearance), ocean (vast natural settling), water-moon (ungraspable self-radiance), sky-space (vast beyond experience), crystal (without dullness/agitation), lotus (unstained by attachment), river (uninterrupted flow), and bubble (wisdom/experience welling forth). These constitute a complete phenomenology of rig pa's modalities.

[LINE 19618-19639] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Citations on the Four Lamps (Sgron Ma Bzhi)
**Analysis:** The text cites from Thal 'gyur (Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod's own commentary) on how the four lamps function: སྒྲོན་མ་བཞི་ (four lamps) manifest the four activities (las bzhi) through the vital points (gnad) of eye-wind dynamics. The passage details the three winds (འཇུག་པ་ entering, ཁྱབ་པ་ pervading, སྨིན་པ་ maturing) and their relation to sense gates (eye, ear), with specific attention to right/left distinctions (གཡས་/གཡོན་) in perception. The five-five pairs (ལྔ་ལྔའི་ཟུང་) generate kayā appearances.

[LINE 19634-19639] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological Analysis: yul la snang ba'i mtshan nyid
**Analysis:** Key terms: མཚན་ཉིད་ (characteristic, Skt. lakṣaṇa) defines the phenomenal marks of appearance; སྔོ་བསངས་ (blue-green/clear) describes the nature of space as basis; དབྱིབས་ (shape/form) with ཁ་དོག་ (color) and འོད་ (light) constitute the five jñānas' self-appearance (ཡེ་ཤེས་ལྔ་ཡི་རང་སྣང་). The དག་པ་དབྱིངས་ཀྱི་སྒྲོན་མ་ (lamp of pure dharmadhātu) as ground (གཞི་) from which thig le and kayas emerge.

[LINE 19598-19617] [CONCEPT] The Simile-Structure of Direct Perception
**Analysis:** The fifteen similes represent a graduated disclosure of rig pa's nature moving from power/conquest (lion) through dwelling (garuḍa), transformation (fire), spaciousness (space/wind/sky), confidence (vulture), stability (ocean/crystal/lotus), flow (river), to spontaneous emergence (bubble). This mirrors the progression from coarse to subtle in Dzogchen phenomenology, where each aspect reveals a different facet of nondual awareness without departing from the single sphere of rig pa stong gsal (empty-luminous awareness). The final line རྣམ་པ་བཅོ་ལྔ་འབྱུང་བའིོ་ marks this as a complete set.
