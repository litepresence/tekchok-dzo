[00001-00039] [STRUCTURE] Complete Correlation of External and Internal Time
**Analysis:** This section concludes the wind calculation definitiveness (rlung gi rtsis nges par zin pa) by correlating external time (phyi rol gyi lo dang zla ba) with internal time (nang gi nyin zhag gi dus). The four seasons (dbyar dgun ston dpyid) are divided into twelve months, and if one understands this 'khrul 'khor (wheel of confusion/error) without deviation (ma log), all appearances are established with certainty (snang ba thams cad gtan la phebs). This establishes the epistemological foundation—accurate wind calculation leads to definitive knowledge of phenomenal display.

[00039-00042] [PHILOLOGY] Root Text Citation Analysis
**Analysis:** The passage cites *Thal 'gyur* verses establishing basic temporal correlations: bcu phrag gsum (thirty) equals one zla ba (month); twelve [months] completed equals one lo (year); nang dang dgongs mo (day and night) totaling 720 completes zhag (days) as 360 for one year. The terminology bcu phrag indicates decimal grouping; zhag ni pho mo las kyis dbye indicates gender-based day classification. The twelve-year animal cycle (byi ba glang stag, etc.) completes the elemental calculations ('byung ba'i rtsis rnams spel ba).

[00042-00041] [CONTEXT] Conclusion of Wind Enumeration Section
**Analysis:** This passage initiates the third and final major division (gsum pa ye shes dang las rlung nges pas mjug bsdu ba) of the wind chapter—the concluding summary through determination of wisdom and karma winds. The tripartite structure (gsum ste) establishes: (1) 'thad pa spyir dgod—general establishment of tenability; (2) byed las so sor bshad—particular explanation of functions; (3) 'gyur tshad gtan la dbab pa—definitive establishment of transformation measures. This mirrors standard Tibetan scholastic hermeneutical structure.

[00041-00042] [STRUCTURE] Establishing Tenability: Two Subdivisions
**Analysis:** The first major subsection has two parts: 'thad pa dngos—actual tenability establishment, and de la rtsod pa spang ba—refutation of objections. The passage presents the fundamental premise: lus la rtsa gnas (channels abide in body), de la rlung gnas (winds abide in channels), rlung la ye shes dang las rlung gnyis su rgyu ba (wisdom and karma winds move in two ways). This establishes the ontological hierarchy: body → channels → winds → dual wind functions.

[00042-00044] [CONCEPT] Wisdom and Karma Wind Functions
**Analysis:** The text delineates the soteriological distinction: ye shes kyi rlung matures parinirvāṇa (mya ngan las 'das pa smin par byed); las rlung matures saṃsāra ('khor ba smin par byed). This dual function theory establishes the crucial premise—one wind substrate with divergent outcomes based on channel conditions, creating the framework for subsequent objection and response.
