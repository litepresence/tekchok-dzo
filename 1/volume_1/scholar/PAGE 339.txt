[13788-13823] [STRUCTURE] Four Wheels Classification
The text presents the classification of four wheels ('khor lo bzhi). The structure establishes: (1) four wheels supporting a single body, (2) dependent arising of elements like external saṃsāra, and (3) the four wheels as bases for innumerable phenomena.

[13788-13823] [PHILOLOGY] Wheel Terminology
The term 'khor lo bzhi (four wheels) identifies the chakra system. The compound rten 'brel bcu gnyis (twelve links of dependent arising) establishes the causal framework. The phrase 'byung bzhi'i 'phel 'grib (increase and decrease of four elements) describes elemental change.

[13788-13823] [CONTEXT] Microcosm-Macrocosm
The text presents the body as microcosm reflecting the macrocosm. Just as external elements depend on each other, internal elements form a similar web. This reflects the tantric principle of identity between individual and universal.

[13788-13823] [CONCEPT] Body as Dependent Arising
The text conceptualizes the body as dependent arising (pratītyasamutpāda). The four wheels arise from conditions and support further conditions. Understanding this dependent nature is understanding emptiness; understanding emptiness is liberation.
