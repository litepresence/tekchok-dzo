[9566-9584] [CONTEXT] Four Kayas as Nature of All

**Analysis:**
- **[CONTEXT]** The four kayas' nature is the four symbol-bodies (*rtags kyi sku bzhi*). Page concludes with peaceful body (*zhi ba'i sku*) teacher: self-knowing awareness king, unconditioned, abiding in citratna palace.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *de thams cad kyi rang bzhin rtags kyi sku bzhi* (four symbol-bodies as nature of all), *chos sku'i ston pa rang bzhin ma bcos pa* (Dharmakaya teacher unmodified nature), *stong pa kun khyab* (empty all-pervading), *'dul stangs rnam dag* (pure taming mode), *rang bzhin yongs dag* (completely pure nature), *nges med sna tshogs* (various without definite), *zag pa rang zad* (outflows self-exhausted), *chos kyi phung po 'dus pas* (Dharma-aggregates gathered), *las bdag tu med pa'i las byed pa* (doing actions without self), *gzugs sku'i ston pa sku snang la rang bzhin med pa zhal kun tu thal le ba* (Form body teacher face completely penetrating, natureless in appearance), *phyi dang nang med pa kun tu yang nang du gyur pa* (no outer or inner, all becoming inner), *chos dang chos ma yin pa rnam par 'byed pa* (distinguishing dharma and non-dharma), *snang ba dang mi snang ba* (appearing and non-appearing), *spros bzhi'i tshig tsam du byung ba* (arising as merely four elaborations' words), *zhi ba'i sku* (peaceful body), *rang shes rig gi rgyal po* (self-knowing awareness king), *ma bcos pa* (unconditioned), *citta ratna* (citra jewel), *gzhal med khang* (immeasurable palace).

- **[CONCEPT]** The four kayas represent progressively subtle dimensions of Buddha-nature: Nirmanakaya (active manifestation), Svabhavikakaya (essential purity), Dharmakaya (emptiness/pervasiveness), Form Body (appearance without nature). The "symbol-body" (*rtags kyi sku*) indicates these are seals or markers of realization. The peaceful body teacher—self-knowing awareness king—abides in the citratna (citra jewel) immeasurable palace, representing the ground of all kayas.
