[00001-00007] [STRUCTURE] Objection and Response: The Dual Wind Problem
**Analysis:** This section presents the rtsod pa dgod pa (presentation of objection): If wind movement from channels is merely one ('gyu ba tsam du gcig), how can it divide into las dang ye shes gnyis so so (individual karma and wisdom)? Alternatively, if two different movements exist, how can they be one? If one, two is untenable; if merely one movement, neither saṃsāra nor nirvāṇa is tenable from a single basis. This objection invokes the principle of ekadravya (single substance) and its incompatibility with dvaya (duality).

[00007-00037] [CONTEXT] Response: Channel Condition Determines Wind Quality
**Analysis:** The lan (response) establishes that although movement is one, rtsa ma 'chus pa'i 'gyus pa (uncontracted channel movement) produces ye shes kyi rlung with functions of bliss, emptiness, and clear emptiness; rtsa'i gnas 'gyur 'chus pa (contracted/transformed channel location) produces las kyi rlung with functions of conceptual diversity, unvirtuous connections, obscurity, dullness, agitation, lethargy, and contraction. This medical-physiological explanation—channel constriction determines wind quality—provides the mechanism for dual outcomes from unitary substrate.

[00037-00044] [PHILOLOGY] Simile and Applied Terminology
**Analysis:** The passage employs the simile (dpe) of ba tha ra'i bu (a single child) who becomes a tiger when angry, human when calm. The technical terms include: bde dbang (blissful sovereignty), stong pa (emptiness), gsal bar stong pa (clearly empty), rnam rtog tha dad pa (diverse conceptuality), mi dge ba'i sbyor ba (unvirtuous connections), mi gsal ba (non-clarity), bying ba (dullness), rgod pa (agitation), rmugs pa (lethargy), 'khyil ba (contraction). These describe the phenomenological qualities distinguishing wisdom from karma winds.

[00037-00044] [CONCEPT] Rig pa'i gdang and Rtsa 'chus Ma 'chus
**Analysis:** The key conceptual distinction emerges: rig pa'i gdang (awareness's resonance/vibration) and lus kyi rtsa nas 'gyu ba'i rlung (body's channel-moving wind) are one in movement alone. However, rtsa 'chus ma 'chus (whether channels are contracted or not) determines whether shes pa becomes las su rung ba (suitable for action/wisdom) or ma rung ba las nyon mongs su 'gyur ba (unsuitable, becoming affliction). This establishes the physiological basis for soteriological transformation—channel manipulation affects wind quality, affecting consciousness.

[00037-00044] [STRUCTURE] Four Wisdom Functions of Wisdom Wind
**Analysis:** The passage enumerates four ye shes (wisdoms) produced by wisdom wind's functions: (1) gzhi gnas kyi ye shes—ground-abiding wisdom from the abiding aspect; (2) mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i ye shes—characteristic-holding wisdom from the appearance aspect; (3) shes byas bsdus pa'i ye shes—wisdom gathering knowables from the production aspect; (4) shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes—wisdom gathering through consciousness from the movement aspect. These correspond to the four aspects (gnas pa, snang ba, skye ba, 'gyu ba) of wind function.
