[6547-6582] [STRUCTURE] Liberation Enumerations and Categories

[6547-6561] **Liberation in This Life:**
The text quantifies liberation in the current life (tshe 'dir 'byung ba rang dag gi grangs):
- All who have accumulated merit (*bsod nams rgya chen po*) over many aeons
- Those who encounter this teaching (gsang chen 'di dang phrad pa)
- Even those with only common vehicle contact (thun mong gi theg pa dang 'phrad pa tsam)

The mechanism depends on encountering the *'bras bu'i thus ka* (fruition essence), which has unobstructed power (*nus pa thogs med*) to liberate through faith alone.

[6562-6582] **Bardo Liberation Enumerations:**
Drawing from *Bskod pa chen po* (Great Arrangement Tantra), the text specifies bardo liberation numbers:
- 1,000 liberated between ages 60 and 50 (liberation into self-ground)
- 200,000 attain birthlessness (skye med) between ages 50 and 30
- 600,000 between ages 30 and 10
- Gender distribution shifts: predominantly male in later periods

The liberation occurs through the *ngo 'phrod* (introduction/recognition) gateway—those who see the introduction are established in the bardo ye-shes lamp (*bar do ye shes kyi sgron me*).

[6583-6628] [PHILOLOGY] Rigdzin Prophecies and Etymology

**Lineage Holders Predicted:**
Quoting from *Thal 'gyur*, the text predicts lineage holders after the teacher's parinirvāṇa:
1. **Uḍḍiyāna, west**: Dhana-kośa's goddess (*lha lc*am), motherless child *Vajra He* (btsa ma btsun mo Vajra He)
2. **West**: Brahmin youth *Mañjuśrī-pati* (seventy-five years old)
3. **So-sha-gling**: Householder *Śrī-siṃha*
4. **Subsequent**: *Jñāna-sūtra* (caṇḍala caste)
5. **Subsequent**: Householder caste holding Mahāmudrā
6. **Subsequent**: King caste with emanations and statues
7. **Subsequent**: Monk form *Lhun-gyi rgyal mtshan*
8. **Subsequent**: *Siddha-śvara*
9. **Subsequent**: Earth-dwelling Bodhisattvas
10. **Subsequent**: Vajrapāṇi emanation *Vajra-phala*
11. **Subsequent**: King *Siṃha*
12. **Subsequent**: *Bzang po*
13. **Subsequent**: *Sgra mkhar dpa'*
14. **Subsequent**: *Yogi sraba*
15. **Subsequent**: King *Khri 'od*
16. **Subsequent**: Monk *Dpal dang ldan*
17. **Subsequent**: *Blo gros mchog*
18. **Subsequent**: Ḍākinī *Dpal 'dzin ma*

**Vimalamitra Prophecy:**
The text identifies the author's teacher *Dge slong Dpal dang ldan* (Kumararaja) as an emanation of *Bi ma mi tra*, with specific signs: "born with the sign of Smemarks on the nose-tip, possessing special instruction-keypoints (*man ngag gi gnad*) surpassing others, displaying clairvoyance (*mngon par shes pa*) prophecying the future, clarifying difficult points (*dka' ba'i gnas*), and displaying extraordinary signs at death."

[6629-6684] [CONTEXT] Emanation Theory and Cyclic Teaching

**Emanation Cosmology:**
All manifestation flows from Kun-tu bzang-po's (*Samantabhadra*) compassion, with:
- Sixty-four thousand great emanations (*sprul pa chen po*)
- Nineteen thousand specific emanations for Jambudvīpa
- Activity immeasurable even by tenth-ground Bodhisattvas

**Cyclic Renewal:**
After the teaching completes seven cycles across seven Buddhafields (Beautiful-array, Vast-protection, etc.), cyclic existence is "hollowed out" (*'khor ba dong sprugs*)—becoming empty for twenty thousand great aeons (*bsegs kal stong phrag nyi shu*). Then:
- Beings reappear from the expanse (*dbyings*)
- Taming teachers manifest from Samantabhadra's blessing
- Teaching's three supports (*bstan pa'i rten gsum*) self-arise without decline

[6685-6755] [CONCEPT] Dharmatā and Original Ground

**Dharmatā Dissolution:**
When Vajradhara's arranged Brahma aeon completes:
- Container and contents (*snod bcud*) with their thousands dissolve
- Space becomes one (*nam mkha' gcig tu gyur*)
- Eighty-five aeons of emptiness
- Teaching's three supports dissolve into dharmatā's peaceful expanse (*chos nyid zhi ba'i dbyings*), becoming invisible

**Two Interpretations:**
1. **Universal Liberation**: Kun-tu bzang-po liberates all in his mandala
2. **Vajradhara's Mandala**: Only those in his specific arrangement are liberated

These are non-contradictory: Kun-tu bzang-po's compassion liberates all, yet from the expanse infinite latent tendencies (*bag la nyal*) can still arise.

**Soteriological Implication:**
The text emphasizes that the greatest scope of liberation (*grol ba rgya che shos*) should be understood as supreme—even if it takes immeasurable time, all will eventually be liberated through cyclic renewal.
