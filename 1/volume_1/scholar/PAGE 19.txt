[635-643] [CONTEXT] # The Southeast Field: Thal-ba's Sound
**Analysis:** The sGra thal 'gyur verses continue, describing fields in the intermediate directions. The southeast (*lho shar g.yon* = south-east-left) at six transcendent realms (*'jig rten khams drug 'das*) features "Thal-ba's sound" (*thal ba'i sgra*). The description follows classical *snyan ngag* conventions:

- **Protector-benefactor** (*skyob byed 'phan*) completely surrounded
- **Victory banners and parasols** (*rgyal mtshan gdugs*) raised
- **Flower-rain and fragrances** (*me tog sil ma'i char dang dri*)
- **Teacher, teaching, and beautiful assembly** surrounded
- **Bliss-play arising** (*bde ba'i rol pa 'byung*)

The compound *mdzes byed gzugs brnyan* (beautiful-makers/reflections) indicates the self-radiant nature of appearances in the pure lands.

[644-657] [CONTEXT] # The Southwest Field: Thal-ba's Wind
**Analysis:** The southwest (*lho nub g.yas* = south-west-right) below six realms features "Thal-ba's wind" (*thal ba'i rlung*):

- Movement and agitation in intermediate space (*bar snang*)
- Mutual movement and hovering (*phan tshun g.yo zhing lding ba*)
- Sounds arising from movement
- Teaching moved by wind (*ston pa'i bstan pa rlung gis g.yo*)
- "Five-possessing, three entering" (*lnga ldan 'jug pa gsum*) — likely referring to the five elements/aggregates and the three doors

At the summit thirteen stacked (*bcu gsum brtsigs pa*), "Jewel Thal-ba" (*rin chen thal ba*) appears, adorned with:
- Auspicious solar rays (*bkra shis nyi ma*)
- Desire's qualities (*'dod pa'i yon tan*)
- Miraculous letters (*'phrul gyi yi ge*)
- Lotus eyes of lda-ldi (*lda ldi padma'i spyan*)

[658-672] [CONTEXT] # West-North Field: Taming Thal-ba
**Analysis:** The west-north interval (*nub byang mtshams*) at six world-systems features "Taming Thal-ba" (*'dul ba'i thal ba*):

- Goddess included in complete offering (*mchod pa rdzogs pas lha mo dang bcas*)
- Light-filled with sandalwood fragrance (*'od kyis kheng dang tsan dan dri*)
- Teaching equal in every portion (*stan pa cha mnyam pa*)
- Beautiful form of sixteen years (*bcu drug lor ldan mdzes pa'i gzugs*)
- Surrounded by the extremely young (*rab tu gzhon pa rnams kyis bskor*)

Below at the ninth world (*dgu pa*), "Dung-ldan Thal-ba's deity" appears, intoxicated by the fragrance of faith and protection (*dad cing bsrungs ba'i dri yis myos*), with turbulent, blazing, glowing, agitated light.

[673-682] [CONTEXT] # Star Thal-ba and Cosmic Summary
**Analysis:** At the sixth world from this point, "Star Thal-ba" (*skar ma'i thal ba*) appears:
- Nature of stacked wheel (*khor lo brtsigs pa'i rang bzhin*)
- Stacked by five and nine (*lnga dang dgu yis brtsigs*)
- Adorned with dawn's water-spouts (*tho rngs kyi chu skyes kyis spras*)
- Thunder, lightning, red tongues emitting
- Teaching surrounded by scripture (*gsung rab kyis bskor*)
- Light-arising garland, nāga lineage (*'od 'phreng klu yi rigs*)
- Illuminating all directions and intervals

[683] [STRUCTURE] # The Cosmic Architecture Summary
**Analysis:** The final line summarizes the cosmology: within the twenty-five stacked lotus abiding (*nyi shu rtsa lnga brtsigs mar gnas pa*), in upper-lower and directions-intervals (*steng 'og dang phyogs mtshams thams cad*), countless fields pervade (*zhing khams dpag tu med pa khyab par yod*). This establishes the infinite interpenetration of Buddha-fields as the basic cosmological framework.
