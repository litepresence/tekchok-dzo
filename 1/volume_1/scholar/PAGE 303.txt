[12547-12592] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom in Daily Activities
The text presents wisdom as present in all daily activities. The structure establishes: (1) wisdom not limited to meditation, (2) walking, sitting, eating, and sleeping as expressions of wisdom, (3) the continuity of wisdom beyond formal practice, and (4) wisdom as the nature of all experience.

[12547-12568] [PHILOLOGY] Daily Activity Terminology
The phrase tha mal gyi spyod pa (ordinary conduct) describes daily activities. The compound 'gro 'dug (walking and sitting) represents all postures. The phrase "chos thams cad ye shes su gnas" (all phenomena abide as wisdom) extends wisdom to all experience. The term spyod lam (conduct, behavior) emphasizes integration.

[12569-12592] [CONTEXT] Post-Meditation Integration
The wisdom-in-daily-activities presentation addresses post-meditation integration—maintaining recognition during ordinary life. This reflects Dzogchen's ideal of continuous practice without separation between meditation and post-meditation. The integration distinguishes Dzogchen from approaches limiting wisdom to formal sessions.

[12547-12592] [CONCEPT] Wisdom as Continuous Presence
The text conceptualizes wisdom as continuous presence—not turned on during meditation and off afterward. Walking, sitting, eating, and sleeping are all wisdom's display when recognized as such. The integration dissolves the artificial boundary between "practice time" and "ordinary time," revealing all time as the display of wisdom.
