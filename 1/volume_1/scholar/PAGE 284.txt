[11819-11853] [STRUCTURE] Liberation Through Lhundrub's Modes
The text presents detailed analysis of liberation processes through the modes of lhundrub's manifestation. The structure presents: (1) liberation into pure wisdom from the quality perspective of lhundrub, (2) liberation from impure saṃsāra from the delusion perspective, (3) the two modes of saṃsāric entry—complete delusion and intermediate state uncertainty, (4) the two bases of delusion and liberation both accessing lhundrub's door, (5) six bases of liberation plus one additional door. The passage establishes the architectural framework for understanding how beings enter and exit saṃsāra through the same ontological ground.

[11819-11853] [PHILOLOGY] Causal and Temporal Particles
The passage employs complex conditional structures: 'khor 'jug tshul ltar na (if from the perspective of entry) versus 'khrul pa ldog tshul ltar na (if from the perspective of reversal). The particle ste establishes consequence and continuation. The compound ye dag rtsal rdzogs (purely perfected expression) describes the state of liberation. The phrase ma yengs gnas dag (undistracted pure abiding) characterizes the liberated state. The term grol gzhi (basis of liberation) contrasts with 'khrul gzhi (basis of delusion). The enumerative particle dang bdun no (and seven) indicates the seven doors of liberation.

[11819-11853] [CONTEXT] Bardo and Rebirth Framework
The discussion of two modes of saṃsāric entry (complete delusion and intermediate state uncertainty) draws on the bardo (bar do) literature of the Nyingma tradition, particularly the gong pa zang thal (direct penetration of mind) teachings. The reference to lhun grub ni po che (jewel of spontaneous presence) indicates the material symbolism of the intermediate state body. The six bases of liberation (grol lugs drug) plus one door correspond to the six realms plus the pure realm of liberation, reflecting standard cosmological structures.

[11819-11853] [CONCEPT] Same-Door Liberation-Delusion
The conceptual framework establishes that delusion ('khrul pa) and liberation (grol ba) occur through the same ontological door (sgo)—the door of lhundrub's spontaneous presence. The difference lies not in the door but in recognition (rtogs pa): recognizing the basis-manifestation as one's own display liberates; failing to recognize it deludes. This framework resolves the apparent paradox of how the same ground produces both bondage and freedom. The six bases of liberation represent capacities (dbang po) ranging from sharp to dull, determining whether liberation occurs in this life, the intermediate state, or subsequent lives. The key insight is that all capacities ultimately access the same liberative potential inherent in lhundrub.
