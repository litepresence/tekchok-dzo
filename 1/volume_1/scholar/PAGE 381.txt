[15922-15924] [STRUCTURE] Two Approaches to Thig Le Practice
**Analysis:** The text introduces a fundamental structural distinction in secret mantra (gsang sngags) practice concerning the "near path" (nye lam) of channels, nadi, and wind (rtsa thig rlung gsum). Two approaches are presented: (1) the method with effort and elaboration (rtsol bcas spros pa can gyi lugs), and (2) the method without effort, free from elaboration (rtsol med spros pa dang bral ba'i lugs). This binary framework structures much of Tibetan Buddhist soteriology, with the effortless approach representing the Dzogchen (rdzogs chen) perspective.

[15925-15942] [STRUCTURE] The Sequential Thig Le Practices
**Analysis:** Lines 15925-15940 enumerate a comprehensive list of practices for working with the relative thig le (kun rdzob kyi thig le): searching for the consort (rig ma btsal ba), attracting ('gugs pa), attending (bsten pa), searching for the channels (rtsa btsal ba), holding (gzung ba), union practice (sbyor ba bya ba), releasing the bindu into the central channel (dngos gzhi thig le dbab pa), holding again, reversing (bzlog pa), applying the capacity (rtsal gdab pa), mixing with wind (rlung dang bsre ba), dissolving into dharmata (chos nyid du la bzla ba), experiential examination (nyams brtag pa), and training in the experiences of body-mind reversal (lus sems go bzlog pa'i nyams bsten pa). These were already elaborated in detail during the third empowerment section (dbang gsum pa'i skabs). The essential point (gnad yang dag pa) is holding the bindu during the karmic wind phase, and reversing/applying capacity during the wisdom phase.

[15943-15951] [CONCEPT] Effortless Yogi's Luminous Bindu Practice
**Analysis:** The yogi without elaboration (spros pa med pa'i rnal 'byor pas) practices with the luminous bindu ('od gsal gyi thig le) as the direct path (mngon sum lam du byed pas). The meditation posture ('dug stangs) and gaze (gzigs stangs) being definite, the beginner (las dang po'i dus) meditates by inserting the lamp of empty bindu (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma) and abides in the intermingled luminosity of day and night ('od gsal gyi snang ba nyin mtshan 'dres pa). The relative bindu resides at the roma channel, and using this as the path represents the method of union (zung 'jug yab yum gyi thabs). On the left is the natural bindu in the subtle essence tonality (rang bzhin gyi thig le dngas ma phra mo'i gdangs), existing merely as the self-tonality of light ('od kyi rang gdangs). The meaning is transforming the bliss of sealed union (kha sbyar gyi bde ba) into emptiness.

[15952-15953] [CONCEPT] The Dharmakaya Bindu at the Center
**Analysis:** At the center (dbus na) dwells the dharmakaya bindu (chos sku'i thig le), free from elaboration (spros bral), luminous ('od gsal), pure (dag pa), self-arisen wisdom (rang byung ye shes) as the blazing lamp (sgron ma 'bar ba) as the basis. This will be explained extensively below.

[15954-15985] [PHILOLOGY] Citation from Mu tig 'phreng ba on Three-Part Bindu
**Analysis:** The text cites the *Pearl Garland* (Mu tig 'phreng ba), a significant Dzogchen tantra. The bindus arise from the channels with three aspects (cha ni gsum pa): right (g.yas), left (g.yon), and center (dbus ma). The right is the relative bindu, the support of great bliss (bde ba chen po'i yan gal can), the source of collected bliss (bde ba 'dus pa'i 'byung gnas), the great secret of all buddhas (sangs rgyas kun gyi gsang chen), the nature indicated by method (thabs kyis mtshon pa'i rang bzhin). The center is the ultimate dharmakaya nature, the single empty-luminous bindu (stong gsal thig le nyag gcig), dwelling at the center with self-nature clear (rang bzhin gsal), beyond expression and thought (spro bsdu smra bsam yul las 'das), gradually free from conceptualization (bags kyis rnam par rtog pa bral), clearing the two extremes of existence and non-existence (yod med mtha' gnyis rnam par bsal), without abiding in eternalism or nihilism (rtag chad mu la gnas pa med), spontaneously accomplished without conceptualization (rnam par rtog med lhun gyis grub), unexpressed and naturally empty (brjod pa med cing ngang gis stong), the ultimate substantial bindu. The left contains the natural bindu, pervaded by bliss-union (bde ba zung 'jug gnyis khyab), not firmly abiding, obtaining bliss through sealed union itself, the cause of mahamudra, the path of great bliss-wisdom, the mandala of all secret mantras, the great method that liberates from samsara, the blazing light of secret wisdom-tonality, the nature of great bliss.

[15986-15989] [STRUCTURE] Summary of Both Approaches
**Analysis:** Both approaches—the coarse purification with effort ('bad bcas rags pa sbyang ba) and the self-settled effortless approach ('bad med rang gzhag)—are taught in this vehicle. Especially for those with sharp minds, by compressing the key points of body and speech (lus ngag gi gnad gzir), the mind is liberated incidentally, demonstrating the superiority of this vehicle over all others.
