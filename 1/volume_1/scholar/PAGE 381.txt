[15667-15703] [STRUCTURE] Conduct Beyond Acceptance and Rejection
The text presents Dzogchen conduct (spyod pa) as beyond acceptance and rejection. The structure establishes: (1) conduct as natural expression of realization, (2) beyond moral dualism, and (3) the three kāyas as the field of conduct.

[15667-15703] [PHILOLOGY] Conduct Terminology
The term spyod pa (conduct/activity) identifies the behavioral dimension of practice. The compound blang dor (acceptance and rejection) establishes the dualistic framework to be transcended. The phrase rang bzhin (natural state) describes the basis of conduct.

[15667-15703] [CONTEXT] Dzogchen Conduct
The text presents Dzogchen conduct as distinct from conventional morality. It is the spontaneous expression of realization rather than rule-following. This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on naturalness over artificial discipline.

[15667-15703] [CONCEPT] Conduct as Natural Expression
The text conceptualizes conduct as the natural expression of realized awareness. Just as a lion's roar is not learned but natural, Dzogchen conduct arises spontaneously from recognition. It is not something to do but something that happens.
