[1000-1002] [PHILOLOGY] The Four Great Kings (*rgyal chen bzhi*)
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa names three of the Four Great Kings (Lokapālas) who guard the cardinal directions:

1. *spyan mi bzang* — Virūpākṣa (Ugly-eyes), guardian of the west
2. *rnam thos kyi bu* — Vaiśravaṇa (Hearing's Son / Kuvera), guardian of the north
3. *yul 'khor srung* — Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Land-guarding), guardian of the east

**Note:** Virūḍhaka (Growing), guardian of the south, is implied but not explicitly named in this section.

Each king dwells with his individual retinue (*so so'i 'khor*), establishing the hierarchical structure of the desire realm's lower heavens.

[1003-1007] [CONCEPT] Aesthetics of the Divine Realms
**Analysis:**

The description employs traditional Indian motifs of paradise:

**Ground:**
- *gser gyi sa gzhi* — Golden ground
- *tsan dan gyi chus chag chag btab* — Sprinkled with sandalwood water

**Flora:**
- *man dA ra ba* — Mandārava flowers (coral tree, *Erythrina indica*), covering to knee-depth (*pus nub tsam du khebs pa*)

**Hydrology:**
- *rdzing bu bzang po* — Beautiful lakes
- *chu khad chad du yod pa* — Water filled precisely to the level (*khad chad* = exact measure)

This reflects the *kalpavṛkṣa* (wish-fulfilling tree) mythology common to Indian cosmologies, where divine realms are characterized by natural abundance and sensory perfection.

[1008-1019] [CONTEXT] Celestial Mechanics: Sun, Moon, and Stars
**Analysis:**

**Solar Palace (*nyi ma'i gzhal med khang*):**
- Dimensions: 51 leagues (*dpag tshad lnga bcu rtsa gcig*) in height
- Material: Fire-crystal (*me shel*)
- Surrounded by gold and silver fences
- Adorned with four-jewel towers and gods' cities

**Lunar Palace (*zla ba*):**
- Dimensions: 50 leagues
- Material: Water-crystal (*chu shel*), "self-arisen" (*rang byung ba*)

**Star Hierarchies (*skar ma*):**
- Great (*che ba*): 18.25 leagues (*rgyang grags bco brgyad dang bzhi cha gcig*)
- Medium (*'bring*): 2-17 leagues
- Small (*chung ba*): 1 league

**Cosmological Function:**
These celestial bodies "naturally" (*rang bzhin gyis*) circle the four continents daily (*nyin zhag re re zhing*), demonstrating:
- Mechanical cosmology where celestial motion is inherent (*rang byung*)
- Spherical earth model with four continents
- Sun and moon as palaces (*gzhal med khang*) housing deities

**Material Composition:**
Formed from any of four elements (*'byung ba bzhi*):
- Gold (*gser*)
- Copper (*zangs*)
- Water-crystal (*chu shel*)
- Iron (*'khar ba*)

Floating at 40,000 leagues altitude, radiating light (*'od zer du 'phro ba*).

[1020-1032] [STRUCTURE] The Thirty-three Gods (*sum cu rtsa gsum pa*)
**Analysis:**

**Location:** Summit of Meru (*ri dbang lhun po'i steng na*)

**Five Components (*lnga las*):**
1. City (*grong*)
2. Grove (*tshal*)
3. Ground (*sa gzhi*)
4. Tree (*shing*)
5. Good assembly-place (*'dun sa bzang po*)

**Indra's Domain:**
- *dbang po'i pho brang 'khor* — Indra's surrounding palace
- *spyi'i grong blta na sdug* — Common city, beautiful to behold

**Completely-victorious Palace (*rnam par rgyal ba'i khang bzangs*):**
- Location: Center (*dbus na*) of three intermediate places (*mtshams gyi gnas gsum*)
- Dimensions: 150 leagues per side (*ngos re la... brgya lnga bcu pa*)
- Height: 5.5 leagues above Beautiful-to-see (*blta na sdug*)
- Structure: 8 stories (*ba gam brgyad*) with 7 stacked houses (*khang bu brtsegs ma bdun*), each containing 7 rooms (*gnas khang bdun*)

**Doxographical Note:** This corresponds to the Trayastriṃśa heaven in standard Buddhist cosmology, ruled by Śakra/Indra, representing the pinnacle of the desire realm's "horizontal" dimension before ascending to the "vertical" higher heavens.

[1033-1040] [PHILOLOGY] The Four Pleasure-groves (*skyed mos tshal bzhi*)
**Analysis:**

Located in the four directions (*phyogs bzhi na*):

1. *shing rta sna tshogs can* — Chariot Various-possessing

Each grove contains:
- *rin po che'i shing* — Jewel trees
- *bya* — Birds
- *rdzing bu du mas* — Many lakes

**Sensory Adornments:**
- *lha'i gos* — Gods' garments
- *rol mo* — Music
- *bdud rts'i* — Nectar
- *nor bu sna tshogs kyi dra ba* — Net of various jewels

**Philological Note:** The term *skyed mos tshal* (pleasure-grove) combines *skyed* (producing/growing) + *mos* (desire/pleasure) + *tshal* (grove/garden), indicating cultivated sensory enjoyment rather than wild nature.

**Structural Transition:** Having detailed the Thirty-three gods' realm—the highest desire-realm heaven on Meru—Longchenpa will next ascend to the higher desire heavens (Conflict-free, Joy-possess, etc.) and then to the form realm (*gzugs khams*), completing the cosmological survey before analyzing how beings arise within these realms.
