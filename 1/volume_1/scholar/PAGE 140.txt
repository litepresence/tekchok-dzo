[5529-5584] [CONCEPT] Light and Wisdom Systems
**Analysis:** Lines 5529-5584 analyze the two types of light (*'od*) and their significance:

**Two Types of Light [5529-5530]:**
1. Light of realized persons (*rtogs pa'i gang zag gi 'od*)
2. Light of unrealized sentient beings (*ma rtogs pas sems can gyi 'od*)

**Realized Perspective [5531-5532]:**
For those endowed with realization, this very appearance (*snang ba 'di*) dawns as flowing wisdom (*ye shes lhugar 'char*). For unrealized, though five lights exist, they are not seen — without symbol.

**Mantra Analysis Continued [5533-5584]:**

**Stacked Letters 5 [5535-5538]:**
Mantra: NI CI JI MO TAṂ ŚU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KĀYA SI TI SAṂ BHA RAḤ
Within these gathered sounds: DHARMA KĀYA SIDDHI BHA RA exist.

**Meaning [5541-5546]:**
- Pure body shown by actual sound
- Impure body shown by constructed sound
- Wisdom body: heart-center awareness, empty-awareness objective wisdom (*stong rig don gyi ye shes*)
- Dharmatā: permanent, unchanging, reversed from delusion
- Awareness wisdom: transcending world
- Awareness compassion: without ceasing-arising, benefiting beings

**Stacked Letters 6 [5551-5584]:**
Mantra: 'E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA / 'AD MA KO TSA GRA BA LO KI

**Light Analysis [5556-5563]:**
Three lights gathered in dharmadhatu:
- Awareness light (*rig pa'i 'od*)
- Kaya light (*sku'i 'od*)
- Wisdom light (*ye shes kyi 'od*)

These are non-dual wisdom nature, emptiness stacked with emptiness, Sambhogakaya equality meaning, body transcending words, pervaded by clear light, without partiality.

**Three Paths [5570-5573]:**
1. Emptiness wisdom path (*stong pa ye shes kyi lam*) — Bodhipath lamp (*byang chub lam gyi sgron ma*)
2. Clear light path (*gsal ba 'od kyi lam*) — Wisdom maya body (*ye shes kyi sgyu lus*)
3. Unchanging awareness empty path (*mi 'gyur ba rig pa'i stong lam*) — Precious body (*rin po che'i lus*)

These three are of one taste (*ro gcig pa*) in dharmadhatu, not transcending the supreme unchanging great equality expanse.
