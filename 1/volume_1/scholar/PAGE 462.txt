[00001-00043] [STRUCTURE] The Four Lamps: Technical Exegesis of Light Phenomenology

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage provides systematic exposition of the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi): their characteristics (mtshan nyid), objects (yul), supports (rten), and distinctive superior features (khyad par). The architectural organization follows: (1) general characteristics, (2) specific characteristics of each lamp (rgyang zhags, shes rab, thig le, dbyings), (3) objects (general and specific), (4) supports, and (5) distinctions between support and object. This five-fold structure reflects mature Tibetan scholastic presentation formats.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: mtshan nyid (characteristic/lakṣaṇa), yul (object/viṣaya), rten (support/support), 'khor 'das mtshams 'byed (distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa). The term "rgyang zhags" (distant-cast/cast-afar) derives from visionary experience of remote waters. "Thig le" (sphere/drop) indicates the bindu/corpuscle of light. "Dbyings" (expanse) translates dhātu/dhātu. The phrase "bya bral nam mkha' ji bzhin" (devoid-of-action like sky) employs standard rdzogs chen metaphors.

- **[CONTEXT]** The four-lamp system represents a distinctive Nyingtik (snying thig) contribution to rdzogs chen phenomenology. The *Thal 'gyur* (Thalgyur) tantra serves as the primary textual source. The integration of "view, meditation, conduct, and result" (lta sgom spyod 'bras) reflects standard Buddhist gradual path (lam rim) organization adapted to Great Perfection contexts. The emphasis on "direct perception" (mngon sum) through sense-faculties (dbang po) distinguishes this approach from inferential reasoning (rjes dpag).

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents a sophisticated phenomenology of light-experiences (snang ba) wherein the four lamps serve as gateways to recognition (ngo sprod) of the nature of mind. The distant-cast lamp (rgyang zhags) manifests as the unchanging ground; the primordial wisdom lamp (shes rab) cuts through saṃsāra; the sphere lamp (thig le) expands appearances; the expanse lamp (dbyings) liberates deluded appearances into emptiness. The passage emphasizes "familiarization" (goms pa) as the method for transforming meditative experience into liberated recognition. The distinction between support (rten) and object (yul) reflects standard Buddhist epistemological categories applied to meditative phenomenology.

- **[VARIANT]** No significant variants attested.
