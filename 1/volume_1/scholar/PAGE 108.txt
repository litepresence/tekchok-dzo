[3989-4004] [CONCEPT] Three Error Reversal Methods
**Analysis:** Lines 3989-4004 detail the three error reversal approaches:

**First: Root Cut [3989-3992]:**
- Essence: delusion root awareness itself self-liberated
- Primordially not experienced delusion seal obtained
- Beyond delusion-non-delusion
- Nature variously deluded, entirely imputed measure obtained
- Beyond object-object-possessor
- Characteristics: knowing delusion as delusion, non-deluded heat obtained

**Second: Self-Liberated Placing [3993-3999]:**
- Essence: first not experienced delusion, ignorance continuum pure
- Now not abiding in delusion, action-affliction basis empty
- Future delusion impossible, good-evil action certainty
- Nature without difference, samsara-nirvana ground one
- Delusion completely pure
- Characteristics: no delusion cause, three realms expelled

**Third: Basis Confidence [4000-4004]:**
- Essence: falling-doer basis empty, unfound fabricated ground confidence
- Nature beyond calculation, delusion-non-delusion not established
- Characteristics: two non-established, delusion-non-delusion companion free

[4005-4028] [PHILOLOGY] Thigle Self-Abiding Introduction
**Analysis:** Lines 4005-4028 would continue with:

**Thigle Self-Abiding (*thig le rang gnas*) [4005]:**
- Essence: single freedom from proliferation
- Without many parts
- Nature: various displaying, not different
- Pervading dharmatā beyond words
- Characteristics: introduced recognition, certainty-confidence

**Two Divisions [4006-4028]:**
- Aural lineage (*snyan rgyud*)
- Explanation lineage (*bshad rgyud*)

This completes the detailed presentation of the Instruction Section (*man ngag sde*) of Atiyoga, the pinnacle of the nine vehicles.
