[9273-9294] [STRUCTURE] Wind Purification Calculations: Sixty-Four by Sixteen

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage presents the wind (*rlung*) purification calculations through the four elements' wind sequences. Each of four empowerments has sixteen self-face divisions, each divided into four (outer, inner, secret, complete) producing sixty-four total. These are then correlated with four wind types and four qualities (swelling, piercing, equalizing, stirring).

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *'byung bzhi'i rlung gi rim pas* (by four elements' wind sequence), *dag byed dbang bzhi la rang ngo'i dbye ba bcu drug* (four purifier empowerments with sixteen self-face divisions), *phyi nang gsang ba yongs rdzogs bzhi bzhir phyed pas* (divided into four each: outer, inner, secret, complete), *spros bcas la bcu drug* (sixteen elaboration-with), *spros med la bcu drug* (sixteen elaboration-without), *shin tu spros med la bcu drug* (sixteen extremely unelaborated), *rab tu spros med la bcu drug* (sixteen utterly unelaborated), *rlung las rlung* (wind from wind), *chu rlung* (water wind), *me rlung* (fire wind), *rlung gi rlung* (wind wind), *byer ba* (swelling), *zug pa* (piercing), *snyoms pa* (equalizing), *'khrug pa* (stirring), *pho mo gnyis gnyis su phyed pas* (divided into male-female pairs).

- **[CONCEPT]** 
  **Four Winds:**
  1. Wind-from-wind
  2. Water-wind
  3. Fire-wind  
  4. Wind-wind
  
  **Four Qualities (each wind has):**
  1. Swelling (*byer ba*)
  2. Piercing (*zug pa*)
  3. Equalizing (*snyoms pa*)
  4. Stirring (*'khrug pa*)
  
  **Calculation:**
  - 4 winds × 4 qualities = 16
  - Each divided into male-female = 32
  - Half of thirty-six purifies actions = 36
  
  The sixteenfold structure (4×4) appears across all elaboration levels, producing 64 total subdivisions for purifying wind elements.

[9295-9310] [CONTEXT] Fruition of Completed Empowerments: Two Results

**Analysis:**
- **[CONTEXT]** Transition to the third general meaning: fruition of completed empowerments (*dbang bskur ba mthar phyin pa'i 'bras bu*), divided into (1) intermediate state result and (2) ultimate result. The intermediate result shows path qualities: elaboration-with completes accumulation path twelve qualities, elaboration-without completes preparation path four definite knowings, etc.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *gnas skabs dang mthar thug gi 'bras bu* (intermediate and ultimate fruition), *lam gyi yon tan spyir bstan pa* (path qualities generally shown), *rigs 'dzin bzhi'i thob tshul bye brag tu bstan pa* (specific showing of four Knowledge Holders' obtainment), *spros bcas kyis tshogs lam bcu gnyis rdzogs pa'i yon tan* (elaboration-with completes twelve accumulation path qualities), *spros med kyis sbyor lam nges 'byed cha bzhi rdzogs pa'i rten byed* (elaboration-without completes preparation path four definite knowings as support), *shin tu spros med kyis mthong lam rdzogs pa'i rten byed* (extremely unelaborated completes seeing path as support), *rab tu spros med kyis sgom lam dgu rdzogs pa'i rten byed* (utterly unelaborated completes nine meditation paths as support), *mos pa'i sa dang 'jug pa'i sa dang bsgyur ba'i sa dang chod pa'i sa bzhi* (four grounds: devotion, engagement, transformation, decisive cutting).

- **[CONCEPT]** 
  **Four Empowerments Correlated with Five Paths:**
  1. **Elaboration-with:** Completes accumulation path (12 qualities)
  2. **Elaboration-without:** Completes preparation path (4 definite knowings)
  3. **Extremely unelaborated:** Completes seeing path
  4. **Utterly unelaborated:** Completes meditation path (9)
  
  **Sixteen Grounds with Four Each:**
  - Devotion, engagement, transformation, decisive cutting (4)
  - Each correlated with four empowerments = 16
  - Completes sixteen grounds' qualities
  - Obtains common qualities' nature
  
  **Specific Classifications:**
  - Elaboration-within-elaboration-with: devotion ground (faith and merit distinction)
  - Its elaboration-without: engagement purification ground (faith certainty, self-power entry)
  - Its extremely unelaborated: thing purification transformation ground (not abiding in body-speech bonds)
  - Its utterly unelaborated: action-end decisive cutting ground
