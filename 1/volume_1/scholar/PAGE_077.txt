[2831-2866] [STRUCTURE] Vehicle of Characteristics Path
**Analysis:**

**Two-fold Division of Tenet Explanations:**

1. **Vehicle of Characteristics** (*mtshan nyid kyi theg pa*) — through methodological tradition
2. **Vehicle of Fruition** (*'bras bu'i theg pa*) — tantric approach

**Path for Sharp Faculties:**

Through the Vehicle of Characteristics, the path arises for:
- Sharp faculties (*dbang po rno ba*)
- Powerful mind-power (*sems kyi stobs ldan*)

**Basis:** Self-nature of the two truths (*gzhir gyur pa'i bden pa gnyis kyi rang bzhin*)

**Practice Framework:**

Knowing the two truths, the question becomes: *de ji ltar bsgom* — "how then to practice?"

**Fruit Presentation:**

Three divisions:
1. Path fruit
2. Complete perfection fruit
3. [Third aspect]

**From Entrance (*Jug pa*):**

```
The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
```

**Buddhahood Structure:**

- **Self-purpose** (*rang don*): Dharma-body (*chos sku*)
- **Others' benefit** (*gzhan don*): Two form-bodies (*gzugs sku gnyis*)
- **Wisdom** (*shes rab*): Beholding all with two wisdoms
- **Activity** (*phrin las*): Working for beings until samsara emptied

[2867-2902] [CONTEXT] Uttaratantra and Two Truths
**Analysis:**

**From Uttaratantra Commentary:**

```
All paths of truth are compounded.
All compounds are merely conventional.
That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—
The essence of emptiness, along with the subsequent measuring wisdom,
The peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.
```

**Two-fold Ultimate:**

1. **Nominal Ultimate** (*rnam grangs pa'i don dam*):
   - Through reasoning examining and dissecting
   - Nothing established as dharma-nature
   - Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling

2. **Verbal Ultimate** (*sgra ji bzhin pa'i don dam*)
3. **Non-nominal Ultimate** (*rnam grangs ma yin pa'i don dam*)
4. **Truly Authentic Ultimate** (*yang dag pa'i don dam*)

**From Two Truths:**

The relationship between analytical reasoning and direct realization established.
