[12227-12256] [STRUCTURE] Four Conditions of Delusion
The text presents the four conditions (rkyen bzhi) that produce delusion from non-recognition. The structure presents: (1) causal condition (rgyu'i rkyen)—the basis abiding like light in a house, (2) dominant condition (bdag po'i rkyen)—analysis and investigation, (3) observed condition (dmigs pa'i rkyen)—apprehension of object-possession, (4) immediately antecedent condition (de ma thag pa'i rkyen)—the simultaneity of the three. The passage employs the mirror-face analogy: basis as mirror, light as awareness, face as appearance. Delusion arises when the face appears in the mirror but is not recognized as one's own.

[12227-12256] [PHILOLOGY] Condition Terminology and Mirror Analogy
The passage employs specialized condition terminology from Abhidharma and pramāṇa traditions: rgyu'i rkyen (hetu-pratyaya), bdag po'i rkyen (adhipati-pratyaya), dmigs pa'i rkyen (ālambana-pratyaya), de ma thag pa'i rkyen (samanantara-pratyaya). The mirror analogy (me long) is developed extensively: 'od khyim (light-house) as basis, byad (face) as appearance, rang chas su 'byung (arising as self-possession) as delusion. The compound breng tsam (slight/small amount) qualifies the initial delusion. The phrase khams gsum 'khor ba (three realm saṃsāra) identifies the result.

[12227-12256] [CONTEXT] Pratyaya Theory and Dzogchen Adaptation
The four conditions derive from standard Indian Buddhist pratyaya (condition) theory, particularly as developed in Yogācāra and Sautrāntika epistemology. The Dzogchen adaptation transforms these causal conditions into the mechanics of non-recognition: the basis as causal condition, analytical mind as dominant condition, object-apprehension as observed condition, and their simultaneity as immediately antecedent condition. The Bkra shis mdzes ldan (Glorious Auspicious) citation provides textual authority.

[12227-12256] [CONCEPT] Delusion as Conditioned Arising
The conceptual framework establishes delusion as conditioned arising (rkyen 'byung) from non-recognition—not inherent in the basis but produced through specific conditions. The mirror analogy illustrates: the mirror (basis) and face (appearance) are not deluded; delusion arises when the perceiving subject (sems) fails to recognize the face as self-display. The four conditions show how this failure cascades into full delusion: from slight uncertainty (breng tsam) through individuation (dmigs pa) to complete misrecognition ('khrul pa). The framework preserves the basis's purity while accounting for the arising of delusion through the dynamics of perception and misrecognition.
