[9704-9742] [STRUCTURE] Enumeration of Seven Samaya Categories
The text presents a comprehensive taxonomy of samaya (dam tshig) organized into seven distinct categories: (1) view samaya (lta ba), (2) conduct samaya (spyod pa), (3) practice samaya (bsgrub pa), (4) general samaya (thun mong), (5) special body-speech-mind samaya (sku gsung thugs), (6) branch samaya (yan lag), and (7) key-point definitive samaya (gal mdo nges pa). This enumerative structure follows classical tantric pedagogical conventions.

[9704-9707] [PHILOLOGY] Root Tantra Citation
The opening citation from Dam tshig mchog gi rgyud employs the hermeneutical key "dam" as "bound" (bcings pa) and "indestructible vajra pledge" (rdo rje 'da' dka' gtan gyi gnyer), demonstrating etymological derivation typical of Nyingma tantric exposition. The term 'da' dka' (difficult to transcend) functions as a technical qualifier emphasizing the binding nature of these commitments.

[9708-9713] [CONTEXT] General Definition Framework
The general definition (spyi) of samaya as "one's own mind without deception, free from deceit and pretense" (rang sems tshig pa med pa la g.yo sgyu rnams dang bral ba) establishes the foundation for understanding tantric commitments not merely as external rules but as expressions of authentic mind-nature. This formulation bridges sutric ethics with tantric view.

[9714-9722] [CONCEPT] Root and Branch Typology
The twofold classification into root (rtsa ba) and branch (yan lag) samaya—with root encompassing the three vajras (sku gsung thugs) and branch comprising twenty-five subdivisions organized into five groups of five—represents a classical organizational schema found throughout Sarma and Nyingma tantric literature. This structure demonstrates the systematic integration of ethical precepts with the three-body doctrine.

[9723-9742] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative Terminology Analysis
The sevenfold classification employs technical terminology distinguishing view (lta ba), conduct (spyod pa), practice (bsgrub pa), general (thun mong), particular (khyad par), branches (yan lag), and definitive key-points (gal mdo nges pa). The phrase "mdor bstan legs par yid la zung" (properly retain the abbreviated presentation) signals pedagogical intent for memorization and contemplation.
