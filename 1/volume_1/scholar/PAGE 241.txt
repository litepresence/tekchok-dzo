[9704-9742] [STRUCTURE] Enumeration of Seven Samaya Categories
The text presents a comprehensive taxonomy of samaya (dam tshig) organized into seven distinct categories: (1) view samaya (lta ba), (2) conduct samaya (spyod pa), (3) practice samaya (bsgrub pa), (4) general samaya (thun mong), (5) special body-speech-mind samaya (sku gsung thugs), (6) branch samaya (yan lag), and (7) key-point definitive samaya (gal mdo nges pa). This enumerative structure follows classical tantric pedagogical conventions.

[9704-9707] [PHILOLOGY] Root Tantra Citation
The opening citation from Dam tshig mchog gi rgyud employs the hermeneutical key "dam" as "bound" (bcings pa) and "indestructible vajra pledge" (rdo rje 'da' dka' gtan gyi gnyer), demonstrating etymological derivation typical of Nyingma tantric exposition. The term 'da' dka' (difficult to transcend) functions as a technical qualifier emphasizing the binding nature of these commitments.

[9708-9713] [CONTEXT] General Definition Framework
The general definition (spyi) of samaya as "one's own mind without deception, free from deceit and pretense" (rang sems tshig pa med pa la g.yo sgyu rnams dang bral ba) establishes the foundation for understanding tantric commitments not merely as external rules but as expressions of authentic mind-nature. This formulation bridges sutric ethics with tantric view.

[9714-9722] [CONCEPT] Root and Branch Typology
The twofold classification into root (rtsa ba) and branch (yan lag) samaya—with root encompassing the three vajras (sku gsung thugs) and branch comprising twenty-five subdivisions organized into five groups of five—represents a classical organizational schema found throughout Sarma and Nyingma tantric literature. This structure demonstrates the systematic integration of ethical precepts with the three-body doctrine.

[9723-9742] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative Terminology Analysis
The sevenfold classification employs technical terminology distinguishing view (lta ba), conduct (spyod pa), practice (bsgrub pa), general (thun mong), particular (khyad par), branches (yan lag), and definitive key-points (gal mdo nges pa). The phrase "mdor bstan legs par yid la zung" (properly retain the abbreviated presentation) signals pedagogical intent for memorization and contemplation.

[9743-9765] [STRUCTURE] # The Basis of Samaya: Guru, Disciple, and Siblings
**Analysis:** Lines 9743-9765 establish the relational foundation (*rten*) of samaya through three categories: (1) guru (*slob dpon*), (2) disciple (*slob ma*), and (3) spiritual siblings (*mched lcam*). This triadic structure reflects the communal dimension of tantric practice.

**Line 9745:** *rten ni slob dpon dang slob ma mched lcam ste*—"The basis is teacher, student, and siblings"
- *rten* = basis, support, foundation
- Enumerative *ste* marks the threefold listing

[9746-9753] [CONTEXT] Guru-Disciple Protection Dynamic
**Analysis:** The citation from *de nyid* (the same text) establishes the protection dynamic:

**Lines 9747-9750:** *bsam gyis mi khyab dam tshig rnams / rnam pa gnyis su 'dus par gsungs / slob dpon dang ni slob ma gnyis / bsrung ba'i rgyu zhes kun tu grags*

"Inconceivable samayas are taught as gathered into two aspects: teacher and student are renowned as the cause of protection"

**Lines 9751-9753:** *bsrung ba'i rgyu ni slob dpon te / srung bar byed pa slob ma'o*

"The cause of protection is the teacher; the one who protects is the student"

**Key insight:** The guru embodies the samaya (*bsrung ba'i rgyu* = cause to be protected), while the disciple actively protects it (*srung bar byed pa* = protector/agent).

[9754-9764] [STRUCTURE] # Fourfold Classification of Spiritual Siblings
**Analysis:** Lines 9754-9764 present the four types of vajra siblings (*rdo rje'i spun*):

**Line 9756-9758:** *rdo rje'i spun la don bzhis bstan / spyi dang nye dang 'dres pa dang / dkyil 'khor bum pa 'dres pa'o*

"To vajra siblings taught through four meanings: general, close, mixed, and mandala-vase-mixed"

**The Four Types Detailed:**

1. **Line 9760:** *spyi'i mched*—General siblings
   - All who enter the teaching (*bstan par zhugs so cog*)
   - Especially all who enter secret mantra (*gsang sngags la zhugs pa thams cad*)

2. **Line 9761:** *nye ba'i mched*—Close siblings
   - Those of one dharma family (*chos rigs gcig pa*)
   - Share the same Buddha-family (*rigs*)

3. **Line 9762:** *'dres pa'i mched*—Mixed siblings
   - Gathered by one guru (*bla ma gcig gis bsdus pa*)
   - Same teacher, different empowerments

4. **Line 9763:** *shin tu 'dres pa'i mched*—Extremely mixed/intimate siblings
   - Same mandala, same butter lamp, same vase
   - Same empowerment time (*dbang dus gcig*)
   - Highest degree of samaya bond

[9764] [PHILOLOGY] Sevenfold Territory Marker
**Analysis:** *'di dag kyang yul bdun 'gyur gyis gnyan par shes par bya'o*—"These should be known as dangerous through sevenfold territory"

- *yul bdun* = seven territories/regions
- *'gyur gyis* = through becoming/transforming
- *gnyan pa* = dangerous, risky, heavy
- Indicates samaya violations occur across seven types of spatial/social boundaries

[9765] [STRUCTURE] # Transition to Guru Classifications
**Analysis:** *slob dpon la'ang thams cad kyis slob dpon du bkur ba'i spyi'i slob dpon dang*—"As for the teacher: the general teacher honored by all as teacher..."

This introduces the next section on four types of gurus, continuing the systematic classification of samaya relationships.
