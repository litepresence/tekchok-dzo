[1447-1455] [STRUCTURE] The Three-thousand-fold World System
**Analysis:**

**Formation Eon Duration:** 20 intermediate eons (*bar bskal nyi shu*)

**World System Architecture:**
- 1,000 worlds with four continents, Meru, and Brahma realms = First Thousand (*stong dang po spyi phud*)
- 1,000 such groups = Second Thousand (*stong gnyis pa bar ma*)
- 1,000 second thousands = Great Three-thousand (*stong gsum gyi stong chen po*)

**Scale:** One hundred billion (*bye ba phrag brgya*) Merus etc.

[1447-1455] [PHILOLOGY] The Partitive Particle *las*
**Analysis:** The phrase *skad cig dar re nyin re tsam las mi thub pa* (cannot [survive] even a moment, instant, or day) uses the ablative *las* to indicate the minimal extent. This establishes a comparative: even the shortest temporal unit is too long for certain beings. The construction *de ltar na* (thus/in this way) introduces the cosmological calculation that follows.

[1447-1455] [CONTEXT] # Kalpa Cosmology in Buddhist Sources
**Analysis:** The *kalpa* (Tib. *bskal pa*) cosmology derives from:
- **Abhidharma:** *Abhidharmakośa* Book III
- **Sūtra:** *Brahmajāla Sutta*, *Aggañña Sutta*
- **Tantra:** *Kālacakra* system with modified calculations
- **Dzogchen:** *Man ngag lta ba'i phreng ba*

The "formation eon" (*bskal pa chags pa*) is one of four eon-types: formation, abiding, destruction, and great eon (containing the previous three).

[1448-1450] [CONCEPT] The Formation Eon and Avīci Hell
**Analysis:** The text establishes that the formation eon begins when the first being falls into Avīci hell (*mnar med*). This creates a stark juxtaposition: the beginning of cosmic formation coincides with the extreme of suffering. The phrase *sems can gcig dmyal ba'i sdug bsngal myong ba la skyes pa'i bar la chags pa'i bskal pa* (the formation eon [extends] until a being is born experiencing the suffering of hell) establishes the duration as contingent on the first sentient being's fall.

[1451-1453] [PHILOLOGY] The Hierarchical Particle *la*
**Analysis:** The construction *de stong la stong gnyis pa* (on that thousand, the second thousand) uses the locative *la* to indicate hierarchical levels. This creates a multiplicative structure: each level is "on" or "built upon" the previous. The genitive *gyi* in *stong gsum gyi stong chen po* creates a possessive relationship: the great thousand OF three thousand.

[1451-1453] [STRUCTURE] # The Three-thousand Structure
**Analysis:** The three-thousand system (*stong gsum*) represents:
- **One thousand worlds:** The basic unit (galaxy/cluster)
- **Second thousand:** A group of such clusters (supercluster)
- **Third thousand:** A universe (all superclusters)

This corresponds roughly to modern astronomy's:
- Solar system → Galaxy → Galaxy cluster → Observable universe

The scale "one hundred billion Merus" indicates that each world-system contains its own central mountain, supporting the model of multiple world-systems rather than a single universe.

[1454] [PHILOLOGY] The Locative *na* in Spatial Specification
**Analysis:** The phrase *'di na ri rab la sogs pa bye ba phrag brgya brgya gnas so* (here on Meru etc. one hundred billion abide) uses the locative *na* to specify location. The number *bye ba phrag brgya brgya* (one hundred billion = 100 × 100 × 10,000,000) follows the Indian large number system.

[1455-1459] [STRUCTURE] The Twenty Intermediate Eons of Abiding
**Analysis:**

**Three Sub-periods:**
1. *'grib pa gcig* — One decline
2. *'phel 'grib bco brgyad* — Eighteen increase-decreases
3. *'phel ba gcig* — One increase

**Decline Period:**
- Lifespan decreases 1 year every 200 years
- From immeasurable to 80,000 years
- Then 100 years per year until 10 years

**Increase Period:**
- Abandoning killing → 20 years
- Abandoning theft → 40 years
- Abandoning sexual misconduct → 100 years
- Abandoning lying → 200 years
- Abandoning slander → 500 years
- Abandoning harsh speech → 1,000 years
- Abandoning idle chatter → 2,000 years
- Abandoning covetousness → 4,000 years
- Abandoning ill will → 10,000 years
- Abandoning wrong view → 20,000 years
- Abandoning attachment to sense pleasures → 40,000 years
- Abandoning wrong practice → 80,000 years

**Correspondence:** Form and enjoyments increase/decrease with lifespan.

[1455-1459] [CONTEXT] # The Twenty Eons in Buddhist Cosmology
**Analysis:** The twenty intermediate eons (*bar bskal nyi shu*) constitute one "great eon" (*bskal pa chen po*):
- 4 eons of formation
- 4 eons of abiding
- 4 eons of destruction
- 4 eons of emptiness
- Plus transitional periods

This structure appears in *Abhidharmakośa* III.83-89 and is standard across Buddhist schools.

[1456-1478] [PHILOLOGY] The Distributive Particle *re re*
**Analysis:** The phrase *lo nyis brgya na re re 'bri* (decreases one every 200 years) uses *re re* (each/every) to indicate distributive iteration. The verb *'bri* (to decrease/decline) with the directional *yo* (downward implied) establishes the trajectory of degeneration. The instrumental *pas* in *spangs pas* indicates that abandoning [each fault] is the CAUSE of the corresponding lifespan increase.

[1456-1478] [CONCEPT] The Moral-Cosmic Correlation
**Analysis:** The text presents a strict correlation between ethics and cosmology:
- **Killing** (most serious) → 20 years
- **Wrong practice** (least serious) → 80,000 years

This reflects the Buddhist understanding of karma as both individual and collective: the morality of beings directly affects the physical environment. The phrase *g.yor zhing rgyas pa* (flourishing and expanding) indicates that as lifespan increases, material prosperity follows.
