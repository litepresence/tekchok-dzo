[8724-8754] [STRUCTURE] Completion of Empowerment and Invisibility Methods

This section presents the completion of third empowerment (dbang gsum pa) difficulties and methods for rendering the consort invisible (mi mthong ba) through ritual substances (rdzas) and dependent connection (rten 'brel). The structure moves from empowerment completion to advanced practices, establishing the boundaries of proper conduct.

[8724-8746] [PHILOLOGY] Empowerment Completion and Invisibility Terms

The text employs protective vocabulary:
- "Rtogs dka' ba'i gnas" (difficult-to-realize points): Obscure teachings
- "Shin tu gsang ba" (extremely secret): Highest classification
- "Mi mthong ba" (not seeing): Invisibility
- "Rten 'brel" (dependent connection): Ritual causality
- "Ril bu" (pill): Substance preparation

The particle "ni" marks completion: "de dag gis dbang gsum pa'i rtogs dka' ba'i gnas bshad pa" (by these, the difficult-to-realize points of third empowerment are explained). The emphatic "ste" marks elaboration.

[8747-8772] [CONTEXT] Third Empowerment and Conduct Boundaries

The third empowerment (gsang dbang/ye shes shes rab dbang) represents:
- Highest yoga tantra: Secret and wisdom-knowledge empowerments
- Conduct (spyod pa): Integration of practice and daily life
- Boundaries: Improper times/places for bliss cultivation
- Consequences: Illness and obstacles from transgression

The section emphasizes:
- Yon phul (offering): Gratitude and compensation
- Rang gi yul (one's own place): Proper return
- Gsang ba chen po: Extremely secret meaning

[8773-8798] [CONCEPT] Ritual Technology and Invisibility

The invisibility method operates through:
1. Substances (rdzas):
   - Khyi nag po'i mig g.yas pa (black dog's right eye)
   - Ce spyang nag mo'i mig g.yon pa (black wolf's left eye)
   - 'U gu'i g.yas pa (owl's right [eye])
   - Ling ngu'i g.yon pa (lynx's left [eye])
   - Khva da'i gshog rtse g.yas pa (raven's right wing-tip)

2. Preparation:
   - Sbyar ba (combined): Proper mixture
   - Gser gyis gtums pa (wrapped in gold): Potent container
   - Ril bu (pill): Consolidated form

3. Application:
   - Rig ma'i khar bcug pa (placed in consort's mouth)
   - Lag tu 'da ma ru (damaru in hand): Sonic activation
   - Mthong bas lus mi mthong (when seen, body not seen)

[STRUCTURE] Unelaborated Empowerment and Mandala Entry

[8799-8824] [PHILOLOGY] Unelaborated and Elaborated Distinctions

The text employs classification vocabulary:
- "Spros med" (unelaborated/without elaboration): Beyond constructs
- "Spros bcas" (elaborated/with elaboration): Constructed methods
- "Dkyil 'khor" (mandala): Sacred enclosure
- "'Jug pa" (entry): Initiation
- "Smin pa" (ripening): Maturation

The particle "ni" marks distinction: "'di spros med gsang dbang ste / ngag gi gnas dag pa yi ge dang rtsa 'tsir ba'i bde bas ngo sprod pa'o" (this is unelaborated secret empowerment: speech place purification through syllable and channel-pressing bliss introduction). The emphatic "ste" marks definition.

[8825-8850] [CONTEXT] Four Empowerments Classification

The four-fold structure:
1. Spros bcas (elaborated): Vase empowerment with full ritual
2. Spros med (unelaborated): Secret empowerment with mantra
3. Shin tu spros med (thoroughly unelaborated): Wisdom-knowledge
4. Rab tu spros med (completely unelaborated): Word empowerment

This follows:
- Guhyasamaja: Progressive subtlety
- Hevajra: Four abhisheka
- Nyingma: Integration with Atiyoga

[8851-8876] [CONCEPT] Progressive Unelaboration

The progression represents:
1. Spros bcas: External, constructed, gradual
   - Full ritual implementation
   - Visual mandala
   - Sequential stages

2. Spros med: Internal, direct, immediate
   - Essence extraction
   - Mantra focus
   - Bliss recognition

3. Shin tu spros med: Secret, non-dual, spontaneous
   - Beyond subject-object
   - Wisdom realization
   - Natural presence

4. Rab tu spros med: Ultimate, beyond all, original
   - No reference point
   - Kadag (primordial purity)
   - Lhun grub (spontaneous presence)

[STRUCTURE] Three-fold Classification: Outer, Inner, Secret, Perfect

[8877-8902] [PHILOLOGY] Four-fold Partition Terminology

The text employs spatial distinction vocabulary:
- "Phyi" (outer): External level
- "Nang" (inner): Internal level
- "Gsang" (secret): Hidden level
- "Yongs su rdzogs pa" (perfect/completely perfect): Ultimate level

The particle "ni" marks partition: "'di la phyi nang gsang ba yongs rdzogs bzhi las" (in this, from the four: outer, inner, secret, and perfect). The enumerative "las" indicates source.

[8903-8928] [CONTEXT] Four Levels in Each Empowerment

Each of the four empowerments contains four levels:
- Spros bcas: Phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs (outer, inner, secret, perfect)
- Spros med: Phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs
- Shin tu spros med: Phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs
- Rab tu spros med: Phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs

Total: 16 subdivisions (4 x 4)

This follows the tantric principle of recursive classification.

[8929-8954] [CONCEPT] Recursive Structure of Empowerment

The recursive levels operate through:
1. Phyi (outer):
   - Ritual implements visible
   - Physical actions apparent
   - Sequential progression clear

2. Nang (inner):
   - Subtle body engagement
   - Energetic processes
   - Meditative stabilization

3. Gsang (secret):
   - Beyond ordinary perception
   - Wisdom recognition
   - Non-dual experience

4. Yongs rdzogs (perfect):
   - Complete integration
   - All levels unified
   - Ultimate fruition

**Summary:**

Page 212 completes the third empowerment difficulties, presents invisibility methods through ritual substances, introduces unelaborated empowerments, and establishes the three-fold (four-fold) classification system. Philologically, the text employs protective vocabulary, unelaboration terminology, spatial distinctions, and recursive classification markers. Contextual sources include Guhyasamaja, Hevajra, and Nyingma empowerment systems. Conceptually, the section demonstrates proper conduct boundaries, ritual technology for advanced practices, progressive unelaboration from constructed to spontaneous, and recursive four-fold structure operating at each level of empowerment.
