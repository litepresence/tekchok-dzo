[8546-8629] [STRUCTURE] Great Seal Liberation and Bindu Refinement

[8546-8586] **Three Vajras Integration:**
Through three syllables (*sku gsung thugs kyi yi ge gsum*) creating three vajras:
- *Oṃ* creates vajra: body three kāyas unified (*sku gsum gcig tu 'dril*)
- *Āḥ* generates bodhicitta: speech vajra—unspeakable, invisible, inconceivable speech unified
- *Hūṃ* creates vase: mind vajra—Dharmakāya's non-conceptual, non-thinking; Saṃbhogakāya's non-distracted; Nirmāṇakāya's manifold knowledge unified

This unifies inexhaustible body, speech, mind ornament maṇḍala wheel.

[8587-8629] **Bindu Refinement Process:**
Holding vajra tip with three vajra body, speech, mind syllables:
- Produces three bliss results sequentially and instantaneously

Mother's E creates lotus—great bliss body seal
*Hrīḥ* creates lotus bell—great bliss speech seal
*Ha* creates lotus anther—great bliss mind seal

This liberates body, speech, mind bonds—"self-liberated great seal" (*rang grol phyag rgya chen po*).

**Phat and Hrīḥ Sealing:**
- Phat sealing lotus opening: great bliss wind released into spontaneous presence
- Hrīḥ sealing vajra opening: enjoying great bliss essence

From *Snga ma*:
"Body, speech, mind great vajra
Three seals joined in lotus center
For refining bodhicitta, Hrīḥ seals skillfully
Not releasing wisdom, Phat seals opening"

**Three-fold Refinement:**
Three vajra mind refinements from vajra tip to waist:
- Body channels expand
- From there to root: mind expands into great bliss
- From there to navel: body-mind non-dual bliss expands

**Four Seals:**
1. **Action seal** (*las kyi phyag rgya*): Outer body refinement, effortless four activities
2. **Commitment seal** (*dam tshig gi phyag rgya*): Waist refinement, stainless four wisdoms' commitment inseparable
3. **Dharma seal** (*chos kyi phyag rgya*): Tip refinement, enjoying general/specific characteristics
4. **Great seal** (*phyag rgya chen po*): Holding bindu itself—bliss-emptiness non-dual non-abiding

[8630-8704] [PHILOLOGY] Refinement Signs and Benefits

**Refinement Benefits:**
- Channel expansion: diseases don't arise
- Wind expansion: samādhi arises
- Can walk without feet touching ground
- See body's atoms as vajra
- Fly in space
- Life equal to sun and moon
- Free from food/clothing attachment

Conventional bodhicitta benefits.

**Ultimate Bodhicitta Benefits:**
- Special transference (*'pho ba khyad par can*) practice
- Consciousness entering other's city

From *Dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*:
"Refining bodhicitta bindu
Supreme and common qualities
Whatever desired in mind
This certainly accomplishes."

**Holding Measure:**
Bindu falling into bhaga but wind-power returning to mother's bindu—not escaping measure.

**Bliss Generation Sequence:**
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Sensation** (*tshor ba*): enjoying resultant after experience
3. **Bliss** (*bde ba*): mind and wisdom disturbed time
4. **Experience** (*myong ba*): mind and wisdom inseparable
5. **Emptiness** (*stong pa*): neither mind nor wisdom distinguished, transcending extremes and distinctions

From *Snga ma*:
"First joy alone
Second sensation, contact, experience
Third called bliss
Fourth experience co-emergent
Fifth called emptiness"

[8705-8755] [CONTEXT] View Stabilization and Physical Postures

**View Integration:**
Not time for actual consort method, root-generation—ordinary desire without mental fabrication. View-oscillation time: self-body dependent bliss generated without mental control.

Through actual body refinement, holding bodhicitta, refined/unrefined time—extraordinary bliss arises, experience not mixed with mental fabrication. Only knowing mind as mere emptiness. When ordinary conceptions absent in mind—obtained view time.

Refined bodhicitta arriving at holding measure—channels spread, body-mind non-dual great seal beyond mind experienced. View stabilization time: however done, power over bodhicitta, no change/transformation.

**Postures for Channel Mouth Sealing:**
1. Lion's leap (*seng ge'i mchongs stabs*)
2. Leg/arm joints contracted—cuts cyclic existence root
3. Chest space thrown—wind-mind union key point
4. Eyes forcefully drawn—wisdom gate opening key point
5. Intestines curved—body bliss definite liberation key point
6. Long Hūṃ recitation—wind-mind dharmatā union key point
7. Occasional E sound—dharmatā purity result key point

**Bindu Three Locations:**
- Root held: Dharmakāya bliss experienced
- Waist held: Saṃbhogakāya bliss experienced
- Tip held: Nirmāṇakāya bliss experienced

[8756-8821] [CONCEPT] Empowerment Classifications Summary

**Four Empowerments' Definite Divisions:**
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): enters faithful mind through elaborated
2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): shows inner entry method
3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): mind-change entering path for concept purification
4. **Utterly without elaboration** (*rab tu spras med*): produces special realization, obtains non-dual meaning

**Sixteen-fold Self-nature Divisions:**
Each empowerment divided into:
- Self (*rang*)
- Other (*gzhan*)
- Outer (*phyi*)
- Inner (*nang*)
- Secret (*gsang*)
- Perfect (*yongs rdzogs*)

Results in 16 variations for each of four empowerments = 64 total, showing extensive classification system.

**Purification Purpose:**
With elaboration's 16 purify outer four elements' four each = 16
Body, speech, mind, consciousness purified through four empowerments matched to three kāyas = 12
Completing 16-fold purification of karmic and afflictive obscurations.
