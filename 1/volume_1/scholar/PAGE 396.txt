[16503-16527] [STRUCTURE] # Definition Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa provides etymological analysis (*nges tshig*) of the three components:

**Thig (Bindu):**
- Self-abiding round light (*rang gnas 'od zlum*)
- Unchanging (*mi 'gyur*)

**Le:**
- Pervades objects widely (*yul la khyab par gdal*)

**Stong pa (Empty):**
- Cannot identify things (*dngos po ngos gzung du med*)
- Five self-lights blaze — thus "lamp"

[16508-16527] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The verse provides the tantric basis for the etymology:
- Bindu is unchanging, straight
- Free of primordial fabrication
- Le is great wide expansion
- All appearances complete in their own place
- Emptiness is thing-holding
- Minds attached to objects cease
- Great emptiness nature
- Self-attachment mind does not appear clearly
- Lamp makes five lights appear
- With clear recognition of self-face
- These are the definitive words

[16521-16527] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*):
The peacock simile illustrates the bindu-emptiness relationship:
- Like the peacock's essence
- Bindu has no change
- Le pervades and appears to objects
- Emptiness has no thing-marks
- Lamp becomes appearing darkness

[16528-16537] [STRUCTURE] # Fivefold Classification
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes five types of bindus (*dbye ba rnam pa lnga*):

1. **Gnas pa gzhi'i thig le** — Abiding ground bindu
   - Heart (*snying ga*), wisdom hero-bullet (*ye shes kyi dpa' be'u*)
   - Dividing line (*gyes mdo*) of samsara-nirvana
   - Source (*'byung gnas*)
   - Abides at exhaustion (*zad sar gnas*)

2. **Lus gnas rtsa'i thig le** — Body-abiding channel bindu
   - Like special great channel
   - Self-luminous
   - Abides as bliss-pain self-liberated, primordially liberated

3. **Kun rdzob rgyu'i thig le** — Conventional cause bindu
   - In roma (*ro ma*), etc.
   - Merely holds body constituents (*zungs*)
   - As holding agent

4. **Don dam spros pa med pa'i thig le** — Ultimate elaboration-free bindu
   - Awareness primordially pure from ka
   - Abides in space-awareness exhaustion intention

5. **Rang byung 'bras bu'i thig le** — Self-arisen fruit bindu
   - Appears manifest to sense powers
   - Day and night mix into light-clarity
   - Engages in great complete liberation of buddha intention

[16530-16534] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *Dpa' be'u* (hero-bullet): tantric anatomical term for energetic center
- *Gyes mdo* (dividing line): boundary marker
- *Zad sa* (exhaustion place): point of complete emptying
- *Roma* (roma): left energetic channel
- *Zungs* (constituents): bodily essences
- *'Dzin byed* (holding agent): functional capacity

[16535-16537] [PHILOLOGY] The term *don dam* (ultimate) with *spros pa med pa* (without elaboration) indicates the *niṣprapañca* nature of the fourth bindu type.
