[12994-13021] [STRUCTURE] Continuing Metaphor Decoding: Burning, Killing, and Cutting
This section continues decoding *Sengge Tsal* metaphors: (1) burning phenomena in fire and pouring into water (12994-12998): recognition wisdom's fire burns grasping-fixation phenomena without ground until exhausted, bathing in samādhi water, realizing awareness's meaning; (2) killing sentient beings (12995-12997): all recollections/thoughts thrown into great evenness, delusory thoughts self-cease, delusory appearances empty - or directly looking at manifest experience, feelings/sensations cease, stone-earth appearances reverse; (3) cutting one's own life-force (12998-13002): releasing wind to self-cease, thoughts naturally empty, realizing direct seeing of own-face, dharmadhātu-appearance dawning directly, outer light-appearance meeting dharmadhātu's natural dissolution, inner conceptual thought awakening tracelessly, meeting object of primordial purity exhaustion; (4) gathering nine categories and attaining strength (13003-13004): body key points gathering wind-awareness key points, mind-itself self-abiding, bliss-clarity-nonthought experience developing; (5) trapping gods and nearness of siddhi (13005-13006): capturing empty forms in dharmadhātu citadel, quickly obtaining signs/measures.

[12994-13021] [CONTEXT] Phyam bzhag, Cutting Through, and Signs/Measures
The passage integrates: (1) Phyam bzhag (great evenness/equipoise) - Dzogchen's "self-settled" approach, not deliberate meditation but natural resting; (2) Cutting through (khregs chod) practices: cutting conceptual mind, cutting life-force of delusion; (3) Wind release (rlung btang) - trekchö practice of allowing wind-mind to self-cease without control; (4) Signs and measures (rtags tshad) - thodgal visionary milestones indicating progress; (5) Empty forms (stong gzugs) - thodgal visual phenomena appearing in space; (6) Nine categories (skye dgu bsdus) - all sentient beings gathered through energetic mastery; (7) Dharmadhātu citadel (dbyings kyi go rar) - recognition of awareness's natural state as impenetrable fortress; (8) Stone-earth reversal (sa rdo'i snang ba log pa) - world dissolving into true nature through recognition.

[12994-13021] [CONCEPT] Cessation as Recognition and Self-Ceasing Wind
The philosophical framework: (1) Burning in wisdom-fire: not annihilation but recognition that grasping-fixation has no ground (gzhi med), self-liberating through recognition; (2) Killing sentient beings: all cognitive activity (dran bsam) released into natural evenness (phyam bzhag), delusion self-ceases without suppression; (3) Cutting life-force: releasing wind (rlung btang) to self-cease (rang 'gags) - not controlled breathing but natural dissipation of conceptual energy; (4) Direct result: dharmadhātu-appearance dawns directly, meeting outer dissolution and inner tracelessness simultaneously; (5) Nine categories gathered: through body key points, wind-awareness gathered, mind self-abides in bliss-clarity-nonthought; (6) Trapping gods: empty forms captured in dharmadhātu - not deliberate visualization but recognition of spontaneous display; (7) Siddhi near: signs/measures obtained quickly through recognition rather than gradual accumulation; (8) All metaphors converge on single point: recognition of awareness's natural state liberates without transformation.
