[13007-13052] [STRUCTURE] Leapover in Detail
The text presents detailed instructions on leapover practice. The structure establishes: (1) the specific techniques for inducing visionary experience, (2) the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) as supports, (3) progression through the four visions, and (4) integration of visionary experience with recognition.

[13007-13028] [PHILOLOGY] Leapover Practice Terminology
The phrase thod rgal gyi gnad (key points of leapover) introduces detailed instructions. The term sgron ma (lamp) applies to four supports: sgron ma lus (body lamp), sgron ma rtsa (channel lamp), sgron ma thig le (essence lamp), and sgron ma shes rab (wisdom lamp). The compound snang ba bzhi (four visions) structure the progression.

[13029-13052] [CONTEXT] Visionary Contemplative Technology
The leapover instructions present a sophisticated contemplative technology for inducing and working with visionary experiences. The four lamps provide the physiological and energetic framework; the four visions provide the experiential map. This reflects the Nyingma integration of subtle body theory with direct perception practices.

[13007-13052] [CONCEPT] Leapover as Luminous Development
The text conceptualizes leapover as the development of luminous capacity—allowing awareness to manifest its natural radiance. Unlike fabricated visualization practices, thod rgal works with naturally arising light. The four visions describe the progressive unfolding of this luminosity, from initial perception to complete integration with dharmatā.
