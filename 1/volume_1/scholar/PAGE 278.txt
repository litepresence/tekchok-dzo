[11607-11646] [STRUCTURE] Impure World-System Arising
The section describes the arising of impure samsara: (1) from outer container five elements' maṇḍala arising, earth, water, fire, wind, great element space exists; (2) from that, grasping mind inexpressible in words, and six afflictions—desire, anger, delusion, pride, jealousy, aversion (11613-11619); (3) from that, six-class beings arise; (4) from jealousy—humans; from aversion—gods; from pride—demigods; from desire—hungry ghosts; from delusion—animals; from black anger—hell beings (11621-11626); (5) thus six-class appearance arises; (6) that is samsara's place; (7) though from one great mode of abiding, arises like four appearance-modes; (8) from four modes of abiding, arise like four appearance-means; (9) four great appearances—spontaneous presence manifesting as manifold; sambhogakāya possessing face-eyes-ears, abiding as magical body of light nature; emanation body appearing like form; to sentient beings appearing separately (11632-11635); (10) to sentient beings appearing as obscuration by appearance-means; (11) summary—beneath cloudless sky appearance of primordial purity, from eight doors of spontaneous presence manner of arising, wisdom appearance sambhogakāya; (12) from its capacity in directions, from immeasurable five-family appearance, natural emanation body appears; (13) below showing six-class fields with Teacher, three-body appearance stacked is ground spontaneous presence appearance; (14) sambhogakāya appearing to self-face, taming beings natural emanation Buddhas, are capacity of self ground-appearance, not existing now in any direction, because self-knowing appearance, abides together with self-knowing; (15) self-appearance six-class appearance also not existing elsewhere, self-arisen from unceasing manner of arising like impure samsara door.

[11607-11646] [PHILOLOGY] Affliction-Realm Correspondences
The section maps six afflictions to six realms: 'dod chags (desire) → mi dwags (hungry ghosts); zhe sdang (anger) → dmyal ba (hell); gti mug (delusion) → byol song (animals); nga rgyal (pride) → lha ma yin (demigods); phrag dog (jealousy) → mi (humans); khong khro (aversion) → lha (gods). This is a distinctive Nyingma mapping—other traditions use different correspondences. The term "gnag pa" (black) intensifies anger's result—hell. The phrase "thun mong mthun pa'i 'jig rten" (common concordant world) indicates the shared conventional reality.

[11607-11646] [CONTEXT] Six Realms (ṣaḍgatī) Cosmology
The six realms are standard Buddhist cosmology: gods (deva), demigods (asura), humans (manuṣya), animals (tiryak), hungry ghosts (preta), hell beings (naraka). Longchenpa provides a psychological interpretation: each realm arises from a specific affliction. This reflects the Yogācāra principle that realms are mental projections. The mapping is: gods ← aversion (attachment to pleasure); demigods ← pride (competition with gods); humans ← jealousy (comparing oneself to others); hungry ghosts ← desire (insatiable craving); animals ← delusion (ignorance); hell ← anger (destructive hatred).

[11607-11646] [CONCEPT] Appearance as Self-Obscuration
The phrase "sems can la snang thabs kyis sgrib pa" (to sentient beings, obscuration by appearance-means) is conceptually significant: what appears (manifestation) is not itself obscuration, but the "means" (thabs) of appearing—when not recognized—becomes obscuration. The appearance (snang ba) and the obscuration (sgrib pa) are not different things but different modes of the same manifestation. When ground-appearance is recognized, it is wisdom; when not recognized, it is obscuration. The "self" in self-obscuration indicates this is not externally imposed but intrinsic to unrecognized manifestation.

[11647-11663] [STRUCTURE] Common vs. Individual Appearance Distinction
The section presents a crucial distinction: (1) though this appearance appears to each self; (2) common concordant world-aspect is arranged by common karma and Teacher's activity; (3) aspect appearing as confusion though appearing to self is arranged as self-appearance samsara door; (4) self-appearance aspect goes to self-reversal when casket shifts; (5) common [aspect] still remains projected to others; (6) distinguishing these two is extremely important; (7) naturally, from awareness's self-born spontaneous presence door, six-class appearance exists, key point is need to let confused appearance like dream self-reverse to appearance-nonexistence in primordial purity ground; (8) in intermediate state also, explained as two aspects regarding accomplishing benefit or not through self-appearance emanation in self-face six-class; (9) before impure samsara door arises, if self-appearance self-face known, benefit not accomplished because object of action does not appear; (10) must accomplish benefit after arising because cannot be liberated without emptying confused appearance; (11) this key point is subtle but very important.

[11647-11663] [PHILOLOGY] Common-Individual Distinction Terms
The distinction: "thun mong mthun pa'i 'jig rten gyi cha" (common concordant world-aspect) vs. "rang la snang rung 'khrul par snang ba'i cha" (aspect appearing as confusion though appearing to self). "Spyi mthun gyi las" (common karma—collective action). "Ston pa'i mdzad pas bkod" (arranged by Teacher's activity—cosmic Buddha's creative act). "Rang snang 'khor ba'i sgos bkod" (individually arranged as self-appearance samsara). "Spubs 'pho dus" (when casket shifts—death/transformation moment). "Rang log" (self-reversal—returns to self). "Gzhan ngor da dung shol" (still projected to others). The phrase "'khrul snang ma stongs na grol bar mi nus" (cannot liberate without emptying confused appearance) emphasizes active recognition.

[11647-11663] [CONTEXT] Two Truths as Ontological Levels
The distinction between common and individual appearance reflects the two truths (bden pa gnyis) at an ontological level: (1) conventional truth (kun rdzob bden pa)—the shared world, dependent on collective karma; (2) ultimate truth (don dam bden pa)—individual experience, dependent on personal recognition. The "Teacher's activity" (ston pa'i mdzad pa) creates the common world; individual confusion creates personal experience. The key insight: even the "common" world is ultimately self-appearance—there is no truly external reality, only unrecognized self-display.

[11647-11663] [CONCEPT] The Bardo's Two Possibilities
The intermediate state (bar do) explanation presents two possibilities: (1) if self-appearance is recognized before impure samsara door arises, benefit is not accomplished because there's no object to benefit (this is liberation); (2) if recognition occurs after arising, benefit must be accomplished (this is compassionate activity). The subtle point: complete liberation requires "emptying" (stongs) confused appearance—not destroying it but recognizing its empty nature. The bardo is the critical moment when self-appearance can either reverse (liberation) or continue (rebirth).
