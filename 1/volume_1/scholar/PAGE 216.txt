[8854-8883] [STRUCTURE] Unelaborated Empowerment: Transformations and Stabilizations

This section presents the unelaborated empowerment (spros med dbang) through its four changes ('gyur ba bzhi): entry ('jug pa), attainment (thob pa), abiding (gnas pa), and near realization (nye bar rtogs pa). The structure establishes how unelaborated practices transform consciousness through progressive stabilization.

[8854-8872] [PHILOLOGY] Transformation and Stabilization Terminology

The text employs process vocabulary:
- "Spros med" (unelaborated): Without constructs
- "'Gyur ba" (change): Transformation
- "Rtsi ba" (reckoning): Assessment, calculation
- "Yid 'gyur" (mind transformation): Mental change
- "Nang du 'jug" (inner entry): Deepening engagement

The particle "ni" marks effect: "sprul med kyi sprul bcas kyis skal ldan gyi yid 'gyur" (unelaborated's elaborated transforms the fortunate one's mind). The instrumental "gyis" indicates means.

[8873-8898] [CONTEXT] Four Changes in Unelaborated Context

The four changes:
1. 'Jug pa (entry):
   - Spros bcas kyis yid 'gyur (elaborated transforms mind)
   - Initial engagement with method
   - Outer dimension

2. Thob pa (attainment):
   - Spros med kyis nang du 'jug (unelaborated enters within)
   - Inner dimension opened
   - Tool demonstrates method

3. Gnas pa (abiding):
   - Shin tu spros med kyis yid 'gyur (thoroughly unelaborated transforms mind)
   - Preparation for purification
   - Deepening stability

4. Nye bar rtogs pa (near realization):
   - Rab tu spros med kyis gnyis med don thob (completely unelaborated attains non-dual meaning)
   - Proximate to full understanding
   - Near realization

[8899-8924] [CONCEPT] Progressive Interiorization

The changes represent interiorization:
1. Outer → Inner:
   - Phyi: Elaborated methods
   - Nang: Unelaborated essence
   - Progressive deepening

2. Method → Wisdom:
   - Thabs: Spros bcas (elaborated)
   - Shes rab: Spros med (unelaborated)
   - Integration

3. Constructed → Natural:
   - Bcos pa: Made, fabricated
   - Ma bcos pa: Unfabricated, natural
   - Spontaneous presence

[STRUCTURE] Thoroughly Unelaborated: Liberation from Karmic Maturation

[8925-8950] [PHILOLOGY] Liberation and Activity Terminology

The text employs freedom vocabulary:
- "Shin tu spros med" (thoroughly unelaborated): Beyond all constructs
- "Las mtha' 'grol" (liberation from karmic maturation): Freedom from results
- "'Phrin las" (enlightened activity): Buddha actions
- "Bzhi la sbyor" (engage four): Apply to four activities
- "Tshigs" (bond/fetter): Restriction, limitation

The particle "ni" marks function: "shin tu spros med kyi dbang bzhi las mtha' 'grol bar byed pa ni" (thoroughly unelaborated empowerment liberates from karmic maturation). The emphatic "ni" establishes purpose.

[8951-8976] [CONTEXT] Four Activities and Karmic Liberation

The four activities ('phrin las bzhi):
1. Zhi ba (pacifying): Calming disturbances
2. Rgyas pa (expanding): Increasing qualities
3. Dbang (powerful): Subjugating obstacles
4. Drag po (wrathful): Forceful transformation

Karmic maturation (las mtha'):
- Las (karma): Actions performed
- Mtha' (limit/maturation): Results to be experienced
- 'Grol (liberation): Freedom from consequences

[8977-9002] [CONCEPT] Activity Without Karmic Consequence

The thoroughly unelaborated empowerment:
1. Liberates from las mtha':
   - Actions don't create karma
   - Results not binding
   - Freedom in activity

2. Engages 'phrin las bzhi:
   - Zhi rgyas dbang drag (pacifying, expanding, powerful, wrathful)
   - Spontaneously
   - Without conceptualization

3. Through ru shan 'byed kyi spyod pa (distinguishing conduct):
   - Samsara-nirvana distinction
   - Clear recognition
   - Natural liberation

[STRUCTURE] Thoroughly Unelaborated: Four-fold Structure

[9003-9028] [PHILOLOGY] Four-fold Enumeration and Entry Terminology

The text employs multi-level vocabulary:
- "Shin tu spros med" (thoroughly unelaborated): Deep unelaboration
- "Spros bcas" (elaborated): Constructed level
- "Spros med" (unelaborated): Basic unelaboration
- "Stong nyid dkyil 'khor" (emptiness mandala): Ultimate sphere

The particle "ni" marks entry: "de'i spros med stong nyid kyi dkyil 'khor du 'jug pas" (its unelaborated enters emptiness mandala). The instrumental "pas" indicates means.

[9029-9054] [CONTEXT] Four Levels in Thoroughly Unelaborated

Each of the four changes contains four aspects:
1. Spros bcas level:
   - Las, tshigs, yi ge, rtog pa dag
   - Purification of action, bond, syllable, concept

2. Spros med level:
   - Don rang thog tu phebs pas
   - Meaning arrives at itself
   - Chos nyid las 'gro sa med pa
   - No going from dharmata

3. Shin tu spros med level:
   - Sgo gsum khams gsum du mi 'jug pa
   - Three gates don't enter three realms

4. Rab tu spros med level:
   - Tshogs drug dag par byed pa
   - Purifies six collections

[9055-9080] [CONCEPT] Complete Purification Framework

1. Purification levels:
   - Las (action): Karma purified
   - Tshigs (bond): Restriction purified
   - Yi ge (syllable): Conceptual formulation purified
   - Rtog pa (concept): Thought purified

2. Entry levels:
   - Stong nyid dkyil 'khor (emptiness mandala)

   - Tshogs drug (six collections)

3. Result:
   - Complete freedom
   - No residue
   - Natural liberation

**Summary:**

Page 216 presents the unelaborated empowerment's four changes, thoroughly unelaborated liberation from karmic maturation, and four-fold structure. Philologically, the text employs process vocabulary for transformation, freedom terminology for liberation, and multi-level enumeration. Contextual sources include four activities tradition, karmic theory, and emptiness mandala concepts. Conceptually, the section demonstrates progressive interiorization from outer method to inner wisdom, activity without karmic binding through spontaneous engagement, and complete purification framework operating at four levels—all representing empowerment as thorough liberation from all constructs and their consequences.
