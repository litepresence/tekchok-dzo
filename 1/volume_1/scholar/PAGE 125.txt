[4701-4710] [PHILOLOGY] Completion of Tantra Chapter
**Analysis:** Lines 4701-4710 would complete the proof section and mark the chapter transition:

**Line 4701-4702:** Without scripture reasoning clear tantras, like flowers without fragrance

**Line 4703-4704:** Without four instruction tantras, like uncooked food

**Line 4705-4706:** Without three intent self-abiding, like blind eye not seeing

**Line 4707-4708:** Without two entry self-liberation, like no ferry to cross

**Line 4709-4710:** Without scholar ritual, like no guard for treasure

**Chapter Conclusion:** This completes the extensive presentation of the Word Tantra section (*tshig gi rgyud*) and the fifth chapter (*rim khang lnga pa*) on Tantra nature.

**Next Chapter:** Would transition to the sixth chapter on abiding places (*gnas ngas pa*) or similar topic.

**Note:** Page 125 marks the end of the detailed tantra presentation section. The text has systematically covered:
- The twelve (then nineteen) Great Perfection tantras
- Their locations and purposes
- Eleven purpose sections
- Eight order sections
- Scriptural quotations from Mañjusrinamasamgiti
- Proofs for the organizational structure
