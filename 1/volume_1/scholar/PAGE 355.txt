[14451-14487] [STRUCTURE] Far-Reaching Water Lamp
The text presents the far-reaching water lamp (rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma) in detail. The structure establishes: (1) essence as holding the aspects of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, (2) etymology of far-reaching and lasso, and (3) recognition of pure and impure vision.

[14451-14487] [PHILOLOGY] Water Lamp Terminology
The term rgyang zhags (far-reaching lasso) derives from casting impure vision far away. The compound dag snang (pure vision) and 'khrul snang (deluded vision) establish the dual aspect. The phrase 'khor 'das gnyis ka (both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa) describes the lamp's scope.

[14451-14487] [CONTEXT] Vision Purification
The text presents the water lamp as the means of purifying vision. It holds both pure and impure aspects, allowing discrimination between them. This reflects the Buddhist path of distinguishing between deluded and enlightened perception.

[14451-14487] [CONCEPT] Vision as Lasso
The text conceptualizes vision as a lasso (zhags) that can bind or liberate. When deluded, vision binds to saṃsāra; when recognized, it casts delusion far away. The same capacity for vision becomes the means of liberation.
