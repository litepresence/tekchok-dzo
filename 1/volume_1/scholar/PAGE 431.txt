[17851-17866] [STRUCTURE] # SA BCAD: Detailed presentation of ye shes divisions
**Analysis:** This section initiates the systematic exposition of the threefold ye shes (gnosis/wisdom) as established in the previous page:
1. gzhi gnas kyi ye shes (wisdom of primordially pure basis)
2. mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i ye shes (wisdom holding characteristics)
3. yul la khyab pa'i ye shes (wisdom pervasive of objects)

[17867-17869] [STRUCTURE] # RIM_KHANG: Expanded explanation of individual natures
**Analysis:** The text marks the beginning of the second major division with gnyis te (two-fold):
1. Detailed explanation of sems and ye shes natures (just completed)
2. Individual meanings (so so'i don) to follow

[17870-17879] [CONTEXT] Thal 'gyur framework for analysis
**Analysis:** The Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Gradual Tantra) provides the fourfold analytical framework:
- ngo bo (essence)
- nges tshig (definitional etymology)
- dbye ba (divisions)
- so so'i don (individual meanings)

This mirrors abhidharma methodology but applies to Dzogchen categories.

[17880-17889] [CONCEPT] Fourfold analysis of sems (mind)
**Analysis:**
1. **Essence (ngo bo):** Recognition arising as subject-object, pervaded by non-awareness (ma rig pa khyab byed)
2. **Definition (nges tshig):** That which cognizes (sems pa) subject and object as such (gzung 'dzin du skyes pas yul dang yul can du sems pas)
3. **Divisions (dbye ba):** dag pa dang ma dag pa (pure and impure)
4. **Individual meanings:** Subsequent elaboration

[17890-17901] [CONTEXT] Sgra gcan 'dzin gyi yul la bstod pa citation
**Analysis:** The citation establishes sems nyid dag pa as:
- smra bsam brjod med shes rab pha rol phyin (ineffable perfection of wisdom)
- ma skyes mi 'gag nam mkha'i ngo bo (unborn, unceasing, space-nature)
- so so rang gi ye shes spyod yul (object of individual self-arising wisdom)
- dus gsum rgyal ba'i yum (mother of buddhas of three times)

[17902-17911] [CONCEPT] Pure mind categories
**Analysis:**
- **sems dag pa:** Path-level purifications (lam dus kyi sems rtog pas ma bslad pa, thar pa'i rgyur rung)
- **sems nyid dag pa:** Primordial purity beyond path
The former includes samadhi-born and compassion-born states that serve as causes of liberation but remain samsaric because they cannot directly perceive self-arisen ultimate.

[17912-17918] [CONTEXT] Rgyud bla ma citation
**Analysis:** Uttaratantra citation on self-arisen ultimate (rang byung don dam) requiring faith (dad pa) for realization, using the analogy of the sun's orb invisible to the blind.

[17919-17928] [CONCEPT] Rol pa and rgyan distinction
**Analysis:**
- rol pa (display/capacity): nus pa or rtsal—the dynamic power arising from basis
- rgyan (ornament): smin sor shar ba—the mature manifestation
Analogies: seed/sprout, form/reflection in mirror

[17929-17944] [STRUCTURE] Samsaric emergence enumeration
**Analysis:** The numerical progression:
- ma rig pa (non-awareness)
- sems (mind)
- yid (mental factor)
- dug lnga (five poisons)
- bcu drug (sixteen afflictions)
- nyi shu rtsa lnga (twenty-five)
- lnga bcu rtsa gcig (fifty-one)
- stong phrag brgyad cu rtsa bzhi (84,000)

[17945-17948] [STRUCTURE] Threefold division structure
**Analysis:** The three subdivisions for detailed explanation:
1. rtsa ba ma rig pa'i dbye ba (divisions of root non-awareness)
2. de las byung ba sems kyi dbye ba (divisions of mind arisen from that)
3. de las byung ba nyon mongs pa'i dbye ba (divisions of afflictions arisen from that)
