[8603-8630] [STRUCTURE] Benefits of Thigle Refinement and Channel Mastery

This section enumerates the benefits (yon tan) of thigle refinement and channel mastery, presenting the signs of accomplishment (rtags) and the integration of physical and mental release. The structure progresses from external benefits to internal realizations, establishing the comprehensive results of completion stage practice.

[8603-8622] [PHILOLOGY] Benefit and Accomplishment Terminology

The text employs result-oriented vocabulary:
- "Yon tan" (qualities/benefits): From yon (source) + tan (to spread)
- "Brjod mi lang" (inexpressible): Beyond verbal description
- "Rgas dang shi ba med pa" (no aging or death): Immortality signs
- "Gzhon cha chags shing bzang ba" (youthful excellence): Rejuvenation
- "Bcus kyis len pa" (essence extraction): Rasayana effect

The particle "ni" marks inexpressibility: "'di yi yon tan brjod mi lang" (the benefits of this are inexpressible). The emphatic "cing" indicates intensity.

[8623-8646] [CONTEXT] Rasayana and Siddha Accomplishments

The benefits correspond to:
- Rasayana (bcud len): Rejuvenation practices
- Ashtasiddhi (grub pa bzhi): Eight great accomplishments
- Maha-siddha biographies: Physical transformation signs
- Nyingma long life practices: Tshe sgrub systems

These represent the outer (phyi) and inner (nang) signs of successful completion stage.

[8647-8670] [CONCEPT] Three-level Benefit System

The benefits manifest on three levels:
1. External (phyi): Physical transformation
   - Skra dkar gnyer ma med pa (no grey hair or wrinkles)
   - Gzhon zhing dar la bab pa (youthful radiance)
   - Tshe nyi zla dang mnyam (solar-lunar lifespan)

2. Internal (nang): Energetic mastery
   - Rtsa 'byongs (channel release)
   - Rlung 'byongs (wind release)
   - Thig le 'byongs (drop release)

3. Secret (gsang): Wisdom realization
   - Rnam rtog nub pa (cessation of conceptuality)
   - Bde ba lhun grub (spontaneously present bliss)
   - Sems gnas pa (mind stabilization)

[STRUCTURE] Postural Methods and Thigle Containment

[8671-8696] [PHILOLOGY] Postural Imperatives and Substance Terms

The postures employ imperative and descriptive language:
- "Stag mo'i 'gyur stangs" (tigress posture): Forceful restraint
- "Seng ge'i 'gying tshugs" (lion posture): Majestic stability
- "'Jag ma'i 'phyur stangs" (jackal posture): Flexible shaking
- "Rtsa gnad kyi 'khor lo" (channel wheel): Complete rotation

The particle "ni" defines function: "stag mo ni bshang lam drag tu bsdams pas" (the tigress forcefully restrains the lower gate). The instrumental "kyis" indicates method.

[8697-8722] [CONTEXT] Animal Symbolism in Tantric Postures

The animal postures derive from:
- Indian siddha traditions: Animal mimicry for energetic effects
- Natya Shastra: Dramatic postures adapted for yoga
- Buddhist tantra: Vajra family animal associations
- Tibetan integration: Bon and Buddhist convergence

Specific associations:
- Tiger: Wrathful activity, lower gate control
- Lion: Illusory body, majesty
- Jackal: Charnel ground practices, flexibility

[8723-8748] [CONCEPT] Lower Gate Control and Wisdom Generation

The tigress posture specifically targets:
- Bshang lam (lower gate): Source of outflows
- Drag tu bsdams pa (forceful restraint): Prevents zag pa (outflows)
- Zag med ye shes (non-outflow wisdom): Arises from containment
- Mechanism: Physical seal creates energetic seal

The posture reverses ordinary downward flow, creating upward momentum for wind and thigle.

[STRUCTURE] Benefits of Bodhicitta Refinement

[8749-8774] [PHILOLOGY] Accomplishment and Capacity Terminology

The text employs achievement vocabulary:
- "Thob pa" (attain/obtain): Resultative achievement
- "Nus pa" (capacity/power): Functional ability
- "'Phur ba" (fly): Levitation capacity
- "Mthong ba" (see): Microscopic vision
- "'Gro nus" (can go): Unobstructed movement

The particle "ni" marks cause: "rtsa 'byongs pas nad mi 'byung" (channel release causes no illness). The instrumental "pas" indicates means.

[8775-8800] [CONTEXT] Six Yogas and Extraordinary Powers

The accomplishments correspond to Six Yogas:
- Walking without touching ground: Sgyu lus (illusory body)
- Seeing body atoms: 'Od gsal (clear light) perception
- Flying: Gtum mo (inner heat) lightness
- Long lifespan: Bcud len (essence extraction)
- Freedom from food/clothing: Thig le mastery
- Transference: 'Pho ba (consciousness projection)

These represent the thun mong gi dngos grub (common accomplishments).

[8801-8826] [CONCEPT] Progressive Unfoldment of Powers

The powers develop sequentially:
1. Rtsa 'byongs: Physical health foundation
2. Rlung 'byongs: Energetic capacity
3. Thig le 'byongs: Essence mastery
4. Integration: All powers manifest

This progression reflects the natural unfoldment of subtle body mastery from coarse to subtle.

[STRUCTURE] Conventional and Ultimate Bodhicitta Completion

[8827-8852] [PHILOLOGY] Conventional-Ultimate Distinction Markers

- "Don dam" (ultimate): Absolute, real
- "Sbyangs pa" (refined): Purified through practice
- "'Byongs pa" (released): Liberated from binding

The particle "ni" distinguishes: "kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems 'byongs pa'i nus pa'o" (this is the power of conventional bodhicitta release). The emphatic "o" marks definition.

[8853-8878] [CONTEXT] Two Truths in Completion Stage

The two bodhicittas represent:
- Kun rdzob: Tantric completion stage methods
- Don dam: Dzogchen ati yoga view

Integration follows Nyingma structure:
- Maha/Anu yoga: Prepares through kun rdzob
- Ati yoga: Culminates in don dam realization
- Non-contradiction: Skillful means (thabs) and wisdom (shes rab) unity

[8879-8904] [CONCEPT] Special Transference and Death Mastery

   - Death-time consciousness projection
   - Bypasses bardo confusion
   - Direct pure realm entry

2. Rnam shes gzhan grong 'jug (entering others' bodies):
