[2903-2963] [STRUCTURE] Path of Non-Learner and Heat Stages
**Analysis:**

**Path of Non-Learner (*mi slob lam*):**

The culmination of the five paths — Buddhahood itself.

**Fruit of Complete Perfection:**

Upon the ground of all-illumination (*kun tu 'od*):
- Self-purpose: Dharma-body (*chos sku*)
- Benefit others: Two supreme form-bodies (*gzugs sku gnyis*)
- Two wisdoms (*shes gnyis*): Beholding all that is and the extent of all
- Activity: Working for beings until samsara emptied

**From Entrance (*'jug pa*):**

```
The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
```

**Three Heat Aspects (*drod gsum*):**

1. **Outer Heat** (*phyi'i drod*):
   - Second ground: Stainless (*dri ma med pa*)
   - Entities appear as empty
   - Practice of concentration (*ting 'dzin*)
   - Arises in two pure grounds

2. **Inner Heat** (*nang gi drod*):
   - Sixth ground: Manifest (*mngon du gyur pa*)
   - Understanding pure knowable as empty

3. **Heat of Both** (*gnyis ka*):
   - Seventh ground: Arises from pure
   - Eighth: Patience (*bzod pa*) attained
   - Ninth: Peak (*rtse mo*) reached
   - Tenth: Supreme dharma of world (*'jig rten chos mchog*)

**Ten Grounds Obtained:**

Through these stages, the bodhisattva traverses the ten grounds (*sa bcu*).

[2964-2993] [CONTEXT] Mind-Only School Introduction
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa transitions to the Cittamatra (*sems tsam pa*) presentation:

**Key Thesis:**

*'dzin pa'i rnam shes kyang sems las byung* — "The holding consciousness also arises from mind."

**The Egg Simile:**

*sgong pa dbye ba ltar* — "As an egg is split"
- Aspects and consciousnesses possessing objects (*rnam bcas kyi rnam shes*) appear in a single mind
- Outer aspect consciousness and inner-holding consciousness both arise
- Through beginningless latent tendencies (*thog ma med pa'i bag chags*)

**Self-Awareness:**

*rang rig tsam las gzhan med par ma grub* — "Self-awareness alone, nothing else is established"

**Objection and Response:**

Objection: "When outer aspect consciousness holds, holding consciousness arises simultaneously — two thoughts."

Response: "It does not become. It does not change. That aspect consciousness is without thought — for this reason."

**The Monkey Simile:**

*spre'u myur du rdzong par zhugs pa ltar* — "As when a monkey quickly enters a fortress"

Appearing in four apertures, entering and looking — illustrating how consciousness moves among objects while remaining single.
