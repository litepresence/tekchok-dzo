[10832-10833] [STRUCTURE] Tripartite Organization of Peerless Ground Section
The section presents the threefold structure announced in the previous page: (1) condensed/common presentation (already begun); (2) extensive explanation from individual aspects (so so'i cha las rgyas par bshad); (3) summary (don bsdu ba'o). This tripartite structure follows standard Indian śāstra methodology: condensation (saṃkṣepa), expansion (vistāra), and summary (piṇḍārtha). The headings appear in reverse order here—the summary heading appears before the content, indicating the section to follow.

[10832-10833] [PHILOLOGY] Structural Terminology
The phrase "so so'i cha" (individual aspects/parts) employs so so (individual, separate, pratyeka) with cha (part, aspect). The term "rgyas par bshad" (extensively explained) uses rgyas pa (extensive, detailed, vistīrṇa). The summary marker "don bsdu ba" (meaning-collected, piṇḍārtha) indicates the section that will synthesize the preceding analysis. The particle "o" with genitive case marks the end of an announcement.

[10834-10846] [STRUCTURE] Ninefold Description of Primordial Ground
The first topic presents a nine-element description of the primordial ground: (1) primordial purity of essence (ngo bo ka nas dag pa); (2) crystal surface without defilement analogy (shel gong dri ma de pa ltar); (3) non-establishment as entities or characteristics (dngos po dang mtshan mar ma grub); (4) spontaneously present nature (rang bzhin lhun gyis grub pa); (5) white interior containing subtle self-light (dkar po'i nang na phra ba'i rang 'od); (6) deep clarity existing (gtiṅ gsal du yod); (7) unmanifest externally due to absence of conditions (rkyen med pas phyir mi snang); (8) external sealed form of youthful vase body (phyi rgya mar ral ba gzhon nu bum pa sku); (9) mode of abiding as Buddha-nature (sku'i gnas lugs su bzhugs). This dense, single-sentence description compresses multiple Dzogchen technical concepts.

[10834-10846] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Vocabulary of the Primordial State
The phrase "thog ma'i gzhi" (primordial ground) establishes the temporal beginninglessness. The crystal analogy (shel gong) references the standard Dzogchen comparison of mind to a crystal surface—pure by nature, temporarily obscured by adventitious defilements (dri ma, āgantuka-mala). The term "dkar po" (white) describes the "white bindu" or luminous essence. The compound "rang 'od" (self-light, svaprabhā) indicates self-illuminating awareness without external source. The term "gtiṅ gsal" (deep clarity) combines depth (gtiṅ) with clarity (gsal). The phrase "rgya mar ral ba" (sealed, closed) describes the hidden nature of the ground before manifestation.

[10834-10846] [CONTEXT] The Youthful Vase Body (gzhon nu bum pa'i sku)
The "youthful vase body" (gzhon nu bum pa'i sku, kumāra-bhāṇḍa-kāya) is a key technical term in Dzogchen cosmogony. It represents the ground prior to any manifestation—"youthful" because unmanifest, "vase" because containing all potential like a vase containing treasure, "body" indicating it is the dimension of the buddha-body. This appears in the Seventeen Tantras (particularly the rDzogs pa skor gsum) and in Longchenpa's Klong chen mdzod bdun. The image combines: (1) the Indian alchemical concept of the kumbha (vase of immortality); (2) the tantric concept of the body as vessel; (3) the Dzogchen concept of ground as container of all manifestation.

[10834-10846] [CONCEPT] Conditioned vs. Unconditioned Manifestation
The text presents a crucial ontological distinction: the primordial ground "exists" (yod) as deep clarity and subtle self-light, yet is "not manifest externally" (phyir mi snang) due to "absence of conditions" (rkyen med pa). This establishes the ground as: (1) not nonexistent (it has ontological status); (2) not manifest (it lacks epistemological availability); (3) dependent on conditions for manifestation (rkyen). This parallels the Yogācāra concept of ālayavijñāna in its latent state and the Sāṃkhya concept of pradhāna prior to manifestation—though Dzogchen distinguishes itself by asserting the ground is beyond both existence and nonexistence.

[10847-10849] [STRUCTURE] Tripartite Summary Formula
The summary presents the classic Dzogchen triad—essence (ngo bo), nature (rang bzhin), and compassion (thugs rje)—in three lines: (1) essence is empty, not established as entities or characteristics; (2) nature is clear, not abandoning the nature of radiant self-display; (3) compassion is awareness-knowledge, expanding as wisdom as the ground of arising without cessation. This three-line formula encapsulates the entire metaphysics of ground in the minimum space.

[10847-10849] [PHILOLOGY] Verbal Architecture of the Triad
Each line follows a parallel structure: subject (essence/nature/compassion) + instrumental case marker + verb phrase. Line 10847: "ngo bo stong pas" (by essence being empty) + "dngos po dang mtshan mar ma grub" (not established as entities or characteristics). Line 10848: "rang bzhin gsal bas" (by nature being clear) + "ye gdangs snang ba'i rang ngo ma dor" (not abandoning the nature of radiant self-display). Line 10849: "thugs rje rig pas" (by compassion being awareness) + "mkhyen pa ye shes su rgyas pa'i 'char gzhi ma 'gags par gnas" (abiding as the ground of arising of expanded knowledge-wisdom without ceasing). The term "ma dor" (not abandoning/not relinquishing) indicates that despite emptiness, appearance is not negated.

[10847-10849] [CONTEXT] The Threefold Ground Formula in Nyingma Sources
The essence-nature-compassion triad is the foundational metaphysical framework of Dzogchen, appearing in all major Nyingma sources: the sGra thal 'gyur tantra (unfolded sound tantra), the Klong drug pa, the Mu tig phreng ba, and throughout Longchenpa's corpus. The formulation derives from Indian Mahāyāna sources—particularly the Ratnagotravibhāga's distinction between dharmakāya (essence), suchness (nature), and seed (compassion)—but Dzogchen reinterprets compassion as thugs rje (responsive awareness) rather than karuṇā in the conventional sense.

[10847-10849] [CONCEPT] Non-Abandonment as Middle Way
The phrase "ma dor" (not abandoning) articulates the Dzogchen middle way position: emptiness (stong pa) does not mean absence of appearance; clarity (gsal ba) does not mean substantial existence. The nature (rang bzhin) maintains both: empty like space, yet clear like a mirror. This resolves the apparent contradiction between the prajñāpāramitā (emptiness) and tathāgatagarbha (buddha-nature) strands of Mahāyāna thought. Longchenpa's synthesis asserts they are not contradictory but dual aspects of a single ground.

[10850-10864] [STRUCTURE] Scriptural Citation with Gloss
The section cites the Great Tantra of Beautiful Auspiciousness (bkra shis mdzes ldan chen po'i rgyud) in a multi-layered format: (1) source citation (10850); (2) temporal specification—before realized buddhas and unrealized sentient beings arose (10851-10852); (3) description of self-arisen awareness-wisdom unmoved from ground (10853); (4) co-presence with unconditioned three appearances (10854); (5) transitional phrase indicating self-utterance (10855-10856); (6) address to great expansive appearance (10857); (7) description of abiding as great unconfused Buddha (10858); (8) sixfold description of essence-body (10859-10864). This structure moves from external citation to internal self-revelation.

[10850-10864] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal and Ontological Markers
The phrase "ma byung ba'i snga rol na" (in the pre-arising of) establishes the temporal frame prior to cosmogony—before any buddhas "arose" (byung) through realization or sentient beings "arose" through delusion. The term "rang byung" (self-arisen, svayaṃbhū) describes awareness-wisdom as without cause or condition. The verb "ma g.yos" (unmoved, unshaken) appears twice, emphasizing the stability of ground. The address "kye" (O!, he!) is a vocative particle used in tantric revelation. The phrase "ma 'khrul pa" (unconfused) describes the Buddha-state prior to the distinction between confusion and liberation.

[10850-10864] [CONTEXT] The Great Tantra of Beautiful Auspiciousness
The bkra shis mdzes ldan chen po'i rgyud is one of the Seventeen Tantras (rgyud bcu bdun) of the Nyingma tradition, specifically within the esoteric instruction class (man ngag sde). These tantras are attributed to primordial revelation by Samantabhadra rather than historical transmission. The citation here presents the "cosmogonic" view from the perspective of ground itself—before the bifurcation into buddhas and sentient beings. This is not a temporal beginning but a logical/ontological priority—describing the nature of ground as it is "in itself" prior to any relation.

[10850-10864] [CONCEPT] The Three Appearances (snang ba gsum)
The "unconditioned three appearances" (rkyen med pa'i snang ba gsum) refers to the three modes of manifestation in Dzogchen cosmogony: (1) snang ba (appearance), (2) mched pa (increase/expansion), and (3) thob pa (attainment). These correspond to the progressive refinement or coarsening of awareness as it moves from ground to manifestation. "Unconditioned" (rkyen med pa) indicates that these appearances are inherent to ground, not produced by external causes. They represent the "blueprint" of manifestation latent within ground, not yet actualized.

[10859-10864] [STRUCTURE] Sixfold Description of Essence-Body
The conclusion presents a sixfold description of the essence-body (ngo bo'i sku): (1) essence non-ceasing (ma 'gags); (2) essence unchanging (mi 'gyur); (3) method secret (thabs gsang ba); (4) unmoved (ma g.yos); (5) unmoving (mi g.yo); (6) unagitated (ma bskyod). This sixfold structure emphasizes the absolute stability of ground. The progression moves from: non-cessation (temporal) → unchanging (ontological) → secret method (epistemological) → unmoved (passive) → unmoving (active) → unagitated (dynamic stability).

[10859-10864] [PHILOLOGY] Privative Prefixes as Ontological Indicators
The six terms employ privative constructions: "ma 'gags" (not-ceasing), "mi 'gyur" (not-changing), "ma g.yos" (not-moved), "mi g.yo" (not-moving), "ma bskyod" (not-agitated). The prefix "ma-" indicates negation of past/perfective action; "mi-" indicates negation of present/imperfective action. This grammatical distinction is significant: "ma g.yos" (was not moved—passive) vs. "mi g.yo" (does not move—active). The term "thabs gsang ba" (secret method/practice) stands out as the only positive description, indicating that the method (of manifestation) is hidden within the essence itself.

[10859-10864] [CONCEPT] Unmoved Ground as Non-Dual Stability
The repetition of "unmoved" (ma g.yos/mi g.yo) in passive and active forms articulates a key Dzogchen concept: ground is not merely static (passive unmoved) but dynamically stable (active unmoving). This parallels the Taoist concept of wu wei (effortless action) and the Vedāntic concept of the unchanging Brahman as the ground of changing phenomena. Ground is: (1) not destroyed when manifestations appear (non-cessation); (2) not altered by manifestations (unchanging); (3) containing the secret of manifestation within itself (secret method); (4) neither pushed by conditions (unmoved) nor pushing manifestations (unmoving); (5) not shaken even by cosmic turbulence (unagitated).
