[17448-17476] [STRUCTURE] # Expanded Explanation of Alaya and Dharmakaya
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation (*rgyas par bshad pa*) in two sections:
1. Alaya expanded explanation
2. Dharmakaya expanded explanation

**Alaya Structure (17451-17476):**
From *thal 'gyur*:
- Alaya and dharmakaya vital point
- Alaya briefly explained
- Dharmas and non-dharmas all's basis
- Essence word distinction with
- Essence latencies vessel
- Classification: body, connection, various, primordial basis

Fivefold analysis of alaya:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*): Compounded virtue, samsara dharmas, latencies with, vessel
2. Definition (*nges tshig*): All-pervading (*kun mang*), gathered, many's time-place or support basis abiding
3. Classification (*dbye ba*):
   - *ye don gyi kun gzhi* (Primordial meaning alaya)
   - *sbyor ba don gyi kun gzhi* (Connection meaning alaya)
   - *bag chags lus kyi kun gzhi* (Latency body alaya)
   - *bag chags sna tshogs pa'i kun gzhi* (Latency various alaya)

[17477-17493] [CONCEPT] Four Alayas Detailed:
1. **Primordial meaning alaya**: Samsara dharmas all's sphere first basis; investigating doer first movement rigpa considering, coeminent ignorance, from reversal spoken
2. **Connection meaning alaya**: That knowing itself self ignorance, samsara connection; knowing, nirvana connection aspect spoken
3. **Latency body alaya**: Root knowing itself body latencies possessing; flesh, blood, light, mind-body arising aspect spoken
4. **Latency various alaya**: That knowing itself impure action latencies source, all's basis making aspect spoken

Though four names, one knowing's aspect four distinctions turned, labeled.

[17494-17507] [CONCEPT] Alaya as Eight Consciousnesses:
From first movement until now, all knowing's support alaya, dependent aggregates eight abiding; individually distinguished, root samsara basis-opening arising basis: primordial meaning and samsara-nirvana connection; body appearing as body; mind latencies dependent alaya basis established. That time knowing's aspect outer-inner not severed, alaya consciousness labeled.

From that, five faculties' respective knowing concept-free five objects holding aspect: five sense-consciousnesses (*sgo lnga'i rnam shes*) labeled.

That time concept-investigation inward-looking realization first that met, mind knowing (*yid shes*), investigating distinguishes specifically holding, object as desired—one mind different aspects known.

Functions (*byed las*):
- Primordial delusion basis makes
- Connection body-mind linked happiness-suffering all-connection makes
- Body body and that aggregates many conditions makes
- Latencies action and afflictions maturation cause-condition makes

Names-entry reasons (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*):
- Latencies prior-later intermediate
- Action karmic result five outer connection
- Cause-result joining
- All-connection binding makes
- Therefore "kun gzhi" word entry

**Summary:** Page 409 provides the expanded explanation of alaya with its fivefold analysis (essence, definition, classification, function, name-entry). The four alayas map different aspects of the deluded basis across ground, connection, body, and latencies.
