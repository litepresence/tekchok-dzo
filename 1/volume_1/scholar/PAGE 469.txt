[00001-00044] [CONCEPT] Cutting Deviations and Fruition: Soteriological Teleology

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage addresses the criteria for cutting deviations and establishes the fruition (bras bu) of practice. The organization: (1) deviations occur for those without direct perception or with weak faculties, (2) the cutting of deviations through recognition of self-abiding awareness, (3) six "thoroughfares" (thug) to rdzogs chen meaning, (4) definition of fruition as great self-perfected primordial attainment. The passage emphasizes that deviations are conceptually constructed while recognition is immediate.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: sems lam byed kyi lta sgom spyod 'bras (mind-made view-meditation-conduct-result), dbang rtul (dull faculties), thag chod gcig gis sa zin (liberated at once by decisive cutting), thug (thoroughfare/arrival point), gdod kyis mi bsgrub par (not newly accomplished from the beginning), chags bral (free from attachment). The six thugs: (1) change-free beyond thought, (2) secret upadeṣa and essential extract, (3) great liberative ground, (4) definitive essential points, (5) attachment-free instructions, (6) single-cut result.

- **[CONTEXT]** The *Nor bu 'phra bkod* citation emphasizes that rdzogs chen is not produced by meditation but is primordially existent (ye yod). This reflects the doctrine of "primordial buddhahood" (ye nas sangs rgyas) fundamental to Great Perfection. The six thoroughfares summarize key rdzogs chen tenets: unchanging thought-free nature, secret instructions and essential extracts, unproduced self-arisen wisdom, single-cut result, three attachment-free instructions. The passage distinguishes between "mind-made" (sems lam byed) and "self-abiding" (rang gnas) practice.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents the soteriological culmination of four-lamp practice: fruition is not an attainment but a recognition of primordial perfection. The six thoroughfares indicate that rdzogs chen realization: (1) is unchanging and thought-free, (2) depends on secret instructions (man ngag) and essential extracts (gsang bcud), (3) is self-arisen wisdom not produced by cultivation, (4) is single-cut (gcig chod) not generated by generation-stage practice, (5) requires three attachment-free instructions. Deviations arise only for those relying on conceptual mind (sems) rather than direct perception (rig pa mngon sum). The cutting of deviations occurs when self-abiding awareness is recognized as the result.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants attested.
