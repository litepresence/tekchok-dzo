[15149-15185] [CONTEXT] Saṃbhogakāya Manifestation
The text presents the saṃbhogakāya as manifesting through the twenty rigpa channels. The five families (rigs lnga) correspond to groups of four channels each. This reflects the tantric understanding of the enjoyment body as the form of complete wisdom.

[15149-15185] [CONCEPT] Enjoyment as Wisdom Display
