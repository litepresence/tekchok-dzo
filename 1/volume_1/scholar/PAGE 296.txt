[12331-12371] [STRUCTURE] Twelve Links of Dependent Origination
The text presents the twelve links of dependent origination (rten 'brel bcu gnyis) as the elaboration of delusion. The structure presents: (1) non-recognition (ma rig pa) as the first link, (2) the four conditions as formative forces ('du byed pa), (3) consciousness (rnam par shes pa) as coarse cognition engaging objects, (4) name-and-form (ming dang gzugs) as body-mind individuation, (5) six sense-fields (skye mched drug) as differentiated capacities, (6) contact (reg pa) as engagement with objects, (7) feeling (tshor ba) as the three types of sensation, (8) craving (sred pa) as attachment to pleasure-aversion to pain, (9) grasping (len pa) as accepting objects, (10) becoming (srid pa) as karma maturing future birth, (11) birth (skye ba) as birth in different realms, (12) aging-and-death (rga shi) as the lifecycle completion. The passage establishes the twelve links as delusion's complete expression.

[12331-12371] [PHILOLOGY] Dependent Origination Terminology
The passage employs standard Pratītyasamutpāda terminology: ma rig pa (avidyā), 'du byed (saṃskāra), rnam shes (vijñāna), ming gzugs (nāmarūpa), skye mched (āyatana), reg pa (sparśa), tshor ba (vedanā), sred pa (tṛṣṇā), len pa (upādāna), srid pa (bhava), skye ba (jāti), rga shi (jarāmaraṇa). The phrase dga' gdung bar ma gsum (pleasure, pain, neutral) identifies the three feelings. The compound las dang nyon mongs (karma and afflictions) describes the forces producing becoming. The term 'khor lo (wheel) describes the cyclical nature.

[12331-12371] [CONTEXT] Pratītyasamutpāda in Dzogchen
The twelve links presentation integrates standard Buddhist dependent origination theory with Dzogchen's non-recognition framework. While classical Buddhism presents dependent origination as the mechanism of saṃsāra, Dzogchen presents it as the elaboration of initial non-recognition. The Gzhi snang chen po (Great Basis-Manifestation) citation provides textual authority. The framework demonstrates Dzogchen's comprehensive engagement with classical Buddhist doctrine while transforming its interpretation through the lens of recognition.

[12331-12371] [CONCEPT] Delusion's Complete Expression
The conceptual framework establishes the twelve links as the complete expression of initial non-recognition. From the minimal failure to recognize (ma rig pa), the entire saṃsāric edifice unfolds through the mechanisms of dependent origination. Each link represents a further solidification of delusion: non-recognition produces formations, formations produce individuated consciousness, consciousness produces name-and-form, and so forth until aging-and-death completes the cycle. The framework establishes that all twelve links can be present in a single moment of delusion (skad cig ma dang po la 'khrul lo)—the entire process can occur instantaneously, not requiring temporal development. This reflects the Dzogchen view that saṃsāra is not a temporal process but a mistaken mode of perception.
