[14984-14989] [STRUCTURE] Completion of Channel Enumeration
**Analysis:** Continues numerical enumeration from previous page:
- Line 14984: "gseng du rung ba brgyad" - eight suitable for incising/cutting
- Line 14985: "gasregs na skyon 'gyur lhag ma'o" - remaining [channels] cause faults if cauterized
- Line 14986-14987: Identifies two categories among the "gnas pa'i lhag ma" (remaining channels of abiding) that cause faults if cauterized
- Line 14988: Summary statement "de ni gnas pa'i gnad yin no" - these are the essential points of abiding
- Line 14989: Citation closure "ཞེས་སོ་"

[14990-14991] [CONTEXT] Transition to Medical Application
**Analysis:** Structural transition via "བཞི་པ་" (fourth) introduces practical medical application: "rtsa gnas 'dir nad byung na bcos su rung ba'i thabs" - methods for treating diseases when they arise at these channel locations. Cites "gnad yig" - text on essential points/procedures, indicating medical literature lineage.

[14992-15001] [PHILOLOGY] Bloodletting Channel Nomenclature (Right/Left Throat)
**Analysis:** Technical medical terminology for bloodletting (gtar) channels:
- Line 14992-14993: Right throat ascending channel (mgrin pa g.yas na gyen la rgyug), letter E (ཨེ་), named "rtse chung g.yas" - small-tip right
  - Indication: "mjing ba rengs" - stiff neck/paralysis

The enumeration associates specific seed syllables (yi ge) with anatomical locations and therapeutic applications.

[15004-15014] [CONCEPT] Physiological Mapping of Nāḍī System
**Analysis:** Continued mapping of shoulder channels with specific therapeutic targets:
- Right shoulder center (nyi dkyil g.yas): letter A, "dug rtsa yon po" - twisted poison channel
  - Indication: "dug gi nad" - poison/venom diseases
- Left: "sbal rtsa chen po" - great toad channel
  - Indication: "smyo 'bog brgyal" - madness/fainting/syncope
- Right shoulder corner (dpung zur g.yas): letter I (ཨཱི་), "sbal rtsa nag po" - black toad channel

- Left: letter DI (ཌཱི་), "gser rtsa thung po" - short gold channel
  - Indication: "rtsa yi nad rnams sel" - dispels all channel diseases

[15015-15033] [PHILOLOGY] Additional Bloodletting Locations and Syllables
**Analysis:** Extended list of seed syllables and channel names:
- Line 15015-15017: Sog pa'i me long dkyil (center of cheek mirror), letter O, "glo rtsa chen po" - great lung channel
  - Indication: "mgo bo 'khyom" - dizziness/vertigo (treated by cauterization)
- Line 15018-15020: Dpung pa'i lug 'jug dkyil (center of shoulder insertion), letter O, "gshen thag g.yas pa" - right gshen rope
  - Indication: "dpung pa byung ba sel" - dispels shoulder ailments
- Line 15021-15022: Left side, letter I, "gshen thag g.yon pa" - left gshen rope
  - Indication: "pho ba khengs" - bloated stomach
- Line 15023-15026: Four additional locations with syllables RI, LI, LI, AI (རཱི་, ལཱི་, ལི་, ཨཱཻ་)
  - mgrin 'og khud (throat hollow below)
  - rtse mtshon g.yas (right point/weapon)
  - stag dkyil (tiger center)
  - mdun dkyil (front center)

[15027-15034] [CONCEPT] Esoteric Practice Integration
**Analysis:** Lines 15027-15034 transition from external medical application to internal yogic practice:
- Warning: "'di kun gtem zhing dkrugs pa min" - these are not to be pierced or agitated (inappropriately)
- Application: When "rnal 'byor lus kyi 'byung 'khrugs" - yogic elemental disturbances occur in the body
- Method: Recitation (bzlas pa) of the syllables (yi ge) combined with breath (dbugs) at their respective locations (phyogs) and surface points (tho phyi)
- Assurance: "'di shes 'byung ba 'khrugs mi srid" - knowing this, elemental disturbances become impossible
This demonstrates the integration of external medicine (gtar) with internal yoga (rlung sgom), where channel knowledge serves dual purposes.
