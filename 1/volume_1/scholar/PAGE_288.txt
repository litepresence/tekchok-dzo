[12001-12047] [STRUCTURE] Samantabhadra's Liberation: Threefold Presentation and Instantaneous Recognition
This section initiates the second major division on Samantabhadra's modes of liberation (kun tu bzang po'i grol tshul), structured in three parts: (1) instantaneous liberation upon perceiving basis-manifestation (gzhi snang mthong ba'i skad cig grol ba'i tshul, 12001-12006), (2) abiding in the expanse after liberation (grol nas dbyings na bzhugs pa'i tshul, implied to continue beyond this page), and (3) activity for others' benefit (gzhan don mdzad pa'i tshul, implied). The first section presents a precise phenomenology: original expanse (thog ma'i dbyings) → internal radiance externalizing (nang gdangs phyir shar) → moment of non-recognition creating basis-manifestation (thugs rje rig pa rang ma rig pa'i char skyes) → outward attention (kha phar bltas) → recognition moment (tshur rig pa'i skad cig) → instantaneous self-liberation through differentiation (skad cig la rang snang du bye brag phyed pas, 12010). The remainder provides scriptural citations from the *Thal 'gyur*, *gSang ba bka' bgros*, and *Sgyu 'phrul* tantras.

[12001-12047] [PHILOLOGY] Particles of Instantaneity and Recognition Syntax
Critical grammatical markers: (1) The temporal particle skad cig (instant/moment, 12008, 12010, 12011, 12012) creates a crescendo of immediacy; (2) The directional opposition phar (outward/thither, 12007) vs. tshur (inward/hither, 12008) maps the topology of delusion and recognition; (3) The tsam (merely/just) minimizing non-recognition: rang ma rig pa'i char skyes tsam (merely a moment of non-recognition arising, 12007); (4) The terminative du with verbs of cognition: bltas pas (having looked), rig pa (recognizing), phyed pas (having differentiated); (5) The causative skyes with conditioning: 'khrul par ma gyur pas (not becoming deluded, 12015); (6) The citation markers introducing authoritative texts: thal 'gyur las (12013), dgongs pa bka' bgros rgyud las (12021), rang byung bde ba 'khor lo'i rgyud las (12037), sgyu 'phrul las (12041); (7) The enumerative particle ste/so marking verse closure.

[12001-12047] [CONTEXT] Prasāda, Māyājāla, and Mind-Directive Tantras
The passage extensively cites Atiyoga tantras: (1) *Thal 'gyur* (Prasāda, 12013-12020): "Since saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning-end, buddhas do not delude" - establishes non-dual primordial liberation; (2) *Dgongs pa bka' bgros* (Mind Directives, 12021-12036): presents six aspects of Kun tu bzang po's recognition destroying non-recognition - "even a bit of mind empties, from bit of awareness arises, aware obscuration destroyed, clear-by-clear darkness dispelled, spontaneous arising without obscuration, free from superimposition and denigration"; (3) *Rang byung bde ba 'khor lo* (Self-Arisen Bliss Wheel, 12037-12040): "from bit arises awareness, spontaneously clear free from superimposition"; (4) *Sgyu 'phrul* (Māyājāla, 12041-12044): "differentiated in one instant, perfected buddha in one instant." These establish the canonical basis for cig car (instantaneous) liberation.

[12001-12047] [CONCEPT] The Mechanics of Instantaneous Recognition and the Six Characteristics
The philosophical architecture demonstrates that liberation requires only recognition, not causal conditions: (1) Delusion occurs in a single moment of outward attention (kha phar bltas) without self-recognition; (2) Recognition is the same moment turned inward (tshur rig pa); (3) Differentiation (bye brag phyed pa) is not analysis but recognition of what is already differentiated; (4) The six characteristics (chos drug, 12076-12082) of Samantabhadra's awakening: (a) gzhi las 'phags pa (transcending the basis) - not remaining in neutral ground, (b) rang ngor snang ba (self-display) - recognizing manifestation as own display, (c) bye brag phyed pa (differentiation) - discriminating awareness from non-recognition, (d) phyed thog grol ba (liberation-upon-differentiation) - freedom concurrent with recognition, (e) gzhan las ma byung ba (non-arising-from-other) - not dependent on conditions, (f) rang sar gnas pa (self-abiding) - resting in natural state. The three "non-arisings" (12083-12085) establish self-arisen wisdom: not from cause, not from mind, not from scripture. The resolution of the "primordially liberated" paradox (12045-12066): Kun tu bzang po awakens without gradual virtue (dge ba rdul tsam ma byas par) yet analysis reveals recognition itself is outflow-free merit accumulation (zag med rang byung gi dge ba rgya mtsho), fulfilling both causal and acausal paradigms.
