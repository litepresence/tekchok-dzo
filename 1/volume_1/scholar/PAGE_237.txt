[9585-9622] [STRUCTURE] The Wrathful Heruka and Sense-Power Clairvoyances

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage completes the four-kaya presentation with the wrathful body (*khro bo'i sku*), then enumerates sense-power clairvoyances (*dbang po'i mngon shes*). Organization: (1) wrathful Heruka teacher, location, teaching, retinue, time, field, dharma, and activity, (2) summary of sixteen sets of four (=64) related to empowerment and fruition, (3) six hundred sixty-six powers purifying six migrations' karma and afflictions, (4) thirty-six sense-power clairvoyances (six per sense).

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *khro bo'i sku'i ston pa* (wrathful body's teacher), *ye shes kyi he ru ka* (wisdom Heruka), *gnas bhandha 'bar ba'i gzhal yas khang* (Bhandha blazing palace), *klad pa dung khang dkar po* (skull conch house white), *bde chen gyi 'bar 'dzag* (great bliss blazing dripping), *sgron ma rnams pa bzhi* (four lamps), *ye shes rang 'khyil ba'i dus* (wisdom self-swirling time), *mig gi dbang po mthong ba ma 'gags pa* (eye sense-power seeing not-ceasing), *gzugs kyi de bzhin nyid* (form's thusness), *yul dang shes pa la khros pas* (fierce toward object and knowledge), *thog mar mthong ba rnam par dag pa* (first view purify), *zag pa med pa'i mngon par shes pa* (outflow-free superknowledge), *dbang po'i mthong ba rnam par dag pa'i mngon par shes pa drug* (six superknowledges of purified sense-power view), *dus gsum dus gcig la mthong ba* (seeing three times as one time), *pra sen mthong ba* (seeing like prasena).

- **[CONCEPT]** The wrathful body presentation mirrors the peaceful structure but emphasizes fierce activity (*khros pa*) toward object-knowledge. The eightfold structure (teacher, location, teaching, retinue, time, field, dharma, activity) applies to each kaya. The summary calculation: sixteen fours (=64) for empowerment/fruition plus sixteen fours (=64) for bodies = 128; combined as 108 + 28 = 128 empowerment fruition perfections. The clairvoyances of purified sense-power view: six sense powers (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) each with six superknowledges = 36. These correspond to knowing the thirty limbs of existence (*srid pa yan lag sum cu*).

[9613-9622] [CONTEXT] Sense-Power Clairvoyances Detailed

**Analysis:**
- **[CONTEXT]** Detailed enumeration of six superknowledges for each sense power:
  - **Eye (6):** know all forms
  - **Ear (6):** understand all spoken sounds
  - **Nose (6):** definite arrival at six migrations' karma
  - **Tongue (6):** know six migrations' circles and enjoyments
  - **Body (6):** know all six migrations' forms—atoms and gross
  - **Mind (6):** know all six migrations' thoughts

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *mig gi mngon shes drug* (six eye superknowledges), *gzugs thams cad shes* (know all forms), *rna ba'i mngon shes drug* (six ear superknowledges), *brjod pa'i sgra thams cad gtan la phebs* (definite arrival at all spoken sounds), *sna'i drug* (six nose), *'gro ba drug gi las gtan la phebs* (definite arrival at six migrations' karma), *lce'i drug* (six tongue), *'gro drug gi 'khor dang longs spyod shes* (know six migrations' circles and enjoyments), *lus kyi drug* (six body), *'gro drug gi gzugs rdul phran dang rags pa thams cad shes* (know all six migrations' forms atoms and gross), *yid kyi drug* (six mind), *'gro drug gi bsam pa thams cad shes* (know all six migrations' thoughts).

- **[CONCEPT]** These thirty-six sense-power clairvoyances (6 senses × 6 each) enable the practitioner to perceive completely across all six migrations (*'gro ba drug*). The "definite arrival" (*gtan la phebs*) indicates direct, non-conceptual perception. Line 9622 notes that through subtracting from the division-basis, thirty sense-power clairvoyances exist—knowing the thirty limbs of existence.
