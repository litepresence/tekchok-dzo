[3493-3517] [CONCEPT] Four Expanses and Wisdoms of Anuyoga (Continued)
**Analysis:** Lines 3493-3517 present Anuyoga's path structure in detail:

**Three Fruition Timings [3493-3495]:**
1. Buddhahood in one birth (*skye ba gcig la sangs rgya*)
2. Intermediate state certainty (*bar ma do la sangs rgyas bar nges pa*)
3. After passing through births, at most hundred (*tha na yang skye ba brgyud nas*)

**Four Dbyings-Ye-shes Systems:**

1. **Rnam par grol ba'i gzhi** (Liberation basis) [3496-3501]:
   - *byas chos* — Created phenomena
   - *rtsol sgrub* — Effort and accomplishment
   - *'pho ldog med* — No transformation/reversal
   - *stong nyid bsam ngo dang bral ba* — Emptiness beyond conceptual mind
   - Self-arisen wisdom (*rang byung gi ye shes*) shines
   - All dharmas realized as great self-liberated ground
   - Called: Self-liberated without effort (*'bad med rang grol*)

2. **Lam gyi dbyings-ye-shes** (Path) [3502-3507]:
   - Various appearances as path expanse-wisdom
   - All various appearances as play (*rol pa*)
   - Directionless (*phyogs med*) shining
   - Variously liberated without cessation (*'gag med*)
   - Spontaneously accomplished (*lhun grub*), directionally holding
   - Illusion-pure, directionless wisdom shines
   - All dharmas realized without acceptance/rejection, negation/affirmation, desire
   - Called: Spontaneously accomplished mode (*lhun grub rdzogs tshul*)

3. **'Bras bu'i dbyings-ye-shes** (Result) [3508-3512]:
   - Great self-liberation beyond action
   - Not abiding in samsara-nirvana
   - Beyond view-meditation of extreme-free emptiness
   - Wisdom of bliss-pain equally realized
   - Called: Dharmatā beyond action

4. **Zung 'jug** (Union) [3513-3517]:
   - Expanse-wisdom entering gradually
   - Abiding, empty, bliss
   - Without arrogance (*bla nga*), without rejection
   - Called: Union (*zung 'jug*)

[3518-3528] [CONCEPT] Five Entry Modes of Anuyoga
**Analysis:** Lines 3518-3528 present five approaches to expanse-wisdom:

1. **Simultaneous** (*cig car*) [3518]:
   - Expanse-wisdom entering simultaneously
   - Beyond view of self-arisen dharmatā
   - Called: Cig car (without cause to liberate)

2. **All-at-once** (*thar chags*) [3519-3520]:
   - Understanding everything is, yet nothing is particular
   - Not rejecting all (*kun mi spong*)
   - Nothing to obtain (*thob rgyu gang yang med*)
   - Called: Thar chags

3. **Thodgal** (Leap-over) [3521-3522]:
   - Entering leap-over manner
   - Appearance-liberation (*mthong snang dang grol*) without needing action/effort
   - Called: Thodgal Anuyoga

4. **Non-dual Equality** (*gnyis med ngo mnyam*) [3523]:
   - Expanse-wisness without difference
   - View of non-dual equality

5. **Abiding Non-change** (*gnas pa las gzhan du 'gyur ba med*) [3524-3525]:
   - No going-coming in expanse-wisdom
   - View of non-change from abiding

**Three Additional Views [3526-3528]:**
- Beyond partiality and falling (*rgya chad dang phyogs lhung med*)
- Primordially abiding (*ye gdod ma nas gnas pa*)
- Free from dependent basis (*ltos gzhi dang bral ba*)

[3529-3533] [PHILOLOGY] Expanses as Ground, Path, Result
**Analysis:** Lines 3529-3533 present the functional relationships:

**Ground-Path Structure [3529-3530]:**
- Expanses as ground (*don gyi dbyings gzhi yin*)
- Wisdom as path (*ye shes lam yin*)
- Persons on path liberate through effort

**Cause-Result Structure [3531-3532]:**
- Expanse as cause (*dbyings rgyu yin*)
- Wisdom as result (*ye shes 'bras bu yin*)
- Sharp faculties liberate without depending on external cause-result actions

**Line 3533:**
- *rtogs dka' ba* — Difficult to realize
- *rgyas par bshad pa* — Explained extensively

[3534-3538] [STRUCTURE] Introduction to Atiyoga (Dzogchen)
**Analysis:** Line 3534 introduces the ninth topic — Instruction Atiyoga Great Perfection (*man ngag rdzogs pa chen po*):

**Defining Characteristics:**
- *rang byung gi ye shes* — Self-arisen wisdom
- *'khor 'das su grub pa med* — No establishment in samsara-nirvana
- *ye grol spang blang las 'das* — Primordial liberation beyond acceptance/rejection

**Ultimate View [3537-3538]:**
- Not established anywhere (*gang du'ang ma grub*)
- Non-ceasing wisdom of all-liberation (*thams cad grol ba'i ye shes su mi 'gag*)

**Critical Distinction:** Atiyoga transcends even the subtle duality of expanse and wisdom found in Anuyoga.
