[10539-10584] [STRUCTURE] Refutation of Spontaneous Presence as Ground
**Analysis:** Lines 10539-10584 present the refutation of the first extreme view: asserting spontaneous presence as ground (lhun grub tu 'dod pa dgag pa). The structure follows a two-part formula: (1) presenting the view to be refuted ('dod pa brjod pa), and (2) refuting it (de dgag pa). Lines 10543-10545 present the assertion: spontaneous presence as natural state (lhun gyis grub pa'i gnas lugs) desired to be unfabricated (rgya gar yang ma chad phyogs gang du yang ma lhung bar 'dod do). Lines 10546-10551 present seven refutations: (1) if spontaneously present from the first, cyclic existence would not make sense to liberate (dang po nas lhun gyis grub na 'khor ba rtag tu 'khor bas grol bar mi rigs), (2) nirvana would not depend on conditions (myang 'das rang ngo shes pa la sogs pa'i rkyen la mi ltos par thal), (3) both samsara and nirvana could not have spontaneous presence as ground (de gnyis kyi gzhi lhun grub yin no zhes pa'ang mi rigs), (4) spontaneous presence being unchanging, samsara and nirvana could not arise (lhun grub yin na mi 'gyur bas 'khor 'das 'byung bar mi rigs), (5) everyone would be effortlessly liberated (su yang 'bad med du grol bar 'gyur). Lines 10552-10584 cite the Klong drug pa tantra presenting similar refutations with the conclusion that spontaneous presence as ground is not established (don ngo btub pa lags ma lags), spoken by Samantabhadra (kun tu bzang pos bdag la gsungs).

[10551-10584] [PHILOLOGY] Consequential Reasoning Particles
**Analysis:** The passage employs consequential reasoning (thal 'gyur) with characteristic particles. The consequence particle thal (it follows/absurd consequence) appears at lines 10547, 10548, 10549, 10550, 10553, 10555, 10556, 10557, and 10559, marking each step of the reductio ad absurdum argument. The phrase "de lta na" (if that is so) at line 10553 introduces the consequence. The causal particle phyir (because) at lines 10548, 10549, 10550, 10552, 10556, and 10557 provides the reason for each consequence. The phrase "mi rigs te" (does not make sense/logically impossible) at lines 10546, 10549, 10550, 10552 marks conclusions. This systematic employment of consequential reasoning particles demonstrates Longchenpa's mastery of Indian pramana methodology applied to Dzogchen doxography.

[10585-10618] [CONCEPT] Uncertainty Ground Refutation
**Analysis:** Lines 10585-10618 present the refutation of the second extreme view: asserting ground as uncertain (ma nges par 'dod pa). Lines 10586-10587 present the assertion: because essence is not established (gshis ma grub pas), it is uncertain (ma nges la), transformed by conditions (rkyen gyis bsgyur bas ma nges). Lines 10588-10593 cite the Sems sde (Mind Section) tantra presenting the uncertainty view: from various names of uncertainty (nges med ming gi sna tshogs las), meaning also empty of mere imputation (don kyang btags pa tsam gyis stong), because not established as single nature (rang bzhin gcig tu ma nges pas), appearing however imputed (gang ltar btags pa de ltar snang). Lines 10594-10618 present the refutation: (1) if one, contradicted by one-not-one material difference (gcig yin na gcig ma yin pa dngos 'gal rdzas tha dad pa'i rigs pas gnod), (2) if this uncertain ground is samsara's source, it would be certain there (de nyid du nges pa'i phyir), (3) if nirvana's ground, same problem, (4) if pure, impure cannot exist (dag pa yin dus ma dag pa ma yin pas), contradicting alternating uncertainty (res 'jog ma nges par 'dod pa dang 'gal), (5) from purity could return to impurity (yang dri ma dag nas kyang ma dag par ldog par thal), (6) samsara and nirvana would mix ('khor 'das phan tshun 'chol bar thal), (7) beings would be effortlessly liberated while buddhas return to suffering (sems can 'bad med du grol la sangs rgyas ma dag par log nas sdug bsngal la spyod pa thal), (8) ground would be sentient (gzhi de sems pa can du thal). Lines 10607-10618 cite the Klong drug pa tantra refuting uncertainty ground with the conclusion that these are knowable objects, not ultimate (shes bya ma lags sam).

[10619-10637] [STRUCTURE] Certainty Ground Refutation
**Analysis:** Lines 10619-10637 present the refutation of the third extreme view: asserting ground as certain/established (nges par 'dod pa). Line 10621 presents the assertion: because essence is unchanging (ngo bo la 'gyur ba med pas), like space (nam mkha' lta bu), mode of appearance unchangeable like fire and water (snang tshul bsgyur du mi btub pa me dang chu lta bur nges par 'dod). Lines 10623-10637 present the refutation: (1) from unestablished essence and unchangeable appearance, cyclic existence could not arise (ngo bo la med snang tshul bsgyur du mi btub pas gzhi de las 'khor ba 'byung bar mi 'thad), and no one could be liberated (su yang grol bar mi rung), (2) if nirvana existed from the first, no different from eternalist non-Buddhists (mya 'das thog ma nas yod na mu stegs rtag pa dang khyad med), contradicting liberation from causes and conditions (rgyu rkyen las grol bar 'dod pa dang 'gal), (3) if cyclic existence's essence is nirvana ('khor ba'i ngo bo myang 'das yin), unchanging ('mi 'gyur), then no need to newly liberate (gzod 'grol mi dgos), like not needing to transform fire's heat (me tsha bar da gzod bsgyur mi dgos pa bzhin), (4) if mind-appearance needs liberation (blo snang la dgos so zhe na), contradicts unchangeable appearance (snang tshul bsgyur mi btub pa dang 'gal), (5) if samsara's mode of appearance not ground's mode of appearance ('khor ba'i sna tshul yin gyi gzhi'i snang tshul min), then two grounds (gzhi de gnyis bcas su thal), because samsara's mode of appearance exists separate from ground (gzhi las logs na 'khor ba'i snang tshul yod pa'i phyir), (6) if recognizing ground makes it certain (yang gzhi de rtogs nas nges par 'dod na), cannot be ground because recognition precedes ground (rtogs pa'i sngon du rtogs gzhi yod la).

[10638-10657] [CONTEXT] Self-Contradiction in Recognition Theory
**Analysis:** Lines 10638-10657 continue the refutation: (7) if mind of recognition arises after (de nas rtog pa'i blo byung ba'i phyir), recognition does not depend on ground (rtogs pa la gzhi mi ltos), yet recognition's mind depends on ground (gzhi la rtogs pa'i blo ltos kyang), then recognition must have existed before (rtogs pa'i sngon nas yod dgos pas khyab bo)—self-contradiction, (8) if unknown also ground (ma rtogs kyang gzhi yin na), who knows it is ground? (gzhi yin par gang gis shes), if mind knows (blos shes na), then unknown also being ground is refuted (ma rtogs kyang gzhi yin pa bud do). Lines 10644-10657 cite the Klong drug tantra refuting certainty ground with the simile of those with yellow eye disease (mig ser can) seeing conch as yellow (dung las ser po snang ba), establishing that certainty views are like eye disease—subjective distortions rather than objective truths. The conclusion: these are knowable objects, not ultimate (shes bya ma lags sam), spoken by the teacher (ston pas gsungs pa), same as before (sngar dang mtshungs).
