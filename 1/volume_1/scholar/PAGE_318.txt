[L1-12] [PHILOLOGY] Third Week: Fire Element Purification
**Analysis:** On the third day (zhag gsum pa), the wind-mind with cause-condition (rlung sems rgyu rkyen dang bcas pa) is burned to mere subtle atoms (rdul phra rab tsam du bsregs pas), experiencing suffering like entering a pit of red fire (me dmar po'i 'obs su tshud pa tsam gyis sdug bsngal myong). At this time, the body's cause is grasped as merely wind (lus kyi rgyu rlung tsam du sngan), while the condition is wrapped downward merely as feet (rkyen rkang tsam mar tsam du 'dril). On the fourth day (zhag bzhi pa), those are scattered as mere atoms of wind-mercury (rlung gi dngul chu'i rdul phra rab tsam du gtor), experiencing suffering like being carried piece by piece by executioners (gsad shing gis yan lag dum bur khyer ba'i sdug bsngal). This arises from anger (khong khro).

[L13-23] [CONCEPT] Element Maturation and Seasonal Cycles
**Analysis:** The maturation of the body's cause to subtle atoms (rdul phra rab tsam du smin pa) with the condition clarifying as radiance-clarity (bkrag mdangs su gsal bar byas pa) represents the external four elements' functioning activities (phyi'i 'byung ba bzhi'i byed pa'i las) projecting (gzings pa), while internally grasped as four elements (nang gi 'byung ba'i bzhir bzung). At the time of body completion (lus rdzogs pa'i tshe), externally there are seasonal divisions of sun and moon (phyir nam zla dus bzhi), internally operating as day-night-inner-outer four (nang du nyin mtshan nang nub bzhi la spyod pa) - this arises from that. Through that key point, the four empowerments' transformation is indicated (dbang bzhi'i 'gyur mtshon pa).

[L24-39] [CONTEXT] Fourth Week: Life-Force Channel Development
**Analysis:** On the fourth day (zhag bzhi pa), water pervades, channels spread, elements clear and light, movement occurs, wind carries upward (khyab pa chu'i rtsa 'phro zhing gsal ba'i nang du khams yang zhing bskyod pa chags pa rlung gis yar phul lo). From that, in the four directions, earth-water-fire-wind channels quiver, pulsate, and twist (phyogs bzhi chu'i sa/me/rlung gi rtsa 'dar ba/'khyug pa/'khril ba). Within them, the syllables KHAM (blue, red, yellow) abide quivering, pulsating, twisting - when development completes, many mental movements arise from this (ljang ba/dmar ba/ser ba gsum rtsa de dag dang mthun par 'dar ba/'khyug pa/'khril bar gnas pa ni lugs rdzogs pa na blo'i 'gyu ba mang ba de las byung ba). In the center of these four, abides what is called "life-awareness" like a stretched cord (tshe shes bya ba thag bsgrengs pa lta bur gnas). This itself is called: life (tshe), time (dus), occasion (skabs), from which abiding, increasing and decreasing occur.

[L40-44] [PHILOLOGY] Life-Force Configuration and Birth Sounds
**Analysis:** If that abides straight (drang por gnas na), life is long, ripening in the body, falling to earth with the sound "A YU" (sgra A yu zhes grags pa). If the life-cord twists to the left (tshe ba thag g.yon du 'khyil na), obstacles to life occur, immediately after birth the sound KHAM arises (skyes ma thag tu khaM zhes pa'i sgra grags). If twisting downward (thur la 'khyog na), life is short, immediately after birth the sound "A KRIM" arises (sgra a khrim zhes 'byung). From treatises: "Life is warmth and consciousness, the support of the distinct consciousness" (srog ni tshe yin drod dang ni/rnam shes rten gang yin pa'o) - this is explained here.
