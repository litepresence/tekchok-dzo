[12470-12500] [STRUCTURE] Conclusion of Delusion Section and Chapter Summary
The text concludes the section on delusion and summarizes the ninth chapter. The structure presents: (1) summary statement that these are the delusion modes of sentient beings through non-recognition, (2) the range from beginning (lhundrub's self-arising) to end (cessation of delusion), (3) the distinction between delusion's end (extreme impurity) and buddhahood's end, (4) citation of the text's title, (5) transition to the next section on delusion modes and reversal through symbolic language. The passage marks the completion of the ninth chapter (rim khang dgu pa) on saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's crossroads from the door of lhundrub's appearance modes.

[12470-12500] [PHILOLOGY] Concluding Terminology
The passage employs concluding terminology: 'khrul tshul (delusion mode), sangs rgyas pa (buddhahood), rabs chad po'i dri ma (extreme impurity of lineage). The compound thog mtha' (beginning and end) indicates the complete range. The phrase gyes mdo (crossroads/juncture) characterizes the ninth chapter's topic. The citation formula /theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod las/ (From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle) establishes textual identity. The term brda'i sgo (symbolic door) indicates the next section's method.

[12470-12500] [CONTEXT] Textual Architecture and Chapter Division
The passage marks a major textual division—the conclusion of the ninth chapter out of eleven. The Rim khang (Sequential Chambers) structure organizes the text into eleven major sections. This chapter (rim khang dgu pa) has covered: (1) eight qualities of lhundrub, (2) defect-quality transformation, (3) liberation and delusion modes, (4) arising and dissolution, (5) Samantabhadra's liberation, (6) sentient beings' delusion. The transition to the tenth section on symbolic presentation (brda'i sgo) indicates a shift to esoteric communication methods.

[12470-12500] [CONCEPT] Delusion-Buddhahood Asymmetry
The conceptual framework establishes an asymmetry between delusion and buddhahood: the end of delusion is extreme impurity (rabs chad po'i dri ma)—the culmination of non-recognition's trajectory—while the end of buddhahood is not a parallel extreme but recognition's completeness. This asymmetry reflects the Dzogchen view that delusion is adventitious (glo bur) and has an end, while buddhahood is inherent (rang gnas) and has no end. Delusion is a path that exhausts itself; buddhahood is the recognition that has always been the case. The framework establishes that the path of delusion leads to increasing constriction and impurity, while the path of recognition leads to the expansive recognition of what has always been free.
