[12418-12469] [STRUCTURE] Six Non-Recognitions Detailed: Comprehensive Obscuration
This section presents six non-recognitions (ma rig pa drug) arising as self-possession: (1) Root-mind non-recognition (rtsa ba sems kyi ma rig pa, 12407-12414) - co-emergent (lhan cig skyes pa) non-recognition of awareness-wisdom: not recognizing rig pa's ye shes, wondering "Did awareness-appearance arise from me or not mine?", conceiving mind (snyem byed) producing self-grasping; (2) Delusion-object non-recognition ('khrul pa yul gyi ma rig pa, 12415-12422) - from Wish-Fulfilling Tree (dpag bsam gyi shing) and cosmic egg (sgo nga) warmth-moisture, producing self-arisen wisdom that creates world; (3) Delusion-basis non-recognition ('khrul gzhi gzhi'i ma rig pa, 12423-12432) - four conditions producing individuation: causal produces root non-recognition, observed produces delusion-object, dominant produces self-grasping, immediately antecedent produces coarse consciousness; (4) Grasping-thought non-recognition ('dzin pa rtog pa'i ma rig pa, 12433-12459) - six minds arising from afflictions; (5) Fabricated-path non-recognition (bcos pa lam gyi ma rig pa, 12460-12466); (6) Unknown-delusion non-recognition (ma shes rmongs pa'i ma rig pa, 12467-12469).

[12418-12469] [PHILOLOGY] Six Non-Recognition Types and Mind Taxonomy
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Enumerative structure: ma rig pa 'di lta ste (non-recognition is thus..., 12397) followed by dang linking six types; (2) Particle ste with definitions: rtsa ba sems kyi ma rig pa ni lhan cig skyes pa dngos yin te (root-mind non-recognition is co-emergent itself, 12407); (3) Dubitative construction: nga la ye shes kyi snang ba 'di byung ngam...nga'i snang ba 'di min nam snyam pa'i shes pa (did awareness-appearance arise from me...or is this appearance not mine?, 12409-12410); (4) Causative byung with ablative: de las nyon mongs pa'i tshogs dpag tu med pa byung (immeasurable affliction heaps arose from that, 12434); (5) Six minds enumerated with yid: ma rig pa dang mtshungs pa'i yid (mind associated with non-recognition), yid kyi rnam par shes pa (mind-consciousness), kun tu tshol ba'i yid (searching mind), gtan la 'bebs pa'i yid (settling mind), rnam par rags pa'i yid (coarse mind), nges par 'jog pa'i yid (determining mind, 12436-12442); (6) Ergative kyis with agency: yid drug 'dus nas ye shes kyi lam bsgribs pa (six minds having gathered, obscured wisdom-path, 12461).

[12418-12469] [CONTEXT] Sems sde Cosmogony and Yogācāra Psychology
The passage draws on: (1) Sems sde (Mind Series) Dzogchen cosmogonic narratives: Wish-Fulfilling Tree (dpag bsam gyi shing, 12418-12421) - cosmic tree of Buddha-youth-in-vase's blessing; cosmic egg (sgo nga, 12420) - warmth-moisture gestation; (2) Six minds derive from Yogācāra analysis: kliṣṭamanas (afflicted mind), manovijñāna (mind-consciousness), etc.; (3) *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra citation (12396-12405) provides textual authority; (4) Integration of Indian Buddhist psychology with Tibetan Dzogchen cosmogony; (5) Six minds' functions: associated-mind (root affliction), mind-consciousness (appropriating objects), searching-mind (pursuing objects), settling-mind (fixating), coarse-mind (violent afflictions), determining-mind (appropriating appearances as mine/other); (6) Unknown-delusion (ma shes rmongs pa'i ma rig pa, 12467): failing to recognize self-appearance as light, cycling repeatedly in saṃsāra (yang nas yang du 'khor bas na 'khor bar 'khor ba'o).

[12418-12469] [CONCEPT] Non-Recognition as Comprehensive Pattern
The philosophical framework: (1) Six modes comprehensively obscure wisdom across all dimensions: root (co-emergent failure), object (projecting world), basis (conditions producing individuation), subject (six minds creating duality), path (fabricated practice), result (failing to recognize appearance); (2) Root-mind non-recognition is lhan cig skyes pa dngos (co-emergent itself) - fundamental conceit (snyem byed) producing bdag tu rtog pa (self-grasping thought); (3) Six minds' functions: associated-mind combines with root affliction, mind-consciousness appropriates objects as "mine," searching-mind pursues objects, settling-mind fixates, coarse-mind produces violent afflictions, determining-mind appropriates as mine/other; (4) Fabricated-path non-recognition obscures wisdom through effort (yid kyis ye shes mi mthong, mind doesn't see wisdom, 12462); (5) Six minds gathering obscures wisdom-path (yid drug 'dus nas ye shes kyi lam bsgribs pa); (6) Unknown-delusion cycles endlessly because self-appearance not recognized as light; (7) These six cover root, object, basis, subject, path, result - non-recognition permeates all experience.
