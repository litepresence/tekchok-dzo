[00001-00029] [STRUCTURE] The Three Channels: Anatomical and Soteriological Architecture

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage establishes the triadic channel system (rtsa gsum) fundamental to Anuttarayogatantra physiology: ro ma (roma, left), rkyang ma (rkyangma, right), and kun 'dar ma (kundarima, central). The organizational structure follows a four-part presentation: (1) definition and placement, (2) distinctive purificatory functions, (3) symbolic indications (mtshon pa), and (4) embryological origination (skyed tshul). This quadripartite schema reflects standard Tibetan scholastic presentation formats.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Critical terminology: rtsa (channel/nāḍī), ro ma (left channel, associated with prajñā/wisdom), rkyang ma (right channel, associated with upāya/method), kun 'dar ma (central channel, associated with non-dual union). The term "kun 'dar ma" (Skt. avadhūtī) derives from the Apabhraṃśa/vernacular tantric traditions. The phrase "ma bcos don gyi gzhi" (unfabricated ground of reality) employs rdzogs chen terminology. "Smin 'jug" (ripening and entering) represents technical embryological terminology.

- **[CONTEXT]** The channel physiology presented here aligns with systems found in the Guhyasamājatantra, Cakrasaṃvara, and Kālacakra traditions, though interpreted through Nyingma rdzogs chen perspectives. The citation from Thal 'gyur (Thalgyur, likely referring to the *Thal bzang gi rgyud* or similar Atiyoga tantra) indicates integration of Great Perfection (rdzogs chen) and tantric soteriology. The four wheels ('khor lo bzhi) at navel, heart, throat, and crown correspond to standard tantric cakra systems.

- **[CONCEPT]** The section presents a sophisticated theory of embodiment wherein the three channels serve as the architectural foundation for soteriological transformation. The left channel (ro ma) purifies bodily actions through "corpse-like" (ro ma) dissolution of conceptual mindfulness; the right channel (rkyang ma) purifies speech through single-taste (nyag gcig) clarity; the central channel (kun 'dar ma) purifies mind through non-dual union of bliss-emptiness (bde stong zung 'jug). This tri-purification schema reflects the standard Buddhist tripartite division of body, speech, and mind. The embryological account provides a developmental narrative: channels originate from father's earth-water and mother's fire-wind elements, condensing at the navel as semen-blood drops (khu ba/khrag), demonstrating the interdependence of karma, elements, and consciousness.

- **[VARIANT]** No significant textual variants attested.
