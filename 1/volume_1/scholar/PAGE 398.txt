[16601-16609] [STRUCTURE] # Door Analysis (Continued)
**Analysis:** Longchenpa identifies the door (*sgo*) as arising from the center of the eye's clarity (*mig gi dngas ma'i dkyil las*). Generally, all four lamps appear; particularly, the Empty Bindu Lamp with self-light appears.

[16601-16609] [CONTEXT] Citation from the tantra:
"Sentient beings' eye not obscured by conditions / from the door called cakṣu / like the sun mandala / as self-light and rays / completely appearing as self-parts."

[16604-16605] [PHILOLOGY] The Sanskrit term *cakṣu* (eye) appears in Tibetan transliteration (*tsak+Shu*), indicating direct tantric transmission. The phrase *rkyen gyis ma bsgribs* (not obscured by conditions) establishes the unimpeded nature of primordial perception.

[16610-16618] [CONCEPT] Distribution of Lamps in the Eyes:
- Generally (*spyir*): from right eye — Far-Casting and Wisdom two
- From left eye — Bindu and Sphere two
- Brahma-aperture: awareness body in the manner of blazing lamp

This establishes a bilateral physiological correspondence with the four lamps.

[16613-16618] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*):
"The path of beings / is the door of the seer / that itself right two left two center / abides in the manner of blazing lamp."

[16619-16638] [STRUCTURE] # Nature Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa explains the nature (*rang bzhin*) of the Empty Bindu Lamp:
- Arises as empty bindu of spontaneous light-luminosity from first primordially pure nature
- Like water-moon (*chu zla*): reflective but without substantiality

[16621-16624] [CONTEXT] Citation from *dbang rnam par phye ba* (*Distinguishing Empowerment*):
"Ignorance darkness dispelling empty bindu / wonderful great appearance to objects of sense powers."

[16625-16638] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"From emptiness self-returning / in the appearance of clear experience / together with five primordial resounds / abiding through nature's flow / to the essence of clear agents / reverse-enter from things / not in emptiness / in the first of self-luminous knowing / as primordial self-characteristic / from first great primordial purity / nature itself is like this / by no one made, self-luminous / primordially itself is nature."

[16625-16638] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *Rang log* (self-returning): reflexive turning-back
- *Myong byed* (experience agent): cognitive function
- *Ye gdangs* (primordial resound): timeless vibration
- *Rang bzhin babs* (nature's flow): spontaneous descent/flow
- *Gsar byed* (clear agent): illuminating function
- *Log par zhugs* (reverse-enter): entering against the stream
- *Rang gsal shes pa* (self-luminous knowing): reflexive awareness

[16639-16646] [STRUCTURE] # Manner of Abiding from the Beginning
**Analysis:** Longchenpa distinguishes:
- Ground-time (*gzhi ka dag gi dus*): Four lamps exist in subtle inner clarity as spontaneous parts
- Ground-appearance arising (*gzhi snang du shar dus*): appearances arise as:
  - Five light rays of sphere
  - Body-parts in each bindu's light-house
  - Far-Casting as self-luminous light-ray connecting-cord
  - Wisdom arising as awareness — liberation-delusion merely as recognition/non-recognition

[16646] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *lus la gnas dus* (time of abiding in the body) serves as transitional marker to the next section.
