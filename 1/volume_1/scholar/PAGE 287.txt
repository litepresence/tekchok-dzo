[12001-12046] [STRUCTURE] Samantabhadra's Liberation Modes
The text transitions to the second major section: the modes of Samantabhadra's (Kuntu Zangpo) liberation. The structure presents three divisions: (1) liberation at the moment of perceiving basis-manifestation, (2) abiding in the expanse after liberation, (3) acting for others' benefit from that state. The first division details: (a) the original expanse (thog ma'i dbyings), (b) internal radiance externalizing (nang gdangs phyir shar), (c) the moment of non-recognition creating basis-manifestation, (d) turning attention outward toward manifestation, (e) the moment of recognizing one's own display, (f) instantaneous liberation through differentiation, (g) the six characteristics of Samantabhadra's awakening: transcending the basis, self-display, differentiation, liberation upon differentiation, not arising from other, self-abiding.

[12001-12046] [PHILOLOGY] Liberation Terminology
The passage employs specialized liberation terminology: grol ba (liberation), grol tshul (mode of liberation), grol sa (place/site of liberation). The phrase skad cig gis (in an instant) emphasizes immediate liberation. The term grol brtsings (claim/assert liberation) appears to critique premature claims. The compound bye brag phyed pa (differentiating particulars) describes the discriminative act leading to liberation. The particle tsam (merely/just) qualifies the moment of non-recognition as minimal yet consequential. The phrase rang las ma byung (not arising from other) denies causal origination.

[12001-12046] [CONTEXT] Tantra Citations: Thal 'gyur and Gongpa Dupa
The passage cites extensively from the Thal 'gyur (Prasāda) tantra and Gong pa bka' bgros (Mind Directives) corpus. These are major Atiyoga tantras providing source material for Dzogchen cosmogony. The verse from Sgyu 'phrul (Māyājāla) establishes the instantaneous liberation principle: differentiation in one instant, complete buddhahood in one instant. These citations establish canonical authority for the presentation of immediate recognition leading to liberation without gradual progression.

[12001-12046] [CONCEPT] Recognition as Liberation's Sole Condition
The conceptual framework establishes that liberation requires only recognition (rang ngo shes)—no other cause or condition. The six characteristics (chos drug) define Samantabhadra's awakening as: (1) transcending the basis (gzhi las 'phags pa)—not remaining in the ground's neutrality, (2) self-display as one's own (rang ngor snang ba)—recognizing manifestation as own display, (3) differentiation (bye brag phyed pa)—discriminating awareness from non-recognition, (4) liberation upon differentiation (phyed thog grol ba)—freedom concurrent with recognition, (5) not arising from other (gzhan las ma byung ba)—non-dependent origination, (6) self-abiding in own place (rang sar gnas pa)—resting in natural state. These characteristics establish that liberation is inherent (rang byung) and self-originated (rang las byung), not achieved through external causes or practices. The critique of "primordially liberated" (gzhi thog nas grol) as potentially misleading emphasizes that liberation occurs at the completion of lhundrub's ground, not in the ground itself as mere potentiality.
