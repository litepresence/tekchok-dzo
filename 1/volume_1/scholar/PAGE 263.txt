[10791-10799] [STRUCTURE] Eye-Mudra Analogy and Conventional-Ultimate Distinction
The section completes the dream analogy and introduces a second analogy—the eye-mudra (mig sngags)—followed by a systematic presentation of the two truths framework. The structure unfolds as: (1) eye-mudra analogy showing appearance without binding, (2) natural settling (rang sar bzhag) as effortless resolution, (3) the distinction between appearance aspect (snang ngo) as spontaneous presence and emptiness aspect (stong ngo) as primordial purity, (4) the non-duality of the two despite verbal designation, and (5) the monastic vows analogy establishing that non-contradictory attributes can inhere in a single essence.

[10791-10799] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terms of Liberation and Appearance
The phrase "mig sngags kyi nus pas" (by the power of eye-magic/mantra) refers to optical illusions created through mantra or meditative power. The term "snang tshod" (mere appearance, degree of appearance) qualifies the ontological status of manifestations. The compound "'bad med" (without effort) appears alongside "rang sar bzhag" (left in its own place), describing the Dzogchen approach to liberation. The phrase "ngang gis rang gnas" (naturally self-abiding) employs ngang (continuity, stream) to indicate unforced continuity. The term "grol grol po" emphasizes completed liberation with the redundant "po" suffix.

[10791-10799] [CONTEXT] Analogy of the Eye-Mudra in Buddhist Literature
The eye-mudra (mig sngags) analogy references the standard Buddhist example of optical illusions created through magical power—horses and cattle appearing to vision without substantial existence. This appears in Prajñāpāramitā literature (e.g., the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā) and Madhyamaka texts to illustrate the nature of conventional truth: appearing but empty. Longchenpa employs this to show that liberation occurs not through destroying appearances but through recognizing their empty nature. The "bu rde'ur log pa" (child turning to stone) analogy references the folkloric motif of petrification, here meaning appearances naturally dissolve without effort.

[10791-10799] [CONCEPT] Two Truths as Aspectual Distinction
The text presents a sophisticated analysis of the two truths (bden pa gnyis): appearance (snang ngo, saṃvṛti) corresponds to spontaneous presence (lhun grub) while emptiness (stong ngo, paramārtha) corresponds to primordial purity (ka dag). However—and this is crucial—these are not two different substances but dual aspects (rnam pa gnyis) of a single essence (ngo bo gcig). The phrase "tshig gis brjod pa tsam" (merely expressed in words) indicates that the distinction is epistemic/linguistic, not ontological. This parallels the prasaṅgika distinction between svātantra and prasaṅga approaches.

[10791-10799] [PHILOLOGY] Logic of Non-Contradiction
The argument employs formal logical terminology: "ldog pa tha dad bral" (free from distinct exclusions/reversals) refers to the logical category of "exclusion" (vyāvṛtti) used in Buddhist epistemology. The term "sdom ldan" (one possessing vows) and "rab tu byung ba" (fully ordained monk) establish that holding contradictory vows (like Vinaya and bodhisattva precepts) does not constitute logical contradiction when they inhere in a single subject. The particle "ze" in "bral ze yin pas" is a variant of "zhe" marking quotation or emphasis.

[10800-10829] [STRUCTURE] Scriptural Dialogue Format from Klong drug pa
The extended citation from Klong drug pa (Six Expanses) employs a structured dialogue format between the Teacher (ston pa, Buddha) and two interlocutors: Sempa Chen (sems dpa' che, likely a great bodhisattva) and another bodhisattva (byang chub sems dpa'). The architecture presents: (1) Buddha's initial statement establishing primordial purity and spontaneous presence (10802-10807); (2) Sempa Chen's first objection (10808-10811); (3) Buddha's response (10812-10814); (4) Second bodhisattva's objection (10815-10819); (5) Buddha's final response (10820-10828). This mimics the sūtra format of questions and answers between Buddha and śrāvakas/bodhisattvas.

[10800-10829] [PHILOLOGY] Dialogue Markers and Verbal Forms
The text employs standard dialogue markers: "gsol ba" (request, question) appears with "yang" (again) to indicate subsequent questioning. The phrase "mi rigs" (illogical, absurd) introduces objections. The particle "phyir" (because) provides causal justification. The phrase "ma 'gags rol par snang" (unceasingly appearing as play) employs 'gags pa (to cease, stop) with negative prefix. The term "dgos med" (without need, purposeless) raises the soteriological problem. The phrase "gnod pa" (harm, damage) appears in "tshig gis 'di la gnod pa bral" (free from harm by words), a technical term in epistemology indicating that linguistic designation does not affect ontological status.

[10800-10829] [CONTEXT] The Klong drug pa Tantra as Source
Klong drug pa (Six Expanses, Ṣaḍāyatana) is one of the Seventeen Tantras (rgyud bcu bdun) of the Upadeśa class in the Nyingma tradition, specifically associated with the instructional lineage of the Seventeen Tantras. These tantras present Dzogchen teachings in dialogue format between Samantabhadra (teacher) and Vajrasattva or other bodhisattvas (students). The use of this source establishes scriptural authority for Longchenpa's position. The objections raised mirror standard Madhyamaka objections to svātantrika positions.

[10800-10829] [CONCEPT] Buddha's Response: Beyond Linguistic Harm
The Buddha's response to the second objection presents a crucial Dzogchen epistemological position: words cannot harm (gnod pa) the nature of reality because: (1) the expressive words (brjod pa'i tshig) are absent—there is no inherently existing referent; (2) expressive sound (brjod pa'i sgra) is free from verbal designation—sounds do not inherently carry meaning; (3) therefore, no entity (ci yi ngo bo) is established; (4) the distinction between ultimate and conventional is merely nominal (tha snyad). This is a radical form of conventionalism: language does not touch reality because language itself is empty.

[10820-10828] [PHILOLOGY] Non-Cessation of Mental Operations
The phrase "dran bsam ma 'gags pas" (without the cessation of various recollections and thoughts) employs dran (memory, recollection) and bsam (thought, analysis), referring to the ordinary mental continuum. The term "bdag 'dzin" (self-grasping, ātmagrāha) identifies the root of saṃsāra. The phrase "blo yul" (object of mind/mentation) indicates conceptual cognition. The particle "phyir" appears in "tha snyad phyir," indicating that ultimate/conventional distinction is merely nominal—this anticipates Prāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka positions developed later.

[10820-10828] [CONTEXT] Conventionalism in Dzogchen Epistemology
The Buddha's response articulates a sophisticated epistemological conventionalism: distinctions between primordial purity and spontaneous presence are merely verbal (tshig), nominal (tha snyad), and do not affect the underlying reality. This parallels Śāntideva's position in the Bodhicaryāvatāra (IX.2) that ultimate truth is beyond all verbalization. However, Dzogchen takes this further: not only is ultimate truth beyond words, but conventional distinctions are entirely arbitrary with respect to the nature of mind (sems nyid).

[10820-10828] [CONCEPT] Semantic vs. Ontological Levels
The response distinguishes two levels: (1) the semantic level—where words designate apparent distinctions between ka dag and lhun grub; (2) the ontological level—where no such distinctions exist because both are equally unestablished (ma grub). The crucial move is recognizing that the apparent contradiction between primordial purity (which would deny saṃsāra) and spontaneous presence (which would deny practice) exists only at the linguistic level. At the level of reality, neither saṃsāra nor nirvāṇa is established, so no contradiction arises. This is the "Great Middle Way" (dbu ma chen po) of Dzogchen.

[10830-10831] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Peerless Ground Section
The lines mark a major structural transition with the formula "don gnyis pa" (second topic/meaning) introducing the explanation of the peerless ground (bla na med pa'i gzhi) specifically (bye brag tu). The phrase "la gsum ste" (divided into three) anticipates the tripartite structure to follow. The immediate subsection heading "thun mong du mdor bstan" (common/condensed presentation) indicates that the initial presentation will be general before moving to specific analysis. This follows the standard śāstra format of general-to-specific presentation.

[10830-10831] [PHILOLOGY] Structural Markers
The term "bla na med pa" (peerless, unsurpassed, anuttara) qualifies the ground, distinguishing it from lower grounds or paths. The compound "bye brag tu" (specifically, particularly, viśeṣatas) indicates the mode of explanation. The phrase "thun mong" (common, general, sādhāraṇa) contrasts with specific (bye brag). The term "mdor bstan" (condensed presentation, piṇḍārtha) indicates summary form. These structural markers demonstrate Longchenpa's systematic approach, organizing material according to logical progression from general to specific.

[10830-10831] [CONTEXT] Peerless Ground in Dzogchen Doxography
The peerless ground (bla na med pa'i gzhi) represents the culmination of the ground (gzhi) taxonomy in Longchenpa's system. Earlier sections presented the seven grounds or various categorizations; this section presents the ground that transcends all categorization—hence "peerless." The term "bla na med pa" echoes the standard Mahāyāna designation "anuttara samyak saṃbodhi" (unsurpassed perfect enlightenment), indicating that this ground is not subordinate to any higher realization. This section likely addresses the ground of Samantabhadra or the dharmakāya itself.

[10830-10831] [CONCEPT] General vs. Specific Presentations
The methodological distinction between general/common (thun mong) and specific (bye brag) presentations follows Indian śāstra conventions. The general presentation establishes fundamental principles accessible to all practitioners; the specific presentation addresses particular contexts, exceptions, or advanced understandings. In Dzogchen, this often corresponds to: (1) general presentation of ground as basis for all beings; (2) specific presentation of ground as realized by buddhas; (3) specific presentation of ground as unrecognized by deluded beings. This tripartite structure ensures comprehensive coverage of the topic.
