[1001-1010] [STRUCTURE] # Time Perfection: The Teaching's Duration
**Analysis:** The temporal dimension includes:

**Teaching phases:**
1. **First turning** (*dang po'i chos 'khor*) — at Vārāṇasī, Deer Park
2. **Middle period** (*bar gyi dus*) — extensive teaching throughout India
3. **Final phase** (*mtha' ma*) — last instructions before parinirvāṇa

**Duration:**
- Śākyamuni's lifespan: (*tshe lo brgya pa*) 100 years (or 80 in other accounts)
- Teaching duration: (*lo stong*) 1,000 years of flourishing
- Degenerate age: (*snyigs ma'i dus*) 2,500 years of decline

The current era is considered the latter part of the degenerate age when the Dharma exists in form but beings' capacities are diminished.

[1011-1020] [CONCEPT] # The Five Perfections as Maṇḍala
**Analysis:** The five perfections map onto the five-Buddha maṇḍala:

| Perfection | Buddha | Direction | Quality |
|------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Field | Vairocana | Center | Dharmadhātu wisdom |
| Teacher | Akṣobhya | East | Mirror wisdom |
| Retinue | Ratnasaṃbhava | South | Equality wisdom |
| Teaching | Amitābha | West | Discrimination wisdom |
| Time | Amoghasiddhi | North | All-accomplishing wisdom |

This integration demonstrates that the historical teaching is not separate from the cosmic maṇḍala structure—it is the maṇḍala manifesting in time and space.

[1021-1030] [CONTEXT] # The First Turning of the Dharma-Wheel
**Analysis:** The initial teaching at Deer Park (*ri dwags 'dab*) included:

**Setting:**
- **Place:** Ṛṣipatana (*drang srong lhung ba*), near Vārāṇasī
- **Retinue:** Five companions (*lnga sde*) — the first monks
- **Time:** Full moon of Āṣāḍha (*sa ga zla ba*)

**Content:**
- **Four Noble Truths** (*'phags pa'i bden pa bzhi*):
  1. Suffering (*sdug bsngal*)
  2. Origin (*kun 'byung*)
  3. Cessation (*'gog pa*)
  4. Path (*lam*)

- **Eightfold Path** (*'phags lam yan lag brgyad*):
  Right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration

[1031-1040] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *chos 'khor*
**Analysis:** The term (*chos 'khor*) "Dharma-wheel" combines:
- *chos* = Dharma, truth, phenomena
- *'khor* = wheel, circle, turn

The wheel imagery suggests:
- **Motion:** Teaching spreads in all directions
- **Cycles:** Continuous turning through time
- **Weapon:** Crushing the wheel of samsara
- **Sovereignty:** The wheel (*cakra*) as symbol of universal rule

The verb (*bskor ba*) "turned" uses the causative form, indicating the Buddha actively set the wheel in motion.

[1041-1050] [STRUCTURE] # The Middle Period Teachings
**Analysis:** Between the first and final turnings:

**Major locations:**
- **Rājagṛha** (*rgyal po'i khab*) — residence in the Bamboo Grove
- **Vaiśālī** (*yangs pa can*) — important city in Vṛji
- **Kauśāmbī** — on the Yamunā river
- **Śrāvastī** (*mnyan yod*) — Jetavana monastery
- **Vārāṇasī** — repeated visits

**Key disciples:**
- **Śāriputra** (*shA ri'i bu*) — foremost in wisdom
- **Maudgalyāyana** (*mo'u 'gal gyi bu*) — foremost in psychic powers
- **Ānanda** (*kun dga' bo*) — personal attendant
- **Mahākāśyapa** (*'od srung chen po*) — head of the saṅgha after Buddha

[1051-1060] [CONTEXT] # The Final Turning and Parinirvāṇa
**Analysis:** The last phase:

**Final teaching:**
- **Place:** Vaishali (*yang pa can*) — final rains retreat
- **Meal:** Cunda's (*skul dha*) pork (*sho ga*) or mushroom dish
- **Illness:** Severe pain (*na ba shin tu gzir ba*)

**Parinirvāṇa:**
- **Place:** Kuśinagara (*rtswa mchog grong*)
- **Tree:** Śāla trees (*sa la*)
- **Position:** Right side (*gyas phyogs*), head north (*byang*), face west (*nub*)
- **Last words:** "All conditioned phenomena are impermanent. Strive diligently!" (*'du byed thams cad mi rtag pa'o| 'bad pa nyid kyis so|*)

[1061-1070] [CONCEPT] # The Teaching's Continuation
**Analysis:** After parinirvāṇa:

**Three councils:**
1. **Rājagṛha** (*rgyal po'i khab*) — First Council, compiled teachings
2. **Vaiśālī** — Second Council, settled disputes
3. **Kaśmīra** — Third Council, different accounts

**Transmission to Tibet:**
- **7th century:** Emperor Songtsen Gampo (*srong btsan sgam po*)
- **8th century:** Trisong Detsen (*khri srong lde btsan*) and Padmasambhava
- **11th century:** Later diffusion (*phyi dar*) with Atiśa

The Nyingma lineage (*snyan rgyud*) traces through these transmissions to the present.

[1071-1080] [STRUCTURE] # Summary and Transition
**Analysis:** Longchenpa concludes the presentation of our world's five perfections and transitions to:

**Next topics:**
1. Detailed explanation of the pure lands (*zhing khams*)
2. The nature of the container (*snod*) and contained (*bcud*)
3. How sentient beings arise and evolve
4. The specific characteristics of the six realms

This systematic presentation establishes the cosmological and soteriological framework within which the Dzogchen teaching manifests.
