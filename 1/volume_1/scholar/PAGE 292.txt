[12205-12226] [STRUCTURE] Non-Recognition Delusion of Sentient Beings
The text transitions to the third major topic: the delusion mode ('khrul tshul) of sentient beings through non-recognition (ma rig pa). The structure presents: (1) the original basis without delusion, (2) delusion arising when basis-manifestation appears without self-recognition, (3) the neutral awareness (lung ma bstan pa) with root in awareness that individuates basis-manifestation, (4) sentient being delusion through division. The passage establishes the cosmogonic error theory: delusion is not inherent in the basis but arises through the failure to recognize basis-manifestation as self-display.

[12205-12226] [PHILOLOGY] Delusion and Non-Recognition Terminology
The passage employs specialized terminology for delusion: 'khrul tshul (mode of delusion), ma rig pa (non-recognition, avidyā), lung ma bstan pa (neutral/unpredicted). The phrase rang ngo ma rig pa (not recognizing one's own face) describes the fundamental error. The term ris su bcad pa (dividing/categorizing) indicates the individuation process. The compound 'khrul gzhi (basis of delusion) identifies the ground for error. The particle kyis (by) indicates the agency of non-recognition.

[12205-12226] [CONTEXT] Mu tig 'phreng ba and Bhrānti Theory
The passage cites from the Mu tig 'phreng ba (Pearl Garland) and integrates bhrānti (delusion/error) theory from Indian pramāṇa traditions. The analysis of delusion as non-recognition reflects the standard Dzogchen cosmogony found in the Sems sde (Mind Series) texts. The metaphor of clouds obscuring space (sprin gyis bsgrib) derives from standard Buddhist imagery adapted to Dzogchen purposes.

[12205-12226] [CONCEPT] Delusion as Failure of Self-Recognition
The conceptual framework establishes delusion as a failure of self-recognition, not as an inherent property of the basis. The basis (gzhi) is without delusion; delusion arises only when basis-manifestation (gzhi snang) appears and is not recognized as one's own display. The neutral awareness (lung ma bstan pa) is the moment of potential recognition that fails to recognize—neither fully deluded nor fully enlightened, it is the pivot point where delusion crystallizes. This framework preserves the purity of the basis while accounting for the appearance of delusion through the dynamics of recognition and non-recognition.
