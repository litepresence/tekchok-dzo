[12154-12192] [STRUCTURE] Buddha-Activity Without Departure and Uttara Tantra Integration
This section completes the *Rang shar* citation (12154-12164) and presents: (1) correlation with *Thig le gsang skor* (Secret Cycle of Spheres, 12165-12166), (2) third division: acting for others' benefit (de las gzhan don mdzad pa, 12167-12173), (3) integration with *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttara Tantra/Mahāyānottaratantraśāstra, 12174-12192). The activity section: from expanse's primordial purity not moving (dbyings ka dag chen po chos kyi sku'i zhing de las ma g.yos), manifestation from lhungrub's door according to beings' perceptions (lhun grub kyi sgo las sems can gyi snang tshul dang bstun nas), light and kāya-expression producing saṃbhogakāya display (lhun grub kyi 'od dang sku'i rtsal las longs sku'i snang ba bkod), Brahmā's aeon of creation (tshangs chen gyi bskal pa bkod), nature-emanation and impure-saṃsāra door producing teachers appropriate to beings' locations (rang bzhin sprul sku'i snang ba dang ma dag pa 'khor ba'i sgo las...ston pa sems can gyi gnas ris khyab par bstan), emptying saṃsāra through teaching ('khor ba stongs par mdzad). The *Uttara Tantra* citation (12175-12192) presents nine characteristics of buddhahood.

[12154-12192] [PHILOLOGY] Activity Syntax and Uttara Tantra Verse Structure
Key grammatical constructions: (1) The continuative bzhin du with negation: ma g.yos bzhin du (not moving yet, 12168) - activity without departure; (2) The instrumental las with source: lhun grub kyi sgo las (from lhungrub's door, 12169); (3) The causative bkod (to arrange/create) with display: longs sku'i snang ba bkod (arranging saṃbhogakāya display, 12170); (4) The terminative par with verbs of action: stongs par mdzad (causes to empty, 12173); (5) The *Uttara Tantra* citation employs ablative-instrumental parallelism: 'dus ma byas shing (unconditioned), lhun gyis grub (spontaneously present), gzhan gyi rkyen gyi rtogs min (not realized through others' conditions); (6) The comitative dang ldan (endowed with): mkhyen dang brtse dang nus par ldan (endowed with wisdom, compassion, power); (7) The causal phyir: rtogs phyir mkhyen (knowing for realization), lam ston phyir na thugs rtse ba (compassionate for showing path), sdug bsngal nyon mongs spong phyir (for abandoning suffering and afflictions); (8) The enumerative: dang po gsum gyis rang don/phyis ma gsum gyis gzhan don (first three for self-benefit, latter three for others' benefit, 12190-12191).

[12154-12192] [CONTEXT] Tathāgatagarbha Theory in Dzogchen and Activity Without Movement
The passage integrates: (1) *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra's jewel metaphors (12137-12164) complete with seventeen comparisons, establishing spontaneous presence; (2) *Thig le gsang skor* correlation (12165-12166) links these teachings to the Secret Cycle literature; (3) Buddha-activity theory: from primordial purity's expanse, non-moving yet manifesting for beings - classic Mahāyāna "non-abiding nirvāṇa" (apratiṣṭhita-nirvāṇa) reformulated in Dzogchen terms; (4) Three-kāya activity: dharmakāya as basis, saṃbhogakāya as lhungrub's display, nirmāṇakāya as appropriate manifestation; (5) *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttara Tantra) of Maitreya/Asaṅga, primary Indian śāstra on tathāgatagarbha, provides nine characteristics: (1-3) nature itself (unconditioned, spontaneous, self-realized), (4-7) functions/qualities (wisdom, compassion, power, two benefits), (8) temporality (no beginning/middle/end), (9) peacefulness (with dharmakāya); (6) Self-realization without teacher (rang nyid slob dpon med par rang byung gi ye shes) reflects Dzogchen's emphasis on self-recognition.

[12154-12192] [CONCEPT] Self-Awakened Teacher Teaching Self-Awakened Nature and Non-Dual Activity
The philosophical framework: (1) Buddha-activity occurs without movement from kādag (primordial purity) - the paradox of complete rest and complete engagement as mutually enabling, not contradictory; (2) From lhungrub's door, manifestation accords with beings' perceptions (sems can gyi snang tshul dang bstun nas) - skillful means adapting to capacities without losing essence; (3) Saṃbhogakāya display arranged from light and kāya-expression (lhun grub kyi 'od dang sku'i rtsal las) - spontaneous, not deliberately created; (4) Nature-emanation and impure-saṃsāra door produce teachers for all beings' realms - manifestation includes both pure and impure as aspects of single display; (5) *Uttara Tantra* integration: buddha-nature is unconditioned ('dus ma byas) and spontaneously present (lhun grub) - not created by practice; (6) Realization is self-arisen (rang byung), not through others' conditions (gzhan gyi rkyen gyi rtogs min); (7) First three characteristics accomplish self-benefit (rang don), next three accomplish others' benefit (gzhan don); (8) Samantabhadra as teacher (ston pa kun tu bzang po) dwells without beginning/end (thog ma dang ma tha med par bzhugs) with complete sovereignty (mnga' dbang rdzogs pa) - simultaneously transcendent and immanent.
