[STRUCTURE] Objects of the Four Lamps: General and Specific Dimensions
This page systematically presents the objects (ཡུལ་) of the four lamps, organizing them hierarchically into general (སྤྱི་) and specific (བྱེ་བྲག་) categories. The structure follows: (1) general object—cloudless sky, dharmatā radiance, expanding luminosity (19744-19759); (2) specific objects—four subdivisions for each lamp (19760-19782). This taxonomic approach reflects the Tibetan scholastic tradition of exhaustive classification (རྣམ་གཞག་), while the content maintains Dzogchen's emphasis on direct, non-conceptual recognition. The page transitions from outer phenomena (sky) through inner nature (dharmatā) to the perceptual process itself (how awareness appears).

[PHILOLOGY] Spatial and Perceptual Terminology
Critical spatial metaphors: སྤྲིན་བྲལ་ཕྱི་ཡུལ་ (outer object of cloudlessness) evokes the classic Dzogchen meditation on cloudless sky as symbol of mind-nature. ནང་ཆོས་ཉིད་རང་དངས་ (inner dharmatā self-radiance) uses རང་དངས་ (self-clear/self-radiant) rather than འོད་གསལ་ (luminosity)—emphasizing spontaneous clarity without external light-source. བར་འཕེལ་སྣང་འོད་གསལ་ (intermediate expanding appearance-luminosity) introduces the "between" (བར་) dimension—neither purely outer nor inner. The term སྒོ་མི་འགུལ་བ་ (unmoving gate) describes stable gaze technique; གཟིགས་སྟངས་གཅུན་པ་ (controlled/held gaze posture) indicates physical intervention. དེ་ཁོ་ན་ཉིད་ཅོག་བཞག་གི་ལྟ་བ་ (view of thusness in resting meditation) combines ultimate nature with specific technique.

[CONTEXT] Scriptural Citations on the Eye-Gateway
The page cites Thal 'gyur on yul gnad (object's vital point): "cloudless outer object empty, yogin dwelling in sky-path"—establishing the sky-gazing tradition. The Nor bu 'phra bkod citation (19772) states: rigs kyi bu rig pa'i de kho na nyid mig gi de bzhin nyid cog bzhag gi lta ba shes na chos thams cad kyi spyi dang shes par 'gyur—"knowing the eye's thusness as the view of resting meditation, one knows the general/expansive aspects of all dharmas." The Yul bar ma citation (19774) reinforces: mig gi de bzhin nyid shes na chos thams cad kyi mdo dang rgyas par shes par 'gyur—knowing eye's thusness knows all dharmas' condensed and expanded aspects. These establish the eye as master-gateway (སྒོ་ཆེན་) to gnosis.

[CONCEPT] The Gnoseology of Visual Perception
This section constructs a sophisticated phenomenology of vision as direct gnoseological access. The "vajra chain" (རྡོ་རྗེ་ལུ་གུ་རྒྱུད་) appearing through stable gaze reveals the three kayā as indivisible from awareness itself. The transformation (བསྒྱུར་) of 'khrul snang (deluded appearance) into 'od gsal (luminosity) occurs not through conceptual analysis but through direct visual encounter with thusness. The cloudless sky metaphor encodes: (1) unobstructed nature of mind (no conceptual clouds), (2) clarity as natural condition (not achieved), (3) spaciousness as non-localized awareness (not bound to head or body). This is mngon sum (direct perception) in Dzogchen epistemology—transcending the inferential reasoning of lower vehicles.

[STRUCTURE] Specific Objects of the Four Lamps
The rgyang zhags lamp's object: 'od snang gi stong gzugs (empty form of light-appearance), the lu gu rgyud (vajra chain) held with sgo mi 'gul ba (unmoving gate), establishing rig pa without 'phro 'du (dispersion/gathering). The shes rab lamp's object: tshig don (word and meaning), using rtogs pa'i gdeng (confidence of understanding) to cut through. The thig le lamp's object: snang ba'i 'phel tshad (measure of appearance-expansion)—sixfold classification at 'od lnga'i mu khyud (perimeter of five lights). The dbyings lamp's object: 'od lnga'i rang gdangs (self-radiance of five lights)—empty, clear, sgrib bral (free from obscuration), gdangs phyin (radiance-complete). This quadripartite structure mirrors the fourfold maṇḍala of Dzogchen cosmology.

[PHILOLOGY] Enumerative Particles and Technical Compounds
The enumerative structure uses དྲུག་པ་དང༌་ (sixth), གསུམ་དང༌་ (three), གཉིས་དང༌་ (two) for taxonomic division. ལ་སོགས་པ་ indicates abbreviation. བསྡོམས་པས་དྲུག་ shows synthetic categorization—six through combination of elements. ཡང་ནམ་མཁའ་ཀློང་བསལ་ལས་ introduces variant enumeration. Technical compounds: འོད་ལྔའི་མུ་ཁྱུད་ (perimeter of five lights), ཕྱེད་སྐུ་ (half-kayā—transitional form), དོན་དམ་གྱི་འབྱུང་ལྔ་དག་པ་ (pure five ultimate elements), བག་རྡུལ་དེངས་པའི་ནམ་མཁའ་ (sky free of dust/particles). The particle ཅིའི་ཕྱིར་ཞེ་ན་ (why? because) introduces explanatory reasoning (gtan tshigs).

[CONCEPT] The Vajra Chain (Rdo rje lu gu rgyud)
The lu gu rgyud is the luminous thread appearing in stabilized vision—a chain of interlinked bindus (thig le) that seems to move or rotate. This is not optical illusion but the natural display (རང་སྣང་) of awareness when fixation relaxes. The chain links individual moments of clarity into continuous recognition. Holding it with stable gaze (སྒོ་མི་འགུལ་བ་) means neither following nor rejecting—allowing spontaneous self-liberation (རང་གྲོལ་). The chain reveals that appearance is not chaotic but patterned, not random but meaningful. Each link in the chain is a complete maṇḍala—containing within it all five families, all five wisdoms, all kayā and jñāna. This is the "secret" (གསང་) nature of vision: ordinary seeing obscures it, pure seeing reveals it.

[STRUCTURE] The Eye as Master-Gateway (Mig gi sgo chen)
The text establishes the eye (མིག་) as the master-gateway because: (1) it is the locus where external phenomena (ཕྱི་སྣང་) and internal awareness (ནང་རིག་) intersect; (2) it naturally displays the five lights when gaze stabilizes; (3) it reveals the indivisibility of the three kayā (sku gsum du 'bral med); (4) it transforms delusion into luminosity without conceptual intervention. The "eye's thusness" (མིག་གི་དེ་བཞིན་ཉིད་) is not the physical organ but the perceptual process itself—the meeting-point of subject, object, and awareness. This is why knowing the eye's thusness knows all dharmas: the eye is the microcosm containing the macrocosm, the portal through which the entire universe appears.
