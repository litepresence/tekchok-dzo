[14414-14450] [STRUCTURE] Four Lamps Introduction
The text introduces the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) of thödgal practice. The structure establishes: (1) far-reaching water lamp (rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma), (2) empty thigle lamp (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma), (3) pure realm lamp (dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma), and (4) self-arising wisdom lamp (shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma).

[14414-14450] [PHILOLOGY] Lamp Terminology
The term sgron ma (lamp/light) describes visionary appearances in thödgal. The compound rgyang zhags (far-reaching lasso) refers to the water lamp's function. The phrase thig le stong pa (empty thigle) identifies the second lamp.

[14414-14450] [CONTEXT] Thödgal Vision System
The text presents the four lamps as the foundation of thödgal visionary experience. Each lamp represents a different aspect of natural light manifestation. This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on direct perception of natural luminosity.

[14414-14450] [CONCEPT] Lamps as Natural Light
The text conceptualizes the four lamps as natural manifestations of awareness's luminosity. They are not created through effort but recognized through relaxation. The lamps appear spontaneously when conditions are present.
