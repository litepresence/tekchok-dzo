[15075-15111] [STRUCTURE] Fifty Wisdom Channels Detailed
The text presents the detailed enumeration of fifty wisdom channels. The structure establishes: (1) ten channels for each of the five wisdoms, (2) specific channels for dharmadhātu, mirror-like, equality, discriminating, and all-accomplishing wisdoms.

[15075-15111] [PHILOLOGY] Wisdom Channel Terminology
The term chos dbyings ye shes bcu (ten dharmadhātu wisdoms) identifies specific channels. The compound me long ye shes (mirror-like wisdom) establishes another group. The phrase mnyam nyid ye shes (equality wisdom) identifies the third wisdom.

[15075-15111] [CONTEXT] Five Wisdom System
The text presents the five wisdom system as embodied in channels. Each wisdom is not merely conceptual but has physical correlates. This reflects the Buddhist understanding that enlightenment is complete transformation of body, speech, and mind.

[15075-15111] [CONCEPT] Wisdom as Channel Purification
The text conceptualizes wisdom as the natural state of purified channels. The five wisdoms are not achievements but recognitions. When channels are pure, wisdoms shine naturally; they are the luminosity of pure channels.
