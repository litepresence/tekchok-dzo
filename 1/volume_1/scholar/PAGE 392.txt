[16293-16295] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *ma brtags na* (if not examined):
The conditional *na* with the negative *ma* creates a hypothetical epistemic frame: the binding appears real to non-analytical cognition. The particle *las* following *snang ba* in 16294 and 16295 is ablative: "from the time of appearing bound/liberated" — indicating temporal origination rather than simple cessation.

[16293-16295] [CONCEPT] The Paradox of Liberation:
Longchenpa presents a dialectical structure:
1. When unexamined, mind and appearance appear as binding self-awareness
2. When appearing bound, there is no binding (appearance ≠ existence)
3. When appearing liberated, there is no liberating agent (no inherent nature)
4. Therefore, liberation does not exist as a thing

This parallels the Prasaṅgika analysis of bondage and liberation as mere dependent designations.

[16296-16302] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgyu 'phrul* (Illusion/Māyā) tantra:
The quoted verse employs the double-negation structure typical of Nyingma *thod rgal* literature: "Not bound, binding does not exist" (*sus yang ma bcings bcings med de*). The phrase *ye nas lhun rdzogs* (primordially spontaneously complete) grounds the soteriological claim in the Dzogchen view of original buddhahood (*ye nas sangs rgyas*).

[16303-16305] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *yas su mi 'jug pa* (not entering into vastness):
The term *yas* (vast) derives from *yas pa* (expanse/scope), with the negative *mi* indicating non-appropriation. The instrumental *kyis* in *'ching bas* establishes the binding function: "by means of the binding [of what does not enter into vastness]."

The term *rlan* (moisten) in 16304 functions metaphorically — the water element moistens through the bliss of samādhi (*ting nge 'dzin*), indicating that "water" refers to the non-attachment that "waters" the mind rather than a literal aqueous substance.

[16306-16309] [CONCEPT] The Fourfold Naming (*ming bzhi*) of the Lamp:
Longchenpa establishes four etymological justifications (*nges tshig*):

1. **Chu** (Water): Non-attachment returns to its own place; the samādhi-bliss moistens
2. **Chu**: Relies on gathered clarity (*dngas ma 'dus pa*)
3. **Ma** (Mother): Not the base of producing appearances of space-awareness
4. **Ma**: The clear sense powers serve as the supporting base for viewing

The negative *ma yin* in 16308 is emphatic: "is definitively not" — excluding the mistaken view that appearances arise from the base.

[16310-16343] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Blazing Lamp Tantra*):
The tantric citation provides etymological glosses (*nges pa'i tshig*) for each component:

**Rgyang** (Distance):
- Holds distant continuums of form-appearance
- Gathers colors, etc.
- The awareness-body (*rig pa'i sku*) also [appears] from far distance
- Makes the seer hold [appearances]
- From the side of samsara-thought, casts far — thus "far"
- Likewise from the side of non-realization, casts nirvana — thus "far"

**Zhags** (Snare):
- From samsara's appearance-aspects: forms and the five desire-objects are bound by this — thus "snare"
- The appearance of the sense-power holding memory and thought as self by this — "snare" holds from a distance
- Likewise in the sky free of clouds: awareness appearing as selfless body, not entering into the vast appearance — holding by this is called "snare"

**Chu** (Water):
- When attachment returns to its own place in these appearances
- When there is no mind of attachment to all
- When appearances are left in their own place
- Through freedom from self-grasping — called "water"

**Sgron** (Lamp):
- All self-appearances increasing above from above
- Lamp through the clarity of awareness' pristine wisdom
- All appearances of coarse elements
- Self-knowing experience not ceasing
- Lamp through clarity at the self-door of the sense-power
- Setting awareness in outer space
- Inner space pure in its own place
- Appearances

This extended citation demonstrates the tantric basis for Longchenpa's hermeneutical framework.

[16342-16343] [PHILOLOGY] The construction *phyi yi dbyings bzhag pas* (having set [awareness] in outer space) employs the perfective *bzhag* with the instrumental *pas*, indicating a completed action that results in the purification of inner space.
