[299-302] [PHILOLOGY] Completion of the Secret Mind Activities
**Analysis:** The final four secret mind-activities complete the 36-fold structure:
1. *phyag rgya zil gyis gnon pa* — mudrā's subjugation/overwhelming (transcendent gesture)
2. *'bar chen mnyam pa* — great-blaze equality (radiant equanimity)
3. *chos nyid sna tshogs pa* — diversity of dharmatā (nature's variety)
4. *rnam par bkod pa rang snang rol pa* — self-appearing spontaneous adornment play

The samādhi-name (*ting nge 'dzin*) explicitly identifies these as meditative absorptions, distinguishing them from ordinary mental states.

[303-304] [CONCEPT] Activity Without Agent
**Analysis:** The crucial distinction is made between "meaning's agent activity" (*don byed kyi mdzad pa*) and true enlightened activity. The instrumental particle *kyis* in line 304 indicates instrumentality: activity is designated (*bya'o*) through/by means of (*gyur pas*) "qualities' essence and radiance" (*yon tan gyi ngo bo dang rtsal*). This establishes the Dzogchen view that activity is not intentional action but the spontaneous display (*rtsal*) of inherent qualities.

[305-308] [STRUCTURE] # The Saṃbhogakāya Mandala Architecture
**Analysis:** The text describes the generation of the Saṃbhogakāya field through:
1. **Source:** Unobstructed radiance (*rtsal*) of former appearance and compassion
2. **Teacher:** Complete manifestation (*rnam par snang mdzad*) great-ocean equal-expanse
3. **Gesture:** Lotus-pericarp from thumb (*phyag mthil nas padma'i sdong po*)
4. **Structure:** Thirty-two layered realms (*nyi shu rtsa lnga* = 25, plus additional layers making 32)

The simile "colors and forms like water and moon" (*chu zla 'dra ba*) refers to the *udaka-candra* (water-moon) analogy in Yogācāra: appearances are vivid and functional yet empty of inherent existence, like a moon reflected in water.

[309-316] [CONCEPT] Fractal Buddha-Field Architecture
**Analysis:** The text presents multiple overlapping structural metaphors:

1. **Layered masses like palaces** (*rgyal po'i pho brang bkod pa lta bu*)—hierarchical celestial architecture
2. **Offering-feast descent** (*g.yon 'og gis mchod pa'i gur khyim*)—tent-pavilion arrangements
3. **Jewel-umbrella layers** (*rin po che'i gdugs bkod pa*)—parasol cosmology
4. **Grain-pile masses** (*'bru tshogs bkod pa*)—abundant harvest imagery

The sixteen-sixteen fields (*bchu drug bcu drug*) refers to the 256 (16×16) palace configuration standard in *Guhyasamāja* maṇḍala architecture. The phrase "not as layered masses" (*brtsigs ma ma yin*) distinguishes some configurations from hierarchical arrangements.

[316] [PHILOLOGY] The Particle *yang* as Enumerative Marker
**Analysis:** The repeated use of *yang* (also/furthermore/moreover) in lines 309, 311, 315, and 316 functions as an enumerative particle, indicating the continuation and proliferation of the mandala structure. This rhetorical device emphasizes the inexhaustible (*mi zad pa*) nature of the display.

[317-322] [STRUCTURE] # Summary of Saṃbhogakāya Teaching Dimension
**Analysis:** The text summarizes the Saṃbhogakāya realm's characteristics:
- **Teaching nature:** Actual/real (*dngos*), not provisional
- **Speech:** Self-arisen syllables (*rang byung gi yi ge*), uncreated
- **Temporal mode:** Unchanging dharmatā (*mi 'gyur chos nyid*)
- **Activity source:** Thirty-six self-radiating (*rang gdangs*) activities
- **Body function:** Appearing without self-nature (*rang bzhin med pa*), thereby purifying obscurations

The transition from the general description to specific "four outer activities" of the body begins the detailed enumeration that will continue in subsequent pages.
