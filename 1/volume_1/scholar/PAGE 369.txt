[15223-15259] [STRUCTURE] Forehead Wheel and Eye Channels
The text presents the forehead wheel (dpral ba'i dkyil 'khor) and the channels of the eyes. The structure establishes: (1) channels radiating from the forehead center, (2) right and left eye channels, and (3) their connection to the four lamps.

[15223-15259] [PHILOLOGY] Forehead Wheel Terminology
The term dpral ba'i dkyil 'khor (forehead wheel) identifies the ājñā chakra. The compound mig gi phugs (eye sockets) describes the eye centers. The phrase tsakṣu lta byed (eye seer) establishes the connection to vision.

[15223-15259] [CONTEXT] Vision and Channels
The text presents the eye channels as the physical basis for visionary experience. The forehead wheel is the center where the four lamps manifest most clearly. This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on vision as the path.

[15223-15259] [CONCEPT] Vision as Channel Radiance
The text conceptualizes visionary experience as the radiance of purified channels. The four lamps appear when the eye and forehead channels are clear. Vision is not hallucination but the natural light of awareness made visible.
