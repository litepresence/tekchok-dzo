[17850-17856] [CONCEPT] The gzhi-byed-lam-byed-'bras-bu-byed function of rig pa
**Analysis:** Longchenpa demonstrates that rig pa serves as ground (gzhi), path (lam), and fruition ('bras bu), contrasting with the opponent's position that sems serves these functions. This triadic structure mirrors the three-kaya framework but is here applied to gnoseology.

[17857-17866] [PHILOLOGY] Dialogue structure analysis
**Analysis:** The passage continues the question-answer format from the previous page:
- ci phyir (why/because) - causal interrogative
- de la dris lan 'di ltar bya (to that, answer should be made thus) - formulaic response marker
- The suffix 'o marks assertions as quotations or established truths

[17867-17869] [STRUCTURE] # RIM_KHANG: Expanded explanation of individual natures
**Analysis:** This initiates the second major division of the section on distinguishing sems and ye shes. The structure marker gnyis te indicates two subsections:
1. Detailed explanation of sems and ye shes natures
2. [to follow] Their individual meanings

[17870-17879] [CONTEXT] Citation from Thal 'gyur (Thalpa Tantra)
**Analysis:** The Thal 'gyur (Gradual/Consequence Tantra) provides the framework for analyzing sems and ye shes through four categories:
- ngo bo (essence)
- nges tshig (definition)
- dbye ba (divisions)
- so so'i don (individual meaning)
This mirrors abhidharma analytical methodology but applies it to Dzogchen categories.

[17880-17889] [CONCEPT] The fourfold analysis of sems
**Analysis:** Longchenpa analyzes sems (mind) according to the four categories:
1. **Essence (ngo bo):** Recognition arising as subject-object, pervaded by non-awareness
2. **Definition (nges tshig):** That which cognizes subject and object as such
3. **Divisions (dbye ba):** Pure and impure
4. **Individual meaning:** To be determined subsequently
The analysis includes reference to samadhi-one-pointedness (ting nge 'dzin rtse gcig), showing awareness of yogacara categories.

[17890-17901] [CONTEXT] Citation from Sgra gcan 'dzin gyi yul la bstod pa
**Analysis:** The citation from the Praise to the Object of Rahula's Grasping establishes sems nyid dag pa (pure mind-itself) as:
- smra bsam brjod med (ineffable, inexpressible)
- shes rab pha rol phyin (perfection of wisdom)
- ma skyes mi 'gag (unborn, unceasing)
- nam mkha'i ngo bo (space-nature)
- so so rang gi ye shes (individual self-arising wisdom)

[17902] [STRUCTURE] Transition to sems dag pa
**Analysis:** This line initiates the discussion of sems dag pa (pure mind), distinguishing it from sems nyid dag pa (pure mind-itself). The former refers to path-level purifications; the latter to primordial purity.
