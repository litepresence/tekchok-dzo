[1-4] [STRUCTURE] # TITLE PAGE: Sanskrit and Tibetan Titling Protocol
**Analysis:** The text opens with a dual-title structure typical of classical Tibetan scholastic works. Lines 1-4 establish the Sanskrit title in Siddham script (yānāgraratnakośanāmavajrāhāraṃ), followed by the Tibetan rendering (theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod). This follows the *chos 'byung* (dharma history) convention of asserting Indic authenticity while grounding the text in Tibetan translation tradition. The title itself encodes the core thesis: this is a *kośa* (treasury/storehouse) of the *yānāgra* (supreme vehicle), positioning the work within the *mdzod* genre established by Vasubandhu's *Abhidharmakośa*.

[11-15] [CONTEXT] # The Fivefold Homage Structure
**Analysis:** Longchenpa's homage (*phyag 'tshal*) follows the *rigs lnga* (five families) mandala structure:
1. **Samantabhadra** (*kun tu bzang po*) - Dharmakaya root
2. **Five families' regent** (*rgyal tshab rigs lnga*) - Sambhogakaya dimension  
3. **Great Ocean Teacher** (*gang chen mtsho*) - Nirmāṇakāya manifestation
4. **Five vidyādharas** (*rig 'dzin rnam lnga*) - Aural lineage holders
5. **Three worlds' ornament** ('*jig rten gsum gyi rgyan*) - The maṇḍala complete

This structure maps onto the standard Nyingma *gsol 'debs* (supplication) architecture, establishing the text's place within the *snyan brgyud* (aural/whispered lineage).

[12] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *phun sum tshogs lnga*
**Analysis:** The "five perfections" (*phun sum tshogs lnga*) refers to the fivefold completeness of the Sambhogakāya dimension: perfect teacher, place, retinue, teaching, and time. The particle *mnga'* (possessive) connects Samantabhadra's nature (*rang bzhin*) to these perfections, establishing the hermeneutic that the entire path is already complete in the ground.

[16-19] [CONCEPT] The Primordial Purity Paradigm
**Analysis:** The homage to the "primordially pure" (*gdod nas rnam dag*) establishes the gzhi (ground) as:
- **Untouched by elaborations** (*spros kun zhi ba*) - Prasaṅgika-style negation of extremes
- **Uncompounded** (*'dus ma byas*) - Not produced by causes/conditions
- **Spontaneously accomplished** (*lhun gyis grub*) - Self-arising, requiring no effort

The seven horses (*rta bdun*) metaphor references the sun's chariot, indicating that the three kayas and their qualities shine forth naturally without dependency on extrinsic causes.

[20-27] [STRUCTURE] # Introduction of the Supreme Vehicle
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes the *theg mchog* (supreme vehicle) hierarchy:
1. **General vehicles** (*theg pa*) - Causal vehicles of sūtra and lower tantra
2. **Secret mantra** (*gsang sngags*) - Result vehicles of anuttara tantra
3. **Atiyoga** (*rdzogs pa chen po*) - The pinnacle transcending both

This tri-partite structure (*phyi nang gsang gsum*) mirrors the organizational logic found in the *Nyingma Gyübum*.

[28-35] [CONTEXT] # The Three Kāya Classification
**Analysis:** Lines 28-35 present the standard *sku gsum* (three bodies) doctrine as classification (*rnam par gzhag pa*) based on:
- **Teacher** (*ston pa*) - The Buddha as source
- **Place** (*gnas*) - The realm/configuration
- **Teaching** (*bstan pa*) - The Dharma expressed

This triad reflects the *Chandragomin*-style grammatical analysis (*sum rtags*) applied to buddhological categories.

[34-35] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *gnas phun sum tshogs*
**Analysis:** The phrase "perfect place" (*gnas phun sum tshogs*) with *chos nyid 'od gsal gyi gzhi* (ground of dharmatā luminosity) uses the genitive particle *gyi* to indicate identity: the ground IS luminous dharmatā. This is crucial—Longchenpa is not saying the ground "has" luminosity, but that they are non-dual (*gcig*).
