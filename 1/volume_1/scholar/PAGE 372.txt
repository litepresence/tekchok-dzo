[15334-15370] [STRUCTURE] Channel Pulse and Life Span Calculation
The text presents the calculation of life span through channel pulse (rtsa'i 'gyu tshad). The structure establishes: (1) daily channel movements numbering 64,800, (2) analysis of strong and weak pulses for determining illness and lifespan, and (3) elemental imbalances.

[15334-15370] [PHILOLOGY] Pulse Terminology
The term rtsa'i 'gyu tshad (channel movement measure) identifies diagnostic technique. The compound 'phar ba drag zhan (strong and weak jumping) describes pulse qualities. The phrase nad dang gdön (illness and spirits) establishes diagnostic categories.

[15334-15370] [CONTEXT] Tibetan Medical Divination
The text integrates channel knowledge with life span calculation. Pulse diagnosis reveals not only illness but karmic lifespan. This reflects the Tibetan integration of medicine, astrology, and spiritual practice.

[15334-15370] [CONCEPT] Life as Channel Movement
The text conceptualizes life itself as channel movement. When channels move, there is life; when they stop, there is death. Understanding channel movement allows understanding of life and death, and ultimately transcendence of both.
