[00001-00007] [STRUCTURE] Verse Conclusion on Individual Wind Functions
**Analysis:** The passage presents a five-line verse (tshigs su bcad pa) from root scripture enumerating the individualized functions of winds based on karmic differentiation. The structure follows a gaṇacakra pattern: so so'i las (individual karma), las dang ye shes (karma and wisdom), nyon mongs/rtog med (afflictions/non-conceptuality), so so'i grangs/tshad (individual numbers/measures), and sgom pa po'i rnam par sbyar (yogi's analysis). The concluding line/des ni so so'i rlung tshad zin/ indicates mastery of individual wind measures as the soteriological objective.

[00008-00012] [CONTEXT] Threefold Structure of the Wind Chapter
**Analysis:** This passage outlines the three-part structure (gsum ste) for determining the meaning of the foregoing scriptural citation: (1) spyir bstan pa—general presentation of definite movement locations; (2) bye brag tu bshad pa—particular explanation of definite transference ('pho ba) locations; (3) mjug bsdu ba—concluding summary through determination of ye shes/las rlung (wisdom/karma winds). This triadic structure mirrors traditional Tibetan scholastic presentation styles (bsdus don), moving from general to specific to synthesized conclusion.

[00013-00021] [STRUCTURE] Two-fold Wind Movement Classification
**Analysis:** This section establishes the fundamental wind classification: che ba (major) and chung ba (minor), corresponding to phyi 'gyu ba (outer movements) and nang 'gyu ba (inner movements). The text specifies that in a healthy person (skyes bu dar la bab pa nad med pa), the outer winds number 21,600 per day (nyin zhag phrug gcig). The term phrug indicates a complete day-night cycle. The inner winds, excluding the nose channels (kha sna ma gtogs pa), function as supports for conceptual consciousness (rtog pa) and wisdom consciousness (ye shes), numbering 112,600 through the 'phar rtsa (pulsing channels).

[00021-00027] [PHILOLOGY] Gender-based Wind Classification
**Analysis:** The text establishes a tripartite gender classification of winds: (1) pho rlung—male wind moving through the right nostril (sna bug g.yas); (2) mo rlung—female wind moving through the left nostril (g.yon); (3) ma ning gi rlung—neuter wind with equal movement (cha mnyam). The technical phrase 'byung ba lnga'i rlung sems nges pas indicates that through determining the five-element winds and mind, one can correlate with the four time transference points (dus bzhi'i 'pho dus). The prescription that men train primarily in female wind, women in male wind, and both in neuter wind reflects the tantric principle of balancing polar energies for wisdom wind cultivation.

[00028-00044] [CONCEPT] Nine Crucial Points of Wind Yoga
**Analysis:** This passage enumerates nine gnad (crucial points/pith instructions) for wind practice derived from three modalities: gyen rgyu (upward movement), thur sel (downward elimination), and mnyam gnas (balanced abiding). The nine techniques are: (1) steng rlung mnan pa—pressing upper winds; (2) 'og rlung bsdu ba—gathering lower winds; (3) bar rlung bskyil ba—holding middle winds; (4) mda' ltar 'phang ba—shooting like an arrow; (5) lcags kyu ltar dgug pa—hooking like an iron hook; (6) bum pa can du bskyil ba—holding like a vase; (7) chu srin chings su bsdams pa—binding like a crocodile knot; (8) ri bo ltar mnan pa—pressing like a mountain; (9) sbubs mchu ltar bsdu ba—gathering like a beak-cavity. These techniques represent a comprehensive subtle body manipulation system for wind control.

[00041-00044] [CONTEXT] Concluding Practice Instructions
**Analysis:** The passage concludes with four additional instructions: (1) rtsa gnas su dgram pa—arranging at the channel abode; (2) rang gnas su gzhil ba—releasing in natural abode; (3) nam mkha' ltar chos nyid du la bzla ba—reversing into dharmatā like space; (4) dgus nyams su blang bar bya'o—cultivating through the nine [techniques]. The progression moves from deliberate placement through natural release to ultimate reversal, following the rDzogs chen trajectory of effort-to-effortlessness.
