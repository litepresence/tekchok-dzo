[9308-9326] [STRUCTURE] Four-Fold Divisions of the Four Stages

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage presents a complex 4×4 matrix: the four stages (devotion, engagement, transformation, decisive cutting) each have four subdivisions (devotion, engagement, transformation, decisive cutting), creating sixteen permutations. These are then correlated with empowerment sounds and the thirty-two major marks.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *mos pa'i mos pa dad pas nges pa* (devotion-within-devotion: faith certainty), *mos pa'i 'jug pa snying rjes nges pa* (devotion's engagement: compassion certainty), *mos pa'i bsgyur ba thabs kyis zin pa* (devotion's transformation: method-possessed), *mos pa'i chod pa shes bar gyis don chod pa* (devotion's decisive cutting: knowledge decisive cutting), *zhi gnas la mos pa* (devotion to calm abiding), *lhag mthong la 'jug pa* (engagement in special insight), *mnyam gzhag gi rtog pa tha dad du bsgyur ba* (transformation of equipoise thought into difference), *rjes shes kyi 'gyu ba chod pa* (decisive cutting of post-knowledge movement), *gos kyi zhen pa grol ba* (liberation from clothing attachment), *zas kyi zhen pa grol ba* (liberation from food attachment), *rmi lam 'od gsal du grol ba* (liberation of dream into light clarity), *bag chags dang nyon mong grol ba* (liberation from latencies and afflictions), *spyod pas 'khor ba la mi gnas pa* (non-abiding in samsara through conduct), *bsgoms pas bsam gtan la gnas pa* (abiding in samadhi through meditation), *lta bas 'khrul snang la mi gnas par khams gsum sku gsum du bsgyur ba* (non-abiding in delusion-appearance through view, transforming three realms into three bodies), *'bras bu 'khor 'das gnyis dus gcig la chod pa* (decisive cutting of two samsara-nirvana at one time as fruition).

- **[CONCEPT]** 
  **Devotion's Four:**
  1. Faith certainty
  2. Compassion engagement certainty
  3. Method-possessed transformation
  4. Knowledge decisive cutting
  
  **Engagement's Four:**
  1. Devotion to calm abiding
  2. Engagement in special insight
  3. Transformation of equipoise thought
  4. Decisive cutting of post-knowledge movement
  
  **Transformation's Four:**
  1. Liberation from clothing attachment
  2. Liberation from food attachment
  3. Liberation of dream into light clarity
  4. Liberation from latencies and afflictions
  
  **Decisive Cutting's Four:**
  1. Non-abiding in samsara through conduct
  2. Abiding in samadhi through meditation
  3. Non-abiding in delusion through view
  4. Decisive cutting of samsara-nirvana at one time
  
  **Correlation:** The sixteen plus sixteen empowerment sounds = thirty-two; sixteen grounds with wisdom abiding, birth, obtainment, arising (4 each) = 64 = Vajradhara's supreme completion.

[9327-9343] [STRUCTURE] Knowledge Holder's Four Grounds: Detailed Analysis

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage introduces the four Knowledge Holder grounds (*rig 'dzin gyi sa bzhi*) with their subdivisions: (1) yoga ground, (2) great yoga ground, (3) discriminating yoga ground, (4) realization yoga ground. Each has controlled/uncontrolled and other divisions, totaling eight; further divided into four each = sixteen.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *dbang bzhi'i 'jug pa rjes su dran pa* (remembering the four empowerments' engagement), *rnal 'byor gyi sa* (yoga ground), *rnal 'byor chen po'i sa* (great yoga ground), *'byed pa'i rnal 'byor gyi sa* (discriminating yoga ground), *rtogs pa'i rnal 'byor gyi sa* (realization yoga ground), *dbang du bsgyur ba dang ma bsgyur ba* (controlled and uncontrolled), *shin tu rnal 'byor gyi sa* (extremely yoga ground), *rang sa nges pa'i rnal 'byor gyi sa* (own ground definite yoga ground), *spros pa'i rnal 'byor gyi sa* (elaboration yoga ground), *bya bral rdzogs pa'i rnal 'byor gyi sa* (deed-free complete yoga ground), *brda'i sa* (symbol ground), *don gyi sa* (meaning ground), *brda don dbyer med kyi sa* (non-dual symbol-meaning ground), *ma 'dres pa'i sa* (unmixed ground), *rdzu 'phrul 'phrul pa'i sa* (siddhi transformation ground), *khyad par rtogs pa'i sa* (distinction realization ground), *mngon par 'byung ba'i sa* (manifestation ground), *dpa' bo rigs 'byed kyi sa* (hero family-discriminating ground).

- **[CONCEPT]** 
  **Four Knowledge Holder Grounds:**
  1. **Yoga Ground:** Has yoga, action yoga, conduct yoga, transformation yoga (4)
  2. **Great Yoga Ground:** Has extremely yoga, own ground definite, elaboration, deed-free complete (4)
  3. **Discriminating Yoga Ground:** Has symbol, meaning, non-dual, unmixed (4)
  4. **Realization Yoga Ground:** Has transformation, distinction realization, manifestation, hero family-discriminating (4)
  
  **Total:** 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = sixteen grounds.

- **[CONTEXT]** This establishes the systematic subdivision of Knowledge Holder attainments, demonstrating the progressive refinement from coarse yoga to subtle realization.
