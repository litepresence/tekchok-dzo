[11945-12000] [STRUCTURE] Dissolution Modes (thim tshul) Established
The text presents the third subsection: establishing the modes of dissolution into the primordial basis. The structure presents: (1) the dissolution of great appearances back into the basis regardless of recognition, (2) the analogy of crystal light internalizing, (3) the dream analogy of one dream dissolving as another arises, (4) the non-departure principle—dissolution is return to basis, not departure elsewhere, (5) eight modes of dissolution corresponding to eight qualities, (6) detailed verse presentation of the eight dissolution modes: compassion dissolving into compassion, self-light into self-light, color-form self-grasping dissolving, appearance mandala dissolving, wisdom into wisdom, wisdom display dissolving into face, kāya into kāya, non-duality dissolving duality, liberation-from-extremes dissolving extremes, impure door dissolving into pure nature.

[11945-12000] [PHILOLOGY] Dissolution Terminology
The passage employs specialized dissolution terminology: thim (dissolve/absorb), yal (dissipate/resolve), log (return/reverse), 'gags (cease). The phrase ye gdangs nang du log pa (return of primordial radiance within) describes the essential process. The compound ma bzhag thob pa (obtaining without placing) characterizes spontaneous realization. The term 'dus byas (conditioned/compounded) appears negated (mya ngan 'das—passed beyond) to indicate transcendence. The phrase mi 'byed chen po'i klong (expanse of great non-division) describes the result. The particle bzhin du (like/as) introduces multiple analogies.

[11945-12000] [CONTEXT] Ratnaketu Tantra Citations
The passage extensively cites from the Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud (Ratnaketu Tantra), a major source for Dzogchen teachings on dissolution modes. The eight dissolution modes mirror the eight qualities and manifestation modes, establishing a complete hermeneutical system. The analogies—sun rays, rainbow in space, child entering womb, snow lion—derive from standard Indian and Tibetan poetic repertoires adapted to Dzogchen purposes.

[11945-12000] [CONCEPT] Self-Dissolution as Self-Recognition
The conceptual framework establishes that dissolution is not a process of destruction but of self-recognition—appearances recognizing themselves as the basis. The phrase rang gi ngo bo rang thim pas (self-essence self-dissolving) emphasizes this reflexive nature. Each mode of dissolution represents a specific aspect of appearance recognizing its inseparability from the basis: compassion recognizes compassion, light recognizes light, form recognizes emptiness, wisdom recognizes wisdom. The non-departure principle (gzhan du song ba med) establishes that nothing actually moves or changes location; the dissolution is a shift in recognition, not a spatial transition. This framework resolves the apparent contradiction between appearance's vivid display and its empty nature—both are true simultaneously, and dissolution is the recognition of this simultaneity.
