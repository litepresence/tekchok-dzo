[00001-00013] [CONCEPT] Wisdom Functions and Their Results
**Analysis:** This passage elaborates the functional outcomes of wisdom wind: ground-abiding wisdom establishes that however appearances arise, they cannot alter from atop gnas lugs (abiding mode/ground condition). Characteristic-holding wisdom produces recognition of individual rigs (families), sku (bodies), ye shes (wisdoms), 'od (lights), and kha dog (colors) without possibility of transition ('da' mi srid). Wisdom gathering through knowables produces unobstructed benefit for self and others. Wisdom gathering through consciousness produces diverse worldly and transcendent knowing without self/other grasping. These four correspond to the gzhi lam 'bras gsum (ground, path, result) framework—four at cause, four at path as ultimate elements, four at result as four bodies.

[00013-00020] [STRUCTURE] Twelvefold Buddha Activity Correlation
**Analysis:** The passage establishes that through considering ground, path, and result, the twelve aspects (bcu gnyis) explain the rgyu mtshan (cause/condition) for sangs rgyas kyi mdzad pa bcu gnyis (twelve Buddha activities) to occur. This numerological correspondence—four wisdoms × three stages = twelve activities—demonstrates the systematic integration of subtle body physiology with hagiographical classification. The bcu gnyis reference likely indicates the twelve great deeds of the Buddha (bdud bzhi 'dul ba, lha bab, chos 'khor, etc.).

[00020-00029] [PHILOLOGY] Karma Wind Functions: Four-fold Enumeration
**Analysis:** The passage enumerates four functions of las kyi rlung: (1) g.yas nas rgyu bas pho—rightward movement produces male [offpring]; (2) g.yon nas rgyu bas mo—leftward movement produces female; (3) phyir 'ong bas—outward return produces diverse appearance engagement; (4) nang du 'gengs pas—internal filling produces diverse conceptual proliferation. These correspond to pha dang ma'i dbang (father-mother dominance) and 'gro 'ong gi dbang (movement dominance). The outward movement produces nyin mo'i snang ba (daytime appearance); inward movement produces mtshan mo'i snang ba (nighttime appearance).

[00029-00029] [CONTEXT] Multiplication to Twenty-four Aspects
**Analysis:** The text notes that counting the four functions as pairs (gnyis gnyis su bgrangs) yields eight; counting by partial aspects (cha shas kyis bgrangs) yields twenty-four (nyi shu rtsa bzhi). This numerological elaboration demonstrates the analytical sophistication of the tradition—systematically deriving subcategories through combinatorial logic. The twelve 'gyus pa'i byed las (contracted functions) of las rlung produce twelve external years, twelve internal months, twelve secret periods.
