[9643-9671] [STRUCTURE] Liberation Superknowledges and Body-Speech-Mind Activities

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage enumerates superknowledges arising from liberation (*rnam grol*) and deity identity (*lha ngo*), organized in sets of six: (1) liberation superknowledges (30 total), (2) body-speech-mind activity superknowledges (30 total), (3) reality-view superknowledges (30 total). Each set of six corresponds to exhaustion of outflows (*zag pa zad pa*) in body, speech, mind, sems, wisdom-aggregate, and dharma-dharmatā.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *sems dang sems byung nub pa* (mind and mental-factors subside), *rnam grol dang po'i mthong ba rnam par dag pa'i mngon shes drug* (six clairvoyances of purified view of first liberation), *lus kyi zag pa zad pa* (exhaustion of body's outflow), *ngag gi zag pa* (speech's outflow), *yid kyi zag pa* (mind's outflow), *sems kyi zag pa* (sems's outflow), *shes rab kyi phung po la sgrib pa'i zag pa* (outflow of obscuration at wisdom-aggregate), *chos dang chos nyid kyi zag pa* (dharma and dharmatā outflow), *phyi nang gsang ba yongs rdzogs kyi dbang* (outer-inner-secret complete empowerment), *sku gsung thugs kyi las* (body-speech-mind activity), *sangs rgyas kyi mkhyen pa ma lus pa rdzogs pa* (complete Buddha knowledge without remainder).

- **[CONCEPT]** The structure presents liberation as progressive exhaustion of outflows (*zag pa zad pa*) through six stages: body (form) → speech (sound) → mind → sems (dualistic mind) → wisdom-aggregate → dharma/dharmatā. Each liberation produces six superknowledges, totaling 30 from the complete empowerment. The body-speech-mind activities manifest as: (1) body actual—seeing all Buddha bodies, (2) body appearance—engaging endless light-masses, (3) speech actual—engaging sixty speech-sounds, (4) speech appearance—engaging various sound-melodies, (5) mind actual—engaging all samadhis, (6) mind appearance—engaging knowing others' minds. These 30 arise from knowing the 32 deity identities.

[9661-9671] [CONTEXT] Reality-View Superknowledges and Mind Transformation

**Analysis:**
- **[CONTEXT]** Citation of reality-view (*chos nyid kyi mthong ba*) superknowledges: six arise at the time when dharmatā's intention abides without distinction. These focus on mind-transformation (*sems rnam par gdul ba*).

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *chos nyid kyi dgongs pa la dbyer mi phyed par bzhugs* (abide without distinction in dharmatā's intention), *sems rnam par gdul ba'i mngon shes* (clairvoyance of mind thoroughly trained), *sems kyi rang bzhin shes* (know mind's nature), *sems sbyang ba* (training mind), *rts ba shes* (know root), *sems zhi ba* (pacifying mind), *sems med pa'i mtshan nyid* (characteristic of mindless), *sems rnam par dag pa* (purifying mind), *mi 'gyur bar shes* (know unchanging), *sems mi ldog pa* (non-reversing mind), *khams gsum ming med par shes* (know three realms nameless), *sems las 'das pa* (transcending mind), *shes byed dang 'du 'phro dag* (pure knower and aggregate-emanation), *dbang gi rnam par 'phrul pa'i dbye ba* (transformation distinctions of empowerment).

- **[CONCEPT]** The six reality-view superknowledges map the progression of mind-transformation: (1) knowing mind's nature, (2) knowing root through training mind, (3) knowing mindlessness through pacifying mind, (4) knowing unchanging through purifying mind, (5) knowing three realms nameless through non-reversing mind, (6) realizing pure knower and aggregate-emanation without reversal through transcending mind. These 30 superknowledges (6 × 5 sets) arise from knowing the transformation distinctions of empowerment.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Line 9670: *mthong ba dag pa'i mngon shes brgya brgyad cu ni mos pa'i mthong ba tsam las byung ba'o*—"The 180 clairvoyances of purified view arise from merely the view of devotion/faith." This establishes that even these advanced realizations depend on initial devotional commitment.

[9671] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Elaboration-With Empowerments

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Line 9671 introduces the next subdivision: *de yang phye na mos pa'i bzhi bcu rtsa lnga lnga'i yon tan 'byung ba ni*—"That also, if divided, the forty-fivefold devotion, five-by-five qualities arising."

- **[CONCEPT]** This marks the transition to detailed analysis of how the 180 clairvoyances subdivide into 45 categories with five qualities each, which will be explained in the following passage (continuing on page 240).
