[20422-20423] [STRUCTURE] Sealing Statement: Esoteric Restrictions

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Sealing statement (*rgya chings*) restricting the circulation of these teachings. The classic formulation prohibits promulgation in the ten directions to all beings, establishing the esoteric nature of the instructions.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *legs par khong du chud* (well understand/internalize), *rgyud la nyams su blang* (practice in continuity), *phyogs bcu* (ten directions), *thams cad la bsgrags* (proclaim to all), *bshad pa'i gnas ma yin* (not a place for explanation).

- **[CONTEXT]** Esoteric restrictions (*gdams ngag sba chings*) are standard in Vajrayana and Dzogchen literature. The apparent contradiction—writing down restricted teachings—reflects the tension between preservation and restriction. The restriction applies to *indiscriminate* teaching; qualified recipients may receive instruction through proper transmission (*lung* and *man ngag*).

[20424-20426] [CONTEXT] Colophon: Section Completion

**Analysis:**
- **[CONTEXT]** Standard colophon formula marking the end of the fourteenth section (*rim khang bcu bzhi pa*) and identifying the source text: *Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod* (Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle). The double shad (*//*) marks textual closure.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod las* (from the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle), *brten pa shes pa'i gnas rnam par gzhag pa* (the presentation of the place of dependent knowing), *rim khang bcu bzhi pa* (the fourteenth section).

- **[STRUCTURE]** This colophon completes the fourteenth major structural division of the text. The section title *brten pa shes pa'i gnas rnam par gzhag pa* (presentation of the place of dependent knowing) encapsulates the content: establishing the ontological and epistemological ground (*gnas*) upon which dependent knowing (*brten pa shes pa*) operates.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants noted. The colophon follows standard Longchenpa conventions with source identification and section enumeration.
