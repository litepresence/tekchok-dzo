[12639-12684] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom Synthesis and Conclusion
The text presents a comprehensive synthesis of self-arisen wisdom. The structure summarizes: (1) wisdom as primordially present awareness, (2) wisdom's distinction from mind, (3) wisdom as the ground of liberation, and (4) the path of recognizing wisdom as the essence of Great Perfection.

[12639-12660] [PHILOLOGY] Synthesis Terminology
The term don bsdu ba (summarizing meaning) introduces the synthesis. The phrase "ye shes kyi rnam grangs" (exposition/analysis of wisdom) identifies the topic. The compound rdzogs pa chen po (Great Perfection) provides the tradition's name. The term gnad (key point, crucial instruction) emphasizes practical application.

[12661-12684] [CONTEXT] Section Completion
The synthesis marks the completion of the extended self-arisen wisdom section. This section has covered: wisdom's nature, its distinction from mind, its five characteristics, its relationship to appearance, practice, daily life, and buddhahood. The comprehensive treatment establishes wisdom as the central concept of Dzogchen.

[12639-12684] [CONCEPT] Wisdom as Dzogchen Essence
The synthesis conceptualizes self-arisen wisdom as the essence of Dzogchen—the single concept that encompasses the entire path. Recognition of wisdom is the path; resting in wisdom is the practice; realizing wisdom is the result. The simplicity yet profundity of this formulation distinguishes Dzogchen from more complex path structures.
