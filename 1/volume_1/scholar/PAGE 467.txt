[00001-00050] [CONTEXT] Deviations and Direct Perception: Pedagogical Safeguards

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage addresses potential deviations (gol sa) in practice and establishes criteria for non-deviating meditation. The organization: (1) defining non-deviating abiding, (2) nine characteristics of correct meditation, (3) recognition of deviations, (4) spontaneous arising and liberation, (5) result as great self-perfected primordial attainment. The passage integrates technical phenomenology with pedagogical warnings.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: ma gol gnas pa (non-deviating abiding), yid kyi rtog par ma 'gyus (not disturbed by mental thought), ris can gsal ba ma yin (not clarity with form/attribute), gud bcad stong par ma song (not empty with separation), bde ba rgyun chags ma yin (not continuous bliss), btang snyoms ltengs por ma song (not apathetic indifference), dran rigs gsal ba ngal so (resting in mindful awareness-clarity), sbyang ba log chal ma song (not perverse refinement), 'dzin cha nang du 'gyu bde (pleasant internal movement of grasping). The term "thal 'gyur" (Thalgyur) refers to the *Thal ba rang grol gyi rgyud* or similar Atiyoga text.

- **[CONTEXT]** The enumeration of nine characteristics reflects standard Tibetan pedagogical formats. The *Thal 'gyur* citation establishes that liberation occurs when appearances arise and are immediately self-liberated without antidotes or remedies (spang gnyen). This reflects the rdzogs chen doctrine of "self-liberation" (rang grol) as distinct from path-based gradualism. The "Lion Perfection of Power" (*Seng ge rtsal rdzogs*) citation emphasizes that rdzogs chen conduct is without obstruction ('gag med) and integrates non-attachment, self-liberation, and primordial perfection.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents sophisticated phenomenological diagnostics for correct meditation: it should be (1) undisturbed by mental thought, (2) without attribute-clarity, (3) without separation-emptiness, (4) without continuous bliss, (5) without indifferent equanimity, (6) resting in awareness-clarity, (7) without perverse refinement, (8) with internal movement, (9) with clear mode-grasping. Deviations occur when appearances become conceptualized or when meditation falls into extremes. The "spontaneously arising" (thal byung) and "spontaneously liberated" (thal grol) formulation indicates the rdzogschen ideal of immediate recognition without gradual cultivation.

- **[VARIANT]** No manuscript variants attested.
