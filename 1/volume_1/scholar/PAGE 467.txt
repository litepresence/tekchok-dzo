[19878-19901] [CONTEXT] Cessation to Original Purity: The Thal 'gyur Citation on Support-Object Distinction

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Extended citation from *Thal 'gyur* elaborating the distinction between support and object with specific outcomes for each lamp.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *chos nyid zad pa* (nature exhausted), *ka dag gi la gshegs* (proceed to original purity), *rtan yul khyad par* (support-object distinction), *gsum gyi byed 'dus* (three's function gathering), *skyon med bya byed* (faultless actor-action), *chos nyid ma spyod* (not manipulate nature), *las dang bag chags dag byed* (purify karma and latencies), *'khor ba dong sprugs* (churn samsara), *myang 'das mtshams su reg nus* (able to touch nirvana-juncture), *rtog dpyod zad pa'i sems nyid* (mind itself with exhausted investigation), *'khor ba rgyang du 'phangs* (throw samsara far away).

- **[CONCEPT]** The citation presents the distinctive functions:
  1. Threefold gathering of functions shown as distinction.
  2. Far-cast support: abandons faultless actor-actions; does not manipulate nature; purifies karma and latencies; familiarization with direct nature appearance churns samsara; able to touch cessation-nirvana juncture.
  3. Exhausted investigation: throws samsara far away; seeing pure wisdom body destroys samsara-nirvana two's hope-fear.
  4. Seeing beautiful flower: resembles nature's lasso; awareness placed on balance conveys to exhaustion-ground.
  5. Familiarization with expanse: makes delusion-appearance empty; seeing pure nature object brings forth fixation-object from source.

[19902-19926] [STRUCTURE] The Channel-Root Residence: Fourfold Practice Integration

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Synthesis: seeing four lamps' meaning through familiarization causes body-wisdom appearances to fill space. These arise from inner resonance of channels.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *goms pa* (familiarization), *sku dang ye shes kyi snang ba* (body and wisdom appearances), *nam mkha' gang ba* (fill space), *nang gdangs* (inner resonance), *rtsa ba nang bzhugs* (channel-root inner-residing), *nor bu 'phra bkod* (Jewel Subtle Array), *rig pa'i gnas lugs* (awareness's natural condition), *thugs kyi dkyil* (heart center), *yab yum gnyis kyi cha 'dzin* (holding father's and mother's parts), *thabs dang shes rab* (means and wisdom), *lhun rdzogs thig le chen po* (spontaneously complete great sphere).

- **[CONTEXT]** Citation from *Nor bu 'phra bkod*: E ma ho! Awareness's natural condition resides in one's own heart center; holding father-mother's parts as means and wisdom; father's part holding is means-body; mother's part holding is wisdom-body; light and light-ray manner reside; expanse and awareness thoroughly adorn; spontaneously complete great sphere resides.

- **[CONCEPT]** The channel-root residence (*rtsa ba nang bzhugs*):
  - Channels inside: spheres reside like bodies.
  - Large measure: equal to sky's limit.
  - Small measure: like horse-hoof split (very small).
  - Clear measure: like sun-moon mandala.
  - Also: clear brilliant glory; going, coming, abiding; without action going-coming; self-complete at complete ground.
