[16647-16655] [STRUCTURE] # Body Abiding Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa describes the subtle physiology of bindu manifestation:
- From inside heart to eye: light-root makes path to appearance
- This bindu: in heart as five-light palace, round rim of five, abiding self-essence
- Distant-noose in lamp clearly
- Between-essence (*bar gdangs*) in sky: five-light round gather, slight trembling
- Lamp itself outwardly appearing: from that expanding self-essence immeasurable arise
- From heart-center inner bindu included: actual lamp, clear lamp
- Abiding at the door of non-abiding in the gatherer
- Like bird flocks: nature clear

[16647-16655] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *Snying nang* (inside heart): subtle anatomical location
- *'Od rtsa* (light-root): energetic basis for luminosity
- *'Od lnga'i pho brang* (five-light palace): visionary structure
- *Mu khyud lnga* (five rims): boundary markers
- *Rang gdangs* (self-essence): intrinsic luminosity
- *Bar gdangs* (between-essence): intermediate manifestation
- *'Gul phrig* (trembling): subtle movement
- *Shas chung* (small portion): minute degree

[16653] [CONCEPT] The paradox "abiding at the door of non-abiding" (*tshang na mi gnas sgor gnas pa*) reflects the Dzogchen principle that true abiding is non-abiding — the bindu manifests precisely at the point where fixation is released.

[16656-16664] [STRUCTURE] # Object-Appearance Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa addresses the question: To what object does [the bindu] appear?

- Appears as self-essence light with pure intermediate-space
- Citation from tantra: "Intermediate-space itself is emptiness / appearance not ceasing self-face / self-arisen great bindu abides / unexpressable self-abide essence / primordially appears in sky element."

[16659-16664] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *bar snang nyid ni stong pa la* (intermediate-space itself is to emptiness) employs the emphatic *nyid* to stress identity: intermediate-space IS emptiness, not merely like or related to it.

[16665-16673] [STRUCTURE] # Measure Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa defines the measure (*tshad*) of actual lamp:
- Space-awareness appearing without day-night
- Through this: liberation measure of samsara into nirvana

[16667-16673] [CONTEXT] Citation from tantra:
"Without bindu emanating and gathering / in intermediate-space itself who holds / becomes that measure / appears as sign of effort-free liberation / for effort-possessing, effort measure."

[16668-16673] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *spro dang bsdu med par* (without emanating and gathering) negates the dualistic process of projection and withdrawal, indicating non-dual luminosity.

[16674-16683] [STRUCTURE] # Actual Lamp Face-Grasping
**Analysis:** Longchenpa describes the direct recognition (*ngo gzung*) of the actual lamp:

Bindu surrounded by round rim of five lights, possessing appearances of each of the six races:

1. **Gods (*lha*)**: Self hand-span, white, very large
2. **Demigods (*lha min*)**: Self hand, green
3. **Humans (*mi*)**: Self thumb-span, red-clear
4. **Animals (*byol song*)**: Not capable of outward viewing, naturally blue exists
5. **Hungry ghosts (*yi dwags*)**: Not outward, yellow
6. **Hells (*dmyal ba*)**: Not outwardly appearing, naturally five-colored

Bad destinies (*ngan song*) — due to small virtue portion, not outwardly appearing; inside, only a small portion exists self-complete.

[16676-16683] [PHILOLOGY] The possessive *la* indicates the "size" appropriate to each realm: gods have large bindus (hand-span), humans have smaller (thumb-span), lower realms have only internal/natural presence without outward manifestation.

[16684-16692] [CONTEXT] Citation from *thal 'gyur* (*Result-Come* tantra):
"To all buddhas and sentient beings / pervaded by non-different, natureless / that and buddhas completely pure complete / abide free of stainless dust / from the appearance-aspect of six-race sentient beings / abide in each continuum / gods are self-clear complete / to demigods fine and flickering."

[16684-16692] [CONCEPT] The citation establishes the universal presence of the bindu across all six realms, with variations in clarity based on karmic condition. This reflects the Dzogchen view that *thod rgal* vision is potential for all beings, though manifest realization depends upon karmic readiness.
