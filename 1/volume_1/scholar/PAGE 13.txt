[373-374] [CONCEPT] The Self-Arisen Nature of the Three Emanations
**Analysis:** The text emphasizes the non-manufactured (*sus kyang ma byas pa*) nature of the three emanations. The particle *sus kyang* (by anyone whatsoever) with the negative *ma* indicates absolute non-origination through agency. This aligns with the *svayaṃbhū* (self-arisen) doctrine in tantric Buddhism: enlightened manifestation is not created but naturally emerges from dharmatā. The term *mi 'jigs pa* (fearless) indicates that because these emanations are not fabricated, they transcend all fear—they cannot be destroyed, altered, or obstructed.

[375-376] [PHILOLOGY] Immediate Liberation Through Contact
**Analysis:** The phrase *gang dang phrad pa* (meeting with whichever) uses the ablative/locative *dang* to indicate contact or conjunction. The construction *rang dengs su grol* (self-immediately liberated) employs *rang* (self) + *dengs* (immediate/on the spot) + *grol* (liberated)—a quintessential Dzogchen formulation indicating instantaneous liberation without gradual path. The instrumental *gyis* in *byed pa'i 'phrin las* indicates that this is the activity (*'phrin las*) performed through/by means of this meeting.

[377-382] [STRUCTURE] # The Three Supports (*rten gsum*) for Liberation
**Analysis:** The text presents three supports corresponding to the three doors (*sgo gsum*) of liberation:

1. **Mind-support Vajra** (*thugs kyi rten rdo rje*) — function: disease-pacification to liberation
2. **Speech-support Self-arisen Letter** (*gsung gi rten rang byung gi yi ge*) — function: liberation through meeting and hearing
3. **Body-support Form** (*sku*) — function: liberation into clear light upon contact

These supports (*rten*) are not mere symbols but "power objects" (*byin brlabs can*) in Nyingma understanding—material forms infused with enlightened blessing that serve as gateways for recognition.

[383-392] [CONTEXT] # The Chronology of the Three Teachings
**Analysis:** The text presents a complex chronology correlating life-span with teaching modality:

**Body-taming teaching** (*sku'i 'dul ba'i bstan pa*): 3 × (5,500 years) = 16,500 years
- From Amitāyus life-span (*tshe lo dpag med*) to the time of the thousand Buddhas (*stong thub pa*)

**Speech-taming teaching** (*gsung gi 'dul ba'i bstan pa*): 5,500 years  
- Until 70-year life-span

**Mind-taming teaching** (*thugs kyi 'dul ba'i bstan pa*): 5,500 years
- Until 10-year life-span

These numbers reflect the *kalpa* cosmology where human life-span gradually decreases from 80,000 years to 10 years before the next Buddha (Maitreya) appears. The phrase *dus ma yin gyi* (not time but) clarifies that these are pedagogical categories (*'dul ba'i lo grangs*) rather than literal historical periods.

[393-397] [CONTEXT] # Locations of the Hidden Treasures
**Analysis:** The text identifies specific locations for the three supports:

1. **Vajra in Uddiyana** (*u rgyan gyi yul*) — the legendary land of the dakinis (modern Swat Valley, Pakistan), "salty-taste ocean island" (*rgya mtsho lan tshwa'i ro dang ldan pa'i gling*)

2. **Letter in sky above Vajra-seat** (*rdo rje gdan*) — held by dakinis at 500 leagues (*dpag tshad lnga brgya*) elevation

3. **Body abiding together** (*lhan cig bzhugs*) — co-present with the letter

These locations correspond to terma (*gter ma*) geography in Nyingma tradition—the Vajra is concealed in the earthly realm (Uddiyana), the letter in the aerial/celestial realm (sky dakinis), and the body bridges both. The occasional emanations (*skabs su*) indicate that these are not static objects but dynamic manifestations appearing when conditions ripen.
