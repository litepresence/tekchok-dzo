Endowed with essence and complete, great complete, likewise two and three endowed, contention and great contention, between each, in sixty dark aeons, teaching's support transfers elsewhere.

North Moving, teaching's lamp there resides. Glorious Protector called monk holds it. His patron king Jinamitra, makes secret teaching's basis. Years thousand three hundred resides.

Then dark aeon becomes, years hundred twenty becomes.

Then south Removing Sorrow (*'tsal ba skyob*) continent, vast beautiful, teaching's life-tree there descends. Joyful Glory monk, Tushita family, holds this teaching. His patron householder, Good Existence (*dge ba'i dngos grub*) called, hundred years makes reside.
