[12731-12776] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Path Section
The text transitions from the completed ground section to the path section. The structure establishes: (1) ground as the foundation now established, (2) path as the means of recognizing ground, (3) the necessity of path despite ground's completeness, and (4) the non-contradiction of spontaneous presence and progressive path.

[12731-12752] [PHILOLOGY] Transition Terminology
The term gzhi (ground) appears as completed topic. The term lam (path, mārga) introduces the new section. The phrase "gzhi rtogs pa'i thabs" (means of recognizing ground) identifies path's function. The compound rim gyis (gradual) acknowledges progressive elements. The term ngo sprod (pointing out) describes the method.

[12753-12776] [CONTEXT] Ground-Path-Result Structure
The transition follows classical Buddhist ground-path-result (gzhi lam 'bras bu) structure. Having established ground, the text proceeds to path—the methods for recognizing that ground. This structure reflects systematic pedagogical organization common to Tibetan Buddhist texts.

[12731-12776] [CONCEPT] Path as Recognition Method
The text conceptualizes path not as creating what is absent but as recognizing what is present. The path is necessary because beings fail to recognize ground, not because ground is incomplete. The path's function is "pointing out" (ngo sprod) what has always been the case. This formulation preserves both the completeness of ground and the necessity of path.
