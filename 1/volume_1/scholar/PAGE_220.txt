[8920-8946] [STRUCTURE] Manifestation Divisions: Empowerment Purifiers

This section presents the first manifestation division (rnam 'phrul gyi dbye ba) concerning individual empowerment purifiers (dbang so so'i dag byed), establishing the sixteen-fold purification system with transformations ('gyur dang bcas pa).

[8920-8938] [PHILOLOGY] Purification and Transformation Terminology

The text employs purificatory vocabulary:
- "Dag byed" (purifier): Agent of purification
- "Dag rgyu" (cause of purification): Basis to be purified
- "'Gyur" (transformation): Change, alteration
- "Bcu drug" (sixteen): Complete number
- "Rnam 'phrul" (manifestation): Display, emanation

The particle "ni" marks topic: "dang po ni dbang gi rang ngo'i dbye ba bcu drug gis phyi 'byung ba'i las bcu drug dag par byed la" (first, the sixteen self-nature divisions of empowerment purify outer sixteen arising actions). The emphatic "ni" establishes focus.

[8939-8964] [CONTEXT] Sixteen-fold Purification System

The sixteen purifications correspond to:
- Abhisamaya-alamkara: Sixteen aspects of path knowledge
- Hevajra: Sixteen joy stages (dga' ba bcu drug)
- Guhyagarbha: Sixteen vidyadharas
- Nyingma: Complete systematicity

Structure:
- 4 empowerments x 4 aspects = 16 purifiers
- Each purifies specific aspect of being
- Complete coverage of obscurations

[8965-8990] [CONCEPT] Three-level Purification

The sixteen purifiers operate on three levels:
1. Phyi (outer): 'Byung ba'i las (arising actions)
   - External activities
   - Physical dimension
   - Observable behavior

2. Nang (inner): Sems kyi rtog pa (mind's conceptuality)
   - Internal thought processes
   - Mental dimension
   - Subtle activity

3. Gsang (secret): Rlung gi 'phen sdu (wind's projection-withdrawal)
   - Secret energetic processes
   - Subtle body dimension
   - Most refined level

4. Bla na med pa: Sa bcu drug (sixteen grounds)
   - Ultimate dimension
   - Complete realization
   - Fruition level

[STRUCTURE] Body Activity and Natural State

[8991-9016] [PHILOLOGY] Body and State Terminology

The text employs embodied vocabulary:
- "Lus" (body): Physical basis
- "Bya ba" (activity): Action, engagement
- "Brten nas" (relying upon): Based on
- "Nges pa" (certainty): Definitive determination
- "Gnas lugs" (natural state): Innate condition

The particle "ni" marks method: "gnyis pa lus kyi bya ba la brten nas nges pa'i dbye bas dbang gi gnas lugs bstan pa ni" (second, showing the empowerment's natural state through definitive division relying upon body activity). The emphatic "ni" establishes topic.

[9017-9042] [CONTEXT] Body as Foundation in Tantra

The body activity reliance follows:
- Completion stage: Lus gnad (body essential points)
- Six Yogas: Physical supports for realization
- Dzogchen: Lus gnad kyi rtsa 'khrul (body channels/winds)
- Mahamudra: Physical posture as path

Key principle:
- Lus (body) supports practice
- Bya ba (activity) actualizes essence
- Nges pa (certainty) establishes result
- Gnas lugs (natural state) is revealed

[9043-9068] [CONCEPT] Body-Activity-State Correspondence

The correspondence operates as:
1. Lus (body):
   - Physical foundation
   - Karmic residue location
   - Practice support

2. Bya ba (activity):
   - Physical engagement
   - Karma creation/purification
   - Method application

3. Gnas lugs (natural state):
   - Innate condition
   - Beyond purification
   - Original perfection

This mirrors:
- Gzhi (ground): Natural state
- Lam (path): Activity
- 'Bras bu (fruit): Realization

[STRUCTURE] Purification of Defilements

[9069-9094] [PHILOLOGY] Defilement Enumeration Terminology

The text employs karmic vocabulary:
- "Dri ma" (defilement): Obscuration, stain
- "Dag byed" (purifier): Cleansing agent
- "Las" (karma): Action
- "Nyong mongs" (affliction): Klesha
- "Bstan pa" (show/teach): Presentation

The particle "ni" marks topic: "gsum pa grangs kyi dbye ba la brten nas las dang nyon mongs pa'i dag byed bstan pa'o" (third, showing karma and affliction purifiers relying upon number division). The emphatic "o" confirms statement.

[9095-9120] [CONTEXT] Two-fold Obscuration System

The two types of defilements:
1. Las (karma):
   - Action residue
   - Karmic imprints
   - Behavioral patterns

2. Nyong mongs (affliction):
   - Kleshas: Desire, anger, ignorance
   - Emotional obscurations
   - Mental afflictions

Together: Sgrib pa gnyis (two obscurations):
- Shes sgrib (obscuration of knowledge)
- Nyong sgrib (obscuration of affliction)

[9121-9146] [CONCEPT] Complete Purification Coverage

The three topics together cover:
1. Action/karma level:
   - External activities
   - Behavioral patterns
   - Physical dimension

2. Affliction/emotion level:
   - Internal states
   - Mental patterns
   - Psychological dimension

3. Natural state level:
   - Beyond purification
   - Original purity
   - Dharmakaya nature

Together: Complete framework for total liberation.

**Summary:**

Page 220 presents the first manifestation division on empowerment purifiers, body activity and natural state, and purification of defilements. Philologically, the text employs purificatory vocabulary, embodied terminology, and defilement enumeration. Contextual sources include Abhisamaya-alamkara sixteen aspects, completion stage body practices, and two obscuration theory. Conceptually, the section demonstrates sixteen-fold purification operating on three levels (outer actions, inner thoughts, secret winds), body-activity-state correspondence as foundation for realization, and complete coverage of karma/affliction purification—all representing empowerment as comprehensive cleansing leading to natural state revelation.
