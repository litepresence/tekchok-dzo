[16743-16756] [STRUCTURE] # Completion of the Twelve Similes Section
**Analysis:** Longchenpa completes the twelfth topic (*mthun dpe*) of the second lamp's eleven-fold analysis. The section employs a quadripartite simile structure comparing bindu (*thig le*) manifestations to:
1. Peacock tail (*rma bya'i mdongs*) - round self-resounding
2. Vulture eye (*pha khra'i mig*) - clarity portion and resound portion
3. Fish eye (*nya'i mig*) - luminous appearance and bindu particles
4. Thief's eye (*rkun mo'i mig*) - sparkle radiance and light rays

The citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (lines 16751-16755) authenticates these similes as standard Nyingthig technical vocabulary rather than literary ornamentation.

[16757-16797] [STRUCTURE] # The Third Lamp: dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma
**Analysis:** Longchenpa inaugurates the third of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*): The Lamp of the Completely Pure Sphere. The structural schema follows the established eleven-topic format:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. rang bzhin (nature)
5. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
6. goms tshul (familiarization manner)
7. tshad (measure)
8. gnas (abode)
9. sgo (door)
10. dngos (actual)
11. mthun dpe (simile)

This architectural consistency reflects the *mdzod* genre's encyclopedic imperative toward systematic classification.

[16770-16773] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terminology:
- *mthing ga* (blue): The base color (*khya ba chen po*) from which the five colors spread (*lnga ldan du mched*)
- *mu khyud* (rim): The circular perimeter of light
- *pad 'dab* (petals): Lotus-petal structures within the bindu
- *za 'og ber khyim* (house under a barrel): Technical simile for the enclosed, stable nature of this lamp's appearance
- *lu gu rgyud* (snake noose): The channel structure (*ra ba*) from which awareness shoots rays (*gzer 'debs*)

[16774-16783] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The text quotes: "The lamps of completely-pure nature and sphere gather the essence of awareness / appear at the snake-noose fence / for one familiarized with this, that meaning itself / blue unchanging self-luminous / abides at the rim's fence / self-luminous appears as outer object / essence itself is unfabricated."

This establishes the third lamp as integrative—gathering (*sdud*) the scattered elements into the *lu gu rgyud* structure while maintaining the *ka dag* (primordial purity) character.

[16784-16797] [CONCEPT] The visionary phenomenology:
The lamp manifests through progressive stages:
1. Initial gaze (*dang po*) to treasury-brow space (*mdzod spu'i thad*): sky-blue pervading light appears
2. Five colors emerge from within (*nang nas kha dog lnga 'char*)
3. Appear at eye corners (*mig zur gnyis*) like rainbow error (*'ja' ma nor*)

The citation from *mu tig phreng ba* (lines 16787-16796) provides scriptural authority: "Like sky-rainbow / pure afflictions stain exhausted / sphere vast expanse uncut / reality object completely-pure / from both objects arises / pervade great blue unchanging / appearance pure condition meet / becomes five colors."

**Summary:** Page 401 transitions from the second lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) to the third lamp (*dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*), completing the twelve similes and initiating the eleven-topic structural analysis of the sphere lamp. The progression moves from bindu particle phenomenology to the expansive sphere (*dbyings*) as integrating ground.
