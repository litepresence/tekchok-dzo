[19115-19168] [STRUCTURE] ## Expanded Explanation: Common and Uncommon Divisions
**Analysis:** Lines 19115-19168 continue the body classification, now distinguishing between:
1. Common divisions (*thun mong gi dbye ba*)
2. Uncommon divisions (*khyad par gyi dbye ba*)

This bipartite structure reflects the *mdzod* genre's concern with distinguishing Dzogchen's unique presentations from shared Buddhist doctrines—a hallmark of Nyingma doxography.

[19115-19168] [PHILOLOGY] **Taxonomic Terminology:**
- *thun mong*: "Common"—doctrines shared with lower vehicles
- *khyad par*: "Uncommon/particular"—distinctively Dzogchen presentations
- *ngo bo mdor bstan pa/* (19100): "Brief indication of essence"
- *rnam par rgyas par bshad pa/* (19101): "Expanded explanation of varieties"

The terminology reflects the *drang nges* (provisional/definitive) hermeneutical framework, where teachings are classified by their scope and ultimate validity.

[19115-19168] [CONCEPT] **Common Division: Two Bodies:**
The common presentation distinguishes two bodies from the *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon Union) tantra:

1. **Rig pa yul snang gi sku** (Body of awareness as object-appearance): Appears to the faculties, free from affirmation/negation (*dgag sgrub med pa*), subdivided into:
   - Faculty-purified body (*dbang po rnam dag gi sku*)
   - Aggregate-purified body (*phung po rnam dag gi sku*)
   - Element/abode/object/subject-purified body (*khams/skye mchad/yul/yul can rnam dag gi sku*)

2. **Dangs ma 'dus pa'i sku** (Body of gathered pure essences): Appears to those whose familiarity has become power, subdivided into:
   - Body holding path characteristics (*lam gyi mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i sku*)
   - Body of suchness (*ye ji bzhin pa'i sku*)

[19115-19168] [CONTEXT] **The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* Tantra:**
This tantra (cited at 19067-19069, 19073-19076, 19082-19086) is a key *Thal 'gyur* source for the thirteen-body system. Its title—"Sun-Moon Union" or "Union of Solar and Lunar Energies"—indicates its focus on the integration of opposites (method/wisdom, red/white essences) in the central channel. The *mdzod* relies heavily on this source for its unique body classifications.

[19115-19168] [CONCEPT] **Suchness Body (*ye ji bzhin pa'i sku*):**
The second body category presents three modes of "suchness":
1. **Ground self-arising wisdom** (*gzhi rang byung gi ye shes*): Body abiding from primordial wisdom
2. **Path unchanging body** (*lam 'od gdangs dbyings sku ye thog las phyir snang tsam las mi 'gyur ba'i sku*): Body of light-radiance-expanse, appearing externally from the peak of primordial suchness without changing
3. **Fruition spontaneously perfect body** (*'bras bu sku gsum lhun grub dbyings zad sar phyin pa'i sku gsum*): Three bodies of spontaneously perfect fruition reaching the exhaustion of the expanse

This tripartite structure maps the body onto the standard Buddhist ground-path-fruition (*gzhi-lam-'bras bu*) framework while maintaining the Dzogchen emphasis on primordial presence (*ye gnas*) and spontaneous perfection (*lhun grub*).

[19169-19220] [STRUCTURE] ## Uncommon Division: The Thirteen Bodies
**Analysis:** Lines 19169-19220 present the uncommon (*khyad par*) classification of thirteen bodies from the *Rang shar* tantra. This is the distinctive Dzogchen presentation, differing markedly from shared Buddhist body-taxonomies. The passage enumerates:
1. Root rigpa body (*rtsa ba rig pa'i sku*)
2. Vast dharmata body (*yangs pa chos nyid kyi sku*)
3. Expanded expanse body (*gdal ba dbyings kyi sku*)
4. Unchanging vajra body (*mi 'gyur ba rdo rje'i sku*)
5. Purity bliss body (*dag pa bde ba'i sku*)
6. Mistaken mind body (*log pa sems kyi sku*)
7. Liberation-through-seeing body (*mthong ba rang grol gyi sku*)
8. Single thigle body (*gcig pa thig le'i sku*)
9. Uninterrupted space body (*rgya ma chad pa nam mkha'i sku*)
10. Non-falling sun-moon body (*phyogs su ma lhung ba nyi zla'i sku*)
11. Non-dual lamp body (*tha mi dad pa cig shos kyi sku*)
12. Non-attachment self-liberation body (*zhen med rang grol gyi sku*)

[19169-19220] [PHILOLOGY] **Poetic Enumerations:**
The passage employs highly poetic, paradoxical language characteristic of *Thal 'gyur* revelation:
- *sangs rgyas med pa'i 'bras bu/* (19155): "Fruition without Buddhas"
- *sems can med pa'i 'khor ba/* (19156): "Samsara without sentient beings"
- *srog bcad pa'i sangs rgyas/* (19157): "Buddhas who have killed the life-force"
- *byas pa med pa'i byung ba/* (19158): "Arising without making"
- *mthong ma myong ba'i yul/* (19159): "Object never seen or experienced"

These oxymoronic phrases function as *med dgag* (non-affirming negations), deconstructing conventional categories while pointing to the inexpressible.

[19169-19220] [CONCEPT] **The Thirteen Bodies as Deconstructive Categories:**
Each "body" functions not as a metaphysical entity but as a perspective (*lta ba*) that dissolves a particular type of attachment:

1. **Root Rigpa Body**: The vajra knot vision—not external, not internal, but the unceasing clarity of one's own eye-faculty
2. **Vast Dharmata Body**: Beyond thought, mind, mentation, grasping—the expanse of primordial purity
3. **Expanded Expanse Body**: Uninterrupted, unbounded, unceasing, unproduced—the ground of all body-manifestation
4. **Unchanging Vajra Body**: Paradoxical negations (no-Buddha fruition, no-sentient-being samsara) pointing to non-dual ground
5. **Purity Bliss Body**: All-pervasive clarity (*gsal mtha' yas*)—not localized, not limited
6. **Mistaken Mind Body**: The samsaric body as erroneous perspective, not ultimately existent
7. **Liberation-through-Seeing Body**: Liberation not through effort but through recognition of what already is
8. **Single Thigle Body**: Seven wisdoms unified in one sphere
9. **Uninterrupted Space Body**: Non-duality of opposites (appearance/wisdom, space/expanse, etc.)
10. **Non-Falling Sun-Moon Body**: Beyond the extremes of eternalism and nihilism
11. **Non-Dual Lamp Body**: Integration of method and wisdom
12. **Non-Attachment Self-Liberation Body**: Liberation through non-attachment, not through rejection

[19169-19220] [CONTEXT] **Doxographical Significance:**
This thirteen-body system represents one of the most distinctive contributions of Nyingma *Thal 'gyur* literature to Buddhist phenomenology. Unlike the systematic ontologies of Sarma tantra or the negative dialectics of Prasaṅgika-Madhyamaka, this classification functions as:
- A deconstructive tool (*spang blang med pa*—without acceptance or rejection)
- A recognition-guide (*ngo sprod*—pointing out instructions)
- A phenomenological map of the natural state's self-liberated display

Longchenpa's inclusion of this system in the *mdzod* ensures its preservation and transmission as authoritative Nyingma doctrine.
