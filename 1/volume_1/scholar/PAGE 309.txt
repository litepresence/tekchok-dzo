[12823-12868] [STRUCTURE] Preliminary Practices (sngon 'gro) Presentation
The text presents preliminary practices in the context of Dzogchen. The structure establishes: (1) the four common preliminaries (thun mong sngon 'gro), (2) the four special preliminaries (thun min sngon 'gro), (3) the purpose of preliminaries in preparing for recognition, and (4) the integration of preliminaries with main practice.

[12823-12844] [PHILOLOGY] Preliminary Terminology
The term sngon 'gro (preliminary, pūrvaka) appears with classifiers: thun mong (common), thun min (uncommon/special). The four common preliminaries: dal 'byor (precious human birth), rtsi shing (impermanence), las 'bras (karma and result), 'khor ba'i nyes dmigs (faults of saṃsāra). The four special: skyabs 'gro (refuge), sngags (mantra), mandal (offering), khro bo (guru yoga).

[12845-12868] [CONTEXT] Nyingma Preliminary System
The preliminary practices presentation follows the Nyingma system integrating common Mahayana preliminaries with special tantric preliminaries. This reflects the graduated approach to Dzogchen, where practitioners prepare through these practices before receiving direct recognition instructions. The system ensures readiness for the main practice.

[12823-12868] [CONCEPT] Preliminaries as Preparation for Recognition
The text conceptualizes preliminary practices as preparing the practitioner for recognition—not producing wisdom but removing obstacles and creating conditions. The common preliminaries develop renunciation and bodhicitta; the special preliminaries develop devotion and purification. Together they create the receptivity necessary for pointing-out instructions.
