[17008-17062] [STRUCTURE] # Actual Lamp and Simile Sections
**Analysis:** Longchenpa completes the third lamp's eleven-topic analysis with:
- Tenth topic: Actual (*dngos*)
- Eleventh topic: Simile (*mthun dpe*)

[17013-17046] [CONCEPT] The Actual Lamp (*dbyings kyi sgron ma dngos*):
The lamp actually arises from both eye corners, blue pervading great light, limitless. Inside, awareness-light abides in that house. Outside, snake-noose bindu empty with that fence abides. The five lights' appearance and rim's fence—both are the actual sphere.

Four non-affirming characteristics (*gnad bzhi*):
1. Without coarse entity (*dngos po rag par med*): not established as grasped object
2. Not severed emptiness (*chad pa phyang chad*): self-luminous like rainbow
3. Unharmed by elements (*'byung ba'i gnod pas mi shigs*): not compounded samsara
4. Possessing vital point (*gnad dang ldan*): seeing and familiarizing leads to primordial buddhahood

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17024-17046) establishes these characteristics through verses on vital points, suitable persons, samsara's upper space, entry from two corners, method and wisdom nature, ignorance as one finger, day-time element condition, night-time blue face conjoining, sphere's nature light house, unchanging great self-resound, buddhas and beings all, none made by anyone, primordially nondual equal abiding, from subtle abides, self-cognition arises, manifestly that greatly secret, great secret this itself, who wishes to practice, buddhahood even in primordial buddhahood.

[17047-17062] [CONCEPT] The Simile: Na-ro bird letter (*yi ge na ro*):
The simile compares the sphere lamp to the Tibetan letter na-ro (ནྲོ): two wings gathered as one bird-form. Similarly, outer blue sphere and appearance arising from it gathered together are called sphere lamp as one.

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17053-17062) provides the scriptural basis:
- Example like letter na-ro
- Two grasped and gathered as one
- Black changed, able to transform
- From that familiarization confidence obtained
- Intermediate space rainbow like
- Color unmixed completely perfect
- Then also familiarization power
- Possessing that sign
- Intermediate realm likewise thus

[17063-17071] [STRUCTURE] # Fourth Lamp Introduction: shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma
**Analysis:** Longchenpa inaugurates the fourth lamp: The Lamp of Self-Arising Wisdom (*shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*). The structural schema presents eight topics:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
5. sgo (door)
6. gnas (abode)
7. tshad (measure)
8. mthun dpe (simile)

This reduced topic count (eight vs. eleven) indicates a shift toward the most subtle and self-recognized dimension of the four lamps.

[17072-17087] [CONCEPT] Essence of Self-Arising Wisdom:
The essence is all lamps' object-knower, intent dharmata empty-luminous self-abiding, knowing with power. Through method-distance water lamp, bindu, sphere three unmoving gazing: inside self-awareness clarity-emptiness half-pure self-abiding, expanse rolling knowing with awareness.

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17079-17087) establishes:
- Self-arising wisdom lamp thus
- All lamps' object-knower abiding
- All's parts this itself
- Discriminating wisdom itself
- Abiding without discriminating manner
- Subtle part arising essence
- Primordially thus abiding

---

**Summary:** Page 404 completes the third lamp with the actual lamp description and na-ro simile, then inaugurates the fourth lamp with its essence definition. The progression moves from spatial-expansive sphere to self-recognized wisdom as the culmination of the four-lamp system.
