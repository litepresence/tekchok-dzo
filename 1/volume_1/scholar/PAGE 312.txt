[12967-12993] [STRUCTURE] Decoding Transgressive Metaphors: Detailed Interpretation
This section provides esoteric interpretation of *Sengge Tsal* citation's transgressive metaphors: (1) liberating three realms and attaining siddhi (12967-12969): cutting root of mind and mental factors included in three gates/realms, siddhi arising through cessation; (2) throwing vajra master into ocean (12970-12971): resting in view, mind/cognition not thinking anything, eyes producing clarity (dngas 'byin) generating manifest knowledge; (3) throwing siblings into ravine (12972-12973): binding wind-mind (rlung sems bzung nas) in channels (lu gu rgyud) - completion stage (rdzogs rim) practice; (4) expelling parents (12974-12976): projecting lamp of pure space (dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma) and lamp of empty bindu (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma) to sense-gateway, appearances increasing upward (snang ba gong du 'phel) - thodgal vision development; (5) throwing stupa and temple into ocean (12977-12979): awareness's stupa (rig pa'i mchod rten) in citta-center, temple of five lights ('od lnga'i lha khang), gaze technique (lta stangs) projecting to water-lamp of distant lasso (rgyang zhags chu'i sgron mar gtad), outer appearance-wisdom and inner reality-wisdom meeting as mother-child clear light without separation.

[12967-12993] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terms for Subtle Body and Visionary Practice
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Causative with cessation: sgo gsum dang khams gsum gyis bsdus pa'i sems sems byung rtsa ba bcad nas 'gag par byed pa (cutting root of mind/mental-factors included in three gates/realms, causing cessation, 12969); (2) Terminative with clarity: mig la dngas 'byin pas mngon sum shes pa (eyes producing clarity, manifest knowledge arises, 12971); (3) Instrumental with binding: rlung sems bzung nas (having bound wind-mind, 12973); (4) Locative with channels: lu gu rgyud la lta ba (looking at channels, 12973); (5) Causative with projection: dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma dang thig le stong pa'i sgron ma dbang po'i thad la bton nas bltas pas (projecting lamps of pure space/empty bindu to sense-gateway, 12975-12976); (6) Directional with increase: snang ba gong du 'phel (appearances increase upward, 12976); (7) Spatial metaphors: tsitta'i dbus (citta-center), 'od lnga'i lha khang (five lights' temple), rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma (water-lamp of distant lasso), phyir snang ba'i ye shes (outer appearance-wisdom), nang chos nyid don gyi ye shes (inner reality-wisdom), 'od gsal ma bu 'phrod pa (mother-child clear light meeting, 12978-12979).

[12967-12993] [CONTEXT] Six Lamps, Thodgal, and Completion Stage
The passage integrates: (1) Six Lamps (sgron ma drug) of thodgal: lamp of pure space (dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma), lamp of empty bindu (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma), water lamp (chu'i sgron ma) - core thodgal visionary technology; (2) Wind-mind binding (rlung sems bzung nas) - completion stage (rdzogs rim) practice of working with channels (rtsa), winds (rlung), bindus (thig le); (3) Citta (tsitta) - heart center as location of awareness's stupa; (4) Mother-child clear light ('od gsal ma bu 'phrod pa) - meeting of ground-clear-light (mother) and path-clear-light (child); (5) Dngas 'byin - technical term for direct perception in Dzogchen epistemology; (6) Three gates (sgo gsum) - body, speech, mind; three realms (khams gsum) - desire, form, formless; (7) Channels (lu gu rgyud/rtsa) - subtle body network for energy circulation.

[12967-12993] [CONCEPT] Symbolic Violence as Actual Transformation
The philosophical framework: (1) Transgressive metaphors decode as subtle body and visionary practices: "liberating" = cutting conceptual mind at root; "throwing into ocean" = dissolving into expanse of view; "throwing into ravine" = binding wind-mind in central channel; "expelling parents" = projecting visionary lamps; "throwing stupa/temple" = activating inner sanctuary of awareness; (2) All practices converge on recognition: cutting, dissolving, binding, projecting - all methods for revealing awareness's natural state; (3) Thodgal technology: five lights' temple, space/bindu lamps, water-lamp gaze - external visionary catalysts for internal recognition; (4) Mother-child meeting: ground-luminosity (ever-present) recognized through path-luminosity (visionary experience) - union without separation; (5) Siddhi (dngos grub) arises not from action but from cessation of conditioned activity - wind-mind bound, conceptual mind cut, recognition manifest; (6) Symbolic "violence" is actually compassionate skillful means - cutting delusion, not harming beings.
