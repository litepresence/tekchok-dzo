[8546-8576] [STRUCTURE] Great Mudra and Self-Liberation

This section presents the culmination of completion stage practice in Great Mudra (phyag rgya chen po) and self-liberation (rang grol). The structure moves from the four mudras synthesis through the mechanisms of thigle retention to the indicators of successful practice, establishing the complete path from deliberate method to spontaneous wisdom.

[8546-8566] [PHILOLOGY] Causative and Resultative Particles

The text employs causative morphology for transformative processes:
- "'Dzoms pa" (gather/accumulate): From 'dzom (to collect)
- "Sbyar ba" (join/unite): Causative of 'phrod
- "Grol ba" (liberate): Causative of grol

The instrumental construction: "padma'i rgya gsum gyi btab pas" (by applying the three lotus seals). The resultative "ni" emphasizes consequence: "bde ba dang gsal ba dang stong pa gsum myong ba" (experiencing bliss, clarity, and emptiness).

[8567-8590] [CONTEXT] Four Mudras and Three Kaya Integration

The four mudras synthesis derives from:
- Hevajra Tantra: Las kyi phyag rgya as entry
- Guhyasamaja: Chos kyi phyag rgya as expansion
- Kalachakra: Dam tshig gi phyag rgya as stabilization
- Dzogchen: Phyag rgya chen po as culmination

The Thalgyur citation "sku gsung thugs kyi rdo rje che / rgya gsum ldan pa'i padma'i dbus" establishes Nyingma integration.

[8591-8616] [CONCEPT] Bliss-Clarity-Emptiness Integration

The three lotus seals generate three qualities:
1. Bde ba (bliss): From union method
   - Physical sensation refined
   - Corresponds to sna tshogs (diversity)

2. Gsal ba (clarity): From retention
   - Mental lucidity enhanced
   - Corresponds to rnam dag (complete purity)

3. Stong pa (emptiness): From release
   - Non-dual recognition
   - Corresponds to mnyam pa (equality)

[STRUCTURE] Thigle Retention and Channel Opening

[8617-8642] [PHILOLOGY] Retention and Expansion Terminology

The channel work employs action verbs:
- "'Byongs pa" (release): From 'byong (to release/let go)
- "Rgyas pa" (expand): From rgyas (vast/wide)
- "Sbyangs pa" (refine): From sbyong (to purify)

The causal construction: "rtsa 'byongs pas snyom 'jug byas ma byas 'dra bar" (channel release makes equipoise like non-equipoise). The particle "ni" marks definition of measurement.

[8643-8668] [CONTEXT] Signs of Thigle Mastery

The indicators of accomplishment include:
- Rtsa 'byongs (channel release): No illness arises
- Rlung 'byongs (wind release): Ting nge 'dzin (samadhi) arises
- Thig le 'byongs (drop release): Extraordinary capacities

These correspond to:
- Las kyi phyag rgya: External accomplishment
- Dam tshig gi phyag rgya: Internal stabilization
- Phyag rgya chen po: Secret realization

[8669-8696] [CONCEPT] Ordinary and Extraordinary Accomplishments

The two levels of thigle practice yield:
1. Kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems (conventional bodhicitta):
   - Rkang pa sa la ma reg par 'gro nus (walking without touching ground)
   - Lus kyi rdul phran zang thal du mthong (seeing body atoms)
   - Nam mkha' la 'phur bar nus (flying through sky)
   - Tshe nyi zla dang mnyam (lifespan like sun/moon)

2. Don dam pa byang chub kyi sems (ultimate bodhicitta):
   - 'Pho ba khyad par can (special transference)
   - Rnam shes gzhan gyi grong khyer 'jug (entering other consciousness)
   - 'Chi ba rang grol (self-liberated death)

[STRUCTURE] Five Stages of Blissful Wisdom

[8697-8722] [PHILOLOGY] Ordinal Enumeration and Temporal Progression

The five stages employ systematic ordering:
- "Dang po" (first): Dga' ba (joy)
- "Gnyis pa" (second): Tshor ba (sensation)
- "Gsum pa" (third): Bde ba (bliss)
- "Bzhi pa" (fourth): Myong ba (experience)
- "Lnga pa" (fifth): Stong pa (emptiness)

The particle "ni" marks stages: "dang po dga' ba ni 'jug pa'i ye shes" (first joy is entry wisdom). The temporal "dus" marks transitions between stages.

[8723-8748] [CONTEXT] Kalachakra and Hevajra Bliss Systems

The five bliss stages correspond to:
1. Dga' ba: Ananda (ordinary pleasure)
2. Tshor ba: Paramananda (supreme sensation)
3. Bde ba: Viramananda (cessation bliss)
4. Myong ba: Sahajananda (co-emergent experience)
5. Stong pa: Chittananda/Chittanubhava (mind void/experience)

These align with Kalachakra's progressive dissolution and Hevajra's four joys expanded to five.

[8749-8776] [CONCEPT] From Effort to Beyond Effort

The stages trace a progression:
- Stages 1-2: 'Jug pa'i ye shes (entry wisdom), effortful
- Stage 3: Sems dang ye shes 'khrug pa'i dus (mind-wisdom disturbance), transitional
- Stage 4: Dbyer mi byed pa (non-dual), integrated
- Stage 5: Mtha' gnyis las ma 'das pa (beyond extremes), ultimate

This mirrors Dzogchen's four visions (snang ba bzhi) or trekchö (khregs chod) progression.

[STRUCTURE] View Stabilization and Three Kaya Ground

[8777-8806] [PHILOLOGY] Stabilization and Ground Terminology

The text employs achievement vocabulary:
- "Thob pa" (attain): From thob (to obtain)
- "Brten pa" (stabilize): From brten (to rely upon)
- "Gnas pa" (abide): From gnas (to remain)

The construction: "sku gsum po'i sa la gshegs" (gone to the ground of three kayas). The emphatic "ni" marks definitive attainment: "lta ba brten pa'i dus" (time of stabilized view).

[8807-8830] [CONTEXT] Durkhrod Tragtsal Gyü Citation

The citation from Durkhrod Tragtsal Gyü (dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud):
"Byang sems thig le la sbyangs pas / mchog dang thun mong yon tan rnams / rang gi sems la gang 'dod pa / 'di yis nges par 'grub par 'gyur"

This establishes the textual authority for thigle refinement practices and their results.

[8831-8856] [CONCEPT] Three Kaya Realization as Ground

The final realization manifests as:
1. G.yo ba (moving): Unstable stage
   - Tha mal pa'i 'dod pa (ordinary desire)
   - Lta ba g.yo ba'i dus (time of moving view)

2. Thob pa (attained): Stabilization
   - Tha mal pa'i rtog pa med pa (no ordinary conceptuality)
   - Lta ba thob pa'i dus (time of attained view)

3. Brten pa (stable): Complete realization
   - Lus sems gnyis med (body-mind non-dual)
   - Phyag rgya chen po blo las 'das pa'i don (great mudra meaning beyond mind)
   - 'Pho 'gyur med pa (without transition or change)

**Summary:**

Page 206 presents Great Mudra realization, thigle retention methods, channel opening signs, the five stages of blissful wisdom, and three kaya stabilization. Philologically, the text employs causative and resultative constructions, ordinal enumeration, and achievement terminology. Contextual sources include Hevajra, Guhyasamaja, Kalachakra, Durkhrod Tragtsal Gyü, and Dzogchen systems. Conceptually, the section demonstrates the progression from four mudras to Great Mudra, the indicators of successful thigle practice, the five-fold dissolution of bliss, and the stabilization of view in the three kaya ground.
