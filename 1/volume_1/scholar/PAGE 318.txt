[13237-13282] [STRUCTURE] Path Summary
The text presents a summary of the path section. The structure synthesizes: (1) the two main practices—cutting through and leapover, (2) the preliminary practices as preparation, (3) obstacles and their antidotes, and (4) the single goal of continuous recognition.

[13237-13258] [PHILOLOGY] Path Summary Terminology
The term lam gyi don bsdu ba (summarizing the meaning of the path) introduces the synthesis. The enumeration khregs chod (cutting through) and thod rgal (leapover) reviews the main practices. The phrase sngon 'gro'i don (purpose of preliminaries) acknowledges preparation. The term rgyun chags (continuous) describes the goal.

[13259-13282] [CONTEXT] Path Section Completion
The summary marks the completion of the path section, which has covered: preliminary practices, cutting through, leapover, their integration, obstacles, and progression signs. This comprehensive treatment provides the practical framework for the ground theory presented earlier. Ground and path together establish the complete view-practice structure.

[13237-13282] [CONCEPT] Path as Recognition Continuity
The synthesis conceptualizes the entire path as establishing continuous recognition. All practices—preliminaries, cutting through, leapover—serve this single purpose. Obstacles are recognized as the path; experiences are recognized as empty; progression is measured by recognition stability. The path is thus the continuous disclosure of ground.
