[12869-12914] [STRUCTURE] Cutting Through (khregs chod) Introduction
The text introduces cutting through (khregs chod) practice. The structure establishes: (1) khregs chod as cutting through mind and conceptuality, (2) the three stages of cutting through: external, internal, and secret, (3) the result as naked awareness, and (4) the relationship between cutting through and leapover.

[12869-12890] [PHILOLOGY] Cutting Through Terminology
The term khregs chod (cutting through, breaking open) derives from khregs (solidity, hardness) and chod (cutting, severing). The three stages: phyi khregs chod (external), nang khregs chod (internal), gsang ba khregs chod (secret). The phrase "rig pa rjen pa" (naked awareness) describes the result. The compound thod rgal (leapover) provides contrast.

[12891-12914] [CONTEXT] Khregs Chod Historical Background
Cutting through practice has historical roots in Tibetan contemplative traditions, particularly associated with sems sde (Mind Class) Dzogchen. The practice emphasizes direct recognition of mind-nature through dissolving conceptual fixation. The three stages reflect progressively subtle approaches to the same recognition.

[12869-12914] [CONCEPT] Cutting Through as Conceptual Dissolution
The text conceptualizes cutting through as dissolving conceptual "hardness" (khregs)—the rigid structures of thought that obscure awareness. External cutting through addresses outer appearances; internal addresses the body and energy; secret addresses mind itself. The result is "naked" (rjen pa) awareness—awareness without conceptual covering.
