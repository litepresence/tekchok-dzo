[12118-12153] [CONTEXT] Standard Buddha-Qualities in Dzogchen Framework and Rang shar Tantra
The passage integrates: (1) Classical Mahāyāna buddhology: ten powers (daśabala), four fearlessnesses (caturvaiśāradya), thirty-two marks (lakṣaṇa), eighty signs (anuvyañjana) from Abhidharma and Prajñāpāramitā literature; (2) Five-kāya structure expands standard trikāya with Vajrayāna additions; (3) Five wisdom terraces (ye shes lnga'i bang rim) correspond to five wisdom buddhas; (4) "Rang shar" (Self-Arisen) tantra citation (12137-12164) provides Atiyoga authority with seventeen jewel (rin po che) metaphors: piled jewel-heap, jeweled palace, jewel-adorned consort, jewel-arrayed net, jewel-horse, jewel-vessel, five-jewel plain, secret jewel-sun, jewel-water-lotus, piled jewel-fire, jewel-wind-wisdom, jewel-earth, jewel-space, blazing jewel-light, jewel-ray-garland, jewel-empty-maṇḍala, jewel-three-extreme-knots, jewel-clearing-darkness, jewel-ocean-peak, jewel-lamp, jewel-secret-wisdom, jewel-interconnection-path, jewel-blazing-stupa, jewel-vajra-seat, jewel-empty-path. These represent classical Vajrayāna maṇi symbolism integrated into Dzogchen's spontaneous presence framework.

[12118-12153] [CONCEPT] Spontaneously Present Qualities Without Transformation
The philosophical framework: (1) All buddha-qualities are spontaneously present (lhun grub) in expanse, not produced through effort; (2) Ten powers, fearlessnesses, marks/signs are natural expression (rang rtsal) of awareness, not achievements accumulated over time; (3) Simultaneity of self-abiding (complete rest, mi g.yo zhing) and all-pervading compassion-activity (thugs rje chen po'i stong lam phyogs mtha' gtugs pa kun tu 'phro) - mutually enabling, not contradictory; (4) Qualities are inexhaustible (nub pa med, tha yas pa) - continuously blazing (rtag tu mi nub pa'i rang bzhin), not temporally produced or destroyed; (5) Single knot of essence-nature-compassion (ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum gyi rgya mdud gcig) - triune structure of buddhahood where emptiness, clarity, and compassionate energy are inseparable; (6) Five lights' internal radiance (nang gdangs) without mixture yet perfectly even (mnyam pa) - simultaneous diversity and unity; (7) Self-appearance without increase/decrease - qualities neither grow through practice nor diminish through neglect; (8) Rang shar citation's jewel metaphors: each quality is like a wish-fulfilling jewel spontaneously manifesting without effort or transformation.
