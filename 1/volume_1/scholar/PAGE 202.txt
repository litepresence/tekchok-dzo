[8390-8421] [STRUCTURE] Har Ti Family and Methodology of Attainment

This section completes the presentation of the four families (rigs bzhi) with emphasis on the Har ti family characteristics and the four methods of attainment (sbyar bas 'grub, bsten pas 'grub, bsam pas 'grub, mthong bas 'grub). The structural progression moves from physical description to practical application.

[8390-8406] [PHILOLOGY] Descriptive Particles and Body Terminology

The Har ti description employs precise anatomical terminology:
- "Byad" (physique/proportions): Root term for bodily form
- "Dkyus" (length/proportion): Linear measurement
- "Rked skabs" (waist interval): Specific anatomical landmark
- "Snying mthams" (between eyebrows): Ajna chakra location

The particle "ni" serves definitive function: "'di ni bde ba ster bas padma can zhes bshad do" (this is explained as lotus-holder because it bestows bliss). The emphatic "yang dag 'dod" (properly accepted) establishes authoritative classification.

[8407-8436] [CONTEXT] Drawing Practices and Ritual Technology

The section presents two methods for drawing consorts (dgug pa):
1. Sngags (mantra): employing Vajrasattva heart-mind invocation
2. Rten 'brel (dependent connection): using ritual substances and sympathetic magic

The mantra construction follows standard Hevajra format with:
- Om as invocation
- Lheng lheng bsdu bsdu as binding syllables  
- Rdo rje sems dpa' as deity identification
- Slong che ge mo as supplication formula

[8437-8466] [CONCEPT] Karmic Correspondence Theory

The four attainment methods operate through different karmic mechanisms:
- Sbyar ba (joining): Direct energetic union
- Bsten pa (reliance): Cumulative karmic connection
- Bsam pa (contemplation): Mental causation
- Mthong ba (seeing): Visual imprint

The hierarchy suggests that physical union yields highest results (dngos grub rab), reliance produces medium (dngos grub 'bring), and mental/seeing methods yield lesser results, though all serve as supports for each other.

[STRUCTURE] Channel Characteristics of the Five Families

[8467-8492] [PHILOLOGY] Comparative Adjectives and Length Terminology

The five family channel classification employs comparative morphology:
- "Ring ba" (long): Superlative length
- "Thung ba" (short): Minimal length
- "'Bring po" (medium): Intermediate position

The particle "ni" appears as topicalizer: "ring ba ni bde ba kha sra la phyir nas" (as for long, [it produces] external superior bliss). The causal construction "las...skye" (arises from) establishes physiological causation.

[8493-8520] [CONTEXT] Ayurvedic and Tantric Physiology Integration

The substances listed for bodhicitta expansion reflect integration of:
- Ayurvedic rasayana (rejuvenation) practices: ram nye (costus), mu zi (nutmeg)
- Tantric alchemical substances: sheep intestine (lung thug), sparrow tongue (bye'u rgya mchil)
- Standard offerings: bu ram (molasses), chang (alcohol)

These substances operate through rasa-vīrya-vipāka (taste-potency-post-digestive effect) principles mapped onto tantric subtle body.

[8521-8546] [CONCEPT] Pleasure Typology and Wisdom Correlation

The channel length correlates with pleasure characteristics:
- Long channels: Extended duration, external focus, Kriya/Upa affinity
- Short channels: Brief intensity, immediate gratification, Yoga affinity
- Medium channels: Balanced integration, Maha/Anu affinity

This typology corresponds to the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) and their progressive unfoldment through tantric practice.

[STRUCTURE] Six Body Postures for Channel Opening

[8547-8572] [PHILOLOGY] Postural Imperatives and Particle Commands

The six postures employ imperative mood:
- "Bskum pa" (contract): Active voice command
- "Bzed pa" (hold): Sustained engagement
- "Bzlog pa" (reverse): Directional transformation
- "Gdab pa" (apply): Technical placement

The particle "ni" as emphatic: "lus gnad seng ge'i mchongs stabs byas te" (having performed the lion's leap body essential point). The construction "ste" (having done) establishes sequential practice stages.

[8573-8598] [CONTEXT] Six Yogas of Naropa and Nyingma Integration

The postures correspond to Six Yogas framework:
1. Seng ge'i mchongs stabs (lion's leap) - inner heat (gtum mo)
2. Ro stod gseng la bor ba (vase posture) - illusory body (sgyu lus)
3. Mig gis hur gdon pa (eye extraction) - clear light ('od gsal)
4. Rgyu ma sgal pa la bzed pa (channel retention) - dream yoga (rmi lam)
5. HUM ring brjod pa (long HUM) - intermediate state (bar do)
6. Skabs su ig gi sgra gdon pa (HA sound) - consciousness transference ('pho ba)

[8599-8624] [CONCEPT] Obstruction Removal and Spiritual Development

Each posture targets specific obstacles:
- Finger/toe contraction: Cuts root of samsara ('khor ba'i rtsa ba gcod pa)
- Vase breath: Joins wind-mind (rlung sems ka sbyor ba)
- Eye reversal: Opens wisdom gate (ye shes kyi sgo sel ba)
- Channel hold: Liberates physical bliss (lus kyi bde ba nges par grol ba)
- HUM recitation: Mixes wind-mind with dharmata (rlung sems chos nyid du bsre ba)
- HA sound: Produces purity result (chos nyid rnam dag gi 'bras bu)

[STRUCTURE] Thigle Refinement and Three Kaya Bliss

[8625-8650] [PHILOLOGY] Causative Constructions and Result Particles

The section employs causative verb morphology:
- "Bskyed pa" (produces/causes to arise): From skyed (to grow)
- "Sbyang ba" (refines/purifies): Causative of sbyongs (to clean)
- "Myong ba" (experiences): Direct perception

The particle "gis" (instrumental) establishes means: "om gyis rdo rjer bskyed pa ni" (by means of OM, producing vajra). The resultative "ni" marks the consequence.

[8651-8676] [CONTEXT] Guhyasamaja and Three Vajra System

The three syllable generation follows Guhyasamaja (gsang ba 'dus pa) architecture:
- OM generates vajra body (sku rdo rje)
- AH generates vajra speech (gsung rdo rje)
- HUM generates vajra mind (thugs rdo rje)

This corresponds to the three mysteries (gsang ba gsum) of body, speech, and mind, and their purification into three vajras.

[8677-8702] [CONCEPT] Sequential and Simultaneous Practice Modes

The text presents two modes of thigle refinement:
1. Rim gyis (gradual/sequential): Moving from root (rtsa ba) to waist (rked pa) to tip (rtsa mo)
2. Cig car (simultaneous): All three locations at once

The gradual path develops stability; the simultaneous path requires advanced capacity. Both lead to the four mudras culminating in Great Mudra (phyag rgya chen po).

[STRUCTURE] Five Stages of Blissful Wisdom

[8703-8728] [PHILOLOGY] Ordinal Enumeration and Definitive Markers

The five stages employ systematic enumeration:
- "Dang po" (first) through "lnga pa" (fifth)
- Particle "ste" (this is): Definitive identification
- "Ces bya" (called): Nominal designation
- "Zhes so" (thus it is said): Scriptural attestation

The construction "dus" (time/moment) marks the temporal progression: "sems dang ye shes 'khrug pa'i dus" (the time of mind-wisdom disturbance).

[8729-8754] [CONTEXT] Hevajra and Kalachakra Bliss Stages

The five bliss stages correspond to:
1. Ananda (dga' ba): Ordinary pleasure
2. Paramananda (mchog dga'): Supreme pleasure
3. Viramananda (bral dga'): Cessation pleasure
4. Sahajananda (lhan skyes dga'): Co-emergent pleasure
5. Chittananda (sems kyi dga'): Mind pleasure

These align with Kalachakra (dus 'khor) five-fold bliss system mapped onto completion stage.

[8755-8780] [CONCEPT] From Effort to Beyond Effort

The five stages trace a progression from effort to spontaneity:
- Stages 1-2: Require intentional engagement ('jug pa)
- Stage 3: Transitional, mind-wisdom interaction
- Stage 4: Non-dual experience (dbyer mi byed pa)
- Stage 5: Beyond extremes, neither mind nor wisdom (gang du yang ma phyed)

This corresponds to the Dzogchen progression from khrul 'khor ( Yantra ) through spontaneous presence (lhun grub).

**Summary:**

Pages 202 continues the completion stage exposition with detailed analysis of the Har ti family characteristics, channel typology of the five families, six body postures, thigle refinement methods, and the five stages of blissful wisdom. The philological analysis reveals systematic use of causative constructions, imperative mood for practice instructions, and ordinal enumeration for progressive stages. Contextual sources include Hevajra Tantra, Guhyasamaja, Six Yogas of Naropa, and Kalachakra systems integrated into Nyingma presentation. Conceptually, the section presents the transition from deliberate practice to spontaneous wisdom through progressive refinement of subtle body elements.
