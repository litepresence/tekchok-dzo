[5711-5778] [STRUCTURE] Five Perfections Framework
**Analysis:** Lines 5711-5778 present the five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*) framework:

**Two Preambles' Five-Five Structure [5734-5738]:**
Each of the two preambles abides in five-fold five perfections:
1. Teacher perfection (*ston pa phun sum tshogs pa*)
2. Place perfection (*gnas phun sum tshogs pa*)
3. Retinue perfection (*'khor phun sum tshogs pa*)
4. Dharma perfection (*chos phun sum tshogs pa*)
5. Time perfection (*dus phun sum tshogs pa*)

**Citation from *Nyi zla kha sbyor* [5739-5744]:**
"Great secret tantras endowed with five perfections, both common and uncommon, are the seed of preambles."

**Two-fold Reasoning [5705-5712]:**
1. Common reasoning (*thun mong gi 'thad pa*)
2. Uncommon reasoning (*thun mong ma yin pa'i 'thad pa*)

**Common Reasoning [5713-5716]:**
When a tantra arises, the teacher necessarily taught it at a location, so the location must exist at that time. Since they gather, time arises immediately.

**Uncommon Reasoning [5717-5725]:**
When inert awareness gathers, body serves as support. In the form aggregate's field, consciousness is teacher, perception (*'du shes*) gathers as retinue, feeling (*tshor ba*) teaching arises, at the five times of formations (*'du byed*).

**Etymology [5726-5738]:**

- *Gleng* — word (*tshig*), expressed speech (*brjod pa'i gsung*)
