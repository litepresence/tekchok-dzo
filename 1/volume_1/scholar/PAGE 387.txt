[16214-16228] [CONTEXT] Continuation of Mind-Movements
**Analysis:** Lines 16214-16222 complete the fifth type of mind-movement from the previous page: the afflictive mind-movement produces desire ('dod pa), obscuration (rmugs pa), anger (sdang ba), attachment (chags pa), clinging (zhen pa), ignorance (mi shes pa), etc., as cause, condition, essence, and particular. The sixth type (lines 16223-16228): holding the mover mind-movement ('gyu byed 'dzin pa'i yid kyi 'gyu bas) produces past, future, present substantial things, and various karmic ripenings through following [them].

[16229-16235] [PHILOLOGY] Discussions on Classification
**Analysis:** Lines 16229-16230: Memory (dran pa) and various latencies (bag la nyal) are so designated from many causes, conditions, and actions. Lines 16231-16235 present a hypothetical objection and response: If someone thinks saying "mind" (yid) alone suffices and multiple divisions are unreasonable—similarly, one might say "mental factor" (sems byung) alone suffices and dividing into fifty-one is unreasonable. Yet any amount of division and collection is not contradictory depending on the part.

[16236-16244] [CONCEPT] The Pure Space Lamp (dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma)
**Analysis:** The pure space lamp is the collection of light and form arisings ('od dang sku'i 'char byed 'dus pa). It is the pervading deep blue of collected five colors, unchanging, surrounded by a vajra fence, with the vajra chain having no sticking point. Within it, the light-body radiating light-rays appears, and in this dharmata bardo one is completely enlightened. The light-appearance rising vertically, radiating spokes, and as rims causes deluded appearance to self-cease and wisdom to become clear. From these appear light particles, cloth sections, and broken parts—outer and inner space intermingling, with no interval in wisdom.

[16245-16255] [CONCEPT] Progressive Visions in Dharmata Bardo
**Analysis:** Lines 16245-16253 enumerate progressive visions: from that [intermingling] appear: like eye-flesh (mig tshags), many-eyes (mig mangs), many-eyes-patterned (mig mangs ris), net (dra ba), half-net (dra ba phyed pa), flowers, thousand-petaled lotus, castle-stove, and tent-house like a canopy. These make dharmata-appearance the path. Line 16254: The four lamps definitively determine the signs and measures of the path's four appearances. Line 16255: Through the far-reaching [lamp], seeing direct perception dharmata-appearance turns the mind away from holding philosophical tenets as self-existent.
