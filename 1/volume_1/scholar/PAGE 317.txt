[13191-13236] [STRUCTURE] Near-Degeneration (nyams) and Correction
The text presents near-degeneration experiences and their correction. The structure establishes: (1) the three near-degenerations: bliss, clarity, and non-conceptuality, (2) how these become obstacles when fixated upon, (3) the correction through recognition of their empty nature, and (4) the importance of non-attachment to all experiences.

[13191-13212] [PHILOLOGY] Near-Degeneration Terminology
The term nyams (experience/med near-degeneration) has ambivalent meaning—positive experience that can become obstacle. The three nyams: bde ba'i nyams (experience of bliss), gsal ba'i nyams (experience of clarity), mi rtog pa'i nyams (experience of non-conceptuality). The term zhen pa (attachment) identifies the problem. The correction: stong par shes (know as empty).

[13213-13236] [CONTEXT] Experience Dangers in Meditation
The near-degeneration presentation addresses the specific dangers of meditative experiences in Dzogchen. Unlike some traditions that valorize such experiences, Dzogchen treats them as potential obstacles. This reflects the tradition's insistence on recognition over experience and view over state.

[13191-13236] [CONCEPT] Experiences as Empty Display
The text conceptualizes near-degenerations as empty displays of awareness—not to be rejected or pursued. Bliss, clarity, and non-conceptuality are wisdom's play (rol pa) but become obstacles when fixated upon. The correction is recognition—they are known as empty, not denied. This middle way preserves experiences while transcending attachment.
