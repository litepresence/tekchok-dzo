[STRUCTURE] Objects Continued: Word-Meaning, Expansion-Measure, and Self-Radiance
This page completes the detailed exposition of objects for the four lamps, focusing on the second through fourth lamps. The structure follows: (1) shes rab sgron ma's object—tshig don (word and meaning) with hermeneutic method (19783-19799); (2) thig le sgron ma's object—snang ba'i 'phel tshad (measure of appearance-expansion) with sixfold enumeration (19800-19831); (3) dbyings kyi sgron ma's object—'od lnga'i rang gdangs (self-radiance of five lights) with five characteristics (19832-19849). The progression moves from linguistic/conceptual (word-meaning) through quantitative/phenomenological (expansion-measure) to qualitative/ontological (self-radiance), encompassing the full spectrum from conventional to ultimate truth.

[PHILOLOGY] Hermeneutic and Phenomenological Terminology
The shes rab section employs hermeneutic vocabulary: tshig don (word and meaning) as the dyad of linguistic expression; 'brel bar 'dod pa (intended connection) indicating interpretive intention; mtshon pa (indication)—dpe (example), brda mtshon (symbolic indication), tshig gis mtshon pa (literal indication); brjod pas shes pa (knowledge through expression); tha snyad (convention); ngo sprad pa (pointing-out/introduction); 'khrid pa (guidance); la shan dbye ba (distinctive analysis). The thig le section uses quantitative terms: 'phel tshad (measure of expansion), mu khyud (perimeter), ra ba (fence/enclosure), phyed sku (half-kayā—transitional form). The dbyings section uses qualitative terms: stong pa (empty), gsal (clear), sgrib bral (free from obscuration), gdangs phyin (radiance-complete), khyab cing yangs pa (pervasive and vast), gcig 'dus pa (gathered into one).

[CONTEXT] Scriptural Sources and Enumeration Systems
The thig le section cites Thal 'gyur: "thig le'i yul ni kha dog ste / lnga dang drug dang gsum gnyis drug"—the bindu lamp's object is color: five, six, three-two-six. This cryptic enumeration refers to: (1) five colors (white, yellow, red, green, blue); (2) six including kayā-permutations; (3) three (kayā, light, rays) and two (dharmadhātu kayā, rig pa kayā) = six total. The text also references Nam mkha' klong bsal (Space-Blaze Tantra) for an alternative sixfold enumeration based on purified elements: five lights' source, six wisdoms (without fire's heat, water's moisture, etc.). The dbyings section cites de nyid las (from that same source): "stong pa dang / gsal dang sgrib bral gdangs phyin pa / khyab cing yangs pa gcig 'dus pa"—the five characteristics of dharmadhātu.

[CONCEPT] The Phenomenology of Luminous Expansion
The thig le lamp's object reveals a sophisticated theory of 'phel tshad (manifestation-measure)—how pure appearance expands from the bindu-perimeter. The sixfold schema synthesizes: (1) transitional forms (phyed sku—half-kayā, appearing but not fully manifest), (2) complete kayā with light/rays (sku, 'od, zer), (3) dharmic kayā (dbyings kyi sku), (4) awareness kayā (rig pa'i sku), (5) pure ultimate elements as ground (don dam gyi 'byung lnga dag pa), (6) arising-ground with jñāna-nature ('char gzhi ye shes kyi rang bzhin). This is not spatial expansion but gnoseological intensification—the "thickening" of luminosity into apparent form. The bindu-perimeter (mu khyud) functions like a membrane or threshold: inside is concentration, outside is expansion.

[STRUCTURE] The Sixfold Classification of Appearance-Measure
The six-fold 'phel tshad enumeration at 19803-19807:
1. Phyed sku la sogs pa drug pa (sixth as half-kayā etc.)—transitional forms
2. Sku dang 'od dang zer gsum (three—kayā, light, rays)
3. Dbyings kyi sku (dharmadhātu kayā)
4. Rig pa'i sku gnyis (two—awareness kayā)
5. Don dam gyi 'byung lnga dag pa (pure five ultimate elements)
6. 'Char gzhi ye shes kyi rang bzhin (arising-ground with jñāna-nature)

This enumeration is synthetic—elements combine to produce six. The alternative from Nam mkha' klong bsal uses elemental purification: five lights' source, six wisdoms without elemental qualities (fire without heat, water without moisture, etc.), suggesting that wisdom-manifestation transcends yet includes the conditioned elements. The dbyings lamp then reveals this as empty-yet-radiant, like "dust-free sky" (bag rdul dengs pa'i nam mkha')—appearance without substantiality, the ground of purification.

[PHILOLOGY] The Five Characteristics of Dharmadhātu
The dbyings kyi yul (dharmadhātu object) has five characteristics: (1) stong pa (empty—lacking inherent existence), (2) gsal (clear—cognitively luminous), (3) sgrib bral gdangs phyin pa (radiance-complete and free from obscuration), (4) khyab cing yangs pa gcig 'dus pa (pervasive, vast, gathered into one), (5) mnyam rdzogs chos nyid dag pa (equal-complete pure dharmatā). These five parallel the five wisdoms: mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, and dharmadhātu wisdom. The "dust-free sky" (bag rdul dengs pa'i nam mkha') is a classic Dzogchen metaphor—space is not made empty, it is naturally empty; likewise, mind is not purified, it is naturally pure. The "equal-complete" (མཉམ་རྫོགས་) indicates that all phenomena are equally perfect, equally enlightened, equally natural.

[CONCEPT] Word-Meaning as Gnoseological Vehicle
The shes rab lamp's object—tshig don (word and meaning)—establishes that language, properly understood, becomes a vehicle for gnosis. This is not the ordinary use of language for communication but the "meaning-intention" (དགོངས་པ་) of tantric discourse. The hermeneutic process: mtshon pa (indication through example, symbol, word) → brjod pa (expression producing knowledge) → tha snyad (conventional designation) → ngo sprad pa (pointing-out) → 'khrid pa (guidance) → la shan dbye ba (distinctive analysis). This sixfold progression moves from indirect to direct, from conventional to ultimate, from understanding to recognition. The "confidence of understanding" (རྟོགས་པའི་གདེང་) is crucial—it is not intellectual certainty but gnoseological certainty, the unshakeable recognition that words point to what is already present.

[STRUCTURE] The Transition to Supports (Rten)
The page concludes with "gsum pa rten la gnyis las" (third, supports: from two)—indicating the next section will discuss the supports (rten) of the four lamps. This tripartite structure (characteristics, objects, supports) follows classical Tibetan exposition: first what something is (mtshan nyid), then what it relates to (yul), then what holds it (rten). The supports will likely discuss the bodily locations—channels, cakras, energetic centers—where the lamps manifest. This architectural approach treats the subtle body as the temple of enlightenment, with each lamp occupying its specific location in the sacred geography of the practitioner.
