[6941-6985] [STRUCTURE] Empowerment Benefits and Prerequisites

[6941-6976] **Certain Result of Proper Supplication:**
When preliminary supplication (*smon lam*) and service are performed properly with yearning to obtain empowerment, signs of accomplished guru appear in dreams:
- Explaining Dharma (*chos 'chad pa*)
- Giving prophecies (*lung ston pa*)
- And other auspicious indications

[6977-6985] **Definite Result of Fruition:**
Through such prior supplication and serving the teacher, all wishes are fulfilled like wish-fulfilling jewels (*nor bu*) and wish-fulfilling trees (*dpag bsam shing*). Quoting *Thal 'gyur*:
"From that service, qualities like wish-fulfilling trees, wish-fulfilling jewels, and wish-fulfilling cows—immeasurable qualities are obtained. Focusing on that, serve the teacher to turn back from cyclic existence' battle."

[7024-7087] [CONTEXT] Defects of Not Receiving Empowerment

**From *Rang shar*:**
Without empowerment:
- Bewilderment in bardo (*bar do la bred pa*)
- Fear (*spangs pa*)
- Terror (*rdugs pa*)
- Obstructions (*thogs pa*)
- Loss of perception (*'du shes shor ba*)

Until leaving the karmic body (*bag chags kyi lus*), one is:
- Not regarded as venerable by beings (*'gro ba rnams kyis bkur ba'i 'os su mi mthong*)
- Little merit (*bsod nams chung*)
- Short life (*tshe thung*)
- Few enjoyments (*'tsho ba'i longs spyod nyung*)
- Narrow mouth (*kha nyen*)
- Many obstacles (*bar chad mang po*)
- No accomplishment in activities (*bya ba thams cad mi 'grub*)

**From *Dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud*:**
"Without relying on Secret Mantra empowerment, accomplishment is impossible. Like a boatman without hands cannot ferry across the river."

**Critical Point:**
Without empowerment, even a Buddha cannot turn the Dharma wheel (*chos kyi 'khor lo bskor*) at the Tathāgata level, and without turning the wheel, compassionate emanation cannot benefit beings.

[7088-7171] [CONCEPT] Places, Times, and Auspicious Connections

**Empowerment Locations:**
Four categories based on empowerment type:
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): Directions based on student's element
   - Earth: south-facing, protected north
   - Water: east-facing, protected west  
   - Fire: west-facing, protected east
   - Wind: north-facing, protected south

2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): Dense forest interiors matching student's element shapes and signs

3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): Confluence of three valleys at mountain peak ridge

4. **Utterly without elaboration** (*rab tu spras med*): Complete solitude (*rab tu dben pa*), hermitage one *rgyang grags* (distance of arrow-flight sound) from village

**General Requirements:**
All locations should have:
- Fierce creatures (*gcang gzan ma rungs pa*)
- Poisonous snakes (*sbrul gdug pa*)
- Charnel grounds (*dur khrod*)
- Violent ḍākinīs (*mkha' 'gro ma rab tu mi bsrung*)

Quoting *Rdzogs pa rang byung*:
"In great cities' centers, yogins cannot accomplish purpose. In villages and towns' border areas, forests or rocky valleys, yogins enter empowerment's meaning."

**Specific Site Characteristics:**
- West-facing, high in east
- South low like north
- Self's perceptual direction east
- No holes or sand
- No forms before
- No sentient-like appearances
- Back to rocks
- Fruit trees on sides
