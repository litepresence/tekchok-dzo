[14138-14171] [STRUCTURE] Kun 'Dar Ma: Mind Channel
The text presents kun 'dar ma as the channel of mind and non-dual wisdom. The structure establishes: (1) kun 'dar ma generating mind, (2) channel location affecting thought patterns, and (3) branches affecting cognitive qualities.

[14138-14171] [PHILOLOGY] Mind Channel Terminology
The term kun 'dar ma (all-moving channel) describes its pervasive nature. The compound yid skyes (mind generated) establishes its cognitive function. The phrase blo gros (intelligence/discernment) identifies mental clarity.

[14138-14171] [CONTEXT] Mind-Channel Correspondence
The text presents the correspondence between channel structure and mental qualities. Channel position affects thought stability; branches affect cognitive range. This reflects the Buddhist understanding of mind as dependent on physical conditions.

[14138-14171] [CONCEPT] Mind as Channel Flow
The text conceptualizes mind as the flow through the kun 'dar ma channel. Thoughts are movements of wind in channels; when wind is still, mind is clear. The channel is thus the physical basis for both ordinary mind and enlightened wisdom.
