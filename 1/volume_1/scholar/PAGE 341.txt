[13951-13986] [STRUCTURE] Three Principal Channels Introduction
The text presents the three principal channels (rtsa'i gtso mo gsum) according to the Thal 'gyur. The structure establishes: (1) channels as the body's vital points, (2) 72,000 channels summarized as 472, and (3) the three channels as the life-tree of all channels.

[13951-13986] [PHILOLOGY] Principal Channel Terminology
The term rtsa'i gtso mo gsum (three principal channels) identifies ro ma, rkyang ma, and kun 'dar ma. The compound sku gsung thugs gsum (three vajras of body, speech, and mind) establishes the correspondence with enlightened dimensions. The phrase a om hum (three seed syllables) identifies the sonic basis.

[13951-13986] [CONTEXT] Nāḍī System
The text presents the classical tantric nāḍī system adapted to Dzogchen. The three principal channels represent the central energetic pathways. This reflects Indian yogic physiology integrated with Buddhist enlightenment theory.

[13951-13986] [CONCEPT] Channels as Three Vajras
The text conceptualizes the three channels as the three vajras. Ro ma is body vajra, rkyang ma is speech vajra, kun 'dar ma is mind vajra. When purified, these become the three kāyas; when impure, they produce body, speech, and mind.
