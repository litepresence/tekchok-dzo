[13752-13787] [STRUCTURE] Channel Vital Points and Death Signs
The text presents channel vital points (rtsa'i gnad) and the signs of death. The structure establishes: (1) recognizing the channel nature through settling, (2) knowing death and transmigration through channel movement, and (3) non-separation from samādhi through channel dissolution.

[13752-13787] [PHILOLOGY] Channel Point Terminology
The term rtsa'i gnad (channel vital point) identifies key energetic locations. The compound 'chi 'pho dang skye gnas (death and birthplace) describes the transition between lives. The phrase ting nge 'dzin gyi 'khor lo (wheel of samādhi) establishes meditation as continuous.

[13752-13787] [CONTEXT] Death Yoga
The text presents death yoga where channel knowledge enables recognition of the death process. The ability to recognize channel movements as death signs prepares for conscious dying. This reflects the Buddhist practice of using death as opportunity.

[13752-13787] [CONCEPT] Death as Channel Transition
The text conceptualizes death not as cessation but as channel transition. When channels dissolve, consciousness transfers; when recognized, this becomes awakening. The same process that produces ordinary rebirth can produce enlightenment.
