[12047-12086] [STRUCTURE] Qualities of Buddha and Recognition's Result
The text analyzes the qualities of buddhahood resulting from recognition. The structure presents: (1) the accumulation of merit (tshogs) as spontaneously perfect through non-conceptual recognition, (2) the simultaneous cessation (sangs) of non-recognition and obscurations, (3) the distinction between the qualities of the expanse (dbyings kyi yon tan) as potentials and the qualities of buddhahood (sangs rgyas kyi yon tan) as manifest, (4) the six characteristics of Samantabhadra's awakening elaborated, (5) the three modes of self-arisen realization: not arising from cause, not arising from mind, not arising from scripture. The passage establishes the ontological status of buddha-qualities as simultaneously inherent and recognized.

[12047-12086] [PHILOLOGY] Quality and Cessation Terminology
The passage employs technical terminology for qualities: yon tan (quality/guṇa), dbyings kyi yon tan (expanse qualities), sangs rgyas kyi yon tan (buddha qualities). The term sangs pa (cessation/purification) functions doubly: as the verb "to cease" and as component of buddha (sangs rgyas—one who has ceased/purified). The compound zag med (outflow-free) characterizes the accumulation of merit as transcending ordinary conditioned virtue. The particle ni yod la...ma mngon pa'i phyir (existing yet not manifest) establishes the ontological status of potential qualities. The phrase mthar phyin (arrived at completion) qualifies the ground of liberation.

[12047-12086] [CONTEXT] Pramāṇa and Buddha-Quality Theory
The discussion of expanse qualities versus buddha qualities reflects Indian pramāṇa (epistemology) discussions of potential versus actual qualities. The Sautrāntika and Yogācāra distinction between qualities as existent yet unmanifest (dbyings kyi yon tan) and qualities as manifest through conditions (sangs rgyas kyi yon tan) provides the philosophical background. The Sgron ma 'bar ba'i rgyud (Lamp Illumination Tantra) citation establishes textual authority for the transformation of basis into result through wisdom.

[12047-12086] [CONCEPT] Inherent Yet Recognized Qualities
The conceptual framework establishes that buddha-qualities are simultaneously inherent in the expanse and made manifest through recognition. This resolves the paradox of how qualities can be both primordially present yet appear to be newly acquired. The framework employs three temporal modalities: (1) qualities as inherent potentials in the expanse (dbyings kyi yon tan), present yet unmanifest like unstruck sound, (2) qualities as manifest through the power of cessation (sangs stobs) at the completion of realization (mthar phyin), (3) qualities as the spontaneous presence of the basis (lhundrub) versus the manifest result (mngon gyur grub). The six characteristics establish that liberation is not a transformation of the basis but a recognition of its inherent perfection. The three non-arisings (not from cause, not from mind, not from scripture) establish that recognition is self-arisen wisdom (rang byung ye shes) transcending causal, psychological, and hermeneutical dependence.
