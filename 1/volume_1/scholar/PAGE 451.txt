[19167-19225] [STRUCTURE] ## Continuation: The Thirteen Bodies—Completion of Enumeration
**Analysis:** Lines 19167-19225 complete the enumeration of the thirteen bodies (*sku bcu gsum*) introduced on previous pages. The section begins with the conclusion of the "unchanging vajra body" (*mi 'gyur ba rdo rje'i sku*) and continues through the remaining bodies: purity-bliss body, mistaken-mind body, liberation-through-seeing body, single-thigle body, uninterrupted space body, non-falling sun-moon body, and non-attachment self-liberation body.

[19167-19225] [PHILOLOGY] **Scribal Variant Note:**
Line 19167 *ma bsags pa'i tshogs so/* appears to be a concluding phrase from a previous section ("the unaccumulated collections"), while line 19168 *de ni mi 'gyur ba rdo rje'i sku'o/* properly begins the next body category. This may indicate a pagination overlap in the manuscript tradition.

[19167-19225] [CONCEPT] **The Three Bodies of Purity, Bliss, and Universality:**
Lines 19182-19191 present the "purity-bliss body" (*dag pa bde ba'i sku*) through a series of all-pervasive (*khyab*) qualities:

- *gsal ma mkha' khyab/*: Clarity pervading space
- *stong pa kun khyab/*: Emptiness pervading all
- *ye shes mig khyab/*: Wisdom pervading the eyes
- *rig pa lus khyab/*: Rigpa pervading the body
- *sgron ma yul khyab/*: Lamps pervading objects
- *chos sku gzhis khyab/*: Dharmakaya pervading the ground
- *longs sku rang khyab/*: Sambhogakaya pervading self
- *sprul sku kun khyab/*: Nirmanakaya pervading all
- *'od lnga gnas khyab po/*: Five lights pervading locations

The repetition of *khyab* (pervade) emphasizes the non-localized, all-encompassing nature of this body—not a spatial entity but an omnipresent field of pure bliss.

[19167-19225] [CONCEPT] **The Mistaken-Mind Body (*log pa sems kyi sku*):**
Lines 19192-19198 present the samsaric counterpart:
- *sna tshogs 'byung ba/*: Various arisings
- *sna tshogs sdud pa/*: Various gatherings
- *thams cad kyi lam/*: The path of all
- *thams cad kyi gnas/*: The abode of all
- *thams cad kyi gzhi/*: The basis of all
- *'khor ba rang ka ma'o/*: Samsara itself

This "body" is not ultimately existent but represents the misrecognition of the ground's display as separate, dualistic phenomena.

[19167-19225] [CONCEPT] **The Liberation-through-Seeing Body (*mthong ba rang grol gyi sku*):**
Lines 19199-19211 present paradoxical pairs:
- *mi 'gyur te 'gyu ba/*: Unchanging yet moving
- *'gyu ste mi 'gyu ba/*: Moving yet unchanging
- *srog med pa'i sku/*: Body without life-force
- *sems med pa'i sems can/*: Sentient being without mind
- *dbugs med pa'i 'gyu ba/*: Movement without breath
- *'gro 'ong med pa'i sangs rgyas/*: Buddha without coming or going

These paradoxes deconstruct conventional categories, pointing to liberation not as attainment but as recognition.

[19167-19225] [STRUCTURE] ## Completion of Thirteen Bodies
**Analysis:** Lines 19212-19225 present the final bodies. The "single thigle body" (*gcig pa thig le'i sku*, 19212-19220) enumerates seven wisdoms (*ye shes bdun*) as "arising-all-pervading" (*'byung ba kun khyab*):
1. Wisdom of arising-all-pervading elements
2. Wisdom of arising-all-appearing elements
3. Wisdom of arising-all-arising elements
4. Wisdom of arising-all-clear elements
5. Wisdom of arising-depth-clear elements
6. Wisdom of arising-space-clear elements
7. Wisdom of arising-self-arisen elements

These seven map the progressive recognition of the single thigle as the ground of all manifestation.

[19167-19225] [CONTEXT] **The *Rang shar* Continuation:**
The passage draws from the *Rang shar* (Self-Arising) tantra, a fundamental *Thal 'gyur* source. The sevenfold enumeration reflects this tantra's emphasis on spontaneous (*rang byung*) arising without causal conditions.
