[1173-1174] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Confirmation: Abhisamayālaṃkāra
**Analysis:**

**Source:** *'grel chung* — Short Commentary (referring to the *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* or its commentaries).

**Citation Content:** All god races (*lha'i rigs thams cad*) come near — confirming that beings from all divine realms can approach and recognize the Buddha's presence.

**Doxographical Significance:** This citation from the *prajñāpāramitā* commentarial tradition establishes the superiority of Buddha-nature over even the highest god-realms, a key Mahāyāna tenet.

[1175-1181] [STRUCTURE] Transition to the Form Realm (*gzugs kyi khams*)
**Analysis:**

**Spatial Descent:** 20,000 leagues below Infinite Space (*nam mkha' mtha' yas*)

**The Highest Form Heaven:** *rin po che mching bu rnam par bkod pa* — "Jewel Ornament Various Arrangement"

**Characteristics:**
- Five lights (*'od lnga*) appear clearly (*zang thal du snang ba*)
- No outside/inside (*phyi nang med par*)
- Consciousness masses (*shes pa dum bu*) from above become one

**Etymological Analysis of 'Og Min (Akanistha):**

The name derives from:
- Compared to formless above: It is "below" (*'og*)
- Compared to desire/form below: It is "not below" (*min*)
- Existential position: At the peak (*rtse mo*) of all form-possessors (*gzugs can kun gyi*)

**Philosophical Significance:** 'Og min represents the threshold between:
- Formless absorption (pure consciousness)
- Form realm (subtle manifestation)
- It embodies the "highest" (*kanistha* superlative) of conditioned existence before transcending entirely.

[1182-1183] [PHILOLOGY] The Form Realm Body: A Qualitative Distinction
**Analysis:**

**Distinction from Lower Realms:**
Unlike the four limitless āyatanas (*skye mched mu bzhi*) where consciousness-emanation bodies cannot be seen by ordinary eye-consciousness (*mig shes phal pas bltar med pa*), the 'Og min body is distinguished (*khyad par du phye*).

**Body Composition:**
- *rnam shes dang ba* — Clear/pure consciousness
- *phyi 'od kyi lus* — External light-body

**Analogies:**
- *ri mo'i rnam pa* — Like a picture/form
- *'ja' tshon gyi gzugs* — Like a rainbow body

**Dzogchen Connection:** The rainbow body analogy (*'ja' lus*) anticipates Dzogchen's highest attainment, suggesting Longchenpa's implicit mapping of Buddhist cosmology onto the path to liberation.

[1184-1185] [CONCEPT] Dimensions and Lifespan of 'Og Min
**Analysis:**

**Body Size:** 16,000 leagues (*dpag tshad khri drug stong*)
**Lifespan:** 6,000 intermediate eons (*bar bskal khri drug stong*)

**Pattern Recognition:** The 6:6 ratio (6,000 leagues : 6,000 eons) suggests numerical correspondence between spatial and temporal magnitude in form realm cosmology.

[1186-1193] [CONTEXT] The Second Form Heaven: Clear Sight
**Analysis:**

**Calculation Method:** Using Jambudvīpa as reference point to determine spatial intervals.

**Heaven Name:** *rin po che mthon mthing gis rnam par spras pa* — "Variously Ornamented by Jewel Deep Blue"

**Arising Mechanism:** Some latent consciousness (*bag la nyal ba*) falls from above realms and expands.

**Etymology:** *shin tu mthong* (Extremely See/Clear Sight) because:
- Joy (*dga' ba*) exceeds when one sees another (*gcig gis mthong na*)
- Higher clarity of perception than lower realms

**Dimensions:**
- Body: 8,000 leagues
- Lifespan: 8,000 intermediate eons

**Inverse Pattern:** Notice the lifespan increases (6,000 → 8,000) as we descend from 'Og min, reversing the formless realm pattern where lifespans decreased with subtlety.

[1194-1198] [PHILOLOGY] The Third and Fourth Form Heavens
**Analysis:**

**Third Heaven:** *rin po che rabs mdzes* — "Jewel Supreme Beauty"
- Arising: Immeasurable beings expanded from above appear
- Name: *gya nom snang ba* — Excellent Appearance
- Etymology: Marks (*chas*) exceed (*phul du gyur ba*) those below
- Dimensions: 4,000 leagues body, 4,000 eons lifespan

**Fourth Heaven:** *rin po che ze ba smu gu* — "Jewel Hair Fine"
- Arising: Consciousness expands near from above
- Name: *mi gdung ba* — Not Sorrow/Free from Suffering
- Population: Many beings expand (*'gro ba mang du 'phel ba*)

**Numerical Pattern:** The consistent ratio (body size = lifespan in thousands of leagues/eons) demonstrates the systematic nature of Buddhist cosmological calculations.

**Structural Transition:** Longchenpa continues the descending enumeration of form realm heavens, with each successive level representing greater "grossness" of form, longer lifespans, and increased capacity for sense-contact, moving toward the transition to the desire realm.
