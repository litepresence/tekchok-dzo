[CONTEXT] Citations, History, and Doxography
================================================================================

[3049-3052] [CONTEXT] **Interpretation of Nirvāṇa**: The text clarifies that in the Illusion-like Ultimate view, "nirvāṇa" refers to the form bodies (gzugs sku = rūpakāya) through which Buddhas perform activities. Higher than this is the suchness of self-cognizing awareness and the supreme dharmakāya. This distinction reflects the trikāya (three bodies) doctrine: Nirmāṇakāya (emanation body), Saṃbhogakāya (enjoyment body), and Dharmakāya (truth body).

[3053-3056] [CONTEXT] **Svātantrika Sub-classifications**: Tibetan doxographers identify multiple ways of asserting illusion-like nature:
1. **sgyu ma rigs grub tu 'dod pa**: Illusion established by reasoning/logic
2. **sgyu ma ltar snang du 'dod pa**: Appearing in the manner of illusion
3. **sgyu ma tsam por 'dod pa**: Only as illusion, mere illusion

These represent progressively more refined positions, with the "mere illusion" view being closer to Prāsaṅgika.

[3057-3076] [CONTEXT] **Higher Svātantrika (Rang rgyud gong ma ba)**: Also called "non-abiding Svātantrika" or "Prāsaṅgika-like Svātantrika." Associated with later Indian masters like Jñānaśrībhadra and some Tibetan interpreters. This school:
- Does not even abide in the illusion-like ultimate
- Refutes all positions including conventional establishments
- Is closer to Prāsaṅgika while still using svātantrika methods

[3059] [CONTEXT] **Son of a Barren Woman (mo gsham gyi bu)**: This is the classical Indian philosophical example of absolute impossibility. In the *Pramāṇavārttika*, Dharmakīrti uses this to illustrate that if the cause doesn't exist, the effect cannot exist. Here it's applied: if objects and aspects don't exist, the self-cognizing awareness that cognizes their absence also cannot be established.

[3061-3062] [CONTEXT] **Dream Analogy**: When you wake from a dream, the dream appearances (horse, ox) cease. But since they never truly existed from the start (dang po med pas), there is no real cessation (don la 'gag rgyur ma grub pa). This illustrates the Prāsaṅgika view that saṃsāra is not truly something that needs to be "stopped"—it never truly existed.

[3064-3067] [CONTEXT] **Aṣṭasāhasrikā Citation (continued)**: This verse from the Perfection of Wisdom sūtra establishes the emptiness even of emptiness. If emptiness itself were truly existent, it would be a reification. The text says emptiness is only a verbal designation (tshig gi bla dgas tsam) — a finger pointing at the moon, not the moon itself.

[3068-3076] [CONTEXT] **Eight-fold Non-abiding**: The "higher" Svātantrika establishes eight types of non-abiding:
1. Not abiding in conventional existence
2. Not abiding in reasons/characteristics
3. Not abiding in exclusion aspects
4. Not abiding in differentiators
5. Not abiding in unity
6. Not abiding in multiplicity
7. Not abiding in being free from one and many
8. Not abiding even in mere appearance

This thorough-going negation prepares the ground for Prāsaṅgika.

[3077-3086] [CONTEXT] **Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka**: Founded by Buddhapālita (c. 470-540 CE), developed by Candrakīrti (c. 600-650 CE). The name means "consequentialist" — they use reductio ad absurdum arguments rather than autonomous syllogisms. Key texts: Candrakīrti's *Prasannapadā* (commentary on Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*).

[3078-3080] [CONTEXT] **Prāsaṅgika Distinctive Tenets**:
- No autonomous inferences (rang rgyud kyi gtan tshigs)
- No inherent existence even conventionally
- No self-cognizing awareness (rang rig)
- No ālaya-vijñāna (kun gzhi) in the Cittamātra sense
- No acceptance (khas len) of any position

[3081-3086] [CONTEXT] **Samādhirāja Sūtra Citation**: This sūtra (King of Samādhi Sūtra) is one of the most important texts for Prāsaṅgika. The verse cited is the famous "eight extremes" passage. Not only are permanent/impermanent and existence/non-existence extremes, but even "the middle" (dbus) is not to be abided in. This is the perfection of the Middle Way.

================================================================================
[CONCEPT] Breaking Down Complex Ideas
================================================================================

[3049-3052] [CONCEPT] **The Form Body as Nirvāṇa**: The text makes a crucial distinction:

1. **Nirvāṇa as Activity**: When we say Buddhas "attain nirvāṇa," we often mean they manifest form bodies (rūpakāya) and perform activities for beings. This is the conventional meaning of nirvāṇa.

2. **Nirvāṇa as Suchness**: Higher than this is the suchness (de bzhin nyid) realized by self-cognizing awareness — the ultimate nature.

3. **Nirvāṇa as Dharmakāya**: Supreme is the dharmakāya itself, beyond all description.

**Why This Matters**: Many Buddhists think of nirvāṇa as a "place" or "state" to attain. This analysis shows that:
- The form bodies are manifestations, not the ultimate
- The ultimate is not "something else" but the nature of things as they are
- True nirvāṇa is not "attained" but recognized

[3053-3058] [CONCEPT] **Levels of Understanding Illusion**: The text reveals progressive understandings of the illusion analogy:

1. **Lower**: Illusion established by reasoning (rigs grub) — logically proven to be like illusion
2. **Middle**: Appearing as illusion (ltar snang) — directly perceived as illusion-like
3. **Higher**: Mere illusion (tsam po) — only illusion, nothing else at all

**Progression**: Like learning about fire:
- First, you read that fire burns (established by reasoning)
- Then you see fire from a distance (appearing as)
- Finally, you experience the burning (mere fire)

Each level is closer to direct realization.

[3059-3062] [CONCEPT] **The Logic of Non-existence**: This is one of the most sophisticated arguments in Madhyamaka:

**The Argument**:
1. If there is no object (yul med pa), there can be no consciousness of the object's absence
2. Example: If there is no son of a barren woman, there can be no cognition of "this is not the son of a barren woman"
3. Therefore, the self-cognizing awareness that supposedly knows the absence of objects cannot exist

**What's Being Said**: You cannot have a cognition of "non-X" unless X at least has some conceptual or conventional status. Absolute non-existence cannot be cognized. This undermines the Cittamātra's self-cognizing awareness that knows the emptiness of objects.

[3060-3062] [CONCEPT] **The Dream-Waking Analogy**: When you wake up, the dream stops. But ask yourself:

- Did the dream "go" somewhere?
- Is there a "place" where dream-horses dwell after waking?
- Was there a moment when the dream "ceased"?

The answer to all is "no." The dream never truly existed, so there's nothing to cease. This is how saṃsāra is — it appears, but since it never truly existed, Buddhahood is not the "cessation" of something real but the recognition of what was always the case.

[3064-3067] [CONCEPT] **The Emptiness of Emptiness**: This is crucial:

- If emptiness were truly existent, it would be permanent
- If emptiness were non-existent, nothing would be empty
- Therefore emptiness itself is empty — only a verbal designation

**Common Misunderstanding**: People think "emptiness" is a thing, a reality, the "true nature." This view reifies emptiness. The text says: emptiness is just a word (tshig) used to designate (bla dgas) — like the word "unicorn" designates something without existence.

**Practical Implication**: Don't cling to "emptiness" as your view. Any view, even the view of emptiness, is an obstruction.

[3068-3076] [CONCEPT] **The Eight-fold Non-abiding**: The higher Svātantrika refuses to abide anywhere:

1. **Not in conventional existence**: Don't reify the conventional
2. **Not in reasons**: Don't cling to logic
3. **Not in exclusions**: Don't depend on differentiation
4. **Not in differentiators**: No stable categories
5. **Not in unity**: Don't say "all is one"
6. **Not in multiplicity**: Don't say "all is many"
7. **Not in freedom from both**: Don't make "beyond one and many" a position
8. **Not in mere appearance**: Even "mere appearance" is not a refuge

**Why So Thorough?**: Because any position (khas len) becomes a place of attachment. Even "I don't have a position" becomes a position. The only solution is complete openness.

[3077-3086] [CONCEPT] **Prāsaṅgika: The Ultimate Refutation**: Prāsaṅgika goes beyond Svātantrika in key ways:

**Svātantrika**: Uses autonomous syllogisms — "Sound is impermanent because it is produced, like a pot"
- Establishes conventions with inherent characteristics
- Emptiness is found through analysis

**Prāsaṅgika**: Uses consequences — "If sound were permanent, it would be unchanging, but it changes"
- No conventions have inherent characteristics
- Emptiness is not "found" but is the absence of what was never there
- No positions whatsoever (khas len thams cad dang bral ba)

**The Samādhirāja Verse**: "Not abiding even in the middle" means:
- Permanent and impermanent are extremes
- Existence and non-existence are extremes
- "The middle" is also an extreme if made into a position
- The wise one doesn't even abide in non-abiding

**Key Insight**: The Middle Way is not a "place" between extremes — it's freedom from the very framework that creates extremes. Like asking "Is silence loud or quiet?" — silence transcends the category.

SCHOLAR NOTES
================================================================================

- The transition from Svātantrika to Prāsaṅgika is one of the most debated topics in Tibetan Buddhism
- Tsongkhapa's interpretation (which this follows) sees Prāsaṅgika as higher because it completely avoids inherent existence even conventionally
- The Samādhirāja Sūtra is extensively quoted by Candrakīrti in the Prasannapadā
- The eight non-abidings are analyzed in detail in Tsongkhapa's *Lam rim chen mo*
- Longchenpa's presentation here reflects the Nyingma school's acceptance of Prāsaṅgika as the highest philosophical view
