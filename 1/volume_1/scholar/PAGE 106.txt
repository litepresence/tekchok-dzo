[3915-3921] [CONCEPT] Two Views: Appearance-Imputation and Mind-Realization
**Analysis:** Lines 3915-3921 present the two view subdivisions:

**Appearance-Imputation View [3915-3917]:**
- Essence: no dharmas, no Buddha name
- Nature: potency arises, samsara-nirvana view arises
- Characteristics: not definitively one, view-meditation measureless

**Mind-Realization View [3918-3921]:**
- Essence: unproduced, completely pure
- Afflictions self-place liberated
- Nature: unceasing, universally arising
- No acceptance-rejection
- Characteristics: causeless, primordially liberated
- Samsara-nirvana path exhausted

[3922-3949] [CONCEPT] Obstacle Clearing and Six Stages
**Analysis:** Lines 3922-3949 present the severance obstacle clearing:

**Essence [3922-3925]:**
- Dharmatā crucial clearing
- Samsara-nirvana middle split
- Nature non-compressed ground penetrated
- No mind-son composition
- Characteristics: causeless ground pure
- Delusion self-immediately cleared

**Two Divisions [3926-3928]:**
- View-meditation heat obstacle clearing
- Entity abiding obstacle clearing

**Six Stages Detailed [3929-3949]:**

*View Three Stages:*
1. Moving: Samsara dharmatā recognized like thief [3931]
2. Obtained: Body-speech heat arises like fire-wood [3932-3933]
3. Stable: Samsara side split like army victory [3934-3935]

*Meditation Three Stages:*
4. Moving: Wind-mind rich-entered like rich treasury [3936-3937]
5. Obtained: Mind path-entered like pig in ravine [3938-3939]
6. Stable: Awareness power obtained like royal empowerment [3940]

*Conduct Three Stages:*
7. Moving: Consciousness reference lost, heart-wind agitation [3941]
8. Obtained: Delusion-appearance suppressed like garuda wing [3942-3943]
9. Stable: Three bodies heat obtained like Brahmin woman [3944-3945]

**Conclusion [3946-3949]:**
- Conduct clears appearance, appearance-condition no go-place in dharmatā
- Meditation moving obstacle cleared, recollection-thought samadhi no go
- View dharmatā obstacle cleared, not depending on dharmas, become Buddha
- Entity abiding: dharmatā unfabricated, whatever appears not non-mind
