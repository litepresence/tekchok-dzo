[14964-15000] [STRUCTURE] Three Kāyas Result Presentation
The text presents the three kāyas (sku gsum) as the fruition of practice. The structure establishes: (1) thirty-eight channels of the body kāya, (2) twenty channels of rigpa, and (3) thirty-two thigle channels completing the system.

[14964-15000] [PHILOLOGY] Kāya Terminology
The term sku yi sum cu rtsa brgyad (thirty-eight body channels) identifies the physical dimension. The compound rig pa'i rtsa nyi shu (twenty rigpa channels) establishes the awareness dimension. The phrase thig le'i rtsa sum cu rtsa gnyis (thirty-two thigle channels) completes the triad.

[14964-15000] [CONTEXT] Kāya Manifestation
The text presents the three kāyas as manifesting through specific channel groups. The body channels become nirmāṇakāya, the rigpa channels become saṃbhogakāya, the thigle channels become dharmakāya. This is the fruition of channel practice.

[14964-15000] [CONCEPT] Kāyas as Channel States
The text conceptualizes the three kāyas not as external achievements but as channel states. When channels are pure, the kāyas manifest naturally. The three kāyas are already present; practice reveals what is already so.
