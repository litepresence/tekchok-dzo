[9911-9970] [PHILOLOGY] Ground and Path Relationship

**Ground as Basis:**
Ground not path—path arises from ground.
Ground not result—result manifests ground.

From *De nyid*:
"Ground not path
Path from ground arises
Ground not result
Result manifests ground
Basis thus"

**Path's Relation:**
Path does not create ground—path reveals ground.
Path does not change ground—path recognizes ground.

From *Rang shar*:
"Path not creates ground
Path reveals ground
Path not changes ground
Path recognizes ground
Path thus"

**Result's Relation:**
Result not separate from ground—ground's self-expression.
Result not added to ground—ground's natural perfection.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Result not separate
From ground self-expression
Result not added
Ground natural perfection
Result thus"

[9971-10030] [CONTEXT] Ground Beyond Effort

**No Need for Effort:**
Ground naturally perfect—no need to create.
Ground primordially pure—no need to purify.
Ground spontaneously present—no need to accomplish.

Spontaneously present
Effortless thus"

**Why Practice Then?**
Practice not to create ground—practice to recognize ground.
Practice not to change ground—practice to manifest ground.

From *Rang shar*:
"Practice not creates
Practice recognizes
Practice not changes
Practice manifests
Practice purpose thus"

**Delusion and Recognition:**
Delusion: not knowing ground.
