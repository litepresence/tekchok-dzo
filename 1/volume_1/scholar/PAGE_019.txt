[615-622] [STRUCTURE] # The Thal-ba'i be-con Field
**Analysis:** The fifth field, Thal-ba'i be-con (Thal's Club/Mace), appears:
- **Location:** Above this world, beyond nineteen worlds (*bcu dgu 'das pa'i yang steng na*)
- **Adornment:** Extremely beautiful, ornamented with various jewel fragments, piled in heaps
- **Function:** Teacher's teaching possesses the two completions, adorned with skull-garland arrangement

The "nineteen worlds" (*bcu dgu*) suggests a specific cosmological calculation—likely referring to the realms below the fourth dhyāna. The skull-garland (*thod pa'i phreng ba*) indicates this is a cremation-ground field (*dur khrod*), associated with wrathful practice.

[615-622] [CONTEXT] # Cremation Ground Symbolism
**Analysis:** The skull-garland imagery connects to:
- **Cakrasaṃvara maṇḍala:** Eight cremation grounds as outer boundaries
- **Chöd practice:** Visualization of charnel grounds
- **Dzogchen:** The dissolution of fixation in the "groundless ground"

The "two completions" (*rdzogs gnyis ldan*) likely refers to the completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) of both father (*pha rgyud*) and mother (*ma rgyud*) tantras.

[623-634] [STRUCTURE] # The Remaining Thal Fields
**Analysis:** The text continues describing additional fields:

**Thal-ba'i rgyun (Thal of Stream):**
- **Location:** Northeast interval (*byang shar mtshams*)
- **Shape:** Caitya-configuration (*mchod rten dbyibs*), beautiful tiered structure
- **Adornment:** Five arrangements completely ornamented
- **Function:** Source of various sound-melodies, teaching of temporal arising

**Thal-ba rgyas (Expanded Thal):**
- **Location:** Above, at twenty-one (*de steng nyi shu rtsa gcig na*)
- **Characteristics:** Extremely pervasive (*rab tu thal bas khyab*), nature of pure perception
- **Appearance:** External and internal completely open/scattered
- **Function:** Demonstrates the arising of teaching, completely pervading causal conditions

[623-634] [PHILOLOGY] The Particle *kyis* as Instrumental
**Analysis:** The phrase *bkod pa lnga yis yongs su spras* (completely ornamented by five arrangements) uses *yis* (instrumental) to indicate means. The construction *rab tu thal bas khyab* (extremely pervading with thal) uses the instrumental *bas* to indicate manner. The verb *'byung* (arise) in *'byung ba ston* (demonstrates arising) establishes the teaching function: these fields DEMONSTRATE the principles they embody.

[635-643] [CONTEXT] # The Southeast Field: Thal-ba's Sound
**Analysis:** The sGra thal 'gyur verses continue, describing fields in the intermediate directions. The southeast (*lho shar g.yon* = south-east-left) at six transcendent realms (*'jig rten khams drug 'das*) features "Thal-ba's sound" (*thal ba'i sgra*). The description follows classical *snyan ngag* conventions:

- **Protector-benefactor** (*skyob byed 'phan*) completely surrounded
- **Victory banners and parasols** (*rgyal mtshan gdugs*) raised
- **Flower-rain and fragrances** (*me tog sil ma'i char dang dri*)
- **Teacher, teaching, and beautiful assembly** surrounded
- **Bliss-play arising** (*bde ba'i rol pa 'byung*)

The compound *mdzes byed gzugs brnyan* (beautiful-makers/reflections) indicates the self-radiant nature of appearances in the pure lands.

[644-657] [CONTEXT] # The Southwest Field: Thal-ba's Wind
**Analysis:** The southwest (*lho nub g.yas* = south-west-right) below six realms features "Thal-ba's wind" (*thal ba'i rlung*):

- Movement and agitation in intermediate space (*bar snang*)
- Mutual movement and hovering (*phan tshun g.yo zhing lding ba*)
- Sounds arising from movement
- Teaching moved by wind (*ston pa'i bstan pa rlung gis g.yo*)
- "Five-possessing, three entering" (*lnga ldan 'jug pa gsum*) — likely referring to the five elements/aggregates and the three doors

At the summit thirteen stacked (*bcu gsum brtsigs pa*), "Jewel Thal-ba" (*rin chen thal ba*) appears, adorned with:
- Auspicious solar rays (*bkra shis nyi ma*)
- Desire's qualities (*'dod pa'i yon tan*)
- Miraculous letters (*'phrul gyi yi ge*)
- Lotus eyes of lda-ldi (*lda ldi padma'i spyan*)

[658-672] [CONTEXT] # West-North Field: Taming Thal-ba
**Analysis:** The west-north interval (*nub byang mtshams*) at six world-systems features "Taming Thal-ba" (*'dul ba'i thal ba*):

- Goddess included in complete offering (*mchod pa rdzogs pas lha mo dang bcas*)
- Light-filled with sandalwood fragrance (*'od kyis kheng dang tsan dan dri*)
- Teaching equal in every portion (*stan pa cha mnyam pa*)
- Beautiful form of sixteen years (*bcu drug lor ldan mdzes pa'i gzugs*)
- Surrounded by the extremely young (*rab tu gzhon pa rnams kyis bskor*)

Below at the ninth world (*dgu pa*), "Dung-ldan Thal-ba's deity" appears, intoxicated by the fragrance of faith and protection (*dad cing bsrungs ba'i dri yis myos*), with turbulent, blazing, glowing, agitated light.

[673-682] [CONTEXT] # Star Thal-ba and Cosmic Summary
**Analysis:** At the sixth world from this point, "Star Thal-ba" (*skar ma'i thal ba*) appears:
- Nature of stacked wheel (*khor lo brtsigs pa'i rang bzhin*)
- Stacked by five and nine (*lnga dang dgu yis brtsigs*)
- Adorned with dawn's water-spouts (*tho rngs kyi chu skyes kyis spras*)
- Thunder, lightning, red tongues emitting
- Teaching surrounded by scripture (*gsung rab kyis bskor*)
- Light-arising garland, nāga lineage (*'od 'phreng klu yi rigs*)
- Illuminating all directions and intervals

[683] [STRUCTURE] # The Cosmic Architecture Summary
**Analysis:** The final line summarizes the cosmology: within the twenty-five stacked lotus abiding (*nyi shu rtsa lnga brtsigs mar gnas pa*), in upper-lower and directions-intervals (*steng 'og dang phyogs mtshams thams cad*), countless fields pervade (*zhing khams dpag tu med pa khyab par yod*). This establishes the infinite interpenetration of Buddha-fields as the basic cosmological framework.

[683] [CONCEPT] The Fractal Lotus Cosmos
**Analysis:** The twenty-five stacked lotus serves as a fractal template:
- **Lotus:** Purity emerging from impurity
- **Twenty-five:** Five families × fivefold perfection
- **Stacked (*brtsigs*):** Hierarchical yet interpenetrating
- **Pervading (*khyab*):** Each point contains all

This cosmology anticipates the *Avataṃsaka* doctrine of interpenetration (*vyāptyākarṣaṇa*): each field contains all fields, and all fields are present in each field.

[683] [PHILOLOGY] The Particle *de yang*
**Analysis:** The phrase *de yang* (and that/also that) serves as a resumptive particle, connecting the detailed field descriptions to the general summary. The construction *gnas pa'i yang phyogs mtshams steng 'og rnams na* (in the upper-lower and directions-intervals of the abiding) uses *rnams* (plural marker) to emphasize multiplicity. The verb *yod* (exists) establishes ontological presence: these fields ARE, not merely appear.
