[10207-10234] [STRUCTURE] Violation Consequences and Guru Devotion Introduction
**Analysis:** Line 10207 introduces the consequences section: "'di dag las 'das na nyes pa tshad med de" (transgressing these produces immeasurable faults). Lines 10208-10224 cite the 'Khor lo rin po che rnam par brtsegs pa'i rgyud (Jeweled Wheel Stack Tantra), presenting a sixteen-line enumeration of body-speech-mind violation consequences. Each triad follows the same structural pattern: violation category (sku yi dam tshig las 'das na), separation from buddha-body-speech (sangs rgyas sku zhes tshig dang 'bral), comparative karmic weight measured against universal slaughter (khams gsum sems can srog bcad pa), and conclusion of immeasurable misdeed (sdig pa mtha' yas). Lines 10225-10234 transition to the supreme importance of guru devotion, citing the Dpal nam mkha' mi zad pa'i rgyud (Glorious Sky-Unexhausted Tantra) with an eight-line verse on confession practices. This structural movement—from enumeration to consequences to restoration—mirrors the classical Buddhist penitential structure.

[10208-10224] [PHILOLOGY] Comparative Karma Construction
**Analysis:** The citation employs comparative karma construction with the comparative particle bas (than) at lines 10212, 10218, and 10222, establishing exact proportional relationships between violation types. The phrase phas pham pa (defeat/transgression) at line 10213 employs monastic ordination terminology in the tantric context, indicating the gravity of samaya violation. The instrumental particle yis marks the agent of comparison at lines 10212 and 10218, maintaining grammatical consistency across parallel constructions. The phrase sdig pa ches 'phel 'gyur (misdeed greatly increases) at line 10223 employs the intensifier ches (greatly) with the verb 'phel (increase), establishing mind violation as producing the most severe consequences—greater than killing all world-systems' meditators simultaneously.

[10235-10279] [CONTEXT] Guru as Buddha-Embodiment
**Analysis:** Lines 10235-10237 provide the doctrinal rationale for guru devotion intensity: "de'ang bla ma ni sangs rgyas thams cad kyi ngo bo yin la" (moreover, the guru is the essence of all buddhas), "bdag la bla na med pa'i chos da res kyis 'khor ba las sgrol ba ston pas yul gnyan pa'i phyir" (showing me the unsurpassed dharma immediately liberating from samsara, therefore the object is profound). Lines 10238-10279 cite Slob dpon chen po dga' rab rdo rje (Great Master Prahevajra), presenting a twenty-line verse on guru devotion. The passage enumerates: following guru's words exactly (ji skad smras pa de bzhin bya), enduring physical suffering (lus kyi sdug bsngal mchog gyur kyang), not disturbing guru's mind even for an instant (bla ma'i thugs ni skad cig kyang dkrug par bya ba ma yin), protecting guru's food and wealth (bla ma'i zas dang nor rnams la) more than one's own life (rang gi srog pas phangs pa bzhin), not performing empowerments without permission (dbang bskur rab gnas rjes ma gnang bar mi bya), dedicating all actions to guru (mdor na lus dang ngag yid kyis bya ba'i rnam pa gang byed kyang bla mar ma zhus ma gnang bar cung zad tsam yang mi bya), offering all possessions (nor dang dkon pa'i rin po ches), and dedicating all merit (ci dang ci yi phud rnams kyis bla ma mchog la bsngos te dbul). The citation establishes guru yoga as the complete path, with all other practices subsidiary to guru devotion.

[10280-10333] [CONCEPT] Samaya Degrees and Restoration
**Analysis:** Lines 10280-10289 present the benefits of guru devotion: cessation of cyclic existence ('khor rgyun 'gag), maturation of body and speech (lus ngag smin), arising of siddhi (dngos grub byung), cutting of three realms (khams gsum 'chad), cessation of delusion ('khrul pa 'gag), and purification of body (lus sbyangs 'gyur). The structural formula "bsten bya 'di las gang byung ba" (whatever arises from relying on this) establishes guru devotion as the root of all attainments. Lines 10290-10333 present the systematic analysis of samaya degradation (dam tshig gi rim pa las 'das na) and restoration (bskang ba'i cho ga). The text identifies four degrees: violation ('gal ba), degradation (nyams pa), transgression ('das pa), and rupture (ral ba), measured by time intervals—days (zhag), months (zla ba), years (lo), and two-to-three years (lo gnyis dang gsum). The concept reflects the tantric understanding of samaya as dynamic commitment subject to fluctuation, with restoration possible through appropriate methods matched to degradation degree.

[10290-10333] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Degradation Terminology
**Analysis:** The passage employs precise temporal degradation terminology. The phrase ngo bo'i 'da' nyams (transgression of essence) at line 10292 establishes the fundamental category. The temporal markers employ distributive syntax: zhag gis bar ma chod pa (not interrupted by days) at line 10300, zla bas bar ma chod pa (not interrupted by months) at line 10301, los bar ma chod pa (not interrupted by years) at line 10302, and lo gnyis dang gsum song ba (two or three years having passed) at line 10303. The term ral ba (rupture/torn) at line 10303 employs textile metaphor—samaya as fabric that can tear. The restoration formula employs instrumental agency: tshogs kyi 'khor los bshags (confession through ganacakra) at line 10324, rang gi bdogs pas bskang (restoration through one's own wealth) at line 10325, indicating graduated restoration methods proportional to degradation severity.
