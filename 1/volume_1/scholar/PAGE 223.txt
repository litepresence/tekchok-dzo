[8947-8972] [STRUCTURE] Thirty-two Defilements: Symbolic and Actual

This section presents the thirty-two defilements (dri ma sum cu rtsa gnyis) through their symbolic (brda) and actual (don) dimensions, establishing how each of the sixteen base defilements has both indicated and ultimate aspects.

[8947-8964] [PHILOLOGY] Symbolic and Actual Terminology

The text employs hermeneutic vocabulary:
- "Brda" (symbol): Indicated meaning, sign
- "Don" (actual): Ultimate meaning, reality
- "Spros bcas" (elaborated): With constructs
- "Spros med" (unelaborated): Without constructs
- "Dag byed" (purifier): Cleansing agent

The particle "ni" marks multiplication: "de dag gis lus ngag yid sems bzhi re re la dri ma bzhi bzhi ste bcu drug gi tshogs dag par sbyong ba'o" (by these, in each of body, speech, intellect, mind—four defilements each—purifying sixteen collections). The emphatic "o" marks completion.

[8965-8990] [CONTEXT] Symbolic-Actual Hermeneutics

The brda-don (symbol-meaning) distinction derives from:
- Nitartha-neyartha: Definitive vs provisional meaning
- Vajrayana: Outer, inner, secret, perfect levels
- Nyingma: Thun mong and thun mong ma yin pa'i don

Each defilement has:
- Brda (symbol): Surface appearance
- Don (actual): Deep meaning
- Two aspects x sixteen defilements = thirty-two

[8991-9016] [CONCEPT] Sixty-four Defilement System

The complete enumeration:
1. Base level: 16 defilements (bcu drug)
   - 4 aspects (lus, ngag, yid, sems)
   - x 4 defilements each

2. Brda level: 16 symbolic defilements
   - Surface dimension
   - Indicated meanings

3. Don level: 16 actual defilements
   - Deep dimension
   - Ultimate meanings

4. Total: 32 or 64 depending on calculation

Purifiers correspond accordingly.

[STRUCTURE] Body Defilement Purification: Sixteen Elements

[9017-9042] [PHILOLOGY] Elemental Multiplication

The text employs elemental vocabulary:
- "'Byung bzhi" (four elements): Earth, water, fire, wind
- "Pho mo" (male-female): Gender polarity
- "Zug pa" (penetrate): Entering quality
- "Byer ba" (disperse): Scattering quality
- "Snyoms pa" (equalize): Balancing quality

The particle "ni" marks distinction: "de yang sa chu me rlung gshi la zug pa dang byer ba dang snyoms pa gsum gsum du phye bas bcu gnyis so" (moreover, earth, water, fire, wind basis—penetrate, disperse, equalize—three each divided makes twelve). The resultative "so" establishes number.

[9043-9068] [CONTEXT] Four Elements and Three Qualities

The twelve body types (lus mi 'dra ba):
- 4 elements x 3 qualities each = 12

Three qualities (of each element):
1. Zug pa (penetrate/enter): Sharp, active
2. Byer ba (disperse): Spreading, unstable
3. Snyoms pa (equalize): Balanced, stable

Plus:
- Khyab pa'i 'byung ba spyi'i lus (pervasive element general body)
- Rang gi mtshan 'dzin dngos gyi lus (own characteristic actual body)

Total: 128+ variations

[9069-9094] [CONCEPT] Elemental Constitution and Defilement

The elemental defilements arise through:
1. Earth (sa):
   - Zug pa: Rigidity
   - Byer pa: Heaviness
   - Snyoms pa: Attachment to stability

2. Water (chu):
   - Zug pa: Coagulation
   - Byer ba: Dissolution
   - Snyoms pa: Attachment to flow

3. Fire (me):
   - Zug pa: Intensity
   - Byer ba: Dissipation
   - Snyoms pa: Attachment to warmth

4. Wind (rlung):
   - Zug pa: Movement
   - Byer ba: Scattering
   - Snyoms pa: Attachment to motion

Purification transforms elements into wisdoms.

[STRUCTURE] Purification Enumeration and Empowerment Correspondence

[9095-9120] [PHILOLOGY] Mathematical Correspondence

The text employs enumerative vocabulary:
- "Bskal don" (fortunate meaning): Auspicious significance
- "Sbyor ba" (application): Engagement, union
- "Rigs pa" (reasoning): Logical necessity
- "Nges pa" (certainty): Definitive determination
- "Bstan pa" (show/teach): Presentation

The particle "ni" marks correspondence: "de ltar phyi lus smin pa bzhin nang du nyon mongs pa yang" (thus, just as outer body ripens, so too inner affliction). The emphatic "ni" establishes parallel.

[9121-9146] [CONTEXT] Body-Affliction Correspondence

The correspondence between body and affliction:
- Phyi lus (outer body): Physical dimension
- Nang nyon mongs (inner affliction): Mental dimension
- Both have four defilements each
- Both purified by four empowerments

This mirrors:
- Lus ngag yid sems (body, speech, intellect, mind)
- Four empowerments (dbang bzhi)
- Four kayas (sku bzhi)

[9147-9172] [CONCEPT] Complete Purification System

The complete framework:
1. Defilements enumerated:
   - Body: 4 elements x 3 qualities = 12+ types
   - Affliction: 4 types (chags, sdang, gti mug, nga rgyal)
   - Total comprehensive coverage

2. Purifiers applied:
   - Four empowerments
   - Each with four aspects
   - Correspondence established

3. Result:
   - Total purification
   - Natural state revealed
   - Complete liberation

**Summary:**

Page 223 presents the thirty-two defilements through symbolic and actual dimensions, body defilement purification through elemental multiplication, and complete purification enumeration. Philologically, the text employs hermeneutic vocabulary for brda-don, elemental terminology for body types, and enumerative vocabulary for correspondence. Contextual sources include nitartha-neyartha hermeneutics, Ayurvedic elemental theory, and tantric purification mathematics. Conceptually, the section demonstrates thirty-two/sixty-four defilement system through brda-don multiplication, 128+ body types through elemental-quality combinations, and complete body-affliction correspondence with empowerment purifiers—all representing empowerment as mathematically comprehensive purification system.
