[11711-11781] [STRUCTURE] Verse Presentation of the Eight Qualities
The passage transitions to a poetic verse structure presenting the eight qualities (yon tan brgyad) in correspondence with the eight manifestation doors ('char byed sgo brgyad). The architectural arrangement follows: (1) the door of great compassion's appearance (thugs rje'i 'char sgo), (2) the door of the five lights' manifestation ('od lnga'i 'char sgo), (3) the door of the three kāyas' unity (sku gsum gcig tu gnas pa'i sgo), (4) the door of non-dual pervasion (gnyis med khyab byed kyi sgo), (5) the door of basis-path unification (gzhi lam 'brel pa'i sgo), (6) the door of liberation from extremes (mtha' grol gyi sgo), (7) the door of impure saṃsāra's appearance (ma dag 'khor ba'i sgo), (8) the door of pure wisdom's manifestation (dag pa ye shes kyi sgo). Each door is presented with its corresponding quality and the defect of its absence.

[11711-11781] [PHILOLOGY] Poetic Structure and Technical Terms
The verses employ end-rhyme (shar/snar) and metrical parallelism. The compound 'bros khung rang bcad (self-cutting the escape hole) metaphorically describes the spontaneous severing of the six realms' continuity. The term dpyang thag chad pa (breaking the measuring cord) indicates the severance of ordinary measurement. The phrase gnyis cha 'dres pa (intermixed dual aspects) describes the non-dual appearance of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. The compound zang thal (direct penetration/spontaneous presence) appears as a technical term for unimpeded manifestation. The phrase nges pa'i ka dag (definitive primordial purity) establishes the ground for the eighth quality.

[11711-11781] [CONTEXT] Sutra and Tantra Citations
The passage cites from the dbang rnam par che ba (Vikurvanarāja), a text associated with the manifestation of Buddha's powers. The eight-fold structure corresponds to the eight consciousnesses transformed into the five wisdoms plus three additional modes in Yogācāra-Dzogchen synthesis. The verse structure mirrors the style of the Rin po che spungs pa tantra cited at the conclusion of the prose section. The term zang thal rnam pa gsum (threefold direct penetration) references the three modes of wisdom manifestation in thod rgal (direct transcendence) practice.

[11711-11781] [CONCEPT] Defect-Absence Correlation
Each quality is presented through the logical structure of presence-absence-defect: (1) Without compassion-appearance, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would be severed like broken factions; (2) Without light-appearance, beings' self-light would be interrupted and separated; (3) Without kāya-appearance, the nature of embodiment could not be found; (4) Without non-dual appearance, the threshold between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would be inaccessible; (5) Without pervasion-appearance, the basis and path would not meet, and the four wisdoms could not manifest; (6) Without liberation-appearance, the certainty of definitive primordial purity could not be obtained; (7) Without impure appearance, delusion would be nameless and the ground for saṃsāric manifestation would be absent; (8) Without pure appearance, the door of great pure wisdom could not manifest. This structure establishes the qualities as necessary conditions for the dynamic unfolding of manifestation.
