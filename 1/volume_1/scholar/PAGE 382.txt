[15704-15740] [STRUCTURE] Samaya: Spontaneous Vow
The text presents samaya (dam tshig) as spontaneous vow rather than imposed rule. The structure establishes: (1) samaya as recognition of natural purity, (2) the three samayas of body, speech, and mind, and (3) non-breaking of what was never established.

[15704-15740] [PHILOLOGY] Samaya Terminology
The term dam tshig (samaya/sacred vow) identifies tantric commitments. The compound rang bzhin rnam dag (natural purity) establishes the basis of samaya. The phrase ma chad pa (non-breaking) describes its unbreakable nature.

[15704-15740] [CONTEXT] Samaya in Dzogchen
The text presents samaya in Dzogchen as recognition rather than obligation. The fundamental samaya is recognizing the natural state; all others are supports for this recognition. This reflects Dzogchen's integration of tantric commitment with natural freedom.

[15704-15740] [CONCEPT] Samaya as Recognition
The text conceptualizes samaya as the continuity of recognition. To break samaya is to forget the natural state; to keep samaya is to maintain recognition. Since the natural state is never truly forgotten, samaya is never truly broken.
