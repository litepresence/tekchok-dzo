[15990-15992] [PHILOLOGY] Transition to Chapter Twelve
**Analysis:** Line 15990 concludes the previous section by stating that the bindu, through direct manifestation of wisdom (ye shes dngos su snang bas), makes the three kayas (sku gsum) the path—the supreme essential point that transcends all vehicles (theg pa kun gyis 'phags pa'i gnad). Lines 15991-15992 mark the transition: "From the Precious Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the twelfth chapter: detailed explanation of ascertaining the essential points."

[15993-15997] [STRUCTURE] Introduction to the Four Lamps
**Analysis:** Having shown the formation of the bag chags body (bag chags kyi lus grub tshul) with its divisions, the text now presents the detailed classification of the four wisdom-supporting lamps (ye shes kyi rten sgron ma bzhi'i rnam par dbye ba cha dang bcas pa). This has two parts: (1) brief presentation of the essence of the four lamps, and (2) extensive explanation of their nature.

[15998-16006] [CONCEPT] Embryonic Development and the Four Lamps
**Analysis:** Lines 15998-16001 describe the initial formation of the body: at the time of the body's first formation (lus thog ma 'chags pa'i dus na), depending on water (chu la brten nas), the lamp-eye (sgron ma'i spyan) and element-eye ('byung ba'i spyan) form first within the knot of the generative channel (skyed byed kyi rtsa'i mdud pa). From the element-eye, the four-element body forms as explained earlier. From the lamp-eye arises the self-nature of wisdom-appearance, light, bindu, and form (ye shes kyi snang ba 'od dang thig le dang sku la sogs pa'i rang bzhin), the ultimate nirvanic basis (don dam pa mya ngan las 'das pa'i gzhir), located between the two eyes in the "a" fruit center (mig gnyis kyi a 'bras kyi dkyil du), as two root-horns resembling rams' horns with thin roots and wide tips (rtsa ba men gyi rwa 'dra ba rtsa ba phra la rtse mo kha che ba gnyis)—this is called the far-reaching water lamp (rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma). Depending on this, the four lamps arise: (1) thig le stong pa'i sgron ma (empty bindu lamp), (2) shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma (self-arisen wisdom lamp), (3) dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma (pure space lamp), and (4) rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma.

[16007-16034] [PHILOLOGY] Citations from Mu tig 'phreng ba and Rang shar
**Analysis:** The text cites the *Pearl Garland* (Mu tig 'phreng ba): "The path of beings is the gate of arising; that itself—right two, left two, center—dwells as the blazing lamp: the empty bindu lamp, the pure space lamp, self-arisen wisdom, and the far-reaching water lamp, appearing to the seeing object." It then cites *Self-Arising* (Rang shar): "These four lamps are thus: the empty bindu lamp, the awareness-space lamp, self-arisen wisdom lamp, and the far-reaching water lamp, dwelling in all sentient beings." These arise through the purification of the four ultimate elements (don dam gyi 'byung bzhi dag pas).
