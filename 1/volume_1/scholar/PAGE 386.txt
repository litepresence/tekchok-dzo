[16161-16168] [PHILOLOGY] Enumeration of Four Lamps from Four Elements
**Analysis:** Lines 16161-16168 explain that the four lamps are condensed from the four ultimate elements: they ripen as the far-reaching water lamp. "Rgyang" because seeing form-appearances from far away; that itself arising from wind-element moves without obstruction; "zhags" because holding forms from far away; "chu" because engaging in color, shape, etc., is the water-element portion; "sgron ma" because expanding into objects of faculties, castes, enjoyments, etc., accords with fire.

[16169-16175] [CONCEPT] The Bindu as Base-Abiding Wisdom
**Analysis:** The bindu is the base-abiding wisdom (gzhi gnas kyi ye shes). Though it appears directly, it abides as original purity wisdom (ka dag gi ye shes), the unchanging basis abiding as all-pervasive wisdom, the nature spontaneously accomplished, free from elaboration, beyond directions and sides. "Stong pa" (empty): though appearing as characteristic-holding wisdom, even dharmas holding substantial things in self-continuum are empty—the ground-of-arising of emptiness-luminosity is clear as mirror-like wisdom.

[16176-16180] [CONCEPT] Five Wisdoms Through Emptiness
**Analysis:** Lines 16176-16180: Not apprehending directions, sides, center, or extremes through emptiness, it abides as equality wisdom (nyams pa nyid kyi ye shes); with emptiness-direction-side-free nature, while all conceptual discriminations subside, it does not cease as individually-discriminating wisdom (so sor rtog pa'i ye shes); emptiness beyond effort transcends as all-accomplishing wisdom (bya ba grub pa'i ye shes); not moving from the single emptiness's mandala, gathering as dharmadhatu wisdom (chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes)—this is called wisdom free from elaboration.

[16181-16187] [STRUCTURE] Five Types of Wisdom-Knowing
**Analysis:** The lamp is wisdom condensed by knowing (shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes), consisting of five: (1) worldly knowing condensed as wisdom, free from extremes regarding indefensible dharmata; (2) knowing condensed as transcendent wisdom, not needing to abandon anything from the basis, naturally pure dharmata needing no cultivation; (3) knowing condensed as object-known wisdom, seeing the uncorrected, relaxed root; (4) knowing condensed as view wisdom, seeing luminosity through direct sense-perception; (5) knowing condensed as omniscience, seeing objects and aspects as they are and as many as they are.

[16188-16213] [CONCEPT] Movements of Self-Arisen Wisdom Lamp
**Analysis:** The knowing of the self-arisen wisdom lamp consists of: movement ('gyu ba), memory (dran pa), conception (rtog pa), and thought (bsam pa). Movement has two: wind-movement and mind-movement. Wind was explained earlier. Mind-movement has six: (1) all-searching mind-movement producing different karma and afflictions' causes, conditions, actions, and results; (2) settling mind-movement producing me, self, other, both, and neither through agitation of all outer-inner; (3) certainty-establishing mind-movement, engaging and holding in one, two, etc., through agitation toward self, other, appearance-emptiness, and all individual particulars; (4) mind-consciousness movement making various appearances of different objects known by one consciousness, doubt, etc.; (5) afflictive mind-movement producing desire, obscuration, anger, attachment, clinging, ignorance, etc.
