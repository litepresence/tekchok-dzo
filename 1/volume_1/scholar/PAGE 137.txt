[5261-5306] [CONCEPT] Symbolic Language Theory
**Analysis:** Lines 5261-5306 present the theory of symbolic language (*brda*) underlying the letter system:

**Symbolic Language Defined [5261-5263]:**
The gathering of such letter collections constitutes symbolic language (*brda*). The analogy given: just as when someone attaches many cords to fingers to remember many messages, so these letters symbolize:
- Samsara-nirvana dharmas (*'khor 'das kyi chos*)
- Base, path, result (*gzhilam 'bras bu*)
- Expanse and wisdom (*dbyings dang ye shes*), etc.

**Contextual Hermeneutics [5298-5306]:**
The text addresses potential contradictions between different tantric sources:

**From *Rang shar* [5293-5297]:**
- Base letter explained as not circling (*ma 'khor bar bshad*)
- Vowels and branches explained as nirvana letters

**From *Rang grol* [5298-5306]:**
- A left in its own place, vowels as samsara
- Branches as nirvana

**Resolution:** These are not contradictory (*mi 'gal*) but depend on context (*skabs kyis go bar bya ba la dgongs pa*). When explaining that Buddha-nature pervades sentient beings in samsara, the base A is made samsara and vowels/branches nirvana. When explaining how samsara-nirvana diverge from awareness-nature, base A represents awareness (*rig pa*), vowels samsara, and branches nirvana.

[5307-5344] [CONTEXT] Application Across Doxographical Categories
**Analysis:** Lines 5307-5344 demonstrate how the same letter system applies across all doxographical categories:

**Impure Samsara Explanation [5307-5310]:**
- Base letter as self-mind (*ngar gyi sems*)
- Vowels and branches as afflictions (*nyon mongs pa*), aggregates (*phung po*), elements (*khams*), sense-bases (*skye mched*), elements (*'byung ba*), and subject-object (*gzung 'dzin*)

**Pure Nirvana Explanation [5311-5316]:**
- Base letter as self-arisen wisdom (*rang byung gi ye shes*)
- Vowels and branches as three kayas, five wisdoms, five lights, ten powers, etc.

**Base Explanation [5317-5321]:**
- Base A as awareness (*rig pa*)
- Vowels and branches as samsara-nirvana dharmas

**Path Explanation [5320-5321]:**
- Base as nature of heart-center (*snying ga'i ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum gyi rang bzhin*)
- Vowels and branches as base-appearance, lamp-four, appearance-four, etc.

**Result Explanation [5322-5324]:**
- Base as Buddha's mind, self-arisen wisdom
- Vowels and branches as kayas, wisdoms, qualities, activities

**Summary Principle [5325-5326]:**
Whatever is being symbolized, the principal is base letter A, with its retinue as vowels and branches.

[5327-5344] [PHILOLOGY] Four Types of Sound Duration
**Analysis:** Lines 5327-5344 analyze sound duration according to *Rang grol*:

**Citation [5328-5331]:**
From *Rang grol*: "Four aspects demonstrate sound: short, long, great, and base sound"

**Definitions:**
1. *thung ngu* — short, one letter, duration of single pronunciation
2. *ring po* — long, two equal parts, similar class or vital force
3. *chen po* — great, extremely long, duration of three
4. *gzhi'i sgra* — base sound, letter expanse with A and vowels/branches

When vital force agrees (*srog mthun*), read as one; when not agreeing, read separately.
