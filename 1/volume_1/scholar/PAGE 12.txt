[351-355] [STRUCTURE] # The Four Outer Mind Activities
**Analysis:** The outer mind activities (*thugs kyi phyi'i mdzad pa*) are described through four specific samādhis:

1. **Non-composite clear samādhi** (*'du mi byed pa gsal ba'i ting nge 'dzin*) — knowing action and conceptual action
2. **Pure wisdom view samādhi** (*ye shes kyi mthong ba dag pa'i ting nge 'dzin*) — equipoise knowledge perfected
3. **Pure dharmatā samādhi** (*chos nyid rnam par dag pa'i ting nge 'dzin*) — knowing general and specific characteristics
4. **Exhausted defilements samādhi** (*zag pa zad pa'i ting nge 'dzin*) — pure play perfected

The phrase *mngon par 'du mi byed pa* (non-composite/not mentally constructed) refers to the *nirvikalpa* state in Yogācāra—the direct perception of reality without conceptual elaboration.

[356-360] [CONCEPT] The Five Wisdoms at the Inner Level
**Analysis:** The inner activities (*nang gi bzhi*) present four of the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*):

1. **Mirror-like wisdom** (*me long lta bu'i ye shes*) — enjoyment of examples/analogies (*dpe*)
2. **Wisdom of sameness** (*mnyam pa nyid kyi ye shes*) — enjoyment of meaning (*don*)
3. **Discriminating wisdom** (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes*) — enjoyment through sense-faculties
4. **All-accomplishing wisdom** (*bya ba grub pa'i ye shes*) — enjoyment separate from/things (*chos dang bral ba*)

The standard fifth wisdom—Dharmadhātu wisdom (*chos dkyil gyi ye shes*)—is implied as the ground from which these four function. The instrumental *kyis* indicates that these wisdoms are the means by which enjoyment occurs.

[361-365] [CONCEPT] The Four Secret Mind Activities: Non-dual Pairs
**Analysis:** The secret level presents four non-dual (*dbyer med*) abidings that dissolve dualistic fixations:

1. **Clarity-emptiness non-dual** (*gsal stong dbyer med*) — clears saṃsāra-nirvana duality (*'khor 'das gnyis med*)
2. **Appearance-emptiness non-dual** (*snang stong dbyer med*) — performs object-wisdom non-duality (*yul shes gnyis med*)
3. **Awareness-emptiness non-dual** (*rig stong dbyer med*) — performs apprehension-apprehender non-duality (*gzung 'dzin gnyis med*)
4. **Object-mind non-dual** (*yul sems dbyer med*) — cuts the conceptual limit (*rtog mtha'*) of subject-object

This is the heart of Dzogchen view: all apparent dualities resolve in the recognition of non-duality. The term *mtha' chod* (cutting the limit/extreme) refers to transcending both eternalism and nihilism—the two extremes (*mtha' gnyis*) in Madhyamaka dialectic.

[366-369] [STRUCTURE] # Transition to Nirmāṇakāya: The Third Kāya
**Analysis:** The text transitions (*gsum pa* = third) to the emanation-body (*sprul pa'i sku*) and its wheel-turning method (*'khor lo bskor ba'i tshul*). The enumeration "twelve earth teachers in twelve abodes" (*gnas ris bcu gnyis sa ston pa bcu gnyis*) refers to the standard presentation of twelve major Buddha-fields or the twelve deeds of a Buddha. The "five-five perfections" (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga lnga*) indicates that each teacher possesses all five perfections.

[370-372] [CONTEXT] # The Threefold Emanation Structure
**Analysis:** The text presents three modes of emanation activity:

1. **Dharmakāya teaching** (*chos sku'i bstan pa*) — Great Perfection blessing, self-arisen, through Vajra Amitāyus (*rdo rje tshe lha*)
2. **Saṃbhogakāya teaching** (*longs sku'i bstan pa*) — Self-arisen teaching, single son's blessing, through letters and books
3. **Nirmāṇakāya teaching** — Implied continuation

This threefold structure (*sku gsum*) represents the complete pedagogical manifestation: the teaching exists as blessing (Dharmakāya), as scripture (Saṃbhogakāya), and as physical teacher (Nirmāṇakāya). The phrase "filling the hands of people" (*mi rnams kyi phyag gang ba*) indicates direct transmission—the teachings being held, practiced, and embodied.
