[00001-00011] [STRUCTURE] Life-span Deficiency Calculations (Continued)
**Analysis:** This passage completes the arithmetic progression of life-span reductions based on wind deficiency: lacking 50 winds → two years; lacking 32 → three years; lacking 21 → four years; 1/8 (2,700) lacking → seven months; 1/6 (3,600) lacking → five months; 1/4 (5,400) lacking → one month; 1/10 (2,160) lacking → 29 days; lacking 20 → 18 days; lacking 30 → 10 days; lacking 40 → 7 days; lacking 60 → 5 days. The systematic reduction demonstrates the precise mathematical framework underlying Tibetan prognostic calculations.

[00011-00025] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Transformation Terminology
**Analysis:** The passage establishes two-fold calculation: 'jig rten pa (worldly) calculates tshe (lifespan), bsod nams (merit), bde sdug (pleasure/pain); 'das pa (transcendent) calculates 'gyur tshad (transformation measure) and 'pho dus (transference time). Daytime (nyin mo'i cha) transforms into twelve parts for elemental function activities; nighttime (mtshan mo'i cha) transforms into sixteen parts. The 'pho dus (transference times) were previously explained (bshad zin to).

[00025-00049] [CONTEXT] Introduction to Bindu (Thig Le) Classifications
**Analysis:** This section initiates don gsum pa (third topic)—gnas pa thig le'i rab tu dbye ba (detailed classification of abiding bindu). The passage cites *Thal 'gyur* root verses establishing the framework: thig le'i chos nyid (bindu reality) is taught from don dam (ultimate) and kun rdzob (conventional) perspectives. Initially, those desiring buddhahood rely upon rigs ma (consorts) with complete mtshan nyid (characteristics)—including lha (gods), lha min (demigods), tshangs pa (brahmins), rigs ngan (low caste), mu stegs (tīrthikas). Upon seeing complete characteristics, one begins the 'gugs pa'i sbyor ba (magnetizing practice) of bsten bya (relying upon), channels, and dmigs bya (observed objects) for lus rdzogs (body completion).

[00038-00049] [CONCEPT] Two Truths Framework for Bindu Practice
**Analysis:** The passage establishes the two-truth hermeneutic for bindu practice: (1) kun rdzob thig le (conventional bindu) involves dbab (descending), gzung (holding), bzlog (reversing), gdab (striking), bsre (mixing); (2) don dam thig le (ultimate bindu) involves bsten pa (relying upon) chos sku stong pa'i yul (dharmakaya empty objects), gtem te rig pa'i rtsal rnams sbyang (covering and training awareness's intensities), nyin mtshan med par goms sbyong (day-night uninterrupted cultivation). The result: rtsol bral mngon du snang (effortless direct appearance), the measure of 'byongs (mastery/purification).

[00049-00049] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Next Section
**Analysis:** The passage concludes with /zhes gsungs te/ (thus it was taught), marking the completion of the *Thal 'gyur* citation. This standard citation closure indicates the transition from scriptural authority to subsequent commentary or next topic division. The structure maintains the pattern of root-text citation followed by analytical commentary throughout the chapter.
