[15630-15666] [CONTEXT] Space as Foundation
The text presents space as the foundation and container of all manifestation. Without space, nothing could exist or move. When recognized as dharmadhātu, space is revealed as the nature of mind itself.

[15630-15666] [CONCEPT] Dharmadhātu as Space Nature
The text conceptualizes dharmadhātu wisdom as the recognition of space nature. Just as space pervades all without obstruction, dharmadhātu wisdom recognizes the empty nature of all phenomena. Space is the metaphor and reality of emptiness.
