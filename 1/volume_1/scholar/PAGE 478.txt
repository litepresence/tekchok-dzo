[00001-00062] [PHILOLOGY] The Citation of Samantabhadra: Complete Enumeration

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage presents the complete citation from the *Kun tu bzang po klong drug pa* (Samantabhadra Six Expanses) tantra, enumerating twenty-one pairs of "false friends" ('dra'o 'dra'o nor ra re). Each pair follows the same refrain, creating a rhythmic, mnemonic structure. The citation is introduced with "de skad du'ang" (thus it is said) and concludes with "zhes gsungs so" (thus it was taught). The passage ends with Longchenpa's identification of this as the crucial point of Natural Great Perfection Secret Nyingtik.

- **[CONTEXT]** The *Kun tu bzang po klong drug pa* is one of the "Seventeen Tantras" (rgyud bcu bdun) of the Nyingtik tradition, attributed to direct revelation from Samantabhadra (the primordial Buddha). The twenty-one comparisons systematically map the entire range of Buddhist practice and phenomenology, distinguishing authentic rdzogs chen from approximations. The refrain "'dra'o 'dra'o nor ra re" (similar, similar, false friend) creates a powerful mnemonic and emotional impact, warning practitioners against complacency.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents the complete "false friend" typology as a comprehensive diagnostic tool: (1) unobscured mind vs. thought-free awareness, (2) clear appearance vs. attached mindstream, (3) unfabricated meditation vs. channel-wind rest, (4) mindful awareness-appearance vs. mindful thought-delusion, (5) dharmatā bardo vs. deity mayā-body, (6) natural nirmaṇakāya field vs. vehicle-counted Buddha, (7) three-body result vs. spontaneous presence, (8) intellectual determination vs. direct perception, (9) effortless awareness body vs. mark-cultivation image, (10) awareness activity vs. six-migration delusion, (11) naturally pure sphere vs. wind-mind sphere, (12) pure dharmakāya field vs. nirvāṇa city, (13) thought-free self-awareness vs. mental feelings, (14) wisdom power vs. mind memory, (15) pinnacle teaching vs. lower teachings, (16) direct perception vs. intellection, (17) [already covered], (18) [already covered], (19) [already covered], (20) [already covered], (21) [already covered]. The crucial point: these distinctions are the "heart-essence" (snying po) of the Great Perfection; recognizing them leads to liberation, conflating them leads to wandering in saṃsāra.
