[12372-12417] [STRUCTURE] Saṃsāric Manifestations from Non-Recognition: Cosmic Elaboration
This section presents detailed elaboration of saṃsāric phenomena from twelve links, enumerating: (1) five great elements (sa chu me rlung nam mkha', 12372-12373) from great basis; (2) six realms (lha dang lha min mi rnams dang dmyal ba byol song yi dwags rnams, 12374-12376) - gods, demigods, humans, hell beings, animals, pretas; (3) five poisons as magical displays ('dod chags zhe sdang gti mug dang nga rgyal phrag dog...chos 'phrul 'byung, 12377-12379) - attachment, aversion, delusion, pride, jealousy; (4) mental factors and aggregates (ma rig sems can yid rnams dang phung po khams dang skye mched dang rnam par shes pa'i tshogs dag dang dbang po lnga, 12380-12383) - non-recognition, sentient beings' minds, aggregates, elements, sense-fields, consciousness groups, five faculties; (5) six sense objects (sgra dang dri dang ro dang ni reg bya nyid dang 'dod yon, 12384-12386) - sound, smell, taste, touch, desirable objects; (6) body constituents (gsog dang ya ma brla dang snying po med la sogs pa, 12387-12388) - fat, marrow, joints, essenceless; (7) physical elements (kun gzhi dang nyer len gyi sha dang khrag dang chu ser dang rus dang pags pa ba spu dang bsags pa'i lus, 12390-12393) - flesh, blood, lymph, bone, skin, hair, accumulated body. Concludes with six non-recognitions (12395-12417).

[12372-12417] [PHILOLOGY] Cosmological Enumeration and Parallel Structure
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Enumerative yang (also/even, 12372) with elements; (2) Ablative las byung (arisen from, 12373, 12376, 12379, etc.) marks source in basis; (3) Parallel structure: rigs drug with yang dag byung (12376), de las with yang dag byung (12379), de nyid las with byung (12383, 12386, 12389, 12393); (4) Particle ni with specification: de nyid las ni (from that itself, 12379); (5) Five poisons listed: 'dod chags (rāga), zhe sdang (dveṣa), gti mug (moha), nga rgyal (māna), phrag dog (īrṣyā); (6) Compound gsogs pa'i lus (accumulated body, 12393) characterizes physical form as aggregation; (7) Citation de nyid las (12364, 12395) introduces quotations; (8) Six non-recognitions enumerated: rtsa ba sems kyi ma rig (root-mind), 'khrul pa yul gyi ma rig (delusion-object), 'khrul gzhi gzhi'i ma rig (delusion-basis), 'dzin pa rtog pa'i ma rig (grasping-thought), bcos pa lam gyi ma rig (fabricated-path), ma shes rmongs pa'i ma rig (unknown-delusion, 12398-12403).

[12372-12417] [CONTEXT] Abhidharma Cosmology and Dzogchen Transformation
The passage integrates: (1) Abhidharma cosmology: five elements (mahābhūta), six realms (ṣaḍgat), five poisons (pañcakleśa), five aggregates (pañcaskandha), twelve sense-bases (āyatana), eighteen elements (dhātu); (2) Dzogchen transformation: all are "play" (rol pa) and "magical display" (chos 'phrul) of basis, not ultimately existent categories; (3) *Mu tig 'phreng ba* (Pearl Garland) citation provides Sems sde textual authority for cosmogonic process; (4) *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra citation (12396-12405) lists six non-recognitions; (5) Root-mind non-recognition (12407-12414): co-emergent (lhan cig skyes pa), wondering "Did awareness arise from me or not mine?" (nga la ye shes kyi snang ba 'di byung ngam/nga'i snang ba 'di min nam), conceiving mind (snyem byed) producing self-grasping.

[12372-12417] [CONCEPT] Saṃsāra as Basis's Spontaneous Play and Six Non-Recognitions
The philosophical framework: (1) All saṃsāric phenomena - elements, realms, afflictions, aggregates - are spontaneous play (rtsal dang rol pa) of basis, not separate or opposed; (2) What appears as impure saṃsāra is basis's own manifestation (rang snang); (3) Five poisons are not ultimately existent defilements but basis's energy appearing as affliction through non-recognition; (4) Six non-recognitions arise as self-possession (rang chas su byung): (a) root-mind (co-emergent failure to recognize wisdom), (b) delusion-object (projecting world), (c) delusion-basis (four conditions producing individuation), (d) grasping-thought (six minds creating duality), (e) fabricated-path (obscuring wisdom-path), (f) unknown-delusion (failing to recognize self-appearance as light); (5) Liberation possibility: if saṃsāra is basis's play, recognition transforms it into enlightenment's display; (6) Non-duality of basis and manifestation means liberation doesn't require destroying saṃsāra but recognizing its true nature.
