[12418-12469] [STRUCTURE] Six Non-Recognitions Detailed
The text presents the six non-recognitions (ma rig pa drug) that arise as self-possession. The structure enumerates: (1) root-mind non-recognition (rtsa ba sems kyi ma rig pa)—co-emergent non-recognition of awareness-wisdom, (2) delusion-object non-recognition ('khrul pa yul gyi ma rig pa)—arising from the Wish-Fulfilling Tree and cosmic egg, (3) delusion-basis non-recognition ('khrul gzhi gzhi'i ma rig pa)—four conditions producing individuation, (4) grasping-thought non-recognition ('dzin pa rtog pa'i ma rig pa)—six minds arising from afflictions, (5) fabricated-path non-recognition (bcos pa lam gyi ma rig pa)—six minds obscuring wisdom-path, (6) unknown-delusion non-recognition (ma shes rmongs pa'i ma rig pa)—failing to recognize self-appearance as light. The passage establishes comprehensive typology of non-recognition modes.

[12418-12469] [PHILOLOGY] Six Non-Recognition Types
The passage employs specialized terminology for each non-recognition: rtsa ba sems kyi ma rig (root-mind), 'khrul pa yul gyi ma rig (delusion-object), 'khrul gzhi gzhi'i ma rig (delusion-basis), 'dzin pa rtog pa'i ma rig (grasping-thought), bcos pa lam gyi ma rig (fabricated-path), ma shes rmongs pa'i ma rig (unknown-delusion). The term lhan cig skyes pa (sahaja, co-emergent) characterizes the root type. The phrase snyem byed (pride/conceit) identifies the root-mind's function. The compound yid drug (six minds) enumerates: ma rig dang mtshungs pa'i yid, yid kyi rnam shes, kun tu tshol ba'i yid, gtan la 'bebs pa'i yid, rnam par rags pa'i yid, nges par 'jog pa'i yid.

[12418-12469] [CONTEXT] Sems sde and Cosmogonic Mythology
The six non-recognitions draw on Sems sde (Mind Series) Dzogchen texts, particularly the cosmogonic narratives of the Wish-Fulfilling Tree (dpag bsam gyi shing) and cosmic egg (sgo nga). The six minds derive from Yogācāra analysis of mind's functional aspects. The Rang shar (Self-Arisen) tantra citation provides textual authority. The framework integrates Indian Buddhist psychology with Tibetan Dzogchen cosmogony.

[12418-12469] [CONCEPT] Non-Recognition as Comprehensive Obscuration
The conceptual framework establishes six modes through which non-recognition comprehensively obscures wisdom: (1) at the root—co-emergent failure to recognize awareness, (2) in the object—projecting external world from cosmic imagery, (3) in the basis—conditions producing individuated experience, (4) in grasping—six minds creating subject-object duality, (5) in the path—fabricated practice obscuring natural wisdom, (6) in ignorance—failing to recognize appearance as self-light. These six cover all dimensions of experience: root, object, basis, subject, path, and result. The framework establishes that non-recognition is not a single error but a comprehensive pattern permeating all aspects of deluded experience.
