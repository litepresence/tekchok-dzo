[1140-1147] [PHILOLOGY] The Infinite Consciousness Āyatana (*rnam shes mtha' yas kyi skye mched*)
**Analysis:**

**Expansion Mechanism:** As beings proliferate (*mang por mched pas*), consciousness becomes "without end" (*mtha' yas*).

**Five Characteristics:**
1. *rnam pa yul* — Form/object
2. *'khor lo 'jug pa* — Wheel enters (cyclical consciousness)
3. *shes pa tsam la bdag tu rtog pa tsam* — Only conceiving self to only consciousness
4. *mtha' shes pa yas* — Exceeding end-knowledge
5. *sdud pa'i dngos po med pa* — Without condensed thing

**Technical Designation:** *rnam shes mtha' yas kyi skye mched* — The sense-base/sphere of infinite consciousness (second formless absorption).

**Etymological Note:** *skye mched* (āyatana) derives from *skye* (arise) + *mched* (expand/increase), indicating the expansive nature of this meditative attainment.

[1148-1151] [CONCEPT] Degradation of Life, Body, and Concentration
**Analysis:**

**Progressive Decline:**
- Life span: Shorter than above (*tshe tshad thung*)
- Body: Smaller size (*lus bongs chung*)
- Light: Unclear (*'od mi gsal ba*)
- Concentration: Low (*dman pa*)

**Root Cause:** *bsod nams kyi stobs nyams pa* — Decline of merit power.

**Buddhist Principle:** Cosmic and bodily characteristics directly correlate with accumulated merit (*bsod nams*) and meditative stability.

[1152-1156] [STRUCTURE] Descent to the Great Cloud Realm
**Analysis:**

**Spatial Location:** 2,000 leagues below (*dpag tshad stong phrag gnyis na*)

**Realm Name:** *sprin chen po rnam par rol ba* — Great Cloud Completely-Play

**Manifestation Process:**
- Samādhi self-appearance (*ting nge 'dzin rang snang*) arises
- Various colored cloud masses (*sprin kha dog sna tshogs pa'i dum bu*) pervade
- These appear as *ling tsher* (cloud heaps/masses)
- From expanding consciousness, immeasurable beings expand

**Technical Designation:** *nam mkha' mtha' yas pa'i skye mched* — Sky/Space Infinite sense-base (first formless absorption).

[1157-1161] [CONTEXT] Lifespans of the Four Formless Realms
**Analysis:**

**Hierarchical Duration (in Great Eons / *bskal chen*):**

| Realm | Lifespan |
|-------|----------|
| Peak of Existence (*srid rtse*) | 80,000 eons |
| Nothingness (*ci yang med pa*) | 60,000 eons |
| Infinite Consciousness (*rnam shes mtha' yas*) | 40,000 eons |
| Infinite Space (*nam mkha' mtha' yas*) | 20,000 eons |

**Pattern:** Each lower realm has half the lifespan of the realm above it, reflecting the inverse relationship between subtlety and duration.

[1162-1169] [PHILOLOGY] Resolving the Apparent Contradiction: Form vs. Formless
**Analysis:**

**Objection:** Body appearance (*lus snang ba*) seems to contradict formlessness (*gzugs med pa*).

**Resolution:** The text demonstrates that various realms lack "form" (*gzugs*) in different ways:

1. **Meditation gods** (*bsam gtan gyi lha*): Appear as light-form (*'od kyi gzugs*) without coarse matter; dwell only as consciousness.

2. **Desire gods and humans**: Arise without flesh-blood body (*sha khrag gi lus*); consciousness does not actually conceive objects.

3. **Pretas**: Move without mind-form (*yid kyi gzugs*); consciousness is clear internally.

4. **Hells**: Experience without suffering-body of contact (*myong reg sdug bsngal gyi lus*); consciousness dwells in concentration-bliss.

**Key Insight:** Formlessness means absence of *coarse* form, not absolute non-existence. Subtle emanation bodies (*sprul snang gi lus*) exist that:
- Are not visible to lower realms (*og mas bltar mi mngon*)
- Are visible to own realm and above (*rang sa dang gong mas mthong*)

**Philosophical Significance:** This establishes the Yogācāra principle that appearances (*snang ba*) and consciousness (*rnam shes*) are inseparable—there is no "formless" that is absolutely non-appearing.

[1170-1172] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Citation: Perfection of Wisdom
**Analysis:**

**Source:** *yum bar ma* — Middle-length Mother (Perfection of Wisdom in 25,000 lines / *Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā*).

**Citation:** Even gods dwelling in desire, form, and formless realms hold flowers and worship the Tathāgata.

**Doxographical Significance:** This citation demonstrates that:
1. Even the highest gods recognize the Buddha's supremacy
2. Formless realm beings can engage in worship (refuting absolute formlessness)
3. Merit can be created across all realms

**Structural Transition:** Having established the cosmological framework of all realms from hells to peak of existence, Longchenpa has completed the "container" (*snod*) section and will now proceed to detailed analysis of how sentient beings arise, evolve, and experience within these realms—the "contained" (*bcud*) section proper.
