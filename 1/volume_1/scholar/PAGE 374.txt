[00001-00002] [PHILOLOGY] Wind-Movement Somatomotor Functions
**Analysis:** The text lists two additional functions of sa'i rlung (earth wind): sgul skyod (movement/motion) and zha grum (shivering/trembling). These terms describe gross motor functions and thermoregulatory responses. The la sogs pa (and so forth) indicates the enumerative principle—list completion through typical exemplification rather than exhaustive cataloguing.

[00003-00020] [CONTEXT] Menstrual Cycle Pathology and Prognostication
**Analysis:** This extensive passage addresses me'i rtsa rlung (fire-channel wind) effects on reproductive physiology. The four dri chu (menstrual fluid) qualities—bsri ba (retarded), 'phrim pa (diminished), 'thor ba (scattered), khugs pa (concentrated)—determine diagnostic outcomes. Pathological manifestations include: loss of virility, constant numbness (rengs pa), untimely seminal emission, failure to rise without stimulus or failure despite stimulus for males; menstrual blockages, untimely flows, and irregular periodicity for females. The text provides specific prognostic rules: 2nd-3rd day pure flow in waxing moon → male offspring; 15th day flow → female offspring; waning moon constant flow → female/mixed offspring. Heavy clotting (khrag mang ba) on the 22nd or 5th day results in infertility (bu tsha gang yang mi 'byung).

[00020-00026] [CONCEPT] Cognitive and Physiological Wind Functions
**Analysis:** The passage presents comprehensive wind-function correlations: sa'i rlung produces faculties and supports, generating karma and conceptuality; rlung gi me produces six cognitive intensities (rtsal ba); rlung gi rlung controls respiration; rlung gi chu ceases conceptuality (rtog pa 'gag). The gender-specific pathologies—smig lo'i nad (conjunctivitis) for women during pregnancy conception, chang gi nad (alcohol-intoxication disorder) for men—reflect the medical understanding of wind-imbalance etiologies.

[00026-00035] [STRUCTURE] Combined Elemental Wisdom Functions
**Analysis:** This section enumerates specialized functions from combined elements: sa'i rlung produces limb extension/retraction; me'i rlung produces diverse afflictive intensities; rlung gi rlung mixed with me produces: (1) various prajñā intensities; (2) wondrous metaphorical discernment; (3) doctrinal mastery; (4) knowledge of female service; (5) mastery of body-speech transformations. This progression demonstrates how elemental combinations yield higher cognitive faculties, reflecting the soteriological trajectory from basic physiology to wisdom capacities.

[00035-00038] [PHILOLOGY] Seasonal Elemental Transformation
**Analysis:** The text presents the fundamental principle: 'byung bzhi'i skye ba'i rim pa (four elements' birth sequence) is determined by dbyar dgun ston dpyid (summer, winter, autumn, spring) transformations. The term gral 'pho (order transference) indicates systematic elemental rotation. The resulting manifestations—na ba (illness), tsha ba (fever), 'chi ba (death), and khyad par (special characteristics) of body-speech-mind activities—establish the prognostic implications of seasonal elemental dominance.

[00038-00042] [CONTEXT] Elemental Order Pathologies
**Analysis:** The passage describes four modes of 'byung ba'i gral (elemental order) dysfunction: nyams pa (deterioration), log pa (reversal), 'grus pa (aggravation), 'gyur ba (transformation). These determine four corresponding life-course disruptions (tshe nyams pa, log pa, 'grus pa, 'gyur ba). The diagnostic principle correlates past/future lifespan length with elemental stability—the longer the past life, the greater the transformation-based elimination; the longer the future life, the more stable the present abiding.
