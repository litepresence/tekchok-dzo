[11365-11391] [STRUCTURE] Completion of Eight Modes and Threefold Capacity
The section completes the eight modes and presents the threefold capacity (rtsal): (7) mode of freedom from extremes—spontaneous presence clear in its own face (11365); (8) mode of pure wisdom door—sees higher appearance like cloudless sky of primordial purity (11366); (9) mode of impure samsara door—appears below as six-class appearance aspect (11367-11369). Then: (1) from capacity of spontaneous presence appearance, immeasurable sambhogakāya appearance in five wisdom fields self-clear (11370); (2) from quality capacity, natural emanation body fields appear in directions, immeasurable self-arising (11371); (3) from compassion capacity, below sentient beings appear immeasurably, self-appear (11372).

[11365-11391] [PHILOLOGY] Eight Modes and Three Capacities
The eight modes conclude with: "mtha' grol ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas lhun grub rang ngo na gsal ba" (because understanding like freedom from extremes arises without ceasing, spontaneous presence clear in its own face); "dag pa ye shes kyi sgo ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas ngo bo ka dag gi snang ba nam mkha' sprin med pa lta bu'i snang ba gong na mthong ba" (because understanding like pure wisdom door arises without ceasing, sees higher appearance like cloudless sky of primordial purity essence appearance); "ma dag pa 'khor ba'i sgo ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas 'og na rigs drug gi snang cha snang ba" (because understanding like impure samsara door arises without ceasing, below appears six-class appearance aspect). The three capacities: "rtsal las" (from capacity), with specifications—ye shes lnga'i zhing (five wisdom fields), rang bzhin sprul pa sku'i zhing (natural emanation body fields), 'og gi sems can (below sentient beings).

[11365-11391] [CONTEXT] The Three Bodies (trikāya) Manifestation
The three capacities correspond to the three Buddha-bodies: (1) wisdom capacity → sambhogakāya (enjoyment body) in five wisdom fields; (2) quality capacity → nirmāṇakāya (emanation body) in directions; (3) compassion capacity → appearance as sentient beings. This is the Dzogchen interpretation of trikāya: not three different entities but three modes of ground's spontaneous manifestation. Sambhogakāya appears as the five wisdoms' natural expression; nirmāṇakāya appears as the emanations in all directions; sentient beings appear when compassion is not recognized.

[11365-11391] [CONCEPT] The Two Doors of Appearance
The eight modes culminate in "two doors" (sgo gnyis): (1) dag pa ye shes kyi sgo (pure wisdom door) leading to cloudless sky appearance—liberation; (2) ma dag pa 'khor ba'i sgo (impure samsara door) leading to six-class appearance—confusion. The doors are not physical locations but modes of recognition: same appearance can be recognized as wisdom (pure) or not recognized (impure). The "six classes" (rigs drug) refer to the six realms of samsara—gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings. Ground-appearance is the basis for both; recognition determines which "door" manifests.

[11373-11391] [STRUCTURE] Mirror Analogy and Cosmogonic Levels
The section presents: (1) mirror analogy—such ground-appearance clear, manifestly appearing like reflection in mirror, appears to self but not to other, not known as self-appearance, like dream appearance, suddenly arises, not grasped by self (11373-11376); (2) cosmogonic levels—below primordial purity is spontaneous presence appearance, below that five clear light bindus and ray displays appear as great ancient ground, below that sambhogakāya appearance, below that natural emanation body appearance, below that six-class appearance, and taming those, six taming emanation body Buddhas, and impure emanation body field-taming birth-aging-sickness-death (11377-11383).

[11373-11391] [PHILOLOGY] Mirror and Dream Analogies
The mirror analogy: "me long du gzugs brnyan shar ba 'dra" (like reflection arising in mirror); "rang la snang la gzhan la mi snang" (appears to self but not to other); "rang snang du mi shes pa" (not known as self-appearance); "rmi lam gyi snang ba ltar" (like dream appearance); "yad yud 'al 'ol sang seng du shar" (suddenly arises). The cosmogonic levels employ "'og na" (below is): lhun grub kyi snang ba (spontaneous presence appearance), 'od gsal lnga'i thig le (five clear light bindus), zer gdangs (ray displays), gzhi snga chen po (great ancient ground), longs sku'i snang ba (sambhogakāya appearance), rang bzhin sprul sku'i snang ba (natural emanation body appearance), 'gro drug gi snang ba (six-class appearance), 'gro 'dul sprul sku thub pa drug (six taming emanation body Buddhas), ma dag pa sprul pa'i sku (impure emanation body).

[11373-11391] [CONTEXT] The Mirror as Standard Buddhist Analogy
The mirror (me long) is the standard Buddhist analogy for mind: (1) mirrors reflect without alteration—mind knows without modifying objects; (2) mirrors reflect clearly when clean—mind knows clearly when defilements removed; (3) reflections lack inherent existence—appearances are empty; (4) mirror and reflection are inseparable—appearance and emptiness are non-dual. In Dzogchen, the mirror analogy specifically illustrates ground-appearance: ground is the mirror, appearances are reflections, recognition is knowing the reflection is not separate from the mirror. The "dream" analogy adds: appearances are like dreams—seeming real to the dreamer but actually ground's display.

[11373-11391] [CONCEPT] Self-Appearance Unknown to Self
The paradox "rang la snang la...rang snang du mi shes pa" (appears to self but not known as self-appearance) captures the fundamental delusion: ground appears to itself (rang la snang) but does not recognize itself as the appearing (rang snang du mi shes). This is the "basic delusion" (gzhi ma rig) that creates samsara—not a mistake about external objects but failure to recognize appearances as self-display. The "self" here is ground, not individual ego. Individual ego is already a product of this prior nonrecognition.

[11384-11391] [STRUCTURE] Jewel Casket Analogy and Citation
The section presents: (1) the eight modes of spontaneous presence are the source from which these arise, like seed-bag of barley (11384-11386); (2) therefore called casket (ga'u); (3) citation from Beautiful Auspiciousness tantra—though without confusion, from my capacity confusion arises, from unchanging ground, nature unceasingly arises, from compassion indeterminate, self-arisen nonawareness (11387-11391).

[11384-11391] [PHILOLOGY] Seed-Bag Analogy and Citation
The analogy: "gro ba'i 'bag skong lta bu" (like seed-bag of barley)—the eight modes contain all potentialities like a bag contains seeds. "Des na ga'u'i sgra brjod pa'o" (therefore the word casket is said). The citation: "kye ma ngal 'khrul pa med kyang nga'i rtsal las 'khrul pa byung ste" (alas, though without confusion, from my capacity confusion arises); "gzhi mi 'gyur ba las" (from unchanging ground); "rang bzhin ma 'gags par shar nas" (nature unceasingly arises); "thugs rjes ma nges pa las ma rig pa rang byung" (from compassion indeterminate, self-arisen nonawareness).

[11384-11391] [CONTEXT] Cosmogonic Paradox in Dzogchen
The citation presents the fundamental cosmogonic paradox: ground (nga) is without confusion ('khrul pa med), yet confusion arises from its capacity (rtsal). This is not a contradiction because: (1) ground itself does not become confused; (2) confusion is merely nonrecognition of ground's display; (3) from ground's perspective, there is only display, no confusion; (4) confusion exists only from the perspective of the confused. The "self-arisen" (rang byung) nonawareness indicates that delusion arises spontaneously from ground, not through external cause or error.

[11384-11391] [CONCEPT] Indeterminate Compassion (thugs rje ma nges)
The phrase "thugs rjes ma nges pa las ma rig pa rang byung" (from indeterminate compassion, self-arisen nonawareness) identifies compassion as the "site" where confusion arises. Compassion is "indeterminate" (ma nges pa) because: (a) it can manifest as pure recognition (wisdom) or impure nonrecognition (delusion); (b) it has not yet determined into specific manifestations; (c) it is the open, responsive dimension that can go either way. Compassion is not yet kindness here but the responsive capacity that, when unrecognized, becomes the basis for dualistic cognition.
