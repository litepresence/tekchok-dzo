[12331-12371] [STRUCTURE] Twelve Links of Dependent Origination
This section presents twelve links (rten 'brel bcu gnyis) as delusion's complete expression: (1) contact (reg pa) from engaging objects (yul las longs spyod pa, 12331); (2) feeling (tshor ba) as three types (dga' gdung bar ma gsum, 12332); (3) craving (sred pa) as attachment to pleasure/aversion to pain (bde ba la chags shing sdug bsngal mi 'dod pa, 12333); (4) grasping (len pa) as accepting objects (yul dang du len pas, 12334); (5) becoming (srid pa) as karma maturing future birth (las dang nyon mongs rgyas te phyi ma'i skye bar 'phen pa'i las 'grub pa, 12335); (6) birth (skye ba) in different realms ('gro ba tha dad du skye ba, 12336); (7) aging-and-death (rga shi) as lifecycle completion (dar la bab pa dang rgas pa dang shi ba, 12337); (8) summary: twelve-wheeled delusion from first to "I" (dang po nas nga'i bar 'khor lo bcu gnyis kyis 'khrul pa'o, 12338); (9) even in one life, clear light setting at existence-bardo's first moment without recognition is non-recognition ('od gsal nub ste srid pa bar do snang rung gi skad cig dang po rang ngo ma shes pa ni ma rig pa, 12339); (10) external breath ceasing is death (phyi dbugs chad dus shi bas, 12340); (11) dependent origination operates between (de'i bar rten 'brel lugs 'jug go, 12341).

[12331-12371] [PHILOLOGY] Dependent Origination Terminology
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Standard Pratītyasamutpāda terms: reg pa (sparśa, contact), tshor ba (vedanā, feeling), sred pa (tṛṣṇā, craving), len pa (upādāna, grasping), srid pa (bhava, becoming), skye ba (jāti, birth), rga shi (jarāmaraṇa, aging-death); (2) Instrumental las marking source: yul las (from object), las dang nyon mongs (from karma and afflictions); (3) Compound dga' gdung bar ma gsum (pleasure-pain-neutral, 12332) enumerates three feelings; (4) Continuative te marking consequence: rgyas te (having expanded), 'phen pa'i (propelling); (5) Temporal dus with verbs: chad dus (when ceasing), zad pa'i dus na (when exhausted); (6) Compound 'khor lo (wheel, 12338) characterizes cyclical nature; (7) Citation markers: *Mu tig 'phreng ba* (12353-12362) with de ltar gnas pa'i chos nyid la (in thus-abiding dharmatā); (8) Additional citations: gzhi snang chen po (12359-12362) on non-recognition without imputation.

[12331-12371] [CONTEXT] Pratītyasamutpāda in Dzogchen Framework
The passage integrates: (1) Standard Buddhist dependent origination with Dzogchen's non-recognition framework - classical Buddhism presents it as saṃsāra's mechanism, Dzogchen as initial non-recognition's elaboration; (2) *Thal 'gyur* citation (12313-12324) provides Atiyoga authority: "Saṃsāra's beginning is: from undivided unfabricated nature, grasped-object appears, grasping-concept distinguishes appearances, subject-object relation in twelve ways, this is saṃsāra's beginning itself" - emphasizing non-recognition as root; (3) *Mu tig 'phreng ba* citation (12353-12362): "In thus-abiding dharmatā, delusion is primordially non-existent, like clouds suddenly obscuring dharmakāya-space" and "From that great basis-manifestation, non-recognition is without imputation, deluded establishment does not exist"; (4) Death and bardo process: external breath ceasing, subtle/coarse dissolution processes (phra rags kyi thim tshul sbubs pho ba'i rim pa), delusory appearances emptying then cycling back to saṃsāra; (5) Nirvāṇa's self-arisen natural condition and dharmatā-bardo appearances as nirvāṇa's dependent origination manifest.

[12331-12371] [CONCEPT] Delusion's Complete Expression as Adventitious
The philosophical framework: (1) All twelve links emerge from initial non-recognition - each represents further solidification: non-recognition → formations → consciousness → name-form → sense-fields → contact → feeling → craving → grasping → becoming → birth → aging-death; (2) Entire process occurs instantaneously (skad cig ma dang po la 'khrul lo, 12311) - saṃsāra is mistaken perception-mode, not temporal process; (3) After death, subtle/coarse dissolution-processes reverse, delusory appearances empty then cycle back ('khrul snang stongs nas 'khor ba ru log pa, 12343); (4) Nirvāṇa's self-arisen natural condition (mya ngan las 'das pa rang byung gi gnas lugs) and dharmatā-bardo appearances are nirvāṇa's dependent origination manifest (mya ngan las 'das pa'i rten 'brel mngon du snang ba, 12345); (5) Without recognition, one cycles; with recognition, liberated ('khor ba myang 'das su grol ba, 12347); (6) Delusion is adventitious (glo bur) - like clouds obscuring space, not affecting its nature; (7) Both ground (gzhi) and manifestation (gzhi snang) lack non-recognition, yet like clouds it suddenly appears as condition (12348-12352).
