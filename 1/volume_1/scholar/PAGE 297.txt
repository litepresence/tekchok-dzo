[12372-12417] [STRUCTURE] Samsaric Manifestations from Non-Recognition
The text presents the detailed elaboration of saṃsāric phenomena from the twelve links. The structure presents: (1) the five elements (sa, chu, me, rlung, nam mkha') arising from the great basis, (2) the six realms (gods, demigods, humans, hell beings, animals, pretas) arising from the basis, (3) the five poisons ('dod chags, zhe sdang, gti mug, nga rgyal, phrag dog) as magical displays of the basis, (4) the five aggregates (phung po), five sense-faculties, etc., (5) the elements of embodied existence (flesh, blood, lymph, bone, skin, hair). The passage establishes all saṃsāric phenomena as manifestations of the basis through the mechanism of non-recognition.

[12372-12417] [PHILOLOGY] Cosmological Enumeration
The passage employs cosmological enumeration terminology: 'byung ba chen po (great elements), rigs drug (six classes/realms), 'jig rten gsum (three worlds). The five poisons are listed: 'dod chags (attachment), zhe sdang (aversion), gti mug (delusion), nga rgyal (pride), phrag dog (jealousy). The phrase chos 'phrul (magical display) characterizes their nature. The five aggregates appear: phung po, khams (elements), skye mched (sense-fields), rnam shes tshogs (consciousness groups), dbang po (faculties). The compound gsogs pa'i lus (accumulated body) describes the physical form.

[12372-12417] [CONTEXT] Abhidharma Cosmology and Dzogchen Transformation
The passage draws on Abhidharma cosmology enumerating elements, realms, aggregates, and sense-bases. The Dzogchen transformation presents these not as ultimately existent categories but as the play (rol pa) and expression (rtsal) of the basis. The Mu tig 'phreng ba (Pearl Garland) citation provides textual authority. The framework demonstrates Dzogchen's comprehensive inclusion of Buddhist cosmology while transforming its ontological status.

[12372-12417] [CONCEPT] Saṃsāra as Basis's Play
The conceptual framework establishes all saṃsāric phenomena—the elements, realms, afflictions, aggregates—as the play (rol pa) and magical display (chos 'phrul) of the basis. What appears as impure saṃsāra is actually the basis's own manifestation, not something separate or opposed to it. The five poisons are not ultimately existent defilements but the basis's energy (rtsal) appearing as affliction through non-recognition. The framework establishes the possibility of liberation: if saṃsāra is the basis's play, recognition of this fact transforms saṃsāra into the display of enlightenment. The non-duality of basis and manifestation means that liberation does not require destroying saṃsāra but recognizing its true nature.
