[2165-2245] [CONTEXT] The Hundred Teachers (Continued)
**Analysis:**

The enumeration continues with additional teachers from the present era (*da ltar ba*), representing various non-Buddhist schools and ascetic traditions.

**Doxographic Significance:**

These 100 teachers span the spectrum of Indian religious thought, including:
- **Brahmanical orthodoxy** (*bram ze'i spyod pa*)
- **Nature worship** (*nags gnas*, moon/sun observers)
- **Extreme asceticism** (*lag za*, *snying za*)
- **Samkhya traditions** (*grangs can rnal 'byor*)
- **Local/folk traditions** (*khyi can*, *srog chags gi bdag po*)

**Philological Note:** The diversity of names reflects the rich tapestry of religious experimentation in ancient India, from orthodox Brahmanism to extreme asceticism.

[2246-2283] [CONCEPT] Samkhya and Vaisesika Doctrines
**Analysis:**

**Samkhya View:**

The Samkhyas hold three principles as permanent (*rtag pa*):
1. Atoms (*rdul phran*)
2. Darkness (*mun pa*)
3. Three energies (*snying stobs gsum*)

**Causal Theory:**
- Delusion (*ma rig pa*) is the basis of action
- Attachment produces happiness
- Anger turns back armies (*dpung slar log*)

**Vaisesika View:**

The Vaisesikas (*bye brag pa*) view outer aggregates, elements, and ayatanas as minute atoms (*rdul phran*).

**Key Doctrines:**
- Count atoms as "grasped by the first grasper" (*'dzin pa dang po'i 'dzin pa*)
- These are causes and conditions of cessation
- These are causes and conditions of ultimate emptiness
- When body is abandoned, mind and space remain latent (*bag la bab*)
- Latent arising of body (*bag la byung*)
- Abiding at the end of trace emptiness (*thig stong mtha' gnas*)

**Kumaralabha Tenets:**

The school of Kumaralabdha holds:
- Mind is nonexistent; body is nonexistent (*sems med lus med*)
- When mind is nonexistent, body is also nonexistent

This represents an extreme nihilist position within the non-Buddhist traditions.

**Doxographic Method:**

Longchenpa systematically presents each school's:
- Ontological commitments (what they posit as real)
- Causal theory (how things arise)
- Soteriology (path to liberation)

This serves to clearly differentiate Buddhist from non-Buddhist positions.
