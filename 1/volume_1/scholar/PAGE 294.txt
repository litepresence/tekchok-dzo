[12257-12287] [STRUCTURE] Lhundrub's Appearance and Delusion's Mechanics
The text analyzes how lhundrub's spontaneous appearance becomes the ground for delusion. The structure presents: (1) lhundrub's jewel-box's natural display as uninterrupted, (2) the basis not changing while appearances change, (3) following after many objects, (4) everything becoming conceptual, (5) dharmakāya appearance not changing but deluded appearance seeming to change, (6) Vajrasattva not possessing delusion yet demonstrating delusion-mode for beings, (7) reversal of self-appearance back into conditional basis. The passage establishes that delusion is the misrecognition of lhundrub's display as separate objects.

[12257-12287] [PHILOLOGY] Lhundrub and Reversal Terminology
The passage employs specialized terminology: lhundrub rin po che'i ga'u (jewel-box of spontaneous presence), ma 'gags pa (uninterrupted/unceasing), rang rkyen gyi gzhi la bzlog pa (reversal into conditional basis). The phrase gzhi ma 'gyur bar (basis not changing) establishes the ground's stability. The term 'gyur 'gyur ltar byung ba (appearing as if changing) qualifies delusion's appearance. The compound rtsa ba'i nyon mongs (root afflictions) identifies the emotional component. The particle gyis 'byams pa (pervaded by) indicates the extent of delusion.

[12257-12287] [CONTEXT] Maṇi and Dzogchen Delusion Theory
The jewel-box (ga'u) metaphor reflects the maṇi (jewel) symbolism pervasive in Vajrayāna, particularly the wish-fulfilling jewel (yid bzhin nor bu) that manifests according to conditions without changing its essence. The demonstration of delusion-mode (ston pa) reflects the bodhisattva's skill in appearing to share beings' delusion while remaining free. The Rdo rje sems dpa' (Vajrasattva) reference indicates the primordial buddha's relationship to delusion.

[12257-12287] [CONCEPT] Delusion as Misrecognition of Display
The conceptual framework establishes delusion as the misrecognition of lhundrub's spontaneous display (rtsal snang) as separate, external objects. The basis does not change; only the perception of its display changes through non-recognition. The non-dual display (gnyis su med pa'i snang ba) appears as dualistic subject-object through the error of self-grasping (bdag por bzung ba). The reversal (bzlog pa) of self-appearance back into the conditional basis describes how what should be recognized as self-display is instead projected outward as separate phenomena. The framework establishes that delusion is not in the appearance but in the grasping ('dzin)—the failure to recognize appearance as the basis's own display.
