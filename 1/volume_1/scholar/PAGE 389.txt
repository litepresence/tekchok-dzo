[15963-15999] [STRUCTURE] Fourth Vision: Exhaustion of Phenomena
The text presents the fourth vision (chos nyid zad pa) as the exhaustion of phenomena into dharmatā. The structure establishes: (1) complete dissolution of dualistic perception, (2) recognition that phenomena are dharmatā, and (3) full enlightenment.

[15963-15999] [PHILOLOGY] Fourth Vision Terminology
The term chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba (vision of exhaustion into dharmatā) identifies the fourth stage. The compound chos thams cad chos nyid du zad pa (all phenomena exhausting into dharmatā) describes the process. The phrase mngon par rdzogs pa'i sangs rgyas (fully manifest Buddha) establishes the result.

[15963-15999] [CONTEXT] Complete Realization
The text presents the fourth vision as complete realization. There is no longer any distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, phenomena and dharmatā. This is the culmination of the Dzogchen path of thödgal.

[15963-15999] [CONCEPT] Exhaustion as Completion
The text conceptualizes the fourth vision as exhaustion—not destruction but recognition. Phenomena do not disappear; they are recognized as dharmatā. Exhaustion is the end of duality, not the end of appearance.
