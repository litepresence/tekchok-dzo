[426-428] [CONTEXT] # Second Emanation Continued: Akṣobhya's Teaching
**Analysis:** The second emanation (Light Akṣobhya) teaches the fivefold tantra structure (*sku gsung thugs yon tan 'phrin las kyi rgyud lnga*) to a retinue of 200,000 ḍākinīs. The lifespan is specified as *bye ba gzig thub pa'i dus*—one hundred million years. This astronomical timeframe reflects the cosmic scale of Saṃbhogakāya dimensions, where time functions differently than in the human realm.

The five tantras correspond to the five aspects (*sku gsung thugs yon tan 'phrin las*) that permeate Nyingma tantric classification.

The reference to Āmrapālī (*'tsho byed* = "life-giver/mango-tree") invokes the famous courtesan who donated her mango grove to the Buddha, symbolizing the transformation of ordinary pleasure into the path. The six pāramitās represent the mainstream Mahāyāna path integrated into the Dzogchen framework.

The Raurava charnel ground is one of the eight major charnel grounds (*dur khrod chen po brgyad*) in tantric cosmology, associated with wrathful deities and direct confrontation with death/impermanence.
