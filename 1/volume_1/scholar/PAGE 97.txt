[3602-3610] [STRUCTURE] The Three Sections Defined
**Analysis:** Lines 3602-3610 define the three sections of Atiyoga:

**1. Mind Section (*sems sde*) [3602, 3605-3606]:**
- For those with conceptual mind (*yid can*)
- No phenomena (*chos*) other than self-mind (*rang sems*)
- Various (*sna tshogs*) mind section
- Intent: stopping what changes into other than self-arisen wisdom

**2. Expanse Section (*klong sde*) [3603, 3607-3608]:**
- For those with spacious mind (*nam mkha' can*)
- Dharmatā Samantabhadri's expanse (*chos nyid kun tu bzang mo'i klong*)
- No other destination (*'gro sa gshan med*)
- Intent: stopping what arises as other than expanse of dharmatā

**3. Instruction Section (*man ngag sde*) [3604, 3609-3610]:**
- For those free from sequence and effort (*rim rtsol bral*)
- Bringing crucial points (*gnad thog tu 'bebs pa*)
- Intent: stopping what strays from meaning by being not-crucial (*gnad ma yin pa*)

**Ultimate Point [3611-3612]:**
- These do not transcend the three views (*'dod pa gsum*)
- Called: Great Perfection of Ground-Path-Result Liberation (*don gyis dri lan gZhi lam 'bras bu rnam grol gyi rdzogs pa chen po*)

[3613-3630] [CONCEPT] Mind Section: Ground as Change
**Analysis:** Lines 3613-3630 present the Mind Section's view:

**Characterization [3614]:**
- *gZhi mdung gyur du smra ba'i rdzogs pa chen po* — Great Perfection asserting ground as change/transformation

**Two Divisions [3615-3617]:**
1. *sna tshogs sems yin du smra ba* — Asserting various as mind
2. *sems kyi phyogs yin du smra ba* — Asserting as mind-aspect

**Analysis of "Mind" [3618-3629]:**
- Cittamātra (*sems tsam*) and Real Aspectarian (*don yod pa*) — both negated
- "Meaning" (*don*) not established as mere mind
- Mind not established as mere meaning
- Various but not dependent
- No cause or characteristics in mind
- Therefore not various mind
- No establishment even of "external meaning non-existence"
- Conventionally not established as mental imputation

**Key Insight [3626-3630]:**
- Being various, nothing is stopped
- Being mind, variousness not established
- Called: Great Perfection beyond acceptance/rejection
- Various appearances not transcending one mind's wheel
- Mind-itself understood as various

[3631-3642] [CONCEPT] Mind-Aspect Section: Six Subdivisions
**Analysis:** Lines 3631-3642 present the second Mind Section subdivision:

**Essence [3632-3635]:**
- *ngo bo snang phyogs yin* — Nature is appearance-aspect
- *sems phyogs snang yin* — Mind-aspect is appearance
- Whatever appears is mind
- Mind-itself shines as self-arisen wisdom
- Called: Unceasing play of mind-aspect, self-arisen

**Six Divisions [3636-3642]:**
1. *'bras bu sems kyi byung sar 'dod pa'i sems phyogs* — Mind-aspect asserting result as mind's source
2. *gol sgrib las 'das pa'i sems phyogs* — Mind-aspect beyond error and obscuration
3. *gtan tshigs 'khrugs sdebs kyi sems phyogs* — Mind-aspect of reasoning and connection
4. *rgya chad phyogs lhung med pa rang byung ye shes kyi sems phyogs* — Mind-aspect of self-arisen wisdom without extreme or partiality
5. *phyogs 'dzin dngos po rang grub pa'i sems phyogs* — Mind-aspect of aspect-holding self-established entity
6. *grub mtha' blo bral shan 'byed kyi sems phyogs* — Mind-aspect of tenets, beyond mind, distinction-making

[3643-3649] [CONCEPT] First Mind-Aspect: Source-Result
**Analysis:** Lines 3643-3649 present the first subdivision:

**Core View:**
- Dharmatā has no change-place (*'gyur sa med*) [3644]
- Therefore no transformation in mind
- Self-liberated dharmas (*chos can rang grol*) as result-source
- Uncompounded (*'dus ma byas*), spontaneously accomplished, ground-awakened
- Samsara without beginning, unproduced end

**Three Characteristics [3646-3649]:**
- *ye gzhag* — Primordially established (no repetition)
- *rang gzhag* — Self-established (no antidote)
- *'bad rtsol med* — Without effort (beyond extremes)
- Called: Spontaneous accomplishment beyond extremes
