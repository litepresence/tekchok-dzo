[00001-00051] [CONCEPT] Support and Distinction: Architecture of Meditative Loci

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage completes the four-lamp exposition by analyzing supports (rten) and distinctions (khyad par). The organizational structure: (1) general support, (2) specific supports for each lamp, (3) distinction between support and object, (4) distinctive characteristics of each lamp's function. The passage emphasizes practical outcomes: distant-cast destroys saṃsāra, wisdom generates realization, sphere expands appearances, expanse empties delusion.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: rten (support/āśraya), brten pa (supported/āśrita), las dang bag chags (karma and latencies), 'khor ba 'jig (destroying saṃsāra), ka dag gi la gshegs (proceeding to original purity). The term "mig rgyang zhags" (eye distant-cast) specifies the ocular technique. "Me tog" (flower/blossom) metaphorically indicates the efflorescence of appearance. The phrase "myang 'das mtshams su reg nus" (able to touch the juncture of cessation and transcendence) indicates proximity to liberation.

- **[CONTEXT]** The integration of karma (las) and latencies (bag chags) with lamp-practice reflects the tantric assumption that subtle body work purifies karmic obstructions. The *Thal 'gyur* citation emphasizes that the pure pristine cognition lamp serves as the basis for both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, indicating the non-dual ground (gzhi). The "channel-root nāḍī" (rtsa ba na da) refers to the subtle channel at the heart center where consciousness resides.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents the four lamps as soteriological engines: each operates through a specific support (appearances, word-meaning, consciousness-channel-space, inner-outer dharma-light-body) to produce distinctive effects. The "vajra fortress of great secret" (gsang chen rdo rje'i rdzong) metaphor indicates that these practices produce irreversible realization. The passage emphasizes "familiarization" (goms pa) as the transformative mechanism, distinguishing mere experience from liberated recognition. The final section provides specific technical instructions for eye-gaze (sgo mi 'gul ba, gzigs stangs gcun pa) and visualization (thig le), bridging phenomenological description and practical methodology.

- **[VARIANT]** No manuscript variants attested.
