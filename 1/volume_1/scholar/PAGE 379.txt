[00001-00007] [STRUCTURE] Establishing Transformation Measures
**Analysis:** This section fulfills the third division—'gyur tshad gtan la dbab pa (definitive establishment of transformation measures). The base calculation: for one person matured in body in prime condition (lus su smin nas na tshod dar la bab pa), the daily 'byung bzhi so so'i rlung gi 'gyur tshad (individual four-element wind transformation measure) is: sa'i rlung = 5,400; chu, me, rlung winds also 5,400 each; total = 21,600. This establishes the standard wind count for prime adulthood.

[00007-00014] [PHILOLOGY] Age-based and Condition-based Variations
**Analysis:** The text notes variations: gzhon pa (youth) lacks 360 [winds] due to undeveloped elements ('byung ba ma rgyas pas); rgas pa (aged) lacks 558 due to deteriorated elemental order ('byung ba'i gral nyams pas). The prognostic correlation: rlung gi 'pho ba ring na tshe mthar skyol (long transference reaches life-end); thung na mi skyol (short does not reach). The terms drag na (if forceful), zhen na (if attached), dal na (if slow), bul na (if sluggish) establish the quality-based prognostic indicators.

[00014-00036] [CONTEXT] Wind Quality Pathologies and Characteristics
**Analysis:** The passage presents extensive pathological correlations: drag → bsod nams/long, but suffering if attached; dal → illness-free cyclic existence; bul → weapon accumulation, non-virtuous mind; 'byil → constant non-virtue, fluctuating vitality; rgod → agitated mind, unkindness; rab tu rgod → quick death-time; bying → suffering, grief, lamentation; 'khyor → mind not reaching abiding mode, non-virtue; dal → life-end expansion, constant bliss; 'khyig → constant enemies, litigation basis; 'khyog → activity-attachment, short life; 'gyur → great resources but illness; rgal → unsuccessful body-speech actions; 'phel → quick accomplishment of peaceful/expanding activities.

[00036-00041] [STRUCTURE] Life-span Calculation by Wind Deficiency
**Analysis:** The text establishes specific life-span reductions based on wind deficiency from the prime 21,600: lacking 300 → one year death-time; lacking 50 → two years; lacking 32 → three years; lacking 21 → four years; 1/8 lacking → seven months; 1/6 lacking → five months; 1/4 lacking → one month; 1/10 lacking → 29 days; lacking 20 → 18 days; lacking 30 → 10 days; lacking 40 → 7 days; lacking 60 → 5 days. This establishes the precise arithmetic correlation between wind decline and temporal prognostication.

[00041-00041] [CONCEPT] Two-fold Soteriological Application
**Analysis:** The passage distinguishes two applications of rlung gi rtsis sbyor (wind calculation): 'jig rten pa (worldly)—calculating tshe (lifespan), bsod nams (merit), bde sdug (pleasure/pain); 'das pa (transcendent)—divided into 'gyur tshad (transformation measure) and 'pho dus (transference time). Daytime divides into twelve transformations for elemental function activities and virtue/non-virtue conceptuality; nighttime has similar divisions but emphasizes ye shes kyi rlung 'phel (wisdom wind increase).
