**Near Cause of Destruction [6198-6201]:**
Citation from *Thal 'gyur*: "Teaching destruction's near cause, in those individual places, person called wrong desire, each by all teaching, destroying near cause is."

**First Period Signs [6202-6216]:**
In Jambudvipa's west, a king with:
- Six-fingered hand
- Green-faced so-lha before him  
- Black mole on right forearm
- Wicked shape
- Extremely fearful

These signs indicate sixty years of teaching darkness.

Then Glorious-holder (*dpal 'dzin*) holds the teaching for 1300 years, after which:
- In Jambudvipa's north, at Luminous (*gzi brjid ldan*) mountain root
- An ascetic lacking loving mind
- Two right ears
- Three-cornered upward-covering eyes
- Fighting with tirthikas

Another sixty years of teaching darkness.

**Second Period [6221-6235]:**
After that, Bliss-god (*bde ba'i lha*) brings 100 years of flourishing. Then in Jambudvipa's north-east, at great unfathomable river's root, a king with:
- Merit-endowed body
- Only one eye
- Coarse limbs
- Strong body
- Adorned with throwing and arts

This one snatches Dharma-doers, leading to sixty years of teaching darkness before transferring elsewhere.

**Third Period [6236-6254]:**

This causes sixty years of darkness.

**Sixth Period [6259-6267]:**
