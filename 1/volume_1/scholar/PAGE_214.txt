[8788-8814] [STRUCTURE] Completely Unelaborated: Four-fold Perfection

This section presents the completely unelaborated empowerment (rab tu spros med dbang) through its four-fold structure: outer (phyi), inner (nang), secret (gsang), and perfect (yongs rdzogs). The structure establishes the culmination of empowerment as spontaneous recognition beyond all constructs.

[8788-8806] [PHILOLOGY] Four-fold Partition and Spontaneity Terms

The text employs completion vocabulary:
- "Rab tu spros med" (completely unelaborated): Ultimate level
- "Phyogs bzhi" (four directions): Spatial completeness
- "'Dug stangs" (sitting posture): Physical manifestation
- "Gzigs stangs" (gaze manner): Visual expression
- "Bstun nas" (in accordance with): Natural following

The particle "ni" marks partition: "phyi nang gsang ba yongs rdzogs bzhi las" (from the four: outer, inner, secret, perfect). The enumerative "las" indicates source.

[8807-8832] [CONTEXT] Thalgyur Citation and Natural Spontaneity

The Thalgyur citation:
"Rab tu spros pa med pa la / sems kyi dkyil 'khor sgo phyed la / lus kyi 'dug stangs nges par brtsam / de la goms te gzigs stangs sbyar"

This establishes:
- Level: Rab tu spros med (completely unelaborated)
- Method: Sems kyi dkyil 'khor (mind's mandala)
- Support: Lus kyi 'dug stangs (body posture)
- Practice: Gzigs stangs sbyar (gaze application)

[8833-8858] [CONCEPT] Four Aspects of Complete Unelaboration

Each aspect reveals different dimensions:
1. Phyi (outer):
   - 'Dug stangs ston pa (shows sitting posture)
   - Physical manifestation
   - Visible to all

2. Nang (inner):
   - Lta stangs ston pa (shows gaze manner)
   - Subtle direction
   - Perceptible to practitioners

3. Gsang (secret):
   - Phyogs bzhi la 'dug stangs dang gzigs stangs bstun pa
   - Four directions with posture and gaze
   - Sangs rgyas kyi zhing du spyod pa (activity in Buddha fields)

4. Yongs rdzogs (perfect):
   - Song cig la sogs pa tshig gi brda don sprad pa
   - Word symbols like "go!"
   - Complete communication beyond words

[STRUCTURE] Three-fold Analysis of Empowerment Divisions

[8859-8884] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative and Divisive Terminology

The text employs analytical vocabulary:
- "Dbye ba" (division): Classification, distinction
- "Nges pa" (certainty): Definitive determination
- "Rang ngo" (self-face): Own nature, identity
- "Rnam 'phrul" (manifestation): Display, emanation
- "Gsangs pa" (secret): Hidden, profound

The particle "ni" marks analysis: "don gsum pa de ltar bskur ba'i dbang gi dbye ba la gsum ste" (third topic: the divisions of empowerment bestowal are three). The enumerative "ste" establishes count.

[8885-8910] [CONTEXT] Three-fold Presentation Framework

The three divisions:
1. Dbang bzhi nges pa'i dbye bas mdor bstan
   - Four empowerments definitively divided
   - Brief presentation

2. Rang ngo'i dbye bas rgyas par bshad
   - Self-nature divisions
   - Extensive explanation

3. Rnam par 'phrul pa'i dbye bas shin tu rgya cher spros pa
   - Manifestation divisions
   - Very extensive elaboration

This follows standard Tibetan scholastic:
- Mdor bstan (brief presentation)
- Rgyas bshad (extensive explanation)
- Spros pa (elaboration)

[8911-8936] [CONCEPT] From Certainty to Manifestation

The progression represents:
1. Certainty (nges pa):
   - Definitive structure
   - Unchangeable framework
   - Dbang bzhi (four empowerments)

2. Self-nature (rang ngo):
   - Intrinsic aspects
   - Inner dimensions
   - Rang ngo'i dbye ba (self-nature divisions)

3. Manifestation (rnam 'phrul):
   - Display for beings
   - Adaptation to capacity
   - Skillful means (thabs)

[STRUCTURE] Four Empowerments: Definitive Determination

[8937-8962] [PHILOLOGY] Definitive and Progressive Terminology

The text employs certainty vocabulary:
- "Nges pa" (certainty): Definitive determination
- "Mthor bstan" (brief presentation): Summary
- "Smin so" (ripening signs): Indicators of maturation
- "Dpe mtshon" (example illustration): Analogical explanation
- "Rang bzhin" (own nature): Intrinsic character

The particle "ni" marks determination: "dang po ni sprul bcas kyi dbang" (first is elaborated empowerment). The emphatic "o" confirms identity.

[8963-8988] [CONTEXT] Four Empowerments in Sequence

The four empowerments definitively determined:
1. Spros bcas (elaborated):
   - Full ritual structure
   - External mandala
   - Sequential bestowal

2. Spros med (unelaborated):
   - Mantra and blessing
   - Internal process
   - Direct introduction

3. Shin tu spros med (thoroughly unelaborated):
   - Wisdom recognition
   - Beyond subject-object
   - Natural presence

4. Rab tu spros med (completely unelaborated):
   - Ultimate nature
   - No reference point
   - Spontaneous perfection

[8989-9014] [CONCEPT] Definitive Structure of Empowerment

The four-fold structure is definitive because:
1. Gradual progression necessary:
   - Phyi sprul ma bchad na (if outer constructs not cut)
   - Snang shes tshogs pa'i sprul ma mi chod
   - Appearances and consciousness constructs continue

2. Sequential requirements:
   - Each level prepares for next
   - Impossible to skip stages
   - Natural unfoldment

3. Correspondence to capacities:
   - Different beings need different approaches
   - Four empowerments match four capacities
   - Complete range covered

**Summary:**

Page 214 presents the completely unelaborated empowerment's four-fold structure, three-fold analysis framework, and definitive determination of four empowerments. Philologically, the text employs completion vocabulary, four-fold partition terms, analytical enumeration, and certainty markers. Contextual sources include Thalgyur root tantra and standard Tibetan scholastic methodology. Conceptually, the section demonstrates four aspects of spontaneous recognition, three-level presentation from certainty to manifestation, and the definitive structure as necessitated by gradual requirements and capacity correspondence—culminating in complete empowerment as spontaneous perfection.
