[17375-17406] [CONTEXT] Polemical Analysis: Alaya as Dharmakaya?
**Analysis:** Longchenpa addresses the erroneous view (*'dod pa*) that identifies alaya with dharmakaya. This view has proponents among:
1. Common treatises (*thun mong gi bstan bcos*): Alaya as support of pure-impure all; dharmakaya as pure's stainless thusness
2. Some mantra practitioners (*sngags kha cig*): Alaya transformed abode becomes dharmadhatu wisdom, essence body

Scriptural citations used to support this view:
- "Alaya is all's basis / nirvana's basis mother also is"
- "Alaya transformed abode is dharmadhatu wisdom, essence body"

[17387-17406] [CONCEPT] Logical Refutation (*gnod pa*):
If alaya were dharmakaya, two absurd consequences (*thal ba*) follow:
1. Dharmakaya would be stained (*dri ma can du thal*)
2. Alaya producing container-world delusion would mean dharmakaya produces delusion

Further absurdity: If accepted, buddhas would again become sentient beings (*sangs rgyas nas slar sems can du 'khrul par thal ba*)

Scriptural refutations (*lung gis gnod*):
- *kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long*: "Considering alaya as dharmakaya is deviating from me"
- *rig pa rang shar*: "Some consider alaya as dharmakaya / To give answer, teaching established / Alaya's characteristic thus / Then that spoke answer / All complete therefore alaya / From that all complete / Buddha becoming sentient being reason / Why all complete / Intermittent possessor becomes / Why various arises / Sometimes buddha becomes / Sometimes sentient being becomes / Why definite abiding / Then asked words reversed / Then if alaya nonexistent / Then asked answer given / Alaya conceptualization holder / Various delusion knowing stained / Alaya ignorance entity is"

[17420-17447] [CONCEPT] Essential Distinction (*dbye dgos*) and Simile:
The distinction is essential. From *klong drug pa*: "Therefore alaya and dharmakaya not distinguished: like form one different-holding knowing, cannot appear objects individually."

Simile: Ocean and boat (*rgya mtsho dang gru*):
- Dharmakaya: Like pure ocean, rigpa unstained never experienced stain, sphere ocean clear, nowhere established, nowhere not arising, door not ceased, primordial field nature pure, adventitious stain separated, that sphere force-place obtained, pure twofold-possessing part
- Alaya: Like boat on ocean not dissolved, when deluded from primordial sphere, ground ignorance all's support, pervader, essence abiding boat-like, mind mental factors action latencies delusion many filled

The *rang shar* citation (17436-17439):
- Alaya and dharmakaya's example
- Ocean and boat's manner path-arisen
- Sleep and waking manner
- Faculty distinction possessing

[17440-17447] [CONCEPT] Fundamental Asymmetry:
Rigpa unstained dharmakaya's essence at all times not reversing, exists as final liberation basis. Alaya like sleep, delusion-appearance all dreams' basis became, must be awakened from—distinction extremely great.

Sleep and dream must be reversed; self-rigpa need not be reversed. Dharmakaya is basis to be recognized; familiarized in that state; fruition liberation place identified. Alaya and dependent dharmas are to be purified stains.

**Summary:** Page 408 presents Longchenpa's refutation of the alaya-dharmakaya identity view, using logical consequences and scriptural citations. The ocean-boat simile illustrates the fundamental asymmetry between the unstained ground and the deluded support.
