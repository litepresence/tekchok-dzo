[3352-3354] [CONCEPT] Mahayoga Path Structure: Cause Yoga and Great Yoga
**Analysis:** Lines 3352-3354 describe the progressive entry into Mahayoga practice:

**Three Stages:**
1. **Mthun by rnal 'byor** (Cause Yoga) — Supporting/generating yoga
   - *lam skye ba'i rim pa* — Sequence of generating the path
   - Foundation for subsequent practices

2. **Rnal 'byor chen po'i lus su 'jug pa** — Entry into Great Yoga body
   - *rnal 'byor chen po* — Mahayoga, the Great Yoga
   - Integration into the tantric body/mandala

3. **Rtogs pa rang grol** — Self-liberated realization
   - Fruition of the practice

**Key Terms:**
- *mthun by* — Supporting cause, generating condition
- *lam skye ba* — Path generation (sequence of stages)
- *rang grol* — Self-liberation (spontaneous release)

[3355-3359] [PHILOLOGY] Ripening and Self-Arisen Wisdom
**Analysis:** Line 3355 marks the topic of "clarified result" (*'bras bu gsal bar byas pa*).

**Ripening Result (*smin pa*) [3356-3357]:**
- *sems kyi 'bras bu sna tshogs su snang* — Mind's result appearing variously
- *sna tshogs su grol ba* — Liberated variously
- Therefore called *rang byung gi ye shes* — Self-arisen wisdom

**Line 3358-3359:**
- *'bad rtsol gyis bsgrub tu med pa* — Cannot be accomplished through effort
- Called *sangs rgyas kyi rnam pa thams cad mkhyen pa'i ye shes* — Wisdom of Buddha's omniscience

**Critical Distinction:** Liberation occurs spontaneously (*rang grol*) through recognition, not through deliberate cultivation.

[3360-3361] [CONCEPT] Great Yoga of Realization
**Analysis:** Line 3360 presents the key insight of Mahayoga:

**Structural Logic:**
- Ground (*gzhi*) as object to be accomplished (*bsgrub bya*)
- Path (*lam*) as that which accomplishes (*sgrub byed*)
- Therefore called *rtogs pa chen po'i rnal 'byor* — Great Yoga of Realization

**Result:** Through self-accomplishment (*rang bsgrub pa*), called *sangs rgyas kyi thugs rnam par dag pa'i ye shes* — Wisdom of Buddha's pure mind.

**Doxographical Point:** This reverses conventional causality—ground is not different from fruition; realization makes path manifest.

[3362-3367] [STRUCTURE] Fivefold Accomplishment (sgrub pa) System
**Analysis:** The accomplishment-focused approach (*sgrub pa gtso bo*) has five divisions corresponding to five Buddha families:

1. **Body Accomplishment** (*sku'i sgrub pa*) [3363]:
   - Mañjusrī mandala wheel (*'jam dpal gyi dkyil 'khor gyi 'khor lo*)
   - As path (*lam du 'khyer ba*)

2. **Speech Accomplishment** (*gsung gi sgrub pa*) [3364]:
   - Padma family Buddha (*padma rigs kyi sangs rgyas*)

3. **Mind Accomplishment** (*thugs kyi sgrub pa*) [3365]:
   - Heruka (*khrag 'thung*), Vajra family Buddha

4. **Quality Accomplishment** (*yon tan gyi sgrub pa*) [3366]:
   - Ratna family Buddha

5. **Action Accomplishment** (*'phrin las kyi sgrub pa*) [3367]:
   - Karma family Buddha

**Structural Principle:** Each accomplishment non-dual with its deity, entered through three samadhis (*ting nge 'dzin gsum*).

[3368-3375] [CONCEPT] Essence, Etymology, Purpose, Result of Accomplishment
**Analysis:** Standard fourfold definition:

**Essence (*ngo bo*) [3368-3369]:**
- Non-dual with individual deity (*so so'i lha dang gnyis su med pa*)
- Entered through three samadhis

**Etymology (*nges tshig*) [3370-3371]:**
- Through accomplishment, one accomplishes (*sgrub pa*) the single hero's (*dpa' bo gcig pa*) mandala wheel

**Purpose (*dgos pa*) [3372-3373]:**
- Accomplishing path brings result to manifestation

**Result ('bras bu) [3374-3375]:**
- Becoming Buddha of respective family (*so so'i rigs kyi sangs rgyas*)

[3376-3383] [STRUCTURE] Various-Path-Transform Approach
**Analysis:** Line 3376 introduces diverse path transformations (*sna tshogs lam 'gyur*):

**Types:**
1. **Scattered** (*thor bu ba*) [3377]
2. **Subtle** (*phra mo*) [3378]
3. **Net** (*dr ba* — Skt. *jāla*) [3378]

**Two Categories Summarized:**
- Tantra (*rgyud*) [3380]
- Nopika (Upadesa) (*no pi ka*) [3381]

**Tantra Divisions [3380-3382]:**
- Generation stage focused (*bskyed rim gtso bo*)
- Completion stage focused (*rdzogs rim gtso bo*)
- Union focused (*zung 'jug gtso bo*)

Including incomplete (*ma rdzogs*) and partial/dum bu (*cha shas dum bu*) approaches.
