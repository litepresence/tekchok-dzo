[18761-18800] [STRUCTURE] Summary of Volume 1 Part 1

4. The twenty-five wisdoms (Pages 430-432)
5. The wisdom pervasive of objects (Pages 432-434)
6. The tathagatagarbha presentation (Pages 434-440)

The section prepares for transition to the systematic presentation of ground, path, and fruition that will occupy subsequent volumes.

3. **Analogical reasoning:** Water/bubbles, sun/clouds, embryo/womb
4. **Scriptural citation:** Authority-based demonstration
5. **Logical consequence:** Thal gyur arguments
6. **Subtle body mapping:** Anatomical localization of psychological states

[18901-18950] [STRUCTURE] Transition preparation to Volume 2
**Analysis:** The pages 421-440 serve as the synthesis and conclusion of Volume 1's foundational presentation. They:
- Establish the absolute distinction between samsaric mind and nirvanic wisdom

  - Fruition ('bras bu) in final volumes

[18951-19000] [CONCEPT] The Four Lamps integration
**Analysis:** Throughout these pages, the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) are implicitly integrated:
1. **sgyu ma'i sgron ma:** The illusory nature of sems-based appearances
2. **sod nas sgron ma:** The breakthrough when non-awareness ceases
3. **rtags kyi sgron ma:** The signs of warmth, measure, and realization
4. **thig le'i sgron ma:** The sphere-markers of realization in the heart-center

This integration demonstrates how the four lamps framework underlies the entire presentation.
