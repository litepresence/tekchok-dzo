[18496-18569] [CONTEXT] Extensive citation from Rig pa rang shar on twenty-five
**Analysis:** The citation from Self-Arising Rigpa Tantra provides the definitive explanations of each of the twenty-five wisdoms with their specific characteristics. Each is defined through:
- Its essential nature (ngo bo)
- Its functional characteristics (byed las)
- Its relation to appearances and emptiness
- Its transcendence of conceptual limitations

[18570-18572] [STRUCTURE] Concluding citation
**Analysis:** The section concludes with the affirmation that the three kayas and five wisdoms are attained through abiding in this wisdom. This integrates the wisdom-analysis with the fruition framework.

[18573-18610] [CONCEPT] Third category: yul la khyab pa'i ye shes
**Analysis:** The wisdom pervasive of objects is identified with:
- nang gi rang gdangs 'od lnga (inner self-resonance five lights)
- de las kha dog lnga'i snang ba (five-colored appearances from that)
- ye shes bzhi sbyor gyi snang ba (appearances of four wisdom conjunctions)

[18611-18641] [CONTEXT] Citation from Thal 'gyur on three wisdom appearances
**Analysis:** The citation presents:
1. **snang ba'i ye shes (wisdom of appearance):** Emerging from the five elements, marvelous to behold
2. **stong pa'i ye shes (wisdom of emptiness):** Not found through analysis, cutting through the three realms, severing five-door attachment objects
3. **yul gyi ye shes (wisdom of objects):** Beyond all reference points, transcending words and concepts, self-liberated in original purity

[18642] [STRUCTURE] Transition to fourth topic
**Analysis:** The particle don marks transition to the fourth major division: individual meanings (so so'i don).

[18643-18655] [CONTEXT] Citation on yul gyi ye shes
**Analysis:** The citation establishes:
- From forms and sounds (gzugs dang sgra), fivefold trainings arise
- The experience of knowing (shes pa'i nyams) is the exhaustion of appearance
- Progress like waxing moon (yar ngo)
- Signs (rtags) of warmth (drod), measure (tshad), and marks indicate

[18656-18673] [CONTEXT] Scriptural citations on tathagatagarbha
**Analysis:** Multiple authorities establish the universality of buddha-nature:
1. **Thun mong:** Tathagatagarbha Sutra - buddha-essence abides primordially in all beings
2. **Rgyud bla ma (Uttaratantra):** 
   - rdzogs sangs sku ni 'phro phyir (perfect buddha-body radiates)
   - de bzhin nyid dbyer med phyir (suchness is undifferentiated)
   - rigs yod phyir (because of buddha-family/buddha-nature)
3. **Thun mong ma yin pa (Uncommon):** Brtag gnyis - beings are buddhas obscured by adventitious stains
4. **Doha:** Masters commenting on treatises have not recognized buddha in mind

[18674-18693] [CONCEPT] The obscured nature of buddha-nature
**Analysis:** Longchenpa explains why buddha-nature is not directly visible:
- sku'i snang ba 'od dang bcas pa rdos bcas kyis gtum (body-appearance with light obscured by the egg-shell of body)
- Currently dwells like sun behind bodily clouds (lus kyi sprin rum)
- Can be pointed out (ngo sprad) through signs (rtags thig le stong pa'i sgron ma)
- Speech obscured by words; mind obscured by conceptual mind

[18694-18718] [CONTEXT] Citation from Seng ge rtsal rdzogs chen po'i rgyud
**Analysis:** The citation from the Great Lion Power Perfection Tantra establishes:
- Ye shes dag pa'i snang ba gnas (pure wisdom appearance abides)
- Like embryo in womb or chick in egg—obscured yet present
- When rnam rtog lus 'di bor ma thag (immediately upon leaving conceptual body)
- Rang snang yul dang phrad par 'gyur (meets with self-appearance objects)
- Ye nas gnas pa'i rang rig (primordially abiding self-awareness)
- Ngo bo rtog med mthong bar 'gyur (essence without conceptions becomes seen)
