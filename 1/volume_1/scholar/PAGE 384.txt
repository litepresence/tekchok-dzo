[16069-16078] [CONCEPT] Clarification of Outer and Inner Space
**Analysis:** Lines 16069-16070 refute the mistaken view: space is not established as related to a person, while the lamp follows whether a person exists or not. Line 16071 clarifies: the inner sky's blue tonality appearing outward is called the "outer space" (phyi'i dbyings). This merely indicates the opening of space as the ground-of-arising (go 'byed 'char gzhi'i sa cha), not actual space. The actual is deep blue (mthing ga), while space is the inner-inner space (nang gi nang dbyings). Though these two are called outer space and inner space separately, they should be understood as merely the unclear becoming clear like the rainbow light in a crystal house ('ja' 'od kyi khur khyim). Line 16076-16077 clarifies it is not like "inner toward here, outer toward there"—rather, knowing outer and inner as that appearing to arise from that.

[16079-16083] [CONCEPT] The Five Lights and Luminosity
**Analysis:** The appearing as five lights ('od lngar gsal ba) is the self-tonality of mind's self-luminous nature (sems nyid rang bzhin gyis 'od gsal ba'i rang gdangs shar ba). This is purified of: (1) the defilement of substantial things (dngos po'i dri ma), (2) the defilement of intellectual discerning wisdom (yid dpyod shes rab kyi dri ma), and (3) the defilement of bad-conceptual mind (ngan rtog sems kyi dri ma). The term "lamp" (sgron ma) is used from the aspect of dispelling the darkness of karma and bag chags when seeing that appearance.

[16084-16089] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma
**Analysis:** The first of the four lamps condensed from the four chakras—lines 16084-16089 explain the etymology: "rgyang" (far) because wind initially draws upward into the mother's womb from afar; "zhags" (lasso/snare) because consciousness, wind, and mind with their causes and conditions are gathered into one and bound ('ching bar byed pas); "chu" (water) because the six tastes' bliss increases and expands the essence-eye; "sgron ma" (lamp) because at the tip the five sense-faculties' and five wisdoms' particular functions are realized, and dharmata appears directly to the sense-faculties, dispelling samsaric darkness.

[16090-16102] [CONCEPT] Analysis of thig le stong pa'i sgron ma
**Analysis:** Joined with the relative causal bindu: "thig" means descending the essence through posture; "le" means after sealing with syllables like HUM, identifying wisdom; "stong pa" means reversing the bindu, applying capacity, mixing with wind, and dissolving bliss into emptiness—this is mind's activity. "Sgron ma" means dispelling darkness through that meaning. Joined with the ultimate wisdom bindu: the bindu is the three unchanging [aspects] of awareness's own nature through gaze and looking (lta stangs kyi gzigs stangs rig pa rang gi ngo bo mi 'gyur ba gsum). "Le" is the appearing light's round rim ('od kyi mu khyud zlum por shar ba). "Stong pa" means: that appearance is not established as substantial or characteristic, so the four elements cannot harm it; being self-appearance, others cannot see it even if shown; being luminous, it is free from elaboration extremes and dispels ignorance-darkness.

[16103-16129] [CONCEPT] The Self-Arisen Wisdom Lamp (shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma)
**Analysis:** The analysis of shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma: "shes" because wind-abiding is the main channel essential; "rab" because the essential of wind's drawing and collecting by number is supreme; "rang byung" because arising from and abiding in dharmata, the supreme sense-faculties are liberated in three instants; "sgron ma" because wind exhausting, it liberates into space. Joined with luminous appearance: "shes" because inner wisdom makes self-tonality self-aware appear to the sense-faculties; "rab" because being the field where all deluded appearances cease, the vajra-chain bindu with thig le and thig phran is most supreme. Within this: letters, hand-symbols, forms, etc., appear, and when the ten [elements] like earth cease, they appear clearly—the "exhaustion wisdom" (zad par gyi ye shes). "Rang" because that appearance with wisdom's reasoning-basis arises from oneself without coming from elsewhere. "Byung" means established connection—making self-appearance arise from awareness. "Sgron ma" means the term is used for dispelling the darkness of mind and mental factors. The pure space lamp arises from seeing the essential of direct perception.
