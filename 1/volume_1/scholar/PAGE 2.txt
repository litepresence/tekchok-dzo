[36-45] [STRUCTURE] # Elaboration of the Three Kāyas
**Analysis:** This section continues the three-kāya exposition, now specifying the *longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku* (Enjoyment Body) through ten sub-topics. The structure follows the classical *mdzod* genre convention of presenting a topic, then enumerating its subdivisions (*sa bcad*).

[36-40] [CONCEPT] The Ten Aspects of Sambhogakāya
**Analysis:** Longchenpa enumerates ten dimensions (*rnam pa bcu*) of the Enjoyment Body:
1. **Nature** (*rang bzhin*) - Five-wisdom (*ye shes lnga*) essence
2. **Place** (*gnas*) - The five-certainties (*nges pa lnga*) realm
3. **Teacher** (*ston pa*) - Vairocana and four families
4. **Retinue** ('*khor*) - Ten-level bodhisattvas
5. **Time** (*dus*) - Continuous, unbroken
6. **Teaching** (*bstan pa*) - Great vehicle doctrines
7. **Form** (*sku*) - Supreme marks and signs
8. **Speech** (*gsung*) - Sixty qualities
9. **Mind** (*thugs*) - Wisdom awareness
10. **Activity** (*phrin las*) - Natural display

[41-45] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *ye shes lnga*
**Analysis:** The "five wisdoms" (*ye shes lnga*) are:
- *chos dbyings ye shes* (dharmadhātu) - Mirror-like wisdom's ground
- *me long ye shes* (mirror-like) - All appearances reflected without judgment
- *mnyam nyid ye shes* (equality) - Sameness of all phenomena
- *sor rtog ye shes* (discriminating) - Knowing particulars distinctly
- *bya grub ye shes* (accomplishing) - Benefit activities spontaneously fulfilled

The particle *ni* (emphatic) in line 40 marks this as a definitive statement (*nges pa*).

[46-55] [CONTEXT] # Pure Realm Cosmology
**Analysis:** The description of the pure realm (*dag pa'i zhing*) follows the *Ghanavyūha Sūtra* template:
- **Self-arisen palace** (*gzhal yas lhun grub*) - Not constructed, naturally manifesting
- **Five lights** (*'od lnga*) - The play of awareness as color/light
- **Four elements** ('*byung bzhi*) - Transmuted into ornament

This reflects the Nyingma view that pure realms are not locations but perceptual modalities.

[56-65] [CONCEPT] The Five Certainties (*nges pa lnga*)
**Analysis:** The *nges pa lnga* defines the Sambhogakāya dimension as:
1. Certain teacher (Dharmakāya Samantabhadra)
2. Certain retinue (tenth-level bodhisattvas)
3. Certain teaching (only Mahāyāna)
4. Certain place (Akanistha Ghanavyūha)
5. Certain time (continuous)

These "certainties" distinguish Sambhogakāya from Nirmāṇakāya, where all five are variable.

[66-75] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Analysis: *las* as Ablative
**Analysis:** In line 66, *yon tan bkod pa las* uses *las* in its ablative sense ("from"), not instrumental. This is crucial: the qualities are not instruments that create appearances, but sources from which appearance spontaneously (*lhun grub*) emerges. This distinction preserves the Nyingma view that manifestation is self-arisen, not caused.
