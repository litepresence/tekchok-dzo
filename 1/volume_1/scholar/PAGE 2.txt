[36-40] [STRUCTURE] # Perfect Teacher: Dharmakāya Level
**Analysis:** This section elaborates the first of three-kāya classification, focusing on *ston pa phun sum tshogs pa* (perfect teacher). The structure moves from Dharmakāya (Samantabhadra) through Sambhogakāya to Nirmāṇakāya, following the classical three-kāya exposition pattern.

[36] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *mnga' dbang rdzogs pa*
**Analysis:** The phrase "possessing complete dominion" (*mnga' dbang rdzogs pa*) uses the possessive particle *mnga'* to indicate Samantabhadra's sovereign nature as Dharmakāya. The term *rgyal ba kun tu bzang po* (Victorious Samantabhadra) identifies the primordial Buddha as "all-victorious" over all obscurations without beginning.

[37] [CONCEPT] Non-Dual Abiding
**Analysis:** The phrase *sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa'i dgongs pa* (intention where body and wisdom are non-dual and inseparable) establishes the ground-state as beyond subject-object bifurcation. The term *'du 'bral med pa* (non-dual/non-separate) negates both identity (*gcig*) and difference (*tha dad*), indicating the *dgongs pa* (intention/state) of enlightened awareness.

[38-40] [CONTEXT] Beyond Cause-Effect and Effort
**Analysis:** The phrase *rgyu 'bras bya rtsol las 'das pa* (beyond cause-effect and action-effort) is a definitive Dzogchen marker. It negates:
- *Rgyu 'bras* (cause-effect) - karmic causation
- *Bya rtsol* (action-effort) - deliberate practice

This establishes the Dharmakāya as *chos nyid* (dharmatā), the nature of reality uncompounded and spontaneous. The ablative particle *las* indicates transcendence "from" these categories.

[41-45] [STRUCTURE] # Perfect Place: Sambhogakāya Field
**Analysis:** Lines 41-45 shift to the second perfection (*gnas phun sum tshogs pa*) - the pure realm. The exposition follows the pattern: nature/blessing → field → display → teaching → wisdom.

[41] [PHILOLOGY] *Ngang ngam* Particle Ambiguity
**Analysis:** The disjunctive particle *ngang ngam* (or) presents two alternatives for the source of the pure field:
- *De nyid kyi ngang* (from that very nature)
- *Byin rlabs* (from blessing)

This preserves the ambiguity in the source text regarding whether manifestation arises from ground-nature or empowerment.

[42] [CONCEPT] Five Lights and Five Families
**Analysis:** The *'od lnga* (five lights) correlate with the *ye shes lnga* (five wisdoms), manifesting as the display of the five Buddha families (*rigs lnga*). The term *rang snang* (self-appearing) is crucial—it indicates these are not external existents but the spontaneous display (*rol pa*) of awareness itself.

[43-45] [CONTEXT] Spontaneous Accomplishment
**Analysis:** The phrase *rang snang lhun gyis grub pa* (spontaneously accomplished self-appearance) combines two key Dzogchen terms:
- *Rang snang* - self-appearing (not externally existent)
- *Lhun grub* - spontaneously accomplished (without effort)

The *rang chas ye shes* (self-arisen wisdom) is distinguished from constructed consciousness; it is *gdul bya* (trainees) object-beyond, meaning even advanced practitioners cannot reify it as an object of experience.

[46-51] [STRUCTURE] # Sixth Teacher: Complete Marks Body
**Analysis:** This section presents the Sambhogakāya teacher as Vajradhara (*rdo rje 'chang*) with complete marks (*mtshan rdzogs*). The "sixth" refers to the five Dhyani Buddhas plus Vajradhara as the tantric adibuddha. The fivefold retinue is enumerated: earth-dwellers, awareness-holders, ḍākiṇīs, accomplished ones, and self-appearance hosts.

[46] [PHILOLOGY] *Rtsal lam* Construction
**Analysis:** The compound *rtsal lam* (strength/skillfulness OR path) presents translational ambiguity. Here it functions as *rtsal* (dynamic display-power) combined with *byin rlabs* (blessing) as the means of manifestation. The genitive particle *gi* connects this power to the Akanisṭha field.

[47-51] [CONCEPT] Fivefold Retinue
**Analysis:** The enumeration uses the *dang* particle to link five categories:
1. *Sa la gnas pa* - Earth-dwellers (bodhisattvas)
2. *Rig pa 'dzin pa* - Awareness-holders (vidyādharas)
3. *Mkha' 'gro ma* - Sky-goers (ḍākiṇīs)
4. *Grub pa* - Accomplished ones (siddhas)
5. *Rang snang yongs su bkod pa'i tshogs* - Completely arranged self-appearance hosts

This represents the full maṇḍala assembly receiving the ocean-like tantra teachings.

[52-56] [STRUCTURE] # Perfect Teacher: Nirmāṇakāya Level
**Analysis:** Lines 52-56 present the third kāya level—the emanation body (*sprul pa'i sku*) that appears according to trainees' capacities (*gang la gang 'dul*). This is the dimension of skillful means (*thabs*) adapting to individual needs.

[52-53] [CONTEXT] Self-Appearance Individuality
**Analysis:** The phrase *'gro dag rang snang la snang ba so so* (appearing individually to beings' self-appearances) indicates the subjective nature of Nirmāṇakāya manifestation. It is not one teacher appearing to many, but manifestation tailored to each perceiver's *rang snang*.

[54-56] [PHILOLOGY] Three Baskets Enumeration
**Analysis:** The *sde snod gsum* (three baskets/collections) are listed with *dang* particles:
- *Mdo sde* (Sūtra)
- *'Dul ba* (Vinaya)
- *Mngon pa* (Abhidharma)

These appear as *theg pa sna tshogs* (various vehicles), indicating the causal vehicle teachings that prepare for the result vehicle.

[57-58] [STRUCTURE] # Vehicle Hierarchy Conclusion
**Analysis:** The page concludes by establishing the vehicle stratification: three causal vehicles serve as preparation (*rgyu dang thabs*) for the result vehicle, culminating in Dzogchen as the unsurpassable (*bla na med pa*) peak.

[57] [CONCEPT] Causal as Method
**Analysis:** The three vehicles of causal characteristics (*rgyu mtshan nyid kyi theg pa gsum*) function as *rgyu* (cause) and *thabs* (method) for entering the Vajra vehicle. This is not hierarchical denigration but functional classification—the causal vehicles prepare the recognition-ground for Atiyoga.

[58] [PHILOLOGY] *Yongs su rdzogs pa'i rtse mo*
**Analysis:** The phrase "completely complete peak" (*yongs su rdzogs pa'i rtse mo*) uses the terminative particle *mo* to indicate culmination. The emphatic *ni* positions Dzogchen (*rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po*) as the *'bras bu dam pa* (supreme result) and *bla na med pa'i theg pa* (unsurpassable vehicle).
