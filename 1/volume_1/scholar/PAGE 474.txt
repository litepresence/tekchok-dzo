[00001-00034] [STRUCTURE] Distinctive Differentiations: The Second Set of Sixteen

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage introduces a second set of sixteen distinctive differentiations (bye brag tu dbye ba), moving from simile-based to meaning-based (don nges pa) distinctions. The organization covers: (1) non-thought awareness vs. non-thought mind, (2) awareness not appearing to objects vs. mind self-abiding, (3) self-settled samādhi vs. channel-wind resting meditation, (4) awareness self-arisen appearing to objects vs. conceptual thought scattered, (5) dharmatā bardo vs. deity mayā-body, (6) natural nirmaṇakāya pure land vs. accomplished Buddha pure land. Each distinction clarifies rig pa/sems differences.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: mi rtog par 'dra yang (similar in being non-conceptual but...), zang thal (penetrating/porous), lhan ne gnas (abiding relaxed), 'khyil ba (coiled), rang gnas su 'dra yang (similar in self-abiding but...), yul can 'dzin pas bcings (bound by subject-object grasping), rang babs kyi bsam gtan (self-descending samādhi), rlan dang bcas pa (with moisture/continuity), rtsa rlung ngal so'i bsgom pa (channel-wind resting meditation), bying rgod (dullness and agitation), thal byung du shar nas 'dzin med du grol (spontaneously arising, liberated without grasping), gar shor ba (scattered like dance), chos nyid bar do (dharmatā bardo), yi dam lha'i sgyu lus (deity mayā-body), rang bzhin sprul sku'i zhing snang (natural nirmaṇakāya field-appearance), mas bgrod sangs rgyas nas dag pa'i zhing (purified field accomplished by Buddhas).

- **[CONTEXT]** The distinctions reflect standard rdzogs chen polemics against conflating awareness with mind, spontaneous meditation with fabricated practice, natural manifestation with cultivated visualization. The bardo (bar do) distinctions indicate the intermediate state between death and rebirth, crucial to Tibetan Buddhism. The pure land (zhing khams) distinctions reflect debates about "self-power" (ji rtsol) vs. "other-power" (gzhan rtsol) in soteriology.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents fine-grained phenomenological distinctions: awareness and mind may both be non-conceptual, but awareness is penetrating while mind is coiled; both may self-abide, but awareness has no object while mind is bound by subject-object; both may involve samādhi, but awareness has natural continuity while channel-wind requires effort; both may appear to objects, but awareness liberates spontaneously while thought scatters; both involve appearance, but dharmatā bardo is natural while deity-body is fabricated; both involve pure lands, but natural nirmaṇakāya is self-arisen while Buddha-fields are accomplished. These distinctions serve to prevent "false friends" (nor ra)—practices that appear similar but lead to different results.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants noted.
