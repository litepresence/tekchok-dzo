[STRUCTURE] Twelve Similes: The Pedagogy of Recognition
This page presents similes 7-12 of a twelvefold series, completing the systematic illustration of Dzogchen's key distinctions. The structure follows pairs: (7) delusion-appearance vs. ground-appearance, (8) realization vs. non-realization, (9) wisdom vs. latencies, (10) awareness entering wisdom-appearance, (11) wisdom and light, (12) strike-drink and intoxication. The progression moves from ontological distinctions (types of appearance) through epistemological distinctions (recognition) through dynamic distinctions (wisdom's function) to intimate non-dual recognition (mother/child, gold/color, strike/enjoyment). The similes function as both pedagogical tools and phenomenological maps—guiding recognition while describing the natural state.

[PHILOLOGY] Simile Terminology and Comparative Grammar
Critical comparative terms: 'dra (like/similar), lta bu (like/as), tshul (manner/mode), dpe (example/simile). Simile 7: mun pa dang snang ba'i tshul (manner of darkness and light), dag pa dang ma dag pa'i khyad (difference of pure/impure). Simile 8: ba mo dang reg pa'i tshul (manner of cow and touch), rkyen dang phrad (meeting condition), ma phrad (not meeting). Simile 9: sbur ma dang me'i tshul (tinder and fire), spang gnyen (antidote and remedy). Simile 10: ma'i pang du bu 'jug pa (child entering mother's lap), yid ches pa (confidence/trust). Simile 11: gser dang ser po (gold and yellow), ming dang kha dog mi phyed pa (name and color inseparable). Simile 12: gdab bya'i gdams ngag (instructions for striking), chang (beer), ra ro ba (intoxication/enjoyment). The particle ཀྱང་ (even/although) introduces contrast: gnyis rig pa'i ngang du gcig kyang (although one in awareness-mode, yet...).

[CONTEXT] Citations from Rang shar on Similes
The page cites Rang shar (Self-Arisen) tantra repeatedly: "'khrul pa dang grol ba'i dpe gnyid log pa dang sad pa'i tshul te dbang po'i khyad yod pa'i phyir"—delusion and liberation: simile of sleeping and waking, because there's difference in faculties. "'khrul pa'i snang ba dang bar do'i dpe ni mun pa dang snang ba'i tshul te dag pa dang ma dag pa'i khyad yod pa'i phyir"—delusion-appearance and bardo: simile of darkness and light, because there's difference of pure/impure. "rtogs pa dang ma rtogs pa'i dpe ni ba mo dang reg pa'i tshul te snang ba zil gyis gnon pa dang mi gnon pa'i khyad par yod pa'i phyir"—realization and non-realization: simile of cow and touch, because there's difference of overwhelming appearance or not. These establish the scriptural authority for using everyday analogies to illustrate profound distinctions.

[CONCEPT] The Phenomenology of Appearance Types
Simile 7 distinguishes two types of appearance in awareness-mode: rang gdangs (self-resonance/self-radiance) like day—clear, natural, manifest; log gdangs (inverted-resonance) like night—unclear, distorted, hidden. Both appear equally in rig pa'i ngang (awareness-mode), suggesting that the ground (gzhi) shows two faces: pure manifestation (sangs rgyas) and impure manifestation ('khrul pa). This is not two different grounds but two modes of appearance—like the same landscape seen in daylight vs. darkness. The difference is not in what is seen but in how it appears. Simile 8 uses ba mo (cow or breast) and reg pa (touching): like a blind person touching a cow—when the sun-condition (recognition) meets, there is purification (sangs); when not met, non-realization. This emphasizes that realization requires condition-meeting (rkyen phrad), though the nature is always present.

[STRUCTURE] The Logic of Simile Pairs
Each simile pair follows a pattern: two phenomena are one in essence (rig pa, ground, awareness-potency) but different in appearance or function. Simile 9: shes rab and bag chags (latencies) are both in rig pa'i rtsal (awareness-potency), but differ in spang gnyen (antidote-rejection)—like tinder and fire, wisdom burns afflictions while latencies fuel them. Simile 10: rig pa entering ye shes kyi snang ba (wisdom-appearance) is like child entering mother's lap—natural, trust-worthy, already intimate. This encodes the self-secret: just as the child is always in the mother's presence, awareness is never separate from wisdom; the "entry" is recognition of what was always the case. Simile 11: ye shes and 'od (wisdom and light) are distinguished only by gzhi las shar tsam gyi ldog pa (mere arising-from-ground reversal)—like gold and its color, distinct yet inseparable. This addresses identity-in-difference: essence and manifestation are neither same nor different.

[PHILOLOGY] Dynamic and Intimate Terminology
Simile 10: ma'i pang du bu 'jug pa (child entering mother's lap)—པང་ (lap/bosom) suggests intimacy, protection, natural belonging; འཇུག་པ་ (entering) suggests active recognition of always-already present state. Simile 11: gser dang ser po (gold and yellow)—གསེར་ is the substance, སེར་པོ་ is its quality; mi phyed pa (inseparable) negates both identity and difference. Simile 12: gdab bya (to be struck/actualized), gdams ngag (oral instruction), chang (beer/fermented beverage), ra ro ba (intoxication/enjoyment). The metaphor of practice as intoxication suggests: (1) transcending ordinary consciousness, (2) spontaneous enjoyment without effort, (3) warmth and bliss, (4) losing rigid boundaries. The incomplete state of simile 12 suggests the open-ended nature of practice—similes point beyond themselves to direct experience.

[CONCEPT] Wisdom as Antidote and Fire
Simile 9 establishes shes rab (prajñā/wisdom) as the spang gnyen (antidote and remedy) for bag chags (latencies/vāsanā). Both are rig pa'i rtsal (awareness-potency)—both arise from the same ground—but they function differently: wisdom burns nyon mongs (afflictions) while latencies perpetuate them. The sbur ma (tinder/firefly) and me (fire) simile is precise: tinder contains fire-potential but doesn't burn until ignited; wisdom-potential exists but must be recognized to function as antidote. This addresses the question: if awareness is naturally pure, why do latencies persist? Answer: they persist until recognition-meeting (like sun meeting cow-touch), then they are consumed like fuel in fire. The "burning" is not destruction of something real but recognition of its empty nature—latencies were never other than wisdom's play.

[STRUCTURE] The Pedagogical Completion
Similes 7-9 distinguish types of appearance, recognition, and wisdom's function—establishing the analytical framework. Similes 10-12 move toward intimate, non-dual recognition of the natural state—transitioning from analysis to direct experience. The mother/child simile (10) is pedagogically crucial because it bypasses the seeker's anxiety: enlightenment is not far, not difficult, not requiring exotic practices—it is the most natural, intimate thing, like returning to mother's presence. The gold/yellow simile (11) addresses philosophical subtlety: how can form and emptiness be neither same nor different? Like gold and color—they are not identical (gold has weight, color doesn't), not different (no gold without color, no color without gold). The strike-drink simile (12) introduces the pragmatic, non-conceptual dimension: actualization as intoxication, as enjoyment, as losing oneself in the natural state.

[CONCEPT] The Open Secret of Simile 12
The incomplete simile 12—breaking off at gdab bya'i gdams ngag chang dang (instructions for striking, beer...)—is thematically significant. Unlike the other similes that conclude neatly, this one remains open, suggesting: (1) the practice it describes (thod rgal) cannot be fully captured in words, (2) the "intoxication" is ongoing, not a final state, (3) the teacher-student transmission (gdams ngag) is oral and direct, not textual. The metaphor of beer/ra ro ba (intoxication/enjoyment) connects to Tibetan tantric culture where sacred substances (chang, meat) are transmuted into wisdom-vehicles. Here, the "intoxication" is recognition itself—drunk on the natural state, one loses the rigid self that was seeking. The simile points beyond pedagogy to direct transmission—what cannot be said must be shown, what cannot be shown must be tasted.
