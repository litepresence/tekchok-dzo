[2831-2866] [STRUCTURE] Two Truths Framework
**Analysis:**

**General Path Introduction:**

Longchenpa introduces the two truths (*bden pa gnyis*) as the basis for all Mahayana practice.

**From Root Wisdom (*rtsa ba'i shes rab*):**

All phenomena gathered by samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.

**From Uttaratantra Commentary:**

```
All paths of truth are compounded.
All compounds are merely conventional.
That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—
The essence of emptiness, along with the subsequent measuring wisdom,
The peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.
```

**Two-fold Ultimate Division:**

1. **Nominal Ultimate** (*rnam grangs pa'i don dam*):
   - Through reasoning that examines and dissects (*dpyod byed kyi rigs pas dpyad cing dbye ba na*)
   - When nothing is established as dharma-nature (*chos nyid du ma grub pa na*)
   - Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling arises in accord with its nature

2. **Verbal Ultimate** (*sgra ji bzhin pa'i don dam*)

**From Two Truths:**

The relationship between reasoning and realization established.

**Five Paths of the Bodhisattva:**

1. **Accumulation** (*tshogs lam*)
2. **Application** (*sbyor lam*)
3. **Seeing** (*mthong lam*)
4. **Meditation** (*sgom lam*)
5. **No More Learning** (*mi slob lam*)

**Ten Grounds (*sa bcu*):**

1. Great Joy (*rab tu dga' ba*)
2. Stainless (*dri ma med pa*)
3. Luminous (*'od byed pa*)
4. Radiant ('*od 'phro ba*)
5. Difficult to Overcome (*sbyang dka' ba*)
6. Manifest (*mngon du gyur pa*)
7. Gone Afar (*ring du song ba*)
8. Immovable (*mi g.yo ba*)
9. Excellent Wisdom (*legs pa'i blo gros*)
10. Cloud of Dharma (*chos kyi sprin*)

**From Entrance (*'jug pa*):**

```
The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
```

**Fruit of Complete Perfection:**

Upon the ground of all-illumination (*kun tu 'od*):
- Self-purpose: dharma-body (*chos sku*)
- Benefit others: two supreme form-bodies (*gzugs sku*)
- Beholding all with two wisdoms (*shes gnyis*)
- Working for beings until samsara emptied

**Heat Stages (*drod gsum*):**

Through three aspects:
1. Outer heat (*phyi'i drod*)
2. Inner heat (*nang gi drod*)
3. Both together (*gnyis ka*)

**Outer Heat:**
- Second ground: stainless
- Entities appear as empty
- Practice of concentration
- Arises in two pure grounds

**Inner Heat:**
- Sixth ground: manifest
- Understanding pure knowable as empty

**Heat of Both:**
- Seventh ground: arises from pure
- Eighth: patience attained
- Ninth: peak reached
- Tenth: supreme dharma of world

Thus the ten grounds are obtained.
