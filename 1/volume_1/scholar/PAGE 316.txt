[13167-13190] [CONTEXT] Progress Assessment Framework
The progression signs provide a framework for assessing development on the path. This reflects the practical concern with verifying practice effectiveness. However, the text warns against attachment to signs, which can become obstacles. The framework balances encouragement with non-attachment.

[13145-13190] [CONCEPT] Signs as Natural Results
The text conceptualizes progression signs as natural results of practice, not goals to be achieved. The decrease of afflictions and increase of compassion indicate that recognition is transforming experience. The three experiences (bliss, clarity, non-conceptuality) are temporary byproducts, not the ultimate result. Continuous recognition is the only reliable sign.
