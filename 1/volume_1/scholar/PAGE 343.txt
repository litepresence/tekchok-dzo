## TIBETAN SECTION: Five Types of Women and Their Channels (rigs can lnga'i rtsa)

[14035-14037] [STRUCTURE] Classification of Glang sna ma (Elephant-Nosed Type)
**Analysis:** First of five female physiological types (rigs can lnga) in subtle body taxonomy. Features: mig zlum (round eyes), yan lag phra (slender limbs). Corresponding channel (rtsa): shaped like elephant trunk (glang po'i sna), ascending vertically from navel (lte ba). Functional consequence: impedes direct descent of byang sems (bodhicitta drops). Connects to Ayurverdic/humoral physiognomy traditions.

[14038-14040] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of Desire-Channel Relationship
**Analysis:** 'Dod chags shas chung (diminished passion) linked to rtsa byer pa (split/burst channels). Particle las byung ngo indicates causal origin. Key term: rtsa rkyang ba (stiff/straight channels) - describes channel morphology affecting energetic flow. Man ngag gtso che (essential oral instruction) signals esoteric transmission lineage.

[14041-14046] [STRUCTURE] Pad+ma can (Lotus-Having Type)
**Analysis:** Second type characterized by: mdog nag (dark complexion), yan lag rags (coarse limbs), gdong rtsub (rough face), bzhin mi sdug (unattractive features). Corresponding channel: pad+ma kha bye ba (lotus-blossom shaped). Functional characteristics: rtsa kha zlum (round channel mouth) prevents bodhicitta descent; de nyid ring bas bde ba che (elongated structure enhances bliss). Therapeutic focus: rtsa kha 'byed pa (opening channel mouth).

[14047-14055] [STRUCTURE] Ri mo can (Line-Marked Type)
**Analysis:** Third type with: mdog sngo bsangs (clear blue complexion), so thags dam (firm teeth), mig dang byad dkyus ring (elongated eyes and facial proportions), skra ser (blond hair), yan lag phra (slender limbs), ltem (compressed), spyod lam dal (slow gait). Corresponding channel: ri mo bris pa lta bu (like drawn lines), gar dga' dga' (dancing/joyful movement pattern). Features rtsa spra yas pa (numerous channel branches). Therapeutic focus: rtsa sdud pa (gathering/contracting channels).

[14056-14065] [STRUCTURE] Dung can ma (Conch-Having Type)
**Analysis:** Fourth type: kha dog ser (yellow complexion), bongs chung (small stature), so srab (thin teeth), smin mtshams gsal (clear between eyebrows), yan lag thung (short limbs), sor mo yangs (wide fingers). Corresponding channel: dung g.yas su 'khyil ba (coiling to the right like conch). Functional: impedes bodhicitta descent; 'khyil bas 'dod pa'i ro mi rnyed (coiling prevents tasting desire's essence). Therapeutic: rtsa gseng ba (clearing/opening channels).

[14066-14077] [CONCEPT] Origins of Disease from Five Poisons
**Analysis:** Comprehensive etiology linking five poisons (dug lnga) to channel pathology: rigs can lnga'i rtsa produce g.yo sgyu (deception/manipulation) in 32 variations, generating 32 disease types. Extended enumeration: rtsa ye shes kyi rigs (wisdom channels) number 101. Additional pathologies: mngal za ba srin bu'i mdze (uterine parasites/leprosy) also have five types. Zla mtshan (menstrual/moon channels) produce 10 disease types: kun tu 'jug pa (universal entry), 'dzin pa (grasping), gnas pa (stabilization) - totaling 32 diseases unique to female physiology. Structural insight: bu snod (womb-container) creates conditions absent in male bodies.
