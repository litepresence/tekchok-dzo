[10724-10731] [STRUCTURE] Completion of Variegated Appearance Refutation

**Analysis:** Lines 10724-10731 complete the refutation of the variegated appearance position by examining all three alternatives. The structure systematically enumerates the consequences: (1) If appearance is internal cognition (gnyis pa ltar na), the ground becomes momentary like mind (skad cig ma), conceptual like thought (snyam byed), and afflicted like defilements (nyon mongs) (lines 10724-10726); (2) If appearance is aggregation (gsum pa ltar na), the ground becomes external-internal duality (phyi nang), subject-object duality (gzung 'dzin), and the six aggregates to be abandoned (tshogs drug spang bya) (lines 10727-10729); (3) Conclusion that the ground cannot be considered a single expanse (dbyings gcig) because it would be a multiplicity (mang po tshogs pa) (lines 10730-10731).

[10724-10731] [PHILOLOGY] Consequence Markers and Similes

**Analysis:** The passage employs the comparative particle bzhin (like/as) repeatedly to establish analogies between mind and ground. Lines 10724-10725 use shes pa skad cig ma bzhin (like momentary cognition) and rtogs pa du ma ltar (like multiple cognitions). The verb thal ba (becomes subject to consequence) appears three times (lines 10724, 10725, 10726) marking logical implications. The phrase rkyen dbang can (subject to conditions) at line 10726 indicates conditioned existence. Line 10728 uses gzung 'dzin (grasper-grasped) for subject-object duality. The phrase tshogs drug spang bya (six aggregates to be abandoned) at line 10729 refers to the skandhas as objects of renunciation. The ablative phyir ro (because) at line 10731 marks causal explanation.

[10724-10731] [CONTEXT] Buddhist Psychology and Ground Theory

**Analysis:** This passage engages with Buddhist psychological categories applied to ground theory. The analysis of mind (shes pa) as momentary (skad cig ma), conceptual (snyam byed), and conditioned (rkyen dbang can) reflects standard Abhidharma analysis. The six aggregates (tshogs drug) refer to the five skandhas plus either consciousness or another formulation. The subject-object duality (gzung 'dzin) reflects Yogacara analysis of cognition. Longchenpa's strategy is to demonstrate that identifying the ground with any of these psychological categories leads to unacceptable consequences, preparing for his presentation of ground as transcending all such categories while being their basis.

[10724-10731] [CONCEPT] Impossibility of Single Expanse as Multiplicity

**Analysis:** The refutation concludes that the ground cannot be considered a single expanse (dbyings gcig) if it is posited as a multiplicity (mang po tshogs pa). This conclusion addresses a fundamental tension in theories of ground: how can something be both one and many? The three alternatives examined—external, internal, and aggregated—all lead to the conclusion that if appearance is truly manifold, the ground cannot be a singular basis. This analysis demonstrates that theories of ground must avoid both the extreme of pure unity (which cannot account for variety) and pure multiplicity (which cannot account for the unity of ground). Longchenpa's own presentation will transcend this duality through the concept of inseparability.

[10732-10741] [STRUCTURE] Canonical Citation on Variegated Appearance

**Analysis:** Lines 10732-10741 present a citation from the Klong drug pa (Six Expanses) tantra addressing the problem of variegated appearance. The structure follows: introductory phrase marking faults (line 10732), source citation (line 10733), seven lines of verse (lines 10734-10740), and closing zhes so (line 10741). The verse emphasizes that the Buddha previously taught that appearance is variegated (khra bo), but this position is unsuitable because it contradicts partiality (phyogs dang mi 'thad). The verse argues that the essence (ngo bo) and its appearance are the same, and the result is not different from that meaning.

[10732-10741] [PHILOLOGY] Verse Structure and Philosophical Terms

**Analysis:** The verse employs seven-syllable meter with key philosophical terms. Line 10734 uses khra bor gsungs (taught as variegated/multicolored). The phrase phyogs dang mi 'thad (unsuitable/contradictory with partiality) at line 10735 marks the problem. Gang gi ngo bo (whose essence) at line 10736 uses the genitive to indicate possession. The phrase 'bras bu tha dad (result is different) at line 10737 uses tha dad (different/separate) to mark duality. The ablative phyir (because) appears twice (lines 10736, 10738). The phrase mang ba'i sgra yis (by the word/sound of manifold) at line 10738 indicates linguistic designation. The connective de bzhin no (it is like that) at line 10740 marks confirmation.

[10732-10741] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Authority for Refutation

**Analysis:** The citation from Klong drug pa provides scriptural authority for the refutation of the variegated appearance position. The verse demonstrates that even within the Dzogchen tantras themselves, there is recognition that certain formulations of appearance are problematic. The specific concern with phyogs (partiality/direction) reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on transcending all limited viewpoints. The verse's assertion that essence and appearance are non-different ('bras bu tha dad don de mtshungs—the result is equal to that meaning) anticipates Longchenpa's own presentation of inseparability. This citation strategy positions Longchenpa's commentary as faithful to the root tantras.

[10732-10741] [CONCEPT] Appearance as Non-Different from Essence

**Analysis:** The verse articulates a key Dzogchen concept: the non-difference between essence (ngo bo) and appearance (snang ba). This concept resolves the problem of variegated appearance by showing that: (1) Appearance is not something other than essence imposed upon it; (2) The result ('bras bu) is not different from the meaning (don) of essence; (3) The distinction between essence and appearance is merely conceptual, not substantial; (4) The "manifold" is a linguistic designation (sgra yis) that does not affect the unity of essence. This analysis prepares for Longchenpa's presentation of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as inseparable.

[10742-10744] [STRUCTURE] Presentation of Self-Arisen Wisdom Position

**Analysis:** Lines 10742-10744 present the seventh position ('dod pa): self-arisen awareness wisdom (rig pa rang byung gi ye shes) is free from the extremes of existence and non-existence (yod med kyi mtha' dang bral), therefore it is not established even as mere wisdom (ye shes tsam du'ang grub pa med). This position characterizes the ground as beyond all extremes from the perspective of the Great Perfection (rdzogs chen). The structure presents essence characterization (freedom from extremes) and concludes with the assertion of non-establishment from the perspective of the Great Bindu (thig le chen po).

[10742-10744] [PHILOLOGY] Wisdom Terminology and Freedom from Extremes

**Analysis:** The passage employs technical Dzogchen terminology: rig pa rang byung gi ye shes (self-arisen awareness wisdom), yod med kyi mtha' (extremes of existence and non-existence), bral ba (freedom/separation from), and thig le chen po (Great Bindu/Thigle). The phrase tsam du'ang (even merely) at line 10743 emphasizes the thoroughness of non-establishment. The term spros bral (freedom from elaborations/conceptual proliferation) marks the apophatic nature of this position. The phrase gang du'ang ma grub (not established anywhere whatsoever) at line 10744 indicates absolute non-establishment. These constructions present the most refined of the seven positions, closest to Longchenpa's own view.

[10742-10744] [CONTEXT] Apophatic Theology in Dzogchen

**Analysis:** This position represents the apophatic (negative) approach to describing the ground, characteristic of the highest Dzogchen teachings. The emphasis on freedom from extremes (mtha' bral) and freedom from elaborations (spros bral) parallels similar developments in Madhyamaka and Christian negative theology. The Great Bindu (thig le chen po) represents the supreme pinnacle of Dzogchen view, beyond all conceptual determination. This position attempts to avoid the errors of previous positions by refusing to characterize the ground positively, instead describing it through negation and transcendence.

[10742-10744] [CONCEPT] Self-Arisen Wisdom Beyond Extremes

**Analysis:** This position posits the ground as self-arisen wisdom (rang byung gi ye shes) that is: (1) Free from existence and non-existence (yod med kyi mtha' dang bral)—transcending the fundamental ontological categories; (2) Not established even as mere wisdom—avoiding reification of wisdom itself; (3) Beyond all conceptual elaborations (spros bral)—transcending all philosophical positions; (4) Non-established anywhere (gang du'ang ma grub)—lacking any determinate location or characteristic. This presentation approaches the authentic Dzogchen view but, as the subsequent refutation will show, still requires careful qualification to avoid nihilistic interpretation.

[10745-10754] [STRUCTURE] Refutation of Nihilistic Interpretation

**Analysis:** Lines 10745-10754 present the refutation of the self-arisen wisdom position, demonstrating that total non-establishment leads to nihilism. The structure follows: refutation marker (line 10745), argument that if nothing is established, this contradicts the ground being the source of samsara and nirvana (line 10746), argument that without wisdom there is no liberation (line 10747), argument that without subtle light there is no basis for manifestation (line 10748), and canonical citation confirming that cyclic existence is impossible if essence is primordially pure (lines 10749-10754).

[10745-10754] [PHILOLOGY] Nihilism Markers and Light Imagery

**Analysis:** The passage employs negation and consequence constructions. Line 10746 uses ci yang med (nothing whatsoever) with 'khor 'das 'byung ba'i dbyings su 'gal la (contradicts being the source of samsara and nirvana). The phrase rnam grol (complete liberation) at line 10747 refers to the liberation of Buddhas and sentient beings. Line 10748 uses phra ba'i 'od lnga (subtle five lights) referring to the elemental lights in Dzogchen cosmology. The verb 'char ba (arise/appear) indicates manifestation. Lines 10751-10753 use ye dag (primordially pure) and ye zad (primordially exhausted) to mark the nihilistic extreme. The phrase mi rigs (is not logical/does not make sense) appears multiple times indicating logical impossibility.

[10745-10754] [CONTEXT] Avoiding Nihilism in Dzogchen

**Analysis:** This refutation addresses the persistent charge that Dzogchen teachings lead to nihilism—the denial of all existence and value. Buddhist history includes numerous debates about whether emptiness (sunyata) teachings destroy the foundation of ethics and practice. The specific concern here is that if the ground is completely non-established (gang du'ang ma grub), this undermines: (1) The possibility of samsara and nirvana; (2) The reality of liberation; (3) The basis for manifestation. Longchenpa's response will demonstrate that non-establishment does not mean non-existence, but rather transcendence of conceptual determination.

[10745-10754] [CONCEPT] The Problem of Total Non-Establishment

**Analysis:** The refutation identifies multiple problems with asserting total non-establishment of the ground: (1) **Source Contradiction:** If nothing is established, the ground cannot serve as the source (dbyings) of samsara and nirvana (line 10746); (2) **Liberation Impossibility:** Without wisdom (ye shes), there can be no liberation for Buddhas or sentient beings (line 10747); (3) **Manifestation Impossibility:** Without the subtle five lights ('od lnga), there is no basis for ground-appearance to arise (line 10748); (4) **Cyclic Existence Problem:** If essence is primordially pure (ye dag), cyclic existence should not occur (line 10751-10752). These arguments demonstrate that mere negation, without positive qualification, leads to unacceptable consequences.

[10755-10757] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Positive Presentation

**Analysis:** Lines 10755-10757 mark the transition from refutation to positive presentation of Longchenpa's own view. The structure introduces the third major section (gsum pa): establishing the ground of inseparable primordial purity and spontaneous presence (ka dag lhun grub dbyer med kyi gzhi) in the text's own system (rang gzhung du 'god pa). This section is divided into two parts: the actual meaning (don dngos) and abandoning disputes about it (de la rtsod pa spang ba). The passage begins the first part, presenting the essence of primordially pure awareness in which spontaneous presence exists clearly in depth (gtig gsal du yod).

[10755-10757] [PHILOLOGY] Transition Markers and Technical Terms

**Analysis:** The passage employs transition vocabulary: gsum pa (third) marks the new section, rang gzhung (own system/text) indicates Longchenpa's own position, and 'god pa (establish/posit) marks positive presentation. The phrase don dngos (actual meaning) contrasts with rtsod pa spang ba (abandoning disputes). Line 10757 uses ka dag (primordial purity) with lhun grub (spontaneous presence) joined by dbyer med (inseparable). The phrase gting gsal du yod (exists clearly in depth) indicates the presence of spontaneous presence within primordial purity. The phrase dngos po dang mtshan mar ma grub (not established as thing or sign) uses negation to mark transcendence of reification.

[10755-10757] [CONTEXT] Synthesis of Previous Refutations

**Analysis:** This transition marks the synthesis of the previous seven refutations into Longchenpa's positive presentation. Having demonstrated the inadequacy of: (1) Spontaneous presence as basis; (2) Indeterminate ground; (3) Unchanging ground like space; (4) Transformable ground; (5) Ground with universal assertion; (6) Ground with variegated appearance; (7) Totally non-established ground—Longchenpa now presents his own view. This dialectical method reflects the Madhyamaka approach of refuting all extremes before presenting the Middle Way. Longchenpa's innovation is applying this method specifically to Dzogchen ground theory.

[10755-10757] [CONCEPT] Inseparability of Primordial Purity and Spontaneous Presence

**Analysis:** Longchenpa's positive presentation introduces the concept of inseparability (dbyer med) between primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub). This concept resolves the problems identified in previous positions by showing that: (1) **Not Separate:** Spontaneous presence is not different from primordial purity but exists within it (gtig gsal du yod); (2) **Not Identical:** The awareness of primordial purity is not established as thing or sign (dngos po dang mtshan mar ma grub), avoiding reification; (3) **Non-Dual:** The two aspects are inseparable, transcending the duality of existence and non-existence; (4) **Dynamic:** While primordially pure, the ground is capable of spontaneous manifestation. This formulation will be elaborated in the following pages as Longchenpa develops his definitive view of the ground.
