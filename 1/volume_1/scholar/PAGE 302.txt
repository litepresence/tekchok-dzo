[12501-12546] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom Beyond Intellect
The text presents wisdom as transcending intellectual understanding. The structure establishes: (1) wisdom not accessible to conceptual thought, (2) the limitation of philosophical analysis, (3) wisdom known through direct experience, and (4) the necessity of pointing-out instructions (ngo sprod).

[12501-12522] [PHILOLOGY] Beyond-Intellect Terminology
The term blo (intellect, mind) appears as what wisdom transcends: blo 'das (beyond intellect). The phrase "rtog pa'i yul min" (not an object of conceptual thought) denies conceptual accessibility. The term nyams myong (direct experience) provides the alternative. The compound ngo sprod (pointing out) identifies the method.

[12523-12546] [CONTEXT] Limits of Philosophical Knowledge
The wisdom-beyond-intellect presentation acknowledges the limits of philosophical knowledge. While the text itself employs sophisticated philosophy, it ultimately points beyond philosophy to direct recognition. This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on experiential knowledge (nyams myong) over theoretical understanding (go rtogs).

[12501-12546] [CONCEPT] Wisdom as Trans-Conceptual Knowing
The text conceptualizes wisdom as trans-conceptual knowing—knowing that operates prior to and beyond conceptual thought. Concepts can point to wisdom but cannot capture it. Wisdom is like taste—cannot be conveyed through description but must be directly experienced. The pointing-out instruction (ngo sprod) is the method for shifting from conceptual to direct knowing.
