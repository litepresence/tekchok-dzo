[398-405] [CONTEXT] # The Three Supports During Speech and Mind Teaching Periods
**Analysis:** The text details the locations of the three supports during different phases:

**Speech Teaching Period:**
- **Vajra** at Mount Malaya (*ri ma la ya*), specifically at the "hand-vajra abode" (*phyag rdo rje'i gnas*), where yakṣa kings (*gnod sbyin gyi rgyal po*) render homage
- **Letter** in the sky above Vajra-seat (*rdo rje gdan*), held by ḍākinīs
- **Body** not fixed to one location, circumambulating Jambudvīpa, creating special offering-fields for divine and human assemblies

The protective function is described: when teaching is threatened (*bsTan pa la gnod pa byung*), the body emanates light, the face emits HŪṂ, and the eyes produce fire—the threefold protective mechanism of tantric Buddhism representing light (wisdom), sound (mantra), and fire (transformative power).

[406-409] [STRUCTURE] # The Three Supports During Mind Teaching Period
**Analysis:** During the mind-taming teaching period:
- **Vajra** abides in Vajra-seat's sky (*rdo rje gdan gyi nam mkha'*)
- **Letter** in the "extremely wrathful sage's cave" (*rab tu khros pa drang srong gi phug*)—a reference to Vajrapāṇi's wrathful manifestation
- **Body** in the thirty-three gods' measureless palace (*sum cu rtsa gsum gyi lha rnams kyi gzhal med khang*), specifically in the upper story (*yang thog*) of the hand-vajra house (*lag na rdo rje'i khang pa*)

[410] [PHILOLOGY] The Superlative *ches 'phags*
**Analysis:** The phrase *'dzam bu'i gling gzhon las ches 'phags* (Jambudvīpa surpasses others) uses the superlative *ches* (most/very) with the verb *'phags* (to be superior/excel). This establishes the preeminence of our world system due to the presence of these three emanations, a standard trope in Buddhist cosmology where Jambudvīpa is considered optimal for spiritual practice.

[411-413] [STRUCTURE] # The Twelve Emanations Framework
**Analysis:** Longchenpa introduces the systematic presentation of twelve emanation-bodies (*sprul sku bcu gnyis*) appearing in twelve abode-types (*gnas ris bcu gnyis*). The purpose (*cir*) is specified: to purify beings' five aggregates (*phung po lnga dag par bya ba*). This establishes the soteriological function of the emanation doctrine—manifestation serves purification.

The phrase *phun sum tshogs pa lnga'i rang bzhin lan bcu gnyis su snang bar mdzad pa* indicates that the self-nature (*rang bzhin*) of the five perfections appears twelve times, suggesting a systematic multiplication of the basic pedagogical structure.

[414-423] [CONTEXT] # First Emanation: Tuṣita Heaven
**Analysis:** The first emanation is situated in:
- **Field:** Tuṣita (*dga' ldan*) — the "contented" heaven where future Buddhas abide before final birth
- **Abode:** Lotus center (*padma'i lte ba*) of the upper chamber
- **Teacher:** Supreme Light Unimaginable (*snang ba dam pa bsam gyis mi khyab pa*)
- **Retinue:** Thousand light-appearance Buddhas plus two roots (*rtsa gnyis*), representing the thousand Buddhas of the Fortunate Eon plus two bodhisattvas who complete the entourage

The teaching is identified as *sGra thal 'gyur gyi rgyud* (Sound Thalgyur Tantra), the root of all teachings, taught during Amitāyus's life-span by compilers (*sdud pa po*) Nandīśvara (*dga' byed dbang phyug*) and Sun Greatly-Illuminating (*nyi ma rab tu snang byed*).

[424-425] [CONTEXT] # Second Emanation: Sahā World
**Analysis:** The second emanation appears in the Sahā world (*'jig rten mi mjed*)—our "endurable" world of suffering. The teacher is identified as Light Akṣobhya (*'od mi 'khrugs pa*), born from a "five-light egg" (*'od lnga'i sgo nga*). This connects to the standard narrative of Akṣobhya Buddha in the eastern direction, emphasizing the luminous nature of the emanation.
