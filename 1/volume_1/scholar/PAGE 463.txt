[00001-00060] [CONTEXT] The Sphere Lamp and Expanse Lamp: Advanced Phenomenology

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This section completes the exposition of the four lamps, focusing on the thig le (sphere) and dbyings (expanse) lamps. The organization includes: (1) ripening dynamics (smin byed), (2) sphere lamp characteristics with chromatic and somatic correlates, (3) expanse lamp characteristics with spatial metaphors, (4) citations from the *Sgron ma 'bar ba* (Blazing Lamp) and *Nor bu 'phra bkod* (Jewel Pinnacle Array) tantras. The passage concludes with the integration of all four lamps as the vajra fortress (rdo rje'i rdzong).

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Chromatic terminology: zlum khrigs dmar gsal (roundly arranged, red and clear), mthing ga (dark blue/nīla), 'od lnga (five lights), mu khyud (encircling wall/periphery). Somatic terms: mig zur gnyis (two eye-corners), smin mtshams (navel/maṇipūra), snying ga (heart). The term "rdo rje'i rdzong" (vajra fortress) indicates the impenetrable nature of realization. "Zung 'jug" (union) refers to yuganaddha, the non-dual union of method and wisdom.

- **[CONTEXT]** Citations from the *Sgron ma 'bar ba* and *Nor bu 'phra bkod* (key texts of the Nyingtik tradition) establish canonical authority. The five lights ('od lnga) correspond to the five Buddha families and five pristine cognitions. The somatic localization (navel for expanse, heart for sphere) reflects tantric cakra physiology. The "vajra fortress" metaphor appears frequently in Atiyoga literature, indicating the impossibility of regression once the nature of mind is recognized.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents advanced phenomenological analysis wherein the sphere lamp manifests as luminous bindus (thig le) with specific chromatic characteristics (red, clear), serving as the support for pristine cognition. The expanse lamp manifests as dark blue radiance pervading space, indicating the dharmadhātu. The integration of these lamps produces "self-arisen pristine cognition" (rang byung ye shes) and "spontaneously present light-body" (lhun grub 'od kyi sku). The passage emphasizes that whoever perceives this—regardless of formal Buddhist practice—achieves liberation, reflecting the rdzogs chen doctrine of universal accessibility of awakening.

- **[VARIANT]** No manuscript variants noted.
