[5627-5662] [STRUCTURE] Preamble Framework
**Analysis:** Lines 5627-5662 introduce the structural framework for preamble (*gleng gzhi*) analysis:

**Two Divisions [5627-5629]:**
1. General presentation (*spyir bstan pa*)
2. Particular explanation (*bye brag tu bshad pa*)

**Two-fold Binding Intent [5630-5634]:**
Secret unsurpassed tantras' meanings are bound by two intents (*dgongs pa rnam pa gnyis kyis bcings*):
- For those with self-appearing awareness mind (*rig pa rang snang gi blo can*): tantra title-meaning distinctions
- For those with conceptual object mind (*dmigs pa yul gyi blo can*): tantra text definiteness

**Citation from *Thal 'gyur* [5635-5656]:**
The text extensively quotes from *Thal 'gyur* (*Thal ba 'gyur ba*), a major Nyingma tantra:

**Key Verses:**
- "How amazing, tantra definite arising"
- "Two intents exist"
- "For self-appearing mind, tantra title-meaning distinctions"
- "For conceptual mind, tantra text-meaning distinctions"

**Four-fold Presentation [5657-5662]:**
For liberating beings of different intellects:
1. For proliferating mind (*blo spros pa dang bcas pa*) — outer preamble five perfections
2. For non-proliferating mind (*blo spros pa med pa*) — inner text meaning upadesha
3. For extremely non-proliferating mind (*blo shin tu spros pa med pa*) — secret title self-text realization
4. For completely non-proliferating mind (*blo rab tu spros pa med pa*) — supreme secret Dzogchen condensed meaning

**Structural Note:**
This four-fold schema reflects the Nyingma hermeneutical principle of graded teachings according to capacity.

[5663-5710] [STRUCTURE] Four-fold Definiteness System
**Analysis:** Lines 5663-5710 present the four-fold system for establishing Secret Mantra's definitive meaning:

**Four Aspects [5663-5708]:**
1. Tantra body condensed preambles (*rgyud kyi lus dril ba gleng gzhi*) — as preambles spread from body, explaining two preambles' meaning
2. Eleven word-meanings (*tshig gi don bcu gcig*) — condensing them into eleven, establishing upadesha word-meanings
3. Two practice approaches (*nyams len gyi 'gag gnyis*) — eleven gathering into trekcho and thogal, bound as two practice approaches
4. All gathering into one rigpa meaning (*rig pa gcig pu'i don*) — all directly appearing dharmas applied to one rigpa meaning, condensed into one

**Result [5708-5710]:**
These four aspects establish Secret Mantra's definitive meaning, called "root vajra four bindings" (*rtsa ba rdo rje'i chings bzhi*) — supreme intention of great pandita Vimalamitra (*dri med bshes gnyen*).

**Three Particular Explanations [5711-5715]:**
1. Connection arrangement of two preambles (*gleng gzhi gnyis kyi 'brel 'god*)
2. Extensive explanation of individual meanings (*so so'i don rgyas par bshad*)
3. Abandoning wrong misconceptions (*phyin ci log gi rtsod pa spang ba*)

**First: Preamble Connection [5716-5744]:**
Tantra meaning condensed:
- Title shown (*mtshan bstan pa*)
- Text (*gzhung*) — body division (*lus rnam par gzhag pa*) and branches extensive explanation (*yan lag rgyas par bshad pa*)
- Body extensive explanation briefly shown for gathering

Citation from *Thal 'gyur* [5724-5731]: Word expression clear sequence, title shown and text, gradually and instantaneously by minds, for realization purpose explained, text considered as two, body division and branches divided by meaning.
