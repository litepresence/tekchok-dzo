[00001-00033] [STRUCTURE] Elaboration of False Friends: Completion of the Typology

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage completes the enumeration of "false friends" (nor ra) from the *Kun tu bzang po klong drug pa* citation and adds Longchenpa's commentary on their importance. The organization continues the twenty-one comparisons: (12) liberation ground (ka dag) vs. practice-time expanse, (13) awareness unceasing variety vs. mental events, (14) wisdom power vs. mind memory, (15) pinnacle teaching vs. lower teachings, (16) direct perception vs. intellectual view, (17) awareness body vs. fabricated form, (18) awareness conduct vs. deluded conduct, (19) naturally pure sphere vs. wind-mind sphere, (20) pure dharmakāya field vs. nirvāṇa city, (21) self-awareness free from thought vs. mental feelings. The passage concludes with the warning about secrecy.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: re zhig gong 'phel du (gradually expanding upward), dkyil 'khor (maṇḍala), rtsa rlung gi rtags bcu (ten signs of channel-wind), rnam dag gi rlung gi rtsol ba (pure wind effort), cha'i 'grib pa (diminution of portion), gnas cha'i brlan (dwelling moisture/continuity), lam 'bras (path and result), sbyor drug (six applications/yogas), gsang 'dus (Guhyasamāja), phra tig (subtle bindu), snying tig (heart essence/Nyingtik), gser dang ra gan gyi khyad (difference of gold and copper), sngags kyi rtse mo (pinnacle of mantra).

- **[CONTEXT]** The comparison of Nyingtik (snying tig) direct perception with generation-stage visualizations reflects the standard Nyingma hierarchical taxonomy: Nyingtik is "gold" while lower tantras are "copper"—similar in appearance but different in value. The "six applications" (sbyor drug) refers to the six yogas of Nāropa or similar completion-stage practices. The *Nor bu 'phra bkod* citation establishes that all essential points of the secret mantra essence reside in these four palaces.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents the culmination of the "false friend" typology: liberation ground vs. practice-expanse differs in complete purity; awareness-variety vs. mental-events differs in non-wandering; wisdom-power vs. mind-memory differs in non-scattering; pinnacle vs. lower teachings differs in immediate perception; direct perception vs. intellection differs in immediacy; awareness-body vs. fabricated-form differs in spontaneity; awareness-conduct vs. deluded-conduct differs in recognition; natural sphere vs. wind-mind sphere differs in purity; dharmakāya-field vs. nirvāṇa-city differs in being a field vs. a destination; self-awareness vs. mental-feelings differs in being free from thought. The crucial point: these distinctions are supremely important (gal che) because they prevent practitioners from mistaking inferior practices for the authentic path.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants attested.
