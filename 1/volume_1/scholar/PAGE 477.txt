[20329-20343] [CONCEPT] Continuation of Eleventh Distinction and Introduction of Twelfth

**Analysis:**
- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology (continued from previous page): *dang* (and), *re zhig gong 'phel du* (gradually expanding upward), *dkyil 'khor* (mandala), *rtsa rlung* (channel-wind), *rtsa rlung gi rtags bcu* (ten signs of channel-wind), *rnam dag gi rlung gi rtsol ba* (pure wind effort), *cha'i 'grib pa* (diminution of portion/part), *gnas cha'i brlan* (dwelling part's moisture/continuity), *'phel 'grib* (development-decrease/fluctuation), *mi brtan pa* (not stable).

- **[CONCEPT]** Completion of eleventh distinction: The wind-mind held sphere requires wind-holding (*rlung bzung ba*) without depending on it, depends on ten channel-wind signs (*rtags bcu*), involves effort (*rtsol ba*), experiences fluctuation and instability, diminished clarity and partial decrease, and produces coarse afflictions and thoughts later. These distinctions are very great (*khyad shin tu che*). The contrast establishes Dzogchen's effort-free natural clarity (*rang dangs*) vs. tantric wind-manipulation.

- **[CONTEXT]** The *lam 'bras* (path-result) and *sbyor drug* (six applications/yogas) and *gsang 'dus* (Guhyasamaja) subtle bindu meditations appear during practice, but the distinction between Heart Essence (*snying tig*) direct perception and these is like gold vs. counterfeit (*gser dang ra gan*).

[20343-20348] [CONCEPT] Twelfth Distinction: Liberation Ground Expanse vs. Practice-Time Expanse

**Analysis:**
- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *grol sa'i dbyings ka dag* (liberation ground's expanse original purity), *nyams su len dus* (practice time), *phyi nang gi dbyings ka dag* (outer inner expanse original purity), *rig pa rgya chad med pa* (awareness without gap/interruption), *yul snang dag* (objects appearing pure), *rlung sems dag pa* (wind-mind pure), *'khor 'das ka dag* (samsara-nirvana pure), *rkyen dbang res 'ga'* (occasional condition-power), *dri ma dang bcas pa* (with stain).

- **[CONCEPT]** Twelfth distinction: Both the liberation ground expanse (ka dag) and practice-time outer/inner expanse involve awareness without gap and merely pure object-appearances. The crucial difference: the liberation ground abides as pure samsara-nirvana through pure wind-mind, while present impure wind-mind experiences occasional condition-power and unclear stained states.

[20349-20354] [CONCEPT] Thirteenth Distinction: Awareness Variety vs. Mental Events Proliferation

**Analysis:**
- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *rig pa nang gsal* (awareness inner clear), *rjen la bud* (naked at), *sna tshogs snang ba* (various appearances), *rig pa mi 'gags* (awareness not ceasing), *sems byung* (mental events/mind-arising), *rtog tshogs* (thought groups), *snang sems 'char ba* (appearance-mind arising), *rkyen dbang du mi 'gro* (not go under condition-power), *ngang dangs* (state clear), *thal byung du shar* (spontaneously arisen), *dus mnyam* (time simultaneous), *ris med* (without border/mark), *byung tshor rtog pa* (arising feeling thought), *yul la yengs* (distracted toward objects), *tha mal rang ka* (ordinary self-only).

- **[CONCEPT]** Thirteenth distinction: Both awareness inner-clear variety and mental events proliferation appear as mind-arising. The crucial difference: awareness does not go under condition-power, does not separate from clarity, abides spontaneously arisen and liberated simultaneously without borders, while mental feelings and thoughts wander toward objects with ordinary self-clinging.

[20355-20360] [CONCEPT] Fourteenth and Fifteenth Distinctions: Wisdom Power vs. Thought Scattering, Pinnacle vs. Lower Teachings

**Analysis:**
- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *shes rab rtsal* (wisdom potency/power), *rnam rtog yul la 'phro ba* (conceptual thought spreading toward objects), *zang nge* (clearly), *thal le thad kar* (directly straight), *phyir 'khor rgyu med* (no outward returning circling), *phyir yul 'dzin* (outward grasping objects), *tshur log* (returning inward), *gzung 'dzin* (grasping-holding), *sngags kyi rtse mo* (pinnacle of mantra), *thad drang du bstan pa* (directly shown), *don dam ma skyes pa* (ultimate not-born), *dgongs gzhi re la ltos nas* (depending on individual intended ground), *stong gsal spros bral* (empty clear free from elaboration), *rang byung ye shes* (self-arisen primordial wisdom), *gnad la phab pa* (placed at essential point), *don khong nas 'char ba* (meaning arising from within), *mun rdo* (dark stone), *stong sgom* (emptiness meditation), *'od gsal snying po lnga ldan* (light clear fivefold essence).

- **[CONCEPT]** 
  - **Fourteenth distinction:** Wisdom power perfected vs. thought memory outward-scattering. Both appear outwardly, but wisdom dissolves clearly and directly without outward circling, while thought grasps outward objects and returns inward continuing grasping-holding.
  - **Fifteenth distinction:** Pinnacle of mantra teaching vs. lower teachings. Both use terms like "ultimate not-born" and "empty clear elaboration-free self-arisen wisdom," but the pinnacle teaching places meaning at the essential point so it arises from within without depending on intellect, while lower teachings involve intellectual thought like "throwing stones in darkness."
