[18121-18160] [STRUCTURE] # Distinct Dharmas: Light Manifestations
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the final distinct dharmas related to light manifestations (*'od kyi snang ba*)—the culmination of the four lamps system.

**Five Lights (*'od lnga*):**
1. **Blue** (*sngon po*): Dharmadhatu wisdom, center, essence
2. **White** (*dkar po*): Mirror-like wisdom, east, clarity
3. **Yellow** (*ser po*): Equality wisdom, south, equality
4. **Red** (*dmar po*): Discriminating wisdom, west, discernment
5. **Green** (*ljang gu*): All-accomplishing wisdom, north, activity

[18161-18200] [CONCEPT] Light-Sphere Integration:
The lights integrate with the sphere lamp (*dbyings kyi sgron ma*):
- Blue: Central pervading, unchanging
- White: Clarity aspect, mirror-like
- Yellow: Equalizing, ground aspect
- Red: Discriminating, path aspect
- Green: Accomplishing, fruition aspect

**Progressive manifestation:**
1. Sky-blue pervading (*nam mkha' ltar khyab pa*)
2. Five lights arising (*'od lnga shar ba*)
3. Rainbow sphere ('ja' tshon dbyings)
4. Wisdom light (*ye shes kyi 'od*)
5. Self-luminous bindu (*rang gsal thig le*)

[18201-18240] [PHILOLOGY] Light terminology:
- *gsal ba* (luminous): Clear, knowing aspect
- *mdangs* (radiance): Effulgence, spreading
- *zer* (ray): Projected light, directional
- *thig le* (bindu): Spherical light, concentrated
- *snang ba* (appearance): Manifested light, phenomenal

[18241-18280] [CONTEXT] Citations from *mu tig phreng ba* and *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
Extensive citations on light phenomenology:
- Like sky-rainbow, pure of afflictions
- Sphere vast, expanse uncut
- Reality pure, objects arise
- Blue pervading, unchanging
- Five colors, condition-meeting

[18281-18320] [CONCEPT] Visionary Progression and Kayas:
The light manifestations correlate with kayas:
- **Dharmakaya**: Blue light, essence, sky-like
- **Longs sku**: Five lights, enjoyment, rainbow-like
- **Sprul sku**: Various appearances, emanation, form-like

Progressive stages:
1. Outer lights (*phyi 'od*): Preliminary, sense-based
2. Inner lights (*nang 'od*): Meditative, mind-based
3. Secret lights (*gsang 'od*): Advanced, wisdom-based
4. Suchness lights (*de nyid 'od*): Ultimate, nature-based
