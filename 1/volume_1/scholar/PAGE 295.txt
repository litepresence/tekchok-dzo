[12288-12330] [STRUCTURE] Three Non-Recognitions and Four Conditions Detailed
The text presents detailed analysis of the three non-recognitions (ma rig pa gsum) and their relationship to the four conditions. The structure presents: (1) causal non-recognition (rgyu bdag nyid gcig pa'i ma rig pa)—slight non-recognition of self-face without subject-object arising, (2) simultaneously-arisen non-recognition (lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig pa)—co-emergent subject-object without recognition, (3) imputed non-recognition (kun brtags pa'i ma rig pa)—conceptual imputation creating name-meaning grasping. The four conditions then elaborate: causal condition combining the three non-recognitions, dominant condition apprehending self as possessor, observed condition projecting object, immediately antecedent condition as their simultaneity.

[12288-12330] [PHILOLOGY] Non-Recognition Types and Conditions
The passage employs specialized non-recognition terminology: bdag nyid gcig pa'i ma rig (single-nature non-recognition), lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig (simultaneously-arisen non-recognition), kun brtags pa'i ma rig (imputed non-recognition). The particle tsam (merely/just) qualifies the initial non-recognition as slight. The phrase gnyis snang tsam du (merely dual appearance) describes the threshold of delusion. The compound ming don (name-meaning) indicates the linguistic-conceptual level. The analogy of body and limbs (skyes bu gzugs dang yan lag) illustrates how conditions combine.

[12288-12330] [CONTEXT] Threefold Avidyā Theory
The three non-recognitions correspond to standard Indian Buddhist threefold avidyā theory adapted to Dzogchen: (1) ātmāśrayāvidyā (self-basis non-recognition), (2) saha-jāvidyā (co-emergent non-recognition), (3) parikalpita-avidyā (imputed non-recognition). The Thal 'gyur (Prasāda) tantra citation provides textual authority. The twelve links of dependent origination (rten 'brel bcu gnyis) are identified as beginning with these non-recognitions and conditions.

[12288-12330] [CONCEPT] Delusion's Causal Cascade
The conceptual framework establishes delusion as a cascade from subtle to gross non-recognition. The causal non-recognition is the seed—slight failure to recognize without duality. The simultaneously-arisen non-recognition is the sprout—co-emergent subject-object without recognition. The imputed non-recognition is the full plant—conceptual construction solidifying the delusion. The four conditions are the environmental factors—soil, water, light—nourishing the growth of delusion. This framework shows how a minimal initial error (tsam) compounded by conditions produces the vast edifice of saṃsāric experience. The simultaneity (dus mtshungs) of conditions indicates that delusion is not sequential but emergent—all conditions must be present for delusion to arise.
