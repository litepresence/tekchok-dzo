[6951-7057] [CONCEPT] Empowerment Benefits and Location

[6951-7011] **Benefits of Receiving Empowerment:**
From *Rang shar*:
"Qualities of empowerment thus:
To great wisdom light
Without obstruction
Self-appearance shown as companion
All activities accomplished"

From *Dbang rin po che'i rgyud*:
"Guru abandoning desire
Completing empowerment ritual
According to sequence conferred
Even to great vajra holder
In this life definitely becomes"

From *Gsang snying*:
"With five essence empowerments conferred
From this time forward Buddha's son
All lower realms absent
High liberation's lord becomes"

Special benefits: Recognizes self-appearance in bardo, stabilizes therein, can emanate nirmāṇakāya for twenty-one days. For faculties' perfection, suffering, fear, etc., don't arise. During practice, wisdom light appears unceasingly.

Common benefits: Understands ḍākinīs' speech, blessed as honored by humans, loving-kindness to all beings, beautiful form, great merit increase, after death takes cakravartin body, great qualities arise like wish-fulfilling jewel, practices pure Dharma like lotus, circumambulated like stūpa, overpowers beings like parasol, liberates with wisdom like fire, benefits like sword, holds beings with compassion like vajra hook, realizes dharmadhātu wisdom inseparability like Dharma cloud.

[7012-7039] **Faults of Not Receiving Empowerment:**
From *Sgyu 'phrul gsang snying*:
"Not pleasing guru
Not obtaining empowerments
Listening, etc., beginning endeavors
Fruitless and lost"

From *Dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud*:
"Without depending on secret mantra empowerment, accomplishment won't occur
Like one without hand-ears
Cannot cross to river's other side"

From *Rang shar*:
"Faults of not obtaining empowerment thus:
In bardo, wandering
Fear
Obstruction
Hindrance
Consciousness lost
Until impregnated karmic body not abandoned
Not seen as worthy of honor by beings
Little merit
Short life
Few enjoyments
Narrow mouth
Many obstacles occur
All activities unaccomplished
This is fault of secret mantra practitioner not obtaining empowerment"

Without empowerment, even Buddha cannot turn Dharma wheel at Tathāgata level; without turning wheel, compassion's emanation body cannot benefit beings.

[7040-7057] **Location for Empowerment:**
Isolated, delightful, near accomplishment places. Generally auspicious with good earth-examination, good forests, etc.

Specific locations:
- With elaboration: student's body-element—south-facing if earth, east-facing if water, west-facing if fire, north-facing if wind
- Without elaboration: thick forest, charnel ground, mountain ravine according to student's element
- Greatly without elaboration: excellent is peak of mountain where three valleys meet
- Utterly without elaboration: extremely isolated or hermitage—one *rgyang grags* from village

All four empowerment places: others fear, wild beasts dwell, poisonous snakes, charnel grounds, *spyang gi*—excellent charnel ground with very fierce ḍākinīs.
