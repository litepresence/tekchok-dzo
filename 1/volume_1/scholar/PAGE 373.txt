[15371-15407] [STRUCTURE] Five Wisdoms Complete Manifestation
The text presents the complete manifestation of the five wisdoms as the result. The structure establishes: (1) mirror-like wisdom reflecting all phenomena, (2) equality wisdom recognizing sameness, (3) discriminating wisdom knowing differences, and (4) all-accomplishing wisdom completing activities.

[15371-15407] [PHILOLOGY] Five Wisdoms Terminology
The term me long lta bu'i ye shes (mirror-like wisdom) identifies the first wisdom. The compound mnyam nyid ye shes (equality wisdom) establishes the second. The phrase so sor rtog pa'i ye shes (discriminating wisdom) identifies the third.

[15371-15407] [CONTEXT] Wisdom Completion
The text presents the five wisdoms as the completion of practice. Each wisdom represents a different aspect of enlightened cognition. Together they form the complete wisdom of a Buddha.

[15371-15407] [CONCEPT] Wisdom as Natural Function
The text conceptualizes the five wisdoms as the natural functions of pure awareness. Mirror-like wisdom is awareness's capacity to reflect; equality wisdom is its recognition of sameness; discriminating wisdom is its knowing of differences. These are not achievements but recognitions.
