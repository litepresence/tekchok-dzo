[00001-00007] [CONTEXT] Particular Explanation of Definite Transference
**Analysis:** This section fulfills the second division (gnyis pas) announced previously, presenting the 'pho ba nges pa'i gnad (crucial points of definite transference) in particularized explanation. The framework correlates the four seasons with elemental wind qualities: winter produces chab rom (waterfall-like) wind that transforms into me rlung (fire wind) at death-time; spring produces sa bon (seed-like) wind transforming into chu'i rlung (water wind); summer produces me stag (fire-spark) wind transforming into sa rlung (earth wind); autumn produces me tog (flower) wind transforming into rlung gi rlung (wind wind). This seasonal-elemental correspondence determines critical lifespan transitions.

[00008-00015] [STRUCTURE] Temporal Wind Transference Patterns
**Analysis:** The passage presents four time-based transference patterns (rim pa): daytime me rlung becoming chu rlung causes illness; nighttime chu rlung becoming sa rlung causes illness; twilight sa becoming rlung causes illness; evening rlung becoming me rlung causes illness. This four-fold temporal structure (nyin/mtshan/nang/nub dus) establishes the prognostic framework for determining inauspicious periods based on elemental disharmonies.

[00016-00025] [PHILOLOGY] Elemental Pathology Terminology
**Analysis:** The text enumerates illness categories by element: mkhris pa (bile/fire disorders) from me rlung, bad kan (phlegm/water disorders) from chu, rlung nad (wind disorders) from rlung, and two combined categories—ldan pa (possessing/associated, i.e., two combined) and 'dus pa (accumulated, i.e., three or more combined). The term ldan pa indicates dual-element pathologies, while 'dus pa indicates complex multi-element conditions. This reflects the rgyud bzhi (Four Tantras) medical classification system integrated with subtle body energetics.

[00025-00033] [CONCEPT] Wind-Element Physiological Functions
**Analysis:** This passage details specific physiological functions attributed to elemental wind interactions: chu'i rlung purifies chu ser (lymph) and regulates blood/flesh purification; chu'i sa constricts/expands water channels; chu'i chu governs oral and ocular moisture; sa'i sa produces flesh, fat, bones, marrow, and byang sems (bodhicitta/sexual essence) in five stages; sa'i chu performs thig le (bindu/essence) functions including conception mechanics; sa'i me produces heat for digestion and the four activities of birth, aging, sickness, death; sa'i rlung produces strength, vitality, movement, and body heat. These functions demonstrate the comprehensive somatic mapping in Tibetan subtle body theory.

[00033-00042] [CONTEXT] Reproductive Physiology Technicalities
**Analysis:** The sa'i chu (earth-water) functions govern reproductive physiology through thig le (bindu) operations. The text describes: dngul chu'i dum bu (mercury-like globule) preventing conception; rta rnga'i mdud pa (horse-drum knot) producing female offspring; mig ka chung (small eye-opening) producing male offspring. These technical terms reflect Tibetan embryological theories correlating subtle energetic patterns with gender determination, derived from both medical (gso ba rig pa) and tantric (sngags) traditions.

[00042-00048] [STRUCTURE] Concluding Elemental Functions
**Analysis:** The passage concludes the elemental enumeration with remaining functions: sa'i rlung produces sensory faculties (dbang po) and their supports (dbang rten); sa'i rlung generates karma and conceptual thought; rlung gi me produces cognitive intensities (shes pa'i rtsal ba)—light (yang ba), heavy (lci ba), excited (mched pa), dull ('ur ba), full (gang ba), empty (stongs pa). The section transitions to rlung gi rlung controlling respiration and specific gender-related pathologies, establishing the comprehensive scope of wind-element physiology.
