[19822-19839] [CONCEPT] The Expanse Lamp: Five-Light Self-Resonance

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Fourth lamp: expanse lamp (*dbyings kyi sgron ma*). Its object is five-light self-resonance (*'od lnga'i rang gdangs*).

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *dbyings kyi sgron ma* (expanse lamp), *'od lnga'i rang gdangs* (five-light self-resonance), *stong pa* (emptiness), *gsal* (clear), *sgrib bral* (free from obscuration), *gdangs phyin pa* (radiance pervaded), *khyab cing yangs pa* (pervasive and expansive), *gcig 'dus pa* (gathered as one), *bag rdul dengs pa* (bag full of dust), *mnyam rdzogs chos nyid* (equally complete nature), *'od gsal dag pa'i lus* (light clear pure body).

- **[CONTEXT]** Citation from *Thal 'gyur*: expanse's object is emptiness; clear and obscuration-free radiance pervaded; pervasive expansive gathered as one; in sky full of dust; equally complete pure nature; clear pristine cognition five's resonance; light clear pure body itself.

[19840-19867] [STRUCTURE] Supports of the Four Lamps: General and Specific

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Third topic: supports (*rten*). Two divisions: (1) general support of lamps, (2) specific supports for each lamp.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *sgron ma spyi'i rten* (lamps' general support), *'khor ba dbyings su grol ba'i rten byed* (support that liberates samsara into expanse), *so so'i rten* (individual supports), *rgyang zhags* (far-cast), *shes rab* (wisdom), *thig le* (sphere), *dbyings* (expanse), *dag ma dag gnyis snang ba* (appearance of pure and impure two), *las dang tshogs pa* (karma and assembly), *tshig don* (word-meaning), *yid min rtog pa* (mind-not discrimination), *grub pa'i mtha'* (established extreme), *phyi nang gi snang shes gnyis* (outer inner appearance consciousness two), *rnam shes* (consciousness), *bar snang* (intermediate space), *rtsa rlung thig le* (channel wind sphere).

- **[CONCEPT]** General support: liberates samsara into expanse. The *Thal 'gyur* citation: pure pristine cognition lamp's support—generally support and supported—cause samsara-nirvana seed to develop.

Specific supports:
  1. **Far-cast:** supported on impure-pure two appearances; liberating pure-impure, supported on body and wisdom.
  2. **Wisdom:** supported on word-meaning; citation mentions: self-arisen wisdom support is words, discrimination of is-not, established extreme, view-meditation, nature.
  3. **Sphere:** supported on outer-inner appearance-consciousness two; citation: sphere emptiness' support is consciousness itself, intermediate space, channel-wind-sphere, pure wisdom.
  4. **Expanse:** supported on outer-inner dharma-light-body; citation: pure expanse's support is brow-center itself, sky, light-sphere, various bodies.

[19868-19877] [CONCEPT] Distinction Between Support and Object

**Analysis:**
- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *rten dang yul gyi khyad par* (distinction of support and object), *ldan chos kyi yon tan* (possessed dharma qualities), *rten dang brten par bzhag* (established as support and supported), *yul yul snang* (object object-appearance), *chos nyid mngon sum snang ba* (nature direct appearance), *rtog dpyod zad pa* (exhausted investigation), *sgom pa* (meditation).

- **[CONCEPT]** Crucial distinction: near (support, supported, supported manner) vs. far (object, object-appearance). Support (*rten*) is the three gathered; object (*yul*) is the three gathered as object-dharma.

Specific functions:
  - Far-cast lamp: direct appearance of nature destroys samsara through familiarization.
  - Wisdom lamp: exhausted investigation generates realization.
  - Sphere lamp: seeing the flower expands appearance.
  - Expanse lamp: light clear arising empties delusion-appearance.
