[00001-00046] [STRUCTURE] Ultimate Integration: The Four Lamps as Liberative Path

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage synthesizes the four-lamp teachings into a coherent liberative trajectory. The organization: (1) distinctive characteristics of supports and objects, (2) progressive familiarization leading to appearance-expansion, (3) channel-root residing method, (4) the fourfold practice of view-meditation-conduct-result, (5) somatic localization of the four aspects. The passage culminates in the identification of four "palaces" (gzhal yas) where secret mantra resides.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: yul rten khyad par (distinctions of object and support), rtsa ba nang bzhugs (channel-root inner-residing), lta sgom spyod 'bras (view, meditation, conduct, result), rin chen zur brgyad (eight-cornered jewel/ratna), dung khang b+han+da (conch-shell house). The term "thog tu thim" (dissolved above/into the crown) indicates the upward movement of consciousness. "Har re sang nge" (clear and limpid) describes the quality of settled awareness.

- **[CONTEXT]** The *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs* (Lion Perfection of Power) citation establishes the non-dual nature of rdzogs chen practice: without doing, nothing arises; without attachment, self-liberation. The four-palace schema (eight-cornered jewel, channel palace, conch-shell house, eye palace) integrates tantric maṇḍala architecture with subtle body physiology. The passage bridges tantric generation/completion stages with rdzogs chen "cutting-through" (khregs chod) and "direct transcendence" (thod rgal) modalities.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents the culmination of four-lamp practice wherein: (1) distinctive familiarization destroys saṃsāra (rgyang zhags), generates realization (shes rab), expands appearances (thig le), and empties delusion (dbyings); (2) the "channel-root residing" indicates the stabilization of thig le at the navel/heart; (3) the fourfold practice reveals that view is ceaseless penetration ('gag med zang thal), meditation is non-conceptual equanimity, conduct is spontaneous self-liberation, and result is sphere-awareness self-luminosity. The four palaces indicate the somatic localization of mantra-essence: heart (jewel), channels, throat (conch), and eyes.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants noted.
