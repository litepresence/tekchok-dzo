[8515-8585] [STRUCTURE] Bodhicitta Production and Bindu Refinement

**Bodhicitta Production Sequence:**
From *Dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*:
"From secret lotus place
Bodhicitta born upward
Secret vajra hole
Mix with bodhicitta"

Four stages:
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): Entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Supreme joy** (*mchog dga'*): Wisdom wind held
3. **Non-joy** (*dga' bral*): Thought-free, beyond joy/sorrow
4. **Co-emergent joy** (*lhan cig skyes pa'i dga' ba*): Bliss-emptiness inseparable

**Bindu Refinement Process:**
Five lineages' bodhicitta—refinement three times:
- First: channel mouth sealed, bliss generated
- Second: bindu held, channels expand
- Third: wisdom wind enters central channel

From *Sgyu 'phrul*:
"Bodhicitta bindu refinement
Supreme and common qualities
Whatever desired in mind
This certainly accomplishes"

**Channel Locations:**
- Root: Dharmakāya bliss
- Waist: Saṃbhogakāya bliss
- Tip: Nirmāṇakāya bliss

[8586-8668] [PHILOLOGY] Three Vajras Integration

Through three syllables (*sku gsung thugs kyi yi ge gsum*) creating three vajras:
- *Oṃ* creates vajra: body three kāyas unified (*sku gsum gcig tu 'dril*)
- *Āḥ* generates bodhicitta: speech vajra—unspeakable, invisible, inconceivable speech unified
- *Hūṃ* creates vase: mind vajra—Dharmakāya's non-conceptual, non-thinking; Saṃbhogakāya's non-distracted; Nirmāṇakāya's manifold knowledge unified

This unifies inexhaustible body, speech, mind ornament maṇḍala wheel.

**Bindu Refinement Process:**
Holding vajra tip with three vajra body, speech, mind syllables:
- Produces three bliss results sequentially and instantaneously

Mother's E creates lotus—great bliss body seal
*Hrīḥ* creates lotus bell—great bliss speech seal
*Ha* creates lotus anther—great bliss mind seal

This liberates body, speech, mind bonds—"self-liberated great seal" (*rang grol phyag rgya chen po*).

**Phat and Hrīḥ Sealing:**
- Phat sealing lotus opening: great bliss wind released into spontaneous presence
- Hrīḥ sealing vajra opening: enjoying great bliss essence

From *Snga ma*:
"Body, speech, mind great vajra
Three seals joined in lotus center
For refining bodhicitta, Hrīḥ seals skillfully
Not releasing wisdom, Phat seals opening"

**Three-fold Refinement:**
Three vajra mind refinements from vajra tip to waist:
- Body channels expand
- From there to root: mind expands into great bliss
- From there to navel: body-mind non-dual bliss expands

[8669-8696] [CONTEXT] Bliss Generation Sequence and View Integration

**Four Seals:**
1. **Action seal** (*las kyi phyag rgya*): Outer body refinement, effortless four activities
2. **Commitment seal** (*dam tshig gi phyag rgya*): Waist refinement, stainless four wisdoms' commitment inseparable
3. **Dharma seal** (*chos kyi phyag rgya*): Tip refinement, enjoying general/specific characteristics
4. **Great seal** (*phyag rgya chen po*): Holding bindu itself—bliss-emptiness non-dual non-abiding

**Bliss Generation Sequence:**
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Sensation** (*tshor ba*): enjoying resultant after experience
3. **Bliss** (*bde ba*): mind and wisdom disturbed time
4. **Experience** (*myong ba*): mind and wisdom inseparable
5. **Emptiness** (*stong pa*): neither mind nor wisdom distinguished, transcending extremes and distinctions

From *Snga ma*:
"First joy alone
Second sensation, contact, experience
Third called bliss
Fourth experience co-emergent
Fifth called emptiness"

**View Integration:**
Not time for actual consort method, root-generation—ordinary desire without mental fabrication. View-oscillation time: self-body dependent bliss generated without mental control.

Through actual body refinement, holding bodhicitta, refined/unrefined time—extraordinary bliss arises, experience not mixed with mental fabrication. Only knowing mind as mere emptiness. When ordinary conceptions absent in mind—obtained view time.

Refined bodhicitta arriving at holding measure—channels spread, body-mind non-dual great seal beyond mind experienced. View stabilization time: however done, power over bodhicitta, no change/transformation.

[8697-8755] [CONCEPT] Postures, Signs, and Benefits

**Postures for Channel Mouth Sealing:**
1. Lion's leap (*seng ge'i mchongs stabs*)
2. Leg/arm joints contracted—cuts cyclic existence root
3. Chest space thrown—wind-mind union key point
4. Eyes forcefully drawn—wisdom gate opening key point
5. Intestines curved—body bliss definite liberation key point
6. Long Hūṃ recitation—wind-mind dharmatā union key point
7. Occasional E sound—dharmatā purity result key point

**Bindu Three Locations:**
- Root held: Dharmakāya bliss experienced
- Waist held: Saṃbhogakāya bliss experienced
- Tip held: Nirmāṇakāya bliss experienced

**Refinement Benefits:**
- Channel expansion: diseases don't arise
- Wind expansion: samādhi arises
- Can walk without feet touching ground
- See body's atoms as vajra
- Fly in space
- Life equal to sun and moon
- Free from food/clothing attachment

Conventional bodhicitta benefits.

**Ultimate Bodhicitta Benefits:**
- Special transference (*'pho ba khyad par can*) practice
- Consciousness entering other's city

From *Dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*:
"Refining bodhicitta bindu
Supreme and common qualities
Whatever desired in mind
This certainly accomplishes."

**Holding Measure:**
Bindu falling into bhaga but wind-power returning to mother's bindu—not escaping measure.
