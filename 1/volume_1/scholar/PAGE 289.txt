[12087-12117] [STRUCTURE] Abiding in the Expanse After Liberation
The text presents the second mode of Samantabhadra's liberation: abiding in the expanse (dbyings na bzhugs pa) after recognition. The structure describes: (1) the expanse-body (dbyings kyi chos sku) as vast and without center or limit, (2) the palace of spontaneous presence (lhundrub kyi gzhal yas khang) within that expanse, (3) Kunzangmo (dharmadhātu) and Kunzangpo (dharmakāya) as self-radiant wisdom and appearance, (4) the interconnection of means and wisdom, (5) the horse of wisdom that cognizes all objects, (6) the unmixed inner radiance of five lights, (7) the inexhaustible secret sun shining in the expanse, (8) the five elements of the expanse as self-display and self-radiance. The passage establishes the cosmological framework of buddhahood as non-departing from the expanse while manifesting complete qualities.

[12087-12117] [PHILOLOGY] Spatial and Cosmological Terminology
The passage employs elaborate spatial terminology: dpangs mtho ba'i klong (expanse of great depth), gting gsal (clear depth), gzhal yas khang (immeasurable palace). The compound btsun mo (consort) paired with chos sku indicates the union of dharmakāya with dharmadhātu. The phrase thabs dang shes rab (means and wisdom, upāya-prajñā) establishes the paired complementarity. The term srog tu gyur pa (becoming the life-force) emphasizes the centrality of wisdom. The particle zhing (and/but) creates enumerative sequences of qualities.

[12087-12117] [CONTEXT] Maṇḍala Cosmology and Tathāgatagarbha
The description of buddha-abiding draws on maṇḍala cosmology and tathāgatagarbha (buddha-nature) frameworks. The immeasurable palace (gzhal yas khang) reflects standard descriptions of pure lands. The pairing of Kunzangmo and Kunzangpo reflects the gendered complementarity of dharmadhātu (female) and dharmakāya (male) in Vajrayāna symbolism. The five elements as self-display reflects the Dzogchen transformation of elemental theory into manifestations of awareness.

[12087-12117] [CONCEPT] Non-departing Buddha-hood
The conceptual framework establishes that buddha-hood involves no departure from the expanse (dbyings) of primordial purity. The buddha does not go elsewhere or transform into something different; rather, the buddha recognizes the expanse's inherent qualities as spontaneously present. The palace of spontaneous presence is not constructed but naturally arrayed (rang bkod) from the basis's own radiance. The secret sun (gsang ba'i nyi ma) shines without rising or setting—qualities are continuously manifest, not temporally produced. The interconnection of means and wisdom (thabs shes rab) indicates that buddha-activity occurs through the dynamic interplay of compassionate engagement and empty wisdom, both inherently present in the expanse. This framework establishes buddhahood as the recognition of what has always been the case, not an achievement of a new state.
