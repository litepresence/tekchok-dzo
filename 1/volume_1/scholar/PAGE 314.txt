[13053-13098] [STRUCTURE] Integration of Cutting Through and Leapover
The text presents the integration of cutting through (khregs chod) and leapover (thod rgal). The structure establishes: (1) the complementary nature of the two practices, (2) cutting through providing the view, leapover providing the appearance, (3) the necessity of both for complete realization, and (4) their ultimate non-duality.

[13053-13074] [PHILOLOGY] Integration Terminology
The term zung 'jug (union, yuganaddha) describes the integration. The phrase khregs chod kyi lta ba (view of cutting through) and thod rgal gyi snang ba (vision of leapover) identify the complementary contributions. The compound lta snyoms (view and meditation in equilibrium) describes the result. The term gnyis med (non-dual) provides the ultimate frame.

[13075-13098] [CONTEXT] Complementary Practice System
The integration presentation establishes the complementary nature of the two main Dzogchen practices. This reflects the systematic approach of the Nyingthig tradition, where practitioners balance emptiness and appearance, cutting through and leapover. The integration prevents one-sided development.

[13053-13098] [CONCEPT] Two Practices as Single Path
The text conceptualizes cutting through and leapover as two aspects of a single path—like two wings of a bird. Cutting through establishes the empty essence (ngo bo stong pa); leapover develops the luminous nature (rang bzhin gsal ba). Together they comprise the complete path. Ultimately, both resolve into the same recognition of non-dual awareness.
