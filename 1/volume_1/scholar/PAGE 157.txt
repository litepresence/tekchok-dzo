[6282-6295] [CONTEXT] Teaching Transference to Other Fields
**Analysis:** Lines 6282-6295 complete the teaching transference narrative:

**Seven Cycles Completion [6282-6284]:**
The seven flourishing and declining cycles completed, after life's ten years, teaching's three supports do not remain in this world. They transfer to the south, Beautiful-array (*mdzes ldan bkod pa*) Buddhafield, where seven flourishing and declining cycles complete that field's benefit.

**Saha World Emptiness [6284]:**
This is the time when Saha becomes empty — the world-system's destruction.

**Transfer Sequence [6285-6291]:**
The three supports then transfer north to the Vast-protection (*yangspy ob*) world. Buddha Utpala-flower-beautiful holds them, and after seven flourishing and declining cycles, they transfer west to the Crested-ornament-sound-vast (*gtsug phud dbyangs yangs*) world.

**Final Liberation [6286-6291]:**
Buddha Cyclic-existence-destroyer (*'khor ba 'jig*) holds them for seven hundred thousand years of flourishing and declining. Afterward, all beings of that field and Vajradhara's arranged Brahma aeon are liberated in the original ground.

**Dissolution [6290-6291]:**
Vajradhara's arranged Brahma aeon, with its container and contents, becomes empty — a thousand become space, one, residing for eighty-five aeons.

**Three Supports Disappear [6292-6295]:**
The three teaching supports, Vajradhara's great deeds completed, dissolve into dharmatā's peaceful expanse, becoming invisible.

[6296-6341] [CONTEXT] Cyclic Renewal of Teachings
**Analysis:** Lines 6296-6341 describe the cyclical renewal of teachings:

**New Emanation [6296-6304]:**
Then again, as beings appear from the expanse, an emanation arranges Brahma. From six hundred thousand aeons to taming beings' appearance, the taming teacher comes. From Samantabhadra's blessing, the teaching's three supports self-arise, without flourishing and decline, benefiting beings.
