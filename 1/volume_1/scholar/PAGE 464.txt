[00001-00040] [PHILOLOGY] Objects of the Four Lamps: Viṣaya Analysis

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage details the objects (yul) of the four lamps with increasing specificity. The organizational structure: (1) general object (sprin bral nam mkha'/cloudless sky), (2) specific objects for each lamp, (3) the unique feature of the distant-cast lamp (object concentration at the eyes), (4) philosophical implications. The progression moves from general spatial metaphors to specific somatic and cognitive loci.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: yul (object/viṣaya), mtshan nyid (characteristic), gzugs la sogs (form, etc.—the five sense-objects), tshig don (word and meaning), 'od snang (light-appearance), mi 'gul ba (non-movement), gzigs stangs gcun pa (compressed gaze). The term "mig gi de bzhin nyid" (suchness of the eye) indicates the ultimate nature of visual perception. "Dbyings kyi rang bzhin shes rab sku" indicates wisdom-body as the nature of the expanse.

- **[CONTEXT]** The emphasis on the eyes as the gateway for realization reflects a distinctive feature of rdzogs chen practice, particularly the Nyingtik tradition. The citation from the *Nor bu 'phra bkod* establishes that understanding the "suchness of the eye" (mig gi de kho na nyid) leads to comprehension of all phenomena. The distinction between outer, inner, and intermediate objects reflects Buddhist epistemological categories (phyi nang bar gsum). The "vajra-intertwined body" (rdo rje lu gu rgyud kyi sku) serves as the mediator between dharmatā and appearance.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents a sophisticated analysis of meditative objects wherein: the distant-cast lamp's object is light-form in empty space; the wisdom lamp's object is meaning-and-word; the sphere lamp's object is color and dimension; the expanse lamp's object is the radiance of the five lights. The crucial point (gnad) that all essential points converge at the eyes reflects the rdzogs chen emphasis on direct perception over inferential reasoning. The "non-moving gateway" (sgo mi 'gul ba) indicates a specific gaze technique where eye-movement is arrested to stabilize visionary experience.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants noted.
