[12915-12960] [STRUCTURE] Leapover (thod rgal) Introduction
The text introduces leapover (thod rgal) practice. The structure establishes: (1) thod rgal as transcendence through direct perception, (2) the four visions (snang ba bzhi) of thod rgal, (3) spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as the basis, and (4) the integration of thod rgal with cutting through.

[12915-12936] [PHILOLOGY] Leapover Terminology Analysis
The term thod rgal (leapover, direct transcendence) derives from thod (directly, immediately) and rgal (cross over, transcend). The compound thod rgal gyi snang ba (visions of leapover) identifies the practice's characteristic appearances. The phrase "'od gsal" (clear light) describes the luminosity. The term lhun grub (spontaneous presence) provides the ground.

[12937-12960] [CONTEXT] Thod Rgal Luminosity Practice
Leapover practice focuses on the luminosity ('od gsal) aspect of mind, developing visionary experiences through specific techniques. This practice is particularly associated with the Nyingthig (snying thig) traditions and represents the "appearance" complement to cutting through's "emptiness" emphasis.

[12915-12960] [CONCEPT] Leapover as Direct Transcendence
The text conceptualizes leapover as "crossing over" directly to the result through luminous vision. Unlike gradual paths that progress step by step, thod rgal "leaps" to the goal through direct perception of light and appearances. The four visions represent progressive deepening of this direct perception, culminating in complete realization.
