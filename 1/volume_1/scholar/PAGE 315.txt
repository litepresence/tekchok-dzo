[13121-13144] [CONTEXT] Common Obstacles Across Traditions

The Dzogchen antidotes emphasize recognition rather than counter-measures, reflecting the tradition's distinctive approach. Obstacles are recognized as the play of awareness rather than rejected.

[13099-13144] [CONCEPT] Obstacles as Wisdom Display
The text conceptualizes obstacles as displays of wisdom rather than enemies to be defeated. Dullness and agitation are recognized as movements of awareness; attachment to experiences is recognized as grasping at wisdom's display. The antidote is always recognition—seeing the obstacle as what it truly is. This transforms obstacles into aids to realization.
