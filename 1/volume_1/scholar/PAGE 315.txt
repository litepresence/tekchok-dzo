[L1-12] [STRUCTURE] Eighth Instruction: Clear Light Folded into Space
**Analysis:** The text introduces the eighth instruction (brgyad pa): "symbol of clear light folded into space" ('od gsal klong du dril ba'i brda). This begins with a citation from the *Thalgyur* (Thal 'gyur) tantra on symbolic language (brda don) and word connections (tshig 'brel). The passage presents the famous metaphor: "in the conflagration at the end of an eon, within the center of space/though no person is burned/a human speaks Dharma from the mouth/performs the act of killing others' lives/virtuous practice increases - how amazing!" (bskal pa'i me dpung klong dkyil na/mi gcig tshig pa med par yang/kha nas sde snod chos bshad cing/las su gzhan gyi srog gcod pa/dge sbyor 'phel ba ya re cha).

[L13-25] [PHILOLOGY] Iron House and Darkness Metaphor
**Analysis:** The passage continues: "if there is an iron house without door/in the center of dark space without light/though sun and moon luminosity exist/no one sees them/how amazing that not seeing/individual sense powers' clear objects/clearly appears but not seen." The decoding explains: "conflagration not burning person, virtue increases" means within the fire of conceptual-aggregates-afflictions (rtog tshogs nyon mongs kyi me), the person of self-arising wisdom (rang byung ye shes kyi mi) dwells from beginningless time (thog ma med dus nas gnas kyang) without being burned, tainted, or affected (ma gos ma bslad ma tshig la). When one knows one's own face (rang ngo rang gis shes dus), one speaks the tripitaka (sde snod bshad), "killing others' lives" means conceptual-aggregates having gone to self-liberation (rtog tshogs rang grol du song ba), because it is mind grasping at other (gzhan du 'dzin pa'i sems).

[L26-39] [CONCEPT] The Meaning of Fire and Iron House
**Analysis:** The meaning of the metaphors is decoded: the "iron house of darkness" (lcags khang mun pa can) is one's body - within the citta (tsitta ka'i nang na), awareness and ignorance dwell together (rig pa ma rig pa dang na cig gnas pa). "Not seeing sun and moon" (nyi zla ma mthong ba) means though present in all (thams cad la yod kyang), without oral instruction (gdams ngag med pas) they are not seen. For individuals with clear oral instruction (so so la gsal ba gdams ngag can), manifest appearances are seen now (mngon sum gyi snang ba da lta mthong ba). "Not seeing" (mthong ba med pa) means when one sees that empty form oneself (stong gzugs de rang gis mthong dus), one standing nearby does not see it thus (drung na 'khod pa gcig gis gcig gi de ltar med pa) - this is the symbolic meaning of awareness-clear light (rig pa 'od gsal gyi brda don).

[L40-51] [CONTEXT] Concluding the Symbol Section
**Analysis:** The text notes that countless forms of symbols such as these are renowned in this unsurpassed vehicle (bla na med pa'i theg pa 'di la grags pas) and should be known in their respective tantra contexts (rgyud so so'i skabs su shes par bya). This symbolic basis (brda'i gnas 'di) is made by dakinis (mkha' 'gro ma rnams kyis bdag byas pas), extremely profound (shin tu gnyan zhing), and difficult to realize (rtogs par yang dka'). But if realized, because the meaning is great (don rlabs che), it is the highest Dharma (rab kyi chos). While other words can be confused or mixed in between (tshig gzhan rnams bar du bslad pa dang 'chol ba srid la), this symbol cannot be changed by anyone (brda 'di ni sus kyang bsgyur du med), cannot be confused (bslad du med pas), has great blessing (byin rlabs che zhing), shows the meaning directly (don la nye bar ston gyi), and is not the domain of words (tshig gi spyad yul ma yin pas) - it is great secret (gsang ba chen po).
