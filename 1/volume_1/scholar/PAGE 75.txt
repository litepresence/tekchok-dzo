[2749-2798] [STRUCTURE] Self-Enlightened Methods from Rigpa Rangshar
**Analysis:**

**Rigpa Rangshar Citation:**

```
Aho! Secret Lord, listen!
The sutra vehicle of self-enlightened ones
Has twelve links of dependent arising as its entrance.
The view realized is person-selflessness,
Seeing half-power regarding dharma-self.
Protecting the two hundred fifty disciplines,
The meditation stage: meditating on non-thought dharma-nature.
Outer and inner dependent arisings,
Through habituation become strength,
The fruit is considered complete perfection.
```

**Twelve Links Meditation:**

The example: corpse in charnel ground

**Forward Order:**
1. From ignorance (*ma rig pa*), formative forces (*'du byed*)
2. From formative forces, consciousness (*rnam shes*)
3. From consciousness, name (*ming*)
4. From name, form (*gzugs*) nature arises
5. From form, six sense-bases (*skye mched drug*)
6. From six sense-bases, contact (*reg pa*)
7. From contact, feeling (*tshor ba*)
8. From feeling, craving (*sred pa*)
9. From craving, grasping (*len pa*)
10. From grasping, existence (*srid pa*)
11. From existence, birth (*skye ba*)
12. From birth, aging (*rga ba*), sickness (*na ba*), death (*'chi ba*)

**Reverse Order:**
Going to charnel ground: "From what did this corpse arise?" "From death," thus contemplating up to ignorance.

**Eight Unpleasant Meditations:**

As antidotes to attachment:
1. Blue (*sngo*) — lividity
2. Red (*dmag*) — putrefaction
3. Remaining (*lhag*)
4. Swollen (*rgyas*)
5. Worm-entered (*srin bu za*)
6. Scattered (*bsil ba*)
7. White (*dkar*)
8. Skeleton (*rus pa*)

**Result:**
Without listening or hearing, therefore called self-enlightened vehicle.

One falls into the hearer state.
