[12118-12164] [STRUCTURE] Buddha Qualities and Activity
The text continues describing the qualities of buddhahood and transitions to the third mode: acting for others' benefit. The structure presents: (1) inexhaustible depth-clear radiance, (2) five wisdom lights coiling in the expanse, (3) emptiness of substantial form yet not mere nothingness (phyam chad), (4) the single knot of essence, nature, and compassion, (5) light-possessing awareness in inexhaustible appearance, (6) the inexhaustible wisdom-banner peak with ten powers, four fearlessnesses, etc., (7) the continuously blazing light-lamp, (8) wisdom's self-appearance without increase or decrease, (9) the great compassion path not traveling elsewhere, (10) the five-kāya stupa with five wisdom terraces, (11) non-moving from the expanse's dharmatā seat, (12) all-pervading compassion-path to the limits of directions. The passage establishes complete buddhahood as simultaneously self-abiding and all-pervading.

[12118-12164] [PHILOLOGY] Buddha-Quality Enumeration
The passage employs enumerative terminology from standard buddhology: stobs bcu (ten powers), mi 'jigs pa bzhi (four fearlessnesses), mtshan (major marks), dpe byad (minor signs). The compound rgyal mtshan gyi rtse mo (peak of the victory banner) metaphorically describes supreme attainment. The term phyam chad (mere emptiness/nothingness) appears negated to avoid nihilism. The phrase 'phel 'grib med pa (without increase or decrease) characterizes wisdom's stability. The compound thugs rje chen po'i stong lam (empty path of great compassion) establishes the activity dimension.

[12118-12164] [CONTEXT] Standard Buddhist Qualities in Dzogchen Framework
The enumeration of standard buddha-qualities (ten powers, four fearlessnesses, thirty-two marks, eighty signs) integrates classical Mahayana buddhology with Dzogchen's spontaneous presence framework. These qualities, traditionally acquired through aeons of practice, are here presented as spontaneously present (lhun grub) in the expanse. The Rang shar (Self-Arisen) tantra citation provides textual authority. The description of the stupa with five kāyas and five wisdoms reflects standard Vajrayāna maṇḍala structures.

[12118-12164] [CONCEPT] Spontaneously Present Qualities
The conceptual framework establishes that all classical buddha-qualities are spontaneously present (lhun grub) in the expanse, not produced through effort or practice. The ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and marks/signs are the natural expression (rang rtsal) of awareness, not achievements accumulated over time. This framework transforms the gradualist model of buddhahood into a recognition model—qualities are present but unrecognized; recognition makes them "visible" without creating them. The simultaneity of self-abiding (non-movement from the expanse) and all-pervading activity (compassion-path to all directions) reflects the non-dual dynamic of buddhahood: complete rest and complete engagement are not contradictory but mutually enabling.
