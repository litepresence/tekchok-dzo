[12087-12117] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom's Ripening into Kaya and the Two Omnisciences
This section presents: (1) the mechanism of wisdom's action in liberation (rtogs pa'i shes rab kyis byed pa, 12087), citing the *Sgron ma 'bar ba'i rgyud* (Lamp Illumination Tantra, 12088-12094), (2) the distinction between two modes of omniscience (thams cad mkhyen pa'i ye shes, 12096-12106), and (3) the beginning of the second division: abiding in the expanse after liberation (grol nas dbyings na bzhugs pa'i tshul, 12107). The wisdom-action formula: basis itself ripens as result through wisdom (gzhi nyid 'bras bur smin byed shes rab), wisdom ripens as kaya (shes rab sku ru smin pa), essence-dharmakaya ripens as wisdom-dharmakaya (ngo bo nyid kyi chos sku...ye shes chos kyi sku ru smin), producing uninterrupted wisdom stream (ye shes rgyun ma chad) and spontaneous clarity (sku dang ye shes lhun grub gsal). The two omnisciences: (a) knowing all knowables as appearing to own face (shes bya yul snang du shar ba'i rnam pa rang ngor mkhyen pa), (b) abiding internally clear in dharmatā with analytical elaborations pacified (rang ngo nang gsal du bzhugs te chos nyid kyi ngang las dpyod byed kyi spros pa zhi ba).

[12087-12117] [PHILOLOGY] Ripening Terminology and Epistemic Distinctions
Critical grammatical constructions: (1) The causative smin byed/smin pa (to ripen/cause to ripen) establishes developmental transformation without substantial change: gzhi nyid 'bras bur smin byed shes rab ste/shes rab sku ru smin pa yis (12089-12090); (2) The continuative rgyun ma chad (uninterrupted stream, 12093) characterizes wisdom's continuity; (3) The dual shes pa (cognition) distinction: nang bzhugs kyi shes pa (internally abiding cognition) vs. phyi gzigs kyi shes pa (externally perceiving cognition, 12100-12101) - the two omnisciences mapped onto perceptual modes; (4) The spatial simile ltar (like/as): shel 'od nang du bsdus pa ltar (like crystal light gathering within, 12108); (5) The locative na with abiding: dbyings na bzhugs (abiding in expanse, 12107); (6) Spatial compounds: dbyings dpangs mtho ba'i klong (expanse of high extent, 12110), gting gsal (clear depth, 12111), gzhal yas khang (immeasurable mansion, 12111); (7) The simile ltar with 'od zer: gsang ba'i nyi ma dbyings na shar ro (secret sun rises in expanse, 12116).

[12087-12117] [CONTEXT] Lamp Illumination Tantra and Buddha-Field Cosmology
The section integrates: (1) *Sgron ma 'bar ba'i rgyud* citation (12088-12094) - an Atiyoga tantra on wisdom's ripening; (2) Two omnisciences reflect Indian pramāṇa traditions, particularly Dharmakīrti's distinction between direct perception (pratyakṣa) and inference (anumāna), here mapped onto Dzogchen's internal/external cognition framework; (3) "Youth in vase" (gzhon nu bum pa'i sku, 12109) derives from Tathāgatagarbha sūtras, illustrating buddha-nature's presence within beings; (4) "Five-light palace" ('od lnga'i lha khang) and "secret sun" (gsang ba'i nyi ma) reference thod rgal visionary geography; (5) Union of means and wisdom (thabs dang shes rab kyi dra ba, 12113) reflects standard Mahāyāna non-duality but within Dzogchen's spontaneous framework; (6) "Horse of knowing all knowables" (shes bya thams cad shes byed du grub pa'i rta, 12114) and "swift steed" (bang mgyogs, 12114) draw on Indian metaphorical traditions of wisdom as mount.

[12087-12117] [CONCEPT] Non-Dual Ripening Without Transformation and the Two Perspectives
The philosophical framework: (1) Ripening (smin pa) is not creation but manifestation - like fruit ripening on a tree, qualities become manifest through recognition without changing nature; (2) Recognition-wisdom (rtogs pa'i shes rab) is sole transformative agent, not external causes; (3) The two omnisciences are not different in essence (ngo bo gcig) but different in perspective (ldog pa tha dad) - internal abiding (nang bzhugs) versus external perception (phyi gzigs) share the same knowing nature viewed from different angles; (4) Abiding in expanse described through spatial metaphors: vast expanse without center/periphery (mtha' dbus med pa, 12110), clear depth (gting gsal, 12111), five lights as palace array ('od lnga gzhal yas khang gi bkod pa, 12111); (5) Spontaneous self-connection of means and wisdom (rang 'brel, 12113) without deliberate union; (6) Wisdom as life-force (shes rab srog tu gyur pa, 12114) animating the swift horse of cognition; (7) Five lights' internal radiance without mixture (ma 'dres la mnyam pa, 12115) - displaying variety without confusion; (8) Secret sun rises without setting (nub pa med pa, 12116) - unceasing luminosity.
