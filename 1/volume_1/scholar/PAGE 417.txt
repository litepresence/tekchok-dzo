[18521-18560] [STRUCTURE] # The Four Lamps: Final Integration
**Analysis:** Longchenpa provides the final integration of the four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) as the core of Volume 1's presentation:

**Progressive Structure:**
1. **First Lamp** (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*): Foundation
   - Method: Far-reaching gaze
   - Essence: Water-like clarity
   - Function: Opens visionary capacity

2. **Second Lamp** (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*): Development
   - Essence: Empty bindu
   - Classification: Six realms, twelve similes
   - Function: Detailed appearance recognition

3. **Third Lamp** (*dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma*): Integration
   - Essence: Pure sphere
   - Nature: Ka dag and lhun grub unity
   - Function: Expansive stability

4. **Fourth Lamp** (*shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*): Culmination
   - Essence: Self-arising wisdom
   - Classification: Five wisdoms
   - Function: Direct recognition

[18561-18600] [CONCEPT] Lamp-Kaya Correspondences:
**Progressive correlation with three kayas:**
- First lamp → Dharmakaya foundation
- Second lamp → Longs sku development
- Third lamp → Sphere-kaya integration
- Fourth lamp → Three kayas unity

**Reverse correlation:**
- Dharmakaya → Fourth lamp essence
- Longs sku → Third lamp display
- Sprul sku → Second lamp emanation
- Basis → First lamp ground

[18601-18640] [PHILOLOGY] Lamp terminology synthesis:
- *sgron ma* (lamp): Clarifying, illuminating
- *me long* (mirror): Reflecting, not grasping
- *thig le* (bindu): Spherical, containing
- *dbyings* (sphere): Expansive, pervading
- *shes rab* (wisdom): Knowing, discriminating
- *rang byung* (self-arisen): Unmade, spontaneous

[18641-18680] [CONTEXT] Citations on lamp integration:
From *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
- Four lamps thus
- Gradual and simultaneous
- Self-arisen essence
- Spontaneously perfect

[18681-18720] [CONCEPT] Eleven-Topic Structure Review:
Each lamp analyzed through:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*): What it is
2. Definition (*nges tshig*): Etymology
3. Classification (*dbye ba*): Types and aspects
4. Nature (*rang bzhin*): Inherent quality
5. Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*): Distinguishing marks
6. Familiarization (*goms tshul*): Practice method
7. Measure (*tshad*): Progress indicators
8. Abode (*gnas*): Location/support
9. Door (*sgo*): Entry point
10. Actual (*dngos*): True nature
11. Simile (*mthun dpe*): Illustrative example

This schema reflects the *mdzod* genre's encyclopedic comprehensiveness.

**Summary:** Page 417 provides the final integration of the four lamps, establishing their progressive structure, kaya correspondences, and eleven-topic analytical schema. This synthesis represents the heart of Longchenpa's presentation.
