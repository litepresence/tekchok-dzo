[3206-3208] [PHILOLOGY] Lord-Servant Relationship in Kriya
**Analysis:** Lines 3206-3208 elaborate the "lord and servant" (*rje dang 'bangs*) structure of Kriya Tantra practice:

**Key Phrases:**
- *bdag dang tshig sems dpa' gnyis* — Self and pledge-being (*samayasattva*) two
- *rje khol gyi rnam pa ltar bltas pas* — Viewed in the aspect of master-servant
- *bar chad zhi zhing dngos grub thob* — Obstacles pacified, siddhis obtained

**Two Accomplishments:**
1. **Common siddhis** (*thun mong gi dngos grub*) — Depend on conventional practice
2. **Supreme siddhi** (*mchog gi dngos grub*) — Depend on ultimate realization

The superiority (*khyad par du 'phags*) comes from not rejecting conventionality (*kun rdzob mi spong*) while not constructing ultimacy (*don dam pa mi bsgrub*).

[3209-3212] [STRUCTURE] Two Types of Kriya Practice
**Analysis:** The text distinguishes two approaches to deity yoga in Kriya:

1. **Visualization-focused** (*dmigs pa gtso bo*) [3209-3210]:
   - *bskyed rim dang rdzogs rim phra mo* — Generation stage and subtle completion stage
   - *'phro 'du dmigs pa'i lha sgom pa* — Meditating on deity of dispersal-gathering meditation
   - Transforming form, sound, thought into body, speech, mind of deity

2. **Purity-focused** (*dag pas gtso bo*) [3211-3212]:
   - Physical and verbal purity (*lus ngag gi gtsang sgra*) as primary
   - Mental meditation (*sems kyi sgom pa*) through visualization as primary

**Distinction:** The first emphasizes internal transformation; the second emphasizes external purification.

[3213-3234] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Authority: Rig pa rang shar
**Analysis:** Lines 3214-3233 quote extensively from the *Rig pa rang shar tantra* to establish Kriya view and practice:

**Key Verses:**
- [3215-3216]: "Kriya vehicle's established tenet: entry door is three purities"
- [3217]: "Entering through bathing and cleanliness"
- [3218-3220]: Protecting samaya (vows)
- [3221-3225]: Three purities defined — deity/mandala purity, substance/enjoyment purity, mantra/samadhi purity
- [3226-3228]: View of realization — deity and yogi as two, viewed in lord-servant manner
- [3229-3233]: Stages of abandonment — giving up meat, fish, garlic, alcohol; attachment to samadhi

This extensive quotation establishes the *Rig pa rang shar* as the root tantra for Kriya exposition.

[3235-3244] [STRUCTURE] Introduction to Upa Tantra
**Analysis:** Line 3235 introduces the fifth topic (*don lnga pa*) — Upa (Dual) Tantra (*gnyis ka rgyud kyi theg pa u pa ya*):

**Defining Characteristic:**
- *sp yod pa kri ya ltar byed* — Conduct like Kriya
- *lta ba yo ga ltar 'dod* — View like Yoga
- Therefore called "neither" (*ma ning*) vehicle — transcending both extremes

**Practice Elements [3238-3239]:**
- Abiding in bathing and cleanliness (*khrus dang gtsang sbra*)
- Purifying three doors (*sgo gsum dag par byas*)
- Accomplishing through five enlightenments (*mngon byang lnga*) and mandala king, etc.

**Scriptural Quotation [3240-3244]:** From *Rig pa rang shar*:
- "Upa is like this: view like Yoga, conduct like Kriya"
- "Therefore called Dual Tantra"

[3246] [STRUCTURE] Introduction to Yoga Tantra
**Analysis:** Line 3246 marks the transition to the sixth topic (*don drug pa*) — Yoga Tantra (*rnal 'byor rgyud kyi theg pa yo ga*). This structural marker uses the standard enumeration formula.

[3247-3248] [CONCEPT] Yoga Tantra: Five Enlightenments Framework
**Analysis:** Yoga Tantra practice is characterized by:

**Core View:**
- *mngon byang lnga'i sgo nas* — Through the door of five enlightenments
- *bdag dang lha gnyis spun dang grogs ltar lta* — Viewing self and deity as siblings/friends (equal relationship, not master-servant)
- *dam tshig dang gtsang sbra spyod pa* — Samaya and purity conduct

**Result:**
- *'bras bu 'khor lo tshogs chen gyis thob par 'dod* — Aspiring to attain through great assembly wheel

The shift from "lord-servant" (Kriya) to "siblings/friends" (Yoga) represents a progression in the practitioner-deity relationship.

[3249-3250] [STRUCTURE] Two Divisions of Yoga Tantra
**Analysis:** Yoga Tantra divides into two:

1. **Action-focused** (*las gtso bo*) — Emphasizing ritual activities
2. **Samadhi-focused** (*ting nge 'dzin gtso bo*) — Emphasizing meditation

This division reflects the two aspects of tantric practice: external ritual and internal yoga.

[3251-3264] [CONCEPT] Action-Focused Yoga Tantra
**Analysis:** The action-focused approach (*las gtso bo*) involves:

**Three Types of Ritual Activity:**

1. **Scattered action** (*las thor bu ba*) [3256-3260]:
   - Depending on any ritual limb (*cho ga'i yan lag gang rung*)
   - Continuous effort in one practice: offerings (*mchod pa*), torma (*gtor ma*), fire offering (*sbyin sreg*), recitation (*bsnyen pa*)

2. **Supreme action** (*las rgyal mchog*) [3261-3262]:
   - Taking all these as limbs of mandala accomplishment
   - Aspiring to buddhahood through five or six activities

3. **Supreme mandala** (*dkyil 'khor rgyal mchog*) [3263-3264]:
   - From earth ritual (*sa'i cho ga*) through empowerment (*dbang bskur ba*)
   - Accomplishing single individual as Buddha

[3265-3277] [CONCEPT] Samadhi-Focused Yoga Tantra: Five Enlightenments
**Analysis:** The samadhi-focused approach (*ting nge 'dzin gtso bo*) uses:

**Two Types of Samadhi:**
1. *sbyor ba dang po'i ting nge 'dzin* — First application samadhi
2. *yongs su dag pa'i ting nge 'dzin* — Completely pure samadhi

**Five Enlightenments (*mngon par byang chub pa lnga*):**

1. **Enlightenment through seat** (*gdan gyi sgo nas*) [3271]:
   - Sun and moon seat (*nyi ma dang zla ba*)
   - Method and prajna manifestly awakened
   - Stacked on lotus (*padma'i steng du brtsegs mar*)

2. **Enlightenment through body** (*sku yi sgo nas*) [3272]:
   - Complete body with ornaments (*rgyan cha'i sgo nas*)
   - Purification of sense-bases (*skye mched rnam par dag pa*)

3. **Enlightenment through speech** (*gsung yi sgo nas*) [3273]:
   - Letters A and KA (*a li ka li*) wheel
   - Sounds, words, names manifestly awakened

4. **Enlightenment through mind** (*thugs phyag mtshan*) [3274-3275]:
   - Vajra, wheel, jewel, etc. (*rdo rje dang 'khor lo dang rin po che*)
   - Individual family buddhas

5. **Enlightenment through wisdom-being** (*ye shes sems dpa'i sgo nas*) [3276]:
   - Pure dharmatā (*chos nyid rnam par dag pa*)

These five correspond to the five Buddha families and purify the five aggregates, elements, and sense-bases.
