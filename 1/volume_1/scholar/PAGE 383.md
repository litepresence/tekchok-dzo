## [STRUCTURE]

**Text Architecture:**
- **Lines 1-2**: Fragmentary continuation from preceding page
  - Incomplete sentence structure indicating textual damage or copying irregularity
  - Begins with isolated **"སྡེ"** (sde) - likely section marker

**Notable Features:**
- Extremely short page (2 lines Tibetan, 3 lines Wylie)
- Appears to be transition or damaged section
- Line 3 in Wylie shows empty line marker

## [PHILOLOGY]

**Particle Analysis:**
| Line | Tibetan | Wylie | Function |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| 00001 | སྡེ | sde | Section header? Cataloging notation? |
| 00002 | ལས། | las/ | Ablative (cut off) |

**Fragmentary Terminology:**
- **Las rlung** (line 1): Karmic wind - continuation from previous discussion
- **Ye shes kyi rlung** (line 1): Wisdom wind - paired with karmic wind
- **Khams rgyang zhags** (line 2): Elemental distant-snare - broken compound
- **Dge** (line 3): Virtue - isolated virtue marker (likely marginal notation)

**Orthographic Notes:**
- Tibetan line 2 shows space after "རྒྱང་ཞགས་" suggesting incomplete word
- Line 00002 Wylie: "rgyang zhags" ends with space, no final particle
- Line 00003: "dge" - isolated syllable, possibly virtue classification marker

## [CONTEXT]

**Textual Integrity Issues:**
This page represents either:
1. **Physical damage**: Lost folio or damaged manuscript source
2. **Copying irregularity**: Scribal omission
3. **Intentional abbreviation**: Section marker without content

**Content Continuity:**
- Presumably continues explanation of rgyang zhags from page 382
- Reference to "las rlung dag cing" (purified karmic wind) connects to previous discussion of ye shes kyi rlung
- "Khams rgyang zhags" suggests elemental aspect of distant-snare lamp

**Manuscript Features:**
- **"སྡེ"** (sde): May indicate:
  - Chapter/section division marker
  - Cataloging notation (sde tshan)
  - Correction marker
- **"དགེ"** (dge): Virtue marker - commonly placed at section ends

## [CONCEPT]

**Fragmentary Doctrine:**
The incomplete lines suggest discussion of:

**Wind Classification ( rlung gi dbye ba):**
- Las rlung (karmic wind) → to be purified (dag)
- Ye shes kyi rlung (wisdom wind) → active agent

**Elemental Aspect:**
- Khams rgyang zhags: The "elemental distant-snare"
- Connection to 'byung bzhi (four elements) discussed on page 382

**Editorial Note:**
The brevity of this page suggests either:
1. Missing content requiring collation with other editions
2. Transition page with intentional minimal content
3. Copying error in the source manuscript
