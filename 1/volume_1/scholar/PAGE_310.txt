[12841-12876] [STRUCTURE] Fifth Instruction: The Thief Metaphor and Five Poisons
This section presents the conclusion of the fifth reversal instruction (bzlog tshul lnga pa) on "the thief and five poisons" (rkun mo dug lnga). The structure: (1) thief metaphor summary (12841-12847) - five poisons as the thief, self-liberation cutting delusion's root; (2) the fire deity (me lha) instruction (12850-12867) - wisdom of self-recognition arising, finding self-arisen wisdom jewel; (3) transition to sixth instruction (12868-12876) - taming realms (yul 'dul ba), introducing the Li Garta (li gar ta) narrative of the Chinese king testing twenty-one queens. The thief metaphor establishes: through self-recognition, co-emergent ignorance with five poisons self-liberates, five poisons recognized as self-arisen self-display without abandonment.

[12841-12876] [CONCEPT] Self-Liberation Without Abandonment and the Five Poisons
The philosophical framework: (1) Five poisons (dug lnga) arise spontaneously (rang 'khrungs) as self-display (rang la 'char) - not to be suppressed but recognized; (2) Through "looking inward at own-face" (kha nang du rang ngo la bltas pas), co-emergent ignorance self-liberates (rang grol) without abandonment (ma spangs) - "pure in own-place" (gnas su dag); (3) Fire deity metaphor: wisdom of self-recognition (rang ngo shes pa'i ye shes) arises like fire, old woman of ignorance killed (rgan mo sod), yet "not even hair's breadth changed" (spu tsam yang ma song) - non-dual transformation without transformation; (4) Five poisons self-arisen (rang 'khrungs), appearing to self (rang la 'char), recognized through self-looking (rang ngo la bltas pas) - reflexive structure of self-liberation; (5) Self-arisen wisdom jewel (rang byung ye shes kyi nor bu) found within self (rang las rnyed pa); (6) Transition to symbolic narratives: Li Garta's twenty-one queens represent twenty-one introductions for recognizing clear light in bardo.
