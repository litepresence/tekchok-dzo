[00001-00037] [CONTEXT] Typologies of Awareness (rig pa): Doxographical Classification

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage initiates a systematic classification of awareness (rig pa), dividing it into two fundamental categories: gzhi 'dzin pa'i rig pa (basis-holding awareness) and mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i rig pa (characteristic-holding awareness). The architectural structure follows classical Indian pramāṇa (tshad ma) organizational patterns while incorporating rdzogs chen epistemology. The section culminates in a fifteen-fold typology of awareness derived from the *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Terminological precision: rig pa (awareness/cognition; Skt. vidyā/jñāna), gzhi (basis/ground), mtshan nyid (characteristic/lakṣaṇa), dngos rang byung (self-arisen entity). The compound "nyi zla kha sbyor" (Sun-Moon Mouth-Joining) refers to the *Nyi zla kha sbyor gyi rgyud*, a key Anuyoga/Atiyoga tantra. The term "rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma" (Distant-Cast Water Lamp) indicates a specific meditative technique. The fifteen similes (seng ge/lion, glang po che/elephant, mkha' lding khyung/garuda, etc.) derive from standard Indian literary conventions adapted to tantric contexts.

- **[CONTEXT]** The doxographical framework positions this text within the Nyingma "nine vehicles" (theg pa dgu) schema. The distinction between gzhi 'dzin and mtshan nyid 'dzin reflects debates in Indian and Tibetan epistemology regarding the relationship between perception and conception. The fifteen types of awareness listed constitute a rdzogs chen typology distinct from standard pramāṇa categories, emphasizing qualities of awareness (unsuppressed, distinctive, vast, doubt-free, etc.) rather than cognitive functions. The citation from *Rang shar* places this within the "esoteric instruction class" (man ngag sde) of Great Perfection teachings.

- **[CONCEPT]** The passage presents a sophisticated epistemology wherein awareness operates at two levels: (1) as self-arisen pristine cognition (ye shes) manifesting as radiance (gdangs) in the form of vajra-intertwined (rdo rje lu gu rgyud) appearances, and (2) as the nature of the five pristine cognitions (ye shes lnga) pervading saṃsāra and nirvāṇa without addition or subtraction. The fifteen awareness-typologies function as phenomenological descriptors of meditative experience rather than logical categories. The "vajra-intertwined" (rdo rje lu gu rgyud) represents a key rdzogs chen symbol indicating the inseparability of appearances and emptiness.

- **[VARIANT]** No manuscript variants attested in available editions.
