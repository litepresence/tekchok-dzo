[1677] [PHILOLOGY] The Fifth Aggregate: Consciousness
**Analysis:**

The consciousness aggregate (*rnam par shes pa'i phung po*) is defined as: *rig cing yul du byed pa* — "knowing and functioning with objects."

**Particle Breakdown:**
- *rig cing* — knowing-and (continuative gerundive)
- *yul du byed pa* — making-into-object (transformative)

This dual function—apprehension (*rig*) and objectification (*yul du byed*)—captures the essential operation of consciousness: simultaneously cognizing and constructing its referents.

[1678-1684] [CONCEPT] The Thought-Free Aggregates
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa presents the *rtog pa med pa'i phung po* (aggregates without thought) as the enlightened counterparts to the five contaminated aggregates. These are the aggregates of noble beings (*'phags pa*) who have transcended the world.

**The Five Pure Aggregates:**

1. **Concentration Aggregate (*ting nge 'dzin gyi phung po*)**
   - *zhi gnas dang lhag mthong gi rang bzhin* — nature of calm-abiding and insight
   - These are the twin wings of Buddhist meditation, here elevated to the aggregate level

2. **Wisdom Aggregate (*ye shes kyi phung po*)**
   - *rang rang gi nyon mongs pa las grol ba* — liberated from individual afflictions
   - Each of the five wisdoms liberates its corresponding affliction

3. **Wisdom Aggregate (*shes rab kyi phung po*)**
   - *rang dang spyi'i rang bzhin gzigs pa* — seeing the nature of particular and universal
   - Epistemological precision: *shes rab* (discriminating wisdom) cognizes both *rang mtshan* (specific characteristics) and *spyi mtshan* (general characteristics)

4. **Discipline Aggregate (*tshul khrims kyi phung po*)**
   - *dri ma'i phyogs las rnam par dag pa* — completely pure from the direction of stains
   - *Phyogs las* indicates directional transcendence—freedom from the entire dimension of defilement

5. **Complete Liberation Aggregate (*rnam par grol ba'i phung po*)**
   - *spros pa dang rtog pa las grol ba* — liberated from elaboration and thought
   - The culmination: freedom from both conceptual proliferation (*spros pa*) and discursive thinking (*rtog pa*)

[1685-1688] [CONTEXT] The Training Path vs. Non-Training
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa introduces a crucial distinction between:
- *slob lam gyis bsdus pa* — gathered by the training path
- *mi slob pa'i dus* — the time when one is not training

**Technical Point:** The aggregates on the training path are still "moistened" (*brlan pa*) by the aspect of what is to be abandoned (*spang bya'i phyogs*). Only at the non-training stage (*mi slob pa*) do they become fully pure.

**Ultimate Liberation:** When completely liberated (*gcig tu grol ba'i tshe*), even the name "aggregate" does not remain. This references *phung po dag las shin tu rnam par 'grol ba* — "completely liberated from aggregates" — from the *Angulimala Sutra* tradition.

[1689-1703] [STRUCTURE] The Sun-Moon-Union Classification
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa cites the *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon-Union Tantra) to provide a tantric framework for understanding the aggregates:

**Two-fold Classification:**
1. *rtog pas sbags pa'i phung po* — Aggregates obscured by thought
2. *rtog pa rnams rang bzhin gyis med pa'i phung po* — Aggregates naturally free from thought

**Obscured Aggregates (*rtog pas sbags pa*):**
The five contaminated aggregates arise from gathering (*'dus pa*):
- Form: from gathering all objects
- Feeling: from gathering all experiences
- Perception: from gathering all sense-holdings
- Formations: from gathering subtle afflictions
- Consciousness: from gathering all knowings

**Thought-Free Aggregates (*mi rtog pa'i phung po*):**
- Concentration: from gathering all concentrations
- Wisdom (liberation): since awareness itself is exhausted of outflows (*rig pa nyid zag pa zad pa*)
- Wisdom (discriminating): since that meaning appears without birth (*skye med*)
