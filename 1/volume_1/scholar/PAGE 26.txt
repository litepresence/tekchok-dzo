[916-918] [STRUCTURE] # Transition to the Six Realms (ṣaḍgatī)
**Analysis:** Having established the five perfections of the Buddha's appearance in our world-system, Longchenpa transitions to describing the cosmological framework within which sentient beings arise. This section delineates the six realms of saṃsāric existence.

**Architectural Logic:** The progression follows traditional abhidharmic structure: field (cosmos) → beings (content). The six realms are bifurcated into:
- Lower realms (*ngan song*): hells, pretas, animals
- Higher realms (*mtho ris*): demigods, gods, humans

This binary division reflects the fundamental saṃsāric dichotomy between severe suffering and relative pleasure.

[919-922] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of Hell Realm Terminology
**Analysis:**
- *dmyal ba* (hell): From root meaning "torture, affliction." The eight hot hells (*tsha dmyal brgyad*) are enumerated from Yama-soothed (*yang sos*) upward in intensity.
- *chu bur can* (bubble-possessing): Refers to hells where beings blister like bubbles in extreme cold.
- *nyi tshe ba* (occasional): From *nyi* (sun/day) + *tshe* (life), implying transient, intermittent manifestation.
- *nye 'khor ba* (neighboring): The sixteen neighboring hells surrounding the eight major hot and cold hells.

**Grammar Note:** *dpag tshad nyi khri nyi khri* (twenty-thousand twenty-thousand leagues) uses reduplication for emphasis, indicating vast depth rather than precise measurement.

[923-926] [CONTEXT] The Preta and Animal Realms in Buddhist Cosmology
**Analysis:**

**Preta Realm (*yi dwags*):**
- Etymology: From Sanskrit *preta*, "departed one, ghost"
- Location: 500 leagues below Rājagṛha (*rgyal po'i khab*), with "branches" (*yan lag*) interpenetrating the human realm
- Classical description: Beings with needle-thin throats and mountain-sized bellies, perpetually tormented by hunger and thirst

**Animal Realm (*dud 'gro*):**
- Primary habitat: Great oceans (*rgya mtsho chen po*)
- Dispersed manifestation: Scattered throughout human/god realms
- Doxographical note: In Yogācāra systems, animals represent delusion (*gti mug*), one of the three poisons.

[927-928] [CONCEPT] The Asura and Deva Realms
**Analysis:**

**Demigods (*lha ma yin* / Asura):**
- Location: Below Mount Meru's water-line (*chu mtshams*), in hollow space (*khong gseng*)
- Psychological correlate: Jealousy (*phrag dog*), resentment of the gods' privileges
- Cosmological function: The "in-between" realm, neither fully divine nor fully bound

**Gods (*lha* / Deva):**
- Location: Above Mount Meru's tiers (*bang rim*), ascending hierarchically
- Twenty-seven levels in standard Buddhist cosmology, from Four Great Kings up to Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception

[929-935] [CONTEXT] The Four Great Kings and Their Domains
**Analysis:**

**Cosmographic Structure:**
Seven concentric mountain rings (*ri bdun*) surround Mount Meru, containing:
- Cities (*grong*) and pleasure-groves (*skyed mos tshal*) of the Four Great Kings (*rgyal chen bzhi*)
- The thirty-three gods (*sum cu rtsa gsum*) on Meru's summit

**Seven Great Yakshas (*gnod sbyin chen po bdun*):**
1. *gser rkang* (Golden-foot) - Associated with wealth and earth
2. *stobs ldan* (Powerful) - Martial protection
3. *'jug srid* (Entering-existence) - Birth and incarnation
4. *grags pa'i dpal* (Glory of Fame) - Reputation and recognition
5. *ri 'degs* (Mountain-raising) - Geological stability
6. *mchog srid* (Supreme-existence) - Sovereignty and rule

These yakshas embody the forces that govern worldly fortune and misfortune.

[936-940] [CONCEPT] The Karmic Function of Guardian Deities
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa describes these yakshas as actively sending (*gtong*) the four calamities:
1. Human disease (*mi nad*)
2. Animal disease (*phyugs nad*)
3. Weapons/war (*mtshon*)
4. Famine (*mu ge*)

**Doxographical Note:** This reflects the Indian medical-cosmological system where disease arises from elemental (*'byung ba*) imbalance, often personified as spirit-deities.

The seven "paralyzing mother-goddesses" (*rengs byed kyi ma mo bdun*) function as karmic administrators, controlling (*dbang byed*) specific actions. This connects to the larger Buddhist framework of dharmapalas and lokapalas who manage the ripening of karma.

[941-952] [CONTEXT] The Eight Naga Kings and Elemental Cosmology
**Analysis:**

**The Eight Great Nagas (*klu'i rgyal po brgyad*):**
1. *dga' bo* (Joyful / Nanda)
2. *nye dga'* (Near-joyful / Upananda)
3. *rta'i gzhi* (Horse-basis / Takṣaka)
4. *btang bzung* (Releasing-holding / Vāsuki)
5. *gzi can* (Possessing-splendor / Karkoṭa)
6. *yul 'khor srung* (Land-guarding / Padma)
7. *nag po chen po* (Great Black / Mahāpadma)
8. *e la'i 'dab* (E la leaves / Śaṅkhapāla)

**Function:** These naga-kings control precipitation (*char che ba dang chung ba*) in Jambudvīpa, embodying the hydraulic cycle essential to agriculture and life.

**Philological Note:** *las nye bar ston par byed* — "make showing near the action" — indicates their role as immediate (*nye bar*) karmic instruments rather than primary causes.

[953-954] [STRUCTURE] The Yakṣa Guardians of the Cardinal Directions
**Analysis:**

At the four corners (*grwa bzhi*) of Meru's base tier reside the "raising-time yakshas" (*'degs dus kyi gnod sbyin*) — four extremely powerful (*rab tu stobs dang ldan pa*) guardians.

**Architectural Significance:** This completes the cosmological enumeration, establishing the full mandala-structure of our world-system before Longchenpa proceeds to analyze how sentient beings arise and evolve within this framework.

**Transition:** Having established the container (*snod*) — the cosmic environment — the text will now turn to the contained (*bcud*) — the sentient beings who inhabit these realms.
