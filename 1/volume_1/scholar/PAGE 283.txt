[11782-11818] [STRUCTURE] Condition-Dependent Division of Defect and Quality
The text transitions to the second major division (gnyis pa): analyzing how conditions (rkyen) determine whether manifestations appear as defects (skyon) or qualities (yon tan). The structure presents: (1) the camphor analogy (ga bur) establishing that appearance-neutral basis-qualities remain unaffected by conditional imputation, (2) the perspective-dependent nature of manifestation in lhundrub, (3) the fourfold analysis of delusion and liberation through lhundrub's manifestation modes, (4) the transformation of defects into qualities through recognition (rang ngo shes). The passage culminates in the assertion that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are non-dual in Buddha-hood.

[11782-11818] [PHILOLOGY] Conditional and Comparative Particles
The section marker gnyis pa rkyen gyis skyon yon gyi char dbye ba ni employs the genitive particle gyis to indicate agency of conditions. The comparative particle bzhin du (like/as) establishes analogical reasoning throughout. The phrase grol rkyen du snang bas (appearing as a condition for liberation) uses the terminative particle du to indicate functional transformation. The term zang thal lo (directly penetrating/spontaneously present) functions as an emphatic predicate. The compound bdag med stong pa (selfless emptiness) presents the philosophical ground for defect-quality transformation. The phrase 'khrul pa ldog tshul (manner of reversing delusion) employs nominalization through tshul.

[11782-11818] [CONTEXT] Medical and Alchemical Analogies
The camphor (ga bur) analogy derives from Tibetan medical theory where the same substance treats heat disorders but aggravates cold disorders, illustrating that the basis (substance) remains unchanged while conditions determine effect. This parallels the alchemical concept of transmutation in Vajrayāna. The phrase bar chad dngos grub tu gyur (obstacles become spiritual attainments) references the transmutation teachings of the Nyingma tradition, particularly the Chöd (gcod) and Lamdre (lam 'bras) lineages. The reference to buddha-hood ('khor 'das gnyis med du bud+d+ha'o) employs the Sanskrit term, indicating Indian textual authority.

[11782-11818] [CONCEPT] Non-dual Defect-Quality Transformation
The conceptual framework establishes that defects (skyon) and qualities (yon tan) are not inherent properties of the basis or its manifestations but are imputed (btags) by the perceiving subject. From the perspective of delusion's entry ('khrul pa 'jug tshul), afflictions (nyon mongs) appear as defects; from the perspective of delusion's reversal ('khrul pa ldog tshul), these same appearances manifest as wisdom (ye shes). The four modes of this transformation include: (1) the self-liberation of defects through lhundrub's power of simultaneous desire and delusion-reversal, (2) the natural settling (rang gzhag) without fabrication (ma bcos) that reveals selflessness as quality, (3) the coalescence of extremes into the middle that liberates conceptual extremes, (4) the transformation of impure saṃsāra into pure wisdom through non-distraction. This framework establishes the Dzogchen principle that nothing needs to be abandoned (spang) or accepted (blang).
