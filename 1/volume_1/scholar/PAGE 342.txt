[14003-14034] [STRUCTURE] Ro Ma: Method Channel
The text presents ro ma as the channel of method (thabs) with great desire. The structure establishes: (1) ro ma as the right channel in males, left in females, (2) ro ma as supporting saṃbhogakāya when pure, and (3) the five classes of women based on channel types.

[14003-14034] [PHILOLOGY] Desire Channel Terminology
The term ro ma (taste channel) derives from tasting all tastes like salt. The compound 'dod chags (desire/attachment) identifies the primary mental factor. The phrase rigs can lnga (five classes/types) establishes categorical distinctions.

[14003-14034] [CONTEXT] Gender and Channels
The text presents gender-specific channel configurations. Ro ma is right in males, left in females, reflecting complementary energetic patterns. This reflects tantric understanding of gender as energetic rather than merely biological.

[14003-14034] [CONCEPT] Desire as Path
The text conceptualizes desire ('dod chags) as the path when properly channeled. Ro ma carries the essence of desire; when purified, this becomes the wisdom of discernment. The same energy that produces saṃsāra produces nirvāṇa when recognized.
