[00001-00059] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Characteristics and the Sixteen Similes

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage provides detailed temporal characteristics (dus tshad nges pa) of wisdom manifestation and initiates the sixteen similes ('dra gzhi bcu drug) distinguishing dharma from non-dharma. The organization: (1) temporal phases of appearance, (2) dissolution of five elements, (3) introduction to simile-based distinctions, (4) first six similes (head/horn, water/drawing, water/bubble, gold/copper, ocean/boat, sleeping/waking). The structure integrates phenomenology with didactic analogy.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: snang ba dum bu dum bu'i tshe (when appearances are fragmented), shin tu phra (very subtle), 'gyu ba (moving), 'phrig (flickering), zlum (round), 'khril (coiled), gtem (dissolving), mer (flaring), yang dag kun tu snang (perfect universal appearance), 'byung ba rnam lnga thim (dissolution of five elements), 'dra gzhi (simile-ground). The term "ma rtog sems can 'khrul pas rwa lta bu" (unrealized sentient beings are like horns) indicates that delusion is a superimposition on the basis.

- **[CONTEXT]** The *Yang de nyid las* citation provides the key verses for temporal determination: practitioners should examine appearances when they are fragmented, subtle, moving, flickering, round, coiled, dissolving, or flaring. This reflects the rdzogs chen emphasis on specific phases of meditative experience. The *Rang shar* citation introduces the simile system: Buddha and sentient beings are like head and horns—both arise from one basis (gcig las du mar byung). This reflects the doctrine of "one basis, two paths" (gzhi gcig lam gnyis).

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents sophisticated phenomenological analysis: appearances manifest through progressive phases (fragmented, subtle, moving, flickering, round, coiled, dissolving, flaring, perfect), each requiring specific meditative responses. When the five elements dissolve into the expanse and wisdom swirls, this marks the critical juncture. The simile system establishes ontological distinctions: (1) head/horn—Buddha/sentient beings both arise from one basis, (2) water/drawing—realization/delusion are condition-dependent, (3) water/bubble—mind cannot control awareness, (4) gold/copper—wisdom/mind are undifferentiable in nature but different in purity, (5) ocean/boat—dharmakāya/all-ground with path-manifestation, (6) sleep/wake—delusion/liberation differ only in sense-power clarity.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants noted.
