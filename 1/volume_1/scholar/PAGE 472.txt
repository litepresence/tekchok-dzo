[LINE 20145-20158] [STRUCTURE] Basis, Path, and Result: Threefold Sphere-Awareness
**Analysis:** Fourth topic: temporal determination (དུས་ཚད་ངེས་པ་) with threefold division — basis (གཞི་), path (ལམ་), result (འབྲས་བུ་). Each stage presents different configuration of sphere (དབྱིངས་) and awareness (རིག་པ་). Basis: five-light aggregate at heart = sphere; channel-residing vajra chain radiance = awareness. Citation from Seng ge rtsal rdzogs establishes three types: at basis, at path, at extreme/culmination. Basis sphere-awareness is twofold: sphere = dharmadhātu lamp; awareness = clear as vajra chain.

[LINE 20159-20174] [CONTEXT] Path and Result Configurations
**Analysis:** Path sphere-awareness: five-light periphery = sphere; five-body appearance within channels = awareness. Result sphere: cloudless sky-like original purity self-appearance; awareness: dissolving into sphere as mere arising-ground (འཆར་གཞི་ཙམ་). The three-stage structure represents transformations of the same sphere-awareness dyad. At result, awareness dissolves into sphere — this marks completion.

[LINE 20175-20202] [CONTEXT] Temporal Determination: Phases of Wisdom
**Analysis:** From Nor bu 'phra bkod: temporal phases of wisdom manifestation with specific meditative responses: (1) fragmented appearances — thoroughly investigate, (2) very subtle/moving — abide through familiarity, (3) flickering/subtle/moving — grasp through seeing, (4) round/subtle/coiled — firm absorption without distraction, (5) flash/flame/body appearance — grasp non-appearance, (6) perfect universal appearance — gather appearance, (7) no attachment/fixation — know grasping method. Then when wisdom stirs and five elements dissolve into expanse: non-attached wisdom arrives at appearance object; delusion-free appearance seen; explained as union of light-appearance.

[LINE 20145-20202] [CONCEPT] The Temporality of Visionary Experience
**Analysis:** The temporal determination (དུས་ཚད་) reveals Dzogchen as a sophisticated phenomenology of time-consciousness. The progressive phases — fragmented → subtle/moving → flickering → round/coiled → flash/flame → universal → non-attached → dissolution — chart a trajectory of intensification and refinement. This is not merely "what appears" but "how appearing happens" — the temporal structure of manifestation itself. The final "union of light-appearance" (འོད་སྣང་ཟུང་འཇུག་) indicates the nondual resolution where the appearing and the appearance are recognized as non-separate. The dissolution of five elements into expanse (འབྱུང་བ་རྣམ་ལྔ་ཐིམ་གྱུར་ཏེ་) marks the somatic completion of this process — the body itself dissolving into luminous space.
