[16898-16949] [STRUCTURE] # Measure, Abode, and Door of the Third Lamp
**Analysis:** Longchenpa continues the eleven-topic analysis with:
- Seventh topic: Measure (*tshad*)
- Eighth topic: Abode (*gnas*)
- Ninth topic: Door (*sgo*)

**Measure (16898-16902):** Through practice, from nose-tip to eyebrow-midpoint space, blue spreading five-color under-barrel appearances, mirror-like, portions, vision-pervading inner kaya arising—this is the measure.

[16902-16949] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *gsang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*:
The citation (lines 16903-16949) provides detailed measurements and correlations:
- Sphere and awareness gaze: unobstructed sky gaze
- Sphere's inside snake-noose placed, not separated
- Who sees thus equals Samantabhadra
- Bindu seen, gaze directed upward, appearance progresses
- Four finger-widths from upper space: separated from body
- All appearing broken-vessel-like: attain emanation excellence
- Whatever appears as seen object: likewise to masses
- Outer appearance ceased: sixteen moments
- Unripened bindu to kaya: six, ten, five—definitely longs sku
- Inner body exhausted reaching place: likewise fingers, etc.
- Here directed, elements naturally stopped
- Birth-entry distinction: all dharmas exhausted self-place
- Without grasping abides: emanation kaya
- This entering's force empowerment
- Who attains birth's self-power
- Appearance's own sound empty-sound
- Manifestly returns, appears as delusion
- Does all beings' benefit
- For awareness equal one
- Three-thousand great beings' transference
- Thus gradual and instantaneous body attainment
- All these exhausted measure liberation
- These all definite fruition
- Supreme ground great mandala attainment

This extensive citation establishes the precise correlations between visionary stages (*snang ba*) and resultant kayas (*sku*).

[16950-16982] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* and *rang shar*:
The measure is further elaborated through scriptural citation:
- Blue unchanging from appearance
- Five colors clear light
- This itself greatly clarifies
- Self front upper space
- Four finger-widths or body-height
- Transcending separation from body
- That becomes the measure

The *rang shar* citation (16960-16982) describes the arising and vision process:
- Appearance arising and self great wisdom examining
- Ye shes appearance kaya and ye shes directionless arising
- Arising manner thus:
  - First: merely mirror mandala
  - From that: appearance portions arise
  - From that: land-area arise
  - From that: sky-filling arise
  - Whatever appears light mandala
  - Arising, seeing form kaya time
  - All kaya mandalas from self-arise, self-emanate
  - Sky-filling appearances
  - Seeing dharmata not ceasing
  - Ye shes sky movement sign
  - Nature itself appearance
  - Essence itself kaya arising
  - Arising that itself self is
  - Buddha intent valid dharma
  - True thusness thus-gone
  - That shown as familiarization measure

[16983-17007] [PHILOLOGY] Abode (*gnas*) and Door (*sgo*):
- Ground's sphere: cit
- Path's sphere: *'bri gu ta* (bridge-channel)
- Fruition sphere: cloud-free sky

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (16988-17007) establishes:
- Eye without arising condition
- Abiding, self-awareness itself appears as snake-noose
- Cloud-free sky holding
- Self-knowing inner clear time
- Abides in cit's center
- Outer-projection cloud-free sky
- Eye consciousness pure
- Clarifying blazing five light rays
- Unchanging pervading manner
- Blue great self-resound abides
- This arises from eye
- Unchanging pervading manner appears
- This appearance self-pure
- Sphere and awareness union
- Primordially abides, resting meditation
- Self-arising self activity-field

**Summary:** Page 403 completes the measure, abode, and door topics of the third lamp. The extensive scriptural citations from *gsang ba spyod pa*, *sgron ma 'bar ba*, and *rang shar* provide authoritative correlations between visionary measurements and resultant states.
