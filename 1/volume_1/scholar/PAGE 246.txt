[9990-10015] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Outer Speech Samaya Structure
**Analysis:** The text initiates the detailed enumeration of speech samaya (gsung gi dam tshig) through a threefold outer-inner-secret classification. Line 9990 establishes the first subdivision: "dang po phyi'i phyi"—the outer dimension of outer speech, specifically the abandonment of falsehood (rdzun spong ba). Lines 9991-10014 present an extended citation from the 'Khor lo brtsegs pa'i rgyud (Wheel of Stack Tantra), employing a characteristic seven-line verse structure interspersed with shad markers indicating metrical composition. Line 10015 transitions to the second subdivision with the structural marker "gsung gi phyi'i nang gi"—the inner dimension of outer speech, addressing divisive speech (phra ma). This architectural pattern of nested tripartite divisions reflects the sophisticated taxonomic methodology characteristic of the mdzod genre, where each category ramifies into three subcategories, each of which further divides into three.

[9991-9993] [PHILOLOGY] Tantric Citation Formula
**Analysis:** The citation employs the standard tantric attribution formula "[source] las" (from [source]), here introducing the 'Khor lo brtsegs pa'i rgyud. The term "sngags kyi mos pa spyod pa" (one who practices mantra belief/practice) identifies the subject through the instrumental particle kyis, indicating agency. The particle yis/yas in line 9992 marks the agent of the subsequent verbal action. The verse employs the ornamental particle yang (even/also) at line 9993, a common feature of Tibetan poetics (snyan ngag) serving both metrical and rhetorical functions. The citation marker ces so at line 10015 properly closes the quotation, maintaining the integrity of the tantric citation framework essential for doctrinal authority.

[9993-10014] [CONTEXT] Consequences of False Speech in Tantric Systems
**Analysis:** The cited passage enumerates the specific karmic consequences for practitioners who engage in falsehood while maintaining mantra practice. Lines 9996-9997 describe the immediate spiritual consequences: diminished mantra power (sngags bzlas nus pa mi 'byung) and loss of dignity (btsun pa min). Lines 9998-10003 trace the extended trajectory of retribution through subsequent rebirths—first as a leprous being (rme ka'i lus) in northern regions (byang gi phyogs), followed by manifold lower realm sufferings (ngan song sdug bsngal sna tshogs). This reflects the standard tantric penitential framework where samaya violations produce specific, graduated consequences mapped onto the cosmological geography of Buddhist samsara. The passage demonstrates the integration of standard Indian Buddhist karmic theory with specifically tantric commitments.

[10005-10026] [CONCEPT] Divisive Speech as Samaya Violation
**Analysis:** The text conceptualizes phra ma (divisive speech) as the second of the three outer speech violations. The analysis distinguishes between the content of speech (what is said) and the relational damage it causes. Lines 10019-10025 enumerate specific consequences: disintegration of spiritual communities (chos smras 'khor rnams mi 'du), misfortune in endeavors (ci byas log par 'gyur), enemies from non-enemies (ma spyad pa yang dgrar 'gyur), physical harm (lus la mtshon gyis 'debs), rebirth as an anguished being (sder can lus), and subsequent progression through lower realms (ngan song rim gyis myong). This graduated enumeration demonstrates how speech violations ripple outward through social, practical, and cosmological domains. The concept reflects the Buddhist understanding of speech as karmically potent action (las) rather than mere communication.

[10016-10024] [CONCEPT] Harsh Speech as Destructive Force
**Analysis:** The third outer violation, zhe gcod (harsh speech/cutting words), is introduced at line 10016 with the same structural formula: "phyi'i gsang ba gzhan gyi zhe gcod pa spong ba ste" (abandoning harsh speech toward others as outer secret). The citation from the same tantra emphasizes continuity in view (snga ma'i las) and future signs (phyi ma'i rtags) at line 10019, establishing harsh speech as having both retrospective and prospective karmic dimensions. Lines 10020-10023 trace the consequences: loss of loving-kindness toward beings (byams bral), hatred even from friends (bshes kyang sdang), destruction of dharma words (chos kyi tshig 'tshol), rebirth in proud body (rab tu dregs pa'i lus), and circling through the three lower realms (ngan song gsum du 'khor). The text conceptualizes harsh speech as severing the connective tissue of community, producing isolation as its primary consequence.

[10025-10051] [STRUCTURE] Inner and Secret Speech Samaya
**Analysis:** Lines 10025-10039 present the inner speech samaya (nang gi gsum) through a tripartite classification: outer speech (chos smra ba phyi), inner practice (bsgrub pa nang), and secret meditation (bsgom pa gsang ba). This threefold division applies the same architectural pattern to a deeper level of commitment, indicating that the same structural logic operates at increasingly subtle dimensions of practice. The citation from the Dam tshig rnam par bkod pa'i rgyud (Tantra of Samaya Arrangement) at line 10029 extends through line 10038, employing the same seven-line verse structure with ornamental shad markers. Lines 10040-10042 introduce the secret samaya (gsang ba'i gsum) with two further subdivisions: outer criticism of vajra siblings (rdo rje'i spun sring la smad pa) and inner criticism of the guru's consort and retinue (bla ma'i phyag rgya dang nye 'khor). This nested structure demonstrates the systematic comprehensiveness of the samaya framework, extending ethical commitment to the most intimate dimensions of tantric relationships.
