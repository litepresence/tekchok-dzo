[16035-16037] [CONTEXT] Continuation from Previous Page
**Analysis:** This page continues the discussion of the four lamps from the previous section. The line begins mid-sentence: from the purification of karmic wind (las rlung dag cing) and the wisdom-wind portion (ye shes kyi rlung gi cha las), the far-reaching water lamp (rgyang zhags) arises. The text appears to be continuing the explanation of how the lamps develop from the purified elements.

[16038-16042] [CONCEPT] Four Lamps Distinguished from Samsaric Delusion
**Analysis:** Lines 16038-16040 establish the critical distinction: the four lamps are different from samsaric deluded appearance and deluded mind ('khor ba'i 'khrul snang 'khrul sems dang tha dad) because they hold the portion of the transcended ('das pa'i cha 'dzin pa). Line 16041 emphasizes this is a crucial essential point (gnad 'di gal po che'o). Line 16042 states: "If in the future anyone knows the distinction between these two, know that they have realized my essential point."

[16043-16058] [CONCEPT] The Empty Bindu Lamp (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma)
**Analysis:** The empty bindu lamp is a round bindu with five-colored light-rims ('od lnga'i mu khyud can), arising from the purified karmic wind portion (las rlung dag pa'i cha las byung ba). From this arise the self-arisen wisdom lamp and the pure space lamp. Wisdom (shes rab) has three aspects: essence (ngo bo), capacity (rtsal), and tonality/resonance (gdangs). The essence is the inner awareness that is clear and self-luminous when applying the gaze-essential of the far-reaching [lamp] to the empty bindu lamp (rgyang zhags gzigs stangs kyi gnad las thig le stong pa'i sgron ma la gtad dus nang gi rig pa dngas sangs rang gsal du myong ba). The capacity is the outer-clear, swift, sharp wisdom of knowing objects (phyir gsal yul shes kyi shes rab rno ba myur ba). The tonality is the vajra chain appearance (rdo rje lu gu rgyud kyi snang ba) like spreading golden threads. If these three are not distinguished, there will be confusion (mgo rmongs par zad do).

[16059-16068] [CONCEPT] The Space Lamp (dbyings kyi sgron ma) - Outer and Inner
**Analysis:** The space lamp has outer and inner aspects. The outer is the first appearance of a blue light-essence (sngo ri ba) in the pure space center without clouds. The inner radiates from that as five-colored lights ('od lnga'i mdangs kha dog lngar gsal ba). A verse is quoted: "Space is outer and inner; outer holds to the cloudless sky; inner is the pure lamp-space." Line 16068 notes that some mistakenly identify the outer cloudless sky itself as the outer space.
