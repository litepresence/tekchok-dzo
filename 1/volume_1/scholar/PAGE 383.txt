[15741-15777] [STRUCTURE] Three Samayas of Body, Speech, and Mind
The text presents the three samayas of body, speech, and mind. The structure establishes: (1) body samaya as non-separation from mudrā, (2) speech samaya as non-separation from mantra, and (3) mind samaya as non-separation from wisdom.

[15741-15777] [PHILOLOGY] Three Samayas Terminology
The term sku'i dam tshig (body samaya) identifies the physical commitment. The compound gsung gi dam tshig (speech samaya) establishes the verbal commitment. The phrase thugs kyi dam tshig (mind samaya) identifies the mental commitment.

[15741-15777] [CONTEXT] Tantric Commitment Structure
The text presents the classical three samayas as understood in Dzogchen. They are not external rules but expressions of recognition. This reflects the integration of tantric structure with Dzogchen's emphasis on naturalness.

[15741-15777] [CONCEPT] Samayas as Continuity
The text conceptualizes the three samayas as continuity with enlightened dimensions. Body samaya is continuity with nirmāṇakāya; speech samaya is continuity with saṃbhogakāya; mind samaya is continuity with dharmakāya. They are not rules but recognitions.
