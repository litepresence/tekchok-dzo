[76-85] [STRUCTURE] # The Five Buddha Families
**Analysis:** Longchenpa introduces the *rigs lnga* (five families/buddhas) as the core structure of the Sambhogakāya maṇḍala. This section maps each family to its corresponding wisdom, element, direction, and symbolic attributes—a standard doxographical presentation found in *Guhyasamāja* and *Kālacakra* commentarial traditions.

[76-80] [CONCEPT] Family-Wisdom Correspondences
**Analysis:** The five families (*de bzhin gshegs pa'i rigs lnga*) are:

1. **Vairocana** (*rnam par snang mdzad*) - Center
   - Wisdom: *chos dbyings ye shes* (dharmadhātu)
   - Family: Tathāgata (*de bzhin gshegs pa*)
   - Color: White
   - Element: Space

2. **Akṣobhya** (*mi bskyod pa*) - East
   - Wisdom: *me long ye shes* (mirror-like)
   - Family: Vajra (*rdo rje*)
   - Color: Blue
   - Element: Water

3. **Ratnasambhava** (*rin chen 'byung gnas*) - South
   - Wisdom: *mnyam nyid ye shes* (equality)
   - Family: Ratna (*rin chen*)
   - Color: Yellow
   - Element: Earth

4. **Amitābha** (*snang ba mtha' yas*) - West
   - Wisdom: *sor rtog ye shes* (discriminating)
   - Family: Padma (*pad ma*)
   - Color: Red
   - Element: Fire

5. **Amoghasiddhi** (*don yod grub pa*) - North
   - Wisdom: *bya grub ye shes* (accomplishing)
   - Family: Karma (*las*)
   - Color: Green
   - Element: Air/Wind

[81-85] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *rigs* vs. *sku*
**Analysis:** Longchenpa uses *rigs* (family/lineage) rather than *sku* (body) to emphasize that these are aspects of a single dharmakāya, not separate entities. The particle *kyis* (instrumental) in *rigs kyis* indicates the families function as instruments (*tha shad*) of enlightened activity, not agents performing actions.

[86-95] [CONTEXT] # Sambhogakāya Activity Doctrine
**Analysis:** The description of enlightened activity (*'phrin las*) draws from the *Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra* and *Avalokiteśvara* cycle. Key features:
- **Effortless** (*rtsol med*) - Requires no deliberate intention
- **Uninterrupted** (*rgyun chad med*) - Continuous flow
- **All-pervading** (*khyab pa*) - Reaches all beings simultaneously

This reflects the Nyingma emphasis on spontaneous (*lhun grub*) functioning beyond conceptual effort.

[96-105] [CONCEPT] The Three Bodies as Methodology
**Analysis:** Lines 96-105 transition from doctrinal exposition to practical hermeneutics. The three kāyas are presented not merely as metaphysical categories but as:
- **Ground** (*gzhi*) - Dharmakāya as basis
- **Path** (*lam*) - Sambhogakāya as enjoyment/engagement
- **Result** ('*bras bu*) - Nirmāṇakāya as manifestation

This *gzhi lam 'bras bu* schema is the fundamental organizational principle of Nyingma *doxography* (*grub mtha'*).

[106-115] [STRUCTURE] # Transition to Nirmāṇakāya
**Analysis:** The text pivots from Sambhogakāya to Nirmāṇakāya (*sprul sku*) exposition. This transition follows the standard tantric sequence: ground (dharmakāya) → path (sambhogakāya) → result/activity (nirmāṇakāya).

[111-115] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *sprul pa'i sku*
**Analysis:** The term *sprul pa* (emanation/magical creation) derives from the root *sprul* (to emanate/project). Unlike *longs spyod* (enjoyment), which implies richness, *sprul* implies:
- **Appearing without intrinsic nature** (*rang bzhin med par snang ba*)
- **Manifesting for others' benefit** (*gzhan don du*)
- **Unimpeded display** (*thogs med kyi rol pa*)

This preserves the *māyā* (illusion) metaphor central to Mahāyāna soteriology.
