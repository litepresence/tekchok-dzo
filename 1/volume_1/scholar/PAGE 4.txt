[76-91] [CONTEXT] # The Five Family Mandala and Cosmological Symbolism
**Analysis:** This passage presents the elaborate maṇḍala architecture of the five buddha-families (*rigs lnga*), grounded in the visualization schema of the *Guhyasamāja* and *Kālacakra* tantric systems. The five symbols—mudrā (wheel), vajra, jewel, lotus, and cross (rgya gram)—correspond to the five skandhas purified into the five wisdom buddhas. The "twenty-five fields" (*zhing khams nyi shu rtsa lnga*) refers to the fivefold multiplication of five families, representing the complete maṇḍala structure.

The imagery of perfume-water flowing from pore-holes (*ba spu'i khung*) echoes the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*'s description of the cosmic body of Vairocana, where infinite worlds exist within each pore. This is not merely symbolic but reflects the Nyingma doctrine of *snang stong dbyer med*—the non-duality of appearance and emptiness.

[86-87] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *byin gyis brlabs* vs. *las kyi*
**Analysis:** The phrase pairs "buddha's blessing" (*sangs rgyas kyi byin gyis brlabs*) with "beings' karma" (*'gro ba'i las kyi*). The instrumental/ablative particle *gyis* in both cases indicates agency: Buddha-fields arise through/by the force of enlightened blessing, while ordinary realms arise through/by the force of sentient beings' karmic actions. This parallels the Yogācāra distinction between *pariṇispanna* (perfected) and *parikalpita* (imagined) natures.

[88-91] [STRUCTURE] # Enumeration of Field Configurations
**Analysis:** The text enumerates four field shapes—round (*zlum po*), four-cornered (*gru bzhi pa*), crescent (*nar mo*), and semi-circular (*zla gam*)—representing the spatial configurations of different Buddha-fields as described in texts like the *Bhadrakalpika Sūtra*. The phrase *bsam gyis mi khyab pa* (inconceivable/incommensurable) is a standard descriptor for the scope of Buddha-activity, indicating that these configurations transcend ordinary conceptual measurement.

[92-98] [CONCEPT] The Fivefold Pervasion Model
**Analysis:** Longchenpa employs a classic Buddhist cosmological schema: just as space pervades all, so do the five aspects of enlightenment—body (*sku*), speech (*gsung*), mind (*thugs*), qualities (*yon tan*), and activities (*'phrin las*). This pentadic structure derives from the *Ratnagotravibhāga* and became standardized in Nyingma doxography. The "perpetual continuous wheel" (*rtag pa rgyun gyi 'khor mo*) indicates the uninterrupted nature of enlightened activity without beginning or end.

[99-105] [STRUCTURE] # Introduction of the Threefold Field Classification
**Analysis:** The text introduces a critical structural division: Samantabhadra's training field (*gdul zhing*) and activities (*mdzad pa*) manifest as three different fields corresponding to the three kāyas. This establishes the hermeneutic framework that will govern the subsequent presentation: Dharmakāya-fields for the ultimate, Saṃbhogakāya-fields for the subtle, and Nirmāṇakāya-fields for the manifest.

[100-102] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Markers and Their Philosophical Implications
**Analysis:** The phrase *thog ma'i dus 'di tsam zhig nas byung* (from this first time only having arisen) uses the emphatic *tsam* (only/merely) to underscore that even the concept of a "first time" is conventional. The inability to measure with "years and eons" (*lo dang bskal pa*) multiplied by "field-particles like an ocean" (*zhing gi rdul rgya mtshos*) demonstrates the limits of temporal conceptualization when applied to the timeless (*thog ma med pa'i dus*).

[103-105] [CONTEXT] # The Unmoving Spontaneous Field
**Analysis:** The "great field-ocean of unmoving spontaneity" (*mi g.yo lhun grub chen po'i zhing khams rgya mtsho*) synthesizes two key Dzogchen concepts: *mi g.yo* (unmoving/unaltered) from the *Kālacakra* tradition's adama (unmoving) principle, and *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence) from the *Nyingthig* corpus. This field is described as possessing an "essence" (*snying po can*)—not a metaphysical essence, but the dynamic core from which all manifestation arises without effort.

[106-109] [CONCEPT] The Three Fields According to Kāya
**Analysis:** The text delineates three specific field names:

1. **Dharmakāya-time:** "Field of Luminous Vajra-Essence" (*'od gsal rdo rje snying po'i zhing khams*)—emphasizing the inseparability of luminosity (*'od gsal*) and emptiness (*rdo rje* = indestructible emptiness).

2. **Saṃbhogakāya-time:** "Field of Brahma's Drum-Sound" (*tshangs pa rnga sgra'i zhing khams*)—referencing the *Brahmaparipṛcchā* and the cosmological sound-vibration (*svara*) underlying all manifestation.

3. **Nirmāṇakāya-time:** "Field of Great Brahma's Eon" (*tshangs chen gyi bskal pa'i zhing khams*)—connecting to the cyclical cosmology (*kalpa*) of mainstream Buddhism while distinguishing it as "great" (*chen*) to indicate its supramundane nature.

[110-111] [PHILOLOGY] Agentive Structure of Emanation
**Analysis:** The phrase *kun tu bzang po nyid kyis sprul pa* uses the agentive particle *kyis* to identify Samantabhadra himself as the agent of emanation (*sprul pa*). This is theologically significant: in Nyingma doxography, Samantabhadra is Dharmakāya itself, which cannot directly "act" in the conventional sense. The resolution is that all Nirmāṇakāya buddhas are his emanations (*sprul sku*), acting through his blessing (*byin gyis brlabs pas*). The construction *des... sangs rgyas pa'i* indicates that teachers "become buddha" through this blessing—suggesting the non-dual relationship between ground, path, and fruition.
