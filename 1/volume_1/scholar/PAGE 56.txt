[1824-1836] [CONTEXT] The Sun-Moon-Union Analysis of Afflictions
**Analysis:**

The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon-Union Tantra) provides the scriptural authority for the six root afflictions. Each represents confusion (*'khrul pa*) arising from a specific dimension of experience:

**The Sixfold Structure:**

1. **Ignorance** (*ma rig pa*) — confusion from grasping the basis-of-confusion conceptually (*gzhis 'khrul rtog gi cha 'dzin pa*)
2. **Delusion** (*gti mug*) — confusion from the wisdom portion (*shes rab kyi cha las 'khrul pa*)
3. **Hatred** (*zhe sdang*) — confusion from the stage of generation (*skyed pa'i rim pa'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
4. **Pride** (*nga rgyal*) — confusion from the view portion (*lta ba'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
5. **Attachment** (*'dod chags*) — confusion from the appearance portion (*snang ba'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
6. **Jealousy** (*phrag dog*) — confusion from unmanifest effects (*ma rtogs pa'i las 'khrul pa*)

**Extended Analysis:** The afflictions function as:
- The mind grasping thoughts (*bsam pa rnam rjes su 'dzin pa'i sems*)
- Memory grasping recollections (*dran pa rnam rjes su 'dzin pa'i yid*)
- Concepts becoming the basis of habitual tendencies and doubt

[1837-1841] [STRUCTURE] The 84,000 Afflictions
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa presents the traditional enumeration: the conceptual masses (*rtog tshogs*) generate 84,000 (*brgyad khri bzhi stong*) afflictions.

**Distribution:**
- Attachment: 21,000
- Hatred: 21,000
- Delusion: 21,000
- Equal combination of all three: 21,000

This taxonomy derives from the *Abhidharmakosa* and reflects the standard Yogacara classification of defilements.

[1842-1863] [CONCEPT] The Rope-Snake Metaphor
**Analysis:**

The text presents the classic *thag pa sbrul 'dzin* (rope-snake grasping) metaphor from the *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl-Garland):

**The Simile Structure:**
1. A rope in dim light appears as a snake
2. The snake-appearance is "true" as appearance (*snang ba*)
3. The rope-reality is "correct" as ultimate (*don dam*)
4. Both are valid within their respective frames

**Application to Two Truths:**

```
The nature of the two truths:
Merely the conventional world
No relation to the ultimate
From the expanse of emptiness,
All aspects of that are liberated
```

**Philological Precision:**
- *de lta snang ba* — appearing thus (conventional appearance)
- *thag pa la ni sbrul mthong* — seeing snake where there is rope (conventional error)
- *de ma yin la der bzung* — grasping that which is not that (the fundamental error)

**Dzogchen Synthesis:** The aggregates are *sgyu ma sprul pa bzhin* — "like illusory emanations" — the same term used to describe the Buddha's display (*sprul pa*).

[1864] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Vehicle Analysis
**Analysis:**

The text completes the presentation of samsaric phenomena (*'khor ba'i chos*) and transitions to the vehicles (*theg pa*). Knowing these confused appearances (*'khrul snang*) leads to entry into the ultimate truth (*don dam pa'i bden pa*).
