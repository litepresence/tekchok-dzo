[17508-17547] [STRUCTURE] # Dharmakaya Expanded Explanation
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation of dharmakaya (*chos sku rgyas par bshad pa*) following the same fivefold structure:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*)
2. Definition (*nges tshig*)
3. Classification (*dbye ba*)

[17548-17602] [CONTEXT] Citations from *rang shar* and *de nyid*:
From *rang shar* (17549-17553):

[17568-17593] [CONCEPT] Ninefold Classification of Three Kayas:
Sometimes labeled ground-abiding ye shes, sometimes dharmakaya, sometimes liberation-basis—one essence different aspects spoken. Body and ye shes gathering-separation free intent known.

**Three kayas each with three subdivisions:**

**Dharmakaya (*chos sku*):**
1. Dharmakaya's dharmakaya: Rigpa itself; dharma appearing objects, body rigpa's essence unceased
2. Dharmakaya's longs sku: Five lights
3. Dharmakaya's sprul sku: Eye faculty seeing unceased

Dharmakaya's object: sky pure
Dharmakaya's abode: cit
Dharmakaya's path: jewel crystal cave possessing

**Longs sku (*longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku*):**
1. Longs sku's chos sku: Five ye shes appearance unceased clearly abiding
2. Longs sku's longs sku: Five bindus' path with
3. Longs sku's sprul sku: Five doors' knowing objects arising rigpa

Longs sku abode: *a wa dhūtī*
Longs sku path: small tip right

**Sprul sku (*sprul pa'i sku*):**
1. Sprul sku's chos sku: Two lamps
2. Sprul sku's longs sku: Seeing five lights
3. Sprul sku's sprul sku: Five afflictions arising self self-rigpa

Sprul sku abode: head
Sprul sku path: eye
Sprul sku object: delusion appearance

[17594-17643] [CONCEPT] Resolution of Apparent Contradiction:
Question: Dharmakaya without mind and afflictions; its classification longs sprul of three kayas, sprul sku's sprul sku two—five doors' knowing and afflictions called—contradiction?

Answer: No contradiction. Consciousness and afflictions' own time rigpa's self-resound possessing, that spoken; consciousness and afflictions actual sprul sku not.

**Summary:** Page 410 completes the expanded explanation of dharmakaya with its fivefold analysis and presents the complex ninefold classification of the three kayas (each kaya having three aspects). The resolution of the apparent contradiction between dharmakaya's purity and the three kayas' classification maintains rigpa's self-resound as the bridge.
