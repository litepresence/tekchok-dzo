[9766-9768] [STRUCTURE] # The Fourfold Guru Typology
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents a quadripartite classification (*dbye ba bzhi*) of spiritual teachers (*slob dpon*), establishing a graduated hierarchy of transmission roles. This typology maps onto the standard Nyingma *dbang lung khrid* (empowerment, transmission, instruction) triad with the addition of the "general" (*spyi*) category.

**The Four Teachers:**
1. **Dharma-Connection Teacher** (*rang nyid chos la sbyor ba 'dren pa'i slob dpon*)—The guru who initially introduces one to the Dharma path
2. **Samaya-Vow Empowerment Teacher** (*dam tshig dang sdom pa sbyin pa dbang gi slob dpon*)—The vajra master who bestows empowerments and commitments
3. **Instructional Reading Transmission Teacher** (*gdams ngag 'bogs pa lung gi slob dpon*)—The teacher who transmits esoteric instructions through formal reading authorization (*lung*)
4. **General Teacher** (*spyi*)—The foundational guide encompassing all aspects

The citation marker *de nyid las* (from that [text] itself) introduces scriptural authority for this classification.

[9770-9772] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of the Etymological Verses
**Analysis:** The versified etymology employs paronomasia (*sgra sbyor*) typical of tantric doxography:

- **Line 9770-9772:** *slob dpon la yang don bzhi ste*—"As for the teacher, moreover, [there are] four meanings"
  - *spyi* (general)
  - *'dren* (pull/guide)—from *dren pa* (to pull, guide, lead)
  - *dam tshig* (samaya)—the commitment bond
  - *dbang* (empowerment)—the initiatory transmission

The particle *yang* (also/moreover) indicates this enumeration supplements the previous categorization.

[9777-9778] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of "Teacher" (*slob dpon*)
**Analysis:** The text provides a Sanskrit-derived Tibetan etymology:

- **Line 9777:** *mi shes shes par 'grol phyir slob*—"Trains (*slob*) in order to liberate (*'grol*) not-knowing (*mi shes*) into knowing (*shes pa*)"
  - The ablative *phyir* indicates purpose/cause: training FOR liberation
  - *slob* = to train, study, practice (Skt. *śikṣā*)

- **Line 9778:** *rdzogs chen don la sbyor bas dpon*—"Teacher (*dpon*) through connecting (*sbyor*) to the Dzogchen meaning"
  - *sbyor ba* = application, connection, engagement
  - *dpon* = master, lord, chief (Skt. *upādhyāya*/*ācārya*)

The instrumental *bas* indicates agency: "through/by means of connecting."

[9779-9781] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of "Student" (*slob ma*)
**Analysis:**

- **Line 9780:** *ma yengs tshul gyis nyan pas slob*—"Trains through listening without distraction"
  - *ma yengs* = undistracted (negation of *yengs*—distraction)
  - *tshul gyis* = by manner/method (instrumental)
  - *nyan pas* = through hearing/listening (ablative of agency)

- **Line 9781:** *man ngag snod du gyur pas ma*—"Student (*ma*) through becoming a vessel (*snod*) for instructions"
  - *snod* = vessel, receptacle (Skt. *bhājana*)
  - This establishes the receptivity requirement: the student must be capable of receiving teachings

[9782-9784] [CONCEPT] The Proper Guru-Disciple Relationship
**Analysis:** Lines 9782-9784 establish the prerequisites for authentic transmission:

- **Line 9782:** *de ltar don ldan dpon slob ni*—"Such meaningful guru-disciple [relationship]"
  - *don ldan* = possessing meaning/substance (not merely formal)

- **Line 9783:** *yang dag sa la mnyam por gnas*—"Abides equally on the correct ground"
  - *yang dag* = correct, authentic, proper
  - *sa* = ground, level, stage (Skt. *bhūmi*)
  - *mnyam por gnas* = abiding equally (in the same view/understanding)

- **Line 9784:** *dam tshig ldan na de bzhin no*—"If possessing samaya, it is like that"
  - The conditional *na* establishes samaya as the necessary condition for the relationship's authenticity

[9786-9791] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Authority on Samaya Benefits
**Analysis:** The citation from *de nyid* (likely referring to a root tantra or commentary) establishes the soteriological efficacy of samaya:

- **Line 9788:** *dam tshig sdom pa ji bzhin gnas*—"Abiding in samaya-vow as-it-is"
  - *ji bzhin* = as-it-is, correctly, properly

- **Line 9790:** *bsam pa thams cad mthar phyin 'gyur*—"All intentions become fully completed"
  - *mthar phyin* = reaching the end, completion, perfection (Skt. *pāripūri*)

This establishes samaya observance as the sufficient condition for accomplishing all aims.

[9792-9796] [CONTEXT] *Māyājāla* Citation on Blessing
**Analysis:** The citation from *sgyu 'phrul* (Guhyamāyājāla-tantra) establishes the lineage transmission dynamic:

- **Line 9793:** *dam tshig mchog la gang gnas pa*—"One who abides in supreme samaya"
- **Line 9795:** *sras dang spun dgongs byin gyis rlob*—"Sons and siblings [receive] mind-blessing"
  - *sras* = spiritual sons (disciples)
  - *spun* = siblings (*mched grogs*—vajra siblings)
  - *dgongs* = intention/mind (Skt. *citta*)
  - *byin gyis rlob* = blessing (Skt. *adhiṣṭhāna*)

The instrumental *yis* (variant of *gyis*) indicates the means by which blessing occurs.

[9797-9819] [STRUCTURE] # The Three Samaya Categories and Their Violation
**Analysis:** The text transitions from benefits to consequences, establishing:
1. The three doors (*sgo gsum*) of samaya: Body, Speech, Mind
2. The graduated consequences of transgression
3. The distinction between teacher's and student's violations

[9798-9805] [CONTEXT] *Rang shar* Citation on Mutual Destruction
**Analysis:** The citation from *rang shar* (Self-Arisen) Tantra establishes:

- **Line 9799:** *nyams na gnyis ka 'tshig par 'gyur*—"If declined, both burn/are destroyed"
  - *nyams* = decline, degenerate, transgress
  - *'tshig* = burn, destroy, ruin (also: to be damned)

- **Line 9803:** *dpon gyis nyams na sbyang thabs med*—"If the teacher declines, there is no method of purification"
- **Line 9805:** *slob mas nyams na sbyang thabs yod*—"If the student declines, there is a method of purification"

This asymmetry reflects the tantric hierarchy: the teacher's violation is more severe and irreparable.

[9800-9802] [CONCEPT] Body Samaya Violation Consequences
**Analysis:**

- **Line 9800-9802:** Violation of body samaya (*sku yi dam tshig*) results in:
  1. *rdo rje dmyal ba chen por 'tshed*—Burning in great vajra hell
  2. *'o dod 'bod pa'i gnas su skye*—Birth in the "wailing-crying" realm

The term *rdo rje dmyal ba* (vajra hell) indicates the most severe torment reserved for those who break vajrayāna commitments.

[9806-9810] [CONCEPT] Speech Samaya Violation Consequences
**Analysis:**

- **Line 9806-9808:** Violation of speech samaya (*gsung gi dam tshig*) results in:
  1. *snang ba 'gags par 'gyur*—Cessation of appearances (sensory deprivation)
  2. *mun rdul chen po'i gnas su skye*—Birth in the "darkness-dust" realm

- **Line 9809-9810:** Even after emerging from that realm:
  *lkugs pa dag tu skye bar 'gyur*—Birth among mutes

This establishes a karmic continuity where speech-violation results in communicative impairment across lifetimes.

[9811-9818] [CONCEPT] Mind Samaya Violation Consequences
**Analysis:**

- **Line 9811-9814:** Violation of mind samaya (*thugs kyi dam tshig*) results in:
  1. *yid 'khrugs chen po'i gnas su skye*—Birth in the "great mind-disturbance" realm
  2. *rtag tu rtsod pa rgyun mi 'chad*—Unceasing continuum of quarreling
  3. *'thab dang sdug bsngal chen po*—Fighting and great suffering

- **Line 9815-9817:** Mental consequences:
  - *dran pa med par 'gyur*—Becoming without mindfulness
  - *dran pa rengs par 'gyur*—Mindfulness becoming dull/stiff
  - *smyo 'bog nad kyis thebs par 'gyur*—Being struck by madness-demon sickness

- **Line 9818:** Final result: *tha ma ngu 'bod gnas su skye*—Finally birth in the wailing-cry realm

The enumeration demonstrates the graduated severity: body-violation leads to hell, speech-violation to sensory deprivation, mind-violation to mental illness and interpersonal conflict.
