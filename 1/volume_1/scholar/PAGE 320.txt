[13329-13374] [STRUCTURE] Three Bodies (sku gsum) as Result
The text presents the three bodies (trikāya) as the complete result. The structure establishes: (1) dharmakāya as the empty essence of result, (2) sambhogakāya as the luminous nature of result, (3) nirmāṇakāya as the compassionate capacity of result, and (4) the three bodies as non-dual in one's own awareness.

[13329-13350] [PHILOLOGY] Three Bodies Terminology
The sku gsum (three bodies) appear with qualifiers: chos sku (dharmakāya, truth body), longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku (sambhogakāya, enjoyment body), sprul pa'i sku (nirmāṇakāya, emanation body). The phrase "rang rig pa'i ngang" (continuum of self-awareness) identifies the locus. The compound gsum gyi dbyer med (non-duality of the three) emphasizes unity.

[13351-13374] [CONTEXT] Trikāya Doctrinal Integration
The three bodies presentation integrates classical Buddhist trikāya doctrine with Dzogchen. By identifying the three bodies with awareness's dimensions (emptiness, luminosity, compassion), the text establishes Dzogchen result as continuous with Mahayana buddhology while distinctive in its immediacy.

[13329-13374] [CONCEPT] Three Bodies as Awareness Dimensions
The text conceptualizes the three bodies as dimensions of awareness, not external achievements. Dharmakāya is awareness's empty essence; sambhogakāya is its luminous nature; nirmāṇakāya is its responsive capacity. All three are present in awareness now, unrecognized. Result is the recognition that one's own awareness is the three bodies of all buddhas.
