[6020-6059] [STRUCTURE] Definitive Scriptures Section
**Analysis:** Lines 6020-6059 mark the transition to the third topic: definitive prophecy (*dam pa nges pa'i lung bstan*):

**Three Aspects:**
1. General presentation of teaching descent manner (*bstan pa'i babs lugs spyir bstan pa*)
2. Detailed explanation of flourishing and decline (*dar nub bye brag tu bshad pa*)
3. Presentation of person who holds it (*gang gis 'dzin pa'i gang zag bstan pa*)

**Teaching Descent [6031-6045]:**
First Samantabhadra arranged Brahma's great aeon (*tsangs chen gyi bskal pa*). From his blessing, Vajradhara manifested Buddha emanation, which again from Dharmakaya arose Sambhogakaya, arranging Brahma's aeon in Vairochana's etc. kayas. From various emanation bodies, taming beings' benefit:
- Dharmakaya's actual teaching: Dzogchen
- Sambhogakaya's teaching: Rangdrak
- Nirmanakaya's teaching: visible body benefit

**Three Supports [6038-6041]:**
From that blessing arisen:
- Vajra (*rdo rje*)
- Scripture (*gleg bam*)
- Image (*sku gzugs*)

Actual and reflected teachings held, Buddha's to beings' benefit spontaneously arisen.

**Timeline [6043-6059]:**
From first emanation's enlightenment aeon until this Jambudvipa not formed, to other Buddhafields emanation went, benefitting. Now in this Saha world, thousand visible Buddhas benefit — these three's blessing.

**Citation from *Thal 'gyur* [6046-6064]:**
"Secret definitive seventeen and teaching's vajra and magical letter together, first emanation body Buddhafield, teacher Samantabhadra held, thickly arrayed place.
Then Tushita place, Vairochana Rigpa, holding this ripened five Rigpa.
After that, I held, by holding teaching's life-tree supreme, thousand Buddhas and root two, certainly arise depending on this.

Miraculous birth, womb-born, heat and womb-born, ripen beings. From this taming teaching, twelve dharma-wheels arose. By this thirty-six deeds.

Depending on body, speech, mind, appeared to taming object beings."
