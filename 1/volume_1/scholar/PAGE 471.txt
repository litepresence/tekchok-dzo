[00001-00058] [CONTEXT] Basis-Path-Result: The Dynamics of Sphere and Awareness

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage establishes the threefold framework of basis, path, and result (gzhi lam 'bras bu) with respect to sphere (dbyings) and awareness (rig pa). The organization: (1) basis: heart-center five lights as sphere, channel-awareness as awareness, (2) path: five-light periphery as sphere, five-body appearance as awareness, (3) result: original purity as sphere, awareness dissolving into sphere as mere appearance-ground. The passage concludes with temporal determination of wisdom manifestation.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: gzhi lam 'bras gsum (basis, path, result), snying ga (heart), 'od lnga'i phung po (five-light aggregate), lu gu rgyud kyi gdangs 'od (vajra-intertwined radiance light), rtsa na gnas (residing in channels), ri pa na da'i nang du (inside the nāḍī of the channel), ka dag gi rang snang (self-appearance of original purity). The term "thim 'char gzhi" (dissolution-arising-ground) indicates the simultaneous nature of arising and dissolving in the result stage.

- **[CONTEXT]** The *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs* citation establishes three types of sphere-awareness: at the basis, at the path, and at the extreme/culmination. This reflects the standard Nyingma classification of spiritual experience. The *Yang de nyid las* (From That Itself) citation provides the key verse: "At the basis, sphere is the expanse lamp, awareness is the vajra-intertwined clear." The five bodies (sku lnga) correspond to the five Buddha bodies: nirmāṇa, saṃbhoga, dharma, vajra, and mahāsūkha.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents the architectonics of realization wherein basis, path, and result represent transformations of the same sphere-awareness dyad. At the basis: sphere is the five lights at the heart; awareness is the radiance residing in channels. At the path: sphere is the five-light periphery; awareness is the appearance of five bodies. At the result: sphere is original purity's self-appearance like a cloudless sky; awareness dissolves into sphere as mere appearance-ground. The crucial point (gnad) of sphere-awareness distinction is identified as supremely precious. The temporal determination (dus tshad) indicates that wisdom manifests when the five elements dissolve into the expanse—when the elements "melt" and wisdom "swirls" in the expanse.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants attested.
