[L1-10] [PHILOLOGY] The Five Families' Power and Channel Development
**Analysis:** The power of the five families (rigs can lnga'i nus pas) draws the father's consciousness inward (pha'i shes pa yang nang du 'dren pa). Separating from attachment to subsequent existence (rjes la zhen pa dang bral nas), it moves through the sky-path (skyug mer gyis 'gro). Because there exists a drawing-power of whatever family-class (rigs can gang yang rung ba'i 'dren byed), without contentment in bliss (bde ba la chog shes med pa), this arises from the cause-condition of desire (d'dod chags kyi rgyu rkyen las byung ba). Desire and attachment ('dod pa dang chags pa gnyis) are grasped as cause and condition (rgyu dang rkyen gnyis su bzung bas). Existence (srid pa) is held by the body's base-wind (lus kyi gzhi rlung gis 'dzin).

[L11-21] [CONCEPT] Non-Dual Cause-Condition and Great Bliss Result
**Analysis:** Through knowing that cause-condition are non-dual (rgyu rkyen gnyis gnyis su med par shes pas), in the result of bliss and great bliss (bde ba dang bde ba chen po'i 'bras bu), the result of body and wisdom (sku dang ye shes kyi 'bras bu) becomes integrated ('dril bar 'gyur). Thus, on one night from the mother's womb (ma'i mngal nas zhag gcig gi nub mo), the two cause-conditions of father and mother become one outer seal (pha ma'i rgyu rkyen gnyis phyi'i rgya gcig tu gyur nas), while internally not mixing (nang ma 'dres pa), abiding like a pea in a pod (sran ma'i ga'u ltar gnas pa). Through holding the child's wind-mind (bu'i rlung sems bzung nas gnas pas), the binding-seal of the four elements ('byung ba bzhi'i 'ching byed kyi rgya) binds with the four elements like a precious seal (rin po che'i spris dang 'dra bas bcings).

[L22-28] [CONTEXT] Nourishment and Life-Stability
**Analysis:** The text explains that at the time of body completion (lus rdzogs pa'i dus), without food of the throat (kham gyi zas), life does not remain (tshe mi gnas pa) - this arises from that binding. At that time, through the power of inner wind shooting upward (nang gi rlung 'phar ba'i stobs kyis gyen la 'phar), the mercury drop (dngul chu'i thigs pa) ascends like mercury drops moving upward (yar ba ltar phril phril gnas te). At the time of body completion (lus rdzogs pa'i dus), whatever sudden condition occurs to body-mind (lus sems la glo bur gyi rkyen ci byung yang), there is fear-trembling (sdangs yed) and body shaking (lus 'dar ba) - this arises from that key point (gnad de las byung ba).

[L29-37] [PHILOLOGY] Second Week Development
**Analysis:** Then on the second day (de nas zhag gnyis pa), through earth mixing as one (sas gcig tu bsres), pressing with weight (ljid kyis mnan pas), there is suffering like a mountain pressing on the child's crown (bu de'i spyi gtsug nas ris mnan pa tsam gyi sdug bsngal). At this time, the body's cause is grasped as merely ripening flesh (lus kyi rgyu sha tsam smin tsam du bzung), while the condition-channel is grasped as merely increasing water (rkyen rtsa tsam chu tsam du mched pas). From the non-duality of cause-condition of delusion (gti mug gi rgyu rkyen gnyis su med pa las), one is liberated into non-conceptual wisdom (mi rtog pa'i ye shes su grol). This is the key point of Great Perfection transcending acceptance-rejection (rdzogs pa chen po spang blang las 'das pa'i gnad).
