[17636-17643] [CONCEPT] Dharmakaya Function (*byed las*):
The essence ka dag's dharmakaya makes liberation basis; path time empty-clear dharmakaya's part makes liberating action; those three kayas make purifying and purification basis action.

[17644-17650] [CONTEXT] Dharmakaya Name-Entry Reason (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*):
- Primordially dust-free and stainless
- Abiding in state possessing but not recognizing
- Secret dharma existing
- Final meaning sought-after fruition existing dharma
- Therefore dharmakaya word spoken

[17644-17711] [STRUCTURE] # Second Topic: Mind (*sems*) and Wisdom (*ye shes*) Distinction
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the second major topic in two sections:
1. Essence brief presentation
2. Respective natures expanded explanation

Brief presentation from *mu tig phreng ba* (17649-17651):
- Mind and ye shes distinction
- Scholars should know

**Mind (*sems*) defined (17652-17654):**
Root ignorance coeminent possessing, stain with, samsara dharma self-deceiving, not ye shes's sun obscured, like cloud.

**Ye shes defined (17654-17655):**
Dharmakaya coeminent possessing, stainless, mind's memory-contemplation not abiding together, like sun.

From *de nyid* (17657-17664):
- Mind latencies all's basis
- Embodied stains is
- Grasped object holder mind
- Therefore samsara's dharmata

And:
- Ye shes memory basis itself free

From *klong drug pa* (17666-17667):
- Mind and ye shes own essence not distinguished
- Like sun cloud-mass obscured
- Outer appearance's objects cannot do

[17668-17711] [CONCEPT] Mind Detailed Analysis:
Mind is all action and afflictions and latencies' basis, source, maturation-maker, all-awakener, ignorance home always abiding, ye shes's sun contradicting, obscuring.

From *rang shar* (17672-17678):
- Mind latencies all gathering
- Mind afflictions all maturing
- Mind latencies all's basis is
- That latency also difficult to exhaust
- Self appearance obscuring
- Ignorance equally abiding

From *mu tig phreng ba* (17680-17684):
- Mind gathering arising
- Stain also with obscured
- Alaya-gathering mind etc.
- Stain number became

**Threefold mind structure (17699-17702):**
Mind appearing objects "this and this" signs, names, general holders; grasped object mind. That distinction investigating finely discerning, holder subject mind—two gathered.

"Grasped object holder mind" thus explained.

Scriptural support:
- *thun mong gi gzhung*: Mind ceased, that body manifestly did
- *tshigs gsal du*: Mind and mental factors' entering also continuum ceased
- *dkon mchog brtsegs pa*: Mind, yid, consciousness also free; samadhi abode not abandoning; this thus-gone's heart's secret unimaginable

---

**Summary:** Page 411 provides dharmakaya's function and name-entry reason, then inaugurates the mind-wisdom distinction. The analysis establishes mind as the stained, deluded basis of samsara, contrasted with ye shes as the unstained sun-like dharmakaya.
