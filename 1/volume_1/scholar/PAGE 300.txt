[12501-12520] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Symbolic Presentation
The text transitions to the tenth section: extensive presentation of delusion modes and reversal through symbolic language (brda'i sgo). The structure presents: (1) first topic—the manner of delusion from the basis through three non-recognitions and four conditions, (2) citation from Rang shar tantra describing Vajrasattva's delusion narrative: location (Yul yangs pa can), place (Gnas mdzes ldan), time (Dus nam sros pa), year (Lo phag gi lo), day (Nyima sprul), star (Skar ma bya), name (Rgan po ling tog can), caste (ma nges pa), companions (rogs mi bzhi), robbers (mi rgod pa lnga), supporters (rgyab rten pa), thieves (rkun mo), accumulation (bsogs pa), military hosts (dmag gi tshogs). The passage introduces symbolic narrative as the mode of presenting delusion's origin.

[12501-12520] [PHILOLOGY] Symbolic and Narrative Terminology
The passage employs symbolic narrative terminology: brda'i sgo (symbolic door), 'khrul lugs (delusion manner), grogs po (companions), rgod pa (robbers/wild ones), rgyab rten (supporters/backing), rkun mo (thieves). The term dpag tu med pa (immeasurable) indicates vast scale. The phrase 'khrul gzhi med pa (without basis of delusion) emphasizes the ultimate groundlessness of error. The particle ste (thus/so) introduces narrative sequence.

[12501-12520] [CONTEXT] Symbolic Language in Dzogchen
The symbolic narrative draws on the esoteric communication methods (brda) of Dzogchen, where historical or mythological narratives encode philosophical teachings. The Rang shar (Self-Arisen) tantra provides the source narrative. The specific details (location, time, name, etc.) are symbolic of stages in the process of delusion. This method allows complex philosophical content to be transmitted in narrative form accessible to both literal and esoteric interpretation.

[12501-12520] [CONCEPT] Narrative as Philosophical Encoding
The conceptual framework employs narrative as a vehicle for philosophical content. The story of Vajrasattva's delusion—where the primordial buddha appears to become deluded in specific circumstances—encodes the process of non-recognition in narrative form. Each symbolic element represents a stage in delusion's development: location represents the basis, place represents manifestation, time represents the moment of non-recognition, companions represent conditions, robbers represent afflictions, military hosts represent the multiplication of delusion. The framework establishes that delusion has no actual basis ('khrul gzhi med pa)—the narrative describes an apparent process that, from the perspective of recognition, never actually occurred. The symbolic method allows both the apparent reality of delusion and its ultimate unreality to be communicated simultaneously.
