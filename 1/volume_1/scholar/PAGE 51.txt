[1653-1664] [PHILOLOGY] The Six Contact Elements from Mind-Nature
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa completes the presentation of the eighteen elements (*drug tshan gsum*), demonstrating how the six contact elements (*'dus te reg pa'i khams*) arise from the same mind-source as the preceding twelve sense-consciousness elements.

**Particle Analysis:**
- *'dzin pas na* (holding-by-means-of thus) — causal particle *pas* indicating the mechanism of element formation
- *sgrub pas na* (accomplishing-by-means-of thus) — the functional operation of each element
- *'dus te reg pa* (gathering-and-contacting) — the compound verb structure showing how contact emerges from the convergence of sense, object, and consciousness

**Key Insight:** Each of the six contact elements corresponds to the threefold gathering (*'dus pa gsum*):
1. Sense faculty (*dbang po*)
2. Object (*yul*)
3. Consciousness (*rnam shes*)

[1665-1666] [STRUCTURE] Summary: Elements as Object-Holding
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa synthesizes: *khams de dag rnams kyang yul 'dzin par byed pa yin no* — "these elements also accomplish the holding of objects." This reveals the functional unity underlying the apparent diversity of the eighteen elements.

The concluding statement *de yang 'khrul pa nyid nang du 'dzin pa'i cha las byung ba* establishes the epistemological grounding: all elements arise from the "part that holds within delusion itself" (*'khrul pa nyid nang du 'dzin pa'i cha*).

**Architectural Significance:** This completes the first major section on *khams* (elements), transitioning to *phung po* (aggregates).

[1667-1676] [CONCEPT] The Two-Fold Aggregate Classification
**Analysis:**

The text shifts to the second major category: *rten phung po* (basis-aggregates). Longchenpa establishes a fundamental bifurcation:

**Structure:**
1. *rtog pa dang bcas pa'i phung po* — Aggregates with thought (conceptual)
2. *rtog pa med pa'i phung po* — Aggregates without thought (non-conceptual)

**The Five Contaminated Aggregates (*zag bcas 'jig rten pa*):**

The presentation follows standard Abhidharma taxonomy, yet with Dzogchen hermeneutics:

1. **Form Aggregate (*gzugs kyi phung po*)**
   - Definition: *gzhig cing gzhom du rung ba* — suitable for destruction/disintegration
   - Philological note: *gzhig* (to break/destroy) implies impermanence (*mi rtag pa*) as intrinsic to form

2. **Feeling Aggregate (*tshor ba'i phung po*)**
   - Definition: *myong zhing sred par gyur pa* — experiencing and becoming desire
   - Key particle: *par gyur pa* (become-transformative) indicating the dynamic process where feeling ripens into craving

3. **Perception Aggregate (*'du shes kyi phung po*)**
   - Definition: *g.yo zhing yul la 'jug pa* — moving and entering objects
   - Analysis: *g.yo* (to move/flutter) captures the active, seeking nature of perception

4. **Formation Factors Aggregate (*'du byed kyi phung po*)**
   - Definition: *byed cing bag chags sogs pa* — doing and including latencies
   - Expansion: *sogs pa* indicates this aggregate encompasses all fifty-one mental factors (*sems byung*)

**Dzogchen Synthesis:** Even these "contaminated" aggregates will be reconceptualized as the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) when recognized as self-liberated.
