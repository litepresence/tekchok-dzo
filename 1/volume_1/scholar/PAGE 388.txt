[16256-16260] [CONCEPT] Continuation: Liberation from Attachment to Tenets
**Analysis:** Lines 16256-16260 complete the thought from the previous page: through the far-reaching water lamp seeing dharmata direct-perception appearance, the mind turns away from holding philosophical tenets (grub mtha') as self-existent ('dod rgyal du 'dzin pa). This demonstrates the soteriological function of the four lamps—liberating practitioners from conceptual fixation on philosophical positions.

[16261-16265] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Next Topic
**Analysis:** The text continues to develop the theme that the four lamps serve as the foundation for authentic spiritual realization, distinct from ordinary perception and conceptual understanding. The detailed explanation of the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) established in this section provides the basis for subsequent discussions of practice (nyams len) and result ('bras bu).

[16266-16270] [CONTEXT] Synthesis of Four Lamps Teaching
**Analysis:** The presentation of the four lamps integrates several key dimensions: (1) embryological origins—how they develop from the purified elements at conception; (2) structural analysis—their distinct characteristics and functions; (3) etymological derivation—the meaning of their names; (4) practical application—how they are utilized in meditation; and (5) soteriological significance—their role in the path to enlightenment. This multi-faceted treatment exemplifies the comprehensive approach of the Tibetan scholastic tradition.

[16271-16275] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terminology Notes
**Analysis:** Key technical terms in this section include: thig le (Skt. bindu)—the "drop" or energetic essence; sgron ma—literally "lamp," indicating illumination and dispelling of darkness; rgyang zhags—the "far-reaching snare," referring to the water-element aspect; dbyings—space or expanse, indicating the open, unobstructed nature of awareness; rang byung—self-arisen, indicating spontaneous manifestation without external causes.

[16276-16280] [CONCEPT] Relationship to Bardo States
**Analysis:** The four lamps are particularly significant for understanding the bardo (bar do) experiences. The text mentions the "dharmata bardo" (chos nyid kyi bar do) where the visions described become self-luminous and one can achieve complete enlightenment. The lamps thus function as the perceptual infrastructure for navigating the intermediate states between death and rebirth.

[16281-16285] [STRUCTURE] Summary of Chapter Twelve's Scope
**Analysis:** This chapter has systematically presented: (1) the embryonic formation of the body and the four lamps; (2) detailed analysis of each lamp's characteristics; (3) the distinction between samsaric perception and the lamps' wisdom-perception; (4) practical instructions for utilizing the lamps in meditation; and (5) their role in the ground, path, and result framework. The pedagogical progression moves from theoretical understanding to practical application, culminating in liberative realization.
