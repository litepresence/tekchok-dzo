[15926-15962] [STRUCTURE] Third Vision: Wisdom Maturation
The text presents the third vision (rig pa tshad phebs) as the maturation of wisdom to its full measure. The structure establishes: (1) exhaustion of impure perception, (2) full development of pure vision, and (3) nearing complete realization.

[15926-15962] [PHILOLOGY] Third Vision Terminology
The term rig pa tshad phebs kyi snang ba (vision of wisdom reaching measure) identifies the third stage. The compound ma dag pa 'khrul ba (impure delusion) describes what is exhausted. The phrase dag pa'i snang ba (pure vision) establishes the result.

[15926-15962] [CONTEXT] Near Completion
The text presents the third vision as the approach to complete realization. Impure perception is nearly exhausted; pure vision is nearly complete. This reflects the Dzogchen path's progression toward final fruition.

[15926-15962] [CONCEPT] Maturation as Exhaustion
The text conceptualizes the third vision as both maturation and exhaustion. Wisdom matures to its full measure while impure perception exhausts itself. The two processes are one: as purity increases, impurity naturally decreases.
