[00001-00015] [STRUCTURE] Definitive Calculation of Inner Transference
**Analysis:** This section establishes the precise calculation (nges pa'i tshad) of inner transference (nang gi 'pho ba). The base enumeration: for one healthy person in prime condition (skyes bu na tshod dar la bab pa), the daily wind count is 21,600 movements (nyi khri chig stong drug brgya). The text correlates this with chu tshod (water measures/hours) and dbyu gu (finger-widths/degrees) calculations: 8 thun (watches) per day, 32 thun tshod per watch, 64 dbyu gu, 16 'pho ba (transferences). Each 'pho ba contains 1,350 winds; each dbyu gu contains 338.5 winds; each thun contains 2,700 winds.

[00015-00027] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Measurement Terminology
**Analysis:** The passage presents technical temporal terminology: zhag (day), thun (watch/period), thun tshod (watch measure), dbyu gu (digit/degree), 'pho ba (transference). The twelve 'byung ba'i byed las (elemental functions) produce twelve phyer zug (penetrations/extensions), showing the relationship between elemental activities and wind expansion/contraction. The text notes that 'phel 'grib (waxing/waning) is determined by 675 wind movements (drug brgya dang bdun cu rtsa lnga), correlated with seasonal changes.

[00027-00037] [CONTEXT] Astronomical Correlation with Wind Calculation
**Analysis:** The passage cites the 'grel pa pad+ma dkar po (White Lotus Commentary): "byang lhor bgrod tshe snon 'brid bya"—when traversing north-south, add or subtract. This indicates the correlation between solar declination (nyi ma byang du 'gro ba) and day-length variation: northward movement increases daylight by two hours monthly, shortening night; southward movement reverses this. The text establishes that wind movement calculation must account for these seasonal astronomical variations for accurate prognostication.

[00037-00040] [CONCEPT] Calculating Definite Wind Enumeration
**Analysis:** The comprehensive calculation unfolds: one year = 12 months; 360 days; 720 meals (za ma). This yields 9,032.5 winds for the twelve periods of one day when calculated through the twelve-times-per-day method. Of these, 9,028 winds represent the measure of ye shes dag pa'i tshad (pure wisdom measure), while the remaining 4.5 represent glo bur ba rtog pa (sudden adventitious conceptuality). The five time periods (nyin lnga, mtshan lnga, nang nub gnyis) are calculated from the two equinoxes (ston dpyid kyi mnyam dus gnyis) as reference points.

[00040-00040] [CONTEXT] Vinaya Correlation for Solstice Determination
**Analysis:** The passage references 'dul ba (Vinaya) calculation of gso sbyong (soṣaṇa/restoration ceremony) feasibility—whether the full moon falls on the appropriate date or not. This establishes the orthographic correlation between Buddhist monastic law and astrological calculation, demonstrating the integration of vinaya observance with elemental wind prognostication.
