[17799-17823] [STRUCTURE] # Third Topic: Distinct Dharmas Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the third major topic: analysis of distinct dharmas (*khyad par can gyi chos gshan rnam par bshad pa*). This section systematically examines various categories that distinguish the Dzogchen view.

The page begins with citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* and *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung* on the five ye shes, then transitions to distinct dharmas analysis.

[17799-17820] [CONTEXT] Extended citations establishing ye shes classifications:
From *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
- Ye shes mirror-like like
- Various emanations unceased
- Uncontrived spontaneous nature
- Time three knowledge-free

From *rnal 'byor grub pa'i lung*:
- Five ye shes thus
- Dharmadhatu essence dharmata
- Mirror-like all clear
- Equality samsara-nirvana equal
- Discriminating particular distinct
- All-accomplishing activities accomplish

[17821-17850] [CONCEPT] Integration of Ground-Path-Fruition:
The distinct dharmas are presented across three stages:
1. **Ground** (*gzhi*): Primordial purity (*ka dag*), spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*), thigle, lamp aspects
2. **Path** (*lam*): Vision (*snang ba*), measure (*tshad*), familiarization (*goms*), signs (*rtags*)
3. **Fruition** ('bras bu): Dharmakaya, exhaustion (*zad pa*), liberation (*grol ba*), buddhahood (*sangs rgyas*)

[17851-17870] [PHILOLOGY] Key terminology of distinct dharmas:
- *rang byung* (self-arisen): Not made by causes-conditions, primordially existing
- *lhun grub* (spontaneously accomplished): Without effort, naturally perfect
- *cer mthong* (direct seeing): Without meditation, immediate recognition
- *gcer grol* (direct liberation): Without antidote, self-liberated
- *thod rgal* (direct transcendence): Spontaneous, leap-over progression

[17871-17895] [CONTEXT] Citation from *kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long*:
The text cites extensively on the spontaneously accomplished nature:
- Spontaneous accomplishment thus
- From primordial time accomplished
- Not made by anyone
- Self-abiding dharmata
- Unchanging great bliss
- Without seeking, self-obtained

[17896-17920] [CONCEPT] The Four Lamps Integration:
The distinct dharmas culminate in the integration of the four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*):
1. *rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma* (Far-reaching water lamp)
2. *thig le stong pa'i sgron ma* (Empty bindu lamp)
3. *dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Completely pure sphere lamp)
4. *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma* (Self-arising wisdom lamp)

Each lamp has:
- Its own essence, definition, classification
- Specific measures and signs
- Integration with the three kayas
- Progressive familiarization stages

**Summary:** Page 413 initiates the third topic on distinct dharmas, establishing the ground-path-fruition structure and key terminology. The integration of the four lamps system provides the comprehensive framework for Dzogchen practice and realization.
