[4393-4416] [CONCEPT] Three Tantras: Proofs and Purpose
**Analysis:** Lines 4393-4416 establish the three tantras through reasoning:

**Ground Tantra Proof [4393-4394]:**
- Realization: Buddha continuum
- Non-realization: sentient being continuum
- Therefore ground tantra proven

**Method Tantra [4395-4406]:**
- Meaning indicated basis
- No Buddha-sentient being not depending on awareness
- Both continua holders
- Understanding purpose
- Liberation result
- Guru instruction indicator
- Method one-to-one transmitted

**Essence Tantra [4407-4416]:**
- Awareness, dharmatā directly seen
- Past continuum holder
- Without guru instruction not seen
- Samsara continuum
- Flower four lamps seen
- Realization nature direct awareness
- Not seen: action-affliction continuum
- Essence experienced essence gathered
- Wisdom appearance seen, three realms not falling
