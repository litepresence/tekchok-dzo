The text presents the relationship between self-arisen wisdom and buddhahood.

[12615-12638] [CONTEXT] Buddha-Nature Theory Integration
The wisdom-buddhahood presentation integrates tathāgatagarbha/buddha-nature theory with Dzogchen. By identifying wisdom as the essence of buddhahood, the text establishes all beings as potentially enlightened. This reflects the universalist tendency in Mahayana adapted to Dzogchen's immediate recognition approach.

[12593-12638] [CONCEPT] Wisdom as Buddha Essence
The text conceptualizes self-arisen wisdom as the essence (snying po) of all buddhas—not something they possess but what they are. All buddhas are manifestations of wisdom; wisdom is the "stuff" of enlightenment. The identity of one's own wisdom with all buddhas' wisdom dissolves the distance between practitioner and enlightenment.
