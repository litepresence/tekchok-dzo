[12165-12204] [STRUCTURE] Acting for Others' Benefit
The text presents the third mode of Samantabhadra's liberation: acting for others' benefit (gzhan don mdzad pa). The structure presents: (1) non-movement from the ka dag expanse of dharmakāya's pure land, (2) manifestation from lhundrub's door according to beings' perceptions, (3) light and kāya-expression producing saṃbhogakāya display, (4) from that, the aeon of Brahma's creation, (5) nature emanation and impure saṃsāra door producing teachers appropriate to beings' locations and realms, (6) emptying saṃsāra through teaching. The passage establishes the non-dual relationship between buddha-abiding and buddha-activity: non-departure from the expanse while pervading all realms.

[12165-12204] [PHILOLOGY] Activity and Emanation Terminology
The passage employs specialized activity terminology: gzhan don (others' benefit), mdzad pa (activity/deed), sprul sku (emanation body, nirmāṇakāya), longs sku (enjoyment body, saṃbhogakāya). The phrase ma g.yos bzhin du (without moving) establishes the non-dual dynamic. The term bskal pa (aeon, kalpa) indicates vast temporal scope. The compound 'khor ba stongs par mdzad (emptying saṃsāra) describes the soteriological goal. The verb bstan (teach/show) characterizes buddha-activity.

[12165-12204] [CONTEXT] Uttara Tantra and Trikāya Theory
The passage cites from the Rgyud bla ma (Uttara Tantra), a major treatise on buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha). The trikāya (three body) theory—dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya—provides the framework for understanding how buddhas act without departing from the expanse. The 'dus ma byas (unconditioned) and lhun gyis grub (spontaneously present) terminology derives from the Uttara Tantra's analysis of buddha-qualities.

[12165-12204] [CONCEPT] Non-dual Buddha-Activity
The conceptual framework establishes buddha-activity as the spontaneous expression (rtsal) of the non-moving expanse. The buddha does not "go" to beings but manifests according to their perceptions from the expanse's own display. The saṃbhogakāya (longs sku) appears as the radiance of the expanse, not a constructed body. The nirmāṇakāya (sprul sku) manifests appropriate to beings' locations (gnas ris) and perceptions (snang tshul) without the buddha's conceptual intention. This framework resolves the apparent paradox of how a buddha can act in conditioned realms while remaining unconditioned: activity is the spontaneous play (rol pa) of the expanse, not a conditioned agent's deliberate action. The emptying of saṃsāra ('khor ba stongs pa) occurs not by destroying it but by revealing its true nature as the expanse's own display.
