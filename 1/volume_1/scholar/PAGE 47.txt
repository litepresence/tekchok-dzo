[1529-1538] [PHILOLOGY] Complete Destruction and Citation
**Analysis:**

**Wind Destruction:**
- Diamond-cross wind (*rlung rdo rje rgya gram*) arises from below
- Scatters everything to third dhyana level
- Becomes single sky/space

**Result:** After formation, abiding, destruction — nature of sky becomes single emptiness.

**Thalgyur Citation:**
"Arising, destruction, abiding, and emptiness
Birth, aging, sickness, and death
Are the wheel of existence's confusion"

**Kalpa Calculations:**
- Common vehicle: 20 intermediate eons each for formation, abiding, destruction
- 80×60 = First duration kalpa
- 180×60 = Second intermediate kalpa
- Great kalpa = combined total
