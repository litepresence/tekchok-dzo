[16381-16392] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Blazing Lamp Tantra*):
The verse provides the characteristic analysis in poetic form. The particle *yis* (*kyis*) in 16382 functions as instrumental, indicating agency: "by means of unceasing arising."

[16381-16392] [PHILOLOGY] Technical terms in the citation:
- *'char byed* (arising-maker): causative agent
- *pad+ma'i spyan* (lotus eye): synonym for eye in tantric physiology
- *rang gi mtshan nyid* (own characteristic): defining quality
- *'byung ba* (elements): the five material elements as causal forces
- *sdud* (gather): collecting or contracting function
- *'dzin* (hold): maintaining or sustaining function
- *mched* (expand): radiating or extending function
- *lta ba* (view): visual/cognitive perception
- *gnas* (abide): stable manifestation
- *gong ma* (above): hierarchical superior aspect
- *rang 'dzin* (self-hold): reflexive self-apprehension

[16393-16396] [CONCEPT] Gloss on citation terminology:
Longchenpa provides a threefold gloss (*'grel pa*) on the verse:
1. *Yul snang rung gi gzugs rnams* — forms capable of appearing as objects
2. *Yul can dbang shes* — object-possessing sense consciousness
3. *Yul med* — non-object: clear appearances of non-existence, double-moon aspects, etc.

The "double-moon" (*zla gnyis*) refers to the visual phenomenon seen when pressing the eye, a standard example in Buddhist epistemology of perceptual error.

[16397-16405] [STRUCTURE] # Location Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa identifies the location (*gnas*) as the eye's "a-berry" (*mig gi a 'bras*). The exposition traces the embryological development:

1. First body formation: navel channel-knot triangle (*lte ba'i rtsa mdud gru gsum*)
2. Two eyes form: lamp-eye (*sgron ma'i spyan*) and element-eye (*'byung ba'i spyan*)
3. Arise: eye power-support (*mig gi dbang rten*) and power (*dbang po*)
4. Arise: light-root essence (*'od rtsa'i dngas ma*)
5. Path: navel → heart (*snying*) → spine branches (*sgal tshigs 'dab*) → inside surface of ears → skull membrane (*klad rgya'i spris*) → pierce two eye a-berries
6. Two channels without blood/yellow-water, like ram-horns, filled with light filaments (*'od kyi snal ma*) → pierce as door Water Lamp

[16399-16405] [PHILOLOGY] Anatomical terminology:
- *Rtsa mdud* (channel-knot): energetic constriction point
- *Grus gsum* (triangle): geometric energetic configuration
- *Spris* (membrane): anatomical covering
- *A 'bras* (a-berry): crystalline lens structure
- *Rtsa khrag* (channel-blood): subtle energetic fluid
- *Chu ser* (yellow-water): metabolic fluid
- *Ba men gyi rwa* (ram-horn): descriptive simile for curved channel
- *'Od kyi snal ma* (light filaments): energetic channels of luminosity
- *Sgo chu'i sgron ma* (door Water Lamp): the channel aperture functioning as lamp

[16406-16417] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The tantric verse provides the anatomical location in metered form:
- Location is the eye
- Arising unceasing, holding objects
- From white conch-hall of brain (*klad pa dung khang dkar po*)
- Channel with three coils to the right (*g.yas su 'khyil pa gsum*)
- Ram-horn shape
- All essences of sense powers gathered
- Arising for objects of sense powers
- Abides inside the channel

[16406] [PHILOLOGY] The phrase *dngos su gnas te* (actually abides) with the continuative *te* suspends meaning, linking the assertion of actual location to the subsequent scriptural citation.

[16418-16421] [CONCEPT] The Five-Aggregate Ninefold Arising:
Longchenpa describes the subtle physiology:
- The channel, at the pulsation branch (*rgyungs pa'i 'dab*), has one upward root
- Enters skull cavity (*thod pa'i sbubs*)
- Three branches: right and left pierce two eyes; middle pierces Brahma-aperture (*tshangs bug*)
- Inside: thought-free awareness body (*rig pa rtog med kyi sku*)
- Vajra necklace (*rdo rje lu gu rgyud*) — subtle energetic structure
- Light-round dots stacked (*'od zlum gyi thig le brtsegs ma*)
- Five (*lnga*), nine (*dgu*) arise

The "five" and "nine" refer to configurations of bindus (*thig le*) that appear in *thod rgal* vision.

[16421] [PHILOLOGY] The term *brtsegs ma* (stacked/layered) with the locative *la* indicates the configuration of bindus as stacked or arranged in layers, not merely piled randomly.
