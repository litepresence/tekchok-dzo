[7132-7171] [STRUCTURE] Auspicious Signs and Timing Continued

**Auspicious Signs for Empowerment:**
If signs of purification arise, then empowerment ritual should be exerted.

If practice substances increase:
- Supreme siddhi obtained
- Be inspired toward equal meaning
- Having entered empowerments
- Always seeing good signs
- Common siddhi accomplished by that
- Even with experience and realization
- This also engages in bliss-happiness
- Especially toward guru
- Good aspiration is born
- This also joins with supreme mudrā
- Self body, speech seen as bliss
- This is pure Buddha field

With elaboration empowerment time and signs well explained.

[7172-7186] [PHILOLOGY] Without Elaboration Timing

From *De nyid*:
"Now without elaboration
Time and signs closely shown
This has no year particularity
Any can know
This time summer and winter good
Day count waxing phase
Confer time dawn and next morning
This with faithful five and six
More than seven, purpose unaccomplished
Thus faithful child
Mental activity virtuous
Speech with guru's praise
Such one at empowerment time
Body not bliss
Body sin confess from outside
Likewise speech and mind also
Sin confession activity begin
Without elaboration empowerment
Time and signs explained"

Day count waning avoided
For experience stabilization
Experience and blessings increase above
Confer time sun tip risen
For self-arisen wisdom rising
Or at waning juncture
Thought exhaustion meaning do
Fortunate one or two
More than three, purpose unaccomplished
This time individual direction held
Body time in sky
Cloud and vapor, rain and
Wind, etc., sounds
Near enemies and thieves
Ugly form arisen
Body's sin great therefore
Outside empowerment done
Without guru's instruction shown
Sugata's body form or
Own guru's bedroom
Circumambulation six hundred thousand
Or prostration one hundred thousand
That time sign particularity
First existing, last middle
From definite sign forms
Body's conduct matured therefore
Outside effort not needed
If last arisen
Body's complete measure not finished
Outside again, conduct begin
Again if sin not pure
Deity's form ten thousand meditate
Then guru's instruction
Stages learn"
