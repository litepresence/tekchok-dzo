[13688-13715] [STRUCTURE] Kunzang Yab-Yum and Three Kāyas Generation
The text presents Samantabhadra father-mother (kun bzang yab yum) generating the three kāyas. The structure establishes: (1) outer body, speech, and mind generated from channels, (2) inner three kāyas generated from channels, and (3) secret three kāyas as the ultimate generation.

[13688-13715] [PHILOLOGY] Primordial Buddha Terminology
The term kun bzang yab yum (Samantabhadra father-mother) identifies the primordial buddha couple. The compound sku gsum (three kāyas) establishes the enlightened dimensions. The phrase phyi nang gsang gsum (outer, inner, secret three) describes levels of practice.

[13688-13715] [CONTEXT] Primordial Buddha Cosmology
The text presents Samantabhadra as the source of all manifestation. The generation of three kāyas from channels establishes that enlightenment is not created but revealed. This reflects Dzogchen's emphasis on primordial purity.

[13688-13715] [CONCEPT] Generation Without Creation
The text conceptualizes generation (bskyed pa) not as creation from nothing but as manifestation of what already is. The three kāyas are generated from channels because channels are the three kāyas in latent form. Recognition, not transformation, is the path.
