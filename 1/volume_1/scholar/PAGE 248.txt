[10099-10114] [STRUCTURE] Outer-Inner Mind Samaya Continuation
**Analysis:** Line 10099 introduces the second outer mind violation: harmful intent toward guru and vajra siblings (bla ma dang mched lcam la gnod sems spong ba). Lines 10100-10114 cite the Gnam lcags me 'bar ba'i rgyud (Blazing Sky-Iron Fire Tantra), employing an eight-line verse structure. The passage presents a calculus of comparative karma: harming ordinary beings equals killing three hundred lives (brgya phrag gsum gyi srog bcad pa); harming mantra practitioners equals that multiplied a thousandfold (phrag 'gyur ro); harming seven vajra siblings equals seven thousandfold (bdun phrag go); harming lineage gurus equals a hundred thousandfold (brgya phrag go); harming root guru equals a hundred times that (de yi brgya). This graduated enumeration reflects the tantric understanding of karma's relational weighting based on spiritual proximity and commitment level.

[10100-10114] [PHILOLOGY] Multiplicative Karma Terminology
**Analysis:** The passage employs multiplicative terminology with mathematical precision. The term brgya phrag (hundred-thousand) functions as a base unit, with subsequent multipliers (phrag, bdun, brgya) building geometrically. Line 10105's sdig pa'i cha dang mnyam (equal to a portion of misdeed) employs the equative particle dang with mnyam, establishing exact proportional equivalence. The instrumental particle pas at line 10112 indicates agency derived from empowerment (dbang thob pas), establishing that consequences vary based on initiation level. The terminative particle bar at line 10114 (de ltar ro) closes the enumeration with finality, indicating the completion of this particular calculus.

[10115-10133] [CONTEXT] Wrong View as Ground Violation
**Analysis:** Lines 10115-10125 present the outer-secret mind violation: abandoning wrong view toward self and others' tenets (rang gzhan gyi grub mtha' la log lta skyes pa spong ba). The citation from Bkod pa chen po describes the consequence: long residence in ground-touching fire suffering (sa spyod me yi sdug bsngal). Lines 10125-10133 introduce the inner mind samaya through a threefold division: outer conduct (phyi spyod pa), inner meditation (nang sgom pa), and secret view (gsang ba lta ba log pa), citing the Shel gyi khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud (Crystal Tower Tantra). The passage establishes wrong view (log lta) as the "great wrong path" (lam log chen po), identifying it as the root of all beings' suffering. This reflects the Mahayana and Vajrayana emphasis on view as foundation—wrong view corrupts all subsequent practice regardless of method.

[10134-10154] [CONCEPT] Secret Mind Samaya and the Threefold Continuum
**Analysis:** Lines 10134-10136 enumerate the three secret mind violations: outer view-meditation-conduct (lta sgom spyod pa), inner deity (yi dam gyi lha), and secret guru-consort-daily mindfulness (bla ma dang mched lcam nyin zhag tu yid la byas pa). This tripartite structure demonstrates how the threefold template extends to the most subtle dimensions of practice. Lines 10137-10143 cite the Padma klong kyi rgyud (Lotus Space Tantra), describing how failure to maintain mental commitments (yid la ma byas) leads to Avici hell (mnar med). Lines 10144-10154 cite the Lhan cig skyes pa nye bar len pa'i rgyud (Tantra of Connate Appropriation), establishing that abandoning deity commitment (yi dam spang bar mi bya) or guru (bla ma spangs na) causes loss of siddhi (dngos grub brlag). The text conceptualizes secret samaya as maintaining continuous mental connection to the three roots (rtsa gsum) throughout all activities.

[10155-10178] [STRUCTURE] Supreme Samaya Compilation
**Analysis:** Lines 10155-10178 present a comprehensive compilation from the Dam tshig rnam par bkod pa mchog gi sdong po'i rgyud (Tantra of Supreme Samaya Arrangement Tree), employing a twenty-two-line verse structure—the most extensive citation in this section. The passage systematically enumerates: not transgressing commitments (dam bca' 'da' bar mi bya), not breaking guru's word (bla ma'i khas blangs mi bcag), not perverting guru's actions (bla ma'i bya ba ma log), dedicating body-speech-mind to dharma (lus ngag sems chos las gzhan par mi bya'o), benefiting all beings (sems can kun gyi don bya), constant guru devotion (rtag tu bla ma la gus), not transgressing supreme samaya (dam tshig mchog las 'da' mi bya), holding vajra and bell (rdo rje la dril bu gzung), maintaining mantra substances (sngags la 'os pa'i rdzas rnams gzung), and protecting secrets from others (gzhan la mi bsgrag). This comprehensive enumeration functions as a capstone summary of all preceding samaya categories.

[10155-10178] [PHILOLOGY] Comprehensive Enumeration Syntax
**Analysis:** The compilation employs comprehensive enumeration syntax with the distributive particle yang (also/even) appearing six times (lines 10156, 10158, 10160, 10161, 10162, 10166), creating an accumulative rhetorical effect. The prohibitive construction mi bya (do not do) appears seven times, establishing absolute interdiction. The instrumental particle gis at line 10174 marks the triad of body-speech-mind (lus ngag yid) as the instruments of potential violation. The locative particle la at lines 10173 and 10176 marks the guru and vajra siblings as objects of protection. The phrase "de bzhin" (likewise/similarly) at line 10176 introduces parallel application, demonstrating systematic extension of ethical principles across relational domains.

[10179-10206] [CONTEXT] Twenty-Seven Samaya and Thal 'gyur Citations
**Analysis:** Line 10179 provides the enumeration summary: "de ltar sku gsung thugs kyi dbye bas nyi shu rtsa bdun gyi dam tshig" (thus twenty-seven samaya through the divisions of body, speech, and mind), identifying this as the "khyad par gyi chos" (special/unique doctrine) of this system. Lines 10180-10206 cite the Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Prasanga) literature, presenting an additional eighteen-line enumeration covering: guru as buddha worship support (bla ma sangs rgyas mchod pa'i rten), dharma-sangha-deity (chos dang dge 'dun yi dam lha), dakinis (rdo rje mkha' 'gro ma), continuous offering (tshogs dang mchod pa rgyun mi bcad), guru recognition and worship (bla ma mtshan nyid ldan mthong na bstod dang mchod pa), not criticizing women (bud med mi smad), not angering (khro mi bya), not criticizing aggregates (phung po mi smad), relying on deity (yi dam bsten), mandala-mantra-deity (dkyil 'khor dang ni sngags dang lha), mudra reliance (phyag rgya bsten pa), not breaking faithful communities (dad can tshogs nyid mi bcag), not disturbing virtuous mind (dge ldan sems mi dkrugs), and maintaining samaya (sdom ldan dam tshig gnas par bya). The citation then extends to training stages (bslab pa'i rim pa): completing body conduct (lus kyi spyod pa rdzogs bya), cutting speech (ngag ni rab tu gcad par bya), examining mind (sems ni gnas dang brtag cing dpyad), gradual entry practice (rim 'jug las kyi rim pa bya), continuous hand and pill practice (rtag tu phyag dang ri lu'i las), channels entering bindu network (rtsa rnams thig le'i drwa bar gzhug), and wearing garlands and necklaces beautifully (phreng ba do shal phyed pa yang mdzes shing). This comprehensive list integrates Mahayana, tantric, and Dzogchen commitments into a unified framework.
