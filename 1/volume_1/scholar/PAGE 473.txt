[LINE 20203-20210] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom Dissolution and Introduction to Sixteen Similes
**Analysis:** Conclusion of temporal determination: when path-appearances dissolve into inner expanse, the five elements also swirl into the expanse — elements resting on elements, wisdom swirling in expanse, prajñā swirling in space, wisdom moved into expanse. Transition to third general meaning: distinguishing other phenomena through definite examples (དཔེ་ངེས་པས་སོ་སོར་དབྱེ་བ་) and particular division through definite meaning (དོན་ངེས་པས་བྱེ་བྲག་ཏུ་དབྱེ་བ་).

[LINE 20211-20228] [CONTEXT] Similes 1-3: Head/Horn, Water/Drawing, Water/Bubble
**Analysis:** From Rang shar tantra, fifteen pairs of comparison-bases: (1) Head and horn — both arise from one basis; realized Buddhas like head (naturally present), unrealized sentient beings like horn (superimposition); "one producing many." (2) Water and drawing — awareness liberates self-place like drawing on water (impermanent); non-recognition deludes like water-fire (mirage). (3) Water and bubble — from awareness-water's potency, mind-bubbles arise; mind cannot control awareness.

[LINE 20229-20236] [CONTEXT] Similes 4-6: Gold/Copper, Ocean/Boat, Sleep/Wake
**Analysis:** (4) Gold and copper — wisdom self-potency not-mistaken, liberated from grasping-holding like gold; mind potency mistaken, grasping-holding arisen like counterfeit; appear similar but color not different in nature. (5) Ocean and boat — universal ground like boat floating in dharmakāya ocean — path arisen. (6) Sleep and wake — delusion and liberation in ground-awareness mode are one; like one person sleeping and awake; crucial difference: sense-power clarity.

**Analysis:** དཔེ་ངེས་པ་ (definite example/simile); སོ་སོར་དབྱེ་བ་ (individual division); འདྲ་གཞི་ (comparison base); གཉིས་ཚན་ (pair); རྟོགས་པ་སངས་རྒྱས་ (realized Buddha); མ་རྟོག་སེམས་ཅན་ (unrealized sentient being); མགོ་ (head); རྭ་ (horn); རི་མོ་ (drawing/painting); རྦ་བ་ (froth); ཆུ་བུར་ (bubble); གསེར་ (gold); ར་གན་ (copper/counterfeit); ཁོག་མཐུན་ (counterfeit/fake); ཀུན་གཞི་ (universal ground/ālaya); གྲུ་ (boat); གཉིད་ལོག་པ་ (fallen asleep); སད་པ་ (awake).

[LINE 20203-20236] [CONCEPT] The Logic of Similitude in Dzogchen
**Analysis:** The sixteen similes constitute a logic of similitude (དཔེ་རིགས་) that operates through resemblance-in-difference. Each pair shares a ground (གཞི་) but diverges in manifestation: head/horn share the body but one is natural/functional while the other is adventitious; water/drawing share fluidity but one is actual while the other is ephemeral impression; gold/copper share metallic appearance but differ in value/authenticity. This logic serves the "one basis, two paths" (གཞི་གཅིག་ལམ་གཉིས་) doctrine — the recognition that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not different in essence but in recognition. The similes thus function as pedagogical devices to undermine the reification of difference while maintaining the functional distinction between delusion and liberation. The progression moves from ontological (head/horn) through epistemological (water/drawing) to phenomenological (sleep/wake) distinctions.
