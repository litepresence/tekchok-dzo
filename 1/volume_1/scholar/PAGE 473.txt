[00001-00032] [CONCEPT] Similes of Realization: The Remaining Comparisons

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage continues the sixteen similes, covering comparisons 7-15. The organization: (7) realization/non-realization like blind person/touching, (8) wisdom/latencies like firefly/fire, (9) awareness entering wisdom like child entering mother's lap, (10) wisdom/light like gold/color, (11) instruction/pouring like alcohol/intoxication, (12) wisdom dissolving into light like rainbow dissolving into space, (13) wisdom dissolving into expanse like tributary entering ocean, (14) non-reversing awareness like fired arrow, (15) [incomplete]. Each simile establishes a specific ontological or phenomenological distinction.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: rtogs pa dang ma rtogs pa (realization and non-realization), ba mo'i reg pa (touching a breast), snang ba zil gyis gnon pa (suppressing appearance), bag chags (latencies), spang gnyen (antidote and remedy), sbur ma (moth), ye shes 'od la thim (wisdom dissolving into light), 'ja' tshon (rainbow), ye shes dbyings thim (wisdom dissolving into expanse), chu bran (tributary/stream), rig pa phyir mi ldog pa (non-reversing awareness), dpag chen gyi mda' (powerful arrow). The term "yid ches pa'i phyir" (for the purpose of confidence) indicates the pedagogical function of similes.

- **[CONTEXT]** The similes derive from the *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra, a key text of the Nyingtik tradition. The comparison of wisdom and latencies to firefly and fire (sbur ma dang me'i tshul) reflects the standard Buddhist metaphor of wisdom burning away afflictions. The mother-child simile indicates the naturalness of awareness entering wisdom. The fired-arrow simile indicates the irreversibility of realization. The rainbow-space simile indicates the empty-yet-appearing nature of wisdom manifestations.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section completes the simile-system that distinguishes rig pa (awareness) from sems (mind) on multiple dimensions: (7) realization requires "contact" with conditions (like sun-light), (8) wisdom consumes latencies (like fire), (9) awareness naturally enters wisdom (like child to mother), (10) wisdom and light are inseparable yet distinguishable (like gold and color), (11) instructions produce recognition (like alcohol produces intoxication), (12-13) wisdom dissolves into light/expanse (like rainbow into space/water into ocean), (14) awareness is irreversible (like fired arrow). These similes serve as "skillful means" (thabs) to guide recognition through analogy.

- **[VARIANT]** No textual variants attested.
