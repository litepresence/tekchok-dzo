[13283-13328] [STRUCTURE] Result ('bras bu) Introduction
The text introduces the result section. The structure establishes: (1) result as the full actualization of ground, (2) the identity of ground and result, (3) the three bodies (sku gsum) as result, and (4) result not as achievement but as recognition complete.

[13283-13304] [PHILOLOGY] Result Terminology
The term 'bras bu (result, fruit, phala) appears with identity phrases: gzhi dang 'bras bu dbyer med (ground and result inseparable). The sku gsum (three bodies, trikāya) enumerate the result: chos sku (dharmakāya), longs sku (sambhogakāya), sprul sku (nirmāṇakāya). The term rdzogs pa (perfection) describes the result.

[13305-13328] [CONTEXT] Ground-Path-Result Completion
The result introduction completes the ground-path-result structure that has organized the text. Having covered ground (the basis) and path (the means), the text now addresses result (the completion). This structure reflects classical Buddhist systematic organization adapted to Dzogchen.

[13283-13328] [CONCEPT] Result as Ground Recognized
The text conceptualizes result not as something new achieved but as ground fully recognized. The three bodies are not created through practice but revealed as the true nature of the practitioner. Ground, path, and result are ultimately non-dual—result is ground seen clearly, path is the seeing. This non-triume structure distinguishes Dzogchen from causal paths.
