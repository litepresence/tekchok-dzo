[L1-11] [STRUCTURE] Fifth Week: Water Nourishment and Speech Development
**Analysis:** On the fifth day (zhag lnga pa), water holds the clarified body (chus dngas pa'i lus 'dzin pa) and performs the activity of producing (skyed pa'i las byed). Within that, the yellow syllable SAM clearly shines and blazes (yi ge saM ser po gsal zhing 'tsher ba chags pas), depending on that vocal sound-tune (skad kyi gdangs), speech arises ('gro ba'i skad kyi gdangs de la brten nas 'byung). In its four directions, earth-water-fire-wind channels holding, gathering, and moving upward (sa/chu/me/rlung gi rtsa 'dzin pa dang sdud pa dang yas pa'i nang na suM dkar po/dmar po/ljang gu) abide compatible with those channels. From that arise the four modes: going, sleeping, sitting, and standing behavior ('gro nyal 'dug sdod spyod lam rnam bzhir de las 'byung ba).

[L12-25] [PHILOLOGY] Sixth Week: Fire-Wind Union and Mental Development
**Analysis:** On the sixth day (zhag drug pa), fire and wind unite (me dang rlung gnyis 'dus nas), performing the activities of body formation and disintegration (lus kyi chags pa dang 'jig pa'i las byed). At this time, within blazing, increasing fire channels (me'i rtsa 'bar zhing mched pa'i nang na), the syllable RAM fiercely blazes and crackles (rab tu 'tsheg cing lhab pa gnas). The sharp and dull discriminations of beings' consciousnesses ('gro ba rnams kyi shes pa rno ba dang rtul ba'i bye brag) are distinguished by this syllable's clarity or obscurity (yi ge 'di gsal mi gsal gyis 'byed pa). In its four directions, inner four elements' channels increasing, blazing, and burning (nang shas kyi 'byung ba bzhi'i rtsa mched pa/'bar ba/sreg pa'i nang na) contain RAM producing, RUM empty, RAM sleeping as symbols. Depending on the wheel of beings' recollection-thought ('gro ba'i dran bsam gyi 'khor lo), this arises.

[L26-33] [CONCEPT] Completion of Six Weeks and Dependence on Four Elements
**Analysis:** Thus completing six days (de ltar zhag drug rdzogs pas), the elements themselves perform their activities of formation, making the support of formation and abiding (de ltar bzhis ma byas na/phyir 'byung ba bzhi la brten pa'i zas gos la dbang bar mi nus pa dang/nang du chos rnams bzhi tshan du mngon par mi 'gyur ba dang/gsang bar dbang bzhi'i 'bras bu mi smin pas/bzhi po chags pa'i rten du nges pa). If not done thus by the four, one cannot control external food and clothing depending on the four elements; internally phenomena do not manifest as fourfold; secretly the four empowerments' fruit does not ripen - the four are determined as the support of formation.

[L34-44] [CONTEXT] Pairing and Body Development
**Analysis:** Then every two days, through the activity of every two elements, the body's base is held (de nas zhag gnyis gnyis su 'byung ba gnyis gnyis kyi las kyis lus kyi gzhi gzung ba). Just as male and female uniting produce seed increase-emergence (pho mo gnyis 'dus pas sa bon gyi 'phel 'byung ba), know that male-female elements uniting produce body aggregation increase (de yang zhag bdun pa la 'byung ba bzhi ro gcig tu gyur pa las). From the four cause-condition wind-minds (rgyu rkyen rlung sems bzhi), four flesh-blood-heat-breath (sha khrag drod dbugs bzhi), four channels (rtsa bzhi), four syllables (yi ge bzhi po rnams) become one form of nur nur po (nur nur po'i rnam pa gcig tu gyur pa) - through making them included in the complete gathering (kun 'dus pa'i tshogs pa dang bcas par byas pas).
