[STRUCTURE] The Two Outer Lamps: Thig Le and Dbyings as Vajra Fortress
This page completes the exposition of the four lamps by focusing on the two "outer" lamps (སྒྲོན་མ་ཕྱི་མ་): thig le (bindu/dot) and dbyings (dharmadhātu). The structure follows three movements: (1) wisdom lamp's fruition-function (19683-19692), (2) detailed characteristics of the two outer lamps (19693-19743), and (3) scriptural authentication from the Nor bu 'phra bkod chen po'i rgyud. The progression moves from soteriological result (how base ripens as fruition) to phenomenological description (what appears in vision) to canonical grounding (tantric authority), establishing these lamps as the architectural foundation of Dzogchen practice.

[PHILOLOGY] Visual and Spatial Terminology
Critical technical terms: ཟླུམ་ཁྲིགས་ (round/compressed) + དམར་གསལ་ (red-luminous) = thig le's visual signature—spherical, dense, vibrant. མཐིང་ག་ཁྱབ་ཆེན་ (great pervading deep blue) describes the dbyings lamp's infinite extension. རྣམ་ལྔ་ (five aspects/patterns) emerging from mig zur gnyis (two eye-corners) suggests bilateral symmetry in visionary experience. གསང་ཆེན་རྡོ་རྗེའི་རྫོང་ (great secret vajra fortress) employs architectural metaphor: རྫོང་ (fortress) implies impenetrability, stability, preciousness (like ནོར་བུ་ jewel), and dwelling-place. The term ལུ་གུ་རྒྱུད་ (whirling vajra chain) appears repeatedly—describing a luminous thread that seems to spiral or rotate when vision stabilizes. རང་གནས་པ་ (self-abiding) negates constructed meditation; རང་རྫོགས་ (self-complete) negates progressive cultivation.

[CONTEXT] Citations from Nor bu 'phra bkod chen po'i rgyud
The extensive citation (19722-19742) from the Precious Array of Jewels Tantra establishes scriptural authority for the two outer lamps as sources of kayā and jñāna. The verses state: thig le stong pa and rang byung dbyings transcend stong dang mi stong mtha' (empty/non-empty extremes), abide mngon gnas (manifestly present) without rtsol ba (effort), and constitute the rang snang 'od kyi dkyil yangs (vast self-appearance realm of light). This "great secret vajra fortress" is beyond birth/destruction, free from direction, and non-dual regarding the two truths. The citation positions Dzogchen practice within the highest yoga tantra framework while asserting its unique non-dual transcendence of tantric gradualism.

[CONCEPT] Ripening the Base as Fruition (Gzhi 'Bras Bur Smin Pa)
The core doctrinal innovation: gzhi nyid 'bras bur smin byed shes rab (prajñā that ripens the base itself as fruition). Unlike conventional Buddhist paths where cause and result are distinct, here the base (gzhi) and result ('bras bu) are ontologically identical—differentiated only by recognition (ངོས་ཟིན་). The ngo bo nyid kyi chos sku (svābhāvikakāya) becomes ye shes chos sku (jñānadharmakāya) through this ripening. This establishes sku dang ye shes lhun grub (spontaneous presence of kayā and wisdom) as the natural state, not an achievement. The "ripening" is metaphorical—like a fruit that appears to develop but was always potentially present in the seed. The practitioner does not create enlightenment but allows the pre-existing to manifest by removing obstructions (sgrib pa).

[STRUCTURE] Characteristics of the Two Outer Lamps
The thig le sgron ma (bindu lamp) appears as: zlum (round), khrigs (compressed/dense), dmar gsal (red-luminous), visible to the eye (mig na snang ba), serving as rten (support) for ye shes 'char ba (arising of wisdom). The dbyings kyi sgron ma (dharmadhātu lamp) appears as: mthing ga khyab chen (great pervading deep blue), mched pa'i rnam lnga (five expanding patterns), arising from mig zur gnyis (two eye-corners), functioning as sku'i 'char gzhi (ground for kayā-appearance). These two form a complementary pair: thig le = concentration, density, form; dbyings = expansion, vastness, emptiness. Together they manifest the inseparability of form and emptiness (gzugs stong dbyer med)—the core Dzogchen view.

[PHILOLOGY] The Five-Fold and Six-Fold Classifications
The verse at 19704-19720 presents complex enumerations: mthing ga rang rdzogs gnyis kyi cha (two aspects of self-completed deep blue), thabs dang shes rab rdzogs pa (completion of method and wisdom), zur gnyis cha las sku gnyis 'dzin (two kayā held from two corners), rab tu snang ba mched par byed (greatly expanding appearance). The Nor bu 'phra bkod citation lists: lu gu rgyud ni srang nas 'dren (pulling the vajra chain), dkyil 'khor rdzogs pa'i gzugs (form of complete maṇḍala), ye shes rnams kyi gzhi mdangs (ground-radiance of wisdoms), 'od kyi gting gdangs (depth-radiance of light), sku dang thig le'i 'dun sa (dwelling of kayā and bindu). These enumerations are not merely descriptive but prescriptive—indicating what the practitioner should recognize in visionary experience.

[CONCEPT] The Fortress Metaphor (Rdzong)
The rdzong (fortress) metaphor encodes multiple meanings: (1) protective enclosure—primordial purity cannot be damaged by conditions; (2) impenetrability—the natural state is immune to conceptual fabrication; (3) preciousness—like a jewel-fortress containing wish-fulfilling gems; (4) dwelling-place—the kayā and jñāna naturally abide here without seeking; (5) architectural stability—unlike the impermanent constructed meditation of lower vehicles. The fortress is built of rdo rje (vajra, diamond)—indestructible, luminous, empty yet apparent. The practitioner does not enter this fortress but recognizes always-already dwelling within it. This is the "self-secret" (རང་གསང་) nature of Dzogchen: enlightenment was never elsewhere.

[STRUCTURE] The Four Great Vast Dwellings
The text alludes to gzhal yas chen po de bzhi (four great vast dwellings) that establish the architectonic structure of Dzogchen practice. While not fully elaborated here, these correspond to: (1) the dwelling of dharmatā, (2) the dwelling of kayā, (3) the dwelling of jñāna, (4) the dwelling of self-liberation. These are not physical locations but modalities of presence—ways the natural state manifests. The two outer lamps (thig le and dbyings) constitute the visual dimension of these dwellings, while the two inner lamps (shes rab and rgyang zhags) constitute the cognitive and perceptual dimensions. Together they form a complete mandala of practice.
