[12777-12822] [STRUCTURE] Path Overview Introduction
The text introduces an overview of the path (lam) section. The structure establishes: (1) path as cutting through (khregs chod) and leapover (thod rgal), (2) preliminary practices (sngon 'gro), (3) main practice (dngos gzhi), and (4) the integration of all practices into recognition.

[12777-12798] [PHILOLOGY] Path Terminology System
The two main practices employ distinct terminology: khregs chod (cutting through) and thod rgal (leapover/direct transcendence). The compound sngon 'gro (preliminary practices) describes preparation. The term dngos gzhi (main practice) identifies the core. The phrase "rig pa ngo sprod" (pointing out awareness) describes the goal.

[12799-12822] [CONTEXT] Menngagde Classification
The path overview reflects Menngagde (man ngag sde, Instruction Class) classification of Dzogchen into cutting through and leapover. This twofold structure organizes all Dzogchen practice into these complementary approaches. The overview provides the map for the detailed instructions to follow.

[12777-12822] [CONCEPT] Path as Two-Pronged Approach
The text conceptualizes the path as having two main approaches: cutting through addresses mind and conceptual fixation; leapover develops luminous appearance and wisdom. Cutting through is primarily "emptiness" oriented; leapover is primarily "appearance" oriented. Together they comprise the complete path of Great Perfection.
