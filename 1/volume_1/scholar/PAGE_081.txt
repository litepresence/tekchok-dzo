[STRUCTURE] Architectural Mapping and Divisions
================================================================================

[2994-3021] [STRUCTURE] This section continues the exposition of False Aspectarian (rnam rdzun pa) Cittamātra from the True Aspectarian (rnam bden pa) discussion on previous pages. The structure follows a threefold analytical framework:

1. **Lines 2994-3001**: Analysis of the nature of perception through the egg-split simile (sgo nga bkas pa), addressing the apparent duality of perceived aspect (rnam pa) and perceiving consciousness (shes pa)

2. **Lines 3002-3008**: Presentation of the monkey-fortress analogy (mkhar gyi nang na spre'u) to illustrate how one consciousness cognizes diverse objects through the five sense doors

3. **Lines 3009-3021**: Division of False Aspectarians into two sub-schools:
   - Those who assert appearance with stains (dri bcas rdzun pa ba)
   - Those who assert pure appearance (dri med dag pa ba)

The section concludes with the assertion that ultimately nothing is established as consciousness (rnam shes su grub pa ni ci yang med), pointing to the dharmakāya.

[PHILOLOGY] Grammatical Analysis and Word Definitions
================================================================================

[2994] [PHILOLOGY] **de 'dzin pa'i shes pa'ang sems las byung bas** — "The consciousness that apprehends that also arises from mind"
- **de 'dzin pa**: Apprehending that (object)
- **shes pa**: Consciousness (cognitive function)
- **sems las byung ba**: Arisen from mind (cittānvaya)
- The particle **'ang** (also) indicates this is extending the previous argument about the perceived object to include the perceiving subject

[2995] [PHILOLOGY] **sgo nga bkas pa** — "Split egg" (egg hatching simile)
- **sgo nga**: Egg
- **bkas pa**: Split, cracked open (past tense of 'gebs)
- This simile illustrates how from one source (the egg/mind), two apparent aspects emerge (the shell halves / perceiver and perceived)

[2996-2998] [PHILOLOGY] **yul 'dzin pa na phyi rnam pa'i shes pa gcig la nang 'dzin byed kyi shes pa gcig shar ba yang / thog ma med pa'i bag chags kyis de ltar gnyis su snang yang / rang rig pa gcig pu las gzhan du grub pa med pas**
- **thog ma med pa'i bag chags**: Beginningless latent tendencies (ādi-anavasthā-vāsanā)
- **rang rig pa gcig pu**: Only self-cognizing awareness (svasaṃvedana)
- **gzhan du grub pa med**: Not established as other (na para-siddha)
- Grammatical construction uses **yang** (although) to set up the apparent paradox: although appearing as two due to beginningless habits, only one self-awareness exists

[3004-3006] [PHILOLOGY] **mkhar gyi nang na spre'u cig 'jug pa myur bas / glo skar bzhir ske rib rib byung nas blta blta ba ltar / sgo lnga la shes pa gcig gis zhugs nas yul rig pa'o**
- **mkhar**: Fortress, castle
- **spre'u**: Monkey
- **glo skar bzhir**: To the four windows (sky-lights)
- **ske rib rib**: Peeking, darting looks
- **sgo lnga**: Five doors (pañca-dvāra, five sense faculties)
- The grammatical structure **ltar** (like, as) introduces the simile

[3010-3014] [PHILOLOGY] **'khrul par snang ba'i bag chags rdzun pa ba**
- **'khrul par snang ba**: Mistaken appearance (bhrānti-pratibhāsa)
- **rdzun pa ba**: False/provisionally real (tathya-asatya)
- Technical distinction: the appearance is false (rdzun pa) but the experiencing (myong ba) is conventionally valid

[3019] [PHILOLOGY] **gnyis su med pa'i ye shes khams kyi yon tan dang bcas pa**
- **gnyis su med pa'i ye shes**: Non-dual primordial wisdom (advaya-jñāna)
- **khams**: Element, nature (dhātu)
- **yon tan dang bcas pa**: Endowed with qualities (guṇa-sahita)
- **tsam zhig**: Merely, only — limiting particle indicating this is the only thing that ultimately exists

[CONTEXT] Citations, History, and Doxography
================================================================================

[2994-3021] [CONTEXT] **Cittamātra School Background**: This section represents the classical Yogācāra philosophical position as developed by Vasubandhu (dbyig gnyen), Dharmapāla (chos skyong), and Sthiramati (blo brtan). The False Aspectarian (rnam rdzun pa = sa-sākāra-vijñāna-vādin) position holds that both the perceived aspect (nimitta) and perceiving consciousness are false/provisionally real.

[2995] [CONTEXT] **The Egg Simile**: This is a traditional Yogācāra metaphor found in Vasubandhu's commentarial tradition. Just as a chick emerges when an egg splits, and the two halves appear distinct but came from one source, so too do perceiver and perceived arise from the single mind. This simile appears in texts like the *Triṃśikā* commentaries.

[2997] [CONTEXT] **Beginningless Latent Tendencies (thog ma med pa'i bag chags)**: This refers to the ālaya-vijñāna (kun gzhi rnam par shes pa) and its latent tendencies that cause the dualistic appearance of subject and object. The concept originates in the *Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra* (dgongs pa nges par 'grel pa'i mdo) and is extensively developed in the Yogācārabhūmi.

[3004] [CONTEXT] **Monkey-Fortress Analogy**: This famous simile appears in various Yogācāra texts, notably in Dharmapāla's commentary on the *Madhyāntavibhāga*. The fortress represents the body, the monkey represents consciousness, and the four windows represent the sense doors. The Yogācārins use this to show that despite the diversity of perceptions, there is only one perceiving consciousness.

[3008] [CONTEXT] **Dream Analogy (rmi lam gyi snang ba)**: The comparison to dream consciousness is fundamental to Yogācāra epistemology. In dreams, the dream appearance and the dream consciousness are not different in nature (gnyid gcig gi shes par tha mi dad pa). This appears in the *Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi* and is cited by Dharmakīrti.

[3015-3021] [CONTEXT] **Division of False Aspectarians**: 
- **dri bcas rdzun pa ba** (Sanskrit: *sā-kaḍuṣṭa-sākāra-vijñāna-vādin*): Those who hold that the appearance aspect is tainted by mental defilements. Associated with some followers of Dharmapāla.
- **dri med dag pa ba** (Sanskrit: *nir-kaḍuṣṭa-sākāra-vijñāna-vādin*): Those who hold that the appearance is pure, like a reflection (gzugs brnyan).

This doxographic division is found in Tibetan Cittamātra commentaries, particularly in works by Ngok Lotsawa (rngog blo ldan shes rab) and the Sakya scholars.

[3019] [CONTEXT] **Non-dual Wisdom (gnyis su med pa'i ye shes)**: This refers to the transformation of the ālaya-vijñāna into the mirror-like wisdom (me long lta bu'i ye shes, ādarśa-jñāna) at Buddhahood. The assertion that ultimately nothing is established as consciousness points to the dharmakāya (chos sku), which transcends all conceptual categories including consciousness.

[CONCEPT] Breaking Down Complex Ideas
================================================================================

[2994-2998] [CONCEPT] **The Apparent Duality of Perception**: The text addresses a fundamental epistemological problem: when we perceive an object, there appears to be a duality between the perceiver (subject) and the perceived (object). The Cittamātra analysis reveals this duality is illusory. When you look at a mountain (yul), where exactly is the boundary between the seeing and the seen? Can you find a point where "seeing" ends and "the mountain" begins? The Yogācārins argue that both arise simultaneously from the same mind-stuff, like two halves of a split egg.

**Key Insight**: The apparent duality is not in the reality itself but in the mode of appearance (snang tshul), caused by beginningless habitual tendencies that project a subject-object structure onto what is actually a single continuum of awareness.

[2999-3001] [CONCEPT] **Objection and Response**: An objector asks: If both outer-perceived-aspect consciousness and inner-apprehending consciousness arise simultaneously from one mind, doesn't this create two conceptual cognitions (rtog gnyis cig car 'gyur)? 

The response is subtle: The aspect-consciousness (rnam pa'i shes pa) is non-conceptual (rtog med). Therefore, there is no conflict. This preserves the single-stream-of-consciousness model while accounting for the apparent duality in perception.

[3002-3008] [CONCEPT] **The Unity of Consciousness Across Senses**: The monkey-fortress simile illustrates a profound point: your consciousness is not fragmented into five separate consciousnesses (eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, etc.). Rather, one consciousness operates through five sense doors. The monkey doesn't become five monkeys when it looks through four windows—it's still the same monkey. Similarly, when you simultaneously see, hear, and feel, it's one awareness manifesting in multiple modes.

**The Dream Analogy**: Just as in a dream, both the dream appearance (horse, mountain, person) and the dream consciousness appear distinct, yet both are equally the nature of the sleep-consciousness (gnyid shes), so in waking life, perceiver and perceived are equally the nature of one mind.

[3009-3014] [CONCEPT] **False Appearance (rnam rdzun pa) Explained**: The False Aspectarian holds that the external object aspect (phyi don yi rnam pa) that appears to consciousness is a mistaken appearance caused by false latent tendencies ('khrul par snang ba'i bag chags rdzun pa ba). However, this does not mean there is no valid cognition. The experiencing itself (myong ba) is conventionally valid; what is false is the imputation of an external, truly established object.

**Critical Distinction**: This is not nihilism. The Cittamātra is not saying "nothing exists." It's saying: appearances exist but not as they appear to. The appearance of externality is false; the appearance itself (as mental content) is provisionally real.

[3015-3021] [CONCEPT] **Two Sub-schools of False Aspectarians**:

1. **Appearance with Stains (dri bcas rdzun pa ba)**: Holds that the diverse appearances we experience now (white, red, various forms) are mental defilements (blo'i dri ma) projected onto the ultimate non-dual wisdom. This is like seeing colors through a stained glass—the colors appear real but are actually the stain.

2. **Pure Appearance (dri med dag pa ba)**: Holds that even the appearance aspect is ultimately unreal (brdzun pa tsam du'ang grub pa med). All that ultimately exists is self-cognizing awareness experiencing itself (so so rang gi rig pa'i ye shes). The appearances are like reflections in a mirror—clearly manifesting but having no substantial existence.

**Ultimate Point**: The Buddha's dharmakāya (chos sku) has nothing remaining (lhag ma med pa) in the sense that no conceptual category, including "consciousness" or "wisdom," can capture its nature. It is beyond all elaboration.

[3021] [CONCEPT] **Dharmakāya as Ultimate Truth**: The conclusion points to the dharmakāya not as "something" but as the exhaustion of all conceptual fabrication. When all false appearances are removed, what remains is not another "thing" called dharmakāya—rather, the absence of fabrication IS the dharmakāya. Like space: it's not that space "is something"; space is the absence of obstruction.

SCHOLAR NOTES
================================================================================

- The page number in the original Tibetan text would be folio 41a (front)
- This section follows the standard Cittamātra doxography found in Tibetan grub mtha' literature
- Longchenpa's presentation is distinctive in how it leads the Cittamātra analysis toward the dzogchen view of dharmakāya
- The egg simile is particularly significant as it shows the non-dual nature of subject-object while still accounting for apparent duality
