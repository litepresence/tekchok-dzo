For many stacked letters: give 'greng bu and na-ro downwards successively, then read with gu-gu. Klad kor is placed above the lower one.

**Significance [5622-5625]:**
This letter location (*yi ge'i gnas*) binds the contents of seventeen tantras. Wherever tantras arise, understand accordingly. These stacked letter examples arise from Samantabhadra's mind mirror.

[5626] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Preamble Topics
**Analysis:** Line 5626 marks the transition from letter analysis to preamble (*gleng gzhi*) topics:

The text states that knowing this letter wheel arrangement (*yi ge 'khor lo'i rim pa*) is crucial for understanding the tantras' difficult points. Therefore, it has been properly established here. This marks the end of the letter analysis section and the beginning of the second major topic: explanation of the preambles' definite enumerations.
