[L1-25] [STRUCTURE] Citation from the Treasury and Transition
**Analysis:** The section concludes with a citation from the Treasury itself: "From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle (Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod las)/showing through symbols including the method of reversing delusion/the tenth chapter." This marks the completion of the tenth chapter on reversing delusion. The text then transitions: "having thus shown the sequence of how to reverse delusion from the ground/now the manner of body formation during delusion will be shown." This introduces the next major section on embryology.

[L26-39] [CONTEXT] Embryonic Development: The Four Wombs
**Analysis:** The text explains that generally there are individual body manifestations for each of the three realms and six classes of beings, but here focuses on humans. The explanation combines the four types of birth (skye ba bzhi) with womb birth (mngal nas btsa' ba). The citation from *Nyida Khasbyor* begins the embryonic development teaching: "from the causal conditions of father and mother/mer mer po and nur nur po/ltar ltar po and gor gor po/the solidifying one and fish-like/turtle-like and frog-like/thus seven weeks of days/from the navel, bodies are produced/after nine months and ten days/bodies complete, emerge from mother's womb/thus forms are different/samsara from samsara." This describes the kalala (mer mer po), arbuda (nur nur po), pesi (ltar ltar po), ghana (gor gor po), and subsequent stages.

[L1-13] [PHILOLOGY] First Stage: Desire and Coition
**Analysis:** The detailed explanation begins: first the gandharva consciousness (dri za nye bar 'jug pa'i sems) comes seeking a body (lus 'tshol ba'i phyir 'ongs pa). Father and mother unite ('du 'phrod byed pa 'dzom nas), entering through the mother's lower path (ma'i bshang lam nas zhugs). The father's white essence (pha'i dngas ma dkar po) - the size of a mustard seed (yungs 'bru tsam), clear like mercury (dngul chu lta bu) - dissolves into the mother's red essence (ma'i rigs can gyi rtsa'i dngas ma dmar po). The basis for body formation (lus chags pa'i rten) is the space-like emptiness ('byung ba bzhi las stong pa ma nam mkha' ltar gnas pa).

[L14-27] [CONCEPT] The Seed Syllables and Element Formation
**Analysis:** From the father's and mother's afflictive natures (rang bzhin gyi nyon mongs pa) and wind from the channel-leaf (rtsa 'dab kyi rlung), the mind of desire moves ('dod pa'i sems g.yos pas). From the natural sound of the seed syllable wind at the channel-basis (rtsa gnas kyi yi ge'i rlung gi rang sgra yaM), fire desire (me'i 'dod pa) actually increases (dngos su mched nas). The sound RAM moves as a coarse sound (rag sgra g.yos pas), blazing and transforming ('bar zhing 'gyur ba). That desire goes to attachment (chags par song bas), cause-desire and condition-attachment ('dod pa rgyu dang chags ba rkyen gnyis) meet ('dzom). The actual entering is water desire (dngos su 'jug pa chu'i 'dod pa), with mutual gazing, laughing, embracing, etc.
