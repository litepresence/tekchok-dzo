[4728] Listening, exercising the wisdom of the state.
[4729] Upadesha elaboration, word-upadesha cast into words—meaning does not reach immediately.

[4741] Depending on that meaning—liberates to the Buddha level.
[4742] Clarity:
[4743] Knowledge clear—abides nowhere.
[4744] Faculty clear—distinguishes dharma and non-dharma.
[4745] Five faculties placed in themselves—the six aggregates merely tremble.
[4746] Holding those—transcend the three realms.
[4747] Entering emptiness, entering appearances—appearance-mind mouth-joined.
[4748] Entering appearance-emptiness—object and mind non-dual.
[4749] Self-liberated—uncontrived.
[4750] Expert:

[4752] Expert in action and completion: merely examining mind accomplishes without need for mantra and samādhi—steals life-force.
[4753] Expert in time mantra and samādhi: deity approaches, siddhis arise.
[4754] Expert in time approach-accomplish action-application: accomplishes self-wished benefits.

[4756] Thus established, from those:
[4757] For those liking mental elaboration—all shown.
