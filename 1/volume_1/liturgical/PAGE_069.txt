[2428] Thus spoke: "Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates."
[2429] The outsiders' philosophical positions are now explained.
[2430] Second, the extensive division of transcendent vehicles has three aspects:
[2431] The method superior to outsiders,
[2432] The general explanation of categories,
[2433] And the extensive particular explanation.
[2434] First: accepting the four dharma-seal mudras and going for refuge to the Three Jewels—this is superior, for outsiders' paths lack this.
[2435] The four mudras are: all compounded things impermanent,
[2436] All with defilements suffering,
[2437] All dharmas empty and selfless,
[2438] Liberation from suffering peaceful.
[2439] Second has five aspects:
[2440] Essence,
[2441] Definition,
[2442] Division,
[2443] Purpose,
[2444] And effect.
[2445] The essence of the transcendent vehicle:
[2446] That dharma-category which is the supreme method for definitely exiting saṃsāra.
[2447] Definition: that which, when entered, produces happiness.
[2448] From the Compendium:
[2449] Mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—
[2450] Joy, happiness, bliss, accomplishing supreme virtue.
[2451] This vehicle, like space, a measureless great palace.
[2452] Thus it is said.
[2453] Division:
[2454] Small and great, two;
[2455] Or hearer, self-enlightened, and bodhisattva vehicles, three—
[2456] Inconceivable, regarding disciples' minds.
[2457] From the Lankāvatāra:
[2458] As long as mind engages,
[2459] The vehicle's limits are endless.
[2460] Thus it is said.
[2461] Purpose: accomplishing temporary and ultimate meanings.
[2462] Effect: definitely exiting the three realms, obtaining liberation.
[2463] Third: extensive particular explanation.
[2464] From Rigpa Rangshar, the vehicle divisions are thus:
[2465] Sūtra and great extensive,
[2466] And also the great extensive.
[2467] The great extensive:
[2468] Eighty-four thousand inconceivable,
[2469] Extensively numbered, many and great,
[2470] Inconceivable, measureless,
[2471] Inexpressible, thought-transcending, great.
[2472] Thus the great victor.
[2473] Inexpressible, transcending thought, great.
[2474] Thus the great victor.
