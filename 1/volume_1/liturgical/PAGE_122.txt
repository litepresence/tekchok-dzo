[4566] Like a minister turning the reins,
[4567] Self-arisen holds view-meditation-conduct's basis.
[4568] Like subjects doing service and tax,
[4569] Self-liberated liberates that very meaning.
[4570] Those three gathered, like ruling the kingdom—
[4571] Rules all tantra sections.

[4577] Like seeing low valleys: the purpose of knowing all tantra sections' inner meanings.
[4578] THIRD: TANTRAS' THREE FLOWERS
[4579] Pearl garland,
[4580] Auspicious beauty,
[4581] Lion power, dzogchen—three.

[4584] FOURTH: TANTRAS' ONE SUMMARY
[4585] Perfect self-arisen.

[4588] FIFTH: TANTRAS' APPEARANCE, DEPTH COMPLETE
