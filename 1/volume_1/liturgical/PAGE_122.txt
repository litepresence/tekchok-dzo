FIRST SECTION: TANTRAS' THREE HEART ESSENCES

Rigpa self-arisen,

Self-liberated, letterless—three.

Knowing these three, like a king ruling people—

Rules tantra-general's meaning.

That too, letterless: shows tantra-general's upadesha.

Like a minister turning the reins,

Self-arisen holds view-meditation-conduct's basis.

Like subjects doing service and tax,

Self-liberated liberates that very meaning.

Those three gathered, like ruling the kingdom—

Rules all tantra sections.

SECOND: TANTRAS' THREE ESSENCES

Samantabhadra mind-mirror,

Vajra-sattva heart-mirror,

Jewel spread—three.

Knowing these three, reaching three mountains' peaks,

Like seeing low valleys: the purpose of knowing all tantra sections' inner meanings.

THIRD: TANTRAS' THREE FLOWERS

Pearl garland,

Auspicious beauty,

Lion power, dzogchen—three.

Knowing these three, like three suns rising in the sky clearing world's darkness:

The purpose of understanding tantra's meaning and words without delusion.

FOURTH: TANTRAS' ONE SUMMARY

Perfect self-arisen.

Like a fort's foundation well-laid, many roofs can be erected above:

The purpose of knowing the liberation's basis as firm.

FIFTH: TANTRAS' APPEARANCE, DEPTH COMPLETE

Introduction adorned, like reaching a fort's peak unpenetrable by armies:

The purpose of not fearing samsara's place.

SIXTH: WISDOM, BATTLE-TURNED TANTRAS

Sun-moon joined:

The purpose of turning intermediate delusion.

SEVENTH: LIMBS' TWO TANTRAS

Jewel heap,

Body-relic blazing.
