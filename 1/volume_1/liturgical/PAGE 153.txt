[5936] The bases are of five types,
[5937] The abodes are held to be of three types.
[5938] This is the meaning.
[5939] Also from the Ratnaketu:
[5940] Dharmakāya, self-pure grasping,
[5941] Within the self-pure elaborationless celestial palace,
[5942] To the retinue of appearances inseparable from itself,
[5943] By means of signless speech,
[5944] Elaborationless dharmas,
[5945] Arise from mind as non-abiding, self-exhausted.
[5946] Without spoken, without speech,
[5947] Shown in the state of great equality.
[5948] By Saṃbhogakāya, self-clear and pure,
[5949] From the pure celestial palace of five lights,
[5950] By means of elaborationless great bliss speech,
[5951] To the retinue of the five kāyas and families,
[5952] Entityless, pure dharmas
[5953] Arise from mind as five wisdoms gathered.
[5954] From the tongue spreading pure light-rays,
[5955] The six self-arisen letters also,
[5956] Great self-arisen shown without speaking.
[5957] By Nirmāṇakāya without attachment,
[5958] Dharma also from the disciple's own abode,
[5959] To the fortunate awakened from the six families,
[5960] By means of speech with words and elaborations,
[5961] Whatever dharmas faculties desire,
[5962] From mind, self-clear mindfulness,
[5963] Spread upon the tongue of faculties without desire,
[5964] Shown as dharmas of numbered vehicles.
[5965] Thus by the excellent explanation of three kāyas and speech,
[5966] The minds of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and
[5967] All Buddhas are satisfied;
[5968] Thus the hopes of beings are fulfilled.
[5969] Thus it is spoken.
[5970] Thus, when the meaning and purpose of the two prologues shown are arranged:
[5971] "Thus at one time I taught" means
[5972] Vajrapāṇi, having promised "I shall teach the retinue completely what I heard from glorious Samantabhadra before," or
[5973] Vajrapāṇi himself, accepting to be the teacher of the tantra, taught to the retinue saying "I taught."
[5974] From the Thalgyur:
[5975] The teacher's speech reveals to the retinue.
[5976] Thus it is spoken.
[5977] That also, Vajradhara is Buddha;
[5978] From the Śrīparamādi:
[5979] Buddha before all Buddhas,
[5980] Vajradhara, king, vajra-mind.
[5981] Thus it is spoken.
