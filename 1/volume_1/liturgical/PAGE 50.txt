00001| [1623] Formless khams from mindfulness excess arisen, and
00002| [1624] Desire's khams from mindfulness separate holding arisen, thus.
00003| [1625] Second: Internal mind appearance-potency from self-nature arising:
00004| [1626] Rig-pa existing, to that obscuring self-potency ignorance ālaya,
00005| [1627] And that supporting ālaya consciousness's mind,
00006| [1628] Mind and faculties gates five's knowing arisen:
00007| [1629] Like gold ground Tal-tree grown, branches and flowers and leaves arisen.
00008| [1630] This dividing: object,
00009| [1631] Faculty-cognition,
00010| [1632] Feeling three.
00011| [1633] Object: here cognition six's previous mere cognition now object designated, thus faculty-basis six name expressed,
00012| [1634] Faculty-basis eye and so forth basis's sound understanding expressed, thus cognition eye and so forth khams designated six.
00013| [1635] Faculty-cognition:
00014| [1636] Eye and so forth's now cognition six.
00015| [1637] Feeling:
00016| [1638] Future portion type six.
00017| [1639] Object whatever consciousness enters,
00018| [1640] Previous cognition six whichever continuum existing: object called.
00019| [1641] That itself immediate that's nature holding: now's cognition.
00020| [1642] That after pleasure pain neutral whichever feeling gathering: contact's feeling called.
00021| [1643] That-also object and cognition gathering from that's nature feeling.
00022| [1644] Thus six-group three from types eighteen dividing:
00023| [1645] That itself from,
00024| [1646] Mind itself from arisen khams:
00025| [1647] Cognition self-clear portion from arisen eye's khams,
00026| [1648] Cognition single-pointed from arisen ear's khams,
00027| [1649] Cognition limitless from arisen nose's khams,
00028| [1650] Cognitions one gathering from arisen tongue's khams,
00029| [1651] Cognition all entering from arisen mind's khams,
00030| [1652] Cognitions basis making from arisen body's khams,
