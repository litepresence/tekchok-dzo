[1623] Formless khams from mindfulness excess arisen, and
[1624] Desire's khams from mindfulness separate holding arisen, thus.
[1625] Second: Internal mind appearance-potency from self-nature arising:
[1626] Rig-pa existing, to that obscuring self-potency ignorance ālaya,
[1627] And that supporting ālaya consciousness's mind,
[1628] Mind and faculties gates five's knowing arisen:
[1629] Like gold ground Tal-tree grown, branches and flowers and leaves arisen.
[1630] This dividing: object,
[1631] Faculty-cognition,
[1632] Feeling three.
[1633] Object: here cognition six's previous mere cognition now object designated, thus faculty-basis six name expressed,
[1634] Faculty-basis eye and so forth basis's sound understanding expressed, thus cognition eye and so forth khams designated six.
[1635] Faculty-cognition:
[1636] Eye and so forth's now cognition six.
[1637] Feeling:
[1638] Future portion type six.
[1639] Object whatever consciousness enters,
[1640] Previous cognition six whichever continuum existing: object called.
[1641] That itself immediate that's nature holding: now's cognition.
[1642] That after pleasure pain neutral whichever feeling gathering: contact's feeling called.
[1643] That-also object and cognition gathering from that's nature feeling.
[1644] Thus six-group three from types eighteen dividing:
[1645] That itself from,
[1646] Mind itself from arisen khams:
[1647] Cognition self-clear portion from arisen eye's khams,
[1648] Cognition single-pointed from arisen ear's khams,
[1649] Cognition limitless from arisen nose's khams,
[1650] Cognitions one gathering from arisen tongue's khams,
[1651] Cognition all entering from arisen mind's khams,
[1652] Cognitions basis making from arisen body's khams,
