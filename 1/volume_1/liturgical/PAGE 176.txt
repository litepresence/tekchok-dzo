[7024] From the Rangshar:
[7025] "The defect of not obtaining empowerment is like this:
[7026] Fainting in the intermediate state,
[7027] Fear,
[7028] Suffocation,
[7029] Obstacles,
[7030] And losing perception arise.
[7031] Even until not abandoning the body of latent tendencies, not being seen as worthy of honor by beings,
[7032] Little merit,
[7033] Short life,
[7034] Few enjoyments of livelihood,
[7035] Close mouth,
[7036] Many obstacles arise;
[7037] All actions are not accomplished.
[7038] That is the defect of not obtaining empowerment for secret mantra practice.
[7039] The yogi of secret mantra practice should obtain empowerment.
[7040] If empowerment is not obtained, even a Buddha is unable to turn the Dharma wheel on the ground of the Tathāgata.
[7041] If the wheel is not turned, by the compassion-emanation-kāya, unable to do benefit for beings.
[7042] Therefore, the practitioner of secret mantra should obtain empowerment."
[7043] Third, the place where to confer:
[7044] Secluded, pleasing, and near to siddhi.
[7045] Here, general abode—auspicious, with good earth examination, good forest, etc.;
[7046] From four particular abodes:
[7047] The abode of elaborations—if the student's body is earth, protect north from south expanse.
[7048] If water, protect west from east expanse.
[7049] If fire, protect east from west expanse.
[7050] If wind, protect south from north expanse.
[7051] The abode without elaboration:
[7052] In dense forest ravines, follow shapes and marks suitable to the student's elements.
[7053] For extreme without elaboration, the peak of a mountain where three valleys gather is supreme good.
[7054] For complete without elaboration, very secluded or hermitage, beyond one league from town.
[7055] For all four empowerments, abodes where other beings fear, wild carnivores reside,
[7056] Poisonous snakes,
[7057] Cemeteries and charnel grounds, etc.
