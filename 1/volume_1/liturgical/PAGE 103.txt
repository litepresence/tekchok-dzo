[3809] Through mind without cause-sign, the non-dual object of desire.

[3810] Second:

[3811] Through not relying on nine vehicles, exertion's progression abandoned,

[3812] Though appearances arise as manifold, liberation from one—self-nature arising without cessation, so-called.

[3813] That too, the perfect completion stage's accomplishment ultimate:

[3814] Self-appearance, directionless, all-pervasively self-arising,

[3815] Whatever not rejected, completely perfected,

[3816] Basis of all phenomena, in whatever direction, not exceeded.

[3817] Dharmatā arising in manifold, even in India, not exhausted.

[3818] Third:

[3819] Appearance drawn into mind, self-awareness rays clearly manifest,

[3820] Appearance not rejected, completely perfected,

[3821] Mind's continuity rays, through recollection-meditation clearly manifest, recollection-meditation perfected in dharmatā, continuity emptied and purified, so-called.

[3822] Perception-awareness entering, through non-dual relation's severance, saṃsāra's essence completely liberated, so-called.

[3823] Desire self-arising's Great Perfection:

[3824] Through view non-being, beyond conceptual imputation,

[3825] Through meditation non-being, without acceptance-rejection-negation-establishment,

[3826] Through conduct non-being, action liberated in dharmatā,

[3827] Through result non-being, non-attainment abides in itself.

[3828] Among these, when analyzed:

[3829] Enumeration is beyond measure.

[3830] Spreading key-points, that itself's vast compassion:

[3831] Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's dharmas, arising in perception-awareness kāya and jñāna, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa wherever not divided—dharmatā, so-called.

[3832] That too, through the unchanging mark's perception-awareness dual-proliferation, saṃsāra is reversed.

[3833] Self-face clearly-seen's key-point, through recollection-meditation self-other proliferation, thought completely purified, so-called.

[3834] Through outer-inner object's non-existence, bliss non-conceptual—awakening, so-called.

[3835] Through freedom from action, mind liberated,

[3836] Through self-knowing investigation, bliss-suffering equal-taste, so-called.

[3837] These too, gathered, are collected into three.
