[6020] Knowing this much, in order to know the structure and understood meaning of the tantras, it is arranged and established here in this context.
[6021] Third meaning: the prophecy of the sacred definitive teaching—
[6022] The teaching of vajra-essence,
[6023] The seed-kāya of the teaching,
[6024] The self-arisen letter,
[6025] The three vajras,
[6026] The sequence of persons holding these, arising before and after—
[6027] Showing these three meanings: the manner of the teaching's descent generally shown,
[6028] Its flourishing and decline explained in particular,
[6029] The persons who hold it shown.
[6030] First:
[6031] At the time of the arrangement of the great Brahma aeon by primordial Samantabhadra,
[6032] From that blessing, the Buddha-emanation Vajradhara arose from dharmakāya to saṃbhogakāya;
[6033] At the time of the kāyas such as Vairocana, arranging the great Brahma aeon,
[6034] Acting for the benefit of disciples through various emanation-kāyas—
[6035] At the beginning of that aeon, the actual teaching of Great Perfection to dharmakāya,
[6036] The teaching-sound of saṃbhogakāya self-sounding,
[6037] Acting for benefit through the manifestation-appearance of emanation-kāya,
[6038] And the vajra arisen from that blessing,
[6039] The texts,
[6040] The kāya images gradually descended,
[6041] Holding the actual and reflected teaching—
[6042] The spontaneous arising of benefit for sentient beings from Buddha:
[6043] From the aeon of the first emanation's awakening,
[6044] Before this field was formed at that time, going as emanation to other fields and acting for benefit,
[6045] Now acting for benefit through the appearance of a thousand Buddhas in this Saha field—these are the blessings of the three.
[6046] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6047] The seventeen definitive secret commands,
[6048] Together with the teaching's light-arrow and miraculous letter,
[6049] At the beginning of the emanation-kāya's field,
[6050] Teacher Samantabhadra,
[6051] Held in the place of dense array.
[6052] Then in the abode of Tuṣita,
[6053] Rigpa-Vairocana,
[6054] Holding this, ripened the five rigpas.
[6055] Past that, held by me,
[6056] The sacred life-tree of the teaching—
[6057] A thousand Buddhas and two roots,
[6058] Relying upon this, definitively arise.
[6059] Miraculous and egg-born,
[6060] Warmth and womb-born,
[6061] Ripen sentient beings.
[6062] From this very teaching of disciples,
[6063] Twelve Dharma wheels arose.
[6064] By this, thirty-six deeds
