[8223] Like the thigh of deer king Eṇaya, channel enters thinly.
[8224] To this, like Eṇaya's thin thigh, expanding.
[8225] Instruction of drawing channel is most important.
[8226] Elephant-nose:
[8227] Like elephant nose, upward reversed.
[8228] To this, instruction of attracting is most important.
[8229] Cow-possessed:
[8230] Channel concealed from sleep, mind without stain.
[8231] To this, instruction of refining channel is most important.
[8232] Conch-possessed:
[8233] Like conch spiraling right.
[8234] To this, instruction of extracting channel is most important.
[8235] Those five also are certain as five, for holding the five wisdom families.
[8236] For making bliss the path, none surpass lotus-possessed.
[8237] That, covered by five family-possessed, actual bodhicitta does not arise in women.
[8238] In men bindu arises; without five family channels, actually able to extract.
[8239] Actual red bodhicitta not arising is due to not having five family-possessed.
[8240] Channel mouth not changing from special place is the cause.
[8241] Channel runs upward, nose-blood flows from right nose-hole.
[8242] Man: age, youth arrived.
[8243] Body: without arising disease.
[8244] That deer-possessed accomplishes body increase.
[8245] Conch-possessed accomplishes speech increase.
[8246] Elephant-nose accomplishes mind increase.
[8247] Cow-possessed accomplishes mind increase.
[8248] Lotus-possessed accomplishes bliss expanding in body.
[8249] From the Great Empowerment Arrangement:
[8250] "All women five family-possessed,
[8251] That arrangement great bliss,
[8252] Yoginī siddhi complete."
[8253] Thus it is spoken.
[8254] Completely perfect family:
[8255] Ordinary family of common siddhi arising,
[8256] Two ḍākinīs of supreme siddhi arising family.
[8257] Ordinary:
[8258] Wide eyes,
[8259] Hair spiraling right,
[8260] Lower lip excess.
[8261] Looking from left: smiles,
[8262] Looking from right: nine manifest,
[8263] Looking from front: very straight.
[8264] Ḍākinī:
[8265] Hair flowing upward,
[8266] Wide cheeks, thin limbs,
[8267] Long eyes.
[8268] That: complete empowerment.
[8269] Examine two of special supreme family.
[8270] Obtain bliss by connection of method and wisdom.
[8271] This becomes giving supreme certainty scripture.
[8272] Thus it is spoken.
[8273] That also: completing special wisdom from common nature of knowledge-woman.
[8274] Certain term:
[8275] Knowing directly the wisdom of rigpa, thus rigpa.
[8276] "Ma" called: in the world, without relying on ma, none.
[8277] Like earth ground, without relying on knowledge-woman, Buddha does not arise.
[8278] Some explain as "dharani."
[8279] Dharani of mind's bliss arises relying on body, thus dharani.
[8280] This, by mastering, increases body dharani.
[8281] Ma is like sky.
[8282] Like: without world realm relying on sky.
[8283] Some name "mudra."
[8284] Mudra: holding.
[8285] Holding from saṃsāra to Buddha level.
[8286] Gya: sealing, sealing saṃsāra with bodhi.
[8287] Ma is like life food.
[8288] Like dying without food.
[8289] Realization not arising without relying on mudra.
[8290] Binding in three realms if that does not arise.
[8291] That division:
[8292] Outer five families,
[8293] Inner five,
[8294] Secret five,
[8295] Two completely perfect—seventeen.
[8296] From that:
[8297] "Family examination seventeen,
[8298] Wisdom sequence similar to that."
[8299] Thus it is spoken.
[8300] Second, examining shape:
[8301] Thin waist, flexible body.
[8302] Thin limbs, possessing shining fingernails.
[8303] Body abiding straight.
[8304] Small body mass—sign of bliss expanding body.
[8305] From that:
[8306] "Not long, short,
[8307] Not frowning, smiling."
[8308] Thus it is spoken.
[8309] Third, examining color:
[8310] Not very white,
[8311] Not black.
