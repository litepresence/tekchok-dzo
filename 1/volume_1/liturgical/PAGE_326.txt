[13381] Sixty-two letters, one hundred twenty-four,
[13382] Sixty-two lights,
[13383] One hundred eighty-six,
[13384] Samantabhadra father and mother combined—one hundred twenty-four,
[13385] Upon the producing-action-first wheel,
[13386] Three hundred ten distinctions of wisdom's movement.
[13387] By pure wisdom's wind, jumping, dissolving, and so forth,
[13388] The actions of calm-abiding and insight are certainly realized—thus "producing-action" is named,
[13389] Being the basis of existence-body, thus "first" is named.
[13390] Thus being the basis of all, thus "wheel" is named.
[13391] Special dharmas of elements, wind and so forth's enumeration,
[13392] By affliction and action's work, by karmic wind's throwing,
[13393] Inhaling,
[13394] Laughing,
[13395] Holding—thus day and night are determined.
[13396] Thus nine hundred thirty distinction-dharmas abiding are the basis of empowerment-path certainty, arose from this.
[13397] That also, from water-element wheel turning by twelve dependent-originations,
[13398] Eighty-five thousand insects abide.
[13399] Each of those, within that many channels, that many letters—
[13400] From each wind-throwing, none missing,
[13401] Each body abiding, thus countless gathering-dharmas.
[13402] Basis-of-all is the basis of all,
[13403] And also the basis of purification.
[13404] Thus it is said.
[13405] Then the basis-of-all body's support and these two mixed,
[13406] From day forty-six, by individual elements' action's power,
[13407] The wheel of gathering-memory complete and gathered,
[13408] Fire-particles and so forth increase,
[13409] Bliss-suffering feelings increase,
[13410] Perception and sense-bases,
[13411] Consciousness entering objects' distinction increases.
