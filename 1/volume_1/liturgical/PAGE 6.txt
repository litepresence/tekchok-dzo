[163] From the Sutra Entering the Inconceivable Buddha Realm and Wisdom:
[164] The gods and humans of the three-thousandfold world are few indeed;
[165] The outsider sages with clairvoyance who see sentient beings across a chariot-wheel's extent of earth—more numerous still.
[166] Than those seeing three-thousandfold worlds, the shravakas' eight liberations surpass;
[167] A single meditator's vision spanning chariot-wheels—more vast by far.
[168] Than those seeing three-thousandfold worlds, the bodhisattvas' eight liberations surpass;
[169] A single meditator's vision spanning chariot-wheels—more vast by far.
[170] Than all these, the Tathagata's eye beholds across chariot-wheels' earth-extent—supremely vast, thus spoke the Lord.
[171] Thus throughout the sky-pervading realms, sentient beings pervade all space;
[172] Buddha's emanations fill them all, enacting benefit throughout.
[173] Some directly accomplish purposes through Samantabhadra's emanation as Teacher;
[174] Others accomplish purposes through Buddhas of different tantras—
[175] Yet all arose from first receiving the path shown by Samantabhadra, generating bodhicitta.
[176] Thus Samantabhadra's purpose-making through tantra is proclaimed.
[177] In certain treatises this sequence appears:
[178] From Buddha comes Dharma, from Dharma the Arya hosts;
[179] Such is the meaning of this order proclaimed.
[180] Second: Regarding Vajradhara's attainment of peace in this realm—
[181] Some hold the first Protector
[182] Taught beings of different tantras to generate mind—this view is invalid,
[183] For the Magical Vajra declares:
[184] "First Buddha, Buddha of earth,
[185] Great hero and great destroyer,"
[186] Thus proclaiming;
[187] "This Teacher is Vajradhara,
[188] Buddha before all Buddhas,"
[189] Thus spoke the Lord—contradicting that other view.
[190] Therefore for beings' sake in this realm, Samantabhadra first displayed emanations teaching ordinary beings to generate mind, then demonstrated Buddhahood and opened the great play of enlightened activity.
[191] Such manner is renowned in common sutras as well:
