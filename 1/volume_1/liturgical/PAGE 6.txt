00001| [163] From the Sutra Entering the Inconceivable Buddha Realm and Wisdom:
00002| [164] The gods and humans of the three-thousandfold world are few indeed;
00003| [165] The outsider sages with clairvoyance who see sentient beings across a chariot-wheel's extent of earth—more numerous still.
00004| [166] Than those seeing three-thousandfold worlds, the shravakas' eight liberations surpass;
00005| [167] A single meditator's vision spanning chariot-wheels—more vast by far.
00006| [168] Than those seeing three-thousandfold worlds, the bodhisattvas' eight liberations surpass;
00007| [169] A single meditator's vision spanning chariot-wheels—more vast by far.
00008| [170] Than all these, the Tathagata's eye beholds across chariot-wheels' earth-extent—supremely vast, thus spoke the Lord.
00009| [171] Thus throughout the sky-pervading realms, sentient beings pervade all space;
00010| [172] Buddha's emanations fill them all, enacting benefit throughout.
00011| [173] Some directly accomplish purposes through Samantabhadra's emanation as Teacher;
00012| [174] Others accomplish purposes through Buddhas of different tantras—
00013| [175] Yet all arose from first receiving the path shown by Samantabhadra, generating bodhicitta.
00014| [176] Thus Samantabhadra's purpose-making through tantra is proclaimed.
00015| [177] In certain treatises this sequence appears:
00016| [178] From Buddha comes Dharma, from Dharma the Arya hosts;
00017| [179] Such is the meaning of this order proclaimed.
00018| [180] Second: Regarding Vajradhara's attainment of peace in this realm—
00019| [181] Some hold the first Protector
00020| [182] Taught beings of different tantras to generate mind—this view is invalid,
00021| [183] For the Magical Vajra declares:
00022| [184] "First Buddha, Buddha of earth,
00023| [185] Great hero and great destroyer,"
00024| [186] Thus proclaiming;
00025| [187] "This Teacher is Vajradhara,
00026| [188] Buddha before all Buddhas,"
00027| [189] Thus spoke the Lord—contradicting that other view.
00028| [190] Therefore for beings' sake in this realm, Samantabhadra first displayed emanations teaching ordinary beings to generate mind, then demonstrated Buddhahood and opened the great play of enlightened activity.
00029| [191] Such manner is renowned in common sutras as well:
