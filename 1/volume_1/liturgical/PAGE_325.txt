[13357] [13357] Each one with eight channel-petals, thirty-two abiding in the body whole—
[13358] [13358] From the river of existence grasped by twelve limbs' substance, existence body's basis arose.
[13359] [13359] Thus from thirty-two channels, thirty-two wisdoms' work arises,
[13360] [13360] From essence arising with four lamps' ultimate bindu and ripeness,
[13361] [13361] When bliss is made the path, through forceful method buddhahood is certain.
[13362] [13362] From their impurity arises the conventional bindu,
[13363] [13363] Arising with four elements' ripeness,
[13364] [13364] From that suffering enters the self-continuum, samsara's seed increasing.
[13365] [13365] Yet depending on the channel's vital point, when made the path,
[13366] [13366] The excellent bliss of dharmata is directly realized.
[13367] [13367] These channels become the path of primordial wisdom,
[13368] [13368] Gone to the nature of bindu,
[13369] [13369] Doing the work of bliss and suffering's experience.
[13370] [13370] Then again from day thirty-five, by individual elements' work's power,
[13371] [13371] Completing the connection of producing action's first work,
[13372] [13372] From form gathering and expanding into countless aggregates, the five aggregates' race manifestly projected.
[13373] [13373] Then until day forty-two, by two elements gathering's work,
[13374] [13374] As producing action, eighty-two thousand water-insects' body increased.
[13375] [13375] Upon that wheel, work was done showing sixty-two channel-petals—
[13376] [13376] Cause of sixty-two eons' birth-decrease arising.
[13377] [13377] Within each channel, one special channel-abode letter,
[13378] [13378] One light-mass supporting that,
[13379] [13379] Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abide.
[13380] [13380] Thus also sixty-two channel-tips,
