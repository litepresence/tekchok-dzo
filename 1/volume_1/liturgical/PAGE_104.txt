[3838] [3838] The space free from action, through non-doing, is liberated into the dharmatā of self-liberation—
[3839] [3839] Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation.
[3840] [3840] Thus it is said.
[3841] [3841] The space of ornament:
[3842] [3842] Appearance is the continuity of mind,
[3843] [3843] The ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty, so it is called.
[3844] [3844] Furthermore:
[3845] [3845] Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived.
[3846] [3846] Thus it is said.
[3847] [3847] The space of play:
[3848] [3848] The play without direction, unceasing, arises,
[3849] [3849] The transformation of appearance and mind does not occur, so it is called.
[3850] [3850] Furthermore:
[3851] [3851] For the sake of liberating all into the completely pure path.
[3852] [3852] Thus it is said.
[3853] [3853] The space of dharmatā:
[3854] [3854] Abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not,
[3855] [3855] The basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing and knowing are non-dual.
[3856] [3856] Furthermore:
[3857] [3857] The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond all.
[3858] [3858] Thus it is said.
[3859] [3859] The section distinguishing the threefold teaching—the supreme complete teaching of the path that is distinctive—is:
[3860] [3860] The essential point of the path is the essential point of entering the essence, like a spark striking flint.
[3861] [3861] This is divided into three:
[3862] [3862] Taught in the manner of oral transmission,
[3863] [3863] Taught in the manner of symbolic instruction,
[3864] [3864] Taught in the manner of self-arisen tantric scripture.
[3865] [3865] Among these, the essence of oral transmission is:
[3866] [3866] The path of action, beyond the intellect, is practiced.
[3867] [3867] The division:
[3868] [3868] The instruction that cuts the extremes of fixation,
[3869] [3869] The two instructions that manifest the confidence of liberation and the purity of means.
[3870] [3870] The first:
[3871] [3871] At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, without relying—when distinguishing from the basis,
[3872] [3872] Even the mere word of elaboration is not established,
[3873] [3873] The elaboration of designation does not exist,
[3874] [3874] In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter—so it is said.
[3875] [3875] Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted,
[3876] [3876] The ultimate meaning of cessation.
[3877] [3877] The second:
[3878] [3878] From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur,
[3879] [3879] At the time of the three käyas appearing on the path,
[3880] [3880] Whatever is not liberated does not exist,
[3881] [3881] At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.
[3882] [3882] The essence of symbolic instruction: non-deluded, thought-free.
