[4664] Relying on the four chapters of sun-moon-joined:
[4665] Shows carrying the four intermediate states on the path.
[4666] SEVEN: TWO ENTERING SELF-LIBERATION TANTRAS
[4667] Relying on the thirteen chapters of lion-power dzogchen:
[4668] Supports bringing out the form of view.
[4669] Relying on the fourteen chapters of jewel arrangement:
[4670] Shows entering the yogi's path and tradition.
[4671] EIGHT: EXPERT RITUAL TANTRAS
[4672] Relying on the one hundred eight chapters of the glorious black wrathful tantra:
[4673] Protects the supreme teachings.
[4674] These too, from the Pearl Garland:
[4675] Ah! Thus all tantras—
[4676] Supreme wonder, great!
[4677] Thus all meanings explained.
[4678] The tantra sequence:
[4679] The two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence.
[4680] The two explanatory mother and child tantras explain as leaves spreading.
[4681] The two limb tantras explain like planets and stars arising from oceans.
[4682] The two scripture-logic clear tantras explain like flowers opening.
[4683] The four upadesha tantras explain as ripening results.
[4684] The three intention-self-abiding tantras explain as seeing the peak.
[4685] The two entering-self-liberation tantras explain as mindful basis and heart.
[4686] The expert ritual tantras explain like a dog that does the messenger's work.
[4687] Thus,
[4688] The Reason for Establishing Eight Sections:
[4689] If the two root tantras are lacking:
[4690] Like a trunk with rotten roots—branches cannot arise.
[4691] If the two explanatory mother and child tantras are lacking:
[4692] Like no leaves from that—no flowers arise.
[4693] If the two limb tantras are lacking:
[4694] Like climbing a cliff without limbs—one falls.
[4695] If the two entering-self-liberation tantras are lacking:
[4696] Like a corpse without a heart—cannot benefit others.
[4697] If the two scripture-logic clear tantras are lacking:
[4698] 
[4699] 
[4700] 
[4701]
