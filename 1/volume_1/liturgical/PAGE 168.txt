[6675] As shown before, the teaching's seed leaped to fields such as the Beautiful Arrangement, and acting for the benefit of ripening all beings.
[6676] When, from this good eon's thousand, passed a hundred million eons of formation and destruction,
[6677] At the eon called "Saṃsāra-Emptier,"
[6678] Buddha Wheel Lightning Garland completely holding this supreme teaching,
[6679] Having liberated beings from saṃsāra,
[6680] All beings of the great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara are liberated in the primordial ground, and the three seeds of the teaching also dissolve into the sphere of reality;
[6681] Saṃsāra is emptied;
[6682] From here, in twenty thousand great aeons, embodied ones do not appear.
[6683] Then again, as before, from the arising of latent tendencies, when the vessel and environment of beings appear,
[6684] The teacher of method also arises from the power of primordial Samantabhadra.
[6685] As said in the Sound Great Thalgyur Tantra:
[6686] "This secret heart-essence teaching,
[6687] Thus, from the passing of seven teachings,
[6688] From definitely experiencing seven fields,
[6689] Thus, from the passing of seven also,
[6690] On the threshold of Vajra Seat,
[6691] The seed of all teachings' speech,
[6692] The very self-arisen great syllable,
[6693] Descends with sound;
[6694] Here, in a hundred-million aeons,
[6695] By Wheel Lightning Garland,
[6696] Will appear to the Bhagavān.
[6697] Then, three hundred years,
[6698] Thus, below the passing of three,
[6699] The teaching's mind-vajra also
[6700] Will appear to that teacher.
[6701] Then, in five hundred years,
[6702] The teaching's kāya also descended there;
[6703] Thus, from the actual descent of teaching,
[6704] Again the teaching's ember arises.
[6705] Even in that teacher's retinue,
[6706] Called Ārya Brahma-Light,
[6707] To miraculous-power-possessing perfection,
[6708] Extremely faithful, aspiring,
[6709] Definitely held, manifestly appeared.
[6710] That, etc., the teacher's retinue:
[6711] Ārya śrāvakas, twenty thousand,
[6712] Vinaya teaching, one eon
