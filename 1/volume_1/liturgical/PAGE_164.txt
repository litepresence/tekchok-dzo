[6488] [6488] From the arrangement of sixty-four hundred-thousand great emanations of that first protector himself,
[6489] [6489] Emanating as Buddhas, nineteen hundred-thousand to the perception of disciples, acting for benefit:
[6490] [6490] The arrangement of great Brahma in the abode of king supreme Samantabhadra,
[6491] [6491] The teaching showing the deed in the sky of the abode of one Kaustubha jewel, the thirteenth within the center of lotus petals on the palm of Vairocana's hand.
[6492] [6492] And in all the abodes of that kāya,
[6493] [6493] The teaching showing the deed in fields existing in other abodes of the five families transcends thought—
[6494] [6494] The Buddha's deed,
[6495] [6495] Qualities and activities,
[6496] [6496] Called "three kāyas equal to the sky"—
[6497] [6497] Tenth-ground bodhisattvas cannot measure;
[6498] [6498] How can worldly, seeing mind measure?
[6499] [6499] From the Uttaratantra:
[6500] [6500] "Buddha-element and Buddha-awakening,
[6501] [6501] Buddha qualities and Buddha activities,
[6502] [6502] Even for pure beings, inconceivable."
[6503] [6503] Thus it is spoken.
[6504] [6504] From the Ratnaketu:
[6505] [6505] "As much as the sky is pervaded,
[6506] [6506] The kāya also pervades that much.
[6507] [6507] As much as the kāya is pervaded,
[6508] [6508] Light also pervades that much.
[6509] [6509] As much as light is pervaded,
[6510] [6510] Speech also pervades that much."
[6511] [6511] Thus it was spoken.
[6512] [6512] Second, showing the enumeration of obtained liberation:
[6513] [6513] In this Jambudvīpa, by this great secret definitive teaching,
[6514] [6514] Although hundred-thousand non-human ḍākinīs beyond number are liberated,
[6515] [6515] Here on this occasion, the definite enumeration of liberation in this life and the intermediate state by the enumeration of men, women,
[6516] [6516] Fully ordained,
[6517] [6517] Boys and girls is:
[6518] [6518] From the Great Arrangement:
[6519] [6519] "Listen, fortunate monk Pal:
[6520] [6520] I, from not abiding here,
[6521] [6521] Until sixty years of life,
[6522] [6522] One thousand results of liberation
[6523] [6523] Arising as self-release:
[6524] [6524] Monk form, half of that;
[6525] [6525] Remainder, bodhisattvas.
[6526] [6526] Then until fifty,
[6527] [6527] Arising, returning to self-place,
[6528] [6528] By two hundred-thousand, obtain birthless.
[6529] [6529] Mostly females' form,
[6530] [6530] Males, two thousand.
[6531] [6531] Then, in the interval of thirty years of life,
[6532] [6532] Six hundred-thousand,
[6533] [6533] These mostly males,
[6534] [6534] By one hundred-thousand females.
[6535] [6535] Arising, self-release.
[6536] [6536] Those, my former retinue,
[6537] [6537] In degenerate time, obtained Buddhahood.
[6538] [6538] The definite secret essence even gathered,
[6539] [6539] From obtaining the result itself,
[6540] [6540] Not the result of other teaching.
[6541] [6541] If to other teaching,
[6542] [6542] Manifest Buddhas arise,
[6543] [6543] This meets, thus it is.
[6544] [6544] In the heart of all results,
[6545] [6545] This is the definite teaching."
[6546] [6546] Thus it is spoken.
