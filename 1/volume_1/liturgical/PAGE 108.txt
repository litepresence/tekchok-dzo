[3977] Speaking in the manner of reversing error at its basis,

[3978] Speaking of the bindu brought to its own vital point.

[3979] The first essence: error's root, ignorance, laid as the basis of saṃsāra in the three realms,

[3980] That same one pursuing itself, ignorance's root is cut.

[3981] Called "first self-awareness."

[3982] Self-nature arising as manifold, through the messenger of cause and condition pursuing,

[3983] The focus on objects severed, saṃsāra and error's basis exhausted—causeless emptiness, primordially pure, so it is called.

[3984] Through error being self-purified in characteristic, the path of error's knowledge is exhausted, so it is called.

[3985] That divided, there are three:

[3986] The manner of cutting error at the root, reversing the view of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,

[3987] The manner of leaving error to itself, recognizing the dharmatā of non-error,

[3988] The manner of embracing the basis of error, cutting the stream of error's wheel.

[3989] The first essence:

[3990] Error's root—awareness that is the same, knowing itself as self-liberated—primordial error that is not experienced, seal obtained, beyond error and impurity,

[3991] Self-nature as different error, the measure of all imagination obtained, beyond object and subject.

[3992] Characteristic: knowing error as error, the heat and measure of non-error obtained.

[3993] The second essence:

[3994] First, through error not experienced, ignorance's continuum is pure,

[3995] Now, not dwelling in error, the basis of action and affliction is empty,

[3996] Later, error becomes impossible, the cord of action's virtue and sin is cut.

[3997] Self-nature without difference—the basis of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is one,

[3998] Error is completely pure,

[3999] Characteristic: without error's cause, the three realms are tossed like a sack.

[4000] The third essence:

[4001] The basis of falling-doers empty, the unobtainable basis is held,

[4002] Self-nature beyond calculation—even as merely non-error, without establishment,

[4003] Characteristic: duality not established, error and non-error separated.

[4004] The third: the essence of bindu brought to self-abiding—alone, free from elaboration, without many parts,
