[3977] Speaking in manner of reversing error at basis,

[3978] Speaking of bindu brought to its own vital point.

[3979] First, nature: error's root, ignorance, laid as basis of three realms' saṃsāra,

[3980] That same pursuing itself, ignorance's root is cut,

[3981] Called "first self-awareness."

[3982] Nature arising as manifold, through cause-and-condition's messenger pursuing,

[3983] Object's focus severed, saṃsāra-error's basis exhausted, causeless emptiness primordially pure, thus called.

[3984] Through error self-purified in characteristic, knowledge's error-path exhausted, thus called.

[3985] That divided, there are three:

[3986] Error root-cut, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa view-reversed manner,

[3987] Error self-left-put, non-error dharmatā recognized manner,

[3988] Error-basis embraced, error-wheel stream-cut manner.

[3989] First nature:

[3990] Error's root, awareness that same, knowing as self-liberation, primordial non-experienced-error seal obtained, beyond error-impure,

[3991] Nature as different error, all-pervading imagined measure obtained, beyond object and subject.

[3992] Characteristic: knowing error as error, non-error's heat-measure obtained.

[3993] Second nature:

[3994] First, through non-experienced-error, ignorance's continuum pure,

[3995] Now, not dwelling in error, action and affliction's basis empty,

[3996] Later, error impossible, action's virtue-sin cord cut.

[3997] Nature without difference, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's basis is one,

[3998] Error completely pure,

[3999] Characteristic: without error-cause, three realms tossed in sack.

[4000] Third nature:

[4001] Falling-doer basis empty, action's unobtainable basis held,

[4002] Nature beyond calculation, error-not-error only also without establishment,

[4003] Characteristic: duality not established, error-not-error's companion separated.

[4004] Third, bindu brought to self-abiding nature: sole, free from elaboration, without many parts,
