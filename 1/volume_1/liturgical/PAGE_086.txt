[3166] [3166] The outer vehicle of Muni's tantra.
[3167] [3167] And the inner vehicle of means tantra.
[3168] [3168] Thus it is said.
[3169] [3169] From self-arisen awareness.
[3170] [3170] The vajra vehicle has two aspects.
[3171] [3171] The outer Muni tantra.
[3172] [3172] And the inner means tantra.
[3173] [3173] Thus.
[3174] [3174] If one asks what is placed as tantra in mantra:
[3175] [3175] When the main person's continuum meets the clear light of expanse, it is called "thus."
[3176] [3176] The first is divided into three.
[3177] [3177] The action tantra vehicle, Kriyā.
[3178] [3178] The both tantra vehicle, Upāya.
[3179] [3179] The yoga tantra vehicle, Yoga.
[3180] [3180] Thus it is said.
[3181] [3181] From that itself.
[3182] [3182] The outer tantra has three aspects.
[3183] [3183] Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga.
[3184] [3184] Thus.
[3185] [3185] First:
[3186] [3186] Accomplishing through the three purifications and pure conduct as self and deity, master and servant, attaining accomplishment.
[3187] [3187] This divides into two.
[3188] [3188] The main activity of purification.
[3189] [3189] The main activity of visualization.
[3190] [3190] First: Entering through bath and pure sound, meditating on the body as pure deity form.
[3191] [3191] Performing the three baths.
[3192] [3192] Changing the three garments.
[3193] [3193] Relying on the three whites.
[3194] [3194] And relying on the three sweets, etc.
[3195] [3195] From the lower, this surpassing manner.
[3196] [3196] Not establishing as true in the capacity of conventional appearance.
[3197] [3197] Through the three objects of meditation—visualizing forms, statues, images—all appearances become clear as deity forms.
[3198] [3198] Without abandoning form, not abiding in the extremes of one and many.
[3199] [3199] Meditating on speech syllables and letters, all sounds become clear as deity sounds, reciting mantras.
[3200] [3200] Not abiding in the four extremes of birth and cessation.
[3201] [3201] The sound extent is no other than the deity of sound.
[3202] [3202] Meditating on the mind's signs, all thoughts become clear as concentration deities.
[3203] [3203] Not departing from all thought through meditation, not abiding in great dependent origination.
[3204] [3204] Not even conventionally arising or born.
[3205] [3205] In ultimate truth, commitment deities, primordial wisdom beings.
