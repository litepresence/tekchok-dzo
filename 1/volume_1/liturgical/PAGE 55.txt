[1783] Extreme beyond:
[1784] Entities all to self not-grasping.
[1785] View beyond:
[1786] Inexpressible.
[1787] Thus type divisions:
[1788] Illusion and dream like entity appearing itself not-established,
[1789] Essence empty non-existing clear-appearance's delusion-appearance only,
[1790] Mind itself self-arisen wisdom's essence ignorance from arisen,
[1791] Essence obscuring arisen,
[1792] These delusion-appearance cleared when,
[1793] Stainless luminosity manifest became.
[1794] Now these action and kleśas produced self-nature action and kleśas itself's face supporting abide,
[1795] That incorrect conceptions consciousness groups six or seven ālaya with supporting, that itself self-arisen wisdom mind's thusness self-nature completely-pure in abide,
[1796] That whatever not-abiding thus self-arisen wisdom.
[1797] Uttara-tantra from:
[1798] Earth water wind in,

[1805] Mental-activity constantly abide.
[1806] Incorrect mental-activity

[1808] Mind's self-nature phenomena
[1809] All also abide not.
[1810] Thus.

[1812] Black,
[1813] Mixed three,
[1814] Merit,
[1815] Non-merit,
[1816] Immovable action three.
[1817] Merit's action:
[1818] Occasion saṃsāra's pleasure-result producing ten-virtues and so forth merit compatible.
[1819] Non-merit:
[1820] Non-virtues ten and ānantaryas five and so forth.
[1821] Immovable:
