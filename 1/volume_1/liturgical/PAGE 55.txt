00001| [1782] View beyond.
00002| [1783] Extreme beyond:
00003| [1784] Entities all to self not-grasping.
00004| [1785] View beyond:
00005| [1786] Inexpressible.
00006| [1787] Thus type divisions:
00007| [1788] Illusion and dream like entity appearing itself not-established,
00008| [1789] Essence empty non-existing clear-appearance's delusion-appearance only,
00009| [1790] Mind itself self-arisen wisdom's essence ignorance from arisen,
00010| [1791] Essence obscuring arisen,
00011| [1792] These delusion-appearance cleared when,
00012| [1793] Stainless luminosity manifest became.
00013| [1794] Now these action and kleśas produced self-nature action and kleśas itself's face supporting abide,
00014| [1795] That incorrect conceptions consciousness groups six or seven ālaya with supporting, that itself self-arisen wisdom mind's thusness self-nature completely-pure in abide,
00015| [1796] That whatever not-abiding thus self-arisen wisdom.
00016| [1797] Uttara-tantra from:
00017| [1798] Earth water wind in,
00018| [1799] Wind space excellently abides,
00019| [1800] Space wind and water and
00020| [1801] Earth's khams in abide not.
00021| [1802] Thus aggregates khams faculties
00022| [1803] Action and kleśas rely.
00023| [1804] Action and kleśas correct not,
00024| [1805] Mental-activity constantly abide.
00025| [1806] Incorrect mental-activity
00026| [1807] Mind's pure excellently abides.
00027| [1808] Mind's self-nature phenomena
00028| [1809] All also abide not.
00029| [1810] Thus.
00030| [1811] That from white,
00031| [1812] Black,
00032| [1813] Mixed three,
00033| [1814] Merit,
00034| [1815] Non-merit,
00035| [1816] Immovable action three.
00036| [1817] Merit's action:
00037| [1818] Occasion saṃsāra's pleasure-result producing ten-virtues and so forth merit compatible.
00038| [1819] Non-merit:
00039| [1820] Non-virtues ten and ānantaryas five and so forth.
00040| [1821] Immovable:
00042| [1823] Kleśas six:
