[3915] [3915] Through essence being without dharma, even the name of buddha does not exist.
[3916] [3916] Through self-nature radiating as energy, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear as the view.
[3917] [3917] Through characteristic not established as one, view and meditation are without measure.
[3918] [3918] The second:
[3919] [3919] Through essence being unproduced and completely purified, afflictions are self-liberated,
[3920] [3920] Through self-nature being unceasing and pervasively arising, acceptance and rejection do not exist at all,
[3921] [3921] Through characteristic being causeless and self-liberated, the path of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is exhausted.
[3922] [3922] Through the essence of gtar-ka's obstacle-clearing, the essential point of dharmatā is clarified,
[3923] [3923] At the boundary of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa:
[3924] [3924] Through self-nature being unobstructed, the ground-basis is without the stain of ignorant mind,
[3925] [3925] Through characteristic being causeless and the basis being pure, confusion is self-pacified.
[3926] [3926] When divided, there are two:
[3927] [3927] The removal of obstacles in the heat and clarity of view and meditation,
[3928] [3928] The removal of obstacles in the manner of abiding of phenomena.
[3929] [3929] The first:
[3930] [3930] The heat of view is the connection between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3931] [3931] That also: when view moves, the dharmatā of cyclic existence settles as the non-dual equality of movement and stillness.
[3932] [3932] At the time of view's attainment, heat arises in body and speech,
[3933] [3933] Like fire blazing in wood.
[3934] [3934] At the time of view's stability, the distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is:
[3935] [3935] Like an army conquering a fortress.
[3936] [3936] At the time of meditation's movement, wind and mind are gathered,
[3937] [3937] Like entering the treasure-house of the body's channels.
[3938] [3938] At the time of meditation's attainment, mind enters the path,
[3939] [3939] Like a wild boar being tamed.
[3940] [3940] At the time of meditation's stability, the strength of awareness is found—
[3941] [3941] Like the royal lineage bestowing empowerment from the universal sovereign.
[3942] [3942] At the time of conduct's movement, the distant reach of knowing, with heart-wind rising,
[3943] [3943] Like a garuḍa's complete wings or a companion flying into the sky.
[3944] [3944] At the time of conduct's stability, the heat and clarity of the three bodies is attained,
[3945] [3945] Like the absorption of Brahmā.
[3946] [3946] Also, through conduct, appearance is purified, so the dharmatā of appearance and conditions is without path of effort.
[3947] [3947] Through the removal of obstacles in meditation's movement, the path of recollection, samādhi, and concentration is without path of effort.
[3948] [3948] Through the removal of obstacles in view's dharmatā, the path of buddhahood beyond reliance on phenomena is without path of effort.
[3949] [3949] Through the removal of obstacles in the manner of abiding of phenomena, the essence of dharmatā is without fabrication—whatever appears, mind does not conceptualize.
