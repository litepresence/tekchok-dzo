[6420] At the third, the thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector, and
[6421] At the fourth, the thousand suns' king, and
[6422] At the fifth, the web-protector Buddha, and
[6423] At the sixth, the thousand light-rays' rim-protector, and
[6424] At the seventh, the saṃsāra-destroyer king, and
[6425] Then, in the aeons of the intervals of sixty-four hundred-thousand, holding this secret heart-essence, acting for the benefit of beings,
[6426] Until the great aeon of strife-possessing, arranged by Vajradhara of the great Brahma.
[6427] The sequence of these extensively:
[6428] Arises from the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra—
[6429] Each aeon,
[6430] Each enumeration of Buddha,
[6431] Each manner of liberation of gathered retinue, and the first:
[6432] From the primordial first Buddha,
[6433] Until the aeon of strife-possessing, actually taught sixty-six within the category of the inexpressible—
[6434] The teaching of all, the number of sixty-four hundred-thousand.
[6435] The primordial first Buddha:
[6436] "First, the superior Smṛti-protector,
[6437] Mudrā of self-remembering wheel,
[6438] The word distinguishing superior from base,
[6439] Śikhin, arisen at the previous beginning.
[6440] By seventy myriads of this time,
[6441] This mudrā is supreme."
[6442] To:
[6443] "The wisdom-protector of exhausted mindfulness,
[6444] The essence, self-word, secret understood,
[6445] To the aeon of strife-possessing,
[6446] By the nineteen lineage-holders,
[6447] The definitive mudrā supreme held."
[6448] Thus inexpressible,
[6449] From the blessings of the Buddhas,
[6450] In the self-arisen great letter,
[6451] Of the great primordially pure abiding,
[6452] From the descent, all this self-arisen arose;
[6453] All this sequence of blessing also,
[6454] Self-shown from the first descent.
[6455] Thus to:
[6456] "Inexpressible" means other aeons and the sequence of Buddhas of the interval aeons condensed.
[6457] Those also, from the Great Arrangement:
[6458] "The primordial first Buddha,
[6459] The supreme thousand maṇḍala gathered.
[6460] Then at the second teaching,
[6461] Called Śikhin, protector of the world,
[6462] By the supreme thousand, this mudrā.
[6463] At the third teaching,
[6464] The thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector,
[6465] The thousand Buddhas' very heart essence rolled.
[6466] Then at the fourth teaching,
[6467] The thousand suns' king, and
[6468] By the thousand Buddhas, dominion conquered.
[6469] At the fifth teaching,
[6470] Called Jvalamukha, protector of the world,
[6471] In the heart of the supreme thousand, concealed.
[6472] At the sixth teaching,
[6473] The thousand light-rays' rim-protector,
[6474] By the thousand families, this very concealed.
[6475] Then at the seventh teaching,
[6476] The all-pervading saṃsāra-destroyer, Brahma-protector,
[6477] By the thousand great bliss, crown held.
[6478] Thus, thus is the teaching:
[6479] To sixty-four hundred-thousand,
[6480] By that many number of Buddhas,
[6481] This great secret fully held.
[6482] The definitive Buddhas of the teaching:
[6483] By nineteen hundred-thousand,
[6484] This very mudrā, essence rolled.
[6485] Thus it is spoken.
[6486] That also, sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons,
[6487] Is the aeon of the great Brahma.
