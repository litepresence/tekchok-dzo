[5852] [5852] The perfection of place—
[5853] [5853] Within the vast and open sky of dharmadhātu's spacious expanse,
[5854] [5854] The perfection of teacher—
[5855] [5855] Samantabhadra, gathering the hosts of self-mind's delusion-appearances.
[5856] [5856] The perfection of retinue—
[5857] [5857] The five outer objects,
[5858] [5858] The six inner thought-collections, habitual delusion-appearances.
[5859] [5859] The perfection of teaching—
[5860] [5860] The dharmas of saṃsāra: grasping, holding, self, other, karma, and afflictions.
[5861] [5861] The perfection of time—
[5862] [5862] From beginningless and endless time, the moment consciousness grasps at appearances through conceptual analysis, absorption, higher realms, and habitual tendencies.
[5863] [5863] In summary: delusion-appearances arisen in mind, the dharmas of saṃsāra gathered under the name of five perfections are shown,
[5864] [5864] From the Ratnaketu Tantra:
[5865] [5865] From the pure aspect of appearance-making and grasping,
[5866] [5866] Outer objects appear like a retinue.
[5867] [5867] Thus it is spoken.
[5868] [5868] Second, the common prologue extensively explained:
[5869] [5869] From the Thalgyur:
[5870] [5870] The teacher's speech reveals to the retinue,
[5871] [5871] The chief of marvelous, supreme gathered teachings.
[5872] [5872] The common prologue of causes and conditions,
[5873] [5873] To accord with the door of other scriptures,
[5874] [5874] Is famously called "common."
[5875] [5875] Thus:
[5876] [5876] As it appears in the scriptures and tantras of common vehicles,
[5877] [5877] So too in this great secret definitive tantra,
[5878] [5878] Following the uncommon prologue,
[5879] [5879] "Thus have I heard at one time," and so forth, is spoken.
[5880] [5880] That also shows accordance with all vehicle scriptures,
[5881] [5881] For the meaning is uncommon;
[5882] [5882] That meaning is shown through explanation,
[5883] [5883] Abandoning doubt about where, when, by which teacher, to which retinue, this doctrine was taught—the common prologue is spoken with these in mind.
[5884] [5884] How is it spoken? At the time the tantra arose, where was the place?
[5885] [5885] That teacher, being of one essence with the three kāyas, must speak;
[5886] [5886] The manner:
[5887] [5887] Dharmakāya—speech of meaning-essence through blessing,
[5888] [5888] Saṃbhogakāya—speech that distinguishes pure, clear self-nature,
[5889] [5889] Nirmāṇakāya—speech in the manner of the sixty melodious speech-qualities, well-arranged in word and verse.
[5890] [5890] Those words also, from the hearer's consciousness,
