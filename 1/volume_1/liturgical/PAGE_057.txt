[1865] Knowing the nature, one enters the ultimate truth—the essence of complete purity—which leads to nirvana.
[1866] Here, from the Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[1867] "All of these are merely the causes of samsara."
[1868] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[1869] The detailed division of samsaric phenomena—third chapter.
[1870] Thus, knowing the enumerations of confused appearances,
[1871] Those are designated as the definitive limits of established tenets.
[1872] The extensive explanation of vehicle enumerations:
[1873] From the Great Tantra of Rigpa Rangshar:
[1874] "Hold the secret vajra!
[1875] My vehicle is immeasurable.
[1876] It gathers all modes of explanation into two:
[1877] Samsara and nirvana."
[1878] The meaning of this teaching has two aspects:
[1879] The worldly vehicle, and
[1880] The transcendent vehicle.
[1881] First, the essence of the vehicle:
[1882] Definition,
[1883] Division,
[1884] Purpose,
[1885] And the five results.
[1886] The essence is the definite meaning that dwells in the terminology of enumeration, which attains the results of the mental investigation of samsara that does not transcend.
[1887] The definition:
[1888] Engaging and establishing merely the excellence of the world.
[1889] If divided:
[1890] The two vehicles of fixated and mistaken.
[1891] The purpose:
[1892] Accomplishing one's own results.
[1893] The result:
[1894] The method by which one's own result manifests at a certain time.
[1895] The fixated vehicle of gods and humans:
[1896] Through accumulating merit and maintaining the ten virtues and ethical discipline, one accomplishes the method for achieving future happiness of gods and humans.
[1897] Since what is entered becomes a basis, this is called the fixated vehicle.
[1898] From the Great Magical Net of Vajrasattva:
[1899] "The earlier vehicle is the vehicle of gods and humans."
[1900] The mistaken vehicle:
[1901] From Rangshar.
