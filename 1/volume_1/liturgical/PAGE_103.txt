[3809] Through mind without cause-sign, the non-dual object of desire.

[3810] The second:

[3811] Through not relying on the eight vehicles, the exertion of progression is abandoned,

[3812] Though appearances arise in manifold forms, liberation comes from the one—not-ceased self-nature arising, so it is called.

[3813] That also, the ultimate of the great perfection's accomplishment:

[3814] Self-appearance, directionless, all-pervasively self-arising,

[3815] Whatever is not rejected is completely perfected,

[3816] The basis of all phenomena, in whatever direction, is not exceeded.

[3817] Dharmatā arising in manifold forms, even in India, is not exhausted.

[3818] The third:

[3819] Appearance, when drawn into mind, the rays of self-awareness clearly manifest,

[3820] Appearance not rejected, completely perfected,

[3821] The rays of mind's continuity, through recollection and meditation clearly manifest—recollection and meditation perfected in dharmatā, thus continuity emptied and purified, so it is called.

[3822] Perception and awareness entering, through severance of non-dual connection, saṃsāra's essence is completely liberated, so it is called.

[3823] The great perfection of self-arising desire:

[3824] Through view being non-existent, beyond conceptual imputation,

[3825] Through meditation being non-existent, without acceptance, rejection, negation, or establishment,

[3826] Through conduct being non-existent, action is liberated in dharmatā,

[3827] Through result being non-existent, non-attainment abides in itself.

[3828] Among these, when divided:

[3829] Enumeration is beyond measure.

[3830] The spreading of key-points—that very suchness's vast compassion:

[3831] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's dharmas, arising in the käya and jñāna of appearing-awareness, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa wherever not divided—dharmatā, so it is called.

[3832] That also, through dual proliferation of the non-changing mark and appearing-awareness, saṃsāra is reversed.

[3833] The key-point of clearly seeing one's own face, through self-and-other proliferation of recollection and meditation, thought is completely purified, so it is called.

[3834] Through non-existence of outer and inner objects, bliss without concepts, awakening—so it is called.

[3835] Through freedom from action, mind is beyond,

[3836] Through self-knowing examination, bliss and suffering have equal taste—so it is called.

[3837] These too, when gathered, are collected into three.
