[7395] From the Essence of Divided Empowerments:
[7396] "By worship with great celebration,
[7397] To guru and guru's retinue,
[7398] All together with mother,
[7399] Whoever makes feast,
[7400] In inconceivable hundred-thousand eons,
[7401] Having pleased all Buddhas,
[7402] The part of this merit is not equal.
[7403] If touching
[7404] With sandalwood the guru's pore,
[7405] This merit is limitless.
[7406] Thus own vajra siblings,
[7407] One, two, or three,
[7408] Or hundreds, thousands, numberless,
[7409] Whoever makes feast celebration,
[7410] If not at empowerment time,
[7411] Worship own guru,
[7412] Having done hundreds numberless,
[7413] The merit of doing one at this
[7414] Mind is not able to measure.
[7415] By feast of food and drink with great result,
[7416] If yogis are pleased,
[7417] All goodness is accomplished,
[7418] And liberated from faults.
[7419] If vajra sister or
[7420] Guru's student,
[7421] To the gathering of yoginīs,
[7422] If pleased by feast celebration,
[7423] To eight mothers or pig-mother,
[7424] Feast offerings nine hundred
[7425] Done at wrong time,
[7426] At this time to one yoginī,
[7427] Food or drink or,
[7428] If even little thirst is given,
[7429] This merit is not equal.
[7430] Therefore to mother's city,
[7431] Having gone, please the yoginī.
[7432] Yogi father and mother two,
[7433] Equal and mixed worship,
[7434] Here this siddhi,
[7435] Arises possessing supreme marvel.
[7436] In this world desired meaning,
[7437] And future, for conducting wisdom-sphere,
[7438] The siddhi of sky-goers,
[7439] Whatever master of various,
[7440] With retinue in sky,
[7441] Is able to conduct."
[7442] Thus it is spoken.
[7443] That also, if celebration is done greatly,
[7444] Obtains any siddhi in this life, for it is the time of special gathering.
[7445] Explaining the signs of siddhi:
