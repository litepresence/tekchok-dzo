[2726] Realized like reflections, essenceless by nature, unarisen.
[2727] Also regarding the Dharma-self, outer grasping and
[2728] Inner antidote-grasping consciousness—both superimposed as truly existent.
[2729] The person-self: on the five aggregates gathered as Dharma, the abandoning consciousness grasping "I" and "mine."
[2730] Thus called person-self and Dharma-self.
[2731] Though Arya Listeners realize person-selflessness, they do not realize Dharma-selflessness.
[2732] Self-Enlightened ones realize above that outer Dharma-grasping is non-existent, yet do not realize non-grasping.
[2733] From the Abhisamayalankara:
[2734] "To abandon grasping of objects,
[2735] Yet not abandon grasping itself—
[2736] The rhinoceros-like path of support
[2737] Is to be known through correct summary."
[2738] So it is said.
[2739] Time: Arising from gathering accumulations on the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas.
[2740] "The rhinoceros, through a hundred kalpas' cause"—
[2741] Thus it is taught.
[2742] The crow-like:
[2743] Meditates on dependent arising in reverse order,
[2744] Going to the charnel ground: "From what did this corpse arise?"
[2745] "From death," thus contemplating up to ignorance.
[2746] Based on realizing half and complete selflessness,
[2747] Through meditating on the five paths, manifesting the enlightenment of knowing weariness and non-arising.
[2748] Both of these teach Dharma through bodily signs, not through speech.
[2749] These methods are from Rigpa Rangshar:
[2750] "Aho! Secret Lord, listen!
[2751] The sutra vehicle of self-enlightened ones
[2752] Has twelve links of dependent arising as its entrance.
[2753] The view realized is person-selflessness,
[2754] Seeing half-power regarding Dharma-self.
[2755] Protecting the two hundred fifty disciplines,
[2756] The meditation stage: meditating on non-thought Dharma-nature.
[2757] Outer and inner dependent arisings,
[2758] Through habituation become strength,
[2759] The fruit is considered complete perfection.
[2760] This is indicated through example:
[2761] For example, like a corpse in a charnel ground—
[2762] Going to the charnel ground,
[2763] "From where first did this corpse arise?
[2764] What is the entity of this now?"
[2765] Thus indicating through example.
[2766] These arise from ignorance;
[2767] From ignorance, formative forces.
[2768] Formative forces are consciousness.
[2769] From consciousness, name arises;
[2770] From name, the nature of form arises.
[2771] From form, the six sense-bases arise;
[2772] From the six sense-bases, contact arises.
[2773] From contact, feeling arises.
[2774] From feeling, craving arises.
[2775] From craving, grasping arises;
[2776] From grasping, existence arises;
[2777] From existence, birth arises;
[2778] From birth, aging arises;
[2779] From aging, sickness arises;
[2780] From sickness, death arises.
[2781] Thus meditate on twelve dependent arisings.
[2782] Through excellence of such meditation,
[2783] Obtain the fruit of twelve grounds.
[2784] Meditate on the eight types of unpleasantness:
[2785] Going to the charnel ground direction,
[2786] Contemplate thus upon one's own body—
