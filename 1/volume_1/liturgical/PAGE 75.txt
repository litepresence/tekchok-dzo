[2726] Realized like reflections, essenceless by nature, unarisen. Also regarding the dharma-self, outer grasping and inner antidote-grasping consciousness—both superimposed as truly existent. The person-self: on the five aggregates gathered as dharma, the abandoning consciousness grasping "I" and "mine." Thus called person-self and dharma-self.

[2731] Though arya hearers realize person-selflessness, they do not realize dharma-selflessness. Self-enlightened ones realize above that outer dharma-grasping is non-existent, yet do not realize non-grasping.

[2733] From the Abhisamayalankara: "To abandon grasping of objects, yet not abandon grasping itself—the rhinoceros-like path of support is to be known through correct summary." So it is said.

[2739] Time: arising from gathering accumulations on the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas. "The rhinoceros, through a hundred kalpas' cause"—thus it is taught.

[2742] The crow-like: meditates on dependent arising in reverse order, going to the charnel ground: "From what did this corpse arise?" "From death," thus contemplating up to ignorance. Based on realizing half and complete selflessness, through meditating on the five paths, manifesting the enlightenment of knowing weariness and non-arising. Both of these teach dharma through bodily signs, not through speech.

[2749] These methods are from Rigpa Rangshar: "Aho! Secret Lord, listen! The sutra vehicle of self-enlightened ones has twelve links of dependent arising as its entrance. The view realized is person-selflessness, seeing half-power regarding dharma-self. Protecting the two hundred fifty disciplines, the meditation stage: meditating on non-thought dharma-nature. Outer and inner dependent arisings, through habituation become strength, the fruit is considered complete perfection."

[2760] This is indicated through example: for example, like a corpse in a charnel ground—going to the charnel ground, "From where first did this corpse arise? What is the entity of this now?" Thus indicating through example. These arise from ignorance; from ignorance, formative forces; formative forces are consciousness; from consciousness, name arises; from name, the nature of form arises; from form, the six sense-bases arise; from the six sense-bases, contact arises; from contact, feeling arises; from feeling, craving arises; from craving, grasping arises; from grasping, existence arises; from existence, birth arises; from birth, aging arises; from aging, sickness arises; from sickness, death arises.

[2781] Thus meditate on twelve dependent arisings. Through excellence of such meditation, obtain the fruit of twelve grounds. Meditate on the eight types of unpleasantness: going to the charnel ground direction, contemplate thus upon one's own body—first, considered to become blue; then, type red; type remaining; likewise type swollen; likewise type worm-entered; type scattered; likewise type white. These as antidotes to attachment—the eight unpleasant meditations. Without listening or hearing, therefore called the self-enlightened vehicle.
