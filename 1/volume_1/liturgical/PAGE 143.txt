[5508] KĪ—one GU GU with long portion is called. NA RO double-stacked—arising upper and lower—is called "upper and lower." KOU—one foot-hook is called. ZHENG BU double-stacked—arising bent and curved—is called "ZHENG." KEI—one GU GU is called.

[5509] The third, the expression manner of stacked [letters], is: when sounds are expressed similar to life-concordant, etc.

[5510] "Please examine these letter classes carefully." Stacked letters, note 4.

[5511] Called is: O KO ŚO MI TRĪ ṬAṂ.

[5512] Its meaning: the birthless pure dharma-kāya, the nature of wisdom, all phenomena non-dual, the eternal wisdom—empty, cessationless. From sphere, sphere arises; wisdom, non-dual, adorned. Therefore, the nature of the three-stacked sphere-wisdom.

[5513] That also is the wisdom of awareness beyond the equality of dharmatā.

[5514] Two lights: the light of realized persons, and the light of sentient beings through non-realization.

[5515] That also, for those endowed with realization, this very appearance freely arises as wisdom.

[5516] For the unrealized, though five lights exist, they are not seen and therefore not indicated.

[5517] Thus, other abodes of stacked [letters]: OṀ is the nature of the three kāyas. HĪG is the nature of HŪṀ. These noble letters arise in the melody of these three. What is gathered by wisdom's palace is called "sound-arising"—the specific emanation of the three root letters.
