[2960] [2960] Through three aspects of heat, it is taught.
[2961] [2961] The outer, the inner, and both together.
[2962] [2962] The outer heat arises thus:
[2963] [2963] The second: from the stainless.
[2964] [2964] Entities appear as empty.
[2965] [2965] That is the practice of concentration.
[2966] [2966] It is taught to arise in the two pure grounds.
[2967] [2967] The inner heat is the sixth.
[2968] [2968] Understanding the pure knowable as empty.
[2969] [2969] The heat of both is thus.
[2970] [2970] Seventh: it is taught to arise from the pure.
[2971] [2971] Eighth: patience is attained.
[2972] [2972] Ninth: the peak is reached.
[2973] [2973] Tenth: supreme dharma of the world.
[2974] [2974] Similarly, the ten grounds are obtained.
[2975] [2975] This is the vehicle of enlightenment.
[2976] [2976] Emptiness beyond words and letters.
[2977] [2977] Utterly without, one thinks emptiness.
[2978] [2978] Thus it is said.
[2979] [2979] Second: The explanation of established tenet views, divided into two.
[2980] [2980] The explanation of the mind-only and middle-way traditions.
[2981] [2981] First: All these appearing as white and red various appearances with consciousness, asserted by the mind-only school as truly real in the aspect of one's own mind—the true aspect of mind-only.
[2982] [2982] The false aspect of consciousness asserted by mind-only as false—these two.
[2983] [2983] First: Appearing to meaning, the aspect of one's own consciousness arises only outwardly.
[2984] [2984] As for example: When the image of a golden jewel hung upon a tree branch on the pond's bank appears in the water, the aspect of the jewel appears outwardly—just so.
[2985] [2985] In this, there is division.
[2986] [2986] The number of aspects is asserted to be the same as the number of consciousnesses.
[2987] [2987] Or asserting aspects and consciousnesses as split like an egg.
[2988] [2988] Or asserting aspects and consciousnesses as various and non-dual—these three.
[2989] [2989] First: When sound is heard, only the sound-holding consciousness arises.
[2990] [2990] As with form and so forth, the holding consciousness does not arise.
[2991] [2991] When consciousness enters an object, only that consciousness arises, others do not arise.
[2992] [2992] Whatever the number of aspects, that many consciousnesses are asserted.
[2993] [2993] Second: Appearances also arise from consciousness in various outer forms.
