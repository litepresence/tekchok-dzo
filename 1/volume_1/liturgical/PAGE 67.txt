[2350] Cause severed: mind cannot be held as entity. Effect severed: some declare life-force and lordship nonexistent. Path severed: withered, nothing exists. Primordial wisdom severed: Buddha nonexistent. Cause and effect nonexistent—emptiness completely severed—so declare some. Those severed while abiding upon the path declare the effect definitely severed.

[2356] Mistaken mind severs life-force. From severing life-force, meaning arises—so declare some. Severance is emptiness—you are severed, I am severed—therefore nothing exists—so declare some.

[2359] The knowers speak secretly: "Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent. Slight parts exist, suitable for appearance to faculties."

[2364] Those deviating from consistency are called tirthikas. Buddhists, deviating from consistency with Buddhists—merely flesh deviating through wrong tenet.

[2367] "Manifest appearance is mind's magic"—thinking thus. All is magic—so teach some. These mistaken appearances are true, because ultimate meaning is nonexistent—so declare some.

[2371] Some declare that anger arising finishes spirits; clan-sons should dwell in anger. Some declare this mind is self-arisen, thus uncorrectable. Some declare relying solely on meditating deity-body is sufficient. Some, being tirthika-doers, deviate from tirthika debate. Some declare this alone is permanent, thus nothing need be done.

[2376] Called Kani-pa: those wishing meaning indifferently. Called Sersnawa: possessed of suffering, fearing diminished appearances and emptiness. Called Sambhari.
