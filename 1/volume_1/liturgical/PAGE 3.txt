[59] That definite place is the teaching of light-clear vajra-essence,
[60] The self-nature wondrous and marvellous, the great complete vajra place of the unsurpassable secret of all Tathagatas' minds.
[61] Thus from the Treasury of the Secret King:
[62] After the primordial protector's manifest enlightenment, the ocean of manners in which fields are arranged,
[63] And the manner of obtaining peace in this field through Vajradhara's emanation,
[64] From the manner of turning the Dharma-wheel through the elaboration of emanation-body—
[65] First, before all, without opening, dividing, or separation of samsara and nirvana anywhere,
[66] The teacher complete in possession, Samantabhadra himself,
[67] From the primordial basis, the sphere of self-arising wisdom, the essence of the Sugata, arises as basis-appearance,
[68] In the moment of transcending the basis, recognizing self-appearance—the precious cave spontaneously accomplished by three self-arising dharmas,
[69] The great primordial purity, the end-place of beginning,
[70] Seizing the conquered place in the youth vase body's field,
[71] Having reached the end of abandon-realize qualities, becoming Buddha in the nature of Dharma-body, abiding in inner clarity.
[72] From the strength of that blessing, the mandala of self-appearing spontaneous dense arrangement field pervaded by five wisdoms, reaching the limits of sky, arranged as five families' individual self-appearances, abiding beyond trainees' objects.
[73] Then, long after, from the strength of primordial basis arising as basis-appearance, seeing beings move like dreams, appearing like confusion without cause of confusion,
[74] Compassionate mind arises, arranging fields for the purpose of beings.
[75] From the aspect-of-appearance of self-appearing enjoyment-complete body, the bodies of five-families Buddhas, the Great Ocean, arranged reaching the limits of sky.
