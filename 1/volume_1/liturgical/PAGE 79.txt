[2903] Manifesting the path of no-more-learning.
[2904] Third, the fruit of completion:
[2905] On the all-illuminating ground, obtaining the Dharma-body for self-purpose
[2906] And the two supreme form-bodies for others' benefit,
[2907] Seeing with the two wisdoms knowing what-is and what-extent,
[2908] Acting for beings' benefit until saṃsāra is emptied.
[2909] From the Entering:
[2910] "The peaceful body becomes clear like a wish-fulfilling tree;
[2911] Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from thought,
[2912] Always benefiting the world until migration and liberation,
[2913] This appears although free from elaboration."
[2914] Thus it is spoken.
[2915] These methods extensively
[2916] From Rigpa Rangshar:
[2917] "The Bodhisattva vehicle
[2918] Has the two truths as its entrance door:
[2919] Ultimate and conventional.
[2920] The limb of protective discipline:
[2921] Eighty-five vows.
[2922] The view: emptiness-wisdom.
[2923] Ultimate and conventional are thus:
[2924] Conventional is considered as two types:
[2925] Wrong and correct.
[2926] Wrong conventional is thus:
[2927] All that appears imputed,
[2928] Appears concordant, capable of function,
[2929] Yet analyzed, free of inherent essence,
[2930] Appearing like non-existent meaning.
[2931] That is wrong conventional.
[2932] Correct conventional is thus:
[2933] The actions of ten virtues,
[2934] Thoughts become white,
[2935] Faith thoughts to whatever extent—
[2936] Considered as great correct conventional.
[2937] Generosity and so forth, discipline,
[2938] And likewise concentration and so forth—
[2939] Great correct conventional.
[2940] Ultimate also has two types:
[2941] Ultimate of sign and word,
[2942] And ultimate of correct mind.
[2943] Through ultimate of sign and word,
[2944] All is refuted and debated.
[2945] That valid cognition's reasoning:
[2946] What appears thus to those,
[2947] To great emptiness of words,
[2948] Empty of meaning, not realized.
[2949] Ultimate of sign and word.
[2950] Ultimate of correct mind:
[2951] Considered to meditate on emptiness of utter non-existence,
[2952] Like space, empty.
[2953] The meaning of emptiness is authenticity.
[2954] Emptiness completely without limit.
[2955] Thus acting and attaching.
[2956] The path is considered thus.
[2957] Purifying on the grounds.
[2958] That: arising heat, patience,
[2959] Peak, world, Dharma-supreme.
