[3693] The expanse beyond words for dharmatā,

[3694] The expanse beyond view,

[3695] The expanse beyond engagement—

[3696] One hundred eighty-six thousand and three hundred,

[3697] Three great emanations:

[3698] The emanation that strikes the primordial basis,

[3699] The emanation of self-liberated appearance,

[3700] The emanation of dharmatā's non-dual equality.

[3701] Fifty nails that pierce dharmatā,

[3702] One hundred eleven bonds binding object and mind,

[3703] Two hundred thousand essential points that cut through appearance and mind in a single moment,

[3704] Five hundred thousand views liberated in the sphere of primordial purity,

[3705] One hundred thousand essential points severing conceptual construction in meditation—

[3706] These abide in the three: the signless continuum, the emptiness continuum, and the threefold abiding.

[3707] The grasping of mind's directions,

[3708] The grasping of mind's vehicles,

[3709] The grasping of mind's essential points—

[3710] These three are gathered.

[3711] The second: the great perfection of primordial liberation's fruition, the essence of the space category,

[3712] Wishes for the primordial purity of fruition beyond existence's manifold arising.

[3713] These divide into four:

[3714] The black space spoken as causeless,

[3715] The variegated space spoken as manifold,

[3716] The white space spoken as mind,

[3717] The vast yellow space applied to cause and fruition.

[3718] The essence of black space:

[3719] Unchanging and self-perfected, directionless arising, unbound to phenomena.

[3720] The divisions are: the space category of activity, the space category of compassion, the space category of emanation.

[3721] From these three, the first:

[3722] Arising causeless in the manifold, appearing without signs,

[3723] And that, arising from the sphere of emptiness, liberating saṃsāra and nirvāṇa without names or signs,

[3724] And that, by the definitive sign beyond extremes, establishes the great perfection's view free from elaboration.

[3725] The second:

[3726] Arising as primordial wisdom, depending not on other knowing,

[3727] Liberating as mind, applying to causes and conditions,

[3728] With arising and liberating non-dual, the fruition is primordially liberated.

[3729] And that, by the definitive sign of spontaneous presence, the great perfection is wished liberated from the sphere of appearance.

[3730] The third:
