[2013] [2013] On the side of result severance:
[2014] [2014] If one knows the nonexistent nature, other scriptures do not carry it away.
[2015] [2015] From making meaningless effort.
[2016] [2016] To reverse this life, we say that the established scripture has meaning, though we speak of nonexistence.
[2017] [2017] Those two holders of positions, like the humpbacked son of Katika:
[2018] [2018] All sentient beings first arise from the space of elements.
[2019] [2019] In the middle, they abide in the space of arising.
[2020] [2020] In the end, they dissolve into the space of arising, holding that there is no trace.
[2021] [2021] They speak of the single space of arising as the self-nature of all.
[2022] [2022] In the space of abiding, the nine abodes of non-abiding arise as whatever appears.
[2023] [2023] From the space of arising, the nine non-arisings of the time of arising.
[2024] [2024] Outer forms and so forth—objects of various white and red colors.
[2025] [2025] Inner sentient beings and mental concepts.
[2026] [2026] Nine aspects of the body that do not arise differently.
[2027] [2027] At the time of liberation.
[2028] [2028] The nine unliberated, when liberated—all vessels, contents, and embodied forms dissolve themselves. Since there is no unliberation.
[2029] [2029] The destroyed cannot return to the three realms.
[2030] [2030] Thus, all beings first arise adventitiously from space.
[2031] [2031] Now they abide adventitiously in space.
[2032] [2032] In the end, they are liberated adventitiously into space and do not return.
[2033] [2033] Second, explaining those enumerations individually:
[2034] [2034] From Rigpa Rangshar:
[2035] [2035] Such is the mistaken vehicle:
[2036] [2036] Holding the three hundred sixty of the transitory collection.
[2037] [2037] Explained as the three hundred spaces.
[2038] [2038] Such are the sixty views:

[2054] [2054] Carrying agents to the path.
[2055] [2055] Indicating great permanent meanings.

[2075] [2075] Refuting others through reasoning.
[2076] [2076] Speaking of the severance of causes.
[2077] [2077] Speaking of complete severance as emptiness.
[2078] [2078] The view of severance of causes and results.
[2079] [2079] The view of severance of paths and wisdom.
[2080] [2080] The great severance of eternity.
[2081] [2081] The definite severance of paths and results.

[2099] [2099] These two explain the meaning extensively:
