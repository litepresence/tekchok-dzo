[2013] On the side of result severance:
[2014] If one knows the nonexistent nature, other scriptures do not carry it away.
[2015] From making meaningless effort.
[2016] To reverse this life, we say that the established scripture has meaning, though we speak of nonexistence.
[2017] Those two holders of positions, like the humpbacked son of Katika:
[2018] All sentient beings first arise from the space of elements.
[2019] In the middle, they abide in the space of arising.
[2020] In the end, they dissolve into the space of arising, holding that there is no trace.
[2021] They speak of the single space of arising as the self-nature of all.
[2022] In the space of abiding, the nine abodes of non-abiding arise as whatever appears.
[2023] From the space of arising, the nine non-arisings of the time of arising.
[2024] Outer forms and so forth—objects of various white and red colors.
[2025] Inner sentient beings and mental concepts.
[2026] Nine aspects of the body that do not arise differently.
[2027] At the time of liberation.
[2028] The nine unliberated, when liberated—all vessels, contents, and embodied forms dissolve themselves. Since there is no unliberation.
[2029] The destroyed cannot return to the three realms.
[2030] Thus, all beings first arise adventitiously from space.
[2031] Now they abide adventitiously in space.
[2032] In the end, they are liberated adventitiously into space and do not return.
[2033] Second, explaining those enumerations individually:
[2034] From Rigpa Rangshar:
[2035] Such is the mistaken vehicle:
