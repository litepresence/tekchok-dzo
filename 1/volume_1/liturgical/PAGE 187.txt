[7661] From that:
[7662] "The great root maṇḍala,
[7663] Abiding in the center of each citta maṇḍala.
[7664] That maṇḍala is like this:
[7665] Self-arisen awareness is the maṇḍala,
[7666] The retinue is desired as the appearance of five lights.
[7667] One great root maṇḍala,
[7668] In each white conch-shell,
[7669] Is the pure bindu maṇḍala,
[7670] In the manner of possessing a retinue of tiny lights.
[7671] Two great root maṇḍalas,
[7672] In the center of pure emptiness,
[7673] The body of the vajra chain,
[7674] The desired retinue is the lamp of the sphere.
[7675] Three great root maṇḍalas,
[7676] Those maṇḍalas, etcetera,
[7677] The unchanging center of the kāya maṇḍala,
[7678] The vast, cessationless speech maṇḍala,
[7679] The clear, thoughtless mind maṇḍala,
[7680] The three kāyas' maṇḍala,
[7681] Each with center and retinue,
[7682] Not going, not coming, not changing,
[7683] Abiding in the center of each citta.
[7684] Thus is the meaning of the great maṇḍala,
[7685] Complete in each body."
[7686] Thus it is spoken.
[7687] Second:
[7688] The empowerment symbol, the drawn sand maṇḍala,
[7689] The line and section maṇḍalas—depending on the symbolic maṇḍala, meditating generation and completion as the object, the samādhi maṇḍala becomes the basis for arising path virtues—the meaningful maṇḍala.
[7690] The definite symbolic meaning maṇḍala is shown:
[7691] Also from that:
[7692] "The great reflection maṇḍala,
[7693] At the time of doing supreme empowerment,
[7694] Maṇḍala is spoken of as two types,
[7695] Spoken as two: peaceful and wrathful,
[7696] Completing empowerment should be thus.
[7697] The great peaceful maṇḍala:
[7698] Center, four-spoked wheel,
[7699] End, with vajra fence,
[7700] Jewel parapet,
[7701] Possessing garland curtains,
[7702] Thus possessing gate and arch,
[7703] That is the peaceful maṇḍala.
[7704] The wrathful maṇḍala is like this:
[7705] Center, eight-spoked wheel,
[7706] Palace, triangular, dark blue,
[7707] Those actions, etcetera,
[7708] Should be known in sequence.
[7709] Sand maṇḍala is desired."
[7710] Thus it is spoken.
[7711] Third, the maṇḍala of pure nature result:
