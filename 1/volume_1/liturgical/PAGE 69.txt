[2428] Thus spoke: "Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates." Explanation of outsiders' philosophical positions is finished.

[2430] Second: extensive division of transcendent vehicles—three parts: method superior to outsiders, general explanation, extensive particular explanation.

[2434] First: accepting the four dharma-seal mudras, going for refuge to the Three Jewels—superior, for outsiders' paths lack this. The four mudras: all compounded things impermanent, all with defilements suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation from suffering peaceful.

[2440] Second: five aspects—essence, definition, division, purpose, effect.

[2446] Essence of the transcendent vehicle: supreme method of definitely exiting samsara. Definition: that which, when entered, produces happiness. From the Compendium: mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—joy, happiness, bliss, accomplishing supreme virtue. This vehicle like space, a measureless great palace.

[2454] Division: small and great, two; or hearer, self-enlightened, bodhisattva vehicles, three—inconceivable, regarding disciples' minds. From the Lankavatara: as long as mind engages, vehicle-limits have no end.

[2462] Purpose: accomplishing temporary and ultimate meaning. Effect: definitely exiting the three realms, obtaining liberation.

[2464] Third: extensive particular explanation. From Rigpa Rangshar, vehicle divisions thus: sutra and great extensive, also great extensive. Great extensive: eighty-four thousand inconceivable, extensively numbered, many great, inconceivable, measureless, inexpressible, thought-transcending, great. Great victor thus.
