[3915] Through essence being without dharma, even buddha's name is not.

[3916] Through self-nature radiating as energy, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa appear as view.

[3917] Through characteristic not established as one, view and meditation are without measure.

[3918] Second:

[3919] Through essence unproduced and completely purified, afflictions are self-liberated,

[3920] Through self-nature unceasing and pervasively arising, acceptance and rejection are not at all,

[3921] Through characteristic causeless and spontaneously liberated, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's path is exhausted.

[3922] Through gtar-ka's essence clearing obstacles, dharmatā's vital point is cleared,

[3923] At saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's boundary,

[3924] Through self-nature unobstructed, basis-ground is without ignorant mind's stain,

[3925] Through characteristic causeless and basis pure, confusion is self-pacified.

[3926] When divided, there are two:

[3927] Clearing obstacles of view-meditation's heat-clarity,

[3928] Clearing obstacles of phenomena's manner of abiding.

[3929] First:

[3930] View's heat is saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's relational connection,

[3931] That too, dharmatā of view's movement-time settled as moving-still non-dual equality.

[3932] At view-attainment time, heat arises in body-speech,

[3933] Like fire blazing in wood.

[3934] At view-stability time, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's distinction is:

[3935] Like an army conquering a fortress.

[3936] At meditation-movement time, winds and mind are gathered,

[3937] Like gathering into body's channel treasure-house.

[3938] At meditation-attainment time, mind is gathered onto the path,

[3939] Like a wild yak being tamed.

[3940] At meditation-stability time, awareness' strength is attained,

[3941] Like royal lineage bestowing empowerment from universal sovereign.

[3942] At conduct-movement time, confusion's latent tendencies radiate,

[3943] Like garuḍa soaring into space or wild yak leaping into sky.

[3944] At conduct-attainment time, three kāyas' heat-clarity is attained,

[3945] Like Brahmā's absorption.

[3946] Furthermore, through conduct, appearance is purified, so appearance-conditions' dharmatā is without path of effort.

[3947] Through meditation-movement's obstacles cleared, recollection-samādhi-absorption's path is without path of effort.

[3948] Through view's dharmatā obstacles cleared, phenomena-non-reliance's buddhahood path is without path of effort.

[3949] Through phenomena's manner-of-abiding obstacles cleared, dharmatā's essence is without fabrication—whatever appears, mind does not conceptualize.
