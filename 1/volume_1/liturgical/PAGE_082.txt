[3022] [3022] That non-dual primordial wisdom.
[3023] [3023] Is the stainless suchness.
[3024] [3024] At the time of the remainder, when a slight stain of latent tendencies appears mistaken.
[3025] [3025] And it is said that taste, back sickness, and so forth exist.
[3026] [3026] When now in mind, the stain of mixed affliction and wisdom is purified, removing the false part of affliction.
[3027] [3027] One wishes to manifest the pure wisdom of the remainder.
[3028] [3028] The pure is not established merely as false aspects and consciousness.
[3029] [3029] Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated in the small work of mind.
[3030] [3030] When is thinking unnecessary?
[3031] [3031] Like that likeness, appearing as non-appearing yet clear luminosity.
[3032] [3032] Therefore, objects appear as various white and red aspects.
[3033] [3033] Appearing like reflections, as if both measurer and measurer were non-existent.
[3034] [3034] It is said that in ultimate truth, only the self-aware wisdom of one's own experience exists.
[3035] [3035] Second: The middle-way school and the autonomous.
[3036] [3036] These two consequences.
[3037] [3037] First: Thus, various appearances appear, aspects and measurers non-apparent, merely clarity; in ultimate truth, not only the self-aware wisdom of one's own nature is non-existent by its very essence.
[3038] [3038] In this, there is division: those who assert illusion as ultimate.
[3039] [3039] And those who are completely non-abiding—these two.
[3040] [3040] First:
[3041] [3041] Nothing is established as objects.
[3042] [3042] Through unestablished awareness and wisdom, beyond speech and thought, merely in ultimate truth, existing as the manner of illusion.
[3043] [3043] The qualities of meditation and the grounds of the path.
[3044] [3044] Through the result at the end, obtaining the wisdom of Buddha like illusion, from the nature of dharma-body, working benefit like illusion.
[3045] [3045] From the intermediate mother.
[3046] [3046] All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion.
[3047] [3047] Nirvāṇa is also like a dream, like an illusion.
[3048] [3048] If something more excellent than nirvāṇa exists.
