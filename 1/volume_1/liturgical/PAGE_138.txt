[5269] Now explained the sequence of long and short, heavy and light.

[5270] The first is this:

[5271] In whatever tantra, however letters of mantra may appear, whether stacked or single,

[5272] The inverted letters are placed wherever appropriate at the root,

[5273] And whatever prefix has arisen, the inverted [letter] is joined to the palate at the tip of the tongue, expressed directly without inversion, as it is called.

[5274] Like ṬA to TA, and so forth.

[5275] The branches are also joined appropriately to the mother [letter] and expressed.

[5276] These are read combined together as one life-force and kindred class,

[5277] Like K+KA,

[5278] Like K+AÜ.

[5279] Not as single [letters] but each separately expressed,

[5280] Like G+HAJA and so forth.

[5281] This also [comes] from Rigpa Rangdrol:

[5282] The letters' mantra are thus:

[5283] The inverted, the prefix, and the branches

[5284] Are all expressed here as they are,

[5285] And each is pronounced as appropriate.

[5286] The inverted [letter] is tagged and becomes manifest.

[5287] The mother herself is placed as basis.

[5288] The branches are nirvāṇa letters.

[5289] The prefix is only saṃsāra.

[5290] Thus mantras and letters, each is pronounced as appropriate. Thus it is spoken.

[5291] This also [comes] from Rangshar:

[5292] The non-saṃsāric is explained,

[5293] The prefix and branches are nirvāṇa's letters explained. From Rigpa Rangdrol, the mother is not placed as basis: the prefix is saṃsāra and the branches are nirvāṇa—these two explanations are not contradictory but are understood according to context.

[5294] At that time, when saṃsāra's sentient beings are pervaded by the Buddha's essence, and sentient beings are taken as basis, the letters' mother is made saṃsāric, so the prefix and branches are understood as saṃsāra.

[5295] When the nature of awareness separates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the manner of distinction and completeness, that mother is shown as awareness and placed as basis: the prefix is explained as saṃsāra and the branches are expressed as the dharmas of nirvāṇa.

[5296] In their nature they are always joined together, for they are designations without inherent existence. When impure saṃsāra is indicated, the root letter is taken as the mind of pride.
