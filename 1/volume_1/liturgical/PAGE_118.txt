4393. Realizing: entered the Buddha's tantra.

4394. Not-realizing: entered the sentient beings' tantra. Since that tantra itself is made the basis, the basis-tantra is established.

4395. The method-tantra too is this portion.

4396. That meaning itself is the basis for indication, so what is indicated becomes the method-tantra.

4397. Without basis-awareness as support, there are no Buddhas or sentient beings whatsoever.

4398. Those two who hold their tantras—regarding the tantra—

4399. That itself understood through entering: meaning realized—that is its purpose.

4400. Realized and liberated—that is its innermost result and fruit.

4401. Such meaning: if the guru's instruction does not indicate it, it is not realized.

4402. If indicated, realizing the indicating method: that is called the method-indicating tantra.

4403. That method transmitted one-to-one: thus called method-indicating.

4404. Through indication, rigpa must be seen—liberation itself must be gained.

4405. "Meaning unestablished anywhere, so no tantra"—if one thinks this, it is not so.

4406. Since there is no awareness-continuum like that, meaning's tantra is properly imputed.

4407. The essence-nature tantra is awareness.

4408. Awareness's dharmatā seen directly: the continuum of one who has passed holds the tantra.

4409. Without the guru's instruction, not seen—transmitted through samsara, so it is tantra.

4410. The flower-nature tantra:

4411. Four lamps: whoever sees and realizes dharmatā directly, that is rigpa—so it is the flower-tantra.

4412. Not seeing that, transmitted as the class of actions and kleśas—so also tantra.

4413. The quintessence-nature tantra:

4414. That practiced: essence condensed into quintessence—thus called.

4415. Seeing wisdom's appearance: since not destroyed in the three realms, it is tantra.

4416. That quintessence of indivisible space-awareness is also explained elsewhere among the seventeen great-secret definitive tantras.
