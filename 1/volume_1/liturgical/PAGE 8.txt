00001| [219] From light's bindu abiding, sixty complete-abidings established,
00002| [220] Buddha-bodies hundred-thousand countless, inexpressible, self-appear;
00003| [221] From five-family Buddhas' tongue-faculties, light-rays immeasurable radiate, all proclaimed through self-arisen six syllables' sound, compassion without activity pervades ten directions.
00004| [222] From that very state, Buddha Vairocana Great, body with retinue countless, dharmatā Samantabhadra's complete enjoyment gathering,
00005| [223] And Great Perfection's body blaze with light.
00006| [224] Likewise Akṣobhya,
00007| [225] Ratnasaṃbhava,
00008| [226] Amitābha,
