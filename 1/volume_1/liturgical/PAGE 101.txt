[3731] Free from the extremes of is and is-not, beyond directional fixation,

[3732] Self-nature without reliance, causeless, primordially pure,

[3733] Beyond fabrication's reference, through primordial liberation the directional expanse is established,

[3734] The great primordial wisdom of self-purified abiding, liberated from the beginning, called "exhaustion of self-basis,"

[3735] This too, through reasoning engaging deluded mind, is intended as self-liberation.

[3736] The essence is the nature of khra-bo.

[3737] Regarding manifold assertions:

[3738] Free from negation, directionless, self-arising everywhere,

[3739] In spontaneous activity, beyond affirmation and negation, this is intended.

[3740] Divided, there are three:

[3741] Assertion of existence corresponds to the Mind School, the khra-bo school,

[3742] Assertion of non-existence corresponds to the Self-Essential Point, the khra-bo school,

[3743] Assertion of existence-and-non-existence corresponds to the Upadesha, the khra-bo school.

[3744] First:

[3745] Self-purified abiding essence, nowhere divided, not established as affirmation or negation, beyond conceptual construction,

[3746] Without duality in characteristic, not departing from the single wheel of mind-existence,

[3747] Through that very activity unceasingly radiant,

[3748] Called "liberation of appearance-and-mind without duality."

[3749] This too, through reasoning of thought-free self-nature, intends primordial liberation of all phenomena, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated from their own ground.

[3750] Second:

[3751] Through self-nature of appearance-emptiness liberated from its own ground, dharmatā of mind displayed in manifold ways,

[3752] Through liberation of non-appearance from its own ground, action free from virtue and non-virtue is intended.

[3753] This too, through reasoning of transformation into emptiness, establishes non-appearance as self-purified.

[3754] Third:

[3755] Through self-emptiness primordially pure, not relying on action's cause and effect,

[3756] Through fabrication it arises,

[3757] Through arising as emptiness, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberate in all directions,

[3758] Through appearance-and-concept as ground, the reasoning of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's non-establishment is displayed,

[3759] Through inexpressibility, the key point of being free from thought,

[3760] Through being beyond comparison, the key point of being free from meditation,

[3761] Through liberation from the two of abiding and transformation, the key point of mind free from transformation—through these three, the dissolution of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's form is intended.

[3762] The essence of white space, through self-liberation of appearance-conditions, without action, pure cause, not to be established in the mode of abiding.

[3763] Divided—
