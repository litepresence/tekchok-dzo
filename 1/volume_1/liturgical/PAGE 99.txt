[3664] From spontaneously arising mind-wisdom's nature appearing everywhere, without arising—
[3665] Knowing no virtue-vice action.
[3666] Thus from non-arising mind, appearances appear various—
[3667] Play without ceasing, knowing samsara-nirvāṇa dharmas without accepting.
[3668] Thus through non-duality reasoning of play-basis characteristic, knowing essence non-different.
[3669] Thus non-dual Dharma, not intellectually analyzed—
[3670] Through self-liberated essence reasoning, all not transcending Dharma-nature.
[3671] That: basis mind itself unalterable through reasoning—considered deluded.
[3672] Fourth:
[3673] Through spontaneously arising wisdom's single play, pervading samsara-nirvāṇa without extreme-falling—
[3674] Appearances imputed, spontaneously arisen, without ceasing—samsara lower realms not established,
[3675] Appearances different, not transcending nature-side-tilt reasoning—nature pure,
[3676] Samsara emptied,
[3677] Pervasion, Dzogchen view not transcended.
[3678] That: not falling into existence-non-existence appearance-emptiness sides.
