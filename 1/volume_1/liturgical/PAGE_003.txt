[59] That definitive realm is the teaching of luminous clarity, the vajra-essence,
[60] The self-nature wondrous and marvellous—the great complete vajra realm of the unsurpassable secret of all Tathāgatas' minds.
[61] Thus, from the Treasury of the Secret King:
[62] From the primordial protector's manifest enlightenment, the ocean of manners in which fields are arranged,
[63] And the manner of obtaining peace in this field through Vajradhara's emanation,
[64] From the manner of turning the Dharma-wheel through elaboration of emanation-kāya—
[65] First, before all, without any division of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa anywhere,
[66] The complete sovereign teacher, Samantabhadra himself,
[67] From the primordial basis, the awareness of self-arising wisdom, the Sugata's heart-essence, arises as basis-appearances,
[68] In the moment of transcending the basis, recognizing self-appearance—the precious cavity spontaneously accomplished by three self-arising dharmas,
[69] The great primordial purity, the exhaustion-place of beginning,
[70] Seizing the conquered place in the youth vase body's field,
[71] Having reached the end of abandon-realize qualities, becoming Buddha in the nature of dharmakāya, abiding in inner clarity.
[72] From the potency and blessing of that, the field pervaded by five wisdoms, self-appearing, spontaneous, dense—the maṇḍala arranged pervading the limits of sky, each of the five families as self-appearances, abiding beyond the trainee's objects.
[73] Then, long after, from the primordial basis arising as basis-appearance, seeing beings move like dreams, appearing like confusion without cause of confusion,
[74] Compassionate mind arises, arranging fields for the purpose of beings.
[75] From the appearance-aspect of self-appearing enjoyment-complete kāya, the kāyas of the five-family Buddhas, the great ocean, arranged at the limits of sky.
