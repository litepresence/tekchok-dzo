[2867] From the Uttaratantra Commentary:

[2868] All paths of truth are compounded.

[2869] All compounds are merely conventional.

[2870] That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—the essence of emptiness—along with the subsequent measuring wisdom, the peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.

[2871] Divided: the nominal ultimate and the verbal ultimate.

[2872] These two: the non-nominal ultimate and the truly authentic ultimate.

[2873] First: through reasoning that examines and dissects, when nothing is established as dharma-nature, wisdom that realizes all as primordially dwelling arises in accord with its nature.

[2874] As the Two Truths state:

[2875] "Negating arising and so forth is the ultimate,
[2876] And thinking also accordant purpose."

[2877] When all elaborations of arising cease and peace is attained,
[2878] This is termed "the ultimate."

[2879] Thus.

[2880] Second:

[2881] Phenomena, primordial from the very beginning, transcend all elaborations of existence and non-existence; their sphere of existence is pure by its very nature.

[2882] As the Root Wisdom states:

[2883] "Peace that is not known from elsewhere,
[2884] Conceptuality is nothing, meaning is not differentiated.
[2885] Non-elaboration through all elaborations."

[2886] This is its characteristic.

[2887] Thus.

[2888] Second: the stages of knowing and practicing.

[2889] Whether the bodhisattva householder has taken the vow of the lay practitioner or not, it is suitable.

[2890] If fully ordained, one enters the ten places of novice discipline.

[2891] The bhikshu discipline consists of two hundred and fifty.

[2892] Based upon the bhikshuni discipline of three hundred and sixty-three,

[2893] Generating the mind of great Vehicle aspiration and entering,

[2894] Abiding in the eighty-five training sutras,

[2895] The four establishments of mindfulness in the small path of accumulation,

[2896] The four correct abandonments in the medium path,

[2897] The four miraculous feet in the great path,

[2898] The five faculties of heat and peak in the path of preparation,

[2899] The five strengths of patience and supreme dharma in the peak path,

[2900] The seven limbs of the path of enlightenment in the path of seeing,

[2901] The eight aspects of the superior paths in the nine grounds of meditation,

[2902] Completing with complete signs of heat in the great joy of the ground-paths.
