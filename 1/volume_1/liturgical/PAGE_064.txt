[2247] The Samkhyas hold views as follows:
[2248] Atoms,
[2249] Darkness,
[2250] And three energies—they hold these as permanent.
[2251] They also hold that delusion is the basis of action.
[2252] Attachment produces happiness.
[2253] Anger turns back armies.
[2254] This is the doctrine of the Samkhyas.
[2255] The Vaisesika view is as follows:

[2262] Abiding at the end of trace emptiness.
[2263] The Kumaralabha tenets hold:
[2264] Mind is nonexistent; body is nonexistent.
[2265] When mind is nonexistent, body is also nonexistent.
[2266] When mind is nonexistent, at the abandonment of body, all is empty and nonexistent.
[2267] The Karnaputra tenets are as follows:
[2268] They see appearance as permanent through circumstances.

[2271] Such is also the accepted doctrine of Karnaputra.
