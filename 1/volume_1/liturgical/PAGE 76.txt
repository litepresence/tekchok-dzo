[2787] First, considered to become blue;
[2788] Then, type red;
[2789] Type remaining and
[2790] Likewise type swollen and
[2791] Likewise type worm-entered and
[2792] Type scattered.
[2793] Likewise type white.
[2794] These as antidotes to attachment—
[2795] The eight unpleasant meditations.
[2796] Without listening or hearing,
[2797] Therefore called the self-enlightened vehicle.
[2798] So it is said.
[2799] Third, establishing the Bodhisattva vehicle has two aspects:
[2800] How it surpasses the lesser vehicle,
[2801] And explaining the especially superior vehicle itself.
[2802] First:
[2803] Made special through great compassion as method and wisdom realizing both selflessnesses.
[2804] From the Ratnavali:
[2805] "Emptiness with compassion as essence—
[2806] This accomplishes enlightenment for some."
[2807] Thus it is said, and:
[2808] "Through compassion alone,
[2809] Connection to existence continues until enlightenment.
[2810] From that Listener vehicle,
[2811] Without explaining the bodhisattva's aspiration and
[2812] Dedication of conduct,
[2813] How could it become the Great Vehicle?"
[2814] Thus it is said, and
[2815] From the Compendium:
[2816] "Without method, separated from wisdom, one falls into the Listener state"—
[2817] Thus extensively taught.
[2818] Second, five aspects:
[2819] The essence of the Bodhisattva vehicle:
[2820] Realizing all Dharmas as space-like, and through great compassion becoming the supreme method or cause for vast conduct benefiting others.
[2821] From that itself:
[2822] "This vehicle, like space, is a great measureless palace,
[2823] Supreme for manifestly obtaining joy and bliss.
[2824] Mounting that, all beings reverse suffering.
[2825] Therefore by that cause it is called the Great Vehicle."
[2826] So it is said.
[2827] Definition: Depending on whatever method, leading to the supreme great city of liberation—thus the Great Vehicle.
[2828] Purpose: Causing those with supreme minds to obtain Buddhahood.
[2829] Fruit: Accomplishing the all-illuminating ground, the eleventh.
[2830] Divisions: Though many,
