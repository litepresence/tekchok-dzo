[8108] [8108] Gurus who have obtained siddhi, even with a single fragment, obtain complete empowerment for the student,
[8109] [8109] Accomplishing as said,
[8110] [8110] Those who have not obtained siddhi accomplish meaning by empowering that all combined.
[8111] [8111] From that arrangement of four empowerments:
[8112] [8112] First: colored-powder maṇḍala, deity,
[8113] [8113] Vase,
[8114] [8114] Student preparation complete,
[8115] [8115] Vase action preceding: eight auspicious substances,
[8116] [8116] Seven royal possessions,
[8117] [8117] Empowering peaceful-wrathful body with tsaka-li or protruding or statue image, blessing with vajra, name empowerment,
[8118] [8118] Empowering with poti of command and seal,
[8119] [8119] Completing activity with glory torma empowerment—called vase empowerment.
[8120] [8120] Then giving two bodhicittas—secret empowerment.
[8121] [8121] Then: attachment-free mudrā meditation,
[8122] [8122] Empowering merely by respecting mudrā,
[8123] [8123] Two: empowering the attached with actual action seal—
[8124] [8124] Prajñā-jñāna.
[8125] [8125] That is called not-realized cause-indicating empowerment.
[8126] [8126] Then fourth, word empowerment:
[8127] [8127] Realization wisdom empowerment,
[8128] [8128] External: view,
[8129] [8129] Internal: meditation,
[8130] [8130] Empowering three: secret rigpa.
[8131] [8131] Self-introducing rigpa through introduction,
[8132] [8132] Directly viewing meaning,
[8133] [8133] Called rigpa-potency empowerment: transmitting recognition by dividing into three—pressing essential point of arise-release.
[8134] [8134] Thus the definite four empowerments:
[8135] [8135] Arrangement of middling elaboration-with.
[8136] [8136] Condensed elaboration-with:
[8137] [8137] Called meaning-elaboration,
[8138] [8138] First: entering self and student into colored-powder maṇḍala indicating five rigpa wisdoms,
[8139] [8139] Vase,
[8140] [8140] Secret,
[8141] [8141] Prajñā-jñāna,
[8142] [8142] Empowering Dzogchen complete word empowerment with four signs, making festival.
[8143] [8143] This is the sequence of actual empowerment from Vimala to Legé-tsün.
