[76] [76] The precious wheel of mudra,
[77] [77] The vajra,
[78] [78] The jewel,
[79] [79] The lotus,
[80] [80] And crosswise, appearing within, from the lotus-born, upon the upper portion, twenty-five fields,
[81] [81] In the sphere where from pore-holes streams of perfume-water flow like a great ocean,
[82] [82] Earth,
[83] [83] Water,
[84] [84] Fire,
[85] [85] And subtle wind particles, as many as there are, pervading all places,
[86] [86] The blessings of Buddha,
[87] [87] And the diverse fields of beings' karma,
[88] [88] Round,
[89] [89] Four-cornered,
[90] [90] Crescent,
[91] [91] And semi-circle and so forth—forms and arrangements immeasurable, inconceivable, appearing—
[92] [92] To the extent that sky pervades, to that extent body,
[93] [93] Speech,
[94] [94] Mind,
[95] [95] Qualities,
[96] [96] Activities,
[97] [97] And fields arising from those pervade,
[98] [98] Serving the purpose of beings in the perpetual continuous wheel.
[99] [99] This is the training field and activities of the one, the first Samantabhadra.
[100] [100] Vast like the dharma-sphere and the sky-field,
[101] [101] From this first time only having arisen—years and eons, the field-particles like an ocean cannot be measured,
[102] [102] Finally, these activities being complete cannot measure the latter end,
[103] [103] In the great field-ocean possessing the essence of unmoving spontaneity,
[104] [104] The Buddha naturally spontaneously accomplished, lama of all samsara and nirvana, having come in beginningless time,
[105] [105] Arranging fields as three different appearances of the three bodies.
[106] [106] In the time of dharma-body,
[107] [107] Called the field of luminous-clarity vajra-essence.
[108] [108] In the time of self-appearing enjoyment-complete body,
[109] [109] Called the field of Brahma's drum-sound, or the great-Brahma eon and field.
[110] [110] In this sense, the emanation Buddha of Samantabhadra himself,
[111] [111] And those teachers who came in the three times, becoming Buddha through that blessing.
