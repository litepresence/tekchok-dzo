[3883] [3883] Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping.
[3884] [3884] Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping.
[3885] [3885] When divided, there are two:
[3886] [3886] The oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness,
[3887] [3887] The oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.
[3888] [3888] The first:
[3889] [3889] Through the vital-point wind abiding in the channels, the mind's own diligence through instruction—from the very source of dharmatā, the activity of averting harm,
[3890] [3890] Through that spreading, the essential point of severing the debate between buddhas and sentient beings,
[3891] [3891] Through the wind vital-point descending into the body, the essential point of severing the connection between body and mind,
[3892] [3892] Through the root wind exhausted in the extreme, the essential point of arising's self-liberation.
[3893] [3893] The second:
[3894] [3894] Through the vast expanse's aspect—never departing anywhere—the pervasion and estimation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3895] [3895] Through essence-grasping being free in dharmadhātu's emptiness, the estimation of phenomena's transformation,
[3896] [3896] Through non-fabrication in the expanse, that-which-is-called self-arisen wisdom.
[3897] [3897] The essence of the self-arising tantra's instruction—all commands' source—is clear in the arising ground.
[3898] [3898] The unique is cut by the axe of distinctive knowing.
[3899] [3899] Through non-duality in self-nature, the cessation of saṃsāra's reliance,
[3900] [3900] Through characteristic not established as words or letters,
[3901] [3901] Emptiness is free from the ground of dispute.
[3902] [3902] When divided, there are four:
[3903] [3903] Commanded in the manner of view's thorough investigation,
[3904] [3904] Commanded in the manner of removing obscurations,
[3905] [3905] Commanded in the manner of bringing forth the hidden to manifestation,
[3906] [3906] Commanded in the manner of self-clarifying explanation.
[3907] [3907] The first:
[3908] [3908] Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground,
[3909] [3909] Action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation,
[3910] [3910] Through self-nature's emptiness arising in all aspects—action, virtue, and non-virtue not abandoned—buddhas and sentient beings do not exist.
[3911] [3911] Through characteristic not established as words or letters, the dharma of all vehicles—through non-transcendence—is the essential point of the single sovereign's path.
[3912] [3912] When divided: the view clinging to appearance and concept—non-arising,
[3913] [3913] The investigation of mind's realization—all doubts released—these are two.
[3914] [3914] The first:
