[13526] Body's two wheels abandoned, collection-dharmas scattered by wind,
[13527] By water's gatherer gathered as one,
[13528] Like well-conceived embryo-change seed abiding,
[13529] By earth's weight pressed, quaking and shifting, strength deteriorated.
[13530] Then by fire's power heat lowered, hot contact experienced,
[13531] Like blazing fire burning those radiations,
[13532] Made minute particles.
[13533] Then on the third channel-night, by wind's power those minute particles all quaking-moving-shifting,
[13534] Wind gathered inside, scattered all directions, individually separated.
[13535] At this time, four sufferings experienced:
[13536] By water cold-contact made—mere suffering,
[13537] By earth's weight pressed—
[13538] Suffering by suffering,
[13539] By fire burned—changing suffering,
[13540] By wind scattered—falling-fear's cause, formation-suffering.
[13541] Thus by four days, four elements' own power exhausted,
[13542] Two elements gathering's power's time,
[13543] Taste-gathering channel-petal thirty-two individually ripened, within each—wisdom and
[13544] Light and
[13545] Wind's tone and
[13546] Syllable and
[13547] Light-mass and
[13548] Samantabhadra father-mother's body each ripened—
[13549] Arisen without anyone doing—thus "self-arisen" is called.
[13550] Thus by elements gathering, channels generated,
[13551] By channels' power, body generated,
[13552] By body's power, faculties generated,
[13553] By faculties' power, limbs generated,
[13554] By limbs' power, flesh-blood-heat-breath generated,
[13555] By those four—bones,
[13556] Marrow,
[13557] Fat generated,
[13558] By those—skin and
[13559] Lymph and
[13560] Spittle etc. generated,
[13561] By that—tendons,
[13562] Veins,
[13563] Arteries generated,
[13564] By that—sinews generated,
[13565] By that—all-complete bindu generated,
[13566] By that—again body's wind-mind gathering four generated—
