[1542] [1542] Such is the final end.
[1543] [1543] From that point, all vessels and essences are utterly destroyed.
[1544] [1544] These as well—the three abodes of destruction and emptiness—
[1545] [1545] In this uncommon vehicle, the intermediate eons are counted as equal: sixty by sixty, comprising the first great eon of one hundred eighty duration-measures.
[1546] [1546] The duration-eon of one hundred eighty is termed the "intermediate eon, the second."
[1547] [1547] The intermediate eon of one hundred eighty is considered the "single great eon."
[1548] [1548] These also arise from the very nature of transformation.
[1549] [1549] This transformation of time unfolds as follows:
[1550] [1550] From the primordial measureless beginning,
[1551] [1551] Through the ten terminal intervals,
[1552] [1552] There is ascent and descent, birth and diminishment.
[1553] [1553] Disease, famine, weapons, and strife—
[1554] [1554] Three lesser eons bridge the intervals.
[1555] [1555] The sixty are exhausted by fire,
[1556] [1556] Seven by fire, seven by water.
[1557] [1557] Thus fourteen are completed,
[1558] [1558] And the remainder is dissolved by wind.
[1559] [1559] Thus the sixty abide,
[1560] [1560] And the duration of destruction is of similar measure.
[1561] [1561] The interval of sixty abides as emptiness.
[1562] [1562] Thus from one hundred eighty,
[1563] [1563] The first duration-eon is established.
[1564] [1564] Thus one hundred eighty
[1565] [1565] Constitute the second intermediate eon.
[1566] [1566] Thus that which is joined together is
[1567] [1567] The single great eon.
[1568] [1568] Thus it is taught.
[1569] [1569] These detailed explanations with their definitive meanings are
[1570] [1570] As extensively taught in the extensive tantra of the wish-fulfilling tree.
[1571] [1571] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[1572] [1572] The presentation of the world of vessels and essences, in two volumes.
[1573] [1573] Thus having instructed and shown the sequence of vessels and essences,
[1574] [1574] Now, regarding the enumeration of phenomena and aggregates existing in the elements of those three vajra-states:
[1575] [1575] From the tantra of the union of sun and moon:
[1576] [1576] The elements, the aggregates,
[1577] [1577] The sense-sources, the powers,
[1578] [1578] The objects and the awarenesses possessed of duration—
[1579] [1579] How they abide shall be definitively set forth.
[1580] [1580] Thus the meaning has five aspects:
[1581] [1581] The joy of the element-objects.
