[2684] Through meditation, knowledge becomes clear and bright;
[2685] Mind itself is realized as empty.
[2686] Thus delusion and suffering are abandoned.
[2687] Through these fourfold contemplations,
[2688] Four fruits are obtained.
[2689] What are these four fruits?
[2690] The fruit of meditating on cessation
[2691] Is the attainment of stream-entry—
[2692] From the ground of great joy obtained,
[2693] Thus up to the seventh ground.
[2694] Through the nature of meditating on origin,
[2695] The once-returner is obtained,
[2696] Attained up to the eighth ground.
[2697] Through the excellence of meditating on the path,
[2698] The fruit of foe-destroyer is obtained,
[2699] Perfected on the tenth ground.
[2700] When dwelling on the grounds and mother,
[2701] They listen and make others hear.
[2702] Heroes below the seventh ground
[2703] Listen to their own masters.
[2704] Heroes below the eighth ground
[2705] Wish to listen to the emanation body—
[2706] Yet they do not see it as an entity,
[2707] But hear through blessing-power.
[2708] Thus the Listener vehicle holds this view.
[2709] So it is said.
[2710] Second, regarding the Self-Enlightened vehicle, five aspects:
[2711] Essence:
[2712] Through partial self-benefit, without depending on an enlightenment teacher, manifesting at the end of existence through the method of realizing both half and complete selflessness.
[2713] Definition: Thinking oneself alone becomes Buddha.
[2714] Purpose: Obtaining medium enlightenment for liberation from samsara.
[2715] Fruit: The two foe-destroyers.
[2716] Divisions:
[2717] Like crows, flock-gathered, and
[2718] Like rhinoceroses, dwelling alone—of these two,
[2719] The rhinoceros focuses on phenomena gathered in the four truths,
[2720] Meditating on twelve links of dependent arising in forward order,
[2721] Wishing to abandon all subtle defilements of the three realms.
[2722] These arise from ignorance as cause to formative forces;
[2723] From these, consciousness to aging-and-death, knowing before-after cause-effect;
[2724] The view of the person-self and
[2725] Half the Dharma-self, outer grasping of atoms with parts and without parts, both non-existent,
