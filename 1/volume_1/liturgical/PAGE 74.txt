[2684] Through meditation, knowledge becomes clear and bright; mind itself is realized as empty. Thus delusion and suffering are abandoned. Through these fourfold contemplations, four fruits are obtained. What are these four fruits? The fruit of meditating on cessation is the attainment of stream-entry—from the ground of great joy obtained, thus up to the seventh ground. Through the nature of meditating on origination, the once-returner is obtained, attained up to the eighth ground. Through the excellence of meditating on the path, the fruit of foe-destroyer is obtained, perfected on the tenth ground.

[2700] When dwelling on the grounds and mother, they listen and make others hear. Heroes below the seventh ground listen to their own masters. Heroes below the eighth ground wish to listen to the emanation body—yet they do not see it as an entity, but hear through blessing-power. Thus the hearer vehicle holds this view.

[2710] Second, regarding the self-enlightened vehicle, five aspects: Essence: through partial self-benefit, without depending on an enlightenment teacher, manifesting at the end of existence through the method of realizing both half and complete selflessness. Definition: thinking oneself alone becomes Buddha. Purpose: obtaining medium enlightenment for liberation from samsara. Fruit: the two foe-destroyers. Divisions: like crows, flock-gathered, and like rhinoceroses, dwelling alone—of these two, the rhinoceros focuses on phenomena gathered in the four truths, meditating on twelve links of dependent arising in forward order, wishing to abandon all subtle defilements of the three realms. These arise from ignorance as cause to formative forces; from these, consciousness to aging-and-death, knowing before-after cause-effect; the view of the person-self and half the dharma-self, outer grasping of atoms with parts and without parts, both non-existent.
