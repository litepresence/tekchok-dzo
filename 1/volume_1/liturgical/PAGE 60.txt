[1983] When adventitious causes and conditions gather, the result becomes a sentient being.
[1984] Also, from good causes and conditions, good results are accomplished.
[1985] Like when a king's daughter is seen to arise from beautiful queens. Thus it is held.
[1986] The propounder of severance of results is:
[1987] The son of Katika with a hunchback,
[1988] And others like Mipam wearing a hair blanket.
[1989] For present beings, there is not only no previous life.
[1990] There is also no latent cause producing the arising mind.
[1991] It is merely the arising of nature itself.
[1992] Without a maker, sharp thorns,
[1993] The sun arises and rises.
[1994] Water falls from waterfalls—not from causes, but naturally formed, primordially arising.
[1995] Dying without continuation, the next life's result is absolutely nonexistent. Thus it is held.
[1996] From the Black Tantra of Ishvara:
[1997] The sun rises, rivers fall,
[1998] Sharp, long thorns,
[1999] Beautiful peacocks' tails,
[2000] Beautiful kings' sons—
[2001] None made these; they arise from nature itself.
[2002] Cessation is not nonexistent, nor is the future existent.
[2003] All this is merely adventitious confusion, conceptually designated.
[2004] Thus it is taught.
[2005] When refuted that the scripture becomes meaningless,
[2006] The answer is also this:
[2007] On the side of cause severance:
[2008] Without a previous mind, the present coarse arising mind exists, and when it ripens as a sentient being here,
[2009] Without habituating the nonexistent nature, later from death, the four elements' latents also,
[2010] If the mind does not enter liberation, the scripture's meaning exists.
[2011] Without habituating the nonexistent, at death, the body of four elements—earth, water, fire, wind—dissolves into the four elements of outer objects.
[2012] This knowledge also divides into four and destroys the nature of afflictions. Thus it is taught.
