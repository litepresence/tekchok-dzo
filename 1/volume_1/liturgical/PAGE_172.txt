[6846] [6846] From the Rangshar:
[6847] [6847] "Great power of faith and diligence,
[6848] [6848] Great wisdom and without attachment,
[6849] [6849] Great humility and secret mantra conduct,
[6850] [6850] Mind without concept, not distracted,
[6851] [6851] Possessing samaya, diligent in practice,
[6852] [6852] Possessing steady, clear, longing devotion,
[6853] [6853] Conducting meditation lucid and natural,
[6854] [6854] Conducting as the guru spoke,
[6855] [6855] Not abandoning samaya casually,
[6856] [6856] Conduct agreeable with others' conduct,
[6857] [6857] Mind gentle through manner of respect,
[6858] [6858] Following and holding even one word of teaching,
[6859] [6859] Conducting thus for one's own benefit,
[6860] [6860] Making the secret-seeking place endure,
[6861] [6861] Not transgressing from the vajra's meaning,
[6862] [6862] Relying on the person of great learning,
[6863] [6863] Not transgressing from one's own benefit,
[6864] [6864] Speaking gently without arrogant words,
[6865] [6865] Making agreeable entry with others' minds,
[6866] [6866] Making guru and Tathāgata
[6867] [6867] Without difference, of one manner—
[6868] [6868] That is the student's characteristic.
[6869] [6869] Thus possessing student
[6870] [6870] Is spoken as a vessel of Great Perfection."
[6871] [6871] Thus it is spoken.
[6872] [6872] Incidentally, the student to be abandoned:
[6873] [6873] From that itself:
[6874] [6874] "Not doing honor and humility,
[6875] [6875] Conducting secret mantra carelessly,
[6876] [6876] Without family lineage and without natural lineage,
[6877] [6877] Having become small in wisdom,
[6878] [6878] Disregarding kindness,
[6879] [6879] Speaking one's own family lineage,
[6880] [6880] Putting good ornaments on the body,
[6881] [6881] Having become spread without meaning,
[6882] [6882] Master's enemy, student not examined,
[6883] [6883] To person not taking into practice,
[6884] [6884] The meaning of Great Perfection not explained."
[6885] [6885] Thus it is spoken.
[6886] [6886] Also, that bad vessel cannot hold good content,
[6887] [6887] Like lion's milk cannot be held in a clay vessel.
[6888] [6888] If poured, the greatness of Dharma is lost, and
[6889] [6889] From that bad vessel, that one goes to lower realms;
[6890] [6890] To such bad vessel, it must be secret.
[6891] [6891] From that itself:
[6892] [6892] "The meaning of Great Perfection oral instructions,
[6893] [6893] Do not pour generally into bad vessel;
[6894] [6894] The essence of some possessing faith,
[6895] [6895] If poured into bad vessel,
[6896] [6896] Makes both content and vessel ruined.
[6897] [6897] Therefore, secret to those of inferior mind."
[6898] [6898] Thus it is spoken.
[6899] [6899] Third, the Dharma to be made common, three:
