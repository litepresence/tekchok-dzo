[1902] The mistaken vehicle is like this:
[1903] It holds the three hundred sixty components of existence.
[1904] Thus it has two aspects:
[1905] The generally taught self-nature of eternalism and nihilism,
[1906] And specifically explained as those types.
[1907] First, the two:
[1908] The eternalist view, and
[1909] The nihilist view.
[1910] First, although the outsider traditions hold many various views,
[1911] The Sāṃkhyas, who propound eternalism of cause, are the foremost of all doctrines.
[1912] First explained is:
[1913] The dust of darkness.
[1914] The essence of the three equal portions of potency is called "self."
[1915] In the hearts of all beings, there are forms corresponding to the size of a thumb.
[1916] The large ones are the size of a thumb.
[1917] The small ones are in sesame pods.
[1918] The even smaller ones are like sesame grains, and so forth.
[1919] White,
[1920] Oily,
[1921] Coiled,
[1922] Without breaking or destroying,
[1923] Existing hiddenly as the self that no one sees.
[1924] Now, the essence of the dust of darkness.

[1928] Later, at liberation,
[1929] At the top of the heavens, appearing like a white umbrella surrounded completely, with the color and form of liberation.
[1930] Now, the self-nature of that, the essence without movement.
[1931] Free from action and activity.
[1932] Deeply knowing objects.
[1933] Since this self-nature existing eternally through time is not known, one is in samsara.
[1934] Knowing that essence without distraction, one is liberated. By practicing well sacrifices and offerings in this life,
[1935] One is born into the complete enjoyment of one's retinue and power in the higher realms.
[1936] From this, branched into many individual traditions.
[1937] Entering from:
[1938] The self that is not the consumer, the eternal entity, the agent.
[1939] Examined by the Sāṃkhyas without qualities.
[1940] Based on slight distinctions,
[1941] The traditions of the Tīrthikas became different.
[1942] Thus it is taught.
[1943] The propounder of nihilism:
