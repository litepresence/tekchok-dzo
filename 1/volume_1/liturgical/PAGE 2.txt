[36] Teacher perfections possess complete Buddha Samantabhadra, together with hosts of wisdom-ocean retinue,
[37] Abides in the meaning where body and wisdom are inseparable,
[38] Teaching the nature of Dharma-body beyond cause-effect and effort,
[39] The time beyond action-effort in Dharma-nature,
[40] Abiding in the primordial sphere of subtle, inner clear wisdom.
[41] From that nature or blessing, the self-appearing field of dense arrangement,
[42] When adorned with outer clear five lights, the individual teachers of the five families self-appear as play of the mandala,
[43] The teaching of Dharma-nature, light-clear Dzogchen, self-appearing spontaneously accomplished,
[44] Abiding in great self-possessed wisdom,
[45] Self-appearing beyond even the action-object of pure karma trainees.
[46] From the strength of that blessing, in Akanistha, the field of marks-complete Vajradhara, dense arrangement, the sixth teacher Vajradhara arises in the form of qualities-complete body,
[47] With retinue perfections dwelling on earth,
[48] Awareness-holders,
[49] Dakinis,
[50] Accomplished ones,
[51] And hosts completely arranged as self-appearances—to inconceivable ones, teaching ocean-number tantra-sections of the result-vajra vehicle,
[52] When place perfections appear individually to beings' self-appearances,
[53] The teacher perfections in emanation-body appear as holy guides to tame each according to their nature,
[54] When karma and aspiration are pure, teaching perfections of sutra-sections,
[55] Vinaya,
[56] And Abhidharma-sections appear as various vehicles.
[57] That-to, the three vehicles of causation-characteristics are shown as cause and method for entering the result-vajra vehicle,
[58] While the secret mantra vajra vehicle, completely complete peak, the holy result, is the unsurpassable vehicle of Dzogchen.
[59] That definite place is the teaching of light-clear vajra-essence,
[60] The self-nature wondrous and marvellous, the great complete vajra place of the unsurpassable secret of all Tathagatas' minds.
[61] Thus from the Treasury of the Secret King:
[62] After the primordial protector's manifest enlightenment, the ocean of manners in which fields are arranged,
[63] And the manner of obtaining peace in this field through Vajradhara's emanation,
[64] From the manner of turning the Dharma-wheel through the elaboration of emanation-body—
[65] First, before all, without opening, dividing, or separation of samsara and nirvana anywhere,
[66] The teacher complete in possession, Samantabhadra himself,
[67] From the primordial basis, the sphere of self-arising wisdom, the essence of the Sugata, arises as basis-appearance,
[68] In the moment of transcending the basis, recognizing self-appearance—the precious cave spontaneously accomplished by three self-arising dharmas,
[69] The great primordial purity, the end-place of beginning,
[70] Seizing the conquered place in the youth vase body's field,
[71] Having reached the end of abandon-realize qualities, becoming Buddha in the nature of Dharma-body, abiding in inner clarity.
[72] From the strength of that blessing, the mandala of self-appearing spontaneous dense arrangement field pervaded by five wisdoms, reaching the limits of sky, arranged as five families' individual self-appearances, abiding beyond trainees' objects.
[73] Then, long after, from the strength of primordial basis arising as basis-appearance, seeing beings move like dreams, appearing like confusion without cause of confusion,
[74] Compassionate mind arises, arranging fields for the purpose of beings.
[75] From the aspect-of-appearance of self-appearing enjoyment-complete body, the bodies of five-families Buddhas, the Great Ocean, arranged reaching the limits of sky.
[76] The precious wheel of mudra,
[77] Vajra,
[78] Jewel,
[79] Lotus,
[80] And cross, appearing inside, from lotus-born, upon the upper part, twenty-five fields,
[81] In the sphere where from pore-holes flow streams of perfume-water like great ocean,
[82] Earth,
[83] Water,
[84] Fire,
[85] And wind particles, subtle as number, in all places,
[86] Buddha blessings,
[87] And different fields of beings' karma,
[88] Round,
[89] Four-cornered,
[90] Crescent,
[91] And semi-circle etc., forms and arrangements immeasurable, inconceivable, appearing—
[92] As far as sky pervades, to that extent body,
[93] Speech,
[94] Mind,
[95] Qualities,
[96] Activities,
[97] And fields arising from those pervade,
[98] Making the purpose of beings in the permanent continuous wheel.
[99] This is the training-field and activities of the first Samantabhadra.
[100] Vast like Dharma-sphere and sky-field,
[101] From this first time only arising—years and eons, field particles ocean cannot measure,
[102] Finally these activities complete cannot measure the later end,
[103] In the great field ocean possessing the essence of unmoving spontaneous accomplishment,
[104] The nature-spontaneously-accomplished Buddha, lama of all samsara-nirvana, having come from beginningless time,
[105] Arranging fields as three different appearances of three bodies.
[106] In the time of Dharma-body,
[107] Called the field of light-clear vajra-essence.
[108] In the time of self-appearing enjoyment-complete body, called the field of Brahma drum-sound.
[109] In the time of emanation-body, called the Great-Brahma eon or field.
[110] In this meaning, the emanation Buddha of Samantabhadra himself,
[111] And those teachers who came in the three times, becoming Buddha through that blessing,
[112] All sentient-beings realms exist.
[113] The training-field is very vast.
[114] That also—all earth, water, fire, wind, sky where pervading, gathered within the Great-Brahma eon.
[115] Then, when numberless fields beyond measure appear even in one particle place of sentient-beings' confusion-appearance,
[116] To pure karma appearance, Buddha's great activities appear variously,
[117] Again nirvana,
[118] Teaching dwelling,
[119] Path accomplishment etc., to impure ones enjoying bliss-results of higher-realms and liberation, teaching subsides,
[120] Appearing as lower-realms,
[121] Eon destruction etc., enjoying various bliss-suffer appearances—
[122] Like a dream.
[123] Thus, even in one particle place, great fields of mountains and continents etc. appear—
[124] Beings' confusion-appearance, clear-appearance without truth, thus valid.
[125] As said in the Arya Samadhi King Sutra:
[126] Even in the extent of a hair-tip, many Buddhas,
[127] As many as Ganga's river sands,
[128] Those Victors' fields also that many,
[129] Those characteristics different, eons not the same,
[130] In the extent of a hair, the five realms,
[131] Sentient hells and animals' realm,
[132] Yama world, gods and humans dwell,
[133] Not mixed, not becoming harm,
[134] In those places, lakes and oceans,
[135] Rivers, likewise lakes and pools,
[136] Not mixed, not becoming harm,
[137] Thus the Victor's Dharma inconceivable,
[138] In that place, many mountains,
[139] Surrounding Sumeru, great Sumeru,
[140] Btang-zung and great btang-zung,
[141] 'Bigs-byed, vulture-heap, snow mountain,
[142] In that place, unbearable hell-beings,
[143] Hot and very hot, unpleasant experience,
[144] Then hell-beings' feeling,
[145] Makes them experience following those sufferings,
[146] In that place, gods' palaces,
[147] Those twelve leagues pleasant,
[148] Even by many thousand gods,
[149] Gods' joy, very bliss experienced,
[150] In that place Buddhas open,
[151] Teaching of world-knowledge blazes appearing,
[152] In that place itself, Dharma subsides,
[153] Sound of guide's nirvana also heard,
[154] Humans in their own houses like dreams,
[155] Intoxicated with joy in desire qualities,
[156] Waking after, that desire not seen,
[157] That is known as dream by that,
[158] Thus see, hear, know and understand distinction,
[159] All these not true, like dream.
[160] Thus,
[161] Thus in the world of one particle place, even in appearing subtle particles, sentient-beings' fields and arrangements are immeasurable.
[162] Thus in the world of one particle place, even in appearing subtle particles, sentient-beings' fields and arrangements are immeasurable.
