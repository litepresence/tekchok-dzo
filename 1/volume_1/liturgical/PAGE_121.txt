[4519] The Snake-Knot Tantra: self-liberated words shown like a snake-knot—rigpa self-liberated.
[4520] The Great Garuda Tantra: appearing like one who goes without effort in space—view tantra.
[4521] The Samantabhadra Mind-Mirror Tantra.
[4522] The River Tantra: empowerment and blessings flowing like a river—dzogchen self-arisen.
[4523] The King's Throne Tantra: unchanging royal lineage, throne conquered—body-relic blazing.
[4524] The Treasury Tantra: whatever desired arises from the wealthy treasury—jewel heap.
[4525] The Razor Tantra: razor-edge cuts whatever it touches, striking contradiction—eighteen wrathful black ones.
