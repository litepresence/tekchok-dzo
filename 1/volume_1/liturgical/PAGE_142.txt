[5465] [5465] KAṂ KĀ is called. The root KA is KA alone; the head-circle is KAṂ. NA RO and so forth: each subsequent [letter] is read with its long portion. That is made the power of the branch tagged to the single [letter].
[5466] [5466] For the prefix with branch tags:
[5467] [5467] "Please examine the classes of these letters carefully." Stacked letters, note 3.
[5468] [5468] For one KA-like: NA RO two, GU GU two, ZHENG BU two, foot-hook two, YA tag two, RA tag two—one affixing LA. If the head-circle and one long portion exist:
[5469] [5469] The root KA and the affixing LA two are given half of the above and below NA RO and so forth. Given to the head-circle LA, this is the giving condition for both long portions to benefit.
[5470] [5470] For example: KĪ LĪ KĀO LĀO KĒ LĒ KŪ LŪ KYŪ LŪ YA KRĀ LĀ RA LAṂ.
[5471] [5471] Thus, when LA and RA are life-discordant, the normal LA and RA tags are inserted in order and pronounced.
[5472] [5472] When many or few branches arise above and below, the remainder is given to the prefix letter and read.
[5473] [5473] The head-circle gives power to the prefix.
[5474] [5474] When the above NA RO and so forth consist of one without elongation, it is pronounced lengthened.
[5475] [5475] The NA RO and so forth—the four ornament letters—are given to the prefix.
[5476] [5476] When the below end-support, foot-hook, and so forth, each are not in a group, it is given to the root and the prefix is pronounced alone.
[5477] [5477] The example of these two: according to sequence, KMOṂ is called: KA MO KA MI KA ME MAṂ is read.
[5478] [5478] KACAR is called: KRA CA KYA CA KU CA is pronounced.
[5479] [5479] This also: the root letters are first led by the nose and pronounced before the prefix.
[5480] [5480] NA RO, GU GU, ZHENG BU, head-circle—the four ornament letters—are called "the four letters of ornament."
[5481] [5481] YA tag, RA tag, foot-hook—the three end-supports or "four support letters."
[5482] [5482] When GU GU is double-stacked on the single [letters], it is called "straight placement."
