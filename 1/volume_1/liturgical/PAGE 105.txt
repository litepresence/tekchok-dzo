[3883] Self-nature—thought-construction grasping cessation.

[3884] Characteristic—duality-free, essence-grasping-free.

[3885] When divided, twofold:

[3886] Debate exhausted in extreme of assertion,

[3887] Debate exhausted in extreme of refutation—timeless.

[3888] First:

[3889] Through vital-point's wind abiding in channel, mind's own striving through instruction—from dharmatā's expanse, averting harm,

[3890] Through that spreading, vital-point of severing buddhas-sentient beings debate,

[3891] Through wind's vital-point descending into body, vital-point of severing body-mind connection,

[3892] Through root-wind exhausted in extreme, vital-point of arising's self-liberation.

[3893] Second:

[3894] Through expanse's vast essence—never departing anywhere—saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's pervasion,

[3895] Through essence-grasping-free in dharmadhātu's emptiness, phenomena transformation's essence,

[3896] Through action-free in expanse, self-arisen wisdom, called.

[3897] Self-arising mantra's instruction essence—all command's source—clear in arising-ground.

[3899] Through non-duality in self-nature, saṃsāra's reliance cessation,

[3903] Proclaiming through view's thorough investigation,

[3904] Proclaiming through example's complete clarification,

[3905] Proclaiming through direct experience's arising,

[3906] Proclaiming through self-clarifying explanation.

[3907] First:

[3908] Pervading unelaborated essence-ground,

[3909] Action—good-bad-free, three realms' complete liberation,

[3910] Through self-nature's emptiness arising in all aspects, action—virtue-non-virtue not abandoning, buddhas and sentient beings non-existent.

[3911] Through characteristic not established as word-letter, all vehicles' dharma—not limited—single sovereign's path vital-point.

[3912] Divided: view clinging to appearance-concept—non-arising,

[3913] Investigation of mind's realization—all doubts released, twofold.

[3914] First:
