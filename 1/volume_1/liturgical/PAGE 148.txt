[5707] From the Treasury:
[5708] The first of the four introductions arising from the tantra.
[5709] Holding the seeds of the five.
[5710] Thus it is spoken.
[5711] These two perfections give rise to the fivefold reasons, namely:
[5712] Common and uncommon reasons.
[5713] First:
[5714] Whatever tantra has arisen, the teacher and retinue are therein certain to be taught.
[5715] That time and place are certain to exist.
[5716] Those gathered simultaneously arise in time.
[5717] Second:
[5718] When matter and consciousness gather, the body serves as support, placed in a certain abode.
[5719] In the field of form aggregates,
[5720] The consciousness as teacher,
[5721] Gathered with perception as retinue.
[5722] The teaching of feeling arises.
[5723] Formations have five times, certain.
[5724] Those five impure aggregates of the disciple-base are
[5725] Tamed by the five perfections of the introduction-base.
[5726] Suitable for disciple and method.
[5727] From that itself:
[5728] The individual persons of disciples.
[5729] The five types of disciple-base aggregates.
[5730] The introduction-base of that method.
[5731] Thus it is spoken.
[5732] That also is called the five perfections of the introduction-base, namely:
[5733] Basis:
[5734] Abode,
[5735] Time,
[5736] Teacher,
[5737] Retinue,
[5738] The five dharmas.
[5739] Each of those also becomes threefold.
[5740] From the Treasury:
[5741] The introduction is expressed in words.
[5742] The basis has five types.
[5743] Abode is accepted as threefold.
[5744] What is called perfection is gathered.
[5745] The three appear as numbers.
[5746] The gathering of qualities is complete.
[5747] The teacher himself is also threefold.
[5748] What is called perfection is the completion of the kāyas.
[5749] The three kāyas arise as three.
[5750] The gathering of retinue is assembled.
[5751] The retinue is also threefold.
[5752] What is called perfection is arranged in form.
[5753] The three appear as various gatherings.
[5754] The gathering of faith and aspiration.
[5755] The teaching itself is also threefold.
[5756] What is called perfection is the very essence.
[5757] The three are the precious collections.
[5758] The gathering liberates persons.
[5759] Time also has three gathering into four.
[5760] The perfection of all vehicles.
[5761] The three are past, present,
[5762] The gathering is definitively complete.
[5763] Thus.
[5764] Second, the individual meanings extensively explained in two parts.
