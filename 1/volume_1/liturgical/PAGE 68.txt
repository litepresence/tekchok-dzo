[2381] Those who think neither special meaning nor common meaning exists. Called Kabhisha. Those who think common meaning nonexistent, yet special meaning exists. Called Sindha. Those who think meaning utterly nonexistent. Called Dhasimba. Those who think meaning exists. Called Katipa. Those who think until breath is cut, meaning persists. Called Sangha—some declare entering the Sangha's feature is sufficient. Called Shamkari.

[2392] The truth of compounded impermanence. The truth of compounded impermanence and permanence. The truth of life-force or lordship. Called Doshaka.

[2396] All sutras gathered into life-force and lordship. Some declare life-force and lordship definitely exist atop Mount Meru. Thus the view of aggregates, numberless, gathered into two: permanence and interruption. From those, the view of aggregates, numberless, spread forth.

[2401] Thus all teachings gathered into four: extreme view, extreme end, distant benefit, indifference. "Extreme view" refers to eternal permanence. "Extreme end" declares permanent is permanent, impermanent is impermanent—both. "Distant benefit": half permanent, half interrupted. "Indifference": completely interrupted. These too gathered into permanence and interruption.

[2411] From the former, these and similar wrong views explained as gathered into four types: extreme view and extreme end, distant benefit and indifference. Thus the explanation: extreme view is permanent, eternal; extreme end is half-permanent, half-cut; indifferent is cut, completely cut; distant benefit is effect cut.

[2421] Thus the three hundred sixty gathered into four types, those also gathered into permanence and interruption. Thus.

[2425] The purpose of teaching these: not entering through recognizing wrong paths.
