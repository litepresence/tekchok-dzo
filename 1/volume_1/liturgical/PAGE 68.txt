[2381] Those who think neither special meaning nor common meaning exists.
[2382] Called Kabhisha—
[2383] Those who think common meaning nonexistent, yet special meaning exists.
[2384] Called Sindha—
[2385] Those who think meaning utterly nonexistent.
[2386] Called Dhasimba—
[2387] Those who think meaning exists.
[2388] Called Katipa—
[2389] Those who think interruption until breath is cut, meaning exists.
[2390] Called Sangha—some declare entering the Sangha's feature is sufficient.
[2391] Called Shamkari—
[2392] The truth of impermanence.
[2393] Compounded impermanent truth—
[2394] The truth of life-force or supreme power.
[2395] Called Doshaka—
[2396] All sutras gathered into life-force and supreme power.
[2397] Some declare life-force and supreme power definitely exist atop Mount Meru.
[2398] Thus, the view of aggregates, numberless, gathered into two.
[2399] Those are permanence and nihilism.
[2400] From those, the view of aggregates, numberless, spread forth.
[2401] Thus all teachings gathered into four:
[2402] Extreme view,
[2403] Extreme end,
[2404] Distant benefit,
[2405] And indifference.
[2405] "Extreme view" refers to eternal permanence.
[2406] "Extreme end"—
[2407] Declaring permanent is permanent, impermanent is impermanent, both.
[2408] "Distant benefit"—half permanent, half interrupted.
[2409] "Indifference"—completely interrupted,
[2410] Those also gathered into permanence and interruption.
[2411] From the former,
[2412] These and similar wrong views
[2413] Explained as gathered into four types:
[2414] Extreme view and extreme end,
[2415] Distant benefit and indifference.
[2416] Thus the explanation method:
[2417] Extreme view: permanent eternal.
[2418] Extreme end: half permanent, half interrupted.
[2419] Indifference: interrupted, completely interrupted.
[2420] Distant benefit: effect interrupted.
[2421] Thus three hundred sixty
[2422] Gathered into four types.
[2423] Those also gathered into permanence and interruption.
[2424] Thus.
[2425] The purpose of teaching these:
[2426] Not entering through recognizing wrong paths.
[2427] From those—
