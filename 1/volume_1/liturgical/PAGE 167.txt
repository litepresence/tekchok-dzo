[6630] This is the supreme one, possessing the mole-mark of A on the nose-tip,
[6631] The definite key point of oral instructions excelling others,
[6632] Prophesying the future by clairvoyance,
[6633] Clearly showing the definite difficult points,
[6634] And filling the world with definite, exceeding marks even at the time of parinirvāṇa.
[6635] Whoever meets this, liberated without effort from the town of saṃsāra, has arisen as the ornament of Jambudvīpa.
[6636] Protector of beings, extremely compassionate,
[6637] Having become the world's guru-ornament, now arisen,
[6638] Having clearly shown the teaching of Clear Light Essence,
[6639] Gone to the peaceful sphere—to you, respectful prostration.
[6640] Always holding all of saṃsāra with compassion,
[6641] Although not passing to one-sided nirvāṇa peace,
[6642] By final deed, seeing beings' benefit,
[6643] Pervading the world with wonder—to you, respectful prostration.
[6644] In the first month of autumn, peaceful,
[6645] Having relinquished body-life in the supreme forest-retreat,
[6646] Again, what marvelous blessing-compassion,
[6647] Excelling others—to you, respectful prostration.
[6648] Where the protector became parinirvāṇa,
[6649] At that time, this earth with forests moved;
[6650] The appearance of five lights pervaded the sky,
[6651] Music's sweet sound played—to you, respectful prostration.
[6652] From melting body-relics, light-rays blazing in the sky,
[6653] Adorned by ḍākinīs' offering-clouds and music,
[6654] All beings obtained non-conceptual meditation—
[6655] To the one showing limitless emanations, respectful prostration.
[6656] Siddhas, mantra-holders, and ḍākinī gatherings,
[6657] Completely surrounded by arrangements of immeasurable offering-clouds,
[6658] Gone to the field of vidyādhara-victors,
[6659] To the sky-goer who obtained siddhi, respectful prostration.
[6660] For future beings, as a supreme merit-field,
[6661] From placed body-relics, the five families came,
[6662] From the crown, the fields of five families like rainbows,
[6663] Adorned with five lights, come—to you, respectful prostration.
[6664] Wherever body-relic fragments were invited,
[6665] Even when stūpas were erected and charity was done,
[6666] Five lights' appearance pervaded the sky,
[6667] Greatly moving beings' minds—to you, respectful prostration.
[6668] Vimalamitra, protector, compassionate,
[6669] By many emanations acting for beings' benefit,
[6670] Gone as emanation-ornament to the land of Tibet,
[6671] To Kumārarāja, the teacher, respectful prostration.
[6672] This clearly expresses the prophecy of our holy master as the emanation of vidyādhara.
[6673] Thus, in Jambudvīpa, by the gathering of vidyādhara-victors holding the supreme teaching, seven generations of flourishing passed,
[6674] From passing of ten years of life:
