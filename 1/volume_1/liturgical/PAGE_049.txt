[1582] [1582] The essential nature of basis and aggregates.
[1583] [1583] The distinctive characteristics of the forms and sense-sources.
[1584] [1584] The essential nature of the powers that grasp.
[1585] [1585] The various forms of objects and their possessors.
[1586] [1586] First:
[1587] [1587] Due to the vast and extensive meaning, this is termed "element."
[1588] [1588] If divided:
[1589] [1589] Those gathered by outer objects, and
[1590] [1590] Those gathered by inner mind—these two.
[1591] [1591] First:
[1592] [1592] There are five elements.
[1593] [1593] They produce and abide as form-possessing entities.
[1594] [1594] They serve as cause, condition, basis, and nature for destruction.
[1595] [1595] Earth possesses characteristics that are firm and solid.
[1596] [1596] Water possesses characteristics that are moist and flowing.
[1597] [1597] Fire possesses characteristics that are hot and burning.
[1598] [1598] Wind possesses characteristics that move and uplift.
[1599] [1599] Space possesses characteristics that are vast and open.
[1600] [1600] Through these, vessels and essences are produced and maintained.
[1601] [1601] From that itself, the five elements gathered by outer objects are:
[1602] [1602] The earth element produces the basis of body.
[1603] [1603] The water element holds names.
[1604] [1604] The fire element ripens objects.
[1605] [1605] The wind element sustains the entire moving world.
[1606] [1606] The space element holds the powers. Thus it is taught.
[1607] [1607] The elements gathered by inner mind appear as vessel and essence, two:
[1608] [1608] Vessel appears as objects, accumulated by actions.
[1609] [1609] If divided:
[1610] [1610] Those arising from the delusion of outer object-appearing mind, and
[1611] [1611] Those arising naturally from the luminosity of inner mind—these two.
[1612] [1612] First: The latency of object-appearing mind, like a dream.
[1613] [1613] If divided:
[1614] [1614] The four desire-realm continents and so forth.
[1615] [1615] The five form-objects: lights, self-arisen, like rainbows.
[1616] [1616] The formless objects: concentrations, self-emanated, invisible to others.
[1617] [1617] From the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra.
[1618] [1618] The elements gathered by inner mind are two:
[1619] [1619] The element of vessel that gathers beings, and
[1620] [1620] The element that arises from mind itself.
[1621] [1621] The element of vessel is:
[1622] [1622] The form element arising from the vast basis of beings' mindfulness.
