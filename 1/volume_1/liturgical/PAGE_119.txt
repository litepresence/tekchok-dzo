[4417] From the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras
[4418] 4417. Buddha's all essence gathered,
[4419] 4418. Placed into all beings' hearts.
[4420] 4419. That essence: the intestine-continuum.
[4421] 4420. Since clarity not gathered, called "essence."
[4422] 4421. Thus,
[4423] From the Diligent Meaning-Possessing Tantra:
[4424] 4423. All teachings' supreme essence:
[4425] 4424. Dharmatā direct-path called.
[4426] 4425. Thus,
[4427] From the Vajra-Sky-Equality Tantra:
[4428] 4427. Basis, essence, flower:
[4429] 4428. All Buddhas' nature-tantra.
[4430] 4429. Supreme secret distinguished, essence gathered.
[4431] 4430. This to samsara's far shore,
[4432] 4431. Like an arrow-shot person.
[4433] 4432. Thus,
[4434] From the Supreme Golden Light:
[4435] 4434. Basis, nature, methods:
[4436] 4435. Relying, even to the Buddha-field,
[4437] 4436. Effortless, easy—so placed as tantra.
[4438] 4437. Thus.
[4439] The Determination of These Meanings
[4440] From the Pearl Garland:
[4441] 4440. Nature-tantra is this:
[4442] 4441. Basis, essence, quintessence itself.
[4443] 4442. Basis: essence, nature,
[4444] 4443. Compassion pervading all, arisen,
[4445] 4444. Possessing self-nature of three primordial wisdoms,
[4446] 4445. Primordially pure from stains,
[4447] 4446. The unique one of indivisibility.
[4448] 4447. All Buddhas' great secret.
[4449] 4448. Kāya: perfected essence-awareness.
[4450] 4449. Kāya's tantra: pervading emptiness.
[4451] 4450. Clarity itself is self-appearance.
[4452] 4451. Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature.
[4453] 4452. Perfect essence's nature-tantra.
[4454] 4453. All appearances are tantra,
[4455] 4454. All interconnected and clinging.
[4456] 4455. In the mandala of natural citta,
[4457] 4456. Unproduced, perfected—great essence.
[4458] 4457. Thus, gathered: essence,
[4459] 4458. Since become life's breath of all.
[4460] 4459. Explained as essence-tantra.
[4461] From the Tantra of All Buddhas' Blissful Secret
[4462] 4460. All Buddhas gathered into one,
[4463] 4461. All essences extracted,
[4464] 4462. Essence gathered—thus called essence,
[4465] 4463. Gathered into empty-clear awareness's essence.
[4466] 4464. All Buddhas' great blissful secret,
[4467] 4465. Possessing basis, essence, flower,
[4468] 4466. The very essence of all self-awareness.
[4469] 4467. Called the Great Perfection's essence,
[4470] 4468. Renowned among other tantras.
[4471] 4469. The secret tantra explained:
[4472] 4470. Scripture held by definite ones.
[4473] 4471. Nature empty, all-pervading.
[4474] 4472. That too: essence's nature.
[4475] 4473. Essence gathered, three clarities,
[4476] 4474. Three clarities, pervading cognition.
[4477] 4475. Three confidences, three non-returns—
[4478] 4476. Obtain definiteness of unchanging essence.
[4479] 4477. Three appearances, three emptinesses:
[4480] 4478. Essence: pure nature.
[4481] 4479. Established as tantra.
[4482] 4480. Basis, path, result—
[4483] 4481. Held definitively: nature-tantra.
[4484] 4482. Thus explained, tantra established.
[4485] 4483. Established through natural descent.
[4486] 4484. Thus called nature-itself tantra.
[4487] Thus,  4486. From the single nature of basis-awareness,  4487. Come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method.
