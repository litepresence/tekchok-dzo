From the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras

4417. Buddha's all essence gathered,

4418. Placed into all beings' hearts.

4419. That essence: the intestine-continuum.

4420. Since clarity not gathered, called "essence."

4421. Thus,

From the Diligent Meaning-Possessing Tantra:

4423. All teachings' supreme essence:

4424. Dharmatā direct-path called.

4425. Thus,

From the Vajra-Sky-Equality Tantra:

4427. Basis, essence, flower:

4428. All Buddhas' nature-tantra.

4429. Supreme secret distinguished, essence gathered.

4430. This to samsara's far shore,

4431. Like an arrow-shot person.

4432. Thus,

From the Supreme Golden Light:

4434. Basis, nature, methods:

4435. Relying, even to the Buddha-field,

4436. Effortless, easy—so placed as tantra.

4437. Thus.

The Determination of These Meanings

From the Pearl Garland:

4440. Nature-tantra is this:

4441. Basis, essence, quintessence itself.

4442. Basis: essence, nature,

4443. Compassion pervading all, arisen,

4444. Possessing self-nature of three primordial wisdoms,

4445. Primordially pure from stains,

4446. The unique one of indivisibility.

4447. All Buddhas' great secret.

4448. Kāya: perfected essence-awareness.

4449. Kāya's tantra: pervading emptiness.

4450. Clarity itself is self-appearance.

4451. Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature.

4452. Perfect essence's nature-tantra.

4453. All appearances are tantra,

4454. All interconnected and clinging.

4455. In the mandala of natural citta,

4456. Unproduced, perfected—great essence.

4457. Thus, gathered: essence,

4458. Since become life's breath of all.

4459. Explained as essence-tantra.

From the Tantra of All Buddhas' Blissful Secret

4460. All Buddhas gathered into one,

4461. All essences extracted,

4462. Essence gathered—thus called essence,

4463. Gathered into empty-clear awareness's essence.

4464. All Buddhas' great blissful secret,

4465. Possessing basis, essence, flower,

4466. The very essence of all self-awareness.

4467. Called the Great Perfection's essence,

4468. Renowned among other tantras.

4469. The secret tantra explained:

4470. Scripture held by definite ones.

4471. Nature empty, all-pervading.

4472. That too: essence's nature.

4473. Essence gathered, three clarities,

4474. Three clarities, pervading cognition.

4475. Three confidences, three non-returns—

4476. Obtain definiteness of unchanging essence.

4477. Three appearances, three emptinesses:

4478. Essence: pure nature.

4479. Established as tantra.

4480. Basis, path, result—

4481. Held definitively: nature-tantra.

4482. Thus explained, tantra established.

4483. Established through natural descent.

4484. Thus called nature-itself tantra.

Thus,

4486. From the single nature of basis-awareness,

4487. Come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method.
