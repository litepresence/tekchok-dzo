[1944] The Lokāyata school is:
[1945] From the appearing of the realms of seeing, hearing, pleasure, and pain as they are now,
[1946] Previous and future lives,
[1947] Actions, causes, and results,
[1948] And the existence of liberation and freedom—nothing at all is held.
[1949] This also has:
[1950] Two: the propounders of cause nihilism and result nihilism.
[1951] First:
[1952] Some, like the son of the naked one, say that the mind of before is not this current one.
[1953] There is a mind abiding by the self-nature of the four elements.
[1954] That, from the unmanifest compression of the elements,
[1955] When conditions of heat and moisture meet, that mind of latent self-nature arises.
[1956] Entering a new body with a new mind,
[1957] Becomes a sentient being.
[1958] That, abiding in the latent mind of the self-nature of earth, produces grass, trees, forests, and so forth.
[1959] Through water existing, it moistens, moves, and produces sound.
[1960] Through fire existing, it blazes and burns.
[1961] Through wind existing, movement arises—that is its essence.
[1962] Thus:
[1963] Wood, sticks,
[1964] Pebbles,
[1965] And all coarse entities have mind.
[1966] When one strikes one, sound arises.
[1967] When thrown, it goes for a reason.
[1968] Some trees wither at night and expand in the day.
[1969] When skin is peeled, it dries.
[1970] And for the sake of producing dried growth, etc.
[1971] Thus, if there is previous action and mind in the realms,
[1972] Trees and so forth also become from previous existence.
[1973] Not existing—suddenly.
[1974] Like a boil arising from the gathering of current accumulations.
[1975] How does it manifest?
[1976] From the meeting of summer heat and moisture, a small worm as long as a horse's tail goes in one direction.
[1977] What remains on the other side becomes a drum-tail.
[1978] Termites,
[1979] From insects become bees. It is known that worms become frogs.
[1980] Thus, the cause is not eternal.
[1981] In summer, when termites enter wood, pebbles,
[1982] And awns of grain, they become sentient beings.
