[373] The body-form self-born without anyone making, equal to beings' body bulk, self-arisen from twelve emanation-body blessings, from one hundred jewel causes.
[374] Those three emanations of body, speech, mind, not made by anyone, fearless.
[375] By self-arisen blessing, miracles and immeasurable qualities.
[376] Possessing the activity of immediately liberating birth when meeting with whichever.
[377] That also, the mind-support Vajra, from disease-free of those beings wishing to pacify disease,
[378] Fulfilling desires and applying to liberation.
[379] The speech-support self-arisen letter, meeting with that,
[380] Liberated by merely meeting and hearing the sound.
[381] This book, writing and holding, possesses liberating activity without effort.
[382] That body performs liberating activity into clear light when meeting with whichever body.
[383] Where these exist, one asks.
[384] They abide in different places by the times of body, speech, mind teachings.
[385] That also, from Amitayus life, from the time of thousand Buddhas, the body-taming teaching,
[386] Exists three times five hundred five thousand years.
[387] Then until seventy years of life, the speech-taming teaching,
[388] One five hundred five thousand years.
[389] Then until ten years of life, the mind-taming teaching,
[390] One five hundred five thousand years.
[391] In the interval of those life years, that much year exists but not time,
[392] The year numbers tamed by those teachings are explained.
[393] That also, at the time of body teaching, that Vajra exists in the island possessing salty taste, Uddiyana land ocean,
[394] Occasionally making countless emanations possessing light, sound, and monk miracle arise.
[395] The letter, held by dakinis in the sky above five hundred leagues of Vajra-seat, abides.
[396] The body abides together with that.
[397] At the time of speech teaching.
