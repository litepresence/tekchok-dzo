[1677] The aggregate of consciousness that knows and functions with objects.
[1678] The aggregates without thought are:
[1679] The five parts abiding in the self-awareness of individual noble beings who have transcended the world:
[1680] The aggregate of concentration, the nature of calm-abiding and insight.
[1681] The aggregate of wisdom, liberated from individual afflictions.
[1682] The aggregate of wisdom, seeing the nature of self and generality.
[1683] The aggregate of discipline, completely pure from the direction of stains.
[1684] The aggregate of complete liberation, liberated from elaboration and thought.
[1685] These, when gathered by the training path, abandon those parts and proceed further, moistening the aspect of what is to be abandoned.
[1686] The qualities of the time when one is not training are not like that.
[1687] When liberated all at once, even the name "aggregate" does not remain.
[1688] Since it is said that they are "completely liberated from aggregates," one should understand that although called "one aspect," there is no contradiction.
[1689] As it is stated in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra:
[1690] The aggregates are as follows:
[1691] The aggregates obscured by thought, and
[1692] The aggregates that are naturally free from thought.
[1693] The aggregates obscured by thought are:
[1694] As follows:
[1695] The form aggregate, when all objects are gathered and accomplished.
[1696] The feeling aggregate, when all experiences are gathered.
[1697] The perception aggregate, when the holding of all faculties is gathered.
[1698] The formation factors aggregate, when all subtle afflictions are gathered.
[1699] The consciousness aggregate, when all knowings are gathered.
[1700] The aggregates without thought are:
[1701] The aggregate of concentration, when all concentrations are gathered.
[1702] The aggregate of wisdom, complete liberation, since awareness itself is exhausted of outflows.
[1703] The aggregate of wisdom, since that meaning appears without birth.
