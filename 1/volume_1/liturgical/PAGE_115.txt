[4274] Definite term:

[4281] Showing effortless primordial liberation,

[4282] Showing with effort through sequence, two.

[4283] First:

[4284] Cutting through the basis,

[4285] The sequence of instant faculties,

[4286] Primordially liberated, again without basis, etcetera.

[4288] Three preliminaries, bringing to natural place, directly bringing to the self-key, until,

[4318] Mind, mind, slow—memory stream ceases.
