[4272] [4272] Nature:
[4273] [4273] The instruction of indicated meaning, awareness, realizing method.
[4274] [4274] Definite term:
[4275] [4275] Self-dwelling awareness's wisdom indicating,
[4276] [4276] As realizing method, gathering the key of experience, shown in one direction—thus called indicating method tantra.
[4277] [4277] Generally, explanation tantras: words long, difficult,
[4278] [4278] Instruction tantras: words clear, easy,
[4279] [4279] Great Perfection tantras are called instruction tantras.
[4280] [4280] Divided:
[4281] [4281] Showing effortless primordial liberation,
[4282] [4282] Showing with effort through sequence, two.
[4283] [4283] First:
[4284] [4284] Cutting through the basis,
[4285] [4285] The sequence of instant faculties,
[4286] [4286] Primordially liberated, again without basis, etcetera.
[4287] [4287] Second: the path of leaping over, the gradual faculties, relying on the key of channels and winds, making liberation,
[4288] [4288] Three preliminaries, bringing to natural place, directly bringing to the self-key, until,
[4289] [4289] Body key,
[4290] [4290] Door key,
[4291] [4291] Object key,
[4292] [4292] Relying on the key of wind and awareness, taking experience,
[4293] [4293] Going to the measure of four appearances, showing liberation.
[4294] [4294] Also from that same:
[4295] [4295] Those directly realizing,
[4296] [4296] Called method—also distinction.
[4297] [4297] Person's intellect's difference,
[4298] [4298] How the sequence must be explained,
[4299] [4299] Without effort and striving, self-liberation,
[4300] [4300] With effort, experience must be taken.
[4301] [4301] Effortless ones are self-pure.
[4302] [4302] Key: through three aspects,
[4303] [4303] That meaning: taking experience,
[4304] [4304] Body, door, object.
[4305] [4305] Body's key: these three,
[4306] [4306] Lion's manner, elephant's manner,
[4307] [4307] Like a rishi, must be known.
[4308] [4308] Door: that same, unmoved,
[4309] [4309] Clarifying two, unmoved,
[4310] [4310] Sky itself unmoved.
[4311] [4311] Object's key: three aspects,
[4312] [4312] Pure expanse, dwelling,
[4313] [4313] Thus awareness's nature, dwelling,
[4314] [4314] All appearances, dwelling.
[4315] [4315] Mind changeless, self-abiding,
[4316] [4316] Mind changeless, memory clear,
[4317] [4317] Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear,
[4318] [4318] Mind, mind, slow—memory stream ceases.
