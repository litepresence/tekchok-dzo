[6065] Relying upon the three kāyas,
[6066] Appear to sentient beings, objects of disciples.
[6067] Thus it is spoken.
[6068] If these manners are extensively shown:
[6069] After Vajradhara, having arranged the great Brahma aeon, passed through numberless, inconceivable aeons,
[6070] At the beginning of this field's formation,
[6071] From here, in the northern direction, in the field called "Moving-Possessing,"
[6072] Those three seeds of the teaching abide.
[6073] In that field, through the individual karma of sentient beings,
[6074] The seven times of arising of these,
[6075] The seven times of non-arising—fourteen—became flourishing and decline.
[6076] From that, the seven times of arising are:
[6077] Endowment,
[6078] Perfection,
[6079] Great Perfection,
[6080] Two-Possessing,
[6081] Three-Possessing,
[6082] Strife-Possessing,
[6083] Great Strife-Possessing.
[6084] Between each of those, declining, are called the seven dark aeons.
[6085] Then, the vessel and environment of this field formed; at the first aeon, in Tuṣita stacked,
[6086] The teacher came;
[6087] Those three seeds descended here,
[6088] Made to flourish and decline by the seven sequences,
[6089] Finally leaping to another.
[6090] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6091] Thus to this very teaching,
[6092] The remaining teaching thus,
[6093] Explained as definitively great by time.
[6094] Endowment and Perfection,
[6095] Perfections, the great,
[6096] Thus Two-Possessing and Three-Possessing,
[6097] Strife-Possessing and Great Strife,
[6098] Between each of those,
[6099] In sixty dark aeons,
[6100] The teaching's seed becomes other.
[6101] The northern direction, Moving-Possessing,
[6102] The teaching's lamp abides there,
[6103] Called "Glorious Protector,"
[6104] Monks will hold.
[6105] That patron, the king,
[6106] Called Jinamitra,
[6107] Makes the secret basis of the teaching.
[6108] Abides for one thousand three hundred years.
[6109] Then the dark aeon
[6110] Abides between sixty.
[6111] Then the southern direction, Sthalaskandha,
[6112] In the wide and beautiful continent,
[6113] The teaching's life-tree descended there,
[6114] Called "Joy-Glorious,"
[6115] By the Tuṣita family gathering,
[6116] This teaching will be held.
[6117] That patron, householder family,
[6118] Called "Virtue-Accomplishment,"
[6119] Makes to abide for a hundred years.
[6120] Then becomes the dark aeon,
[6121] Becomes one hundred twenty years.
[6122] Then the eastern direction, Bliss River,
[6123] At the peak of Vajra-Arising Mountain,
[6124] This sacred teaching descended,
[6125] Called "Sūtra Collection,"
[6126] The king himself holds the teaching.
[6127] That patron, the brahmin,
[6128] Called Jayākara,
[6129] Abides for one thousand four hundred years.
[6130] After that, the dark aeon
[6131] Becomes five thousand years.
[6132] Then the western direction, Affection Continent,
[6133] Called Bhatisali,
[6134] Also to the good family of beings,
[6135] Again the three essences descended,
[6136] Also by the monk Bliss-Protector,
[6137] This sacred teaching held,
[6138] That patron, the hero
