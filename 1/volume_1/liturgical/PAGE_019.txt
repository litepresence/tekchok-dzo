[635] [635] From the south-eastern direction of this world,
[636] [636] At the six transcendent realms,
[637] [637] The sound of Thal-ba resounds:
[638] [638] Protector and benefactor—completely surrounded by these,
[639] [639] Victory banners, parasols, and more are raised aloft,
[640] [640] Flowers, various rains, and fragrances descend,
[641] [641] To the Teacher himself and to his teaching,
[642] [642] The assembly of beautiful-makers and reflections surrounds them,
[643] [643] The play of bliss arises.
[644] [644] From the south-western direction of this world,
[645] [645] From below the six transcendent realms, the wind of Thal-ba,
[646] [646] Moving and stirring within intermediate space,
[647] [647] Mutually moving, hovering,
[648] [648] From movement arise all sounds.
[649] [649] The Teacher's teaching is moved by wind,
[650] [650] The three gateways of the five-possessing one.
[651] [651] Upon that summit, thirteen are stacked—
[652] [652] The Jewel Thal-ba, so it is called,
[653] [653] Adorned with auspicious solar rays,
[654] [654] Adorned with the qualities of desire.
[655] [655] Miraculous letters, beautiful script,
[656] [656] The Teacher's teaching—reflection complete.
[657] [657] Beautiful through the lotus eyes of lda-ldi,
[658] [658] From this, the western-northern threshold's summit.
[659] [659] The sixth world-khams,
[660] [660] The Taming Thal-ba, so it is called.
[661] [661] With goddess included in complete offering,
[662] [662] Filled with light and the fragrance of sandalwood,
[663] [663] The Teacher's teaching—equal in every portion.
[664] [664] Beautiful form possessing sixteen years,
[665] [665] Surrounded by those extremely young.
[666] [666] Below that, in the ninth world,
[667] [667] The deity called Dung-ldan Thal-ba,
[668] [668] Intoxicated by the fragrance of faith and protection,
[669] [669] Turbulent, with light blazing extremely,
[670] [670] Agitated, glowing intensely.
[671] [671] The Teacher himself and his teaching,
[672] [672] And his retinue—enjoyment complete.
[673] [673] From this, the sixth world,
[674] [674] The Star Thal-ba, so it is called.
[675] [675] The nature of the stacked wheel,
[676] [676] Stacked completely by five and nine.
[677] [677] Adorned with the water-spouts of dawn,
[678] [678] Thunder, lightning, and red tongues emit.
[679] [679] The Teacher's teaching is surrounded by scripture,
[680] [680] Light-arising garland—lineage of naga.
[681] [681] Illuminating all directions and thresholds.
[682] [682] Thus.
[683] [683] And in all those upper and lower thresholds of the twenty-five stacked lotus-abiding ones, countless fields pervade all upper and lower directions and thresholds.
