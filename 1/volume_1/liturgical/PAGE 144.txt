"Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."

Stacked letter five—annotation.

Thus it is called: NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KAYA SIDDHI BHĀRA.

Within these established sounds: DHARMA KAYA, SIDDHI, BHĀRA exist.

Their meaning:
The pure body is shown by actual sound;
the impure body is shown through establishment.

Therein, the pure wisdom-body:
This appearance, ceasing, immediately arises.

The impure sentient beings' body is this very appearance as concreteness.

The wisdom-body: rigpa at the heart, empty-cognizing, meaning-wisdom.

Dharmatā: permanent, unchanging—reversed from confusion.
Rigpa's wisdom reversed from the world.
Rigpa's compassion, unceasing, benefits beings.

Further, the stacked classes are shown:

"Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."

Stacked letter six—annotation.

Thus it is: E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA; AD MA KO TSAG KRA BA LO KI.

Its meaning enters light:
rigpa's light, kāya's light, wisdom's light—these three gathered into dharmadhātu.

This too: from dharmatā's equality, not gone beyond.

For the non-dual meaning, wisdom's self-nature:
Emptiness stacked—emptiness of sambhogakāya's equality, meaning of complete enjoyment body.

Kāya beyond words,
pervaded by clear light,
whatever portion depends—nothing remains.

The path has three:
1. The empty wisdom-path,
2. The clear light-path,
3. The unchanging rigpa's empty path.

First: the lamp of the bodhi path.
Second: wisdom's illusory body.
Third: the precious body.

These three too, in dharmadhātu's nature, are one taste:
Dharmatā's great equality's expanse, supreme, unchanging, not gone beyond.

Further stacked classes:
"Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
