[5535] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter five, annotation.

[5536] Thus it is: NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KAYA SI TI SAṂ BHĀRAḤ.

[5537] Within these sounds are established: DHARMA KAYA, SIDDHI, BHĀRA.

[5538] Their meaning: the pure body is shown by actual sound; the impure body is shown through establishment.

[5539] Therein, the pure wisdom-body—this appearance, ceasing, immediately arises.

[5540] The impure, sentient beings' body, is this very appearance as concreteness.

[5557] These three too, in dharmadhātu's nature, are one taste—dharmatā's great equality's expanse, supreme, unchanging, not gone beyond.

[5558] Further stacked classes:
