[7712] Having entered the symbol-powder maṇḍala,
[7713] The meaning-samādhi maṇḍala—meditating peaceful-wrathful deities with elaboration and reciting mantras,
[7714] And without elaboration, the completion stage—viewing the direct meaning of reality, the light maṇḍala,
[7715] The four appearances arrive at their extent,
[7716] When the maṇḍala of the youth vase body becomes manifest,
[7717] The maṇḍala of dharmakāya and the completed maṇḍala of self-appearing saṃbhogakāya—the nature of the two peaceful and wrathful spontaneously become.
[7718] From that:
[7719] "The great nature maṇḍala,
[7720] In Akaniṣṭha, the palace of dharmadhātu,

[7727] Surrounded by the entourage of mind-heroes of the four families,
[7728] Two great nature maṇḍalas.

[7730] Is the maṇḍala of Ratnasaṃbhava,
[7731] Surrounded by the entourage of the jewel family,
[7732] Three great nature maṇḍalas.

[7739] Surrounded by the entourage of the action family,
[7740] Five great nature maṇḍalas.
[7741] Abiding in the manner of ungenerated completion,
[7742] That also, the manner of residing is like this:
[7743] Possessing body of peaceful form,
[7744] Standing and sitting,
[7745] Father and mother appearing,
[7746] Mudrā and samādhi.
[7747] Gatekeepers with meditative entourage,
[7748] The six munis and so forth,
[7749] Countless entourage.
[7750] That also, various hand-emblems,
[7751] Transform mudrā and dance and so forth,
[7752] By various sounds and music,
[7753] Making offering to the chief father.
[7754] The great nature maṇḍala,
[7755] All deities and deity-mothers also,
[7756] Possessing swaying gait.
[7757] All also possessing five-by-five light-rays,
[7758] Arising from self, playing in self.
[7759] That also, five-by-five head-ornaments,
[7760] Shoulder-ornaments and throat-water,
[7761] Hand-rings and foot-rings,
[7762] Breast-ornaments and se-mo-do.
[7763] Thus various forms of ornaments,
[7764] Body possessing major and minor marks,
[7765] Holding unmixed, individual characteristics.
[7766] Center dark-blue, east white,
[7767] South yellow, west red,
[7768] North green, complete.
[7769] Thus the color of the family,
[7770] That is the nature maṇḍala.
[7771] At each head-ornament of the peaceful,
[7772] Complete five-by-five wrathful clusters.
[7773] That also, the manner of completion is like this:
[7774] At Vairocana's head-ornament,
[7775] Consider Buddha-heruka as chief.
[7776] Eastward, Vajra-heruka.
