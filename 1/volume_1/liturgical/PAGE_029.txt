[1041] The sons and daughters of the gods fill every space with song and the resounding music of cymbals.
[1042] The common realm, delightful to behold:
[1043] Outside that, within cyclic existence, various jewel-mansion arrangements beautifully diverse, each appearance measuring four thousand five hundred leagues, exceeding three and one-half in height.
[1044] Inside, the ground and streets appear beautiful, pleasing to the mind, together with flower-rain falling in the four seasons.
[1045] Outside the city, surrounded between seven jewel walls, completely filled with falling waters.
[1046] Lotus and other flower-groups expand, while birds' voices sweetly proclaim,
[1047] Existing together with flying jewel-boats.
[1048] The interval cities: at the four intervals of Meru's peak exist four gods' cities adorned with five hundred mansions, between them connected by a five-league plain wall,
[1049] Where the yakṣa hand-vajra four-siblings' god race dwell.
[1050] The gardens: delightful to behold, existing in the four directions measured twenty by twenty leagues.
[1051] In the east: the Chariot-Various Park, decorated by ponds, cloth, chariots and so forth.
[1052] In the south: the Rough-Transformation Park, where various hard armors arise when waging battle.
[1053] In the west: the Enjoyment-Mixing Park, immeasurable enjoyment for nearby enjoyment.
[1054] In the north: the Everywhere-Joy Park, free from all sorrow, beautiful with many brilliant joys.
[1055] Those also, two hundred fifty leagues in width, well-shaped, delightful to behold.
[1056] Inside those, all the ground spreads with golden sand,
[1057] Decorated by lakes, ponds and so forth in the intervals, filled with various jewel flower-beds.
[1058] Outside those gardens, the ground also shares their names, decorated by many flowers and ponds.
