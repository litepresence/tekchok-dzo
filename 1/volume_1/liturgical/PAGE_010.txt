[299] Mudrā's subjugation,
[300] Great-blaze's equality,
[301] Diversity of dharmatā,
[302] Samadhi called "self-appearing spontaneous adornment."
[303] Those also not the activity of meaning's agent,
[304] But called "activity" through the arising of qualities' essence and radiance.
[305] From that, enjoyment-complete body's self-arising:
[306] From the play of unobstructed radiance of former appearances and compassion's arising manner,
[307] The pure abodes are densely arranged.
[308] From the equal-expanse gesture of the great ocean's teacher of complete manifestation—at the lotus-pericarp's base from the thumb, upon the tiny protuberances, upon the layered arrangement of thirty-two realms, the appearances abiding as layered masses, with varied colors and forms like water and moon—
[309] All layered masses as well, infinite and vast like palace arrangements.
[310] In arrangements like descending offering-feast houses.
[311] The bodies of five-family Buddhas as well, all-enumerable in variety.
[312] In the perfume-water stream below the lotus-throne, infinite.
[313] The sixteen sixteen realms as well, not as layered masses.
[314] Like infinite jewel-umbrella arrangements.
[315] In arrangements like mutual grain-pile masses, also enumerable including five-family Buddhas.
[316] Furthermore, from all pores of hair-light, radiating into space—also infinite enumerable variety of realms and teachers, boundless, measureless, infinite.
[317] Thus in enjoyment-body's realm:
[318] Teaching actual, speech self-arisen syllables whoever not made, yet all teaching's sons and simultaneous appearances those abide—
[319] At the time of unchanging dharmatā.
[320] From the thirty-six self-arisen activities of the enjoyment-body's body, speech, mind inexhaustible ornament-wheel:
[321] The body's four outer activities:
[322] Through body appearing without self-nature, obscurations are purified.
