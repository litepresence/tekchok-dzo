[7364] [7364] Obtain qualities of glory and goodness,
[7365] [7365] After that, manifestly perfect awakening in the ornament-arranged field.
[7366] [7366] Thus also, from the Empowerment Infinite:
[7367] [7367] "Completing the meanings of desire,
[7368] [7368] Glory, fame, and wisdom,
[7369] [7369] Giving excellent power,
[7370] [7370] In the well-arranged Buddha-field,
[7371] [7371] Manifestly perfect awakening."
[7372] [7372] Thus it is spoken.
[7373] [7373] That also, rather than gathering numberless accumulations at another time,
[7374] [7374] At this time, the gathered increases by a hundred-thousand-fold.
[7375] [7375] By that power, all meanings of mind are accomplished here,
[7376] [7376] And without difficulty arises the definite accomplishment of special gatherings of food, wealth, etc.
[7377] [7377] From completing the two accumulations, the two kāyas are accomplished.
[7378] [7378] From the Empowerment Jewel Arrangement:
[7379] [7379] "The fortunate one who relied on empowerment,
[7380] [7380] Result of completed two accumulations,
[7381] [7381] Definitely obtains the meaning of the two supreme."
[7382] [7382] Thus it is spoken.
[7383] [7383] At this time, having offered to the root guru food, drink, wealth, etc., each one,
[7384] [7384] And having offered hundreds at another time, the merit of offering here is great.
[7385] [7385] The merit of giving to one woman at this time,
[7386] [7386] And giving to one man,
[7387] [7387] And elsewhere, the merit of having done great feast offerings to a hundred ḍākinīs—
[7388] [7388] Giving these two at this time to one is superior.
[7389] [7388] That also, at this time, all Buddhas of the ten directions gathered compassion into one,
[7390] [7389] Doing the action of empowerment, turning the unsurpassed wheel,
[7391] [7390] Entering self into the town of great liberation—by superior kindness;
[7392] [7391] Also to women and men,
[7393] [7392] Heroes and heroines with support, abiding in the row of empowerment through compassion and samaya, giving blessing—
[7394] [7393] The two times of empowerment and celebration increase by a hundred-thousand-fold compared to others.  [7394] Thus also:
