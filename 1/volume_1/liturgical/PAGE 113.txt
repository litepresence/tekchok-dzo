[4172] The tantra of indicating words, two:

[4173] The tantra of meaning:

[4174] Mind itself, naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought,

[4175] Always abiding in all, thus tantra,

[4176] Being the lineage of buddha, thus from tantra,

[4177] Holding the characteristic of buddha, thus placed in tantra.

[4178] The tantra of words:

[4179] That same indicating basis—name, word, letter's nature, chapter, etc.—divided,

[4180] The chief method of the creation sequence,

[4181] The chief discerning of the completion sequence,

[4182] Both equal parts: the non-dual union,

[4183] Showing beyond all: the key points of Great Perfection.

[4184] The rising measure: chief of the great creation sequence, ten:

[4185] First: basis empowerment and samaya—two,

[4186] Deity and mantra—two,

[4187] Maṇḍala and offering—two,

[4188] Samādhi and conduct—two,

[4189] Activity and view—two. Ten complete: the chief tantra of the creation sequence.

[4190] The rising measure of the completion sequence:

[4191] View and fruition—two,

[4192] Conduct and meditation—two,

[4193] Mind and wisdom—two,

[4194] Experience and instruction—two. Eight complete: the chief rising measure of the completion sequence.

[4195] The non-dual union:

[4196] Both must complete—eighteen.

[4197] The completely perfect Great:

[4198] From creation and completion, the completion sequence.

[4199] The completion sequence: showing the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu with small elaboration,

[4200] Showing the sequence of great clear light wisdom—two.

[4201] Great—that entering the rising measure through the door of empowerment and samaya—two,

[4202] Path and enumeration—two,

[4203] Fruition and five complete.

[4204] Examples: like the warp,

[4205] Depending on many threads of cause, rolling like cloth,

[4206] Depending on different words, extracting one meaning.

[4207] Valid: tantra dwelling in self, indicating, thus

[4208] Valid as tantra.

[4209] That also, depending on the key of words, bringing meaning's basis to certainty without error, making it realized, thus placed in tantra.

[4210] Second, extensively explaining that nature: two.
