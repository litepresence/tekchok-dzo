[4040] Not depending on words, completely depending on discerning wisdom.

[4041] Self-nature:

[4042] Directly seeing, not dwelling in the intellect-grasping view.

[4043] Characteristic: the measure of four appearances arrived at, the result of three bodies and five wisdoms not aimed at.

[4044] From that, this is the unsurpassed secret:

[4045] Below, through dharmatā's intellect-confidence reaching,

[4046] Here, through the guru's power, existing as the direct object of the senses—specially superior.

[4047] Thus shown, all cycles gathered into one sūtra, the definite sequence of division and summary:

[4048] These Great Perfections: nine in the expanse,

[4049] Twenty-one thousand volumes,

[4050] Three sections,

[4051] Thirty-five thousand chapters,

[4052] Eight great sections,

[4053] One hundred eighty sharp nails,

[4054] Fifteen hundred summaries,

[4055] Seven bundles of distinctions,

[4056] One and a half hundred-thousand enumerations,

[4057] Five thousand essential points,

[4058] Sixty-four hundred-thousand ślokas,

[4059] Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras dwelling as essences.

[4060] From the definitive conclusion,

[4061] From the nature of Great Perfection,

[4062] Word-distinctions emanate.

[4063] From the three sections, nine expanses become,

[4064] From the word summary, ślokas,

[4065] From fourteen hundred-thousand,

[4066] Thirty-five thousand chapters,

[4067] Twenty-one thousand volumes,

[4068] The spoken object equal to the sky's end,

[4069] Cutting the thoughts of disciples and beings,

[4070] From this, the spoken object abbreviated,

[4071] To one hundred eighty sharp nails,

[4072] Summaries one and a half thousand,

[4073] Three thousand great gathered essential points,

[4074] To forty thousand deviation-obstacles,

[4075] Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras,

[4076] The sequence of word-speaking clearly established.

[4077] Thus it is.

[4078] These too, when summarized:

[4079] Mind Section,

[4080] Expanse Section,

[4081] Instruction Section—gathered as three.

[4082] There: all of Mind Section—the inexpressible expanse of dharmatā,

[4083] The expanse of view's non-negation,

[4084] The expanse of conduct's non-affirmation—gathered as three.

[4085] That also gathered in five thousand name-affixed tantras.
