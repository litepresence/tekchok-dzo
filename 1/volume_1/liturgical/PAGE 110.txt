[4040] Not depending on words, completely depending on discerning wisdom.

[4041] Nature:

[4042] Directly seeing, not dwelling in intellect-grasping view.

[4043] Characteristic: four appearances' measure arrived at, result three kāyas five wisdoms not aimed at.

[4044] From that, this unsurpassed secret:

[4045] Below, through dharmatā intellect-confidence aiming,

[4046] Here, directly through guru's power existing as faculty's object to see, specially superior.

[4047] Thus shown, all cycles gathered into one sūtra, definite sequence of division and summary:

[4048] These Great Perfections: nine in the expanse,

[4049] Twenty-one thousand chapters,

[4050] Three sections,

[4051] Thirty-five thousand chapters,

[4052] Eight great sections,

[4053] One hundred eighty sharp nails,

[4054] Fifteen hundred summaries,

[4055] Seven bundles of distinctions,

[4056] One and a half hundred-thousand enumerations,

[4057] Five thousand key points,

[4058] Sixty-four hundred-thousand ślokas,

[4059] Twenty thousand name-taken tantras dwelling as essences.

[4060] From definitive conclusion:

[4061] From Great Perfection nature,

[4062] Word distinctions emanate.

[4063] From three sections, nine expanses become,

[4064] From word summary, śloka

[4065] From fourteen hundred-thousand,

[4066] Thirty-five thousand chapters,

[4067] Twenty-one thousand chapters,

[4068] Spoken object equal to sky's end,

[4069] Disciples' beings' thoughts cut,

[4070] From this spoken object abbreviated,

[4071] To one hundred eighty sharp nails,

[4072] Summaries one and a half thousand,

[4073] Three thousand great gathered key points,

[4074] To forty thousand deviation obstacles,

[4075] Twenty thousand name-taken tantras,

[4076] Word-speaking sequence clearly established.

[4077] Thus it is.

[4078] These too, summarized:

[4079] Mind Section,

[4080] Space Section,

[4081] Instruction Section, three gathered.

[4082] There, all Mind Section: dharmatā inexpressible expanse and

[4083] View's non-negated expanse and

[4084] Conduct's non-affirmed expanse, gathered as three.

[4085] That too, gathered in five thousand name-taken tantras.
