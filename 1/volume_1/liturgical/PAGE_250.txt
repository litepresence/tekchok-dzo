[10209] [10209] If body samaya is transgressed,
[10210] [10210] One is separated from the word called Buddha-body.
[10211] [10211] Thus, all beings of the three realms—
[10212] [10212] Compared to cutting life at one time,
[10213] [10213] By defeat, sin is limitless.
[10214] [10214] Similarly, if speech ceases,
[10215] [10215] Buddha-speech's word does not dwell.
[10216] [10216] Of all beings of the three realms,
[10217] [10217] The tongue faculty at one time
[10218] [10218] Cut—by this sin is limitless.
[10219] [10219] If mind degenerates,
[10220] [10220] Filling the three realms with meditators,
[10221] [10221] Virtuous monks dwelling in virtue,
[10222] [10222] At one time disturbing mind, expelling mind—
[10223] [10223] By this, sin increases more.
[10224] [10224] Thus.
[10225] [10225] Especially, degenerate fall from relying on the guru is heavy.
[10226] [10226] From the Glorious Sky-Not-Exhausted Tantra:
[10227] [10227] If without bad mind,
[10228] [10228] By degenerate mindfulness in dream,
[10229] [10229] Or non-virtues becoming careless,
[10230] [10230] Confess aimed at the guru.
[10231] [10231] Bodily fault by body,
[10232] [10232] Thus speech and mind also.
[10233] [10233] If not confessed immediately,
[10234] [10234] By this too, experience uninterrupted suffering.
[10235] [10235] Thus.
[10236] [10236] The guru is the nature of all Buddhas,
[10237] [10237] Teaching to liberate from samsara by supreme Dharma at this time, therefore the object is fierce.
[10238] [10238] Accomplish as spoken,
[10239] [10239] Abandoning non-faith,
[10240] [10240] Wrong mind,
[10241] [10241] Harm,
[10242] [10242] And speaking, etc.
[10243] [10243] From the mouth of the great master Joy Vajra:
[10244] [10244] The supreme guru commanded:
[10245] [10245] If knowing the flaw of faults,
[10246] [10246] Do as spoken.
[10247] [10247] Thus, toward the guru's activity,
[10248] [10248] Even if body's suffering becomes supreme,
[10249] [10249] By one's own ability, make effort to do.
[10250] [10250] The guru's mind, even for a moment,
[10251] [10251] Must not be disturbed.
[10252] [10252] Toward the guru's food and wealth,
[10253] [10253] As one cherishes one's own life,
[10254] [10254] The yogi must always act.
[10255] [10255] If in the guru's realm,
[10256] [10256] Teaching Dharma, empowerment, consecration,
[10257] [10257] And all meditations to be done,
[10258] [10258] Must not be done without subsequent permission.
[10259] [10259] Briefly, by body, speech, and mind,
[10260] [10260] Whatever deed's aspect is done,
[10261] [10261] Without asking the guru, without permission,
[10262] [10262] Even a little must not be done.
[10263] [10263] Furthermore, whatever virtuous karma,
[10264] [10264] Begin by asking the guru.
[10265] [10265] In all yogic conduct,
[10266] [10266] Must not separate from the supreme guru.
[10267] [10267] Whenever eating food of the three times,
[10268] [10268] With first portions cut in three parts,
[10269] [10269] Must offer to the supreme guru.
[10270] [10270] By wealth and rare jewels,
[10271] [10271] To the guru, vajra holder,
[10272] [10272] Without desire, offer portions.
[10273] [10273] With first portions of whatever and whatever,
[10274] [10274] Dedicate and offer to the supreme guru.
[10275] [10275] Briefly, all of one's mind,
[10276] [10276] Pure aspect, without pretense,
[10277] [10277] Aim toward the guru's portion.
[10278] [10278] All good qualities will be accomplished.
[10279] [10279] Thus.
[10280] [10280] Purpose is from Consequence:
