00001| [192] From the Meeting of Father and Son:
00002| [193] "Great hero, skillful in means,
00003| [194] For the complete ripening of sentient beings,
00004| [195] Though you became Buddha ten million times,
00005| [196] Still you guide, O Teacher,
00006| [197] Demonstrating many Buddhas,"
00007| [198] Thus proclaimed;
00008| [199] From the Flower Ornament:
00009| [200] "Having attained the ocean of enlightenment supreme,
00010| [201] For the complete ripening of beings' ocean vast,
00011| [202] Demonstrating the ocean of bodhicitta generation,
00012| [203] Showing the ocean of conduct undiminished through all time,
00013| [204] Such is the emanation of the Sugatas,"
00014| [205] Thus spoke the Lord.
00015| [206] Therefore the first Protector, intending to tame this realm, displayed emanations demonstrating the manner of mind-generation—
00016| [207] Regarding this Fortunate Eon, before immeasurable eons past,
00017| [208] In the field called "Self-Nature Completely Arranged,"
00018| [209] To Buddha Flower-Beauty-Great offered a golden vajra, generating supreme bodhicitta as first mind.
00019| [210] Then in the second birth, in the north, "Wind-Movement Arranged," becoming householder Good-Give's son Jewel-Garland,
00020| [211] Dwelt near Buddha Wheel-Well-Conduct, hearing Dharma.
00021| [212] Then passing beyond, born as "Lightning-Light" in Bliss-Intoxicated Island, the brahmin youth Good-Give.
00022| [213] At that time heard Dharma from Buddha Good-Intelligence for five years, and for seven years abiding in single-pointed samadhi,
00023| [214] At seventy-five years demonstrated manifest complete Buddhahood upon Jewel-Precious-Heap-Arranged Mountain peak,
00024| [215] Abiding in dharmakaya's meaning for one great eon,
00025| [216] Then self-arose as Victor's sambhogakaya in ornament and color wheel.
00026| [217] From light-ray's spreading-gathering arose thirty-six tantras self-arisen,
