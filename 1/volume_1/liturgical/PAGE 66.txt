[2316] Those who wish to abide upon the path, regarding conduct as permanent, yet seeing cause and result as impermanent—such practitioners, by taking conduct as permanent, seek liberation. They view objects, homes, and houses as permanent, and all appearances as eternal.

[2321] Those who view permanence where it does not exist are nihilists. Thus they enact the tenet of permanence upon this very ground.

[2324] Those who wield evil mantras as chief, performing fierce destructive rites, speaking single-pointedly as black practitioners, attached to such, desiring results. Those who take divination and prophecy as chief, caring only for this world's happiness, declaring future lives nonexistent. Those who take subtle miracles as chief, in this world turning back armies through magical power, in future lives too, through magic defeating others, wishing rebirth in the retinue of lords or powerful ones. Those whose view prioritizes debate, internalizing their own truth while refuting others, harboring such hopes. Those who harbor hopes in mistaken ascetic practices. Those attached to this world, called "worldly benefit," engaging in this world's affairs.

[2335] Also, some internalize their own truth, pridefully killing others' standing. Some seek meaning through custom. Some, having made matted hair, seek meaning. Some, wrapping their bodies alternately in single cloths, declare "inner heat has arisen." Some, holding khatvanga and damaru as hand-attributes, declare "I am the emanation body." Some say "Whatever virtue you do benefits me," depending upon that meaning. Some, by their own reasoning refuting others' reasoning, declare "This is my action," depending upon that meaning. Some declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut. Some declare that sudden cut renders even their own bodies empty. Cause severed, effect severed.
