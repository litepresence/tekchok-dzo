[2831] [2831] Here follows the general path briefly stated.
[2832] [2832] The explanation of the various established tenet positions divides into two parts.
[2833] [2833] First: through the methodological tradition of the Vehicle of Characteristics, the path for sharp faculties and powerful mind-power arises. This should be understood as the self-nature of the two truths of the basis.
[2834] [2834] Knowing this, how then to practice.
[2835] [2835] The presentation of the fruit of the complete path, with three divisions:
[2836] [2836] First:
[2837] [2837] All phenomena gathered by samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.
[2838] [2838] As the Root Wisdom states:
[2839] [2839] "The Buddhas taught the Dharma,
[2840] [2840] Relying correctly upon the two truths:
[2841] [2841] The conventional truth of the world,
[2842] [2842] And the ultimate truth of meaning."
[2843] [2843] Thus it is said.
[2844] [2844] From the Illusion Net:
[2845] [2845] "One abides in the manner of the two truths."
[2846] [2846] Thus.
[2847] [2847] As for this: phenomena marked by characteristics that appear as objects of intellect are the conventional truth.
[2848] [2848] Divided into the false and the true conventional—these two.
[2849] [2849] First: all phenomena including the container and contained of appearance and existence arranged by intellect are the false conventional.
[2850] [2850] Because appearance manifests as the essence of object-delusion appearing as intellect's falseness.
[2851] [2851] Those also imputed appearances arise as appearances accordant with the function of deluded intellect.
[2852] [2852] They possess the power to function.
[2853] [2853] When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence—
[2854] [2854] In the manner of the eight examples of illusion:
[2855] [2855] Arising as non-existent yet clear-appearing,
[2856] [2856] As before:
[2857] [2857] Like a dream, like an illusion,
[2858] [2858] Like a gandharva city,
[2859] [2859] Thus arise, thus abide,
[2860] [2860] Thus also cease.
[2861] [2861] Thus.
[2862] [2862] The true conventional:
[2863] [2863] Though appearing deluded, it serves as the cause of blissful migration and liberation.
[2864] [2864] The white actions of the ten virtues,
[2865] [2865] The collections of merit such as generosity,
[2866] [2866] Gathered through the path of truth by means of the mind's samadhi of wisdom, the four aspects of seeing and meditating, serving as the field of experience for intellect.
