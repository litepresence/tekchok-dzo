[3278] The inner five actions and afflictions are completely purified.
[3279] The five secret objects and faculties are completely purified.
[3280] The five families become Buddhas as one's own self.
[3281] Meditating on commitment deity and self as brothers and friends.
[3282] Knowing no good cause for deity.
[3283] Accomplishment arises from oneself.
[3284] Realizing no bad cause for self, now as clear deity form in the illusion body—surpassing the lower.
[3285] Also this: Realizing the generation deity and self as non-dual.
[3286] Neither ultimate nor conventional name exists.
[3287] These also:
[3288] From self-arisen awareness.
[3289] The established view of yoga is thus.
[3290] The doors of entry are the five manifest enlightenments.
[3291] The view of realization as deity and friend.
[3292] Keeping the three samayas of protection without shame.
[3293] Pure conduct neither refutes nor establishes.
[3294] The five enlightenments are thus.
[3295] Enlightenment through the door of seat.
[3296] Enlightenment through the door of form.
[3297] Enlightenment through the door of emblem.
[3298] Enlightenment through the door of generation.
[3299] Enlightenment through the door of syllables and letters.
[3300] Thus the five enlightenments are practiced.
[3301] The three shameless ones—what are they?
[3302] Shamelessness through commitment deity.
[3303] Shamelessness through master, disciples, and friends.
[3304] Shamelessness through one's own mind.
[3305] Deity and yogi are also oneself.
[3306] Desiring the manner of brother and friend.
[3307] Meditating on deity and mandala as non-dual with self.
[3308] Deity also arises from self and dissolves into self.
[3309] Desiring the radiation and gathering of self and deity.
[3310] Thus.
[3311] The seventh: The presentation of the mahāyoga tantra vehicle—surpassing the lower.
[3312] The explanation of the supreme vehicle itself, divided into two.
[3313] First:
[3314] Relying on the outer three and the five whites, etc.
[3315] Conducting bath, purity, fasting, and dwelling, tormenting.
[3316] Conducting the inner five meats and five nectars, etc.
