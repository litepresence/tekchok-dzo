Yānāgratnakōśanāmavajrāhāra.

Thus abides the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle, the Jewel Treasure.

In the language of India:
Yānāgratnakōśanāma

In the language of Tibet:
Treasury of Supreme Vehicle

To Glorious Samantabhadra I prostrate.

Samantabhadra, whose innate nature holds the five perfections, complete in dominion,
Together with the regent of the five families, the Great Ocean, the sublime guide, the Teacher,
The five vidyādharas, hosts of the aural lineage, ornament of the three worlds together with the gods,
To that crown of all joy, the glorious source of excellence and auspiciousness, I offer homage.

That which from the primordial is pure, where all elaborations cease into space, beautifully arrayed,
Nature ever-abiding, clear light, seven horses, pervading all three bodies and qualities,
Not dwelling in existence or peace, spontaneously entered, uncompounded and spontaneously accomplished—
To that Vajra-point, supreme possessor of all, the Sugata-essence, I prostrate.

From the Dharma-sun, stainless, vast, immeasurable, ornament of space,
The unsurpassed secret vajra vehicle, supreme among all, glorious as the wish-fulfilling jewel,
Among these, the most supreme, the holy nature, the pinnacle of the Great Perfection,
Revealing the essence of suchness directly—by that, this day, protect the lotus-throne of my mind.

The place of the teaching-ocean, the throne of the makara-holder,
The sphere of the Vajra-essence, supreme among all,
Clearly revealing the profound and vast abodes—
The explanation of the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle I shall compose.

When the nectar of the Dharma-body is obtained,
And the Enjoyment-body complete,
And the Emanation-body manifests,
The ocean of Dharma-principles spoken by the Teacher,
And the place,
By the power of the teaching, arranged as three aspects through classification.

The basis of perfect place, dharmatā luminous-clarity,
In the precious field where appearance manifests spontaneously from the uncompounded display of qualities.
