[3764] From action's great expanse, the White Space of ineffable teaching,

[3765] From view-meditation union, the two White Spaces:

[3766] First:

[3767] Essence liberated through direct seeing,

[3768] Abiding self-purified.

[3769] When divided:

[3770] Ocean Space and

[3771] Sky Space—these two.

[3772] Ocean Space's essence, eternal extremes self-liberated,

[3773] Liberated through non-action, liberation through liberation,

[3774] Without the two extremes of multiplicity.

[3775] When divided, two:

[3776] Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space.

[3777] First:

[3778] Mind's self-abiding emptiness spontaneously liberated,

[3779] Mind-emptiness relied upon, thoroughly purified,

[3780] Self-purified dharmatā of appearance, from the beginning inexpressible,

[3781] Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness's transcendence, empty,

[3782] By emptiness, nowhere established—this is the intent.

[3783] Small Ocean Space:

[3784] Through reliance self-purified, mind without stain,

[3785] Through particulars abiding pure, conditions from the beginning inexpressible—this is the intent.

[3786] Sky Space's essence:

[3787] Dharmatā uncontrived, mind self-liberated.

[3788] When divided, two:

[3789] Sun-Moon Space and

[3790] Jewel White Space—these two.

[3791] First:

[3792] Essence utterly pure emptiness,

[3793] Self-nature unborn, spontaneously liberated.

[3794] Second:

[3795] Qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions self-purified,

[3796] Through non-action toward mind, dharmatā spontaneously accomplished—this is the intent regarding causes and conditions.

[3797] Infinite Space expanse's essence, appearing to mind, is known,

[3798] Not appearing, known by the mode of abiding.

[3799] When divided, three:

[3800] Outer Infinite Space free from action,

[3801] Inner Infinite Space of view's own position,

[3802] Secret Infinite Space of radiance clarification,

[3803] Infinite Space of that-which-is—these four.

[3804] First:

[3805] Through causelessness, no reversal—this is the key point,

[3806] Through conditionlessness, whatever appears unharmed—this is the key point,

[3807] Through absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa nowhere established—this is the key point.

[3808] Also, through uncontrivance toward mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcendent non-abiding.
