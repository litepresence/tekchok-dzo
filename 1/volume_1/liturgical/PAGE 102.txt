[3764] From action's vast expanse, the White Space of ineffable teaching,

[3765] From the union of view and meditation, the two White Spaces:

[3766] The first:

[3767] The essence is liberated through direct seeing of the nature.

[3768] The abiding is self-purified.

[3769] When divided:

[3770] Ocean Space and

[3771] Sky Space—these two.

[3772] The essence of Ocean Space, eternally self-liberated beyond extremes,

[3773] Liberated through non-action, it is liberation itself.

[3774] Without the two extremes of multiplicity.

[3775] These divide into two:

[3776] Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space.

[3777] The first:

[3778] Mind's self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated,

[3779] When relied upon, mind-emptiness is thoroughly purified,

[3780] The self-purified dharmatā of appearance-emptiness, from the beginning inexpressible,

[3781] Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness's transcendence, it is empty—

[3782] By emptiness, nowhere is anything established—this is the intent.

[3783] The Small Ocean Space:

[3784] Through self-purified reliance, the mind is without stain,

[3785] Through the particular abiding in purity, conditions are from the beginning inexpressible—this is the intent.

[3786] The essence of Sky Space:

[3787] Dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated.

[3788] When divided, these are two:

[3789] Sun-Moon Space and

[3790] Jewel White Space—these two.

[3791] The first:

[3792] The essence is utterly pure emptiness,

[3793] Self-nature unborn, primordially liberated.

[3794] The second:

[3795] Qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions self-purified,

[3796] Through non-action toward the mind, dharmatā is spontaneously accomplished—this is the intent regarding causes and conditions.

[3797] The essence of the Infinite Space expanse, when appearing to the mind, is known,

[3798] When not appearing, it is known by the mode of abiding.

[3799] When divided, there are three:

[3800] The Outer Infinite Space free from action,

[3801] The Inner Infinite Space of the view's own position,

[3802] The Secret Infinite Space of radiance and obstacle-removal,

[3803] The Infinite Space of that-which-is itself.

[3804] The first:

[3805] Through causelessness, no reversal—this is the key point,

[3806] Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed—this is the key point,

[3807] Through the absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nowhere established—this is the key point.

[3808] Also, through uncontrivance toward the mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcending non-samsāra.
