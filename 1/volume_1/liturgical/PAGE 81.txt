[2994] The holding consciousness also arises from mind.
[2995] As an egg is split, aspects and consciousnesses possessing objects appear in a single mind.
[2996] When holding objects now, outer aspect consciousness and inner-holding consciousness both arise.
[2997] Through beginningless latent tendencies, both appear thus.
[2998] Self-awareness alone, nothing else is established—like an egg is split.
[2999] If one says: "When outer aspect consciousness holds, at that time holding consciousness arises, two thoughts simultaneously"—it does not become.
[3000] It does not change.
[3001] That aspect consciousness is without thought—for this reason.
[3002] Third: When outer objects appear as various aspects,
[3003] A single inner-holding consciousness knows.
[3004] As when a monkey quickly enters a fortress,
[3005] Appearing in four apertures, entering and entering, looking and looking,
[3006] Entering through the five doors, a single consciousness knows the object.
[3007] At the moment of knowing, both aspect and consciousness are not different in the nature of a single mind.
[3008] Like a dream appearance and the self-appearing holder—both are undifferentiated in a single sleep consciousness.
[3009] Second: The false aspects.
[3010] The outer meaning aspect appearing mistakenly to consciousness is a false latent tendency.
[3011] Not true to consciousness.
[3012] The meeting consciousness also measures falsity.
[3013] Experience measures truth—no measurement exists.
[3014] Both object and consciousness are merely the nature of mistaken false appearance.
[3015] In this, there is division: the false with stain, the false intermediate, and that which is wished.
[3016] The stainless, the pure, and the intermediate—these two.
[3017] First: Now as various aspects appear,
[3018] Both meeting consciousnesses appear merely as the stain of intellect.
[3019] In ultimate truth, non-dual primordial wisdom exists with its qualities.
[3020] Nothing is established as consciousness.
[3021] The dharma-body of the Buddha has nothing remaining.
