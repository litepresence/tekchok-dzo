[2994] That holding consciousness also arises from mind;
[2995] Like a split egg, aspects and consciousness, object and object-possessor, arise in one mind.
[2996] Now when holding objects, outer aspect-consciousness and inner holding-consciousness arise,
[2997] Yet through beginningless latent tendencies appear as two—
[2998] Established from self-awareness alone, nothing else, like a split egg.
[2999] Then, on one outer aspect-consciousness, when one holding-consciousness arises, do two thoughts become simultaneous?
[3000] No.
[3001] For that aspect-consciousness is without thought—thus it is wished.
[3002] Third: though outer objects' aspects appear various,
[3003] Known by one inner holding-consciousness—
[3004] Like a monkey quickly entering a fortress,
[3005] Looking here and there through four apertures,
[3006] Consciousness enters through five doors and knows objects.
[3007] Even when knowing, both aspects and consciousness are of one mind's nature, not different.
[3008] Like dream appearances and self-appearing holder are not different in the single consciousness of sleep—thus it is wished.
[3009] Second, false aspects:
[3010] Latent tendencies appearing deluded in consciousness, aspects of outer meaning—false, not true as consciousness.
[3011] That meeting-consciousness also measured by false;
[3012] No measurement by true experience.
[3013] Object and consciousness both, only nature of mistaken-appear false, thus wished.
[3014] Regarding this, divisions: with-stain false intermediate, wished;
[3015] Stainless pure intermediate—of these two,
[3016] First: now aspects appearing various,
[3017] Both the meeting-consciousness only appear as intellect's stains,
[3018] Only primordial-wisdom of non-dual elements with qualities exists ultimately,
[3019] Nothing established as consciousness.
[3020] The Buddha's Dharma-body without remainder.
