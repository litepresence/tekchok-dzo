[6935] Ripening speech into the self-sound of ali and kali, and
[6936] There is the purpose of ripening mind free from emptiness meditation-face.
[6937] At that time, by making fierce aspiration, thinking "Whatever empowerment I desire, etc., I must obtain,"
[6938] Explaining Dharma in dreams,
[6939] Prophecy, etc.—signs of guru accomplishment definitely arise.
[6940] Third, the result of definite purpose:
[6941] Thus, having supplicated before and relied on the guru,
[6942] Whatever is desired all accomplished, arising like a wish-fulfilling jewel and wish-fulfilling tree.
[6943] From the Thalgyur:
[6944] "From relying on that, qualities—
[6945] Wish-fulfilling tree and wish-fulfilling jewel,
[6946] Like a cow of desires,
[6947] Obtain immeasurable qualities;
[6948] Aiming at that, rely on the guru,
[6949] To reverse from saṃsāra's battle."
[6950] Thus it is spoken.
[6951] Fourth, the activity of empowerment, how to confer, five:
[6952] Benefit of empowerment,
[6953] Defect of not being empowered,
[6954] Place where to empower,
[6955] Time when to empower,
[6956] Sequence of making celebration.
[6957] First:
[6958] From the Rangshar:
[6959] "Qualities, particularly these:
[6960] Great wisdom appearance,
[6961] Becoming without obstacles,
[6962] Self-appearance shown as helper,
[6963] Becoming doing all actions."
[6964] Thus it is spoken.
[6965] From the Empowerment Jewel Tantra:
[6966] "By abandoning guru's desire,
[6967] If empowerment ritual is completed,
[6968] By the sequence of how empowerment is conferred,
[6969] Even great Vajradhara,
[6970] Definitely becomes in this life."
[6971] Thus it is spoken.
[6972] From the Secret Essence:
[6973] "If empowered by five essences,
[6974] After this time, Buddha's son,
[6975] All lower realms not,
[6976] Becomes master of higher liberation."
[6977] Thus it is spoken.
[6978] Also from the Rangshar:
[6979] "Benefits of empowerment are like this:
[6980] In the intermediate state, self-appearance will be recognized;
[6981] Having recognized, also obtains stability in that itself,
[6982] Able to dissolve the emanation-kāya in twenty-one days.
[6983] Even one of excellent faculty completion, suffering, fear, etc., do not come.
[6984] At the time of practice also, wisdom appearance clearly does not cease.
[6985] That is called 'special quality.'
[6986] Common qualities are obtained like this:
[6987] Knowing the ḍākinī's voice, and
