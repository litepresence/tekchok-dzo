[9] In the language of Tibet:
[10] The Supreme Vehicle, the Jewel Treasury
[11] To Glorious Samantabhadra, I prostrate.
[12] Whose innate nature holds the five perfections, complete in power—Samantabhadra,
[13] Together with the regent of the five families, the Great Ocean, the holy guide, the Teacher,
[14] The five vidyadharas, hosts of the aural lineage, ornament of the three worlds together with the gods,
[15] The glorious source of auspiciousness and excellence—to that crown of all joy, I offer homage.
[16] That which from the primordial is pure, where all elaborations cease into space, beautifully arrayed,
[17] Nature ever-abiding, clear light, with seven horses, pervading all three kayas and qualities,
[18] Not dwelling in existence or peace, spontaneously entering all, uncompounded and spontaneously accomplished,
[19] To that vajra-point, supreme possessor of all, the Sugata-essence, I prostrate.
[20] From the Dharma-principle sun, stainless, vast, immeasurable, ornament of the sky,
[21] The unsurpassed, secret vajra vehicle, superior to all, glorious as the horse-jewel,
[22] Among these, the most supreme, the holy nature, the peak of the Great Perfection,
[23] Revealing the essence of suchness directly—by that, this day, protect the lotus-lake of my mind.
[24] The place of the teaching-ocean, the throne of the makara-holder,
[25] The sphere of the vajra-essence, supreme among all,
[26] Revealing clearly the profound and vast places—
[27] The explanation of the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle Jewel, I shall compose.
[28] When the nectar of the Dharma-body is obtained,
[29] And the Enjoyment-complete,
[30] And the Emanation-body becomes manifest,
[31] The ocean of Dharma-principles spoken also by the Teacher,
[32] And the place,
[33] By the power of the teaching, is arranged as three types through classification.
[34] The basis of light-clear Dharma-nature, the place of perfections,
[35] In the precious field where appearance manifests spontaneously from the uncompounded display of qualities.
