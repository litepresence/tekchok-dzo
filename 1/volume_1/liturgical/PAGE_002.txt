[36] [36] Teacher possessing perfections, complete power, the Victorious One, Samantabhadra, together with hosts of wisdom-ocean retinue,
[37] [37] Abides in the intention where body and wisdom are inseparable,
[38] [38] Teaching the nature of the Dharma-body beyond cause-effect and effort,
[39] [39] The time beyond action and effort in dharmatā,
[40] [40] Abiding in the primordial sphere of subtle inner clarity-wisdom.
[41] [41] From that nature, or from blessing, the self-appearing field of dense arrangement,
[42] [42] When adorned with outer lights of five, the individual teachers of the five families self-appear as the play of the mandala,
[43] [43] When teaching dharmatā, luminous-clarity, dzogchen, self-appearing spontaneously accomplished,
[44] [44] Abides in great self-arisen wisdom.
[45] [45] Self-appearing beyond even the objects of action of pure trainees.
[46] [46] From the strength and blessing of that nature, in Akanisṭha, the field of the Vajradhara of complete marks, dense arrangement, the sixth teacher Vajradhara arises in the form of the body of complete qualities,
[47] [47] With retinue of perfections dwelling upon the earth,
[48] [48] Awareness-holders,
[49] [49] Ḍākiṇīs,
[50] [50] Accomplished ones,
[51] [51] And hosts completely arranged as self-appearances—to inconceivable ones, teaching the ocean-like tantra sections of the result-vajra vehicle,
[52] [52] When perfect places appear individually to the self-appearances of beings,
[53] [53] The perfect teacher in emanation-body appears as holy guides to tame each according to their capacity,
[54] [54] When karma and aspiration are pure, teaching the perfections of sūtra sections,
[55] [55] Vinaya,
[56] [56] And abhidharma baskets appear as various vehicles.
[57] [57] To that, the three vehicles of causal characteristics are shown as cause and method for entering the result-vajra vehicle,
[58] [58] While the secret mantra vajra vehicle, the completely complete peak, the supreme result, is the unsurpassable vehicle of dzogchen.
