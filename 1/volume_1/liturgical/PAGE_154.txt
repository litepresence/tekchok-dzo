[5982] [5982] From the Training Tantra:
[5983] [5983] Buddha before all Buddhas,
[5984] [5984] Destroyer of all ignorance's stains.
[5985] [5985] Vajra, Vajra-holder, king,
[5986] [5986] Vajra, Vajra, Vajra-holder,
[5987] [5987] Vajrapāṇi, Mahāmudrā.
[5988] [5988] Thus it is spoken.
[5989] [5989] "Thus at one time I heard" means: Vajrapāṇi, at the time when I actually heard before from teacher Samantabhadra, great Vajradhara—
[5990] [5990] Thinking that the compiler's Dharma was awakened into by former victors having accepted it into heart,
[5991] [5991] And the lineage unbroken in the middle,
[5992] [5992] And the meaning of the three times' Dharma enumerations harmonious,
[5993] [5993] Is shown in order to generate faith in the retinue.
[5994] [5994] From the Thalgyur:
[5995] [5995] In order to accord with the door of other vehicles,
[5996] [5996] By means of the common prologue,
[5997] [5997] To the compiler's own retinue,
[5998] [5998] In order to make faith,
[5999] [5999] It is shown—from the disciple as the basis,
[6000] [6000] By making taming,
[6001] [6001] Arisen, makes the teaching abide.
[6002] [6002] Thus it is spoken.
[6003] [6003] Third: abandoning refutations of wrong understanding:
[6004] [6004] Some, having no opportunity to view the form of the vast ocean of Dharma with the closed eye of intellect, say:
[6005] [6005] "In other sūtras and tantras, 'Thus have I heard' is spoken,
[6006] [6006] 'Taught' does not arise here, so it is fabricated."
[6007] [6007] If "taught" becomes fabricated,
[6008] [6008] From the Cakrasamvara Root Tantra:
[6009] [6009] "Then the secret must be taught,"
[6010] [6010] Thus it is spoken;
[6011] [6011] That also has the fault of falling into fabrication.
[6012] [6012] Moreover, if saying that showing twice is not valid,
[6013] [6013] It follows that the entirety of the melodious-expressed section is not valid;
[6014] [6014] For the purpose of showing, after one prose, one verse is repeated,
[6015] [6015] And showing the name twice also follows as not valid.
[6016] [6016] Therefore, showing the arising of the meaning-tantra is the uncommon prologue;
[6017] [6017] Showing the arising of the word-tantra, indicating, is the common prologue—
[6018] [6018] Upon the non-contradictory, again very connected, it is shown.
[6019] [6019] By these, the definitive meaning of the prologue is shown.
