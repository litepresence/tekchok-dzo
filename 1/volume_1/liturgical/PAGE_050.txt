[1623] [1623] The formless element arising from excessive mindfulness, and
[1624] [1624] The desire element arising from limited mindfulness. Thus it is taught.
[1625] [1625] Second: That which arises naturally from the luminosity of the inner mind:
[1626] [1626] Awareness exists, and through its self-arisen potency comes obscuration—the ignorance of the all-ground.
[1627] [1627] From that, arising from the all-ground consciousness, comes mind.
[1628] [1628] From that, the five gates of mind and faculties arise as knowing.
[1629] [1629] Like a wish-fulfilling tree grown from a golden ground, with branches, flowers, and leaves appearing.
[1630] [1630] Dividing this:
[1631] [1631] Objects,
[1632] [1632] Faculties of cognition,
[1633] [1633] Feelings—these three.
[1634] [1634] Objects are designated as the six bases of faculties when the mere knowing of the six consciousnesses, arising in this moment, is designated as object. Thus the six bases of faculties are named.
[1635] [1635] The faculties of cognition:
[1636] [1636] The six present knowings of eye and so forth.
[1637] [1637] Feelings:
[1638] [1638] The six types of future aspects.
[1639] [1639] Whatever object consciousness enters,
[1640] [1640] The previous six knowings that maintain continuum are called "objects."
[1641] [1641] The knowing that grasps the nature of that in a single moment is called "present knowing."
[1642] [1642] After that, feelings that gather as pleasure, pain, or neutrality are called "feelings of contact."
[1643] [1643] These arise from the gathering of object and knowing, which is the nature of feeling.
[1644] [1644] Thus, dividing the six groups into three types results in eighteen categories:
[1645] [1645] From that itself, the elements arising from mind itself are:
[1646] [1646] The eye element arising from the clear aspect of knowing,
[1647] [1647] The ear element arising from single-pointed knowing,
[1648] [1648] The nose element arising from limitless knowing,
[1649] [1649] The tongue element arising from knowing gathered as one,
[1650] [1650] The mind element arising from knowing that enters all,
[1651] [1651] The body element arising from knowing that serves as basis for the others.
