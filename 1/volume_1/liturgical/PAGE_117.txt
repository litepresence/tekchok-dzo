[4358] V. CLEARING, STABILITY, APPEARANCE, AND EMPTYING
[4359] 4358. Clear three, etcetera: three kāyas, phenomena of path-appearance that have reached their end.
[4360] 4359. Knowledge, directionless: clear—so not emptiness cut off.
[4361] 4360. Entity, markless: clear—so not gradual.
[4362] 4361. Self-aware ultimate: those three are indivisible.
[4363] 4362. Permanent and cut, liberated from the four extremes: the mind of the indivisibility of body and primordial wisdom—thus called.
[4364] Now the three clear aspects:
[4365] 4364. When outer realms appear,
[4366] 4365. awareness appears kāya-clear, dimension color-clear.
[4367] 4366. Sky, dimension-awareness, appear indivisible.
[4368] Now the three stabilities:
[4369] 4368. Thus arisen, faith: the stability of view.
[4370] 4369. Nose-held: the stability of realm.
[4371] 4370. Delusion ceased: the stability of decision.
[4372] Now the three non-returns:
[4373] 4372. When samsara itself is known as primordially Buddha,
[4374] 4373. awareness has no continuum—so no return.
[4375] 4374. Awareness kāya appears manifestly; delusion-appearances fall into pure-appearances—so appearances do not return.
[4376] 4375. Dharmatā appears as manifold.
[4377] 4376. That: realization's confidence gained—so no return.
[4378] Now the three appearances:
[4379] 4378. Dimension: appearance without day or night.
[4380] 4379. Awareness: appearance without clear-dimming.
[4381] 4380. Dharmatā: appearance without transformation.
[4382] 4381. Thus liberated: delusion's appearances, self-pure, have no cause for samsara.
[4383] 4382. That very purity of appearance, self-arisen, conditions of samsara cease of themselves.
[4384] 4383. Even offering here, dharmatā's appearance in the intermediate state is decided—samsara's result dissolves of itself.
[4385] Now the three emptinesses:
[4386] 4384. At that time:
[4387] 4385. Awareness without comparison—delusion emptied.
[4388] 4386. Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied.
[4389] 4387. Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied.
[4390] 4388. Thus, basis, essence, flower-tantra: shown individually even.
[4391] 4389. Only a matter of reversal distinction; one essential nature.
[4392] 4390. How these three tantras proceed:  4391. As for what is shown as the basis-tantra regarding reality's actual state:  4392. Buddha and all sentient beings arise from that—so the outer tantra or the basis-tantra is established.
