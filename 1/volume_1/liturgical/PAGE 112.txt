[4122] Those also gathered into four thousand distinctions,

[4123] Those also gathered into two thousand five hundred summaries,

[4124] That also gathered into eighty-seven sharp nails,

[4125] Those also gathered into essential points,

[4126] Essential points of seeing,

[4127] Essential points of knowing—gathered as three emanations.

[4128] That also gathered into the two: command and treatise.

[4129] Treatise: many,

[4130] Tantra,

[4131] Scripture,

[4132] And instruction treatise—gathered as three.

[4133] Instruction treatise: very many,

[4134] Debate,

[4135] Establishment,

[4136] Intention,

[4137] And chiefly taking the treatise of enumeration—gathered as four.

[4138] Enumeration too:

[4139] The enumeration of meaning and instruction,

[4140] The enumeration of abiding nature,

[4141] The enumeration of established view's words,

[4142] The enumeration of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa non-duality—gathered as four.

[4143] Those all: essential points emanating,

[4144] Summary gathering,

[4145] Pointing out,

[4146] Directly bringing to the essential point—gathered as three.

[4147] Those gathered as one: the great general summary of dharma, well explained.

[4148] From the Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury,

[4149] The thorough division of established views, the fourth chapter.

[4150] Thus establishing the general manner of dharma's enumeration,

[4151] Now explaining the unsurpassable vehicle in particular,

[4152] Through knowing the nature of the tantra section,

[4153] And the definite basis arising from that—these two must be realized.

[4154] The nature of the tantra section: three,

[4155] Briefly showing the summary of tantra,

[4156] Extensively explaining that nature,

[4157] The definite branches of explanation.

[4158] First: six,

[4159] The essence of tantra,

[4160] Definite terms,

[4161] Divisions,

[4162] Rising measures,

[4163] Examples,

[4164] Validities.

[4165] First, the essence of tantra:

[4166] Awareness and that certainty brought to certainty—the great secret, cannot add or remove, definite.

[4167] Definite terms:

[4168] For the purpose of indicating lineage, tantra,

[4169] Making whatever lineages arise—thus tantra,

[4170] Definite and unbroken middle, continuous—thus tantra.

[4171] Divided: the tantra of meaning and nature,
