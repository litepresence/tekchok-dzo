[2960] Heat is shown through three aspects:
[2961] Outer, inner, and both.
[2962] Outer heat arises thus:
[2963] From the second, the stainless,
[2964] Empty of entities that appear arises.
[2965] That is concentration practice,
[2966] Declared to arise on the two grounds.
[2967] Inner heat on the sixth:
[2968] Empty of knowables, thus understood.
[2969] Heat of both is thus:
[2970] Declared to arise from the seventh.
[2971] The eighth obtains patience;
[2972] The ninth, peak completed.
[2973] The tenth, supreme world Dharma.
[2974] Likewise, wishing to obtain the ten grounds.
[2975] That is the enlightenment vehicle.
[2976] Empty: no words, no letters,
[2977] Wishing for empty of utter non-existence.
[2978] Thus it is spoken.
[2979] Second, extensively explaining established tenets, two aspects:
[2980] Mind-Only and Middle Way traditions extensively explained.
[2981] First, regarding white-red various appearances with consciousness—all this as truly the aspects of one's own mind: Mind-Only aspect-true;
[2982] And aspects of consciousness as false: Mind-Only false—of these two,
[2983] First: appearing as meaning, just aspects of one's own consciousness arising outward,
[2984] Like when a jewel ke-ke-ru image hung on a jewel tree branch by a pond bank appears in the water, the jewel-aspect appears outward.
[2985] Regarding this, divisions:
[2986] Aspects' number itself, that many consciousnesses wished;
[2987] Aspects and consciousness like a split egg, wished;
[2988] Aspects and consciousness various, two non-existent, wished—of these three,
[2989] First: when hearing sound, only sound-holding consciousness arises;
[2990] Like consciousness holding form and so forth does not arise.
[2991] Consciousness of the object entered arises; others do not arise—
[2992] Thus wishing consciousnesses as many as aspects' number.
[2993] Second: outer various appearances also arise from consciousness.
