[2567] [2502] Herein, explaining in detail,
[2568] [2503] First, the essence of the bodhisattva vehicle:
[2569] [2504] Generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six perfections.
[2570] [2505] Definition: vehicle entered through the power of compassion.
[2571] [2506] Purpose: establishing all beings in buddhahood.
[2572] [2507] Effect: attaining the ten grounds and five paths.
[2573] [2508] Division: two—the Prajñāpāramitā system and the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2574] [2509] Thus explaining the bodhisattva vehicle.
[2575] [2510] Herein, the Prajñāpāramitā system:
[2576] [2511] Realizing the three circles as empty,
[2577] [2512] Perfecting the six perfections,
[2578] [2513] Attaining buddhahood through the five paths and ten grounds.
[2579] [2514] Thus explaining the Prajñāpāramitā system.
[2580] [2515] Herein, the Tathāgatagarbha system:
[2581] [2516] Recognizing the buddha-nature endowed with virtues as existent,
[2582] [2517] Purifying adventitious defilements,
[2583] [2518] Revealing the essence spontaneously present.
[2584] [2519] Thus explaining the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2585] [2520] Herein, the grounds and paths:
[2586] [2521] The five paths: accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, and no-more-learning.
[2587] [2522] The ten grounds: joyous, stainless, luminous, radiant, difficult-to-conquer, manifest, gone-afar, immovable, good-intelligence, and cloud-of-dharma.
[2588] [2523] Thus explaining grounds and paths.
[2589] [2524] Herein, the two accumulations:
[2590] [2525] Merit accumulated through the first five perfections,
[2591] [2526] Wisdom accumulated through the perfection of discernment.
[2592] [2527] Thus explaining the two accumulations.
[2593] [2528] Herein, the final ground:
[2594] [2529] The tenth ground, cloud-of-dharma,
[2595] [2530] Surrounded by Buddhas, receiving empowerment,
[2596] [2531] Attaining complete buddhahood.
[2597] [2532] Thus explaining the final ground.
[2598] [2533] Herein, the common vehicle summary:
[2599] [2534] Through the three vehicles, beings of three capacities are tamed.
[2600] [2535] The cause vehicle establishing the cause of buddhahood.
[2601] [2536] Thus the common vehicle is explained.
