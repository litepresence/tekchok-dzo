[5891] Arise without sound or letters in meaning.
[5892] From the Uttaratantra:
[5893] Like an echo, without letters,
[5894] Thus it is spoken.
[5895] As the sound of an echo—
[5896] Arising from another's awareness,
[5897] Without concept, without fabrication,
[5898] Thus is the Tathāgata's speech.
[5899] Without concept, without fabrication,
[5900] Neither abiding outside nor within.
[5901] By this manner.
[5902] Regarding that, the places where the tantra arises are of three types:
[5903] Dharmakāya's abode:
[5904] Within the great palace of dharmadhātu,
[5905] Teacher Samantabhadra,
[5906] To the gathering of the ocean of wisdom-retinue,
[5907] The Dharma of Great Perfection, self-nature,
[5908] At the time beyond expression of dharmatā,
[5909] Is spoken without words or letters.
[5910] Saṃbhogakāya's abode:
[5911] Within the dense array of complete purity,
[5912] Teacher Saṃbhogakāya Vairocana, to the retinue—the five rigpa-Buddhas,
[5913] The five mothers such as Ākāśadhātvīśvarī,
[5914] Bodhisattvas such as Kṣitigarbha,
[5915] Consorts such as Mohinī,
[5916] Within the self-appearing maṇḍala filling the whole of space,
[5917] Enumerates the unsurpassed Great Vehicle Dharma—
[5918] Though not spoken from tongue with the vowel-sounds of the six letters' self-sound, makes understood
[5919] At the time of wisdom's self-appearance.
[5920] Nirmāṇakāya's abode: Tuṣita upper chamber and so forth,
[5921] Teacher Vajradhara, Vajrasattva, abiding in wisdom-illusion body,
[5922] To retinue transcending the world, appearing as guides of the fortunate, and
[5923] Bodhisattvas,
[5924] Siddhas,
[5925] Wisdom ḍākinīs,
[5926] Worldly retinue—gods,
[5927] Humans,
[5928] Asuras,
[5929] Garuḍas,
[5930] Gandharvas,
[5931] Nāgas, and countless others,
[5932] Teaches inconceivable sūtras and tantras,
[5933] For time spanning eons immeasurable to a hundred.
[5934] These are called the perfection of abode, occasion, and time,
[5935] From the Thalgyur:
