[2867] In the Uttaratantra commentary:
[2868] "All true paths are compounded;
[2869] All compounded are relative." Thus.
[2870] Dharma-nature dwelling as natural emptiness, wisdom that follows and measures, with the aspect of pacified elaboration, is ultimate truth.
[2871] Divided: general type, ultimate of sign and word;
[2872] And non-general, ultimate of authentic nature—of these two,
[2873] First: wisdom realizing that all dharmas, analyzed and examined through reasoning, are primordially established as nothing-establishing dharma-nature, arisen accordant with nature.
[2874] From the Two Truths:
[2875] "Arising etc. negated is ultimate;
[2876] For the purpose of accordance, it is also accepted.
[2877] The non-arising, all elaborations peaceful—
[2878] Ultimate is indicated by this term."
[2879] So it is said.
[2880] Second:
[2881] The sphere transcending elaborations of existence and non-existence, primordially pure by nature.
[2882] From the Root of Wisdom:
[2883] "Not known from other, peaceful,
[2884] Without thought, purpose undifferentiated,
[2885] Unelaborated by elaborations—
[2886] That is its characteristic."
[2887] So it is said.
[2888] Second, the stages of knowing and putting into practice:
[2889] For a bodhisattva householder, whether lay-vows are taken or not,
[2890] If fully ordained, upon the basis of the novice's ten training bases,
[2891] The bhikshu's two hundred fifty disciplines,
[2892] And the bhikshuni's three hundred sixty-three,
[2893] Generating the Mahayana aspiration-and-entering mind,
[2894] Dwelling in the eighty-five training sūtras,
[2895] On the small accumulation path: four establishments of mindfulness;
[2896] Medium: four correct abandonments;
[2897] Great: four bases of miraculous power.
[2898] On the preparation path's heat and peak: five faculties.
[2899] On patience and Dharma-supreme: five strengths.
[2900] On the path of seeing: seven limbs of enlightenment.
[2901] On the meditation path's nine grounds: meditating the eightfold noble path,
[2902] Completing the ground-path heat measures and signs of great joy and so forth.
