[7058] A cemetery abode where very wild, untamed ḍākinīs reside is supreme auspicious.
[7059] Thus also:
[7060] From the Great Perfection Self-arisen:
[7061] "This supreme empowerment is shown—
[7062] In the center of great towns,
[7063] The yogi does not accomplish the purpose;
[7064] At the end of towns and cities,
[7065] In forests or empty mountain ravines,
[7066] The yogi enters the meaning of empowerment."
[7067] Thus it is spoken.

[7078] Without forms in front,
[7079] Without being-like forms,
[7080] Back supported by rock,
[7081] Side where various fruits blaze,
[7082] Front where clear water flows with sandalwood,
[7083] Or abode like food,
[7084] Mountain ranges all complete, not cut,
[7085] Where various bird voices call.
[7086] Thus it is spoken.
