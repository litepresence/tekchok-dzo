[6801] Having emptied the seeds of the student's six families,
[6802] Purifying the six afflictions,
[6803] The meaning of the six wisdoms arises,
[6804] For that itself possesses that capability.
[6805] Also, dividing the guru, there are root and
[6806] Branch, two from:
[6807] First, the root guru:
[6808] Completing four characteristics, having established empowerment as the basis,
[6809] Explains the tantra,
[6810] Shows oral instructions,
[6811] Now also practices the oral instructions shown by that guru.
[6812] The oral instruction guru, having established empowerment as the basis,
[6813] Explains the tantra, possessing two;
[6814] If oral instructions are transmitted, becomes the branch guru possessing three.
[6815] Incidentally, the master who trains:
[6816] From the Rangshar:
[6817] "Great ignorance and pride,
[6818] Foolish words attached outward,
[6819] Not mindful of secret mantra's meaning,
[6820] Arrogant speech criticizing others,
[6821] Entered wrong path,
[6822] Face of empowerment's maṇḍala not seen,
[6823] Samaya spread,
[6824] Unable to answer questions,
[6825] Little learning, great pride—
[6826] The student's demon, master not examined,
[6827] Not a secret mantra teaching master,
[6828] Cannot teach Great Perfection Ati;
[6829] Do not associate with that."
[6830] Thus it is spoken.
[6831] Second, the student's self-nature:
[6832] Mind reversed from saṃsāra's dharmas,
[6833] Great devotion and longing-mind toward guru, Dharma, and companions,
[6834] Faith firm, mind not entering other than Dharma,
[6835] Desiring the definitive meaning, great giving-capability and diligence,
[6836] Few attachments, good nature,
[6837] Great wisdom, abiding in samaya and vows,
[6838] Accord with others' minds, transforming through Dharma,
[6839] Listening to guru's speech, not confusing the secret door,
[6840] Great study and contemplation, self-nature tamed,
[6841] Especially possessing devotion to guru as Buddha or surpassing that,
[6842] Possessing ten dharmas,
[6843] A good student of supreme liberation,
[6844] Definitely obtaining supreme liberation from saṃsāra quickly.
[6845] Thus also:
