[10155] From the Tantra of the Supreme Trunk of Samaya Arrangements:
[10156] Promises must not be transgressed,
[10157] The guru's commitments must not be broken.
[10158] The guru's activities must not be wrong,
[10159] One's body, speech, and mind—all
[10160] Must not stray from Dharma.
[10161] Acting for the benefit of all beings,
[10162] Always respecting the guru,
[10163] Not transgressing supreme samaya.
[10164] Holding vajra and bell,
[10165] Holding substances suitable for mantra.
[10166] Generally, from root samaya:
[10167] What should be secret and entrusted,
[10168] Secret promises and pledges,
[10169] If wrong conduct with speech or mind,
[10170] This too will increase the uninterrupted continuum.
[10171] Distinctive Dharma arising from empowerment
[10172] Must not be revealed to others; join with mind.
[10173] The guru's mind—if harmed
[10174] By body, speech, or mind,
[10175] Wrong deeds must not be done.
[10176] Similarly, toward vajra siblings
[10177] Harm and injury must not be done.
[10178] Thus.
[10179] Thus, guarding the twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind distinctions is the distinctive Dharma here.
[10180] Furthermore, from Consequence:
[10181] Furthermore, samaya and discipline explained:
[10182] The guru is the basis of Buddha worship,
[10183] Dharma and Sangha, yi-dam deity,
[10184] Vajra sky-goers—to these
[10185] Gathering and worship must not cease.
[10186] Seeing a guru with proper characteristics,
[10187] Praise and worship should be complete.
[10188] Do not disparage women, do not be angry.
[10189] Do not disparage aggregates; rely on yi-dam.
[10190] Mandala, mantra, and deity,
[10191] Mudra reliance is indeed proper.
[10192] Do not break the faithful gathering,
[10193] Do not disturb the virtuous mind.
[10194] The discipline-possessed should dwell in samaya.
[10195] Furthermore, the training sequence:
[10196] Complete bodily conduct,
[10197] Speech must be strictly restrained.
[10198] Mind dwells, examines, and analyzes.
[10199] Enter sequence, do karma sequence.
[10200] Always hand and pill karma,
[10201] Place all channels in the drop-net.
[10202] Garland and necklace, even half,
[10203] Beautifully conduct the wheel.
[10204] Take the chief of supreme attainments,
[10205] Do with the wheel of six place-ornaments.
[10206] All these, without transgression or degeneration, must be earnestly done.
[10207] If these are exceeded, faults are measureless.
[10208] From the Tantra of the Jewel-Stacked Wheel:
