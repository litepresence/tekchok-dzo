[6343] From the two reflections:
[6344] Reflection is:
[6345] Pervading wherever in the six realms, from beings' aspiration and teacher's blessing.
[6346] From the three actual teachings:
[6347] The two teachings of dharmakāya and saṃbhogakāya—teacher's self-appearance, pure sphere,
[6348] The palace of dharmadhātu, and
[6349] The two dense arrays of clear light,
[6350] Existing as the permanent, continuous wheel;
[6351] The common teaching of emanation-kāya, the sequence of sūtra and tantra, and
[6352] The two uncommon, great secret, definitive supreme vehicles—
[6353] Do not exist other than the realms of gods and humans possessing particular merit,
[6354] For ḍākinīs also exist in the realms of gods and humans.
[6355] In this great secret definitive teaching, for those meeting the three actual seeds of the teaching, liberation without effort is doubtless.
[6356] From the letter of speech-emanation,
[6357] Written in harmony with the body-color of whatever teaching the Buddha came to,
[6358] Placed in a jewel casket, carried in the left armpit, reading from time to time, and
[6359] Making veneration and worship, liberation is also without effort—
[6360] Also in this life, long life,
[6361] Without disease,
[6362] All wishes accomplished,
[6363] Opportunity not found by demons and obstacles that lead astray,
[6364] Making the end of life blissful, without the suffering of severing illness at the time of death, and
[6365] For those seeing the door of introduction here, if so, seizing firm ground in the wisdom-lamp of the intermediate state, and
[6366] Even being of the vehicle holding mental analysis,
[6367] Birth in the pure field, and
[6368] Even ordinary, meeting this great secret, liberation, etc.—immeasurable qualities exist as the support for birth in the higher blissful realm.
[6369] From the Thalgyur:
[6370] Making the sun very illuminating,
[6371] The three things of body, speech, and mind—
[6372] To whoever descended, without effort,
[6373] Definitely obtains Buddhahood.
[6374] Therefore the key point of blessing:
[6375] Also from the very speech-emanation,
[6376] Written with the teaching's color,
[6377] Placed in the left armpit,
[6378] If read and held in time,
[6379] Complete awakening is certain without doubt.
[6380] Also if this tantra is constantly read,
[6381] By that also, becomes like the above.
[6382] Thus it is spoken.
