[6713] [6713] Placed in the arhat result itself;
[6714] [6714] Then six dark aeons,
[6715] [6715] After that passed, two hundred-thousand arhats,
[6716] [6716] Gathered in one's own retinue;
[6717] [6717] Sūtra teaching, eight aeons,
[6718] [6718] Placed at the end of provisional-definitive action.
[6719] [6719] From miraculous power and control,
[6720] [6720] Definitely propelled, the teaching complete,
[6721] [6721] Again showing the manner of parinirvāṇa.
[6722] [6722] Then two dark aeons,
[6723] [6723] Then from the teacher's body born,
[6724] [6724] The retinue of great bodhisattvas,
[6725] [6725] Eight thousand gathered,
[6726] [6726] Supreme aspiration, Excellent-Terror-Glory,
[6727] [6727] Greatly showing, the teaching gathered.
[6728] [6728] Abhidharma teaching, a hundred aeons,
[6729] [6729] All obtaining result in one life.
[6730] [6730] At this time, saṃsāra is eradicated;
[6731] [6731] By beings, Buddhahood is obtained;
[6732] [6732] The appearance of six migrations is not possible.
[6733] [6733] In twenty thousand aeons,
[6734] [6734] From the continuity of beings' saṃsāra ceasing,
[6735] [6735] Embodied ones do not appear.
[6736] [6736] Then, by the distinction of karma,
[6737] [6737] Although beings have no former afflictions,
[6738] [6738] By the power of arisen latent tendencies,
[6739] [6739] Forms taking extremely subtle,
[6740] [6740] From extremely subtle, many in number,
[6741] [6741] Form-possessing beings' bodies will grow.
[6742] [6742] Thus inexpressible by words,
[6743] [6743] The end of the teaching, inconceivable—
[6744] [6744] Briefly indicated by words.
[6745] [6745] Thus it is spoken.
[6746] [6746] Here, some masters
[6747] [6747] Consider that all beings in Samantabhadra's abode are emptied,
[6748] [6748] Some consider that all beings of the great Brahma arranged by Vajradhara are liberated;
[6749] [6749] "The end of the teaching is inconceivable,"
[6750] [6750] Thus it is considered that in Samantabhadra's abode, still immeasurable.
[6751] [6751] However, there is no contradiction,
[6752] [6752] For by Samantabhadra's compassion, all are liberated, and
[6753] [6753] Arising from the sphere, still immeasurable latent tendencies—the two are not contradictory;
[6754] [6754] Even if recognized as the measure of vast liberation, it is supreme good.
[6755] [6755] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
