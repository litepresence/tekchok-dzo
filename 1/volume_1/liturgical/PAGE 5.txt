[112] All sentient-beings realms exist.
[113] The training-field is very vast.
[114] That also—all earth, water, fire, wind, sky where pervading, gathered within the Great-Brahma eon.
[115] Then, when numberless fields beyond measure appear even in one particle place of sentient-beings' confusion-appearance,
[116] To pure karma appearance, Buddha's great activities appear variously,
[117] Again nirvana,
[118] Teaching dwelling,
[119] Path accomplishment etc., to impure ones enjoying bliss-results of higher-realms and liberation, teaching subsides,
[120] Appearing as lower-realms,
[121] Eon destruction etc., enjoying various bliss-suffer appearances—
[122] Like a dream.
[123] Thus, even in one particle place, great fields of mountains and continents etc. appear—
[124] Beings' confusion-appearance, clear-appearance without truth, thus valid.
[125] As said in the Arya Samadhi King Sutra:
[126] Even in the extent of a hair-tip, many Buddhas,
[127] As many as Ganga's river sands,
[128] Those Victors' fields also that many,
[129] Those characteristics different, eons not the same,
[130] In the extent of a hair, the five realms,
[131] Sentient hells and animals' realm,
[132] Yama world, gods and humans dwell,
[133] Not mixed, not becoming harm,
[134] In those places, lakes and oceans,
[135] Rivers, likewise lakes and pools,
[136] Not mixed, not becoming harm,
[137] Thus the Victor's Dharma inconceivable,
[138] In that place, many mountains,
[139] Surrounding Sumeru, great Sumeru,
[140] Btang-zung and great btang-zung,
[141] 'Bigs-byed, vulture-heap, snow mountain,
[142] In that place, unbearable hell-beings,
[143] Hot and very hot, unpleasant experience,
[144] Then hell-beings' feeling,
[145] Makes them experience following those sufferings,
[146] In that place, gods' palaces,
[147] Those twelve leagues pleasant,
[148] Even by many thousand gods,
[149] Gods' joy, very bliss experienced,
[150] In that place Buddhas open,
[151] Teaching of world-knowledge blazes appearing,
[152] In that place itself, Dharma subsides,
[153] Sound of guide's nirvana also heard,
[154] Humans in their own houses like dreams,
[155] Intoxicated with joy in desire qualities,
[156] Waking after, that desire not seen,
[157] That is known as dream by that,
[158] Thus see, hear, know and understand distinction,
[159] All these not true, like dream.
[160] Thus,
[161] Thus in the world of one particle place, even in appearing subtle particles, sentient-beings' fields and arrangements are immeasurable.
[162] Thus in the world of one particle place, even in appearing subtle particles, sentient-beings' fields and arrangements are immeasurable.
