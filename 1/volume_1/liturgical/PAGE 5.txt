[112] All sentient-beings' realms exist.
[113] The training-field is very vast.
[114] That also—all earth, water, fire, wind, sky wherever pervading—all gathered within the great-Brahma eon.
[115] Then, when numberless fields beyond measure appear even in one particle-place of sentient-beings' confused appearance,
[116] To pure-karma appearance, Buddha's great activities appear variously,
[117] Again nirvana,
[118] Teaching dwelling,
[119] To impure ones enjoying bliss-fruit of higher-realms and liberation, path accomplishment etc., teaching subsides,
[120] Appearing as lower-realms,
[121] Enjoying various bliss-suffer appearance of eon-destruction etc.—
[122] Like a dream.
[123] Thus, even in one particle-place, great fields of mountains, continents, and so forth appear—
[124] Beings' confused appearance, clear appearance without truth—thus valid.
[125] As it is said in the Arya Samadhi King Sutra:
[126] Even in the extent of a hair-tip, many Buddhas,
[127] As many as the sands of the Ganga river,
[128] Those Victors' fields also that many,
[129] Those characteristics not the same, eons not equal,
[130] In the extent of a hair, the five realms,
[131] Sentient hells and animals' realm,
[132] Yama's world, gods and humans dwell,
[133] Not mixed, not becoming harmful,
[134] In those places, lakes and oceans,
[135] Rivers, likewise lakes and pools,
[136] Not mixed, not becoming harmful.
[137] Thus the Victor's dharma is inconceivable.
[138] In that place, many mountains,
[139] Surrounding Sumeru, great Sumeru,
[140] Btang-zung and great btang-zung,
[141] 'Bigs-byed, vulture-heap, snow mountain,
[142] In that place, unbearable hell-beings,
[143] Hot and extremely hot, experiencing unpleasantness,
[144] Then hell-beings' feeling,
[145] Makes them experience following those sufferings.
[146] In that place, gods' palaces,
[147] Those twelve leagues of pleasantness,
[148] Even by many thousands of gods,
[149] With gods' joy, experiencing very great bliss.
[150] In that place, Buddhas arise,
[151] Teaching of world-knowledge blazing in appearance.
[152] In that very place, dharma also subsides,
[153] The sound of guide's nirvana also heard.
[154] Humans in their own houses like dreams,
[155] Intoxicated with joy in desire-qualities,
[156] Waking after, not seeing that desire.
[157] That is known as dream by that.
[158] Thus seeing, hearing, knowing, and distinguishing differences,
[159] All these are untrue, like dreams.
[160] So it is.
[161] Thus in the world of one particle-place, even in appearing subtle particles, sentient-beings' fields and arrangements are measureless.
