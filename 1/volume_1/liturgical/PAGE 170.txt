[6756] Showing the difficult points from the definitive meaning of the great secret—the fifth chapter.
[6757] Thus, having established from the tantra's abode of knowing, the branch of confidence,
[6758] Now, from that abode, whatever meanings arise are to be shown;
[6759] First, the gate of entering the unsurpassed vehicle is empowerment,
[6760] Here, for the definite arrangement of that abode, three:
[6761] The basis for entering empowerment,
[6762] The path of actual empowerment,
[6763] The result of completed empowerment.
[6764] First, four:
[6765] The characteristic of the guru who bestows-accomplishes,
[6766] The self-nature of the student who is bestowed,
[6767] The Dharma to be done in common,
[6768] The activity of empowerment, how bestowed.
[6769] First:
[6770] Completing all qualities suitable for guru, free from all faults, great waves of compassion—
[6771] From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[6772] "The vajra-meaning-possessing guru,
[6773] Of good nature and skilled in teaching,
[6774] Having obtained empowerment, applies the meaning of secret mantra,
[6775] Knows all outer and inner actions,
[6776] Without gathering and separation from the yi-dam deity,
[6777] Without distraction from samādhi,
[6778] Possessing the meaning of Dzogchen instructions,
[6779] Skilled in the tantra of secret mantra secrets,
[6780] Does all outer and inner accomplishments,
[6781] Not transgressing from the meaning of view,
[6782] Has released outer and inner secret actions.
[6783] Like a jewel of qualities,
[6784] Engaging the inexhaustible treasure."
[6785] Thus it is spoken.
[6786] From the Thalgyur:
[6787] "The great Vajradhara guru's
[6788] Sequence is to be explained;
[6789] The guru of complete characteristics
[6790] Is the source of all qualities,
[6791] The holder of the basis of perfect awakening."
[6792] Thus it is spoken.
[6793] Here, possessing six characteristics:
[6794] Discarding saṃsāra's dharmas behind,
[6795] Few desires and knowing contentment,
[6796] Skilled in application and possessing experience,
[6797] Skilled in the tantra's word-meaning and earnest in accomplishment,
[6798] Skilled in the meaning of view and complete in capability,
[6799] Great compassion and joy in giving.
[6800] Completing these is called "Glorious Vajradhara."
