[6262] [6262] This, three months after birth,
[6263] [6263] Becomes darkness for the interval of sixty.
[6264] [6264] After that, at Vulture Peak,
[6265] [6265] By the monk Śobhya-youth,
[6266] [6266] Abides for five hundred fifty years.
[6267] [6267] After that passed, below, at the border of Jambudvīpa,
[6268] [6268] In the land called Kāśmīra,
[6269] [6269] In the sound-possessing city,
[6270] [6270] Bird body, human face,
[6271] [6271] Born among low-caste families.
[6272] [6272] This, ten years after birth,
[6273] [6273] Becomes darkness for sixty.
[6274] [6274] After that passed, below, in Jambudvīpa,
[6275] [6275] In the center, five yojanas to the east,
[6276] [6276] By the monk Śākya Jīka,
[6277] [6277] This, for the interval of ten years,
[6278] [6278] Becomes like a blazing lamp.
[6279] [6279] Thus by the seven sequences,
[6280] [6280] Flourishing and decline are made in Jambudvīpa.
[6281] [6281] Thus it is spoken.
[6282] [6282] Thus, the seven complete flourishing and declining, after life of ten years, below, up to here, the three seeds of the teaching do not abide in this field;
[6283] [6283] From here, descended to the field of beautiful arrangement in the southern direction, at the time of the completion of that field's deeds by the seven flourishing and declining,
[6284] [6284] The time of Saha's emptiness;
[6285] [6285] Again, those three leap to the vast protector world of the northern direction,
[6286] [6286] After the Buddha Beautiful-Utpala-Flower held and did the seven flourishing and declining,
[6287] [6287] Leap to the world called "Vast Sound Topknot" in the western direction,
[6288] [6288] After the Buddha Destroyer-of-Saṃsāra held and abided for seven hundred-thousand years in the manner of seven flourishing and declining,
[6289] [6289] All beings of all fields existing in the great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara, along with that field, are liberated in the primordial ground;
[6290] [6290] The great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara, with vessel and environment, becomes empty,
[6291] [6291] Abides for eighty-five aeons as one sky.
[6292] [6292] The three seeds of the teaching:
[6293] [6293] By Vajradhara's great deeds completed,
[6294] [6294] Dissolve themselves in the peaceful sphere of dharmatā, not appearing to people.
