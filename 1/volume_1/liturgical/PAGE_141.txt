[5414] [5414] SA+NGA tagged—short; DA+NA tagged—short. The branches that arise are pronounced accordingly. Thus it is spoken.
[5415] [5415] Also CA, JA, ZA, ZHA, and CHA have arisen; one should not doubt that India does not [have them], for although Sanskrit's well-composed letters do not [exist], the ḍākinīs of Uḍḍiyāṇa have those sounds, so these forms have arisen.
[5416] [5416] These tantras are the letters of Uḍḍiyāṇa, held by the ḍākinīs.
[5417] [5417] The second, near-sound expression, is explained in two aspects: the single [letter] and the expression of the sphere's abode.
[5418] [5418] The single letter's abode is A, GA, SHA, and so forth—joined to whichever root of saṃsāra or nirvāṇa and explained. Tibetans recite GA, JA, DA, BA, and so forth, joined with aspiration. Other letters are recited separately.
[5419] [5419] Also, for KARMA, SARVA, and so forth, the prefix sound is called RA and RBA. When alone, it is called MA and BA.
[5420] [5420] The expression of the sphere's abode has three [aspects]: the prefix, the branch, and the stacked [letter].
[5421] [5421] The first is the double-stacked, called "prefix." When life-force is concordant, it is recited as one: like BHA, DHA, JHA, etc.
[5422] [5422] These, the letter's consort sound, are expressed with the ZHA-manner of HA sound slightly emanating.
[5423] [5423] When life-force is not concordant, it is separated and expressed separately: like AṬA, CAṬA, CA RI, recited as A ṬA, CA ṬA, CA RI.
[5424] [5424] All stacked types are thus.
[5425] [5425] The second also has life-concordant and life-discordant sequences, similar to that.
[5426] [5426] Separately, in Tibetan manner, like KAG CHEN: above KA-like, NA RO two, ZHENG BU two, GU GU two, KLAD KOR one, ZHABS KYU two, YA-tagged two, RA-tagged two, RI part one—when these arise, the mother [letter] arises fourteen times.
[5427] [5427] "See the classes of these letters aside." Stacked letters, note 2.
