[2831] Here follows the general path briefly stated.

[2832] The explanation of the various established tenet positions divides into two parts.

[2833] First: through the methodological tradition of the Vehicle of Characteristics, the path for sharp faculties and powerful mind-power arises. This should be understood as the self-nature of the two truths of the basis.

[2834] Knowing this, how then to practice.

[2835] The presentation of the fruit of the complete path, with three divisions:

[2836] First:

[2837] All phenomena gathered by samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.

[2838] As the Root Wisdom states:

[2839] "The Buddhas taught the Dharma,
[2840] Relying correctly upon the two truths:
[2841] The conventional truth of the world,
[2842] And the ultimate truth of meaning."

[2843] Thus it is said.

[2844] From the Illusion Net:

[2845] "One abides in the manner of the two truths."

[2846] Thus.

[2847] As for this: phenomena marked by characteristics that appear as objects of intellect are the conventional truth.

[2848] Divided into the false and the true conventional—these two.

[2849] First: all phenomena including the container and contained of appearance and existence arranged by intellect are the false conventional.

[2850] Because appearance manifests as the essence of object-delusion appearing as intellect's falseness.

[2851] Those also imputed appearances arise as appearances accordant with the function of deluded intellect.

[2852] They possess the power to function.

[2853] When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence—

[2854] In the manner of the eight examples of illusion:

[2855] Arising as non-existent yet clear-appearing,

[2856] As before:

[2857] Like a dream, like an illusion,
[2858] Like a gandharva city,
[2859] Thus arise, thus abide,
[2860] Thus also cease.

[2861] Thus.

[2862] The true conventional:
[2863] Though appearing deluded, it serves as the cause of blissful migration and liberation.

[2864] The white actions of the ten virtues,
[2865] The collections of merit such as generosity,
[2866] Gathered through the path of truth by means of the mind's samadhi of wisdom, the four aspects of seeing and meditating, serving as the field of experience for intellect.
