[2831] Here, briefly teaching the general essence of the path,
[2832] And extensively explaining individual philosophical tenets—of these two:
[2833] First, the path of those with sharp faculties and great mind-power according to the characteristic vehicle's tradition, knowing the nature of the two truths as the basis,
[2834] Knowing how to put into practice,
[2835] And teaching the fruit of completed path—three aspects.
[2836] First:
[2837] All phenomena included in appearance-existence, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, gather as the nature of the two truths.
[2838] From the Root of Wisdom:
[2839] "The Buddhas taught the Dharma
[2840] Relying correctly on the two truths:
[2841] The world's conventional truth
[2842] And the ultimate meaning truth."
[2843] Thus it is said, and
[2844] From the Māyājāla:
[2845] "Abiding in the method of the two truths."
[2846] So it is.
[2847] Regarding this, phenomena appearing as signs, appearing as objects of intellect, are conventional truths.
[2848] Divided into false and true conventional—of these two,
[2849] First, all appearance-existence, container and contained, intellect-arranged dharmas are false conventional,
[2850] For they appear to a deluded mind whose essence is false.
[2851] That which appears imputed, these appear concordant to the deluded intellect,
[2852] Capable of function,
[2853] Yet analyzed, free of inherent essence—
[2854] The method of illusion's eight examples:
[2855] Non-existent yet clearly appearing arisen.
[2856] From the previous:
[2857] "Like a dream, like an illusion,
[2858] Like a gandharva-city,
[2859] Thus arising and thus abiding,
[2860] Thus also ceasing," taught.
[2861] So it is said.
[2862] True conventional is:
[2863] Though appearing deluded, making cause for blissful migration and liberation,
[2864] The white action of ten virtues,
[2865] Generosity and so forth, collections of merit,
[2866] And the samādhi of mind of the four seeing-meditating of preparation-collection, capable cause of wisdom, objects of intellect, included in path and truth.
