[1824] From the Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[1825] The six afflictions are:
[1826] Ignorance: the grasping of the confused conceptual basis.
[1827] Delusion: confusion arising from the portion of wisdom.
[1828] Hatred: confusion arising from the stage of generation.
[1829] Pride: confusion arising from the portion of view.
[1830] Attachment: confusion arising from the portion of appearance.
[1831] Jealousy: confusion arising from unmanifest effects.
[1832] And so forth.
[1833] The afflictions are the mind that grasps all thoughts.
[1834] The memories are the mind that grasps all recollections.
[1835] The concepts that become the basis of all transitional habitual tendencies and doubts.
[1836] The portions that grasp objects and things, and so forth—are called "immeasurable."
[1837] If divided, the conceptual masses generate eighty-four thousand aspects.
[1838] Attachment,
[1839] Hatred,
[1840] Delusion—
[1841] These portions are equally divided into twenty-one thousand, one thousand, and one thousand.
[1842] All of these, although non-existent, are grasped as self—like a mirage, like water, like confusion, arising and grasping a snake where there is only a rope.
[1843] The vessels, contents, and all afflictions, although non-existent, appear as clear luminosity.
[1844] From the Pearl-Garland:
[1845] Thus the various appearances:
[1846] Like seeing a snake where there is only a rope.
[1847] Grasping that which is not that.
[1848] Outer and inner vessels and contents are formed as two.
[1849] When examined, that is merely the rope.
[1850] Vessels and contents are primordially empty.
[1851] They have the form of ultimate and conventional.
[1852] Seeing the snake is true.
[1853] Seeing the rope is truly correct.
[1854] Like a bird dwelling on high.
[1855] The nature of the two truths:
[1856] Merely the conventional world.
[1857] No relation to the ultimate.
[1858] From the expanse of emptiness,
[1859] All aspects of that are liberated.
[1860] Thus it is taught.
[1861] From the previous:
[1862] "Aggregates are like illusory emanations."
[1863] Thus it is taught.
[1864] Since vessels, contents, realms, aggregates, and so forth are called "phenomena of cyclic existence,"
