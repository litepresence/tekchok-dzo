[3050] All dharmas: various object-consciousnesses.
[3051] Nirvāṇa: attaining form-body and acting for benefit.
[3052] Therefore superior Dharma: self-aware authenticity and supreme Dharma-body—thus it is wished.
[3053] Regarding this also: considering illusion established by reasoning;
[3054] Considering appearing like illusion;
[3055] Considering as mere illusion and so forth—very many types,
[3056] Lower Svātantrika, thus numbered.

[3059] Like a barren woman's son non-existent, thus meeting-consciousness non-existent—like thus.
[3060] Conventionally non-truly-existent, ultimately nothing dwells,
[3061] Like when waking from dream, horse-elephant appearances cease,
[3062] Primordially non-existent, not established as ceasing ultimately—like thus.
