[3049] That also is like a dream, like an illusion.
[3050] All phenomena are merely various objects and consciousness.
[3051] Nirvāṇa attains form-body and works benefit.
[3052] Therefore, the excellent dharma is one's own self-aware suchness and the supreme dharma-body.
[3053] In this, there are those who assert illusion as established reasoning.
[3054] And those who assert appearance as merely illusion.
[3055] And those who assert merely illusion—various divisions beyond measure.
[3056] This is called the autonomous lower.
[3057] Second: In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides.
[3058] Since there are no objects or aspects, even the self-aware experience does not exist.
[3059] Like a barren woman's son, there is no meeting consciousness.
[3060] Since conventional truth is not true, ultimate truth is non-abiding.
[3061] When awakening from a dream, the appearance of horse and ox stops.
[3062] Since there is no beginning, meaning stops like unestablished cause.
[3063] From the intermediate mother.
[3064] In ultimate truth, samsara does not exist.
[3065] Nirvāṇa does not exist.
[3066] Emptiness does not exist.
[3067] It is merely designated by words—it is said.
[3068] In this, conventional truth is completely non-abiding.
[3069] Cause is non-abiding.
[3070] Distinction is non-abiding.
[3071] The distinguisher is non-abiding.
[3072] One is non-abiding.
[3073] Many is non-abiding.
[3074] Beyond one and many is non-abiding.
[3075] Mere appearance is completely non-abiding—various divisions beyond measure.
[3076] This is called the autonomous middle-way higher.
[3077] The consequentialist middle-way.
[3078] Thus, in ultimate truth, nothing is established.
[3079] All is negated: conventional appearance as merely illusion established, and so forth.
[3080] Asserting beyond nature from the extremes of existence and non-existence, free from all claims.
[3081] As the Noble King of Samadhi states:
[3082] Permanent and impermanent—this is also an extreme.
[3083] Existence and non-existence—both are extremes.
[3084] Therefore, both extremes are completely abandoned.
[3085] The wise one does not even abide in the middle.
[3086] Thus.
