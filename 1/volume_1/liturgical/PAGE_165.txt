[6547] [6547] Shown is the number of self-pure arising in this life.
[6548] [6548] All who have obtained Buddhahood, wherever from, have become Buddha from the abode of this great secret,
[6549] [6549] Having seen the direct dharmatā of awareness-manifest, becoming Buddha—
[6550] [6550] For that is not surpassed by others.
[6551] [6551] That also, by the power of having gathered accumulations over many former aeons,
[6552] [6552] First meeting with this teaching,
[6553] [6553] Called the heart of the result for becoming Buddha without taking long;
[6554] [6554] All meeting with this teaching quickly obtain Buddhahood,
[6555] [6555] For they meet the heart of the result.
[6556] [6556] O fortunate master-disciple, possessor of Dharma,
[6557] [6557] In this life, or
[6558] [6558] In the bardo, or
[6559] [6559] In whichever field of natural emanation-kāya, definitely accomplish Buddhahood quickly,
[6560] [6560] For the cause, the power of definite Buddhahood-accomplishment without obstruction, meeting the pure teaching's heart of result, and by faith conducting in that.
[6561] [6561] O fortunate master-disciple, possessor of Dharma,
[6562] [6562] Formerly worshipped countless Buddhas and gathered in the retinue of Samantabhadra,
[6563] [6563] For conducting in the unsurpassed secret vehicle again.
[6564] [6564] If even merely meeting the common vehicle definitely has former merit-roots such as worshipping Buddhas,
[6565] [6565] Meeting such uncommon teaching has special former accumulations, and it pervades that well-practiced before.
[6566] [6566] Also from the Abhisamayālaṃkāra:
[6567] [6567] "Having specially served the Buddhas,
[6568] [6568] Planted merit-roots toward that,
[6569] [6569] Protected by spiritual friends,
[6570] [6570] Are vessels for hearing this."
[6571] [6571] Thus it was spoken.
[6572] [6572] The enumeration of liberation in the bardo:
[6573] [6573] Also from the former:
[6574] [6574] "Between the two births, manifestly Buddha,
[6575] [6575] In the interval of ten years of life, these:
[6576] [6576] Seven thousand meet the mother of appearances;
[6577] [6577] Males, indeed six thousand;
[6578] [6578] Female form, one thousand.
[6579] [6579] Thus males and females, boys and girls,
[6580] [6580] Whatever form they dwell in, easy—all who meet this are completely liberated."
[6581] [6581] Thus it is spoken.
[6582] [6582] That also, having entered this definite secret supreme and obtained guidance and instructions,
