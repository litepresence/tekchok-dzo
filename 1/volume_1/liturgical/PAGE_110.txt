[4040] [4040] Not depending on words, completely depending on discerning wisdom.
[4041] [4041] Self-nature:
[4042] [4042] Directly seeing, not dwelling in the intellect-grasping view.
[4043] [4043] Characteristic: the measure of four appearances arrived at, the result of three bodies and five wisdoms not aimed at.
[4044] [4044] From that, this is the unsurpassed secret:
[4045] [4045] Below, through dharmatā's intellect-confidence reaching,
[4046] [4046] Here, through the guru's power, existing as the direct object of the senses—specially superior.
[4047] [4047] Thus shown, all cycles gathered into one sūtra, the definite sequence of division and summary:
[4048] [4048] These Great Perfections: nine in the expanse,
[4049] [4049] Twenty-one thousand volumes,
[4050] [4050] Three sections,
[4051] [4051] Thirty-five thousand chapters,
[4052] [4052] Eight great sections,
[4053] [4053] One hundred eighty sharp nails,
[4054] [4054] Fifteen hundred summaries,
[4055] [4055] Seven bundles of distinctions,
[4056] [4056] One and a half hundred-thousand enumerations,
[4057] [4057] Five thousand essential points,
[4058] [4058] Sixty-four hundred-thousand ślokas,
[4059] [4059] Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras dwelling as essences.
[4060] [4060] From the definitive conclusion,
[4061] [4061] From the nature of Great Perfection,
[4062] [4062] Word-distinctions emanate.
[4063] [4063] From the three sections, nine expanses become,
[4064] [4064] From the word summary, ślokas,
[4065] [4065] From fourteen hundred-thousand,
[4066] [4066] Thirty-five thousand chapters,
[4067] [4067] Twenty-one thousand volumes,
[4068] [4068] The spoken object equal to the sky's end,
[4069] [4069] Cutting the thoughts of disciples and beings,
[4070] [4070] From this, the spoken object abbreviated,
[4071] [4071] To one hundred eighty sharp nails,
[4072] [4072] Summaries one and a half thousand,
[4073] [4073] Three thousand great gathered essential points,
[4074] [4074] To forty thousand deviation-obstacles,
[4075] [4075] Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras,
[4076] [4076] The sequence of word-speaking clearly established.
[4077] [4077] Thus it is.
[4078] [4078] These too, when summarized:
[4079] [4079] Mind Section,
[4080] [4080] Expanse Section,
[4081] [4081] Instruction Section—gathered as three.
[4082] [4082] There: all of Mind Section—the inexpressible expanse of dharmatā,
[4083] [4083] The expanse of view's non-negation,
[4084] [4084] The expanse of conduct's non-affirmation—gathered as three.
[4085] [4085] That also gathered in five thousand name-affixed tantras.
