[2465] Herein, what are the two divisions?
[2466] First, explaining Vaibhāṣika:
[2467] They hold the four truths as directly realized,
[2468] And the aggregates, elements, and sense-bases as truly established.
[2469] They assert direct perception, inference, and scripture as valid cognitions.
[2470] The view of the path is established through three characteristics.
[2471] The effects are explained as four pairs of persons.
[2472] Thus explaining the Vaibhāṣika view.
[2473] Second, explaining Sautrāntika:
[2474] They hold the four truths as directly realized,
[2475] And emptiness and selflessness as the nature of realization.
[2475] Cognizing cognitions are twelvefold knowing.
[2476] Objects are established as the four truths.
[2477] Selflessness of persons is established through outer grasping.
[2478] Selflessness of dharmas is established through lack of true existence.
[2479] Thus explaining the Sautrāntika view.
[2480] Herein, how to explain the path cultivation?
[2481] The antidote for the three poisons is emptiness.
[2482] Individual antidotes: meditation on impurity for desire,
[2483] Meditation on love for anger, and dependent arising for delusion.
[2484] The faculties are dull, medium, and sharp.
[2485] Effort is made according to faculties.
[2486] Bodhisattvas' path is the five previously gone.
[2487] Thus explaining path cultivation in brief.
[2488] Herein, how to explain the effects?
[2489] Hearer effects: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and foe-destroyer.
[2490] Self-enlightened: solitary rhinoceros-like.
[2491] Bodhisattvas: the ten grounds of great joy.
[2492] Thus explaining the effects.
[2493] Herein, how to explain the self-enlightened vehicle?
[2494] They realize dependent arising through their own power,
[2495] Without relying upon a teacher in their final life.
[2496] Like a rhinoceros, they wander alone.
[2497] Thus explaining the self-enlightened vehicle.
[2498] Herein, how to explain the bodhisattva vehicle?
[2499] Generated bodhicitta, engaged in the six perfections,
[2500] Perfecting the two accumulations, attaining enlightenment for others' benefit.
[2501] Thus explaining the bodhisattva vehicle in brief.
