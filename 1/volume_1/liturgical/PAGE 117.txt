[4358] Clear three etcetera, three kāyas path-appearance's phenomena end-reached ones,

[4359] Knowledge directionless clear, empty cut-off not-is,

[4360] Entity markless, clear gradual not-is,

[4361] Self-aware ultimate, those three indivisible,

[4362] Permanent-cut four-extremes liberated, body primordial-wisdom gather-separate non-existent mind, thus called.

[4363] That, clear three:

[4364] Outer realm appear time,

[4365] Awareness kāya-clear, dimension color-clear,

[4366] Sky dimension-awareness gather-separate non-existent clear.

[4367] Stability three:

[4368] Thus arisen faith, view's stability,

[4369] Nose held, realm's stability,

[4370] Delusion ceased, decided stability.

[4371] Non-return three:

[4372] That time saṃsāra itself primordially Buddha known,

[4373] Awareness continuum non-existent, non-return,

[4374] Awareness kāya manifestly appear, delusion-appearance pure-appearance fallen, appearance non-return,

[4375] Dharmatā that various appear,

[4376] That realization-confidence gain, non-return.

[4377] Appearance three:

[4378] Dimension day-night non-existent appear,

[4379] Awareness clear-dim non-existent appear,

[4380] Dharmatā change-shift non-existent appear.

[4381] Thus liberated, delusion's appearance self-pure, saṃsāra cause non-existent,

[4382] That very pure's appearance self-arisen, saṃsāra condition self-cease,

[4383] Here offering too, dharmatā intermediate-state's appearance decided, saṃsāra's result self-dissolve.

[4384] Empty three, this time:

[4385] Awareness compare non-existent, delusion empty,

[4386] Mind condition non-existent, conceptualization's stain empty,

[4387] Light go-come non-existent, elements condition empty.

[4388] Thus basis, essence, flower's tantra, individually shown,

[4389] Reverse distinction only, essence one.

[4390] These three tantra how go?

[4391] Reality's actual-state, basis's tantra shown:

[4392] Buddha beings all that arisen, thus outermost's tantra or basis's tantra established.
