V. CLEARING, STABILITY, APPEARANCE, AND EMPTYING

4358. Clear three, etcetera: three kāyas, phenomena of path-appearance that have reached their end.

4359. Knowledge, directionless: clear—so not emptiness cut off.

4360. Entity, markless: clear—so not gradual.

4361. Self-aware ultimate: those three are indivisible.

4362. Permanent and cut, liberated from the four extremes: the mind of the indivisibility of body and primordial wisdom—thus called.

Now the three clear aspects:

4364. When outer realms appear,

4365. awareness appears kāya-clear, dimension color-clear.

4366. Sky, dimension-awareness, appear indivisible.

Now the three stabilities:

4368. Thus arisen, faith: the stability of view.

4369. Nose-held: the stability of realm.

4370. Delusion ceased: the stability of decision.

Now the three non-returns:

4372. When samsara itself is known as primordially Buddha,

4373. awareness has no continuum—so no return.

4374. Awareness kāya appears manifestly; delusion-appearances fall into pure-appearances—so appearances do not return.

4375. Dharmatā appears as manifold.

4376. That: realization's confidence gained—so no return.

Now the three appearances:

4378. Dimension: appearance without day or night.

4379. Awareness: appearance without clear-dimming.

4380. Dharmatā: appearance without transformation.

4381. Thus liberated: delusion's appearances, self-pure, have no cause for samsara.

4382. That very purity of appearance, self-arisen, conditions of samsara cease of themselves.

4383. Even offering here, dharmatā's appearance in the intermediate state is decided—samsara's result dissolves of itself.

Now the three emptinesses:

4384. At that time:

4385. Awareness without comparison—delusion emptied.

4386. Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied.

4387. Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied.

4388. Thus, basis, essence, flower-tantra: shown individually even.

4389. Only a matter of reversal distinction; one essential nature.

4390. How these three tantras proceed:

4391. As for what is shown as the basis-tantra regarding reality's actual state:

4392. Buddha and all sentient beings arise from that—so the outer tantra or the basis-tantra is established.
