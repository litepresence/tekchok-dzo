[2381] Kabhisha is so called, for he wishes that neither special meaning nor common meaning exists.
[2382] Sindha is so called,
[2383] For he holds that while common meaning does not exist, special meaning does exist.
[2384] Dhasimba is so called,
[2385] For he wishes that no meaning whatsoever exists.
[2386] Katipa is so called,
[2387] For he wishes that meaning exists, yet holds it is cut off until the breath ceases.
[2388] Sangha is so called—there are also those who claim that since I have entered the features of the saṅgha, it is sufficient.
[2389] Shamkari is so called,
[2390] For he holds compounded things to be impermanent and true.
[2391] The truth of compounded impermanence
[2392] Is the truth of life-force or supreme lord.
[2393] Doshaka is so called,
[2394] For all sūtras are gathered into life-force and supreme power.
[2395] There are also those who declare that life-force and supreme power definitely exist upon the summit of Mount Meru.
[2396] Thus the numberless views of aggregates are gathered into two categories.
[2397] These are permanence and interruption.
[2398] From these, the numberless views of aggregates spread forth, it is said.
[2399] Thus all teachings are gathered into four:
[2400] Extreme view,
[2401] Extreme end,
[2402] Distant benefit,
[2403] And indifference.
[2404] Extreme view refers to those who speak of eternal permanence.
[2405] Extreme end refers to those who declare permanent is permanent and impermanent is impermanent—both.
[2406] Distant benefit refers to those who hold half permanent, half interrupted.
[2407] Indifference refers to those who speak of complete severance.
[2408] These themselves are also gathered into permanence and interruption.
[2409] From the former, those wrong views
[2410] Are taught as gathered into four types.
[2411] Extreme view, extreme end,
[2412] Distant benefit, and indifference.
[2413] Thus the explanation is as follows:
[2414] Extreme view is eternal permanence.
[2415] Extreme end is half permanent, half cut.
[2416] Indifference is cut, completely cut.
[2417] Distant benefit is effect cut.
[2418] Thus the three hundred sixty
[2419] Are gathered into four types.
[2420] These are also gathered into permanence and interruption,
[2421] Thus it is said.
[2422] The purpose of teaching these
[2423] Is that one does not enter wrong paths through recognition.
[2424] From those same teachings.
