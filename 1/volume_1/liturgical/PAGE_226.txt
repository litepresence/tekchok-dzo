Its internal: seeking increasingly high thought-free path,
Establishing base in nirvāṇa's ground through not returning —
Through saying three times, non-dual three bodies' ground without separation — three, making six.

Its secret: through lama arising, obtaining confidence that appearance-existence arises as dharmatā;
Through saying "A A," seeking crucial point of unborn birthlessness;
Through placing finger on eye, clarifying path of arising awareness — nine.

Its complete: through saying "vast sky," familiarizing with expanse;
Through smearing hand on sky, mixing sign-meaning with experience;
"If going, is there a going-place?
If staying, is there a staying-place?
Is there again a going-place and returning-place?" — detailed setting — five, making fourteen.

Thoroughly unelaborated's elaborated external: through asking "who is it," indicating family,
Through mind-child answering, entering path closely — two;
Its internal: through dharmakāya posture seeking base,
Through saṃbhogakāya posture clarifying path,
Through nirmāṇakāya posture arousing depth — three;
Its secret: according with crucial point through common postures;
Through "E ma" etc., entering dharmakāya maṇḍala — body's crucial point;
Entering saṃbhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya maṇḍalas — according with body crucial point — seven, making nine.

Its secret: entering nirmāṇakāya's field — thirteen;
Its complete: entering saṃbhogakāya's field — five, making eighteen.
