[6900] Dharma for master and student to contemplate in common,
[6901] The manner of relying and making supplication,
[6902] The result of definite purpose.
[6903] First:
[6904] That master, seeing that student with steady compassion, timely benefit, care, Dharma,
[6905] Even merely with food and drink giving benefit,
[6906] That student, contemplating that guru's qualities, making continuous longing devotion.
[6907] From the Rangshar:
[6908] "Compassion's connection rope, not cut—how?
[6909] Longing, continuous,
[6910] Is the connection of guru and student."
[6911] Thus it is spoken.
[6912] Second:
[6913] From the Thalgyur:
[6914] "To complete characteristics of each,
[6915] Kingdom and own body,
[6916] By retinue and possessions serve,
[6917] By pleasing body, speech, and conduct,
[6918] Rely on guru and Buddha equal in union;
[6919] Possessing faith and wisdom,
[6920] Faithful and without delusion,
[6921] Without error in expressed objects,
[6922] By clear faculties, rely on guru."
[6923] Thus it is spoken.
[6924] That student,
[6925] Possessing aspiration for empowerment of elaborations, etc., and
[6926] To request instructions, is not entering suddenly;
[6927] Even for common invitation, a former message must be sent.
[6929] Therefore, from former times of five, seven, or three years, offering maṇḍalas of accumulations, gold, etc., to the guru, when self is this age,
[6930] "This empowerment," or
[6931] "This instruction," requesting permission by asking, supplicating again and again,
[6932] At the beginning of one's own virtue-practice session, contemplating that guru's yoga day and night, six times, should make supplication.
[6933] The guru also: "Son, if you ask for empowerment, for removing obstacles and purifying sins in that interval, contemplating the guru on the crown, day and night, six times, obtain supplication"—giving permission, causes to make supplication.
[6934] That purpose: ripening the body into deity-kāya, and
