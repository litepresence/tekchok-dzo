[3510] Beyond view-meditation of limit-free emptiness, wisdom arises;
[3511] Realizing all dharmas as equal in pleasure-pain—
[3512] Called sphere and wisdom transcending Dharma-nature action.
[3513] These: wisdom gradually entering sphere,
[3514] Dwelling,
[3515] Empty,
[3516] Understanding bliss-capture-entry—
[3517] Called union without accepting or abandoning, without superior-inferior.
[3518] Wisdom suddenly entering sphere, understanding view free from spontaneously arising Dharma-nature—dharmas exhausted, liberation without cause—called sudden.
[3519] Entering liberated-manner, understanding all-is, yet nothing-is—not abandoning all,
[3520] Nothing to obtain—called liberated-manner.
[3521] Entering breakthrough, through seeing-appearance and liberation, action and effort not needed for liberation—
[3522] Called Anu-yoga, Dharma-nature seeing arising breakthrough.
[3523] That: sphere and wisdom non-different, thus view of non-dual equal-purity;
[3524] Without going-coming in sphere and wisdom.
