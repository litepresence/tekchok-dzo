[3087] From the Ratnakuta Sutra:
[3088] The Tathagatas are permanent dharmas without birth.
[3089] All dharmas are like the Sugatas.
[3090] Since childish intellect grasps at signs,
[3091] One engages in the dharma that does not exist within the world.
[3092] Thus.
[3093] From the Root Wisdom:
[3094] Whatever depends and connects,
[3095] Through non-cessation, there is no birth.
[3096] Through non-annihilation, there is no permanence.
[3097] Through non-coming, there is no going.
[3098] Not different meaning, not single meaning.
[3099] Showing the cessation of elaboration, peace.
[3100] The perfect Buddhas speak.
[3101] Homage to that supreme one.
[3102] Thus.
[3103] From the Refutation of Refutations:
[3104] If I were to assert something exists,
[3105] Then I would have this fault.
[3106] Since I assert nothing,
[3107] I am only without faults.
[3108] Thus.
[3109] Since there is nothing to refute,
[3110] I refute nothing.
[3111] Therefore, it is said that one refutes.
[3112] You have imposed that imputation.
[3113] Thus.
[3114] And this also, since no view is established by intellect, one wishes for the cessation of elaboration.
[3115] Although placed as various mere appearances in the branch of conventional symbol-knowledge as worldly convention,
[3116] This also is not asserted.
[3117] One wishes to be free from the extremes of existence and non-existence and from the present time, beyond true and false appearance of dharma.
[3118] This is the summit of the established views of the Buddhas who assert suchness.
[3119] This great treatise is the six collections of middle-way reasoning.
[3120] The Root Wisdom.
[3121] The Sixty.
[3122] The Seventy on Emptiness.
[3123] The Fine Analysis.
[3124] The Refutation.
[3125] The Conventional Establishment.
[3126] Also this, from the speech of the noble Nagarjuna:
[3127] Composed the collection of words on the explanation of the first teaching, the dharma-wheel of the four truths.
[3128] Composed the collection of reasoning on the explanation of the dharma-wheel of the middle, characteristic-less dharmas.
[3129] Composed the collection of praise on the explanation of the dharma-wheel of the ultimate, distinguished dharmas.
[3130] Therefore, this master turns the dharma-wheel with the second Buddha.
