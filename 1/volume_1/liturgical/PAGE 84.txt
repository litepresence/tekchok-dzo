[3087] From the Ratnakūṭa Sūtra:

[3088] The Thus-Gone, permanent, birthless dharma,

[3089] All dharmas like the Sugata,

[3090] Childish intellect holders of signs,

[3091] In the world engage non-existing dharmas.

[3092] Thus it is said.

[3093] From the Root of Wisdom:

[3094] Whatever depends on conditions arises,

[3095] Without cessation, birthless,

[3096] Without annihilation, not permanent,

[3097] Without coming, without going,

[3098] Not different meaning, not one meaning,

[3099] Proliferation ceases, peace shown,

[3100] Perfect Buddhas who speak,

[3101] To that supreme, homage.

[3102] Thus it is said.

[3103] From the Vigrahavyāvartanī:

[3104] If I had any assertion,

[3105] Then this fault would exist in me,

[3106] Since I have no assertion,

[3107] I am entirely without fault.

[3108] Thus it is said.

[3109] Since there is nothing to be refuted,

[3110] I do not refute anything,

[3111] Therefore, when I say "I refute,"

[3112] That imputation is yours.

[3113] Thus.

[3114] That also: intellect-conceived established view none, proliferation pacified,

[3115] Various appear only, worldly convention symbol-knowing branch placed,

[3116] That also claim not,

[3117] Dharma appear true false beyond, exist not extreme and now time from free.

[3118] This Buddha established view speak summit is.

[3119] This treatise great middle-way reasoning collection six:

[3120] Root Wisdom,

[3121] Sixty Reasonings,

[3122] Seventy Emptinesses,

[3123] Fine Analysis,

[3124] Refutation,

[3125] Conventional Establishment.

[3126] That also Noble Nāgārjuna-by:

[3127] First teaching four truths dharma wheel explanation stories composed.

[3128] Middle characteristics not dharma wheel explanation reasoning composed.

[3129] Last ultimate distinguish dharma wheel explanation praise composed.

[3130] Therefore master this Buddha second-by dharma wheel turned.
