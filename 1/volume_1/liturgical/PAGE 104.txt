[3838] Space free from action: through non-doing, liberated into dharmatā of self-liberation—

[3839] Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation.

[3840] Thus it is said.

[3841] Space of ornament:

[3842] Appearance is mind's continuity,

[3843] Ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty, called.

[3844] Furthermore:

[3845] Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived.

[3846] Thus it is said.

[3847] Space of play:

[3848] Play without direction, unceasing, arises,

[3849] Transformation of appearance-mind does not occur, thus called.

[3850] Furthermore:

[3851] For liberating all into the completely pure path.

[3852] Thus it is said.

[3853] Space of dharmatā:

[3854] Abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not,

[3855] Basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing-knowing non-dual.

[3856] Furthermore:

[3857] Peak of emptiness, completely good, beyond.

[3858] Thus it is said.

[3859] Section distinguishing threefold teaching, supreme complete teaching of the path with distinctive feature:

[3860] Path's essential point—entering essence's essential point, like spark striking flint.

[3861] This divided into three:

[3862] Taught in oral transmission manner,

[3863] Taught in symbolic instruction manner,

[3864] Taught in self-arisen tantric scripture manner.

[3865] Among these, oral transmission's essence:

[3866] Path of action, beyond intellect, practiced.

[3867] Division:

[3868] Instruction of path cutting extremes of fixation,

[3869] Two instructions of path manifesting liberation's confidence and means' purity.

[3870] First:

[3871] At time of all-pervasive emptiness, path of everything rolling, not relying, time of distinguishing from basis,

[3872] Even mere word of elaboration not established,

[3873] Designation's elaboration does not exist,

[3874] In dharmatā beyond expression, no letter, thus called.

[3875] Through actionlessness reasoning, cyclic existence analysis exhausted,

[3876] Cessation's ultimate meaning.

[3877] Second:

[3878] From dharmatā abiding aspect, transformation in mind does not occur,

[3879] At time of three kāyas appearing on path,

[3880] Whatever not liberated does not exist,

[3881] At result arising in essential point, dharmatā desired to be met without separation.

[3882] Symbolic instruction's essence: non-deluded, thought-free.
