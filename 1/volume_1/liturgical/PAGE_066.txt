[2316] [2316] Those who aspire to abide upon the path, regarding conduct as permanent,
[2317] [2317] Yet perceiving cause and effect as impermanent—
[2318] [2318] Such practitioners, through taking conduct as permanent, seek liberation thereby.
[2319] [2319] Objects, dwellings, and households they hold as eternal,
[2320] [2320] And all appearances whatsoever they view as permanent.
[2321] [2321] Those who view permanence where it does not exist are nihilists in essence,
[2322] [2322] For viewing what is permanent as cut off constitutes the nihilistic view.
[2323] [2323] Upon this very ground they enact the tenet of permanence.
[2324] [2324] Those who wield evil mantras as paramount, performing fierce destructive rites,
[2325] [2325] Speaking with the single-pointed resolve of black practitioners,
[2326] [2326] Attached thereto, desiring results through such means.
[2327] [2327] Those who take divination and prophecy as paramount,
[2328] [2328] Caring solely for the happiness of this world,
[2329] [2329] Declaring future lives utterly nonexistent.
[2330] [2330] Those who take subtle miracles as paramount,
[2331] [2331] Turning back armies in this world through magical power,
[2332] [2332] In future lives too, wishing to subdue others through magic, seeking rebirth in the retinue of lords or powerful deities.
[2333] [2333] Those whose view prioritizes debate,
[2334] [2334] Internalizing their own truth while refuting others, harboring such hopes.
[2335] [2335] Those who harbor hopes in mistaken ascetic practices.
[2336] [2336] Those attached to this world,
[2337] [2337] Called "worldly benefit," engaging in the affairs of this world.
[2338] [2338] Also, some internalize their own truth while pridefully destroying others' standing.
[2339] [2339] Some seek meaning through mere custom.
[2340] [2340] Some, having made matted locks of hair, seek meaning thereby.
[2341] [2341] Some, wrapping their bodies alternately in single cloths, declare "inner heat has arisen."
[2342] [2342] Some, holding khaṭvāṅga and ḍamaru as hand-attributes, declare "I am the emanation body."
[2343] [2343] Some say "Whatever virtue you perform benefits me," depending upon that meaning.
[2344] [2344] Some, by their own reasoning refuting others' reasoning, declare "This is my action," depending upon that meaning.
[2345] [2345] Some declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut.
[2346] [2346] Some declare that sudden cut renders even their own bodies empty.
[2347] [2347] Some declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut.
[2348] [2348] Some declare that sudden cut renders even their own bodies empty.
[2349] [2349] Cause severed, effect severed.
