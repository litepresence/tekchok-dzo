[4358] clear three etc body three path-appearance's phenomena completion reached ones are/
[4359] knowledge directionless by clear because emptiness cut-off not/
[4360] entity markless because clear classification not/
[4361] self-aware meaning ultimate is that-three inseparable/
[4362] permanent-impermanent four extremes from liberated body and wisdom inseparable's intention called/
[4363] that-to clear three are/
[4364] external object appearing time/
[4365] awareness from appearance-to clear dimension from color-into clear/
[4366] space-in dimension awareness inseparable-without clear is/
[4367] inner three are/
[4368] thus arisen self-confidence like appearance's inner/
[4369] nose-held object appearance's inner/
[4370] confusion ceased decisive cutoff's inner/
[4371] non-returning three are/
[4372] that-time samsara itself primordial-from awakened-from/
[4373] awareness-without continuity because non-returning/
[4374] awareness's body manifest appearing-by confused-appearance pure-appeared into transformed because appearance non-returning/
[4375] dharmatā that manifold appearing because/
[4376] that-to understanding's certainty attained that non-returning is/
[4377] appearing three are/
[4378] dimension-without day-night without appearing/
[4379] awareness-without clear-diminished without appearing/
[4380] dharmatā-without change-without appearing is/
[4381] thus liberated confused's appearing self-purified because samsara's cause not/
[4382] that very pure appearing self-arisen because samsara's conditions self-ceased/
[4383] here offering also dharmatā intermediate's appearing cut-because samsara's result self-fell is/
[4384] emptiness three this time/
[4385] awareness-without recitation because confused exhausted/
[4386] mind-without condition because conceptual thought's defilement exhausted/
[4387] light-without coming-going because arisen's condition empty is/
[4388] thus ground and essence flower's lineage respectively shown even/
[4389] reversed distinction merely from essence one is/
[4390] these three lineage-by go-if/
[4391] entity's nature-to ground's lineage-to shown is/
[4392] buddha beings all that-from arisen because outer's lineage called or ground's lineage called appropriate is/
