[1792] These delusion-appearance cleared when,

[1793] Stainless luminosity manifest became called.

[1794] Now these action and kleśas produced self-nature action and kleśas itself's face supporting abide,

[1795] That also incorrect conceptions consciousness groups six or seven ālaya with supporting that itself self-arisen wisdom mind's thusness self-nature completely-pure in abide,

[1796] That whatever not-abiding thus self-arisen wisdom called,

[1797] Uttara-tantra from:

[1798] Earth water wind in,

[1799] Wind space excellently abides.

[1800] Space wind and water and
