[3915] By-means-of essence being without dharma, even the name of buddha is not.

[3916] By-means-of self-nature radiating as energy, the arising-and-dissolving of samsara-and-nirvana is made-to-appear.

[3917] By-means-of characteristic being not-established as one, in view-and-meditation there is no basis-for-measurement.

[3918] The second is:

[3919] By-means-of essence being unproduced and completely-purified, afflictions are self-liberated,
[3920] By-means-of self-nature being unceasing and pervasively-radiating, acceptance-and-rejection are not-at-all,
[3921] By-means-of characteristic being causeless and self-liberated, the path of samsara-and-nirvana is exhausted.

[3922] By-means-of the essence of the gtar-ka’s rays being clarified, the key-point of dharmatā is clarified,
[3923] At the boundary of samsara-and-nirvana:

[3924] By-means-of self-nature being unobstructed, the ground-of-the-basis is without the stain of the ignorant-mind,
[3925] By-means-of characteristic being causeless and the basis being pure, confusion is self-pacified.

[3926] When divided, there are two:

[3927] The rays of view-and-meditation’s heat-and-clarity,
[3928] The rays of the manner-of-abiding of phenomena.

[3929] The first is:

[3930] The heat of view is the relational-connection of samsara-and-nirvana,
[3931] That is also the dharmatā of the time-of-movement-of-view being settled-in as the non-dual equality of the moving-and-still.

[3932] At the time-of-attainment-of-view, heat arises in body-and-speech,
[3933] Like fire blazing in wood.

[3934] At the time-of-stability-of-view, the distinction of samsara-and-nirvana is:
[3935] Like an army conquering a fortress.

[3936] At the time-of-movement-of-meditation, the winds-and-mind are gathered,
[3937] Like gathering into the treasure-house of the body’s channels.

[3938] At the time-of-attainment-of-meditation, mind is gathered onto the path,
[3939] Like a wild yak being tamed.

[3940] At the time-of-stability-of-meditation, the strength of awareness is attained,
[3941] Like the royal lineage bestowing empowerment from the universal sovereign.

[3942] At the time-of-movement-of-conduct, the latent tendencies of confusion radiate,
[3943] Like a garuḍa soaring into space or a wild yak leaping into the sky.

[3944] At the time-of-attainment-of-conduct, the heat-and-clarity of the three kāyas is attained,
[3945] Like the absorption of Brahmā.

[3946] Furthermore, by-means-of conduct, appearance is purified, so the ground-of-appearance’s dharmatā is without path-of-effort.

[3947] By-means-of the movement-of-meditation’s rays being purified, the path-of-recollection-samādhi-absorption is without path-of-effort.

[3948] By-means-of the rays of view’s dharmatā being purified, the path-of-non-reliance-on-phenomena’s buddhahood is without path-of-effort.

[3949] By-means-of the manner-of-abiding-of-phenomena’s rays being purified, the essence of dharmatā is without fabrication—whatever appears, mind does not conceptualize.
