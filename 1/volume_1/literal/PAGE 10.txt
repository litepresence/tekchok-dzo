[299] By-means-of mudrā-of-vajra-bell’s holding and
[300] great-blaze’s equality and
[301] dharmatā’s all-encompassing and

[302] The samādhi called “self-illuminating naturally-arising adornment”:

[303] Those also are not the activity of an agent-of-meaning’s doing,
[304] but are called “activity” by-means-of the arising of the essence and radiance of qualities.

[305] From that, the complete-enjoyment-body’s self-arising:

[306] From the play of the radiance of the unobstructed manner of appearance and compassion’s arising,
[307] the pure abodes are adorned,
[308] the display of the teaching is made in the equal-expanse of the great ocean’s gesture—from the lotus’s pericarp at the tip of the thumb and the array of tiny protuberances, in the center of the thirty-two-fold realm-array, the fivefold buddha-families’ pure lands, with their varied colors and forms like water and moon,
[309] all arrays are infinitely vast and pervading,
[310] like the arrangement of the offering-feast’s descending sequence.

[311] The bodies of the five families’ buddhas are also innumerable in their all-encompassing variety,
[312] and in the maṇḍala of the lotus-throne’s boundless array of offering-clouds,
[313] the thirty-two buddha-realms are also not limited,
[314] like the infinite array of jewel-ornaments,
[315] and the descending sequence of mutual-offering’s accumulation is also innumerable, including the five families’ buddhas and so forth.

[316] Furthermore, from all the pores of the body’s hair emanate rays of light—within that expanse, the variety of realms and teachings is boundless, immeasurable, and incalculable.

[317] In that way, in the pure land of the enjoyment-body:

[318] The teachings—scripture and realization, self-arisen syllables—are not made, yet all teachings’ sons and the simultaneous appearance of those abiding are displayed,

[319] at the time of unchanging dharmatā.

[320] From the thirty-sixfold self-radiating activity of the enjoyment-body’s body, speech, and mind’s unceasing ornament-wheel’s activity,

[321] The four external activities of the body are:

[322] By-means-of the body’s appearance being self-natureless, the purification of all obscurations is accomplished.
