[LOGICAL ERROR] [EQUIVOCATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17784-17795: The text presents a debate about whether Buddha arises from mind, with opponents claiming "if no mind, how can Buddha be recognized?" and response that Buddha arises from "whether Dharmakaya wisdom exists or not." The logical structure might be misread as supporting ontological causation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The debate format uses conventional reasoning (rigs pa) and scriptural citations to refute positions. Without recognizing that all positions are ultimately empty, readers may latch onto the "correct" view as an ontological statement.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound meaning—that recognition of wisdom's presence is what matters, not mind's presence or absence—gets reduced to a metaphysical claim about what "causes" Buddhahood.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may fixate on "presence of wisdom" as a state to achieve, rather than understanding it as a way of pointing to what is always already the case but unrecognized.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBSTANTIALIST ERROR] where wisdom becomes a metaphysical ground, and [CAUSATION ERROR] where gradual purification is reified as actually producing enlightenment.

[TEXTUAL ERROR] [QUOTATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17786-17809: Multiple scriptural citations (Madhyamakavatara, Vajra Peak Tantra, Rigpa Rangshar Tantra) are presented as authoritative proofs. One might treat these as establishing dogmatic truths rather than skillful means.

WHY IT ARISES:
Traditional Buddhist study often emphasizes memorization and citation as marks of learning. Western academic approaches may see these as mere textual references without appreciating their function as pointers to direct recognition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pointing function of scripture is lost; citations become objects of faith or scholarly analysis rather than invitations to immediate recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Endless intellectual debate about "what the text really means" obscures the living transmission that the words are meant to evoke. Scriptural study becomes accumulation of information rather than dissolution of confusion.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCHOLASTICISM ERROR] where understanding concepts substitutes for recognition, and [FUNDAMENTALISM ERROR] where literal interpretation overrides direct experience.
