[INSTRUMENTAL ERROR] [SKILL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the statement that holders of this teaching know "craft and art all" and "treatise all" as establishing that worldly skills and intellectual accomplishments are direct fruits of the practice, conflating spiritual and worldly achievement.

WHY IT ARISES:
The listing of worldly accomplishments alongside spiritual benefits triggers the assumption that they are equivalent rewards. Cultural values around competence support this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching becomes a means to worldly success. Spiritual practice is instrumentalized for skill acquisition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pride in accomplishments replaces humility. The reader measures progress by external achievements.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching is reduced to a self-help methodology for success in various domains.

[LIGHT ERROR] [ILLUMINATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the repeated references to "light clear" and "lamp" as establishing a metaphysics of light where spiritual progress equals increasing illumination, leading to phototropism as spiritual practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The light metaphors are cognitively powerful and naturally trigger associations with clarity, goodness, and progress. The mind spontaneously creates a gradient from darkness to light.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes oriented toward "more light" rather than recognition of what is beyond light/dark duality. States of clarity are pursued as goals.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Darkness, confusion, and unknowing are rejected rather than recognized as equal displays. Spiritual materialism develops around "light experiences."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Tögal practice degenerates into light-chasing. The nature of light itself is never questioned.

[HISTORICAL ERROR] [LINEAGE OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes absorbed in tracking the sequence of buddhas and aeons as historical fact, treating the lineage as an object of historical knowledge rather than a present dimension of transmission.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numbered lists and proper names naturally invite historical reconstruction. The mind habitually processes genealogies as chronological facts.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The lineage is objectified as past history rather than recognized as present potency. The reader becomes a historian rather than a practitioner.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Debates about historical accuracy replace practice. The transformative function is lost in scholarly disputes.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about direct transmission are approached historically rather than existentially.
