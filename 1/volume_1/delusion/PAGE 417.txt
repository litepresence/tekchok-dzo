[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Taking "bde gshegs snying po" (sugatagarbha/Buddha nature) as an actual presence or seed of Buddhahood within sentient beings.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Garbha" (womb/essence) suggests containment. Students imagine a Buddha-nugget inside them.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The empty nature of Buddha nature is reified into an inner possession. Students try to access their inner Buddha.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes excavation of inner treasure. The ever-present nature is obscured by seeking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC view of inherent Buddha, then to MEDITATIONISM of inner search, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL possession-model of enlightenment.

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "stobs" (power/force) in the context of Buddha qualities as referring to actual powers or abilities that Buddhas possess.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Power" suggests capacity and ability. Students assume this means supernormal powers.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The effortless nature of spontaneous accomplishment is reified into possession of powers. Students seek special abilities.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes power-seeking. The recognition that power is empty display is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of siddhis, then to MEDITATIONISM of power cultivation, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of Buddha powers.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "sbyong ba" (purification/cleansing) as a process of removing defilements through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Purification" suggests cleaning process. Students assume they must cleanse their minds.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural purity is replaced by purification efforts. Students believe they are dirty and must be cleaned.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes self-improvement project. Self-aggression develops as students fight their defilements.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of purification, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of pure vs. impure, and finally to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as self-criticism.

Lines 00046-00058
[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "dri ma" (stain/defilement) as actual entities or substances that contaminate the mind.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Stain" suggests something real that dirties. Students assume defilements have real existence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The adventitious nature of defilements is missed. Students believe in real obstacles to remove.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes stain-removal project. The recognition that defilements have no inherent existence is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ONTOLOGICAL substantialism of defilements, then to MEDITATIONISM of purification, and finally to NIHILISTIC rejection of defilements as real.
