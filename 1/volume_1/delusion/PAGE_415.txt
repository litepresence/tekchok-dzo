[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "'od" (light) in the context of light-mandala as referring to physical light or photons that constitute a divine body.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Light" naturally suggests physical illumination. Students assume this means bodies made of light-energy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The clarity aspect of awareness is materialized into light substance. The metaphor becomes literal physics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students speculate about light-bodies and energy transformations. The recognition of clarity aspect is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ONTOLOGICAL materialism, then to MEDITATIONISM of light visualization, and finally to SCHOLARLY physics-mysticism.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding the threefold division of ground, path, and fruit as temporal stages describing the career of a practitioner.

WHY IT ARISES:
The three terms suggest a narrative: starting point, process, and conclusion. Students project biographical structure.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The simultaneous presence of all three is missed. Practice becomes journey narrative.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students see themselves as travelers on a path. The ever-present nature is obscured by temporal thinking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL narrative structure, then to MEDITATIONISM of stage progression, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL temporal dualism.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "sgom pa" (meditation) as deliberate practice sessions distinct from daily life.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Meditation" commonly refers to formal sitting practice. Students assume this means special sessions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Continuous natural meditation is replaced by session-based practice. Life is divided into practice and non-practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students compartmentalize their lives. Integration is never achieved.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of session fixation, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of practice vs. life, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through compartmentalization.

[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "ye nas" (from the beginning/primordially) to mean that enlightenment exists eternally and only needs to be discovered like a buried treasure.

WHY IT ARISES:
"From the beginning" suggests pre-existence. Students assume their nature is waiting to be found.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ever-fresh immediacy of recognition is replaced by seeking something pre-existent. Students search for their "true nature."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes archaeological excavation. The present moment is devalued as not yet the discovered treasure.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC view of pre-existent nature, then to MEDITATIONISM of searching, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of seeker and sought.
