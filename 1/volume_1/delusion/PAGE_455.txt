[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The three fruition-maturing bindus—light-maturing, wisdom-maturing, awareness-maturing—are interpreted as progressive stages of thodgal attainment that the practitioner advances through sequentially via repeated practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Threefold division triggers developmental reading. "Maturing" (*སྨིན་པ་) suggests process. Western goal-oriented spirituality interprets this as achievement ladder.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes three-stage path. Practitioners work to "mature" each bindu sequentially. The instantaneous recognition of Dzogchen is replaced by progressive maturation project.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Upright bindu" (*གྱེན་འགྲེང་གི་ཐིག་ལེ་) becomes stage to achieve. "Wings/side-appearance" (*རྩིབས་ལ་གནས་) is advanced stage. Rainbow-like appearance becomes goal. Natural display is forced into developmental framework.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where advanced visions become attainments. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as three-stage curriculum is institutionalized. [VIEW COLLAPSE] occurs when Atiyoga becomes gradual path.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed visionary appearances—spear-points, three-pointed weapons, stacked reliquaries, lotuses—are interpreted as literal forms that actually manifest in thodgal practice and indicate progress levels.

WHY IT ARISES:
Concrete imagery triggers literal reading. "Seeing" (*མཐོང་) suggests visual perception. Western visualization traditions interpret these as actual experiences to be had.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes vision-achievement practice. Specific forms become progress markers. The non-dual recognition is lost in fixation on having particular visionary content.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Spear-point-like" (*མདུང་རྩེའི་རྣམ་པ་) becomes target vision. "Stupa stack" is advanced sign. "Thousand-petaled lotus" is high attainment. Natural self-display is replaced by checklist spirituality.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR]—deliberately seeking specific visions. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] follows as visions are grasped as attainments. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as vision-catalogues are taught.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "awareness-maturing bindu" with its visionary content—half-kāyas, solitary heroes, yab-yum, five families, clusters, great clusters—is interpreted as literal deities and forms that actually exist and appear to advanced practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
Deity imagery (*སྐུ་, *ཡབ་ཡུམ་, *རིགས་ལྔ་) triggers reification. "Seeing" suggests visual encounter. Western theistic frameworks interpret these as actual divine beings.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes visionary theophany. Specific deity-forms are sought as signs of realization. The formless dharmakāya is obscured by fascination with form-display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Great pure appearance" (*དག་པ་ཆེན་པོའི་སྣང་བ་) becomes specific vision. "Five family maṇḍalas" are treated as actual cosmic structures. The spontaneous display is replaced by deliberate theophany-seeking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] where deities are taken as truly existent. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as thodgal becomes deity-yoga. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] proliferates when compared to other visionary traditions.
