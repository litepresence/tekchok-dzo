[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ELEMENTAL HYLOMORPHISM]

MISREADING:
The four elements ('byung bzhi) literally assemble like building blocks to construct the embryo.

WHY IT ARISES:
Terms like 'gather' (sdud), 'expand' (mched), 'blaze' ('bar) suggest elemental construction process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing embryogenesis as material assembly of earth, water, fire, and wind particles.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the primordial purity (ka dag) of elements from the beginning.
Confusing conventional manifestation with ultimate nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SUBSTANTIALIST ERROR]

---

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYLLABLE ESSENTIALISM]

MISREADING:
Seed syllables (yi ge) have inherent creative power as causal agents.

WHY IT ARISES:
Text describes syllables arising (byung), gathering ('dus), and expanding (mched) like active forces.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Attributing inherent existence to symbolic representations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reifying sound and letter as independently existent creative principles.
Missing that syllables are self-arisen (rang byung) manifestations of awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MANTRA MATERIALISM ERROR]

---

[NUMERICAL LITERALISM] [ENUMERATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Numerical counts of bugs/worms (srin bu), channels (rtsa), and syllables are exact quantitative descriptions.

WHY IT ARISES:
Specific numbers (eighty-five thousand, etc.) appear throughout the text.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Attempting precise mathematical accounting of subtle body components.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that numbers indicate completeness and interdependence, not inventory.
Quantifying the unquantifiable nature of awareness-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
