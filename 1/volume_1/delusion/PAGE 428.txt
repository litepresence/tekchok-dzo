[CALCULATION ERROR] [QUANTIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18033-18112: The detailed numerical breakdown (25 afflictions from 5 poisons × 5 each; 51 as 25 × 2 + 1; 84,000 as calculation of combinations) suggests mathematical precision about psychological reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic multiplication (5 × 5 = 25, etc.) resembles mathematical or logical derivation. Precision implies accuracy; the calculations appear rigorously derived.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The conventional, pedagogical nature of these numbers is missed. What are skillful means for illustrating the profusion of afflictions become ontological claims about their actual number.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may try to identify and count their own afflictions according to these schemes, creating new conceptual activity rather than recognizing the root of confusion.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [OBSESSIVE ANALYSIS ERROR] where practitioners catalog their experience, and [COMPLETIONISM ERROR] where the goal becomes addressing all 84,000 rather than recognizing the single source.

[CAUSAL ERROR] [GENERATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18100-18112: The text states that afflictions "are produced by mind, mentation, memory, habitual patterns, and doubt." This might be read as a causal explanation of how afflictions arise.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of production (bskyed cing) and arising (kun nas ldang ba) naturally suggests causation. We habitually look for mechanisms and explanations.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The co-emergent, non-temporal nature of ground and display is obscured. What is actually a timeless confusion appears as a causal process that could be intervened in.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to "cut off" the causes of affliction (stop doubt, eliminate memory, etc.) rather than recognizing that the entire structure of explanation is provisional.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [INTERVENTION ERROR] where practice becomes strategic manipulation of mental factors, and [CAUSAL THINKING ERROR] where dependent origination is temporalized.
