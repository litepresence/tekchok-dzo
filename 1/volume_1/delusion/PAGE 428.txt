[CALCULATION ERROR] [QUANTIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18033-18112 present detailed numerical breakdown: twenty-five afflictions derived from five poisons multiplied by five each; fifty-one as twenty-five multiplied by two plus one (root non-awareness); 84,000 calculated from combinations of the poisons (21,000 from each). The mathematical precision suggests these are empirically accurate counts of actually existing psychological entities.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic multiplication (5 × 5 = 25, etc.) and addition (25 × 2 + 1 = 51) resembles mathematical or logical derivation. Precision implies accuracy; calculations appear rigorously derived. Scientific training validates numerical precision. The derivation process suggests systematic knowledge rather than approximation. The comprehensiveness of the calculation invites acceptance as factual.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The conventional, pedagogical nature of these numbers is completely missed. What are skillful means for illustrating the profusion of afflictions and the complexity of mental life become ontological claims about their actual number. The understanding that "84,000" is symbolic, meaning "countless," is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to identify, count, and catalog their own afflictions according to these precise schemes. They may create elaborate charts mapping their 25 or 51 or 84,000 afflictions. New conceptual activity replaces recognition. The elegant simplicity of seeing through all affliction is lost in complexity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [OBSESSIVE ANALYSIS ERROR] where practitioners catalog experience, [COMPLETIONISM ERROR] where goal becomes addressing all 84,000, [COUNTING ERROR] where afflictions are enumerated, [MAPPING ERROR] where charts replace practice, and [MATHEMATICAL ERROR] where precision is valued over recognition. Also activates [EXHAUSTION ERROR] where task appears endless.

[CAUSAL ERROR] [GENERATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18100-18112 state that afflictions "are produced by mind, mentation, memory, habitual patterns, and doubt" and describe how "these all also mind and intellect and recollection and latency and doubt through of produce." The production language is read as describing actual causal generation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of production (bskyed cing), arising (kun nas ldang ba), and dependence (through of) naturally suggests causation. Buddhist teachings on dependent origination train us to accept such descriptions as real mechanisms. We habitually look for causes and explanations. The detailed correspondence between factors suggests systematic causality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The co-emergent, non-temporal nature of ground and display is completely obscured. What is actually a timeless confusion without beginning appears as a causal process occurring in time. The understanding that "production" is pedagogical description, not ontological claim, is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to "cut off" causes of affliction—stop doubt, eliminate memory, suppress mentation—believing this will prevent affliction. Strategic manipulation replaces recognition. The entire provisional structure of explanation is taken as reality to be intervened in.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [INTERVENTION ERROR] where practice becomes manipulation, [CAUSAL THINKING ERROR] where dependent origination is temporalized, [STRATEGY ERROR] where causes are targeted, [SUPPRESSION ERROR] where factors are eliminated, and [MECHANISM ERROR] where understanding replaces recognition. Also activates [CONTROL ERROR] where causes are managed.

[SUBDIVISION ERROR] [FIVEFOLD ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18056-18080 present each of the five poisons subdivided into five: delusion (very-dull, not-know, not-see, very-dark, very-intoxicate), desire (face-desire, very-torment, life-not-care, anger-possessing, space-move), anger (desire-much, rage-possessing, very-coarse, delusion-possessing, time-thunder-rain), pride (suppress-lion, above-nonexistent-space, brave-tiger, I-am-vulture, unequal-equal-elephant), jealousy (subtle, I-from-arise, very-harsh, coarse, view). The subdivisions are understood as describing actual distinct types.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic fivefold subdivision suggests comprehensive classification. The specific names appear to capture real phenomenological differences. The structure (5 poisons × 5 each = 25) implies completeness. The vivid imagery (lion, tiger, vulture, elephant) makes types memorable and seemingly real.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The twenty-five afflictions become reified as actually distinct entities. What are pedagogical tools for recognizing patterns become ontological categories. The understanding that all are equally empty, equally aspects of non-recognition, is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may identify with specific subtypes ("I have suppress-lion pride") or try to cultivate certain types. Cataloging and typing replaces recognition. Teachers may assess students by subtype. The emptiness of all distinctions is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBTYPING ERROR] where distinctions are grasped, [IDENTIFICATION ERROR] where types become identity, [CULTIVATION ERROR] where types are sought, [ASSESSMENT ERROR] where subtypes determine approach, and [DISTINCTION ERROR] where differences are emphasized over common nature. Also activates [PRECISION ERROR] where detail is valued.

[PROLIFERATION ERROR] [EIGHTYFOUR ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18090-18096 calculate 84,000 afflictions: "Desire from become twenty-one thousand, anger from become twenty-one thousand, delusion from become twenty-one thousand, part equal from become twenty-one thousand, sum thousand eight and four." The reader understands this as an actual count of afflictions that exist.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific calculation (21,000 × 4 = 84,000) suggests mathematical precision. The breakdown by poison implies systematic coverage. Buddhist tradition widely references "84,000 afflictions" giving it authority. The number appears in many sources as definitive.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic nature of "84,000" is completely missed. What traditionally means "innumerable," "countless," or "complete" becomes a literal quantity. The understanding that no such count is possible or meaningful is lost. Afflictions are objectified as actually existing in this number.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may feel overwhelmed by the specific quantity or pride themselves on understanding the calculation. They may attempt to map their experience onto the 84,000. The impossibility of actually identifying 84,000 distinct afflictions creates either despair or dismissal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LITERALISM ERROR] where symbolic numbers are taken literally, [OVERWHELM ERROR] where quantity appears impossible, [CALCULATION PRIDE] where understanding math is valued, [IMPOSSIBILITY ERROR] where task is abandoned, and [SYMBOL ERROR] where meaning is lost in number. Also activates [QUANTIFICATION ERROR] where counting replaces recognition.

[CONSCIOUSNESS ERROR] [AGGREGATE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18112-18128 describe "consciousness group eight" and "three-realm mind and mental-factors fifty-one all abandon object superimposition only." The eight consciousnesses (all-base, five sense, mental, afflicted mentation) are understood as actually existing components of mind.

WHY IT ARISES:
The Yogacara framework of eight consciousnesses is presented authoritatively. Western cognitive science trains us to think in terms of systems and modules. The systematic enumeration suggests comprehensive structural knowledge. The phrase "group eight" implies distinct entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The eight consciousnesses become reified as actual components or modules of mind. What is one analytical framework among many becomes "how mind actually works." The understanding that all such frameworks are provisional, pedagogical tools is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to work with specific consciousnesses—"purifying the all-base," "clarifying the mental consciousness," etc. They may study the eight consciousnesses extensively. The recognition that the entire schema dissolves in rigpa is obscured by engagement with the system.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [COMPONENT ERROR] where mind is analyzed, [SYSTEM ERROR] where framework becomes reality, [MODULE ERROR] where consciousnesses are worked with separately, [PURIFICATION ERROR] where components are cleaned, and [STRUCTURALISM ERROR] where structure is valued over recognition. Also activates [ABHIDHARMA ERROR] where analytical knowledge substitutes.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 428 completes the detailed enumeration of the twenty-five and fifty-one afflictions with the mathematical derivation of 84,000. The quantitative precision throughout invites literal interpretation. The subdivision of poisons into five each maintains the systematic approach. Page 429 will transition to discussing the consciousness system and its relationship to abandonment, introducing systemic and soteriological errors. The causal language of "production" and "arising" throughout these pages must be recognized as pedagogical. The eight-consciousness framework will be elaborated further, requiring consistent recognition of its analytical nature. The numerical specificity on this page (25, 51, 84,000) is particularly likely to be taken literally and must be understood as symbolic throughout the text. The transition from affliction-enumeration to consciousness-structure in page 430 maintains the systematic approach that risks reification.
