[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [MOXIBUSTION POINT SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
Moxibustion points (bsreg sa) are actual locations that must be burned to produce specific effects on specific diseases.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14474-14484: Extensive list of points to burn for specific conditions: "ti Ti gnyis ni dpyi mgo...bsregs pas mkhal ma'i nad la phan" (ti Ti two at shoulder-top...burning benefits kidney disease).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing moxibustion as mechanical intervention.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Searching for exact burn locations.
Missing that healing is recognition, not thermal manipulation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[THERMAL MATERIALISM ERROR]

[PRACTICE ERROR] [BREATH MANIPULATION TECHNOLOGY]

MISREADING:
Breath manipulation (dbugs dang bcas te) combined with mantra recitation is a technique that mechanically draws energy into the body.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14484-14497: "dbugs dang bcas te phyi nas nang du drang...lte ba dag ni yi ges khengs pa na" (with breath draw from outside to inside...when navel is filled with letters).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing prana/breath as substance to be manipulated.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Forceful breathing practices.
Missing that breath is awareness in motion, not energy to control.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRANIC OBSESSION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [LETTER-LOCATION CORRESPONDENCE MAPPING]

MISREADING:
Sanskrit letters (yi ge) actually reside at specific body locations and can be manipulated there.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14474-14503: Multiple letters assigned to specific body parts: "ti Ti...dpyi mgo/la lA...brla khung" (ti Ti...shoulder-top/la lA...thigh-joint).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing letters as entities occupying spatial locations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to "find" or "activate" letters in the body.
Missing that letters are wisdom-display, not resident entities.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SEED SYLLABLE SPATIALIZATION ERROR]
