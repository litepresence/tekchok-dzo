[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The channels and their functions are interpreted as actual subtle anatomy to be mastered rather than symbolic of cognitive processes to recognize.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical detail suggests physical reality. Technical terminology suggests specialized knowledge to acquire.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on recognizing mind's nature is replaced by subtle body mastery. The simplicity of recognition is lost in complexity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner becomes expert in subtle anatomy without recognition. The pointing to immediate experience is obscured by learning.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LEARNING ERROR] and [MASTERY ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Co-emergent ignorance" (lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig pa) is understood as original sin or inherent flaw rather than simultaneous arising with awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Ignorance" suggests deficiency. "Co-emergent" suggests paired existence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on the non-duality of awareness and its display is replaced by dualistic problem/solution framework. The simultaneity is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops guilt or sees ignorance as enemy. The recognition that ignorance and awareness share the same nature is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ORIGINAL SIN ERROR] and [DUALISTIC ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "wisdoms" (ye shes) are interpreted as actual knowledge to acquire or states to achieve rather than self-existing qualities of recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Wisdom" suggests knowledge. Enumeration suggests progressive attainment.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Self-existing qualities are replaced by achievements to accomplish. The immanence of wisdom is lost in teleological striving.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks to acquire wisdoms rather than recognizing their intrinsic presence. The "already accomplished" is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ACQUISITION ERROR] and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The stages of fetal development are interpreted as rigid developmental schema that must be traversed rather than symbolic of recognition's immediacy.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential stages suggest necessary progression. Developmental language suggests growth over time.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The instantaneous nature of recognition is replaced by gradual developmental model. The timeless is temporalized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner believes they must develop through stages. The recognition that transcends development is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GRADUALIST ERROR] and [TEMPORALIZATION ERROR].
