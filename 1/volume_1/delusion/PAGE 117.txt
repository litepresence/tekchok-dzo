[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Clear three etc body three" and "knowledge directionless by clear because emptiness cut-off not" establish clarity as an eternal, unchanging characteristic of body and wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumeration suggests fixed categories. The negation of cut-off implies permanence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Clarity is substantialized as permanent characteristic. The practitioner seeks to achieve or maintain this clarity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Clarity fixation. Aversion to obscuration. Light-chasing.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Clarity obsession → energetic imbalance → rejection of darkness → dissociation.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Clear three are" and "external object appearing time awareness from appearance-to clear dimension from color-into clear" describe a process where external objects are transformed into clear awareness through dimensional shift.

WHY IT ARISES:
The spatial language (dimension, color-into) suggests transformation. The enumeration implies stages.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Perception is understood as transformation process. The practitioner attempts to shift objects into clear dimension.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Transformation obsession. Dimensional fixation. Perceptual manipulation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Perceptual manipulation → hallucination → detachment from reality → psychosis.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Inner three are" and the description of "arisen self-confidence," "nose-held object," and "confusion ceased" present three internal stages or attainments to be achieved.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumeration suggests stages. The descriptive language implies achievements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Internal experience is categorized into three attainments. The practitioner progresses through inner stages.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Stage fixation. Internal navigation. Experience mapping.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Internal mapping → solipsism → disconnection → isolation.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"That-time samsara itself primordial-from awakened-from" and "awareness-without continuity because non-returning" establish a primordial awakening that exists prior to saṃsāra and continues without interruption.

WHY IT ARISES:
The temporal language (primordial-from) suggests pre-existence. The negation of returning implies eternal liberation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awakening is substantialized as eternal state. The practitioner seeks to access this primordial continuity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Primordial fixation. Eternal liberation grasping. Time-transcendence obsession.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Temporal obsession → dissociation from present → future/past escape → no grounding.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Appearing three are" and the descriptions of appearing (dimension-without, awareness-without, dharmatā-without) present three modes of pure appearing to be achieved.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumeration suggests types. The negations (without) imply transcendence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Appearing is categorized into three pure modes. The practitioner seeks dimension-without appearing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Mode fixation. Pure appearing chasing. Rejection of ordinary appearance.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Pure appearance obsession → aversion to ordinary life → withdrawal → quietism.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [NIHILISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Emptiness three this time" and the negations (awareness-without recitation, mind-without condition, light-without coming-going) establish emptiness as radical absence requiring no method or condition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The negations suggest dissolution. The "this time" implies immediacy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Emptiness is nihilistically interpreted as nothingness. The practitioner abandons all method.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Method rejection. Condition denial. Radical emptiness fixation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Nihilism → no practice → no ground → spiritual crisis.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Path-appearance's phenomena completion reached ones" suggests that phenomena reach completion on the path, implying progressive attainment of completed states.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "completion" suggests finality. The path language implies progression.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Completion is substantialized as path-goal. The practitioner seeks phenomena-completion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Completion fixation. Phenomena mastery. Path navigation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Completion seeking → future orientation → never complete → frustration.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Entity markless because clear classification not" establishes marklessness as an entity-characteristic that can be clearly known despite classification absence.

WHY IT ARISES:
The causal language suggests entity. The negation of classification implies transcendence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Marklessness is substantialized as entity-characteristic. The practitioner knows markless entity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Entity fixation. Characteristic knowledge. Conceptual grasping.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Entity grasping → self-grasping → eternalism → wrong view.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Self-aware meaning ultimate is that-three inseparable" establishes self-awareness as ultimate meaning that is eternally inseparable from the three bodies.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "ultimate" suggests highest truth. The inseparability implies permanent union.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Self-awareness is substantialized as ultimate truth. The practitioner seeks permanent self-aware state.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Self-awareness fixation. Ultimate truth grasping. Inseparability obsession.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Self-grasping → eternalism → Hindu confusion → loss of pure view.
