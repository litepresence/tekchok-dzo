[SYSTEMIC ERROR] [STRUCTURAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18112-18127: The eight consciousnesses are enumerated (all-base, five sense, mental, afflicted mentation) as "that on which all karma and afflictions of the three realms depend." One might treat this as definitive description of psychological structure.

WHY IT ARISES:
The Yogacara framework of eight consciousnesses is presented as foundational. Western psychology has trained us to think in terms of cognitive systems and structures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The provisional, pedagogical nature of the eight-consciousness model is missed. What is one possible framework among many becomes reified as "how the mind actually works."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to work directly with the consciousnesses ("purifying the all-base," etc.) rather than recognizing that the entire schema dissolves in the recognition of rigpa.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [WORKING WITH SYSTEM ERROR] where the map becomes the territory, and [GRADUAL PURIFICATION ERROR] where each consciousness must be separately addressed.

[SOTERIOLOGICAL ERROR] [PATH ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18133-18137: The text states that these minds "are to be abandoned because they are the nature of ignorance," and describes how common vehicles distinguish mind and mind-nature. One might conclude abandonment is an act of rejection.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of abandoning (spang bya) and distinguishing ('byed) suggests active effort and separation. Path language naturally implies doing something to achieve results.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual recognition that transforms without rejecting is missed. "Abandonment" is understood as elimination rather than the natural dissolution that occurs in recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to reject or suppress mental activity, creating aversion and dualistic struggle. The "pure" mind-nature is sought by excluding the "impure" mind.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REJECTION ERROR] where practice becomes anti-mental, and [PURIFICATION ERROR] where impurity is seen as real and requiring elimination.
