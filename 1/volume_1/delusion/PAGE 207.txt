[PRACTICE ERROR] [CHANNEL OPENING OBSESSION]

MISREADING:
The "channel opening" (rtsa 'byongs) is interpreted as a mechanical procedure that creates passageways for energy flow, like unclogging pipes or opening roads for traffic.

WHY IT ARISES:
Infrastructure metaphors project onto subtle body. The opening-closing language suggests mechanical process. Desire for smooth flow supports hydraulic interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that channel opening is recognition of natural flow, not creation of passageways, is entirely lost. Practice becomes plumbing rather than wisdom.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners force "openings" causing energetic damage. The natural state is abandoned for engineered systems. Obstacles become enemies rather than teachers.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on signs of opening become completion certificates.

[VIEW ERROR] [EMPTINESS AS VOID]

MISREADING:
The "emptiness of channels" (rtsa nang stong) is understood as hollow vacuity, like empty tubes or containers, rather than the empty-yet-lucid nature of awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Western "emptiness" concepts project onto Buddhist terminology. The spatial language suggests vacuity. Nihilistic tendencies support void-interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that emptiness is luminous clarity is entirely obscured. Channels become dead space rather than dynamic display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners cultivate vacuity while missing luminosity. Depression or dissociation results from nihilistic practice. The alive becomes the dead.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on wisdom wind will be approached as moving through empty space.

[EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [WISDOM WIND SUBSTANCE]

MISREADING:
The wisdom wind (ye shes kyi rlung) is treated as a special kind of energy or force that replaces ordinary winds, like upgrading to premium fuel in a vehicle.

WHY IT ARISES:
Energy-substitution models project onto subtle body. The "wisdom" modifier suggests enhanced substance. Consumer upgrade psychology supports replacement-interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that wisdom wind is the natural movement of recognition, not a substance to acquire, is entirely lost. Seeking replaces being.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners chase "wisdom wind" experiences while neglecting ordinary recognition. The special is fetishized over the ordinary. Acquisition replaces rest.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on wind-mind union will be approached as substance-fusion.

[GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [YOUTHFULNESS DEFERRAL]

MISREADING:
The signs of successful practice (freedom from aging, wrinkle-free, radiant youth) are interpreted as future rewards to be earned through prolonged practice, like accumulated health benefits.

WHY IT ARISES:
Deferred-gratification psychology projects onto spiritual practice. The conditional language suggests earned rewards. Fear of aging drives practice-motivation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that timeless recognition transcends aging is entirely obscured. Practice becomes anti-aging regimen rather than wisdom cultivation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners obsess over physical appearance as practice-indicator. Disappointment when aging continues leads to abandonment. The ageless is abandoned for age-resistance.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on longevity will be approached as life-extension techniques.

[PROGRESS TRACKING] [DISEASE ELIMINATION]

MISREADING:
The elimination of wind-bile-phlegm disorders is treated as guaranteed medical outcome of practice, like natural health cure with measurable efficacy.

WHY IT ARISES:
Medical efficacy frameworks project onto tantra. The health-benefit language suggests therapeutic causation. Desire for healing supports literal interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that recognition transcends disease-concepts is entirely lost. Practice becomes alternative medicine rather than wisdom path.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners abandon medical treatment expecting tantric cure. Blame self when disease persists. The transcendent is reduced to the therapeutic.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on physical benefits will be approached as medical claims.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page discusses channel opening and benefits of practice. Preceding pages established thigle manipulation errors that carry forward. Following pages (208+) discuss postures and retention methods that will be misunderstood through lens of physical technique.
