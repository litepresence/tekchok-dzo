[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENT-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These five elements are the actual building blocks from which all realms physically manifest. Understanding elemental cosmology is key to understanding how samsara is constructed."

WHY IT ARISES:
The concrete enumeration of elements and realms suggests a physical cosmology. Western materialist and pagan traditions work with elemental forces. The systematic correspondence feels like hidden knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies the five elements as metaphysical forces generating realms, attempting to work with elemental energies. They reify elements as primal powers.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Elements are approached as forces to harness
2. Realm manifestation becomes engineering
3. Natural purity is obscured by elemental work
4. Dzogchen becomes elemental magic

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ELEMENT-ERROR (elemental reification) → PRACTICE ERROR (elemental manipulation) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as causal). The practitioner becomes an elemental magician.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, IGNORANCE-TAXONOMY-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text catalogs six ignorances arising through different modes: root mind, delusion object, delusion-basis, grasp thought, remedy path, and not-know confuse. A reader might think: "These are six distinct types of ignorance with specific characteristics. I need to diagnose which types afflict me and apply targeted remedies."

WHY IT ARISES:
Taxonomies promise precision and control. Western psychology diagnoses by type. The six-fold classification suggests personalized treatment.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes their experience for these six ignorance types, seeking to categorize and eliminate each specifically.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Experience is fragmented into types
2. Remedies are tailored to diagnoses
3. Natural self-liberation is replaced with treatment
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual medicine

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates IGNORANCE-TAXONOMY-ERROR (diagnostic fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (type-specific treatments) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as entities). The practitioner becomes a spiritual diagnostician.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOGONY-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the wish-fulfilling tree, Buddha's blessing, eggs, heat and moisture, and the arising of world systems. A reader might think: "This is the actual cosmogony—how the universe literally began. Understanding this creation story reveals the deepest truth about reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
Origin narratives satisfy existential curiosity. Westerners seek creation stories. The vivid imagery suggests mythic truth about beginnings.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner interprets the cosmogony as literal history, studying how the world began instead of recognizing its nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Myth is taken as historical fact
2. Present recognition is postponed for origin-understanding
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen becomes mythology

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COSMOGONY-ERROR (literal myth) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origin for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (myth as history). The practitioner studies the beginning instead of recognizing.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, MIND-CATEGORY-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists various minds: "Ignorance and equal mind and mind consciousness mind and all seek mind and certainty put mind and aspect coarse mind and definitely place mind." A reader might think: "These are distinct categories of mind I need to identify in my experience. Understanding these categories will clarify my mental landscape."

WHY IT ARISES:
Categorical lists suggest typologies to master. Western psychology categorizes mental states. The detailed enumeration promises comprehensive understanding.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner categorizes their mental states according to these types, seeking to map their mind completely.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mind is fragmented into categories
2. Experience is analyzed rather than recognized
3. Natural clarity is obscured by mapping
4. Dzogchen becomes mental cartography

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MIND-CATEGORY-ERROR (typological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (mental mapping) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (minds as separate entities). The practitioner draws maps of their mind.
