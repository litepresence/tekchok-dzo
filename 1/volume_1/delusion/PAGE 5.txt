[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [QUANTIFICATION FALLACY]

MISREADING:
Measurements (yojanas, lifespans) are precise quantitative claims about objective reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Scientific literalism treats all numbers as empirical claims.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Calculations of cosmological ages as factual assertions rather than symbolic indicators.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Absurd calculations or rejection of tradition as "unscientific."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].
