[REIFICATION ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The crown wheel's 360 channels and 2,009 subtle petals are fixed, permanent anatomical structures that exist as described in all beings, constituting the physical basis for enlightenment.

WHY IT ARISES:
The precise numerical enumeration suggests concrete, countable entities. Scientific-materialist habits lead readers to imagine these as discoverable physical structures, like neural pathways.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen physiology is reified into literal anatomy. The practitioner searches for or imagines these channels as actual physical tubes rather than energetic patterns inseparable from mind.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Confusion between provisional skillful means and definitive view. The practitioner mistakes descriptive anatomy for ultimate reality, failing to recognize channels as mind's display.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed categorization of channels by type (wisdom channels 50, body channels 38, rigpa channels 20, etc.) presents a comprehensive ontology that practitioners should study, memorize, and intellectually master.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic enumeration resembles academic taxonomies. Readers with scholastic training treat these lists as doctrinal content to be mastered through study and memorization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Intellectual knowledge accumulation replaces practice. The practitioner becomes expert in channel classification without any corresponding transformation or recognition of mind nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pride in comprehensive knowledge becomes obstacle. The scholar-practitioner can discourse eloquently on channel systems while remaining distant from direct recognition.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The channels corresponding to defilements (affliction channels 28, with specific allocations for anger, desire, ignorance, jealousy, pride) are actual pathways that carry negative energies and must be "purified" through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The allocation of specific defilements to specific channels suggests a mechanistic model where negative emotions flow through designated pathways and can be cleansed or blocked.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a purification technology of cleansing channels. The practitioner works to "purify" defilement channels rather than recognizing the empty nature of defilement itself.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Subtle aversion to "impure" channels develops. The practitioner seeks experiences of purity and tries to eliminate or transform impure energetic patterns, reinforcing dualistic grasping.
