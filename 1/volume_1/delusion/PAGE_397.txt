White and red essences (dkar dmar) are two substances combining to form the bindu.

WHY IT ARISES:

Investigating essences as substances.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that colors point to appearance-emptiness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] substance dualism.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EYE-FRUIT AS ORGAN]

MISREADING:
The eye-fruit (mig gi 'bras bu) is the physical eye organ as aperture for vision.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Fruit" suggests result. Anatomical correlation obvious.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Physicalist view of perception.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that aperture is metaphor for non-dual opening.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SUTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] materialism.
