[PHYSICAL ESSENTIALISM ERROR] [BODILY REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes descriptions of physical characteristics as establishing that enlightened beings have identifiable bodily marks or that physical perfection is required.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific physical descriptions trigger body-oriented thinking. Desire for certainty supports reading marks as signs.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Spiritual attainment is externalized into physical appearance. The emptiness of form is forgotten.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Body obsession develops. Discrimination based on physical appearance is validated.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that form is emptiness is entirely contradicted.
