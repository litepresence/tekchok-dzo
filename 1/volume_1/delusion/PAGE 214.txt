[GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [BREATH CONTROL]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets Four joys - emptiness (stong pa) nihilism through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.
