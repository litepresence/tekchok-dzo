[MANIFESTATION ERROR] [APPEARANCE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18570-18606: The text describes "wisdom-pervading objects" (yul la khyab pa'i ye shes) as inner light rays and their external projection as "appearances of wisdom." One might see this as describing actual visual phenomena or metaphysical optics.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed description of light (five colors, like sun, firefly, lamp) resembles phenomenology of light experiences. Technical terms like "light rays" (zer) suggest physical or energetic phenomena.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical nature of light imagery is missed. What describes the clarity aspect of awareness becomes literalized as actual visual phenomena to be experienced.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek light experiences, interpret visions as wisdom-appearances, or become attached to specific visual phenomena. The natural clarity of ordinary awareness is overlooked.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [VISION ERROR] where experiences are reified as signs, and [CHASING LIGHT ERROR] where specific phenomena become goals of practice.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [TECHNIQUE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18584-18606: Specific practices are mentioned: "wisdom arises from the eyes," "gazing upward," "turning the eyeballs upward." One might reduce Dzogchen to these physical techniques.

WHY IT ARISES:
The concrete instructions resemble yoga or physical practice. Specificity suggests these are the actual methods; the rest appears as philosophical explanation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is reduced to physical technique. The recognition that these are merely supports for those who need them is lost; the techniques become the path itself.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may obsess over proper technique, creating new forms of grasping. The effortless nature of recognition is obscured by effort to "do it correctly."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TECHNIQUE FIXATION ERROR] where method replaces recognition, and [CORRECT PERFORMANCE ERROR] where doing it "right" becomes the goal.
