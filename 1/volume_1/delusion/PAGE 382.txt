[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [THREE PARTS SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The three parts (right, left, center) of the bindu correspond to literal physical locations in the body.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical language (ro ma, rkyang ma, dbu ma) suggests physical channels.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Mapping bindu locations onto Western anatomical structures.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Disappointment when physical manipulation fails to produce realization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR].

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [METHOD-WISDOM DUALITY]

MISREADING:
Father-mother (yab yum) union of method and wisdom is a literal sexual practice or energy exchange.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sexual symbolism invites literalization. Karmamudra traditions exist in parallel.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Confusing symbolic union with physical or energetic technique.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Moral confusion or fixation on sexual methods.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR].

[REIFICATION ERROR] [DHARMAKAYA BINDU LOCATION]

MISREADING:
The dharmakaya bindu in the center is an actual place or container where something resides.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial language ("dwells," "center," "basis") suggests location.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Searching for bindu as object of meditation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that "center" is metaphor for non-dual nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MEDITATIONISM ERROR].
