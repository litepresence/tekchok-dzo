[SOCIAL ERROR] [CASTE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the prophecy about teachings being held by "outcaste family" as confirming caste hierarchy (even if inverted) rather than transcending it, failing to recognize that lineage is irrelevant to wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
The mention of caste categories, even in reversal, activates caste-consciousness. Social hierarchies are deeply embedded cognitive structures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching becomes associated with social identity rather than individual recognition. Elitist or populist mentalities develop based on social positioning.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Institutional power dynamics are justified or challenged using dharma rather than being seen as irrelevant to realization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about equality are interpreted through social lenses.

[ESCHATOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes absorbed in calculating the precise timeline of the sevenfold flourishing and decline, treating these prophecies as predictions to be verified rather than as pedagogical devices pointing to impermanence.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numerical specificity (year 60, year 100, year 500, etc.) combined with the systematic structure naturally invites chronological tracking. Modern predictive mindset seeks to "match" prophecies to historical events.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching's meaning is reduced to verifying or debunking predictions. The pointing function to present recognition is entirely lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reading becomes historicist rather than transformative. The reader collects data points rather than recognizing mind nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The immediacy of practice is deferred to "appropriate times" based on prophecy calculations.
