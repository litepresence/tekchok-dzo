[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TRIPARTITE PURIFICATION MECHANISM]

MISREADING:
The three channels purify body, speech, and mind through a mechanical process of separation and filtering.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14087-14090: "ro ma'i gnad la mkhas na lus kyi las thams cad dag par byed...rkyang mas ngag...kun 'dar mas sems" (Roma purifies body, Kyangma purifies speech, Kundarma purifies mind).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing purification as external process applied to channels.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to force purification through manipulation.
Missing that purity is the natural state, not achieved.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PURIFICATION PROJECT ERROR]

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [CHANNEL INDICATION LITERALISM]

MISREADING:
The channels "indicate" or "represent" (mtshon) bliss, clarity, and union as if they were symbols pointing to something else.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14091-14100: Extensive descriptions of what each channel "indicates."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thinking channels are separate from what they indicate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Searching for meaning beyond the channels themselves.
Missing that channels ARE the wisdom qualities they appear to indicate.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[REPRESENTATIONALISM OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [DEPENDENT ARISING WHEEL CONSTRUCTION]

MISREADING:
One must actively "turn the wheel of dependent arising" (rten 'brel gyi 'khor lo bskor) as a meditation practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 14092: "rten 'brel gyi 'khor lo bskor bas" (by turning the wheel of dependent arising).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing dependent arising as something to construct or manipulate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Effort-based meditation rather than recognition.
Missing that dependent arising is self-arising and self-liberated.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[CONSTRUCTIVE MEDITATION ERROR]
