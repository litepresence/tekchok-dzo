[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes compassion's display as appearing like emptiness yet clear, without elaboration yet great elaboration. A reader might think: "This describes the nature of compassion itself - it's paradoxical, appearing empty yet full, simple yet vast."

WHY IT ARISES:
We seek to understand compassion as an entity with characteristics. The paradoxical description seems profound, suggesting a deep mystery about compassion. We want to "get" what compassion really is.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Compassion becomes reified as a metaphysical principle with inherent paradoxical qualities. The practitioner studies "compassion" as an object of knowledge rather than living it as an activity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying compassion as a thing with qualities
2. Seeking to experience "compassion" as a state
3. Intellectualizing compassion instead of embodying it
4. Missing that compassion is activity, not an entity

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers REIFICATION ERROR (compassion as entity) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (studying instead of being compassionate) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching about compassion). The practitioner studies love.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes the Thal 'gyur tantra describing how essence abides as form, nature manifests as light, and compassion is the mode of arising. A reader might think: "This is the definitive tantric teaching on the structure of reality. These are the three fundamental principles."

WHY IT ARISES:
Tantric quotations carry authority. We treat scriptural citations as revelations of ultimate truth. The poetic, technical language feels like it encodes profound metaphysical facts about reality's structure.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The tantric description becomes a metaphysical system. The practitioner maps reality according to essence-nature-compassion, treating this as the definitive architecture of existence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Creating systematic metaphysics from tantric poetry
2. Debating the "correct" interpretation of tantric terms
3. Seeking experiences that match the tantric description
4. Missing that tantra uses skillful means, not ontology

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (tantric scholasticism) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (reified tantric metaphysics) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking tantric experiences). The practitioner becomes a tantric metaphysician.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, NIHILISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text argues that if primordial purity were the only aspect, there would be no ground for the arising of form and wisdom. If things arise from it, does this mean they exist or not? A reader might think: "This is showing that things both exist and don't exist - the middle way between extremes."

WHY IT ARISES:
We want to resolve the paradox. The middle way seems like the answer - things neither exist nor don't exist. We imagine a "middle" that transcends both extremes, a subtle ontological position.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts "neither existent nor non-existent" as a metaphysical position. This becomes a new extreme - the extreme of the middle, a subtle reification of indeterminacy.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Creating metaphysics of "neither/nor"
2. Seeking experiences of "the middle"
3. Debating middle way philosophy endlessly
4. Missing that the middle is not a position but freedom from positions

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to EPISTEMIC ERROR (middle as position) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (middle way debates) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking middle way experiences). The practitioner becomes a Madhyamika.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text concludes that the nature of primordial purity is spontaneous accomplishment, containing subtle wisdom-display as inner clarity. A reader might think: "So the base actually DOES contain wisdom and display - they're just subtle, internal, not gross outer phenomena."

WHY IT ARISES:
After extensive negation, we want something positive to hold onto. The text offers inner clarity, subtle wisdom - subtle enough to not contradict emptiness, yet present. We grasp this as the "real" nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies "subtle wisdom" and "inner clarity" as the true nature of the base. These become positive attributes that survive the negation, subtle qualities of ultimate reality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying subtle wisdom as the ultimate
2. Seeking experiences of "inner clarity"
3. Creating dualism between subtle (real) and gross (unreal)
4. Missing that "subtle" is still a conceptual designation

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates REIFICATION ERROR (subtle as real) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking subtle states) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (subtle metaphysics). The practitioner chases the subtle.
