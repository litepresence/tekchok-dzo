[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed anatomical description of channels connecting heart to head to eyes is interpreted as literal physiological claim—that wisdom actually travels through physical channels from heart to eyes, and thodgal visions result from this physiological process.

WHY IT ARISES:
Precise anatomical language (*རྩ་དར་དཀར་, *སྒལ་ཚིགས་, *དབུས་མ*) triggers scientific-materialist reading. Western neuroscience bias unconsciously interprets these as claims about nervous system or cardiovascular system. "Connects" suggests literal physical linkage.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal is reduced to physiological process—light experiences explained as retinal stimulation, channel-pressure effects, or neurological phenomena. The direct recognition of awareness-nature is obscured by mechanical explanations. "Wisdom light filling space" becomes optic nerve activation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The "channel-root" (*ཡར་རྩེ་) is treated as a physical structure to be manipulated. "Arising and entering" (*འབྱུང་འཇུག་) is interpreted as literal flow of something through tubes. The formless display of rigpa is reduced to subtle-body mechanics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where thodgal is compared to other traditions' subtle-body practices. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as practitioners attempt to activate channels physically. [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] proliferates—believing awareness is a subtle energy flowing in tubes.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of channels piercing the heart, throat, and crown is interpreted as instructions for a yoga practice—guiding energy through these centers as a technique to achieve wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
The piercing imagery (*ཟུག་) suggests active penetration. Familiarity with chakra systems triggers projection onto Dzogchen. Western practitioners habitually transform descriptions into techniques—"this is what I should do."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes kundalini yoga or tummo practice—deliberately moving energies through centers. The natural self-arising of awareness-display is replaced by deliberate manipulation. "Crystal house" (*ཤེལ་བུག་) becomes another center to activate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The five lights of luminosity (*འོད་གསལ་གྱི་རླུང་ལྔའི་གདངས་) are sought as experiences to achieve through technique. "Abiding together" (*ལྷན་ཅིག་གནས་) is interpreted as something to accomplish through practice. Spontaneous presence is undermined.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where specific energetic experiences become markers of progress. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as elaborate subtle-body preparation is taught as prerequisite for Dzogchen. [VIEW COLLAPSE] occurs when tantric completion stage is read into Atiyoga.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The Tathāgatagarbha simile—"like sesame oil pervading sesame seeds"—is interpreted as asserting a literal essence or substance within beings that is Buddhahood, a truly existing seed or potentiality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Garbha language (*སྙིང་པོ་) triggers essentialist reading. The simile suggests physical containment. Western spiritual seekers interpret such statements as evidence of innate divinity or soul-like essence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature is reified as an entity or substance truly present within beings. The emptiness (*སྟོང་པ་ཉིད་) of Buddha-nature is missed. Practitioners believe they possess a hidden treasure that needs uncovering rather than recognizing what has never been obscured.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The "vase-kāya" (*བུམ་སྐུ་) simile is taken literally—awareness contained like light in a vase. "Pervading" (*ཁྱབ་པ་) is read as spatial occupation. The groundless ground is given form and location. Dzogchen becomes excavation of inner essence.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—belief in truly existing Buddha-nature substance. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as practitioners attempt to "access" or "uncover" this essence. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as teachers present gradual purification to reveal innate perfection.
