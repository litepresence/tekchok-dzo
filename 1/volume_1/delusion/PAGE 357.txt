[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL-DROP-WIND TRIAD SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
Channels, drops (thig le), and wind (rlung) are three distinct entities that interact mechanically.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14613-14616: "rlung dang thig le'i gnas pa ni/re re dag la re re'o/de dag rlung du 'phro ba dang/rnam par gnas pa kho na'o" (wind and drop's location is each each...they radiate as wind and are located as form).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing the triad as separate interacting substances.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to manipulate their interactions.
Missing that they are indivisible wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TRIAD MANIPULATION ERROR]

[NUMERICAL LITERALISM] [WIND COUNT OBSESSION]

MISREADING:
The precise count of winds (21,600 per day, etc.) represents an actual inventory of breaths to be tracked.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14634-14642: "nyin zhag re la nyi khri stong...skad cig khri dang bzhi stong ngo" (21,600 per day...14,000 moments).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Counting breaths as spiritual practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Obsession with numerical precision.
Missing that counts are conventional designations.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[QUANTITATIVE MEDITATION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [KARMA-WISDOM WIND DICHOTOMY]

MISREADING:
There are fundamentally different types of wind - karma wind and wisdom wind - as if they were distinct substances.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14633-14637: "bcu ni las kyi rlung yin te...lhag ma drug brgya ye shes rlung" (ten are karma wind...remainder 600 are wisdom wind).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing karma and wisdom as different entities.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to access wisdom wind while avoiding karma wind.
Missing that all wind is equally wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[WIND DISCRIMINATION ERROR]
