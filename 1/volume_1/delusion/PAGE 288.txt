[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MATERIALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text uses elaborate jewel metaphors: "Jewel various-arrange-by-means-of mass height jewel-by-means-of palace arrange-beautiful jewel various-decorate-by-means-of queen ornament-beautiful." A reader might think: "These jewels represent actual spiritual treasures. The more jewels I accumulate, the more beautiful my realization. These are attributes of enlightenment I should cultivate."

WHY IT ARISES:
Jewel metaphors trigger materialistic associations. Western capitalism values accumulation. The description sounds like wealth and beauty to possess.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the jewel metaphors as spiritual qualities to accumulate. They seek to "collect" the various jewels of realization, measuring progress by quantity of attributes.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Spiritual materialism around qualities
2. Comparison with others' "jewel collections"
3. The simple nature is obscured by ornamentation
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual consumerism

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MATERIALISM ERROR (spiritual accumulation) → REIFICATION ERROR (qualities as jewels) → PRACTICE ERROR (collecting attributes). The practitioner becomes a spiritual jewel thief.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text continues jewel metaphors: "jewel empty mandala draw-beautiful jewel end border-knot three are coiled beautiful jewel deep darkness dispel wide in naturally profound." A reader might think: "These are technical descriptions of mandala structures, border knots, and configurations. I need to understand the symbolic system."

WHY IT ARISES:
Specific details (mandala, border-knot, three coils) suggest a symbolic code to decipher. Western scholars and symbolists want to interpret the system. The architecture seems meaningful.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes the jewel metaphors as a symbolic architecture, seeking hidden meanings in every detail. They create elaborate interpretations of the mandala structure.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Symbolic analysis replaces direct recognition
2. Hidden meanings are fabricated
3. The direct pointing is missed in interpretation
4. Dzogchen becomes hermeneutics

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (endless interpretation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (meaning for realization) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (symbols as codes). The practitioner becomes a cryptographer of jewels.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the "third that from other benefit doing" as "sphere primordially-pure great dharmakaya field that from unmoving while spontaneous from-door beings appearance-mode with accord benefit doing." A reader might think: "From the unmoving Dharmakaya sphere, I can benefit beings by manifesting in accord with their modes. This is the practice of compassionate activity."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Benefit doing" suggests compassionate action to perform. Western bodhisattva aspirants want to help others. The description sounds like a method for enlightened activity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a practice of "benefiting beings from Dharmakaya," attempting to remain in unmoving purity while manifesting for others. They reify Dharmakaya as a base for action.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dharmakaya becomes a platform for activity
2. "Unmoving" is practiced as dissociation
3. Natural compassion is replaced with method
4. Spontaneous response is lost in technique

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PRACTICE ERROR (compassionate activity method) → REIFICATION ERROR (Dharmakaya as base) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (unmoving vs moving dualism). The practitioner performs compassion from their tower.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, COMPARATIVE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "these all common vehicles in also appear uttaratantra from compounded-not and spontaneously accomplished other condition by-means-of realized not." A reader might think: "These teachings appear in common vehicles too, especially Uttaratantra. Dzogchen is just expressing the same Buddha-nature teachings found there."

WHY IT ARISES:
The mention of "common vehicles" and Uttaratantra triggers comparative analysis. Western academics want to contextualize Dzogchen. The apparent similarity suggests Dzogchen is not unique.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reduces Dzogchen to Uttaratantra's Buddha-nature teachings, missing the distinct Atiyoga view. They conflate traditions, believing they all teach the same thing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dzogchen is diluted into general Mahayana
2. Unique instructions are missed
3. Eclecticism replaces specific lineage
4. The pinnacle view is lowered to common ground

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COMPARATIVE ERROR (conflating traditions) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (academic reduction) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (missing unique view). The practitioner flattens Dzogchen into generic Buddhism.
