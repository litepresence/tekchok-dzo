[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Indicating word's tantra" and "meaning's tantra" establish a dual classification where words point to meaning, suggesting that meaning exists separately from and behind words.

WHY IT ARISES:
The word/meaning dichotomy suggests Platonic separation. The indicating function implies direction toward something.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Meaning is substantialized as existing behind or beyond words. The practitioner seeks to access meaning by bypassing words.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Word aversion. Seeking pure meaning. Rejection of text.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Meaning-mysticism → anti-textualism → vulnerability to oral charlatans → loss of lineage.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Mind itself self-nature by/from clear light thought's stain from free" establishes mind as inherently clear light, with thoughts as stains covering this pure nature.

WHY IT ARISES:
The clear light/stain contrast suggests covered purity. "Free from" implies liberation from contamination.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Mind is substantialized as clear light obscured by thoughts. The practitioner seeks to remove thought-stains.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Thought aversion. Purity fixation. Meditation as cleaning.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Thought suppression → dullness → quietism → depression.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"All to/in always abiding" and "buddha's lineage" and "buddha's characteristic holding" establish a permanent abiding Buddha-nature that exists continuously and defines lineage.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "always abiding" suggests permanence. The lineage language implies continuity through time.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature is eternalized as always-existing essence. The practitioner identifies with this permanent lineage.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eternalist view. Lineage narcissism. Rejection of impermanence.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Eternalism → self-grasping → rejection of Buddhism → syncretism with Hinduism.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed breakdown of word tantra (name, word, letter's self-nature; creation sequence, completion sequence, non-dual union) presents a comprehensive linguistic and yogic taxonomy to be mastered.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumeration invites classification. The technical terms suggest specialized knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes linguistic and yogic taxonomy. The practitioner masters categories rather than recognizing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Technical expertise as spirituality. Category confusion. Scholastic pride.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Taxonomy mastery → philosophical debate → sectarian conflict → violence.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Rise measure are creation sequence's chief" and the enumeration of ten stages with specific components (empowerment, samaya, deity, mantra) present a graduated curriculum to be completed.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numbered sequence (first, ten) implies stages. The enumeration suggests requirements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is reduced to creation-stage curriculum. The practitioner progresses through the ten items.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Stage fixation. Progress tracking. Comparison with others.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Curriculum fixation → checklist Buddhism → loss of spontaneity → rigid practice.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Word's tantra are" establishes a category of tantras that operate through words, suggesting words have special power or that word-tantras are a distinct class.

WHY IT ARISES:
The categorization suggests classification. The specification "word's" implies ownership or medium.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Words are reified as tantric vehicles. The practitioner believes certain words have inherent power.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Mantra fixation. Word magic. Linguistic superstition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Mantra obsession → mechanical recitation → loss of meaning → empty ritual.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Both equal part non-dual union" describes a synthetic state where opposites are united into a higher non-dual reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The "both" suggests combination. The "non-dual union" implies synthesis.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Non-duality is understood as synthesis of opposites. The practitioner seeks to unite creation and completion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Synthetic view. Attempted unification. Grasping at union.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Unification effort → forced practice → frustration → abandonment.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"All from beyond showing great perfection's essential point" establishes a transcendent Great Perfection that exists "beyond" and has essential points to show.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "beyond" suggests transcendence. The "essential point" implies something crucial.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Great Perfection is substantialized as a transcendent reality. The practitioner seeks to access this beyond.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Transcendence fixation. Beyond-chasing. Rejection of immanence.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Transcendence obsession → dissociation → spiritual bypassing → psychological crisis.
