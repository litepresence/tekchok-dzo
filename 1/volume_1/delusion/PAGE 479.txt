[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The colophon statement that this is an "extremely important key point" (gnad gal po che) of the Natural Great Perfection Heart Essence, not to be taught "broadcast to all directions," is interpreted as elitist claim about secret knowledge reserved for special beings, or conversely, as reason to reject all secrecy as hierarchical.

WHY IT ARISES:
Secrecy triggers both elitist and egalitarian reactions. "Not to be broadcast" triggers access-control associations. Western practitioners assume secrecy claims present either spiritual aristocracy or unjust exclusion.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pedagogical-context nature of transmission-restrictions is lost. The practitioner either covets secret status or rejects all restriction. The pointing function of secrecy collapses into identity-politics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Important key point" becomes exclusive possession. "Heart essence" becomes brand-name. The practitioner either seeks insider-status or markets previously-secret teachings widely.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding transmission-restrictions as pedagogical skill-means rather than ontological claims, the practitioner develops [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]—either premature teaching without foundation or unnecessary restriction out of elitism. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all esoteric language is politicized. Recognition is replaced by access-control.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The closing statement that one should "understand well and practice in the continuum" (legs par khong du chud par byas la rgyud la nyams su blangs) is interpreted as claim that realization comes from accumulated practice over time, requiring sustained effort to achieve understanding.

WHY IT ARISES:
Process-oriented thinking assumes temporal development. "Practice in continuum" triggers effort-accretion associations. Western practitioners assume temporal descriptions present developmental requirements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured by temporal framing. The practitioner believes understanding requires duration. The pointing function of "practice" collapses into duration-accumulation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Understand well" becomes intellectual achievement. "Continuum" becomes time-investment. The practitioner evaluates practice by longevity, creating spiritual seniority-system.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding closing exhortation as recognition-exhortation rather than effort-requirement, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in dzogchen gradualism. They may feel inadequate at "not enough practice" or pride in "long practice." The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all temporal language is developmentalized. Recognition is replaced by practice-duration.
