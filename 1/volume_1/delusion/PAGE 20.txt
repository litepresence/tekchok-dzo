[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [FAMILY MANDALA LITERALISM]

MISREADING:
Five Buddha families represent actual groups or types of beings with distinct personalities.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Family" terminology suggests social categories. Colors and directions invite mapping.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Five wisdoms reduced to personality typology (like psychology systems).

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Identifying with one family as "my type" rather than recognizing all five as aspects.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR].
