[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR] [NIHILISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Only conventionally purifying aggregates and elements" (kun rdzob tsam du sbyang bya phung po dang khams) is interpreted as "emptiness means nothing needs purification"—leading to rejection of all purification practices as unnecessary conceptual fabrication.

WHY IT ARISES:
Emptiness teachings are weaponized against method. The phrase "only conventional" triggers anti-ritual bias. Practitioners conflate "ultimately empty" with "relatively meaningless," rejecting skillful means as dualistic.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The two-truths framework collapses into one-sided nihilism. The practitioner abandons ngondro, purification, and accumulation while lacking recognition of nature. This is "premature Dzogchen"—parroting high view without foundation. Ethical conduct degenerates because "nothing to purify."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Ultimately no deity exists" (don dam par lha yang med pa) becomes license for abandoning yidam practice. The practitioner claims "seeing all as deity" while actually seeing all as meaningless. Spiritual bypassing justifies avoiding difficult practice commitments.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without purification, karmic obscurations remain. The practitioner develops [EPISTEMIC ERROR]—believing intellectual understanding of emptiness equals realization. When obstacles arise, they cannot diagnose whether these are signs of practice or results of neglect. They may develop hostility toward teachers who emphasize method, dismissing them as "stuck in conventional truth."

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The three concentrations (de bzhin nyid, kun tu snang, de bzhin rgyu) are practiced as sequential stages of meditation technique—first achieving thought-free clarity, then adding non-distraction, then generating deity from emptiness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Meditation instruction format invites step-by-step approach. The threefold structure triggers developmental sequencing. Western practitioners map this onto concentration → insight → integration models from other traditions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The three concentrations are severed from their unity. Practitioners spend years "perfecting" suchness meditation before attempting the others, or mechanically sequence them as technique. The lamp simile (three aspects, one lamp) is forgotten; three concentrations become three techniques.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Crystal clarity" (sa le sang nge) is reified as a state to achieve and maintain. The practitioner develops anxiety about "losing" the state. Meditation becomes effort to sustain experience rather than recognition of nature. "Without distraction" (ma yengs) becomes hypervigilance rather than natural stability.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding three-aspect-oneness, the completion stage cannot be entered. The practitioner remains stuck in generation stage technique, believing more years of practice will produce spontaneous transition. They develop [PRACTICE ERROR]—accumulating hours of meditation as merit without transformative recognition. Eventually they abandon practice or switch traditions, claiming "Vajrayana didn't work for me."
