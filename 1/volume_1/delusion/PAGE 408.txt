[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "rang rig" (self-awareness) as referring to self-consciousness or self-knowledge in the psychological sense of self-concept or self-reflection.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Rang" (self) and "rig" (aware/know) naturally suggest self-knowledge or self-awareness as understood in psychology and common parlance.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The reflexive nature of awareness knowing itself is reduced to introspection or self-analysis. Students look within for a self that knows itself.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes self-observation or self-monitoring. The natural reflexivity of awareness is replaced by deliberate self-consciousness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as introspection, then to MEDITATIONISM of self-monitoring technique, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between awareness and ego.

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding the fivefold classification of wisdom (shes rab) as five separate wisdoms that one must develop individually and sequentially.

WHY IT ARISES:
The number five and the word "dbye ba" (division) suggest distinct categories. Students assume they must cultivate each wisdom separately.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single nature of wisdom manifesting in five aspects is fragmented into separate achievements. Practice becomes checklist-oriented.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students feel inadequate if they haven't "developed" all five wisdoms. Teachers create curricula for "wisdom development."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL fragmentation, then to MEDITATIONISM of separate practices for each wisdom, and finally to SCHOLARLY obsession with classification systems.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "so sor rtog pa'i shes rab" (analytical wisdom) as instruction to intellectually analyze phenomena during meditation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"So sor rtog pa" (individual analysis) suggests analytical investigation. Students assume this means thinking about phenomena during practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct recognition is replaced by discursive analysis. Students mentally categorize experiences rather than recognizing their nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation becomes thinking practice. The non-conceptual nature of wisdom is obscured by conceptual analysis.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY meditation on concepts, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between concept and reality, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through overthinking.

[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "rang shar" (self-arisen) to mean that phenomena arise automatically or spontaneously as if produced by a hidden mechanism or power.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Self-arisen" suggests automatic production without apparent cause. Students imagine a hidden spontaneous generation mechanism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The lack of inherent causation is misunderstood as mysterious auto-generation. Students seek the "mechanism" of spontaneous arising.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice focuses on "letting things happen spontaneously" rather than recognition. Deliberate action is rejected as unnatural.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC rejection of causation, then to ETERNALISTIC view of spontaneous generation power, and finally to PRACTICE of passive inaction.
