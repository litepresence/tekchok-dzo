[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text shows that if the base is truly undetermined, impurity could revert from purity. A reader might conclude: "This proves the base IS determined as pure, otherwise sentient beings could fall back into samsara after liberation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Fear of regression and desire for spiritual security. The mind wants guarantees that practice "works" and that enlightenment is irreversible. This reflects projective anxiety about one's own stability.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner clings to "pure awareness" as a permanent attainment that cannot be lost. This creates a new eternalist refuge and subtle spiritual arrogance. "I'm safe now, unlike those still at risk."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Spiritual elitism and judgment of "less evolved" beings
2. Anxiety when doubts or "impure" thoughts arise
3. Suppression of perceived regressions
4. Rigidity in practice (must maintain the pure state)

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers ETERNALISTIC ERROR (permanent enlightenment) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (using spirituality to avoid shadow material) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching from fear rather than wisdom). The student becomes a guardian of orthodoxy rather than a genuine practitioner.

[REIFICATION ERROR, ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text critiques comparing the base to space (unchanging essence, unchangeable appearance). A reader might think: "The author rejects space as metaphor, so the base must be like something else—perhaps like water, or like a mirror, or like the clear sky."

WHY IT ARISES:
Addiction to metaphors and concrete imagery. The mind cannot rest without some conceptual handle. Even when one metaphor is rejected, it seeks another. This is reinforced by " pointing out instruction" traditions that use multiple metaphors.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Endless proliferation of metaphors, each taken literally in turn. The practitioner collects comparisons: base is like space, like ocean, like mirror, like crystal—never realizing ALL metaphors fail. This becomes "metaphor shopping."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Accumulation of spiritual concepts without integration
2. Preference for teachers who give "better" metaphors
3. Missing the point that the base transcends metaphor
4. Sophisticated ignorance—knowing many concepts but realizing none

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (accumulating concepts) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (believing better concepts = better understanding) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking experiences that match the metaphors). The practitioner becomes a connoisseur of spiritual language.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR, ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text discusses whether realization depends on the base existing prior. A reader might conclude: "Realization must depend on a pre-existing base, otherwise there's nothing to realize." Or the opposite: "The base doesn't exist before realization, so realization creates the base."

WHY IT ARISES:
Confusion about the relationship between ground (gzhi), path (lam), and fruit ('bras bu). Western linear causality assumes either ground → path → fruit OR that fruit creates ground retrospectively (idealism).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts either eternalism (ground exists eternally, waiting to be discovered) or subjective idealism (realization creates the ground). Both miss the non-dual relationship where ground-path-fruit are not truly separable.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Eternalists wait passively for realization to "happen"
2. Idealists believe their mind creates reality
3. Both miss the spontaneous nature of rigpa
4. Practice becomes either passive waiting or aggressive manipulation

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (wrong view of ground) → PRACTICE ERROR (wrong relationship to method) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (ground becomes psychological state). The practitioner is stuck in conceptual maze.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR, ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes Klong drug pa's critique of the "determined base" using the example of someone with jaundice seeing a conch as yellow. A reader might think: "This proves perception is flawed and we need to see the 'true' color—rigpa sees correctly, ordinary mind sees wrongly."

WHY IT ARISES:
The jaundice metaphor is cognitively powerful and suggests a medical/correction model. Westerners especially gravitate toward "seeing clearly" as the goal. It validates the intuition that something is "wrong" with ordinary perception.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts a dualistic framework: deluded perception vs correct perception, obscured vs unobscured. They seek to "cure" their perception rather than recognize the non-dual nature of all perception.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Spiritual bypassing of ordinary experience
2. Attempting to maintain "pure" perception constantly
3. Judgment of "deluded" thoughts and perceptions
4. Missing that even "correct" perception is still perception

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking pure perception) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reifying pure awareness) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (debating what counts as "correct" perception). The practitioner becomes a spiritual perfectionist.
