[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The three types of bindu (*ཐིག་ལེ་)—basis-holding, path-appearance, fruition-maturing—are interpreted as literally existing substances or entities that transform through practice, like physical particles that evolve.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Bindu" suggests droplet or point-particle. Threefold division triggers developmental reading. Western materialism interprets these as subtle physical entities in the body.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Bindu is reified as subtle substance. Practitioners attempt to manipulate, move, or transform bindus through technique. The natural self-display of awareness is replaced by bindu-alchemy.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"White and red bindus" (*ཐིག་ལེ་དཀར་དམར་) are treated as actual substances from parents. "Spontaneously accomplished bindu of five lights" becomes something to locate. The formless is reduced to form.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] where bindu-manipulation becomes technique. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] follows as bindus are treated as truly existent. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as bindu-physiology is taught.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The presentation of bindu as "nature light bindu" and "Samantabhadra bindu" is interpreted through tantric framework—as completion-stage subtle-body practice involving manipulation of sexual essences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Familiarity with tantric bindu-concepts causes projection. "Samantabhadra bindu" suggests deity-yoga. Technical terminology overlaps with completion stage vocabulary.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen view collapses into tantric completion stage. Thodgal becomes advanced bindu-yoga. The direct recognition of rigpa is obscured by subtle-body techniques.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Unchanging bindu" (*མི་འགྱུར་ཐིག་ལེ་) from *Guhyasamāja* is equated with Dzogchen bindu. Practices from mother tantras are read into Atiyoga. The distinctiveness of Dzogchen is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] produces [PRACTICE ERROR] where thodgal requires sexual yoga preparation. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows as texts are conflated. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The conventional bindu of cause (*ཀུན་རྫོབ་རྒྱུའི་ཐིག་ལེ་) is interpreted as literal genetic or sexual substance from parents—asserting that enlightenment potential is physically inherited through biological processes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Reference to father's cause (*ཕའི་རྒྱུ་) and mother's condition (*མའི་རྐྱེན་) triggers biological reading. "Seed" (*ས་བོན་) suggests genetics. Western scientism interprets this as embryology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature is reduced to genetic inheritance. The universal possibility of awakening is constrained by biological determinism. "Only women can realize certain aspects" becomes gender essentialism.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Red and white bindus are treated as actual sexual fluids. Birth types (*རྫུས་སྐྱེས་, *སྒོ་ང་ལས་སྐྱེས་) are read literally. The metaphorical nature of pointing-out language is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is compared to reproductive biology. [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as bindu is materialized. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as gender-based restrictions are imposed.
