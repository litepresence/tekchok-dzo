[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "emerge-do appearance individual path" leading to "pure primordial-awareness great door-to." A reader might think: "There is a specific path with individual appearances that leads to a great door of pure wisdom. I need to follow this emergence process to reach the door."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Path" and "door" are concrete, directional metaphors. Western spiritual seekers want a way to get somewhere. The description of a progression from emergence to door suggests a journey with a destination.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner imagines an actual path of individual appearances leading to a literal "great door" of wisdom. They attempt to traverse this path, looking for signs of progress toward the destination.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. The practitioner seeks experiences of "emergence"
2. Progress markers are fabricated and pursued
3. Direct introduction is bypassed for path-walking
4. Spontaneous presence becomes destination instead of nature

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MEDITATIONISM ERROR (walking the path) → REIFICATION ERROR (path and door as real) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (seeking arrival instead of recognition). The practitioner becomes a spiritual traveler who never arrives.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text uses the metaphor of camphor that appears as cooling quality but not as fever quality, stating fault and quality are not established in the essence. A reader might think: "This is like my true self (camphor essence) which has various appearances (cooling/fever) but I shouldn't identify with either. I need to find my essence beyond qualities."

WHY IT ARISES:
The camphor metaphor is psychologized as the "true self" versus its various manifestations. Western depth psychology (Jung, etc.) teaches finding essence beyond persona. The metaphor feels like an invitation to self-discovery.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner seeks an "essence" beyond fault and quality—a pure core self that remains unaffected by conditions. They attempt to disidentify from all qualities to find this essential nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Essence is reified as a pure self
2. Spiritual bypassing through "I am not my qualities"
3. Conditions are rejected in favor of essence
4. The inseparability of appearance and emptiness is missed

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (essence as true self) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified essence) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking disidentification). The practitioner becomes a spiritual essentialist.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes spontaneous presence's potency manifesting like primordial wisdom, with delusion reversing when self-other duality is not divided. A reader might think: "Spontaneous presence has power/potency that I can access. When I stop dividing self and other, delusion reverses into wisdom."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Potency" sounds like energy or power to harness. "Not dividing self and other" sounds like a practice of non-dual perception. The reversal of delusion sounds like a transformation the practitioner can effect.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to "access" spontaneous presence's potency and "stop dividing" self and other. They meditate on non-duality and wait for delusion to reverse, turning description into prescription.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Spontaneous presence becomes an energy source
2. Non-division becomes a practice of merging
3. Reversal is awaited as future attainment
4. The already-complete nature is missed

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PRACTICE ERROR (doing non-duality) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (awaiting reversal) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (potency as possessable). The practitioner tries to will themselves into wisdom.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes how impure samsara enters and reverses, with bardo appearances and the six actual bases from which sense liberation occurs. A reader might think: "These are describing actual realms and states—samsara, bardo, liberation. I need to understand these domains to navigate them properly."

WHY IT ARISES:
The cosmological description sounds like a map of territories to traverse. Westerners want clear maps of spiritual geography. The detailed description of bases and bardos suggests a complex realm to master.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies samsara, bardo, and liberation as actual places or states to navigate. They study the "map" intently, planning how to move from samsara through bardo to liberation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Samsara and nirvana become real locations
2. The bardo is feared or anticipated as real transition
3. Liberation is sought as arrival elsewhere
4. All-pervading rigpa is missed while navigating

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (realms as existent) → PRACTICE ERROR (navigation strategies) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (map-learning instead of recognition). The practitioner becomes a spiritual cartographer.
