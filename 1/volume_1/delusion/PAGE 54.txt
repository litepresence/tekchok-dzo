ERROR TYPE 1: [FACULTY ELEMENTAL MATERIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The correlation between the six sense faculties and the five elements—eye with earth's stability, ear with wind's movement, nose with water's gathering, tongue with fire's maturation, mind with space's pervasion—is interpreted as a materialist physiology where perception is mechanistically determined by elemental composition, rather than symbolic correspondence pointing to empty display.

WHY IT ARISES:
Reductionist science seeks physical explanations. The elemental language appears to offer a "scientific" account of perception. Western medicine treats sense organs as biological mechanisms. The practitioner assumes this elemental model is the literal mechanism of perception.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound symbolic teaching is reduced to elemental physics. The practitioner attempts to "fix" perception by manipulating elements—balancing earth in the eyes, increasing fire in the tongue. The spontaneous recognition of perception's empty nature is replaced by elemental engineering.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The wisdom-faculties (faith, effort, mindfulness, samadhi, wisdom, liberation) are similarly reduced to physiological states to be cultivated. "Developing faith" becomes a biochemical intervention. The transformative power of recognition is lost in mechanistic manipulation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] where elemental balance is believed to mechanically produce enlightenment. It generates [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] where the practitioner perpetually works on "elemental preparation" before attempting direct recognition.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 2: [OBJECT/EMPTY DUALISTIC PERCEPTION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The distinction between "object that appears as a thing" (dngos po'i yul) and "emptiness object" (stong pa nyid kyi yul) is interpreted as establishing two different types of perception or two different objects—ordinary perception of things and special perception of emptiness—rather than the inseparability of appearance and emptiness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic epistemology assumes different types of cognition for different objects. The practitioner believes they must develop a special "emptiness perception" distinct from ordinary perception. Meditation traditions often emphasize shifting from conventional to ultimate perception.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner alternates between two modes—ordinary perception of things and special perception of emptiness. Non-dual wisdom is never accessed. The unity of appearance-emptiness remains theoretical rather than realized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Emptiness meditation" becomes a technique of perceiving absence. The richness of appearance is abandoned for void. The practitioner becomes incapable of functioning in daily life, trapped in "ultimate perception" that negates conventional reality.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where emptiness is reified as nothingness. It generates [TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] where the practitioner seeks methods promising to "see emptiness directly" without understanding the unity of appearance and emptiness.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 3: [EXTREME TRANSCENDENCE OBSESSION] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The categories of "beyond extremes" (mtha' las 'das pa) and "beyond view" (lta ba las 'das pa) are interpreted as establishing a transcendental realm totally removed from all ordinary experience, as if the goal is to escape to a place beyond all concepts, views, and extremes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual escapism seeks transcendence of ordinary existence. The language of "beyond" triggers metaphysical fantasies. The practitioner conflates "not grasping extremes" with "existing in a place beyond extremes."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Liberation becomes a transcendental escape. The practitioner seeks to leave ordinary reality behind and enter a special "beyond" state. The natural perfection of ordinary experience is denied in favor of metaphysical abstraction.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner becomes "spaced out" and disconnected. Daily life is seen as "still within extremes" and therefore inferior. Relationships, responsibilities, and engagement with the world are abandoned in pursuit of the "beyond."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [SUTRA DISMISSAL] where foundational teachings are rejected as "within extremes." It generates [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] where the practitioner believes they have access to a "beyond" state unavailable to ordinary practitioners.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 4: [PERCEPTUAL PURITY OBSESSION] [PRACTICE ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The description of perception free from all grasping to extremes (mthar 'dzin thams cad dang bral ba) and supreme awareness beyond expression (brjod pa las 'das pa'i blo dam pa) is interpreted as requiring the practitioner to eliminate all perceptual grasping through effortful purification, as if non-grasping must be achieved.

WHY IT ARISES:
Purification tendencies interpret all spiritual goals as states to be achieved through elimination of impurities. The practitioner assumes "free from grasping" means they must actively remove grasping. Buddhist ethics emphasizes abandoning negative states.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes aggressive elimination of grasping. The practitioner attempts to "stop grasping" through force, creating aversion toward their own natural tendencies. The gentle recognition of grasping's empty nature is replaced by violent self-suppression.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation becomes tense and watchful. The practitioner constantly monitors for grasping to eliminate. Spiritual narcissism develops around "how free from grasping I am." Authentic relaxation is impossible because grasping is made into an enemy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This feeds [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] where the practitioner believes they must eliminate all grasping before genuine practice. It produces [PROGRESSION MYTH] where freedom from grasping is conceived as the endpoint of gradual purification.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 5: [DUAL OBJECT PEDAGOGY] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The presentation of two types of objects—conventional things and emptiness—is interpreted as establishing a curriculum where the practitioner must first master perception of conventional objects, then advance to perception of emptiness objects, as if these are sequential learning objectives.

WHY IT ARISES:
Educational systems emphasize sequential learning. The practitioner assumes spiritual development follows similar progression. The clear categorical distinction invites pedagogical sequencing—first this, then that.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner defers recognition while working on "mastering conventional perception." Years are spent analyzing ordinary objects without recognizing their emptiness. Then years are spent seeking emptiness-perception as if it were a different object.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The simultaneous presence of appearance and emptiness is never accessed. The practitioner oscillates between conventional and ultimate without integration. Scholarly understanding of "two truths" replaces direct recognition of one taste.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY] where recognition is perpetually deferred until "mastery" is achieved. It generates [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] where studying objects is believed to mechanically produce understanding of emptiness.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS
================================================================================

PREVIOUS PAGE (53) CONTEXT:
Page 53 introduced the faculties (dbang po) classification and the distinction between grasped objects and grasping subjects. Page 54 continues with the elemental correlations and develops the distinction between two types of objects/perception.

NEXT PAGE (55) ANTICIPATION:
The text will complete the presentation of object-types and transition to discussing the non-existence of apparent phenomena and the nature of afflictions. The practitioner should maintain continuity—these are not separate topics but deepening analyses of the same empty experience.

CRITICAL CONTINUITY POINT:
The elemental correlations and the "two objects" framework are pedagogical devices for analyzing experience. The practitioner must not become fixated on mastering these categories as ends in themselves. Each analysis should point toward recognition, not replace it.

BLEED RISK:
High. The proliferation of object-types and faculty classifications invites categorical fixation. The practitioner may accumulate extensive knowledge of "two objects" while remaining ignorant of their inseparability.
