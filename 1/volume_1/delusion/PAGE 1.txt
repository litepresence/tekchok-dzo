[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Samantabhadra as a "primordial Buddha" suggests a historical or mythological figure existing in time and space, rather than the ground of being itself.

WHY IT ARISES:
Western religious frameworks unconsciously impose theistic interpretations. The term "Buddha" triggers associations with Shakyamuni-type figures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Ground (gzhi) is reified into a metaphysical entity or god-substitute.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dzogchen becomes a theistic religion rather than recognition of mind's nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] and [MEDITATIONISM ERROR].
