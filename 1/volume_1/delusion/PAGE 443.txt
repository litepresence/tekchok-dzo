[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed specifications for thodgal practice—basis (*རྟེན་), location (*གནས་), path (*ལམ་), gate (*སྒོ་), object (*ཡུལ་), time (*དུས་), destination (*འགྲོ་ས་), liberation-place (*གྲོལ་ས་)—are interpreted as literal instructions for a meditation technique to be performed under specific conditions.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic enumeration (eight factors) triggers procedural reading. Technical terms like " channels" and "gates" suggest a method. Western practitioners habitually transform phenomenological descriptions into meditation protocols.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes a complex technique with prerequisites—specific postures, times (dawn, dusk), visual fields (cloudless sky), and destinations to aim for. The natural display of rigpa is replaced by deliberate practice. "Liberation-place" becomes a goal to reach.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The "eight spontaneous doors of arising" (*ལྷུན་གྲུབ་ཀྱི་འཆར་སྒོ་བརྒྱད་) are treated as visual experiences to achieve. Those who recognize go to the expanse, those who don't wander in samsara—is interpreted literally as destinations rather than modal abiding. Practice becomes achievement-oriented.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where specific visions (*སྣང་བ*) become markers of progress. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as teachers prescribe thodgal techniques with elaborate preparations. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] occurs when these instructions are compared to tantric completion stage practices.

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The similes (*དཔེ་) provided for each factor—like a wolf in a plain, like a vase-kāya, like a pearl garland—are interpreted as visualization objects or meditation supports rather than illustrative analogies pointing to naturally abiding qualities.

WHY IT ARISES:
The concrete imagery triggers visualization practice. "Like a butter lamp inside a vase" suggests a specific image to hold in mind. Western practitioners, familiar with visualization-based practices, unconsciously transform similes into meditation objects.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal practice becomes visualization exercise—imagining channels as pearl garlands, wisdom as butter lamps, etc. The direct recognition of naturally abiding rigpa is obscured by deliberate fabrication. Similes become supports rather than pointers.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The "conch-shell house" (*དུང་ཁང་) as location for wisdom is visualized as an actual structure. The "great gate of bhṛguta" becomes a visualization portal. Natural self-arising (*རང་ཤར་) is replaced by constructed imagery. The formless is forced into form.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] where thodgal becomes another visualization practice like deity yoga. [REIFICATION ERROR] follows as similes are taken literally. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as elaborate visualization curricula are developed for "thodgal preparation."

[REIFICATION ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The specification that rigpa abides "in the heart-jewel eight-cornered, in the center of the pure light-channel, within the five lights" is interpreted as locating awareness in a specific physical place—a spatial claim about where consciousness resides in the body.

WHY IT ARISES:
Precise anatomical coordinates trigger literal spatial reading. "In the heart" suggests physical location. Western neuroscience bias unconsciously interprets these as claims about consciousness-brain/body relationship.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Rigpa is spatialized and localized—reduced to a phenomenon residing in a specific body location. The all-pervading (*ཁྱབ་པ་), groundless nature of awareness is lost. Practitioners search for rigpa "in" the heart rather than recognizing what pervades all experience.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The eight-cornered heart-jewel becomes an object of fixation or visualization. The "five lights" are sought as internal experiences. "Abides" (*གནས་) is read as static occupation rather than modal dwelling. Dynamic awareness-display (*རྩལ་) is frozen into location.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] produces [PRACTICE ERROR] where practitioners focus attention on the heart center attempting to "find" rigpa there. [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] follows—believing awareness is a subtle entity located in the body. The formless dharmakaya is reduced to subtle form.
