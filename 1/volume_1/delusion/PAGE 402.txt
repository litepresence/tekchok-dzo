[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Treating "rig pa'i rang yul" (awareness's own object) as a separate object that awareness grasps, rather than the self-appearing nature of awareness itself.

WHY IT ARISES:
Habitual dualistic perception assumes a subject-object structure where awareness must have something "out there" that it knows. The phrase "rang yul" triggers this dualistic reflex.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness becomes reified as a subject confronting an object, destroying the non-dual recognition that rigpa is self-illuminating without subject-object bifurcation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner searches for an object of meditation rather than recognizing the nature of the searcher. Practice becomes object-oriented seeking rather than self-recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to EPISTEMIC delusion of thinking one must "find" awareness, then to MEDITATIONISM of trying to stabilize a subject-object experience, and finally to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through endless conceptual analysis of awareness-object relations.

[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]

MISREADING:
Interpreting "rang bzhin med par snang bar byed" (makes appear as without nature) as meaning appearances are completely non-existent or illusory in a nihilistic sense.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "rang bzhin med" (without nature/self-nature) triggers associations with emptiness as voidness or non-existence rather than emptiness as luminous appearance without inherent existence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner devalues appearance, seeing it as merely false or unreal, missing that the very lack of inherent nature IS the miraculous display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes nihilistic negation rather than recognition of appearance-emptiness union. The vividness of experience is suppressed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL failure where students are taught to dismiss experience, then to PRACTICE collapse through dissociative meditation, and finally to NIHILISTIC view denying the validity of appearance entirely.

[EPISTEMIC, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Taking the threefold division of "gzhi, lam, 'bras bu" (ground, path, fruit) as describing three separate sequential stages or ontological states that exist independently.

WHY IT ARISES:
Linear temporal thinking projects progressive development onto the teaching. The numbered list structure suggests discrete categories rather than three aspects of a single nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is understood as a gradual path with distinct stages to traverse, contradicting the teaching that ground, path, and fruit are simultaneously present.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner fixates on "progressing" through stages rather than recognizing what is already complete. Ground becomes distant, path becomes effortful, fruit becomes future.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of stage-focused practice, then to REIFICATION of the three as fixed categories, and finally to ETERNALISTIC view of a truly existent progression toward enlightenment.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "dgongs pa" (intention/realization) as a mental state or psychological experience that one enters into, like a meditative absorption.

WHY IT ARISES:
The word "dgongs pa" is commonly used for mental intention or thought. Its technical Dzogchen meaning as the spontaneous wisdom-intention of the ground is obscured by familiar usage.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound spontaneously arisen wisdom is reduced to a mental state that can be produced through effort, missing that it is the nature of mind itself.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about inducing experiences rather than recognition. The natural state is sought as an altered state.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of experience-generation, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of the path as therapy or self-improvement, and finally to EPISTEMIC delusion of confusing recognition with experience.
