[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DUALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The classification of winds into "wisdom wind" (ye shes rlung) and "karma wind" (las rlung) describes two distinct types of energy that can be distinguished and separately cultivated or eliminated.

WHY IT ARISES:
The binary classification suggests two distinct ontological categories. Dualistic habits lead readers to imagine these as separable energies with different essences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to eliminate karma wind while cultivating wisdom wind, treating them as actually distinct rather than differently labeled depending on recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Aggression toward "ordinary" energy develops. The practitioner tries to get rid of karma wind, failing to recognize that all wind is empty of inherent nature.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of channels where winds and thigle dwell indicates specific locations that can be accessed through techniques, and that damaging certain channels (gseng) creates defects while preserving others maintains function.

WHY IT ARISES:
The technical medical language (defects, preservation, damage) suggests a mechanical system requiring careful manipulation. Practical applications invite literal interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a preservation project of protecting channels. The practitioner develops anxiety about damaging subtle body structures through wrong practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conservative caution replaces fearless view. The practitioner becomes hesitant and careful, believing delicate channels can be damaged by incorrect practice.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "vital letters" (gnad kyi yi ge) placed at specific body locations constitute a precise map for visualization meditation—one should place awareness at these letter-locations to transform the body into the mandala.

WHY IT ARISES:
Tantric practice commonly involves placing seed syllables at body locations. Readers familiar with such practices automatically apply this framework.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes tantric visualization practice. The practitioner focuses on placing letters in body locations, believing this constitutes Dzogchen meditation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Construction effort replaces recognition. The practitioner works to build or transform the body through visualization rather than recognizing its already-perfect nature.
