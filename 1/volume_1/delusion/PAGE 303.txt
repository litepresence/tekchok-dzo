[12608-12622]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DEMONOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "black demon" (bdud nag po) and "demon realm" are understood as actual malevolent entities and locations rather than aspects of dualistic fixation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Demon" (bdud) suggests external threat. Cultural residue of pre-Buddhist demonology supports literal reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen teaching is reduced to exorcism or protection from external forces. The internal process of dualistic fixation is externalized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops fear-based practice or seeks protection rituals. The recognition that demons are one's own projections is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR] and [FEAR-BASED ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "four types of people" (mi bzhi) and their military roles are interpreted as literal caste or social classes needed for practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumeration suggests classification system. Socio-political frameworks interpret symbolic categories as social stratification.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The four wisdom aspects symbolized by the four types are reduced to social commentary. Technical instructions become sociological observation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner misses the pointing to the four modes of wisdom (gathering, liberating, distinguishing, moving). Practice degenerates into class analysis.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SOCIOLOGICAL COLLAPSE ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].

[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The aunt "Ling-thog-can" and her refusal to release the son is understood as family drama rather than teaching on co-emergent ignorance.

WHY IT ARISES:
Family narrative triggers psychological reading. The relational dynamics suggest interpersonal conflict interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching about lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig pa (co-emergent ignorance) binding rig pa is entirely missed. Drama replaces dharma.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they understand the "story" while remaining completely ignorant of the crucial Dzogchen distinction between innate ignorance and cognitive ignorance.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] and [IGNORANCE MISCLASSIFICATION ERROR].

[12653-12664]
[PRACTICE ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The weapons (sword, mirrors) and military force are interpreted as actual implements and armies needed for spiritual warfare.

WHY IT ARISES:
Military imagery triggers literal martial interpretation. Heroic frameworks valorize spiritual combat against forces of evil.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's peaceful recognition is replaced by aggressive spiritual warfare. The five wisdoms symbolized by the implements become weapons of destruction.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner adopts confrontational attitude toward experience. The teaching that recognition dissolves fixation without conflict is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [AGGRESSION ERROR] and [DUALISTIC ERROR].
