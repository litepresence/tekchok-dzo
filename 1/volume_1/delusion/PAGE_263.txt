[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that from the conventional perspective there is spontaneous accomplishment, while from the ultimate perspective there is primordial purity. A reader might think: "So there ARE two truths - conventional and ultimate. These are two levels of reality, with ultimate truth being 'more real' than conventional."

WHY IT ARISES:
The two truths framework is commonly taught in Buddhism, and we naturally create a hierarchy: ultimate truth is "real," conventional is "mere appearance." This reflects dualistic thinking and the desire for a "higher" truth.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The two truths become two realities - one more real than the other. The practitioner seeks the "ultimate" truth and dismisses conventional appearances as illusory in a negative sense.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dualistic separation of appearance and emptiness
2. Seeking "ultimate reality" beyond appearances
3. Dismissing relative reality as unimportant
4. Missing that the two truths are not two but one taste

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified ultimate truth) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking ultimate states) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (debating two truths). The practitioner becomes a two-truths dualist.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text presents a dialogue format with questions from bodhisattvas and answers from the teacher. A reader might think: "These are the definitive answers to the key philosophical questions. This dialogue settles the doctrinal matters once and for all."

WHY IT ARISES:
We naturally treat authoritative texts as repositories of final answers. The dialogue format suggests these are the definitive responses to objections. We want certainty, settled doctrines, finished philosophy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The dialogue becomes a catechism of correct answers. The practitioner memorizes the positions and treats them as established truth rather than skillful means pointing beyond itself.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating doctrinal positions as final truths
2. Memorizing answers rather than investigating questions
3. Using quotes to win debates
4. Missing that the dialogue is meant to provoke insight, not settle matters

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (doctrinal fixation) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching answers not inquiry) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (mistaking words for realization). The tradition becomes scholastic.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states that words cannot harm or establish the nature of the base. A reader might think: "So the truth is beyond words - it's an ineffable reality that can only be experienced directly, not described."

WHY IT ARISES:
Mystical traditions often emphasize the ineffability of ultimate truth. We romanticize direct experience as superior to conceptual understanding. "Beyond words" becomes a marker of profound truth.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner seeks "ineffable experiences" beyond language, dismissing conceptual understanding entirely. "Beyond words" becomes a new metaphysical category - a realm of pure experience.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Rejection of intellectual understanding
2. Seeking wordless mystical experiences
3. Dismissing teachings as "mere concepts"
4. Missing that "beyond words" is also a concept

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking ineffable states) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (privileging experience over understanding) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (anti-intellectual transmission). The practitioner becomes a wordless mystic.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the base as primordially pure like a crystal without stains, yet with spontaneous accomplishment present within it. A reader might think: "So the base is like a crystal - a pure, clear medium in which things appear. The crystal is the essence, appearances arise from it."

WHY IT ARISES:
The crystal metaphor is powerful and evocative. We naturally visualize it - a clear, pure substance. The metaphor becomes the reality in our minds. We imagine a "pure base" as a substratum.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as a metaphysical substance - pure, clear, primordial. The crystal becomes a thing, the base becomes a container or medium in which appearances arise.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying the base as a substratum
2. Seeking experiences of "pure clarity"
3. Creating dualism between pure base and impure appearances
4. Missing that the crystal is a metaphor, not an entity

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (substantializing the base) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking clarity experiences) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (dualism of base/appearances). The Dzogchen becomes substantialist metaphysics.
