[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The two awarenesses—basis-holding and characteristic-holding—are interpreted as asserting two distinct types or species of awareness that actually exist, either as different consciousness-faculties or sequential stages.

WHY IT ARISES:
Twofold division triggers categorical thinking. "Awareness" (*རིག་པ་) suggests consciousness-type. Western psychology interprets these as distinct cognitive functions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Single rigpa is bifurcated into two entities. Practitioners study "the two awarenesses" as doctrine. The natural, non-dual recognition is replaced by conceptual proliferation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Basis-holding" becomes ground-awareness. "Characteristic-holding" becomes manifest-awareness. The inseparability of ground and display is fragmented into duality.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is reduced to typology. [REIFICATION ERROR] follows as awareness-types are objectified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "basis-holding awareness" as "thing-self-arisen wisdom" is interpreted as asserting a truly existing primordial awareness-substance that abides as the ground of all—metaphysical foundationalism.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Self-arisen" (*རང་བྱུང་) triggers essentialist reading. "Thing" (*དངོས་) suggests entity. Western metaphysics seeks primordial ground of Being.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Rigpa is substantialized as primordial consciousness. "Self-arisen" is taken as proof of inherent existence. The emptiness (*སྟོང་པ་ཉིད་) of awareness is denied.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Fifteenfold classification" becomes attributes of this substance. "Vajra chain-linked appearances" are emanations from this ground. The formless dharmakāya is given form as "basis."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] where awareness is substantialized. [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as elaborate metaphysics is constructed. [VIEW COLLAPSE] occurs when emptiness is denied.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The "characteristic-holding awareness" as "five wisdoms' essence, three kāyas' nature, expanse-established Buddha pervading all samsara-nirvana without addition or subtraction" is interpreted as the "highest" or "final" achievement of practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive description triggers teleological reading. "Pervading all" suggests universality. Western spiritual hierarchies interpret this as ultimate attainment.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen collapses into achievement-framework. This awareness becomes the goal to reach. The primordial, never-obscured nature is missed in pursuit of attainment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Five wisdoms, three kāyas" are treated as qualities to acquire. "Pervading samsara-nirvana" becomes omniscience-achievement. "Without addition or subtraction" is read as description of goal-state.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] where effort is directed toward achieving this awareness. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] follows as qualities are reified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.
