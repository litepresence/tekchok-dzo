[12267-12287]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SELF-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "End self-by-means-of appearance self condition-by-means-of basis to return two-as not-possess-by-means-of appearance self arise-as not-know and delusion to master-as grasp-by-means-of master condition." A reader might think: "The self appears through conditions and returns to basis. I need to let self return to basis to end delusion."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Return to basis" sounds like going home. Westerners want to return to source. The self's return suggests a journey to complete.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a practice of "returning self to basis," trying to dissolve self into ground.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Return is pursued as goal
2. Self is rejected for basis
3. Natural self-liberation is replaced with journey
4. Dzogchen becomes homeward bound

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SELF-ERROR (return project) → PRACTICE ERROR (dissolving self) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (self vs basis dualism). The practitioner tries to go home.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, LIGHT-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Object-by-means-of object self light outside arise from master condition mirror and face and light and awareness and reality three-as understand-by-means-of master condition called." A reader might think: "Light arises from objects outside. I need to understand how light, awareness, and reality work as the master condition. This is a teaching on light metaphysics."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Light" metaphors suggest spiritual illumination. Western esoteric traditions work with light. The three-fold analysis seems like metaphysics to study.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies light, awareness, and reality as a metaphysical system, trying to understand the "master condition."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Light is reified as metaphysical principle
2. System is analyzed intellectually
3. Natural clarity is obscured
4. Dzogchen becomes light metaphysics

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates LIGHT-ERROR (metaphysical light) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (system analysis) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (light as principle). The practitioner studies illumination.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, RIPENING-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "That two-by-means-of ripen body-by-means-of make accumulate different arise and mind-by-means-of cause make-by-means-of perception object different-by-means-of." A reader might think: "Through these two, body ripens and accumulations are made. I need to understand the ripening process to complete the path."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Ripen" suggests maturation over time. Western developmental psychology understands growth. The text seems to describe a maturation process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues "ripening" as developmental process, seeking to mature and complete accumulations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Ripening is awaited
2. Accumulations are gathered
3. Natural perfection is delayed
4. Dzogchen becomes ripening project

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates RIPENING-ERROR (developmental thinking) → PRACTICE ERROR (maturation project) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (unripe vs ripe). The practitioner waits to mature.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, CHAIN-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists dependent origination: "that from object from utilize is touch that from joy sorrow middle three arise is feeling that from bliss to attached and suffering not-desiring knowing is craving." A reader might think: "This is the chain of dependent origination I need to break. If I can stop at any link, I can stop samsara."

WHY IT ARISES:
Chains suggest links to break. Western engineers want to break causal chains. Dependent origination is seen as mechanism to interrupt.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner tries to "break the chain" at various links, seeking to stop dependent origination.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Chain is treated as machine to stop
2. Links are targeted for interruption
3. Natural flow is resisted
4. Dzogchen becomes chain-breaking

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates CHAIN-ERROR (mechanistic interruption) → PRACTICE ERROR (breaking links) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (chain as machine). The practitioner becomes a chain-breaker.
