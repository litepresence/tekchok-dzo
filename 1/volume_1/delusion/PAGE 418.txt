[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "don" (meaning/reality) as referring to a transcendent ultimate reality beyond appearances.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Don" (meaning/reality) suggests something substantial. Students assume this is a higher reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of appearance and reality is split into two levels. Students seek a reality beyond appearances.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes two-tiered: apparent and real. The directness of recognition is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of appearance vs. reality, then to MEDITATIONISM of seeking ultimate, and finally to ETERNALISTIC view of transcendent reality.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding "rnam grangs" (enumeration/classification) as a definitive map of reality rather than pedagogical skillful means.

WHY IT ARISES:
Classifications suggest comprehensive knowledge. Students assume these describe the structure of reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Skillful means are reified into ontological claims. Students debate classifications as if they were reality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes studying maps. The territory of direct experience is abandoned.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY map-territory confusion, then to PEDAGOGICAL fixation on systems, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of categories.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "skyil mo krung" (posture) as requiring precise physical positioning for meditation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Posture" suggests physical technique. Students assume correct posture is essential.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural presence is replaced by posture obsession. Students believe position creates realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Physical strain develops. The irrelevance of posture to recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of physical technique, then to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of posture, and finally to PRACTICE harm through rigid positioning.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "lus" (body) in tantric contexts as referring to the physical organism rather than the mandala of channels and elements.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Body" naturally refers to physical body. Students assume tantra is about the physical organism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The subtle body is materialized into physical anatomy. Students study physiology instead of recognizing energetic patterns.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes physical yoga. The energetic dimension is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ONTOLOGICAL reduction of subtle to physical, then to MEDITATIONISM of physical technique, and finally to SCHOLARLY anatomy studies.
