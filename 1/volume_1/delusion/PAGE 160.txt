[TELEOLOGICAL ERROR] [DESTINY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the systematic presentation of teachers appearing to tame beings across aeons as establishing a predetermined cosmic drama where beings are merely acted upon by external saviors, losing agency and immediate responsibility.

WHY IT ARISES:
The passive grammatical constructions ("disciple-of appear-to tame make teacher come") combined with cosmic time scales suggest a deterministic unfolding that the individual can only witness rather than actively participate in.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Personal practice is devalued in favor of waiting for the appropriate teacher or time. The teaching that recognition is immediately available is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fatalism develops. The reader believes liberation depends on external conditions rather than present recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about self-liberation are interpreted through the lens of waiting for the right moment.

[SEED ERROR] [POTENTIALITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes "teaching seed three self-arise flourish decline without" as teaching that the three seeds exist as potentials that naturally mature without effort, leading to passivity.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "seed" (snying po) triggers organic metaphors of natural growth. "Self-arise" (rang byung) suggests automaticity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Effort is abandoned as unnecessary because the seed will "naturally" flourish. The distinction between natural unfolding and recognition is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes passive waiting rather than active recognition. The reader confuses latency with manifestation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The path structure is abandoned because "everything happens naturally."
