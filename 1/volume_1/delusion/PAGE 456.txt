[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The nine bindus in channels are interpreted as literally existing subtle particles or energetic concentrations that physically reside in specific anatomical locations—metaphysical anatomy taken as physical fact.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumeration (*དགུ་, nine) triggers categorical reification. Channel references suggest anatomy. Western scientific materialism interprets energetic descriptions as physical structures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal is reduced to subtle-body cartography. Practitioners study "the nine bindus" as anatomical facts. The natural display of awareness is replaced by physiological exploration.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Entry bindus" (*འཇུག་པའི་ཐིག་ལེ་) are treated as physical gateways. "Birth bindus" become embryological entities. "Arrangement bindus" are mapped spatially. The metaphorical becomes literal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is compared to other subtle-body systems. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as anatomical study replaces recognition. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The locations of bindus in citadel, dhūtī, conch-shell, etc., are interpreted as asserting that these bindus are literally present in all sentient beings as physical or energetic structures—universal anatomy claim.

WHY IT ARISES:
"All sentient beings" (*སེམས་ཅན་ཀུན་) triggers universalist reading. Anatomical specificity suggests literal claim. Western egalitarianism interprets this as "everyone has the same potential."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature is spatialized and localized in specific body parts. The all-pervading nature of rigpa is lost. "Everyone has bindus in these locations" becomes metaphysical biology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Bindu of pure kāya in citadel" is mapped anatomically. "Bindu of emptiness-symbols in dhūtī" becomes location claim. "Path bindu in channel-root" is treated as discoverable feature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] where students search for bindus in their bodies. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows as Dzogchen anatomy is compared to other systems. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The cascade description—expanse's resonance produces vajra chain-linked, from that merit-kāya, from that kāya's display produces wisdom, etc.—is interpreted as literal cosmogony asserting how phenomena actually come into existence.

WHY IT ARISES:
Process language (*ལས་, *བྱུང་) triggers causal reading. "Produces" suggests generation. Western metaphysics interprets this as ontological account of creation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is reduced to cosmological system. The cascade is taken as literal description of how things arise. The non-dual, non-originated nature of display is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"True rigpa exists in vajra chain-linked" becomes existence claim. "Merit produces kāya" suggests causal generation. "From wisdom's ornament comes light" is read as physics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is treated as metaphysics. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] follows as cascade levels are reified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.
