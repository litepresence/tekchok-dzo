[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, OBSCURATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Mind six gather-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of path obscure and that also mind-by-means-of wisdom not-see and clear not-give wisdom to thought not-possess mind from move-maker exist-by-means-of cause Buddha-by-means-of path obscure is." A reader might think: "Mind obscures wisdom and Buddha-path. I need to stop mind from moving to clear the path. This is a practice of mind-stopping."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Mind obscures" suggests mind is the problem to solve. Westerners seek to stop thinking. The text seems to instruct mind-cessation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates mind-stopping practices, trying to cease mental activity to reveal wisdom. They battle mind as obstacle.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mind is rejected as enemy
2. Stopping becomes fixation
3. Natural wisdom is missed in suppression
4. Dzogchen becomes anti-mind warfare

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates OBSCURATION ERROR (mind as enemy) → PRACTICE ERROR (stopping mind) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mind vs wisdom dualism). The practitioner tries to kill their mind.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "ignorance sentient-being-by-means-of delusion manner and first spontaneous from self arise and self face not-know-by-means-of awareness from." A reader might think: "This is the actual cosmology of how delusion began—first spontaneous presence, then not-knowing self-face. I need to understand this origin story."

WHY IT ARISES:
Origin stories fascinate Westerners. The "first" suggests a beginning to understand. Cosmological narratives feel like deep truth.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies the delusion cosmology as literal history, seeking to understand "how it all began." They reify the narrative as actual temporal sequence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Cosmology is taken as literal history
2. The present is abandoned for origins
3. Narrative replaces recognition
4. Dzogchen becomes mythology

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COSMOLOGICAL ERROR (literal cosmology) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origin for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (reified beginning). The practitioner studies the fall from grace.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, HISTORICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists specific delusions: "Field Broad called from delude place Beautiful called from delude time when destroyed and delude year Pig year to delude sun Created sun to delude." A reader might think: "These are specific historical or astrological conditions that cause delusion. I need to avoid these times, places, and conditions."

WHY IT ARISES:
Specific details (Pig year, etc.) suggest actionable information. Western astrologers and diviners seek to avoid inauspicious conditions. The text seems to warn about specific dangers.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner avoids specific times, places, and conditions mentioned, believing they cause delusion. They try to control circumstances.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. External conditions are blamed
2. Avoidance becomes superstition
3. Internal recognition is abandoned
4. Dzogchen becomes divination

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates HISTORICAL ERROR (circumstantial avoidance) → PRACTICE ERROR (superstitious control) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (external causation). The practitioner becomes a spiritual weathervane.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ARMY ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "Friend four do then wild-man five arise then back-support one arise then thief one arise that all accumulate-by-means-of one arise that etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise." A reader might think: "These are actual negative forces—wild men, thieves, armies—that arise to obstruct practice. I need protection from these forces."

WHY IT ARISES:
Dramatic imagery (wild-men, thieves, armies) suggests real dangers. Westerners want protection from negative forces. The text seems to describe obstacles to overcome.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the "army" as actual obstructing forces, seeking protection and methods to defeat them. They engage in spiritual warfare.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Forces are treated as real enemies
2. Protection rituals are sought
3. The empty nature is missed
4. Dzogchen becomes exorcism

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ARMY ERROR (obstacle fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (spiritual warfare) → REIFICATION ERROR (forces as real). The practitioner battles imaginary armies.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SEQUENTIAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show." A reader might think: "The text is organized in nine sections showing sequences of divergence and liberation. I need to follow this sequence to understand the teaching."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Section nine" and "sequence" suggest progressive organization. Western textbook learners want to follow the sequence. The structure seems to offer a path through the material.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the nine sections as a sequence to progress through, believing understanding comes from following the order.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Sequential reading replaces recognition
2. Later sections are postponed
3. Present understanding is delayed
4. Dzogchen becomes curriculum

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SEQUENTIAL ERROR (following order) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (sequence for understanding) → PRACTICE ERROR (progressive study). The practitioner reads the book instead of recognizing.
