[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains the eight modes of spontaneous accomplishment's arising in detail. A reader might think: "These are the eight fundamental modes of manifestation. Understanding these exhausts the nature of display. This is the complete taxonomy."

WHY IT ARISES:
Numbered taxonomies suggest comprehensiveness. "Eight modes" promises a complete map. We imagine that understanding these eight covers all possibilities of manifestation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The eight modes become a closed system of manifestation. The practitioner believes understanding these exhausts the nature of display, creating intellectual closure.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating eight modes as complete system
2. Seeking to experience all eight modes
3. Debating the exhaustiveness of the taxonomy
4. Missing that display is unlimited

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (closed taxonomy) → REIFICATION ERROR (modes as exhaustive) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (intellectual closure). The practitioner thinks they've got it.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes each of the eight modes with poetic detail: desire unceasing like the wish-fulfilling jewel, enjoyment as wisdom-display, form as kayas, etc. A reader might think: "These describe the actual characteristics of each mode - the real way each one manifests in the nature."

WHY IT ARISES:
Vivid descriptions create mental imagery. We visualize each mode with its characteristics. The poetry seems to encode real information about the nature of each mode.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats poetic descriptions as technical specifications for each mode. "Wisdom-display" becomes a specific type of manifestation with defined characteristics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing mode characteristics
2. Seeking experiences matching each description
3. Creating hierarchy among the modes
4. Missing that descriptions evoke, not define

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates REIFICATION ERROR (modes as defined entities) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking mode experiences) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (mode taxonomy). The practitioner categorizes the infinite.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains how the impure mode of appearance arises from compassion's unceasing quality. A reader might think: "So impure samsara comes from compassion. This means samsara is actually a form of compassion, delusion is compassion's expression."

WHY IT ARISES:
We want samsara to be meaningful. If it comes from compassion, it has purpose. This justifies suffering as secretly enlightened, avoiding the difficult work of transformation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies samsara as "compassion's expression." This becomes spiritual bypassing - justifying delusion as secretly perfect, avoiding real practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Justifying neurotic patterns as "compassion"
2. Avoiding transformation since "it's all perfect"
3. Dismissing ethical discernment
4. Missing that recognition transforms, not justification

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (spiritual bypassing) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (avoiding real work) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (samsara as secretly pure). The practitioner justifies delusion.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text continues with extensive quotations, detailed explanations of modes, and scriptural references. A reader might think: "This is the comprehensive philosophical presentation of spontaneous accomplishment. Studying this gives complete understanding."

WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive presentation suggests mastery. We assume that studying all these details yields understanding. Academic accumulation substitutes for recognition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner approaches the text as comprehensive philosophy to be mastered. Understanding becomes equivalent to studying all the details and sources.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating text as comprehensive system
2. Accumulating scholarly knowledge
3. Competing in comprehensive understanding
4. Missing that pointing is not accumulating

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (comprehensive study) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (knowledge as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching comprehensive content). The tradition becomes encyclopedic.
