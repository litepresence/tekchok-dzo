[12665-12674]
[REIFICATION ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Three days" (zhag gsum) is understood as literal three-day period rather than symbolic indication of time needed for recognition to mature.

WHY IT ARISES:
Temporal markers trigger chronological reading. The need for measurable practice periods supports literalization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes time-based rather than recognition-based. The timeless nature of recognition is obscured by temporal framework.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner waits for time to pass rather than recognizing immediately. The teaching that time is also display of rig pa is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [DURATION ERROR] and [FUTURIZATION ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The crystal stupa, silver mirrors, and jewel staircase are understood as actual architectural features of a pure land to be visualized.

WHY IT ARISES:
Rich descriptive imagery triggers visualization practice. Tantric preliminary practices condition literal interpretation of symbols.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Generation stage (bskyed rim) visualization replaces Dzogchen recognition. The pointing to the structure of bar do experience becomes complex visualization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner exhausts themselves in elaborate visualization rather than simple recognition. The spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is replaced by constructed imagery.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GENERATION STAGE ERROR] and [CONSTRUCTION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "jewel house with eight doors" is interpreted as an actual dwelling place or palace to be entered or achieved.

WHY IT ARISES:
Architectural metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The desire for a stable place supports reification.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The eight doors of spontaneous display (lhun grub) become eight entrances to a palace. The teaching on the eight modes of appearance is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about reaching or entering rather than recognizing what already displays. The immanence of realization is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SPATIALIZATION ERROR] and [ATTAINMENT ERROR].

[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Riding sunbeams, wearing rainbow garments, and carrying crystal spears are understood as actual siddhis or magical powers to be achieved.

WHY IT ARISES:
Magical imagery triggers siddhi-seeking. The desire for extraordinary powers supports literal reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's simple recognition is replaced by pursuit of magical abilities. The symbolic language pointing to direct experience becomes goal-oriented practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner becomes distracted by magical thinking. The teaching that the path is recognition, not acquisition, is entirely lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SIDDHI-SEEKING ERROR] and [ACQUISITION ERROR].
