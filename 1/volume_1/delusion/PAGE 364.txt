[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of channels carrying "essence of consciousness" (shes pa'i dangs ma) to different directions (up, left, spokes, center) describes an actual hydraulic system where consciousness-fluid flows through physical channels.

WHY IT ARISES:
The hydraulic metaphors (flowing, gathering, holding) naturally suggest a fluid dynamics model. Readers habitually interpret energetic descriptions through physicalist frameworks.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Consciousness is reified into a substance that can flow, gather, and be held. The practitioner pursues somatic experiences of "consciousness movement" as if they were realizing mind nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Confusion between consciousness (rnam shes) and wisdom (ye shes). The practitioner mistakes movement of ordinary consciousness for wisdom manifestation.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The channels that "agitate the elements" ('byung ba 'khrugs pa) are actual pathways that, when disturbed, cause physical and mental disorders, requiring therapeutic intervention to restore balance.

WHY IT ARISES:
The medical context of these descriptions invites interpretation through health/illness frameworks. The causation language (channels disturb elements) suggests a mechanistic model.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a health practice focused on elemental balance. The practitioner approaches channel work as medical intervention rather than view-based recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Wellness goals replace liberation aims. The practitioner seeks physical health and elemental harmony rather than recognition of the nature of mind beyond elements.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "support of thigle" (thig le'i rten) and channels that "dwell in the basis" (gzhi la gnas pa) refer to permanent, unchanging structures that exist as the ground of being within the physical body.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of "basis" (gzhi) and "support" (rten) suggests foundational ontological entities. Eternalist habits interpret these as stable, enduring substrates underlying change.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ground is sought as a physical structure within the body. The practitioner searches for the "basis channels" as if they were a discoverable, permanent essence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Vedantic-style eternalism disguised as Dzogchen. The practitioner grasps at unchanging channels as the "true self" within the body.
