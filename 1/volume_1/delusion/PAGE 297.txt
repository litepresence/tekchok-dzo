[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, TIME-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Time to certainty not-possess-by-means-of time before after mutually conflict-by-means-of equal immediate condition self place liberate." A reader might think: "Time is uncertain and conflicted. I need to escape time into the immediate condition where past and future don't exist."

WHY IT ARISES:
Time anxiety is universal in modernity. The description of temporal conflict triggers desire for timelessness. "Immediate" promises escape from duration.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner seeks to escape temporal experience into an eternal present, rejecting time as obstacle.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Time is rejected as impure
2. "Immediate" is reified as timeless state
3. Natural unfolding is denied
4. Dzogchen becomes escapism

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates TIME-ERROR (temporal rejection) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking timelessness) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (timeless vs temporal). The practitioner tries to stop the clock.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, DEPENDENT-ORIGINATION-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes dependent origination through twelve links from ignorance to aging-dying. A reader might think: "This is the mechanism of samsara. If I can understand and break any link, I can stop the whole process."

WHY IT ARISES:
Mechanistic explanations appeal to Western engineering minds. The chain metaphor suggests weak links to target. Understanding seems like control.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes dependent origination mechanically, seeking to identify and break specific links in the chain.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dependent origination is treated as machine
2. Intervention points are targeted
3. Natural flow is resisted
4. Dzogchen becomes mechanical engineering

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates DEPENDENT-ORIGINATION-ERROR (mechanistic thinking) → PRACTICE ERROR (link-breaking) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (samsara as machine). The practitioner becomes a spiritual mechanic.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, BARDO-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the bardo process: "life one even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first self face not-know is ignorance outer breath cut time die by that interval dependent-origination manner enters." A reader might think: "This is the actual process of death and bardo I will experience. I must prepare now so I can recognize when it happens."

WHY IT ARISES:
Death is universally feared. The detailed description promises preparation. Future-oriented Westerners want to plan for death.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner anxiously prepares for death and bardo, trying to memorize the stages for future recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Present recognition is abandoned for future preparation
2. Death anxiety drives practice
3. Bardo is feared as real transition
4. Living is missed while preparing for dying

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates BARDO-ERROR (future fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (death preparation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (future recognition). The practitioner lives for their death.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, EMPTY-FIVE-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists "aggregates five and faculties five limbs five and essences five objects five and afflictions five minds five mentals five thoughts five grasped-grasper samsara accomplished." A reader might think: "All these fives are just empty constructions. None of them are real. I should dismiss all this analysis as mere samsaric fabrication."

WHY IT ARISES:
The repetitive "five" and "accomplished" suggests empty construction. Western nihilists use emptiness to dismiss. The lists seem like mere enumeration.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner dismisses all five-fold analysis as empty fabrication, missing the precise pointing within the enumeration.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Lists are rejected without understanding
2. Nihilism masquerades as emptiness wisdom
3. Detailed analysis is abandoned
4. Dzogchen becomes dismissal

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates EMPTY-FIVE-ERROR (nihilistic dismissal) → PRACTICE ERROR (avoiding analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (emptiness as rejection). The practitioner emptily dismisses all.
