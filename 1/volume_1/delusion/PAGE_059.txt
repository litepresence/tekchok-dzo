ERROR TYPE 1: [360 WRONG VIEWS OBSESSION] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The enumeration of 360 wrong views (sum brgya drug cu) derived from the basis (dbyings) is interpreted as establishing a comprehensive taxonomy of errors that the practitioner must study, memorize, and avoid, rather than recognizing that all wrong views share the same root—grasping to extremes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Academic mind seeks comprehensive catalogs. The practitioner assumes detailed knowledge protects against error. The extensive enumeration invites systematic study. Fear of wrong view drives comprehensive analysis.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner becomes a wrong-view expert, memorizing all 360 variations without recognizing their common root. Time is spent cataloging errors rather than recognizing mind nature. Study replaces practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Scholastic arrogance develops. The practitioner can enumerate all wrong views while holding subtle versions themselves. Others are judged by their doctrinal correctness. The transformative purpose is lost in pedantic mastery.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This feeds [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] where genuine practice is deferred until "all wrong views are understood." It generates [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] where the practitioner feels superior for knowing the complete taxonomy.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 2: [BASIS-DERIVED DELUSION CONFUSION] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The presentation that all beings arise from, abide in, and dissolve back into the basis/elemental sphere ('byung ba'i dbyings) is interpreted as establishing a metaphysical substrate or ground of being from which phenomena emerge, rather than recognizing the basis as a conventional designation for the ungraspable nature of mind.

WHY IT ARISES:
Metaphysical thinking seeks ultimate ground. The language of "arising from" suggests causal substrate. The practitioner wants an ontological foundation. Both science and religion posit fundamental grounds.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The basis becomes a new metaphysical absolute. The practitioner grasps to "elemental sphere" as ultimate reality. The emptiness of the basis itself is missed. One ground replaces another.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner believes they have found "the source of everything." Spiritual materialism develops around basis-realization. Others are judged by their recognition or non-recognition of this ground.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [VIEW COLLAPSE] where conceptual understanding of basis replaces direct recognition. It generates [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] where contacting the basis is believed to mechanically produce liberation.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 3: [LIBERATION AS DISSOLUTION FETISH] [PRACTICE ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The view that liberation consists in dissolving back into the basis ('byung ba'i dbyings su yal), with no return to samsara, is interpreted as a metaphysical claim about the nature of liberation, rather than recognizing that liberation is not a state of dissolution but freedom from all concepts including dissolution.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual escapism seeks final rest. The language of "dissolving" suggests peaceful end. The practitioner wants permanent escape from samsara. Death and dissolution are associated with rest.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Liberation becomes a state of cosmic dissolution. The practitioner pursues disappearance into the basis as goal. The dynamic, responsive nature of enlightened activity is lost in favor of static absorption.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fear of engagement develops. The practitioner avoids relationships and responsibilities. "Just dissolving into the basis" becomes spiritual bypassing. Compassionate activity is rejected as "samsaric return."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where liberation is confused with annihilation. It generates [SUTRA DISMISSAL] when the practitioner rejects Mahayana emphasis on compassionate return as inferior to "final dissolution."

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 4: [WRONG VIEW CATEGORIZATION PRIDE] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The detailed categorization of wrong views into eternalist types (20), nihilist types (20), and sub-variations (Samkhya, Vaisesika, Lokayata, etc.) is interpreted as demonstrating the superiority of Buddhist taxonomy, encouraging the practitioner to master these classifications as evidence of spiritual development.

WHY IT ARISES:
Intellectual achievement signals competence. The practitioner wants measurable progress. Educational systems reward categorical mastery. Religious identity requires distinction through knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner becomes a comparative religion scholar rather than Dharma practitioner. Time is invested in learning Indian philosophical systems. Recognition of mind nature is deferred indefinitely.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Academic pride develops. "I know all six systems of Indian philosophy" becomes identity-marker. The practitioner looks down on "simple practitioners" who haven't studied wrong views. Authentic humility is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This feeds [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] where scholarly mastery is equated with spiritual attainment. It produces [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY] where recognition is deferred until "all philosophical study is complete."

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 5: [EXTREME VIEW BINARY TRAP] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The clear division between eternalist views (rtag par smra ba) and nihilist views (chad par smra ba) is interpreted as establishing a binary classification system where Buddhist middle way occupies a third position between them, rather than recognizing that the middle way transcends the very framework of extremes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Binary thinking seeks clear categories. The middle appears as compromise between opposites. Western logic emphasizes non-contradiction. The practitioner assumes truth lies between extremes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The middle way becomes a new extreme—the "correct" position between wrong positions. The freedom from all positions is missed. Subtle attachment to "Buddhist correctness" replaces gross attachment to extremes.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner defends "middle way" as doctrinal position. Debates with eternalists and nihilists become about proving the middle correct. The inexpressible nature of wisdom is lost in defense of concept.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [VIEW COLLAPSE] where conceptual middle way replaces direct recognition. It generates [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] where the practitioner teaches others to "avoid extremes" while remaining trapped in subtle conceptualization.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS
================================================================================

PREVIOUS PAGE (58) CONTEXT:
Page 58 presented the Lokayata nihilist view. Page 59 continues with wrong view analysis, presenting the 360 wrong views derived from the basis and beginning systematic categorization of eternalist and nihilist positions.

NEXT PAGE (60) ANTICIPATION:
The text will likely complete the wrong view categorization and begin transitioning to the presentation of correct Buddhist views, specifically the Sravaka vehicle as the entry point to transcendent Dharma.

CRITICAL CONTINUITY POINT:
The extensive wrong view taxonomy serves pedagogical purposes—to demonstrate the profusion of conceptual errors. The practitioner must not become fascinated with the taxonomy itself but recognize all errors as variations on grasping to extremes.

BLEED RISK:
Very High. The detailed categorization invites scholarly obsession. The 360 views suggest comprehensive study is required. The practitioner may finish this section as a wrong-view expert who has never recognized mind nature.
