[EMPOWERMENT ERROR] [INITIATION OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the threefold empowerment structure (basis, path, result) as establishing formal initiations as necessary prerequisites for practice, externalizing authority into ritual transmission.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numbered structure (three) combined with "empower" (dbang bskur) triggers institutional ritual parsing. Religious authorization habits support this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that recognition is immediately available is subordinated to institutional validation. The reader waits for proper initiation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Guru relationships become transactional (pay for empowerment) rather than transformational. Practice is deferred until proper authorization is obtained.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle of self-recognition is entirely lost in institutional dependencies.

[GURU IDEALIZATION ERROR] [PERFECTIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the description of guru qualities ("suitable quality all complete fault all free") as establishing that teachers must be perfect beings, creating impossible standards or enabling guru abuse through unquestioning acceptance.

WHY IT ARISES:
The list of perfect qualities triggers idealization. The desire for perfect guidance supports either impossible expectations or uncritical devotion.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Either all teachers are rejected as imperfect, or imperfect teachers are followed blindly. Discernment is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Guru abuse is enabled or all spiritual guidance is rejected. The middle way of intelligent faith is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that the guru is one's own nature is entirely missed.
