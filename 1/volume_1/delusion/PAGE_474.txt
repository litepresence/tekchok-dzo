[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The first fifteen examples (dpe bco lnga) comparing Buddha-sentient beings to head-horns, recognition-ignorance to water-drawing and water-bubbles, wisdom-mind to gold-copper, and alaya-dharmakaya to ocean-boat are interpreted as ontological claims about metaphysical structures.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative language triggers literal interpretation. Examples suggest ontological parallels. The practitioner assumes analogies indicate realities rather than recognition-pointers.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-pointer function of examples is lost. Examples become metaphysical claims. The practitioner literalizes all analogies, creating example-ontology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Head-horns" becomes structural theory about Buddha-nature. "Water-drawing" becomes ontological hierarchy. The practitioner collects example-interpretations as doctrine rather than recognizing what they point to.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 475-476's remaining examples. Each becomes another ontological claim. By PAGE 477-478's 'dra'o 'dra'o verses, all metaphors are substantialized.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The examples are interpreted as establishing subtle phenomenological distinctions accessible only to superior practitioners who can "see through" the examples.

WHY IT ARISES:
Subtle example-usage suggests sophistication. "Fifteen" implies comprehensive coverage. The practitioner wants superior example-mastery.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-without-example-mastery nature is lost. Example-comprehension becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition lacks example-sophistication.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Example-master" becomes exclusive identity. Those missing example-nuance are deemed coarse. The authentic recognition that examples are pedagogical tools is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 475-476's remaining examples. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "mastered" examples without recognition.

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The examples comparing liberation-delusion to sleep-waking, or recognition-wisdom to wax-sun contact, are interpreted as establishing correct versus incorrect experiences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative structure triggers evaluation. "Sleep-waking" suggests clarity-levels. The practitioner assumes examples indicate experience-requirements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is replaced by example-matching. The practitioner seeks "gold-like" versus "copper-like" experiences. Achievement-anxiety consumes practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Example-orthodoxy emerges. Teachers validating specific example-experiences gain authority. The authentic recognition that examples don't matter is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 475-476's examples. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by example-chasing.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The first fifteen examples section triggers "halfway through examples" mentality. The practitioner wants to "get through" all examples and reach colophon.

WHY IT ARISES:
Example-density creates fatigue. Sequential structure suggests curriculum. The practitioner wants "done with examples."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-function of examples is missed. The practitioner has "read" examples without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern. Remaining examples are skimmed. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "after examples."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 475-476's remaining examples are not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's power.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "sleep and waking" comparison for delusion and liberation is interpreted as literal claim about consciousness-states rather than recognition-metaphor.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sleep-waking is familiar framework. "Waking" suggests clarity. The practitioner assumes familiar metaphors indicate literal processes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical nature of sleep-comparison is lost. Liberation becomes "waking up" literally. The practitioner seeks literal awakening-experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Awakening experiences" become goals. Teachers promising "waking" validation gain authority. The authentic recognition that waking is metaphorical is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 475-476's remaining examples. Sleep-metaphor is reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "awakened" conceptually without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The example-literalism on this page carries to PAGE 475's remaining examples and PAGE 476's comparisons. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with example-knowledge but without recognition.
