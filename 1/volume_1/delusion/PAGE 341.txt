[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL VITAL POINT SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The channels (rtsa) are actual physical structures that serve as "vital points" (gnad) or mechanical supports for the body.

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 13955: "lus kyi gnad ni rtsa yin te" (the body's vital point is the channel), and extensive descriptions of channel functions throughout lines 13955-13970.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing channels as anatomical entities rather than wisdom-display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to locate channels through dissection or medical imaging.
Missing that channels are the natural flow of awareness, not physical tubes.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ANATOMICAL REDUCTIONISM ERROR]

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EIGHTFOLD TOPIC LITERALISM]

MISREADING:
The eight topics listed (name, purification, indication, generation manner, action, essence, reality nature, instruction) are definitive categories that must be studied sequentially.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 13971-13979: "'di'i don bstan pa la brgyad de/rtsa'i ming dang/dag byed dang/mtshon pa dang/skyed tshul dang/lags gang byed pa dang/ngo bo dang/chos nyid dang/ji ltar sbyang ba'i man ngag go" (eight to show this meaning: channel's name, purification, indication, generation manner, accomplish cause-do, essence, reality nature, instruction).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Intellectual study of categories rather than direct recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Accumulating knowledge about channels without recognizing their nature.
Missing that all topics are conventional designations pointing to single nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PEDAGOGICAL OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

[NUMERICAL LITERALISM] [CHANNEL ENUMERATION OBSESSION]

MISREADING:
The enumeration of 72,000 channels or 472 channels in the four wheels represents an actual inventory of vessels to be memorized.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 13986-13993: "spyir rtsa stong phrag bdun cu rtsa gnyis...bzhi brgya bdun cu rtsa gnyis su gnas pa" (generally 72,000 channels...472 abiding).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Memorizing numbers as if they were spiritually significant facts.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual proliferation about channel counts.
Missing that numbers are pedagogical devices, not reality.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[QUANTITATIVE OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [THREE CHANNEL LIFE-PILLAR REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
The three central channels (Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma) are like actual life-pillars (srog shing) or supports that hold up the body-mind system.

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 13994: "rtsa gsum srog shing ltar drang zing 'khyog med par 'byung ba" (three channels like life-pillar, straight and without crooks, arise).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing channels as structural supports.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to "strengthen" or "straighten" channels.
Missing that channels are naturally perfect without needing support.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ARCHITECTURAL OBSTRUCTION ERROR]
