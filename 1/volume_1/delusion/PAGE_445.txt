[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed "essential points" (*གནད་) for channels, winds, and wisdom are interpreted as a graduated practice curriculum—specific techniques to be applied sequentially to achieve thodgal visions and stabilize wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
Systematic enumeration (gathering, dissolving, holding) triggers procedural reading. "Essential point" sounds like crucial technique. Western practitioners habitually transform phenomenological descriptions into meditation manuals.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Trekcho/thodgal becomes complex wind-energy (*རླུང་) and bindu (*ཐིག་ལེ་) manipulation practice. The direct recognition of rigpa is buried under technique. Natural self-arising is replaced by deliberate effort to "cause" experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Body's luster and radiance" (*ལུས་ཀྱི་བཀྲག་དང་གཟི་མདངས་) becomes something to enhance through practice. "Wisdom moistening" (*ཡེ་ཤེས་བརླན་གྱིས་ཁྱབ་) is interpreted as technique-result. The five kāyas and five wisdoms become achievements rather than natural display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where specific experiences (*སྣང་བ*) become progress markers. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows as these practices are equated with tantric completion stage. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates—years of technique taught before " Dzogchen proper."

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The description of kāya through essential point of resonance, wisdom through posture, bindu through circulation, and light through expansion/contraction is interpreted through tantric framework—as completion stage practices for generating the deity.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical terminology (*གདངས་, *འདུག་སྟངས་, *བསྐྱིལ་, *དཀྲུགས་) overlaps with completion stage vocabulary. Practitioners familiar with tantra unconsciously project its logic onto Dzogchen. The list structure suggests sequential practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen view collapses into highest yoga tantra. Trekcho becomes dissolution practice; thodgal becomes generation of light-experiences. The distinction of Atiyoga as direct path beyond cause and effect is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Holding, releasing, guiding" (*བསྡོམས་, *དབྱུང་, *གཏད་) are interpreted as wind-control techniques. "Expanse's essential point" (*དབྱིངས་ཀྱི་གནད་) becomes another manipulation target. Natural luminosity is replaced by fabricated experiences.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] produces [PRACTICE ERROR] where students spend years on wind-bindu practices before being introduced to direct recognition. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows as texts are interpreted through tantric hermeneutics. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of four wheels (*འཁོར་ལོ་བཞི་) and three mothers (*མ་གསུམ་) supporting the body and maturing the lamp is interpreted as literal anatomy to be mastered through physical manipulation—pressing, rubbing, and channel-control.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical specificity triggers literal reading. Terms like "pressing essential point" (*གནད་གཅུན་) suggest physical action. Western body-oriented spirituality interprets these as somatic practices.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes physical yoga—pressing points, rubbing channels, manipulating winds. The recognition of mind's nature is obscured by body-focus. "Maturing the lamp" becomes somatic achievement rather than recognition deepening.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The three kāyas are treated as products of channel-manipulation. "Wisdom fire ceasing" (*ཡེ་ཤེས་འགག་) is interpreted as result of physical technique. Natural self-liberation (*རང་གྲོལ་) is replaced by deliberate effort.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] where thodgal is reduced to advanced kuṇḍalinī practice. [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] follows as subtle body is reified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as physical prerequisites multiply.
