[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Unmade dawns instantly" is interpreted as achievement through inaction or passive waiting rather than recognition of spontaneous presence.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Not made" suggests non-doing. Misunderstanding of effortless approach supports passive interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is confused with laziness or inaction. The dynamic recognition is replaced by passive waiting.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner does nothing and calls it practice. The precise pointing to recognition is lost in vague "non-doing."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LAZINESS ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Self-arising self-liberated" is understood as excuse for not practicing or as license for unexamined behavior.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Self-liberated" suggests no effort needed. Misunderstanding of spontaneous liberation supports antinomian reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that recognition liberates is replaced by belief that everything is already fine. Practice becomes unnecessary.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner remains in ordinary delusion while claiming Dzogchen view. The distinction between delusion and recognition is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SELF-DECEPTION ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Iron house without doors" is interpreted as actual prison or hell realm rather than symbol for the body-mind's apparent confinement.

WHY IT ARISES:
House imagery suggests dwelling place. "Without doors" suggests inescapable prison.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that apparent confinement is the display of rig pa is lost. The body-mind becomes obstacle rather than display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner feels trapped by embodiment. The liberating recognition of bodily experience is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EMBODIMENT ERROR] and [SPATIALIZATION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Sun and moon not seen" is understood as literal darkness or sensory deprivation rather than teaching on the unobstructed nature of awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Not seen" suggests absence. Sensory deprivation practices condition this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that awareness transcends yet includes all perception is replaced by cultivation of darkness or sensory restriction.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks sensory deprivation rather than recognition. The natural clarity of awareness is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SENSORY ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].
