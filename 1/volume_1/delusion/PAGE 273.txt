[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the display as immeasurable, inconceivable great Dharma, with all lights and forms naturally arranged in majestic spontaneous presence. A reader might think: "This is describing the actual appearance of the base - a vast, majestic, luminous display that's the true nature of reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
Awe-inspiring descriptions evoke yearning. We imagine a reality more beautiful and profound than ordinary experience. This becomes the "real" world we seek to perceive.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the description as the "true" appearance of reality. Ordinary experience is dismissed in favor of seeking this majestic, luminous display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying majestic display as real reality
2. Seeking visions of luminous arrangement
3. Disdaining ordinary appearances as inferior
4. Missing that majesty is in the seeing, not the seen

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (majestic display as real) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking visions) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (hierarchical reality). The practitioner seeks majesty.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes "Mu tig phreng ba" with poetic descriptions: clarity manifest, display spontaneously present, Dharma-kaya beyond introduction, essence naturally free, nature all-pervading. A reader might think: "This tantra reveals the actual characteristics of the display - clarity, spontaneous presence, natural freedom, all-pervasion."

WHY IT ARISES:
Poetic tantric language seems authoritative and descriptive. The specific characteristics (clarity, freedom, pervasion) seem like technical descriptions of enlightened qualities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats tantric poetry as technical specifications. "Naturally free" becomes a property of essence, "all-pervading" a characteristic of nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing tantric qualities as properties
2. Seeking experiences matching descriptions
3. Debating which tantra is most descriptive
4. Missing that poetry evokes, not specifies

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (poetry as technical specs) → REIFICATION ERROR (qualities as properties) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking specific qualities). The practitioner seeks specifications.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes how this display becomes the ground for samsara and nirvana, how compassion gives rise to impure appearance. A reader might think: "This explains the origin of delusion - how the pure display becomes impure samsara. This is the fall from primordial purity."

WHY IT ARISES:
Origin stories satisfy our need for narrative. The "fall" from purity to impurity is a familiar archetype. We imagine a primordial state that was lost or corrupted.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a narrative of the Fall - from pure display to impure samsara. This becomes a cosmological drama of primordial purity corrupted by confusion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mourning the lost primordial purity
2. Seeking to restore original state
3. Viewing samsara as corruption of purity
4. Missing that purity was never lost

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (Fall narrative) → PRACTICE ERROR (restoration project) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (nostalgia for origin). The practitioner seeks return to Eden.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text continues with extensive poetic descriptions from tantras, listing qualities like vast, spontaneous, clear, unceasing, complete. A reader might think: "This is the comprehensive description of the base's qualities. These are the definitive attributes of reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive lists suggest completeness. We assume that accumulating all these qualities gives us the full picture. Scholarly completeness masquerades as wisdom.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner compiles lists of the base's qualities. This becomes an encyclopedic project - cataloging all the characteristics of ultimate reality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Accumulating quality lists
2. Comparing descriptions across sources
3. Competing in comprehensive cataloging
4. Missing that qualities are imputed, not inherent

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (quality cataloging) → REIFICATION ERROR (qualities as attributes) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (completeness as wisdom). The practitioner catalogs reality.
