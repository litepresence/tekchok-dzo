[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PHYSICAL REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Channels (rtsa), winds (rlung), and pristine awareness are physical anatomical structures.

WHY IT ARISES:
Literal interpretation of body-based terminology (lus, rtsa, rlung) and color descriptions (ljang gu, dkar po, dmar ba).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Searching for physical channels identical to medical nervous or circulatory systems.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Confusing subtle body anatomy with gross physiology.
Attempting to locate channels through dissection or imaging.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EMBRYOLOGICAL LITERALISM ERROR]
[SUBTLE BODY MATERIALIZATION ERROR]

[TEMPORAL LITERALISM] [KALPA CALCULATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Time references (zhag bdun - seven days) indicate precise chronological measurements of embryonic development.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential day counts (seven-day periods) resemble modern embryological timelines.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Attempting to correlate Buddhist embryology with Western developmental biology week-by-week.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Invalidating the text when correlations fail.
Missing symbolic significance of septenary cycles in completion stage practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

---

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TRIKAYA REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
The three kayas (sku gsum) exist as localized entities within the body at specific developmental stages.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 13268-13270 describe arising, abiding, and cessation knowing leading to dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya certainties.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Believing one must sequentially develop each kaya in temporal order.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the simultaneous nature of the three kayas.
Temporalizing what is atemporal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MEDITATION PROGRESS ERROR]
