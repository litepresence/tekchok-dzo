[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYSTEMATIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the "ground type five" and "abode type three" as establishing a fixed typological system where all phenomena must fit into predetermined categories, treating these enumerations as exhaustive taxonomies rather than pedagogic devices.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numbered lists (five, three) present with grammatical definiteness (-ni, -ste) that suggests established categories. Academic training in classification systems reinforces reading enumerations as taxonomies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The fluid, context-dependent nature of these teachings is lost. The reader becomes fixated on matching phenomena to categories rather than recognizing the direct pointing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Experience is forced into pre-existing frameworks rather than allowed to disclose its own nature. The spontaneity of wisdom recognition is replaced by categorical thinking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings are processed through this typological filter, producing a rigidified Dzogchen of categories and subcategories.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [DIALECTICAL MISREADING]

MISREADING:
Reader takes phrases like "grasping self purified dharmakāya by" as establishing an identity between grasping and dharmakāya, concluding that ordinary deluded grasping is itself dharmakāya when viewed correctly.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure uses instrumental case (-gyis) that can be read as establishing equivalence. The radical Dzogchen rhetoric of "self-purified" and "self-arisen" suggests that no transformation is needed.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The path structure collapses. No distinction is made between ordinary delusion and wisdom. Practice is abandoned under the guise of "already complete."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The specific methods for recognizing the nature of grasping are ignored because grasping is already considered "pure." Delusion is validated rather than transcended.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The reader develops an anti-practice stance that rejects all methods while remaining thoroughly deluded. This becomes a particularly seductive and destructive error.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader understands the description of saṃbhogakāya as positing an actual paradise realm with actual light rays, self-arisen letters, and non-physical speech that exist as subtle material phenomena.

WHY IT ARISES:
The vivid imagery of "five lights," "pure light rays tongue spread," and "self-arisen letter six" creates a quasi-material visualization that seems to describe an actual place or state.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The formless nature of saṃbhogakāya is lost. It becomes an objectified subtle realm to be accessed or visualized rather than the self-display of wisdom.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes visualization of lights and letters rather than recognition of the nature of appearance. Form is pursued at the expense of emptiness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Tögal practice degenerates into light-show pursuit. The recognition that these appearances are one's own nature is replaced by seeking special experiences.

[NOMINALISM ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets "emanation-body attachment without" and "doctrine also disciple-of self-abode-from" as teaching that nirmāṇakāya teachings are somehow inferior because adapted to disciples, failing to recognize their complete sufficiency.

WHY IT ARISES:
The phrase "attachment without" can be read as "without attachment" (positive) or "devoid of attachment" (incomplete). The locative "from self-abode" suggests limitation to the disciple's capacity rather than appropriate manifestation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Nirmāṇakāya teachings are devalued in favor of seeking "higher" saṃbhogakāya or dharmakāya teachings. The accessibility of complete teaching in ordinary form is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The reader becomes dissatisfied with ordinary dharma, seeking esoteric or secret teachings. Guru relationships become transactional rather than transformational.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle of "ordinary mind" is rejected in favor of pursuit of extraordinary states. The path becomes increasingly complex and elitist.

[SOTERIOLOGICAL ERROR] [FUNCTIONALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets "sentient beings awakening-mind-saviors and buddhas all-of mind satisfied" as establishing that the purpose of teaching is satisfaction or wish-fulfillment, reducing dharma to a means of gratifying spiritual desires.

WHY IT ARISES:
The phrase "hopes fulfill" (re smon 'grub) uses commercial metaphorics (transaction, fulfillment) that readers familiar with prosperity gospel or self-help frameworks easily assimilate.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dharma becomes a consumer product tailored to preferences. The challenging or difficult aspects of practice that don't satisfy immediate desires are rejected.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The transformative potential of disillusionment is lost. Practice becomes about feeling good or getting what one wants rather than fundamental transformation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition of suffering's nature is avoided. The first noble truth becomes merely a preliminary rather than a continuous reference point.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [AUTHORITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the multiple explanations of "thus I heard" (compiler hearing from Samantabhadra OR compiler being the teacher accepted by retinue) as evidence of textual inconsistency or competing traditions, rather than recognizing multiple valid perspectives.

WHY IT ARISES:
Historical-critical methodology trains readers to identify variants as evidence of textual development rather than as intentional multivalence. The "or" ('am) is read as disjunctive indecision.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The text's authority is undermined by apparent internal contradiction. The reader begins reading suspiciously rather than with confidence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The principle of multiple valid perspectives is lost. The reader seeks to determine "what really happened" rather than recognizing the event's dimensionality.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All teachings are approached with hermeneutic suspicion. The direct pointing function is neutralized by interpretive hesitation.
