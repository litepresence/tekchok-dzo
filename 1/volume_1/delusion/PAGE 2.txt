[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The five perfections describe an objective paradise or heaven where teachings occur.

WHY IT ARISES:
Concrete spatial imagery invites literalization. Terms like "field" and "throne" suggest physical locations.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Sambhogakaya is mistaken for a place rather than a modality of appearance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Seeking external pure lands rather than recognizing inherent purity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[REIFICATION ERROR] and [PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY].
