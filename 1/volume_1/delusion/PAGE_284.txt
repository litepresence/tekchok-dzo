[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes base-appearance as light clarity manifesting, with spontaneous presence's appearance as "kaya like manifest-do bundle-is" and wisdom and light gathering. A reader might think: "The base projects appearances like light. Spontaneous presence bundles them into kayas. I need to recognize this display as my own projection."

WHY IT ARISES:
Projection metaphors resonate with Western psychology. The description of base-appearance as light manifestation suggests a projector-display relationship. The practitioner imagines themselves as the source of the display.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as a projector and appearances as its light-display. They attempt to "recognize projections" psychologically, understanding everything as their own mind's display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Base becomes an ultimate projector
2. Recognition becomes psychological insight
3. "Self-face" is understood as personal identity
4. The non-personal nature of rigpa is missed

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (projection psychology) → REIFICATION ERROR (base as projector) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (personal recognition instead of rigpa). The practitioner solipsistically claims everything as "my projection."

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the "third" as base-to-dissolve-mode, with appearances dissolving like dreams upon waking. A reader might think: "Dissolution is the goal—making appearances cease into the base. I should practice dissolving appearances back into their source."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Dissolve" suggests a process of absorption or return. The dream metaphor suggests waking up from illusion. Westerners interpret this as making phenomena disappear into emptiness or source.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to "dissolve" appearances into the base through meditation, seeking their cessation or absorption. They mistake dissolution of delusion for making appearances vanish.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Meditation becomes about dissolving phenomena
2. Appearances are seen as obstacles to dissolve
3. The vivid display is rejected for blankness
4. Self-liberation is replaced with dissolution

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PRACTICE ERROR (dissolving appearances) → NIHILISTIC ERROR (rejecting display) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking cessation). The practitioner dissolves into spaced-out confusion.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "action conduct all nirvana" and "not-done action-do appearance not-exist-therefore," with examples of sun rays, mirror appearances, and sky rainbow all self-dissolving. A reader might think: "All actions are already nirvana because they're empty. I don't need to do anything special since everything naturally dissolves."

WHY IT ARISES:
"All nirvana" and "not-done" are interpreted as license for inaction. The beautiful examples of natural dissolution suggest that effort is unnecessary. Western practitioners want spiritual excuses for laziness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner believes no action is needed since everything is already nirvana. They abandon effort, practice, and virtue, claiming naturalness while remaining ordinary.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. All discipline is abandoned
2. Ordinary behavior is justified as "natural"
3. The distinction between confusion and liberation is denied
4. Gradual accumulation is rejected

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates NIHILISTIC ERROR (denying need for effort) → PRACTICE ERROR (abandoning method) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching effortless license). The practitioner becomes a spiritual sloth.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "self pure emptiness great-from color self-grasp nirvana" and "awareness grasping-thought recollection thought self-abide equality expanse-to." A reader might think: "I need to rest awareness in the expanse of equality, free from grasping and recollection. This is the meditation practice."

WHY IT ARISES:
Phrases like "self-abide equality expanse" sound like meditation instructions. Westerners convert descriptions into prescriptions automatically. The mention of "grasping" and "recollection" suggests what to abandon in practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a meditation of "resting in equality," trying to stop grasping and recollection. They reify "expanse" as a container to rest within and "equality" as a state to achieve.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Meditation on "expanse" becomes fixation
2. Equality is manufactured through suppression
3. Natural rigpa is replaced with artificial calm
4. Spontaneity is lost in controlled meditation

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MEDITATIONISM ERROR (manufactured equality) → REIFICATION ERROR (expanse as container) → PRACTICE ERROR (suppression instead of liberation). The practitioner meditates themselves into stupor.
