[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [NAVAL WHEEL SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The navel emanation wheel (lte ba sprul pa'i 'khor lo) is an actual structure with 64 petals containing specific channels.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14314-14316: "rtsa gnas 'khor lo las/sprul 'khor 'dab ma drug cu bzhi" (from channel-located wheel, emanation wheel 64 petals).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing the wheel as architectural structure.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Visualizing or constructing the wheel in meditation.
Missing that the wheel is the natural state itself.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VISUALIZATION CONSTRUCTION ERROR]

[NUMERICAL LITERALISM] [CHANNEL COUNT OBSESSION]

MISREADING:
The precise numbers of channels (64 main, countless branches, 32 inner, etc.) represent actual inventories to be memorized.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14305-14313: Detailed enumeration: "rtsa ba'i rtsa 'dab drug chu rtsa bzhi...nyis stong bzhi brgya dang sum cu rtsa gnyis" (root channel petal 64...2400 and 32).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Memorizing quantities as spiritual knowledge.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual proliferation about channel counts.
Missing that all numbers are conventional designations.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[QUANTITATIVE OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ELEMENT-CHANNEL CORRESPONDENCE MAPPING]

MISREADING:
The correspondences between elements and channels (earth channels, water channels, etc.) represent actual classifications of vessel types.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14317-14336: Systematic mapping of elements to channel functions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing element-channel correspondences as ontologically real.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to locate element-specific channels.
Missing that elements and channels are non-dual wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[CORRESPONDENCE MAPPING ERROR]
