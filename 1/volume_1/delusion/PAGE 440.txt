[TATHAGATAGARBHA ERROR] [BUDDHA-NATURE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18661-18685 extensively quote tathagatagarbha scriptures (Tathagatagarbha Sutra, Uttaratantra, Saraha's Doha) stating all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature. The reader reifies Buddha-nature as an actual entity, essence, or latent capacity within beings.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "Buddha-nature" (sangs rgyas kyi snying po) and phrases like "all sentient beings are Buddhas" suggest possession of an inner essence, seed, or potential. Language naturally substantializes. The scriptural authority makes these claims difficult to question.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature becomes reified as a hidden treasure, true self, permanent essence, or latent capacity waiting to manifest. The emptiness of Buddha-nature—even Buddha-nature is empty, not a thing—is completely missed in favor of eternalistic interpretation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may search for their "inner Buddha," creating subtle self-grasping. They may assume they are "already perfect" and need do nothing, missing the distinction between basis and recognition. Or they may believe they must "actualize" their latent Buddha-nature through effort and practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TREASURE HUNTING ERROR] where Buddha-nature is sought as object, [ETERNALISM ERROR] where emptiness is reified as essence, [LATENT ERROR] where potential is grasped, [ACTUALIZATION ERROR] where nature must be made manifest, and [PASSIVITY ERROR] where "already Buddha" justifies inaction.

[VEILING ERROR] [OBSCURATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18686-18705 explain why Buddha-nature isn't seen—"covered by bodily obscurations" (sgrib g.yogs) and "affliction-obscurations"—and compare it to the sun covered by clouds. The reader understands this as describing real veils that need removal through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The metaphor of covering/obscuring naturally suggests layers to be peeled away. The comparison to sun and clouds reinforces the sense of something hidden behind something else. We are familiar with removing covers to reveal what is beneath.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual nature of ground and ignorance is completely missed. What is actually co-emergent—neither earlier nor later, neither before nor after—appears as sequential: first Buddha-nature, then covering, then uncovering through practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to "remove veils" through various practices—purification, accumulation, meditation—creating new forms of doing and achievement. The natural, effortless nature of recognition is obscured by the effort to clean, clear, or unveil.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURIFICATION ERROR] where practice becomes cleansing, [LAYERS ERROR] where reality appears stratified into true nature and obscurations, [REMOVAL ERROR] where defilements are seen as eliminable, and [EFFORT ERROR] where doing increases.

[CLOUD ERROR] [COVERING ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18686-18705 specifically compare Buddha-nature covered by obscurations to "the sun covered by clouds." The reader literalizes this as accurate description of the relationship between Buddha-nature and afflictions.

WHY IT ARISES:
The sun-cloud metaphor is vivid, universally understood, and seems precise. We have all seen sun hidden by clouds.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphor is literalized: Buddha-nature is like sun (always there, luminous), obscurations are like clouds (temporary, removable), practice is like wind (blows clouds away).

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may wait for "clouds to clear" or try to "blow them away." The metaphor that should liberate becomes new conceptual prison.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [METAPHOR LITERALISM] and [WAITING ERROR].

[RECOGNITION ERROR] [SEEING ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18706-18720 discuss how Buddha-nature is seen when obscurations are cleared. The reader understands this as describing actual visual or cognitive recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Language of seeing and recognition suggests perceptual act.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is objectified as something that happens. The understanding that recognition is not an act but the end of confusion is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners try to "see" Buddha-nature or achieve recognition as experience.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] and [ATTAINMENT ERROR].

---

[CONCLUSION ERROR] [SUMMARY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18715-18720 conclude the section with summary statements. The reader treats these as definitive final positions.

WHY IT ARISES:
Conclusions appear to summarize established truth.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Provisional nature of all statements is forgotten.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners cling to summary as final view.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [DOGMATISM ERROR] and [FIXATION ERROR].

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 440 concludes the section on Buddha-nature and wisdom. This page completes the arc from mind and afflictions through wisdom types to Buddha-nature. The tathagatagarbha theme serves as capstone to the section. The extensive use of metaphor throughout these pages (sun/clouds, moon phases, water/waves, etc.) requires consistent recognition as pointing language. The reification risks established in pages 421-439 culminate here and must be seen through.
