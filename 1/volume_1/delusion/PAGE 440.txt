[TATHAGATAGARBHA ERROR] [BUDDHA-NATURE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18661-18685: The text extensively quotes tathagatagarbha scriptures (Tathagatagarbha Sutra, Uttaratantra, Doha) stating all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature. One might reify Buddha-nature as an actual entity or essence within beings.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "Buddha-nature" (sangs rgyas kyi snying po) and phrases like "all sentient beings are Buddhas" suggest possession of an inner essence. Language naturally substantializes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature is reified as a hidden treasure, true self, or latent capacity. The emptiness of Buddha-nature (even Buddha-nature is empty) is missed in favor of eternalistic interpretation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may search for their "inner Buddha," creating subtle self-grasping. Or they may assume they are "already perfect" and need do nothing, missing the distinction between basis and recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TREASURE HUNTING ERROR] where Buddha-nature is sought as object, and [ETERNALISM ERROR] where emptiness is reified as permanent essence.

[VEILING ERROR] [OBSCURATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18686-18705: The text explains why Buddha-nature isn't seen—"covered by bodily obscurations"—and compares it to the sun covered by clouds. One might understand this as describing real veils that need removal.

WHY IT ARISES:
The metaphor of covering/obscuring naturally suggests layers to be peeled away. The comparison to sun and clouds reinforces the sense of something hidden behind something else.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual nature of ground and ignorance is missed. What is actually co-emergent appears as sequential: first Buddha-nature, then covering, then uncovering.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to "remove veils" through various practices, creating new forms of doing and achievement. The natural, effortless nature of recognition is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURIFICATION ERROR] where practice becomes cleansing, and [LAYERS ERROR] where reality appears stratified into true nature and obscurations.
