[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "kun gzhi" (all-basis/alaya) as a universal substrate or cosmic storehouse consciousness that contains all phenomena.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Kun" (all) and "gzhi" (basis) suggest a universal ground. Students imagine a cosmic storage system for all experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The neutral basis of delusion is reified into a cosmic consciousness. The distinction between kun gzhi and dharmakaya is blurred.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students develop mystical views about a universal mind. The path of distinguishing pure from impure basis is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC view of cosmic consciousness, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between basis and nature, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of universal mind theories.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding the distinction between "kun gzhi" and "chos sku" (dharmakaya) as a philosophical problem to be solved through conceptual analysis.

WHY IT ARISES:
The teaching presents a distinction that requires clarification. The scholarly mind assumes this is an intellectual problem.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct recognition is replaced by philosophical analysis. Students debate the relationship between basis and nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes study of philosophical distinctions. The simplicity of distinguishing pure from impure recognition is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with kun gzhi theory, then to PEDAGOGICAL focus on intellectual clarity, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of the distinction itself.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "ma rig pa" (ignorance) as something to be eliminated through effort, like removing a stain from cloth.

WHY IT ARISES:
Ignorance is commonly understood as something negative to be removed. Students assume practice means getting rid of it.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The self-liberated nature of ignorance is missed. Practice becomes struggle against an enemy.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students develop aversion to their own confusion. The recognition that confusion is groundless is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of purification practice, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of pure vs. impure, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through self-aggression.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "bag chags" (habitual tendencies) as psychological conditioning formed in childhood or past lives that must be worked through.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Bag chags" resembles modern concepts of conditioning and habit formation. Students psychologize these tendencies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The imprints of delusion are treated as psychological baggage. Practice becomes therapy or self-analysis.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students focus on their "issues" rather than recognizing nature. Endless processing replaces direct recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as depth psychology, then to MEDITATIONISM of working through patterns, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of imprints.
