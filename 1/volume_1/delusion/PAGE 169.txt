[CONTRADICTION ERROR] [LOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the discussion of apparent contradictions ("which although contradiction not") as establishing that logical coherence is the criterion for valid teaching, approaching Dzogchen through logical analysis.

WHY IT ARISES:
The explicit mention of contradiction triggers logical analysis. Academic training supports reading contradictions as problems to solve.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-logical, non-conceptual nature of the teaching is lost in logical defense. The reader becomes a philosopher rather than a recognizer.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Endless debates about resolving apparent contradictions replace practice. The pointing function is lost in analysis.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about being beyond thought are approached through conceptual analysis.

[LIBERATION SCOPE ERROR] [QUANTIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the vast numbers of beings to be liberated as establishing a quota system where liberation is measured by quantity rather than quality of recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numerical language triggers quantitative thinking. Success-oriented consciousness seeks measurable outcomes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching becomes a mass production enterprise. Depth of recognition is sacrificed for numbers.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The ineffable dimension is lost in quantification. The reader measures success by headcount.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle that even one true recognition is sufficient is entirely missed.

[LATENT TENDENCY ERROR] [KARMIC OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the reference to "latent tendency arise power" as establishing that saṃsāra is endless due to inexhaustible karma, creating despair or complacency about liberation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of inexhaustible tendencies triggers deterministic thinking. The magnitude of the task seems overwhelming.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that liberation is immediately available is doubted. The reader despairs or becomes passive.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Complex path structures are developed to address infinite karma. Simplicity is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that one moment of recognition transcends all karma is entirely missed.
