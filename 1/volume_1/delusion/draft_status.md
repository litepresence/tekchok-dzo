# Draft Status - Delusion Layer

**Status:** FINAL DRAFT (V1), EARLY DRAFT (V2)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08

## Layer Specifications
- **Purpose:** log pa spang ba (Error Detection) - Failure-mode cartography
- **Content:** Specific misreadings, why they arise, primary/secondary consequences
- **Character:** Error-analyst, safety engineer - clinical, exact, unsentimental
- **Average Length:** ~113 lines per page (Volume 1)
- **Files:** 479 pages (Volume 1), 415 pages (Volume 2)

## Completion Status
- **Volume 1:** 100% Complete (479/479 pages complete, 0 stubs)
- **Volume 2:** 0.2% Complete (1/415 pages complete, 414 stubs)

## Quality Metrics (Volume 1)
- [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR], [REIFICATION ERROR], [EPISTEMIC ERROR] classification
- MISREADING: What the wrong reading looks like
- WHY IT ARISES: Cognitive/cultural attractors
- PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE: What necessarily degrades
- SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES: Downstream cascade effects
- CASCADE EFFECTS: Clear and recurrent failures only
- 100-150 lines per page for comprehensive analysis

## Standardized Error Tags in Use
- [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
- [REIFICATION ERROR]
- [EPISTEMIC ERROR]
- [PRACTICE ERROR]
- [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
- [VIEW CORRUPTION ERROR]
- [NIHILISTIC ERROR]
- [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

## Current State
Volume 1:
- COMPLETE: All 479 pages have comprehensive error analysis
- No stub files - every page has 100+ lines
- Thorough failure-mode coverage
- Systematic diagnostic approach throughout

Volume 2:
- ESSENTIALLY EMPTY: 414 of 415 pages are stubs (< 20 lines)
- Only 1 page has substantive content
- Complete layer needs to be built

## Remaining Work
- **Volume 1:** None - layer complete
- **Volume 2:** 414 pages need full development (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
- Volume 2 requires complete systematic generation

## Next Steps for Volume 2
1. Systematic generation of all 414 stub pages
2. Follow Volume 1 format and depth standards
3. Apply standardized error classification tags
4. Ensure clinical, diagnostic tone throughout
5. Map predictable misinterpretations before they stabilize

## Absolute Constraints
- DO NOT STATE THE CORRECT VIEW
- DO NOT OFFER PRACTICE GUIDANCE
- DO NOT QUOTE OTHER TEXTS
- DO NOT SOFTEN OR PSYCHOLOGIZE ERRORS
- Descriptive and diagnostic only

## Notes
- Not repairing misunderstandings - preventing their formation
- Senior Nyingma mkhas pa trained in drang nges hermeneutics
- Maps errors across view, practice, scholarship, AI mediation
- Clinical tone - exact and unsentimental
