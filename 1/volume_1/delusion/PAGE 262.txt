[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the base as having two aspects: primordially pure essence (ka dag) and spontaneously accomplished nature (lhun grub). A reader might think: "So the base HAS these two aspects - they are real characteristics of the ultimate reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
The mind naturally categorizes and reifies descriptive language into inherent properties. When taught "two aspects," we assume dual attributes belonging to a substratum. This is how language structures perception.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The base becomes an entity possessing two qualities, like an object with two sides. "Primordial purity" and "spontaneous accomplishment" are reified as metaphysical features, creating a subtle dualism within non-duality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Philosophical debates about which aspect is primary
2. Meditation focused on experiencing "the two aspects"
3. Missing that these are pedagogical pointers, not ontological claims
4. Creating a map of reality rather than recognizing it

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (endless categorization) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking experiences of aspects) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching the two aspects as doctrine). The Dzogchen becomes a philosophical system.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, Nihilistic ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text extensively negates: no essence, no nature, no Buddha, no sentient beings, nothing established. A reader might think: "This is utter emptiness, absolute nothingness. The base is a void, a blankness without any characteristics whatsoever."

WHY IT ARISES:
Western interpretation of Buddhist emptiness often slides into nihilism. When told "nothing exists," we imagine a vacuity, an absence of all qualities. This is the shadow side of scientific materialism - existential meaninglessness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner understands the base as "nothing at all" - empty in the sense of vacant, absent, non-existent. This leads to despair, disengagement, or quietistic withdrawal from life.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Nihilistic interpretation of emptiness
2. Rejection of appearances as "unreal" in a negative sense
3. Withdrawal from engagement with the world
4. Missing that emptiness is not absence but fullness without fixation

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers NIHILISTIC ERROR → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking void states) → PRACTICE ERROR (disengagement from compassionate activity). The practitioner becomes a spiritual nihilist.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text presents extensive logical arguments defending the non-dual position against objections. A reader might think: "This is a rigorous philosophical proof establishing the correct view. The reasoning demonstrates that the base really is non-dual."

WHY IT ARISES:
Western education values logical argumentation as the path to truth. When we encounter philosophical reasoning, we assume it's meant to prove something. The more sophisticated the logic, the more "true" the conclusion seems.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the logical arguments as proofs establishing ontological facts. Non-duality becomes a philosophical position defended by reasoning, rather than a direct recognition beyond intellect.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Intellectual understanding mistaken for realization
2. Debating and defending "the view" with logic
3. Seeking more sophisticated arguments
4. Missing that reasoning is a finger pointing, not the moon

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (intellectual fixation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (thinking logic leads to truth) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching through argumentation). The practitioner becomes a philosopher of emptiness.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes liberation as "without effort, self-liberated, nothing newly arisen." A reader might think: "This means I don't need to do anything. Practice is unnecessary because everything is already liberated. I can just relax and let things be."

WHY IT ARISES:
The idea of "effortless liberation" appeals to spiritual laziness and the desire for quick results. It promises freedom without work, realization without practice. This resonates with modern quick-fix spirituality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner abandons practice, thinking "it's all already perfect." This becomes an excuse for not engaging, a spiritual bypass that avoids the challenging work of transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Abandonment of meditation and practice
2. Justification of neurotic patterns as "already perfect"
3. Spiritual bypassing of emotional work
4. Missing that effortlessness arises from prior effort

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to NIHILISTIC ERROR (nothing matters) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (avoiding real work) → PRACTICE ERROR (non-practice as practice). The practitioner becomes spiritually stagnant.
