[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "uninterrupted space kāya" with its twenty characteristics of non-separation is interpreted as asserting a monistic unity where all distinctions literally collapse into undifferentiated oneness—absolute holistic metaphysics.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Uninterrupted" (*རྒྱ་མ་ཆད་པ་) and "non-separate" (*ཐ་མི་དད་པ་) trigger monistic reading. Enumeration of unified pairs suggests metaphysical synthesis. Western perennial philosophy interprets this as evidence of universal consciousness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The middle way collapses into eternalistic monism. All distinctions—samsara and nirvana, mind and wisdom, ignorance and awareness—are declared "the same." The path of liberation is denied.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Emptiness and clarity are treated as identical substance. "Lhun grub and kadag uninterrupted" becomes metaphysical claim. The dynamic, non-dual but distinct display is lost in static unity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] produces [NIHILISTIC ERROR] simultaneously—since all is "one," nothing matters. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as effort is rejected. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as distinctions are discouraged.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "attachment-free self-liberated kāya" with its extensive negations—"not grasping at appearance, not attached to emptiness"—is interpreted as license for antinomian behavior since nothing needs to be done.

WHY IT ARISES:
Negation of acceptance and rejection (*མི་ཞེན་, *མི་ཆགས་) triggers libertine reading. "Not abandoning, not accomplishing" suggests amorality. Western practitioners conflate non-duality with non-discrimination.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Ethical conduct collapses. Virtue and non-virtue are dismissed as dualistic concepts. Practitioners engage in harmful behavior claiming Dzogchen view. The foundation of virtue is destroyed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Not rejecting afflictions" becomes indulgence. "Not accomplishing Buddha" becomes excuse for not practicing. "Not meditation, not view" becomes rejection of all method.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [EPISTEMIC ERROR] triggers [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] of the worst kind—students are told "everything is permitted." [PRACTICE ERROR] proliferates as antinomian communities form. [NIHILISTIC ERROR] spreads as ethics are abandoned.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The five wisdoms with their specific correlations (dharmadhātu wisdom from kāya's expanse, mirror-like from clarity, etc.) are interpreted as asserting five truly-existing wisdom-entities that arise sequentially from practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumeration (*ཡེ་ཤེས་ལྔ་, five) triggers categorical reification. Cause-effect language (*ལས་, *བྱུང་) suggests production. Western psychology interprets these as consciousness-faculties to develop.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is objectified as achievement. Practitioners seek to "develop" or "manifest" the five wisdoms as milestones. Natural self-arising (*རང་བྱུང་) is replaced by developmental spirituality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Dharmadhātu wisdom" becomes specific attainment. "Mirror-like wisdom" is another state to achieve. The inseparability of the five wisdoms in single rigpa is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] where wisdom-cultivation becomes goal. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] follows as wisdoms are reified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as five-wisdom curriculum is institutionalized.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The inner and outer lights (*ནང་གསལ་, *ཕྱིར་གསལ་) are interpreted as literal light phenomena—physical radiance that can be seen and cultivated through thodgal practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Light" (*འོད་) triggers visual reading. Five colors (*ཁ་དོག་ལྔ་) suggest perceptible phenomena. Western visual culture reduces "light" to photonic phenomenon.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes light-experience practice. The metaphorical "light" of awareness is reduced to literal luminosity. Practitioners seek to see colored lights as signs of progress.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Beyond color" (*ཁ་དོག་ལས་འདས་པ་) is interpreted as subtle color. "Self-pure" (*རང་སར་དག་) colors become things to achieve. Natural clarity is replaced by visual sensation-seeking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR]—pressing eyes, staring at light sources. [EPISTEMIC ERROR] follows as students confuse sensation with recognition. [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] proliferates.
