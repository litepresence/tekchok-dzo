[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Mind itself, ultimate, free from elaboration" (sems nyid don dam spros bral) is interpreted as discovering a special state of mind—accessing a pristine, pre-conceptual consciousness that exists as the ground of being.

WHY IT ARISES:
Mystical perennialism and essentalist spirituality seek "the ground of being." The phrase "mind itself" triggers hypostasization—treating an abstraction as substantial reality. Western ontological commitments project a "true self" behind phenomena.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The basis (gzhi) is reified as metaphysical ground. The practitioner searches for a "thing" called mind-nature, developing subtle grasping at clarity or awareness as self-existent. This is the most difficult obscuration to detect because it masquerades as realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Without effort" ('bad rtsol byar med pa) becomes license for passivity. The practitioner abandons method while not having recognition, claiming "effortless" while actually being lazy. Meditation becomes spacing out, confusion becomes "spontaneous."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The simile of gold and its color (gser dang de'i ser po) is misunderstood as proof of essential nature rather than example of non-duality between appearance and emptiness. This leads to [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—eternal soul doctrine smuggled in as "buddha-nature." The practitioner develops subtle aversion to form, believing emptiness is "more real" than appearance.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Great realization yoga" (rtogs pa chen po'i rnal 'byor) is interpreted as achieving a permanent state of cosmic consciousness—maintaining uninterrupted mystical experience that constitutes awakening.

WHY IT ARISES:
Mystical literature describes peak experiences. The word "great" triggers grandiosity. Practitioners conflate temporary meditative experiences (nyams) with realization, then strive to maintain or reproduce them.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Yoga collapses into experience-hoarding. The practitioner judges sessions by intensity of experience rather than depth of recognition. Subtle anxiety develops about "losing" the state. Meditation becomes performance anxiety disguised as practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Self-arisen primordial wisdom" (rang byung gi ye shes) is sought as experience rather than recognized as nature. The practitioner develops craving for "special states" and aversion to ordinary mind. This inverts the teaching that ordinary mind is the path.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without recognition, "ripened result appears variously and liberates variously" (smin pa sems kyi 'bras bu sna tshogs su snang la sna tshogs su grol ba) becomes dangerous—phenomena appear but are not self-liberated, producing karmic accumulation with deluded mind. The practitioner develops [EPISTEMIC ERROR]—believing unusual experiences validate realization when they may indicate psychosis or elemental disturbances.
