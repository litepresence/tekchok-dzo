[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The fifteen metaphors for awareness (dpe bco lnga) comparing rig pa to lion, elephant, garuda, rainbow, fire, space, wind, bee, ocean, moon-reflection, sky, crystal, lotus, river, and bubbles are interpreted as actual metaphysical claims about the properties of awareness rather than skillful means for recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The practitioner encounters vivid imagery and immediately maps it onto ontological categories. "Rig pa is like a lion" triggers conceptual proliferation about awareness having leonine qualities. The Western mind, trained in literal interpretation, assumes these are descriptive claims rather than pointing-out instructions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition function of metaphor collapses. The practitioner now believes awareness IS a lion-elephant-garuda amalgam. They search for these characteristics in their experience rather than recognizing the nature being pointed to. The fifteen metaphors become fifteen objects of grasping.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation becomes a quest for "finding the garuda-quality" or "experiencing the ocean-nature." The practitioner compares their experiences against the metaphor-catalog, creating new hierarchies: "Today my practice was more lion-like than yesterday." The simplicity of naked awareness is obscured by metaphorical elaboration.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to all subsequent teachings. Every simile becomes a metaphysical claim. The practitioner develops a complex "metaphor-map" of reality, mistaking the finger for the moon at every turn. This error bleeds into PAGE 462-465, where the four lamps will also be substantialized. Recognition is replaced by metaphor-matching.

[EXPERIENCE CHASING] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [COLOPHON DISMISSAL]

MISREADING:
The enumeration of fifteen metaphors is read as a checklist of attainments to be sequentially mastered. The practitioner believes they must "collect" all fifteen recognitions before proceeding, creating a curriculum of metaphor-achievements.

WHY IT ARISES:
Educational conditioning treats knowledge as accumulation. The numbered list triggers achievement-oriented psychology. "Fifteen metaphors" becomes "fifteen levels" in the practitioner's mind, each requiring certification before advancement.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness becomes fragmented into fifteen separate objects of attainment. The practitioner feels inadequate when they cannot "find" the garuda-metaphor or "experience" the rainbow-recognition. The unitary nature of rig pa is shattered by enumerative grasping.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes a metaphor-collecting exercise. The practitioner judges themselves and others by "how many metaphors they've realized." Those who claim fewer recognitions are deemed junior practitioners. Elitism emerges based on metaphor-mastery claims.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] contaminates the entire text. Every teaching becomes another experience to acquire. The four lamps (PAGE 466-468) become visual experiences to chase, deviations (PAGE 469-472) become obstacles to fear, and the colophon (PAGE 479) becomes a mere formality to dismiss. The volume concludes without integration.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The metaphors are interpreted as establishing the "superiority" of Dzogchen awareness compared to other Buddhist practices. "Rig pa is like a lion" becomes "Dzogchen practitioners are like lions compared to Hinayana practitioners."

WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual materialism converts all teachings into status markers. The powerful imagery of lion, elephant, and garuda triggers associations with strength and dominance. The practitioner unconsciously maps these onto spiritual hierarchy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a brand of spiritual superiority. The metaphors, intended to point to recognition, instead prop up the practitioner's identity as "one who has the lion-like awareness of the Great Perfection." This is the very grasping that prevents recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner looks down on other traditions that lack these "powerful metaphors." They collect Dzogchen teachings not for liberation but for identity-enhancement. The fifteen metaphors become fifteen badges of spiritual status.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads through PAGE 473-475 where practitioner types are discussed. The metaphors contaminate capacity-discrimination, creating rigid hierarchies. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed an entire identity around "having" these fifteen recognitions, completely missing that recognition is not something possessed.

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The metaphors are read as a sequence that must be perfectly understood before moving to the four lamps. The practitioner believes that incomplete comprehension of the fifteen metaphors will cause deviation in subsequent practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Perfectionism demands complete mastery before progression. The sequential presentation (fifteen metaphors, then four lamps) triggers linear learning assumptions. The practitioner fears that "gaps" in metaphor-understanding will compound downstream.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner gets stuck analyzing the fifteen metaphors, never feeling "ready" for the four lamps. They develop elaborate interpretations of each metaphor, building conceptual edifices that obscure direct recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Understanding the metaphors" replaces actual practice. The practitioner becomes a scholar of Dzogchen imagery without ever resting in awareness. They believe this scholarly mastery IS the practice, confusing information with transformation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] persists through PAGE 469-472 where actual deviations are discussed. Having over-analyzed the metaphors, the practitioner now over-analyzes deviations, creating paranoia about practice-mistakes. By PAGE 479, they have built a fortress of concepts around every teaching, never having touched the simplicity of rig pa.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIENCY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The fifteen metaphors are treated as "Volume 1 content" to be rushed through so the practitioner can reach "more advanced" teachings in future volumes. The metaphors are seen as preliminary, not quintessential.

WHY IT ARISES:
Future-oriented mind always seeks the next thing. The proximity to the volume's end triggers completion-anxiety. The practitioner wants to "finish Volume 1" and assumes these final pages are less important than what comes next.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound pointing-out instructions of the fifteen metaphors are glossed over. The practitioner skims, looking for "the main point" to check off their list. The very culmination of Volume 1 is dismissed as "preliminary."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner develops a dismissive attitude toward all "concluding" materials. The colophon (PAGE 479) is ignored entirely. Dedication and seals are seen as formalities rather than essential supports for the teaching's power.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures that Volume 1's completion lacks integration. The practitioner carries forward a pattern of rushing past endings to chase beginnings. Every subsequent volume will be approached this way—never completed, never absorbed. The entire Treasury becomes a collection of partially-digested beginnings.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: These five errors contaminate PAGE 462-465 where the four lamps are presented. The substantialized metaphors become substantialized lamps. The experience-chasing practitioner now chases lamp-visions. The elitist practitioner claims "I have realized the lamp of wisdom." The completion-anxious practitioner rushes past the lamps' subtle pointing. And all dismiss the colophon's seal, failing to ground the teaching properly.
