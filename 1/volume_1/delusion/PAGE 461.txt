[REIFICATION ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The fifteen metaphors describing awareness (rig pa) are interpreted as literal meditation objects to be visualized or concentrated upon—treating awareness as qualities one can acquire by meditating on lions, elephants, garudas, rainbows, fire, space, wind, swans, oceans, moons, sky, crystals, lotuses, rivers, and bubbles.

WHY IT ARISES:
Meditation culture conditions practitioners to treat all descriptions as technique. Metaphors trigger objectification. Western practitioners habitually convert pointing-out instructions into concentration exercises, believing that simulating described qualities produces the described awareness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphors' function as recognition-pointers is lost. Awareness (rig pa) becomes a collection of attributes to cultivate rather than the nature of present cognition. The practitioner attempts to "become like a lion" or "merge with space" instead of recognizing what already is.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Natural metaphors become artificial visualizations. "Lion-like awareness" (seng ge ngar ma) becomes a self-improvement project. The practitioner develops hierarchical relation to the metaphors—seeking to embody them rather than recognize what they indicate.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding metaphors as pedagogical recognition-devices, the practitioner develops [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]—endless technique accumulation. They may cycle through all fifteen metaphors as sequential practices, checking each off a list. The actual recognition that all fifteen describe the same awareness remains inaccessible. The [REIFICATION ERROR] becomes total—awareness is now a thing with fifteen different forms rather than the single nature these forms variously indicate.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The technical description of how the four lamps arise from the four vital points (sgron ma bzhi gnad du gcun pa) is interpreted as literal physiological mechanics—believing that manipulating winds (rlung) and holding gazes actually produces awareness-display (rig pa'i snang ba).

WHY IT ARISES:
Somatic practices validate through physical sensation. Technical language triggers engineering mentality. Western practitioners project biomedical causality onto subtle-body descriptions, assuming mechanical precision equals ontological truth.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The dependent origination of display is reified as production. The practitioner believes that "entering wind" ('jug pa'i rlung) literally causes something to arise, missing that the description maps recognition-conditions rather than manufacturing-processes.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Wind" becomes breath-control technique. "Gaze" becomes eye-exercise. The practitioner develops subtle-body materialism, believing that manipulating physiological correlates generates spiritual states. Recognition-dependent-upon-conditions is mistaken for recognition-produced-by-conditions.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding technical descriptions as pedagogical coordinates for recognition rather than mechanical causation, the practitioner develops [PRACTICE ERROR]—obsessive manipulation of supports. They may damage their eyes through forced gazing or create wind-disorders through aggressive breath-control. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—assuming all dzogchen practices are physical techniques rather than recognition-contexts. The subtle body is treated as machine to be operated rather than condition to be recognized.
