[DESCRIBED ERROR] [ATTRIBUTION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18295-18305 describe the basis-pure wisdom (gzhi gnas kyi ye shes) with apophatic characteristics: "beyond existence and non-existence," "without name for ignorance," "no one or two," "beyond expression," "unfabricated," "spontaneously arisen." The reader concludes this describes a transcendent void or special state.

WHY IT ARISES:
The apophatic language (saying what it is not) naturally suggests transcendence beyond all categories. Without understanding that negation is pedagogical—removing conceptual overlay to point to what cannot be conceptually captured—readers project their own concepts of "beyond." The accumulation of negatives suggests something very special.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Emptiness is reified as a thing, a state, or a transcendental reality. The radical openness that cannot be characterized—because it is not an object of characterization—becomes a new metaphysical absolute. "Beyond existence and non-existence" is understood as a third category rather than freedom from all categories.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "beyond existence and non-existence" as a special state or experience, creating subtle eternalism. They may cultivate experiences of "unfabricated" or "spontaneous" awareness. Or they may fall into nihilism, understanding "empty" and "beyond" to mean "nothing exists."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TRANSCENDENT ERROR] where emptiness becomes metaphysical ground, [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where negation is literalized, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where "beyond" becomes goal, and [ABSOLUTE ERROR] where openness is reified. Also activates [MYSTICISM ERROR] where special states are sought.

[SELF-PERFECTED ERROR] [SPONTANEITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18314-18349 describe self-perfected wisdom (rang bzhin lhun grub kyi ye shes) as "spontaneously present from the beginning," "without accepting or rejecting," "naturally perfected," "effortless," and "without deliberate action." The reader interprets this as license for passive inaction.

WHY IT ARISES:
Terms like "spontaneous" (lhun gyis grub), "natural" (rang bzhin), "without effort" (rtsol sgrub med), and "without deliberate action" (bya bral) suggest that doing nothing is the practice. This appeals powerfully to the desire for easy liberation without difficulty or discipline.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The crucial distinction between natural spontaneity and habitual patterning is completely missed. All behavior is reified as "natural," eliminating the need for recognition or any practice whatsoever. Ordinary habits, neuroses, and confusion are justified as "spontaneous wisdom."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners abandon all effort, discipline, and structure, mistaking ordinary habit for spontaneous wisdom. Naturalness becomes rationalization for continuing unconscious patterns. "Just be natural" obscures the difference between recognizing rigpa and indulging conditioning.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LAZY ERROR] where "natural" justifies inaction, [SPIRITUAL BYPASSING ERROR] where recognition is claimed without transformation, [HABIT ERROR] where conditioning is indulged, and [RATIONALIZATION ERROR] where confusion is justified. Also activates [DISCIPLINE DISMISSAL] where structure is rejected.

[FIVE WISDOM ERROR] [NUMBER ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18350-18404 enumerate the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga): mirror-like wisdom (me long lta bu'i ye shes), equality wisdom (mnyam pa nyid kyi ye shes), discriminating wisdom (so sor rtog pa'i ye shes), all-accomplishing wisdom (bya ba grub pa'i ye shes), and dharmadhatu wisdom (chos dbyings ye shes). The reader treats these as five distinct psychological or ontological entities.

WHY IT ARISES:
The fivefold structure (rnam pa lnga) suggests a complete, systematic description. The detailed characteristics appear to map out the structure of enlightened awareness. Buddhist teachings on the five wisdoms train us to accept this enumeration. The number five implies comprehensiveness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of the five wisdoms is completely missed. What are actually five aspects of single recognition—like five windows viewing the same landscape—appear as separate attainments or faculties to be developed individually. The understanding that all five are simply rigpa is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate each wisdom separately—developing mirror-like clarity, then equality, then discrimination. They may seek experiences corresponding to each wisdom. The natural, effortless presence of all five aspects is obscured by cultivation efforts.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become things to develop, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific experiences are sought, [SEQUENTIAL ERROR] where wisdoms are pursued one by one, and [ASPECT ERROR] where parts are reified. Also activates [COLLECTION ERROR] where all five must be gathered.

[POETIC ERROR] [IMAGERY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18405-18427 present extensive verse descriptions of the five wisdoms using poetic imagery: "like the sun's orb," "like space," "like a wish-fulfilling jewel," "like the moon's reflection in water." The reader literalizes these into required experiences or metaphysical claims.

WHY IT ARISES:
The poetic language is beautiful, evocative, and memorable. Our minds naturally grasp at imagery, especially when enhanced by literary quality. The metaphors seem to describe what wisdom is "like," suggesting experiential qualities. Vivid imagery appears to capture truth.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pointing function of poetry is completely missed. What are meant to evoke recognition through resonance and suggestion become objects of aesthetic appreciation or metaphysical speculation. The metaphor is mistaken for the meaning.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "sun-like" clarity, "space-like" openness, "jewel-like" fulfillment as experiences. They may compare their meditation to these images, judging success by correspondence. The natural, unadorned recognition is obscured by pursuit of poetic qualities.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [AESTHETIC ERROR] where beautiful descriptions become goals, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific qualities are sought, [COMPARISON ERROR] where practice is measured against imagery, and [POETIC FIXATION] where metaphors are literalized. Also activates [IMAGERY DEPENDENCE] where recognition requires poetic language.

[KNOWABLE ERROR] [OBJECT ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18425-18464 distinguish wisdom "encompassed by knower" (shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes) and wisdom "encompassed by knowables" (shes byas bsdus pa'i ye shes). The reader understands these as two different types of knowledge or cognitive modes.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure (shes pas/shes byas + bsdus pa) suggests classification into types. The distinction between knower and known appears to create two categories. Academic training encourages identifying and distinguishing types of knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of knowing and knowable in wisdom is completely missed. What are actually two ways of describing wisdom's all-pervasiveness—wisdom as that which knows all, and wisdom as that which is the nature of all known—appear as separate categories.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate "knower wisdom" or "knowable wisdom" separately. They may debate their relative importance or pursue one as primary. The natural inseparability of subject and object in recognition is obscured by categorical thinking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBJECT-OBJECT ERROR] where knower and known remain dualistic, [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become objects of practice, [TYPOLOGY ERROR] where types are grasped, and [DICHOTOMY ERROR] where unity is divided. Also activates [SEPARATION ERROR] where distinction is reified.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 432 presents the most elaborate description of wisdom types in this section, with detailed characteristics and poetic imagery. The five wisdom enumeration particularly invites number errors. Page 433 will present the twenty-five wisdoms (fivefold multiplication), amplifying enumeration errors. The apophatic language describing basis-purity invites transcendence errors. The self-perfected language invites laziness errors. The poetic descriptions will continue and must be recognized as pointers, not prescriptions. The knower/knowable distinction establishes subject-object errors that may persist. The detailed imagery risks experiential fixation throughout subsequent pages.
