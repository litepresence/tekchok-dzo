[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DHARMAS AS ENTITIES]

MISREADING:
Dharmas (phenomena) are actual existent things or building blocks of reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Dharma" translated as "thing" or "phenomenon" suggests entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Abhidharma mistaken for ontological atomism.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Competing lists of dharmas seen as rival ontologies.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].
