[CONDITIONING ERROR] [HABIT ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18233-18243: The text describes how "the gathering of habitual patterns" (bag chags kyi sdud byed) and mentation's "examination of objects" create samsara. One might see this as describing real conditioning processes.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of conditioning (bag chags), production (byung), and causation resembles psychological and behavioral models. We naturally understand experience through cause-effect frameworks.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The timeless, non-causal nature of confusion is missed. What is actually the immediate display of unrecognized rigpa appears as a process developing over time through conditioning.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to "undo" conditioning through various techniques, creating a new form of doing. The natural, effortless nature of recognition is obscured by intervention strategies.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [DEVELOPMENTAL ERROR] where awakening appears as reversal of temporal process, and [TECHNIQUE ERROR] where practices to "remove" conditioning proliferate.

[ADVENTITIOUS ERROR] [CONTAMINATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18243-18253: The text describes defilements as "adventitious" (glo bur) and quotes Hevajra: "Sentient beings are Buddhas, obscured only by adventitious defilements." One might see defilements as foreign additions rather than intrinsic display.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "adventitious" (glo bur) literally means "sudden," "occasional," or "extraneous." Natural language suggests something added to an originally pure nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The co-emergent nature of purity and confusion is missed. What arise together (lhan cig skyes) appear sequential: first purity, then contamination.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek to "remove" defilements as if they were removable stains, rather than recognizing that their nature is inseparable from purity. This creates dualistic struggle.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURIFICATION ERROR] where practice becomes cleaning, and [ORIGINAL PURITY ERROR] where "original" is temporalized as prior state to be recovered.
