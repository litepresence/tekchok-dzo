[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [GENERATIVE CAUSALITY MECHANISM]

MISREADING:
Body, speech, and mind are generated sequentially through a causal chain: body produces channels, channels produce speech, speech produces mind.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14142-14146: "lus kyis rtsa bskyed/rtsas ngag skyed/ngag gis yid skyed/yid kyis chos nyid skyed" (body produces channels, channels produce speech, speech produces mind, mind produces reality).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing the process as linear causation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Believing one must work backward through the chain to liberate.
Missing that all are simultaneously present and non-dual.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[CAUSAL INVERSION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PURE/DROSS DUALISM]

MISREADING:
There are actually two substances - pure essence (dngas ma/dwangs ma) and impure dross (snyigs ma) - that need to be separated.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14148-14156: Repeated mentions of pure and impure aspects of channels.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing reality as containing inherently pure and impure parts.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to extract or cultivate the pure.
Missing that pure and impure are conceptual designations on non-dual display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PURIFICATION OBSESSION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [RELATIVE/ULTIMATE BODHICITTA DUALISM]

MISREADING:
There are two distinct types of bodhicitta - relative (kun rdzob) and ultimate (don dam) - existing as separate entities.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14154-14156: "don dam byang chub kyi sems...kun rdzob byang sems" (ultimate bodhicitta...relative bodhicitta).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thinking relative and ultimate are two things.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Privileging ultimate over relative.
Missing that they are indivisible like fire and its heat.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TWO-TRUTH OBSTRUCTION ERROR]
