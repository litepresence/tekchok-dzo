[ETYMOLOGICAL ERROR] [DEFINITION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17946-17981: The text provides six types of fundamental ignorance (ma rig pa), each with definitions based on what is not recognized. One might treat these as fixed technical definitions rather than overlapping aspects of a single error.

WHY IT ARISES:
The definitional format ("X is...") resembles dictionary entries or technical terminology. Academic training encourages precise categorization and memorization of definitions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The living experience of not recognizing one's nature is replaced by conceptual knowledge about types of ignorance. One can discuss the six types while remaining fundamentally deluded.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual mastery of definitions creates false confidence. Practitioners believe they understand ignorance because they can name and describe its varieties.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CONCEPTUAL MASTERY ERROR] where knowing about ignorance substitutes for recognizing it, and [SUBTLE PRIDE ERROR] where definitional precision becomes spiritual accomplishment.

[TYPOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYSTEMATIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17966-17991: Eleven types of mind are described using animal and elemental metaphors (water-like mind, pig-like mind, tiger-like mind, etc.). Readers may literalize these into personality types or psychological categories.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic presentation (11 types) invites classification. Modern psychology has trained us to think in personality types, cognitive styles, and behavioral patterns.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The fluid, context-dependent nature of mental states is obscured. What describes temporary conditions becomes reified as enduring characteristics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may identify with certain types ("I have a bird-like mind") or aspire to others ("I should develop tiger-like courage"), creating new forms of grasping and self-concept.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [IDENTITY FORMATION ERROR] where spiritual typology replaces personality, and [ASPIRATION ERROR] where wanting to have a "better" type of mind becomes subtle goal-setting.
