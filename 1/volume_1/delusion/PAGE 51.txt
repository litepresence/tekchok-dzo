[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [AGGREGATE REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
The five aggregates are actual building blocks or components that constitute a person.

WHY IT ARISES:
Analytical language suggests parts making up wholes. Scientific reductionism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Person understood as composite entity rather than empty convention.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation becomes deconstructing self into parts rather than recognizing emptiness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VIEW COLLAPSE] and [MEDITATIONISM ERROR].
