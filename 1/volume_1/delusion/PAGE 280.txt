[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text concludes that even though these are one's own appearances, there's a common worldly aspect established by collective karma and the teacher's activity. A reader might think: "This explains how shared reality works - collective karma creates common appearances, while individual appearances remain private. This is the ontology of shared world."

WHY IT ARISES:
We want to understand how we share a world if everything is "own appearance." The distinction between collective/common and individual/private satisfies our need for ontology of intersubjectivity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates ontology of shared reality. Collective karma becomes the mechanism for common appearance, individual karma for private appearance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying collective karma as world-source
2. Studying mechanics of shared appearance
3. Debating individual vs collective display
4. Missing that shared is also imputed

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (intersubjective metaphysics) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (karma mechanics) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (ontology of sharing). The practitioner explains the world.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that self-appearance aspects return to oneself when the vase breaks, while common ones transfer to others. A reader might think: "This describes the mechanics of death and continuation. This is how rebirth works in Dzogchen."

WHY IT ARISES:
We want to understand death, rebirth, continuation. The vase-breaking metaphor suggests a mechanics of transition. We imagine this describes the actual process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the description as mechanics of rebirth. Death becomes a technical transition where self-appearances return to oneself.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Understanding death mechanically
2. Planning for the transition
3. Technical approach to dying
4. Missing that description is not mechanics

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (death mechanics) → PRACTICE ERROR (technical dying) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (death anxiety). The practitioner plans for death.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text emphasizes that distinguishing these two aspects (self-appearance and common) is extremely important. A reader might think: "This is the crucial distinction I must understand. This distinction is the key to practice."

WHY IT ARISES:
We seek the essential distinction, the crucial difference. Emphasis signals importance. We assume understanding this distinction is the key to realization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner focuses on understanding the two aspects as the key teaching. This becomes the central practice - maintaining the distinction.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Fixating on the two-aspect distinction
2. Analyzing which appearances are which
3. Practice centered on distinction
4. Missing that distinction is provisional

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to EPISTEMIC ERROR (distinction as key) → PRACTICE ERROR (distinction-fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (aspect analysis). The practitioner distinguishes.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text presents extensive reasoning about the eight qualities, conditions, base-display, compassion, and benefit for beings. A reader might think: "This completes the philosophical presentation of the base's qualities. This is the comprehensive understanding."

WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive presentation suggests completion. We assume this exhausts the topic, gives the full picture. Academic completion substitutes for wisdom.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the text as completing a philosophical system. Understanding the eight qualities exhausts knowledge of the base.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating text as comprehensive system
2. Believing topic is now covered
3. Intellectual closure on the subject
4. Missing that the base is beyond coverage

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (comprehensive completion) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (coverage as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching completed systems). The tradition closes the book.
