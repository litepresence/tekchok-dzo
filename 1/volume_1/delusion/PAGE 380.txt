[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The wind calculation formulas and deficiency tables present fixed laws of existence—mathematical certainties about lifespan that apply universally to all beings.

WHY IT ARISES:
The universal mathematical presentation suggests natural law. Scientific frameworks encourage belief in discoverable universal constants.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Existence is reduced to mathematical formula. The practitioner believes lifespan follows calculable rules.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Scientific materialism replaces Dharma. The profound teaching becomes merely ancient physiology.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The concluding thigle verses present meditation techniques (resting in thigle, familiarization day and night, etc.) as the path to realization—effortful practice producing results.

WHY IT ARISES:
The prescriptive language suggests progressive technique. Spiritual training encourages staged practice approach.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes effortful meditation. The practitioner works on thigle familiarization expecting gradual results.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Effort obscures effortlessness. The practitioner tries to master thigle rather than recognizing always-present nature.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The distinction between conventional thigle (with channels, winds, seed syllables) and ultimate thigle (dharmakaya emptiness) describes two different objects of meditation for different levels of practitioner.

WHY IT ARISES:
The two-truth framework suggests progressive objects. Gradualist interpretation encourages staged approach.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Two thigles are reified as separate realities. The practitioner works with conventional thigle first, planning to graduate to ultimate thigle.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dualistic progression replaces direct recognition. The practitioner believes realization requires working through conventional to reach ultimate.
