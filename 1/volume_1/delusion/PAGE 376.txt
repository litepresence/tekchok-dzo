[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of the twelve functions of karma wind producing external, internal, and secret twelvefold cycles describes fixed karmic mechanics that mechanically produce samsaric existence.

WHY IT ARISES:
The twelvefold structure suggests cyclical determinism. Cyclical time frameworks encourage belief in mechanical repetition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samsara becomes mechanical cycle. The practitioner believes karma wind mechanically produces existence in predetermined patterns.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deterministic resignation develops. The practitioner accepts samsaric cycling as mechanically inevitable rather than seeing its empty nature.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of wind characteristics (strong, weak, dull, sharp, etc.) and their karmic results describes fixed personality types determined by wind quality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The typology suggests psychological determinism. Personality frameworks encourage belief in fixed character types.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Character becomes wind-determined fate. The practitioner believes personality is mechanically produced by wind quality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fatalism about character develops. The practitioner accepts negative traits as wind-determined rather than recognizing their transformable nature.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The concluding verses on thigle practice present meditation instructions that, when followed correctly, will produce realization through gradual familiarization.

WHY IT ARISES:
The instruction format suggests progressive practice. Spiritual training encourages staged approach to realization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes progressive thigle meditation. The practitioner works on thigle practices expecting gradual results.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Effortful practice replaces effortless recognition. The practitioner familiarizes with thigle rather than recognizing always-present nature.
