[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "eleven jumping channels" ('phar ba'i rtsa) and other channel categories are literal physiological structures that can be accessed through bloodletting (gtar) at specific points to treat diseases.

WHY IT ARISES:
The text explicitly describes medical applications of channels for bloodletting therapy. This practical medical context leads readers to interpret all channel descriptions as literal anatomical facts.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical dimension of channels is lost entirely. Practitioners approach channel theory as Tibetan medical anatomy rather than subtle body energetics pointing to the nature of mind.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dzogchen view is reduced to medical theory. The profound relationship between channel states and realization becomes merely a system of physical health practices.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed channel-letter correspondences (A, KA, KI, etc.) at specific body locations constitute a precise map for visualization practice—one should visualize these letters at these points to transform channels into wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
Tantric practice often involves seed syllable visualization at specific locations. Readers familiar with such practices naturally map this framework onto the channel-letter correspondences described.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes reduced to tantric visualization technique. The practitioner engages in elaborate seed syllable meditation at channel points, believing this constitutes Dzogchen practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Effort-based transformation replaces effortless recognition. The practitioner works to "transform" channels through visualization rather than recognizing their already-pure nature.

[PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The channels for diseases (dug rtsa, gshan thag, etc.) and their treatments are metaphors for psychological states—"poison channels" represent toxic thoughts, "nāga channels" represent unconscious material.

WHY IT ARISES:
Modern psychological frameworks automatically interpret bodily metaphors as references to mental states. The specific disease channels invite psychologizing interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen subtle body theory becomes a psychological allegory for emotional processing. The physical practices are dismissed or reinterpreted as symbolic of inner work.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Therapeutic appropriation obscures the actual energetic dimensions. The text's profound presentation of body-mind interdependence becomes merely psychological metaphor.
