[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The wind measurement calculations showing deficiency from 21,600 indicating lifespan reduction describe actual fixed destiny—mechanical correlations between breath count and death time.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numerical correlations suggest scientific fatalism. The precise deficiency calculations appear to predict death with certainty.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes fatalistic numerology. The practitioner believes breath calculations mechanically determine lifespan.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Death anxiety or complacency develops. The practitioner becomes anxious about breath deficiency or fatalistically resigned to calculated death time.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed calculations showing specific lifespan reduction for specific breath deficiencies (50 missing = 2 years, etc.) describe actual fixed correlations between physiology and longevity.

WHY IT ARISES:
The precise numerical table suggests scientific law. Mathematical precision encourages belief in discoverable deterministic relationships.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Longevity becomes mathematical calculation. The practitioner treats lifespan as determined by physiological mathematics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Numerical obsession with death develops. The practitioner calculates remaining lifespan from breath measurements, missing that recognition transcends death.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of conventional thigle (kun rdzob thig le) and ultimate thigle (don dam thig le) practice presents two distinct meditation techniques for realizing different levels of truth.

WHY IT ARISES:
The two-truth framework suggests progressive practice. Mahayana training encourages staged approach to conventional and ultimate.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes two-stage meditation. The practitioner works on conventional thigle first, planning to advance to ultimate thigle later.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Gradualism obscures direct recognition. The practitioner believes awakening requires sequential practice rather than immediate recognition.
