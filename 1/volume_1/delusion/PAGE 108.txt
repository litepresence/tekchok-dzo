[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Error ground reversing manner" and "unawareness's root cutting" describe a process of progressively eliminating ignorance through correct understanding, eventually reaching self-awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of "reversing" and "cutting" suggests a method of elimination. The term "self-awareness" implies something to be achieved.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
View becomes progressive purification of ignorance rather than instantaneous recognition. The practitioner attempts to systematically cut through layers of error.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Gradualist approach to recognition. Frustration when errors persist. Belief that more cutting is needed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Progressive purification → spiritual materialism → pride in having "cut" more than others → sectarian elitism.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Manifold appearing" and "object's focus severed" refer to the diversity of phenomena that must be transcended through severing attachment to objects.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "manifold" suggests multiplicity that needs unification. "Severed" implies an act of cutting or releasing.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Phenomena are treated as obstacles to be transcended rather than self-liberated displays. The practitioner attempts to sever engagement with appearance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Aversion to diversity. Seeking unified emptiness beyond phenomena. Rejection of conventional reality.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Phenomenon aversion → withdrawal from world → quietism → nihilistic interpretation.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The three manners of reversing error (view reversing, dharmatā recognizing, wheel stream cutting) represent progressive stages of practice that lead from error to recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumeration of three distinct manners suggests a curriculum. The progression from error to non-error implies stages.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a three-stage training program. The practitioner attempts to complete each stage sequentially.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Evaluation of progress by stage completion. Comparisons with others' "stage." Attachment to stage-identity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Stage fixation → curriculum obsession → inability to recognize instantaneously → perpetual preparation.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Error's root awareness that'self self-liberating" and "primordial error non-experienced seal obtained" establish a pure awareness that exists prior to and independent of error.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "primordial" suggests timeless pre-existence. "Seal obtained" implies acquisition of a status or state.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness is substantialized as a pure ground existing before confusion. The practitioner seeks to return to this primordial state.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eternalist view of awareness as permanent substrate. Confusion with Vedantic Atman. Rejection of Buddhist no-self.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Substantialist view → grasping at awareness as self → syncretism with Hinduism → loss of pure view.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The temporal sequence of "first error non-experienced," "now error non-dwelling," and "later error non-possible" describes an actual progression through time toward complete liberation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The temporal markers (first, now, later) suggest a timeline. The progression from experienced to non-possible implies development.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Liberation is understood as a future state achieved through temporal progression rather than timeless recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deferral of recognition to future. Waiting for "later" when error becomes impossible. Disappointment with present state.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Future orientation → deferred practice → deathbed Buddhism → failure to recognize in present moment.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [NIHILISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Saṃsāra nirvāṇa ground one" and "error all purified" means there is ultimately no difference between error and non-error, allowing any behavior since all is "one ground."

WHY IT ARISES:
The assertion of oneness appears to dissolve distinctions. The phrase "all purified" suggests nothing needs purification.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Moral license justified by non-dual view. The practitioner believes non-duality permits any action since all is ultimately the same.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Ethical nihilism. Disregard for precepts. Justification of harmful behavior.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Violation of samaya → accumulation of negative karma → obstacles → fall from path.

[4001-4003]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Falling maker ground empty" and "manifested ground" refer to a ground that can be either empty of the "falling maker" (ignorance) or manifest (as wisdom), suggesting two modes of the same substrate.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "ground" suggests a basis. The distinction between empty/manifest implies states of this basis.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Ground is substantialized as a substrate with changing modes. The practitioner attempts to shift from empty to manifest mode.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Ground-grasping. Eternalist fixation on basis. Confusion between modes and nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Mode manipulation → effort to manifest → spiritual materialism → frustration with non-manifestation.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Thigle self essential-point placed" describes installing awareness in a specific location or center (like the heart) as a practice technique.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "placed" suggests positioning. "Essential-point" implies a specific location or technique.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a technique of installing awareness in the body. The practitioner attempts to place mind in specific locations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Body fixation. Spatial reification of mind. Confusion between metaphor and instruction.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Spatial fixation → energetic imbalance → physical or psychological disturbance → medical intervention.
