[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed subtle body anatomy is interpreted as literal physiology to be mastered or as entirely fictional rather than encoded pointing instructions.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical detail suggests scientific accuracy. Esoteric language suggests secrecy or fiction.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The encoded instructions for recognizing mind's nature are either dismissed as fantasy or literalized as anatomy. The middle way is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader either rejects or literalizes without recognizing the pointing. The practical content remains hidden.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCIENTISM ERROR] or [FANTASY ERROR].

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Aspects of recognition are replaced by types of consciousness to cultivate. The simplicity of recognition is lost in typology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner studies types of wisdom rather than recognizing. The pointing to immediate experience is obscured by categories.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TYPOLOGY ERROR] and [CATEGORIZATION ERROR].

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual nature of appearance is replaced by metaphysical ground. The emptiness of foundation is obscured by reification.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on how delusion arises from the ground is replaced by literal birth narrative. The ontological teaching is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
