[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The examples comparing wisdom and mind to "gold and copper" (gser dang ra gan) or instructions and methods to "chang and by-products" are interpreted as claims about different qualities or values—gold is better than copper, instructions are superior to methods.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative language triggers value-judgments. "Gold" triggers preciousness-associations. Western practitioners assume comparative analogies present hierarchical values.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The functional-distinction nature of comparisons is lost. The practitioner believes dzogchen presents value-hierarchy. The pointing function of metal-analogy collapses into materialistic evaluation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Wisdom" becomes precious possession. "Mind" becomes base material. The practitioner accumulates "gold-like" experiences while rejecting "copper-like" ones.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding analogies as recognition-pointers rather than value-claims, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in dzogchen elitism. They may judge others by experiential "purity," developing spiritual materialism. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all comparative language is evaluative. Recognition is replaced by experience-valuation.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The examples of wisdom dissolving into light like "rainbow dissolving into space" ('ja' tshon dbyings su yal ba) or "water-rivals gathering into ocean" are interpreted as literal descriptions of actually-occurring processes rather than pedagogical metaphors.

WHY IT ARISES:
Natural imagery triggers literal interpretation. "Dissolving" triggers substance-transformation associations. Western practitioners assume natural analogies present ontological processes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical nature of all natural imagery is lost. The practitioner believes dzogchen describes physical transformations. The pointing function of natural analogy collapses into literalism.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Rainbow" becomes object to dissolve. "Space" becomes destination. The practitioner literalizes all natural metaphors, creating materialist mysticism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding natural analogies as recognition-pointers, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in literal dzogchen cosmology. They may await physical dissolution-events, believing these validate practice. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all imagery is literalized. Recognition is replaced by event-awaiting.
