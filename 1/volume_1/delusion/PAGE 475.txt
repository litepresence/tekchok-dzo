[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The fifteen examples (dpe bco lnga) comparing Buddha-sentient beings to head-horns, recognition-ignorance to water-drawing and water-bubbles, wisdom-mind to gold-copper, etc., are interpreted as ontological claims about metaphysical structures.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative language triggers literal interpretation. Examples suggest ontological parallels. The practitioner assumes analogies indicate realities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-pointer function of examples is lost. Examples become metaphysical claims. The practitioner literalizes all analogies, creating example-ontology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Head-horns" becomes structural theory. "Water-drawing" becomes ontological hierarchy. The practitioner collects example-interpretations as doctrine.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Examples there are also literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "mastered" examples without recognition.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The "similar-but-mistaken" ('dra'o 'dra'o) pairs are interpreted as establishing fine phenomenological distinctions accessible only to superior practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
Subtle distinction suggests sophistication. "Mistaken" suggests error-avoidance. The practitioner wants superior discernment.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-nature of distinction is lost. Fine-discernment becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition lacks subtlety.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Discerning practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Those missing distinctions are deemed coarse. The authentic recognition that distinctions are pedagogical is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 476's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "discerned" distinctions without recognition.

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The examples of wisdom-dissolving into light like "rainbow into space" or water-rivals into ocean are interpreted as literal processes to be experienced.

WHY IT ARISES:
Natural imagery triggers literal expectation. "Dissolving" suggests transformation. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate required experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical nature of natural analogies is lost. The practitioner seeks literal dissolution-experiences. Phenomenological achievement replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Dissolution experiences" become goals. Teachers promising such experiences gain authority. The authentic recognition that dissolving is metaphorical is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 476's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by experience-seeking.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The final metaphors section triggers "almost done" mentality. The practitioner wants to "finish examples" and reach colophon.

WHY IT ARISES:
Proximity to absolute end creates urgency. Example-density creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "closure."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration-function of final examples is missed. The practitioner has "read" examples without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern to the very end. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "just final words."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 476's completion is not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's essential power.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "arrow of great measure" (dpag chen gyi mda') metaphor for non-returning is interpreted as literal description of irreversible attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Irreversibility-language triggers permanence-association. "Arrow" suggests trajectory. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate irreversible status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical nature of non-returning is lost. Irreversible-status becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is reversible.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Non-returner" becomes exclusive identity. Return-possibility is feared. The authentic recognition that returning is concept is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner has "achieved" non-returning conceptually without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The example-literalism on this page carries to PAGE 476's completion. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with example-knowledge but without recognition.
