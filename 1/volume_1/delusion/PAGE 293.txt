[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, COMMENTARY ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text begins "That-by-means-of commentary-in thus very wonder arise and think not-possess-by-means-of object Buddha that." A reader might think: "This is a commentary explaining the Buddha's inconceivable object. I need to study this commentary carefully to understand what cannot be thought."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Commentary" suggests explanation of something difficult. Western scholars trust commentaries to clarify. The paradox of explaining the inexplicable seems profound.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies the commentary as explanation, believing understanding comes from analysis. They miss that commentary points rather than explains.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Commentary is reified as explanation
2. The inexplicable is approached conceptually
3. Direct pointing is replaced with study
4. Dzogchen becomes commentary on commentary

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COMMENTARY ERROR (studying explanations) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (infinite regression) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding for recognition). The practitioner reads about what cannot be thought.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MIRROR ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes Vajrasattva heart mirror tantra: "Realm-three-by-means-of sentient-being this all basis what-also not-possess from what-also delude basis that essence empty nature-by-means-of clear." A reader might think: "The basis is like a mirror—empty essence, clear nature. I need to become like a mirror to reflect all realms without possessing them."

WHY IT ARISES:
Mirror metaphors are compelling and concrete. Westerners want to become mirror-like. The description suggests a state to achieve.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to become "mirror-like," trying to reflect without possessing. They reify mirroring as a practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mirror becomes meditation object
2. Reflection is practiced
3. Natural clarity is obscured
4. Dzogchen becomes mirror maintenance

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MIRROR ERROR (mirror practice) → PRACTICE ERROR (trying to reflect) → REIFICATION ERROR (mirror as state). The practitioner polishes their mirror.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, COMPASSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Compassion sentient-being to appear capacity possess that to grasp-maker-by-means-of consciousness ignorance part from arise." A reader might think: "Compassion has capacity for sentient beings but gets turned into grasping consciousness. I need to keep compassion pure without letting it become ignorance."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Compassion" is valued in Buddhism. The idea that compassion becomes ignorance is shocking. Westerners want to protect compassion from corruption.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner tries to maintain "pure compassion" without letting it become grasping, creating a purity project around compassion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Compassion is monitored for purity
2. Grasping is rejected
3. Natural compassion is constrained
4. Dzogchen becomes compassion policing

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COMPASSION ERROR (purity project) → PRACTICE ERROR (monitoring compassion) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (pure vs impure compassion). The practitioner guards their heart.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, CONDITION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "That also condition basis-by-means-of delude and end also condition four to touch cause object-possessor-as grasp-by-means-of condition from." A reader might think: "Conditions cause delusion. I need to understand the four conditions so I can avoid or transcend them."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Condition" suggests cause to control. Western problem-solvers want to manage conditions. Four conditions seem like a system to master.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies the four conditions as causes to avoid, seeking to transcend conditions entirely.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Conditions are treated as obstacles
2. Transcendence becomes escape
3. Conditional reality is rejected
4. Dzogchen becomes condition-free state

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates CONDITION ERROR (avoiding conditions) → PRACTICE ERROR (transcendence seeking) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (conditioned vs unconditioned dualism). The practitioner seeks the unconditional.
