[REIFICATION ERROR] [CHANNEL SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The central channel (dbu ma) is a physical tube or conduit for subtle energies.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Channel" (rtsa) suggests plumbing. Anatomical correlations available.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Physical manipulation of posture and breath to "open" channels.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Tension and strain seeking energetic flow.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR].

[16171-16190]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WIND AS ENTITY]

MISREADING:
Winds (rlung) are actual moving energies or forces within the body.

WHY IT ARISES:
Respiratory and energetic sensations seem to move. Physics uses "wind" metaphorically.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wind-control practices as end in themselves.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that winds are movements of mind.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation.

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [CAUSAL INVERSION]

MISREADING:
The bindu causes or produces the clear light as an effect.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential description implies causality. Ordinary logic requires causes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Seeking to produce clear light through bindu manipulation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Causal framework obscures spontaneous presence.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SUTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] applied to [DZOGCHEN VIEW].
