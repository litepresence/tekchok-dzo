[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WIND-DIRECTION SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
Winds moving in specific directions (gyen, thur, etc.) are literal directional flows.

WHY IT ARISES:
Description of wind movements and their results at various channel locations.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing subtle winds as having spatial directionality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to direct winds like physical forces.
Missing that direction is conceptual imputation on awareness-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DIRECTIONAL OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [THIG LE SIZE LITERALISM]

MISREADING:
Thig le being "the size of a mustard seed" (yungs 'bru tsam) is a physical measurement.

WHY IT ARISES:
Repeated size comparisons to mustard seeds.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Attempting to visualize or locate physical sized-drops.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that size metaphors indicate subtlety, not dimension.
Reifying the dimensionless.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DIMENSIONAL OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CONVENTIONAL/ULTIMATE THIG LE DUALISM]

MISREADING:
Conventional thig le (kun rdzob kyi thig le) and natural thig le (rang bzhin gyi thig le) are two different types of drops.

WHY IT ARISES:
Description of g.yas na kun rdzob kyi thig le / g.yon na rang bzhin gyi thig le.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing them as ontologically different substances.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Preferring "ultimate" over "conventional" drops.
Missing their non-dual identity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[GRADED ONTOLOGY ERROR]
