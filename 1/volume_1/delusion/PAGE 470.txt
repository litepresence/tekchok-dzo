[PRACTICE ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The three deviations for conduct—acting like a crazy person, meaningless speech, childish behavior—are interpreted as literal behavioral guidelines with precise criteria for what constitutes each deviation.

WHY IT ARISES:
Literal interpretation of behavioral language is default. "Crazy" (smyon pa) triggers psychiatric associations. Western practitioners assume behavioral descriptions present objective criteria.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-error nature of conduct-deviations is lost. The practitioner worries about whether their behavior meets deviation-criteria. The pointing function of conduct-description collapses into rule-following.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Crazy" becomes specific style to avoid. "Childish" becomes age-inappropriate behavior. The practitioner evaluates conduct by external criteria, policing their behavior.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding conduct-deviations as descriptions of recognition-mistakes rather than behavioral rules, the practitioner develops [PRACTICE ERROR]—obsessive self-policing. They may become rigidly conventional, fearing any unconventional behavior, or conversely act out under guise of "crazy wisdom." The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all behavioral language is literalized. Recognition is replaced by propriety-anxiety.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The three deviations for meditation—equanimity without self, concentration on syllables, non-conceptual emptiness—are interpreted as specific meditation techniques to avoid, creating checklist of wrong techniques.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technique-oriented mindset categorizes all descriptions as methods. "Meditation" triggers practice-association. Western practitioners assume meditation-deviations present counter-indicated techniques.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-error nature of meditation-deviations is lost. The practitioner evaluates their meditation by deviation-checklist. The pointing function of deviation-description collapses into technique-avoidance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Equanimity" becomes wrong if "without self." "Concentration" becomes wrong if "on syllables." The practitioner polices their meditation-content, creating anxiety about "doing it wrong."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding meditation-deviations as descriptions of recognition-mistakes rather than technique-prohibitions, the practitioner develops [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]—technique-anxiety. They may reject legitimate techniques out of fear or cling to "correct" methods rigidly. The [PRACTICE ERROR] spreads—all meditation-language becomes rule-bound. Recognition is replaced by method-orthodoxy.
