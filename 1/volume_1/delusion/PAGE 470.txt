[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The detailed enumeration of nine deviations—three for view, three for conduct, three for meditation—is interpreted as comprehensive error-catalog requiring vigilance against all nine.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerative completeness triggers anxiety. "Nine" suggests exhaustive coverage. The practitioner assumes listed errors cover all possible mistakes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is suffocated by deviation-monitoring. The practitioner constantly checks: "Am I in formless absorption? Acting crazy? Meditating on emptiness?" Fear replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deviation-paralysis sets in. Every practice-movement is suspected. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply non-recognition is lost in obsessive error-checking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 471-472's deviation-consequences. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is paralyzed by fear of the nine deviations.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The distinction between "those with deviations" and "those who have cut deviations" is interpreted as establishing two classes of practitioners with different essences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Typological thinking triggers essentialism. "With/without" suggests categorical difference. The practitioner wants "without deviation" status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-to-all-despite-deviation nature is lost. Deviation-free status becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes some are inherently deviation-prone.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Deviation-free" becomes exclusive identity. Those showing deviation-signs are deemed inferior capacity. The authentic recognition that deviation is simply momentary non-recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Deviation-status becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having cut deviations."

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The deviation-consequences—falling into god realms, becoming demons, falling into formless absorptions—are interpreted as literal fates to be avoided.

WHY IT ARISES:
Consequential language triggers literal fear. "Fall into" suggests destination. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate real dangers.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-error nature of consequences is lost. The practitioner believes in literal bad-rebirths from wrong-meditation. Soteriological fear replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fear-based practice emerges. Teachers promising "safety from deviations" gain authority. The authentic recognition that consequences are simply continued non-recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Consequence-metaphors are literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner practices from fear.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The deviation section's length triggers "get through this" mentality. The practitioner wants to "finish deviations" and reach "practitioner types" and colophon.

WHY IT ARISES:
Dense fear-content creates resistance. Length suggests obstacle. The practitioner wants "positive conclusion."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The protective integration of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "read" deviations without absorbing them. Information substitutes for discernment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward dismissive pattern. Difficult sections are glossed over. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached without deviation-awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 471-472's deviation-cuts are not understood. Arriving at PAGE 479 without discernment, the practitioner misses the colophon's grounding function.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "cutting deviations" (gol sa bcad) terminology is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of deviation-elimination technology.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical terminology signals expertise. "Cut" suggests surgical precision. The practitioner wants superior cutting-tools.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The universal-availability of recognition is lost. Gol sa bcad becomes dzogchen-exclusive method. Elitism emerges around "having cut."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Cutter" becomes practitioner-identity. Other traditions are deemed "uncut." The authentic recognition that all paths cut deviation through recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. "Cutting" metaphors are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "cut" conceptually without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The deviation-fear on this page carries to PAGE 471-472's deviation-cut elaboration. By PAGE 473-475's practitioner-types, fear determines type-identification. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with residual anxiety.
