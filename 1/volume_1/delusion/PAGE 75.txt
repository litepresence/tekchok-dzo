[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [HINAYANA DISMISSAL]

MISREADING:
Hinayana teachings are primitive or wrong, to be skipped by Dzogchen practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Lesser vehicle" interpreted as inferior value rather than scope.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Missing necessary foundations for understanding emptiness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Shallow Dzogchen practice without grounding in basic Buddhism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE].
