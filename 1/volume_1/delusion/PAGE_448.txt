[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The enumeration of kāyas (resonance kāya, ray kāya, pure kāya, manifestation kāya) is interpreted as asserting multiple truly-existing bodies that manifest progressively as one advances in practice—literal multiplication of forms.

WHY IT ARISES:
Numerical lists (five, six, three, eight) trigger categorical reification. "Kāya" suggests form-body. Western essentialism interprets these as distinct entities or levels of attainment.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of dharmakāya is obscured by multiplicity of forms. Practitioners seek to "achieve" various kāyas as milestones. The natural display (*རྩལ་) of rigpa is replaced by progressive embodiment project.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Resonance kāya of five types" (*གདངས་ཀྱི་སྐུ་རྣམ་པ་ལྔ་) is treated as something to manifest. "Ray kāya of six" (*ཟེར་གྱི་སྐུ་དྲུག་) becomes another attainment. The formless ground is forgotten in fascination with form.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—belief in truly existing subtle bodies. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as practitioners strive to manifest specific kāyas. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as kāya-hierarchy is taught as path.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The presentation of kāyas as "abiding in the citadel" and appearing "when appropriate" is interpreted through tantric framework—as deity yoga where forms are generated through practice and stabilized through time.

WHY IT ARISES:
Familiarity with generation-stage (*bskyed rim*) practice causes projection. "Appearing" (*སྣང་) suggests production. The detailed typology mirrors tantric maṇḍala architecture.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen view collapses into tantric deity yoga. Thodgal becomes advanced generation practice. The naturally abiding (*གནས་) display is replaced by deliberately generated forms.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Self-existing essence kāya" (*ངོ་བོ་སྐུ་) is interpreted as generated deity. "Eight manifestation kāyas" (*རྣམ་པའི་སྐུ་བརྒྱད་) are treated as advanced attainments. Trekcho becomes dissolution; thodgal becomes generation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] produces [PRACTICE ERROR] where thodgal is practiced as completion-stage deity yoga. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows as texts are interpreted through tantric hermeneutics. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The statement that "from the kāya light-rays radiate causing bindu resonance in channels" is interpreted as literal physiological process—asserting that wisdom-forms actually emit light that creates physical effects in energetic anatomy.

WHY IT ARISES:
Process language (*འཕྲོ་, *གདངས་) triggers mechanistic reading. "Radiating" suggests physical emission. Western scientific bias interprets energetic descriptions as physical processes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal is reduced to subtle physics—light waves, resonances, channel-effects. The direct recognition of awareness-nature is lost in mechanical explanations. "Wisdom" becomes subtle energy phenomenon.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The "sphere of the basis" (*གཞི་གནས་ཀྱི་དབྱིངས་) is treated as container for processes. "Measure of expanse exhaustion" (*དབྱིངས་ཟད་པའི་ཚད་) becomes measurable achievement. Natural display is reduced to mechanics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is compared to other energy-based systems. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as practitioners seek to manipulate these processes. [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.
