[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL MISREADING]

MISREADING:
"Primordial awakening" implies a time when awakening first occurred, creating temporal sequence in the ground.

WHY IT ARISES:
Narrative structure suggests chronological events. Language of "before" samsara-nirvana triggers temporal thinking.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Ground acquires temporal extension, contradicting its atemporal nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Confusion about whether recognition "restores" an original state or creates something new.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ETERNALISTIC ERROR].
