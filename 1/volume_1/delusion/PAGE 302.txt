[12558-12571]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SPATIALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "cave of samsara" ('khor ba'i dong) and "door closed by ignorance" are understood as actual locations and physical barriers.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The tendency to concretize abstract processes supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Liberation becomes escape from a place rather than recognition of the nature of appearing. Samsara is reified as a container.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice is oriented toward leaving samsara rather than recognizing its nature. The non-dual teaching is undermined by dualistic spatialization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [DUALISTIC ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "four wisdoms" (shes rab bzhi) are treated as sequential stages of practice to be cultivated over time.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumerated list suggests progressive stages. Linear temporal frameworks interpret practice as development through stages.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Simultaneous recognition is replaced by gradual cultivation. The wisdoms, which are aspects of one recognition, are pursued separately.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner exhausts themselves trying to master each wisdom sequentially, missing that they are spontaneously present.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GRADUALIST ERROR] and [EFFORT ERROR].

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Sun and moon realm" (nyi ma can) is understood as an actual pure land or destination to reach through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Directional language suggests destination. The desire for a safe haven supports literalization of pure lands.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes journey toward a goal. The recognition that pure land is the nature of one's own mind is entirely missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Future-oriented practice replaces present recognition. The teaching that buddhafields are appearances of rig pa becomes mere belief.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR] and [FUTURIZATION ERROR].

[12594-12607]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The narrative of "Field Broad" (yul yangs pa can), the teacher "Light-Spread" ('od 'gyed pa), and the siblings is read as historical account.

WHY IT ARISES:
Proper names and narrative coherence trigger historical reading. Cultural conditioning toward literal interpretation of scriptures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic anatomy being taught—how rig pa and spontaneous presence relate—is missed entirely. Narrative becomes entertainment or mythology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader accumulates "knowledge" about the story without recognizing the mirror-like nature of their own awareness being pointed to.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [INFORMATIONAL ERROR] and [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR].
