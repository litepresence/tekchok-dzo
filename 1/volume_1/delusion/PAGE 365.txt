[REIFICATION ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The elaborate descriptions of channels extending from the crown wheel to various body parts (ears, forehead, eyes, tongue, nose) constitute an anatomical atlas that should be memorized for accurate practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed spatial descriptions resemble anatomical charts. Academic training values such systematic mapping as foundational knowledge for any embodied practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Anatomical knowledge is mistaken for practice preparation. The practitioner studies channel maps extensively before beginning practice, believing this knowledge necessary for correct practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Preparation becomes interminable. The practitioner delays actual recognition practice indefinitely, accumulating ever more detailed anatomical knowledge.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "channels of the enjoyment wheel" (longs spyod 'khor lo'i rtsa) are specialized pathways for experiencing bliss that can be opened through specific practices to generate tantric bliss experiences.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "enjoyment" (longs spyod) and wheel imagery suggest a pleasure-generation system. Tantric associations with bliss practices invite this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a technique for generating blissful states. The practitioner works to "open" enjoyment channels to produce pleasurable experiences mistaken for realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Hedonic fixation replaces view-based recognition. The practitioner pursues somatic pleasure as spiritual accomplishment, confusing bliss sensations with wisdom.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of channels in the tongue and their connection to taste/speech implies that controlling these channels through specific tongue positions or speech practices can control consciousness and produce realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
The connection between tongue channels and cognitive functions suggests a causal pathway. Readers familiar with mantra or pranayama practices map these frameworks onto the description.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a technique of tongue/channel manipulation. The practitioner adopts specific mouth/tongue positions believing they will produce awakening.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
External technique replaces direct recognition. The practitioner believes realization can be caused by correct physical positioning rather than recognition of always-already-present nature.
