[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that base and base-display have inner/outer dimensions, subtle/outer appearances. A reader might think: "This describes the actual structure of the base - it has inner and outer aspects, subtle and outer dimensions. This is the architecture of reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial metaphors create mental maps. "Inner/outer," "subtle/outer" suggest a geography of reality. We naturally imagine this structure as the actual layout of existence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies spatial metaphors as ontological structure. The base has "inner" and "outer" dimensions that are real features of existence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Creating maps of inner/outer dimensions
2. Seeking the "inner" dimension
3. Privileging subtle over outer
4. Missing that spatial terms are metaphors

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (spatial metaphors as real) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (mapping reality) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking inner dimensions). The practitioner explores inner space.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states that if there were no compassion arising in spontaneous self-resonance, samsara and nirvana would be separate sections, not fitting as tamer and tamed. A reader might think: "This explains the necessity of compassion - without it, there's no relationship between samsara and nirvana. Compassion bridges the gap."

WHY IT ARISES:
We want explanations for why things are the way they are. The necessity of compassion explains the functional relationship between samsara and nirvana. This satisfies our causal thinking.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats compassion as the necessary bridge between samsara and nirvana. This becomes a metaphysical principle - compassion makes enlightenment possible.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying compassion as metaphysical necessity
2. Studying compassion's role in cosmology
3. Debating the mechanics of compassion
4. Missing that compassion is activity, not principle

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (compassion as principle) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (compassion cosmology) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching compassion mechanics). The practitioner theorizes love.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that sentient beings' self-appearance is deluded while Buddhas' self-face is pure, therefore displays are not the same. A reader might think: "This shows there are two types of appearance - deluded (sentient beings) and pure (Buddhas). These are fundamentally different kinds of display."

WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic thinking naturally creates categories. "Deluded" vs "pure" appearance suggests two distinct types. We imagine these as ontologically different displays.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates dualistic ontology of appearances. Deluded and pure become two fundamentally different types of display with different natures.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dualistic view of appearance types
2. Seeking pure appearances
3. Rejecting deluded appearances
4. Missing that difference is in seeing, not display

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (dualistic appearances) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking pure displays) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (appearance-based discrimination). The practitioner judges appearances.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states that although displays are not the same, sentient beings' benefit arises because there is compassion in the base, shining forth from base-display. A reader might think: "So compassion is really in the base, objectively present, shining forth to benefit beings. This explains how enlightenment activity works."

WHY IT ARISES:
We want compassion to be objectively real, not just a human quality. If compassion is "in the base," it provides ontological grounding for ethical action. This satisfies our need for cosmic justice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies compassion as objectively present in the base. This becomes cosmic compassion - an inherent feature of reality that ensures benefit for beings.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying compassion as cosmic principle
2. Trusting in base-compassion rather than cultivating it
3. Cosmic justification for ethical action
4. Missing that compassion is expressed, not inherent

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (compassion as inherent) → REIFICATION ERROR (cosmic compassion) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching inherent compassion). The practitioner trusts the universe.
