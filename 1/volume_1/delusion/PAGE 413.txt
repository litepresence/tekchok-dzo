[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]

MISREADING:
Taking "chos sku" (dharmakaya) as complete non-existence or voidness, interpreting "beyond mind" as meaning absolutely nothing.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Las 'das pa" (beyond/transcending) suggests going beyond existence. Combined with "empty," this leads to nihilistic interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The luminous aspect of dharmakaya is dismissed. Practice becomes lifeless negation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students celebrate emptiness as nothingness. The union of emptiness and appearance is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC view, then to MEDITATIONISM of blank absorption, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL denial of appearance.

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "lhag med" (without remainder) as a final state where all phenomena completely disappear.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Without remainder" suggests total absence. Students assume this is the ultimate goal - complete cessation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The spontaneous presence aspect is rejected as impure remainder. Students seek total annihilation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes death-seeking. Life and experience are rejected as obstacles.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC pursuit of cessation, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of existence vs. cessation, and finally to PRACTICE harm through rejection of life.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "las dang bag chags thams cad las rnam par dag pa" (pure of all karma and traces) as something to achieve through purification practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Pure" suggests purification process. Students assume they must purify themselves of karma.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural purity is replaced by purification efforts. Students believe they must earn purity through practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes self-improvement project. The recognition that karma is empty from the start is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of purification, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of pure vs. impure, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL focus on cleansing practices.

Lines 00046-00058
[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "rang shar" (self-arisen) as referring to a self-existing nature that spontaneously generates phenomena from itself.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Self-arisen" suggests autonomous creative power. Students imagine a self-existent generator.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The lack of inherent existence is replaced by belief in inherent spontaneous generation. Dharmakaya becomes a creator.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students worship spontaneous presence as divine. The emptiness of all phenomena is forgotten.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC theism, then to ONTOLOGICAL reification of spontaneous presence, and finally to SCHOLARLY construction of Dzogchen theology.
