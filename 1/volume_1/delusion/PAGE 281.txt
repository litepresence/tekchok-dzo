[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "tame and tame-maker as relate is" and quotes the Secret Essence on great compassion relating all six realms. A reader might think: "This proves everything is fundamentally connected through compassion—a cosmic web of interrelatedness where all beings are linked."

WHY IT ARISES:
Modern spirituality emphasizes "interconnectedness" and "oneness." The language of "relate" and "six realms appearing" triggers New Age associations of universal connection. Western practitioners seek confirmation of a benevolent, interconnected universe.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies "compassion" as a cosmic force connecting everything, like an energy field. They believe recognizing this interconnectedness IS the Dzogchen view, conflating Mahayana compassion teachings with Atiyoga's primordial purity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Compassion becomes an object of meditation rather than spontaneous expression
2. The practitioner seeks experiences of "universal oneness"
3. Dzogchen is reduced to a philosophy of interconnectedness
4. Actual recognition of rigpa is missed while seeking connection

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified interconnectedness) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (cultivating compassion experiences) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching "we are all one" as Dzogchen). The practitioner becomes a compassion activist without genuine view.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes how light-tone awareness base and appearing-aspect must exist for the five elements to be clear, and how without non-duality, the three doors cannot relate. A reader might think: "The base is like a container that holds awareness and appearance. Without this container, nothing could exist."

WHY IT ARISES:
Our habitual reification makes us imagine a "space" in which things exist. The text's functional language ("if X not exist, Y not arise") triggers the assumption of a substantial base that enables existence, like a field or ground.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner conceives the base as a metaphysical ground or substrate underlying reality—a "thing" that makes other things possible. They picture awareness "in" the base like water in a bowl.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Base becomes an object of meditation ("resting in the base")
2. The practitioner seeks to "merge" with this ground
3. Dzogchen becomes substance metaphysics
4. The non-reified nature of rigpa is completely missed

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified base as ultimate substance) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking union with the base) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (creating dualism between base and appearances). The practitioner worships a metaphysical abstraction.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text says if body-like appearance did not exist, the purpose of bodies appearing would not come, and if wisdom-like appearance did not exist, there would be the defect of no wisdom-appearance on the path. A reader might think: "The text is proving that these appearances DO exist as real qualities of the base—they're listing the 'features' of Buddha-nature."

WHY IT ARISES:
The refutation of "non-existence" feels like affirmation of existence. Western logic training makes us read "if X didn't exist, Y would not happen" as proof that X exists. The practitioner seeks a positive description of Buddha-nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner compiles a list of existent qualities of the base: body-appearance, wisdom-appearance, liberation-appearance, etc. These become reified attributes of a Buddha-nature that "has" qualities like a possession.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Buddha-nature becomes a "thing" with properties
2. The practitioner seeks to realize these qualities as existent
3. Dzogchen becomes a descriptive metaphysics
4. Emptiness of qualities is ignored

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (qualities as truly existent) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (debating which qualities belong to Buddha-nature) → PRACTICE ERROR (trying to acquire qualities). The practitioner collects attributes like merit badges.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes impure appearances as arising through the door of spontaneous presence, like a window allowing pure/impure appearances to be seen. A reader might think: "Spontaneous presence is like a projector screen where both pure and impure movies play. The screen itself is neutral but allows everything to appear."

WHY IT ARISES:
The window/skylight metaphor is vivid and concrete. Westerners latch onto metaphors and take them literally. The idea of a "neutral ground" that permits all appearances seems profound and practical.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as a neutral medium or capacity for appearance—a kind of universal potentiality that "can" show pure or impure. They try to "rest" in this spontaneous presence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Spontaneous presence becomes a meditation object
2. The practitioner tries to "purify" what appears on the "screen"
3. The inseparability of primordial purity and spontaneous presence is lost
4. Lhun grub is grasped as superior to kun gzhi (alaya)

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers REIFICATION ERROR (lhun grub as medium) → PRACTICE ERROR (meditating on spontaneous presence) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (dualism between purity and presence). The practitioner becomes a metaphysical projectionist.
