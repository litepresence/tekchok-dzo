[OBJECT ERROR] [EXPERIENCE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18607-18641 describe three types of object wisdom (yul gyi ye shes): "wisdom of appearances" (snang ba'i ye shes), "wisdom of emptiness" (stong pa'i ye shes), and "wisdom of objects" (yul gyi ye shes). The reader understands these as different experiences or states to be achieved.

WHY IT ARISES:
The threefold classification suggests a complete typology. The object-oriented language suggests wisdom is about objects.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is objectified as having content or being about something. The non-referential nature of recognition is obscured.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may cycle through seeking different wisdom-types. New forms of goal-orientation develop.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [OBJECTIFICATION ERROR] where wisdom becomes content, [CYCLING ERROR] where practitioners move between states, and [TYPE FIXATION] where categories are reified.

[GRADUATION ERROR] [PROGRESS ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18643-18660 describe experience "increasing like the waxing moon" and mention "signs" and "marks" of progress. The reader sees this as describing necessary developmental stages.

WHY IT ARISES:
The developmental language suggests gradual growth. The lunar metaphor implies predictable progression.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is temporalized as a process with stages. What is timeless appears as developing over time.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners evaluate practice by "progress" and "signs." Self-evaluation and comparison develop.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [STAGE ERROR] where path has stages, [SELF-EVALUATION ERROR] where progress is measured, and [EXPECTATION ERROR] where signs are awaited.

[MOON ERROR] [PHASE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18643-18652 compare wisdom's increase to "the waxing moon" from new to full. The reader literalizes this as practice phases.

WHY IT ARISES:
The lunar metaphor suggests natural progression. The specificity implies precise mapping.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphor is literalized as actual practice stages.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners evaluate themselves by "moon phase."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PHASE FIXATION] where lunar stages map to practice and [CALENDAR ERROR] where days are counted.

---

[SIGN ERROR] [INDICATOR ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18653-18660 describe "signs" and "marks" of wisdom. The reader treats these as reliable indicators.

WHY IT ARISES:
Signs suggest objective indicators. Specificity implies systematic observation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Signs become objectified as reliable wisdom-indicators.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners become obsessed with sign-watching.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SIGN FIXATION] where indicators are watched and [PRODUCTION ERROR] where signs are manufactured.

---

[COMPLETION ERROR] [FULLNESS ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18643-18652 mention "full moon complete" as goal. The reader understands this as final attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Full moon suggests completion. The metaphor implies endpoint.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Full moon is reified as final achievement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners await "full moon" completion.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GOAL ERROR] where completion is pursued and [DISSATISFACTION] where current state is rejected.
