[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Taking "chos nyid" (dharmata/reality) as a metaphysical essence or ultimate truth that exists independently.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Reality" suggests something true and existent. Students assume this is a metaphysical entity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The empty nature of dharmata is reified into an ultimate reality. Students believe in truly existent truth.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes metaphysics. The recognition that dharmata is ungraspable is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC view of absolute reality, then to MEDITATIONISM of truth-seeking, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL substantialism.

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "man ngag" (oral instruction/pith) as secret techniques requiring formal transmission rituals.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Oral instruction" suggests special teachings. Students assume these require elaborate initiations.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct pointing is replaced by ritual transmission. Students believe they lack the necessary empowerments.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes initiation-seeking. The simplicity of recognition is obscured by complexity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL institutionalization, then to MEDITATIONISM of ritual practice, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of transmission.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "bsgom" (meditate/cultivate) as deliberate mental fabrication or imagination practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Cultivate" suggests deliberate development. Students assume this means making something happen.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural meditation is replaced by fabrication. Students deliberately create experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes imagination. The unfabricated nature is obscured by deliberate creation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of visualization, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between fabricated and natural, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through artificiality.

[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "med pa" (non-existence/absence) in the context of emptiness as meaning complete nothingness or void.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Non-existence" naturally suggests absence. Students assume emptiness means nothing is real.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The luminous aspect of emptiness is dismissed. Practice becomes nihilistic negation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students devalue all appearance. The middle way is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC view, then to MEDITATIONISM of blank mind, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL denial of appearance.
