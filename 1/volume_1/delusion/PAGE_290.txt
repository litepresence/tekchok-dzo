[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, BODILY ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes dependent origination through body-mind: "Body mind with together that also moment first to delude this self samsara first is." A reader might think: "Samsara starts with the body-mind connection. I need to work with my body to liberate my mind, or transcend the body-mind complex entirely."

WHY IT ARISES:
Body-mind language triggers somatic approaches. Western somatic practitioners want to work with embodiment. "First" suggests origin in the body to address.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates body-based practices to address "first delusion," seeking somatic liberation. They reify body-mind as the locus of samsara to work through.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Body becomes obstacle to transcend
2. Somatic practices replace recognition
3. Embodiment is rejected for disembodied rigpa
4. The non-dual body-mind is split

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates BODILY ERROR (somatic fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (body-based methods) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (body-mind dualism). The practitioner tries to escape their body.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, LINEAR ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists the twelve links: "Samsara all-by-means-of first not-distinguish make-not-possess nature from object grasp-by-means-of object arise and thought grasp from different appear object grasp connection twelve-as samsara first." A reader might think: "These are the twelve stages of samsara I need to understand in sequence. If I can trace them backward, I can reverse samsara."

WHY IT ARISES:
Lists trigger sequential thinking. Western linear minds want to follow the chain. Reversibility suggests the chain can be undone through understanding.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner traces the twelve links linearly, seeking to reverse them through understanding. They treat dependent origination as a reversible process.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Twelve links are memorized sequentially
2. Reversal strategy is planned
3. The circular nature is missed
4. Dzogchen becomes linear problem-solving

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates LINEAR ERROR (sequential thinking) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding chain) → PRACTICE ERROR (reversal strategy). The practitioner tries to walk backward up the chain.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PROCESS ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes bardo and death: "life one even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first self face not-know is ignorance outer breath cut time die by that interval dependent-origination manner enters." A reader might think: "This is describing the actual process of death and bardo entry. I need to prepare for this process so I can recognize at death."

WHY IT ARISES:
Death and bardo are existentially compelling. Westerners fear death and want preparation. The description sounds like a map of the dying process to master.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates death-preparation practices, trying to memorize the bardo stages. They anxiously prepare for future recognition at death.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Present recognition is abandoned for future preparation
2. Death anxiety drives practice
3. Bardo is feared as real transition
4. Living recognition is missed while preparing for dying

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PROCESS ERROR (death preparation) → PRACTICE ERROR (bardo memorization) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (future recognition). The practitioner lives for their death.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, NIHILISTIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "aggregates five and faculties five limbs five and essences five objects five and afflictions five minds five mentals five thoughts five grasped-grasper samsara accomplished." A reader might think: "All these fives are just constructions that accomplish samsara. None of them really exist. I should dismiss all these lists as empty."

WHY IT ARISES:
The repeated "five" and "accomplished" suggests fabrication. Western nihilists dismiss all lists as empty constructions. The text sounds like it's saying samsara is just made-up.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner dismisses all the five-fold lists as empty constructions, rejecting the detailed analysis. They use emptiness to avoid engaging with the teaching.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Lists are rejected without understanding
2. Nihilism masquerades as emptiness
3. Precise analysis is abandoned
4. Dzogchen becomes dismissal

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates NIHILISTIC ERROR (dismissing all) → PRACTICE ERROR (avoiding analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (nihilism as wisdom). The practitioner emptily dismisses everything.
