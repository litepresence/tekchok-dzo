[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, CLOUD-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "that-also base and base-appearance both to ignorance none although cloud like adventitiously arise by-means-of condition made impure samsara like appear doorway cause made." A reader might think: "Base and appearances are without ignorance but clouds appear adventitiously. I need to see through these clouds to the clear sky of the base."

WHY IT ARISES:
Cloud-sky metaphors are vivid and common. Westerners immediately grasp the metaphor. "Seeing through" seems like the practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner tries to "see through" adventitious clouds to the clear base, creating a practice of penetration.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Clouds are rejected for sky
2. Seeing-through is practiced
3. Adventitious is denied
4. Dzogchen becomes weather watching

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates CLOUD-ERROR (metaphor fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeing through) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (clouds vs sky dualism). The practitioner waits for clear skies.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENT-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These are the five great elements from which all realms arise. I need to understand elemental cosmology to understand manifestation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Elements suggest fundamental building blocks. Western science and occult study elements. Cosmology seems like deep knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies five-element cosmology as explanation for manifestation, seeking elemental understanding.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Elements are reified as causes
2. Cosmology becomes fixation
3. Natural arising is analyzed away
4. Dzogchen becomes elemental science

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ELEMENT-ERROR (cosmological fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (elemental analysis) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as causes). The practitioner becomes an elemental scientist.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, IGNORANCE-TYPE-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes six types of ignorance: "ignorance six-as arise-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of appearance not-know said root mind-by-means-of ignorance and delusion object-by-means-of ignorance and delusion-basis basis-by-means-of ignorance and." A reader might think: "These are six specific ignorances with different causes. I need to identify which type I have and apply the appropriate remedy."

WHY IT ARISES:
Typologies suggest diagnosis and treatment. Western medicine treats by type. Six ignorances seem like conditions to diagnose.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner diagnoses their ignorance type, seeking specific remedies for each category.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Self is analyzed into ignorance types
2. Remedies are applied specifically
3. Natural wisdom is obscured by diagnosis
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual medicine

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates IGNORANCE-TYPE-ERROR (diagnostic fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (type-specific remedies) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as entities). The practitioner becomes their own diagnostician.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, TREE-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text mentions "wish-fulfilling tree spread called Buddha youth vase body-by-means-of blessing from arise-by-means-of tree and egg from arise-by-means-of heat and moisture from hatch one exist." A reader might think: "This is describing cosmogony—how the world arose from a wish-fulfilling tree through heat and moisture. This is mythology to understand."

WHY IT ARISES:
Cosmogonic myths fascinate Westerners. Origin stories feel like deep truth. The tree metaphor suggests creation mythology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies the cosmogony as literal creation myth, seeking to understand world-origins.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Myth is taken as history
2. Origins are sought
3. Present recognition is abandoned
4. Dzogchen becomes mythology

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates TREE-ERROR (cosmogonic literalism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origin for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (myth as history). The practitioner studies creation.
