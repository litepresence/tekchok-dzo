[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes eight doors of appearance-making and eight qualities, including "families six escape-cave self-cut from" and "compassion lasso-by-means-of grasp-for." A reader might think: "These are specific techniques or portals I need to access. The eight doors are stages of realization I must traverse."

WHY IT ARISES:
Numerical lists (eight doors, eight qualities) trigger sequential thinking. Western spiritual practitioners are accustomed to progressive stages, initiations, and levels. The concrete imagery (lasso, escape-cave) suggests practices to perform.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner imagines the eight doors as literal portals or stages to enter sequentially. They attempt to "use" the compassion lasso and "cut" the escape-cave of the six families, turning description into prescription.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. The practitioner seeks to "open" each door through effort
2. Qualities become attainments to achieve
3. Spontaneous display is forced into structured practice
4. The effortless nature of self-liberation is lost

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MEDITATIONISM ERROR (practicing doors) → REIFICATION ERROR (doors as real things to enter) → PRACTICE ERROR (sequential effort instead of instant recognition). The practitioner becomes a spiritual door-to-door salesman.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, NIHILISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "this non-existent beings own-light and cut-off apart-as cut become" and describes non-duality as "distinguish non-existent." A reader might think: "Since nothing exists, distinctions don't matter. Everything is just 'one' without differences. Duality is bad, non-duality is good."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Non-existent" and "distinguish non-existent" are interpreted as nihilistic emptiness. Western practitioners often conflate non-duality with non-discrimination. The text's negations trigger "all is one" thinking.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner denies all distinctions—pure/impure, samsara/nirvana, wisdom/ignorance—as meaningless dualistic concepts. They claim "it's all the same" while missing the functional distinctions the text actually makes.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Complete inability to distinguish correct from incorrect view
2. Rejection of path and practice as "dualistic"
3. Moral relativism under guise of non-duality
4. Genuine wisdom of discernment (shes rab) is abandoned

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers NIHILISTIC ERROR (denying all distinctions) → PRACTICE ERROR (abandoning all method) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching that effort is dualistic). The practitioner dissolves into spiritual mush.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "appear-by-means-of outside and inside all-to pervade-make great-of method as arise" and "simultaneous and gradual" appearances. A reader might think: "There are actual methods that pervade inside and outside. Gradual and simultaneous are two valid approaches I can choose between."

WHY IT ARISES:
The mention of "method" and the pairing of "simultaneous and gradual" suggests options and paths. Western spiritual consumers want choices and personalized approaches. The text's inclusiveness feels like permission to pick one's style.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner believes there are multiple valid approaches to Dzogchen—some gradual, some simultaneous—and that they can choose based on temperament. They miss that the text describes spontaneous arising, not prescribed methods.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Gradual and simultaneous are reified as distinct paths
2. The practitioner picks "gradual" to avoid the demands of instant recognition
3. Dzogchen is diluted into a gradual system
4. The unique Atiyoga view is compromised

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (debating gradual vs sudden) → PRACTICE ERROR (choosing comfortable gradualism) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (paths as truly existent options). The practitioner becomes a spiritual consumer shopping for approaches.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes how impure samsara arises through the door of spontaneous presence, with examples like "leap primordial-wisdom exist-by-means-of" and "pure self-by-means-of pure show." A reader might think: "These are describing psychological processes—how the mind moves from purity to impurity. I need to reverse this process to return to purity."

WHY IT ARISES:
Westerners psychologize everything. The description of delusion arising sounds like a cognitive process to reverse. Terms like "leap" and "show" suggest developmental psychology or therapeutic transformation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner interprets the text as describing psychological development from pure childhood to impure adulthood, seeking therapy or regression to recover original purity. They miss the non-temporal nature of primordial purity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dzogchen becomes depth psychology
2. The practitioner seeks "inner child" or "original self"
3. Primordial is confused with developmental early
4. Recognition becomes psychological insight

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (Dzogchen as psychology) → PRACTICE ERROR (therapeutic methods) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (seeking insight instead of recognition). The practitioner becomes a spiritual psychologist.
