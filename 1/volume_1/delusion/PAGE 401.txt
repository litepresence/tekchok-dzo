[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The bindus falling at the life-channel during pressing and the mixing of wind and light rays are specific techniques to be performed to generate visionary experiences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical physiological descriptions suggest procedural instructions. Western achievement-oriented frameworks seek techniques to produce results.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes technique-driven practice focused on manipulating subtle body elements to force visions, rather than natural self-display of rigpa.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops obsession with "pressing" and physiological manipulation. Five lights become goal to achieve rather than self-arising display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [LITERALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The similes of peacock tail, vulture eye, fish eye, and cat eye describe literal anatomical structures or optical phenomena in the physical eyes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative language suggests physical correspondence. Scientific materialist frameworks seek concrete anatomical correlates.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Four lamps are reduced to ophthalmological phenomena or retinal biology. Visionary experience becomes explainable as physical optics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner examines own eyes seeking peacock-tail patterns or cat-eye reflections. Natural meditative experience is dismissed if not matching descriptions.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MEDICALIZATION ERROR] and [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The blue five-petaled bindu with light-rim is an actual entity or structure located in the subtle body that can be found and observed.

WHY IT ARISES:
Detailed spatial descriptions suggest objective location. Substantialist frameworks interpret all references as pointing to existing things.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
"Lamp of pure sphere" is objectified as subtle body organ or chakra to be visualized or located. Rigpa is confused with bindu-appearance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner searches for "snake-noose fence" in body or visual field. The metaphorical description becomes literal map to be followed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Whoever familiarizes" suggests that through repeated practice and familiarization, one can stabilize this vision and make it permanent.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Familiarization" (*goms*) interpreted as habituation or training. Psychological frameworks emphasize learning and conditioning.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition becomes skill to be developed through repetition. "Unfabricated essence" is pursued through deliberate fabrication.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner accumulates "familiarization time" believing quantity produces quality. Natural state is confused with conditioned attainment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] and [ETERNALISTIC ERROR].
