[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Mind exists—what? Mind-only meaning exist and non-existence stopping" (sems yin pa ni sems tsam don yod pa dang med pa 'gog pa) is interpreted as Buddhist idealism—all is mind, the external world is illusion, consciousness is the only reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Western philosophy's idealism vs materialism debate projects onto Yogācāra and Dzogchen. "Mind-only" (sems tsam) triggers Berkeleyan subjective idealism. Practitioners conflate recognition of mind's nature with metaphysical claim about reality's composition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen view collapses into idealist philosophy. The practitioner debates "is the world real or mind-created?" rather than recognizing the nature of appearance. The critical distinction between cittamātra (mind-only school) and Dzogchen is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Beyond acceptance and rejection" becomes either [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] (reifying mind as ground of being) or [NIHILISTIC ERROR] (denying conventional reality). The practitioner cannot navigate the middle way because they are stuck in ontological commitments.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding that "mind" here refers to awareness-emptiness non-duality (not substantial consciousness), the six directions of mind's category (sems kyi phyogs) cannot be properly engaged. The practitioner develops [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]—believing academic understanding of mind-only philosophy equals Dzogchen realization. They may publish papers on "Dzogchen idealism" while lacking recognition.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Whatever appears is mind" (cir snang sems yin) is interpreted as confirmation that all experience is internal, subjective, and mentally constructed—reducing the world to psychological phenomenon.

WHY IT ARISES:
Psychological reductionism dominates Western thought. "Is mind" triggers subjective interpretation. Practitioners conflate recognition of appearance's nature with psychological analysis of perception.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The self-arising nature of display is missed. "Mind" becomes personal psyche rather than display-emptiness. The practitioner engages in introspective analysis rather than recognition of nature. Phenomenology replaces Dzogchen.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Without cessation" ('gag pa med pa) becomes psychological continuity—the stream of consciousness continuing. The "play of mind's aspects" (sems kyi phyogs kyi rol pa) becomes psychological dynamics rather than wisdom display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without proper understanding, the six directions are engaged as psychological typologies rather than pointing-out instructions. The practitioner develops [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]—endless self-analysis without recognition. When psychological insight does not produce liberation, they conclude "Dzogchen doesn't work" or "I need more therapy before spiritual practice."
