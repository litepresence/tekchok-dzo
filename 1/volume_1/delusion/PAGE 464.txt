[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The general object (spyi'i yul) described as "outer space free of clouds, inner dharmata self-clear, in-between expanding display luminosity" is interpreted as literal description of three ontologically distinct domains or regions of reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Tripartite divisions trigger spatial thinking. "Outer, inner, in-between" triggers dimensional mapping. Western practitioners assume all spatial language describes actual locations rather than recognition-qualities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual nature of the three is missed. The practitioner treats outer, inner, and in-between as separate realms to traverse or align. The pointing function of spatial metaphors collapses into geographical model.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Dharmata self-clear" (chos nyid rang dangs) becomes internal state to achieve. "Space free of clouds" becomes external condition to seek. The practitioner literalizes all spatial language, creating spatialized map of recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding spatial descriptions as pedagogical classifications of recognition, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in dzogchen cosmography. They may attempt to "enter" inner dharmata or "merge" outer and inner, treating recognition as spatial navigation. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] becomes total—all subsequent spatial terminology is read literally. Recognition is externalized into location-based achievement.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The instruction to "look at the self-nature of the eye" (mig gi de bzhin nyid) through "not moving the gate" (sgo mi 'gul ba) is interpreted as literal eye-exercise—holding the eyes physically still in order to see something.

WHY IT ARISES:
Somatic techniques validate through physical control. "Not moving" triggers effortful fixation. Western practitioners assume all instructions involving the body are physical techniques rather than recognition-contexts.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-effort nature of natural gaze is lost. The practitioner strains to hold eyes motionless, creating tension and fixation. Recognition is mistaken for perceptual achievement produced by physical control.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Gaze" (gzigs stangs) becomes muscular effort. "Holding" (bzuang) becomes physical fixation. The practitioner develops ocular tension and headaches, believing this indicates "doing it correctly."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding gaze-instructions as pointing to natural uncontrived recognition, the practitioner develops [PRACTICE ERROR]—aggressive physical manipulation. They may damage vision through forced staring, missing that "not moving" refers to non-distraction rather than physical immobility. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all instructions are read as techniques to execute rather than recognition to allow.
