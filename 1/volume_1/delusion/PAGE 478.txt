[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The remaining 'dra'o 'dra'o verses—liberation-ground ka-dag vs. practice-time ka-dag, rig pa expanding without interruption vs. empty display, etc.—are interpreted as establishing subtle ontological hierarchies.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative structure triggers ranking-assumption. "Ground" vs. "practice" suggests levels. The practitioner wants "ground" status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The equal-nature of all ka-dag is lost. Ground-ka-dag becomes elitist possession. The practitioner believes practice-ka-dag is inferior.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Ground-realized" becomes exclusive identity. Practitioners are ranked by "which ka-dag they have." The authentic recognition that ka-dag is not possessible is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner approaches dedication with ka-dag-hierarchy.

[EXPERIENCE CHASING] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The final 'dra'o 'dra'o verses are interpreted as subtle experience-pairs to be distinguished in practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Phenomenological density triggers experience-expectation. Final content suggests "last chance." The practitioner wants to "get" these experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is replaced by final-experience-chasing. The practitioner seeks "rig pa expanding" versus "empty display" as experiences. Last-chance anxiety consumes practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Final-pair orthodoxy emerges. Teachers promising final-distinction validation gain authority. The authentic recognition that pairs don't matter is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] intensifies through final verses. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by final-chasing.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The absolute final verses trigger "almost done" mentality. The practitioner wants to "finish 'dra'o 'dra'o" and reach colophon.

WHY IT ARISES:
Absolute-final urgency creates maximum momentum. Verse-density creates maximum fatigue. The practitioner wants "closure."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration-function of final verses is completely missed. The practitioner has "read" final 'dra'o 'dra'o without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries maximum rushed-pattern to colophon. Dedication is dismissed as "just ending."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 479's colophon is approached without any integration of Volume 1's teachings.

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The final 'nor ra re refrain is interpreted as final warning about subtlest deviations.

WHY IT ARISES:
Final-warning suggests maximum danger. "Mistaken" triggers final-anxiety. The practitioner fears final-errors.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is suffocated by final-mistake-monitoring. The practitioner checks: "Am I making final subtle mistake?" Final-fear replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Final-paralysis sets in. Colophon-approach is feared as "final test." The authentic recognition that there is no final test is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] carries to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner approaches dedication with final-fear.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The 'dra'o 'dra'o completion is interpreted as establishing dzogchen-practitioners as uniquely possessing final-subtle-discernment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Completion suggests mastery. Sixteen-fold subtlety suggests final-expertise. The practitioner wants final-status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The emptiness-of-all-status teaching is lost. Final-subtlety becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition lacks final-subtlety.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Final-subtle practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Others are deemed "not subtle enough." The authentic recognition that subtlety is not attainment is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner approaches dedication with final-elitism.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The final-pair completion on this page carries directly to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner approaches the volume's end with pair-knowledge but without recognition.
