[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The repeated "similar, similar, but mistaken" ('dra'o 'dra'o nor ra re) verses comparing seemingly identical pairs—mind without thought and awareness without thought, unfabricated mind and wind-mind rest, etc.—are interpreted as claims that subtle differences in quality determine ontological status.

WHY IT ARISES:
Quality-discrimination triggers evaluative thinking. "Mistaken" triggers error-avoidance. Western practitioners assume fine distinctions present essential differences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-context nature of all comparisons is lost. The practitioner believes subtle phenomenological differences are crucial. The pointing function of "mistaken" collapses into phenomenological policing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Uncontrived" becomes quality to achieve. "Unstirred" becomes standard to meet. The practitioner evaluates experience by subtle criteria, creating spiritual discriminating-consciousness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding "mistaken" as pointing to recognition rather than phenomenological quality, the practitioner develops [EPISTEMIC ERROR]—belief in experiential precision. They may obsess over minute distinctions, believing quality-control equals recognition. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—all comparative language is essentialized. Recognition is replaced by phenomenological sophistication.
