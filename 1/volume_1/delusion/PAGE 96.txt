[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [NIHILISTIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"In self-arising wisdom, samsara and nirvana are not established" (rang byung gi ye shes la 'khor 'das su grub pa med pa) is interpreted as "samsara and nirvana don't exist at all"—literal non-existence of all phenomena leading to rejection of conventional reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Extreme interpretation of emptiness teachings. "Not established" triggers existential nihilism. Western practitioners conflate Madhyamaka emptiness with materialist reductionism or existentialist meaninglessness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The two truths collapse into one-sided denial. The practitioner cannot distinguish between "not ultimately established" and "does not exist at all." Relative truth is rejected as illusion while the nature of that illusory appearance is not recognized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Beyond acceptance and rejection" (spang blang las 'das pa) becomes inability to engage in spiritual practice—no path to traverse, no qualities to cultivate, no obscurations to purify. The practitioner develops passive nihilism, claiming Dzogchen view while sinking into ordinary confusion.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without recognition of what IS (the self-arisen wisdom), mere negation leads to [NIHILISTIC ERROR]. The practitioner may abandon Buddhism entirely, claiming "nothing matters," or may develop hostility toward all practice as "dualistic." The "all-liberating wisdom" (thams cad grol ba'i ye shes) becomes philosophical abstraction rather than lived recognition.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"One perfect, two perfect, all perfect" (gcig rdzogs gnyis rdzogs thams cad rdzogs) is interpreted as spiritual complacency—everything is already perfect so no change or improvement is needed or possible.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual bypassing seeks justification for avoiding growth. "Perfect" triggers satisfaction with status quo. Western practitioners conflate "perfect as nature" with "perfect as condition."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The path-then-ground structure collapses. The practitioner mistakes ontological perfection for soteriological completion. While nature is perfect from beginning, recognition is not. The need for practice, purification, and accumulation is denied.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"No created dharma" (byas pa'i chos ni ka nas med) becomes excuse for not studying or practicing. "No deed or doer" (byas dang byed pa med pa) becomes inability to take responsibility. The practitioner develops lazy mysticism, claiming "I'm already Buddha" while remaining ordinary sentient being.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without distinguishing ground from path, the practitioner cannot receive or practice instructions. The [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] develops—believing that hearing the highest view is sufficient, rejecting graduated path as "inferior." When suffering continues, they either blame "karma" as inescapable fate or abandon Dharma as ineffective. The possibility of genuine Atiyoga practice is lost.
