[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DUALITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the distinction between "image" (teaching representations) and "actual" (direct teachings) as establishing an ontological hierarchy where images are inferior copies of transcendent originals.

WHY IT ARISES:
The dualistic structure (two-from/image vs. actual) naturally parses as Platonic copy-original relationship. Western metaphysical habits support this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching becomes a remote transcendent truth accessed through inferior representations. Immanence is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about accessing the "actual" through the "image," creating a quest structure. The recognition that image and actual are non-dual is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All representations are devalued in favor of unmediated access, which is then pursued as a goal.

[MAGICAL ERROR] [TALISMAN ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the descriptions of benefits from carrying and reading the text ("effort without liberation," "disease without," "demon obstacle reverse") as establishing the text as a magical talisman with automatic effects independent of understanding.

WHY IT ARISES:
The instrumental language combined with specific instructions (carry in armpit, read regularly) triggers magical thinking. The mind habitually seeks effortless benefits.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The text becomes a fetish object. The transformative power of understanding is replaced by superstitious reliance on contact with the text.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice degenerates into text-worship or mechanical recitation. The meaning is entirely lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that liberation comes from recognition, not contact with objects, is entirely missed.

[PERFORMATIVE ERROR] [RITUALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the instructions about writing, carrying, and reading the text as establishing necessary ritual procedures for liberation, externalizing the path into object manipulation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific behavioral instructions (write in specific colors, carry in left armpit, read regularly) trigger ritualistic parsing. Behavioral instructions are habitually literalized.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Liberation becomes contingent on proper performance of ritual actions. Inner recognition is subordinated to outer observance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Anxiety about correct performance replaces confidence in recognition. The reader focuses on whether they are "doing it right."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that liberation is recognition of mind nature is replaced by ritual orthopraxy.
