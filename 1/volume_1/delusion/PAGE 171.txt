[STUDENT ELITISM ERROR] [VESSEL ESSENTIALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the description of suitable students ("rigs six seed empty-from, affliction six purify, wisdom six meaning arise") as establishing that only certain people qualify for the teaching, creating spiritual aristocracy.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific qualifications trigger elitist identification. The ego is flattered by being among the chosen.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that dharma is available to all is restricted. The reader develops spiritual pride.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Others are excluded or deemed unworthy. The teaching becomes a marker of status.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The bodhisattva vow to liberate all beings is contradicted by elitist practice.

[ROOT-BRANCH ERROR] [HIERARCHICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the division of gurus into "root" and "branch" as establishing a hierarchy where root gurus have absolute authority and branch gurus are secondary, fragmenting the guru principle.

WHY IT ARISES:
The botanical metaphor (root vs. branch) triggers hierarchical thinking. The need for clear authority supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of the guru principle is fragmented. Competing loyalties develop.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Institutional politics around guru status displace practice. The reader becomes obsessed with guru hierarchies.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that all gurus point to the same nature is entirely lost.

[EXCLUSION ERROR] [CONDEMNATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the descriptions of unsuitable students ("guru not examine student demon," "great completion ati teach not able") as establishing categories of people to be rejected, fostering spiritual arrogance.

WHY IT ARISES:
The negative descriptions trigger judgmental thinking. The desire for purity supports excluding the unworthy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Compassion is replaced by judgment. The reader becomes a gatekeeper.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching becomes a weapon of exclusion rather than liberation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The bodhisattva ideal is entirely lost in elitism.
