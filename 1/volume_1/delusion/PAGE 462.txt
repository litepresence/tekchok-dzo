[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of "distant-reaching lamp" (rgyang zhags sgron ma) as the "essence of the four elements gathered" is interpreted as claiming that awareness is literally composed of elemental essences or that the four elements are the basis of consciousness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Materialist frameworks assume all phenomena must reduce to physical constituents. "Element" (byung ba) triggers chemistry associations. Western practitioners unconsciously apply reductionist frameworks, assuming the text presents a physicalist theory of mind.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual nature of awareness-display is collapsed into elemental composition. The practitioner believes awareness "is made of" refined elements or that consciousness emerges from elemental interactions. The pointing function of elemental metaphors dissolves into reified constituents.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Pervading and entering" (khyab byung) becomes circulation theory. "Holding and engaging" ('dzin 'jug) becomes physiological mechanics. The practitioner literalizes all elemental language, treating subtle body as physical body.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding elemental descriptions as recognition-skills rather than ontological claims, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief that dzogchen presents physicalist cosmology. They may seek to "purify elements" through dietary or environmental interventions, missing that "purification" refers to recognition of primordial purity, not chemical refinement. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] becomes total—all subsequent technical terminology is read through materialist lens.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "wisdom lamp" (shes rab sgron ma) description involving "self-arising wisdom" (shes rab rang byung) and "inner arising from outer resonance" is interpreted as claiming that wisdom literally comes from external appearances or that looking at the world generates insight.

WHY IT ARISES:
Cause-effect reasoning is deeply ingrained. "Arising from" (las shar) triggers causal attribution. Western practitioners assume that if wisdom is described as arising in relation to appearances, appearances must be its cause.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The simultaneous nature of recognition is collapsed into temporal sequence. The practitioner believes they must look at external objects to generate wisdom, treating appearances as fuel for insight-production. Recognition is externalized into perception-based process.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Clarity of words entering the basis" (gsal ba tshig 'jug gzhi ma sdud) becomes study technique. "Burning karma and habitual patterns" (las dang bag chags bsreg) becomes psychological processing. The practitioner turns wisdom into result of appropriate stimuli.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding "arising" as simultaneous display rather than causal production, the practitioner develops [REIFICATION ERROR]—belief that wisdom is product of conditions. They may compulsively seek "inspiring" appearances, believing beautiful sunsets or spiritual art generates realization. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] propagates—other "arising" descriptions throughout the text are read as causal claims. Recognition becomes perceptual achievement rather than nature of cognition.
