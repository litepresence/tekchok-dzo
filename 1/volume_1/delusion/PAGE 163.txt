[NUMEROLOGY ERROR] [ENUMERATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader treats the specific numbers (hundred-thousand sixty-four, thousand, seven) as carrying esoteric mathematical significance, seeking hidden codes rather than recognizing them as conventional designations.

WHY IT ARISES:
The precise numerical values trigger numerological thinking. Sacred numbers are habitually treated as carrying secret meanings requiring decoding.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teachings are approached as ciphers to be decoded rather than pointers to be recognized. The reader becomes a cryptographer rather than a recognizer.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Endless speculation about number meanings replaces direct engagement. Practice is deferred until the code is cracked.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The simple pointing function is obscured by layers of numerical interpretation.

[SUCCESSION ERROR] [GENERATIONAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the sequence of seven teachings and their holders as establishing that authentic transmission requires belonging to the correct generation in an unbroken succession, externalizing authority into institutional lineage.

WHY IT ARISES:
The sequential structure (first, second, third...) combined with possession language ("hold-by-means-of") naturally parses as genealogical succession. Authority habits support reading transmission as institutional.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct recognition is subordinated to proper ordination or authorization. The reader seeks validation from institutional sources rather than self-recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Lineage politics displace practice. The reader becomes concerned with who has "real" transmission rather than recognizing mind nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle that recognition is available to all regardless of lineage is entirely lost.

[TITULAR ERROR] [NOMINAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes fascinated by the elaborate titles and epithets ("mindfulness protector," "mudra self-remember wheel," "rim protector") as establishing a pantheon of distinct deities with specific functions, missing the symbolic function.

WHY IT ARISES:
The proper names and titles trigger devotional or mythological parsing. The mind habitually creates pantheons from lists of powerful names.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The names become objects of worship or complex theological speculation rather than pointers to aspects of awareness. Polytheistic tendencies develop.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The non-dual recognition that all names point to the same nature is lost. The reader fragments the teaching into deity cults.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Practice becomes devotional rather than recognitional, oriented toward specific named powers rather than universal nature.
