[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Spontaneously complete called unconditioned" (lhun grub ces 'dus ma byas pa) is interpreted as doctrine of eternal, unchanging ground of being—the dharmakāya as permanent substratum underlying changing phenomena.

WHY IT ARISES:
Essentialist spirituality seeks "ground of being." "Unconditioned" ('dus ma byas) triggers substantialist interpretation. Western ontological commitments project eternal substance onto emptiness teachings.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The emptiness of the basis is missed. "Spontaneously complete" becomes metaphysical claim about a perfect underlying reality. The practitioner seeks to "return to" or "rest in" this ground, missing that basis is empty of own-nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Primordially established without repetition" (ye gzhag yin pas bskyar du med) becomes claim that enlightenment is once-and-done event, or that one is already enlightened without recognition. The practitioner develops either spiritual complacency or elitism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding spontaneous completion as description of appearance's nature (not metaphysical claim), the practitioner cannot engage "cause-free, unmade" (rgyu med ma byas) correctly. They develop [PRACTICE ERROR]—seeking experiences of "ground" or "source" rather than recognizing present awareness. The view of "beyond extremes" becomes another extreme—reification of ground as beyond.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"The eight stages intellect-examined basis-from deviated dharmas called" (rim pa brgyad po blos brtag gzhi las gol ba'i chos) is interpreted as rejection of all reasoning and philosophy—intellectual examination itself is deviation.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anti-intellectualism in spiritual communities. "Intellect-examined" (blos brtags) triggers rejection of thinking. Practitioners conflate "beyond intellect" with "anti-intellectual," "non-conceptual" with "pre-conceptual."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pramāṇa tradition is abandoned. The practitioner cannot distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect, valid inference from speculation. All analysis is rejected equally, including analysis that points to beyond-analysis.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Deviated" (gol ba) is applied to anyone engaging philosophical precision. The practitioner develops pride in ignorance, claiming "I don't need to study, I'm beyond concepts." Sophisticated pointing-out instructions are missed because they require philosophical preparation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without ability to reason, the practitioner falls prey to every [EPISTEMIC ERROR]. They cannot distinguish genuine teaching from counterfeit, valid realization from delusion. The [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] becomes total—accepting any charismatic teacher's claims, falling for every deviation mentioned in the text because they lack tools to recognize deviation. The entire path collapses into gullibility.
