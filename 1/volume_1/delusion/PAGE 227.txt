[ERROR TAGS]
[REIFICATION ERROR] [RITUALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader treats empowerment procedures as external magical transmissions rather than pointing-out instructions, developing dependency on ritual validation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The ritual language triggers institutional religious frameworks. The desire for authorized transmission supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct recognition is subordinated to ritual completion. Practice becomes about receiving rather than recognizing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching that empowerment is recognizing one's own nature is entirely lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent practice becomes ritual performance rather than direct recognition.
