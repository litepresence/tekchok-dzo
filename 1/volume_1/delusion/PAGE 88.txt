[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The five manifest enlightenments (gdan, sku, gsung, thugs, ye shes) are interpreted as five sequential stages of actual transformation, wherein the practitioner literally generates deities through progressive visualization steps.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumerative structure invites hierarchical processing. Western practitioners trained in developmental psychology and step-by-step methodology naturally map these five onto sequential stages of achievement. The concrete imagery (lotus, sun, moon, syllables) triggers visualization-as-construction rather than recognition-of-nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The generation stage (bskyed rim) collapses into fabrication therapy—meditation becomes an act of building something not present rather than recognizing what is. The practitioner develops subtle spiritual materialism, measuring progress by clarity of visualization rather than recognition of mind's nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deity yoga becomes dissociative fantasy. The samaya of "self and deity as brothers" is understood as role-play rather than wisdom recognition. Practitioners develop anxiety about "incorrect visualization" and seek ever-more elaborate details, mistaking complexity for profundity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The three concentrations (de bzhin nyid, kun tu snang, de bzhin rgyu) are then practiced as separate techniques rather than three aspects of one wisdom. This leads to [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]—believing that time spent in concentration equals spiritual progress. Eventually the practitioner cannot integrate practice with daily activity, creating a split between "session" and "post-session" that makes authentic Mahāyoga view impossible.

[PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Viewing self and deity as brothers and friends" (bdag dang lha gnyis spun dang grogs ltar lta ba) is interpreted as psychological rapport-building—establishing a friendly inner relationship with the deity as one would with a helpful imaginary friend or internalized supportive figure.

WHY IT ARISES:
Contemporary therapeutic frameworks privilege relational dynamics. The language of "brothers and friends" triggers attachment theory and object relations interpretations. Western readers project psychodynamic models onto tantric samaya.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual samaya collapses into transactional relating. The practitioner approaches deity as "other" to be befriended, missing that "brother" here means "same nature, same source" (chos sku'i spun). The result is devotional practice without wisdom foundation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dam tshig becomes behavioral contract rather than natural expression of realized view. The practitioner develops dependency on "deity presence" as comfort object. When visualization fades or difficulties arise, they experience abandonment anxiety rather than recognizing self-liberation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Progressive misreading leads to [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—reifying the deity as permanent protector figure. This blocks entry to completion stage teachings where deity dissolves into emptiness. The practitioner becomes stuck in generation stage as permanent refuge rather than transitional method.
