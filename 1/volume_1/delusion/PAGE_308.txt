[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Not even a hair was harmed" is understood as miraculous preservation or magical protection rather than teaching on the non-damage of recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Miraculous survival suggests magical power. The desire for protection supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that rig pa cannot be harmed by delusion is replaced by belief in magical protection. Ontological safety becomes magical safety.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks magical protection rather than recognition. The imperturbable nature of awareness is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"First did not depart" suggests that samsara and enlightenment are eternally fixed states with no possibility of change or transformation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"From the first" suggests eternal pre-existence. Essentialist frameworks interpret this as fixed nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Path and practice become meaningless. "Already enlightened" becomes excuse for non-practice while remaining in delusion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner adopts "nothing to do" stance without recognition. The dynamic of recognition is replaced by static eternalism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The king's divination and sending away the queen is interpreted as misogynistic political narrative rather than teaching on how conceptual mind sends away pure awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on rgyu rkyen (cause and condition) and the conceptual mind's relationship to pure awareness is lost. Dzogchen becomes political commentary.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader focuses on gender/politics while missing the technical content. The bar do instructions encoded in the narrative remain unrecognized.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [POLITICIZATION ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].

[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The queen's ornaments, fast horse, sharp weapons, etc. are understood as actual preparations for journey rather than twenty-one pointing-out instructions.

The twenty-one pointing-out instructions (ngo sprod nyi shu rtsa gcig) are entirely missed. Technical Dzogchen content becomes travel narrative.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner reads the story without receiving the instructions. The practical guidance for bar do recognition is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
