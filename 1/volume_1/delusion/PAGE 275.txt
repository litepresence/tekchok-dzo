[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the base as vast like space, clear like crystal, uninterrupted, appearing yet unestablished, with five lights naturally present. A reader might think: "This is describing the actual nature of the base - vast space-like awareness, crystal clarity, five lights. These are the real characteristics of ultimate reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
Rich descriptive language evokes vivid imagery. We naturally visualize these characteristics and assume they describe what the base "really is." The metaphors become the reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the descriptions as the inherent nature of the base. "Vast like space," "clear like crystal" become ontological claims about the ultimate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking experiences of space-like vastness
2. Cultivating crystal clarity as a state
3. Looking for five lights in meditation
4. Missing that descriptions are pointers, not properties

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (metaphors as properties) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking described states) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (descriptive metaphysics). The practitioner chases descriptions.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that from this base, through the doorway of spontaneous self-arisen rigpa, the six realms appear. A reader might think: "So the six realms come from the base through rigpa. This explains the origin of samsara - it emanates from the pure base."

WHY IT ARISES:
Origin explanations satisfy our causal thinking. We want to know where samsara comes from. The idea that it "comes from" the base suggests a creation story.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a cosmogony - samsara arising from the pure base. This becomes a narrative of fall from purity, or manifestation of the unmanifest.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Viewing samsara as emanation from purity
2. Seeking to return to the source
3. Creating temporal sequence: base → display
4. Missing that base and display are not sequential

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (cosmogonical narrative) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking return to source) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (source as prior). The practitioner seeks the origin.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states that deluded appearances are like dreams - not established in primordial purity's ground, naturally returning to it. A reader might think: "So delusions are like dreams - unreal, returning to the real ground. The practice is to let them naturally return, not to do anything."

WHY IT ARISES:
The dream analogy suggests effortless liberation. Dreams naturally fade - so too delusions naturally return to purity. This appeals to spiritual laziness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts "natural return" as passive practice. "Just let it be" becomes an excuse for non-practice, waiting for delusions to naturally disappear.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Passive waiting for natural liberation
2. Justifying inaction as "natural practice"
3. Avoiding engaged transformative work
4. Missing that recognition requires engagement

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (passive waiting) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (avoidance) → NIHILISTIC ERROR (nothing to do). The practitioner waits for enlightenment.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains the crucial distinction between self-appearance and common appearance, how in bardo one's own six realms appear, and the two aspects of whether they function or not. A reader might think: "This is explaining the technical details of how appearances work. These are the mechanics of the bardo and manifestation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical explanations satisfy intellectual curiosity. We want to understand "how it works." The mechanics of appearance become a fascinating subject of study.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the text as technical manual explaining mechanics. Bardo, self-appearance, and common appearance become subjects of scholarly analysis.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Studying mechanics of appearance
2. Debating technical details
3. Speculating about bardo mechanics
4. Missing that mechanics are imputed, not inherent

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (mechanical analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding mechanics as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching mechanics). The tradition becomes technical.
