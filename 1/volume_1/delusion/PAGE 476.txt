[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The distinction between deity-yogic body (yi dam lha'i sgyu lus) and dharmata bardo appearance (chos nyid bar do) is interpreted as claim that some appearances are "real" (dzogchen) while others are merely "mental constructs" (lower vehicles).

WHY IT ARISES:
Hierarchical thinking privileges "direct" over "constructed." "Dharmata" triggers authenticity-association. Western practitioners assume comparative descriptions present ontological hierarchy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-in-all-appearances nature is obscured. The practitioner believes some appearances are inherently superior. The pointing function of comparison collapses into appearance-elitism.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Dharmata" becomes exclusive club. "Deity yoga" becomes beginner practice. The practitioner devalues legitimate methods while lacking recognition itself.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding distinctions as recognition-contexts rather than ontological hierarchies, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in dzogchen exceptionalism. They may reject all structured practice prematurely, claiming direct recognition while confused. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all comparative language is hierarchicalized. Recognition is replaced by method-denigration.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The distinctions between natural nirmanakaya pure lands and travel-accomplished Buddha fields, or between thigle of light-essence and rainbow-thigle from wind-mind binding, are interpreted as literal descriptions of actually-existing locations or substances with different properties.

WHY IT ARISES:
Cosmological language triggers literal mapping. "Pure land" triggers geographical imagination. Western practitioners assume pure-land descriptions present ontological geography.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-nature of all pure-land language is lost. The practitioner believes in literal Buddha-fields with addresses. The pointing function of pure-land description collapses into spiritual tourism.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Natural" pure land becomes destination. "Accomplished" pure land becomes lesser location. The practitioner evaluates pure lands by ontological status, creating spiritual geography.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding pure-land language as recognition-pointers, the practitioner develops [REIFICATION ERROR]—belief in literal pure lands. They may aspire to rebirth in "better" fields, missing recognition here. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—all spatial language is literalized. Recognition is replaced by destination-aspiration.
