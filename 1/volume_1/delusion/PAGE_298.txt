[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENTAL-ORIGIN-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These elements are the actual primordial substances from which all existence physically manifests. Mastering the elements means mastering manifestation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Elemental metaphysics appeals to Western esoteric traditions. The systematic correspondence between elements and realms suggests hidden natural laws. Physicalist thinking seeks material causes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the five elements as metaphysical forces generating reality, attempting to harness elemental power for spiritual ends.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Elements are reified as causal forces
2. Realm manifestation becomes control project
3. Natural purity is obscured by elemental work
4. Dzogchen becomes elemental sorcery

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ELEMENTAL-ORIGIN-ERROR (force reification) → PRACTICE ERROR (elemental manipulation) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as creative powers). The practitioner becomes an elemental sorcerer.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SIX-IGNORANCE-DIAGNOSIS-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text enumerates six ignorances: "ignorance six-as arise root mind-by-means-of ignorance and delusion object-by-means-of ignorance and delusion-basis basis-by-means-of ignorance and grasp thought-by-means-of ignorance and remedy path-by-means-of ignorance and not-know confuse-by-means-of ignorance." A reader might think: "These are six distinct pathologies of mind requiring specific diagnoses and treatments. I need to identify which afflict me."

WHY IT ARISES:
Medical typologies promise precision healing. Western diagnostic culture categorizes dysfunction. The six-fold classification invites self-analysis.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner diagnostically examines their experience for these six ignorance types, seeking targeted interventions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Experience is medicalized into pathologies
2. Remedies are prescribed by diagnosis
3. Natural self-liberation is replaced with treatment
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual pathology

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SIX-IGNORANCE-DIAGNOSIS-ERROR (pathological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (targeted interventions) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as diseases). The practitioner becomes a spiritual psychiatrist.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOGONIC-LITERALISM-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the wish-fulfilling tree, Buddha's blessing, eggs, heat and moisture, and world arising from Jambudvipa. A reader might think: "This is the literal account of cosmic creation. Understanding this cosmogony reveals the fundamental structure of reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
Origin myths satisfy existential questioning. Western literalists seek historical truth in myths. The vivid imagery suggests hidden cosmological knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner interprets the cosmogony as factual history, studying world-origins instead of recognizing mind's nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Myth is historicized
2. Present recognition is postponed for origin-knowledge
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen becomes creationism

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COSMOGONIC-LITERALISM-ERROR (myth as history) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origins for truth) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (creation as fact). The practitioner studies Genesis instead of recognizing.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, MIND-TYPOLOGY-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text catalogues: "Ignorance and equal mind and mind consciousness mind and all seek mind and certainty put mind and aspect coarse mind and definitely place mind." A reader might think: "These are distinct categories of mental function I can identify in my experience. Mastering this typology gives comprehensive mind-knowledge."

WHY IT ARISES:
Classification systems promise mastery. Western cognitive science categorizes mental functions. The detailed typology invites academic study.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner categorizes their mental states according to this system, seeking complete mental mapping.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mind is fragmented into categories
2. Experience is catalogued rather than recognized
3. Natural clarity is obscured by classification
4. Dzogchen becomes cognitive taxonomy

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MIND-TYPOLOGY-ERROR (classificatory fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (mental cataloguing) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mind as category-system). The practitioner becomes a librarian of their own mind.
