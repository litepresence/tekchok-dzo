[13273-13283]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed embryological process is interpreted as literal scientific account or as entirely symbolic without recognizing it encodes stages of practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Scientific detail suggests accuracy. Symbolic language suggests mere metaphor. The middle way of encoded instruction is missed.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on how delusion develops and can be recognized is either dismissed as pre-scientific or appreciated as literature without practice content.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader either rejects or enjoys the text without receiving the instruction. The esoteric content remains hidden.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCIENTISM ERROR] or [LITERARY ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The nine months of gestation is understood as literal temporal requirement for spiritual development rather than symbolic of recognition's maturation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Nine months" suggests pregnancy duration. Temporal markers trigger chronological reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes waiting for time to pass. The recognition that can happen instantaneously is obscured by developmental timeline.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner expects automatic development without effort. The active recognition is replaced by passive waiting.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TEMPORALIZATION ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "four empowerments" (dbang bzhi) are interpreted as actual initiations to receive from a teacher rather than natural results of recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Empowerment" suggests ritual transmission. Teacher-student framework supports this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural unfolding of recognition is replaced by ritual dependency. The self-existing nature of realization is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks external empowerments rather than recognizing intrinsic awareness. Dzogchen autonomy becomes institutional dependency.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [RITUALIZATION ERROR] and [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "buddhahood through transformation of basis" is understood as actual transformation process or achievement of altered state rather than recognition of what already is.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Transformation" suggests change. "Buddhahood" suggests goal to achieve.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition of innate nature is replaced by transformative process. The immanence of buddhahood is lost in teleological striving.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner strives for transformation rather than recognition. The "already accomplished" nature is obscured by becoming.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TRANSFORMATION ERROR] and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].
