[SPATIAL ERROR] [DIRECTIONAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader literalizes the directional prophecy ("from north direction move") as establishing geographical predictions about where teachings will spread, treating sacred geography as physical cartography.

WHY IT ARISES:
The directional terminology (north, south, east, west) combined with movement verbs naturally parse as geographical description. The sacred dimension of directions is not cognitively available to readers trained in secular geography.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teachings become associated with specific regions in a way that either validates certain cultures or creates anxiety about being in the "right" location. The universality of dharma is obscured.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missionary or expansionist mentalities develop. The teaching becomes territorialized.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Subsequent teachings about the mind's nature are interpreted through geographical or cultural lenses.

[TEMPORAL ERROR] [CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the aeon calculations (aeon numberless, seven times arising) as establishing a literal timeline for the teaching's duration, calculating "when" the teaching will end.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numerical specificity ("seven," "numberless") triggers chronological thinking. Temporal markers are habitually processed as literal predictions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Urgency or complacency arises based on calculations about time remaining. Practice becomes time-driven rather than recognition-driven.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eschatological anxiety or smugness develops. The timeless dimension is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All teachings about the present moment are subordinated to temporal concerns.
