[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The symbolic correspondences—"Field Broad is samsara," "mud is body, speech, and mind"—are treated as poetic metaphors without technical meaning.

WHY IT ARISES:
Correspondence lists suggest allegorical reading. The distinction between technical terminology and poetic language is not recognized.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The precise Dzogchen anatomy being taught is dismissed as poetic fancy. Technical terms become literary devices.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader remains ignorant of how the narrative encodes instructions for recognizing the bar do. The practical guidance is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [POETICIZATION ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The parents sending children to two different realms is interpreted as parental abandonment or bad parenting rather than teaching on the two aspects of appearance.

WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on dbyings snang (expanse appearance) and thig le (sphere) as two modes of rig pa's display is entirely missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader judges the narrative morally rather than recognizing its technical content. The pointing to the two lamps of bar do instruction is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MORALISTIC ERROR] and [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR].

[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Not listening to instructions" is understood as moral failure of disobedience rather than indicating how dull faculties fixate on appearance.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Not listening" suggests moral fault. Ethical frameworks interpret narrative events as moral lessons.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The technical teaching about dbang po rtul ba (dull faculties) and fixation on appearance is replaced by moral exhortation to obey.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops guilt-based practice rather than understanding cognitive processes. The pointing to habitual fixation patterns is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MORALISTIC ERROR] and [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The three messengers (mi gsum) and their journey is understood as literal travel narrative rather than pointing to the three baskets (sde snod gsum) of teachings.

WHY IT ARISES:
Travel narrative triggers geographical reading. The concrete imagery of journey obscures symbolic reference.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The three baskets as aspects of the path become a travel story. The integration of scripture, reasoning, and instruction is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner misses how the three baskets serve as supports for recognition. The unity of the three vehicles is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR] and [FRAGMENTATION ERROR].
