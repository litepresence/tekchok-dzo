[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The explanation that the same wind becomes wisdom or karma wind depending on whether channels are "contracted" or not describes an actual mechanical process where channel constriction literally transforms wind's nature.

WHY IT ARISES:
The causal language ("becomes," "transforms") suggests physical mechanism. Mechanical frameworks interpret these as literal transformative processes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Channel mechanics replace view. The practitioner works to keep channels unconstricted, believing this mechanically produces wisdom wind.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Physical manipulation replaces recognition. The practitioner focuses on channel openness rather than recognizing that wind's nature is mind.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of wisdom wind's four functions (basis wisdom, characteristic wisdom, etc.) constitutes an ontology of wisdom as a thing with specific powers and capabilities.

WHY IT ARISES:
The functional description suggests entity with powers. Reifying habits interpret functions as properties of an existing thing.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is reified into a powerful force. The practitioner seeks to access or activate wisdom wind as if it were a special energy.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Power-seeking replaces recognition. The practitioner pursues wisdom wind for its capabilities rather than recognizing empty nature.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of the twelve functions of karma wind producing body growth, samsara, etc., describes fixed karmic destiny mechanically produced by wind functions.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumeration of functions suggests deterministic mechanics. Fatalistic frameworks interpret these as unchangeable causal chains.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Karma becomes mechanical determinism. The practitioner believes wind functions fix destiny rather than seeing karma as empty.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fatalistic resignation develops. The practitioner accepts conditions as mechanically produced rather than recognizing their malleable nature.
