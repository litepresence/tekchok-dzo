[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The "four yogas of view, meditation, conduct, fruition" (lta sgom spyod 'bras) are interpreted as four actual practices to be trained sequentially, rather than four aspects of continuous recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerative language triggers curriculum-thinking. "Yoga" suggests practice-regimen. The practitioner assumes numbered descriptions indicate stages.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The spontaneous-already nature of four-yoga is lost. The practitioner believes they must build four-yoga through effort. Recognition is replaced by stage-accumulation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"View-yoga" becomes preliminary. "Fruition-yoga" becomes advanced. The practitioner evaluates progress by "which yoga they're in."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga. Yoga-stages are reified. By PAGE 471-472's deviations, the practitioner is confused because stage-progression hasn't produced liberation.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The description of four-yoga as "taken by view, meditation, conduct, fruition" is interpreted as establishing four-yoga mastery as advanced attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive language suggests mastery-content. "Four" implies completeness. The practitioner wants complete attainment.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-without-four-yoga-training nature is lost. Four-yoga becomes elite curriculum. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is insufficient.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Four-yoga practitioner" becomes advanced identity. Those not practicing all four are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that four-yoga describes already-present nature is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Four-yoga mastery becomes capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having four-yoga."

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The "awareness and display as two" (rig pa dang snang ba gnyis) is interpreted as ontological claim about actually-distinct entities that must be "unified."

WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic language triggers separation-assumption. "Two" implies duality. The practitioner assumes description indicates problem.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual identity of awareness-display is obscured by perceived need for "unification." The practitioner seeks to "join" what was never separate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Unification practices" proliferate. Teachers promising "merging techniques" gain followings. The authentic recognition that awareness-display have always been non-dual is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] becomes entrenched by PAGE 471-472's deviations. Having created artificial duality-problem, the practitioner fears deviation as "failure to unify." By PAGE 479, they are exhausted by unification-efforts.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The four-yoga completion is seen as "finishing the lamp section" and "moving to yoga application." The transition triggers "next section" anticipation.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sectional structure suggests progression. Technical completion creates momentum. The practitioner wants to "advance."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration of four-yoga with lamp-recognition is missed. The practitioner has "completed" lamps without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward fragmented engagement. Each section becomes separate "achievement." The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "final section."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga lacks foundation. The deviations (PAGE 471-472) are read without yoga-context. By PAGE 479, the volume is "completed" in sections but not integrated.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The " Dzogchen Great Secret" (rdzogs chen gsang sngags che) and "Natural Great Perfection" are interpreted as brand-names of superior tradition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Proper names trigger identity-association. "Great" suggests superiority. The practitioner wants superior brand.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The essencelessness-of-all-traditions teaching is lost. Dzogchen becomes identity-brand. Recognition is replaced by brand-loyalty.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Dzogchen practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Other traditions are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that all paths lead to same nature is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 476's deity yoga comparison. Brand-comparison replaces recognition-comparison. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "dzogchen-superiority" identity.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The four-yoga substantialism on this page carries to PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga, where yoga-continuity is expected to "produce" recognition. The deviations (PAGE 471-472) become "yoga-failures," and the colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "yoga-completion."
