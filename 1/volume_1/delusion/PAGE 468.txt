[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of "how awareness appears at the gates" (sgo la snang tshul) is interpreted as literal description of physiological optics—believing that looking with specific eye-positions actually generates the described appearances.

WHY IT ARISES:
Physiological explanations seem more concrete. "Gate" (sgo) triggers aperture-thinking. Western practitioners assume descriptions of appearance-mechanism are anatomical claims.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-dependent nature of all appearance is lost. The practitioner believes specific gazing-directions produce specific experiences. The pointing function of gate-description collapses into ocular mechanics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Appearing at the gates" becomes technique to execute. "Dissolving into space" becomes physiological process. The practitioner literalizes all appearance-descriptions, treating recognition as perceptual achievement.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding gate-descriptions as recognition-contexts rather than optical mechanics, the practitioner develops [PRACTICE ERROR]—obsessive eye-manipulation. They may damage vision through forced gazing-strategies, missing that recognition is not gaze-dependent. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—all appearance-language is read as phenomenological claim rather than pedagogical pointer.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The distinction between "awareness" (rig pa) and "display" (snang ba) as two aspects is interpreted as ontological claim about two actually distinct entities or substances.

WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic frameworks parse everything into separate categories. "Two" triggers multiplicity-assumption. Western practitioners assume grammatical duality indicates ontological duality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual identity of awareness and display is missed. The practitioner treats them as separate things to unite or balance. The pointing function of dual-description collapses into relational ontology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Awareness" becomes subject. "Display" becomes object. The practitioner literalizes all dualistic language, creating internal map of metaphysical geography.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding dual-descriptions as pedagogical distinctions within non-duality, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in awareness-display duality. They may seek to "merge" what was never separate, creating artificial problem. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all dual terminology is read as ontological claim. Recognition is externalized into achievement of unity.
