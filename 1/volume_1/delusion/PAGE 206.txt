[PRACTICE ERROR] [MUDRA MECHANISM]

MISREADING:
The four mudras (karma mudra, samaya mudra, dharma mudra, mahamudra) are interpreted as physical hand gestures and sexual positions that mechanically produce realization when performed correctly.

WHY IT ARISES:
Performative frameworks project onto mudra practice. The detailed physical instructions suggest choreographed causation. Desire for concrete techniques supports literal interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that mudras are expressions of realized view, not causes of realization, is entirely lost. Practice becomes physical performance rather than recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners obsess over precise positioning while neglecting view. Sexual technique replaces wisdom inquiry. The symbolic dimensions are reduced to mechanics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on thigle will be approached as hydraulic management.

[VIEW ERROR] [LOCATION ESSENTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The specific locations (tip to root, root to navel, etc.) are understood as fixed anatomical points that must be precisely mapped and manipulated, like acupuncture points with guaranteed effects.

WHY IT ARISES:
Cartographic thinking projects spatial certainty onto subtle body. The precise anatomical language suggests objective geography. Scientific materialism supports literalization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that locations are conceptual designations for awareness-movement, not fixed points, is entirely obscured. The energetic becomes the cartographic.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners carry anatomical maps while missing the awareness that moves. Disappointment when locations don't match descriptions leads to doubt. The fluid becomes fixed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on channel opening become navigational challenges.

[EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [RETENTION FETISHISM]

MISREADING:
The signs of successful thigle retention (freedom from illness, youthful appearance, long life) are treated as guaranteed physiological benefits that automatically result from physical practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Health-and-longevity frameworks project onto tantric practice. The benefit-list suggests causative product. Desire for tangible rewards supports literal interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that signs indicate recognition, not health benefits, is entirely lost. Practice becomes wellness regimen rather than wisdom cultivation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners measure success by physical appearance while neglecting realization. Disappointment when signs don't manifest leads to abandonment. The spiritual becomes the cosmetic.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on signs will be approached as achievement certificates.

[GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [PERFECTION DEFERRAL]

MISREADING:
The threefold process (outer body, inner mind, both simultaneously) is interpreted as progressive stages requiring mastery of each before advancing to the next, with simultaneous perfection as distant goal.

WHY IT ARISES:
Skill-acquisition models impose sequential learning frameworks. The tripartite structure suggests curriculum progression. Fear of "skipping ahead" drives deferral.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that all three are always already perfect is entirely obscured. Practitioners remain stuck in outer practices, deferring inner recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Elitist hierarchies form around which "level" one practices. The unity of outer-inner is never recognized. Fragmentation replaces simultaneity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. Trekcho will be misread as advanced technique rather than present recognition.

[PROGRESS TRACKING] [SIDDLHI SHOPPING]

MISREADING:
The siddhis listed (walking without touching ground, seeing atoms, flying in space) are treated as spiritual trophies to be collected, like video game achievements unlocking at practice milestones.

WHY IT ARISES:
Gamification psychology projects onto spiritual practice. The enumerative lists suggest collectible items. Desire for extraordinary powers supports acquisition-mindset.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that siddhis are byproducts of recognition, not goals to pursue, is entirely lost. Practice becomes power-accumulation rather than wisdom-cultivation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners compare "attainments" competitively. Faking siddhis to maintain status becomes common. The supreme siddhi (recognition) is sacrificed for lesser displays.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on accomplishment will be approached as power-acquisition manual.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page discusses mahamudra and thigle retention practices. Preceding pages established subtle body errors that intensify here—practitioners will approach mahamudra as physical technique. Following pages (207+) discuss signs and benefits that will be misunderstood through lens of worldly attainment.
