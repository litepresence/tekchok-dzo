[TEMPORAL ERROR] [AUSPICIOUSNESS ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes astrological and calendrical instructions as establishing that timing determines success, developing superstition about auspicious moments.

WHY IT ARISES:
The temporal specifications trigger magical thinking about auspiciousness. Cultural astrology supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice is deferred to more "auspicious" times. The present moment is devalued.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Anxiety about timing replaces confidence in recognition. Practice becomes superstitious.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that every moment is perfect for recognition is entirely lost.
