[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The twenty-four aspects of karma wind's functions (counting by portions) describes a complex deterministic system where all samsaric phenomena are mechanically produced by wind functions.

WHY IT ARISES:
The elaborate enumeration suggests comprehensive mechanics. Systematic frameworks interpret this as complete causal explanation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Comprehensive determinism is accepted. The practitioner believes all experience is mechanically produced by wind functions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Agency is denied. The practitioner sees self as puppet of wind functions rather than recognizing emptiness of both.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The concluding calculation formulas (deficiency of 50 = 2 years, etc.) present a mathematical science of lifespan that accurately predicts death based on physiological measurements.

WHY IT ARISES:
The mathematical precision suggests scientific prediction. Numerological frameworks encourage belief in calculated destiny.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Death becomes mathematical certainty. The practitioner believes lifespan is determined by calculable physiological factors.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Anxiety or resignation about death develops. The practitioner calculates remaining time rather than recognizing deathlessness of nature.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The entire wind presentation is a scientific system describing the actual mechanics of how body, energy, and mind function that should be studied as accurate physiology.

WHY IT ARISES:
The comprehensive systematic presentation resembles scientific theory. Academic training encourages acceptance as accurate description of reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is reduced to Tibetan physiology. The profound teaching becomes merely alternative medical theory.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Scientific materialism replaces wisdom recognition. The practitioner studies wind theory as biology rather than pointing-out instruction.
