[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text emphasizes distinguishing these two aspects is extremely important, explaining how impure samsara's door hasn't opened if self-appearance is recognized. A reader might think: "This is describing the crucial moment - if I recognize my own appearance in the bardo, I won't enter samsara. Recognition is the key."

WHY IT ARISES:
We seek the key technique, the crucial moment, the essential point. The emphasis on recognition as preventing samsara's door from opening suggests a practice strategy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats recognition as a technique to prevent rebirth. This becomes a goal-oriented practice - recognize in bardo to avoid samsara.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Practicing recognition as future technique
2. Anxiety about missing recognition in bardo
3. Goal-oriented spiritual practice
4. Missing that recognition is present, not future

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (future-oriented technique) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking recognition experience) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (bardo anxiety). The practitioner practices for death.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that if deluded appearance hasn't emptied, one cannot be liberated, and that this crucial point is extremely profound. A reader might think: "So I must empty deluded appearances to be liberated. The practice is to make delusions empty."

WHY IT ARISES:
The idea that delusions must be "emptied" suggests a process of elimination or transformation. We imagine a practice of emptying, clearing, purifying deluded appearance.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts "emptying delusion" as practice goal. This becomes a project of clearing away delusion to reveal purity - a purification practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking to empty or clear delusion
2. Viewing delusion as obstacle to be removed
3. Progressive emptying practice
4. Missing that emptiness is nature, not achievement

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to PRACTICE ERROR (emptying project) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking empty states) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (delusion as real thing to empty). The practitioner empties.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text introduces the topic of establishing qualities and faults in detail, presenting three aspects: eight qualities generally shown, dividing into faults and qualities by conditions, and establishing the reasoning of arising and ceasing. A reader might think: "This is the systematic philosophical analysis of qualities and faults. This is rigorous Buddhist philosophy."

WHY IT ARISES:
Systematic structure suggests academic rigor. Threefold divisions promise comprehensive coverage. We assume this is serious philosophical analysis worth mastering.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the text as systematic philosophy to be studied. The three aspects become topics for scholarly analysis and debate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating text as philosophical curriculum
2. Studying qualities/faults academically
3. Debating systematic categories
4. Missing that analysis serves recognition

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (academic analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (analysis as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching systematic philosophy). The tradition becomes academic.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that if the base were not spontaneously accomplished, there would be no meaning to base-display's arising, and no meaning to samsara/nirvana's arising. A reader might think: "This proves that the base must be spontaneously accomplished. The argument establishes this as the correct view."

WHY IT ARISES:
Logical arguments appeal to our rational mind. When we see reasoning that "proves" something, we accept the conclusion as established truth. This feels like solid ground.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the argument as proof establishing the view. Spontaneous accomplishment becomes an established philosophical position supported by logic.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating logic as establishing truth
2. Defending spontaneous accomplishment philosophically
3. Using arguments to prove the view
4. Missing that arguments are medicine, not food

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (philosophical argumentation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (logic as path to truth) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (proved metaphysics). The practitioner argues.
