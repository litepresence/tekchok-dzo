[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, OBSCURATION-WARFARE-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Mind six gather-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of path obscure and that also mind-by-means-of wisdom not-see and clear not-give wisdom to thought not-possess mind from move-maker exist-by-means-of cause Buddha-by-means-of path obscure is." A reader might think: "Mind actively obscures wisdom and Buddha-path. I must stop mind's movement to clear the path. This requires aggressive intervention."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Obscure" suggests active enemy. Western spiritual warfare metaphors frame mind as opponent. The causal language implies intervention is possible.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner wages war on mind, attempting to forcefully stop its movement to reveal wisdom. They reify obscuration as enemy to defeat.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Mind is demonized as opponent
2. Aggressive suppression replaces gentle recognition
3. Natural clarity is obscured by warfare
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual violence

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates OBSCURATION-WARFARE-ERROR (mind as enemy) → PRACTICE ERROR (aggressive suppression) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mind vs wisdom dualism). The practitioner battles their own mind.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MYTHIC-HISTORY-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "first spontaneous from self arise and self face not-know-by-means-of awareness from end delusion cease time later not-pure lineage cut stain what be that samsara first-last is Buddha last not-possess." A reader might think: "This is the actual historical sequence—first spontaneous presence, then not-knowing, then delusion, then potential lineage-cutting. I need to understand this timeline."

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential descriptions trigger historical thinking. Western narrative consciousness seeks timelines. The "first" and "later" suggest temporal sequence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner interprets the description as historical timeline, trying to locate themselves in the sequence of fall and potential redemption.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Atemporal truth is temporalized
2. Present recognition is abandoned for historical understanding
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen becomes sacred history

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MYTHIC-HISTORY-ERROR (temporal literalism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (history for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (fall-redemption timeline). The practitioner studies salvation history.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, ARMY-OBSTACLE-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists "Friend four do then wild-man five arise then back-support one arise then thief one arise that all accumulate-by-means-of one arise that etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise." A reader might think: "These are actual negative forces—wild men, thieves, armies—that arise to obstruct practice. I need protection rituals and methods to overcome them."

WHY IT ARISES:
Dramatic obstacle imagery suggests real dangers. Western spiritual warfare traditions battle negative forces. The accumulation into armies implies serious threat.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the "army" as actual obstructing forces, seeking protective practices and exorcisms.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Forces are treated as real enemies
2. Protection becomes fixation
3. The empty nature is missed
4. Dzogchen becomes spiritual combat

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ARMY-OBSTACLE-ERROR (demonological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (protective rituals) → REIFICATION ERROR (forces as real entities). The practitioner raises spiritual armies.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SECTIONAL-SEQUENCE-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show." A reader might think: "The teaching is organized in nine sequential sections showing divergence and liberation. I must progress through these sections in order."

WHY IT ARISES:
Numerical organization suggests curriculum. Western educational systems follow sequences. "Section nine" implies structured progression.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the nine sections as progressive curriculum, delaying understanding until completing the sequence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Sequential reading replaces instant recognition
2. Later sections are prematurely postponed
3. Present understanding is deferred
4. Dzogchen becomes academic course

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SECTIONAL-SEQUENCE-ERROR (curriculum fixation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (sequence for understanding) → PRACTICE ERROR (progressive study). The practitioner takes the course instead of recognizing.
