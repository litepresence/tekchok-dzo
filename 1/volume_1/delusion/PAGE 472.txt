[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of "expanse-awareness at the ground" (gzhi'i dbyings rig), "path" (lam), and "fruition" ('bras bu) is interpreted as literal temporal progression through three actually distinct stages or locations.

WHY IT ARISES:
Teleological thinking assumes developmental progress. "Path" triggers journey-metaphor. Western practitioners assume threefold descriptions present sequential curriculum.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-temporal nature of the threefold classification is lost. The practitioner believes they must traverse from ground to fruition. The pointing function of threefold description collapses into developmental model.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Ground" becomes starting-point left behind. "Path" becomes intermediate territory to cross. "Fruition" becomes destination to reach. The practitioner literalizes all stage-language, creating spiritual timeline.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding threefold classification as simultaneous aspects rather than sequential stages, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in dzogchen progress-model. They may feel discouraged at being "still at ground" or prematurely claim "fruition" achievement. The [REIFICATION ERROR] spreads—all temporal language is literalized. Recognition is replaced by progress-tracking.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "extremely important key point of expanse-awareness distinction" (dbyings rig gi gnad 'di phyed pa shin tu gces so) is interpreted as claiming that there is actually a distinction between expanse and awareness that must be intellectually understood or cognitively maintained.

WHY IT ARISES:
Analytical mindset seeks conceptual clarifications. "Key point" triggers information-acquisition. Western practitioners assume technical distinctions present ontological information.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual identity of expanse and awareness is obscured by conceptual distinction. The practitioner believes they must "get" the difference between dbyings and rig pa. The pointing function of distinction-description collapses into conceptual knowledge.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Expanse" becomes one concept. "Awareness" becomes another concept. The practitioner accumulates dzogchen vocabulary without recognition, believing terminology equals understanding.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding distinction-descriptions as pedagogical tools for recognition rather than ontological claims, the practitioner develops [EPISTEMIC ERROR]—belief in conceptual dzogchen. They may debate fine distinctions while missing what is pointed to. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—all technical terminology is reified. Recognition is replaced by philosophical sophistication.
