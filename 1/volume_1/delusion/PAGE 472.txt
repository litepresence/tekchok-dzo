[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The distinction between ground-expanse-awareness (gzhi'i dbyings rig), path-expanse-awareness (lam gyi dbyings rig), and fruition-expanse-awareness ('bras bu'i dbyings rig) is interpreted as establishing three ontological types of awareness or three classes of practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
Tripartite structure triggers typological thinking. "Ground, path, fruition" suggests developmental stages. The practitioner wants "fruition" awareness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single-nature of all awareness is fragmented into hierarchical types. The practitioner believes fruition-awareness is superior. Elitism emerges around "which awareness one has."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Fruition-awareness practitioner" becomes advanced identity. Ground-awareness practitioners are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that all three are aspects of single awareness is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 474-475's capacity distinctions. Awareness-type becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having fruition-awareness."

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The "expanse-awareness distinction" (dbyings rig gi gnad) is interpreted as crucial doctrinal point requiring intellectual mastery.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical terminology signals importance. "Crucial" suggests necessity. The practitioner assumes doctrinal precision is required.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-nature of distinction is lost. The practitioner studies dbyings-rig difference intellectually. Recognition is replaced by conceptual knowledge.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Doctrinal debates proliferate. Teachers with precise definitions gain authority. The authentic recognition that distinction is pedagogical tool is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "mastered" distinctions without recognition.

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The verses about "when appearances are fragmented... when extremely subtle and moving" are interpreted as phenomenological roadmap with required experiences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Conditional language triggers achievement-assumption. "When" suggests stages. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate requirements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is suffocated by experience-matching. The practitioner checks: "Are my appearances fragmented? Subtle? Moving?" Achievement-anxiety replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Experience-stages become orthodoxy. Teachers who validate specific appearances gain authority. The authentic recognition that all appearances are equal is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 474-475's appearance-categories. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by appearance-tracking.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The practitioner-types section is seen as "near the end" triggering "just finish" mentality. The practitioner wants to "complete" Volume 1.

WHY IT ARISES:
Proximity to end creates momentum. Dense content creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "done."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The humbling function of practitioner-type teaching is missed. The practitioner has "read" types without being humbled. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward dismissive pattern. Type-awareness is not internalized. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "final formality."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 474-475's type-elaboration is not absorbed. Arriving at PAGE 479 without humility, the practitioner misses dedication's grounding.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "five elements dissolving into expanse" (byung ba rnams lnga thim gyur) is interpreted as literal alchemical process.

WHY IT ARISES:
Alchemical language triggers substance-transformation associations. "Dissolving" suggests metamorphosis. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate physical change.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-metaphor nature of elemental language is lost. The practitioner seeks literal elemental-transmutation. Somatic achievement replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Element-practices proliferate. Teachers promising "dissolution experiences" gain authority. The authentic recognition that elements are metaphorical is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Elemental metaphors are literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "dissolved" conceptually.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The type-elitism on this page carries to PAGE 474-475's elaboration. By PAGE 476's deity yoga comparison, type-hierarchy determines comparison. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with type-identity.
