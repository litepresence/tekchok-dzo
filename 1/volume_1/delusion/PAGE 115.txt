[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Indicating meaning awareness realizing method's instruction" and "self to/in abiding awareness's wisdom indicating" describe a pedagogical system where instruction leads to realization through a definite method.

WHY IT ARISES:
The instructional language suggests pedagogy. The "realizing method" implies technique.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Realization becomes dependent on method. The practitioner believes correct instruction guarantees realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Method fixation. Instruction dependency. Missing self-liberation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Pedagogy obsession → teacher dependency → disempowerment → exploitation.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Explanation tantras word long difficult" and "instruction tantras word clear easy" establish a hierarchy where Great Perfection's clarity makes it superior to difficult philosophical texts.

WHY IT ARISES:
The contrast (difficult/easy) invites comparison. The classification suggests value-ranking.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Elitism about Great Perfection's accessibility. Dismissal of difficult texts. Pride in understanding.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual superiority. Rejection of gradual study. Shortcut seeking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Clarity elitism → premature advanced practice → misunderstanding → fall.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Effort non-existent primordial liberation" and "effort with sequence" present two paths where one can choose between effortless recognition or sequential practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The binary (effortless/with effort) suggests options. The division implies choice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Path becomes a choice between approaches. The practitioner selects based on preference.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Approach shopping. Effortless preference. Rejection of discipline.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Path consumerism → spiritual materialism → no commitment → no result.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Basis cutting through" and "primordial liberating again basis non-existent" describe specific techniques of trekchö that cut through basis to achieve liberation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "cutting through" suggests action. The repetition implies method.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Trekchö becomes a cutting technique. The practitioner attempts to cut through basis.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Aggressive meditation. Cutting as effort. Violent imagery.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Aggressive practice → psychological disturbance → trauma → medical intervention.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Effort non-existent primordial liberation" establishes primordial liberation as a pre-existing state that requires no effort, which one either recognizes or doesn't.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "primordial" suggests timeless pre-existence. "Effort non-existent" implies automaticity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Primordial liberation is reified as an always-existing state. The practitioner waits for recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Passivity. Waiting for grace. Rejection of all effort.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Passive waiting → no practice → no recognition → disillusionment.

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Path of leaping over" (tögal) is interpreted as a method for those who need effort and sequence, implying it's a secondary or compensatory practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The contrast with effortless primordial liberation suggests hierarchy. The "leaping" implies action.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Tögal is devalued as secondary. The practitioner dismisses it as inferior.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice hierarchy. Elitism about trekchö. Tögal neglect.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Practice dismissal → incomplete training → vision fixation → imbalance.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Faculty instant plural's sequence" suggests there are multiple types of instantaneous faculties that progress through stages.

WHY IT ARISES:
The plural "faculties" suggests variety. The term "sequence" implies stages.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Instantaneous faculties are categorized and sequenced. The practitioner progresses through instant-types.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Category fixation. Instant-elitism. Comparison of faculties.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Faculty comparison → pride or shame → hierarchical thinking → sectarianism.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Primordial liberating again basis non-existent" establishes a liberation that exists prior to basis and continues despite basis being non-existent.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "again" suggests repetition. "Non-existent basis" implies groundless liberation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Liberation is substantialized as existing independently of basis. The practitioner seeks this groundless liberation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Liberation fixation. Ground-seeking. Reification of freedom.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Liberation obsession → dissociation → nihilism → spiritual crisis.
