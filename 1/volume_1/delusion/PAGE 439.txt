[TATHAGATAGARBHA ERROR] [BUDDHA-NATURE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18661-18685 extensively quote tathagatagarbha scriptures stating "all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature" and "all sentient beings are Buddhas." The reader reifies Buddha-nature as an actual entity or essence within beings.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "Buddha-nature" suggests possession of inner essence. Language naturally substantializes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature is reified as hidden treasure or true self. The emptiness of Buddha-nature is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners search for "inner Buddha" or assume they are "already perfect."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TREASURE HUNTING ERROR] and [ETERNALISM ERROR].

[VEILING ERROR] [OBSCURATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18686-18705 describe Buddha-nature as "covered by bodily obscurations" like sun covered by clouds. The reader sees this as real veils needing removal.

WHY IT ARISES:
Covering metaphor suggests layers to peel away.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Co-emergent nature is missed. Sequence appears: purity, then covering, then uncovering.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners try to "remove veils" through practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURIFICATION ERROR] and [LAYERS ERROR].

[SUTRA ERROR] [SCRIPTURAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18661-18685 quote Tathagatagarbha Sutra extensively. The citations are treated as authoritative proofs.

WHY IT ARISES:
Scriptural authority makes claims difficult to question.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Pointing function is lost. Citations become dogma.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Debates about interpretation substitute for practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [FUNDAMENTALISM ERROR] and [BIBLIOGRAPHY ERROR].

---

[UTTARATANTRA ERROR] [TREATISE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18661-18685 quote Maitreya's Uttaratantra. The reader treats this as definitive philosophical position.

WHY IT ARISES:
Uttaratantra is major authoritative treatise.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Treatise is reified as establishing truth.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Philosophical study substitutes for recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCHOLASTICISM ERROR] and [PHILOSOPHICAL FIXATION].

---

[DOHA ERROR] [VERSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18661-18685 quote Saraha's Doha. The poetic language is literalized.

WHY IT ARISES:
Doha verses are beautiful and authoritative.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Poetry is taken as metaphysical claim.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners seek experiences matching verses.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [POETIC LITERALISM] and [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR].
