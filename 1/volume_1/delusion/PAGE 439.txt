[OBJECT ERROR] [EXPERIENCE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18607-18641: Three types of object wisdom are described: "wisdom of appearances," "wisdom of emptiness," and "wisdom of objects." One might understand these as different experiences or states to achieve.

WHY IT ARISES:
The threefold classification (gsum) suggests a complete typology. The object-oriented language (yul gyi ye shes) suggests wisdom is about objects or has objects.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is objectified as having content or being about something. The non-referential nature of recognition is obscured by the very description of its "types."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may cycle through seeking "appearance wisdom," then "emptiness wisdom," then "object wisdom," creating new forms of temporal practice and goal-orientation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [OBJECTIFICATION ERROR] where wisdom becomes content of experience, and [CYCLING ERROR] where practitioners move between states rather than recognizing their nature.

[GRADUATION ERROR] [PROGRESS ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18643-18660: The text describes how experience "increases like the waxing moon" and mentions "signs" and "marks" of progress. One might see this as describing necessary developmental stages.

WHY IT ARISES:
The developmental language (increase, signs, stages) naturally suggests progress. We are habituated to understanding growth as gradual and developmental.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is temporalized as a process with stages. What is actually timeless and immediate appears as something that develops over time with practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may judge their practice by whether they experience "progress" or see "signs," creating new forms of self-evaluation and comparison. The simplicity of recognition is complicated.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [STAGE ERROR] where path is reified as stages, and [SELF-EVALUATION ERROR] where practitioners constantly assess their progress.
