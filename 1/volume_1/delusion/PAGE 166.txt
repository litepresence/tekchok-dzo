[LINEAGE ERROR] [SUCCESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader treats the prophecy about Padmasambhava ("west uddiyana pure land," "fatherless son vajra he") as establishing the historical inevitability of specific individuals, conflating prophecy with biography.

WHY IT ARISES:
The proper names and locations trigger biographical reading. The identification of prophecy with specific historical figures is cognitively satisfying.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic dimension of prophecy is lost. The teaching becomes attached to historical narratives rather than universal principles.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Institutional authority is validated by claims of prophetic fulfillment. Dissent becomes impossible.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All teachings are approached as historical claims requiring verification rather than as present pointers.

[GENEALOGICAL ERROR] [HOLDER OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes absorbed in the list of lineage holders and their succession, treating these as establishing exclusive authentic transmission through specific institutional lines.

WHY IT ARISES:
The sequential listing combined with possessive language ("hold-by-means-of") triggers genealogical thinking. Authority is habitually located in succession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct recognition is subordinated to proper lineage certification. The reader seeks validation from external authorities.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Lineage politics displace practice. Concern with who holds "real" transmission replaces recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle that recognition is available beyond lineage boundaries is entirely lost.

[ETHNIC ERROR] [TIBETAN EXCEPTIONALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the prophecy about Tibet and Vimalamitra's emanation as establishing Tibetan exceptionalism, concluding that Tibet has a unique spiritual destiny superior to other regions.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific naming of Tibet combined with "clear make say" suggests privileged status. National or cultural pride supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The universality of dharma is obscured by ethnic particularism. The teaching becomes a marker of cultural identity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Ethnocentrism is validated by textual authority. Non-Tibetan practitioners are marginalized.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching is reduced to Tibetan culture rather than recognized as transcending all cultural boundaries.
