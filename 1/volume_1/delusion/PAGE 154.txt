[DEVOTIONAL ERROR] [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the mantric invocation "buddhas all-before awaken, vajra vajra-holder king" as establishing Vajradhara as an object of worship superior to all buddhas, creating a hierarchical theism with Vajradhara at the apex.

WHY IT ARISES:
The comparative construction "before" (sngon) and royal titulature (king, holder) naturally parse as establishing hierarchical superiority. Devotional psychology seeks supreme objects of refuge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Vajradhara becomes an external deity to whom prayers are directed, rather than the symbol of one's own innate vajra-nature. The principle of self-liberation is externalized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes supplicatory rather than recognition-based. The guru is worshipped as Vajradhara rather than recognized as the mirror of one's own nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The entire Dzogchen path becomes devotional rather than direct. Progress is measured by intensity of faith rather than clarity of recognition.

[GENEALOGICAL ERROR] [HISTORICIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader treats the lineage description (Vajrapāṇi hearing from Samantabhadra, compiler accepting from former victors, unbroken lineage) as historical claim requiring empirical verification, rather than as establishing a transmission dimension beyond time.

WHY IT ARISES:
Modern historical consciousness treats all genealogical claims as factual assertions about the past. The category of "timeless transmission" is cognitively unavailable without specific training.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The lineage becomes either accepted as literal history (fundamentalism) or rejected as mythology (skepticism). Both miss the pointing function.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The living dimension of transmission is lost. The reader relates to the lineage as past event rather than present potency.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about direct transmission are approached historically rather than existentially.

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [INSTRUMENTALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the purposes of the common prologue (generate faith, tame disciples, establish teaching) as revealing that the text is merely a skillful means with no definitive meaning of its own.

WHY IT ARISES:
The instrumental language ("for the purpose of," "cause shown") triggers readings that treat the text as merely functional rather than also revelatory. Academic suspicion of rhetorical purpose supports this.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The text's self-referential authority is undermined. Readers approach all claims with suspicion about "real" purposes behind stated purposes.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The hermeneutic of trust necessary for direct recognition is replaced by hermeneutics of suspicion. Practice becomes impossible because no instruction can be taken at face value.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Even the uncommon prologue is read instrumentally, as "for the purpose of" establishing definitive meaning, thereby undermining its definitiveness.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [CRITICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the refutation of "this was fabricated" as evidence that the text IS fabricated and is engaging in apologetics, applying the hermeneutic of suspicion to the defensive posture itself.

WHY IT ARISES:
The text's defensive tone triggers automatic critical readings in those trained to see apologetics as evidence of anxiety about authenticity. The more vigorously fabrication is denied, the more fabrication is suspected.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The text is approached as literary fiction or mythological construction rather than as revelation. The category of "meaning arising" is flattened to "meaning constructed."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The transformative potential of the text is neutralized by interpretive distance. The reader maintains ironic detachment throughout.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent truth-claims are bracketed. The reader becomes an observer rather than a participant in the teaching.

[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [DICHOTOMIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the final synthesis (meaning shown by uncommon prologue, words by common, not contradictory, connected) as establishing two distinct dimensions that must be correlated, failing to recognize their non-dual unity.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure presents two items (uncommon and common) and their relationship (not contradictory, connected), which naturally parses as establishing two things related rather than one thing appearing in two modes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The reader oscillates between word-focused and meaning-focused readings, never recognizing that words ARE meaning when correctly understood.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes split between scholarly study (common) and meditation (uncommon), with no recognition of their unity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The integration of view, meditation, and conduct becomes impossible because view has been bifurcated.
