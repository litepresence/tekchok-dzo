[SPONTANEITY ERROR] [NATURALNESS ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18314-18349: Self-perfected wisdom (rang bzhin lhun grub) is described as "spontaneously present from the beginning," "without accepting or rejecting," "naturally perfected." One might interpret this as license for passive inaction.

WHY IT ARISES:
Terms like "spontaneous" (lhun gyis grub), "natural" (rang bzhin), and "without effort" (rtsol sgrub med) suggest that doing nothing is the practice. This appeals to the desire for easy liberation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The distinction between natural spontaneity and habitual patterning is missed. All behavior is reified as "natural," eliminating the need for recognition or any practice at all.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners abandon all effort and discipline, mistaking ordinary habit for spontaneous wisdom. Naturalness becomes rationalization for continuing unconscious patterns.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LAZY ERROR] where "natural" justifies inaction, and [SPIRITUAL BYPASSING ERROR] where recognition is claimed without genuine transformation.

[FIVE WISDOM ERROR] [NUMBER ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18350-18404: The five wisdoms (mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, dharmadhatu) are enumerated with detailed characteristics. One might treat these as five distinct psychological or ontological entities.

WHY IT ARISES:
The fivefold structure (rnam pa lnga) suggests a complete system. The detailed descriptions appear to map out the structure of enlightened awareness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of the five wisdoms is missed. What are actually five aspects of single recognition appear as separate attainments or faculties to be developed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate each wisdom separately, or seek experiences corresponding to each. The natural, effortless presence of all five is obscured by cultivation efforts.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become things to develop, and [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific experiences are sought as signs of realization.
