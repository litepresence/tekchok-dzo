[SPONTANEITY ERROR] [NATURALNESS ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18314-18349 extensively describe self-perfected wisdom (rang bzhin lhun grub kyi ye shes) as "spontaneously present from the beginning," "without accepting or rejecting," "naturally perfected," "effortless," "without deliberate action," and "without hope or fear." The reader interprets this as license for complete passive inaction and abandonment of all practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Terms like "spontaneous" (lhun gyis grub), "natural" (rang bzhin), "without effort" (rtsol sgrub med), "without deliberate action" (bya bral), and "without accepting or rejecting" (blang dor med) strongly suggest that doing nothing is the practice. This appeals powerfully to the desire for easy liberation without difficulty, discipline, or structure.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The crucial distinction between natural spontaneity (which recognizes its own nature) and habitual patterning (which continues unconsciously) is completely missed. All behavior is reified as "natural," eliminating the need for recognition or any practice whatsoever.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners abandon all effort, discipline, and structure, mistaking ordinary habits, neuroses, and confusion for spontaneous wisdom. "Just be natural" becomes justification for continuing unconscious patterns. Naturalness rationalizes lack of transformation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LAZY ERROR] where "natural" justifies inaction, [SPIRITUAL BYPASSING ERROR] where recognition is claimed without transformation, [HABIT ERROR] where conditioning is indulged, [RATIONALIZATION ERROR] where confusion is justified, and [DISCIPLINE DISMISSAL] where structure is rejected.

[FIVE WISDOM ERROR] [NUMBER ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18350-18404 enumerate the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga)—mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, and dharmadhatu wisdoms—with detailed characteristics for each. The reader treats these as five distinct psychological faculties or ontological realities to be individually cultivated or experienced.

WHY IT ARISES:
The fivefold structure (rnam pa lnga) suggests a complete, systematic description of enlightened awareness. The detailed characteristics appear to map out distinct aspects. Buddhist teachings on five wisdoms train us to accept this enumeration.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of the five wisdoms is completely missed. What are actually five aspects of single recognition appear as separate attainments. The understanding that all five are simply rigpa recognized from different angles is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate each wisdom separately—developing mirror-like clarity, then equality, etc. They may seek experiences corresponding to each. The natural presence of all five is obscured by cultivation efforts.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become things to develop, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific experiences are sought, [SEQUENTIAL ERROR] where wisdoms are pursued one by one, and [COLLECTION ERROR] where all five must be gathered.

[POETIC ERROR] [METAPHOR ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18405-18427 present extensive verse descriptions using poetic imagery: "like the sun's orb" (nyi ma'i dkyil 'drar), "like space" (nam mkha' ltar), "like a wish-fulfilling jewel" (yid bzhin nor bu ltar), "like the moon's reflection in water" (chu zla ltar). The reader literalizes these into required experiences or metaphysical claims about wisdom's nature.

WHY IT ARISES:
The poetic language is beautiful, evocative, and memorable. Our minds naturally grasp at vivid imagery. The metaphors seem to describe what wisdom is "like," suggesting experiential qualities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pointing function of poetry is completely missed. What should evoke recognition becomes object of aesthetic appreciation or metaphysical speculation. Metaphor is mistaken for meaning.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "sun-like" clarity, "space-like" openness as experiences. They may judge meditation by correspondence to images. The natural recognition is obscured by pursuit of poetic qualities.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [AESTHETIC ERROR] where beautiful descriptions become goals, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific qualities are sought, [COMPARISON ERROR] where practice is measured, and [IMAGERY DEPENDENCE] where recognition requires poetic language.

[KNOWABLE ERROR] [OBJECT ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18425-18464 distinguish wisdom "encompassed by knower" (shes pas bsdus pa) and wisdom "encompassed by knowables" (shes byas bsdus pa). The reader understands these as two different types of knowledge or cognitive modes requiring separate understanding.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure suggests classification into types. The distinction between knower and known appears to create two categories of wisdom.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of knowing and knowable in wisdom is completely missed. What are two ways of describing wisdom's all-pervasiveness appear as separate categories.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate "knower wisdom" or "knowable wisdom" separately. The natural inseparability of subject and object is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBJECT-OBJECT ERROR] where knower and known remain dualistic, [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become objects of practice, and [SEPARATION ERROR] where unity is divided.

---

[VEILING ERROR] [OBSCURATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18686-18705 describe how Buddha-nature isn't seen because it is "covered by bodily obscurations" (sgrib g.yogs) and compare it to the sun covered by clouds. The reader understands this as describing real veils that must be removed through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The metaphor of covering/obscuring naturally suggests layers to be peeled away. The sun/cloud comparison reinforces sense of something hidden behind something else.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The co-emergent nature of ground and ignorance is completely missed. What is actually co-emergent appears sequential: first Buddha-nature, then covering, then uncovering.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to "remove veils" through various practices, creating new forms of doing. The effortless nature of recognition is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURIFICATION ERROR] where practice becomes cleansing, [LAYERS ERROR] where reality appears stratified, [REMOVAL ERROR] where obscurations are eliminated, and [EFFORT ERROR] where doing increases.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 435 continues the five wisdom elaboration with detailed poetic imagery. The spontaneity language invites laziness errors. The veiling language sets up purification errors. Page 436 will present twenty-five wisdom enumeration and expanse metaphors. Page 437 will continue with light imagery and specific practices. The tathagatagarbha theme continues through these pages. The extensive imagery throughout requires recognition as pointers, not prescriptions.
