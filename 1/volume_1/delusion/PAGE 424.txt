[METAPHORICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17803-17813: The text uses numerous metaphors—water/pig, tiger/coward-brave, bird/light, wind/moving, etc.—to describe types of mind. Readers may literalize these as definitive descriptions of psychological types rather than skillful pedagogical devices.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic enumeration (11 types of mind) resembles psychological typologies. Modern readers, familiar with personality assessments and diagnostic categories, naturally treat these as ontological classifications.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The fluid, provisional nature of these classifications is missed. What is meant to illustrate how mind operates under various conditions becomes reified as fixed categories of personality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may identify with or reject certain "types," creating new forms of self-grasping. "I'm a pig-like mind" or "I have bird-like lightness" becomes subtle ego-reinforcement.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [IDENTITY ERROR] where spiritual typology replaces personality, and [SEPARATION ERROR] where recognizing a "type" becomes another object of knowledge rather than seeing through all fixation.

[METHODOLOGICAL ERROR] [ENUMERATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17814-17852: The elaborate enumeration of afflictions (6 root, 16 proximate, 25 subtle, 51, 84,000) might be understood as comprehensive taxonomy rather than pedagogical expedient.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic presentation resembles academic classification systems. The very comprehensiveness suggests completeness, inviting cataloging rather than recognition of their empty nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Afflictions are treated as real entities to be eliminated through systematic counter-measures, rather than understanding that enumeration itself is provisional and the root is simply non-recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners become obsessed with identifying and cataloging their afflictions, creating a new form of self-analysis that reinforces the sense of a fixed self having problems.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [THERAPEUTIC ERROR] where Dharma becomes self-improvement project, and [EXHAUSTION ERROR] where the sheer number of afflictions to address becomes overwhelming.
