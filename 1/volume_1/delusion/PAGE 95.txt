[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR] [NIHILISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Effortless self-liberation" ('bad med rang grol) is interpreted as requiring no practice whatsoever—simply recognizing that liberation is already present means one can abandon all method and rest in ordinariness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lazy spirituality seeks justification for inaction. "Effortless" triggers wish-fulfillment. Western practitioners conflate "self-liberated" with "automatically liberated without recognition."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The path collapses into spiritual sloth. The practitioner claims Dzogchen view while living ordinary confused life. "Resting in nature" becomes excuse for not engaging practice. The distinction between ordinary mind (tha mal gyi shes pa) and conceptual mind is never learned.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Self-arisen primordial wisdom" (rang byung gi ye shes) is expected to dawn without conditions. The practitioner abandons guru yoga, ngondro, and yidam practice while lacking recognition. Without blessing and merit, even correct view words become empty philosophy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
When recognition does not spontaneously arise, the practitioner develops doubt and cynicism. They may reject Atiyoga as ineffective, or claim " Dzogchen is too advanced for me" while actually having never properly entered it. The [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] develops—seeking ever-simpler teachings, believing complexity is obstacle, not recognizing that simplicity requires preparation.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"All appearances as play" (sna tshogs su snang ba thams cad rol pa) is interpreted as cosmic theatricality—the universe as divine drama in which one participates as enlightened actor, enjoying the display without attachment.

WHY IT ARISES:
New age spirituality celebrates "play" and "drama" as spiritual virtues. The word "play" (rol pa) triggers performative spirituality. Western practitioners seek to "enjoy the ride" without transcending the rider.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The self-liberated nature of appearance is missed. "Play" becomes aestheticized spirituality—seeking peak experiences, beauty, and intensity while ordinary confusion continues. The practitioner develops spiritual hedonism masquerading as non-attachment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Without acceptance or rejection" (spang du med pa) becomes inability to make ethical distinctions. The practitioner claims "pure perception" while engaging in harmful behavior. "Directionless" (phyogs med) becomes floundering without guidance rather than freedom from bias.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without actual recognition, "spontaneously complete expanse and wisdom" (lhun grub rdzogs tshul gyi dbyings dang ye shes) becomes grandiose self-image. The practitioner believes they have "arrived" while actually at beginning. This [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—reifying a conceptual understanding as realization—blocks authentic practice for lifetimes. When difficulties arise, cognitive dissonance produces either despair or deeper delusion.
