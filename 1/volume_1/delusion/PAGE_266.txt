[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, Nihilistic ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text negates everything: no rigpa, no ignorance, no Buddha, no sentient beings, no samsara, no nirvana, no paths, no results. A reader might think: "This is absolute negation. Nothing exists at all. All concepts are empty, all distinctions are false."

WHY IT ARISES:
Radical negation appeals to the desire for absolute freedom from limitation. If nothing exists, there are no constraints, no responsibilities, no problems. This is spiritual escapism dressed as wisdom.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts nihilism as liberation. "Nothing exists" becomes a justification for not engaging, not practicing, not caring. All distinctions collapse into a vacuous "everything is empty."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Nihilistic interpretation of emptiness
2. Rejection of all distinctions and practices
3. Justification of irresponsible behavior
4. Missing that negation is medicine, not food

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to NIHILISTIC ERROR → PRACTICE ERROR (abandoning practice) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (avoiding engagement). The practitioner becomes a nihilist.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text presents the negation in a systematic way - no this, no that, nothing at all. A reader might think: "This is a complete philosophical system of negation. These are the definitive negations that establish the view."

WHY IT ARISES:
We naturally systematize teachings into comprehensive frameworks. The extensive list of negations seems like a complete map of what doesn't exist. We want the whole picture, all the negations.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner memorizes the negations as a doctrinal system. The "list of what doesn't exist" becomes a catechism, a checklist of emptiness. Intellectual mastery substitutes for insight.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing negations as doctrine
2. Using negations to prove one's sophistication
3. Competing in how much one can negate
4. Missing that negation is skillful means, not philosophy

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (negation scholasticism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (intellectual mastery) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching negation lists). The tradition becomes nihilistic scholasticism.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes the "Bkrashis mdzes ldan" tantra describing the great primordial purity where no Buddha arose, no sentient beings, unmoving rigpa's great resonance. A reader might think: "This is describing the primordial state before manifestation - the original ground of being, pure and untouched."

WHY IT ARISES:
The idea of a "primordial state" before anything arose is deeply evocative. We imagine a pre-manifest purity, an original innocence. This appeals to our desire to return to some fundamental, pure condition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the "primordial" as a state before time, a pre-creation ground of being. This becomes a metaphysical origin story - the eternal purity from which everything (mistakenly) emerged.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying "primordial" as a temporal origin
2. Seeking to "return" to primordial purity
3. Creating dualism: primordial (pure) vs manifest (impure)
4. Missing that primordial means not created, not "before"

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (primordial as origin) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (pre-existent purity) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking primordial state). The practitioner seeks the origin.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, Nihilistic ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text says samsara doesn't see this, this doesn't see samsara, this is not samsara, not nirvana, not the base, not appearance, not darkness. A reader might think: "This is totally beyond everything - a complete transcendence of all categories and distinctions."

WHY IT ARISES:
Total transcendence seems like the ultimate achievement. Beyond samsara and nirvana, beyond base and appearance - this suggests something absolutely beyond all limitation. We want that absolute freedom.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a category of "total transcendence" beyond all pairs. This becomes a new ultimate - the absolutely ineffable, the totally beyond. This is extreme spiritual ambition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying "beyond all" as the supreme
2. Seeking absolute transcendence experiences
3. Disdaining all "relative" teachings and practices
4. Missing that "beyond" is still a concept

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (transcendence as category) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking absolute transcendence) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (extreme non-conceptuality). The practitioner chases infinity.
