[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The presentation of wisdom wind's functions (dwelling, characteristic, producing, moving) as four distinct modes implies wisdom has multiple natures or can be divided into separate categories.

WHY IT ARISES:
The fourfold functional description suggests divisible entity. Analytical habits interpret functions as separate aspects of a divisible whole.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is conceived as composite entity. The practitioner tries to understand wisdom by analyzing its four functions separately.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fragmentation obscures unity. The practitioner loses sight of wisdom's non-dual nature while examining its functional aspects.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of wisdom wind ripening nirvana and karma wind ripening samsara describes two separate destinies—wisdom wind leads to liberation, karma wind leads to cycling, as if they were different paths.

WHY IT ARISES:
The ripening language suggests causal pathways to different destinations. Teleological frameworks interpret these as divergent destinies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dualistic paths are projected onto wind. The practitioner believes wisdom and karma winds lead to different ultimate destinations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Path-obsession develops. The practitioner tries to stay on the wisdom wind path, fearing karma wind's destination.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of the four functions of karma wind (male/female determination, going/returning, etc.) as producing samsara implies these are fixed functions that mechanically create cyclic existence.

WHY IT ARISES:
The functional description suggests mechanical causation. Deterministic frameworks interpret these as automatic production.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samsara is seen as mechanically produced. The practitioner believes karma wind automatically creates existence without choice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fatalistic acceptance of samsara develops. The practitioner resigns to cycling as mechanically inevitable.
