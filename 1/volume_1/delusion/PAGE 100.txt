[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Free from the extremes of is and is-not, beyond fabrication and correction" (yod min phyogs gnyis grol ba bcos su med) is interpreted as license for total amorality—no action is better than any other, no distinction can be made between benefit and harm.

WHY IT ARISES:
Extreme interpretation of freedom from extremes. "Beyond fabrication" triggers rejection of all deliberate action. Western practitioners conflate non-duality with non-discrimination, emptiness with equivalence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The distinction between confusion and liberation collapses. The practitioner claims "everything is primordially pure" while engaging in harmful behavior. "Beyond acceptance and rejection" becomes inability to make any ethical choice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Self-liberated from the beginning" (ye nas grol ba) becomes excuse for not practicing. The practitioner claims "already enlightened" status while remaining ordinary sentient being. Virtue and non-virtue are dismissed as dualistic concepts.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without the foundation of virtue that makes view meaningful, the practitioner develops [NIHILISTIC ERROR]—spiritual libertinism. They may cause serious harm to others while claiming Dzogchen view. This produces [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]—other practitioners see this behavior and reject Atiyoga as dangerous or amoral. The authentic teaching becomes contaminated by its misrepresentation.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Without cause and fruition, without self-wish, no place to go" (rgyu 'bras rang dgos med pa 'gro sa med) is interpreted as literal claim that karma does not exist—actions have no consequences and there is no path to traverse.

WHY IT ARISES:
Extreme interpretation of emptiness teachings. "Without cause and fruition" triggers nihilistic reading. Western practitioners conflate recognition of empty nature with denial of dependent origination.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The two truths collapse completely. The practitioner denies karma at conventional level while lacking realization of ultimate. This is most dangerous error—spiritual nihilism combined with ordinary ego.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Not needing familiarization" (gos su med pa) becomes excuse for avoiding all practice. "Not depending on other knowables" (mkhyen gzhan la mi ltos pa) becomes rejection of teachers and lineage. The practitioner develops arrogant autonomy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without proper understanding, "the root of samsara and nirvana is rotten" ('khor 'das kyi rtsa ba rnam par rkang ba) becomes despair or license. The practitioner either abandons Dharma as hopeless or uses "rotten root" to justify any behavior. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] becomes total—unable to distinguish correct from incorrect view, the practitioner wanders in confusion believing they are free. The possibility of genuine recognition recedes for lifetimes.
