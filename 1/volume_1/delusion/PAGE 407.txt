[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]

MISREADING:
Taking "stong gsal" (empty-clear) to mean that clarity is empty in the sense of non-existent or absent, rather than empty of inherent existence while manifestly clear.

WHY IT ARISES:
The compound "stong gsal" is often simplified to "empty yet clear," leading to the interpretation that clarity is somehow negated by emptiness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The luminous nature of mind is dismissed as illusory or unreal. Practice becomes dry intellectualism devoid of vividness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students develop aversion to experience, seeing clarity as the enemy of emptiness. The union of appearance-emptiness is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC view of appearance, then to MEDITATIONISM of blank absorption, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of emptiness vs. clarity.

[REIFICATION, EPISTEMIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "rtsa sgron" (channel lamp) as referring to physical channels in the body that conduct subtle energy, treating it as instruction for subtle body practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Rtsa" (channel/nadi) commonly refers to the subtle body's energy channels. Students familiar with yoga/tantra assume this refers to the same thing.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching is reduced to physical yoga. Students practice breath retention and energy movement, missing the direct recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Physical tension and strain develop. The natural flow of energy is blocked by manipulation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of energy work, then to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of subtle body, and finally to PRACTICE harm through forced techniques.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Taking the enumeration "goms pa'i tshad" (measure of habituation) as quantitative metrics for assessing meditation progress or quality.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Tshad" (measure) suggests quantification. Modern minds seek measurable outcomes and progress indicators.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The immeasurable nature of realization is forced into quantitative categories. Students rate their practice on imaginary scales.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes competitive and goal-oriented. Natural recognition is disrupted by constant self-assessment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with classification, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as self-assessment, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through performance anxiety.

Lines 00046-00058
[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "ye shes sku" (wisdom body) as an actual form or body made of wisdom substance that one develops or attains.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Sku" (body) suggests physical form. "Ye shes" (primordial wisdom) suggests something powerful and precious. Combined, they suggest a divine body.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The formless nature of dharmakaya is replaced by fixation on developing a special body. Students imagine themselves transforming into wisdom-beings.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism intensifies. The emptiness of all form is forgotten in pursuit of the "wisdom body."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of the kayas, then to ETERNALISTIC view of truly existent wisdom body, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of deity yoga instead of recognition.
