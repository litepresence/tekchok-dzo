[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [THREE KAYA SPATIALIZATION]

MISREADING:
The three kayas (bodies) are actual spatial locations or structures within the body that can be mapped.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14200-14205: "lus chags pa longs sku/gnas pa sprul sku/'jig pa chos skur grol bas lus sku gsum gyi dkyil 'khor" (forming body = sambhogakaya, dwelling = nirmanakaya, disintegrating = dharmakaya liberation).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing kayas as spatial territories.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to locate the kayas in specific body parts.
Missing that kayas are modes of display, not locations.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SPATIAL MANDALA OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE] [MANTRA SOUND REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Mantras have inherent power as sounds, and their arrangement (sgra tshigs) is significant as literal phonemes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 14206: "sgra tshigs gsang sngags kyi rang sgra" (sound arrangement is mantra's self-sound).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing mantra as empowered sound rather than wisdom display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Obsession with correct pronunciation.
Missing that all sound is equally mantra in nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PHONOLOGICAL OBSESSION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL TRACE/CHARACTERISTIC POSSESSION]

MISREADING:
Channels possess traceable characteristics (mtshan nyid) that can be definitely known and analyzed.

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 14214: "rtsa rang gi mtshan nyid gtan la phebs" (definitely arrive at channel's own characteristic).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thinking characteristics are inherent properties.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual analysis of channel properties.
Missing that characteristics are imputed, not inherent.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ANALYTICAL OBSTRUCTION ERROR]
