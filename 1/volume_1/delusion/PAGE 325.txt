[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WISDOM PATH SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The wisdom path (ye shes kyi lam) is a channel or conduit through which something travels.

WHY IT ARISES:
Reference to channels as paths (lam) for wisdom (ye shes).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing realization as something that moves through channels.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spatializing the non-spatial nature of awareness.
Confusing wisdom with energy flow.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[KUNDALINI MATERIALISM ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ESSENCE/REFUSE DUALISM]

MISREADING:
Essence (dangs ma) and refuse (snyigs ma) are inherently different substances.

WHY IT ARISES:
Description of pure essence producing dharmakaya while refuse produces samsara.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing the two as ontologically distinct rather than inseparable display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Rejection of "impure" aspects of experience.
Missing that both are equally mind's display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ASCETICISM ERROR]
[PURITY OBSESSION ERROR]

[NUMERICAL LITERALISM] [COMPONENT ENUMERATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Counts like "32 channels" and "80,000 worms" are exact inventory of subtle body anatomy.

WHY IT ARISES:
Multiple specific enumerations throughout the text.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Attempting to catalog and count subtle body components.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that numbers indicate interdependent arising and completeness.
Quantifying what transcends quantification.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]
