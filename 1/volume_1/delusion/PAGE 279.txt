[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that if spontaneous accomplishment did not exist in the primordially pure essence, there would be no cause for the arising of impure appearance. A reader might think: "This proves spontaneous accomplishment must exist. The logic requires it as the cause of appearance."

WHY IT ARISES:
Causal reasoning feels solid. If spontaneous accomplishment is the "cause" of appearance, then it must exist. We accept the logical necessity as ontological proof.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats spontaneous accomplishment as a logically necessary existent. This becomes a metaphysical principle - the cause that must be.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying spontaneous accomplishment as necessary existent
2. Defending its existence philosophically
3. Using causality to prove ontology
4. Missing that causality is imputed

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (necessary existence) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (causal metaphysics) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (logic as ontology). The practitioner proves reality.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes how from the base's spontaneous presence, the play of impure appearance arises like dreams or illusions. A reader might think: "So impure appearance is like dreams - they arise from the base but aren't real. The base is the source of dreams."

WHY IT ARISES:
Dream/illusion metaphors are familiar. We imagine the base as dream-source, impure appearance as dreams. This creates a dualism: real base, unreal appearances.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as the "real source" and appearances as "unreal dreams." This becomes a two-level ontology with a privileged reality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Privileging base over appearances
2. Seeking the "real" base beyond dreams
3. Disdaining appearances as "mere illusions"
4. Missing that both base and dreams are empty

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (base as real source) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking real base) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (dream metaphor dualism). The practitioner seeks beyond dreams.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that the base is not nothing at all, because if it were, there would be no basis for delusion or liberation. A reader might think: "This proves the base is something - not nothing, not emptiness in a nihilistic sense. The base exists as the ground of possibility."

WHY IT ARISES:
Fear of nihilism drives us to find positive content. The argument that base cannot be "nothing" suggests it must be "something." We grasp this as the teaching.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as "something" that is not nothing. This becomes subtle eternalism - the base as existent ground of possibility.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying base as positive existent
2. Rejecting emptiness as "too negative"
3. Seeking the "something" that is the base
4. Missing that not-nothing is not something

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ETERNALISTIC ERROR (base as existent) → REIFICATION ERROR (positive ground) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching base as something). The practitioner affirms existence.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text presents extensive reasoning establishing the author's own view through philosophical argumentation. A reader might think: "This is rigorous philosophical theology establishing the correct view through reason. The arguments prove the position."

WHY IT ARISES:
We value rational argumentation as path to truth. Extensive reasoning seems to establish the view definitively. This is how academic philosophy works.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the arguments as proofs establishing the view. The author's position becomes the established truth supported by philosophical reasoning.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating arguments as establishing truth
2. Defending the established view
3. Using reasoning to prove Dzogchen
4. Missing that arguments are medicine

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (philosophical theology) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (reason as truth) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (argumentative transmission). The tradition becomes philosophical.
