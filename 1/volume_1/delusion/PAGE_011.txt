[THIRTY-TWO MARKS ANATOMICAL LITERALISM] [PHYSIOLOGICAL PERFECTIONISM]

MISREADING:
The thirty-two major marks (*mtshan sum cu rtsa gnyis*) and eighty minor signs (*dpe byad brgyad cu*) interpreted as literal anatomical features—physical characteristics of an ideal body.

WHY IT ARISES:
The text lists specific marks (wheel-feet, long tongue, etc.) and signs. Iconographic conventions depict these literally. Hindu/Buddhist traditions describe divine physiques.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddhahood is reduced to physical perfection. Practitioners seek bodily transformation. Statues are worshipped as anatomical ideals.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation focuses on visualizing perfect bodies. Self-image issues arise from comparison. The formless nature is forgotten.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [BODY PERFECTIONISM] (ideal physique), [ANATOMICAL LITERALISM] (physical marks), [ICON WORSHIP] (statue veneration), [PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION] (changing body), and [FORM OBSESSION] (appearance over essence).

[FACE-HAND ACTIVITIES SPATIALIZATION] [FACIAL CHOREOGRAPHY]

MISREADING:
"Wisdom face-hand complete" (*ye shes kyi zhal phyag rdzogs pa*) interpreted as describing actual facial expressions and hand gestures—physical performance.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Face" (*zhal*) and "hand" (*phyag*) suggest body parts. "Complete" (*rdzogs pa*) suggests perfect form. Performance traditions use facial/hand expression.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic meaning is reduced to physical theater. Practitioners practice facial expressions. Recognition is replaced by acting.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Mudra and expression become ends in themselves. Ritual performance prioritizes form. The natural display is choreographed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Generates [CHOREOGRAPHED EXPRESSION] (practiced faces), [PHYSICAL THEATER] (performance), [GESTURE OBSESSION] (hand positions), [FORMALISM] (correct expression), and [ARTIFICIALITY] (posed vs. natural).

[LIGHT RAY BUNDLE MATERIALISM] [PHOTON ACCUMULATION]

MISREADING:
"Host of light rays emanating" (*'od zer gyi tshogs 'phro ba*) interpreted as describing physical light emission—radiation, photons, luminescence.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Light" (*'od*) and "rays" (*zer*) suggest optics. "Emanating" (*'phro*) suggests projection. Modern physics discusses radiation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphor of wisdom-radiance is literalized into physics. The actual meaning—compassion extending universally—is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners seek luminous experiences. Meditation aims for light visualization. The cognitive dimension is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [OPTICAL LITERALISM] (light as photons), [LUMINOSITY CHASING] (seeking light), [RADIATION PROJECTION] (physical energy), [SPECTRAL OBSESSION] (colors), and [VISUAL REDUCTION] (seeing vs. knowing).

[FRONT-BACK DIRECTIONAL LITERALISM] [SPATIAL ORIENTATION]

MISREADING:
"Abiding without front or back" (*mdun dang rgyab med par bzhugs pa*) interpreted as describing physical orientation—having no front or back side.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Front" (*mdun*) and "back" (*rgyab*) are spatial terms. "Without" (*med*) negates directionality. Sounds like physical description.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphor of omnidirectional awareness is spatialized into anatomy. The actual meaning—non-partiality—is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners visualize beings without fronts. Spatial paradoxes become focus. The non-dual nature is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Generates [SPATIAL PARADOX] (directionless form), [ANATOMICAL ODDITY] (no front/back), [ORIENTATION OBSESSION] (facing all directions), [PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY] (impossible body), and [GEOMETRIC CONFUSION] (spatial paradox).

[INSIDE-OUTSIDE VIEWING DUALISM] [PERSPECTIVAL PARADOX]

MISREADING:
"Looking from inside, outside clear; looking from outside, inside clear" interpreted as describing actual visual capacity—seeing through things, X-ray vision.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Inside" (*nang*), "outside" (*phyi*), "looking" (*bltas*), "clear" (*gsal*) suggest vision. The phrases describe unusual seeing. Paranormal abilities fascinate.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-duality of appearance-emptiness is reduced to supernatural sight. The actual meaning—non-obstruction of awareness—is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners seek clairvoyance. Meditation aims for penetrating vision. The natural clarity is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CLAIRVOYANCE SEEKING] (X-ray vision), [PERSPECTIVAL PROJECTION] (inside/outside), [VISUAL PARANORMAL] (supernatural sight), [SEEING OBSESSION] (wanting to see), and [DUALISTIC VISION] (inner/outer duality).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 11 continues the thirty-six activities enumeration from Page 10, completing the "secret four" and beginning body/speech/mind activities. Lines 326-335 complete the body activities.

Line 336 begins speech activities which continue onto Page 12.

ERROR RISK: The detailed enumeration of marks and activities might be read as "what a Buddha has" rather than "ways to recognize uncompounded nature."

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands these enumerations as descriptive categories pointing to nature, not as checklist of accomplishments.
