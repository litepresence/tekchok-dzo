[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the symbolic narrative literally, understanding "Pig year" and "Created sun" as actual temporal events rather than stages of delusion's arising.

WHY IT ARISES:
The narrative form with specific years and celestial bodies triggers historical/literal reading. The desire for concrete reference points supports this misreading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's symbolic language is reduced to cryptic history. The teaching about how delusion arises from pure ground becomes a story about ancient times.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks literal correspondences rather than recognizing the symbolic structure in their own experience. The immediacy of recognition is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [TEMPORAL ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "five poisons" (dug lnga) are understood as actual substances or forces to be eliminated, rather than spontaneous display of awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Poison" suggests something harmful to remove. Dualistic frameworks require elimination of obstacles for realization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes purification of poisons rather than recognition of their nature. The transformative potential of afflictions is entirely missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Aversion toward negative emotions develops. The teaching that poisons are wisdom when recognized becomes theoretical rather than lived.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] and [MORALISTIC ERROR].

[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader treats the symbolic narrative (Yacha story) as mere allegory or teaching device without actual transformative content.

WHY IT ARISES:
Modern skepticism toward symbolic narratives combines with inability to recognize symbolic language as pointing to direct experience.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The bar do (intermediate state) instructions encoded in the narrative are dismissed as mythology. Direct guidance for recognition is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they understand the "meaning" without undergoing the transformative recognition the narrative is designed to trigger.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [INTELLECTUALIZATION ERROR] and [EPISTEMIC ERROR].

[RECOGNITION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Seeing one's own face" (rang gi rang ngo shes) is interpreted as self-knowledge or self-awareness in the conventional psychological sense.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Self" and "face" suggest introspection. Modern psychological frameworks interpret self-knowledge as self-reflection.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen recognition is reduced to self-awareness practice. The fundamental distinction between mind (sems) and awareness (rig pa) is collapsed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner cultivates self-observation rather than recognition of awareness-nature. Meditative experience becomes recursive self-monitoring.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].
