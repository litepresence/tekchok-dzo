[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The distinction between "meaning's tantra" and "word's tantra" and the further division into "method's tantra" and "self-nature's tantra" presents a fourfold taxonomy that must be mastered for complete understanding.

WHY IT ARISES:
The binary and quaternary divisions invite classification. The technical terminology suggests scholarly expertise.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a taxonomic study. The practitioner memorizes categories rather than recognizing nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Category fixation. Taxonomic pride. Missing the point.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Taxonomy mastery → scholastic debate → sectarian conflict → violence.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "experience taking" suggests acquisition. The instruction framework implies methodology.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Beings all to/in pervading awareness bodhicitta" establishes a universal, all-pervading awareness that exists in all beings as their true nature.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "pervading" suggests omnipresence. "All beings" implies universality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness is substantialized as a universal substance pervading all. The practitioner seeks to merge with this pervading awareness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Universal awareness fixation. Pantheistic view. Rejection of individual mind.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Pantheism → loss of individual responsibility → passive fatalism → inaction.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Emptiness clarity two" establishes a dualistic framework where emptiness and clarity are two separate aspects or dimensions of reality that must be integrated.

WHY IT ARISES:
The number "two" suggests separation. The listing implies distinct categories.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Emptiness and clarity are dualized as separate. The practitioner attempts to unite them.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dualistic thinking. Synthesis effort. Grasping at integration.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Dualistic view → unification effort → frustration → philosophical confusion.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Indicating method's tantra" and "definite term" suggest that tantras are methods of indication with definite meanings that can be precisely defined and understood.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "indicating" suggests pointing. "Definite term" implies precision.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Tantras are reduced to definite指示 systems. The practitioner seeks precise definitions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Definitional fixation. Precision obsession. Missing the symbolic.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Literalism → definition chasing → scholasticism → loss of poetry.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Self-nature's tantra" establishes a category of tantras dealing with self-nature, suggesting that self-nature is a topic or entity to be studied.

WHY IT ARISES:
The possessive "self-nature's" suggests ownership. The categorization implies topic.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Self-nature is reified as a topic of study. The practitioner studies self-nature as object.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Objectification of self. Externalized study. Missing recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Self as object → academic study → no realization → intellectual pride.
