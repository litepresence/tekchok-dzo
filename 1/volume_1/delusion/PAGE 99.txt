[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The elaborate numerical lists (50 nails, 111 breaths, 21,000 ślokas, etc.) are interpreted as literal curriculum requirements—quantified spiritual achievements that must be accumulated for progress.

WHY IT ARISES:
Achievement-oriented culture quantifies everything. Numbers trigger completionist gaming mentality. Western practitioners map this onto "10,000 hours to mastery" and gamification models.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic nature of enumeration is missed. The practitioner literalizes all quantities, believing they must literally count breaths or study exactly 21,000 verses. The pointing function of numbers dissolves into accumulation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Three emanations" ('phyong gsum) become checklist items to accomplish. "Striking the basis" (gnas pa gzhi thog tu 'debs pa) is pursued as technique rather than recognition. The practitioner develops spiritual spreadsheet, tracking progress by quantities rather than qualities.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding numbers as pedagogical devices, the practitioner either becomes compulsive quantifier or dismissive rejecter. The [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] develops—believing that accumulating sufficient "units" of practice produces automatic transformation. When transformation does not occur, they either double down (more numbers!) or abandon practice entirely, claiming "the numbers don't work."

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Black Space, causeless" (klong nag po rgyu med) and the four space categories are interpreted as mystical cosmology—literal description of different regions or dimensions of reality with different properties.

WHY IT ARISES:
New age cosmologies literalize symbolic language. "Space" (klong) triggers dimensional thinking. Western readers project multiverse theory or astral plane concepts onto space categories.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The space categories become map of mystical geography rather than descriptions of recognition. The practitioner seeks to "enter" Black Space or "reach" Vast Space as locations. The pointing function collapses into reified destinations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Causeless" (rgyu med) becomes property of a realm rather than description of appearance's nature. The practitioner believes they must travel to causeless dimension rather than recognize causeless nature of present awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding space categories as pedagogical classifications of recognition, the practitioner develops [EPISTEMIC ERROR]—believing that "knowledge of" the spaces equals realization. They may collect initiations into each space category, accumulating empowerments as cosmic tourism. The actual practice of recognizing self-liberated nature is entirely missed.
