[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "shes rig" (knowing awareness) as two separate things - the knowing faculty and awareness - that must be unified.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Shes" (knowing) and "rig" (awareness) appear as two words. Students assume they refer to two distinct phenomena.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single nature of self-aware awareness is bifurcated into knower and awareness. Students search for the relationship between them.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Philosophical speculation replaces direct recognition. Teachers write treatises on shes-rig theory.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY analysis of terminology, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of knower and awareness, and finally to MEDITATIONISM of trying to unite them.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding the fourfold classification (nature, character, divisions, etc.) as a systematic presentation of the ontological structure of the lamp.

WHY IT ARISES:
Numbered categories suggest comprehensive analysis. The scholarly mind projects systematic philosophy onto the teaching.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Direct pointing is buried under elaborate analysis. Students study the fourfold system instead of recognizing the lamp.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes theoretical study. The simplicity of recognition is lost in complexity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with structure, then to PEDAGOGICAL focus on categories, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of analytical divisions.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "gtad" (focus/fixation) as instruction to deliberately concentrate attention on specific points or objects.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Gtad" (to fix/set) suggests deliberate focusing. Students assume this means concentration practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural settling is replaced by forced concentration. Students develop tension through deliberate focusing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Headaches and eye strain develop. The natural lucidity of awareness is obscured by effort.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of concentration technique, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between fixation and recognition, and finally to PRACTICE harm through physical strain.

[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "lhun grub" (spontaneous presence) as a state of perfection or divine order that exists eternally and must be accessed.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Spontaneous presence" suggests something already complete and perfect. Students assume this is a transcendent state they must reach.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The spontaneity of immediate experience is replaced by seeking a special state of perfection. Students feel inadequate to the "spontaneous."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes aspiration toward an ideal. The ordinariness of natural perfection is rejected.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ETERNALISTIC view of transcendent perfection, then to MEDITATIONISM of aspiring to the spontaneous, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of ordinary vs. perfect.
