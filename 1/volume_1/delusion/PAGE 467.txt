[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The thigle abiding-description as "vast as space, small as horse-hoof divided ten times, clear as sun-moon mandala" is interpreted as literal dimensional claims about actually-existing internal structures.

WHY IT ARISES:
Dimensional language triggers spatial literalism. Measurement-suggestions imply objective scale. The practitioner assumes precise descriptions indicate precise entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical function of dimension-description is lost. Thigle becomes object with size. The practitioner literalizes all measurements, believing "correct" size validates practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Size-orthodoxies emerge. "My thigle was vast as space" becomes achievement-claim. Teachers who specify dimensions gain authority. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed if "wrong-sized."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Dimensional differences are exaggerated. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "thigle-ontology" with precise specifications.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The description of thigle characteristics is interpreted as establishing "thigle-realization" as advanced attainment accessible only to superior practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical sophistication suggests esoteric content. Complex descriptions signal "higher teaching." The practitioner wants advanced status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-to-all nature is lost. Thigle becomes elite attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary awareness is insufficient; thigle-awareness is required.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Thigle practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Non-thigle practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that thigle-points-to-ordinary-awareness is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Thigle-mastery becomes capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having thigle-realization."

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The "indestructible vajra" and "unborn in vajra fortress" descriptions are interpreted as ontological claims about permanent, solid existence of dzogchen-awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Permanent-language triggers eternalism. "Indestructible" suggests permanence. The practitioner wants permanent ground.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The emptiness-of-all-phenomena teaching is lost. The practitioner believes dzogchen-awareness is permanent substance. Eternalism replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Permanent awareness" becomes object of grasping. Change is seen as threat to "vajra nature." The authentic recognition that awareness is neither permanent nor impermanent is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] becomes entrenched by PAGE 469-472's deviations. Having substantialized vajra-nature, the practitioner fears deviation as "destruction of vajra." By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by permanence-anxiety.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The four-lamp summary section is seen as "wrapping up technical content" before "practical application" sections (yoga, deviations). The poetry is skimmed for "practical instructions."

WHY IT ARISES:
Poetic density triggers impatience. Technical completion suggests "moving to application." The practitioner wants "doable" content.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration-function of summary-poetry is missed. The practitioner has lamp-knowledge without lamp-recognition. Information substitutes for realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward utilitarian approach. Poetry is dismissed as "ornament." The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "mere dedication."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga is not contextualized within four-lamp understanding. The deviations (PAGE 471-472) are read mechanically. By PAGE 479, the volume lacks integration.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "channel-palaces" (rtsa'i gzhal yas) and "wisdom-abodes" descriptions are interpreted as literal architectural claims about internal anatomy.

WHY IT ARISES:
Architectural metaphors trigger spatial literalism. "Palace" suggests structure. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate geography.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pedagogical function of palace-metaphor is lost. Internal geography becomes object of study. The practitioner literalizes all spatial language, creating subtle-body cartography.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Channel-palace practitioner" becomes cartographer-identity. Maps of internal palaces proliferate. The authentic recognition that all space is equally awareness is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 476's deity yoga comparison. Palaces there are also substantialized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed elaborate "palace-ontology."

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The thigle-substantialism on this page carries to PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga, where thigle-presence is expected. The deviations (PAGE 471-472) become "thigle-absence," and the practitioner-types (PAGE 473-475) are ranked by "thigle-access."
