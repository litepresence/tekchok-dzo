[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "threefold excellence of support and object" (gsum gyi byed 'dus khyad par) is interpreted as claiming that there are three essential conditions that must all be present for realization, creating a formulaic requirement.

WHY IT ARISES:
Checklist mentality seeks necessary-and-sufficient conditions. "Threefold" triggers completionist thinking. Western practitioners assume numbered lists present requirements rather than descriptions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured. The practitioner believes they must assemble all three excellences before realization is possible. The pointing function of threefold description collapses into prerequisite list.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Support" becomes insufficient without "object." "Excellence" becomes standard to meet. The practitioner evaluates their situation by checklist-criteria, assessing readiness for practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding threefold classification as descriptive rather than prescriptive, the practitioner develops [EPISTEMIC ERROR]—belief in realization-prerequisites. They may delay practice until conditions are "perfect" or despair at missing elements. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—all multi-fold descriptions become mandatory requirements. Recognition becomes achievement contingent on condition-assembly.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of "thigle abiding within the channels like a body, vast as space, small as a horse-hoof, clear as sun and moon mandala" is interpreted as literal description of actually-existing internal structures with specific measurable dimensions.

WHY IT ARISES:
Literal interpretation of subtle-body language is default. Dimensional descriptions trigger spatial mapping. Western practitioners assume anatomical precision indicates objective reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pedagogical function of dimensional metaphor is lost. Thigle becomes objective entity with size. The practitioner literalizes all measurements, treating metaphorical dimensions as literal scale.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Vast as space" becomes cosmic-body claim. "Small as horse-hoof" becomes micro-anatomy. The practitioner develops thigle-materialism, seeking "real" thigle through inner vision.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding dimensions as recognition-pointers, the practitioner develops [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—belief in substantial subtle-body entities. They may obsess over achieving visions of "correctly-sized" thigles, believing size validates authenticity. The [REIFICATION ERROR] becomes total—all subtle-body language is literalized. Recognition is replaced by phenomenological cartography.
