[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "ocean space" (rgya mtsho'i klong) and "sky space" (nam mkha'i klong) are distinct meditative attainments or levels of realization, with Ocean Space being preliminary and Sky Space advanced.

WHY IT ARISES:
The division into categories and the labeling as "great" and "small" Ocean Space suggests hierarchical attainment. The ocean metaphor implies depth and vastness achievable through practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner approaches these as samādhi states to achieve, measuring progress by how "oceanic" or "spacious" their experience feels. The actual meaning of primordial liberation becomes replaced by phenomenological criteria.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fixation on achieving "Great Ocean Space" vs. "Small Ocean Space." Attachment to spacious feelings as signs of realization. Disappointment when experiences don't match the grandeur of the names.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Meditative achievement orientation → comparison with other practitioners → jealousy or pride → failure to recognize that mind nature is equally present in contracted and spacious states → subtle aversion to "ordinary" experience.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The statement that Ocean Space's essence is "eternally self-liberated beyond extremes" establishes a permanent, eternal state of liberation that exists as a ground or basis of reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "eternal" (rtag) appears, and "self-liberated" (rang grol) suggests an inherent quality of reality that persists regardless of recognition. The "beyond extremes" language maps onto absolutist philosophies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reification of emptiness as a permanent ground or ultimate reality that exists independently of the path. The practitioner believes they need to merge with or abide in this eternal ground.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Substantialist interpretation of dharmatā. Belief in an eternal soul or true self disguised as "self-liberated essence." Confusion between the permanent aspect of the view and eternalist metaphysics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Advaita Vedanta confusion → subtle grasping at consciousness as eternal → failure to recognize emptiness of emptiness → philosophical absolutism → rejection of dependent origination → inability to engage conventional reality.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Mind's self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated" refers to a meditative technique where one rests the mind in its natural state of emptiness, and this resting is itself the path.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "self-abiding" (rang gnas) suggests a method of abiding. The phrase "when relied upon" (la ltos pa) implies a practice of focusing on mind-emptiness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a meditation technique for resting in emptiness. The practitioner develops fixation on the state of "abiding" and evaluates practice by how long they can maintain it.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Shamatha-vipashyana confusion. Treating trekchö as a concentration practice. Attachment to the feeling of "resting" as the goal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Effort to maintain "natural state" → tension about relaxation → subtle grasping at non-grasping → cognitive exhaustion → frustration → abandonment of practice.

[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The statement that "dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated" means that since mind is naturally pure, no practice or recognition is necessary—one can simply do as one pleases.

WHY IT ARISES:
The combination of "uncontrived" (ma bcos) and "self-liberated" (rang grol) suggests that any effort or recognition is itself a contrivance that obscures the natural state.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Passive waiting for realization without engagement. Rejection of pointing-out instructions as unnecessary since mind is already self-liberated.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Neglect of the path. Dismissal of teachers and practice. Justification of ordinary mind habits as "natural."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Laziness under guise of non-effort → failure to recognize → spiritual stagnation → rationalization that stagnation is "it" → lifetime wasted in delusion.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The statement that "qualities are completely perfected" establishes that enlightenment involves possessing perfect qualities, complete with all positive attributes and the absence of any negative qualities.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "completely perfected" (yongs su rdzogs) suggests a state of completion and perfection. The natural desire for perfection maps onto this description.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Grasping at enlightenment as a state of possessing perfect qualities. The practitioner seeks to acquire or manifest these qualities as evidence of realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism disguised as Dzogchen. Display of pseudo-wisdom qualities. Hiding negative qualities to appear enlightened.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Performance of enlightenment → inauthenticity → separation from genuine transmission → accumulation of students who want to buy perfection → lineage corruption.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "infinite space" (klong rab 'byams) teachings describe different ways of knowing the expanse, implying that realization involves expanding one's consciousness to encompass more and more until it becomes infinite.

WHY IT ARISES:
The metaphor of vastness and infinity suggests expansion. The division into outer, inner, secret, and ultimate implies progressive revelation through expanded awareness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues consciousness expansion as the goal. Meditation becomes an attempt to make awareness larger, more inclusive, more vast.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Chasing peak experiences of vastness. Confusing expanded states with realization. Missing the point that the "expanse" is not a container but the nature of mind itself.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Psychedelic comparison → pursuit of altered states → failure to recognize that contracted awareness has same nature as expanded → subtle dualism between big mind and small mind.

[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Through causelessness, no reversal; through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed; through absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nowhere established" means there is nothing to do, no path to traverse, and no danger in any action.

WHY IT ARISES:
The explicit negation of cause, condition, and establishment of saṃsāra/nirvāṇa suggests complete freedom from all constraints and consequences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Absolute negation of the path and its results. The practitioner believes that recognizing causelessness means all actions are equal and without result.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dangerous amorality. Rejection of all Buddhist ethics. Rationalization that harm is impossible since nothing is established.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Moral license → harmful behavior → negative karma → obstacles to recognition → descent into lower realms → loss of human birth → aeons of suffering.
