[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes spontaneous accomplishment's mode: uninterrupted, without falling into extremes, the place where form and wisdom arise, inner clarity subtle yet outer vast, the wish-fulfilling jewel's meaning. A reader might think: "This is describing the actual nature of spontaneous accomplishment - a vast, clear, uninterrupted field from which all manifestation arises."

WHY IT ARISES:
Rich descriptive language creates vivid mental imagery. "Wish-fulfilling jewel," "inner clarity," "vast expanse" - these are evocative and seem to describe a real metaphysical domain.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies spontaneous accomplishment as a metaphysical field or medium - the "space" from which all manifestation arises, like a cosmic womb of manifestation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking to enter or abide in "spontaneous accomplishment"
2. Visualizing the "vast expanse" of manifestation
3. Creating dualism: spontaneous source vs manifest world
4. Missing that spontaneous means uncreated, not a source

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (spontaneous as source) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking source experiences) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (source metaphysics). The practitioner seeks the source.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists the five kayas, five speeches, five minds, five qualities, five activities, five wisdoms, five lights arising from spontaneous accomplishment. A reader might think: "This is the complete taxonomy of enlightened manifestation. These are the real components of the display."

WHY IT ARISES:
Systematic lists appeal to our desire for completeness. Five of this, five of that - it feels like a comprehensive map of reality. We imagine understanding the structure of enlightened manifestation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the "fives" as real categories of enlightened manifestation. This becomes a complex metaphysics with five-fold structures throughout reality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing the five-fold taxonomy
2. Seeking experiences of each of the fives
3. Debating the relationships between the fives
4. Missing that fives are pedagogical, not ontological

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (five-fold scholasticism) → REIFICATION ERROR (fives as real) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking five-fold experiences). The practitioner counts to five.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the five lights (white, yellow, red, green, blue) and their associations with different aspects of wisdom. A reader might think: "These five lights are real phenomena - the actual colors of enlightened awareness. I should seek to experience these lights in meditation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Colorful imagery is powerful and evocative. The five lights with their associations create a rich symbolic system. We naturally want to experience these colors as signs of realization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner seeks visionary experiences of colored lights. The five lights become targets of meditation - signs that one has contacted the nature of spontaneous accomplishment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking colored light visions in meditation
2. Interpreting light experiences as signs of progress
3. Creating dualism: light (pure) vs darkness (impure)
4. Missing that lights are metaphors for clarity

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to MEDITATIONISM ERROR (chasing light visions) → REIFICATION ERROR (lights as real signs) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (luminous metaphysics). The practitioner becomes a light-chaser.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes "Klong drug pa" tantra with extensive poetic description of the nature's display: white radiance of unproduced self-resonance, deep clarity, yellow aspect of self-liberated appearance, etc. A reader might think: "This tantra is giving the definitive description of the display's nature - the actual characteristics of each color and aspect."

WHY IT ARISES:
Poetic tantric language seems authoritative and descriptive. We assume it encodes real information about the nature of display. The specificity suggests insider knowledge of enlightened manifestation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats tantric poetry as technical descriptions. The "white radiance of unproduced self-resonance" becomes a technical term for a specific phenomenon.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing tantric descriptions as technical data
2. Seeking experiences that match tantric poetry
3. Debating which tantra's description is most accurate
4. Missing that poetry evokes, not describes

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (poetry as technical manual) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking tantric visions) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching poetry as doctrine). The tradition becomes literalist.
