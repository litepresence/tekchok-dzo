[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "threefold continuous yoga" (rgyun gyi rnal 'byor) of view, meditation, and conduct is interpreted as curriculum of three sequential practices to be trained, believing that familiarization produces continuous yoga.

WHY IT ARISES:
Stage-path frameworks condition sequential thinking. "Yoga" triggers practice-regimen associations. Western practitioners assume numbered instructions present training-program.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The spontaneous-already nature of continuous yoga is obscured. The practitioner believes they must build up continuity through effort. The pointing function of yoga-description collapses into achievement-model.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"View" becomes object of meditation. "Meditation" becomes technique to apply. "Conduct" becomes behavior to maintain. The practitioner literalizes all yoga-language, creating effort-based program.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding continuous yoga as description of recognition-stability rather than technique to acquire, the practitioner develops [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]—endless familiarization-effort. They may accumulate hours of "continuous" practice while missing recognition itself. The [PRACTICE ERROR] spreads—all instructions become training-regimen. Recognition is replaced by duration-metrics.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "deviations" (gol sa) described for view (falling into formless absorptions, form realms, solid matter) are interpreted as literal geographical or dimensional locations that one can literally fall into or travel to.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial language triggers literal mapping. "Fall into" triggers directional imagery. Western practitioners assume cosmological descriptions present spatial realities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-error nature of deviations is lost. The practitioner believes they must navigate around actual locations. The pointing function of deviation-description collapses into map-reading.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Formless absorptions" become destination to avoid. "Form realms" become wrong neighborhood. The practitioner literalizes all spatial-error language, creating geography of mistakes.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding deviations as descriptions of recognition-mistakes rather than locations, the practitioner develops [EPISTEMIC ERROR]—belief in literal soteriological geography. They may fear "falling" into wrong realms, developing spiritual paranoia. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—all error-descriptions are spatialized. Recognition is replaced by navigation-anxiety.
