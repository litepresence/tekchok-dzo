[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The "threefold continuous yoga" (rgyun gyi rnal 'byor gsum) and its nine deviations (gol sa) are interpreted as precise curriculum where deviations are actual errors to be vigilantly avoided.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerative structure triggers anxiety-formation. "Deviation" suggests wrong-path. The practitioner assumes listed errors are real dangers.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured by deviation-paranoia. The practitioner believes they must navigate around nine specific errors. Recognition is replaced by error-avoidance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deviation-monitoring consumes attention. "Am I falling into formless absorption?" becomes constant worry. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply non-recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 470-472's deviation elaboration. Each deviation becomes new fear. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is paralyzed by deviation-avoidance.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The description of deviations is interpreted as establishing "deviation-free practice" as advanced attainment accessible only to superior practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical sophistication suggests esoteric content. Complex deviation-catalog signals "higher teaching." The practitioner wants advanced status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-despite-deviation nature is lost. The practitioner believes deviation-free practice is required. Elitism emerges around "avoiding all nine deviations."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Deviation-free practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Those showing deviation-signs are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply labels for non-recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Deviation-mastery becomes capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having no deviations."

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The deviation-examples—falling into formless absorptions, form realms, solid matter—are interpreted as literal geographical locations one can actually "fall into."

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial language triggers literal mapping. "Fall into" suggests destination. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate cosmography.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-error nature of deviations is lost. The practitioner believes in literal wrong-realms. Navigation-anxiety replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Realm-maps" proliferate. Teachers who detail cosmographies gain authority. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply mistaken views is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Spatial metaphors there are also literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "deviation-geography."

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The deviation section is seen as "danger warnings" to rush through so one can reach "positive content" (practitioner types, colophon). Fear-content creates dismissive reading.

WHY IT ARISES:
Fear-triggering content creates resistance. "Deviations" suggest negativity. The practitioner wants "inspirational" material.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The protective function of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "covered" deviations without understanding them. Information substitutes for discernment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward aversion-pattern. Difficult teachings are avoided. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "positive conclusion" without deviation-awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 470-472's deviation-elaboration is not absorbed. Arriving at PAGE 479 without deviation-understanding, the practitioner misses the colophon's protective function.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "gol sa" (deviation) term itself is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of precise error-diagnosis, superior to other traditions.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical terminology signals expertise. "Deviation" suggests diagnostic precision. The practitioner wants superior diagnostic tools.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The universal-availability of error-recognition is lost. Gol sa becomes dzogchen-exclusive concept. Elitism emerges around "having deviation-map."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Gol sa practitioner" becomes diagnostician-identity. Other traditions are deemed "deviation-ignorant." The authentic recognition that all traditions recognize error is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Gol sa distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "gol sa superiority."

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The deviation-obsession on this page carries to PAGE 470-472's deviation-elaboration. By PAGE 473-475's practitioner-types, deviations become "type-discriminators." The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with deviation-fear.
