[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the five perfections as describing ultimate reality rather than the deluded perspective, concluding that saṃsāra with its karma and afflictions is inherently perfect in an ultimate sense.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "perfection" (phun sum tshogs pa) triggers an automatic valorization response in readers trained to seek "perfect" states. The systematic listing of abode, teacher, retinue, teaching, and time creates an appearance of completeness that readers reflexively project onto ultimate truth rather than recognizing these as categories organizing deluded experience.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The distinction between kun gzhi (ground) and kun gzhi rnam shes (ground-consciousness) collapses. What is actually the alāyavijñāna organizing deluded appearances becomes mistaken for dharmadhātu. The reader no longer recognizes that these five perfections describe how delusion appears to itself.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Karma and afflictions become ontologically sanctioned rather than recognized as what must be transcended. The path structure of Buddhist practice dissolves into a false "everything is already perfect" stance that justifies inaction and maintains habitual patterns.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The reader progresses to later sections with this fundamental misalignment, interpreting all subsequent teachings about wisdom through the lens of saṃsāric perfection, producing a corrupted Dzogchen that validates rather than liberates from delusion.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the Ratnaketu quote "From the pure aspect of appearance-making and grasping, outer objects appear like a retinue" as affirming that deluded cognition (appearance-making and grasping) contains inherent purity, rather than understanding "pure aspect" as referring to the fact that even delusion is nothing other than the display of rigpa.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure "from... pure aspect" suggests a locative origin, making it easy to read this as saying delusion itself has a pure nature within it. Western philosophical habits of immanent critique lead readers to seek "pure aspects" within impure phenomena rather than recognizing the non-dual relationship between base and display.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Appearance-making (snang byed) and grasping ('dzin byed) become validated as having access to purity through some aspect of themselves. The distinction between ye shes (wisdom) and rnam shes (consciousness) is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation practice shifts from transcending delusion to refining it, leading to subtle spiritual materialism where clearer delusions are mistaken for wisdom. The reader begins "purifying" appearances rather than recognizing their nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The error propagates into understanding of trekchö and tögal practices, which become reinterpreted as methods for purifying perception rather than recognizing what has never been impure.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the statement that the uncommon prologue's meaning is shown "through accordance with the door of other scriptures" as suggesting that the uncommon meaning is merely a hermeneutic refinement of common vehicle teachings, rather than a distinct dimension of meaning requiring direct introduction.

WHY IT ARISES:
Academic training in comparative religion and textual studies predisposes readers to see development and refinement rather than radical discontinuity. The word "accord" (mthun pa) triggers interpretive frameworks of progressive revelation or skillful means hierarchies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes subsumed into a gradualist framework where it is merely the most refined expression of common vehicle doctrines. The distinct epistemology of direct recognition (rig pa) is lost in favor of interpretive sophistication.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teacher's role shifts from pointing out the nature of mind to explaining textual nuances. The reading practice becomes an end in itself rather than a support for recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Subsequent passages about the three kāyas' speech are read as sophisticated doctrinal formulations rather than descriptions of how wisdom actually manifests. The text becomes a compendium of interesting ideas rather than a pointing-out instruction.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader understands the three kāyas as three separate entities that speak in three distinct manners, failing to recognize that these are three modes of a single essence's manifestation, not three speakers.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure "Dharmakāya—speech of meaning-essence through blessing" etc. presents three parallel noun phrases that naturally parse as three subjects. The mind habitually reifies grammatical subjects into ontological entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The trikāya doctrine fragments into tritheistic tendencies. The reader begins relating to dharmakāya as a distant ultimate, saṃbhogakāya as an intermediate savior figure, and nirmāṇakāya as accessible historical teachers, missing their essential unity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes oriented toward "accessing" or "receiving teachings from" these three kāyas as external sources, rather than recognizing one's own nature as their source. Devotional and guruyoga practices become objectified.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The later presentation of the three abodes becomes a cosmological map rather than a description of the dimensions of awareness. The reader literalizes the palace imagery and spatial descriptions, losing the pointing function.
