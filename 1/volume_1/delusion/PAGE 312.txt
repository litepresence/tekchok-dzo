[13078-13088]
[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The statement that symbolic language (brda) is "profoundly secret" and "cannot be understood by anyone" triggers either elitism or despair.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Secret" suggests exclusive knowledge. Either spiritual pride or inadequacy supports extreme readings.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that symbols point to direct experience is replaced by belief that only special beings can understand. Or reader despairs of understanding.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner either claims special status or gives up. The accessible pointing to immediate experience is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ELITISM ERROR] or [DESPAIR ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The embryological description is interpreted as literal biological account or as metaphor without recognizing it as pointing to stages of recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Scientific language suggests biological accuracy. The detailed stages suggest developmental process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on the stages of delusion's development is either dismissed as pre-scientific or accepted as biology. The pointing to recognition stages is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader either rejects or literalizes without recognizing symbolic encoding. The esoteric instruction remains hidden.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCIENTISM ERROR] or [LITERALIZATION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "gandharva approaching" and elements combining is understood as literal description of conception rather than teaching on how delusion enters the ground.

WHY IT ARISES:
Embryological detail suggests biological accuracy. The conception narrative triggers literal reproductive reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on how rig pa becomes fixated through ma rig pa is replaced by biological description. The ontological process is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner studies biology rather than recognizing delusion's structure. The pointing to immediate experience is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [BIOLOGIZATION ERROR] and [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The seed syllables (YAM, RAM, KHAM, SAM) are understood as actual magical sounds or powers rather than symbols for the elements' nature.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Seed syllable" suggests creative power. Mantra practices condition this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on the nature of elements is replaced by mantra recitation. The recognition of elements' nature is lost in ritual.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner recites syllables rather than recognizing nature. Dzogchen's direct approach becomes mantra practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MANTRA ERROR] and [RITUALIZATION ERROR].
