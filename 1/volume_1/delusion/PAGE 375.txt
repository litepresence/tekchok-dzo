[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The analogy of the same child becoming a tiger when angry and human when calm is interpreted as proof that wisdom and karma winds are literally the same substance with different accidental properties.

WHY IT ARISES:
The analogy suggests substance with changing qualities. Essentialist frameworks interpret the sameness as shared underlying essence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wind is reified into single substance. The practitioner believes all wind is ultimately one thing that can be either wisdom or karma.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Substantialism obscures emptiness. The practitioner grasps at wind as real substance with variable qualities rather than seeing its empty nature.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The polemical section refuting objections about how one wind can be two presents philosophical arguments that should be studied, understood, and defended as correct doctrine.

WHY IT ARISES:
The debate format suggests philosophical position to be mastered. Academic training encourages analysis and defense of argumentative positions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes philosophical position. The practitioner studies the arguments to defend Dzogchen view in debate rather than realizing the view.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual mastery replaces realization. The practitioner can explain the refutation eloquently without recognizing the nature it points to.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The four wisdom winds' functions (basis wisdom, characteristic wisdom, producing wisdom, moving wisdom) describe permanent ontological categories of wisdom with distinct essential natures.

WHY IT ARISES:
The fourfold classification suggests categorical ontology. Typological habits interpret these as four distinct types of wisdom.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is reified into four types. The practitioner seeks to identify and cultivate each type as distinct entity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Categorical fixation develops. The practitioner obsesses about which wisdom is manifesting rather than recognizing wisdom's non-dual nature.
