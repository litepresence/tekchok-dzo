[AEON ERROR] [TEMPORAL GRANDIOSITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes absorbed in the cosmic scale of time ("aeon form destroy hundred million pass," "aeon samsara eradicator called") developing grandiose conceptions about participating in cosmic cycles rather than immediate recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The vast temporal scales trigger cosmic inflation of self-importance. The ego is flattered by participation in grand narratives.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that buddhahood is recognized in the present moment is lost in temporal obsessions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice is deferred to more "auspicious" times. The present is devalued.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about immediacy are interpreted through the lens of cosmic timing.

[DISSOLUTION ERROR] [TERMINAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the prophecy about the teaching dissolving into the "nature dimension" as establishing a terminal endpoint for dharma, creating anxiety about preservation or apocalyptic expectations.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of dissolution triggers eschatological thinking. The desire for closure supports reading this as an endpoint.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The cyclical nature of teaching manifestation is lost. The reader either despairs or becomes frantic about preservation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conservatism or revolutionary fervor develop based on perceived temporal location relative to dissolution.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that the teaching is always present is entirely missed.

[EMBER ERROR] [RESIDUAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the metaphor of "teaching fire ember rise" as establishing that teachings will survive only in diminished, partial form, creating anxiety about incomplete transmission.

WHY IT ARISES:
The image of dying embers triggers anxiety about loss. The mind habitually fixates on scarcity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The reader becomes obsessed with finding complete teachings before they disappear. Suspicion about current availability develops.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching is approached as endangered species rather than natural presence. Urgency becomes anxiety.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The confidence that the teaching is never lost is entirely missed.
