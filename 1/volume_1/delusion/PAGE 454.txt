[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed description of bindu appearances—moon-like, pea-like, wolf-eye-like—is interpreted as literal shapes that actually exist inside the body and can be visually perceived through thodgal practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Precise similes trigger literal reading. "Like a pea" suggests spherical object. Western visual culture interprets these as actual internal visions to be seen.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes a quest to see specific internal forms. The non-dual self-display of awareness is lost in fixation on achieving particular visions. "Seeing bindus" becomes progress marker.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Dakini Yidgyu eye" (*མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་ཡིད་འགྱུ་བའི་མིག་) becomes target visualization. "Five-colored pea" is sought as experience. Natural display is replaced by deliberate vision-seeking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR]—attempting to force specific visions. [EPISTEMIC ERROR] follows as students confuse visualization with recognition. [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] proliferates.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "familiarization-born bindu" (*གོམས་པ་ལས་བྱུང་བའི་ཐིག་ལེ་) is interpreted as asserting that thodgal visions develop progressively through repeated practice—gradual cultivation of vision-capacity.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Familiarization" (*གོམས་པ་) triggers gradualist reading. "Born from" suggests causal production. Western developmental psychology interprets this as skill-acquisition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes progressive attainment path. Practitioners believe visions develop through repetition and effort. The immediate, direct nature of Dzogchen is replaced by gradualism.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Light-mat" (*འོད་ཀྱི་སྣམ་བུ་) becomes stage one. "Light-ray filament" is stage two. "Bindu sphere" is advanced stage. The natural display is forced into linear progression.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where advanced visions become the goal. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as thodgal is taught as progressive curriculum. [VIEW COLLAPSE] occurs when gradualism replaces direct recognition.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The ultimate abiding bindu (*གནས་པ་དོན་དམ་གྱི་ཐིག་ལེ་) is interpreted as the "real" bindu while conventional bindus are dismissed—dualistic hierarchy that privileges "ultimate" over "conventional."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Ultimate" (*དོན་དམ་) triggers essentialist reading. Two-truths framework is applied dualistically. Western metaphysics seeks "the real thing" behind appearances.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual unity of two truths collapses into hierarchy. Ultimate bindu is reified as truly existent while conventional is dismissed as illusory. The middle way is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners seek "ultimate bindu" while rejecting conventional. "Natural abiding cause bindu" is treated as inferior. The inseparability of ground, path, and fruition is fragmented.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] triggers [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] where ultimate is reified. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as practitioners reject relative practices. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as "ultimate Dzogchen" is taught separately.
