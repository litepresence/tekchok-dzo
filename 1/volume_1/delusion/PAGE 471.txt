[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The distinction between "those who have not seen the direct appearance of awareness" (rig pa mngon sum gyi snang ba ma mthong ba) and those with deviations versus "those with naturally abiding rigpa who know the fruition" (rang gnas kyi rig pa 'di ka 'bras bur shes pa) is interpreted as literal description of two actually different types of persons with different essences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Typological thinking categorizes people into kinds. "Type" triggers essentialist associations. Western practitioners assume descriptions of capacity-variations present ontological distinctions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-to-all nature is obscured. The practitioner categorizes themselves and others by type. The pointing function of capacity-description collapses into identity-labeling.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Not seen" becomes permanent deficiency. "Know the fruition" becomes special endowment. The practitioner essentializes all capacity-language, creating spiritual caste-system.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding capacity-descriptions as pedagogical tailoring rather than ontological classification, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in realization-types. They may resign themselves to inferior status or arrogantly claim superior type. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all capacity-language is essentialized. Recognition is replaced by identity-claiming.

[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The verses stating "Dzogchen familiarization already exists, not produced by meditation; Dzogchen meaning is difficult to realize, not found by indicative words" are interpreted as license for anti-practice nihilism—meditation is pointless, study is useless.

WHY IT ARISES:
Extreme interpretations of "beyond effort" teachings. "Not produced" triggers rejection-of-all-action. Western practitioners assume that if something is not produced by means, all means are worthless.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The skillful-means nature of dzogchen practice is lost. The practitioner abandons all effort, believing recognition either happens spontaneously or not at all. The pointing function of non-production description collapses into passivity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Already exists" becomes excuse for not practicing. "Difficult to realize" becomes reason not to try. The practitioner literalizes all non-effort language, creating spiritual laziness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding non-production as description of recognition-nature rather than prohibition of means, the practitioner develops [NIHILISTIC ERROR]—belief that dzogchen requires no engagement. They may reject all practice, accumulating conceptual understanding without recognition. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—all teachings are read as literal ontological claims. Recognition is replaced by intellectual knowing-about.
