[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the base as having three aspects: essence (ngo bo), nature (rang bzhin), and compassion (thugs rje). A reader might think: "So the base IS these three - it's a triune reality with three distinct characteristics. This is the true nature of things."

WHY IT ARISES:
Trinitarian and triune structures appear in many mystical traditions. We find them satisfying and complete. Three aspects feel more substantial than two, creating a comprehensive metaphysics. Our minds love complete systems.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The three aspects become reified as the inherent structure of reality. The practitioner constructs a metaphysics around essence, nature, and compassion as real attributes of the ultimate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Creating systematic metaphysics of the three aspects
2. Debating the relationships between them
3. Seeking experiences of each aspect separately
4. Missing that these are pedagogical distinctions, not ontological categories

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (reified trinity) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (system-building) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching three aspects as doctrine). The Dzogchen becomes a trinitarian theology.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states that before realized Buddhas or unrealized sentient beings arose, there was self-arisen wisdom unmoving from the base. A reader might think: "So wisdom exists eternally, prior to all manifestation. It's an eternal presence that has always been there."

WHY IT ARISES:
Eternalism is deeply comforting. The idea that "wisdom has always been" provides ontological security. We want something permanent, unchanging, reliable in a world of flux. This is the mind's grasping for permanence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies wisdom (ye shes) as an eternal, ever-present reality. This becomes a subtle form of atman - a permanent awareness underlying all phenomena. Dzogchen becomes Vedanta.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying awareness as eternal presence
2. Seeking to "rest" in ever-present awareness
3. Creating duality between eternal wisdom and changing phenomena
4. Missing that "unmoving" is not ontological permanence

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified eternal wisdom) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking eternal presence) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (atman-like awareness). The practitioner becomes an eternalist.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the base as being like a body but not abiding as a body, like emptiness but not abiding as emptiness, like five lights but not abiding as colors. A reader might think: "This paradox means the base is beyond all categories - it's a transcendent reality that is like things but not those things."

WHY IT ARISES:
Paradoxical language suggests something beyond ordinary reality. When we hear "like X but not X," we imagine a "higher" reality that transcends categories. This appeals to our desire for the extraordinary.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a category of "transcendent beyond-category reality." The base becomes an ineffable something that is like things but not things - a new metaphysical ultimate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying "beyond categories" as a category
2. Seeking transcendent experiences beyond all forms
3. Creating dualism between transcendent base and immanent phenomena
4. Missing that "not abiding" means not fixating, not transcending

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (transcendent metaphysics) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking beyond-form states) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (paradox as higher truth). The practitioner chases the transcendent.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the nature's display as vast, clear, unchanging, with various colors (blue, white, yellow, red, green) each having specific qualities. A reader might think: "So the display has these real characteristics - colors, qualities, features. These are the true properties of the nature's manifestation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Descriptive language naturally creates reification. When we read detailed descriptions, we imagine the described features are real. The five lights and their qualities become ontological facts.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the "five lights" and their associated qualities as real characteristics of enlightened manifestation. This becomes a colorful metaphysics of sacred display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying five lights as real phenomena
2. Seeking visionary experiences of colors and lights
3. Creating hierarchy: pure lights > ordinary appearances
4. Missing that lights are metaphors for clarity, not colored phenomena

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (literal lights) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking light experiences) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (elaborate light metaphysics). The practitioner becomes a light-mystic.
