ERROR TYPE 1: [SENSE BASE SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The twelve sense bases (skye mched bcu gnyis)—the six objects (forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile objects, phenomena) and six consciousnesses—are understood as substantial existents that mechanically produce perception through causal contact, like billiard balls colliding.

WHY IT ARISES:
Materialist conditioning assumes sense organs are physical receptors and objects are external stimuli. The language of "arising and expanding" (skye zhing mched) suggests a causal production model. Western science treats perception as information processing between discrete entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Perception is reified as a mechanical process occurring between truly existent sense organs and objects. The empty, illusory nature of the entire perceptual display is missed. The practitioner attempts to "purify" perception by manipulating these mechanical interactions rather than recognizing their dream-like nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Subject-object dualism becomes entrenched. The practitioner sees themselves as a consciousness separate from the world of objects. Meditation becomes an attempt to control or transcend this mechanical perception rather than recognizing its non-arising nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY] where the practitioner perpetually works on "refining perception" without recognizing perception's empty nature. It generates [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] where understanding sense bases is believed to mechanically produce liberation.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 2: [FACULTY POSSESSION OBSESSION] [PRACTICE ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The twenty-two faculties (dbang po) including the six sense faculties, five physical elements faculties, and eleven mental faculties are interpreted as spiritual capacities that the practitioner must develop, strengthen, and possess in increasing quantities to progress toward enlightenment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Faculty language suggests capabilities to be acquired. The practitioner conflates "faculty of faith" (dad pa'i dbang po) with having strong belief. Spiritual development models emphasize building capacities. Western self-help culture focuses on "developing your strengths."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes capacity-building exercise. The practitioner pursues "stronger faith," "better samadhi," "sharper wisdom" as if enlightenment is a state of highly developed faculties. The recognition that all faculties are empty designations is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual athleticism develops. The practitioner compares their "faculty development" with others. Competition enters practice. The fundamental equality of all beings is obscured by hierarchical assessments of faculty-possession.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This feeds [PROGRESSION MYTH] where enlightenment is conceived as the endpoint of faculty development. It produces [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] where practitioners with apparently stronger faculties are considered spiritually superior.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 3: [PERCEIVED OBJECT REIFICATION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The distinction between "object that appears as a thing" (dngos por snang ba chos can gyi cha) and "emptiness, the object that is dharmata" (stong pa chos nyid kyi cha) is interpreted as establishing two types of truly existent objects—conventional things and ultimate emptiness—rather than two perspectives on the same empty display.

WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic epistemology assumes multiple types of existents. The language of "two objects" (yul ni gnyis te) suggests a categorical division. Practitioners want clear ontological distinctions between conventional and ultimate.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Emptiness becomes a "thing" alongside phenomena. The practitioner seeks "experience of emptiness" as if it were a special object of perception. The unity of appearance and emptiness is lost in favor of alternating between object-perception and emptiness-perception.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation alternates between focusing on objects and attempting to perceive emptiness. The practitioner never rests in non-dual awareness where appearance and emptiness are inseparable. "Emptiness meditation" becomes a special technique rather than the natural state.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] where the practitioner seeks methods that promise direct perception of emptiness without understanding. It generates [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where emptiness is reified as "nothing" and phenomena are rejected in its favor.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 4: [ELEMENTAL REDUCTIONISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The correlation between sense faculties and the five great elements (earth in eye, wind in ear, water in nose, fire in tongue, space in mind) is interpreted literally as a materialist reduction of perception to elemental physics, missing the symbolic and pedagogical intent.

WHY IT ARISES:
Materialist science seeks physical explanations for all phenomena. The elemental correlations appear to offer a "scientific" model of perception. Practitioners trained in reductionist thinking assume this is the definitive explanation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dharma becomes materialist physics. The profound correlation between sense perception and elemental manifestation is reduced to crude mechanism. The symbolic richness—earth as stability of form, wind as movement of sound—is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner attempts to manipulate elements to control perception. "If I balance my elements, I'll perceive correctly." The spontaneous wisdom that recognizes all perception as empty display is replaced by elemental engineering.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] where elemental balance is believed to mechanically produce enlightenment. It generates [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] where the practitioner perpetually works on "elemental harmony" before attempting recognition.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 5: [GRASPED-GRASPER DUALISM OBSESSION] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The division into "grasped objects" (gzung ba) and "grasping consciousnesses" ('dzin pa) is interpreted as establishing an absolute ontological dualism between subject and object, rather than demonstrating the conventional designations that obscure the non-dual nature of mind.

WHY IT ARISES:
Subject-object dualism is the fundamental habitual pattern. The text's analytical presentation appears to validate this division. The practitioner assumes the goal is to eliminate the object-pole while preserving the subject-pole.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes elimination of objects. The practitioner attempts to dissolve the world while maintaining awareness. Non-duality is misunderstood as "consciousness without objects" rather than the inseparability of perceiver and perceived.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner develops aversion toward phenomena. "All objects are illusions to be seen through" becomes a rejection of appearance. The luminous display of rigpa is suppressed in favor of blank subjectivity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where the practitioner denies the validity of all experience. It generates [SUTRA DISMISSAL] when the practitioner concludes that sutra teachings about sense bases are merely dualistic constructs to be transcended by "higher" Dzogchen.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS
================================================================================

PREVIOUS PAGE (52) CONTEXT:
Page 52 completed the transcendent aggregates presentation. Page 53 transitions to the twelve sense bases (skye mched) and twenty-two faculties (dbang po). This is not a new topic but a different analytical framework applied to the same experiential field.

NEXT PAGE (54) ANTICIPATION:
The text will elaborate on the faculties, particularly the elemental correlations and the distinction between object-pole and subject-pole. The practitioner must maintain continuity—sense bases, aggregates, and faculties are three perspectives on the same empty experience.

CRITICAL CONTINUITY POINT:
The Sun and Moon Sutra citation continues from page 52. The practitioner must not treat this as mere scriptural ornament but recognize it as pointing to the authoritative presentation of these distinctions as pedagogical devices, not ontological claims.

BLEED RISK:
High. The proliferation of categories (12 sense bases, 22 faculties) invites categorical obsession. The practitioner may complete this section with elaborate knowledge of all categories while remaining ignorant of their empty nature.
