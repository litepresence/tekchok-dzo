[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Four lamps" (sgron ma bzhi) are understood as actual light sources or visual phenomena to be cultivated in meditation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Lamp" suggests illumination to develop. Meditative visualization practices condition this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The four modes of intrinsic awareness are reduced to visual experiences. The technical meaning of the four lamps is entirely lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks light experiences rather than recognizing awareness-nature. Dzogchen recognition becomes light-based meditation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [VISION-SEEKING ERROR] and [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SPATIALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "bar do of unarranged appearance" (yul ma bkod par snang ba) is interpreted as an actual intermediate state place between death and rebirth.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Bar do" commonly refers to after-death state. Popular Buddhist cosmology supports literal spatial interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition that bar do is the nature of present experience is lost. Practice becomes preparation for future death rather than present recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner postpones recognition until death. The teaching that bar do is always displaying is entirely missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [FUTURIZATION ERROR] and [DEATH-ORIENTED ERROR].

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "jewel house" (rin po che'i khang pa) is understood as actual abode to reach or visualized pure land rather than spontaneous presence (lhun grub).

WHY IT ARISES:
"House" suggests dwelling place. Pure land visualization practices condition this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Spontaneous presence is externalized as destination. The teaching that lhun grub is the display of one's own nature is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about reaching a place rather than recognizing what already is. The immanence of realization is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURE-LAND EXTERNALIZATION ERROR] and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].

[SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The narrative of the five princes being imprisoned is understood as historical-political drama rather than teaching on how the five poisons bind rig pa.

WHY IT ARISES:
Political narrative triggers historical reading. The imagery of imprisonment suggests social oppression interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The technical teaching about how afflictions (nyon mongs) bind awareness is replaced by political allegory. Dzogchen anatomy is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they understand the "meaning" while remaining ignorant of the precise pointing to recognition of affliction's nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [POLITICIZATION ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].
