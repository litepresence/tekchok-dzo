[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "sems dang sems byung" (mind and mental factors) as referring to ordinary psychological processes of cognition and emotion.

WHY IT ARISES:
These are standard Abhidharma terms commonly used in Buddhist psychology. Students automatically psychologize them.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The technical distinction between kun gzhi and chos sku is reduced to psychological analysis. Students analyze their mental states.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes introspective psychology. The transcendent dimension of dharmakaya is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of Abhidharma, then to MEDITATIONISM of mental observation, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reduction of nature to psychology.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding "thog ma'i kun tu bzang po" (primordial Samantabhadra) as a mythological figure or first Buddha that one worships.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Samantabhadra" is personified in art and ritual. Students assume this refers to an actual being.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbol of primordial purity is reified into a deity. Practice becomes devotional rather than recognitive.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students pray to Samantabhadra. The recognition that one is primordially pure is replaced by worship.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of symbolic figures, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of devotional practice, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL theism.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "rtog pa" (thought/concept) as the enemy that must be stopped through forceful meditation.

WHY IT ARISES:
Thought is commonly seen as obstacle to meditation. Students assume practice means stopping thoughts.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The self-liberated nature of thought is missed. Practice becomes struggle against thinking.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students develop tension suppressing thoughts. Natural flow is replaced by rigid control.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of thought suppression, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of thought vs. nature, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through suppression.

[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "sku" (body/kaya) in the three kayas as referring to actual bodies or forms that Buddhas possess.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Body" naturally suggests physical form. Students assume kayas are divine bodies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The three aspects of enlightened nature are reified into three bodies. Students imagine possessing these bodies after enlightenment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes body-achievement project. The formless nature of dharmakaya is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of kayas, then to ETERNALISTIC view of divine bodies, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of enlightenment.
