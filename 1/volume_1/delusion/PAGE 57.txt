[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [CONSCIOUSNESS AS ENTITY]

MISREADING:
The six or eight consciousnesses are actual separate entities or faculties that perceive.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumeration suggests distinct entities. Reification of cognitive functions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Consciousness understood as substance or thing rather than dependent arising.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Alaya-vijnana reified as "storehouse" container.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].
