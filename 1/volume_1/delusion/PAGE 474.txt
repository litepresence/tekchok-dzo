[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The examples (dpe) comparing Buddha and sentient beings to "head and horns" (mgo dang rwa) are interpreted as literal claim about metaphysical structures—that Buddha literally has something sentient beings lack, like a head has what horns lack.

WHY IT ARISES:
Essentialist thinking assumes beings have different natures. "Head and horns" triggers anatomical comparison. Western practitioners assume analogies present ontological similarities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-to-all nature is obscured. The practitioner believes Buddhas and sentient beings are essentially different types. The pointing function of analogy collapses into categorical distinction.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Buddha" becomes superior being-type. "Sentient being" becomes inferior type. The practitioner essentializes all comparative language, creating spiritual hierarchy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding analogies as recognition-pointers rather than ontological claims, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in Buddha-sentient-being essentialism. They may feel permanently inadequate or conversely claim Buddha-status prematurely. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all comparative language is essentialized. Recognition is replaced by identity-comparison.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The examples comparing recognition and ignorance to "water and drawing" (chu dang ri mo) or "water and bubbles" (chu dang lbu ba) are interpreted as claims about different substances or that ignorance is merely superficial while recognition is deep.

WHY IT ARISES:
Depth metaphors trigger hierarchical thinking. "Water and drawing" triggers surface-depth associations. Western practitioners assume analogies present ontological hierarchies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The simultaneous-empty-and-manifest nature of both recognition and ignorance is lost. The practitioner privileges "deep" over "surface." The pointing function of water-analogy collapses into hierarchical ontology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Recognition" becomes depth to access. "Ignorance" becomes surface to transcend. The practitioner literalizes all depth-language, creating spiritual stratigraphy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding water-analogies as pointing to recognition-contexts rather than depth-hierarchies, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in dzogchen depth-ontology. They may devalue conventional life as "surface," developing spiritual bypassing. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all metaphorical language is hierarchicalized. Recognition is replaced by depth-achievement.
