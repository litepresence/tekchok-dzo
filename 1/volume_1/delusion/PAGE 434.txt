[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SUBSTANTIALIST ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18274-18331: The text describes three types of wisdom: basis-abiding wisdom (ka dag), self-perfected nature (lhun grub), and all-pervading compassion. One might see these as three distinct ontological entities or layers of reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The threefold classification (gsum du 'dod) suggests systematic ontology. The categories appear to describe different "things" or aspects of reality that could be enumerated and studied.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of the three wisdoms is missed. What are actually three ways of describing the same recognition appear as separate realities to be understood individually.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek to experience "ka dag," then "lhun grub," then "thugs rje" as sequential attainments, creating new forms of spiritual materialism and goal-orientation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LAYER ERROR] where reality appears stratified, and [SEQUENTIAL ERROR] where wisdoms become stages to progress through.

[DESCRIBED ERROR] [ATTRIBUTION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18295-18305: The basis-pure wisdom is described with negative characteristics: "beyond existence and non-existence," "without name for ignorance," "no one or two," etc. One might conclude it is a transcendent void or annihilation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The apophatic language (what it is not) naturally suggests negation. Without understanding that negation is pedagogical (removing conceptual overlay), readers project their own concepts of "beyond."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Emptiness is reified as a thing, a state, or a transcendental reality. The radical openness that cannot be characterized becomes a new metaphysical absolute.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "beyond existence and non-existence" as a special state, creating subtle eternalism. Or they may fall into nihilism, understanding "empty" as "nothing exists."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TRANSCENDENT ERROR] where emptiness becomes metaphysical ground, and [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where negation is literalized as non-existence.
