[OBJECT ERROR] [EXPERIENCE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18607-18641 describe three types of object wisdom (yul gyi ye shes): "wisdom of appearances" (snang ba'i ye shes), "wisdom of emptiness" (stong pa'i ye shes), and "wisdom of objects" (yul gyi ye shes). The reader understands these as different experiences or states to be achieved through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The threefold classification (gsum) suggests a complete typology of wisdom types. The object-oriented language (yul gyi) suggests wisdom is about objects, has objects, or takes objects. The distinct names imply distinct phenomena.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is completely objectified as having content, being about something, or being directed toward objects. The non-referential, non-objectifiable nature of recognition is obscured by the very description of wisdom's "types" and "objects."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may cycle through seeking "appearance wisdom," then "emptiness wisdom," then "object wisdom." They may try to have experiences corresponding to each type. New forms of temporal practice and goal-orientation develop around experiencing each wisdom-type.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [OBJECTIFICATION ERROR] where wisdom becomes content of experience, [CYCLING ERROR] where practitioners move between states, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where types become goals, [ACCUMULATION ERROR] where all three must be collected, and [TYPE FIXATION] where categories are reified.

[GRADUATION ERROR] [PROGRESS ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18643-18660 describe how experience "increases like the waxing moon" from new moon to full moon, and mentions "signs" (rtags) and "marks" (mtshan) of progress. The reader understands this as describing necessary developmental stages that all practitioners must pass through.

WHY IT ARISES:
The developmental language (increase, waxing, progress) naturally suggests gradual growth over time. The lunar metaphor implies predictable, natural progression. We are habituated to understanding spiritual growth as developmental. Signs and marks suggest measurable indicators.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is completely temporalized as a process with stages, phases, and progress indicators. What is actually timeless and immediate appears as something that develops gradually over time with practice, like a moon waxing from new to full.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may constantly evaluate their practice by whether they experience "progress" or see "signs." Self-evaluation and comparison with others become ongoing activities. The simplicity of recognition is complicated by developmental frameworks.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [STAGE ERROR] where path is reified as stages, [SELF-EVALUATION ERROR] where practitioners assess progress, [COMPARISON ERROR] where others are measured, [EXPECTATION ERROR] where signs are awaited, and [DEVELOPMENTAL FIXATION] where growth is assumed.

[MOON ERROR] [PHASE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18643-18652 specifically compare wisdom's increase to "the waxing moon"—from "new moon not seen" to "one day to fifteen days gradually arising" to "full moon complete." The reader literalizes this as describing actual phases of practice development.

WHY IT ARISES:
The lunar metaphor is vivid, culturally resonant, and suggests natural, inevitable progression. The specificity (one day to fifteen days) suggests precise mapping. The comparison to moon phases implies universal pattern.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphor is literalized as actual description of practice stages. Practitioners may believe they should experience "new moon" phase, then gradually advance through "waxing" phases, eventually reaching "full moon" completion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may evaluate themselves by which "moon phase" they are in. They may believe staying in "new moon" means failure, while reaching "full moon" means success. The metaphor that should liberate becomes new prison.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PHASE FIXATION] where lunar stages are mapped to practice, [CALENDAR ERROR] where days are counted, [COMPLETIONISM] where full moon is awaited, [SELF-ASSESSMENT] where phase is identified, and [NATURALIZATION] where progression is assumed inevitable.

[SIGN ERROR] [INDICATOR ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18653-18660 describe "signs" (rtags) and "marks" (mtshan) of wisdom—bodily, verbal, and mental signs that indicate wisdom's presence. The reader understands these as reliable indicators that can be recognized and cultivated.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of signs and marks suggests objective indicators. The specificity (bodily, verbal, mental) implies systematic observation. We naturally seek confirmation that practice is working.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Signs become objectified as reliable indicators of wisdom. Practitioners may watch for signs, believe they indicate progress, or try to produce them. The understanding that signs are provisional, may be mistaken, and are not wisdom itself is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may become obsessed with sign-watching—monitoring their body, speech, and mind for indicators. They may fake signs or interpret ordinary phenomena as special. The natural recognition is replaced by sign-production.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SIGN FIXATION] where indicators are watched, [INTERPRETATION ERROR] where phenomena are analyzed, [PRODUCTION ERROR] where signs are manufactured, [SELF-MONITORING] where constant checking occurs, and [CONFIRMATION SEEKING] where validation is needed.

[TATHAGATAGARBHA ERROR] [BUDDHA-NATURE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18661-18685 extensively quote tathagatagarbha scriptures—Tathagatagarbha Sutra, Uttaratantra, Saraha's Doha—stating "all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature" and "all sentient beings are Buddhas." The reader reifies Buddha-nature as an actual entity, essence, or latent capacity within beings.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "Buddha-nature" (sangs rgyas kyi snying po) and phrases like "all sentient beings are Buddhas" suggest possession of an inner essence, seed, or potential. Language naturally substantializes. The scriptural authority makes these claims difficult to question.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature becomes reified as a hidden treasure, true self, permanent essence, or latent capacity waiting to manifest. The emptiness of Buddha-nature—even Buddha-nature is empty—is completely missed in favor of eternalistic interpretation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may search for their "inner Buddha," creating subtle self-grasping. They may assume they are "already perfect" and need do nothing, missing the distinction between basis and recognition. Or they may believe they must "actualize" their Buddha-nature through effort.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TREASURE HUNTING ERROR] where Buddha-nature is sought as object, [ETERNALISM ERROR] where emptiness is reified as essence, [LATENT ERROR] where potential is grasped, [ACTUALIZATION ERROR] where nature must be made manifest, and [PASSIVITY ERROR] where "already Buddha" justifies inaction.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 434 introduces object wisdom types and developmental progress markers. The waxing moon metaphor particularly invites temporalization. The tathagatagarbha citations set up Buddha-nature errors that continue through page 435. Page 435 will elaborate Buddha-nature and obscuration. The signs and marks language establishes indicator fixation. The three object wisdoms maintain the typological approach of previous pages. The moon phases metaphor will be referenced in subsequent discussions of progress. The extensive scriptural citations on this page require hermeneutical awareness. The tathagatagarbha theme will be central to page 435's discussion.
