[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The correlation of channels with seasons (spring growth, summer memory, autumn taste, winter peak wheel) constitutes an astrological system where timing practice to seasons produces optimal results.

WHY IT ARISES:
The seasonal correspondences resemble agricultural and astrological timing systems. Readers familiar with seasonal practices map these frameworks onto the description.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes seasonal astrology. The practitioner believes practice must be timed to seasons for effectiveness, waiting for "right time" rather than recognizing timeless nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Temporal fixation replaces timeless recognition. The practitioner obsesses about seasonal timing, missing that awakening is not dependent on external conditions.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The elaborate calculations of breath cycles (21,600 per day, etc.) describe fixed physiological facts about human breathing that can be measured and used to calculate lifespan and fortune.

WHY IT ARISES:
The precise numerical enumeration suggests scientific quantification. Modern readers habitually treat numerical descriptions as measurable physical facts.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen physiology becomes fixed biological determinism. The practitioner treats breath calculations as destiny-mapping rather than pedagogical framework.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Numerological obsession develops. The practitioner becomes fixated on counting breaths and calculating lifespan rather than recognizing breath's empty nature.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "nine vital points" (gnad dgu) for channel practice are specific techniques that must be mastered sequentially to achieve proficiency in wind-work and realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numbered list and prescriptive language suggest a curriculum of techniques. Educational frameworks encourage sequential mastery of enumerated skills.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a curriculum of nine techniques. The practitioner works through the nine points as progressive stages, believing mastery produces realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Skill accumulation replaces recognition. The practitioner develops proficiency in techniques without the view-based recognition that makes them meaningful.
