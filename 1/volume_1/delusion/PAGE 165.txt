[CAUSAL ERROR] [KARMIC ACCOUNTING ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the statement that buddhahood is obtained "from secret great this-of time-from" as establishing that meeting this teaching is the sole sufficient cause of liberation, discounting all other factors and creating spiritual elitism.

WHY IT ARISES:
The exclusivity implied in "this teaching" combined with "quick buddha obtain" suggests a direct causal link that triggers reductionist thinking about causes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The complex web of conditions is reduced to a single factor. The reader develops arrogance about having the "right" teaching.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Other paths are devalued. Spiritual elitism develops around Dzogchen practitioners.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that all paths lead to the same nature is lost in favor of sectarian triumphalism.

[ACCUMULATION ERROR] [MERIT OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the reference to "before aeon many-from accumulation gather-by-means-of power" as establishing that merit accumulation is a prerequisite for meeting this teaching, creating anxiety about having "enough" merit.

WHY IT ARISES:
The causal language ("by-means-of power") triggers karmic accounting mentality. The reader worries about qualifying for the teaching.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes oriented toward accumulating merit rather than direct recognition. The present opportunity is doubted.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The reader either despairs about insufficient past merit or becomes complacent about having "earned" the teaching.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that recognition is immediately available regardless of past accumulation is entirely missed.

[DEMOGRAPHIC ERROR] [GENDER ESSENTIALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the specific numbers of male and female liberations ("male thousand six," "woman form thousand one") as establishing gender-based differences in spiritual capacity or destiny.

WHY IT ARISES:
The gendered categories trigger essentialist thinking. Cultural gender biases support reading these numbers as evidence of spiritual hierarchy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Gender becomes a determining factor in spiritual practice. Discrimination is validated by textual reference.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching that form is emptiness is contradicted by gender essentialism. Practice becomes gender-policed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about the equality of all beings are interpreted through gender hierarchies.
