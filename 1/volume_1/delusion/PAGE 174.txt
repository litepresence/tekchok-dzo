[WISH-FULFILLMENT ERROR] [DESIRE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the description of the guru as "wish jewel and wish tree like" who grants "what desire all accomplish" as establishing that spiritual practice will fulfill all worldly desires, confusing material success with spiritual attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
The wish-fulfillment imagery triggers material desire. The promise that all desires will be accomplished supports consumerist spirituality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching becomes a prosperity gospel. Spiritual practice is instrumentalized for wealth and success.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The renunciation aspect of the path is abandoned. The reader pursues worldly goals through spiritual means.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that desire itself is the problem is entirely missed.

[EMPOWERMENT BENEFIT ERROR] [INITIATION MAGIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the list of empowerment benefits (obstacle removal, appearance as helpers, all actions succeed) as establishing that empowerment is a magical transmission guaranteeing success regardless of practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The instrumental language (benefit, accomplish, become) triggers magical thinking. The desire for guaranteed results supports this.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Empowerment becomes a talisman. The necessity of practice is forgotten.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Disappointment when results don't materialize. Blame is placed on the empowerment rather than one's own effort.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that liberation requires recognition is replaced by belief in magical transmission.

[INTERMEDIATE STATE ERROR] [BARDO OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the mention of recognizing self-appearance in the intermediate state as establishing that liberation primarily happens after death, deferring practice to the bardo.

WHY IT ARISES:
The mention of the intermediate state triggers afterlife preoccupation. Death anxiety supports deferring practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Present practice is neglected in favor of preparing for death. The teaching's immediacy is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Bardo practices become divorced from present recognition. Anxiety about death increases.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that buddhahood is available now is entirely forgotten.
