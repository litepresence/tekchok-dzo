[PROLIFERATION ERROR] [MULTIPLICITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17993-18017: The enumeration continues with six types of mentation (yid), then expands to the twenty-five proximate afflictions, fifty-one, and 84,000. The comprehensive scope might suggest these are real, countable entities.

WHY IT ARISES:
Quantification creates sense of precision and completeness. The specificity of numbers (25, 51, 84,000) suggests systematic knowledge rather than provisional enumeration.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single root of all afflictions (non-recognition) is forgotten in the dazzling display of multiplicity. Liberation appears as an endless task of elimination.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of afflictions to address, or conversely, may collect knowledge about them as a form of spiritual materialism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXHAUSTION ERROR] where the path appears impossible, and [CATALOGING ERROR] where practitioners become collectors of affliction-knowledge rather than recognizers of mind.

[HERMENEUTICAL ERROR] [SOURCE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18017-18032: The text cites sources like Sun and Moon Blending Tantra (nyi zla kha sbyor) for lists of afflictions. One might treat these citations as establishing authoritative truth-claims rather than skillful means.

WHY IT ARISES:
Traditional reverence for tantric sources combines with academic citation practices to give scriptural references weight as proof rather than pointer.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The experiential nature of the teachings is lost. What are meant to be invitations to recognize one's own condition become dogmas to be accepted on authority.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Debate about which sources are "authentic" or "higher" obscures the living recognition that all sources are meant to evoke. Scriptural study substitutes for practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [FUNDAMENTALISM ERROR] where literal interpretation overrides experience, and [SECTARIAN ERROR] where affiliation with particular texts becomes identity marker.
