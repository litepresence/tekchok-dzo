[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL ANATOMY SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The three channels (Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma) are actual anatomical structures that can be located via dissection or medical imaging.

WHY IT ARISES:
Detailed descriptions of locations at lines 14003-14020: "skyes pa'i g.yas la bud med kyi g.yon na yod" (man's right, woman's left), precise bodily positioning.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing channels as physical tubes or vessels rather than wisdom-display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting surgical or invasive procedures to "open" channels.
Missing that channels are the natural flow of awareness itself.
Materializing the immaterial.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MEDICAL MATERIALISM ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [GENDER DUALISM REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
The different locations of channels in male and female bodies indicate fundamental gender differences in spiritual anatomy.

WHY IT ARISES:
Explicit gendered descriptions at lines 14010-14015 and throughout: "skyes pa'i g.yas la bud med kyi g.yon" (man's right, woman's left).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing gender as ontologically fixed rather than conventional.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Privileging one gender's channels as superior.
Missing that all channels are equally wisdom-display regardless of body type.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[GENDER ESSENTIALISM ERROR]

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL NAMING OBSTRUCTION]

MISREADING:
The three channels must be memorized by their names (Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma) and their characteristics recalled intellectually.

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 14020: "rtsa gsum po de...ma zhes btags so" (these three channels... are called 'ma').

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Intellectual proliferation rather than direct recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Thinking knowing names equals knowing nature.
Missing that all designation is conventional.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MNEMONIC OBSTRUCTION ERROR]
