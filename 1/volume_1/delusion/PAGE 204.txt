[PRACTICE ERROR] [EMPOWERMENT TRANSACTION]

MISREADING:
The four empowerments are understood as transactions where something is transferred from guru to disciple, like a license or certification that authorizes subsequent practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Legal-institutional frameworks project onto transmission. The language of "receiving" and "bestowal" suggests property transfer. The desire for authorized status supports transactional interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that empowerment is recognition of one's own nature is entirely lost. Guru becomes external granter, disciple becomes dependent recipient. Self-sufficiency is abandoned for dependency.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Lineage shopping and empowerment collecting replace practice. Guru devotion degenerates into credential-seeking. The pointing-out instruction is missed while the ritual is obsessively documented.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION]. Subsequent pages on empowerment stages will be misread as progressive authorization levels.

[VIEW ERROR] [VASE SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The vase empowerment (bum dbang) is interpreted as literally purifying the physical body through contact with blessed water, like a spiritual cleansing or baptism.

WHY IT ARISES:
Purification-through-contact frameworks project from other religions. The physicality of the vase and water suggests material purification. Desire for tangible spiritual cleansing supports literalism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that vase empowerment introduces the nature of mind as empty-yet-lucid is entirely obscured. Water-touch is mistaken for wisdom-transmission.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners obsess over water quality, vase materials, and ritual purity while neglecting recognition. External cleanliness replaces internal realization. The symbolic becomes the substantial.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent empowerments will be approached as accumulative purifications rather than progressive recognitions.

[EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [SECRET SUBSTANCE]

MISREADING:
The secret empowerment (gsang dbang) involving bodhicitta is understood as physical substance transmission with automatic efficacy, like receiving a transfusion of spiritual material.

WHY IT ARISES:
Substance-exchange frameworks project onto tantric practice. The physiological nature of bodhicitta suggests material transfer. Taboo reinforces belief in hidden power.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that secret empowerment introduces the union of bliss-emptiness is entirely lost. Substance-contact is mistaken for wisdom-transmission.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners seek substances while neglecting recognition. Health risks arise from improper substance handling. Consent violations occur under guise of "empowerment." The wisdom dimension is reduced to chemistry.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] and [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on subtle body will be approached as substance-manipulation.

[GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [WISDOM SEQUENCING]

MISREADING:
The wisdom-prajna empowerment (shes rab ye shes dbang) and word empowerment (tshig dbang) are interpreted as advanced stages requiring preparation through previous empowerments, forming a temporal curriculum.

WHY IT ARISES:
Educational progression models impose sequential learning frameworks. The numerical ordering suggests prerequisite structure. Fear of "incomplete foundation" drives deferral.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that all four empowerments are simultaneous aspects of single recognition is entirely lost. The highest empowerment is deferred indefinitely while lower ones are obsessively repeated.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners accumulate empowerments like academic degrees without recognizing their nature. Elitist hierarchies form around empowerment-status. The simplicity of direct introduction is abandoned for complexity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. Trekcho/thogyal will be approached as advanced curriculum rather than direct recognition.

[PROGRESS TRACKING] [PURIFICATION METRICS]

MISREADING:
The 64, 128, or 512 bodies/purifications are interpreted as measurable quotas to be completed, like items on a spiritual checklist, with completion guaranteeing attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Quantification provides illusion of progress. The mathematical precision suggests calculable achievement. Anxiety about "enough" practice drives counting-obsession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that these numbers point to recognition, not quantities to accumulate, is entirely lost. Practice becomes spreadsheet management rather than wisdom cultivation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners compete over numbers completed while neglecting quality of recognition. Burnout from obsessive counting leads to abandonment of practice. The symbolic becomes the literal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on signs of warmth will be treated as completion certificates rather than natural expressions of recognition.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains empowerment instructions. Preceding pages established posture and mantra errors that carry forward. Following pages (205+) discuss subtle body bliss practices that will be misunderstood as empowerment-dependent techniques rather than universally available recognition.
