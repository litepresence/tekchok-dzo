[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "ngo bo" (essence/nature) as a definable core or substance that constitutes the fundamental being of awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Essence" suggests a core substance. Students assume this means an identifiable nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ungraspable nature is reified into an essence. Students try to grasp their essence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes essentialism. The emptiness of essence is obscured by seeking it.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ONTOLOGICAL essentialism, then to MEDITATIONISM of essence-seeking, and finally to REIFICATION of awareness-substance.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding "mtshan nyid" (characteristic/defining quality) as a set of properties or attributes that define what something is.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Characteristic" suggests descriptive properties. Students assume this means definable attributes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ineffable nature is forced into conceptual categories. Students make lists of characteristics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes studying characteristics. Direct recognition is replaced by conceptual knowledge.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY taxonomy, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of characteristics, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL conceptual fixation.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "rtogs pa" (realization) as an experience or achievement that one gains through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Realization" suggests attainment. Students assume this is a goal to achieve.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural recognition is replaced by achievement project. Students measure their realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Hierarchy of realization develops. Competition and comparison arise.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of goal-oriented practice, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as achievement motivation, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of realizer and realized.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "shes pa" (knowing/consciousness) as ordinary cognitive awareness or subjectivity.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Knowing" commonly refers to cognitive awareness. Students psychologize this term.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The transcendent knowing of wisdom is reduced to psychological awareness. Students study their consciousness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes introspection. The surpassing of ordinary consciousness is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as consciousness studies, then to MEDITATIONISM of awareness practice, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reduction of wisdom to psychology.
