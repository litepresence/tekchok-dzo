[HYBRIDITY ERROR] [MONSTROUS ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader literalizes the descriptions of hybrid beings ("bird body-to human face") as establishing the actual existence of such creatures or as metaphors for racial/cultural mixing, missing the symbolic function.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grotesque imagery triggers both literalist and allegorical readings that are reductive. The boundary-challenging nature of such figures is domesticated into familiar categories.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching about the non-duality of realms becomes either superstitious (believing in monsters) or racist (using hybrids to represent mixed peoples).

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The symbolic dimension is lost. The reader either believes unbelievable things or reduces symbols to sociology.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The capacity to work with potent imagery is atrophied. All symbols are flattened.

[AEON ERROR] [COSMIC GRANDIOSITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes absorbed in the cosmic scale of the Brahma-great aeon calculations, developing grandiose self-conceptions about participating in world-historical processes rather than attending to immediate recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The vast temporal scales ("hundred-thousand seven") trigger cosmic inflation of self-importance. The ego is flattered by participation in grand narratives.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Ordinary practice seems trivial compared to cosmic destiny. The present moment is devalued.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual narcissism develops around being "holders" of teachings across aeons. Humility is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that buddhahood is recognized in ordinary mind is rejected as too small-scale.
