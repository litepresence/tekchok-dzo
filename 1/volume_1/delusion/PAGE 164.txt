[MAGNITUDE ERROR] [SCALE OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes captivated by the vast numbers ("hundred-thousand sixty four," "hundred-thousand nineteen") and cosmic scales, developing grandiose conceptions of the teaching's importance that obscure its immediate accessibility.

WHY IT ARISES:
The magnitude of the figures triggers cosmic inflation of significance. The ego is flattered by association with vast numbers.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching becomes "too big" for ordinary practice. The reader feels unworthy or waits for appropriate cosmic conditions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual narcissism develops around participation in vast processes. Humility and ordinariness are lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that buddhahood is realized in ordinary mind is rejected as insufficiently grand.

[PHYSICAL ERROR] [COSMIC BODY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader literalizes the descriptions of Vairocana's physical manifestation ("hand palm-by-means-of lotus blossom," "heart center glory ox") as establishing that awakened beings have physically extraordinary bodies with measurable marks.

WHY IT ARISES:
The vivid physical imagery triggers literalist readings. Buddhist aniconography traditions support reading marks as literal physical characteristics.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teachings about the emptiness of form are contradicted by physical essentialism. The body becomes a site of obsession.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The reader pursues physical transformation rather than recognition. Body-based practices degenerate into physical cultism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle that form is emptiness is entirely missed in favor of super-physical ideals.

[STATISTICAL ERROR] [QUANTIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader treats the enumeration of liberations (thousand one, hundred-thousand two, etc.) as statistical data about success rates, approaching the teaching as a method with measurable outcomes.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numerical specificity triggers quantitative thinking. Modern outcome-oriented consciousness seeks measurable results.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching is approached as a technique with predictable success rates. Faith becomes contingent on statistical validation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Comparison and competition develop around numbers liberated. The reader measures success by external metrics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The ineffable dimension of recognition is lost in quantification.
