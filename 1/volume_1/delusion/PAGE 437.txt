[MANIFESTATION ERROR] [LIGHT ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18570-18606 describe "wisdom-pervading objects" (yul la khyab pa'i ye shes) as "inner light rays" (nang gi zer) and their external projection as "appearances of wisdom"—with five colors, like sun, firefly, butter lamp, moon, and stars. The reader sees this as describing actual visual phenomena or metaphysical optics.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed phenomenology of light—colors, sources, characteristics—resembles descriptions of visionary experiences. Technical terms like "light rays" (zer), "projection" ('phro ba), "clarity" (gsal ba) suggest physical or energetic phenomena.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical nature of light imagery is completely missed. What describes the clarity, luminosity, and cognizance aspects of awareness becomes literalized as actual visual phenomena to be experienced.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek light experiences, interpret visions as wisdom-appearances, or become attached to specific visual phenomena. The natural clarity of ordinary awareness is overlooked.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [VISION ERROR] where experiences are reified as signs, [CHASING LIGHT ERROR] where specific phenomena become goals, [COLOR ERROR] where five colors are sought, and [LUMINOSITY FIXATION] where brightness is pursued.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [TECHNIQUE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18584-18606 mention specific practices: "wisdom arises from the eyes," "gazing upward," "turning the eyeballs upward," "sun and moon union," "gazing at space." The reader reduces Dzogchen to these physical techniques.

WHY IT ARISES:
The concrete instructions resemble yoga or physical practice. The technical detail suggests these are the actual methods.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is reduced to physical technique. The understanding that these are merely supports for those who need them is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may obsess over proper technique, creating new forms of grasping. The effortless nature of recognition is obscured by effort to "do it correctly."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TECHNIQUE FIXATION ERROR] where method replaces recognition, [CORRECT PERFORMANCE ERROR] where doing it "right" becomes goal, and [PHYSICALISM ERROR] where practice is reduced to body.

[UPWARD GAZE ERROR] [DIRECTION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18589-18596 describe "gazing upward," "turning the eyeballs upward toward the brows," "gazing at space." The reader understands these spatial directions as essential to the practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific directional language suggests precise technique. Spatial orientation feels concrete and doable.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The directional gaze is literalized as necessary for realization. The metaphorical function—interrupting ordinary perception—is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may develop fixation on upward gaze, believing it essential. Physical strain or headache may develop.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [DIRECTION FIXATION] where spatial orientation is grasped, [POSTURE ERROR] where body position becomes essential, and [STRAIN ERROR] where physical effort increases.

[FIVE COLOR ERROR] [PHENOMENAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18596-18606 describe five colors (white, blue, yellow, red, green) as manifestations of wisdom. The reader literalizes these as actual visual phenomena to be seen.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specificity of five colors suggests precise phenomenology. The association of colors with wisdom elements appears systematic.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The colors are objectified as real manifestations. Practitioners may seek to see these colors in meditation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Color experiences are interpreted as signs of wisdom. Ordinary visual perception is devalued.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [COLOR FIXATION] where specific hues are sought, [PHENOMENAL ERROR] where appearances are reified, and [INTERPRETATION ERROR] where visions are analyzed.

---

[SUN MOON ERROR] [UNION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18589-18590 mention "sun and moon union" (nyi zla kha sbyor). The reader understands this as describing an actual practice or metaphysical state.

WHY IT ARISES:
The sun-moon symbolism is powerful and ubiquitous in tantra. "Union" suggests special integration.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Sun-moon union is literalized as technique or goal. The understanding that this points to non-dual recognition is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek sun-moon experiences or believe this describes subtle body physiology.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SYMBOL LITERALISM] where metaphors are techniques, [ENERGETIC ERROR] where subtle body is manipulated, and [GOAL ORIENTATION] where union is pursued.
