[ENUMERATION ERROR] [PROLIFERATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18465-18495: The five wisdoms are each divided into five, making twenty-five wisdoms. This detailed enumeration might suggest wisdom is actually multiple rather than singular.

WHY IT ARISES:
The mathematical precision (5 × 5 = 25) suggests systematic knowledge. The thoroughness of enumeration implies comprehensiveness and accuracy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single essence of wisdom is obscured by its multiple descriptions. What is one recognition appearing in various contexts appears as twenty-five different things to understand.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may feel overwhelmed by the complexity or conversely may collect knowledge about the twenty-five as spiritual accomplishment. The simple fact of recognition is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [COMPLEXITY ERROR] where the path appears unnecessarily complicated, and [CATALOGING ERROR] where wisdom-knowledge replaces wisdom-recognition.

[EXPANSE ERROR] [SPACE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18496-18511: Dharmadhatu wisdom is described with spatial metaphors: "vast expanse of dharmadhatu," "great expanse of clear light," "dharmadhatu of outer and inner." One might reify dharmadhatu as a container or space.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial language (klong, dbyings) naturally suggests extension and containment. Our embodied cognition interprets "expanse" literally as something with dimensions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dharmadhatu is objectified as a vast space or field in which phenomena occur. The non-dual nature of dharmadhatu (neither container nor contained) is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "vastness" or "spaciousness" as experiences of dharmadhatu, confusing altered states with recognition of the nature of all experience.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SPATIAL ERROR] where non-duality is understood geometrically, and [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific sensations become dharmadhatu.
