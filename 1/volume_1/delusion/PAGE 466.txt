[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of support (rten) involving "threefold gathering of function" and "accomplishment through the distant-reaching" is interpreted as claiming that specific supports actually cause or produce realization through their mechanical function.

WHY IT ARISES:
Instrumental reasoning assumes means-end causality. "Support" triggers scaffolding mentality. Western practitioners assume that if something is described as helpful, it must function as causal mechanism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-dependent nature of supports is lost. The practitioner believes supports literally "work" to produce effects. The pointing function of support-description collapses into technological model.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Distant-reaching" (rgyang zhags) becomes tool to use. "Threefold gathering" becomes procedure to execute. The practitioner instrumentalizes all supports, treating dzogchen as technology.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding supports as recognition-contexts rather than causal instruments, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in mechanical soteriology. They may obsess over "correct" supports, believing inferior materials compromise realization. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all pedagogical aids are reified as necessary conditions.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of "karma and habitual patterns being burned" (las dang bag chags dag byed) and "samsara being emptied from within" ('khor ba dong sprugs) is interpreted as literal claim that practice literally destroys karma or physically removes samsara.

WHY IT ARISES:
Literal interpretation of energetic language is default mode. "Burned" triggers destruction imagery. Western practitioners assume technical descriptions of purification describe actual elimination processes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-nature of purification is lost. The practitioner believes karma is literally burned up or samsara literally evacuated. The metaphorical function of "burning" collapses into incineration fantasy.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Habitual patterns" become enemy to destroy. "Samsara" becomes location to empty. The practitioner literalizes all purification language, developing spiritual militarism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding purification as recognition-reframing, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in literal karma-destruction. They may seek dramatic experiences of "burning," believing intensity equals efficacy. The [REIFICATION ERROR] spreads—all energetic descriptions become ontological claims. Recognition is replaced by experience-seeking.
