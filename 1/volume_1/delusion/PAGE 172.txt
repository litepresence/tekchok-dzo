[QUALIFICATION ERROR] [MERIT CHECKLIST ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader treats the list of student qualities ("faith power and effort great, wisdom great and attachment without") as a checklist to be completed before practice, creating anxiety about qualification.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumerated qualities trigger achievement-oriented thinking. The mind habitually creates prerequisites.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice is deferred until all qualities are perfected. The present opportunity is doubted.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Self-improvement projects displace direct recognition. The reader pursues qualities rather than nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that recognition is available regardless of qualities is entirely missed.

[VESSEL ERROR] [CONTAINER ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the metaphor of unsuitable vessels ("lion milk clay vessel-in hold not possible") as establishing that certain people inherently cannot receive the teaching, justifying exclusion and elitism.

WHY IT ARISES:
The vessel metaphor triggers essentialist thinking about capacity. The desire for purity supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
People are categorized as suitable or unsuitable based on judgments about their nature. Discrimination is validated.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching that all beings have buddha-nature is contradicted. Eternalism about capacity develops.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The bodhisattva vow is entirely abandoned in favor of serving only the worthy.

[SECRECY ERROR] [ESOTERICISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the instruction not to teach "vessel bad common-to" as establishing Dzogchen as an esoteric secret for the elite, fostering spiritual exclusivity and intrigue.

WHY IT ARISES:
The secrecy language triggers esoteric fascination. The desire for special knowledge supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching is hoarded rather than shared. Spiritual elitism develops.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The bodhisattva vow to liberate all beings is violated. The teaching becomes a commodity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The universal availability of dharma is entirely obscured.
