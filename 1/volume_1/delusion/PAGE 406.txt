[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Taking "rig pa'i sgron ma" (lamp of awareness) as a metaphor for an actual illuminating presence or entity called "awareness" that functions like a lamp.

WHY IT ARISES:
The metaphor "lamp" naturally suggests an illuminating object. Students personify awareness as something that "lights up" experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness is reified as a thing with the function of illumination, missing that awareness and appearance are inseparable, not agent and object.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students search for "the aware part" of their experience, creating a subtle duality between the "awareness" and what it illuminates.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of awareness, then to ETERNALISTIC view of truly existent consciousness, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of awareness vs. appearance.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding the detailed technical vocabulary ("srog sgron, shes sgron, rtsa sgron, thig le sgron") as referring to distinct esoteric techniques requiring precise execution.

WHY IT ARISES:
Specialized terminology suggests specialized knowledge. The scholarly mind assumes these are technical terms for advanced practices.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The simple recognition of natural mind is buried under technical complexity. Students feel they need to master vocabulary before they can practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes academic study of terminology. Teachers compete to display mastery of technical language.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through endless commentary, then to PEDAGOGICAL focus on terminology over recognition, and finally to MEDITATIONISM of technique obsession.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "goms tshul" (manner of habituation) as instructions for how to deliberately train or condition the mind through repeated practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Goms" (habituate) suggests training or conditioning. Students understand this as behavioral conditioning to create new habits.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural recognition is replaced by deliberate conditioning. Students think they must "practice until it becomes automatic."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes mechanical repetition. The spontaneous nature of realization is obscured by effortful training.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of repetitive technique, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as behavioral modification, and finally to PRACTICE burnout from excessive repetition.

[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "sgron ma 'bar ba" (blazing lamp) as a state of heightened intensity or peak experience that one should cultivate.

WHY IT ARISES:
"'Bar ba" (blaze/burn) suggests intensity and power. Students seek dramatic experiences that feel "blazing."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ordinary nature of mind is rejected in favor of seeking intense experiences. Students mistake intensity for profundity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes excitement-seeking. Natural calm is seen as inferior to dramatic visions or intense clarity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of intensity-seeking, then to REIFICATION of "blazing" as truly existent state, and finally to PRACTICE collapse when intensity fades.
