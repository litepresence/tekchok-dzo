[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed instructions for rubbing, pressing, and channel manipulation are interpreted as a graduated training regimen—physical techniques to be practiced systematically to achieve wisdom and extend life.

WHY IT ARISES:
Prescriptive language (*བྱེད་, *བསྐྱེད་, *སྡུད་) triggers procedural reading. "Essential point" (*གནད་) sounds like crucial technique. Health benefits (*ཚེ་ཉིད་སྤེལ་) attract wellness-oriented practitioners.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen degrades into longevity yoga (*ཚེ་སྒྲུབ་) and subtle-body fitness. The direct recognition of rigpa is lost in physical technique. "Wisdom path" (*ཡེ་ཤེས་ལམ་) becomes somatic achievement rather than recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Bindus with body (*ཐིག་ལེ་སྐུ་དང་བཅས་པ་) are treated as something to manufacture through technique. Wind as "going and coming" (*འགྲོ་འོང་) is controlled rather than recognized as spontaneous display. Mind becomes servant of body-practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where physical vitality becomes spiritual progress marker. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows as these practices are equated with āyurveda or qigong. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of the eye as gate (*སྒོ་) and the channel-root with five branches is interpreted as literal physiological claim—that wisdom actually exits through physical eyes, and thodgal visions are literally seen through ocular apparatus.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical precision triggers literal reading. "Gate" suggests physical portal. Western visual culture interprets thodgal as "seeing with eyes" rather than non-dual display of awareness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal is reduced to visual phenomenon—external light experiences interpreted as wisdom-display. The non-dual nature of rigpa's self-display (*རང་སྣང་) is lost. "Looking without moving" (*མི་འགུལ་བར་བལྟ་) becomes physical fixation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The "true essential point" (*ཡང་དག་གནད་) is sought in visual field manipulation. "Direct perception" (*མངོན་སུམ་) is interpreted as sensory experience. The distinction between ordinary seeing and wisdom-display collapses.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR]—staring at skies, forcing visions, seeking light-experiences. [EPISTEMIC ERROR] follows as students cannot distinguish recognition from sensation. [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] proliferates.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The explanation of gate and lamp is interpreted through tantric or sutric frameworks—understanding them as faculties to be purified or developed through practice, rather than naturally abiding display of already-perfect rigpa.

WHY IT ARISES:
Familiarity with lower yanas causes projection onto Dzogchen. "Gate" and "lamp" terminology overlaps with tantra. Practitioners unconsciously apply gradualist hermeneutics to Atiyoga.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen view collapses into path-based framework. The four lamps become objects of cultivation; the gate becomes something to purify. Natural self-arising is replaced by developmental achievement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Wisdom actually arising" (*ཡེ་ཤེས་དངོས་འབྱུང་) is interpreted as produced through practice. "Self-essential point" (*རང་གནད་) becomes technique-result. The spontaneity (*ལྷུན་གྲུབ་) of display is undermined.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] leads to [PRACTICE ERROR] where Dzogchen is practiced as advanced tantra. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as gradual curricula are imposed. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] proliferates when texts are read through lower-yana lenses.
