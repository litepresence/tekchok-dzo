[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL ESSENCE HYPOSTATIZATION]

MISREADING:
The channels have fixed essences (ngo bo): Roma is bliss, Kyangma is emptiness, Kundarma is their union.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14172-14176: "ro ma'i ngo bo bde ba...rkyang ma'i ngo bo stong pa...kun 'dar ma'i ngo bo bde stong gnyis su med pa" (Roma's essence is bliss, Kyangma's essence is emptiness, Kundarma's essence is bliss-emptiness non-dual).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing emptiness and bliss as properties possessed by channels.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Searching for these essences within the channels.
Missing that channels ARE emptiness-bliss, not containers of them.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ESSENTIALISM ERROR]

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [METHOD-WISDOM DICHOTOMY]

MISREADING:
Method (thabs) and wisdom (shes rab) are two separate things that need to be united.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14098-14099: "g.yas pas thabs mtshon g.yon pas shes rab mtshon" (right indicates method, left indicates wisdom).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thinking method and wisdom are different entities to combine.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Cultivating one at the expense of the other.
Missing that they have never been separate.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DICHOTOMOUS PRACTICE ERROR]

[PRACTICE ERROR] [CHANNEL POINT MASTERY OBSESSION]

MISREADING:
One must become skilled at "channel points" (gnad) to manipulate the channels effectively.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14194-14198: "ro ma'i gnad la mkhas na...rkyang mas...dbu mas" (skilled at Roma's point...Kyangma...middle).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing gnad as techniques to master.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Accumulating techniques rather than recognizing nature.
Missing that gnad is the natural state itself.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TECHNIQUE ACCUMULATION ERROR]
