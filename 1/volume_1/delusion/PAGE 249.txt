[VISUALIZATION ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets mandala descriptions as establishing external divine palaces to be visualized, literalizing symbolic architecture.

WHY IT ARISES:
The architectural imagery triggers spatial-construction thinking. Vivid visualization instructions support this.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The mandala becomes an objectified external realm rather than the structure of awareness itself.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Visualization practice degenerates into creating mental pictures rather than recognizing nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle that the mandala is one's own mind is entirely missed.
