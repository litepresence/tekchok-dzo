[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Abandoning the killing of life through the body door" (sku yi sgo nas srog gcod spang bar bya) and other samayas are interpreted as ordinary ethical precepts—the ten virtues applied conventionally without transformation through wisdom view.

WHY IT ARISES:
Ethical literalism from Western moral frameworks dominates interpretation. "Abandon killing" triggers conventional morality. Practitioners miss that these samayas are practiced within pure perception view, not as ordinary ethics.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samaya collapses into moralism. The practitioner develops spiritual righteousness, judging others by conventional standards while claiming tantric view. The radical recontextualization of ethics within emptiness and pure perception is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Alternatively, "realizing means and wisdom as non-separate" (thabs dang shes rab 'du 'bral med par rtogs) is used to justify unethical behavior—claiming view transcends morality while actually indulging ordinary desire. This produces [NIHILISTIC ERROR]—using emptiness to license harm.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without proper samaya foundation, the entire structure of Mahāyoga collapses. The practitioner either becomes rigid moralist (missing wisdom) or libertine nihilist (missing compassion). Both are [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] in different forms—reifying either conventional morality or transgressive freedom as absolute. Authentic vajra conduct (rdo rje spyod pa) becomes impossible.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual" (dbyings dang ye shes gnyis su med pa) is interpreted as fusion of subject and object—achieving a mystical union of observer and observed, perceiver and perceived.

WHY IT ARISES:
Mystical union theology from various traditions projects onto Dzogchen. "Non-dual" triggers unification imagery. Western practitioners seek experiences of oneness, oceanic feeling, or boundary dissolution.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The dbyings-ye shes distinction collapses into monistic fusion. The practitioner pursues oceanic mystical experiences as the goal. The critical point—that expanse is emptiness and wisdom is knowing, never separate yet never identical—is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Completion stage" (rdzogs rim) is understood as stage after generation stage rather than simultaneous aspect. The practitioner believes they must "graduate" from deity yoga to formless meditation, creating developmental hierarchy. Anuyoga becomes "higher" than Mahāyoga rather than complementary.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding the non-duality of expanse and wisdom, the four visions of thögal cannot be properly related to trekchö. The practitioner may develop [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]—pursuing completion stage experiences while neglecting the view that makes them meaningful. Or they may fall into [NIHILISTIC ERROR]—believing that because expanse and wisdom are non-dual, there is nothing to practice.
