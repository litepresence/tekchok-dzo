[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The elaborate distinctions between liberation ground ka-dag and practice-time ka-dag, or between rigpa expanding without interruption versus mere empty display, are interpreted as claims that there are actually different types or levels of purity with different essences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Typological thinking categorizes by property-differences. "Difference" triggers essentialist associations. Western practitioners assume distinctions present ontological variations.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single-nature of all ka-dag is obscured by categorical distinctions. The practitioner believes there are "better" and "worse" purities. The pointing function of distinction collapses into hierarchical ontology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Liberation ground" becomes exclusive state. "Present" ka-dag becomes deficient. The practitioner chases "better" recognition while missing present nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding distinctions as pedagogical tools rather than ontological claims, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in recognition-grades. They may prematurely claim advanced status or despair at "inferior" recognition. The [EPISTEMIC ERROR] spreads—all technical language is essentialized. Recognition is replaced by status-comparison.
