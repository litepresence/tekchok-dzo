[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [NIHILISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Conceptual-elaboration's word from beyond" and "confidence cord cut" justify rejection of all language, study, and conceptual understanding as obstacles to dharmatā.

WHY IT ARISES:
The negation of words and cutting of confidence-cord appears to dismiss all conceptual engagement and learned certainty.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Anti-intellectualism and rejection of study. The practitioner believes words prevent realization and must be abandoned.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Inability to navigate teachings conceptually. Vulnerability to wrong views. Loss of discriminative wisdom.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Conceptual nihilism → susceptibility to charlatans → adoption of wrong views → corrupted practice.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Ear continuum" refers to a continuous transmission through hearing that connects practitioner to source, creating a lineage-continuum that must be maintained.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "continuum" suggests something to be preserved. The emphasis on "ear" and "connection" implies a transmission line.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Lineage is reified as a substance passed through hearing. The practitioner fixates on receiving and maintaining this continuum.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Obsession with lineage purity. Elitism about direct hearing. Anxiety about broken transmission.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Lineage fundamentalism → sectarianism → rejection of other lineages → spiritual pride.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Letter non-existent ear continuum dharmatā meaning's instruction" and "light clear stain non-existent" establish a pure dharmatā that is always present beneath the obscuring letters, like clear light behind clouds.

WHY IT ARISES:
The contrast between non-existent letters and dharmatā meaning suggests hidden reality. Light/clear/stain language implies something covered.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dharmatā is substantialized as a pure reality obscured by conventional appearance. The practitioner seeks to access this hidden light.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Hidden-reality view. Eternalist fixation on clear light. Meditation as uncovering.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Light-fixation → energetic imbalance → rejection of thought → spiritual bypassing.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The four cycles (outer, inner, secret, secret-above) represent a curriculum of progressively advanced teachings that must be mastered sequentially.

WHY IT ARISES:
The enumeration (four) and hierarchy (outer to secret-above) suggests levels of access. The terminology invites scholastic organization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a hierarchical system of initiations. The practitioner seeks to gain access to higher cycles as status symbols.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Esoteric elitism. Commercialization of higher cycles. Comparison by "cycle-level."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Hierarchy obsession → spiritual materialism → guru shopping for higher cycles → exploitation.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Poison five path vehicle abiding" and "whatever appearing dharmatā arise" describe specific meditative accomplishments where poisons transform into wisdom and appearances become dharmatā.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of abiding and arising suggests meditative states. The transformation of poison implies alchemical achievement.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes alchemical meditation where afflictions are transformed into wisdom through technique.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fixation on transformation experiences. Spiritual materialism about "transmuted" states. Pride in handling poison.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Alchemical fixation → dangerous experimentation → psychological disturbance → institutional intervention.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The similes (root like solid, trunk like twisted, flower like clear, fruit like ripened) describe actual stages of spiritual development with distinct characteristics.

WHY IT ARISES:
The botanical metaphors suggest organic growth. The progression from root to fruit implies development.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Spiritual development is understood as organic maturation through stages. The practitioner expects to "ripen" over time.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Waiting for ripening. Disappointment with lack of progress. Comparison with others' "ripeness."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Developmental fixation → gradualism → future orientation → failure to recognize present nature.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Pointing-out," "realization attained," and "buddha and compassion arising" describe progressive achievements that depend on hearing, contemplation, meditation, effort, and accumulation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The causal language ("because from") suggests dependencies. The enumeration of factors implies requirements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition becomes dependent on causes and conditions rather than self-liberated nature. The practitioner accumulates prerequisites.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual accounting of causes. Merit accumulation obsession. Gradualist dependency.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Causal fixation → merit accumulation → commercial transactions → commodification of Dharma.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Secret above non-existent cycle" refers to a supreme, ineffable teaching beyond all other cycles that contains the ultimate truth.

WHY IT ARISES:
The superlative "above" suggests hierarchy. The negation "non-existent" paradoxically implies something higher.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The highest teaching is reified as a secret beyond secrets. The practitioner seeks this supreme cycle as the final answer.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Endless seeking for higher teachings. Rejection of accessible instructions. Guru shopping for "secret above."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Esoteric obsession → vulnerability to charlatans → financial exploitation → disillusionment.
