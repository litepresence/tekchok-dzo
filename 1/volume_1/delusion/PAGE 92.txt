[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The five Buddha families (sku, gsung, thugs, yon tan, 'phrin las) are mapped onto five aspects of psychological personality—using deity yoga as archetypal therapy to integrate fragmented self-parts through identification with different family traits.

WHY IT ARISES:
Jungian psychology's five-fold typology (thinking, feeling, sensation, intuition, plus transcendental function) provides ready mapping. Western psychological frameworks privilege integration and wholeness. Deity families invite typological categorization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Tantra collapses into depth psychology. The families become personality types rather than wisdom displays. Practitioners take quizzes to determine "their" Buddha family rather than recognizing all five as simultaneous aspects of display. The path becomes self-improvement rather than self-liberation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Accomplishing through three concentrations without duality" becomes guided visualization therapy—achieving inner harmony through symbolic work. The radical claim that "ordinary self IS Buddha" is domesticated into "wounded self can heal toward Buddha-like wholeness."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without recognition of empty nature, deity identification becomes inflationary. The practitioner develops spiritual narcissism believing they "are" Mañjuśrī or Amitābha. This produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—reifying the self as divine while maintaining ordinary ego underneath. Ethical violations follow from "I am beyond good and evil" justification.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The various traditions (thor bu ba, phra mo, dra ba) are treated as equivalent options in a spiritual marketplace—practitioners may pick and choose elements from different systems based on personal preference and resonance.

WHY IT ARISES:
Consumer choice ideology and spiritual pluralism dominate Western religion. The mention of "many traditions" triggers relativism. Practitioners conflate "gathered in two: tantra and upadeśa" with "equally valid alternatives."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Lineage integrity collapses. The practitioner creates Frankenstein practice combining incompatible elements. Without understanding the logical structure of each system, they mix generation-stage dominant and completion-stage dominant approaches randomly, producing confusion rather than integration.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Incomplete traditions" (ma rdzogs su 'dod pa) are pursued as "easier" paths. The practitioner avoids completion stage requirements while claiming the view. This produces [PRACTICE ERROR]—doing generation stage with completion stage rhetoric, creating cognitive dissonance and subtle hypocrisy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Unable to distinguish genuine from counterfeit, the practitioner falls prey to [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]—accepting any teacher claiming Dzogchen authenticity. Without grounding in systematic understanding, they cannot evaluate claims. The result is guru-shopping and lineage-hopping without ever stabilizing view.
