ERROR TYPE 1: [PRACTICE ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
The mahayoga_anuyoga presentation is understood as establishing fixed ontological categories rather than pedagogical skillful means.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]

WHY IT ARISES:
Fundamentalist tendencies seek certainty. Scriptural literalism is common in religious traditions.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Citations become weapons in debate. Living recognition is subordinated to textual authority.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Sectarianism develops. 'Buddha said so' ends inquiry.

================================================================================
