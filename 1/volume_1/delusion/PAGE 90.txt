[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The three inner tantras (Mahāyoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga) are understood as a linear hierarchy—Atiyoga is "best" because it comes last, and Mahāyoga is "inferior" preliminary practice to be transcended and left behind.

WHY IT ARISES:
Evolutionary thinking and progressive developmental models dominate Western education. The numbered list (seventh, eighth, ninth vehicles) triggers temporal sequencing. "Higher" and "lower" are mapped onto superiority/inferiority rather than different methods for different capacities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration of the three collapses into chronological supersession. Practitioners rush to Atiyoga without stabilizing Mahāyoga foundation, creating "premature Dzogchen" syndrome. The rich deity yoga practices of Mahāyoga are dismissed as "mere method" while the practitioner lacks capacity for formless meditation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Lineage loyalty dissolves as practitioners shop for "highest teachings." Teachers of generation stage are devalued. The practitioner develops spiritual snobbery, claiming to be "beyond" practices they never properly engaged. Result is dilletantism across all three vehicles.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without proper grounding, Anuyoga's completion stage practices become conceptual abstraction rather than embodied realization. Atiyoga instructions are intellectually parroted without recognition. The practitioner develops [EPISTEMIC ERROR]—believing understanding the description equals having the realization.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Liberation attained in one life" (tshe gcig gis grol ba thob pa) is interpreted as guaranteed salvation through affiliation—receiving these teachings ensures awakening in this lifetime regardless of practice quality or capacity.

WHY IT ARISES:
Salvation theology from Abrahamic traditions projects onto Vajrayana. The promise of "this life" triggers consumerist expectation of quick results. Western practitioners conflate "possible" with "automatic" and "available" with "achieved."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The path becomes casualized. Without urgency born of death-awareness, practice becomes hobby. The practitioner collects empowerments as certificates of guaranteed future awakening, missing that "one life" requires total commitment comparable to milarepa's exertion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Reaching Vajradhara's level in this life" becomes aspirational fantasy rather than terrifying possibility requiring everything. The practitioner maintains ordinary life while claiming secret mantra practice. Cognitive dissonance produces either guilt or spiritual bypassing.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The etymology "slight effort, great purpose" (tshegs chung ngu'i thabs kyis don chen po 'grub pa) is misread as "easy path." This produces [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]—seeking the teaching that requires least change. The practitioner becomes spiritual consumer, evaluating traditions by convenience rather than transformative potential.
