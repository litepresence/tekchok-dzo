[MEDITATIONISM, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking the precise anatomical instructions ("sna rtse las smin mtshams kyi yar mtshams") as literal physical directions for where to place attention, rather than metaphorical descriptions of inner vision.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed spatial language (nose tip, eyebrow center, four finger-widths) suggests a physical technique. Students want concrete instructions they can follow.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes fixated on physical posture and precise measurements, turning the profound into mechanical technique. The inner vision is reduced to eye exercises.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students strain their eyes, develop headaches, or become obsessed with correct "position." The natural arising of inner light is suppressed by forced concentration.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between physical and visionary, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of techniques over recognition, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through physical strain.

[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "longs sku" (enjoyment body) as an actual form or body that appears to the practitioner during meditation, a truly existent vision.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Sku" (body) naturally refers to physical form. The term "longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku" (complete enjoyment body) suggests something tangible and beautiful that one experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The illusory nature of visionary appearance is missed. Students report "seeing deities" as if these were objectively present, reifying the kayas.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism enters practice. Visions are sought after, compared, and boasted about. The empty nature of all appearance is forgotten.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to REIFICATION of visionary experiences, then to ETERNALISTIC view of truly existent kayas, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL harm as teachers validate students' visions.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Taking the detailed numerical correspondences ("skad cig ma ni bcu drug la" - sixteen moments) as precise temporal measurements for calculating meditation progress.

WHY IT ARISES:
Numbers suggest quantifiable precision. Students want measurable progress markers. The scholarly mind latches onto numerical systems.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching is reduced to a mathematical system. Students try to calculate their progress: "I've completed 12 of 16 moments." Recognition is replaced by accounting.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes rigid and formulaic. The spontaneous nature of realization is constrained by numerical expectations.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of structured technique, then to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through endless analysis of numerical systems, and finally to PRACTICE collapse when reality doesn't match calculations.

Lines 00050-00052
[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "lus zad pa'i sar phyin" (reaching the place of body's exhaustion) as meaning the physical body literally dissolves or disappears.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Zad pa" (exhaustion/cessation) suggests something ending. Combined with "lus" (body), this naturally suggests physical dissolution or death.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Students may develop fear of physical death or, conversely, desire for out-of-body experiences. The metaphorical meaning (exhaustion of fixation on body) is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dangerous practices may be attempted. The integration of realization with embodied existence is disrupted.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC view of body as obstacle, then to PRACTICE of dissociative techniques, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of mind vs. body.
