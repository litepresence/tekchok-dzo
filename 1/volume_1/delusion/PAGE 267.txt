[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text continues the negation: no path, no non-path, no result, no abandonment, no attainment. A reader might think: "This means there's nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing to achieve. All spiritual paths are equal and equally empty."

WHY IT ARISES:
We want relief from the pressure of spiritual practice. The idea that "there's nothing to do" is liberating - no more striving, no more goals. This appeals to exhaustion and spiritual burnout.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner concludes that all paths are empty, therefore any path is fine, or no path is needed. This becomes a spiritual relativism where nothing matters and practice is arbitrary.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Relativistic dismissal of practice distinctions
2. "Whatever works for you" spirituality
3. Avoiding commitment to any path
4. Missing that emptiness doesn't negate functionality

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to NIHILISTIC ERROR (nothing matters) → PRACTICE ERROR (arbitrary practice) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching emptiness as license). The practitioner becomes spiritually undisciplined.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text calls this "the great expanse of rigpa." A reader might think: "So this is rigpa - the great expanse, vast and unlimited. Rigpa is the primordially pure base, the ultimate nature of mind."

WHY IT ARISES:
Rigpa is a key term in Dzogchen, and we naturally want to understand what it is. "Great expanse" suggests something vast and all-encompassing. We reify rigpa as the ultimate reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Rigpa becomes reified as the ultimate ground of being, the great expanse, the true nature. The practitioner seeks to "abide in rigpa" as if it were a place or state.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying rigpa as the ultimate reality
2. Seeking to "enter" or "abide in" rigpa
3. Creating dualism: rigpa vs everything else
4. Missing that rigpa is a verb, not a noun

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates REIFICATION ERROR (rigpa as entity) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking rigpa states) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (rigpa metaphysics). The practitioner chases rigpa.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes the "Mu tig phreng ba" tantra with another extensive list of negations. A reader might think: "This tantra gives the complete list of what doesn't exist. Combined with other sources, I can build the comprehensive map of emptiness."

WHY IT ARISES:
We love comprehensive lists and complete systems. Multiple sources with similar negations suggest we're building a complete picture. Scholarly accumulation feels like progress toward understanding.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner collects negations from various sources, building a comprehensive "empty inventory." This becomes scholarly expertise - knowing all the things that don't exist in the base.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Compiling exhaustive lists of negations
2. Comparing sources to build complete picture
3. Academic mastery of emptiness catalog
4. Missing that one negation is enough

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (accumulating negations) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (scholarship as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching empty lists). The tradition becomes negation cataloging.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, Nihilistic ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text negates elements, aggregates, sense fields, objects, perceivers - all components of experience. A reader might think: "This shows that experience itself is empty. All of reality is a fiction, a construction with no basis."

WHY IT ARISES:
Deconstructing experience into emptiness can feel liberating - nothing is real, so nothing matters. This appeals to those burdened by life's weight. But it easily slides into nihilistic denial.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner denies the reality of all experience. Everything becomes "mere appearance," "just concepts," "empty constructs." This is existential denial dressed as wisdom.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Denial of the validity of all experience
2. Disengagement from life as "empty"
3. Using emptiness to avoid dealing with reality
4. Missing that emptiness is fullness, not absence

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates NIHILISTIC ERROR (denying all experience) → PRACTICE ERROR (withdrawal from life) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (avoidance). The practitioner becomes a world-denier.
