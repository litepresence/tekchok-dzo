[CONCEPTUAL ERROR] [THOUGHT ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18254-18261: The text identifies conceptual thought (rnam rtog) as "great ignorance" and "the cause of falling into the ocean of samsara." One might conclude that thoughts themselves are the problem.

WHY IT ARISES:
The strong language ("great ignorance," "falling into the ocean") suggests thoughts are dangerous enemies. The natural antipathy toward disturbing thoughts reinforces this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The nature of thought is missed. What is actually the display of awareness appearing as thought is rejected, creating aversion to the very nature of mind.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to stop thinking, creating suppression and quietism. The recognition that thoughts are naturally liberated (rtog pa rang grol) is lost in the effort to eliminate them.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [THOUGHT SUPPRESSION ERROR] where mental quiet is mistaken for realization, and [Aversion ERROR] where judgment of thoughts creates new dualism.

[DEFINITIONAL ERROR] [ETYMOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18263-18269: The text provides formal definitions of primordial wisdom (ye shes): "not conceptuality," "self-clear essence," "threefold purity," "meaning abiding from the beginning." One might treat these as technical definitions to be mastered.

WHY IT ARISES:
The definitional format (nges tshig) and fourfold structure resemble academic definitions. Precision of terminology suggests that knowing definitions equals understanding.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is replaced by definitional knowledge. One can recite the four aspects of wisdom without recognizing the wisdom that is always present.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual mastery creates false confidence. Practitioners debate definitions while missing the pointing function of the words.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCHOLASTIC ERROR] where understanding concepts substitutes for recognition, and [DEFINITIONAL DEBATE ERROR] where terminological precision becomes spiritual accomplishment.
