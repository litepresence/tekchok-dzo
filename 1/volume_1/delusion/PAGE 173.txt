[GURU TRANSACTION ERROR] [EXCHANGE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the description of guru-disciple relationship involving offerings and service ("kingdom and own body by-means-of serve") as establishing a transactional economy of exchange, commodifying the transmission.

WHY IT ARISES:
The economic language (serve, offer, accumulation) triggers transactional thinking. Market consciousness supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The guru relationship becomes a commercial transaction. Spiritual materialism develops.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The sacred dimension of transmission is lost in commodification. Exploitation becomes possible.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching is bought and sold rather than transmitted heart-to-heart.

[WAITING ERROR] [DEFERRAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the instruction to request empowerment "year five or seven or three etcetera before-from" as establishing mandatory waiting periods, creating unnecessary obstacles to practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The time specifications trigger deferral mentality. The mind habitually creates delays.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice is postponed for arbitrary periods. Urgency is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching's immediacy is forgotten. The reader waits rather than recognizes.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that buddhahood is available now is entirely missed.

[CONTEMPLATION OBSESSION ERROR] [TECHNIQUE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the instruction to "contemplate-from day night six time" as establishing mandatory ritual contemplation schedules, externalizing practice into observance.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific numbers (six times) trigger ritualistic thinking. The need for clear practice guidelines supports this.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural recognition of mind is replaced by scheduled practice sessions. Spontaneity is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Anxiety about correct performance replaces confidence. The reader focuses on doing it right.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The effortless nature of recognition is entirely forgotten.
