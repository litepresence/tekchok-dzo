ERROR TYPE 1: [APPEARANCE DENIAL NIHILISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The teaching that all phenomena are "like illusions and dreams" (sgyu ma dang rmi lam ltar) and "unestablished as real" (don du snang ba nyid nas ma grub) is interpreted as a denial that appearances exist at all—as if the practitioner should perceive nothing, experience nothing, and regard the world as a non-existent void.

WHY IT ARISES:
Nihilistic tendencies interpret "unreal" as "non-existent." The practitioner conflates "empty of inherent existence" with "total non-existence." The dream and illusion metaphors are taken literally as claims that reality is fake rather than pointers to empty-display nature.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner denies the validity of all experience. The world is dismissed as "just illusion" and therefore unworthy of engagement. The natural responsiveness of compassion is blocked by the belief that nothing and no one truly exists.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual bypassing develops. The practitioner uses "it's all illusion" to avoid dealing with real suffering—others' and their own. Ethical conduct becomes meaningless because "no one exists to benefit." The practitioner becomes cold and disconnected.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [SUTRA DISMISSAL] where conventional practice is rejected as "mere illusion." It generates [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where the practitioner denies karma and causality while lacking realization of emptiness, creating the most dangerous combination—ordinary ego with nihilistic view.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 2: [AFFLICTION ENUMERATION OBSESSION] [PRACTICE ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The detailed enumeration of 84,000 afflictions—breaking down into 21,000 each from desire, anger, ignorance, and their combinations—is interpreted as establishing that liberation requires eliminating each and every affliction through specific countermeasures, like solving 84,000 separate problems.

WHY IT ARISES:
Analytical mind seeks comprehensive catalogs. The practitioner assumes detailed enumeration implies detailed elimination is required. Western psychology treats each mental state as requiring specific intervention. The sheer number creates anxiety that triggers obsessive-compulsive approach.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes an impossible task of eliminating 84,000 afflictions one by one. The practitioner develops spiritual burnout trying to counter every possible mental state. The recognition that all afflictions share the same empty nature is missed in favor of particularistic combat.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner constantly monitors for afflictions to eliminate. Mental states are obsessively categorized. "Is this anger or ignorance-based?" becomes constant preoccupation. Natural ease is replaced by anxious vigilance.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This feeds [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] where the practitioner believes they must eliminate all 84,000 afflictions before genuine practice. It produces [PROGRESSION MYTH] where enlightenment is conceived as the gradual elimination of afflictions over countless eons.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 3: [MIRAGE WATER CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The metaphor of grasping at mirage water (smig rgyu la chur 'khrul pa) and snake in rope (thag pa la sprul 'dzin) is interpreted as establishing that ordinary perception is simply wrong and must be replaced by correct perception, rather than demonstrating the empty nature of all perception including the "correct" one.

WHY IT ARISES:
Correspondence theories of truth assume right vs wrong perception. The practitioner believes the goal is to see "the rope as rope" rather than recognizing that both rope-perception and snake-perception are equally empty. Metaphors of error suggest there is a correct view to achieve.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues "correct perception" as the goal. The empty nature of all perception is missed. Liberation becomes seeing things "as they really are"—a metaphysical realism that contradicts emptiness teachings.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner judges their perception as wrong and seeks right perception. Spiritual materialism develops around "having correct view." The fundamental equality of all appearances in emptiness is lost in favor of hierarchical perception-evaluation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [VIEW COLLAPSE] where the practitioner mistakes their conceptual understanding for direct recognition. It generates [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] where those with "correct perception" are considered superior to those still "confused."

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 4: [ULTIMATE TRUTH FETISHIZATION] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The citation from Pearl Garland Tantra establishing the two truths—conventional appearances and ultimate emptiness—is interpreted as establishing ultimate truth as a higher reality to be accessed, possessed, and inhabited, while conventional truth is dismissed as mere illusion.

WHY IT ARISES:
Hierarchical thinking assumes ultimate = better = goal. The practitioner wants to access the "real" reality behind appearances. Western metaphysics often distinguishes between appearance and reality. The language of "two truths" invites value hierarchy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues ultimate truth as a special state or perception. Conventional reality is devalued and rejected. The integration of two truths—appearance-emptiness inseparability—is never realized. The practitioner becomes trapped in metaphysical abstraction.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Daily life becomes meaningless because "it's just conventional truth." Relationships, work, and engagement are abandoned for pursuit of ultimate truth. The practitioner becomes ungrounded and unable to function, lost in metaphysical speculation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [SUTRA DISMISSAL] where conventional teachings are rejected as "merely conventional." It generates [TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] where the practitioner seeks methods promising direct access to ultimate truth without conventional foundation.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 5: [KARMA MECHANISM REIFICATION] [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The classification of actions into virtuous (meritorious), non-virtuous, and immovable (bsod nams, bsod nams ma yin pa, mi gyo ba) is interpreted as establishing a mechanical karmic system where actions automatically produce specific results like a vending machine, rather than demonstrating how mind's habitual patterns shape experience.

WHY IT ARISES:
Mechanistic causality dominates Western thought. The practitioner assumes karma operates like physical causation. Religious traditions often emphasize reward/punishment systems. The clarity of karmic categories suggests mechanistic operation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Karma becomes a mechanical accounting system. The practitioner attempts to "accumulate merit" like collecting points. The understanding of karma as habitual pattern-creation is lost. Practice becomes transactional—doing good to get good results.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism around merit develops. "How much merit have I accumulated?" becomes constant concern. The practitioner judges others' spiritual status by their apparent karmic results. Authentic generosity is replaced by merit-investment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] where performing actions is believed to mechanically produce enlightenment. It generates [PROGRESSION MYTH] where enlightenment is conceived as the result of accumulating sufficient merit over time.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS
================================================================================

PREVIOUS PAGE (54) CONTEXT:
Page 54 concluded the analysis of faculties and objects, introducing the two-types-of-objects framework. Page 55 transitions to the illusory nature of all phenomena and the detailed enumeration of afflictions, leading into the discussion of karma.

NEXT PAGE (56) ANTICIPATION:
The text will continue the detailed enumeration of the 84,000 afflictions and their causes. This is part of the systematic presentation of samsaric existence that prepares the ground for understanding nirvana and the path vehicles.

CRITICAL CONTINUITY POINT:
The Pearl Garland citation (lines 1844-1863) bridges the analysis of phenomena with the presentation of two truths. The practitioner must not read this as establishing two separate realities but as two perspectives on the same empty display.

BLEED RISK:
Very High. The illusion metaphors invite nihilistic interpretation. The 84,000 afflictions invite obsessive categorization. The two truths presentation invites hierarchical thinking. Multiple high-risk errors converge on this page.
