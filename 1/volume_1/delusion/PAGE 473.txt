[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The appearance-catalog—fragmented, subtle-moving, flickering, round, flaming, dissolving—is interpreted as progressive stages indicating practitioner advancement.

WHY IT ARISES:
Catalog structure triggers developmental thinking. Sequential presentation suggests curriculum. The practitioner wants "advanced" appearances.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The equal-nature of all appearances is lost. "Dissolving appearances" become superior. Elitism emerges around "which appearance-stage one has reached."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Dissolution-experienced" becomes exclusive identity. Fragmented-appearance practitioners are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that appearance-content doesn't matter is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 474-475's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "cataloged" appearances without recognition.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The "measure and time certainty" (tshad dang dus ngas pa) is interpreted as precise phenomenological standards to achieve.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical terminology suggests precision. "Certainty" suggests requirement. The practitioner assumes standards indicate necessities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural recognition is suffocated by standard-matching. The practitioner worries: "Is my measure correct? Is my timing certain?" Conformity-anxiety replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Standard-orthodoxies proliferate. Teachers who validate "correct" measures gain authority. The authentic recognition that measures are pedagogical tools is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Standards are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "measured" without recognition.

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The conditional verses—"when this, then that"—are interpreted as causal laws governing practice-outcomes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Conditional language triggers determinism. "When...then" suggests prediction. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate laws.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured by causal anxiety. The practitioner believes specific conditions produce specific results. Recognition is replaced by condition-manipulation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Condition-anxiety consumes practice. Teachers promising "correct conditions" gain authority. The authentic recognition that recognition is not condition-produced is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 475's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by condition-optimization.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The elaborate appearance-catalog is seen as "near the end" triggering "just get through this" mentality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Density of content creates resistance. Proximity to end creates momentum. The practitioner wants "done."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound appearance-pointing is missed. The practitioner has "read" appearances without recognition. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern. Final sections are skimmed. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "final wrap-up."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 475's completion is not integrated. Arriving at PAGE 479 without absorption, the practitioner misses dedication's power.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "wisdom moving the five elements" is interpreted as special power accessible to advanced practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
Power-language triggers ability-association. "Moving elements" suggests mastery. The practitioner wants elemental-power.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical nature of elemental language is lost. Elemental-mastery becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is insufficient.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Element-mover" becomes exclusive identity. Those without elemental-experiences are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that elements are metaphors is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Elemental distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "moved elements" conceptually.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The appearance-catalog on this page carries to PAGE 475's completion. By PAGE 476's deity yoga comparison, appearance-hierarchy determines evaluation. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with appearance-history.
