[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The elaborate verses describing different appearances (snang ba) at different times—"when appearances are fragmented," "when extremely subtle and moving," etc.—are interpreted as literal phenomenological roadmap with specific experiences to achieve at specific stages.

WHY IT ARISES:
Progressive path frameworks condition stage-achievement thinking. "When...then" triggers conditional logic. Western practitioners assume descriptions of appearance-variations present achievement-standards.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-in-all-appearances nature is lost. The practitioner believes they must progress through specific appearance-types. The pointing function of appearance-catalog collapses into curriculum-checklist.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Fragmented appearances" become stage to complete. "Subtle and moving" become next level. The practitioner evaluates practice by phenomenological achievement, creating appearance-hierarchy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding appearance-variations as recognition-contexts rather than stages, the practitioner develops [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]—experience-accumulation. They may force specific appearances, believing "correct" appearance validates practice. The [PRACTICE ERROR] spreads—all appearance-language becomes technique. Recognition is replaced by phenomenological success-metrics.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of "five elements dissolving into the expanse" (byung ba rnams lnga thim gyur) and "wisdom moving" (ye shes bskyod pa) is interpreted as literal energetic process where physical elements literally transform into wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
Alchemical traditions literalize elemental transformation. "Dissolving" triggers substance-metamorphosis associations. Western practitioners assume elemental language presents ontological claims.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-metaphor nature of elemental language is lost. The practitioner believes their body literally changes into light. The pointing function of elemental description collapses into physical transformation fantasy.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Elements" become substances to transmute. "Dissolving" becomes alchemical process. The practitioner literalizes all subtle-body language, creating materialist mysticism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding elemental descriptions as recognition-pointers, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in literal elemental transformation. They may seek physical signs of "progress," believing bodily sensations validate practice. The [REIFICATION ERROR] spreads—all energetic language becomes ontological claim. Recognition is replaced by somatic achievement.
