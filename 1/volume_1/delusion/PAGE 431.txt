[METAPHORICAL ERROR] [CONCRETIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18194-18195: The famous metaphor "Mind and awareness are like water and waves" (sems dang rig pa'i dpe ni chu dang rlabs bu'i tshul) might be interpreted as describing two related but distinct substances.

WHY IT ARISES:
The water-wave metaphor is familiar and seemingly clear. Our habitual substantialist thinking naturally sees water and waves as ontologically related but distinct.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The radical non-duality of mind and awareness is missed. What is actually the same "substance" appearing differently (through confusion vs. recognition) appears as two things in relationship.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek the "water" beneath the "waves" of mind, as if awareness were a hidden substrate. This subtle dualism perpetuates the very confusion the metaphor aims to dispel.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBSTRATE ERROR] where awareness is sought as underlying reality, and [DISSOLUTION ERROR] where "still water" becomes the goal rather than recognition of the nature of all movement.

[ANATOMICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18196-18233: The detailed description of channels (rtsa), winds (rlung), and their pathways might be taken as literal physiology rather than subtle body (lus) description.

WHY IT ARISES:
The technical terminology (srog rtsa, rtsa chen, etc.) and precise anatomical references suggest scientific accuracy. The traditional medical framework appears descriptive of actual structures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The subtle body is confused with gross anatomy. What functions on the level of energy and mind is literalized as physical structures that could be found in dissection.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to manipulate channels and winds through physical techniques, confusing energetic practice with realization. Health goals may replace liberation aims.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PRANIC FIXATION ERROR] where wind energies become the focus, and [PHYSICALISM ERROR] where subtle body practices are reduced to somatic techniques.
