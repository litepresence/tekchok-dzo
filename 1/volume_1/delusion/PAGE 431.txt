[ADVENTITIOUS ERROR] [CONTAMINATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18243-18253 describe defilements as "adventitious" (glo bur) and quote Hevajra Tantra: "Sentient beings are Buddhas, obscured only by adventitious defilements." The reader understands adventitious to mean "foreign," "external," or "added to" an originally pure nature, implying defilements are separable contaminants.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "adventitious" (glo bur) literally means "sudden," "occasional," or "extraneous"—suggesting something not essential or inherent. Natural language implies something added to an originally pure state. The metaphor of obscuration (like clouds covering the sun) reinforces the sense of something covering something else.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The co-emergent nature of purity and confusion is completely missed. What actually arise together (lhan cig skyes)—ground and ignorance, purity and defilement—appear sequential: first purity, then contamination, then purification. The non-dual understanding that defilements have no existence separate from purity is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek to "remove" defilements as if they were removable stains on an essentially pure cloth, rather than recognizing that their nature is inseparable from purity. This creates dualistic struggle—trying to get rid of something that has no independent existence. "Cleaning" becomes the practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURIFICATION ERROR] where practice becomes cleaning, [ORIGINAL PURITY ERROR] where "original" is temporalized as prior state, [REMOVAL ERROR] where defilements are seen as eliminable, and [SEPARATION ERROR] where pure and impure are dualized. Also activates [STRUGGLE ERROR] where effort is applied to impossible task.

[CONCEPTUAL ERROR] [THOUGHT ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18254-18261 identify conceptual thought (rnam rtog) as "great ignorance" and "the cause of falling into the ocean of samsara." The reader concludes that thoughts themselves are the problem and must be stopped or eliminated.

WHY IT ARISES:
The strong language ("great ignorance," "ocean of samsara") suggests thoughts are dangerous enemies to be defeated. The natural antipathy toward disturbing, obsessive, or negative thoughts reinforces this interpretation. The cause-effect language (thoughts cause samsara) implies removing cause removes effect.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The nature of thought is completely missed. What is actually the display of awareness appearing as thought—empty, luminous, naturally liberated—is rejected, creating aversion to the very nature of mind. The recognition that thoughts are naturally liberated (rtog pa rang grol) is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to stop thinking through suppression, concentration, or meditative techniques. This creates quietism, dissociation, or blank-minded absorption mistaken for realization. The natural clarity and cognizance of awareness are suppressed along with thoughts. Anti-intellectual attitudes develop.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [THOUGHT SUPPRESSION ERROR] where mental quiet is mistaken for realization, [AVERSION ERROR] where judgment of thoughts creates new dualism, [QUIETISM ERROR] where blankness is pursued, and [DISSOCIATION ERROR] where cutting off replaces recognition. Also activates [ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM] where thinking is demonized.

[DEFINITIONAL ERROR] [ETYMOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18263-18269 provide formal definitions of primordial wisdom (ye shes): "not conceptuality," "self-clear essence," "threefold purity," "meaning abiding from the beginning." The reader treats these as technical definitions to be mastered and memorized.

WHY IT ARISES:
The definitional format (nges tshig) and fourfold structure resemble academic or dictionary definitions. The precision of terminology suggests that knowing definitions equals understanding. Traditional study emphasizes mastery of definitions as foundation of knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is completely replaced by definitional knowledge. One can recite the four aspects of primordial wisdom, explain their meanings, and debate their interpretations without ever recognizing the wisdom that is always present. The pointing function is lost in favor of the pointer.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual mastery creates false confidence. Practitioners believe they "understand primordial wisdom" because they can define it. They may teach others the definitions while lacking recognition themselves. Debates about definitions and terminology obscure direct investigation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCHOLASTIC ERROR] where understanding concepts substitutes for recognition, [DEFINITIONAL DEBATE ERROR] where terminological precision becomes accomplishment, [TEACHING ERROR] where those without recognition instruct others, and [CONFIDENCE ERROR] where intellectual clarity masks experiential confusion.

[SCRIPTURAL ERROR] [CITATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18270-18273 quote Hevajra Tantra extensively on the nature of mind and defilements. The citations are treated as authoritative proofs establishing definitive truths about reality rather than skillful means inviting recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The Hevajra Tantra is a major authoritative source in the tradition. Scriptural citation format suggests proof or validation. Traditional reverence for tantra combines with academic citation practices. The weight of tradition makes it difficult to see citations as functional rather than declarative.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pointing function of the tantric imagery and language is lost. Citations become objects of faith or authority rather than invitations to recognize. The living meaning is replaced by doctrinal certainty about what the text means. Words that should disrupt fixation become new fixation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may accumulate scriptural references as proof of view without investigating their actual meaning. Debates about tantric interpretation substitute for practice. The emptiness of all scriptural claims—even Hevajra—is forgotten.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [FUNDAMENTALISM ERROR] where literal interpretation overrides experience, [BIBLIOGRAPHY ERROR] where knowledge of sources substitutes for understanding, [AUTHORITY ERROR] where external validation replaces direct knowing, and [TANTRIC ELITISM] where access to "higher" texts becomes status.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SUBSTANTIALIST ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18274-18290 describe three types of wisdom: basis-abiding wisdom (gzhi gnas kyi ye shes), self-perfected nature (rang bzhin lhun grub kyi ye shes), and all-pervading compassion (thugs rje kun khyab kyi ye shes). The threefold classification suggests three distinct ontological entities or layers of reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The threefold classification (gsum du 'dod) suggests systematic ontology. The categories appear to describe different "things" or aspects of reality that could be enumerated, studied, and experienced separately. Buddhist teachings on the three wisdoms train us to accept this framework.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of the three wisdoms is completely missed. What are actually three ways of describing the same recognition from different perspectives appear as separate realities to be understood individually. The understanding that all three are simply rigpa recognized is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek to experience "basis-abiding wisdom," then "self-perfected wisdom," then "all-pervading wisdom" as sequential attainments. They may study each separately, cultivate each individually. New forms of spiritual materialism and goal-orientation develop.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LAYER ERROR] where reality appears stratified, [SEQUENTIAL ERROR] where wisdoms become stages, [CULTIVATION ERROR] where each is developed separately, and [ATTAINMENT ERROR] where wisdoms become goals. Also activates [COMPLETIONISM] where all three must be achieved.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 431 continues the adventitious defilement theme and introduces formal definitions of wisdom. The Hevajra citations establish scriptural authority patterns. The conceptual thought discussion sets up aversion-to-mind errors. Page 432 will elaborate the three wisdoms and their characteristics. The definitional approach on this page amplifies scholastic errors. The threefold wisdom structure introduced here will be detailed extensively in subsequent pages. The "not conceptuality" definition particularly invites anti-thought attitudes. The adventitious language will recur and must be consistently understood as pointing to co-emergence, not sequence. The Hevajra quotes will be echoed in page 432 with further elaboration.
