[PRACTICE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of winds transforming into disease when elements conflict (fire wind causing bile disease, etc.) describes actual pathophysiology requiring medical intervention to restore elemental harmony.

WHY IT ARISES:
The disease causation language suggests medical pathology. Medical frameworks naturally interpret these as descriptions of actual illness mechanisms.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes elemental medicine. The practitioner approaches wind imbalances as medical conditions requiring treatment rather than view-based transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Medicalization of spiritual practice. The practitioner treats spiritual obstacles as elemental disorders to be healed rather than recognized.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of earth wind generating flesh, water wind generating blood, etc., describes actual embryological and physiological processes by which elements literally construct the physical body.

WHY IT ARISES:
The generative language ("generates," "produces") suggests biological causation. Scientific materialism interprets these as literal developmental biology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen embryology becomes literal biology. The practitioner believes elements actually build the body through wind-mediated processes.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Materialism obscures symbolic dimension. The profound presentation of body as elemental manifestation is reduced to physicalist explanation.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The elaborate calculations of wind movements (21,600 breaths per day, etc.) and their relationship to time measurements constitute a precise temporal science that should be studied and applied mathematically.

WHY IT ARISES:
The mathematical precision suggests scientific quantification. Academic training values such systematic calculations as rigorous knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes temporal mathematics. The practitioner focuses on calculations and measurements rather than timeless recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Quantification obsession develops. The practitioner becomes fixated on counting and measuring rather than direct experience.
