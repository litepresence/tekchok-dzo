[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "phyag rgya chen po" (mahamudra/great seal) as a specific meditation technique or advanced practice system.

WHY IT ARISES:
Mahamudra is commonly taught as a system with techniques. Students assume this is a practice method.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The nature of all phenomena is reduced to a technique. Students practice "doing" mahamudra.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes method-obsession. The seal that is already present is obscured by seeking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of technique, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of practicer and practice, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of methods over nature.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding the distinction between "dzogchen" and "mahamudra" as referring to two different paths or competing systems.

WHY IT ARISES:
Different names suggest different things. Students assume these are competing traditions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of recognition is fragmented into sectarian comparison. Students debate which is superior.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes tradition-identification. The nature beyond labels is obscured by affiliation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY sectarianism, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of distinctions, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL reification of traditions.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "bshad pa" (explanation/teaching) as intellectual study rather than pointing to direct recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Explanation" suggests information transfer. Students assume studying explanations is practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Pointing instructions are treated as academic subjects. Students accumulate knowledge about recognition without recognizing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes study. The distinction between knowing about and knowing directly is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY accumulation, then to PEDAGOGICAL information transfer, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between concept and reality.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "nyams" (experience/taste) as referring to subjective emotional or psychological states.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Experience" suggests subjective feeling. Students psychologize spiritual experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The direct encounter with nature is reduced to subjective feeling. Students chase emotional states.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes emotion-seeking. The emptiness of experience is obscured by pursuit.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as emotionalism, then to MEDITATIONISM of state-seeking, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL subjectivism.
