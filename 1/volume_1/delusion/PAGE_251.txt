[10281-10288]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Samaya commitments are external rules imposed by a guru or institution, like religious commandments or contractual obligations.

WHY IT ARISES:
Western legalistic frameworks unconsciously impose contractual interpretations. The structured presentation suggests external authority imposing conditions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samaya becomes objectified as set of behavioral constraints rather than expression of realized view.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner focuses on rule-compliance rather than recognition. Relationship with guru becomes transactional rather than transmission-based.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] and [ETERNALISTIC ERROR].

[PRACTICE ERROR] [LITERALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The time frames (days, months, years) for samaya degeneration are literal deadlines after which restoration becomes mechanically impossible.

WHY IT ARISES:
Prescriptive language suggests fixed temporal mechanics. Western practitioners seek certainty in quantifiable measures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samaya practice becomes anxiety-driven monitoring of time elapsed since lapse, rather than recognition-based restoration.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner abandons restoration attempts when arbitrary time limits exceeded, believing samaya permanently ruptured. Guilt and hopelessness replace genuine confession.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

[10304-10333]
[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [SUBSTANTIALIST ERROR]

MISREADING:
Samaya violations create actual substantial stains or defilements that accumulate in the mind-stream like karmic debts requiring specific payment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Language of "degeneration," "rupture," and "restoration" suggests substantial damage to an entity. Buddhist karma-frameworks unconsciously imported.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samaya becomes understood as substantial entity that can be damaged, lost, or repaired through ritual mechanics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Restoration rituals are performed as expiatory transactions to "pay off" samaya debts rather than as recognition-based realignment with view.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[10321-10332]
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
After three years of broken samaya, one is permanently abandoned by the lineage and must wander in suffering with no possibility of reconnection.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Restore able not" interpreted as absolute metaphysical impossibility rather than extreme difficulty. Despair response to strong language.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practitioner who believes they have crossed this threshold abandons Dharma practice entirely, believing themselves excluded.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The extreme language becomes self-fulfilling prophecy through abandonment rather than through actual samaya mechanics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] and [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].
