[POETIC ERROR] [METAPHOR ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18405-18427: Extensive verse descriptions of the five wisdoms use poetic imagery ("like the sun's orb," "like space," "like a wish-fulfilling jewel"). One might literalize these into required experiences or metaphysical claims.

WHY IT ARISES:
The poetic language is beautiful and evocative. Our minds naturally grasp at the imagery, especially when enhanced by literary translation that preserves the aesthetic.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pointing function of poetry is missed. What are meant to evoke recognition become objects of aesthetic appreciation or metaphysical speculation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "sun-like" clarity or "space-like" openness as experiences. The natural, unadorned recognition is obscured by pursuit of poetic qualities.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [AESTHETIC ERROR] where beautiful descriptions become goals, and [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific qualities are sought as signs of wisdom.

[KNOWABLE ERROR] [OBJECT ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18425-18464: The text distinguishes wisdom "encompassed by knower" (shes pas bsdus pa) and wisdom "encompassed by knowables" (shes byas bsdus pa). One might see these as two different types of knowledge or cognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure (shes pas/shes byas + bsdus pa) suggests classification. Academic training encourages identifying and distinguishing types of knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of knowing and knowable in wisdom is missed. What are actually two ways of describing wisdom's all-pervasiveness appear as separate categories.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate one type of wisdom or the other, or debate their relative importance. The natural inseparability of subject and object in recognition is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBJECT-OBJECT ERROR] where knower and known remain dualistic, and [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become objects of practice.
