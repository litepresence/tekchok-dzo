[POETIC ERROR] [METAPHOR ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18405-18427 present extensive poetic verse descriptions of the five wisdoms using rich imagery: "like the sun's orb" (nyi ma'i dkyil 'drar gsal), "like space" (nam mkha' ltar yangs), "like a wish-fulfilling jewel" (yid bzhin nor bu ltar), "like the moon's reflection in water" (chu zla ltar snang). The reader literalizes these into required experiences or metaphysical claims about the essential nature of wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
The poetic language is exquisitely beautiful, evocative, and memorable. Our minds naturally grasp at vivid imagery, especially when enhanced by literary translation. The metaphors seem to describe precisely what wisdom is "like," suggesting specific experiential qualities. Vivid imagery appears to capture truth more accurately than abstract language.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pointing function of poetry is completely missed. What are meant to evoke recognition through resonance, suggestion, and beauty become objects of aesthetic appreciation, metaphysical speculation, or experiential pursuit. The metaphor is mistaken for the meaning, the finger for the moon.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may actively seek "sun-like" clarity, "space-like" openness, "jewel-like" fulfillment, or "moon-reflection-like" purity as meditation goals. They may compare their meditation experiences to these images, judging success by aesthetic correspondence. The natural, unadorned recognition is obscured by pursuit of poetic qualities.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [AESTHETIC ERROR] where beautiful descriptions become goals, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific qualities are sought, [COMPARISON ERROR] where practice is measured against imagery, [POETIC FIXATION] where metaphors are literalized, and [IMAGERY DEPENDENCE] where recognition requires poetic language.

[KNOWABLE ERROR] [OBJECT ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18425-18464 distinguish between wisdom "encompassed by knower" (shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes) and wisdom "encompassed by knowables" (shes byas bsdus pa'i ye shes). The reader understands these as describing two fundamentally different types of knowledge, cognition, or wisdom requiring separate understanding and cultivation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure (shes pas vs. shes byas + bsdus pa) naturally suggests a classification into distinct types. The explicit distinction between knower and known appears to create two separate categories of wisdom. Academic training encourages identifying, distinguishing, and cataloging types of knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound unity of knowing and knowable in wisdom is completely missed. What are actually two ways of describing wisdom's all-pervasiveness—wisdom as that which knows all phenomena, and wisdom as that which is the nature of all known phenomena—appear as separate categories or types.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate "knower wisdom" or "knowable wisdom" as separate projects. They may debate the relative importance of each or pursue one as primary and the other as secondary. The natural inseparability of subject and object in recognition is obscured by categorical thinking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBJECT-OBJECT ERROR] where knower and known remain dualistic, [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become objects of separate practice, [TYPOLOGY ERROR] where types are grasped, and [SEPARATION ERROR] where unity is divided into categories.

[CALCULATION ERROR] [MULTIPLICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18465-18495 present the elaborate system where each of the five wisdoms is subdivided into five aspects, creating twenty-five wisdoms total (5 × 5 = 25). The mathematical precision suggests this represents the actual structure of enlightened awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic multiplication (five wisdoms × five aspects each) suggests rigorous, complete classification. The mathematical precision (5 × 5 = 25) implies accuracy and systematic knowledge. The thoroughness of enumeration appears to provide comprehensive coverage of wisdom's varieties.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single essence of wisdom is completely obscured by its multiple descriptions. What is actually one recognition appearing in various contexts or described from different perspectives appears as twenty-five different wisdoms to be understood, cultivated, and experienced individually.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of twenty-five wisdoms or, conversely, collect knowledge about them as a form of spiritual accomplishment. They may study elaborate charts mapping the twenty-five wisdoms. The simple fact of recognition is lost in elaborate taxonomy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [COMPLEXITY ERROR] where the path appears unnecessarily complicated, [CATALOGING ERROR] where wisdom-knowledge replaces recognition, [OVERWHELM ERROR] where quantity defeats practice, and [MULTIPLICITY ERROR] where one becomes many.

[EXPANSE ERROR] [SPACE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18496-18511 describe dharmadhatu wisdom using spatial metaphors: "vast expanse of dharmadhatu" (chos dbyings klong yangs), "great expanse of clear light," "dharmadhatu of outer and inner," "all-pervading like space" (nam mkha' ltar khyab). The reader reifies dharmadhatu as a vast container, cosmic field, or infinite space.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial language (klong, dbyings, khyab pa) naturally suggests extension, vastness, pervasion, and containment. Our embodied cognition interprets "expanse" literally as something with dimensions in which phenomena occur. The pervasion metaphor suggests something that extends everywhere, containing all things.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dharmadhatu is objectified as a vast space, container, field, or cosmic matrix in which phenomena arise, dwell, and cease. The non-dual nature of dharmadhatu—neither container nor contained, neither space nor what fills space, neither vast nor small—is completely missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "vastness" or "spaciousness" as experiences of dharmadhatu. They may try to "expand into" the expanse, "merge with" space, or "rest in" vastness. Altered states of expanded awareness, openness, or boundlessness are mistaken for recognition of dharmadhatu.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SPATIAL ERROR] where non-duality is understood geometrically, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific sensations become dharmadhatu, [CONTAINER ERROR] where dharmadhatu holds phenomena, and [MERGING ERROR] where union with space is sought.

[INNER-OUTER ERROR] [DIRECTION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18511-18569 describe "inner wisdom" (nang gi ye shes) and "outer wisdom" (phyi'i ye shes), "wisdom of the body" (lus kyi ye shes) and "wisdom of dharmadhatu." The reader understands these as describing actually distinct domains or locations of wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
The spatial distinction between inner and outer is fundamental to ordinary experience. The classification suggests wisdom exists in different locations or domains. The body/dharmadhatu distinction appears to create categories.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is objectified as existing in different places—inside, outside, in body, in dharmadhatu. The understanding that these are simply different ways of pointing to the same recognition is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "inner wisdom" through introspection or "outer wisdom" through observation. They may believe body wisdom is different from dharmadhatu wisdom.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [LOCATION ERROR] where wisdom is sought in places, [INTROSPECTION ERROR] where looking inward is privileged, [DOMAIN ERROR] where categories are reified, and [DIRECTION ERROR] where spatial orientation matters.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 436 presents the twenty-five wisdom enumeration and spatial metaphors. The inner/outer distinction maintains spatial errors from previous pages. Page 437 will present light imagery and specific practices. Page 438 will describe object wisdom and progress signs. Page 439 will elaborate tathagatagarbha. Page 440 will conclude this section. The extensive enumeration throughout these pages requires recognition as pedagogical tools. The spatial language must be understood metaphorically.
