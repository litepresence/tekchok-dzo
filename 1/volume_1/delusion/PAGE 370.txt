[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of winds dwelling in channels, with specific numbers for different elemental winds (earth wind 5,400, water wind 5,400, etc.), describes fixed metaphysical structures that constitute the basis of existence.

WHY IT ARISES:
The precise enumeration and "dwelling" language suggest permanent ontological entities. Eternalist habits interpret these as stable structures underlying all phenomena.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Winds are reified into permanent elemental forces. The practitioner believes these winds are objectively real energies that must be manipulated or harmonized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Elemental obsession replaces view. The practitioner focuses on balancing or controlling elemental winds rather than recognizing their empty nature.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The seasonal wind transformations (winter ice-like wind becoming fire wind, etc.) describe actual physiological changes that occur in the body with seasons, requiring adaptive practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The seasonal correspondence suggests biological rhythm. Medical and wellness frameworks encourage adaptation to seasonal physiological changes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes seasonal physiology. The practitioner believes practice must adapt to actual seasonal changes in body energies.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Seasonal dependency develops. The practitioner believes certain practices only work in specific seasons, limiting practice to "appropriate" times.

[DUALISTIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The distinction between male wind (pho rlung) flowing in the right nostril and female wind (mo rlung) flowing in the left describes actual gendered energies that should be cultivated according to one's gender.

WHY IT ARISES:
The gendered terminology and nostril correlation suggest biological essentialism. Cultural gender frameworks encourage interpretation as gender-specific practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes gender-essentialist practice. The practitioner believes men and women have fundamentally different energies requiring different approaches.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Gender fixation replaces non-dual recognition. The practitioner obsesses about gender-appropriate practice rather than recognizing mind beyond gender.
