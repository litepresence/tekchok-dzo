ERROR TYPE 1: [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
The nine_yanas presentation is understood as establishing fixed ontological categories rather than pedagogical skillful means.


WHY IT ARISES:
Literal interpretation of teachings. The practitioner wants definitive truths. Religious traditions often posit metaphysical realities.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Categories become reified. The practitioner treats fluid descriptions as fixed realities.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Flexibility is lost. The practitioner forces experience into categorical boxes.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]



ERROR TYPE 2: [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
Systematic analysis of nine_yanas is interpreted as requiring comprehensive intellectual mastery before practice can begin.


WHY IT ARISES:
Academic conditioning. The practitioner assumes knowledge precedes realization. Fear of missing important points.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Study replaces practice. The practitioner becomes expert without realization.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual pride develops. Recognition is deferred indefinitely.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PREPARATION PARALYSIS] and [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]



ERROR TYPE 3: [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism develops around 'attainment.' Authentic practice is lost.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [PROGRESSION MYTH]



ERROR TYPE 4: [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
Scriptural citations supporting nine_yanas are taken as proof of absolute authority rather than skillful means for specific capacities.


WHY IT ARISES:
Fundamentalist tendencies seek certainty. Scriptural literalism is common in religious traditions.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Citations become weapons in debate. Living recognition is subordinated to textual authority.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Sectarianism develops. 'Buddha said so' ends inquiry.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] and [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM]



ERROR TYPE 5: [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
Detailed enumeration in nine_yanas suggests exhaustive study is required, creating overwhelm and deferral of practice.


WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner is overwhelmed by detail. Practice is deferred until 'mastery' is achieved.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Burnout or giving up. The impossibility of comprehensive knowledge creates despair.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PREPARATION PARALYSIS] and [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY]
