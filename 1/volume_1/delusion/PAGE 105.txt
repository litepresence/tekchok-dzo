[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping; Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping" describes the goal of meditation practice, where thoughts stop and one rests in non-dual awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of "cessation" (zad pa) and "free from grasping" suggests a meditative state where thinking ceases and non-duality is maintained.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to stop thoughts and maintain non-dual awareness as a meditation practice, evaluating success by how thought-free they become.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attachment to clarity and calm. Aversion to conceptual thought. Confusion between non-conceptual wisdom and non-conceptual ignorance.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Thought suppression → dullness → false sense of peace → failure to recognize wisdom nature → wasted practice time.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Through the vital-point wind abiding in the channels... the essential point of severing the connection between body and mind... the essential point of arising's self-liberation" provides specific techniques for working with subtle energy (rtsa rlung) that should be practiced to achieve liberation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed technical instructions about channels, winds, and vital points suggest a practice methodology involving energetic manipulation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner focuses on energetic practices as the path, attempting to manipulate rtsa rlung to achieve the described results.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fixation on subtle body phenomena. Mistaking energetic experiences for realization. Physical or psychological imbalance from forceful practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Obsession with channels and winds → subtle body fixation → missing the point that these are metaphors for mind nature → energetic imbalances → physical or mental disturbance.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Through the vast expanse's aspect—never departing anywhere—the pervasion and estimation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa... self-arisen wisdom" describes a vast, all-encompassing consciousness that is the ground of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.

WHY IT ARISES:
The metaphor of vast expanse (dbyings rgya che ba) and the claim that it never departs anywhere suggests an eternal, all-pervasive ground.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Grasping at a universal mind or cosmic consciousness as the nature of reality. The practitioner seeks to merge with this vast expanse.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pantheistic or panentheistic view. Confusion between dharmadhātu and a universal Self. Reification of space-like awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Cosmic consciousness fixation → philosophical syncretism → loss of Buddhist emptiness view → eternalism.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"The essence of the self-arising tantra's instruction—all commands' source—is clear in the arising ground. The unique is cut by the axe of distinctive knowing. Through non-duality in self-nature, the cessation of saṃsāra's reliance... emptiness is free from the ground of dispute" presents a philosophical argument about the nature of reality that can be understood intellectually.

WHY IT ARISES:
The philosophical language and logical structure suggest a tenet system to be comprehended.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Intellectual understanding of Dzogchen philosophy mistaken for realization. The practitioner believes they understand Dzogchen because they can explain it.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Scholasticism without practice. Debate and discussion substituted for meditation. Pride in philosophical knowledge.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Intellectual mastery → teaching without realization → misleading students → perpetuating misunderstanding → lineage corruption.

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The four manners of command (view's thorough investigation, removing obscurations, bringing forth the hidden, self-clarifying explanation) represent four progressive stages of teaching that unfold sequentially.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numbered list and progression from investigation to clarification suggests a developmental sequence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner expects to progress through these stages in order, believing they must complete one before accessing the next.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Hierarchy of teachings. Waiting to be "ready" for higher teachings. Teacher-student games about permission.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Dependency on teacher approval → failure to recognize what is already present → power dynamics in teacher-student relationship → abuse potential.

[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground, action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation—through self-nature's emptiness arising in all aspects—action, virtue, and non-virtue not abandoned—buddhas and sentient beings do not exist" means that good and bad actions are ultimately empty, so ethical distinctions don't matter, and since buddhas and beings don't exist, there's no one to save and nothing to do.

WHY IT ARISES:
The explicit statement that action is free from good and bad and that buddhas and beings do not exist appears to dissolve all conventional distinctions and responsibilities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Moral nihilism justified by emptiness. The practitioner believes they are beyond ethics and compassion since all distinctions are empty.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Disregard for precepts. Rejection of bodhicitta. Justification of selfishness as "emptiness."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Moral license → harmful behavior → loss of merit → obstacles to realization → descent into lower realms.

[3912-3914]
[PRACTICE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"The view clinging to appearance and concept—non-arising; The investigation of mind's realization—all doubts released" describes a view to be achieved and a state of doubtlessness to be attained through investigation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of clinging and non-arising suggests a specific view to adopt. The release of doubts implies a state to achieve.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to achieve a state of non-arising and doubtlessness through investigation, treating these as meditative goals.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Grasping at non-arising. Forcing doubtlessness. Confusion between intellectual certainty and wisdom.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Effort to achieve view → subtle grasping → exhaustion → giving up or faking realization.
