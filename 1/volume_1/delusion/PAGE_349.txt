[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [FOUR ELEMENT SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The four elements ('byung bzhi) are actual material substances that compose the body and function mechanically.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14225-14238: Extensive descriptions of elements and their functions: "phya srid pa'i chags lugs rlung la brten nas chu/chu las sa" (outer existence's attachment pattern depends on wind, wind on water, water on earth).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing elements as substantial entities.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Manipulating elements as material forces.
Missing that elements are wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ELEMENTAL MATERIALISM ERROR]

---

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [FOUR WHEEL ARCHITECTURALISM]

MISREADING:
The four wheels ('khor lo bzhi) are actual structures or centers that must be constructed or activated.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14221-14224: Introduction of the four wheels as distinct entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing wheels as architectural features of the body.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to "open" or "spin" wheels.
Missing that wheels are natural presence, not structures.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[CAKRA CONSTRUCTION ERROR]

---

[CAUSAL ERROR] [DEPENDENT ORIGINATION LINEARITY]

MISREADING:
Dependent origination (rten 'brel) operates in a linear chain where one element causes the next.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14227-14228: "rlung la brten nas chu/chu las sa" (wind depends on water, water on earth).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing dependent arising as linear causation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to break the chain at specific points.
Missing that dependent arising is mutually pervasive and non-linear.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[CAUSAL REDUCTIONISM ERROR]
