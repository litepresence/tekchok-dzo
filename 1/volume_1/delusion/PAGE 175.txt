[PSYCHIC POWER ERROR] [SIDDHI OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the enumeration of qualities (knowing others' minds, remembering past lives, seeing beings' births) as establishing psychic powers as the goal of practice, pursuing siddhis rather than liberation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific powers listed trigger fascination with paranormal abilities. The desire for special powers supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pursuit of powers replaces the pursuit of recognition. Spiritual materialism develops.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Powers become objects of competition and display. The path is corrupted.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that powers are obstacles if clung to is entirely missed.

[FAULT OBSESSION ERROR] [NEGATIVITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes fixated on the "fault" of not receiving empowerment, developing anxiety about missing essential transmissions rather than confidence in inherent nature.

WHY IT ARISES:
The mention of fault triggers guilt and anxiety. The mind habitually focuses on potential failures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Fear of missing out replaces joyful confidence. Practice becomes anxious.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching that nature is complete is doubted. The reader pursues endless empowerments.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle of self-sufficiency is entirely lost.

[DEPENDENCY ERROR] [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the statement that secret mantra power is necessary for accomplishment as establishing total dependency on external transmission, denying self-sufficiency.

WHY IT ARISES:
The comparison to a ferryman without hands triggers dependency thinking. The need for guidance supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition of innate completeness is abandoned. The teaching that one is already buddha is forgotten.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Guru dependency becomes total. Exploitation becomes possible.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The entire Dzogchen teaching of self-liberation is entirely inverted.
