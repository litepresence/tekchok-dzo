[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The distinction between "deity yoga illusory body" (yi dam lha'i sgyu lus) and "dharmata bardo" (chos nyid bar do) is interpreted as establishing two ontologically different experiences with dzogchen's being superior.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative structure triggers hierarchy-assumption. "Dharmata" suggests authenticity. The practitioner wants superior experience.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-in-both nature is lost. Dharmata-bardo becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes deity yoga is inferior.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Dharmata practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Deity yoga practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that both point to same nature is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Ontological distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "chosen" dharmata over deity yoga conceptually.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The distinction between "natural nirmanakaya pure lands" (rang bzhin sprul sku'i zhing) and "travel-accomplished Buddha fields" (mas bgrod) is interpreted as establishing two classes of pure lands with natural being superior.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Natural" triggers authenticity-association. Comparative language suggests value. The practitioner wants "natural" attainment.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The equal-nature of all pure land is lost. Natural-pure-land becomes elitist destination. The practitioner believes accomplished-pure-lands are inferior.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Natural-pure-land practitioner" becomes superior identity. Travel-accomplishers are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that all pure lands are mind is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 477-478's comparisons. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "attained" natural-pure-land conceptually.

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The comparison of "thigle of light-essence" ('od gsal gyi thig le) versus "rainbow thigle from wind-mind binding" (rlung sems bzung ba'i 'ja' 'od kyi thig le) is interpreted as establishing correct versus incorrect thigle experiences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparison suggests evaluation. "Essence" suggests authenticity. The practitioner wants "correct" thigle.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-nature of all thigle is lost. The practitioner judges thigle-experiences by origin. Authenticity-anxiety replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Essence-thigle practitioners" become orthodox. Wind-mind-thigle is deemed deviation. The authentic recognition that all thigles are appearances is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] carries to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Thigle-distinctions become deviation-sources. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is anxious about thigle-authenticity.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The final comparison section triggers "one more section before colophon" mentality. The practitioner rushes through comparisons to reach the end.

WHY IT ARISES:
Final-section urgency creates momentum. Comparison-density creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "done."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The humbling function of comparison-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "read" comparisons without being humbled. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern to colophon. Dedication is dismissed as "final formality."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs are not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's power.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "similar in appearance but different in recognition" principle is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of subtle discernment technology.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Subtle" suggests sophistication. "Different" suggests special knowledge. The practitioner wants superior discernment.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The universal-availability of recognition is lost. Subtle-discernment becomes dzogchen-exclusive. Elitism emerges around "having discernment."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Discerning practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Others are deemed "discernment-lacking." The authentic recognition that discernment is not possession is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 477-478's 'dra'o 'dra'o verses. Discernment is reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "discerned" without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The comparison-elitism on this page carries to PAGE 477-478's 'dra'o 'dra'o elaboration. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with comparison-superiority.
