[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The thirteen kāyas are interpreted as literally existing forms or bodies that manifest progressively—achievable states that appear as one advances through thodgal stages.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumeration (*བཅུ་གསུམ་, thirteen) triggers categorical reification. "Kāya" suggests form-body. The detailed naming (*རོལ་པ་ཆེན་པོའི་སྐུ་, *སྤྱི་ཕུད་ཆེན་པོའི་སྐུ་) encourages belief in distinct entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural display of rigpa is replaced by progressive embodiment project. Practitioners seek to "achieve" each kāya as milestone. The formless ground is obscured by fascination with form.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Holding own characteristics" (*རང་གི་མཚན་ཉིད་འཛིན་པ་) is interpreted as stabilization of specific form. "Suchness" (*ཡེ་ཇི་བཞིན་པ་) becomes another attainment. The thirteenth kāya becomes the ultimate goal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—belief in truly existing subtle bodies. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as practitioners strive to manifest specific kāyas. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as kāya-hierarchy is taught as graduated path.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The threefold division (basis, path, fruition kāyas) is interpreted as temporal progression—forms that appear sequentially as one traverses the path, rather than simultaneous aspects of naturally abiding display.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential language (*གཞི་, *ལམ་, *འབྲས་བུ་) triggers developmental reading. "From the beginning" (*ཡེ་གནས་) is taken as temporal origin. Western spiritual frameworks project linear progression onto Dzogchen.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen view collapses into gradual path. The primordial completeness is missed. "Spontaneously accomplished three kāyas" (*སྐུ་གསུམ་ལྷུན་གྲུབ་) becomes something to achieve rather than what always is.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Basis self-arisen wisdom" (*གཞི་རང་བྱུང་གི་ཡེ་ཤེས་) is interpreted as starting point. "Path light-resonance expanse kāya" becomes intermediate stage. Fruition is treated as endpoint rather than recognition of what never changed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] produces [PRACTICE ERROR] where thodgal is practiced as progressive attainment. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows when texts are read through gradualist hermeneutics. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The special division of eleven kāyas is interpreted as asserting eleven distinct truly-existing subtle bodies, each with specific characteristics—an elaborate ontology of form-levels.

WHY IT ARISES:
Detailed naming (*རིག་པའི་སྐུ་, *ཆོས་ཉིད་ཀྱི་སྐུ་, etc.) triggers reification. The systematic enumeration suggests categorical ontology. Western philosophical training encourages mapping such lists as ontological taxonomies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single dharmakāya is fragmented into multiplicity. Practitioners study "the eleven kāyas" as doctrine to master. Natural display is replaced by conceptual proliferation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Root awareness kāya" (*རྩ་བ་རིག་པའི་སྐུ་) is treated as base-level form. "Vast dharmatā kāya" becomes advanced state. "Thigle kāya" and "space kāya" are catalogued as achievements.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is reduced to elaborate ontology. [REIFICATION ERROR] follows as forms are taken literally. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as students memorize kāya-lists.
