[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The fifteen similes for awareness (lion-like, elephant-like, space-like, rainbow-like, fire-like, etc.) are interpreted as asserting fifteen distinct types or modes of awareness that actually exist—elaborate typology of consciousness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumeration (*རྣམ་པ་བཅོ་ལྔ་, fifteen) triggers categorical reification. Animal and element similes suggest distinct natures. Western psychology interprets these as consciousness-types.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Single rigpa is fragmented into fifteen entities. Practitioners study "the fifteen awarenesses" as doctrine to master. The natural display is replaced by conceptual proliferation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Unsuppressed lion-like awareness" becomes courage-type consciousness. "Distinctive elephant-like" is steadfastness-type. "Unstained crystal-like" is purity-type. Similes become definitions.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is reduced to typology. [REIFICATION ERROR] follows as awareness-types are objectified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "distant water lamp" (*རྒྱང་ཞགས་ཆུའི་སྒྲོན་མ་) as the source of "naked self-emerged awareness" is interpreted as a specific thodgal vision that practitioners should seek to experience—the "sign" of realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Lamp" (*སྒྲོན་མ་) triggers visual reading. "Distant water" suggests specific appearance. Western seekers interpret this as the quintessential thodgal experience.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal is reduced to seeking the "distant water lamp" vision. The non-dual recognition is lost in fixation on specific experience. "Have you seen the water lamp?" becomes accreditation question.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Naked self-emerged" is treated as special state. "Yogins' experiential wisdom" becomes goal. Natural display is replaced by deliberate vision-seeking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [EPISTEMIC ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR]—attempting to force water-lamp vision. [REIFICATION ERROR] follows as experience is taken as wisdom. [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] proliferates.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The statement that "characteristic-holding awareness pervades all sentient beings" is interpreted as asserting universal consciousness or shared mind—monistic metaphysics that all beings are ultimately identical.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Pervades all" (*རང་ཁྱབ་) triggers universalist reading. "Sentient beings" suggests collective. Western perennial philosophy interprets this as evidence of universal consciousness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The distinction between Buddhas and sentient beings collapses into identity. Individual minds are denied. "All beings have the same awareness" becomes metaphysical claim.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Universal awareness" is reified as substrate. Individual recognition is dismissed as illusory. The path of liberation through personal recognition is denied.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] triggers [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where individual effort is dismissed. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] follows as universal mind is reified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The statement that "all these exist fully complete when distinguished by one yogin through pressing the essential point at the time of direct sense-power object" is interpreted as asserting that these fifteen awarenesses are actual discoverable entities within experience.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Exist fully complete" (*ཆ་ཚང་དུ་ཡོད་) triggers existential reading. "Distinguished" suggests identification. Western empiricism interprets this as claim about discoverable phenomena.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The fifteen awarenesses are treated as discoverable features of experience. Practitioners attempt to "find" and "distinguish" them. Natural display is replaced by analytical exploration.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Pressing the essential point" becomes technique for discovery. "Direct sense-power object" is treated as perceptual domain. The spontaneous recognition is replaced by deliberate investigation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] where students search for fifteen awareness-types. [EPISTEMIC ERROR] proliferates as experience is analyzed. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows.
