[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "dbyings kyi sgron ma" (lamp of space/dimension) as a metaphor for a vast container-like awareness that holds or contains phenomena.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Dbyings" (space/dimension) suggests vastness and containment. Students imagine awareness as a big space that experiences occur within.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness is spatialized into a container. The non-dual identity of awareness and appearance is replaced by the dualism of container and contained.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students visualize space or imagine vastness. The intimate immediacy of awareness is lost in pursuit of spaciousness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of space visualization, then to ONTOLOGICAL spatial dualism, and finally to ETERNALISTIC view of awareness as cosmic container.

[EPISTEMIC, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
Understanding the enumeration of lamps (five lamps, four lamps, etc.) as definitive taxonomies that describe the structure of reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerated lists suggest comprehensive classification systems. The scholarly mind assumes these are ontological categories.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Descriptive metaphors are treated as ontological realities. Students debate which lamp is which, missing that all are aspects of single recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes academic study of categories. Teachers write commentaries comparing classification systems.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to SCHOLARLY obsession with taxonomy, then to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of lists over recognition, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL fragmentation of unified nature.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "zang thal" (naked/direct) as instruction to practice in a raw, unrefined, or spontaneous manner without method.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Zang thal" (naked/straight-through) suggests absence of elaboration. Students assume this means abandoning all structure and technique.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The subtle precision of natural meditation is replaced by sloppy "whatever happens" practice. Students mistake lack of discipline for directness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice degenerates into wandering mind. Teachers cannot correct students who claim they are being "direct."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PRACTICE collapse through lack of stability, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between delusion and naturalness, and finally to NIHILISTIC rejection of all method.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "bsam gtan" (meditation/absorption) as referring to concentrated mental states or altered states of consciousness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Bsam gtan" (dhyana) commonly refers to meditative absorption states. Students assume this means achieving special mental states.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural continuum of awareness is replaced by pursuit of altered states. Students seek absorption experiences rather than recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes state-dependent. Ordinary awareness is devalued while special states are sought.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of state achievement, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as altered states, and finally to REIFICATION of meditative experiences.
