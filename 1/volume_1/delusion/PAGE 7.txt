[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EMANATION LITERALISM]

MISREADING:
Emanation narratives describe actual historical events and lineages literally.

WHY IT ARISES:
Hagiographic style resembles historical accounts. Term "history" applied to atemporal events.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Confusion about whether Samantabhadra "really" appeared in time.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Literal belief in mythological narratives or rejection as fantasy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[REIFICATION ERROR].
