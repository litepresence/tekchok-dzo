[PRACTICE ERROR] [MIND BINDING MECHANICS]

MISREADING:
The "binding of mind" (sems 'ching) is interpreted as actual restraint or control of mental processes, like capturing and holding a wild animal.

WHY IT ARISES:
Control-oriented psychology projects onto meditation. The binding language suggests domination. Desire for mental discipline supports restraint-interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that mind is never bound, never free, always naturally liberated, is entirely lost. Practice becomes restraint rather than recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners develop rigid mental control while missing natural liberation. Suppression replaces transformation. The free becomes the imprisoned.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [VIEW ERROR]. Subsequent pages on liberation will be approached as escape from binding.

[VIEW ERROR] [KARMIC SEVERANCE SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The "severing of karmic and habitual connections" is understood as actual cutting of real connections, like severing ropes or canceling debts.

WHY IT ARISES:
Substantialist causation models project onto karma. The severance language suggests actual disconnection. Legalistic frameworks support cancellation-interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that karma is empty display, never substantial, never needing severance, is entirely obscured. Practice becomes karmic surgery.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners obsess over "cutting" past karma while creating new patterns. The empty becomes the substantial. Liberation is deferred until all karma is "cut."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION]. Karma becomes obstacle to be eliminated before realization.

[EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [SUPREME BODHICITTA]

MISREADING:
The supreme bodhicitta (don dam byang chub kyi sems) is treated as a special, superior substance distinct from ordinary bodhicitta, like premium grade fuel.

WHY IT ARISES:
Hierarchical essentialism projects gradations onto reality. The "supreme" modifier suggests qualitative superiority. Elitism supports tiered-interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that all bodhicitta is single essence, never graded, never supreme or ordinary, is entirely lost. The singular becomes stratified.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners disdain "ordinary" practice seeking "supreme" methods. The accessible is abandoned for the exclusive. Recognition is replaced by status-seeking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on supreme practices will be approached as advanced curriculum.

[GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [TRANSFER SEQUENCING]

MISREADING:
The "consciousness transference" ('pho ba) is interpreted as advanced technique requiring preparation through earlier practices, forming temporal curriculum.

WHY IT ARISES:
Advanced-course models impose prerequisite structures. The specialized nature suggests preparation requirements. Fear of premature practice drives deferral.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that 'pho ba is recognition always available, never advanced, never prepared for, is entirely obscured. The immediate becomes the deferred.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners believe they are "not ready" for death-practice. Death comes unprepared. The ever-present is treated as distant attainment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. Thogyal will be misread as advanced practice requiring preparation.

[PROGRESS TRACKING] [ENTERING CITIES]

MISREADING:
The ability to "enter other beings' cities" (consciousness entering other bodies) is treated as advanced siddhi to be achieved, like unlocking higher game levels.

WHY IT ARISES:
Power-acquisition frameworks project onto spiritual practice. The enumerative siddhis suggest collectible achievements. Fantasy fulfillment supports literal interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that all phenomena are already entered, never separated, is entirely lost. Practice becomes power-game rather than recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners fantasize about possessing others while missing non-dual recognition. Ethical violations justified by "siddhi pursuit." The natural becomes the supernatural.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on siddhis will be approached as power-manual.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page discusses completion of practices and advanced abilities. Preceding pages established retention errors that culminate here. Following pages (210+) transition to four joys and bliss practices that will be misunderstood through lens of sensation-accumulation.
