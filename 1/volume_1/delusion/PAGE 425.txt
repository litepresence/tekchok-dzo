[ANALYTICAL ERROR] [FRAGMENTATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17851-18012: The text presents an elaborate hierarchical structure of afflictions—from root ignorance (ma rig pa) through the five poisons to 84,000 subsidiary afflictions. One might see this as describing a real ontological structure rather than a pedagogical framework.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed enumeration creates an appearance of systematic knowledge. The mind naturally grasps at structure and pattern, mistaking the map for the territory.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition that all afflictions share a single root (non-recognition of rigpa) is obscured by the complexity of the presentation. Multiplicity becomes primary; unity is forgotten.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners approach practice as if dealing with innumerable separate problems rather than recognizing the single gesture of non-recognition that generates all appearance of multiplicity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [OVERWHELM ERROR] where the task appears impossible, and [GRADUALISM ERROR] where hierarchical models suggest step-by-step elimination is necessary.

[CAUSAL ERROR] [GENEALOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17931-17944: The text describes a causal chain: "From non-awareness arises non-awareness's display; from that display arises mind; from mind's embellishment arises mentation..." This sequential presentation might be read as temporal genesis.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure (X las byung = "arises from X") naturally suggests temporal succession. Without understanding dependent origination as non-temporal, readers impose sequential causality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samsara appears as a real historical development rather than a timeless confusion. The co-emergent nature of ground and ignorance is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek the "beginning" of ignorance or try to trace back through the causal chain, as if finding the first cause would enable liberation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [HISTORICAL ERROR] where timeless confusion is temporalized, and [SEARCH FOR ORIGIN ERROR] where practitioners seek the "first moment" of delusion.
