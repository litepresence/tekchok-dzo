[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of karma wind's twelvefold functions producing body growth, decay, and samsaric cycling describes actual mechanical processes that constitute the basis of cyclic existence.

WHY IT ARISES:
The twelvefold structure suggests cyclical mechanics. Mechanical frameworks interpret these as actual productive processes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samsara is reified into mechanical cycle. The practitioner believes karma wind literally produces existence through these twelve functions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fatalism about existence develops. The practitioner accepts samsara as mechanically produced rather than seeing its illusory nature.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error produces [MECHANICAL CYCLING] automatic existence, [SAMSAra MACHINERY] twelve functions, and [FATALISTIC ACCEPTANCE] inevitability. The error creates resignation.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of wind characteristics producing fortune, suffering, virtue, non-virtue, etc., describes fixed karmic destiny mechanically determined by wind quality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The causation language suggests deterministic mechanics. Fatalistic frameworks interpret these as unchangeable destiny.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Karma becomes mechanical fate. The practitioner believes experience is determined by wind characteristics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Resignation or hubris develops. The practitioner accepts conditions as fated or becomes proud of favorable wind signs.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error generates [FORTUNE OBSESSION] seeking good signs, [WIND-QUALITY HIERARCHY] better/worse characteristics, and [DESTINY DETERMINATION] fixed by nature. The error creates preference.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The final presentation of thigle practice as the "measure of mastery" suggests thigle meditation is a technique that, when perfected, proves and completes realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
The "mastery" language suggests skill to be developed. Achievement frameworks encourage belief in mastery as goal.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Realization becomes meditative accomplishment. The practitioner works to master thigle practice as proof of realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism develops. The practitioner collects accomplishments rather than recognizing nature.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error produces [MEDITATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENT] mastery as proof, [TECHNIQUE PERFECTION] skill over recognition, and [ACHIEVEMENT OBSESSION] collecting accomplishments. The error reduces awakening to trophy.

[VISIONARY EXPERIENCE OBSESSION] [STAGE HIERARCHY]

MISREADING:
The twelvefold functions produce progressive visionary stages—each function generates specific lights and displays representing advancement through the four visions, creating mapped progression.

WHY IT ARISES:
The cyclic structure suggests developmental journey. The twelvefold framework invites correlation with vision stages.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes twelve-stage vision map. The practitioner works through functions as progressive curriculum, expecting specific vision-milestones at each stage.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
When expected visions fail, doubt or aggressive practice follows. When visions appear, attachment to "progress" markers develops. Either way, fixation on staged experience replaces recognition available immediately beyond all stages.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error generates [VISION STAGE MAPPING] twelve to four, [PROGRESSIVE MILESTONES] expected appearances, and [STAGED PHENOMENA] predictable experiences. The error creates expectation.

[EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [DUALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The wind characteristics produce distinct "flavors" of experience that practitioners should seek to cultivate—fortune-wind brings pleasant states, virtue-wind brings good feelings, and these should be pursued.

WHY IT ARISES:
The characteristic diversity suggests experiential menu. Wellness frameworks encourage selecting desirable experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes wind-preference cultivation. The practitioner seeks fortune-wind over suffering-wind, virtue-wind over non-virtue-wind, treating experience selection as spiritual practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Substantialism creates dualistic fixation. The practitioner becomes attached to "good" wind characteristics, aversive to "bad" ones, missing that all winds are equally empty of inherent nature. Preference obscures equanimity.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error produces [WIND PREFERENCE OBSESSION] seeking good characteristics, [QUALITY SELECTION] choosing experiences, and [DUALISTIC CULTIVATION] accepting/rejecting. The error creates attachment.
