[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of karma wind's twelvefold functions producing body growth, decay, and samsaric cycling describes actual mechanical processes that constitute the basis of cyclic existence.

WHY IT ARISES:
The twelvefold structure suggests cyclical mechanics. Mechanical frameworks interpret these as actual productive processes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samsara is reified into mechanical cycle. The practitioner believes karma wind literally produces existence through these twelve functions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fatalism about existence develops. The practitioner accepts samsara as mechanically produced rather than seeing its illusory nature.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of wind characteristics producing fortune, suffering, virtue, non-virtue, etc., describes fixed karmic destiny mechanically determined by wind quality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The causation language suggests deterministic mechanics. Fatalistic frameworks interpret these as unchangeable destiny.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Karma becomes mechanical fate. The practitioner believes experience is determined by wind characteristics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Resignation or hubris develops. The practitioner accepts conditions as fated or becomes proud of favorable wind signs.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The final presentation of thigle practice as the "measure of mastery" suggests thigle meditation is a technique that, when perfected, proves and completes realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
The "mastery" language suggests skill to be developed. Achievement frameworks encourage belief in mastery as goal.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Realization becomes meditative accomplishment. The practitioner works to master thigle practice as proof of realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual materialism develops. The practitioner collects accomplishments rather than recognizing nature.
