[TELEOLOGICAL ERROR] [ESCHATOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the prophecy structure (general descent, particular flourishing and decline, holders shown) as establishing a deterministic historical trajectory where the teaching's fate is sealed, leading to passive acceptance or anxious preservationism.

WHY IT ARISES:
The future-oriented grammar of prophecy ("will descend," "will flourish/decline") triggers temporal projections. The presentation of sequence suggests inevitability.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching's vitality is projected onto an external timeline rather than recognized as immediately available. The reader either despairs about decline or desperately tries to "preserve" what cannot be lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Contemporary engagement becomes instrumentalized as participating in predetermined patterns. Authentic response to present conditions is replaced by role-playing in a cosmic drama.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition of timeless completeness is obscured by temporal preoccupations. Practice becomes about "supporting the teaching" rather than recognizing mind nature.

[MYTHOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader literalizes the cosmological presentation (Brahma-great eon, Vajradhara emanation, successive kayas) as establishing an actual temporal sequence in cosmic history, rather than recognizing these as pedagogical frameworks.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structures use past tense and sequential connectives that naturally parse as historical narrative. Mythological consciousness is cognitively processed as literal history unless trained otherwise.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teachings become locked in a distant past, their relevance to present experience obscured. The reader studies "what happened" rather than recognizing "what is."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The principle of immediate accessibility is lost. The reader awaits some future replication of the conditions of the Brahma-great eon.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The direct pointing function of all teachings is neutralized by their relocation to mythological time.

[GEOGRAPHICAL ERROR] [SPATIAL EXTERNALIZATION]

MISREADING:
Reader treats the description of various fields (this field not destroyed, other fields, Saha field) as cosmological geography, literalizing the "thousand buddhas" as actual historical figures appearing in space-time.

WHY IT ARISES:
The locative case markers and proper names (Saha) trigger spatial-geographic parsing. The concrete imagery is cognitively processed as literal reference.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The dimensionality of buddhafields is flattened to physical locations. The principle that all fields are the display of mind is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes oriented toward rebirth in "other fields" or worship of "other buddhas" rather than recognition of this very field as complete.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Pure perception (dag snang) degenerates into wishful thinking about better locations.

[BOTANICAL ERROR] [ORGANICISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the life-tree metaphor (teaching as life-tree, thousand buddhas as roots, two roots, miraculous birth types) as establishing an organic developmental model where teachings grow and mature like biological organisms.

WHY IT ARISES:
The botanical imagery triggers organicist thinking that is deeply embedded in human cognition. The metaphor is taken as establishing a model rather than as a pointing device.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching's vitality is externalized into an organic process requiring cultivation and protection. The immediacy of recognition is replaced by nurturing metaphors.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Institutional concerns about "preserving" and "spreading" the teaching displace direct engagement. The reader becomes a gardener rather than a recognizer.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The recognition that the teaching is not an entity to be preserved but a pointing to what cannot be lost is entirely missed.

[6052-6058]
[SOTERIOLOGICAL ERROR] [MATURATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets "awareness five mature" and "sentient beings mature make" as establishing a gradual ripening process over time, understanding "mature" as developmental achievement rather than recognition of what has always been complete.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "mature" (smin) carries developmental connotations that trigger gradualist readings. The pedagogical context suggests process rather than immediacy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Maturation becomes a goal to achieve through time and practice, rather than a metaphor for recognition. The reader pursues "ripening" rather than direct seeing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes accumulative, seeking to create conditions for future maturity. Present recognition is deferred.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The entire path becomes temporalized, losing the Dzogchen emphasis on primordial completeness.
