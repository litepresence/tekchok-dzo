[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [KARMA-AFFLICTION-WISDOM CHANNEL DICHOTOMY]

MISREADING:
There are fundamentally different types of channels - some for karma, some for afflictions, some for wisdom - as if they were separate entities.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14378-14405: "las dang nyon mongs rtsa...ye shes rtsa...sems kyi rtsa...yid kyi rtsa...dug gsum rtsa" (action channels, affliction channels, wisdom channels, mind channels, intellect channels, three-poison channels).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing wisdom and affliction as residing in different locations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to access wisdom channels while avoiding affliction channels.
Missing that all channels are equally wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DISCRIMINATORY CHANNEL PRACTICE ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [INNATE/CONDITIONED IGNORANCE DUALISM]

MISREADING:
There are three types of ignorance: innate (lhan cig skyes), cause-effect (rgyu mthun), and imputed (kun brtags), existing as distinct entities.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14389-14392: "gsum ni lhan cig skyes pa yin/gsum ni rgyu mthun ma rig go/lhag ma kun brtags nyid yin no" (three are innate, three are cause-effect ignorance, remainder are imputed).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing ignorance as having different natures.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to eliminate specific types of ignorance.
Missing that ignorance has no inherent existence in any form.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[IGNORANCE TAXONOMY ERROR]

[REIFICATION ERROR] [CHANNEL FORM HYPOSTATIZATION]

MISREADING:
The various channel forms (flower-like, stake-like, pearl-like, etc.) are actual shapes that can be visualized or seen.

WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing similes as literal descriptions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to visualize channels in these forms.
Missing that forms are wisdom-display without inherent shape.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VISUALIZATION LITERALISM ERROR]
