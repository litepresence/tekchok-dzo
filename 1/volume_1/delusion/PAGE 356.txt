[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [HEART WHEEL ARCHITECTURALISM]

MISREADING:
The heart dharma wheel (snying ga chos kyi 'khor lo) is an actual structure with 32 petals containing 1900 channels that can be mapped.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14529-14536: "rtsa ba'i 'dam ma brgyad las gyes pa sum cu rtsa gnyis...rtsa phran stong dang dgu brgya gnas" (8 root mud divided into 32...1000 and 900 small channels located).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing the heart wheel as architectural structure.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to visualize or construct the heart wheel.
Missing that it is the natural state itself.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ANATOMICAL MANDALA ERROR]

[NUMERICAL LITERALISM] [FIVE WISDOM CHANNEL ENUMERATION]

MISREADING:
The five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) each have corresponding channels that can be enumerated and mapped (dharmadhatu, mirror, equality, discernment, action-accomplishing).

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14569-14577: Detailed enumeration of wisdom channels and their correspondences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing wisdoms as categories with physical correspondences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Searching for wisdom-channels in the body.
Missing that wisdoms are modes of natural knowing, not body parts.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[WISDOM SPATIALIZATION ERROR]

---

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [THREE STAGE WHEEL ARCHITECTURE]

MISREADING:
The heart wheel has three stages (rim pa gsum) that are actual structural layers.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14546-14582: Repeated references to first, second, and third stages of the wheel.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing stages as spatial layers.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to access "deeper" stages.
Missing that stages are pedagogical conveniences, not ontological layers.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[STAGE PROGRESSION OBSESSION ERROR]
