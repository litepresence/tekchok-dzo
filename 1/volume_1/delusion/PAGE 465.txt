[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The description of thigle objects as "five colors, six, three, two, six" and "six wisdom essences" with "warm, cool, moving" qualities is interpreted as literal phenomenological checklist to be completed.

WHY IT ARISES:
Numerical lists trigger achievement-mentality. Sensory specifications suggest "experiential content" to access. The practitioner assumes enumerated qualities constitute practice-validation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is replaced by quality-counting. The practitioner judges practice by "how many colors" or "which temperatures." The pointing function of appearance-description collapses into phenomenological inventory.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Communities form around sharing "color-counts." Teachers who validate specific qualities gain authority. The practitioner develops sensory-materialism, believing warmth validates realization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] peaks in PAGE 466-468 as lamp-summary approaches. By PAGE 469-472's deviations, the practitioner is confused because their quality-collection hasn't produced liberation. The colophon (PAGE 479) finds them addicted to sensation-cataloging.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The distinction between objects of different lamps is interpreted as hierarchy of "object-purity," with thigle-objects being "higher" than distant-water-objects.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative structure triggers value-ranking. Technical sophistication suggests "advanced" content. The practitioner wants "highest" objects.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The equal nature of all objects as recognition-contexts is lost. The practitioner chases "superior" objects while dismissing "ordinary" appearances. Grasping at object-hierarchy prevents recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Object-snobbery emerges. Practitioners of "lower" objects are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that all objects are self-display is missed in object-discrimination.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Object-mastery becomes capacity-indicator. By PAGE 476, the practitioner looks down on deity yoga's "mental constructs" compared to dzogchen's "direct objects."

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The "space lamp object" description as "emptiness, clarity, unobstructed expression, pervading vastness" is interpreted as four qualities that must all be present simultaneously for "correct" practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Conjunctive language triggers checklist-psychology. "And" suggests requirements. The practitioner assumes all descriptors must be matched.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural recognition is suffocated by quality-matching. The practitioner worries: "Am I clear enough? Empty enough? Vast enough?" The pointing function collapses into adequacy-anxiety.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Orthodoxies form around "correct" quality-combinations. Teachers who specify exact proportions gain authority. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed if "qualities don't align."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] becomes entrenched by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of actual deviations. Having worried about quality-matching, the practitioner now obsesses over deviation-avoidance. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by orthodox anxiety.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The completion of lamp-object descriptions is seen as "finishing the four lamps section" so one can move to "the next topic." The approach to volume-end accelerates dismissive reading.

WHY IT ARISES:
Section-completion triggers "next section" anticipation. Dense technical content creates resistance. The practitioner wants to "get through" Volume 1.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration of all four lamps' pointing is missed. The practitioner has collected lamp-information without lamp-recognition. They "know about" four lamps without knowing four lamps.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward fragmented-engagement pattern. Each teaching becomes isolated "topic" to complete. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "just conclusion."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 466-468's lamp-summary is not absorbed. Arriving at PAGE 469-472's deviations without integrated understanding, the practitioner misreads them. By PAGE 479, Volume 1 is "completed" without completion.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "space lamp" as "vast like the sky, clear like crystal" is interpreted as establishing spatial metaphors as actual metaphysical claims about awareness-size and awareness-clarity.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial metaphors trigger literal size-associations. "Vast" suggests magnitude. The practitioner assumes metaphorical magnitude indicates ontological magnitude.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pedagogical function of spatial description is lost. The practitioner believes awareness literally "is" vast like sky. Recognition is replaced by magnitude-imagination.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Vast awareness" becomes object of meditation. Practitioners compare "sizes" of awareness-experiences. The authentic recognition that size-concepts don't apply is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Spatial metaphors there are also substantialized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed an elaborate "metaphysics of vastness" around dzogchen.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The object-complexity on this page carries to PAGE 466-468's lamp-summary, where the practitioner expects "synthesis of all objects." Arriving at PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga, they are confused because objects haven't brought continuity. The deviations (PAGE 471-472) become "object-errors," and the fifteen metaphors (PAGE 473-475) are reduced to "more objects."
