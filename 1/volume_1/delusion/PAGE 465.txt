[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The objects of the four lamps described as specific perceptual content—thigle colors, wisdom expressions, space-appearances—is interpreted as claiming that these are the only valid or "real" appearances, and ordinary perception is false.

WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic frameworks assume true/false appearance distinction. "Pure appearance" (dag pa'i snang ba) triggers elitism. Western practitioners project Platonic two-worlds framework onto appearance-classifications.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-nature of all appearance is lost. The practitioner divides experience into "dzogchen appearances" (valid) and "ordinary appearances" (invalid). The pointing function of specific descriptions collapses into hierarchical ontology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Color-perceptions become spiritual achievement markers. "Five wisdoms" become exclusive states. The practitioner evaluates experience by content-criteria, believing some appearances are inherently more realized than others.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding appearance-descriptions as recognition-contexts rather than ontological categories, the practitioner develops [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]—belief in two levels of reality. They may reject ordinary experience as "impure," developing spiritual bypassing. The [REIFICATION ERROR] spreads—all phenomenological descriptions become hierarchical claims. Recognition is content-dependent rather than nature-of-mind.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The elaborate numerical lists (six aspects of thigle: five colors, six, three, two, six; six wisdom essences) are interpreted as literal checklists of experiences one must have or stages one must complete.

WHY IT ARISES:
Achievement-oriented culture quantifies everything. Numbers trigger completionist mentality. Western practitioners habitually convert symbolic enumeration into curriculum requirements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pedagogical function of enumeration is lost. Numbers become targets rather than pointers. The practitioner literalizes all quantification, believing they must "experience all six" or "complete the set."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Six and five" (drug dang lnga) becomes achievement list. "Three and two" (gsum gnyis) becomes incomplete if only two experienced. The practitioner develops spiritual accounting, tracking which numbers they've "gotten."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding numbers as classification-devices, the practitioner develops [PRACTICE ERROR]—compulsive enumeration. They may force experiences to "complete" sets or despair at missing specific contents. The [REIFICATION ERROR] becomes total—all descriptions become ontological inventory. Recognition is lost in spreadsheet spirituality.
