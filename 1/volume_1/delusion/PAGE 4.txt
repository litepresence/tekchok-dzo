[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COSMOLOGICAL LITERALISM]

MISREADING:
The cosmological descriptions (Mount Meru, seven seas) represent actual geography or ancient cosmology to be rejected.

WHY IT ARISES:
Modern scientific worldview creates binary: literal truth vs mythological falsehood.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Either fundamentalist acceptance or dismissive rejection of the text.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the symbolic/mandalic function of spatial descriptions.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].
