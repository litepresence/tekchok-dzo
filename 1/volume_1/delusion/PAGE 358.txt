[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL WIND POWER AGENCY]

MISREADING:
Wind power (rlung gi stobs) and element resonance ('byung ba'i gdangs) actually function as forces within channels.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14722-14723: "rlung gi stobs dang 'byung ba'i gdangs/thig le rten du gnas pa'o" (wind power and element resonance...drops located as support).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Attributing causal agency to conceptual designations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to harness or control these forces.
Missing that all is spontaneous wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[FORCE HARNESSING OBSESSION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SQUEEZABLE/HOLDABLE CHANNEL DUALISM]

MISREADING:
Some channels are "suitable for squeezing" (gcun du rung ba), others "suitable for holding" (gzung du rung ba), as if these were intrinsic properties.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14705-14712: Systematic classification of channels by what can be done to them.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing channel properties as inherent.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to manipulate channels based on classification.
Missing that all manipulation is conceptual imputation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MANIPULATIVE CLASSIFICATION ERROR]

[MEDICAL MATERIALISM] [BLOODLETTING LOCATIONALISM]

MISREADING:
Bloodletting points can be precisely located at specific anatomical positions for specific diseases.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14731-14753: Extensive list of bloodletting points with precise anatomical descriptions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing medicine as purely physical intervention.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Obsession with anatomical precision.
Missing that healing is recognition of nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ANATOMICAL PRECISION OBSESSION ERROR]
