[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [BLOODLETTING POINT SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The bloodletting points (gtar ka) are actual physical locations that can be precisely located and pierced to cure diseases.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14438-14455: Detailed medical instructions for bloodletting at specific points: "pus mo'i mar mchan nas...sman skad du mcher rtsa nag po" (below knee...medicine language liver channel black).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing medical interventions as purely physical procedures.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Becoming obsessed with precise anatomical location.
Missing that healing occurs through recognition, not manipulation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MEDICAL MATERIALISM ERROR]

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MANTRA RECITATION EXTERNALISM]

MISREADING:
Reciting mantras at specific points while holding breath is a technique that mechanically produces healing.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14471-14473: "yi ge 'di dag gang gi nang byung ba'i tshe ngag tu bzlas pas/lnga lnga ni dbugs dang bcas pa na ba'i sar bton pas grol lo" (when these letters arise in whichever interior, recite with speech...five-five with breath expel from disease place and liberate).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing mantra as technology rather than wisdom-display.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Mechanical recitation without recognition.
Missing that mantra is the natural resonance of awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VOCAL TECHNOLOGY ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL POINT DANGER SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
Certain channel points are inherently dangerous to press or pierce, while others are safe, as if danger were intrinsic.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14420-14431: "gzung du rung ba'i rtsa lnga...ma gtems skyon 'gyur lnga yod de/gtems na skyon 'gyur de phrag go" (five graspable channels...five defects if not pressed, hundred defects if pressed).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing danger as inherent in certain channels.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fear of specific body locations.
Missing that all channels are equally the display of single nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[FEAR-BASED PRACTICE ERROR]
