[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Body speech slack-by/from suffering free-from" and "awareness slack-by/from body five arise" describe a causal process where freedom from suffering leads to the arising of the five bodies of awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
The causal language ("by/from") suggests production. The arising of five bodies implies achievement.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The five bodies are understood as produced results of practice. The practitioner seeks to generate them.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Body generation as goal. Phenomenological obsession. Spiritual materialism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Body fixation → subtle body manipulation → energetic imbalance → physical illness.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Indicating method's tantra" and "stream to/in abiding because/from tantra called" establish tantra as a continuous stream or continuum that one enters and abides within.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "stream" suggests flow. "Abiding" implies remaining in something.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Tantra is substantialized as a stream to enter. The practitioner seeks to abide in tantric continuum.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Stream-grasping. Continuum fixation. Lineage as substance.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Continuum obsession → transmission anxiety → guru dependency → exploitation.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Self's tantra to/in non-produced perfected" and "basis path fruition's meaning" establish a perfected self-nature that exists prior to production, serving as basis for path and fruition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "non-produced" suggests pre-existence. "Perfected" implies completion.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Self-nature is substantialized as perfected ground. The practitioner seeks to realize this pre-existing perfection.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Perfection fixation. Ground-grasping. Eternalist view.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Perfection seeking → dissatisfaction with present → future orientation → deferred practice.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Self-nature's tantra" and "holding determined self-nature's tantra" present a category of tantras dealing with self-nature as a determined, holdable entity.

WHY IT ARISES:
The possessive and determinative language suggests entity. The categorization implies topic.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Self-nature is reified as object of tantric study. The practitioner holds self-nature as concept.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conceptual grasping. Self-nature as possession. Missing direct recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Conceptual holding → intellectual pride → no realization → scholasticism.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Basis and path and fruition by/from holding determined" establishes basis, path, and fruition as three distinct, determinable entities that exist and can be held.

WHY IT ARISES:
The triad suggests structure. The determinative language implies entity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The path structure is substantialized. The practitioner navigates between three real entities.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Structural fixation. Path navigation as journey. Goal orientation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Journey fixation → future orientation → deferred recognition → deathbed regret.

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
"Called" at the end suggests that naming and categorization are themselves significant acts of definition.

WHY IT ARISES:
The naming function implies authority. The categorization suggests system.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Names are granted power through categorization. The practitioner values classification.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Nominal fixation. Category pride. System obsession.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Nominalism → scholasticism → sectarian classification → conflict.
