[13178-13187]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The life channel (tshe) and its coiling directions are interpreted as actual life-force channel determining lifespan rather than symbolic of attention's movement.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Life" suggests longevity. The directional coiling suggests mechanical determination.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on how attention's direction affects recognition is replaced by fatalistic lifespan determination. Agency is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner believes lifespan is mechanically determined. The transformative power of recognition is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [FATALISM ERROR] and [REIFICATION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The water channels and their functions are understood as actual plumbing system carrying fluids rather than symbolic of the skandha of feeling.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Water" suggests fluid. Channel imagery suggests plumbing. The digestive analogy suggests physical process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on how tshor ba (feeling) arises is lost in anatomical description. The skandha's nature is not recognized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner studies physiology rather than recognizing feeling's nature. The pointing to immediate experience is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PHYSIOLOGICAL ERROR] and [SKANDHA ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ELEMENTAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The fire and wind channels' interaction is interpreted as actual combustion and respiration rather than symbolic of conceptual processes.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Fire" and "wind" suggest elemental chemistry. The combustion imagery suggests physical process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on how dran bsam (memory and thought) arises is replaced by elemental chemistry. The cognitive process is not recognized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner learns elemental theory rather than recognizing thought's nature. The pointing to mind is obscured by physics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ELEMENTAL ERROR] and [COGNITIVE ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The gathering of elements every two days is understood as actual periodic process in embryology rather than symbolic of how aggregates form.

WHY IT ARISES:
Temporal periodicity suggests biological rhythm. The two-day intervals suggest measurable developmental stages.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic teaching on how the five skandhas develop is literalized as biology. The pointing to recognition is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they are learning embryology rather than the nature of delusion's development. The esoteric instruction is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [BIOLOGIZATION ERROR] and [TEMPORAL ERROR].
