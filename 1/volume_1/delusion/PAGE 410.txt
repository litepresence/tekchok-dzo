[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Taking "ye gdangs" (primordial resonance/sound) as an actual sound or audible phenomenon that one can hear with the ears.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Gdangs" (resonance/sound) naturally refers to audible sound. Students assume this means listening for inner sounds.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The expressive potency (gdangs) of awareness is reduced to auditory phenomena. Students strain to hear special sounds.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Tinnitus or imagined sounds are mistaken for realization. The metaphorical nature of "sound" as expression is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of sound listening, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between metaphor and phenomenon, and finally to REIFICATION of inner sounds.

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding "thig le" (bindu/dot) as a visualized sphere or ball of light that one focuses on during meditation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Thig le" is commonly visualized as a sphere in tantric practice. Students automatically assume visualization technique.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual bindu (uniting emptiness and appearance) is reduced to a visual object. Practice becomes fixation on an imagined sphere.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students report size, color, and location of their bindu with pride. The essence of bindu is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of visualization, then to REIFICATION of bindu as object, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of observer and observed bindu.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking "nyams su blangs pa" (brought into experience) as deliberate cultivation of experiences or states of mind.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Nyams" (experience) and "blangs" (take up) suggest actively engaging with experiences. Students assume this means cultivating experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural unfolding is replaced by deliberate experience-seeking. Students try to "have" experiences of realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes performance. Students report fabricated experiences to satisfy expectations.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of experience cultivation, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION as state-seeking, and finally to PRACTICE collapse through inauthenticity.

[ONTOLOGICAL, NIHILISTIC]

MISREADING:
Understanding "ma bzung mi gnas" (not grasped, not abiding) as instruction to avoid any fixation or engagement, leading to dissociation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Not grasped, not abiding" suggests letting go of everything. Students assume this means complete non-engagement with life.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The middle way is replaced by nihilistic dissociation. Students avoid relationships, responsibilities, and engagement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Life becomes withdrawal. The integration of realization with compassionate activity is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to NIHILISTIC rejection of engagement, then to PRACTICE of withdrawal, and finally to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of practice vs. life.
