[EPISTEMOLOGICAL ERROR] [SUBSTANTIALIST ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17714-17726: The pearl garland quotation describes wisdom (ye shes) as "consuming conceptions like fire" and being "equal to space." A reader might interpret this as describing a transcendent, metaphysical reality that exists separately from conventional experience.

WHY IT ARISES:
The poetic imagery of fire burning conceptions suggests an active agent that destroys. Western philosophical frameworks, particularly those influenced by substance metaphysics, tend to reify descriptive metaphors into ontological entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom becomes objectified as a "thing" to be attained, rather than recognizing it as the natural, unconstructed nature of awareness itself when freed from conceptual overlay.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may seek "fire-like" experiences or "space-like" states as signs of realization, creating new forms of grasping and spiritual materialism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] where specific experiences become goals, and [LINEAR PROGRESS ERROR] where "burning conceptions" is seen as a gradual purification process rather than immediate recognition.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DUALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17720-17736: The text states that "when mind ceases, wisdom dawns like the sun rising when night ends." This temporal language suggests a sequential process where mind must first end before wisdom can appear.

WHY IT ARISES:
The text uses provisional language (drang don) accessible to those operating within cause-effect frameworks. Readers habituated to temporal sequencing naturally interpret this as describing an actual process in time.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The fundamental non-duality of mind and wisdom is obscured. What is actually a distinction between recognition and non-recognition becomes reified as two separate ontological states.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to "stop mind" through forceful suppression, mistaking the natural dissolution of conceptual fixation for an act of will. This leads to quietism or dissociative states mistaken for realization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where emptiness of mind is mistaken for non-existence, and [GRADUALISM ERROR] where "cessation" becomes a progressive achievement.
