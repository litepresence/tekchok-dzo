[12967-12978]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Killing all sentient beings" and "emptying appearances" are interpreted as actual destructive practices or nihilistic negation.

WHY IT ARISES:
Violent and negating language triggers literal interpretation. Either moral outrage or nihilistic fascination supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that appearances empty themselves when their nature is recognized is replaced by either active destruction or passive nihilism.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner either rejects the teaching or adopts harmful practices. The spontaneous dissolution of fixation is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [ANTINOMIAN ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Cutting one's own life" is understood as suicide or self-harm rather than pointing to the cutting of conceptual mind's continuity.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Life" suggests biological existence. The phrase "cut life" triggers associations with suicide.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on cutting the stream of conceptual mind (rnam rtog) is replaced by literal death or self-harm. The living recognition is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner either rejects teaching as dangerous or literalizes self-harm. The symbolic language of tantra is misunderstood.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUICIDE MISINTERPRETATION ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The fire and water imagery is interpreted as actual elemental practices or external rituals rather than pointing to wisdom and samadhi.

WHY IT ARISES:
Elemental imagery suggests ritual use of elements. Tantric preliminary practices condition this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition of awareness-nature is replaced by elemental meditation or ritual. The pointing to shes rab (wisdom) and bsam gtan (samadhi) is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner engages in elemental practices rather than direct recognition. Dzogchen's simplicity is obscured by complexity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ELEMENTAL ERROR] and [RITUALIZATION ERROR].

[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Gathering all beings gains power" is understood as actual power over others or siddhi of control rather than integration of experience.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Power" suggests dominance or magical ability. The desire for control supports this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on integrating all experience without rejection is replaced by pursuit of power over beings. The compassionate intention is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks power rather than recognition. The non-dual integration becomes dualistic domination.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [POWER-SEEKING ERROR] and [DUALISTIC ERROR].
