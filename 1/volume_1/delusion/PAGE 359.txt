[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [MEDICAL MANTRA TECHNOLOGY]

MISREADING:
Reciting mantras while bloodletting is a technique that mechanically enhances the medical effect.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14798-14813: "rnal 'byor pa yis bzlas shing gdon...rnal 'byor pa yis shes par bya" (yogis recite and extract...yogis should know).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing mantra as medical technology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Mechanical recitation during procedures.
Missing that mantra is wisdom-display, not enhancer.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MAGICAL TECHNOLOGY ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DISEASE-POINT CORRESPONDENCE MAPPING]

MISREADING:
Specific diseases correspond to specific channel points in a fixed mapping that guarantees cure.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14738-14797: Each point associated with specific diseases: "'di gtar rims kyi nad la phan" (this extract benefits fever disease).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing disease-location correspondence as mechanical law.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Searching for the "correct" point for each disease.
Missing that disease is wisdom-display and self-liberated.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PATHOLOGICAL MAPPING ERROR]

[PRACTICE ERROR] [BURNING DIRECTION SPECIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Burning (bsreg) must be done in specific directions at specific points for specific effects.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14805-14808: "'di kun phyogs ni gang na bsreg/des ni de yi nad la phan/rnal 'byor pa yis gtems pas 'grub" (burn in whichever direction...benefits that disease...yogi accomplishes by inserting).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing directional burning as causally efficacious.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Obsession with directional precision.
Missing that space is non-directional wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DIRECTIONAL OBSESSION ERROR]
