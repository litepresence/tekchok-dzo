[PRACTICE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The bloodletting (gtar) instructions for treating eye diseases, headaches, and other conditions through specific channels constitute medical procedures that can be applied literally to treat physical ailments.

WHY IT ARISES:
The explicit medical application and treatment instructions invite literal interpretation as Tibetan medical practice. The practical utility obscures the subtle dimensions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen channel theory is reduced to medical technique. The profound relationship between subtle body and realization becomes merely alternative medicine.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Medical materialism replaces energetic understanding. Channels are treated only as surgical or therapeutic targets without recognition of their mind-nature.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The descriptions of sleeping postures (lion-like, elephant-like) are specific techniques that, when adopted correctly, will naturally produce luminosity experiences during sleep.

WHY IT ARISES:
The prescriptive language ("one should sleep like a lion") suggests causal technique. Postural yoga traditions encourage belief that correct position produces results.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a technique of correct sleeping position. The practitioner believes adopting the right posture will automatically generate realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Postural fixation develops. The practitioner becomes preoccupied with sleeping in correct positions, measuring success by dream experiences rather than waking recognition.

[PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The preparatory practices (loosening the body, oil massage, sun exposure) are merely psychological preparation—relaxation techniques that create receptive mind-states for subsequent practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of preparation and relaxation naturally suggests psychological readiness. Modern wellness frameworks interpret somatic preparation as stress-reduction.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen preparation becomes wellness routine. The profound energetic preparation of channels is reduced to relaxation and stress management.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Superficial relaxation replaces deep transformation. The practitioner experiences temporary calm without the radical reorganization of energetic patterns described.
