[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The correlation between sun's movement and breath count variations describes actual cosmological mechanics where celestial movements literally affect human respiration through energetic connections.

WHY IT ARISES:
The astronomical correlations suggest cosmic mechanics. Astrological frameworks encourage belief in celestial-terrestrial causation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes astrological determinism. The practitioner believes celestial movements mechanically control human energies.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
External dependence replaces inner recognition. The practitioner looks to external celestial conditions rather than recognizing inner nature.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of 360 days, 12 months, 720 hours, etc., as wind measurements describes fixed temporal realities that constitute the absolute structure of time.

WHY IT ARISES:
The calendar correlations suggest absolute temporal truths. The precise enumeration appears to reveal the true nature of time.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Time is reified into fixed measurable structure. The practitioner believes these calculations describe time's ultimate nature rather than conventional measurement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Temporal fixation obscures timelessness. The practitioner becomes obsessed with temporal calculations, missing the timeless dimension of mind.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DUALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The distinction between wisdom wind (ye shes rlung) ripening nirvana and karma wind (las rlung) ripening samsara describes two fundamentally different types of wind with different essences and destinies.

WHY IT ARISES:
The functional distinction suggests ontological difference. Dualistic habits interpret different functions as evidence of different essences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to eliminate karma wind and cultivate wisdom wind, treating them as actually separate entities.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Aversion to samsara-wind develops. The practitioner tries to get rid of ordinary breathing, believing it obstructs liberation.
