[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PURE LAND GEOGRAPHY]

MISREADING:
Pure land descriptions (Sukhavati, Akanishta) are accounts of actual locations one can travel to.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial imagery suggests geography. Desire for post-mortem destination.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Rebirth in pure land seen as physical relocation rather than shift in perception.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Phowa practice literalized as spatial transfer of consciousness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[REIFICATION ERROR] and [MEDITATIONISM ERROR].
