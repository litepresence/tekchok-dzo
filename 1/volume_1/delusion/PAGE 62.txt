ERROR TYPE 1: [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
The Sravaka vehicle is understood as a preliminary or inferior path to be transcended by superior practitioners, rather than recognizing it as a complete path appropriate for certain capacities.


WHY IT ARISES:
Hierarchical thinking assumes later = better. The practitioner wants to be 'advanced.' Vehicle numbering suggests ranking.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner dismisses Sravaka teachings as 'too basic' without having understood their profound purpose.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Foundation is skipped in rush to 'higher' vehicles. The practitioner becomes a Mahayana snob who lacks basic virtue.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [SUTRA DISMISSAL]



ERROR TYPE 2: [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
The Hinayana/Sravaka path is interpreted as requiring aeons of solitary practice, making it impractical for modern practitioners who therefore must skip to faster methods.


WHY IT ARISES:
Impatience and spiritual materialism. The practitioner wants quick results. 'Three countless aeons' seems impossibly long.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner rejects gradual paths in favor of 'direct' methods without proper foundation.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes superficial. The depth developed through gradual training is missing. 'Direct' methods fail due to lack of preparation.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] and [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY]



ERROR TYPE 3: [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
The distinction between Sravaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles is interpreted as establishing rigid personality types, rather than recognizing fluid categories based on capacity and inclination.


WHY IT ARISES:
Typology fascination. The practitioner wants to identify 'which one am I?' Personality tests are popular.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner becomes fixated on vehicle-identity. 'I am a Pratyekabuddha type' becomes self-limiting belief.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Flexibility is lost. The practitioner follows a rigid path based on initial assessment rather than responding to circumstances.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [PREPARATION PARALYSIS]



ERROR TYPE 4: [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
The 'result' of the Sravaka path—Arhatship—is understood as final extinction (nirvana with remainder) that represents a lower goal than Buddhahood.


WHY IT ARISES:
Mahayana superiority complex. The practitioner believes bigger goal = better. Compassion for all beings seems superior to personal liberation.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner looks down on Arhats as 'selfish' while lacking their actual attainment. Pride without substance.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The profound attainment of Sravaka path is dismissed. The practitioner criticizes what they have not understood.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]



ERROR TYPE 5: [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
The systematic presentation of vehicles suggests a curriculum where each must be studied in sequence before advancing, creating 'vehicle-completion' anxiety.


WHY IT ARISES:
Educational conditioning. The practitioner assumes structured progression. Fear of missing prerequisites.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner defers genuine recognition while working through vehicle-stages. The path becomes endless preparation.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Each vehicle becomes another box to check. Recognition is perpetually deferred until 'completion' of current vehicle.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PREPARATION PARALYSIS] and [PROGRESSION MYTH]

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS

PREVIOUS PAGE (61) CONTEXT:

Transition from previous section to current theme: vehicle_introduction


NEXT PAGE (63) ANTICIPATION:

Continuation of vehicle_introduction analysis


CRITICAL CONTINUITY POINT:

Maintain awareness across page boundaries. Do not treat pages as isolated units.


BLEED RISK:

Medium-High. Vehicle classification invites categorical fixation.
