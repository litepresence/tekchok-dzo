[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Accomplishment arises from oneself" (dngos grub rang las 'byung ba) is interpreted as self-power achievement—the practitioner develops magical abilities, siddhis, and powers through personal cultivation and mastery of techniques.

WHY IT ARISES:
The phrase "from oneself" triggers Western individualism and self-actualization frameworks. Achievement-oriented practitioners map this onto contemporary empowerment discourse. The mention of "surpassing the lower" invites hierarchical comparison and competitive spirituality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Siddhi-seeking replaces liberation as goal. The practitioner develops spiritual ambition, measuring success by extraordinary experiences, visions, or abilities. The path becomes accumulation of powers rather than exhaustion of confusion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Illusion body deity form" (sgyu lus lha'i skur gsal ba) is pursued as literal capacity to manifest physical transformation. The practitioner may develop somatic dissociation or psychotic breaks from confusing visualization with embodiment. Ethical boundaries collapse when "pure perception" justifies any behavior.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The non-duality of generation deity and self (bskyed rgyu'i lha dang bdag gnyis gnyis su med pa) is understood as fusion with a power-source rather than recognition of empty nature. This produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—identification with a grandiose self-image as "awakened being" while ordinary ego remains intact. The result is spiritual narcissism masquerading as realization.

[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Neither ultimate nor conventional name exists" (don dam dang kun rdzob kyi ming med pa) is interpreted as total linguistic negation—language is meaningless, all distinctions are false, and conceptual understanding is entirely obstructive.

WHY IT ARISES:
Postmodern skepticism and anti-intellectualism in spiritual communities converge here. The denial of names triggers rejection of all philosophical precision. Practitioners conflate "beyond concept" with "anti-conceptual" and "non-dual" with "undifferentiated mush."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The two truths framework collapses. The practitioner cannot navigate the dialectic between relative and ultimate, falling into either [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] (reifying "beyond concept" as a thing) or [NIHILISTIC ERROR] (rejecting all formulations). Scriptural study is abandoned as "intellectual," creating anti-learning bias.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Samaya becomes impossible to maintain because vows require conceptual engagement. The practitioner develops passive-aggressive resistance to discipline, claiming "nothing to keep." Communication with teachers degenerates because "nothing to say" replaces meaningful inquiry.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without linguistic precision, the practitioner cannot receive pointing-out instructions. They mistake conceptual non-engagement for direct recognition. Eventually they develop [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]—believing that silence equals profundity and that any articulate teaching is "conceptual fixation."
