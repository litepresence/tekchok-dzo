[PRACTICE ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The instructions for men and women to sleep on specific sides to activate particular channels describe mechanical techniques that, if performed correctly, will automatically cause channels to rise and become active.

WHY IT ARISES:
The gender-specific instructions and physiological descriptions suggest biomechanical causality. Readers habitually interpret such instructions as techniques producing guaranteed results.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a gendered technique of sleep posture. The practitioner believes correct side-sleeping will mechanically produce channel activation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Mechanistic causation replaces view-based recognition. The practitioner expects automatic results from correct technique rather than recognizing that channels are mind's display.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The technique of pressing channels with the ring finger, combined with specific breathing patterns, is a precise method that produces wisdom experiences when executed correctly with proper weight and timing.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed technical instructions (seven sesame seeds weight, gradually increasing) resemble precise protocols. Technical-minded readers treat these as mechanical procedures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes finger-pressure breathing technique. The practitioner believes correct execution of this method will produce enlightenment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Performance anxiety around technique develops. The practitioner worries about doing it "right," measuring success by phenomenological experiences.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of channel pulses ('gyu tshad) and their relationship to lifespan indicates that specific pulse rates are destiny—fixed measurements of how long one will live based on channel activity.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numerical correlations between pulse rates and lifespan suggest fatalistic determinism. The predictive framing invites interpretation as fortune-telling.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes fatalistic divination. The practitioner believes pulse measurements reveal fixed destiny rather than mutable energetic patterns.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deterministic despair or complacency develops. The practitioner resigns to "fated" lifespan or becomes anxious about pulse measurements.
