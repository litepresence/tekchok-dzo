[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of "thigle lamp" (thig le'i sgron ma) involving "round, red, clear" appearances and "body of five wisdoms" is interpreted as literal description of metaphysical entities that exist inside the body—actual spheres of light with specific colors and locations.

WHY IT ARISES:
Visualization practices condition literal interpretation of light-descriptions. "Thigle" triggers New Age energy-body concepts. Western practitioners assume all subtle-body language describes objectively real structures rather than recognition-conditions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pedagogical function of appearance-description is lost. Thigle becomes objective entity to locate rather than appearance-pattern to recognize. The practitioner treats all light-phenomena as confirming presence of metaphysical bodies, missing that these are recognition-contexts.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Five colors" become rainbow-body achievement markers. "Round and clear" become standards for correct visualization. The practitioner evaluates practice by phenomenological criteria—brightness, stability, color-purity—rather than recognition-clarity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding thigle as description of how recognition appears, the practitioner develops [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]—belief in substantial wisdom-bodies. They may collect elaborate maps of internal physiology, treating dzogchen as anatomy of light. The [REIFICATION ERROR] spreads—all subtle-body terminology becomes ontological claim. The practitioner searches for "real" thigles, missing that the pointing is toward recognizing the nature of whatever appears.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "space lamp" (dbyings kyi sgron ma) description of "blue vastness" (mthing ga khyab chen) expanding with fivefold display is interpreted as literal instruction to look for blue light or to cultivate experiences of spacious blue visualization.

WHY IT ARISES:
Kasina-style concentration practices validate seeking specific colors. "Blue" triggers color-association. Western practitioners familiar with visualization techniques assume dzogchen involves cultivating specific chromatic experiences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical function of color-description is lost. "Blue" becomes objective target rather than quality of unobstructed display. The practitioner attempts to generate blue experiences, treating the description as literal phenomenological prescription.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Holding the two body-aspects" (sku gnyis 'dzin) becomes dualistic achievement. "Manifesting the all-pervading bodhisattva form" (khyab bdag sems dpa'i gzugs brnyan) becomes visualization goal. The practitioner literalizes all metaphorical language.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Without understanding color-descriptions as recognition-pointers, the practitioner develops [PRACTICE ERROR]—chasing specific experiences. They may become fixated on achieving "correct" blue perception, believing this validates practice. The [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] spreads—assuming dzogchen requires particular perceptual content. The practitioner accumulates phenomenological achievements rather than recognition-stability.
