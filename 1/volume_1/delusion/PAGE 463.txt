[EXPERIENCE CHASING] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The detailed exposition of the lamp of pristine cognition (shes rab sgron ma) and thigle lamp is interpreted as a map of actual visual phenomena to be experienced in meditation. The practitioner believes these describe "things that appear" rather than ways of recognizing the nature of appearance.

WHY IT ARISES:
Visionary experience provides tangible evidence of "progress." The detailed descriptions of lights, colors, and forms trigger expectation-formation. The practitioner anticipates these visions as signs of realization rather than as natural expressions of awareness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Meditation becomes visionary pursuit. The practitioner cultivates techniques to "see" the five-colored lights and thigle formations described in the text. Recognition is replaced by vision-generation. The practitioner judges practice-success by visual intensity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Communities form around sharing and validating visions. "What did you see?" replaces "Did you recognize?" Teachers who can interpret visions gain authority. The simple recognition that these visions are self-appearance is lost in the excitement of experience.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] peaks in PAGE 464-468 as each lamp's visionary aspect is detailed. The practitioner accumulates ever-more-elaborate experiences. By PAGE 469-472's deviations, they are confused because their vision-chasing hasn't produced liberation. The colophon (PAGE 479) finds them addicted to light-shows.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The metaphor of the vajra fortress (rdo rje'i mkhar) and the description of "indestructible vajra" are interpreted as establishing the substantial existence of a "Dzogchen palace" in the subtle body. The practitioner believes in a literal vajra-citadel to be inhabited.

WHY IT ARISES:
Architectural metaphors trigger spatial reification. "Fortress" suggests protection and permanence, appealing to the ego's desire for security. The practitioner unconsciously constructs a "vajra self" to inhabit this vajra space.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pointing-out instruction becomes a real estate claim. The practitioner believes they "have" a vajra-fortress in their heart center. This subtle grasping at a special "Dzogchen space" obscures the recognition that all space is equally pristine cognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner feels threatened when their "vajra fortress" is challenged. They defend "their" realization as "the vajra realization." Sectarian divisions emerge around who has the "real" vajra-fortress experience.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 464-468's spatial metaphors (mandala, palace, dimension). Each becomes a "place" to find. By PAGE 476's comparison of deity yoga vs. dharmata, the practitioner cannot understand the difference because they have substantialized both. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "outside the fortress."

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The distinction between "outer visions" and "inner realization" is interpreted as establishing two classes of practitioners: those who "just see lights" (beginners) and those who "realize the vajra fortress" (advanced). This creates a hierarchy of lamp-realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
Hierarchical thinking assumes value-differences in experience. The text's technical sophistication signals "higher teaching," triggering elitist identification. The practitioner wants to be in the "realizes vajra fortress" category.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The equal nature of all appearances as self-radiance is lost. The practitioner believes some appearances (vajra fortress) are "more real" than others (ordinary vision). Grasping at "higher" experiences, they miss the recognition available in "lower" ones.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Teachers who emphasize ordinary awareness are dismissed as "not teaching the vajra path." Teachers who promise vajra-fortress experiences attract followings. The practitioner becomes a connoisseur of "high realization" claims.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] intensifies through PAGE 473-475 where capacity-types are discussed. The vajra-fortress becomes the mark of "superior capacity." By PAGE 476, the practitioner looks down on deity yoga practitioners as "not realizing the vajra fortress." The colophon (PAGE 479) is ignored as "for ordinary practitioners."

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The detailed specifications of the thigle lamp (round, red, clear) are interpreted as exact measurements that must be replicated precisely. The practitioner fears that seeing a blue thigle instead of red indicates deviation, or that irregular shape indicates wrong practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical precision triggers conformity-anxiety. The practitioner believes authentic realization matches textual description exactly. Any deviation from specification becomes evidence of error.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural self-expression is suffocated by specification-matching. The practitioner cannot recognize that thigle-description is pointing to a mode of recognition, not prescribing visual content. They miss the forest for one red round tree.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Orthodoxies form around "correct thigle appearance." Teachers who validate specific colors and shapes gain authority. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed if it doesn't match the manual. Practice becomes paint-by-numbers meditation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] becomes pathological by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of actual deviations. Having obsessed over thigle-color, the practitioner now obsesses over deviation-categories. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by orthodox anxiety, unable to recognize that awareness has no color.

[COMPLETION ANXIETY] [COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The elaborate visionary descriptions are seen as "the heart of the teaching" to be rushed through so the practitioner can claim "knowledge of the four lamps" and complete Volume 1. The poetry is skimmed for technical specifications.

WHY IT ARISES:
Poetic language triggers "get to the point" impatience. The practitioner wants extractable instructions, not evocative imagery. The approach to the volume's end accelerates "just finish it" psychology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound pointing-out hidden in the poetry is missed. The practitioner extracts "techniques" from visionary descriptions without absorbing their recognition-pointing. They have information about lamps without the lamp of recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner develops a utilitarian approach to all teachings: "What do I DO with this?" The aesthetic dimension of Dharma, which opens the heart, is dismissed as "decoration." Practice becomes dry technique.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COMPLETION ANXIETY] ensures PAGE 464-468's completion of the four lamps is rushed. The practitioner arrives at PAGE 469-472's deviations without having recognized the lamps' pointing. By PAGE 479, they "complete" Volume 1 with a collection of techniques but no recognition. The colophon is skipped as "just poetry."

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The visionary fixation on this page carries forward to PAGE 464-465's completion of the four lamps exposition. The practitioner continues chasing visual experiences through the remaining lamp descriptions. By PAGE 466-468's summary, they expect a "final vision." Arriving at PAGE 469-470's deviations, they are confused because visions haven't brought liberation. The similarity-but-mistaken pairs (PAGE 477-478) are reduced to "different visions," and the colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as irrelevant to their vision-quest.
