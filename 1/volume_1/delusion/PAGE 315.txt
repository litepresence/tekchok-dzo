[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The YAM syllable's movement and the breath's coming and going are interpreted as actual respiratory physiology rather than symbolic of conceptual mind's activity.

WHY IT ARISES:
Breath terminology suggests respiratory system. The movement imagery suggests physiological process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on how conceptual mind moves is replaced by breath control practice. The recognition of mind's nature is obscured.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner practices breath control rather than recognizing mind. Dzogchen's direct approach becomes pranayama.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [BREATH ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The five seed syllables (JRAM, KHAM, TAM, MAM, BYAM) as ornaments are understood as actual magical protections or empowerments rather than symbols of the skandhas' purification.

WHY IT ARISES:
Ornament imagery suggests decoration. Seed syllables suggest magical power.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on the five skandhas as the five buddhas is replaced by belief in magical syllables. The recognition of skandhas' nature is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks empowerment through syllables rather than recognition. The spontaneous purification is obscured by ritual.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EMPOWERMENT ERROR] and [RITUALIZATION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "foundation gnosis" (gzhi gnas kyi ye shes) is interpreted as actual state to achieve or base-consciousness to establish rather than the naturally present awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Foundation" suggests base or support. "Gnoses" suggests knowledge to acquire.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The naturally present awareness is replaced by something to achieve or establish. The immanence of realization is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks to establish or achieve foundation gnosis. The recognition of what already is becomes construction project.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ESTABLISHMENT ERROR] and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The four elements' channels with non-analyzed gnosis are interpreted as actual subtle body channels carrying specific types of consciousness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Channel-syllable correspondences suggest mapping system. The color-coding suggests categorical classification.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on the inseparability of appearance and awareness is replaced by categorical system. The non-dual recognition is lost in classification.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner learns classification system rather than recognizing awareness. The pointing to direct experience is obscured by categories.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CLASSIFICATION ERROR] and [DUALISTIC ERROR].
