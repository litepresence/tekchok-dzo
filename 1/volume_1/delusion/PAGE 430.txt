[COMPARATIVE ERROR] [HIERARCHICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18157-18163: The text emphasizes the superiority of Dzogchen's approach: "Whatever common vehicles do in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, they cannot transcend mind, while here..." This comparative language might breed sectarian arrogance.

WHY IT ARISES:
The explicit comparison and claim of superiority serves pedagogical purposes within the tradition. Without understanding this context, readers naturally form judgments about relative value.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The essential unity of all Buddhist paths is obscured. Different approaches appear as competitors rather than skillful means for different capacities and conditions.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners develop pride in their "superior" view while lacking its actual realization. Criticism of other traditions becomes a substitute for genuine recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SECTARIAN ERROR] and [PRIDE IN VIEW ERROR] where intellectual affiliation with Dzogchen substitutes for practice. Also [DIMINISHMENT ERROR] where essential foundational practices are dismissed.

[EMBODIMENT ERROR] [LOCALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 18172-18193: The text provides anatomical localization—mind's support is the "form aggregate, the upper body's chest," its abode is "between heart and lungs," etc. One might literalize these physical correspondences.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed anatomical description resembles medical or scientific knowledge. Specificity suggests accuracy; the traditional framework appears to map consciousness onto physical structures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The subtle body (lus) is confused with the gross physical body. What are correspondences in a subtle energetic system become literal claims about physiology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may fixate on physical locations ("the heart center," "the central channel") as if manipulating these structures produces realization, confusing somatic experience with recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SOMATIC FIXATION ERROR] where bodily sensations become goals, and [GEOGRAPHICAL ERROR] where awakening is sought in specific physical locations.
