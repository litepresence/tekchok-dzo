[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) exist as actual entities residing in specific physical channels, like water in pipes, and can be "accessed" or "activated" through proper manipulation of the throat chakra channels.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed anatomical description of channels and their correspondence to wisdoms suggests a literal, spatial relationship. Western readers habitually reify abstract qualities into concrete substances that can be located and manipulated.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a physicalist enterprise of "opening channels" to "release wisdoms." The practitioner seeks energetic experiences as proof of wisdom manifestation, confusing somatic sensation with realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fixation on physiological manipulation replaces view-based recognition. Practitioners pursue channel-opening techniques as ends in themselves, measuring progress by bodily sensations rather than diminishing fixation.

[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The throat chakra channel enumeration provides a comprehensive anatomical map that should be memorized and studied as essential theoretical knowledge for Dzogchen practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The scholastic precision and numbered lists suggest this is curriculum content to be mastered. Academic training primes readers to catalog and memorize such detailed enumerations as foundational knowledge.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Intellectual mastery of channel anatomy is mistaken for preparatory groundwork. The practitioner accumulates theoretical knowledge about channels without engaging in actual practice of recognizing mind nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pride in detailed knowledge becomes obstacle. Practitioners can describe channel systems eloquently while remaining fundamentally confused about the nature of mind that experiences these channels.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "vital points" (gnad) mentioned are specific physical locations that must be correctly identified through anatomical knowledge and then manipulated through techniques to produce realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
The term "vital point" in English carries connotations of acupressure or trigger points—physical locations that produce specific effects when stimulated. This medical/therapeutic framing transfers to the text.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a technique of finding and stimulating correct points in the body. The practitioner hunts for special spots that will "produce" enlightenment when properly pressed or opened.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Physical manipulation replaces view-based recognition. Somatic intervention is pursued as causal path to realization, contradicting the Dzogchen assertion that awakening is not produced by causes and conditions.
