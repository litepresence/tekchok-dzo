Different beings perceive different bindu sizes because of their karmic realm.

WHY IT ARISES:
Descriptive text invites literal interpretation. Six realms seem like places.

Believing bindu perception depends on rebirth status.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fatalism about present capacity for recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR].

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [COLOR VARIATION OBSTRUCTION]

MISREADING:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Identifying bindu by color characteristics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Sensory discrimination replacing recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation on signs.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [THUMB-PRESS PRODUCTION]

MISREADING:

Missing that gesture is support for natural recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EFFORT-EFFORTLESS DICHOTOMY]

MISREADING:
Effortful (rtsol bcas) and effortless (rtsol med) approaches are mutually exclusive alternatives.

WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Choosing one approach and rejecting the other.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that both are pedagogical pointers.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] hardened positions.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [CLEAR LIGHT AS EXPERIENCE]

MISREADING:
Clear light appearing at night (mtshan mo 'od gsal) is a special nocturnal experience.

WHY IT ARISES:

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Temporal conditioning of recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR].

[17151-17170]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [MIXED APPEARANCE LIBERATION]

MISREADING:

WHY IT ARISES:
"Liberated" suggests causal result. Description sounds like technique.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Seeking mixed appearance experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Chasing particular perceptual conditions.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation on signs.
