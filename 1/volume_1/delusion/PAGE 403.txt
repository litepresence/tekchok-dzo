[ONTOLOGICAL, ETERNALISTIC]

MISREADING:
Taking "ka dag dang lhun grub gnyis su med pa" (primordial purity and spontaneous presence non-dual) as describing two things that merge or become one, rather than one nature with two aspects.

WHY IT ARISES:
Grammatical structure suggests two entities ("gnyis") that are "med" (without), leading to the interpretation that they were dual and now are unified.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The inseparability of emptiness and appearance is misunderstood as a synthesis of opposites, missing that they have never been separate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner alternates between analytic meditation on emptiness and visualization practice, failing to recognize their simultaneous presence in every moment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of alternating practices, then to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through philosophical attempts to explain the synthesis, and finally to ETERNALISTIC view of an ultimately existent union.

[REIFICATION, EPISTEMIC]

MISREADING:
Treating the description of outer space ("phyi 'od kyi dbyings") as a reference to physical outer space or the sky that one should visualize or focus upon.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Nam mkha'" (space/sky) naturally refers to physical space in common usage. The technical Dzogchen usage as a metaphor for the empty-yet-luminous nature of mind requires specific transmission.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice degenerates into sky-gazing meditation focused on outer phenomena rather than recognizing inner space. The metaphor becomes the reality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students spend hours staring at the sky or visualizing space, missing that these are pointers to the nature of their own awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of technique fixation, then to ONTOLOGICAL confusion between outer and inner, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL failure as teachers emphasize technique over recognition.

[PRACTICE, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Understanding the progressive description of meditation (from mirror-like to body visions) as stages one must deliberately cultivate or force to arise.

WHY IT ARISES:
The sequential description ("dang po...de nas...") suggests a developmental process. Students feel they must make progress through these stages through effort.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural unfolding is replaced by achievement-oriented striving. The practitioner manipulates experience to produce signs of progress.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Frustration arises when visions don't unfold as described. Fake experiences may be reported. The natural clarity is obscured by manipulation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to EPISTEMIC delusion of confusing fabricated experience with genuine recognition, then to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of the path as personal achievement, and finally to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through rationalizing why practice "isn't working."

[EPISTEMIC, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "mthong dang goms pa'i ye shes" (wisdom of seeing and habituating) as two different wisdoms or types of knowledge that one develops.

WHY IT ARISES:
The conjunction "dang" (and) suggests two distinct items. Students think they must first develop "seeing wisdom" then separately develop "habituation wisdom."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The unity of recognition and stabilization is split into sequential achievements. Habituation is misunderstood as prolonged exposure to an experience rather than deepening recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice alternates between "insight sessions" and "stabilization sessions," failing to integrate them. The natural continuity of awareness is disrupted.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of session-based practice, then to ONTOLOGICAL dualism of insight vs. calm, and finally to PEDAGOGICAL transmission of split practices.
