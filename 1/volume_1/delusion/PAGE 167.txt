[PHYSICAL MARK ERROR] [BODY SIGN ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the description of Padmasambhava's marks ("sacred this mole a mark possess nose tip possess") as establishing that enlightened teachers can be identified by physical characteristics, leading to physiognomic charlatanism.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific physical descriptions trigger the belief that spiritual attainment manifests in recognizable bodily signs. The desire for certainty supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Physical appearance becomes a criterion for spiritual authority. False teachers claim marks; true teachers are doubted.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching that form is emptiness is contradicted. Body obsession develops.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about the emptiness of form are interpreted through physical essentialism.

[RELIC ERROR] [MATERIALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the descriptions of parinirvāṇa phenomena (relics, light rays, earthquakes) as establishing the physical reality of post-death manifestations, literalizing the symbolism.

WHY IT ARISES:
The vivid physical imagery triggers literalist readings. The desire for proof of transcendence supports believing in physical relics.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic dimension of relics is lost. Physical objects become fetishized.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pilgrimage and relic worship displace practice. Commercialization of sacred objects develops.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that the nature is immaterial is lost in material obsessions.

[EMANATION ERROR] [MULTIPLICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the statement that Vimalamitra will benefit beings through "emanation many" as establishing that enlightened teachers can multiply themselves, creating expectations of miraculous appearances.

WHY IT ARISES:
The multiplication language triggers supernaturalist readings. The desire for continued access to teachers supports this.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The metaphorical dimension of emanation is lost. Physical appearances are awaited.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Disappointment when emanations don't appear. False claims of being emanations proliferate.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle that the teacher is one's own nature is entirely missed.
