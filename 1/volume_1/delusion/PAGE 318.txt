[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "four elements" ('byung bzhi) are interpreted as actual physical elements or subtle energies to balance rather than symbolic of cognitive functions.

WHY IT ARISES:
Elemental terminology suggests physics. The four-element system suggests cosmological framework.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on the nature of mind is replaced by elemental theory. The pointing to immediate experience is obscured by physics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner studies elements rather than recognizing mind. The simplicity of Dzogchen is lost in elemental complexity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ELEMENTAL ERROR] and [COSMOLOGICAL ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The channels (rtsa) and winds (rlung) are understood as actual subtle body structures requiring purification rather than symbols for conceptual processes.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Channel" suggests conduit. "Wind" suggests energy. Subtle body vocabulary suggests anatomy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition of conceptual mind's nature is replaced by subtle body purification. Direct recognition becomes energy work.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner manipulates channels and winds rather than recognizing mind. Dzogchen's simplicity is obscured by technique.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBTLE BODY ERROR] and [TECHNIQUE ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The seed syllables are interpreted as actual creative sounds or mantras with magical power rather than symbols for recognition of elemental nature.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Seed syllable" suggests generative power. Mantra traditions support this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition of elemental nature is replaced by mantra recitation. The direct pointing becomes vocal practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner recites syllables rather than recognizing nature. The immediacy of Dzogchen is lost in vocalization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MANTRA ERROR] and [VOCALIZATION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "skandhas" (phung po) becoming "buddha" is understood as actual transformation of aggregates or achievement of enlightened form.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Become buddha" suggests transformation. Aggregate terminology suggests constituent parts.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that skandhas are already display of awareness is replaced by belief in transformation. The immanence is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks to transform aggregates rather than recognizing their nature. The "already accomplished" is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TRANSFORMATION ERROR] and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].
