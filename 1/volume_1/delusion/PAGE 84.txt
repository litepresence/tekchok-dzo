MISREADING:
Emptiness means nothing exists at all, leading to nihilistic view.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Empty" interpreted as "non-existent" in absolute sense.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Rejection of all phenomena as illusory in dismissive sense.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Moral nihilism; no need for practice since nothing exists.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].
