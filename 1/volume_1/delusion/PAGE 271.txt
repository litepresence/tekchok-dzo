[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text continues with negations: primordially pure by primordial non-existence, spontaneously accomplished naturally, unceasing display, Buddha-fields, appearances. A reader might think: "This is showing that everything is primordially pure and spontaneously present - it's all the display of the base, inherently perfect."

WHY IT ARISES:
After extensive negation, we want something positive. "Primordially pure" and "spontaneously accomplished" offer positive content. We interpret this as describing the true, positive nature of reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies "primordial purity" and "spontaneous accomplishment" as the positive nature of reality. These become the "real" qualities of the base that survive all negation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Attributing inherent purity to all phenomena
2. Seeking experiences of "primordial purity"
3. Justifying present conditions as "spontaneously perfect"
4. Missing that purity is recognition, not quality

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ETERNALISTIC ERROR (inherent purity) → REIFICATION ERROR (purity as quality) → PRACTICE ERROR (false completion). The practitioner adopts inherent perfection.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text presents detailed arguments and scriptural citations about the base, its aspects, and its relationship to appearance. A reader might think: "This is rigorous philosophical theology establishing the correct view through reasoning and scriptural authority."

WHY IT ARISES:
We value systematic argumentation supported by authoritative sources. The combination of logic and scripture seems to establish truth definitively. This is how Western academic theology works.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner approaches Dzogchen as philosophical theology - a system to be mastered through study of arguments and scriptures. Intellectual mastery substitutes for recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Treating Dzogchen as academic subject
2. Mastering arguments without embodying insight
3. Competing in philosophical sophistication
4. Missing that pointing is not proving

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (Dzogchen scholasticism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (knowledge as wisdom) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (academic transmission). The tradition becomes academic.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the nature's display as uninterrupted, vast, without increase or decrease, empty or full, with clarity, the place where many kayas arise. A reader might think: "This is describing the actual nature of display - it's a vast, clear, uninterrupted field of wisdom-light where kayas manifest."

WHY IT ARISES:
Vivid imagery creates strong impressions. We naturally visualize a "vast expanse" of clarity and light. This seems like a description of what the base actually looks like or is like.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the display as a luminous field or expanse. This becomes the sought-after vision - the vast clear light from which kayas emerge.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking visions of vast clear light
2. Reifying display as a metaphysical space
3. Creating dualism: display realm vs ordinary world
4. Missing that display is unceasing manifestation, not a place

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (display as realm) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking display visions) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (luminous metaphysics). The practitioner seeks the display realm.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text continues with extensive quotations from tantras, detailed explanations of aspects, modes of arising, and philosophical arguments. A reader might think: "This is the complete Dzogchen philosophical system - all the details, all the sources, all the arguments comprehensively presented."

WHY IT ARISES:
Comprehensive presentation suggests completeness. We assume that if we study all these details, we'll understand Dzogchen fully. Academic accumulation masquerades as wisdom.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats Dzogchen as a comprehensive philosophical system to be mastered. The goal becomes knowing all the details, sources, and arguments.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Accumulating Dzogchen "knowledge"
2. Comparing different textual presentations
3. Competing in comprehensive understanding
4. Missing that one pointing is enough

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (comprehensive accumulation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (detail as depth) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching comprehensive systems). The tradition becomes encyclopedic.
