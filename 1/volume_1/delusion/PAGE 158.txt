[PHYSIOGNOMIC ERROR] [BODY ESSENTIALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader interprets the descriptions of persecutors' physical characteristics (six fingers, blue extra tooth, black mole) as establishing that evil persons have identifiable physical marks, confusing moral qualities with bodily form.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed physical descriptions create vivid imagery that readers habitually literalize. Pre-modern physiognomic traditions support reading bodies as signs of character.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Physical appearance becomes a basis for moral judgment. Discrimination based on bodily difference is validated.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The teaching that form is emptiness is contradicted by essentialist readings of physical characteristics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about the purity of appearance are undermined by physical prejudice.

[GEOGRAPHICAL ERROR] [DIRECTIONAL OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader treats the directional prophecies (west, north, north-east, center, east, south) as establishing that certain locations are spiritually significant or dangerous, literalizing sacred geography.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic coverage of directions combined with specific place names triggers cartographic thinking. The mind naturalizes space as spiritually charged.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Spiritual value becomes territorialized. The universality of mind nature is obscured by geographical preoccupations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about being in the "right" place or avoiding "wrong" places rather than recognizing mind wherever one is.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle of "mind itself is the place of awakening" is entirely missed.

[POLITICAL ERROR] [VIOLENCE LEGITIMATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the descriptions of persecution, factional quarrels, and teaching suppression as justifying defensive or aggressive political action to "protect" the dharma, externalizing the spiritual battle.

WHY IT ARISES:
The narrative structure of persecution and resistance naturally triggers political identifications. The "defense of dharma" narrative has been historically used to justify violence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Internal spiritual work is replaced by external political engagement. The distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is lost in political struggle.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Institutional power is pursued as dharma activity. Opposition is demonized.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
All subsequent teachings about non-duality are subordinated to partisan commitments.
