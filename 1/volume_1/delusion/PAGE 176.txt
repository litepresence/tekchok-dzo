[FEAR ERROR] [OBSTACLE OBSESSION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the description of defects from not obtaining empowerment (fear, wandering in intermediate state, obstacles) as establishing that empowerment is the only protection against terrifying fates, creating desperate dependency.

WHY IT ARISES:
The fear-inducing language triggers protective desperation. The desire for safety supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that nature is self-protected is abandoned. The reader desperately pursues empowerments.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Exploitation by those offering empowerments. The path becomes fear-driven.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The confidence of inherent completeness is entirely lost.

[PLACE OBSESSION ERROR] [EXTERNALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader takes the detailed descriptions of suitable places (secluded, auspicious ground, element-aligned) as establishing that location determines success, becoming obsessed with finding the "right" place.

WHY IT ARISES:
The specific criteria trigger perfectionism about location. The desire for optimal conditions supports this.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice is deferred until the perfect place is found. Present circumstances are rejected.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Wandering in search of ideal places. The recognition that mind is the place is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The teaching that buddhahood is realized wherever one is is entirely forgotten.

[DANGER OBSESSION ERROR] [PROTECTION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Reader becomes preoccupied with avoiding places with carnivores, snakes, and foxes, developing anxiety about environmental dangers rather than confidence in practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The mention of dangers triggers protective anxiety. The survival instinct supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes oriented toward safety rather than recognition. Fear replaces confidence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Excessive caution prevents retreat practice. The recognition of mind's protection is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
The principle that obstacles are self-liberated is entirely missed.
