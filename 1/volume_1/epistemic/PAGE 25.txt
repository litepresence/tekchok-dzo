[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: TEMPORAL REIFICATION]

<The degenerative cosmology—80,000-year lifespan diminishing through kalpa cycles to ten-year minimum—presents standard Buddhist eschatology from *Cakkavatti Sutta* sources. The five degenerations (*snyigs ma lnga*) of lifespan, views, afflictions, beings, and eon operate within causal vehicle karmic framework. Risk: Literalizing temporal devolution as historical prediction rather than recognition of impermanence (*mi rtag pa*) patterns.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<The Maitreya prophesy and reversal narrative (moral restoration, lifespan extension) employs sems-side teleological framework within Buddhist eschatology. This gradualist restoration model operates at provisional level, preparing practitioners for definitive recognition that transcend such temporal cycling. The "fortunate aeon" (*bskal pa bzang po*) concept remains within conventional auspiciousness framework.>
