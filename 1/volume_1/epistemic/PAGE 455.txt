<Svābhāvikakāya as the unity prevents reification. Without it, one might think dharmakāya is somewhere, saṃbhogakāya elsewhere, nirmāṇakāya elsewhere still. Svābhāvikakāya shows they are indivisible—three aspects, one nature, like a single face with three eyes.>

<Jñānakāya as wisdom-aspect emphasizes that the kāyas are not physical forms but knowing. The body of wisdom is wisdom itself—not wisdom in a body, but wisdom as body, wisdom as display, wisdom as manifestation.>
