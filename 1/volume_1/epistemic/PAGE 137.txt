[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Seed syllables (*sa bon*) detailed exposition: oṃ as five wisdoms, āḥ as five Buddha bodies, hūṃ as nondual mind-essence. Three seed syllables (*yi ge 'bru gsum*) as condensation of entire path—oṃ body, āḥ speech, hūṃ mind; or oṃ dharmakāya, āḥ saṃbhogakāya, hūṃ nirmāṇakāya. The tantric principle: complex teachings compressed into single syllable for meditative accessibility. In recitation practice (*bzlas pa*), seeds function as anchors for visualization and recognition. This is transformative technology, not linguistic reductionism.>
