[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Maturation distinctions and bindu dynamics: "Maturation's definite distinctions" (*sm in pa'i nges pa'i khyad par*) describe how subtle body structures differentiate during gestation and practice. The text moves between describing natural embryological processes and tantric contemplative anatomy. "Full and empty" (*gang ba dang stong pa*) refer to bindu (*thig le*) states—full bindus contain essence; empty bindus are essence dissolved into space. These are experiential markers, not fluid quantities. The practitioner learns to recognize and work with these states through completion stage techniques. Critical: Descriptive phenomenology, not prescriptive chemistry.>
