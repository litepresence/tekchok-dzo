[RISK: LITERALIZATION]

<Sanskrit alphabet exposition: vowels (*dbyangs yig*) as dharmatā basis, consonants (*gzhung yig*) as manifestation. The sixteen vowels from *Mu tig phreng ba*: a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, ṛ, ṝ, ḷ, ḹ, e, ai, o, au, aṃ, aḥ. Each has symbolic correspondence: *a* as unborn (*skye med*), *i* as entirely free from elaboration, etc. Risk: Taking these as literal phonetic properties rather than recognition-pointers. In tantra, seed syllables (*sa bon*) are vibrational patterns that resonate with specific wisdom aspects—not magical formulas but sound-dharmatā correspondence.>
