<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*shin tu spros med kyi dbang bzhi* — four very without elaboration empowerments, *las mtha' 'grol* — liberating karma extremes, *ru shan 'byed pa* — distinguishing samsara-nirvana, *chos nyid las 'gro sa med* — no going from dharmatā)
- Hermeneutical precision: The "very without elaboration" (*shin tu spros med*) empowerments liberate karma extremes (*las mtha' 'grol*) through: (*spros bcas*) purifying karma, lines, letters, concepts; (*spros med*) arriving at meaning directly, no going from *chos nyid*; (*shin tu spros med*) entering emptiness maṇḍala, three gates not entering three realms; (*rab tu spros med*) purifying six collections. The "completely without elaboration" (*rab tu spros med*) empowerments liberate attachment-aversion through: (*spros bcas*) self-liberation of concepts; (*spros med*) showing nirmāṇakāya field; (*shin tu spros med*) showing saṃbhogakāya field; (*rab tu spros med*) prophesying dharmakāya.
- Temporal warnings: The liberating is recognition, not temporal process.
- Ontological warnings: The fields (*zhing*) and activities (*'phrin las*) are not ontological locations but recognition-modes. To reify them contradicts *ka dag*.
- Pedagogical purpose: The framework exhaustively maps empowerment functions. However, ultimate recognition transcends all karma and purification—*ma byas pa* (unfabricated) nature.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: ACTIVITY REIFICATION] — Treating four activities as real functions. [RISK: PURIFICATION TEMPORALIZATION] — Believing six collections are progressively purified.>
