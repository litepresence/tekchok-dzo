[219-248]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

This passage operates definitively from the Dzogchen perspective of primordial awareness as spontaneously manifesting display. Key indicators include: "self-appearing," "not made by anyone" (sus kyang byas pa med pa), "uncompounded" ('dus ma byas), and "self-arisen" (rang byung).

The technical Dzogchen vocabulary (bindu, self-arisen six letters, Dharmata Samantabhadra's enjoyment) represents descriptions of awareness's own nature from the perspective of that nature, not phenomenological reports from a subject.

The extensive negations — unmoving, non-arising, non-abiding, non-taking, non-rejecting — function as [NEGATIONAL CLEARING], removing false ascriptions rather than asserting positive attributes. These are not claims about a "thing" that lacks these characteristics, but pointers beyond conceptual categories altogether.

Risk of reification: The vivid description of pure fields, mandalas, and Buddha-forms may be mistaken for assertions about external metaphysical realities rather than the self-luminous display of awareness.

[COMMENTARY CROSS-REFERENCE]

The commentary on this section (lines 219-228) emphasizes "self-arisen" and "not created" — confirming the Dzogchen epistemic frame. The commentary's warning that "Your world right now is the Buddha-field" without grasping/aversion indicates the passage functions as pointing-out instruction rather than cosmological assertion.
