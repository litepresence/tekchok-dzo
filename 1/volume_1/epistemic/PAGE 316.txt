<Five elements embryology: The text describes how the five elements (*'byung ba lnga*)—earth, water, fire, wind, space—gradually manifest during conception and gestation. "Father's consciousness drawn inward by the five castes' power" (*pha'i shes pa yang nang du 'dren pa*) refers to tantric five-family (*rigs lnga*) symbolism pervading embryonic development. This is contemplative embryology, not medical science—describing how consciousness coagulates into form through elemental interaction. The subtle body (*lus phra mo*) framework understands embodiment as energetic crystallization. Practice implication: By knowing how form arises, one can reverse the process through completion stage techniques.>
