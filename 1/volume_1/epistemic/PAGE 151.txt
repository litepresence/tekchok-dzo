[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[ROOT SAMAYAS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Root samayas (*rtsa ba'i dam tshig*)—five fundamental pledges: not to abandon guru, yidam, mantra, sangha, phenomenal existence as wisdom-display. These are not prohibitions but recognitions: guru is awareness, yidam is appearance, mantra is sound-reality, sangha is recognition-community, phenomena are dharmatā. Breaking samaya means forgetting recognition; maintaining samaya means sustaining recognition. The tantric framework uses commitment-structure to support recognition; Dzogchen recognizes commitment as spontaneous (*lhun grub*) quality of awareness.>
