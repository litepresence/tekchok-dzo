<Continuation of symbolic narrative (*brda' chos*): "Old woman with burial mound" (*rgan mo'i ling tog can*) represents co-emergent ignorance (*lhan skyes ma rig pa*) arising simultaneously with awareness. The "two sons fleeing to sunny place" (*bu gnyis nyi ma can du bros*) illustrates the duality of grasping at subject-object. These narratives function as recognition-devices—when one sees through the metaphor, the underlying pattern of delusion (*'khrul pa*) becomes visible in one's own experience. The Yacha (*ya cha*) commentary voice marks transitions between symbolic and explanatory registers.>
