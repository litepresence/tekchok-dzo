[DELUSION AS RECOGNITION]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The *'khrul pa* (delusion) category presents three systems: (1) delusion as basis-reversal (*gzhir zlog pa*), (2) delusion self-removed (*rang sol*) as dharmatā recognition, (3) delusion-basis pierced (*khog sgor*) as delusion-samsara continuum severed. First system's essence: delusion-root ignorance's basis established as three realms' samsara; recognizing it as self liberates ignorance-root. The phrase *rang du ded pas ma rig pa rtsad bcad* (directing to self cuts ignorance) indicates *rig pa* recognizing *ma rig pa* (non-recognition) as its own display—not destroying delusion but recognizing its nature.>

[DELUSION-REALITY NONDUALITY]

<The three subsystems progressively: (1) delusion root cut therefore samsara/nirvana view reversed—never experienced delusion (*'khrul ma myong*) from primordial; (2) delusion self-removed therefore non-deluded dharmatā recognized—affliction basis emptied, virtue/non-virtue continuum severed; (3) delusion-basis pierced therefore delusion-samsara continuum severed—falling/basis empty, fabrication not found, basis examined. The phrase *'khrul ma 'khrul las 'das* (transcended delusion/non-delusion) indicates recognition beyond both delusion and its correction.>
