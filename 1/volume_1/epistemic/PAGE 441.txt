<In the eye dwells the four lamps. In the citadel dwells the kāya (*sku*). In the four channels dwells the bindu (*thig le*). In the conch-shell house dwells the light rays (*'od zer*). In the bhṛguta dwells the awareness-display of the vajra snake-noose (*rdo rje lu gu rgyud*). From *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs*: Ah, rigpa's wisdom itself abides in all buddhas and sentient beings in the manner of unchanging abiding. This is the mode of abiding.>

<Citadel (*tsitta*) precious palace, precious channel palace, completely pure conch-shell palace, bhṛguta palace, great palace—these are not physical locations but energetic topology descriptions for practice. In these great palaces, rigpa's essence appears as display (*rtsal*). Some dwell as kāya, some as bindu, some as light rays, some as snake-noose emerging—thus showing the abiding summary. Buddhas abiding from the beginning, sentient beings all possessing this—the Victorious Ones excellently explained.>

<Kāya, snake-noose, sphere (*dbyings*), and wisdom's meaning: rigpa and non-rigpa are appearance itself, transcending both action and agent's extremes. Vastness itself radiates like kāya. Luminosity itself arises like light. Emptiness itself radiates like rays. Buddha and sentient being are not separate rigpas—appearance itself is shown as separate. The kāya's characteristics: unchanging, luminous, empty, free from concept.>
