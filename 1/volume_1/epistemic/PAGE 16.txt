[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA RANGSHAR CITATION]
[PRIMORDIAL LOSS NARRATIVE]

<Quotation from *Rig pa rang shar chen po'i rgyud* (Great Self-Arising Awareness Tantra): "At beginningless time, my precious jewel lost, by jewel-lost self-nature, from darkness-appearance interval came, by four conditions concept impure, to Tuṣita upper-chamber land came, support is pure lotus, secret mantra great teaching established, near retinue is Akṣobhya, tantra king Thalgyur taught." This encapsulates Dzogchen soteriology: primordial ignorance (*mun pa*), delusion process (*'khrul pa*), path of return through tantric practice (*gsang sngags*).>
