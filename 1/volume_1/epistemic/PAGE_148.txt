[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MASTERY AND STABILIZATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE DEVELOPMENT]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the progression from initial recognition to complete mastery in Dzogchen practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, while recognition is immediate, its stabilization takes time, and complete mastery is the dissolution of all obscurations.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding progression. The progression is not from one state to another but from momentary recognition to continuous recognition. The natural state itself never changes; what changes is the duration and stability of recognition.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that mastery is not the acquisition of new qualities but the full revelation of what has always been present. The kayas and wisdoms are not created but revealed as recognition stabilizes.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in progression is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of practice and development, ultimately there is no progression—the natural state is already complete.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes that mastery is the continuous flow (rgyun chags) of recognition without distraction. This is not a new state but the natural state fully revealed and stabilized.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to develop mastery. Through continuous practice, recognition naturally stabilizes. The four visions of thodgal manifest, the kayas are revealed, and spontaneous activity naturally benefits beings.

The section discusses the signs of mastery. For the practitioner, mastery is uninterrupted recognition; for others, it appears as effortless benefit for beings. The rainbow body is the ultimate sign of complete mastery.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for mastery, recognizing it as the definitive fruition. While conventional practice creates conditions, the ultimate mastery is the natural state fully revealed.

The section thus establishes the path from recognition to mastery—not a journey to a new state but the stabilization of what has always been present, the full revelation of primordial purity and spontaneous perfection.
