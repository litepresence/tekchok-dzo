Completes enumerations of clairvoyances totaling 2,360 ground qualities, 660 wisdom activities, and 3,120 dharmic synonyms—the transformation-display distinctions (*rnam par 'phrul pa'i dbye ba*) of the Vajra-holder ground. These vast numbers demonstrate tantric completeness while Dzogchen recognizes them as spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*). The text transitions to samaya (*dam tshig*), identified as the essential basis (*gzhi gal po che*) for secret mantra entry. Samaya serves as the definitive abode (*gnas*) for empowerment, not moral commandments but the non-deceptive nature of mind itself.
