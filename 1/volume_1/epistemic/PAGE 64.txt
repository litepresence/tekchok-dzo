[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BUDDHIST VEHICLE INTRODUCTION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: DEFINITIVE FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section marks the crucial transition from the refutation of non-Buddhist views to the positive presentation of Buddhist vehicles (nang pa'i theg pa). The distinction between Buddhist and non-Buddhist (phyi rol pa) is not merely sociological or cultural but represents fundamentally different orientations—toward liberation versus toward worldly aims. From the Dzogchen perspective, this distinction operates at the level of conventional truth while being transcended in the ultimate recognition of rig pa.

The epistemic framework here employs [DZOGCHEN VIEW] as the hermeneutical apex from which all other views are understood. While respecting the gradual path of the nine vehicles, Dzogchen recognizes that ultimately there is nothing to achieve and no one to achieve it—all phenomena are primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously perfect (lhun grub). This is not nihilism but the recognition of the ground's natural state.

The transition represents a shift from negation to affirmation—from clearing away wrong views to presenting the authentic path. However, the [ULTIMATE TRUTH] perspective maintains that even the authentic path is a conventional designation (tha snyad), a skillful means (thabs) to guide beings toward recognition. The path itself dissolves in the recognition of the goal.

The distinction between Buddhist and non-Buddhist is made at the level of refuge (skyabs 'gro). Buddhists take refuge in the Three Jewels—Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha—while non-Buddhists take refuge in worldly gods, philosophical systems, or their own ego. Yet from the [DEFINITIVE MEANING] perspective, even the Three Jewels are expressions of rig pa, the nature of mind itself.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the framework for the nine vehicles that will follow. Each vehicle represents a progressively refined understanding and practice, culminating in Atiyoga. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] encompasses all vehicles without being limited by any, recognizing that they are all expressions of the same natural state viewed from different perspectives.

The section introduces the causal-result vehicle (rgyu 'bras theg pa) distinction that will organize the presentation of the nine vehicles. The first three vehicles (Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) are causal vehicles (rgyu'i theg pa), accumulating causes for future enlightenment. The six inner vehicles are result vehicles ('bras bu'i theg pa), recognizing enlightenment as already present. This distinction is crucial for understanding Dzogchen's unique position.

The epistemic stance maintains that while the framework of nine vehicles is pedagogically necessary, from the ultimate perspective no vehicles exist. There is only the recognition of rig pa, beyond all categorization. The vehicles are like rungs on a ladder—necessary for climbing but not the destination itself.

The section thus establishes the hermeneutical key for understanding the entire presentation: all teachings are skillful means oriented toward the recognition of the natural state, with Dzogchen representing the most direct pointing to this recognition.
