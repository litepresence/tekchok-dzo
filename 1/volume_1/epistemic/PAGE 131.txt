[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[CONSONANT CLASSIFICATION]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Consonants (*gzhung yig*) as thirty-four grouped letters: gutturals (*ka* group), palatals (*ca* group), cerebrals (*ṭa* group), dentals (*ta* group), labials (*pa* group), semi-vowels (*ya, ra, la, va*), sibilants (*śa, ṣa, sa, ha*). Each group corresponds to elemental and wisdom configurations. The tantric view: consonants as "hard" manifestation, vowels as "soft" space—together forming complete mantra-science (*sngags kyi bshad pa*). This is Abhidharmic cosmology overlaid with tantric meaning: sounds as building blocks of both external world and internal realization.>
