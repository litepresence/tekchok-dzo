[DZOGCHEN VIEW – IMMEDIACY OF RECOGNITION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: INSTANTANEOUS REALIZATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the immediacy of Dzogchen recognition—liberation is not a future achievement but immediately present when recognition occurs. From the Dzogchen perspective, the path is not a journey in time but a recognition in this very moment.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding immediacy. Unlike gradual paths that project liberation into the future after lengthy practice, Dzogchen recognizes that the nature of mind is already liberated. Recognition in this moment is complete liberation.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that there is no "becoming" enlightened—there is only recognizing enlightenment. The delay imposed by gradual practice is a pedagogical device, not an ontological necessity. For those with sharp faculties, recognition is immediate and complete.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in immediacy is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of paths and progress, ultimately there is nowhere to go and nothing to become. The natural state is already complete; recognition reveals this completion.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: liberation is not achieved through causes and conditions but recognized as primordially present. All practices that seem to lead to liberation are actually methods of recognition, not causes of a result.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to access this immediacy. Through direct introduction and sustained recognition, the practitioner realizes that enlightenment is not elsewhere but here and now. Every moment of recognition is complete liberation.

The section discusses the relationship between gradual and sudden approaches. While gradual methods are valid for those who need them, Dzogchen emphasizes the sudden recognition that transcends gradualism. This is not impatience but recognition of the nature of reality.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for immediacy, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional methods take time, the definitive truth is immediately accessible.

The section thus establishes the immediacy of Dzogchen recognition—liberation is not a future goal but the present reality, accessible in this very moment through direct recognition of the natural state.
