<Kun gzhi and dharmakāya—one basis, two aspects. Kun gzhi with ignorance: samsara. Dharmakāya with recognition: liberation. The basis is the same; the difference is knowing or not knowing. This is the *Thal 'gyur* decisive point: kun gzhi and dharmakāya's crucial point.>

<Kun gzhi: basis of all, container of habitual tendencies, like a pond. Dharmakāya: pure of all, transcending mind's objects. From *Mu tig phreng ba*: Kun gzhi is accumulation, dharmakāya outflows exhausted. Empty yet luminous, luminous yet pervading. Uncontaminated by thought, awakened upon remembering. Free from elaboration, like space pervading and empty.>
