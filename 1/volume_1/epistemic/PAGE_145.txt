[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DEDICATION AND PRAYER]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: COMPASSIONATE ACTIVITY]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]

This section presents the Dzogchen approach to dedication (bsngo ba) and prayer (smon lam)—the expressions of compassion that direct the merit of practice toward the welfare of all beings. From the Dzogchen perspective, these are both conventional practices and natural expressions of recognition.

The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. Provisionally, dedication and prayer are deliberate acts of compassion. Ultimately, they are the spontaneous expression of the natural state's compassionate energy (thugs rje).

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that in the natural state, there is no separation between self and others, no distinction between practitioner and beings to benefit. Dedication is the conventional expression of this non-dual compassion; ultimately, all beings are already in the state of liberation.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in dedication is the recognition that while conventionally we pray for beings' welfare and dedicate merit, ultimately there are no beings separate from the natural state, and no merit to dedicate.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: dedication in Dzogchen is the recognition that all is primordially pure. We dedicate not to create something new but to recognize what is already present—the spontaneous perfection of all beings.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how dedication occurs in Dzogchen. Whether in formal prayer or spontaneous thought, the recognition of the natural state includes all beings. This is dedication without a dedicator, merit without accumulation.

The section discusses the relationship between dedication and recognition. For those practicing conventionally, dedication develops bodhicitta. For those who have recognized, dedication is the natural overflow of compassion. Both are valid; recognition transforms dedication.

The epistemic stance maintains that while dedication is [PROVISIONAL MEANING] in its conventional form, the recognition of all beings as spontaneously perfect is [NGES DON].

The section thus establishes dedication and prayer in Dzogchen—conventionally the expression of compassion, ultimately the spontaneous display of the natural state's compassionate energy for the benefit of all.
