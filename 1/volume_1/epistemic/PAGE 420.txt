[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Mind (*sems*) as accumulation (*'dus tshogs*) arises with defilement (*dri ma*)—the alaya-holding mind and others become the number of defilements. Sentient beings are so-called because they possess this mind that obscures rigpa. When that mind is freed from rigpa—exhausted, pure, expanded—this is called buddha because rigpa is free from defilement. From *Mu tig phreng ba*: When mind is freed, the defilements of all embodied beings are exhausted.>

<That mind accumulates karma, performing samsara's actions from one delusion to the next. This mind comprises grasping mind that apprehends objects through signs, names, and generalities, and holding mind that investigates and analyzes particular characteristics. The saying "grasping at objects is mind" refers to this dualistic structure. The *Thun mong* scriptures state: When mind ceases, the kāya manifests directly.>

[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Wisdom (*ye shes*) abides like space, free from elaboration, together with the oceanic assembly of wisdom—source and origin of the buddha's immeasurable qualities—dwelling constantly in dharmakāya's expanse, burning all afflictions and habitual tendencies like fire. This is not a state to be achieved but the natural radiance of awareness when mind's obscurations are recognized as adventitious (*glo bur*).>
