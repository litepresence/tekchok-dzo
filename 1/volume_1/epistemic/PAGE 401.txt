<The bindu (*thig le*) already present, not awaiting future attainment. The peacock's tail (*rma bya'i mdongs*) spreads spontaneously as awareness-display—not a vision to be cultivated but recognition of what already manifests. Patrul's polemic cuts through the *sems*-side expectation that wisdom (*ye shes*) arrives from elsewhere. The five-colored light (*'od lnga*) appears when the chain-circle (*lu gu rgyud*) is recognized as one's own rigpa, not through gradual fabrication.>

[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

<The twelve similes (*mthun dpe bcu gnyis*) serve as recognition-pointers, not descriptive categories to be memorized. Vulture eye, fish eye, cat eye, thief eye—these are not exotic metaphors but direct instructions to observe how awareness-display (*snang rig*) manifests in one's own experience. The snake-noose fence (*lu gu rgyud kyi ra ba*) is the bindu's light-house (*'od khyim*), already moving slightly in the treasury-brow (*mdzod spu*) space. Risk: Conceptualizing these as objects of meditation rather than self-recognized display.>

<The completely pure sphere lamp (*dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*) reveals wisdom-kāya (*ye shes sku*) already present in the citadel of awareness (*tsitta*). Five colors (*kha dog lnga*) spreading like a rainbow (*'ja' tshon*) in the vast blue sky (*mthing ga khyab pa chen po*)—this is not a visual attainment but the natural display of awareness-emptiness (*rig stong*) when recognition dawns. The eleven aspects (*bcu gcig*) are pedagogical scaffolding; the lamp itself requires no student.>
