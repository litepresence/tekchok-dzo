[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[TEXTUAL COMPLETION SUMMARY]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL SYNTHESIS]

<Completion (*mjug bsdu*) of tantra section: general explanation (*spyi bshad*) and individual meaning (*bye don*) distinctions. Explanation traditions condensed into three from *Rig pa rang grol*: word meaning establishes terms, historical meaning (*lo rgyus*) satisfies minds, meaning meaning establishes view. Without explanation, flaw of not understanding terms; without instruction tantras, flaw like farmer without harvest; without intent tantras, flaw like blind person entering city. These establish textual completeness—each component necessary for full pedagogical function, not ontological necessity.>
