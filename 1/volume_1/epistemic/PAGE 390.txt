[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Afflicted mind's movements: "Desire, dullness, anger, attachment, clinging, not knowing, etc.'s cause, condition, essence, particular arising" (*'dod pa dang rmugs pa dang sdang pa dang chags pa dang zhen pa dang mi shes pa la sogs pa'i rgyu dang rkyen dang ngo bo dang bye brag tu byung ba*)—sems-side description of afflictive patterns. "Far-reaching dharmatā direct perception's appearance seeing, view holding as self-power, mind turns back" (*rgyang zhags chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba mthong bas grub mtha' 'dod rgyal du 'dzin pa las blo ldog*)—recognition turns mind back from philosophical positions (*grub mtha'*). The Five Lamps allow direct perception of dharmatā, transcending all views. This is view-transcending view—using structure to go beyond structure.>
