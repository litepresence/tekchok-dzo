[TEXTUAL LINEAGE AND AUTHORITY]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL FRAMEWORK]

<Textual lineage (*lung*) and authority: Tantric scriptures (*rgyud*) transmitted from dharmakāya through saṃbhogakāya to nirmāṇakāya masters. The lineage (*brgyud pa*) is recognition-transmission, not merely historical succession. Key tantras cited: *Guhyagarbha*, *Kun byed rgyal po*, *Mu tig phreng ba*—Nyingma canonical texts. The authority is recognition-function—texts that point effectively to recognition are authoritative. From Dzogchen view, all texts are *rig pa*'s self-expression; authority is intrinsic recognition-ability, not external validation.>
