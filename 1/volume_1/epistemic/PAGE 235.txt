[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

Maps the five colors to five buddha families and their fields (*zhing khams*), presenting a structured cosmology of realization. The Dharma-body (*chos sku*) of Samantabhadra (*kun tu bzang po*) abides in the unconditioned (*'dus ma byas*) dharmadhatu (*chos kyi dbyings*), free from temporal change ('*pho 'gyur med*). The Enjoyment-body (*longs sku*) configuration with its thirty-twofold structure represents the tantric vision of complete manifestation. These descriptions risk being mistaken for literal cosmology; they actually depict the atemporal (*dus gnyis med*) nature of awareness-display. The five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*) express ineffability (*brjod du med pa*) and spontaneous presence (*lhun gyis grub pa*).
