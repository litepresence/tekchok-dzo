<Rigpa not going under conditions' power. Nature clear, not separate from clarity. Spontaneously arisen and liberated, abiding without border. Arisen-feeling thought objects distracted—ordinary self-face's distinction exists. This is the difference between rigpa and mind—one self-liberated, one bound by distraction.>

<Fourteenth: prajñā completed as display, conceptual thought spreading to objects—two outwardly appearing similar. Prajñā clear and spontaneous, straight direct cutting, no going-returning circling. Thought outwardly object-holding, returning inward one-after-one, grasping-holding self-face gone—distinction exists.>

<The crucial distinction: prajñā and thought both manifest, both clear, both knowing. But prajñā is self-liberated, thought is self-binding. The difference is not in what appears but in recognition—one recognized as awareness-display, one mistaken as independent reality.>
