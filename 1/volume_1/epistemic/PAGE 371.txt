[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Merit and siddhi examination: "Merit" (*bsod nams*) and "supreme and common siddhis examine" (*mchog dang thun mong dngos grub brtag*) frame the soteriological goal—tantric practice produces both spiritual and worldly accomplishments. This is results-oriented spirituality: practice → purification → abilities → benefit beings. The Six Yogas are structured toward these ends. However, Dzogchen view requires navigation: These results are byproducts, not goals. Focusing on siddhis (*dngos grub*) creates new attachment. The supreme siddhi (*mchog gi dngos grub*) is recognition itself; common siddhis are secondary. Risk: Practicing for powers rather than liberation.>
