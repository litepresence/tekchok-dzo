[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DEFINITIVE MEANING ESTABLISHED]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Definitive meaning (*nges don*) established: Dzogchen is *nges don* par excellence—direct pointing to awareness-nature without veil of method. All other teachings are *drang don* (provisional) from this perspective—not false, but indirect. The definitive is not superior but more direct. Provisional teachings prepare capacity; definitive teaching fulfills capacity. This is hermeneutical claim, not sectarian superiority. All vehicles lead to recognition; Dzogchen is recognition itself. The Treasury establishes this definitively.>
