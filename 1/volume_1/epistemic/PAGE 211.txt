<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*sku gsum sa* — three kāya grounds, *rtsa mig* — channel aperture, *rlung 'dres* — wind mixing, *snyom 'jug* — samādhi, *dri chu* — female fluid, *gnad* — crucial point)
- Hermeneutical precision: Integration of view recognition with energetic practice—arranging (*'gram*) *rtsa mig* (channel aperture) and mixing (*'dres pa*) winds to grow body strength and join with ultimate bodhicitta. The "IG" fist and upward eye-turning technique blocks (*khrem*) the channel aperture to prevent wind dissipation. Recognition of obstacles (*gegs*) from improper practice: *thig le* straying causing illness, vomiting, and energy imbalance.
- Temporal warnings: The obstacles are temporary energetic imbalances, not permanent damage.
- Ontological warnings: The "channel aperture" is energetic configuration, not anatomical structure. To reify it as fixed entity contradicts Dzogchen's view of *rlung* as *rdzun pa* (illusory).
- Pedagogical purpose: The techniques teach energetic containment for supporting non-dual recognition. However, ultimate *don dam byang chub kyi sems* (ultimate bodhicitta) is not produced by technique—it is *ka dag* (primordially pure).
- Risk explanation: [RISK: OBSTACLE REIFICATION] — Believing energetic imbalances are serious dangers rather than practice feedback. [RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION] — Focusing on blocking apertures rather than recognizing *rig pa*.>

[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*las kyi phyag rgya* — action seal, *bde ba lam du byed* — making bliss the path, *byin rlabs* — blessing, *sku gsung thugs* — body speech mind)
- Hermeneutical precision: Warning against improper reliance on action seal (*las kyi phyag rgya*) without knowing crucial points—risks *thig le* straying, disease, and imbalance. The "OM AH HUM" sound emission at specific moments invokes three kāya blessing (*byin rlabs*) entering. The student's body becoming lama's body nature indicates transmission of recognition, not magical transformation.
- Temporal warnings: The "first lama body mix" indicates recognition transmission, not literal merging.
- Ontological warnings: The three kāya blessing is not external force entering but recognition of innate *sku gsum*. To view it as external blessing contradicts Dzogchen's view of *rang byung* (self-arisen).
- Pedagogical purpose: The warnings protect against superficial practice. The techniques point to recognition that *sku gsung thugs* are spontaneously present (*lhun grub*), not obtained from outside.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: MAGICAL THINKING] — Believing that sounds and mixing mechanically produce realization. [RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM] — Treating lama's blessing as external transfer rather than recognition facilitation.>
