<Like oil in sesame seeds, like butter in milk—wisdom pervades body. Not that wisdom is extracted from body, but that body is wisdom's display. The analogy points to inseparability, not containment. Sesame oil is not separate from sesame; butter is not other than milk.>

<Body's radiance and splendor—wisdom's moisture pervades. This is not metaphorical but literal in the sense of appearance-display. The body's vitality, clarity, presence—these are wisdom's manifestations, not separate from awareness.>
