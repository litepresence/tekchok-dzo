[RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION]
[RISK: EMPOWERMENT REIFICATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*spros bcas* — with elaboration, *spros med* — without elaboration, *shin tu spros med* — very without elaboration, *rab tu spros med* — completely without elaboration, *dbang rin po che* — precious empowerment)
- Hermeneutical precision: Detailed structure of four empowerments by elaboration level. (*spros bcas*) outer: body-speech-mind seed syllable purification; inner: *bum pa'i gnas* (vase abode) certainty of unborn phenomena; secret: self-liberation without characteristics; utterly complete: realization of all phenomena empty and selfless. (*spros med*) outer: three kāya seed syllables; inner: *chos thams cad skye ba med pa* (all phenomena unborn); secret: *shar grol ris med* (arising liberation without outline); utterly complete: *rtogs pa khyad par can* (special realization).
- Temporal warnings: The elaboration levels are recognition-modes, not sequential attainments.
- Ontological warnings: The "without elaboration" levels risk being reified as superior states. In *ka dag*, all levels are equally primordially pure—no hierarchy.
- Pedagogical purpose: The framework accommodates practitioners needing graduated approach. However, ultimate recognition transcends all elaboration distinctions.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION] — Believing one must progress through elaboration levels. [RISK: EMPOWERMENT REIFICATION] — Treating empowerments as received from outside rather than recognition-activations.>
