[323-327] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE] [DECLARATIVE FINALITY] <RISK: EXISTENTIAL PRIDE> Presents primordial wisdom as inherently perfect and self-manifesting, establishing the ground of Rigpa as the foundational epistemological stance from which all relative phenomena are revealed as expressions of intrinsic purity.

[328-334] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] [INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY] Details the transformative framework of body-speech-mind kayas, presenting them as vessels for transformative practice where marks and signs serve as catalytic elements for recognition of one's innate buddhahood.

[335-340] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE] [DECLARATIVE FINALITY] Articulates the non-dual nature of appearance and emptiness through paradoxical formulations that dissolve subject-object boundaries, establishing direct introduction to Rigpa as the ultimate epistemic authority.

[341-349] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] [UPĀYA STATEMENT] Uses conventional language about practices and applications as skillful means for beings who have not yet recognized their primordial state, demonstrating the upāya dimension of graduated paths while maintaining the ground as already perfect.

[323-349] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] [DECLARATIVE FINALITY] <RISK: TECHNICAL ACQUISITION> The detailed enumeration of transformative elements risks being misunderstood as progressive acquisition rather than revelation of what is already present, requiring careful framing to prevent reification.
