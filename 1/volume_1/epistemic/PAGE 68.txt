[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KRIYA TANTRA EXPOSTION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: OUTER TANTRA]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section presents Kriya tantra (bya rgyud), the first of the three outer tantras, characterized by its emphasis on ritual purity, external worship, and the view of the deity as superior while the practitioner remains impure and inferior. From the Dzogchen perspective, Kriya represents the most dualistic approach within tantra, yet it serves as an essential entry point for practitioners who require structured discipline and clear distinctions.

The epistemic framework here employs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] as the organizing principle. Kriya's dualistic view—pure deity worshipped by impure practitioner—functions as a skillful means to purify ordinary perception. The elaborate rituals of bathing, purification, and external offerings create a sacred space that gradually transforms the practitioner's relationship to phenomena.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes Kriya as a valid but provisional approach. While the deity is visualized externally and worshipped through ritual, Dzogchen understands that the deity is ultimately the expression of the practitioner's own awareness. The separation between worshipper and worshipped is a pedagogical device, not ultimate truth.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is particularly evident in Kriya. Conventionally, the deity exists externally, rituals have efficacy, and purity must be maintained through careful observance. Ultimately, all phenomena are primordially pure (ka dag), and the rituals function to reveal this purity rather than create it.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes Kriya's specific perspective: the deity is the lord, the practitioner is the servant; purity is achieved through ritual, not recognized as natural; results come gradually through practice. This view is appropriate for practitioners of lesser capacity who need clear structure and external support.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes Kriya's distinctive practices: extensive purification rituals, external offerings, mantra recitation, and deity visualization. The practitioner maintains ritual purity through bathing, clean clothes, and vegetarian diet. The deity is visualized in front, above, or on the crown, emphasizing the hierarchical relationship.

The section emphasizes Kriya's focus on the four purities (dag pa bzhi): pure place, pure body, pure resources, and pure deeds. These are maintained through elaborate ritual observance, creating a protected environment for practice. The emphasis on external purity reflects the understanding that ordinary perception is impure and must be transformed.

The epistemic stance maintains [DRANG DON] for Kriya, recognizing its provisional nature while respecting its function. For practitioners who require structured discipline and clear distinctions, Kriya provides a stable foundation. However, it remains a stepping stone toward the more subtle approaches of higher tantras.

The section thus presents Kriya as the foundation of tantric practice, establishing the basic framework of deity yoga and ritual purity that will be refined and internalized in subsequent vehicles. The practitioner learns to view phenomena as sacred, preparing for the recognition that all phenomena are inherently pure.
