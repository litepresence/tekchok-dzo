<Appearance light's rim round shining: "Appearance light's rim round shining" (*snang ba 'od kyi mu khyud zlum por shar ba*) describes the Four Lamps' manifestation—light appearing with circular rim, not mere empty sky. This is *pratyakṣa* (direct perception)—recognition-device appearing spontaneously. "Sequence applying to practice" (*rim pas nyams len dang sbyar na*) indicates graduated integration of recognition into practice. Even after recognition, stabilizing (*brtan pa*) and familiarization (*goms pa*) are needed. Recognition (*ngo shes*) is sudden; maturation (*sm in pa*) is gradual. This prevents error of thinking recognition alone suffices without stabilization.>
