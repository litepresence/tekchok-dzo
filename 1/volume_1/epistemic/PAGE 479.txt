[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Final summary: The ground is primordially pure buddha-nature (*sangs rgyas snying po*)—not potential to be realized but recognition of what already is. The path is wisdom-rigpa (*ye shes rig pa*) appearing in direct perception—without meditation, without cultivation, without progress. The fruition is self-liberation (*rang grol*) of all appearance—samsara and nirvāṇa inseparable from the beginning.>

[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Integration of all vehicles (*theg pa*)—the nine yānas progressively leading to Dzogchen's recognition. Sūtra establishing emptiness (*stong pa nyid*), tantra revealing method (*thabs*), Dzogchen pointing to awareness (*rig pa*) as the path itself. The five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) are not five different wisdoms achieved but five aspects of single awareness. The thirteen kāyas (*sku bcu gsum*) are not thirteen different bodies but thirteen aspects of recognition-display.>

<Final instruction: Do not seek elsewhere. The bindu already present. The peacock's tail already spread. The five lights already shining. The three kāyas already manifest. Recognition is the only distinction between wandering in samsara and abiding in liberation. Volume 1 of the Precious Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle complete. Volume 2—direct crossing (*thod rgal*)—follows.>
