[DZOGCHEN VIEW – UNCHANGING NATURE]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: IMMUTABLE REALITY]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the unchanging nature ('gyur med) of the natural state as the ground of Dzogchen view. From the Dzogchen perspective, while all conditioned phenomena change, the nature of mind itself is immutable—never deluded, never enlightened, always as it is.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding immutability. Unlike the changing phenomena of samsara, the natural state does not transform, improve, or deteriorate. It is not affected by delusion or enhanced by realization; it simply remains as it is.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that all change occurs within the natural state, not to it. Thoughts arise and dissolve, emotions come and go, experiences shift and change, but awareness itself remains unchanged throughout. This unchanging awareness is the ground of Dzogchen.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in immutability is the recognition that while conventionally we experience change, ultimately there is an unchanging ground that remains unaffected by all change.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the nature of mind is unchanging ('gyur med), unborn (skye med), and unceasing ('gag med). These three characteristics describe the immutable reality that underlies all apparent change.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to recognize this immutability. While phenomena change, notice that the awareness within which they change does not. This unchanging awareness is the nature of mind.

The section discusses the relationship between immutability and practice. Practice does not change or improve the nature of mind; it reveals what has always been present. The changes that occur in practice are in the recognition, not in the nature itself.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for immutability, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings describe transformation and development, the ultimate reality is unchanging.

The section thus establishes the unchanging nature of the natural state—the immutable ground that remains unaffected by all the changes of samsara and nirvana, delusion and enlightenment.
