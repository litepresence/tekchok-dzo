[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE PERFECTIONS STRUCTURE]
[SYSTEMATIC MULTIPLICATION]

<Each emanation maintains five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*): teacher (*ston pa*), place (*gnas*), retinue (*'khor*), teaching (*chos*), time (*dus*). The twelve-fold multiplication (*lan bcu gnyis*) of five-fold structure creates pedagogical comprehensiveness. This is *thabs* (skillful means) diversity—not twelve separate Buddhas but display-modes of single recognition adapting to twelve types of trainees. Risk: Literalizing as historical persons.>
