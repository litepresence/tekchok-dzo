[426-460] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] [UPĀYA STATEMENT] The extensive catalog of teachings across different lifetimes and abodes demonstrates the upāya dimension of Buddhist pedagogy, where the same wisdom is presented through various vehicles appropriate to different beings' capacities and circumstances.

[426-460] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE] [DECLARATIVE FINALITY] <RISK: TEMPORAL REIFICATION> The temporal specifications (lifetimes measured in millions of years) risk being understood as literal temporal progressions rather than symbolic representations of the immediacy of primordial wisdom beyond time.

[398-460] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMIVE VIEW] [DECLARATIVE FINALITY] All described manifestations—Vajra holder in various abodes, protective activities, diverse Buddha forms—are expressions of the same transformative wisdom, not separate entities but different aspects of the single Vajra reality.
