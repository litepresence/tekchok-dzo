[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[FOUR EMPOWERMENTS SYNTHESIS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Four empowerments synthesis: progressively subtle purification. Vase—body/deity; Secret—speech/bliss; Wisdom-knowledge—mind/non-dual; Word—nature of mind/nonduality. Each empowerment builds on previous, creating comprehensive transformation. The progression mirrors tantric path: external (vase), internal (secret), secret (wisdom), suchness (word). From Dzogchen view, all four are contained in single *rig pa* recognition, but tantric framework requires staged unfolding. This is pedagogical scaffold—necessary for those needing structure, transcended by those with capacity for direct recognition.>
