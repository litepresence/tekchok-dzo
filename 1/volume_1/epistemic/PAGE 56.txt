[1801-1830]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The six afflictions (*nyon mongs pa drug*) analysis from *Nyi zla kha sbyor*—delusion (*ma rig pa*) as basis-delusion grasping thought-aspect, ignorance (*gti mug*) as wisdom-aspect delusion—presents Dzogchen phenomenology at sems-side level. The rope-snake (*thag pa sbrul*) and mirage-water (*smig rgyu chu*) analogies prepare for definitive recognition. Risk: Stopping at analogy-level understanding without direct awareness recognition.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The *Mu tig phreng ba* citation establishes definitive Dzogchen view: "External-internal container-contained dualistically formed" (*phyi nang snod bcud gnyis su chags*) through apprehending non-existent as existent. The two truths (*bden pa gnyis*) as merely conventional world-appearance (*'jig rten kun rdzog tsam*) points to ultimate nature beyond elaboration.>
