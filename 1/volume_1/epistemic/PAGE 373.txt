<Four times sequence application: "Applying according to four times' sequence" (*dus bzhi'i rim pa ltar sbyar*) correlates practice with daily cycles—dawn, noon, dusk, midnight. Each time has dominant element and optimal practice. "Earth wind's power and radiance" (*sa'i rlung gi stobs dang mdangs*) describes how earth-element wind manifests physically as strength and vitality. This is temporal-energetic astrology—practice harmonized with natural cycles. The subtle body exists in time as well as space; optimal practice aligns with cosmic rhythms. This reflects tantric view of body-cosmos correspondence at temporal level.>
