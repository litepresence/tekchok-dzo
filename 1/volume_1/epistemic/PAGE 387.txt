<Body speech mind three basis correcting: "First, body speech mind three basis correcting, therefore space called" (*sngon du lus ngag yid gsum gzhi 'chos pas na dbyings zhes bya*)—Dzogchen view of purification. "Correcting" (*'chos pa*) here means recognizing primordial purity, not improving impurity. Space (*dbyings*) indicates dharmadhātu—field of all possibilities, never stained. "Thus Four Lamps without, samsara-nirvana's connection not cut" (*de ltar sgron ma bzhi med na 'khor 'das kyi 'brel pa mi chod*)—without recognizing the Four Lamps, nonduality of samsara-nirvana remains obscured. The Lamps are not causes of liberation; they are recognition of what was never bound.>
