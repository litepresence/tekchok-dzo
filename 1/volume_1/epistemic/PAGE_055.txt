[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section introduces the Bodhisattva vehicle (byang chub sems dpa'i theg pa), representing the culmination of the causal vehicles (rgyu'i theg pa). The Bodhisattva path emphasizes the altruistic motivation of bodhicitta—the aspiration to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings—and the practice of the six perfections (paramitas). From the Dzogchen perspective, this vehicle represents the highest expression of [PROVISIONAL MEANING], preparing the practitioner for the result vehicles that follow.

The epistemic framework distinguishes between [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING], with the Bodhisattva vehicle positioned as the most profound of the provisional teachings. Unlike the Sravaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles, the Bodhisattva path aims at the realization of both personal and phenomenal selflessness (gang zag dang chos kyi bdag med gnyis ka), approaching the emptiness of all phenomena without exception.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] encompasses yet transcends the Bodhisattva vehicle, recognizing that while bodhicitta and the perfections are essential practices, they are ultimately expressions of the natural state rather than causes that produce an effect. The distinction between causal vehicles (rgyu'i theg pa) and result vehicles ('bras bu'i theg pa) becomes crucial here—the Bodhisattva path accumulates causes for enlightenment, while Dzogchen recognizes enlightenment as already present.

The stratification uses [VIEW ASSERTION] to present the Bodhisattva's philosophical position on emptiness, while [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] appears in the discussion of the six perfections and the ten stages (sa bcu). The Bodhisattva's view of emptiness, while profound, remains conceptual in nature—an intellectual understanding that must be transcended in the direct recognition of rig pa.

The [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] dichotomy is central to the Bodhisattva's approach. The Prajnaparamita literature, which this vehicle embodies, systematically deconstructs all conceptual proliferations regarding emptiness. Yet from the Dzogchen standpoint, even this sophisticated analysis remains within the domain of conceptual mind (yid), whereas rig pa is beyond all mental elaboration.

The viewpoint tag [NGES DON] begins to emerge as the Bodhisattva vehicle prepares the ground for the tantric and Dzogchen teachings that follow, pointing toward the direct recognition of the natural state. The ten stages represent progressive refinements of view and meditation, dissolving increasingly subtle obscurations. However, the definitive Dzogchen view holds that these stages are themselves conventional designations—rig pa is never stained and never purified, never deluded and never enlightened, beyond all progression and regression.

The section thus functions as a bridge between the sutric and tantric approaches, showing how the highest philosophical understanding of the causal vehicles naturally leads to the direct methods of the result vehicles. The Bodhisattva's realization that "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" foreshadows the Dzogchen recognition that all phenomena are primordially pure.
