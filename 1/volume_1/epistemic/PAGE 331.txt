[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Generation stage completion: "Generation stage meditation accomplishing the body's attachment-creating definite activity" (*bskyed rim bs goms pas lus kyi chags byed nges pa'i las spyod byed du 'grub*) marks transition from completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) back to generation stage (*bskyed rim*) integration. The text describes how 666 channel structures (*drug brgya drug cu rtsa drug*) mature through practice. This is tantric transformative technology—systematically working with body to transform mind. Risk: Taking practice descriptions as ontological claims about reality. The numbers (666) are symbolic/mnemonic, not anatomical facts. Practice creates transformation; recognition reveals transformation was unnecessary.>
