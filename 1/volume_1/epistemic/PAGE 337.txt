[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Five aggregates from elements: "From blood, perception" (*khrag las 'du shes*) continues the elemental-aggregate correspondence: flesh → form, blood → perception, and so on. This systematic mapping allows tantric practitioners to target specific aggregates for transformation. "First, three" (*dang po la gsum*) introduces the three main channels section. The text transitions from embryological description to explicit subtle body instruction. This marks the beginning of direct *rtsa rlung thig le* teaching—channels (*rtsa*), winds (*rlung*), and essences (*thig le*) as the three pillars of completion stage practice. Critical shift: From describing how embodiment happens to prescribing how to work with embodiment.>
