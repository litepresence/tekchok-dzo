Lines 12001-12003: "Base-appear see-of instant liberate-of method, Liberate-from space in abide-of method, That from other benefit do-of method"—method of instantly liberating by seeing base-appear; method of abiding in space liberated from; method of benefiting others from that. **Three methods**:
1. Seeing base-appearance → instant liberation
2. Abiding in liberated space
3. Benefiting others

Lines 12004-12020: First method detailed: "First as-for, Primordial space from, Inner-tone outward arise, Compassion awareness self non-awareness-of aspect arise merely that base-appear in face outward look-by-means-of, Self-of appear self-is know inward realize-of instant in, Non-awareness self pure-from base-appear spontaneous-of appear-method self-dissolve pure ground in self-place abide, That also instant in self-appear in distinction divide-by-means-of, Instant in Buddha, Before coming-of teacher, Resultant-Reversal from, Thus samsara-nirvana primordial final from, Buddha delusion-as non-become-by-means-of, Base from transcend-of sense by, Self-appear nature non-existent know, Thought-investigate mind plural outward not-lose, Move self-rope decide, Say and"—as for first: from primordial space; inner-tone outward arise; merely awareness aspect of self non-awareness arising, that base-appear, by means of looking face outward; in instant of realizing inward, knowing self-of appear is self; from pure non-awareness self, base-appear spontaneous appear-method self-dissolving, abiding in pure ground self-place; also that instant in self-appear, by means of dividing distinction; instant in Buddha; before coming of teacher; from Resultant Reversal (*'bras bu ldog pa*); thus from primordial final of samsara-nirvana; by means of non-becoming Buddha as delusion; by sense of transcending from base; knowing self-appear nature non-existent; not losing outward thought-investigate mind plural; decide move self-rope; and say. **Instant liberation process**: inner-tone arises outward → look at base-appear face → realize self-appear is self → dissolves spontaneously → abides in pure ground → instant Buddha.
