<Father-mother syllable dynamics: "Father's bindu syllables OṀ AḤ HUṀ with sound emerging, dissolving into mother's mandala" (*yab kyi thig le yi ge oM aH hUM gi sgra dang bcas pa 'thon te yum gyi mkhar thim*) describes the union of method (*thabs*) and wisdom (*shes rab*) at the subtle level. The three syllables represent body, speech, mind of enlightened form. This is tantric sexual symbolism describing energetic union, not biological process. The "sound" (*sgra*) indicates vibrational dimension of bindu movement. Practitioner visualizes this to transform ordinary embodiment into enlightened embodiment. Critical: Symbolic technology for transformation, not literal physiology.>
