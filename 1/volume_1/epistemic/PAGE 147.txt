[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[WORD EMPOWERMENT - TSHIG DBANG]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Fourth empowerment: Word empowerment (*tshig dbang*) points directly to nature of mind (*sems nyid*). This is closest to Dzogchen—direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) rather than gradual transformation. The "word" (*tshig*) is pointing-out instruction, not philosophical description. Critical risk: Confusing word empowerment's pointing with Dzogchen's recognition—they are formally similar but functionally different. In tantra, word empowerment culminates staged path; in Dzogchen, recognition is ground. The text navigates this carefully: word empowerment as tantric culmination that prepares for or is equivalent to Dzogchen introduction.>
