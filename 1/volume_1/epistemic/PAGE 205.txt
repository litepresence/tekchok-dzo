<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*seng ge'i 'phar stabs* — lion leap stance, *lag zhabs* — hand foot, *tsigs* — joints, *sbyar ba* — joining, *rtsa ba gcod* — cutting root, *sku gsum* — three bodies, *bde ba* — bliss)
- Hermeneutical precision: Advanced *rtsa bskyed* (channel-raising) methodology using *seng ge'i 'phar stabs* (lion leap stance) with curled joints (*tsigs bsdoms pa*) to cut samsara's root (*'khor ba'i rtsa ba gcod*). The threefold retention points—root (*rtsa ba* = dharmakāya), waist (*rked pa* = saṃbhogakāya), tip (*rtse mo* = nirmāṇakāya)—represent *sku gsum* integration through energetic containment. The OM-AH-HUM seed syllables create vajra nature (*rdo rje'i rang bzhin*) of body, speech, and mind.
- Temporal warnings: The three kāya experiences are simultaneous aspects, not sequential attainments.
- Ontological warnings: The three bodies are not ontologically distinct entities but recognition-modes of *rig pa*. To treat them as separately obtainable contradicts Dzogchen's view of *ngo bo gcig* (single essence).
- Pedagogical purpose: The technique integrates energetic control with *sku gsum* recognition. However, the ultimate "three bodies" are spontaneously present (*lhun grub*)—not produced by technique but recognized through *rig pa*.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: KĀYA REIFICATION] — Treating three kāya as separate ontological entities rather than aspects of single awareness-display. [RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION] — Believing that stance and retention mechanically produce three kāya realization.>

[RISK: GRADUALISM]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*yi ge gsum* — three syllables, *sku gsung thugs* — body speech mind, *rdo rje* — vajra, *bde gsum* — three blisses, *phyag rgya chen po* — great seal/mahāmudrā)
- Hermeneutical precision: Integration of three syllables (OM-AH-HUM) with three vajras (body-speech-mind) and three seals (*phyag rgya gsum*)—producing gradual (*rim gyis*) and simultaneous (*cig car*) accomplishment. The "mother E" (*ma yi E*) creates lotus (*pad+ma*), HRĪH creates bell (*dril bu*), HA creates pistil (*ge sar*)—establishing *bde chen* (great bliss) as *sku gsung thugs* (three vajra) seal.
- Temporal warnings: "Gradual and simultaneous" (*rim gyis dang cig car*) indicates flexibility of approach, not temporal stages.
- Ontological warnings: The three blisses (*bde gsum*) are not ontologically distinct but modalities of single *ye shes kyi bde ba* (wisdom bliss). To practice them as separate acquisitions is gradualist (*rim gyis pa*) approach, not Dzogchen's *cig car* (simultaneous) recognition.
- Pedagogical purpose: The technique accommodates practitioners needing graduated framework. However, the ultimate "great seal" (*phyag rgya chen po*) is recognition of *sems nyid* (mind itself) as *chos nyid*—beyond all syllables, seals, and techniques.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: GRADUALISM] — Treating gradual accomplishment as necessary path rather than pedagogical accommodation. Dzogchen recognizes *lhun grub* (spontaneously perfect) without sequential acquisition.>
