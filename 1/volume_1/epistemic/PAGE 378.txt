[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Race, body, wisdom, light, color clarity: "Doing that, individual race, body, wisdom, light, color clarity cannot be transcended" (*de byas pas so so'i rigs dang sku dang ye shes dang 'od dang kha dog tu gsal ba las 'da' mi srid*) describes tantric mandala mechanics—specific karmic patterns (*rigs*) manifest specific enlightened forms. This is not essentialism—it's skillful means framework. Different practitioners connect with different Buddha families based on temperament and karma. "Action winds' particularities, twelve are twelve moving actions" (*las rlung gi bye brag las bcu gnyis ni 'gyus pa'i byed las bcu gnyis*) classifies functional winds. These are descriptive categories, not ontological claims.>
