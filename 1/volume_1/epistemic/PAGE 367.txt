<Crown top straight and eye sharpness: "Crown top straight" (*spyi bo'i gtsug ni drang po na*) describes optimal crown channel alignment. "This gall eye makes sharp" (*di gtar mig ni rno bar byed*) claims that working with specific channels enhances sensory acuity. This is subtle body ophthalmology—energetic interventions for physical senses. The crown center (*spyi gtsug*) correlates with consciousness clarity; proper alignment enhances perception. These are observable effects from dedicated practice: stabilized attention, purified channels, and concentrated bindus naturally improve sensory clarity. This is not supernatural—it's refined physiology through energetic training.>
