[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

The passage cites the sutra on "inconceivable objects and wisdom" to establish a hierarchy of perceptual capacity: outsiders < shravakas < bodhisattvas < tathagatas. This operates within sutric epistemology, where progressive stages of realization are mapped to expanding fields of perception.

The hierarchical comparison serves a polemical function in establishing that ordinary and even advanced practitioners have limited vision compared to the Buddha's perception. This creates the hermeneutical space for Dzogchen claims about primordial awareness that exceed all these categories.

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

The assertion that "Buddha emanations pervade all" and that even other-tantra Buddhas originate from Samantabhadra's generation of mind operates within tantric hermeneutics. The claim that Samantabhadra "tamed through tantra" establishes a genealogical connection between the primordial teacher and all subsequent Buddha activity.

The citation from the Magical Vajra tantra and the assertion that Samantabhadra is "Buddha before all Buddhas" represents a tantric claim about primordial authority that supersedes temporal sequence.

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

The acknowledgment that "this manner is also famous in common sutras" frames the preceding tantric assertions as continuous with sutric tradition. This operates as upaya — establishing legitimacy through appeal to shared scripture while the actual content exceeds sutric parameters.
