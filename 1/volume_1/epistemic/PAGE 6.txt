[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PERCEPTUAL HIERARCHY]
[COGNITIVE PLENITUDE]

<Citation from *sangs rgyas kyi yul dang ye shes bsam gyis mi khyab pa la 'jug pa'i mdo* (Avatamsaka/"Inconceivable Buddha Object and Wisdom" Sutra) establishes perceptual gradation: outsiders with clairvoyance (*phyi rol pa'i drang srong mngon shes can*) → śrāvakas → bodhisattvas → Tathāgatas, each "seeing more" (*mthong ba ches mang*) within chariot-wheel extent (*shing rta'i 'phang lo tsam*). This is not hierarchical ontology but description of *chos nyid* recognition—Buddha "sees" because there is nothing obscuring, not because of enhanced faculty.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION PERMEATION]
[OMNIPRESENT SKILLFUL MEANS]

<Sky-pervading space (*nam mkhas gar khyab kyi gnas*) contains sentient beings pervaded by Buddha emanations (*sangs rgyas kyi sprul pas khyab*)—all activity (*don mdzad pa thams cad*) emerges from this recognition. Some directly (*dngos su*) through Samantabhadra's emanations, others through "other-tantra Buddhas" (*rgyud gzhan gyi sangs rgyas*)—all ultimately (*dang po*) from Samantabhadra showing path (*lam bstan*) and generating bodhicitta (*sems bskyed*). This is display-diversity, not historical genealogy.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE JEWELS SEQUENCE]
[REFUGE ONTOLOGY]

<The sequence "Buddha from Dharma, Dharma from ārya hosts" (*sangs rgyas las chos chos las 'phags pa'i tshogs*) in *bstan bcos* (treatises) indicates pedagogical (*dgongs pa*) rather than temporal priority. The Three Jewels (*dkon mchog gsum*) are inseparable (*dbyer med*) in nature—sequence is expositional device. This guards against reifying Buddha as historical originator or Dharma as created teaching.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VAJRADHARA DEBATE]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL RESOLUTION]

<The assertion that "first protector" (*thog ma'i mgon po*) generated bodhicitta for different-tantra beings (*rgyud tha dad pa'i sems can*) is rejected (*mi rigs te*) as contradicting *sgyu 'phrul rdo rje* (Māyājāla Tantra)—"first Buddha earth-Buddha" (*dang po'i rgyal ba sa rgyal ba*) and "teacher Vajradhara, Buddha before all Buddhas" (*ston pa rdo rje 'chang sangs rgyas kun bs snar sangs rgyas*). Longchenpa resolves: Vajradhara's emanations demonstrate (*bstan*) bodhicitta-generation as ordinary beings (*so so skye bo*)—not historical event but pedagogical display (*thun mong*).>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION AS TEACHING]
[SKILLFUL MEANS DEMONSTRATION]

<Samantabhadra's emanations "demonstrating the manner of generating bodhicitta" (*sems bskyed pa'i tshul bstan pa*) and opening great play (*mdzad pa chen po'i rol pa bkhye ba*) describes *thabs* (skillful means) functioning through apparent narrative. This is not historical biography but *dpe* (example) for recognition—"even ordinary beings can generate bodhicitta, therefore you can too." The *thun mong gi mdo sde* (common sūtras) also famous for such demonstrations.>
