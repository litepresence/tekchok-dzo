[350-355] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE] [INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY] Describes meditative states as purification of mental constructs, presenting samadhi as the method for revealing the already-present ground, acknowledging that these are provisional supports for beings who have not yet recognized the nature of mind.

[366-372] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] [UPĀYA STATEMENT] Describes the emanation of twelve Buddha forms with infinite qualities as skillful means for benefiting beings, presenting the transformative dimension where enlightened activity manifests according to the needs of disciples.
