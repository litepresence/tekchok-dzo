[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MIND ACTIVITIES]
[WISDOM SAMĀDHIS]

<Mind's outer four activities through samādhis: non-appearing non-doing (*mngon par 'du mi byed pa*) knowing action and conceptual activity, pure wisdom view (*ye shes kyi mthong ba dag pa*) perfecting equipoise knowledge, pure Dharmatā (*chos nyid rnam par dag pa*) knowing general and specific characteristics, exhausted defilements (*zag pa zad pa*) perfecting pure play. Inner four through wisdoms: mirror-like (*me long lta bu*) enjoying examples, equality (*mnyam pa nyid*) enjoying meaning, discriminating (*so sor rtog pa*) enjoying sense-faculties, action-accomplished (*bya ba grub pa*) enjoying separation from Dharma. Secret four: clarity-emptiness non-dual (*gsal stong dbyer med*) making samsara-nirvana non-dual clear, appearance-emptiness non-dual (*snang stong dbyer med*) making object-wisdom non-dual, awareness-emptiness non-dual (*rig stong dbyer med*) making apprehender-apprehended non-dual, object-mind non-dual (*yul sems dbyer med*) cutting conceptual limits of apprehender-apprehended. These describe *ye shes* (wisdom) as recognition, not cognitive faculty.>

<Third: Nirmāṇakāya emanation turning wheel (*sprul pa'i sku spras pas 'khor lo bskor ba*)—from Saṃbhogakāya appearance (*longs sku'i snang cha*) as emanation-body appearing in twelve abodes (*gnas ris bcu gnyis*), twelve teachers (*sa ston pa bcu gnyis*) clearly emanated with five perfections' nature (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga lnga'i rang bzhin*). Three great emanations (*sprul pa chen po gsum*) appearing to benefit beings in Jambudvīpa—Dharmakāya teaching actual Great Perfection blessing self-arisen (*chos sku'i bstan pa dngos rdzogs pa chen po'i byin rlabs las rang shar*), enjoyment-body teaching actual self-arisen single-son blessing self-arisen. This is *thabs* diversity, not historical multiplicity.>
