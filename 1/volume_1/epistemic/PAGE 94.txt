[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CONDUCT AS NATURAL EXPRESSION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: BEHAVIORAL MANIFESTATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents conduct (spyod pa) as the third aspect of the Dzogchen path—the natural expression of recognition in activity. From the Dzogchen perspective, conduct is not disciplined behavior according to rules but the spontaneous expression of the natural state without acceptance or rejection.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding conduct. Unlike causal vehicles that emphasize ethical discipline as a means to purify obscurations, Dzogchen conduct recognizes that all activity is the display of primordial purity. There is nothing to accept or reject, nothing to adopt or abandon.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes conduct as the equal taste (ro snyoms) of all phenomena. Samsara and nirvana, virtue and non-virtue, pure and impure—all are equal in the nature of mind. Conduct is not about choosing between them but recognizing their equal nature.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in conduct is the recognition that while conventionally we maintain ethical behavior, ultimately there is no good or bad from the perspective of primordial purity. Yet this does not license unethical behavior—the natural expression of recognition is compassionate activity.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle of conduct in Dzogchen: whatever arises is the display of awareness, neither to be accepted nor rejected. This is the conduct of self-liberation (rang grol gyi spyod pa), where delusions liberate themselves through recognition.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how conduct manifests in practice. For beginners, this may involve maintaining mindfulness in daily activities. For advanced practitioners, all activity becomes continuous meditation—eating, sleeping, walking, all are the natural state expressing itself.

The section discusses the relationship between meditation and conduct. In Dzogchen, the distinction between meditation session and post-meditation dissolves. All conduct is meditation when recognition is continuous; all meditation is conduct when it expresses itself in activity.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for Dzogchen conduct, recognizing it as the natural expression of definitive view. While conventional ethics are respected, they are understood as expressions of primordial purity rather than rules to be followed.

The section thus establishes conduct as the seamless integration of recognition into all activity, completing the three aspects of the Dzogchen path—view, meditation, and conduct as inseparable expressions of the natural state.
