[RISK: COSMOLOGICAL LITERALISM]

<The world-system container architecture—seven gold mountains (*gser gyi ri bdun*), four continents (*gling bzhi*), wish-fulfilling tree (*dpag bsam gyi shing*), sun-moon orbits—follows classical *Abhidharma* cosmology from Vasubandhu's *Kośa*. The precise measurements (50 leagues for Dharma conch, 8,000 leagues between realms) operate within conventional descriptive framework. Risk: Confusing symbolic cosmology with empirical geography.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<The three realms (*khams gsum*) architecture with formless absorptions (*snyoms 'jug bzhi*), form realm seventeen abodes (*gnas bcu bdun*), and desire realm six heavens configures tantric visionary topology. The pure abodes (*gnas gtsang ma*) as exclusive non-returner (*phyir mi 'ong ba*) residences establish soteriological hierarchy within transformative framework.>
