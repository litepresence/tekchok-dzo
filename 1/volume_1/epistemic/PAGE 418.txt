<That mind possesses rigpa-obscuring mind, therefore called sentient being. That mind accumulates karma, performing samsara's actions from one delusion to the next. This is the mechanism of bondage—not punishment but self-created continuation through ignorance.>

[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<When that mind is freed from rigpa—exhausted, pure, expanded—called buddha because rigpa is free from defilement. From *De nyid las*: When mind is freed, buddha. All embodied ones' defilements exhausted. Beings proceed by that mind; without it, unable to proceed. Therefore beings wander like delusion-wheel.>
