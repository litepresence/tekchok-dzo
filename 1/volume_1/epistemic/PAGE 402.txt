<The sphere lamp's threefold classification—ground (*gzhi*), path (*lam*), and fruition (*'bras bu*)—demonstrates that wisdom-display manifests simultaneously across all phases without temporal sequencing. The snake-noose (*lu gu rgyud*) held as chain-circle (*go rar*) is rigpa appearing as its own object (*rang yul*). Defilement (*dri ma*) is recognized as never having existed (*ma bzung mi gnas*), not purified through effort.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<The ground-abiding completely pure sphere lamp manifests awareness's self-wisdom (*rig pa'i ye shes*) and light-kāya (*'od kyi sku*) as spontaneously present within the citadel. Path-display gathers the bindu's essence (*thig le'i dngas ma*) within the five-rim (*mu khyud lnga*) fence. Fruition-display holds the snake-noose prisoner—here the five light nets (*'od lnga'i dra ba*) appear as self-liberated display. These are not sequential stages but pedagogical orientations to simultaneous recognition.>

[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Awareness-essence (*rang ngo*) abiding as primordial purity (*ka dag*) reveals the sphere as fence when rigpa enters—this is the great self-relaxed meditation (*rang dal chen po'i bsam gtan*). Spontaneously perfect light-display (*lhun grub ye gdangs*) manifests under-barrel house appearances (*za 'og ber khyim*) in the sky, not as external visions but as awareness's own radiant display (*rang gsal*).>
