[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[BLISS AS SPONTANEOUS QUALITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Bliss from Dzogchen view: not cultivated but spontaneous (*lhun grub*) quality of *rig pa*. Coemergent joy (*lhan skyes kyi dga' ba*) is *rig pa* recognizing itself—bliss inseparable from emptiness without deliberate generation. The four joys are descriptions of recognition's intensification, not stages to achieve. Great bliss (*bde ba chen po*) is *rig pa*'s uncompounded nature—not pleasure but freedom from suffering's basis. This reframes tantric bliss-technology as recognition-description rather than method-technique.>
