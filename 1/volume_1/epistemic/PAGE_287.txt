<Two-non-existent self-dissolving. Lines 11952-11971: "This also quality gem, Again quality this-like, Two-non-existent two-non-existent self-dissolve-by-means-of, Number in hold-of attachment plural, Single-one elaboration and free as-for, Non-two one-of method as also, Self-dissolve self-in nirvana, Two-in appear self self-dissolve-by-means-of, Example river river in, Dissolve like distinguish non-divide, Distinguish non-existent great-in nirvana, This also quality gem, Non-cease quality this-like, Extreme liberate self extreme liberate in, Self-of nature self-dissolve-by-means-of, Body speech hold-of self-continuum all, Body plural exhaust nirvana, Extreme self pure self-dissolve-by-means-of, Example space space in, Dissolve like identify non-existent"—also this quality gem; again this-like quality; by means of self-dissolving two-non-existent two-non-existent; plural attachment holding in number; as for single-one elaboration free; also as method of non-two one; nirvana in self self-dissolving; by means of self self-dissolving appearing in two; example: in river river; like dissolving, distinguish non-divide; nirvana in great distinguish non-existent; also this quality gem; this-like non-ceasing quality; in extreme liberate self extreme liberate; by means of self-dissolving self-of nature; all self-continuum holding body speech; nirvana exhaust body plural; by means of self-dissolving extreme self pure; example: in space space; like dissolving identify non-existent. **Two analogies**:
1. **River in river**: water drops indistinguishable yet flowing
2. **Space in space**: no separation or identification possible

**Two-non-existent** (*gnyis med gnyis med*): both extremes dissolved. Single-one (*gcig pu*) free from elaboration. Non-two one (*gnyis med gcig*) method: self-dissolving. All bodies, speeches, continuums exhaust into nirvana by self-dissolving. Extreme self pure—like space dissolving into space.>
