<Sectarian context: Nyingma six/seven vehicles (*theg pa drug* or *bdun*) with Atiyoga as apex. The classification positions tantra as preparation for Dzogchen, but this is hermeneutical framework, not historical claim. Other Tibetan schools (Geluk, Sakya, Kagyu) have different tantric classifications, but all recognize anuttara-yoga as highest tantric vehicle. Dzogchen's unique status as *theg pa'i mchog* (supreme vehicle) is Nyingma assertion, not universal consensus. The text navigates this carefully—asserting Dzogchen's primacy within Nyingma framework while acknowledging tantra's validity for suitable practitioners.>
