[SAMAYA AND GURU YOGA]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Samaya and guru yoga integration: maintaining samaya through guru yoga. Guru yoga is supreme samaya maintenance—continuous recognition of guru as *rig pa*. Root samaya of not abandoning guru is fulfilled through guru yoga practice. Branch samayas are supported by guru yoga's transformative power. If samaya weakens, guru yoga repairs; if guru yoga falters, samaya re-commitment restores it. This is tantric method: multiple supporting structures creating resilient practice. From Dzogchen view, guru yoga and samaya are *rig pa*'s self-sustaining display—no separation to maintain, no bond to break.>
