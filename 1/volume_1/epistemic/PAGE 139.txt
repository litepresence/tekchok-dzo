[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[TANTRA VS. DZOGCHEN BRIDGE]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Bridge section: tantra and Dzogchen relation. Tantra uses *bskyed rim* (development stage) and *rdzogs rim* (completion stage) to purify perception gradually. Dzogchen points directly to *rig pa* as primordially pure (*ka dag*) and spontaneously present (*lhun grub*). Risk: Collapsing tantric transformative view into Dzogchen's intrinsic perfection view. Critical distinction: Tantra *transforms* the practitioner through staged practice; Dzogchen *reveals* intrinsic perfection through direct pointing. The text maintains both frameworks without conflation—tantra as preparation, Dzogchen as culmination.>
