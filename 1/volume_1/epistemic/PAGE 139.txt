[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND MIND]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: TRANSCENDING CONCEPTUAL MIND]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the Dzogchen view that the natural state is beyond mind (blo 'das)—transcending not only ordinary conceptual mind but even the most refined meditative states. From the Dzogchen perspective, rig pa is not a state of mind but the nature beyond all minds.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding transcendence of mind. Unlike teachings that aim at refined mental states—calm abiding, deep concentration, or even non-conceptual meditation—Dzogchen points to what transcends mind entirely.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that mind (sems) includes all conceptual and even non-conceptual mental activity. Rig pa is not a modification of mind but the awareness within which mind arises and dissolves. It is not a better mind but the nature beyond mind.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in transcendence of mind is the recognition that while conventionally we work with mind—calming it, refining it, transcending its gross aspects—ultimately we must go beyond mind itself to the awareness that is its nature.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the natural state is beyond mind (blo 'das), beyond intellect (blo), and beyond thought (rtog pa). These three transcendences point to rig pa as distinct from all mental activity.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to go beyond mind. Do not try to achieve special mental states; simply recognize the awareness within which all states arise. This recognition is beyond mind.

The section discusses the relationship between meditation and non-meditation. Meditation uses mind; Dzogchen transcends it. The highest meditation is non-meditation—resting in awareness beyond all mental activity.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for transcendence of mind, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings work with mind, the ultimate reality is beyond it.

The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of the natural state as beyond mind—not a state to be achieved but the awareness within which all states arise and dissolve.
