[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS COMPLETION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<The passage establishes *lhun grub* (spontaneous completion) as the nature of phenomena. This is not something manufactured through practice but recognized as always-already perfect. The epistemic danger is substantializing this as a 'thing'—it is rather the unfindability of any inherent nature. The text points to self-liberation (*rang grol*) where confusion and liberation are not two.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL PERCEPTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Appearance and emptiness (*snang stong*) are presented as inseparable. The practitioner is cautioned against alternating between these as separate views. The definitive meaning (*nges don*) is their union (*zung 'jug*)—appearing yet empty, empty yet appearing. This is not philosophical synthesis but direct perception beyond concept.>
