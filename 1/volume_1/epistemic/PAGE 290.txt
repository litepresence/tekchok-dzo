Presents realization wisdom's action through Lamp Blaze Tantra: base itself ripens as result through wisdom; wisdom ripens as body. Nature's dharmakaya ripens as wisdom dharmakaya; wisdom continuum uncut, body and wisdom spontaneous clear. When knowable objects appear as field-aspects, self-face realizing is aspect-all-knowing Buddha. Self-face inner-clear abides, nature's state from investigating-doing elaboration ceases—all-knowing Buddha. Though knowing all, non-moving from self-face nature: inner-abiding knowing and outward-gaze knowing distinguished as all-knowing wisdom and aspect-all-knowing wisdom.
