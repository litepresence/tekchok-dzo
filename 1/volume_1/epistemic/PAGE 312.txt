[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Liberating the three realms through practice: "Liberating the three realms (*khams gsum*) and attaining siddhis" describes the tantric path's goal—transformation of experience through energetic mastery. "Wisdom burning the basisless" (*shes rab kyis mes gzhi med zad par bsregs*) indicates how recognition consumes the fuel of delusion. The text balances methodical practice description with reminders of emptiness (*stong pa nyid*). Risk: Taking these attainment descriptions as ontological claims about reality rather than phenomenological accounts of practice progression. The Dzogchen view: No realms to liberate, no siddhis to attain—yet practices remain valuable as preparation for recognition.>
