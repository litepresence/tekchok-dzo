[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[SAMAYA COMMITMENTS INTRODUCTION]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: SAMAYA MISINTERPRETATION]

<Transition to samaya (*dam tshig*)—sacred bond/pledge/commitment. Samaya is relationship with realization, not moralistic command. Root samayas (*rtsa ba'i dam tshig*) and branch samayas (*yan lag gi dam tshig*) create sacred continuity. Critical risk: Understanding samaya as ethical obligation rather than sacred connection. In tantra, samaya maintains empowerment's power; breaking samaya is losing recognition-connection. In Dzogchen, samaya is intrinsic—*rig pa* never separates from itself. The text bridges both: samaya as commitment to recognition, not external rule.>
