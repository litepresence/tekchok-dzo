<Dharmakāya's ten aspects: seven like space, three like purifications. These are not attributes of dharmakāya but ways of describing its inconceivable nature. Like space: pervading, unchanging, unobstructed, etc. Like purifications: purified of obscuration, obscuring cause, obscuring habit.>

<Saṃbhogakāya's five certainties: certain place (Akanṣṭha), certain form (sambhogakāya), certain retinue (bodhisattvas), certain teaching (mahāyāna), certain time (until samsara ends). These are conventional descriptions for those who need structure. In Dzogchen, they are aspects of awareness-display without separate existence.>

<Nirmāṇakāya's two types: crafted and born. Crafted: statues, paintings, texts—manifestations through art. Born: actual teachers appearing in the world. Both are awareness's compassionate display, not separate from the teacher's mind or the student's perception.>
