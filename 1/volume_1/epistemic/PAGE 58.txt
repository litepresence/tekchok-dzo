[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-BUDDHIST REFUTATION]
[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

<Introduction to wrong vehicles (*log pa'i theg pa*), specifically the 360 (*sum brgya drug cu*) views of worldly aggregates (*'jig tshogs*). Two divisions: general presentation of eternalist-nihilist nature (*rtag chad kyi rang bzhin*), and specific explanation of their varieties. Eternalist view (*rtag par lta ba*) and nihilist view (*chad par lta ba*) established as the two extremes to be transcended. [POLEMICAL DISTINCTION] establishing Dzogchen's middle position beyond both.>

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

<Saṃkhya (*grangs can pa*) doctrine: dust-darkness-energy (*rdul mun pa snying stobs*) in equal proportions is called self (*bdag*). Located in all beings' hearts, thumb-sized for great beings, smaller for others. Characterized as white, oily, round, indestructible, invisible. When passion-anger-delusion equal, its nature self-known, invisible nature. Later liberation appears as white umbrella in heaven. Now its nature unmoving, free from activity, object-knowledge deep, time-eternal existence—unknowing this causes samsara. Knowing and not wandering from its nature liberates; through sacrifice and good conduct, later born in Lord's place with perfect retinue and enjoyment. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] reifying self as permanent entity.>

[DOXOGRAPHICAL POLEMIC]

<From this, individual traditions proliferate. Citation from *Madhyamakāvatāra* (*'jug pa*): "Self imputed by Saṃkhyas as entity, permanent, agent, possessing uncreated qualities." Based on slight differentiation of that, non-Buddhist traditions differ. Introduction to nihilist view (*chad par smra ba*) follows.>
