[CHANGE WITHOUT PERCEIVER]

<Lines 10680-10683: "change possible not perceive cause base whatever change able that not valid, that itself from, change able called before said cause, own state change able-if this also determined not same"—if change is possible without perceiving cause, basis as whatever-changeable is invalid. From itself, called changeable before—if own state changes, this is not same as determined. Lines 10684-10691: Consequences: effect-cause reversion (*'bras rgyu phyir ldog*), effort not needed for those, again-again reversion, matter-by-awareness impossible transformation. "This also knowable not, said that also that-like"—this too is unknowable, said thus. This extends previous critique: change without perceiver/recognizer leads to infinite regress and transformation impossibilities.>

[WHATEVER-ACCEPTANCE REFUTED]

<Fifth position (10693-10694): "awareness-of essence-to direction not everywhere arise cause whatever accept"—awareness essence direction not everywhere arising, accepting whatever. Refutation (10695-10706): "whatever accept that, base that-from dwell accept or not dwell accept"—if whatever is accepted, does it dwell in basis or not? If dwell (like first position), permanent-impermanent both established together (10700), impermanent appears only as dwell. If impermanent established but permanent not, whatever-acceptance is damaged (10702). "Like-that samsara effort without liberate and, liberation those revert follow"—samsara liberates without effort, liberation reverts. Lines 10706-10715: "Second like-if rabbit-horn and barren-woman-of son samsara-nirvana make also accept etcetera limit not fault perceive"—like second position, rabbit horns and barren woman's son make samsara-nirvana, limitless faults. Teacher said before: "this all direction-of projection only, all being establish cause, limit not fault become cause, this also knowable not"—all mere directional projection, establishing all being causes limitless faults, unknowable. This is *kun brtags* (imputation) critique: accepting "whatever" allows absurdities.>

[VARIEGATED APPEARANCE]

<Sixth position (10716-10717): "essence everywhere arise cause appearance variegated variety arise accept"—essence arising everywhere, accepting variegated variety appearance. Refutation (10718-10723): "variety that outer-appearance-to accept or, inner-consciousness-to accept or, those two gather-to accept"—is variety outer appearance, inner consciousness, or both gathered? First option (10723): "appearance variety like base one-only that also variety-as outer arise-of fault exist"—if variety like base is one-only, fault of variety as outer arising. This begins analysis of *sna tshogs* (variety/multiplicity) as basis characteristic. The problem: one basis cannot produce manifold variety without losing unity.>

[COMPLETION OF REFUTATION]

<Six positions refuted across pages 256-260:
1. Spontaneous presence (256)
2. Not-determined (257)
3. Determined (258)
4. Changeable (259)
5. Whatever-acceptance (260)
6. Variegated (260-261)

The exhaustive refutation demonstrates that NO conceptual characterization of basis is tenable. This is not nihilism but *sgrub 'gag* (establishing-negation): the basis cannot be established through conceptuality. Yet it IS experienced as *rig pa* (awareness). The key line 10710: "this all direction-of projection only"—all these positions are *phyogs kyi spros pa* (directional projections), conceptual elaborations. The actual basis is *spros bral* (free from elaboration). The six pages of refutation (256-261) are *shes bya'i sgrib pa* (obscuration of knowables)—clearing intellectual obstacles so *nyon sgrib* (afflictive obscurations) can be addressed through practice. Risk: Intellectual satisfaction with refutation, missing the pointing beyond. The refutation is finger, not moon. Recognition occurs when logic exhausts itself.>
