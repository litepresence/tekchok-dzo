[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SKANDHAS AND DHATUS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: DEFINITIVE MEANING]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the Dzogchen perspective on the traditional Buddhist analysis of skandhas (phung po) and dhatus (khams), demonstrating how these conventional categories are understood within the Great Perfection framework. The text enumerates the six consciousness dhatus—the visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, mental, and tactile consciousnesses—showing how each perceives its respective object domain. Crucially, the presentation maintains that these dhatus are "born from the aspect of delusion that grasps inwardly" ('khrul pa nyid nang du 'dzin pa'i cha las byung ba), indicating the Dzogchen view that all conventional phenomena emerge from the fundamental ground of rig pa yet remain essentially empty of inherent existence.

The distinction between "skandhas with conceptualization" (rtog pa dang bcas pa'i phung po) and "skandhas without conceptualization" (rtog pa med pa'i phung po) reflects the nuanced Dzogchen approach to the gradual vehicles. The former refers to the five contaminated aggregates of ordinary worldly beings, while the latter points toward the recognition of the aggregates as luminous emptiness. This stratification uses [DEFINITIVE MEANING] vs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] where the enumeration of aggregates serves as [DRANG DON] for those who need gradual training, while their recognition as the display of rig pa represents [NGES DON].

The five skandhas—form (gzugs), feeling (tshor ba), perception ('du shes), formations ('du byed), and consciousness (rnam par shes pa)—are here presented not as ultimately real entities but as functional categories for analyzing experience. In Dzogchen, these are understood as the "spontaneous self-display" (rang shar) of the ground, neither truly existent nor non-existent. The epistemic stance maintains [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH], where the aggregates appear conventionally but are empty of svabhava ultimately.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] applies here as the text establishes the ontological status of these phenomena, while [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] is implicit in how one is to understand these categories during practice—not as objects of rejection but as the natural display to be recognized. The section demonstrates how Dzogchen integrates and transcends traditional Abhidharma analysis, using it as a skillful means while pointing to the primordial purity (ka dag) of all phenomena.

The eighteen dhatus are understood as the self-display of awareness (rig pa'i rang shar), appearing yet empty, empty yet appearing—a union that transcends the extremes of eternalism and nihilism. This is the Dzogchen view of "appearances and mind as the dharmakaya" (snang sems chos sku), where conventional analysis serves as a doorway to ultimate recognition.
