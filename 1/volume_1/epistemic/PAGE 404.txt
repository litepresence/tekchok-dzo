<The four lamps' complete classification—essence, definition, divisions, nature, characteristics, familiarization, measure, abode, door, actual, and similes. These eleven aspects are not to be analyzed intellectually but serve as recognition points. The lamp is already blazing; analysis is smoke obscuring the flame.>

[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Measure (*tshad*) and abode (*gnas*) described—how to work with appearance until recognition dawns. The bindu's size, the light's clarity, the expanse's vastness—these are signs that recognition is approaching, not goals to achieve. The door (*sgo*) is not an entry point but the aperture of awareness itself.>

<The chain-circle (*lu gu rgyud*) is vajra itself—the indestructible nature of awareness. Ungraspable, inseparable, continuously appearing. Not held, not abiding, without separation. This is the nature of display: unceasing, ungraspable, self-liberated. Recognize this and you recognize the ground.>
