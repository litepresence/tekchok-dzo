[DZOGCHEN VIEW – YOGA TANTRA EXPOSTION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: OUTER TANTRA CULMINATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON PREPARATION]

This section presents Yoga tantra (rnal 'byor rgyud), the third of the three outer tantras and the culmination of the outer tantric approach. Yoga internalizes the deity completely, recognizing that the deity is not external but the nature of the practitioner's own mind. This internalization prepares the ground for the inner tantras' more direct approaches. From the Dzogchen perspective, Yoga represents the highest achievement of dualistic tantra, pointing toward the non-dual recognition of inner tantra.

The epistemic framework here approaches [DEFINITIVE MEANING] while remaining within [PROVISIONAL MEANING]. Yoga's view recognizes the deity as the nature of mind, the practitioner as the deity in essence, and the practice as the expression of primordial wisdom. The four classes of mandala (gang las dbang bzhi) are all understood as manifestations of the practitioner's own awareness.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes Yoga as the closest approach to definitive recognition within the outer tantras. The internalization of the deity, the emphasis on wisdom yoga (ye shes kyi rnal 'byor), and the view of all phenomena as the display of the mandala all foreshadow Dzogchen's view of primordial purity. Yet Yoga maintains a subtle dualism between the meditative state and post-meditation, the generation stage and completion stage.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] operates in Yoga as the recognition that the deity is the nature of mind. Conventionally, the deity is visualized and worshipped; ultimately, the deity is one's own awareness. This recognition distinguishes Yoga from Kriya and Upa, though it remains a conceptual recognition rather than direct realization.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes Yoga's specific perspective: the deity is the nature of mind, the practitioner realizes this through meditation, all phenomena are the mandala of the deity. The four mudras (phyag rgya bzhi)—karma, dharma, maha, and samaya—represent progressively deeper integrations of this view.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes Yoga's distinctive practices: generation stage (bskyed rim) to purify ordinary perception, completion stage (rdzogs rim) to recognize the nature of mind, and the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) to transform the five poisons. The emphasis is on internal realization rather than external ritual.

The section emphasizes Yoga's focus on the non-duality of self and deity (bdag lha gnyis su med pa). Unlike Kriya's view of the deity as external lord and Upa's balanced approach, Yoga recognizes deity and practitioner as one in nature. This recognition, while profound, still operates within the framework of meditation practice rather than continuous recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [DRANG DON] with strong elements of [NGES DON], recognizing Yoga as the culmination of outer tantra and the doorway to inner tantra. The methods are still provisional, but they point directly to the definitive recognition of the natural state.

The section thus presents Yoga as the bridge between outer and inner tantras, completing the outer tantric approach while preparing for the more direct methods of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga. The practitioner has internalized the deity and recognized the nature of mind conceptually; now the transition to direct recognition begins.
