<Channel junctions and Kṣe trailing: "From Dumdum Khriks channel junction" (*dum dum khrigs kyi rtsa mdo las*) names specific channel intersections. "Right side Kṣe's tail exists" (*g.yas na kṣe'i mjug ma yod*) identifies the right channel's terminus—the "tail" where energy completes its circuit. Medical terminology appears: "giving medicine called long tail" (*sman skad du byin mjug ring po zhes bya*) shows tantric physiology overlaps with Tibetan medicine (*gso ba rig pa*). The channels described here function in both contexts—energetic and medical. This reflects the integrated worldview where subtle body, physical body, and cosmological body are continuous. Practitioner works at all levels simultaneously.>
