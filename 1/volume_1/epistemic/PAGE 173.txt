[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[RESULT STAGE EXEGESIS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Tantric result (*'bras bu*) as three kāyas (*sku gsum*): dharmakāya—emptiness-nature purified; saṃbhogakāya—clarity-qualities developed; nirmāṇakāya—compassion-manifestation accomplished. This is tantric transformative view—result achieved through path. The five Buddha bodies, five wisdoms, pure lands—all result-achievements through practice. In Dzogchen, these are intrinsic (*rang bzhin*)—not achieved but recognized. The three kāyas are *rig pa*'s three aspects spontaneously present. Tantra cultivates what Dzogchen recognizes—both valid, different approaches.>
