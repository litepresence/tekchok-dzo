[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[PURPOSE SECTIONS SEVEN-ELEVEN]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Purpose sections continued: (7) Two branch tantras—wisdom self-appearance recognition as beauty; (8) Yoga liberation tantra— accomplishing desires like king in palace; (9) Heart-like tantra—six spaces (*klong drug*) as door-lock preventing deviations/obstacles; (10) Secret self-text—*Sgra thal 'gyur* cutting all doubts like iron fence; (11) Weapon-like tantra—*Nag mo khros ma* protecting from harm. The metaphor pattern (palace, door, fence, guard) indicates protection and security framing for tantric commitment. Citations from *Mu tig phreng ba* summarize: knowing three essences like king-minister-subjects assembled, three clarities like reaching three mountain peaks, etc.—all point to complete mastery through recognition.>
