[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FRUITION AS DISSOLUTION OF DELUSION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: SOTERIOLOGICAL COMPLETION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON DEFINITIVE]

This section presents the fruition of Dzogchen as the complete dissolution of delusion into primordial purity. From the Dzogchen perspective, fruition is not the acquisition of new qualities but the recognition that all qualities have always been present, obscured only by temporary delusion.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in its fullest sense. The dissolution of delusion is not a process of purification but a recognition that delusion itself is empty, has no substantial existence, and cannot actually obscure the natural state. The fruition is this recognition fully stabilized.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that delusion has never actually existed as an entity. Like clouds obscuring the sun, delusion appears to obscure awareness but cannot actually affect its nature. The fruition is the recognition that the sun has been shining all along, never stained by the clouds.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in fruition is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of removing obscurations and achieving realization, ultimately there are no obscurations to remove and no realization to achieve. The fruition is the recognition of this primordial freedom.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the three aspects of fruition: the exhaustion of delusion (khrul pa zad pa), the manifestation of qualities (yon tan 'char ba), and the spontaneous activity of benefit (phrin las lhun grub). These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of recognition.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the signs of complete recognition. For the practitioner, there is no distinction between meditation and post-meditation, no separation between sacred and profane, no difference between self and others. All is recognized as the display of primordial purity.

The section discusses the relationship between partial and complete recognition. Partial recognition dissolves gross delusions; complete recognition dissolves even subtle delusions. The path progresses from initial recognition to complete stabilization, though ultimately no progression actually occurs.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for fruition, recognizing it as the definitive truth fully manifested. All teachings about gradual paths and progressive realizations are provisional; the fruition is the recognition that all was always complete.

The section thus presents fruition as the complete recognition of primordial purity—the dissolution of all delusion into the natural state that was never actually obscured.
