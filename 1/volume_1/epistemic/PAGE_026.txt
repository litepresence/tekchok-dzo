[921-940]
[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<The container-contained cosmogony conclusion (hells, preta realms, animal abodes, human continents, god heavens) completes standard Buddhist cosmological enumeration. The eight hot and eight cold hells with specific torture descriptions operate within conventional moral-karmic descriptive framework.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

<The cosmological presentation transposes into definitive Dzogchen framing through recognition that all realms are spontaneous display (*lhun grub kyi snang ba*) of primordial awareness. This is not rejection of conventional cosmology but hermeneutical repositioning—samsara's six realms (*'gro ba rigs drug*) and nirvana's pure fields (*zhing khams*) are equally *rang snang* (self-appearance) without ontological hierarchy.>
