Details delusion's entry and reversal through six actual bases and seven liberation doors. From spontaneous presence appearance-mode, impure samsara-door arises—delusion coarsens to miraculously-born and egg-born bodies. Liberation-methods include direct liberation in bardo through stable attainment and complete wisdom-display. Delusion-base and liberation-base both reach spontaneous presence door. In this life, base's inner-tone appears in heart and outer sky; impure samsara-door appears at nature-manifest time with light-appearances and sense objects.
