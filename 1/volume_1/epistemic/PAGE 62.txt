[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ADDITIONAL HETERODOX ERRORS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section extends the critique of non-Buddhist approaches, identifying three additional errors: debate-supremacy (rtsod pa lhur len), wrong austerities (log pa'i dka' thub), and attachment to this world ('jig rten 'di la zhen pa). These represent common pitfalls that may ensnare even sincere spiritual seekers who lack correct view.

Debate-supremacy characterizes those who prioritize intellectual victory over genuine understanding. While philosophical training is valuable, attachment to winning arguments becomes another form of ego-grasping. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that conceptual proliferation (spros pa), whether in the form of philosophical debate or everyday thought, obscures the direct recognition of rig pa. The highest philosophy is that which dissolves itself, pointing beyond words to the inexpressible nature of mind.

From the epistemic perspective, this represents [PROVISIONAL MEANING] taken too far—when the finger pointing at the moon becomes an object of obsession in itself. The [ULTIMATE TRUTH] transcends all positions, even the most sophisticated philosophical arguments. Dzogchen warns against "mistaking the raft for the shore," when the means of practice becomes an end in itself.

Wrong austerities refer to extreme ascetic practices that mortify the body in the mistaken belief that suffering leads to purification. While discipline is necessary, extreme asceticism fails to recognize that the nature of mind is primordially pure (ka dag) and cannot be improved through hardship. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] emphasizes naturalness (rang babs) over forced effort, recognizing that rig pa is spontaneously present (lhun grub) and does not need to be manufactured.

Attachment to this world represents the most fundamental error—the grasping at samsaric existence as truly desirable. Whether through philosophy, ritual, or worldly success, this attachment prevents the recognition of liberation. The [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] acknowledges that beings naturally seek happiness, but the [DEFINITIVE MEANING] recognizes that true happiness comes from transcending the dualistic grasping that creates suffering.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] is used here to clearly delineate correct from incorrect approaches. The section functions as [UPAYA], warning practitioners against common pitfalls while acknowledging that beings may need to pass through various stages of understanding before recognizing the natural state.

The critique of "merely seeking livelihood through customs" (chos lugs kyis don 'tshol) is particularly relevant—using religious practice as a means of worldly gain rather than liberation. From the Dzogchen perspective, this represents the grossest form of spiritual materialism, where even the highest teachings are co-opted for samsaric purposes.

The epistemic stance maintains that while conventional practices and philosophy have their place, they must be subordinated to the direct recognition of rig pa. All methods are provisional (drang don); only the recognition of awareness is definitive (nges don).
