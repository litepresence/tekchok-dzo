<Transition from narrative to recognition-instruction: The phrase "run there, you are the father of your own appearance" (*der rgyug cig khyod rang gi snang ba'i yab yin*) marks the pivotal shift from confusion to recognition. This is not a command to flee but a pointing-out that the "enemy" is one's own projection. The "twenty-one queens adorned with beautiful ornaments" (*btsun mo nyi shu rtsa gcig*) represent the twenty-one thousand channels (*rtsa*) of the subtle body—this begins the transition from symbolic narrative to subtle body physiology (*rtsa rlung thig le*). View tag shifts from sems-side to tantric transformative as the text moves from recognition of delusion to working with energetic structures.>
