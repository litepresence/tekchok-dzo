[DZOGCHEN VIEW – INEXPRESSIBILITY]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: BEYOND LANGUAGE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the inexpressibility (brjod du med pa) of the natural state as a fundamental feature of Dzogchen. From the Dzogchen perspective, the nature of mind cannot be captured in words, concepts, or descriptions—it must be recognized directly.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding inexpressibility. Unlike teachings that can be fully articulated in language, Dzogchen points to what transcends language. Words can point to the natural state but cannot contain it.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that language operates by distinction—this versus that, existence versus non-existence, subject versus object. The natural state transcends all distinctions; therefore, it cannot be expressed in language. It can only be recognized directly.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in inexpressibility is the recognition that while conventionally we use words to teach and communicate, ultimately the truth is beyond words. All teachings are provisional pointers to what cannot be taught.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the natural state is beyond all expression (brjod du med), beyond all thought (bsam du med), and beyond all description (bshad du med). These three inexpressibilities point to the same reality.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to approach the inexpressible. Do not try to understand the natural state conceptually; simply rest in direct recognition. The inexpressible is not a puzzle to be solved but a reality to be experienced.

The section discusses the relationship between inexpressibility and teaching. If the truth is inexpressible, why teach? The teachings are fingers pointing at the moon, not the moon itself. They create conditions for recognition but are not the recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for inexpressibility, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings can be expressed, the ultimate truth transcends expression.

The section thus establishes the inexpressibility of the natural state—the recognition that the truth of Dzogchen cannot be captured in words but must be recognized directly through direct introduction.
