<Mantric vehicles progressive elaboration: kriyā (*bya ba'i rgyud*)—deity external, practitioner servant-like; caryā (*spyod pa'i rgyud*)—deity and practitioner friend-like; yoga (*rnal 'byor gyi rgyud*)—deity and practitioner non-dual; mahāyoga—primordial purity emphasized; anuyoga—spontaneous presence emphasized; atiyoga (*rdzogs pa chen po*)—intrinsic perfection recognized. This is Nyingma vehicle classification (*theg pa dgu* or *bdun*). Critical distinction: In tantra, vehicles are progressive methods; in Dzogchen, they are recognition-modes of same primordial perfection.>
