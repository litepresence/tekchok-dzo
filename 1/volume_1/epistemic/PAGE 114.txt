[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[MEANING TANTRA CLASSIFICATION]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The twofold division of meaning tantra (*don gyi rgyud*) into method (*thabs*) tantra and nature (*rang bzhin*) tantra establishes tantric hermeneutics. Method tantra's essence: awareness (*rig pa*) and that meaning's practice instructions. The citation from *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland) demonstrates tantric view: emptiness (*stong pa*) and clarity (*gsal ba*) as twofold pervasion (*khyab pa*)—emptiness pervading because causeless entityless, clarity pervading because unceasing self-radiance. This is *rgyud* as continuity of realization, not merely textual transmission.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[CLEAR LIGHT AS GROUND]

<The definition of indicated method tantra (*mtshon bya thabs kyi rgyud*): awareness-emptiness great wisdom pervading all beings—*byang chub kyi sems* (bodhicitta) as *rig pa*'s universal presence. The phrase *rig pa gsal stong ye shes chen pos* (awareness clarity-emptiness great wisdom) bridges tantric and Dzogchen: in tantra, clear light (*'od gsal*) is result of practice; in Dzogchen, it is primordial ground (*gzhi*). The five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) and five elements (*'byung ba lnga*) as spontaneously accomplished (*lhun gyis grub pa*) indicates *lhun grub* framing within tantric context.>
