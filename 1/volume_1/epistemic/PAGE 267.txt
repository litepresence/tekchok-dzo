Presents Aspect 1 of THE GROUND: Essence (*ngo bo*) as emptiness (*stong pa*) through exhaustive negation (*dgag pa*). The thirty-two negations (*med*) negate all extremes—awareness and non-awareness, buddha and sentient being, samsara and nirvana—establishing primordial purity (*ka dag chen po*) as the place where authentic buddhas have not arisen and impure beings have not arisen. This is the great primordial resonance of unmoved awareness (*rig pa ma g.yos pa'i ye gdangs chen po*). The text uses negated dharmas to abandon established dharmas, pointing to ineffability (*brjod du med*), unmeasurability (*gzhal du med*), and unknowability as object (*shes pa'i yul du byar med*).
