[DZOGCHEN VIEW – OUTER TANTRAS CLASSIFICATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: OUTER TANTRA HIERARCHY]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON TRANSITION]

This section presents a detailed classification of the three outer tantras—Kriya (bya rgyud), Upa (spyod rgyud), and Yoga (rnal 'byor rgyud)—analyzing their progressive refinement of view and practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, the outer tantras represent skillful means for practitioners who are not yet ready for the non-dual approaches of inner tantra, yet they progressively approach the definitive view.

The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and elements of [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. The outer tantras are provisional in their methods—elaborate rituals, purity observances, and structured deity yoga—yet they contain definitive elements in their view of the deity as the nature of mind. This combination makes them a bridge between sutric and tantric approaches.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the outer tantras as valid but limited approaches. Kriya's emphasis on external purity and ritual dualism is appropriate for those who need clear structure. Upa's balance of external and internal methods introduces non-dual elements while maintaining practice structure. Yoga's complete internalization of the deity approaches the inner tantras' view while retaining generation stage emphasis.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] operates differently in each outer tantra. Kriya maintains a strong distinction—the deity is pure, the practitioner is impure; the ritual is sacred, ordinary life is profane. Upa begins to dissolve this distinction through integrated practice. Yoga recognizes that deity and practitioner share the same nature, though this remains a conceptual recognition.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the progressive refinement: Kriya views the deity as external lord; Upa views deity and practitioner as ultimately non-dual; Yoga views the deity as the nature of one's own mind. This progression demonstrates increasing sophistication in understanding the relationship between awareness and its display.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the distinctive practices of each outer tantra. Kriya emphasizes the four purities—pure place, pure body, pure resources, pure deeds—maintained through ritual observance. Upa integrates ritual with meditation, balancing activity and absorption. Yoga emphasizes the generation stage's transformation of perception, visualizing oneself as the deity and environment as the mandala.

The section discusses the four classes of tantra (rgyud sde bzhi) system that includes Action Tantra (kriya), Performance Tantra (carya, corresponding to Upa), and Yoga Tantra, with the addition of Highest Yoga Tantra (annuttara) that includes the inner tantras. This classification reflects the progressive internalization of tantric practice.

The epistemic stance maintains [DRANG DON] for outer tantra methods while recognizing [NGES DON] elements in their view. The methods are provisional, designed to purify perception and prepare for inner tantra. The view progressively approaches definitiveness as the practitioner moves from Kriya through Yoga.

The section thus presents the outer tantras as a graduated path within tantra itself, preparing practitioners for the more direct approaches of inner tantra. Each outer tantra is appropriate for a different capacity, and all lead ultimately to the same recognition of primordial purity.
