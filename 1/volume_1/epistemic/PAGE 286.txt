Presents self-dissolution metaphors: all action-conduct is nirvana; conditioned phenomena are pure expanse. That itself self-dissolves into self—nothing goes elsewhere. Like sun rays self-dissolving into sun's heart; with self-resonance, all mirror-appearances are nirvana. Self-light dissolving into self manifests as great quality. Self-nature completely pure, grasping-signs' attachment-objects cease. Though outer four elements are coarse, here they don't appear—attachment reverses. From self-pure great emptiness, color self-grasp nirvana. All appearances nirvana through self-dissolving into self-essence.
