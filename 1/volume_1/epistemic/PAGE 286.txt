[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-DISSOLVING QUALITIES]
[SUN HEART MIRROR ANALOGIES]

<Self-dissolving qualities and analogies. Lines 11896-11915: "action conduct all nirvana, not-done action-do appearance not-exist-therefore, conditioned all pure expanse, that itself self-to self dissolve-therefore, other-to go-do not-is, example-for sun heart-to, self rays all self dissolve like, self resonance and having-by-means-of, mirror appearance all nirvana, this all quality precious, fault-in not-abide self ground-is, self light self-to dissolve-therefore, this-also quality great-as manifest, self essence completely-pure-as, sign grasp-do attachment object cease, outer four-elements coarse-as although, here not-appear-therefore attachment reverse, self pure emptiness great-from, color self-grasp nirvana, this-also other-to go-do not-exist"—all action conduct nirvana; therefore appearance of doing not-done action non-existent; all conditioned pure expanse; therefore that itself self dissolving to self; not going to other; for example: to sun heart; like self dissolving all self rays; by means of having self resonance; all mirror appearance nirvana; all this precious quality; ground is self not abiding in fault; therefore self light dissolving to self; also manifest as great quality; as self essence completely pure; cease attachment object grasping sign; although outer four elements coarse; therefore reverse attachment, not appearing here; from great self pure emptiness; nirvana self-grasp color; also not going to other. **Three analogies**:
1. **Sun heart** (*nyi ma'i snying po*): rays dissolve back to sun
2. **Mirror**: reflections dissolve into mirror
3. **Self-dissolving** (*rang grol*): qualities dissolve without going elsewhere

All action is nirvana when recognized as self-dissolving. No need to go elsewhere—everything returns to source.>
