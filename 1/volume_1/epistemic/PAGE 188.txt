[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[FOUR VISIONS OF THOD RGAL]
[DIRECT TRANSCENDENCE]

<Four visions (*snang ba bzhi*) of *thod rgal* (direct transcendence): (1) manifest dharmatā (*chos nyid mngon sum*), (2) increase of experience (*nyams snang gong 'phel*), (3) exhaustion of phenomena (*chos zad*), (4) extinction into dharmatā (*chos nyid zad pa*). These are not stages to achieve but recognition-intensifications. The visions are *rig pa*'s self-display becoming increasingly evident. *Thod rgal* is spontaneous luminosity (*'od gsal*) without meditation; *khregs chod* is cutting through (*gcod*) conceptual mind. Together they are Dzogchen path.>
