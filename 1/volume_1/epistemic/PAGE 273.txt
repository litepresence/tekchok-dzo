[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIX MODES OF ARISING]
[BASE CLASSIFICATION]

<Citation from *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) on six modes of base arising. Lines 11336-11338: "that all essence primordially-pure actual-state called, India also not-cut direction where-also not-fall, that below spontaneous-presence jewel casket called exist"—all that called primordially pure actual-state essence; not cut off from India, not falling anywhere; below that exists called spontaneous presence jewel casket. Lines 11339-11346: "that at arise-manner form six exist, gate form two exist, that base spontaneous-presence called, base not-certain called, base various arise called also, that below reverse ground exist, that below base appearance great called exist, that below enjoyment-body appearance exist thus spoke"—at that, arise-manner forms six exist; gate forms two exist; called base spontaneous presence; called base not-certain; called base various arising; below that exists reverse ground; below that exists called great base appearance; below that exists enjoyment-body appearance, thus spoke. **Six modes of base:**
1. Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*)—jewel casket
2. Not-certain (*ma nges*)—gate form
3. Various arising (*sna tshogs snang*) 
4. Reverse ground (*ldog gzhi*)
5. Great appearance (*snang ba chen po*)
6. Enjoyment-body appearance (*longs sku'i snang ba*)

These are not different bases but one base appearing six ways.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE ASPECT ABIDING]
[SUBTLE BODY CORRELATES]

<Lines 11347-11354: "here that meaning elaborate explain if, beginning expanse youth vase body inside essence body-as abide, nature speech-as abide, compassion mind-as abide, that-also life-wind limb four possession wisdom wind five essence awareness abide resonance outside appear from, youth vase body limitless not-separate spontaneous-presence resonance from light five appearance flame each arise and together, compassion awareness resonance form investigate knowledge arise that also, self-face not-know just part from awareness depend ignorance called abide"—if elaborate explanation of that meaning here: beginning expanse youth vase body inside—essence abides as body, nature abides as speech, compassion abides as mind; also life-wind possessing four limbs, five wisdom winds, essence awareness abiding resonance appears outside from; from youth vase body limitless not-separate spontaneous presence resonance, five lights appear as flames each arising together; compassion awareness resonance form investigates knowledge arising that also; from just part not knowing self-face, abiding called ignorance depending on awareness. **Three aspect abiding:**
- Essence (*ngo bo*) → Body (*sku*)
- Nature (*rang bzhin*) → Speech (*gsung*)
- Compassion (*thugs rje*) → Mind (*thugs*)

This correlates with subtle body: four life-winds (*srog rlung*), five wisdom winds (*ye shes rlung*), five lights (*'od lnga*). Not-knowing self-face (*rang ngo ma shes*) is ignorance (*ma rig pa*) depending on awareness (*rig pa*)—the basis of samsara.>
