Introduces Aspect 5: Spontaneous Presence (*lhun grub*) through six arising-manners and two gates. The jewel casket (*rin po che ga'u*) metaphor describes how essence abides as body, nature as speech, and compassion as mind within the youthful vase body (*gzhon nu bum pa sku*). When five lights appear from spontaneous presence's resonance (*gdangs*) together with investigating knowledge, this is designated ignorance (*ma rig pa*) from not recognizing self-face. The base doesn't change (*gzhi ma 'gyur*) though base-appearance (*gzhi snang*) seems to change—this is appearance changing in awareness. From cloudless sky-like primordial purity, eight spontaneous presence arising-manners self-appear.
