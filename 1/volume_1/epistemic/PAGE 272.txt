Presents self-liberation (*rang grol*) as spontaneous completion without effort or striving. All dharmas self-place and self-liberate in the complete base-appearance. Simultaneous realization (*cig car rtogs pa*) exhausts the end of appearance through nature's completion. Beyond conceptualization and investigation, this dharmata is primordially complete (*ye nas rdzogs pa*), unmodified from the beginning, liberating samsara-nirvana through knowledge. The ground's meaning is *ka dag dang lhun grub dbyer med chen po*—the great indivisibility of primordial purity and spontaneous presence, form and wisdom without gathering or separation.
