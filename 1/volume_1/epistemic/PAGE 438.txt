<The distinction between consciousness (*rnam shes*) and wisdom (*ye shes*) is crucial. Consciousness is dualistic knowing—subject and object, perceiver and perceived. Wisdom is non-dual awareness—knowing without separation, clarity without grasping. This distinction prevents confusing samsara's mind with nirvana's wisdom.>

<From *Thal 'gyur*: Wisdom is not conceptual thought. Essence self-luminous, core meaning. Not located in the body, not separate from it—not inside, not outside, not in between. Wisdom's nature transcends location while pervading all.>
