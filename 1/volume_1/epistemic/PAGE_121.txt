[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KAYAS AND WISDOMS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: RESULTANT MANIFESTATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the kayas (sku) and wisdoms (ye shes) as the fruition of Dzogchen practice—the natural expression of primordial purity and spontaneous presence. From the Dzogchen perspective, these are not achievements to be attained but the natural display of awareness when recognized.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding the kayas. The three kayas—dharmakaya (chos sku), sambhogakaya (longs sku), and nirmanakaya (sprul sku)—are not created through practice but revealed as the natural expression of rig pa. They are the spontaneous presence of the ground manifesting for the benefit of beings.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the kayas as inseparable from the ground. Dharmakaya is the empty essence, sambhogakaya is the luminous nature, nirmanakaya is the compassionate energy. These three are not separate entities but indivisible aspects of the natural state, distinguished only for pedagogical purposes.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in the kayas is the recognition that while they appear to benefit beings (conventional), they are empty by nature (ultimate). The kayas are the display of awareness, neither truly existent nor non-existent.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the five wisdoms as the natural expression of the five Buddha families. The dharmadhatu wisdom, mirror-like wisdom, equality wisdom, discriminating wisdom, and all-accomplishing wisdom are all spontaneously present in rig pa, revealed when obscurations dissolve.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to recognize the kayas and wisdoms in experience. When awareness is recognized in its emptiness, this is dharmakaya; when its luminosity is recognized, this is sambhogakaya; when it manifests for others, this is nirmanakaya. These are not future achievements but present realities to be recognized.

The section discusses the relationship between the kayas and the three sections of Atiyoga. Semde emphasizes dharmakaya, longde emphasizes sambhogakaya, and mengagde encompasses all three. Each section provides a different entry point to the same recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the kayas and wisdoms, recognizing them as the definitive expression of awareness. While conventional teachings describe them as results to be achieved, Dzogchen recognizes them as the natural display of the ground.

The section thus presents the kayas and wisdoms as the fruition of Dzogchen practice—not achievements but recognitions, not creations but revelations of what has always been present.
