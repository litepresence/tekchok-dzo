<Roma tastes at the wheel, wind impels and bindu projects. Taste depending on channels, bliss expands body-mind. These are tantric methods for generating wisdom through working with subtle body. In Dzogchen, these are provisional—recognition alone is sufficient.>

<Mothers gather essence and do not make upper-lower abode's basis. Here curving and inserting is crucial. On this's six limbs, if cut and burned, wisdom ceases—tantric symbolism for radical methods. For Dzogchen practitioners, these are understood as descriptions of natural state, not required practices.>

<The crucial point: tantric methods lead to recognition; Dzogchen begins with recognition. Both arrive at the same wisdom-kāya, but the paths differ—gradual transformation versus immediate recognition. Neither is superior in essence, but Dzogchen is swifter for those with capacity.>
