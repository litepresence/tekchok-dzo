[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Six Yogas introduction: "From space's clarity mind" (*gis nas nam mkha'i dangs ma sems*) completes elemental descent to the most subtle—space element's essence is mind itself. This marks transition to Six Yogas completion stage (*rdzogs rim gyi chos drug*): (1) individual withdrawal (*so sor sdud pa*), (2) concentration (*bsam gtan*), (3) life-force control (*srog rtsol*), (4) retention (*'dzin pa*), (5) recollection (*rjes dran*), (6) samādhi (*ting nge 'dzin*). These are graduated tantric methods leading to recognition. Critical distinction: They prepare the practitioner but don't produce recognition. Dzogchen view: *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence) was never blocked. Practice clears obstacles to seeing what was always present.>
