[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Action winds pure, wisdom winds' aspect: "Action winds pure, wisdom winds' aspect from" (*las rlung dag cing ye shes kyi rlung gi cha las*) marks definitive shift to Dzogchen view. When action winds (*las rlung*)—winds of karma and mundane activity—are purified, wisdom winds (*ye shes rlung*) manifest spontaneously. This is not achieved through force but through recognition. The text names "far-reaching" (*rgyang zhags*)—the first lamp appearing when wisdom manifests. This is *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence)—wisdom self-arises when conditions are present. No practice produces it; practice only removes what obscures it.>
