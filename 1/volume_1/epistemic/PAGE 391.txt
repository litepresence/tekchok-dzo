<Empty bindu experience increase seeing: "Empty bindu experience increase seeing, bliss self-holding appearance from mind turns back" (*thig le stong pas nyams gong 'phel du mthong bas bde ba rang rgyud du 'dzin pa'i snang ba las blo ldog*)—recognition transcends even blissful experiences. Turning back (*blo ldog*) from self-holding bliss prevents new attachment. "Delusion appearance and delusion grasping two analyzed, basisless essence empty, yet not analyzed, mind and appearance object delusion self-awareness binding like appearing" ('khrul snang dang 'khrul 'dzin gnyis po dpyad na gzhi med ngo bo nyid kyis stong yang ma brtags na blo dang snang yul 'khrul pa rang rig 'ching byed ltar snang ba)—profound Dzogchen view: Delusion appears real when not examined; examined, it's basisless. This is *ma yin dgag* (non-implicative negation) of delusion's inherent existence.>
