[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[SIX YOGAS AS RECOGNITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Six yogas from Dzogchen perspective: not practices to perform but recognition-descriptions. Inner heat is *rlung* (energy) of awareness; illusory body is *sgyu ma* (magical display) nature of appearance; dream is *rmi lam* (dream-like) quality of all perception; clear light is *'od gsal* (clear light) of *rig pa* itself; bardo is gap (*gol sa*) between thoughts where recognition occurs; transference is moving (*'pho*) from confusion to recognition without dying. This reframes six yogas as aspects of recognition rather than techniques for transformation.>
