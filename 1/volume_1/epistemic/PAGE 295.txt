Explains three ignorances with four conditions. From spontaneous jewel locket nature's unceasing appearance, base not changing though appearance changes, following after many objects. Dharmakaya appearance not changing, though delusion appearance seems to change. Vajrasattva not possessing delusion, yet shows delusion manner to sentient beings. End: returning self-appearance to self-condition basis. Three delusion-cause ignorances: (1) from self-face not-knowing part only—grasping-holding not arising, (2) co-emergent ignorance—samsara-nirvana two's appearance rain arises, (3) all-imagined ignorance—mind divides two appearances, name-object self-grasping.
