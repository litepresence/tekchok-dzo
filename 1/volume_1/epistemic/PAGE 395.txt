<From blazing lamp: "From blazing lamp" (*sgron ma 'bar ba las*) continues recognition of light phenomena. The text describes how light experiences (*'od*) arise naturally when awareness is recognized. These are not external lights but self-display of *rig pa* (awareness). The Five Lamps manifest as various light forms—vajra chains, spheres, radiance. The description is precise so practitioners can recognize these as signs of correct practice, not become attached to them. "Experience without attachment, realization without pride"—the proper attitude toward all meditative phenomena. The lights indicate path progress, not destination arrival.>
