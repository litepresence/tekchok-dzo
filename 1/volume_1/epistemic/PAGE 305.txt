[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Introduction to subtle body dynamics: The "queens" (*btsun mo*) narrative transitions into contemplative anatomy. The text begins describing how recognition (*ngo shes*) operates through the channels (*rtsa*) and winds (*rlung*). Critical distinction: These are *pratyakṣa* (direct perception) entry points—not anatomical structures but recognition-anchors. The practitioner uses awareness of subtle body processes to recognize the nature of mind. Risk: Literalizing these as physical organs rather than experiential coordinates for recognition. The tantric view treats embodiment as the path (*lus lam*), not as an obstacle to transcend.>
