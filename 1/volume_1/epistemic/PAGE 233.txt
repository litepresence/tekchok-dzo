Completes enumerations of powers (*nus pa*) and pacifying activities through body-speech-mind (*lus ngag yid*). The sixteenfold classification of elaboration-with (*spros bcas*) and elaboration-without (*spros med*) represents tantric skillful means rather than Dzogchen direct recognition. Each empowerment (*dbang*) produces qualities (*yon tan*) including physical excellence, dharma propagation ability, and meditative experience (*nyams*), culminating in the four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) obtained through four empowerments. The progression from outer to inner to secret to complete realization traces a path structure that Dzogchen transcends through direct recognition of *rig pa*.
