[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Subtle body phenomenology: heart-lung channel interface, wind-horse and awareness-resound channel interaction. The anatomical description (habitual tendency-gathering mind, object-analyzing conceptual mind, ignorance as support) operates as transformative technology—not physiological claim. "Adventitious" (glo bur) classification marks these as removable conditions, not inherent nature. The Hevajra and Vibhanga citations establish scriptural warrant for the provisional status of defilements. Epistemic stance: skillful means working with energetic-experiential dimensions, risk of literalizing anatomical metaphors.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Wisdom (ye shes) distinguished from conceptual thought (rtog pa): self-luminous essence (ngo bo rang gsal), core meaning (snying po'i don). Definition operates as pointing-instruction: "knowing the meaning abiding from the beginning." Thal 'gyur citation establishes view-characteristic: "not dwelling in samsara-nirvana two." Self-awareness knowing itself (so so rang gi rig pa) as "omniscience from the beginning"—declarative finality on rigpa-nature, risk of reifying wisdom as entity.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Three wisdoms pedagogically distinguished (ground-abiding, path-arising, fruition-completely perfect) while asserting singularity: "not three different wisdoms but three aspects of single awareness-display." The temporal framework (ground already present, path recognized, fruition fully manifest) operates as instructional provisionality—the distinction is "in recognition, not in the wisdom itself." Epistemic stance: upāya using temporal scaffolding for atemporal recognition—risk of temporalizing primordial nature.>
