Concludes the samaya section with the Tantra of the Perfectly Complete Great One (*rdzogs pa'i snang ba chen po*), affirming compassion (*thugs rje*) as ceaseless. The threefold nature—essence (*ngo bo*), nature (*rang bzhin*), and compassion—abides as the ground from which all kayas manifest without division. The interdependence of *ka dag* (primordial purity) and *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence) is established: the expanse (*dbyings*) contains subtle primordial resonance (*ye gdangs*) as five lights and forms. Neither existing nor non-existing, the ground is free from eternalist and nihilist extremes (*mtha' bral*), the actual state (*gshis kyi gnas lugs*) of things.
