[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GROUND AS SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: MANIFESTATION THEORY]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section develops the concept of the ground as spontaneous presence (lhun grub), the dynamic aspect of primordial purity. While ka dag emphasizes the ground's empty essence, lhun grub emphasizes its unobstructed capacity to manifest. From the Dzogchen perspective, these are not two separate aspects but the indivisible nature of the ground—empty yet manifesting, manifesting yet empty.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding manifestation. Spontaneous presence means that all phenomena arise naturally (lhun gyis) without effort or creation, like reflections in a mirror. The ground's capacity to manifest is not added or acquired but intrinsic to its nature.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes spontaneous presence as the play (rol pa) of awareness. All phenomena—samsara and nirvana, pure and impure appearances—are the self-display (rang snang) of rig pa. They do not arise from causes and conditions as inherently real entities but manifest as the ground's own display.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in relation to spontaneous presence is the recognition that while phenomena appear (conventional), they are empty by nature (ultimate). The appearance is the ground's spontaneous presence; the emptiness is the ground's primordial purity. These are inseparable (dbyer med).

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the fivefold manifestation of spontaneous presence: the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) as the display of the five Buddha families, the five elements as the display of emptiness, the five aggregates as the display of the five wisdoms. All apparent multiplicity resolves into spontaneous presence.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to recognize spontaneous presence in experience. Thoughts are the display of awareness; emotions are the display of wisdom; sense perceptions are the display of emptiness. Nothing needs to be rejected or transformed—recognizing its nature is sufficient.

The section discusses the relationship between primordial purity and spontaneous presence. Ka dag is the essence (ngo bo), lhun grub is the nature (rang bzhin). Essence is the empty, unchanging ground; nature is the luminous, manifesting capacity. They are like a mirror and its reflections—inseparable yet distinguishable.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON], recognizing spontaneous presence as the definitive truth of manifestation. All teachings about dependent origination, karma, and appearance are provisional understandings of spontaneous presence from different perspectives.

The section thus develops the ground's dynamic aspect, showing how the empty essence spontaneously manifests as all phenomena without ever departing from emptiness.
