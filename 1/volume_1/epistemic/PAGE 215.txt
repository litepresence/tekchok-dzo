[RISK: EMPOWERMENT REIFICATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*dbang bzhi* — four empowerments, *smin pa* — ripening/maturation, *spros bcas* — with elaboration, *spros med* — without elaboration, *shin tu spros med* — very without elaboration, *rab tu spros med* — completely without elaboration)
- Hermeneutical precision: Four empowerments framework structured by elaboration levels: (*spros bcas*) body purification, (*spros med*) appearance emptying, (*shin tu spros med*) four activities engagement, (*rab tu spros med*) three gates as deity. The "ripening" (*smim pa*) metaphor—seed planting, sprouting, flowering, fruiting—indicates progressive recognition, not ontological transformation.
- Temporal warnings: The four stages are recognition-modes, not temporal sequence.
- Ontological warnings: The empowerments are not external bestowals but recognition-activations. To view them as received from outside contradicts Dzogchen's view of *rang grol* (self-liberated).
- Pedagogical purpose: The framework provides graduated entry for practitioners of different capacities. However, ultimate empowerment is recognition of *ka dag*—nothing to receive, nothing to ripen.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION] — Believing four empowerments must be received sequentially. [RISK: EMPOWERMENT REIFICATION] — Treating empowerments as external transmissions rather than recognition-facilitations.>

[RISK: ELABORATION HIERARCHY]
[RISK: PURIFICATION REIFICATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): ('khor 'das* — samsara-nirvana, *zag bcas zag med* — contaminated/uncontaminated, *dbang bsgyur* — controlling power, *lus ngag yid sems* — body speech mind consciousness)
- Hermeneutical precision: Four empowerments as controlling (*dbang bsgyur*) power over saṃsāra-nirvana, contaminated-uncontaminated phenomena. The outer (*phyi*), inner (*nang*), secret (*gsang*), and utterly secret (*rab tu gsang ba*) dimensions correspond to purification of body-speech-mind-consciousness. The "sixteen-fold" (*bco drug*) structure integrates with elemental (*'byung ba*) purification.
- Temporal warnings: The "purification" (*dag pa*) is recognition of primordial purity, not temporal cleansing.
- Ontological warnings: To be purified implies impurity—contradicting *ka dag*. The "purification" is removal of *ma rig pa* (non-recognition), not transformation of impure into pure.
- Pedagogical purpose: The elaborate structure trains systematic recognition. However, ultimate recognition transcends all elaboration levels—*spros pa kun zhi ba* (cessation of all elaborations).
- Risk explanation: [RISK: ELABORATION HIERARCHY] — Treating "completely without elaboration" as superior state rather than recognition that all levels are equally *ka dag*. [RISK: PURIFICATION REIFICATION] — Believing phenomena are actually purified rather than recognizing they were never impure.>
