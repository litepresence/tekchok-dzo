[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[SECRET EMPOWERMENT PRACTICES]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Secret empowerment practices: vase-breathing (*bum rlung*), fire-drops (*me thig*), four blisses (*bde ba bzhi*)—progressive subtle body cultivation. These are *lam* (path) techniques for generating conditions conducive to recognition. The four blisses (bliss, supreme bliss, bliss of cessation, coemergent bliss) map onto four stages of energetic opening. In tantra, bliss is deliberately cultivated; in Dzogchen, bliss is spontaneous (*lhun grub*) quality of recognition. Secret empowerment authorizes these practices but does not guarantee recognition—it creates favorable conditions.>
