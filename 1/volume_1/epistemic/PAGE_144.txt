[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ACCUMULATIONS AND PURIFICATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE METHODS]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]

This section presents the Dzogchen approach to the two accumulations (tshogs gnyis)—merit (bsod nams) and wisdom (ye shes)—and their relationship to purification. From the Dzogchen perspective, these are conventionally necessary but ultimately transcended in recognition.

The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. Provisionally, merit and wisdom are accumulated through practice to create conditions for recognition. Ultimately, they are spontaneously present in the natural state and merely revealed.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that in the natural state, there is nothing to accumulate. Merit and wisdom are primordially present as the compassionate energy and empty essence of awareness. Accumulation is the conventional description; recognition is the ultimate reality.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in accumulation is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of gathering merit and wisdom, ultimately they are not things to be gathered but qualities to be recognized as present.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: in Dzogchen, the two accumulations are complete in the ground. The path reveals them; the result manifests them. They are not produced through practice but recognized as spontaneously present.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to understand accumulation in Dzogchen. While engaging in practices that conventionally accumulate merit and wisdom, recognize that these are already complete. This recognition transforms conventional practice into Dzogchen view.

The section discusses the relationship between accumulation and recognition. For those who have not recognized, accumulation creates favorable conditions. For those who have recognized, accumulation is the spontaneous expression of that recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains that while accumulation is [PROVISIONAL MEANING] in its conventional form, the recognition of completion is [NGES DON]. Both aspects are valid; the ultimate transcends yet includes the conventional.

The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of accumulation—conventionally practiced, ultimately complete, the two accumulations are the display of primordial purity recognized through practice.
