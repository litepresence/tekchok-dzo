[RISK: TEMPORAL REIFICATION]

<The cosmological degeneration completion—karmic winds arousing afflictions (*bag la nyal*), decline of glory (*dpal*), radiance diminution—presents standard Buddhist eschatology. The four continent population sequence establishes conventional geographical framework. Risk: Reading primordial radiance loss as historical fall from grace rather than recognition of adventitious obscuration.>
