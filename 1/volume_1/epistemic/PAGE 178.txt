[ATiyoga AS Dzogchen PREPARATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Atiyoga (*shin tu rnal 'byor*) as Dzogchen preparation: highest tantric vehicle, sometimes equated with Dzogchen, sometimes distinguished. In this text's framework, Atiyoga bridges tantra and Dzogchen—using tantric methods with Dzogchen view. The distinction is subtle: Atiyoga may still involve subtle body practices (*rtsa rlung*); Dzogchen transcends all method. Atiyoga's completion stage is Dzogchen's ground. The relationship is culmination (*mthar thug*)—Atiyoga completes tantra, Dzogchen completes Atiyoga. Both are *nges don* (definitive) from tantric perspective; Dzogchen alone is definitive from Dzogchen perspective.>
