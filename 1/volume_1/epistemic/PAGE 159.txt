[GURU YOGA AND EMPOWERMENT]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Guru yoga and empowerment relationship: guru yoga maintains and deepens empowerment. Empowerment authorizes; guru yoga actualizes. The guru is empowerment-source; guru yoga is empowerment-activation. Four empowerments received through guru yoga practice—visualizing guru as embodiment of empowerment principles. This is tantric logic: guru concentrates lineage blessings (*brgyud pa'i byin rlabs*), making them accessible. The practitioner receives empowerments again and again through guru yoga—not new empowerments, but deeper recognition of original empowerment's meaning.>
