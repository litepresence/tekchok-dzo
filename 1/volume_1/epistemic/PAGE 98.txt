[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR VISIONS OF THODGAL]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PROGRESSIVE MANIFESTATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the four visions (snang ba bzhi) of thodgal practice—the progressive stages through which spontaneous presence manifests. From the Dzogchen perspective, these visions are not achievements to be attained but the natural unfolding of awareness when unobstructed by conceptual mind.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding the four visions. They represent progressively deeper recognitions of the display of awareness, culminating in the exhaustion of phenomena into primordial purity. These are not psychological experiences but direct perceptions of reality.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the four visions as the self-manifestation of the ground's spontaneous presence. They are not created by practice but revealed when obscurations dissolve. The practitioner does not "have" visions but allows them to arise as the natural expression of awareness.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in the four visions is the recognition that while visions appear (conventional), they are empty by nature (ultimate). The practitioner recognizes each vision as the play of awareness, neither grasping nor rejecting.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the four visions in order:

1. Direct perception of dharmata (chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba): The initial vision where awareness recognizes its own nature as empty and luminous.

2. Increase of experience (nyams gong 'phel): The vision expands and intensifies as recognition deepens, manifesting as bindus, light rays, and pure realms.

3. Maturation of awareness (rig pa tshad phebs): The vision matures into stable recognition, where awareness is fully present in all its dimensions.

4. Exhaustion of phenomena (chos zad): All phenomena dissolve into primordial purity; awareness recognizes itself as the source and substance of all appearance.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to work with each vision. The practitioner neither blocks nor follows the visions but maintains recognition of their nature as awareness's display. Each vision deepens the recognition established in trekcho.

The section discusses the relationship between the four visions and the path. They represent natural stages of recognition, not goals to be achieved. The practitioner progresses through them naturally as obscurations dissolve and recognition stabilizes.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the four visions, recognizing them as definitive manifestations of awareness. While they appear progressively, their nature is the same—empty yet luminous display of primordial purity.

The section thus presents the four visions as the natural stages of thodgal practice, the progressive manifestation of spontaneous presence as awareness recognizes itself.
