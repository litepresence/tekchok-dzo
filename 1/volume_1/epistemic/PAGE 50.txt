[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The eighteen elements (*khams bco brgyad*) analysis—six objects, six sense-faculties, six consciousnesses—presents phenomenological framework bridging Abhidharma and Dzogchen. The "container realm from memory" (*dran pa gzhis che ba*) and "nature-display from awareness" (*rig pa yod pas rang rtsal*) terminology marks transitional sems-side language. Risk: Confusing conventional epistemology with Dzogchen direct recognition of awareness-nature.>
