Presents the eight qualities (*yon tan*) of spontaneous presence's eight appearing-methods. From Secret Essence: great compassion relates tamer and tamed, six realms timelessly abide. If light-tone and awareness base had no appearance-aspect, elements wouldn't be clear. Without them, awareness would be cut off internally. Non-dual appearance allows three doors (body-speech-mind) to relate as indivisible three kayas. Buddha-appearance in awareness-face exists through pure wisdom door. Pure/impure can appear in spontaneous presence like a window, but pure/impure don't exist in the base itself.
