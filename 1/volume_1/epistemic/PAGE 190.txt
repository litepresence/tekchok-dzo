[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[VIEW, MEDITATION, CONDUCT, RESULT]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Dzogchen view (*lta ba*), meditation (*sgom pa*), conduct (*spyod pa*), result (*'bras bu*)—all are unity, not sequence. View is recognition; meditation is continuous recognition; conduct is recognition in activity; result is recognition's exhaustion of confusion. No separate view to hold, meditation to do, conduct to perform, result to achieve. All are *rig pa*'s self-expression. This is *bya rtsol* (effort/contrivance) transcended—spontaneous perfection (*lhun grub*) of all aspects.>
