<Liver channel and golden vessel: "Also from that itself" (*yang de nyid las*) continues vital point exposition. "Its right corner channel abides, this name liver channel golden vessel" (*de yi g.yas zur rtsa gnas te 'di mng mchin rtsa zang ma zhes*) identifies the liver channel (*mchin rtsa*) as "golden vessel" (*zang ma*)—indicating its precious, essential function. "This gall liver all diseases benefits" (*di gtar mchin nad kun la phan*) claims therapeutic benefit for liver-gallbladder conditions through working with this channel. This overlaps with Tibetan medical theory, showing integration of tantric and medical paradigms. The subtle body framework serves both spiritual and physical health.>
