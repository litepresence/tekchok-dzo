[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[TANTRIC VEHICLES SUMMARY]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL SYNTHESIS]

<Tantric vehicles summary: Kriyā, caryā, yoga, mahāyoga, anuyoga, atiyoga—progressively closer to recognition. Each vehicle has empowerments, samayas, practices, results appropriate to capacity. The progression is from external to internal, from elaboration (*spros bcas*) to simplicity (*spros med*), from gradual to instantaneous. Atiyoga is tantric vehicle closest to Dzogchen—sometimes considered synonymous, sometimes preliminary. The distinction: Atiyoga uses tantric means with Dzogchen view; Dzogchen transcends means entirely. This is Nyingma hermeneutical framework.>
