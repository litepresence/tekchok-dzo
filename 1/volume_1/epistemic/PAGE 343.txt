<Caste typologies and subtle body: "Eyes rounded, limbs slender is elephant-nose caste" (*mig zlum zhing yan lag phra ba ni glang sna ma'i rigs*) applies ancient Indian caste typology to subtle body characteristics. These are not social hierarchies but energetic signatures—different body types channel energy differently. The text describes how "in the context of abiding, males more than females have vessel superiority" (*gnas skabs su skyes pa bs bu snod lhag pa*)—gender differences in subtle body capacity according to tantric physiology. This is descriptive phenomenology of embodiment, not social prescription. The practitioner works with their specific energetic configuration.>
