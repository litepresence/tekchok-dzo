<Heat and temporal calculations: "Heat" (*tsa ba*) and fever indicate fire element excess. "One year, twelve months" (*lo gcig la zla ba bcu gnyis*) begins temporal calculations for life span. The text describes how to calculate life expectancy based on channel vitality—number of channels, their condition, wind flow quality. This is tantric life science: understanding embodiment's temporal limits to motivate practice. Knowing death approaches inspires diligence. The calculations are not fatalistic—they identify when practice is most urgently needed. This is *maranasati* (death mindfulness) in tantric form.>
