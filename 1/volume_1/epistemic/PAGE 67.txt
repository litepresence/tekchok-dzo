[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TANTRIC VEHICLES INTRODUCTION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: RESULT VEHICLE FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON PREPARATION]

This section introduces the six inner vehicles of tantra (nang gi theg pa drug), marking the transition from causal to result vehicles ('bras bu'i theg pa). Unlike the outer vehicles that gradually accumulate causes for enlightenment, the tantric vehicles recognize enlightenment as already present and employ methods to directly reveal this primordial perfection. From the Dzogchen perspective, this shift represents a fundamental change in orientation—from becoming to recognizing.

The epistemic framework distinguishes three outer tantras (phyi rgyud sde gsum)—Kriya, Upa, and Yoga—and three inner tantras (nang rgyud sde gsum)—Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga. The outer tantras maintain more dualistic frameworks, emphasizing purity, mantra, and visualization. The inner tantras progressively dissolve duality, culminating in Atiyoga's non-dual recognition of rig pa.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] encompasses all six tantric vehicles while transcending them in Atiyoga. Each tantra represents a valid approach appropriate to practitioners of different capacities, yet all are expressions of the same natural state. The distinction between vehicles is pedagogical rather than ontological—all phenomena are equally the display of primordial awareness.

The causal-result distinction is crucial here. Causal vehicles work through cause and effect: purification leads to purity, accumulation leads to result. Result vehicles recognize that the ground itself is pure, the result is already present. Kriya tantra's emphasis on external purity, Upa's balance of external and internal, and Yoga's internalization all progressively approach this recognition.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the philosophical positions of each tantra. Kriya views the deity as external and superior, the practitioner as impure and inferior. Upa balances this with recognition of non-duality. Yoga internalizes the deity completely. Mahayoga dissolves ordinary perception into mandala display. Anuyoga recognizes all phenomena as the play of primordial energy. Atiyoga transcends even these frameworks in direct recognition.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the distinctive practices: Kriya's elaborate ritual purity, Upa's integration of method and wisdom, Yoga's completion stage practices, Mahayoga's generation stage, Anuyoga's perfection stage, and Atiyoga's direct introduction to rig pa. Each method is a doorway to the same recognition.

The [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] operates throughout. Conventionally, the tantric vehicles employ elaborate methods, visualizations, and rituals. Ultimately, these are all expressions of the natural state, methods to disrupt ordinary perception and reveal the primordial purity underlying all phenomena.

The section prepares for detailed exposition of each tantric vehicle, establishing the hermeneutical principles that guide the presentation. The practitioner is reminded that while the methods differ, the goal is the same—the recognition of rig pa as the nature of mind.

The epistemic stance maintains that tantric methods are [PROVISIONAL MEANING] insofar as they are means, but they point to [DEFINITIVE MEANING] insofar as they reveal the natural state. The progression from outer to inner tantras represents increasing subtlety and directness, with Atiyoga as the most direct pointing.
