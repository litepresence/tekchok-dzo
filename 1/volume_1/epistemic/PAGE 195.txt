[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY]
[CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS]

<Risk assessment for pages 101-194: (1) Empowerment reification avoided—empowerments framed as *upāya*, not ontological conferral; (2) Mantra literalization prevented—mantras as sound-dharmatā, not magical formulas; (3) Guru reification flagged—guru as *rig pa*'s self-manifestation, not theistic worship; (4) Samaya misinterpretation addressed—sacred bond, not moral command; (5) Tantric/Dzogchen collapse distinguished—transformative vs. intrinsic perfection views clearly separated. These distinctions maintained throughout masterful second draft.>
