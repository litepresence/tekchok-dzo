[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Sky person's connection not established: "That sky person's connection not established" (*nam mkha' de skyes bu dang 'brel ba ma grub*) continues critique of reification. Empty sky without cognizance lacks living quality of awareness. "Le is" (*le ni*) introduces *thig le* (bindu) as cognizant aspect—wisdom essence that knows. This prevents view collapse into mere emptiness. Dzogchen view requires both *stong pa* (emptiness) and *gsal ba* (clarity). Bindu represents nondual wisdom—empty yet knowing, clear yet unstained. The text carefully navigates between eternalism (reifying awareness) and nihilism (emptiness without cognizance).>
