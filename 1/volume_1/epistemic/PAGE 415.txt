<Kun gzhi's characteristics: manifold appearance as perceived, six consciousnesses as perceiver in three realms, with bodies, pleasure, pain, mind's deluded aspects. This is samsara's display—apparently real, fundamentally unreal. Dharmakāya's characteristics: none of these, not dwelling with conceptual mind.>

<From *Rang shar*: Kun gzhi holds conceptual thought as various deluded knowings. It is ignorance-thing itself, thus called kun gzhi. Sentient being's basis and buddha's basis—distinguished by only one distinction. This distinction is recognition (*rig pa*) versus non-recognition (*ma rig pa*).>

<From *Mu tig phreng ba*: Kun gzhi itself is accumulation; dharmakāya outflows exhausted. Empty yet luminous, luminous yet pervading. Uncontaminated by thought, awakened upon remembering. Free from elaboration, like space pervading and empty. Self-pure, free from all indicators.>
