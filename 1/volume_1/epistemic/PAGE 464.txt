[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<From warmth, measure, and signs: two truths unified, conceptual extremes exhausted. Without action, characteristics empty. Expression-basis ceasing, extremes not dwelling. Outflows exhausted, not possessing defilement. Memory's source ceasing, essence clear.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<From *Thal 'gyur*: sign-recognition of rigpa placed on the scale delivers dharmas to the place of exhaustion. One familiarized with sphere makes delusion-appearance empty, seeing dharmatā's pure object, drawn out from attachment's source.>
