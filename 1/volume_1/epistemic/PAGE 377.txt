[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Proof general placement: "Proof general placement" (*'thad pa spyir dgog*) establishes theoretical foundation for wind classifications. "That appearing aspect makes characteristics-grasping wisdom" (*de snang ba'i cha nas mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i ye shes su byed la*) describes how wind patterns manifest as discriminating wisdom. Risk: View collapse—thinking winds produce wisdom. Winds support conditions for wisdom's recognition; they don't create wisdom itself. Dzogchen view: Wisdom (*ye shes*) is self-arisen (*rang byung*), not produced by causes. Tantric method prepares vessel; recognition fills it. The distinction prevents fundamental error.>
