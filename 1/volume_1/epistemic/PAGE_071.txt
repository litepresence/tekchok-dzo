[DZOGCHEN VIEW – INNER TANTRAS INTRODUCTION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: DEFINITIVE TANTRA FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section introduces the three inner tantras (nang rgyud sde gsum)—Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga—marking the transition from the dualistic approaches of outer tantra to the non-dual recognition of inner tantra. Unlike the outer tantras that work through gradual purification, the inner tantras recognize primordial purity and employ methods to directly reveal this recognition. From the Dzogchen perspective, these represent progressively more direct approaches to the natural state.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] as the guiding principle. The inner tantras all share the fundamental view that enlightenment is already present, that the ground is primordially pure (ka dag), and that practice consists of recognizing this rather than creating it. This represents a paradigm shift from causal to result vehicles ('bras bu'i theg pa).

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes Mahayoga and Anuyoga as skillful means leading to Atiyoga, the most direct recognition of rig pa. Each inner tantra offers a unique approach: Mahayoga through elaborate generation stage mandalas, Anuyoga through the perfection stage of channels and energies, and Atiyoga through direct introduction to the nature of mind. All three converge in the recognition of the natural state.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] operates in the inner tantras as the recognition that all phenomena are the display of awareness. Conventionally, the practices appear distinct; ultimately, they are all expressions of the same recognition. The generation stage, perfection stage, and Great Perfection are not sequential stages but different doorways to the same realization.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the inner tantras' fundamental position: all phenomena are primordially pure, the deity is the expression of awareness, the practitioner realizes this through practice. The view is no longer dualistic but non-dual—the separation between sacred and profane, pure and impure, has dissolved.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the distinctive practices of each inner tantra. Mahayoga emphasizes the generation stage (bskyed rim) with its elaborate mandalas and deity yogas. Anuyoga emphasizes the perfection stage (rdzogs rim) working with channels (rtsa), energies (rlung), and essences (thig le). Atiyoga transcends both in direct recognition (ngo sprod) of rig pa.

The section introduces the fivefold classification of Atiyoga: the three sections (sde gsum) of semde, longde, and mengagde, plus the outer and inner divisions. This classification represents different approaches to the same recognition, appropriate for practitioners of different capacities and inclinations.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the inner tantras, recognizing that they point directly to the definitive meaning—the natural state of rig pa. While methods remain provisional, the view is definitive. The transition from outer to inner tantra represents a shift from purification to recognition, from becoming to being.

The section thus establishes the framework for the detailed presentation of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga that follows. The practitioner is reminded that while the methods differ in sophistication and directness, the goal is always the same—the recognition of primordial purity and spontaneous perfection.
