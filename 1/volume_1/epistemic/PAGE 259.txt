[REALIZATION-BASE DEPENDENCE]

<Lines 10638-10640: "realization-of before realization-base exist and, then cognition-of mind arise cause realization-to base not depend, base-to realization-of mind depend even"—if basis exists before realization, then cognitive mind arising causes realization not to depend on basis, yet basis depends on realization-mind. This is circular: basis requires realization, realization requires basis. Lines 10641-10644: "realization-of before exist must cause pervade, not realize also base be-if base being what know, mind know-if not realize also base being fall, those etcetera-of faults perceive also"—if realization must exist before, this pervades everything. If non-realization is also basis, what is known? If mind knows, non-realization falls to being basis. Many faults perceived. This critiques causal models of awakening: basis cannot precede realization (would be inaccessible), realization cannot precede basis (would be groundless).>

[DETERMINED BASIS REFUTED]

<Citation from Six Spaces (10645-10646): "determined base called show-to"—but "this also correct essence not" (*yang dag ngo bo nyid ma yin*). Lines 10647-10652: Example of eye-yellow-possessors (*mig ser can*)—those with jaundice see conch as yellow. "Self-to revert-of distinction by-means-of, self other two not determined limit free, therefore that also correct not"—through distinction of self-reversion, self and other not determined, free from limits, therefore not correct. This is *gzhan stong* (other-emptiness) influenced: basis empty of other (determinations), not self-empty. Lines 10653-10657: "cause determined effect determined cause, self permanent and difference not become, this also knowable not, said that also previous and same"—determined cause-effect without difference becomes permanent self, unknowable. Same as previous refutation.>

[CHANGE AND BASIS]

<Lines 10658-10660: Fourth position: "essence direction and kind-to not divide and, appearance whatever change able"—essence not divided from direction/kind, appearance whatever change able. Refutation (10661-10663): "base change able-if pure Buddha impure confusion become, who-by-means-of also effort without sentient beings Buddha-as change cause liberate follow"—if basis can change, Buddha becomes confused; sentient beings become Buddha without effort. Lines 10664-10667: "also effect cause revert follow, change-of base being cause, earth etcetera matter also awareness become and, awareness also matter become follow"—effect-cause reversion follows; basis as changeable cause means matter becomes awareness and vice versa. Lines 10668-10679: Detailed analysis: if essence not divided changes, or other changes, either essence cannot be basis (10670) or other dharmas change from basis (10671), damaging essence (10672). Permanent change impossible (sky, 10675); impermanent change already changed (10676). Three-times argument: past/future non-existent cannot change (10677); present already arisen-ceased (10678), later part not born, non-existent (10679). Exhaustive refutation of change as basis characteristic.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PRIMORDIAL COMPLETENESS]
[BEYOND CAUSALITY]

<The four positions refuted (spontaneous presence, not-determined, determined, changeable) exhaust conceptual possibilities. The actual Dzogchen view: basis transcends all categories because it is primordially complete (*ye nas rdzogs pa*). The refutations apply to reified views, not to recognition. Key insight from 10677-10679: three-times analysis shows change is conceptually impossible—past/future non-existent, present already gone. Yet change appears. This appearance is *lhun grub*—spontaneous presence—not causally produced, not inherently existent, yet vividly manifest. The basis is not "something" that changes or doesn't change. It is *ngo bo nyid* (suchness) beyond existence/non-existence, change/ permanence, determined/undetermined. Recognition (*rtogs pa*) is not cognitive event in time (refuted 10638-10644) but timeless immediacy. The extensive logical analysis serves to exhaust intellect so recognition can occur without conceptual obstruction. This is *thal 'gyur* (prasaṅga) methodology applied to Dzogchen view.>
