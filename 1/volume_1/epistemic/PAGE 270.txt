[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SYNTHESIS OF ASPECTS 1-2]
[ESSENCE-NATURE NON-DUALITY]

<Synthesis of primordial purity (essence) and spontaneous presence (nature). Lines 11181-11189: "buddha all possession secret great at, nature possession part at abide, thus and, previous from, nature spontaneous-presence appearance, jewel casket intention, inside wisdom jewel appearance clear at, outside limitless not-separate, youth vase body actual-state called is"—secret great possession of all buddhas; nature possession abiding as parts; thus from previous: nature spontaneous presence appearance; jewel casket intention; inside wisdom jewel appearing clearly; outside limitless not separate; called youth vase body actual state. The "youth vase body" (*gzhon nu bum sku*) is *gzhi'i sku*—ground body, not fruit body. Lines 11190-11199: "third meaning gathering is, essence primordially pure thing and mark not-exist, nature spontaneous-presence by-means-of body and wisdom gather-separate not-exist intention abide, that two essence one by-means-of appear empty two not-exist, that actual-state essence empty not-change body identity is, body three gather-separate not-exist sun center like inside clear although thing and mark not-established, nature primordial-resonance light clear although outside appear color marked not-exist, compassion awareness wisdom abide although form outside object not-investigate, essence nature compassion three abide"—third, meaning gathering; essence primordially pure without things/marks; nature spontaneous presence: body and wisdom without gathering-separating; those two as essence-one appear empty, two non-existent; actual state: essence empty, unchanging body identity; three bodies without gathering-separating like sun's center: inside clear, things/marks not established; nature primordial resonance light clear, outside appearing color without marks; compassion awareness wisdom abiding, form not investigated outside; essence/nature/compassion three abide. This is *snang stong gnyis su med pa*—appearance-emptiness non-dual.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RANGSHAR SUN MANDALA]
[THREE KAYAS AS GROUND]

<Citation from *Rang shar*. Lines 11201-11207: "I not-exist earlier front at base thus abide, base primordially-pure great called, essence nature compassion form three-as abide, essence that not-change wisdom not-cease clear, youth vase body actual-state called, nature light five appearance not-cease, compassion appearance example like sky cloud not-exist like"—I don't exist earlier/at base thus abiding; basis great primordially pure; essence/nature/compassion three forms abide; essence unchanging, wisdom not ceasing, clear; youth vase body actual state; nature five lights not ceasing; compassion appearance like sky without clouds. The sun mandala metaphor (implied 11195): sun's center clear, rays appearing—three kayas as one ground:
- **Dharmakāya**: sun center (*nyi ma'i dbus*)—clear, unchanging
- **Saṃbhogakāya**: sun rays (*'od zer*)—light, colors
- **Nirmāṇakāya**: sun warmth (*dro ba*)—manifesting to beings

Not three separate things but three aspects of single radiance. This is *sku gsum* as *gzhi*, not as 'bras bu (fruit).>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THAL 'GYUR COMPLETION]
[BEYOND CONCEPTUALITY]

<Citation from *Thal 'gyur* completing ground section. Lines 11209-11222: "essence primordially-pure wisdom at, ignorance called exist-name not-exist, one and two number not-exist, examine by-means-of exist not-exist establish not-exist, where not-divide dharma-nature from, wisdom only also accomplish not-exist, word not-exist speech accomplish not-exist, end at not-abide self-aware pure, speech hold name end exhaust, cause not-exist condition number not-exist at, two appearance object and subject not-exist, characteristic where-also divide not-exist, subject coarse exhaust, primordially not-exist by-means-of pure by-means-of pure"—essence primordially pure at wisdom; ignorance called: existent name non-existent; one/two numbers non-existent; examining exist/non-exist: establishment non-existent; dharmatā not dividing anywhere; wisdom only also not accomplished; word non-existent, speech not accomplished; not abiding at end, self-aware pure; speech holding names exhausted; cause non-existent, conditions non-existent; appearance two: object/subject non-existent; characteristics nowhere divided; coarse subjects exhausted; primordially non-existent, therefore pure; pure therefore... The repetitive structure emphasizes: conceptuality exhausted (*rtog pa zad*), subject/object dissolved (*gzung 'dzin zad*), only self-aware purity remains. This is *zab khrid* (profound instruction) on ground: not to be established through analysis, only recognized through *rig pa*.>
