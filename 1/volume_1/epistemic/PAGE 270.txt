Summarizes the unity of Aspects 1-2: Essence as primordially pure without things/marks, Nature as spontaneous presence with indivisible kayas/wisdoms. The three kayas abide like the sun's mandala—clear within yet unestablished as things/marks externally. This establishes *snang stong gnyis su med pa* (appearance-emptiness non-dual). The Self-Arisen tantra presents the ground (*gzhi*) as abiding in threefold aspect: unchanging essence (*ngo bo mi 'gyur ba*), five lights as nature (*rang bzhin 'od lnga*), and compassion like a cloudless sky.
