[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Tongue upper right palate side: "Tongue upper right direction palate side" (*lce steng g.yas phyogs ya rkan phyogs*) locates specific channel junction at the palate. This is *khecarī mudrā* territory—tongue positioning for bindu retention and bliss generation. The subtle body map extends to finest details: palate, uvula, nasal cavity, all have energetic significance. "Second, actual basis" (*gnyis pa dngos gzhi ni*) transitions to main practice instructions. The text moves from anatomy to application—from knowing the terrain to walking the path. This is tantric pedagogy: establish view, then method.>
