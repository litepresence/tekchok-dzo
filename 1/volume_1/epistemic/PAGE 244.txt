Details the ten distinctions (*khyad par bcu*) for protecting samaya through knowledge of empowerment, view, meditation, and reality. The specific enumeration of body-speech-mind samayas with outer-inner-secret divisions (totaling nine) provides structured practice for tantric yogis. These classifications serve practitioners requiring gradual engagement. From the Dzogchen perspective, since body-speech-mind are already the vajra nature (*rdo rje*), there is nothing to protect or violate. The distinctions function as pedagogical tools for those not yet recognizing the samaya king (*dam tshig rgyal po*) as their own awareness.
