[FORM REALM HEAVENS – VIRTUE CLASSIFICATION]

<Third absorption (*bsam gtan gsum pa*) form realm heavens classified by virtue extent. Lines 1221-1222: "virtue root expand from arise by-means-of, body measure sixty four life also interval eon that much last"—Limitless Virtue (*dge rtsal tshad med*), body 64 measures, life one intermediate eon. Lines 1223-1226: "that below at jewel Indra from various ornament called sky to, above from cut from beings to measure without virtue called, virtue root measure without from establish cause, body measure thirty two life also interval eon that much"—below jewel Indra (*in+d+ra*) sky, "cut from above" (*gong ma las chad*) beings measureless virtue—Limitless Virtue (*tshad med dge*). Virtue root measureless. Body 32 measures, life one intermediate eon. Lines 1227: "some from virtue increase above to measure without virtue say also exist"—some say Increasing Virtue (*dge rgyas*) above Limitless Virtue. Lines 1228-1231: "that below at jewel patangkaling by-means-of various ornament called sky to, above from expand virtue small called gods those, that also above from virtue fruit small in dwell by-means-of that sound called, body measure sixteen life also interval eon that much"—below jewel Patangkaling (*pa tang ka ling*) sky, expanding from above—Small Virtue (*dge chung*), dwelling in small virtue fruit. Body 16 measures, life one intermediate eon. Geometric progression: 64 → 32 → 16 measures, encoding hierarchical merit distribution.>

[FORM REALM – LIGHT CLASSIFICATION]

<First absorption (*bsam gtan dang po*) light-based classification. Lines 1232-1234: "that below at jewel kekeru various ornament called sky to, above from expand light clear body to light clear cause, body measure eight life also interval eon eight"—below jewel Kekeru (*ke ke ru*) sky, expanding from above—Clear Light (*'od gsal*), body clear/light cause. Body 8 measures, life 8 intermediate eons. Lines 1235-1237: "that below at jewel glory pile called sky to, above from expand measure without light body light to measure without by-means-of that sound called, body measure four life also interval eon four"—below jewel Glory Pile (*dpal brtsegs*) sky—Limitless Light (*'od tshad med*), body light measureless. Body 4 measures, life 4 intermediate eons. Lines 1238-1245: "that below at jewel brave light called sky to, above from expand is light small called, body light above from small cause that sound called"—below jewel Brave Light (*'od zer 'phro*) sky—Small Light (*'od chung*). Body light from above small cause. Form realm (*gzugs khams*) structured by absorption (1st-4th) and virtue/light quality. Not eternal liberation but superior samsara—meditative stability (*bsam gtan*) result, not wisdom (*ye shes*).>

[RISK: MEDITATIVE HIERARCHY CONFUSION]

<The systematic halving of body measures (64→32→16→8→4) and temporal durations presents cosmology as mathematical precision. Risk: Taking these as objective astronomical facts rather than *bsam gtan* (meditative absorption) correlates. The form realms correspond to stages of samādhi:
- First absorption: light-based heavens (Clear Light, Limitless Light, Small Light)
- Second absorption: virtue-based heavens (Cloudless, Increased Virtue, Limited Virtue)
- Third absorption: cloudless clarity
- Fourth absorption: pure abodes

Dzogchen view: All *bsam gtan* realms are still *sgom lam* (path of meditation), not *mi slob lam* (path of no-learning = liberation). Meditative stability suppresses afflictions (*nyon mongs*) but doesn't eliminate their seeds (*bag chags*). Form realm gods (*gzugs khams kyi lha*) have long lives but eventually fall to lower realms when merit exhausted.

Key distinction: *bsam gtan* = temporary suppression; *rig pa* = permanent liberation. The elaborate cosmology motivates practice by showing samsara's heights, but ultimate goal transcends all realms. Risk: Attachment to form realm rebirth as goal; actual goal is recognition beyond form/formlessness.>
