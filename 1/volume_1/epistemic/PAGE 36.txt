[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: SPATIAL REIFICATION]

<The form realm heaven enumeration (Limitless Virtue, Cloudless, Increasing Virtue, Small Virtue, Luminous, Limitless Light, Small Light, Great Brahma, Ministers, Retinue) with systematic halving dimensions follows Abhidharmic cosmology. The geometric progression establishes conventional hierarchical framework. Risk: Literalizing spatial gradations as ontological stratification rather than meditative absorption correlates.>
