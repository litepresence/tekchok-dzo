[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

Presents Samantabhadra's explanation from the Gem Treasury Tantra on how qualities complete from emptiness through non-born miracle. The eight arising-makers (*'char byed brgyad*) manifest as compassion's indivisible great compassion, with appearance self-clear and non-ceasing. The non-dual essence appears as two yet is one nature. This describes the ground's manifest power (*rtsal*) without temporal sequence—primordially pure appearance (*ye dag pa*) abiding in own-face, not established through designation yet appearing through eight methods. The text risks temporalizing these as processes rather than atemporal spontaneous presence.
