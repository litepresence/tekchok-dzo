<Embryological narrative: The "scent-eater approaching mind seeking body to sustain" (*dri za nyer 'jug pa'i sems lus 'tshol ba'i phyir 'ongs pa*) describes the intermediate state (*bar do*) and conception process. This sems-side description explains samsaric rebirth through habitual grasping (*'dzin pa*). The text details how consciousness (*sems*) enters the womb, merges with blood and milk (*khrag dang 'o ma 'dres pa*), and develops the dualistic tendencies (*gnyis kyi rigs*). Pedagogical function: Understanding rebirth mechanism motivates recognition practice. Risk: Literalizing embryology as biological fact rather than contemplative phenomenology. The point: See the process to transcend it.>
