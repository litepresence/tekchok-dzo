[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]

<Mantra science (*sngags kyi bshad pa*) introduction: mantra as *sgra* (sound) and *don* (meaning) unified. Sound as vibrational pattern, meaning as resonance in awareness. Tantric mantric power (*sngags kyi mthu*) derives from sound-dharmatā identity—not external magic but intrinsic resonance. Seed syllables (*sa bon*) as compressed wisdom-nature. Mantric vehicles classification: kriyā, caryā, yoga, yogottara, anuttara—progressive intimacy with deity/reality. This is provisional (*drang don*) from Dzogchen view: all vehicles converge on *rig pa* recognition.>
