[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

Familiarizing with meditation's key points, the lamp appearing, recognizing previous training—like meeting a former acquaintance.

<Thus the three buddha bodies—ground naturally abiding lineage (*gdul bya rigs*), path-ripening empowerment lineage (*smin bya rigs*), fruition-liberation sign lineage (*grol bya rigs*). Through these three aspects, buddhahood is established. This is the condensed meaning of the entire Volume 1.>

<The ground of liberation—primordial purity (*ka dag*)—is not something to be achieved but recognized. The path of familiarization—spontaneous perfection (*lhun grub*)—is not something to be cultivated but allowed. The fruition of liberation—direct crossing (*thod rgal*)—is not somewhere to arrive but what is already manifest. Volume 1 complete.>
