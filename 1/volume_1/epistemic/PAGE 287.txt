Continues self-dissolution: non-dual self-dissolving, number-holding attachments become single-one free from elaboration. In non-two one-method, self-dissolve is nirvana. Like rivers dissolving into rivers without distinction—indivisible great nirvana. Extreme-free self extreme-free, self-nature self-dissolving: body-speech holding self-continuum all exhaust as nirvana. Like space dissolving into space without identification—four extreme thought-attachments self-cease, non-abide great nirvana. Impure samsara self-enter door, nature's pure door—dissolve as non-going method, like tent draw-strings gathered to center by drawing.
