<Empty bindu lamp: "Empty bindu lamp" (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*)—the fifth lamp, culmination of Four Lamps. Empty bindus are essences dissolved into space-emptiness, not absence but luminous emptiness. "Ultimate non-conceptual bindu" (*don dam spros pa med pa'i thig le*)—beyond all elaboration (*spros bral*), this is dharmakāya's essence. The text moves through Five Lamps progressively: from coarse (far-reaching water) to subtle (empty bindus). Each lamp reveals deeper dimension of awareness. Yet all are equally expressions of same nature—*rig pa* (awareness) displaying its own *rtsal* (dynamic energy). No hierarchy in nature; progression is pedagogical, not ontological.>
