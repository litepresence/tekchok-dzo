[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: EXTERNALIZATION]

Defines samaya (*dam tshig*) as binding (*bchings pa*) what is difficult to transcend (*'da' dka'*), the vajra pledge. The root samayas of body-speech-mind (*sku gsung thugs*) and twenty-five branch samayas present provisional structures for those not yet recognizing *rig pa*. The classification into view (*lta ba*), conduct (*spyod pa*), practice (*sgrub pa*), common, particular, and crucial samayas serves as pedagogical scaffolding. In Dzogchen, samaya is not external obligation but the self-liberated nature of mind (*rang sems*) free from deception (*gyo sgyu*), already complete without preservation or violation.
