<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*lus 'byung bzhi* — body four elements, *rgya bzhi 'jig pa* — destroying four prisons, *bcu drug dag pa* — sixteen purifications, *phyi nang gsang ba yongs rdzogs* — outer inner secret complete)
- Hermeneutical precision: The four elements (*'byung bzhi*) purification framework extended to sixteenfold (*bcu drug*) structure through elemental subdivision. Each of the four empowerments has four aspects: outer (*phyi*), inner (*nang*), secret (*gsang ba*), utterly complete (*yongs rdzogs*)—totaling sixteen. This structure purifies (*dag byed*) the "four prisons" (*rgya bzhi*) of conceptual elaboration.
- Temporal warnings: The sixteen-fold structure is analytical framework, not temporal progression.
- Ontological warnings: The "destruction" (*'jig pa*) of prisons is recognition of their non-existence from beginning (*gdod nas med pa*). No actual destruction occurs—only recognition.
- Pedagogical purpose: The complex structure provides thorough analytical framework for those needing systematic approach. However, Dzogchen recognizes directly that all elaborations (*spros pa*) are *ka dag*—no progressive destruction required.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION] — Believing sixteen stages must be traversed sequentially. [RISK: OBSTACLE REIFICATION] — Treating conceptual prisons as real entities to be destroyed rather than recognizing they never existed.>

[RISK: OBSTACLE ACCUMULATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*yid* — mind/intellect, *sems* — mind/consciousness, *rtog pa* — concept/thought, *dri ma* — obscuration/defilement, *snang yul* — appearing object, *bag chags* — latency/imprint)
- Hermeneutical precision: Distinction between *yid* (intellect, engaged with general objects, unrelated to direct perception) and *sems* (consciousness, holding appearing objects as existent/non-existent). Analysis of sixteen obscurations (*dri ma bcu drug*) to be purified: body, speech, mind, consciousness obscurations; conceptual, perceptual, latency-related defilements.
- Temporal warnings: The obscurations are analytical categories, not accumulated entities.
- Ontological warnings: The *dri ma* (obscurations) have no independent existence—they are *ma rig pa* (non-recognition) itself. To treat them as real entities contradicts Dzogchen's view of *ka dag*.
- Pedagogical purpose: The detailed analysis exhaustively enumerates what requires recognition. However, the ultimate point: no obscurations exist to be purified—*ka dag* is beyond all purity and impurity.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: CONCEPTUAL REIFICATION] — Treating analytical categories as real existents. [RISK: OBSTACLE ACCUMULATION] — Believing obscurations accumulate and must be progressively eliminated rather than recognizing their primordial non-existence.>
