[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS TSAM AND DBU MA SCHOOLS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PHILOSOPHICAL STRATIFICATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: VIEW ASSERTION]

This section introduces the crucial distinction between the Mind-Only (sems tsam) and Middle Way (dbu ma) schools, which form the philosophical foundation for understanding Dzogchen's unique position. The text presents these two mahayana philosophical systems as progressively refined approaches to understanding emptiness and the nature of mind, with the Middle Way representing the highest philosophical achievement of the sutric tradition before entering the tantric and Dzogchen vehicles.

The Mind-Only school, represented by masters like Asanga and Vasubandhu, asserts that all phenomena are mind-only (sems tsam), denying the external existence of objects while maintaining the true existence of the perceiving mind. This represents a [PROVISIONAL MEANING] view from the Dzogchen perspective—profound yet still falling into the extreme of eternalism by reifying consciousness. The epistemic stratification [DZOGCHEN VIEW] vs [PROVISIONAL VIEW] is evident here, where Dzogchen recognizes mind as empty even as it cognizes.

The Middle Way school, particularly the Prasangika-Madhyamaka of Chandrakirti, deconstructs all positions including Mind-Only's subtle reification of consciousness. Through reductio ad absurdum arguments (prasanga), it demonstrates that all phenomena lack inherent existence (svabhava) without asserting any positive position. This represents the highest [PROVISIONAL MEANING] of the philosophical schools, yet from the [DEFINITIVE MEANING] Dzogchen view, even this sophisticated emptiness remains a conceptual designation.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is central to both schools, yet Dzogchen introduces a third perspective—the natural state (gnas lugs) beyond both truths, where appearance and emptiness are inseparable (dbyer med). The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] holds that rig pa is beyond the subject-object structure that both Mind-Only and Middle Way attempt to analyze.

The viewpoint tag [NGES DON] begins to emerge more strongly as the text transitions from philosophical analysis to direct recognition. The Middle Way's thorough emptiness prepares the ground for Dzogchen's view that all phenomena are primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously perfect (lhun grub). However, where Middle Way achieves this through philosophical reasoning, Dzogchen points to direct recognition beyond reasoning.

The section thus establishes the philosophical foundations necessary for understanding Dzogchen's unique contribution. Without the Middle Way's thoroughgoing emptiness, Dzogchen could be mistaken for a form of eternalism or Mind-Only idealism. With it, Dzogchen's view of the natural state becomes the fruition of the mahayana philosophical project—not negating emptiness but embodying it in direct, non-conceptual awareness.

The epistemic stance maintains that philosophical views are [DRANG DON] skillful means, while Dzogchen represents the [NGES DON] direct pointing to awareness. Yet these are not contradictory—the philosophical analysis clears away misconceptions, preparing the mind for the direct recognition that transcends all views.
