[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[MANTRA AS SOUND-REALITY]
[RISK: MANTRA LITERALIZATION]

<Mantra as sound-reality (*sgra don*), not merely symbolic: tantric view that vibration and awareness are non-dual. Recitation (*bzlas pa*) is not petitioning external power but resonating intrinsic wisdom. Risk: Taking mantras as magical formulas with automatic efficacy. Critical distinction: Mantras work through *mos gus* (devotion/faith) and *shes rab* (wisdom), not mechanical causation. The power (*mthu*) is recognition's resonance, not external force. This bridges to Dzogchen's spontaneous sound but maintains tantric method-structuring.>
