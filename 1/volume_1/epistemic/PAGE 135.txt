[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COMPLETION IN THE GROUND]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRIMORDIAL PERFECTION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON DEFINITIVE]

This section presents the Dzogchen view that all completion is already present in the ground—nothing needs to be added, nothing can be removed. From the Dzogchen perspective, the ground is spontaneously perfect (lhun grub), complete with all qualities since beginningless time.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in its fullest sense. Unlike paths that speak of developing qualities, accumulating wisdom, or purifying obscurations, Dzogchen recognizes that all qualities are already present. The path reveals rather than creates.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the ground is complete with the qualities of the three kayas, the five wisdoms, and all enlightened attributes. These are not produced through practice but revealed through recognition. The practitioner does not become a Buddha but recognizes Buddha-nature.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in completion is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of developing qualities, ultimately they have always been present. The path is revelation, not creation.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the ground is complete with all excellent qualities (yon tan). Nothing is missing; nothing needs to be added. The fruition is not the acquisition of new qualities but the recognition of what has always been present.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to rest in this completion. Instead of trying to achieve something, rest in the recognition that all is already complete. This resting is itself the manifestation of completion.

The section discusses the relationship between this view and effort. While effort is necessary conventionally to reveal what is hidden, Dzogchen emphasizes that the completion itself requires no effort—it is the natural state. Effort is only needed to maintain recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for completion in the ground, recognizing it as the definitive truth. All teachings about development and achievement are provisional; the ultimate truth is primordial completion.

The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of spontaneous perfection—all qualities complete in the ground, nothing to achieve, nothing to become, only recognition of what has always been perfectly present.
