<Central channel abiding straight: "In the center abiding straight" (*dbus na drang por gnas te*) describes the central channel (*dbu ma*) running vertically through the body's core. The right channel (*ro ma*, feminine/wisdom side) and left channel (*rkyang ma*, masculine/method side) flank it. This is energetic topology, not anatomical description—the channels exist at the level of subtle body (*lus phra mo*), not gross body (*lus rags pa*). "Relative cause from that maturing into blood" (*kun rdzob kyi rgyu de las khrag tu smin*) describes how relative (*kun rdzob*) bindus manifest as blood at the gross level. Multiple levels: ultimate bindu (wisdom essence), subtle bindu (energetic marker), relative bindu (physical correlate).>
