[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

The passage operates from the perspective of primordial awareness as foundational ground. The description of Samantabhadra "abiding in the thought of non-dual body and awareness" and the characterization of teaching as "beyond cause and effect, beyond activity" asserts the Dzogchen view that reality is not produced by causes and conditions. The phrase "dharmata time beyond activity" and "primordial sphere" establish the atemporal, uncaused nature of awareness. The classification of vehicles positions Dzogchen as the "unsurpassable vehicle" — a hermeneutically definitive claim within this tradition, not a comparative evaluation.

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

The transition to identifying the "secret mantra vajra vehicle" as the pinnacle marks a shift to tantric classification schema. This serves a polemical function in establishing hierarchical distinction between vehicles while maintaining that tantra represents the "complete completion" — a claim operative within tantric hermeneutics rather than an objective assessment.
