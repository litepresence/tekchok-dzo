[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EQUAL TASTE]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: NON-DUAL EXPERIENCE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the equal taste (ro snyoms) as the fruition of Dzogchen view—all phenomena experienced as equal in the nature of mind. From the Dzogchen perspective, equal taste is not a philosophical position but the direct experience of primordial purity in all situations.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding equal taste. Unlike dualistic experience that discriminates between pleasant and unpleasant, good and bad, samsara and nirvana, equal taste recognizes all phenomena as the display of awareness, neither accepting nor rejecting.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that equal taste is the natural expression of primordial purity. When awareness is recognized as the nature of all phenomena, there is nothing to accept or reject, nothing to hope for or fear. All experiences are equal in being the display of rig pa.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in equal taste is the recognition that while conventionally we experience preferences and aversions, ultimately all phenomena are empty and equal in that emptiness. The practitioner maintains this recognition in all circumstances.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the equal taste of the eight worldly concerns (chos brgyad)—praise and blame, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, fame and disgrace. These are equal in the nature of mind; none can harm or help the one who recognizes this.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to cultivate equal taste. Through continuous recognition of the nature of mind, all experiences become opportunities for practice. Pain is equal to pleasure, adversity is equal to prosperity, samsara is equal to nirvana.

The section discusses the relationship between equal taste and ethical behavior. While equal taste transcends conventional distinctions, it does not license harmful behavior. The natural expression of equal taste is compassionate activity, not nihilistic indifference.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for equal taste, recognizing it as the definitive experience of the natural state. While conventional ethics maintain distinctions, the ultimate view is equal taste.

The section thus establishes equal taste as the natural expression of Dzogchen view—the experience of all phenomena as equal in the nature of mind, neither accepted nor rejected, neither good nor bad.
