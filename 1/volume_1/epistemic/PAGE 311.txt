[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Completion stage methodology: "Riding the swift horse" (*mgyogs pa'i rta bskyon*) introduces dynamic wind (*rlung*) practices. The text systematically describes how winds move through channels (*rtsa*), carrying consciousness (*sems*) through various bodily locations. This is *sngags lam* (mantra path)—tantric technology for transforming embodiment. The practitioner learns to direct awareness through energetic pathways to interrupt habitual patterns. Key distinction: These are *upāya* (skillful means), not descriptions of ultimate nature. The practices function as preparation for recognition (*ngo sprods*), not as the recognition itself.>
