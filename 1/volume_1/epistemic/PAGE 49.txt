[FIVE ELEMENTS ANALYSIS]

<Basis aggregate nature, sense-base variety, apprehender faculties' essence, object-subject patterns. First: numerous and vast meaning called element (*khams*). Divisions: outer object-gathered and inner mind-gathered two. First: five elements—producing and abiding form-possessers, destruction's cause-conditions, support and essence-maker. Earth characteristic hard and firm; water moist and wet; fire hot and burning; wind moving and lifting; space vast and opening. These produce container-contained holding. From that, outer object-gathered elements five: earth element produces body's basis; water element holds as name; fire element ripens objects; wind element all moving worlds depend; space element holds faculties.

Inner mind-gathered elements: container and contained appearing two. Container: karma-accumulated object-like appearance. Divisions: outer object appearance from mind's confusion; inner mind appearance from display as nature. First: object appearance mind's latencies like dream. Divisions: desire objects four continents etc.; form objects five lights self-clear like rainbow; formless objects samadhi self-emanation others not seeing. From Sun-Moon Eclipses (*nyi zla kha sbyor*): inner mind-gathered elements two: sentient beings gathering container element and mind-itself produced element. Container element: sentient beings great mindfulness basis produced form element.>
