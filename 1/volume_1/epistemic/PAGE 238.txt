Enumerates thirty-two marks (*mtshan*) and thirty clairvoyances (*mngon shes*) arising from thirty-two empowerments, presenting a systematic path of purification. The sixfold clairvoyances of prajna (*shes rab*) view purification—training, learning, hearing, thinking, and meditation—trace progressive stages of wisdom development. The five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) with their sixfold divisions express the complete transformation of consciousness. These enumerations represent pedagogical scaffolding, not temporal achievements. The structure dissolves when *rig pa* recognizes its own nature, rendering path-based purification unnecessary.
