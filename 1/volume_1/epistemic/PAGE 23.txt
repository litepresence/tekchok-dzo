[RISK: ELEMENTAL REIFICATION]

<The separating-wind (*'byed par byed pa'i rlung*) cosmogony with turquoise-colored interstitial space (*gseng byed sa'i nam mkha'*) and four earth-goddesses holding golden vases operates within elemental-transformation framework. The stupa-terrace (*mchod rten gyi bang rim*) analogy for layered element accumulation presents conventional cosmological pedagogy. Risk: Treating elements as substantial entities rather than dependently-originated appearances.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<The citation from *rDo rje rtse mo 'jig rten bkod pa* establishes Dzogchen scriptural grounding for cosmological presentation. The fivefold elemental action teaching—water ripening, fire clarifying, wind atomizing, space opening, earth stabilizing—transposes external cosmogony into internal recognition framework. This sems-side instruction prepares for definitive view while remaining within conventional elemental language.>
