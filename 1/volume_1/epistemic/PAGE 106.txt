[NON-DOING AS DOING]

<Essence (*ngo bo*) without phenomena (*chos med pa*) therefore Buddha-name also non-existent—this undermines even the reification of enlightenment. Nature (*rang bzhin*) as power-display appearing (*rtsal du shar ba*) shows samsara/nirvana as view-appearance. Characteristics without singular certainty (*gcig tu ma nges pa*) means view-meditation (*lta sgom*) is measureless (*tshad med*). The second division: essence as birthless thoroughly pure therefore afflictions self-liberated, nature as unceasing universally appearing therefore acceptance/rejection non-existent.>

[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<The *gtar ka gegs bsal* (obstacle removal) category uses progressive metaphors for view-meditation-conduct stability. View's heat (*lta ba'i drod*) when moving is like recognizing the thief as the householder recognizes thieves; when obtained, like fire burning wood; when stable, like the army victorious in battle. These are *lam* (path) descriptions for those needing gradual confidence-building, not the recognition itself. The metaphors progressively undermine their own necessity until conduct (*spyod pa*) liberates appearances.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Nature without cause-fruition therefore no self-determination to go elsewhere; characteristics without need for habituation therefore knowing not dependent on other. The phrase *chos nyid gyi gegs bsal bas* (obstacle removed by dharmatā) means obstacles were never other than recognition—*bstan du med pa* (indemonstrable) as essence, *phyogs med* (directionless) as nature, *brtgs na mi rnyed* (unfindable when examined) as characteristics. This is root-rotting (*rtsa rul*) of samsara/nirvana—radical undermining, not philosophical negation.>
