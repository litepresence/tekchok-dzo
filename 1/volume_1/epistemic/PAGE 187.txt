[NON-MEDITATION AND NON-ACTIVITY]
[NON-DOING AS DOING]

<Non-meditation (*sgom med*) and non-activity (*bya med*): not rejection of meditation/activity, but recognition that *rig pa* is never not meditating, never not acting. Meditation implies subject-object; *rig pa* is non-dual. Activity implies agent-action; *rig pa* is spontaneous (*lhun grub*). The phrase *bya rtsol* (effort/contrivance) transcended—no deliberate action, no contrived meditation. This is *chos spyod* (dharmic activity)—activity without actor, meditation without meditator.>
