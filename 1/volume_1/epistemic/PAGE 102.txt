[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The *klong dkar po* (white space/expanse) category presents Dzogchen view through two modalities: (1) *las rgya che ba brjod med du bshad pa* (explaining great activity as inexpressible) and (2) *lta sgom kha sbyar* (view-meditation combined/joined). The essence (*ngo bo*) as *mthong ba cer grol* (seeing precisely/merely liberated) indicates *lta ba* (view) as immediate recognition without gradation—seeing itself IS liberation, not a cause for future liberation. This is *ye grol* (primordial liberation) versus *bsgrol* (liberating).>

[ONTOLOGICAL SPONTANEITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Ocean-space (*rgya mtsho'i klong*) and sky-space (*nam mkha'i klong*) represent the two primary classifications. Ocean-space's essence as *rtag mtha' rang grol* (eternal extreme self-liberated) transcends the extreme of eternalism (*rtag mtha'*). The division into great/small ocean-space distinguishes capacity: great (*chen po*) for those with thoroughly pure observation (*ltos pa yongs su dag*), small (*chung ba*) for those realizing conditions as primordially inexpressible. Both point to *chos nyid*—not different realities but different recognition capacities.>

[SPONTANEOUS ACCOMPLISHMENT]

<Sky-space (*nam mkha'i klong*) essence: dharmatā uncorrectable/unfabricable (*chos nyid bcos su med pa*) therefore mind-essence self-liberated (*sems nyid rang grol*). The two divisions—sun-moon space (*nyi zla'i klong*) and jewel white-space (*rin po che'i klong dkar po*)—represent luminosity (*gsal ba*) and purity (*dag pa*) aspects. The phrase *yon tan yongs su rdzogs pas* (qualities completely perfected) indicates *lhun grub* (spontaneous accomplishment): causes/conditions self-purified without mind's fabrication, dharmatā naturally accomplished.>

[PEDAGOGICAL DISTINCTION]

<The *klong rab 'byams* (vast expanse) category's essence: appearing as mind-known (*snang bar sems kyis shes*), non-appearing as abiding-mode-known (*mi snang bar gnas lugs kyis shes*). This is *sems sde* characteristic—relying on mind (*sems*) as knower. The fourfold division (outer, inner, secret, suchness vast expanse) corresponds to progressive subtlety. The three essential points of causeless irreversibility, conditionless non-harm, and cause-condition non-establishment progressively undermine reification until *'khor 'das gang yang ma grub* (samsara/nirvana nothing established).>
