[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DEITY AS SELF-APPEARANCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Deity from Dzogchen view: not visualized but self-arisen (*rang byung*). The deity is *rig pa*'s self-appearance (*rang snang*), not constructed image. Five Buddha families (*rigs lnga*) are *rig pa*'s five wisdom-aspects spontaneously present. Maṇḍala is *chos nyid*'s self-organizing display. This reframes deity yoga: not transforming impure into pure, but recognizing intrinsic purity (*dag pa*). The recognition that all appearance is deity-appearance is *lha'i snang pa*—divine perception as recognition, not visualization technique.>
