<Third: divisions of ground, path, and fruition. Ground-abiding wisdom naturally present. Path-arising wisdom recognized through practice. Fruition-completely perfect wisdom fully manifest. These are not three wisdoms but one wisdom described from three perspectives.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Five wisdoms: dharmadhātu, mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing. These are not five separate wisdoms achieved sequentially but five aspects of single awareness-display, simultaneously present, pedagogically distinguished.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The five wisdoms correspond to the five afflictions transformed—ignorance becomes dharmadhātu wisdom, aversion becomes mirror-like wisdom, pride becomes equality wisdom, attachment becomes discriminating wisdom, jealousy becomes all-accomplishing wisdom. Not that afflictions are transformed into wisdoms, but that their nature is wisdom when recognized.>
