Presents the Peaceful Body (*zhi ba'i sku*) as self-awareness king (*rang shes rig gi rgyal po*) and Wrathful Body (*khro bo'i sku*) as wisdom Herukas, continuing the kaya classification system. The enumeration of 128 perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa*) of empowerment fruit and thirty-six sense-power clairvoyances (*mngon shes*) trace tantric paths of purification. The text identifies these as ripening the ground's (*gzhi*) primordial clear light (*'od gsal*), emphasizing that apparent attainments manifest the already-pure nature (*rang bzhin rnam dag*). These structures are pedagogical devices, not progressive achievements in time.
