Three causes (*rgyu gsum*) of ignorance with three conditions equal three times. **Immediate condition** (*de ma thag rkyen*): equal. Four conditions act at individual times. Wisdom recognizes Buddha and sentient being as one, transcending accept/reject. **Liberation**:
- Cause condition: liberate in self place
- Object various: liberate as self-appearance by reality
- Object condition: liberate self place from different objects

Mirror analogy: face (self), mirror (basis), light (awareness).>
