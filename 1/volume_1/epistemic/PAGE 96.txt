[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TREKCHO PRACTICE]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: CUTTING THROUGH METHOD]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents trekcho (khregs chod), the practice of cutting through, as the primary method for recognizing primordial purity. From the Dzogchen perspective, trekcho cuts through all conceptual elaborations to reveal the naked nature of mind beyond all attempts to grasp or describe it.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding trekcho. The practice cuts through three types of conceptual mind: the mind that grasps at appearances as external objects, the mind that grasps at the perceiver as a substantial self, and the subtle mind that grasps at meditation itself as an achievement. What remains is the naked awareness beyond all grasping.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes trekcho as the direct path to primordial purity (ka dag). While other practices work through gradual refinement, trekcho cuts immediately to the heart of the matter—recognizing that awareness has always been pure, has never been stained by delusion, and requires no improvement.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in trekcho is the recognition that while conventionally we practice cutting through, ultimately there is nothing to cut through. The conceptual mind is empty by nature; recognizing this is the cutting through.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes trekcho's fundamental point: all phenomena are self-liberated (rang grol), all thoughts are self-liberated, all emotions are self-liberated. Nothing needs to be transformed; recognizing its nature is sufficient.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes trekcho practice in detail. First, the master gives direct introduction (ngo sprod) to the nature of mind. Then the practitioner maintains this recognition through "sky-like" meditation—open, vast, without focus or support. Thoughts are allowed to arise and liberate themselves without intervention.

The section discusses the four ways of leaving things as they are (cog bzhag bzhi): leaving the view as it is (without modification), leaving meditation as it is (without distraction), leaving conduct as it is (without acceptance or rejection), and leaving the result as it is (without hope or fear). These are the essence of trekcho.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for trekcho, recognizing it as the definitive method for revealing primordial purity. While it may use provisional techniques to point to recognition, its essence is the direct seeing of the natural state.

The section thus establishes trekcho as the primary practice for realizing primordial purity, cutting through all conceptual obstacles to reveal the naked awareness that has always been present.
