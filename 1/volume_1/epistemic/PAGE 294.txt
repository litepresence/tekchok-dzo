Details delusion mechanism: compassion capacity to appear to sentient beings. From grasping-making consciousness, ignorance part arises—mere shift creates "I arose from that" or "that arose from me" consciousness, deluding. Ignorance doesn't exist in base, exists in experience/appearance. Four conditions from appearance: cause condition (basis light-house manner), master condition (investigating), object condition (subject grasping like mirror face), immediate condition (three time-equal). Self not-knowing self-face in own basis establishes realm-three samsara.
