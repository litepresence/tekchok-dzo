<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*ngag 'dres* — speech mixing, *gsung gi bdag nyid* — nature of speech, *me long yu ba* — mirror-like, *don dam kun rdzog dbyer med* — ultimate and conventional inseparable)
- Hermeneutical precision: Three phases of mixing/integration: body mixing (*lus 'dres*) becomes nature of body (*sku'i bdag nyid*), speech mixing (*ngag 'dres*) becomes nature of speech, mind mixing (*sems 'dres*) becomes nature of mind. The "mirror-like" (*me long yu ba can*) skull-cup with substances represents *ngo bo* (essence) and *rang bzhin* (nature) inseparability. The "invisibility" technique using animal eyes and substances is *rdzogs rim* (completion stage) technology for transmuting ordinary perception.
- Temporal warnings: The mixing is recognition-integration, not temporal blending.
- Ontological warnings: The substances and techniques are *rten* (supports), not causes of realization. To believe they mechanically produce effects contradicts Dzogchen's view of *rang byung* (self-arisen).
- Pedagogical purpose: The elaborate techniques train in perception-transformation. However, ultimate "invisibility" is recognition that *chos nyid* has no form to see—beyond all technique.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: MAGICAL THINKING] — Believing substances mechanically produce invisibility or other powers. [RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM] — Treating body-speech-mind mixing as literal merging rather than recognition of innate nature.>
