[OUTER CONTAINER MANDALA]

<Outer container (*snod*) mandala formation. Lines 11607-11613: "outer-container five-elements mandala formation-from, earth and, water and, fire and, wind and, element great space exist-do, that-from grasping thought speech-by-means-of not-perceive and"—from outer container five elements mandala formation: earth, water, fire, wind, and great space element exist; from that, not perceiving by means of grasping thought speech. Five elements form the container world—the environment for sentient beings. These are not material but *'od lnga*—five lights as wisdom display. "Not perceiving" (*ma mthong*)—failure to recognize elements as wisdom display leads to fixation. Lines 11614-11628: Six afflictions and six realms: "desire and, hatred and, delusion and, pride and, jealousy and, anger and six are, that-from beings types six arisen-are, jealousy-from human-in form, anger-from god-in form, pride-from god not-in form, desire-from hungry-ghost-in form, delusion-from animal-in form, hatred black-from hell-in form-do, thus types six appearance-in form-do, that cyclic-existence place-is"—six afflictions: desire, hatred, delusion, pride, jealousy, anger; from that, six types of beings arise: from jealousy—human form; from anger—god form; from pride—god non-human form; from desire—hungry ghost form; from delusion—animal form; from black hatred—hell form; thus six types appear in form; that is samsara's place. **Karmic etiology**: affliction (*nyon mongs*) → action (*las*) → rebirth (*skye gnas*). This is *samsara* structure—not punishment but natural maturation of mental states.>
