Describes samsara's arising from the outer container mandala of five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space). From these arise six afflictions—desire, hatred, delusion, pride, jealousy, anger—forming six classes of beings: jealousy to human, anger to god, pride to asura, desire to hungry ghost, delusion to animal, hatred to hell. This is samsara's place (*'khor ba'i gnas*). From one great base-mode (*gnas lugs*), four appearance-modes arise; from four base-modes, four appearance-means manifest. The four great appearances: spontaneous presence to various, Enjoyment Body to sense-organs, Emanation Body to form, sentient beings to distinct appearances with obscuration.
