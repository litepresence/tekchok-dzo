<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*phye ma leb kyi sbubs* — castor oil plant capsule, *byang sems mi 'phro* — bodhicitta not leak, *ku mu du* — flower, *pad+ma ral gri* — lotus knife/vagina, *sems dpa' gzhon nu* — hero youth/virgin, *khra mo* — tigress)
- Hermeneutical precision: Preparatory substances and techniques for *byang sems* retention: castor oil capsules, donkey argha water, dog flesh shadow-dried powder, vajra channel massage, *ku mu du* flower, lotus knife channel opening, *khra mo* (tigress) and *seng ge* (lion) postures. These represent *rdzogs rim* (completion stage) preparatory practices for energetic containment.
- Temporal warnings: These preparations are preliminary, not ultimate practice.
- Ontological warnings: The substances are supports (*rten*), not causes of realization. The "tigress" and "lion" postures are energetic configurations, not magical transformations.
- Pedagogical purpose: The elaborate preparations train careful attention and commitment. However, the ultimate "preparation" is recognition of *ka dag*—no substance or posture required.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM] — Believing that substances mechanically prevent leakage. [RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION] — Becoming fixated on preparatory practices rather than recognizing their purpose as supporting recognition.>

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*stabs* — stance/posture, *phrag pa* — shoulders, *rked pa* — waist, *tsigs* — joints, *gnad* — crucial point, *rlung gi dkyil 'khor* — wind mandala, *ye shes* — primordial wisdom)
- Hermeneutical precision: Body posture techniques: tigress (*khra mo*) stance with shoulders and waist bound, lion (*seng ge*) stance with joint control, bamboo (*spre'u*) stance with straight back, rtsa key wheel posture with wind mandala visualization. These postures aim to reverse ordinary *rlung* flow downward/upward and redirect into central channel for *ye shes* (wisdom) activation.
- Temporal warnings: Postures are sustained energetic configurations, not momentary positions.
- Ontological warnings: The postures are *lam gyi rten* (path supports), not causes of realization. To believe specific postures mechanically produce awakening is *sgrub mtha' rgyu 'bras* (causal-resultant tenet).
- Pedagogical purpose: The postures train energetic awareness and control. However, the ultimate "posture" is recognition of *sems nyid* (mind itself)—no physical position required.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM] — Treating postures as mechanically effective rather than as supports for recognition. [RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION] — Becoming attached to posture mastery rather than recognizing their provisional nature.>
