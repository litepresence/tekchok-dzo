[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[DEVOTION AS PATH]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: GURU REIFICATION]

<Devotion (*mos gus*) as path: *mos* (faith/trust) and *gus* (respect/reverence) open practitioner to transmission. In tantra, devotion is recognition-readiness—the guru cannot give what student cannot receive. Devotion is capacity for recognition, not emotional dependency. Critical risk: Devotional language misunderstood as theistic worship. Tantric devotion is recognition-relationship: guru represents *rig pa*; devotion is willingness to recognize. The guru's blessing (*byin rlabs*) is recognition activated by devotion—not external force, but intrinsic quality awakened through openness.>
