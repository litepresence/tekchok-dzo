[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]
[RISK: NIHILISM]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

This passage presents the thirty-six activities of the Dharmakaya through systematic negation. The structure — outer/inner/secret activities for body, speech, and mind — uses tantric organizational schema while the content operates from Dzogchen's non-assertive perspective.

The negations (not-change, not-come, not-go, not-dwell; not-appear, not-do, not-emanate, not-gather; clear-open, even, loose, direct) function as [NEGATIONAL CLEARING] — removing false views rather than establishing positive attributes. This is not a "thing" described through negation, but the nature of awareness beyond all conceptual predicates.

The Dzogchen technical terms (lhun grub — spontaneous presence, rang snang — self-appearance) indicate operation from the rigpa-side perspective where awareness is self-illuminating without object/subject structure.

Risk flags: 
- [RISK: NIHILISM] — The extensive negations could be misread as nihilistic denial of all phenomena
- [RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE] — Without proper context, the negations may collapse into either nihilism or a subtle reification of "emptiness" as a thing

The passage assumes familiarity with Dzogchen's distinctive use of negation as pointing-out rather than logical refutation.

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

The brief shift to describing the "five perfections" in which Samantabhadra dwells represents a mind-based explanation used as pedagogical entry. This provisionally frames what is beyond framing for instructional purposes.
