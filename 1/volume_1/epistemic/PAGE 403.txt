<The lamp's nature is unborn clarity—empty yet manifesting all appearances. The five elements appear as five lights, not transformed from impure substances but spontaneously present as awareness-display. This is the natural glow (*rang gdangs*) of rigpa itself, not a visualization to be constructed.>

[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Familiarization methods described—eye gazes, body postures, breath techniques—these are skillful means (*thabs*) for those who have not yet recognized. For one who has recognized, they are descriptions of what already is. The bindu moves, light radiates, awareness knows itself—this is not a process to complete but recognition to dawn.>

<The spontaneously perfect display (*lhun grub kyi snang ba*) is not the result of practice but the nature of awareness itself. The three bodies (*sku gsum*) are not achieved through meditation but recognized as already present. Dharmakāya as essence, saṃbhogakāya as communication, nirmāṇakāya as manifestation—all three simultaneous, not sequential.>
