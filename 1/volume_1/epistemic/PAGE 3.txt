[DZOGCHEN VIEW – OḌḌIYĀNA DOCTRINE]
[SECRET ESSENCE FRAMING]

<The "definite place" (*gnas nges pa*) of *'od gsal rdo rje snying po* (luminous vajra essence) teaching identifies Dzogchen as *de bzhin gshgs pa thams cad kyi thugs kyi gsang ba* (secret mind of all Tathāgatas). This is *yongs su rdzogs pa chen po* (complete Great Perfection)—not superior to other paths but *ngo bo gcig* (single nature) expressed through *rdo rje'i gnas* (vajra place) as *ngo mtshar rmad du byung ba* (wondrous marvel). The superlative asserts recognition-nature, not exclusivity.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GŪHYAGARBHA CITATION]
[TANTRIC SCRIPTURAL AUTHORITY]

<Citation from *gsang ba rgyal po'i mdzod* (Guhyagarbha Tantra) grounds the exposition in *anuttarayoga* textual tradition. The "primordial protector" (*gdod ma'i mgon po*) manifesting awakening (*mngon par byang chub*) describes *ye shes* (primordial wisdom) not *shes bya* (learned knowledge). "How fields are arranged" (*zhing khams ji ltar bkod pa*) refers to *chos nyid* (dharmatā) topology—not physical cosmography but display-structure of recognition.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TIMELESS SAMANTABHADRA]
[ATEMPORAL BUDDHAHOOD]

<The phrase *samsara-nirvana undifferentiated* ('khor 'das gang du'ang ma phyed) locates Samantabhadra's manifestation "before all" (*kun gyi sngon rol du*)—not temporal priority but ontological ground. *Dbyings rang byung gi ye shes* (self-arising wisdom of expanse) as *bder gshegs snying po* (sugata heart-essence) points to *gdod ma'i gzhi* (primordial ground) appearing as *gzhi snang* (ground-appearance). *Rang byung gi chos gsum* (three self-arisen dharmas) indicates spontaneous (*lhun grub*) display without construction.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMBHOGAKĀYA EXPANSE]
[ENJOYMENT-BODY TOPOLOGY]

<From *that very nature* (*de nyid kyi ngang*), *ye shes lnga* (five wisdoms) purify into fields (*zhing khams*) as *rang snang lhun grub* (self-appearing spontaneous accomplishment). The *dpag tu med pa* (immeasurable) maṇḍala pervading space (*nam mkha'i mtha' klas pa*) describes *longs spyod rdzogs pa* (complete enjoyment) as inexhaustible display. "Beyond trainee's objects" (*gdul bya'i yul las 'das pa*) indicates transcendence of subject-object duality—not inaccessibility but recognition-requirement.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COMPASSION ARISING]
[RESPONSIVE DISPLAY]

<Longchenpa describes *brtsye ba'i thugs rje* (compassion of tenderness) arising upon perceiving beings' confusion (*'khrul pa*) like dreams (*rmi lam*)—causeless confusion (*'khrul rgyu med*) appearing as confusion. This is *thabs* (skillful means) as natural response, not deliberative choice. The arrangement of fields (*zhing khams bkod pa*) for beings' benefit manifests from *longs sku snang cha* (Sambhogakāya appearance-aspect)—display itself is compassion. Risk: Reifying compassion as emotional state rather than natural responsiveness.>
