[RISK: REIFICATION]

The passage presents the "place" of luminous clarity as the definitive abiding condition. Terms such as "primordial ground" (gdod ma'i gzhi), "self-arisen wisdom" (rang byung ye shes), and "spontaneously accomplished" (lhun grub) operate from the perspective of primordial awareness as always-already complete. The description of fields and mandalas as "self-appearing" (rang snang) and "not made by anyone" asserts the non-constructed nature of the display.

The enumeration of pure fields and Buddha activities risks reification if read as literal cosmological assertions rather than phenomenological descriptions of awareness's own display. The passage transitions between describing the "ground" and its "appearances" — a distinction that serves pedagogical purposes but, if taken ontologically, may crystallify into a reified metaphysics.

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

The description of transcending the ground-appearance as "dawning" represents a mind-based explanation used as entry point. The language of "face-knowing" (ngo shes) and "self-arisen three dharmas" operates from the perspective of recognition — a pedagogical framing that points toward rigpa without directly asserting it.
