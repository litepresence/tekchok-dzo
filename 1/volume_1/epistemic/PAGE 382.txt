[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Ultimate four elements pure Four Lamps: "Also ultimate four elements pure Four Lamps maturing" (*de yang don dam gyi 'byung bzhi dag pas sgron ma bzhi smin te*)—Dzogchen view integrates with tantric structure. When ultimate nature is recognized, the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) mature spontaneously—not through practice but through recognition. This is crucial transition: Practice prepares; recognition ripens. The Four Lamps (far-reaching water, self-arisen wisdom, pure space, empty bindus) are recognition-devices that appear naturally when obscurations dissolve. They are not created—they are self-luminous aspects of awareness's own nature (*rig pa rang gsal*).>
