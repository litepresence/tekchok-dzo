[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NYAN THOS THEG PA ANALYSIS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section provides a detailed analysis of the Sravaka vehicle (nyan thos kyi theg pa), presenting it as the foundational approach to Buddhist practice focused on the realization of personal selflessness (gang zag gi bdag med). The epistemic framework here distinguishes between [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING], where the Sravaka view is explicitly positioned as [PROVISIONAL MEANING] from the Dzogchen perspective. The text enumerates the Sravaka's philosophical tenets: recognition of the four noble truths, understanding of the twelve links of dependent origination, and meditation on the sixteen aspects of the four truths.

The stratification employs [VIEW ASSERTION] vs [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION], with the former predominating as the text outlines the Sravaka's ontological commitments. The Sravaka asserts the ultimate existence of dharmas while denying the existence of a permanent self—a position that represents a partial understanding from the Dzogchen view. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] transcends this dualistic framework, recognizing that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence while being the spontaneous display of rig pa.

The section discusses the Sravaka's approach to the five skandhas, analyzing them as "not self, not other than self, not both, and not neither"—a fourfold analysis that deconstructs the notion of a permanent identity. However, from the definitive perspective, this analysis remains within the domain of conceptual elaboration (spros pa). The Dzogchen view holds that rig pa itself is beyond all such analysis, being naturally free from the extremes of existence and non-existence.

The epistemic category [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is applied here, with the Sravaka understanding representing a conventional truth that prepares the ground for ultimate realization. The text maintains that while Sravakas achieve liberation from samsara through their realization of personal selflessness, they do not realize the full emptiness of phenomena (chos kyi bdag med), which remains the domain of the Great Vehicle.

The viewpoint tag [NGES DON] is absent here, replaced by [DRANG DON], indicating that this presentation serves as a skillful means leading toward the definitive Dzogchen view rather than being the final position itself. The Sravaka path functions as a necessary foundation, purifying the coarsest level of attachment and establishing the framework of impermanence and no-self upon which higher teachings are built. Without this foundation, the subtler Dzogchen teachings would be mere words without experiential basis.
