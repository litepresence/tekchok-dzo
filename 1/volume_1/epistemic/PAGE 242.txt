[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: EXTERNALIZATION]

Presents four types of teachers—general guide, samaya-vow bestower, empowerment master, and instruction transmitter—establishing the guru-disciple relationship as the foundation for samaya. The definitions emphasize not-knowing liberated into knowing (*mi shes shes par 'grol*) and becoming a vessel for instruction (*man ngag snod du gyur*). These structures serve those requiring gradual training. In Dzogchen, the authentic guru (*yang dag dpon*) and student (*slob ma*) equally abide on the right ground (*yang dag sa*) when samaya is recognized as non-dual awareness itself, not as an external bond to be kept or broken.
