[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Culmination of symbolic cycle: The narrative reaches its pedagogical climax with recognition of the "thief five poisons" (*rkun mo dug lnga*) as co-emergent with awareness itself. The "old woman fainting" (*rgan mo brgyal ba*) represents the collapse of dualistic grasping when wisdom (*shes rab*) investigates delusion. "Me Lha" (*me lha*)—the fire deity—symbolizes self-arisen wisdom (*rang byung ye shes*) that arises spontaneously when recognition (*ngo shes*) dawns. The phrase "not even a hair's breadth moved" (*spu tsam yang ma song*) expresses the non-dual nature of liberation: nothing actually changes, only recognition occurs.>
