<Body increasing-decreasing action: "Body increasing-decreasing's action does" (*lus 'phel 'grib kyi las byed*) describes how winds govern physical growth and decay. "Youth incomplete three hundred, one year life time does" (*dar la bab pa las sum brgya ma tshang na lo gcig la tshe'i dus byed*) continues life span calculations. The mathematics are precise: incomplete channel rotations correlate with life expectancy. This reflects tantric view of body as clock—winding down through fixed cycles. Practice can slow, stop, or reverse these cycles through wind control. This is *ayurvedic* longevity technology in tantric form.>
