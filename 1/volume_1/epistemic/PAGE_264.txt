[ESSENCE-NATURE-COMPASSION TRIAD]

<Beginning of unsurpassed basis (*bla na med pa'i gzhi*) particular explanation. Lines 10832-10833: "respective parts from elaborately explained, meaning gathering is"—summary gathering of elaborate explanations. Lines 10834-10842: **First aspect**: "beginning base essence primordially pure like conch shell pure unmixed stains like-wise thing and mark not-established, nature spontaneous-presence white inside subtle self-light depth-clear exist although condition not-existing therefore outside not-appear"—beginning basis essence primordially pure like unstained conch shell; thing/mark not established. Nature spontaneous presence: white inside (*dkar po nang khrol*), subtle self-light (*phra ba rang gsal*), depth-clear (*zab gsal*) exists although condition non-existent, therefore outside not appear. Lines 10836-10842: "outside limitless youth vase body actual-state abides, essence primordially pure by-means-of empty, thing not-existing although subtle awareness primordial-resonance self-light not-restricted self-possession, nature spontaneous-presence by-means-of appearance all-of arise-base abide although, self-face outside clear mark marked light and body and color not-appear"—outside: limitless youth vase body (*gzhon nu bum sku*) actual state abides. Essence primordially pure = empty; thing not existing. Nature spontaneous presence = all appearance arises/abides. Self-face outside clear mark not appearing. This is *ka dag* (essence) and *lhun grub* (nature) as ground.>

[PRIMORDIAL RESONANCE]

<Lines 10843-10849: "one and, different and, separate not-is manner by-means-of light-clear supreme spontaneous-presence jewel casket, youth vase body field, essence nature compassion three possession supreme abide, essence empty by-means-of thing and mark not-established, nature clear by-means-of primordial-resonance appearance self-face not-abandon, compassion awareness by-means-of know wisdom expand arise-base not-cease abide"—one AND different AND not separate: manner of light-clear supreme spontaneous presence jewel casket (*rin po che'i sgrom*). Youth vase body field: essence-nature-compassion three possession supreme abide. Essence: empty → thing/mark not established. Nature: clear → primordial resonance (*rang sgra*) appearance self-face not abandon. Compassion (*thugs rje*): awareness → knowing wisdom expands, arise-base not ceasing. Lines 10850-10864: Citation from "auspicious beautiful great tantra" (*bkra shis mdzes ldan gyi rgyud chen po*): "realize buddha not-arisen, not-realize sentient-being not-arisen earlier front in, awareness self-arisen wisdom base from not-moved, condition not-existing appearance three together abide, that then again awareness wisdom itself by-means-of self abide-manner actual-state this spoke, oh appearance great vast expanse this unmoved dharma-body great from, not-confused buddha great as abide, essence body not-cease abide, essence not-change, method secret, unmoved, not-move, not-shaken"—buddha/sentient being not arisen; awareness self-arisen wisdom unmoved from base; condition non-existing; appearance three together abide. Self-abide manner actual state. "Oh appearance great vast expanse, unmoved dharmakāya"—not-confused great buddha abides. Essence body not cease, not change. Secret method: unmoved, not move, not shaken. This is *dgongs pa 'tus pa* (gathered intention)—essence-nature-compassion as non-dual ground.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SYNTHESIS]
[BEYOND ESSENCE-NATURE DICHOTOMY]

<The unsurpassed basis integrates previous seven bases into triadic structure:
1. **Essence** (*ngo bo*): *ka dag* (primordially pure) = emptiness (*stong pa*)
2. **Nature** (*rang bzhin*): *lhun grub* (spontaneously present) = clarity (*gsal ba*)
3. **Compassion** (*thugs rje*): *rig pa* (awareness) = knowing (*rig pa*)

Lines 10843-10844: "one and, different and, separate not-is"—this is crucial. Essence/nature/compassion are:
- **One** (*gcig*): single ground (*gzhi*)
- **Different** (*tha dad*): distinct aspects (*cha*)
- **Not separate** (*so so ba min*): inseparable (*dbyer med*)

This transcends both monism (only one) and pluralism (only different). The "youth vase body" (*gzhon nu bum sku*) is *gzhi'i sku* (ground body)—not dharmakāya of fruit but ground's self-manifestation. "Primordial resonance" (*rang sgra*) is key concept: basis resonates as appearance without external cause. Risk: Reifying essence/nature/compassion as three separate entities. Actual meaning: three words for single ineffable ground. The citation emphasizes "unmoved" (*mi gyo*)—basis is not transformed by recognition or non-recognition. This is stability (*brtan pa*) of ground, different from permanence (*rtag pa*) of entities.>
