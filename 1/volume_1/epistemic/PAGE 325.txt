<Thirty-two channel petals: Each of the four wheels (*'khor lo*) generates eight channel petals (*rtsa'i 'dab ma*), totaling thirty-two throughout the body. These correspond to the thirty-two major channels (*rtsa sum cu rtsa gnyis*) and sixty-two subsidiary channels. The text systematically enumerates subtle body architecture—each channel carries specific winds, bindus, and consciousness configurations. This enumeration serves contemplative purposes: practitioner learns to visualize and direct energy through specific pathways. Dzogchen view reminder: These structures are recognition-devices, not ultimate realities. Recognition occurs when structure is seen through, not by perfecting structure.>
