[SEMDÉ, LONGDÉ, MENNGAKDÉ SUMMARY]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL SYNTHESIS]

<Three series (*sde gsum*) summary: Semdé (*sems sde*) emphasizes mind-essence (*sems nyid*) as directly accessible; Longdé (*klong sde*) emphasizes space/expanse (*klong*) as openness; Menngakdé (*man ngag sde*) emphasizes direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) through instructions. All three point to same *rig pa*, different entry points. Semdé for those needing stable ground; Longdé for those understanding openness; Menngakdé for those ready for direct pointing. The text synthesizes Longchenpa's mastery of all three—comprehensive Dzogchen presentation.>
