[PHASES AS RECOGNITION-MODES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Tantric phases from Dzogchen: not sequential stages but recognition-modes. Preliminaries are recognition's preparation; generation is recognition's visualization; completion is recognition's embodiment; great completion is recognition itself. All phases contain (*sdud*) complete recognition—each is *rig pa* from different perspective. The progression is pedagogical scaffolding, not actual development. From ground (*gzhi*) perspective, no progression—*ye nas rdzogs* (primordially perfect). From path (*lam*) perspective, apparent progression. From result (*'bras bu*) perspective, recognition of no progression.>
