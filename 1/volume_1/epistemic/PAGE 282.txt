Presents Gem Treasury's exposition of eight qualities arising through eight appear-make doors. Great compassion appears as self in four-birth beings; samsara-nirvana self-relates as quality in mixed-two-aspect mode. Body and shadow-like, five lights pervade Buddha-fields; inside appearance-aspect self-clear from five lights' appear-door. Without this, beings' own-light would be cut off apart. Through union appear-maker relating, self-appears as great quality. Three kayas abide as one, essence body's nature appears as five bodies, not distinguishing self-appear inside.
