[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS GEM CAVITY]
[THREE CAVITIES]

<Lines 11505-11510: "Primordial base in complete-end and, Base self ground two in base spontaneous gem cavity and, Complete-end result spontaneous gem secret cavity say, Spontaneous-of cavity three as explain, Base-as-appear in path spontaneous gem cavity say speak, Experience take time appear four-of primordial-wisdom and path-appear all this from arise is"—in primordial base completion; in base self ground two, base spontaneous gem cavity; say complete-end result spontaneous gem secret cavity; explain spontaneous cavity as three; speak, say in base-as-appear path spontaneous gem cavity; all this from arise is: experience-taking-time appear, four primordial wisdoms and path-appear. **Three spontaneous gem cavities** (*lhun grub rin po che'i sbubs gsum*):
1. **Base spontaneous gem cavity** (*gzhi lhun grub rin sbubs*)—ground as spontaneous presence
2. **Result spontaneous gem secret cavity** ('bras bu lhun grub gsang sbubs)—fruit as spontaneous presence  
3. **Path spontaneous gem cavity** (*lam lhun grub rin sbubs*)—path as spontaneous presence

All three are spontaneous presence—ground, path, and fruit not different in essence. Lines 11510: four primordial wisdoms and path-appearance all arise from this—referring to the four wisdoms of path practice.>

Not selective: *everything* is spontaneous presence. Great space (*klong chen*) of Buddha and beings—not separate spaces. This is *kun tu 'byung* (omni-arising)—basis accommodates all without discrimination.>
