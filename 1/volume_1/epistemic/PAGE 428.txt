[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Kāya's crucial point is through resound. Wisdom's posture is through those. These are methods for those practicing—how to align body and awareness. For one who has recognized, these are descriptions of natural state, not techniques to apply.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Bindu curved and stirred achieves. Light spreads and gathers. Related connection holds wind's crucial point. These are tantric techniques—working with subtle energy until recognition dawns. In Dzogchen, they are provisional; in Atiyoga, they are the play of awareness itself.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Entering's action distinguished by extremes. Transforming action wind exhausted. Delusion's prop and contrast joined. These describe the process of recognition—not sequential but simultaneous. When recognized, all extremes are exhausted, not gone elsewhere but seen as never having existed.>
