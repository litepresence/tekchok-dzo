[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[ULTIMATE TANTRA SYNTHESIS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Tantra classification ultimate view: fivefold or twofold division sufficient; superior capacity receives meaning and word tantras; supreme capacity transcending elaboration receives only ground tantra single awareness. The phrase *rig pa la rgyud thams cad tshang ba'i phyir* (because awareness contains all tantras) indicates Dzogchen view—*rig pa* is complete (*ye rdzogs*) with all qualities (*yon tan*). This is not hierarchy but capacity-appropriate presentation: tantras are recognition's descriptions, not external authorities.>
