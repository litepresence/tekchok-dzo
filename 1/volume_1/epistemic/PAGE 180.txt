<Transition to Dzogchen proper: All preceding tantric exposition is preparation (*sbyor ba*) for Dzogchen recognition. The text now shifts from tantric transformative view to Dzogchen intrinsic perfection view. Critical risk: Thinking tantra is merely preparation—as if incomplete. More accurate: tantra and Dzogchen are different modes of same recognition, appropriate to different capacities. Tantra is *thabs* (means)-oriented; Dzogchen is *shes rab* (wisdom)-oriented. Both are complete; Dzogchen is more direct. The text demonstrates Longchenpa's integration: tantra honored, Dzogchen supreme.>
