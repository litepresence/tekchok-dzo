<Wind-mind combustion: On the third day (*zhag gsum pa*), "wind-mind with causal conditions burned to particles" (*rlung sems rgyu rkyen dang bcas pa de rdul phra rab tsam du bsregs pa*) describes the energetic dissolution process in tantric *phowa* ('pho ba) or death yoga. The red fire pit (*me dmar po'i 'obs*) represents the fire element's consuming power. These are completion stage visualizations—practitioner imagines elemental dissolution to prepare for actual death. The text serves dual function: describing actual embryological development AND providing contemplative templates for conscious dying. Critical: These are practice instructions, not assertions about ontological processes.>
