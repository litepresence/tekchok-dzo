[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[TANTRA-DZOGCHEN SYNTHESIS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Synthesis of tantric framework and Dzogchen view: Tantra provides method (*thabs*) through empowerments, samayas, guru yoga; Dzogchen provides recognition (*rig pa*) as intrinsic perfection. The relationship is preparatory (*sbyor ba*) and culminative (*mthar thug*). Tantra prepares practitioner through transformation; Dzogchen culminates in recognition. However, the distinction is pedagogical, not ontological—both point to *chos nyid*. The text demonstrates Longchenpa's integrative hermeneutics: honoring tantric framework while asserting Dzogchen's definitive (*nges don*) status. This is Nyingma doxography—vehicles progressively reveal same nature.>
