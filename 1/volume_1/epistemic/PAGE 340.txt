<Five Lamps in channel knots: "From blood, flesh; from flesh, tendon" (*khrag las sha / sha las chu ba*) continues elemental refinement sequences. The "knot of Kyangma" (*rkyang ma'i mdud pa*) is where the Five Lamps (*sgron ma lnga*) manifest: far-reaching water lamp's seed (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma'i sa bon*) in the pupils; self-arisen wisdom lamp's support (*rang byung ye shes kyi sgron ma'i rten*) in the fire bindus; pure space lamp's support in the five-light bindus at the taste-aggregates; empty bindus lamp at the peak. These are direct perception (*pratyakṣa*) entry points—spontaneously present recognition-devices, not created through practice. They appear when clarity-emptiness is recognized.>
