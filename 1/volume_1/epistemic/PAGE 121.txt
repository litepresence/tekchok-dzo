[WORD TANTRA METAPHORICAL CLASSIFICATION]
[PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK]

<Extended word tantra classification through metaphorical designations (*mtshan*): snake-knot (*sbrul mdud*) as texts self-liberated, garuda (*khyung*) as view-tantra without effort/accomplishment, mirror (*me long*) as mind-mirror, river-current as empowerment/blessing continuum, king's unchanging lineage (*gdung*) as seat, treasure as wish-fulfilling, razor as cutting opponents. The *Nag mo khros ma* (Black Fierce One) protects teaching; other sixteen are from *Thal 'gyur* root. Citation from *Sgra thal 'gyur*: seventeen light-pure branches emerge from cause. These metaphors make tantric accessibility (*go bde*) through familiar images, not descriptive claims.>
