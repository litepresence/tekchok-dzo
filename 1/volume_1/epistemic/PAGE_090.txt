[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GROUND IN THE THREE SECTIONS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: SECTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents how the ground is understood in each of the three sections of Atiyoga—semde, longde, and mengagde—showing how each section offers a different perspective on the same primordially pure nature. From the Dzogchen perspective, these are not contradictory views but different doorways to the same recognition.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] as interpreted through each section's approach. Semde emphasizes the mind's nature as the ground—self-aware, luminous, and free from elaboration. Longde emphasizes the spacious expanse of the ground—the vast, open dimension that encompasses all. Mengagde transcends both in direct pointing to the ground beyond all concepts.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that all three sections describe the same ground from different angles. Semde's focus on mind prevents the error of nihilism; longde's focus on space prevents the error of eternalism; mengagde's direct pointing transcends both errors. Together they provide a complete view.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] operates in each section. Semde describes the ultimate nature of mind; longde describes the ultimate spaciousness; mengagde points to what cannot be described. All three are ultimately referring to the same inconceivable reality.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the unique emphasis of each section. Semde: the ground is the nature of mind, self-aware and luminous. Longde: the ground is primordial space, vast and all-encompassing. Mengagde: the ground is beyond all description, directly accessible through pith instructions.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how each section approaches the ground. Semde through analysis of mind's nature; longde through meditation on spaciousness; mengagde through direct introduction without analysis. All three lead to the same recognition but through different methods.

The section discusses the relationship between the three sections. They are not sequential stages but parallel approaches. A practitioner might connect more with one section than others based on disposition and capacity. Ultimately, all three converge in the same recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for all three sections, recognizing that each points to the definitive truth. The differences are in method and emphasis, not in the ultimate view.

The section thus shows how the three sections of Atiyoga provide complementary approaches to understanding the ground, accommodating different capacities while leading to the same recognition of primordial purity.
