[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VEHICLE HIERARCHY RATIONALE]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PEDAGOGICAL JUSTIFICATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]

This section presents the rationale for the hierarchical arrangement of the nine vehicles, explaining why Buddha taught progressively more subtle approaches rather than giving the highest teaching immediately. From the Dzogchen perspective, this progressive disclosure reflects both the Buddha's compassionate skillful means and the nature of the path itself—beings must be prepared gradually for direct recognition.

The epistemic framework here employs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] as the rationale for gradual teaching. Just as a doctor prescribes different medicines for different conditions, the Buddha taught different vehicles for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong but appropriate for those who need them, preparing the ground for higher teachings.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that while the nine vehicles are taught sequentially, from the perspective of primordial purity no progression actually occurs. The ground is never deluded, the path is never traversed, the result is never achieved—all are conceptual impositions on the natural state. Yet conventionally, the progressive approach is necessary because beings are caught in progressively subtle levels of delusion.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is crucial here. Ultimately, there are no vehicles, no progression, no attainment. Conventionally, the nine vehicles provide a necessary framework for those who need gradual training. The progressive disclosure respects both truths without conflating them.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle that the Buddha taught according to the capacities of disciples. The Sravaka teachings were given to those who could only understand impermanence and no-self. The Mahayana teachings were given to those ready for emptiness and bodhicitta. The Vajrayana teachings were given to those capable of recognizing primordial purity. Each teaching is perfect for its intended audience.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component is implicit in the progression itself—the practices of each vehicle prepare the practitioner for the next. Sravaka practice purifies gross attachment; Mahayana practice cultivates wisdom and compassion; Vajrayana practice reveals the natural state. This preparation is both psychological (purifying obscurations) and philosophical (refining view).

The section discusses the risk of confusing the vehicles or abandoning lower practices prematurely. The Dzogchen view is not nihilism—recognizing emptiness does not mean abandoning ethics or meditation. The practitioner must maintain the foundation of lower vehicles even while recognizing their ultimate nature.

The epistemic stance maintains that the vehicle hierarchy is pedagogical, not ontological. All beings have Buddha-nature equally; the vehicles simply provide different methods for recognizing this nature. Atiyoga is "highest" only in being most direct, not in creating a different or better result.

The section thus justifies the nine vehicles as skillful means, establishing that while Dzogchen represents the most direct approach, all vehicles are valid and necessary for beings of different capacities.
