[DZOGCHEN VIEW – INNER TANTRAS CLASSIFICATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: INNER TANTRA HIERARCHY]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the detailed classification of the three inner tantras—Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga—analyzing their progressive approach to the definitive view. From the Dzogchen perspective, the inner tantras represent the culmination of Buddhist teaching, offering increasingly direct methods for recognizing the natural state. Unlike the outer tantras' emphasis on ritual and generation stage, the inner tantras focus on completion stage practices and direct recognition.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] as the guiding principle. The inner tantras all share the fundamental view of primordial purity (ka dag)—the recognition that enlightenment is already present and that practice reveals rather than creates this presence. This view is definitive, pointing directly to the nature of reality without the intermediaries of conceptual frameworks.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the inner tantras as valid approaches that progressively approximate the direct recognition of Atiyoga. Mahayoga's elaborate generation stage transforms perception through mandala visualization. Anuyoga's perfection stage works directly with subtle body energies. Atiyoga transcends both in direct introduction to rig pa.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in inner tantras is the recognition that all phenomena are the display of awareness. Conventionally, the practices appear as methods to achieve enlightenment; ultimately, they are expressions of enlightenment itself. The generation stage, completion stage, and Great Perfection are different doorways to the same recognition.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the progressive refinement: Mahayoga views all phenomena as the mandala of the deity; Anuyoga views the subtle body as the expression of primordial wisdom; Atiyoga views all phenomena as the spontaneous display of rig pa. This progression demonstrates increasing directness in recognizing the natural state.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the distinctive practices of each inner tantra. Mahayoga emphasizes the generation stage's transformation of perception through deity yoga and mandala visualization. Anuyoga emphasizes the perfection stage's manipulation of channels, energies, and essences. Atiyoga emphasizes direct introduction, cutting through, and spontaneous presence.

The section discusses the classification systems for inner tantras. The Nyingma tradition recognizes Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga as the three inner tantras, with Atiyoga further divided into semde, longde, and mengagde. This classification reflects the progressive dissolution of conceptual frameworks leading to direct recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the inner tantras' view while recognizing varying degrees of directness in their methods. The view is definitive—all phenomena are primordially pure. The methods range from elaborate (Mahayoga) to direct (Atiyoga), accommodating different capacities.

The section thus presents the inner tantras as the definitive approach to Buddhist practice, offering progressively direct methods for recognizing the natural state. The progression from Mahayoga through Anuyoga to Atiyoga represents the path from structured practice to direct recognition.
