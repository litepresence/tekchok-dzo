[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[ACTIVITY AND ENLIGHTENED FUNCTION]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Enlightened activity (*'phrin las*) in tantra: transformation complete, activity spontaneously arises for benefit of beings. This is result-function—natural (*ran gzhin*) expression of realized state. Activity is not deliberate but spontaneous (*lhun grub*). Three types: peace (*zhi ba*), increase (*rgyas pa*), power (*dbang*), wrath (*drag po*). These are skillful means for different situations. In Dzogchen, activity is *rig pa*'s self-radiance (*rang gdangs*)—natural expression without agent. Same activity, different framing: tantra as function of result, Dzogchen as display of ground.>
