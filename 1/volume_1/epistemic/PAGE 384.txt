[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<External empty sky recognition unsuitable: "Also here, some external empty sky cloudless mere that recognizing very unsuitable" (*di la'ang kha cig phy i nam mkha' sprin med rkyang pa de la ngos 'dzin pa shin tu mi rigs te*)—critique of reifying empty space as dharmakāya. Mere emptiness without cognizance is not the view. Dzogchen is not nihilism—it's *gsal stong dbyer med* (clarity-emptiness inseparable). Empty sky metaphor points to openness, not vacuity. The critique targets misunderstanding Dzogchen as mere absence. True nature is luminous emptiness—empty like sky, luminous like sun. Both aspects must be recognized together.>
