Details the eight spontaneous presence arising-manners (*lhun grub 'char tshul brgyad*) as doors not ceasing: extreme-free appearing, pure wisdom-door, impure samsara-door, and so on. Base-appearance (*gzhi snang*) is like reflections in a mirror—self-appearing, not appearing to others, unrecognized by self, like dream-appearance flickering instantaneously. The ground doesn't change (*gzhi mi 'gyur*) while nature appears without ceasing, and from compassion's indeterminacy (*ma nges pa*), non-awareness self-arises. This explains samsara's arising from primordial purity without impugning the ground's changelessness.
