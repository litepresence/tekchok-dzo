[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL MEDITATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: NON-MEDITATION PRACTICE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents natural meditation (gnas lugs) or non-meditation (sgom med) as the essence of Dzogchen practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, true meditation is not an activity performed by a practitioner but the natural state remaining in its own place without distraction.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding natural meditation. Unlike technique-based meditation that involves effort and fabrication, natural meditation is effortless (rtsol med) and unfabricated (ma bcos). It is the recognition that awareness naturally remains as it is without needing to be maintained.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that meditation is not something one does but something one is. The natural state is always meditating—it is self-aware, self-luminous, and unchanging. "Practicing" meditation means simply not distracting from this natural state.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in natural meditation is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of meditation sessions and post-meditation, ultimately there is no separation. All activity is meditation when recognition is continuous.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: meditation is the continuous flow (rgyun chags) of recognition. Whether thoughts arise or not, whether emotions manifest or not, the recognition of their nature as awareness continues without interruption.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to rest in natural meditation. Do not focus on an object, do not block thoughts, do not create a meditative state. Simply rest in the natural state as it is, allowing all phenomena to arise and liberate themselves.

The section discusses the relationship between natural meditation and technique-based meditation. While beginners may need techniques to settle the mind, Dzogchen emphasizes transcending technique to rest in the natural state. Techniques are fingers pointing; natural meditation is the moon.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for natural meditation, recognizing it as the definitive practice. All techniques are provisional means; the natural state is the definitive reality.

The section thus establishes natural meditation as the heart of Dzogchen practice—not an achievement through effort but the recognition of what has always been present, naturally and effortlessly.
