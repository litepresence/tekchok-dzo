[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[SANSKRIT ALPHABET INTRODUCTION]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Transition to Sanskrit alphabet (*dbu yig*) exposition—the "variegated letter" section. Sixfold explanation from *Rig pa rang grol*: letter essential point, stack meaning, sound meaning, Sanskrit meaning, dependence meaning, combination meaning. This is tantric framework for understanding *sngags* (mantra) science—letters (*yi ge*) as gateways to realization. The tantric view: letters are not merely symbolic but sound-reality (*sgra don*), vibrational patterns of dharmatā. This bridges to Dzogchen's spontaneous sound (*rang sgra*) but within tantric upāya framework.>
