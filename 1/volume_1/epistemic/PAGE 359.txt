<Water clarity and blood: "Third from water's clarity blood" (*gsum nas chu yi dangs ma khrag*) continues elemental refinement—water element's subtle essence (*dangs ma*) manifests as blood at the relative level. This is the descending scale: space → wind → fire → water → earth, each densifying into the next. The practitioner learns to reverse this through completion stage dissolution: earth → water → fire → wind → space, arriving at clear light nature of mind. This is the "six yogas" completion stage framework: progressively subtler states leading to recognition. The practices are systematic preparation for death and rebirth navigation.>
