[TEXTUAL COMPLETION]

<The final reconvergence statistics complete the corpus organization: obstacles (*gags*) 1,500, essential points (*gnad*) 87 (*gzer bu*), threefold spheres (*'phyong*) of essential-point gathering/seeing/knowing. The classification into teaching (*bka'*) and treatise (*bstan bcos*), then treatise into tantra/scripture/instruction, demonstrates Nyingma textual hierarchy. The fourfold *la bzla ba* (recitation/penetration) categories—meaning instruction, abiding-mode nature, philosophical words, samsara/nirvana nondual—provide progressive access points to same recognition.>

[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Chapter transition: "Thus having established the general dharma arrangement, now explaining the unsurpassed vehicle particularly." This marks shift from Dzogchen doxography to tantric framework. The definition of tantra (*rgyud*) as "awareness and that which establishes it definitively, great secret adding/subtracting impossible, direct certainty" introduces tantric terminology. The etymology (*nges tshig*) as "continuous (*rgyud*) because showing family/lineage (*rigs*), producing birth in that family" indicates *rgyud* (tantra) as transformative continuity, not merely textual genre.>
