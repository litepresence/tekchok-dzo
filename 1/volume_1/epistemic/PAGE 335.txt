<Mother's conditions and three syllables: "Mother's condition also with three syllables' sound" (*ma'i rkyen yang 'bru gsum gyi sgra dang bcas te*) completes the description of symmetrical subtle body processes. The three syllables (A, OṀ, HUṀ or variations) represent the feminine principle's energetic signature. "Then greatly increasing" (*de nas cher 'phel*) marks gestational progression—embryonic development accelerating. This detailed embryology serves tantric practice: understanding how form develops allows conscious reversal at death. The symmetry between mother/father, feminine/masculine principles reflects tantric non-dual view underlying apparent duality.>
