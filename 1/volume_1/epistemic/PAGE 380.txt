[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Six Yogas completion and transition: "Fifty incomplete, two years" (*lnga bcu ma tshang na lo gnyis*) completes temporal calculations. "Thus spoken" (*zhes gsungs te*) marks conclusion of Six Yogas completion stage section (*rdzogs rim gyi chos drug*). The text has systematically covered: (1) individual withdrawal, (2) concentration, (3) life-force control, (4) retention, (5) recollection, (6) samādhi. These are graduated tantric methods preparing for recognition. Now the text transitions toward fruition—what results from practice. Critical navigation: Practice doesn't produce enlightenment; it removes obstacles to recognizing what's always present. Next section: Fruition and enlightened activity (*'bras bu dang 'phrin las*).>
