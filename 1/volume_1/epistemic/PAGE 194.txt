[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[CHAPTER SYNTHESIS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Chapter synthesis: Pages 101-194 covered Dzogchen textual taxonomy (nine spaces, three series), tantra definitions and classifications, Sanskrit alphabet and mantra science, four empowerments and samayas, guru yoga as path—all within tantric framework with Dzogchen culmination. The exposition honored tantric methods while pointing to their transcendence in recognition. This is masterful hermeneutics—maintaining tradition's integrity while asserting definitive view. Longchenpa's Treasury demonstrates how Dzogchen integrates and transcends all preceding vehicles.>
