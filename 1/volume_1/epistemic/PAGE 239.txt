Presents liberation (*rnam grol*) clairvoyances exhausting outflows (*zag pa zad pa*) of body, speech, mind, and aggregates through thirty empowerments, followed by activity-manifestation and reality-view clairvoyances totaling one hundred eighty. The exhaustive enumeration serves tantric gradualism while Dzogchen recognizes all qualities as spontaneously present. The exhaustion of outflows expresses the self-liberation (*rang grol*) of afflictions when their nature is recognized, not their gradual elimination through effort. The text's structure demonstrates how tantric paths approach what Dzogchen reveals directly.
