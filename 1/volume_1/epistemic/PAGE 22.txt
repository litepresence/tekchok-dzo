[RISK: SPATIAL REIFICATION]

<The sevenfold wind evolution (*rlung bdun gyi 'byung tshul*) with precise dimensional measurements (108,000 leagues depth, 160,000 leagues width) follows Abhidharmic cosmological model. The vajra-cross (*rdo rje rgya gram*) formation with YAM seed-syllable and four wind-goddesses operates within conventional *cakravāla* framework. Risk: Literalizing cosmic measurements as physical astronomy rather than recognition-mandala architecture.>

<The elemental condensation sequence—golden clouds (*gser gyi snying po can gyi sprin*) → seven-year rain → clear motionless water (*dangs shing mi g.yo rnyog pa med pa'i chu*) → golden earth formation—presents standard Buddhist cosmogony from *Aggañña Sutta* sources. The intermediate aeon (*bar gyi bskal pa*) intervals establish conventional temporal framework for world-system cycling.>
