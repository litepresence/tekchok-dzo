[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NO GRADATION IN RECOGNITION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: NON-HIERARCHICAL REALIZATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the Dzogchen view that recognition admits of no gradation—there are not degrees of enlightenment, stages of realization, or levels of recognition. From the Dzogchen perspective, recognition is either present or absent; there are no partial recognitions.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding non-gradation. Unlike gradual paths that describe progressive stages of realization, Dzogchen recognizes that the nature of mind is either recognized or not. The recognition itself is complete; what varies is its stability.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that while we may speak of deepening recognition or stabilizing it, the recognition itself is the same—awareness aware of itself. There are not different recognitions but different durations of the same recognition.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in gradation is the recognition that while conventionally we describe paths and stages, ultimately there is only recognition and non-recognition. The stages are descriptions of how recognition manifests, not different recognitions.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: enlightenment is not achieved in stages but recognized all at once. The ten stages (sa bcu) of the Bodhisattva path are conventional descriptions, not actual stages of realization.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to approach this non-gradation. Rather than working toward future realization, recognize fully in this moment. The recognition that occurs now is as complete as any recognition could be.

The section discusses the relationship between this view and conventional gradualism. While gradual paths are valid for those who need them, Dzogchen emphasizes immediate, complete recognition. This is not superiority but difference in approach.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for non-gradation, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings describe stages, the ultimate recognition is immediate and complete.

The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of recognition as admitting no gradation—either awareness recognizes itself or it does not; there are no degrees of enlightenment, only recognition or delusion.
