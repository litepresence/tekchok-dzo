[VASE EMPOWERMENT DETAILED]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Vase empowerment detailed exposition: purification of body (*lus*) and entry into maṇḍala (*dkyil 'khor*) as deity-body. The five sense empowerments (*dbang lnga*) within vase empowerment correspond to five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*). Practitioner visualizes self as deity (*lha*)—this is tantric *sgyu lus* (illusory body) technology, not delusion. Through vase empowerment, ordinary body-appearance transforms (*sgyur*) into wisdom-body. This is *bskyed rim* (development stage) foundation—fabricated transformation leading to recognition of unfabricated nature.>
