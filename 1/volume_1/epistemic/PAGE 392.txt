<Inner space self-place pure: "Inner space self-place pure" (*nang dbyings rang sar dag*)—dharmadhātu is naturally pure where it is, not purified by effort. "Appearance" (*snang*) continues description of self-liberated perception. This is *kadag* (primordial purity)—not result of practice but recognition of always-present nature. The text oscillates between analyzing delusion's emptiness and declaring space's purity. This dual approach serves different students: analytical types need reasoning; direct types need pointing-out. Both arrive at same recognition: appearances are self-liberated (*rang grol*)—free without being freed.>
