<This characteristic like this: "This characteristic like this" (*di yi mtshan nyid di lta bu*)—direct pointing to awareness's nature. "Awareness thought-free's body vajra chains and light round bindu stacked five nine appearing" (*rig pa rtog med kyi sku rdo rje lu gu rgyud dang 'od zlum gyi thig le brtsegs ma lnga dgu 'char*) describes subtle appearances in meditation—vajra chains (*rdo rje lu gu rgyud*) and stacked bindus. These are *nyams* (experiences), not *rtogs pa* (realization). "Having Four Lamps' aspect" (*sgron ma bzhi'i cha yod pa*) confirms these appearances indicate correct practice. But experiences themselves are not the point—recognizing their nature is. Risk: Reifying meditative experiences as attainment.>
