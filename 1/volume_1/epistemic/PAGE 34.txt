[RISK: TEMPORAL REIFICATION]

<The degeneration narrative continuation—self-light radiance decline, food evolution (fat → honey → ground-rice → farming), lifespan reduction—presents standard Buddhist eschatology. Operating within *Aggañña Sutta* temporal framework of karmic maturation. Risk: Reading this as historical anthropology rather than recognition of adventitious obscuration (*glo bur gyi sgrib pa*) patterns.>

<The origin of sexual differentiation from desire-thought (*'dod sems*) and gradual physical coarsening presents conventional Buddhist anthropology. The womb-birth transition from radiant form bodies (*'od kyi lus*) operates within causal vehicle gradualist framework.>
