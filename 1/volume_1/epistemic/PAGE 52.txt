[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The five aggregates (*phung po lnga*) analysis—conceptual aggregates (*rtog pa dang bcas pa'i phung po*) and non-conceptual aggregates (*rtog pa med pa'i phung po*)—presents standard Abhidharma framework. The contaminated (*zag bcas*) worldly aggregates for ordinary beings establish conventional phenomenology. Risk: Confusing aggregate analysis with Dzogchen recognition of awareness-nature beyond aggregation.>
