[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section introduces the classification of the nine vehicles (theg pa dgu), a systematic presentation that organizes Buddhist teachings according to their philosophical sophistication and meditative approach. From the Dzogchen perspective, this nine-fold classification represents a [PROVISIONAL MEANING] structure designed to accommodate practitioners of varying capacities. The three outer vehicles (phyi yi theg pa gsum)—Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva vehicles—are presented as the foundation upon which the inner vehicles are established.

The epistemic stratification here employs [DZOGCHEN VIEW] vs [PROVISIONAL VIEW], where the nine vehicles are taught as [PROVISIONAL VIEW] to guide beings progressively. The Sravaka vehicle emphasizes the four noble truths and the twelve links of dependent origination, presenting a view of radical impermanence and no-self that serves as a necessary foundation. The Pratyekabuddha vehicle adds deeper insight into dependent origination and the empty nature of phenomena. The Bodhisattva vehicle introduces the altruistic motivation of bodhicitta and the six perfections.

From the definitive Dzogchen standpoint, these vehicles are not ultimately distinct paths leading to different results but rather skillful means (thabs) that all converge in the recognition of rig pa. The text implicitly maintains [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH], acknowledging that while these vehicles are conventionally taught as separate paths, ultimately all phenomena are primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously present (lhun grub).

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] is primary here as the text categorizes and defines the philosophical positions of each vehicle. However, [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] is also present in how practitioners of each vehicle engage their respective paths. The section reflects the Dzogchen hermeneutic principle that the Buddha taught different vehicles according to the capacities of beings, with Atiyoga representing the culmination that transcends yet includes all previous vehicles.

The epistemic stance acknowledges that while the nine vehicles are presented systematically, from the perspective of primordial purity (gdod ma'i grol ba), no vehicles exist—there is only the self-recognition of awareness beyond all categorization. The classification serves as a pedagogical tool, organizing teachings from the coarse to the subtle, from the provisional to the definitive, guiding practitioners toward the direct recognition of the natural state (gnas lugs).
