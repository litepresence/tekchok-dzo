[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MEDITATION AS CONTINUOUS FLOW]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents meditation (sgom pa) as the second aspect of the Dzogchen path—the continuous flow of recognition without distraction. From the Dzogchen perspective, meditation is not a technique to achieve a result but the natural state remaining in its own place without wandering.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding meditation. Unlike causal vehicles that meditate on objects or antidotes, Dzogchen meditation is non-meditation (sgom med)—the recognition that there is nothing to meditate on and no one to meditate. The natural state is always present; meditation is simply not distracting from it.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes meditation as the continuity (rgyun) of recognition. Whether thoughts arise or not, whether emotions manifest or not, the recognition of their nature as primordial purity continues without interruption. This is the "continuous flow" (rgyun chags) of Dzogchen meditation.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in meditation is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of meditation sessions, progress, and stabilization, ultimately there is no meditation—only the natural state remaining in its own place.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the two main approaches to Dzogchen meditation: trekcho (khregs chod), which cuts through conceptual mind to rest in primordial purity; and thodgal (thod rgal), which allows spontaneous presence to manifest without blocking or following. Both are approaches to the same recognition.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes specific meditation techniques. Trekcho involves releasing all grasping and resting in the natural state. Thodgal involves allowing visions and experiences to arise without fixation, recognizing them as the display of awareness. Both require the foundation of recognition established through direct introduction.

The section discusses the relationship between meditation and non-meditation. In Dzogchen, the highest meditation is non-meditation—not the absence of practice but the recognition that practice and non-practice are equally the natural state. Even distraction, when recognized, is meditation.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for Dzogchen meditation, recognizing it as the definitive approach that transcends technique. While methods are used, they are fingers pointing to the moon of non-meditation.

The section thus establishes meditation as the continuous flow of recognition, distinguishing Dzogchen's approach from technique-based meditation while acknowledging the value of methods for those who need them.
