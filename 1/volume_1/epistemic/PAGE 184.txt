[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[RIGPA AS RECOGNITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<*Rig pa* (awareness/recognition): knowledge that knows itself, awareness aware of itself. Not cognition (*shes pa*) of object, but self-cognizing (*rang rig*) luminosity. *Rig pa* is basis (*gzhi*) knowing itself—simultaneously empty (*stong pa*) and luminous (*gsal ba*). The path is *rig pa* recognizing itself; the result is *rig pa* exhausted of confusion. No transformation, no development—only recognition. This is Dzogchen's unique contribution: direct pointing to awareness-nature, bypassing all method.>
