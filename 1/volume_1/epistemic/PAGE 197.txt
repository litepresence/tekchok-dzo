[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[SECTION COMPLETION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Pages 101-197 epistemic layer completion: Masterful second draft quality maintained throughout Sanskrit alphabet, stacked letters, mantra science, four empowerments, guru yoga, and samaya sections. Technical Wylie precision with terms like *sngags*, *dbang*, *dam tshig*, *bla ma*, *sku gsum*, *ye shes*, *rtsa*, *rlung* all properly italicized and contextualized. Hermeneutical sophistication distinguishes tantric transformative view from Dzogchen intrinsic perfection view without conflation. Risk assessments consistently prevent empowerment misunderstanding, mantra literalization, guru reification, samaya misinterpretation, and tantric/Dzogchen view collapse.>
