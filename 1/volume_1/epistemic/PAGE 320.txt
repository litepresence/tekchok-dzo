<Channels, winds, and seed syllables: "Wind channels jumping and moving inside, YAṀ moving and flowing" (*rlung gi rtsa 'phar zhing 'gyu ba'i nang du yaM 'gyu zhing rgyu pa*) introduces the core completion stage framework: channels (*rtsa*), winds (*rlung*), and seed syllables (*sa bon yi ge*). YAṀ, YE, AUM are not mere sounds but energetic signatures—vibrational patterns that structure consciousness. The "four earth channels" (*sa'i rtsa bzhi*) and corresponding wisdoms indicate how tantra maps enlightenment onto physiological process. Five Buddha families (*rigs lnga*) adorn the aggregates (*phung po lnga*) at the level of particles (*rdul phra rab*). This is tantric phenomenology—describing experience through energetic and symbolic coordinates. Risk: Confusing energetic map with anatomical territory.>
