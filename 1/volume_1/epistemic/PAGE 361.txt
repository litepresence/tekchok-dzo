<Five goddesses and jumping channels: "Five goddesses" (*lha mo lnga*) refer to the five pranas (*srog rlung*) or five wisdom energies. "Jumping channels are eleven" (*'phar ba'i rtsa ni bcu gcig go*) describes channels where winds leap or intensify. This is *srog rtsol* (life-force control) yoga—working with vital energies through specific channel networks. The practitioner learns to identify these jumping points and either calm or activate them as needed. These are advanced techniques requiring precise knowledge; incorrect practice can cause energetic disturbance. The eleven channels correlate with specific bodily functions and consciousness states.>
