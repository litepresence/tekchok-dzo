<From that itself continuation: "Also from that itself" (*yang de nyid las*) continues detailed channel exposition. "One spreading trunk" (*rnam par 'khyil ba'i sdong po gcig*) describes central channel as tree trunk with spreading branches. This organic metaphor pervades subtle body literature—channels as tree, channels as river system, channels as architecture. Each metaphor highlights different aspect: tree emphasizes growth and vitality; rivers emphasize flow; architecture emphasizes structure. The practitioner uses whichever resonates. The text's exhaustive enumeration serves to exhaust conceptual grasping—when mind is overwhelmed by detail, it may finally relax into direct recognition.>
