[BRAHMA REALM HIERARCHY]

<Form realm (*gzugs khams*) Brahma classification. Lines 1246-1247: "brahma before recite, those before at speech recite do one exist by-means-of that sound called"—Brahma Purohita (*tshangs pa mdun na 'don*, Brahma Before Recitation) has beings who recite before him; named for this service. Lines 1248-1250: "body measure one life also interval eon one to last, that below at jewel sikata called sky to above from cut by-means-of brahma called, that also virtue action to brahma-like dwell by-means-of that sound called"—Great Brahma (*tshangs pa chen po*): body one measure, life one intermediate eon (*bar bskal*). Below jewel Sikata (*si ka ta*) sky, "cut from above" (*gong ma las chad*)—derivation of "Brahma" name. "Virtue action to brahma-like dwell"—dwelling in virtue like Brahma. Line 1251: "body measure half life also interval eon half last"—limited Brahma (*tshangs pa chung ba*): body half measure, life half intermediate eon. Brahma realms established by meditative stability (*bsam gtan*) and virtue; not permanent salvation but superior samsara.>

[SIX DESIRE HEAVENS DETAILED]

<Transition to desire realm (*'dod khams*): "then desire realm to two from, god race six first is"—lines 1252-1253. Lines 1254-1258: **Paranirmitavaśavartin** (*gzhan 'phrul dbang byed*, Controlling Others' Emanations): wish-fulfilling tree jewel greatly expanded sky. Fall from previous excellence, other emanation power do. Body/league half and two (2.5), life 1,600 human years = 1 day, 16,000 own years. Lines 1259-1263: **Nirmāṇarati** (*'phrul dga',* Emanation Joy): below wish-fulfilling tree See Beautiful (*mig mdzes*) sky. Fall from above, emanation joy. Body light from sons hundred/thousand/measureless emanation play joy. Body league one and four parts (1.25), life 800 human years = 1 day, 8,000 own years. Lines 1264-1268: **Tuṣita** (*dga' ldan*, Joy Possessors): below wish-fulfilling tree Eye Beautiful (*mig mdzes*) sky. Fall from Emanation Joy, expand Joy Possess. Supreme joy/bliss dharma dwell. Body league one (1), bow-length 500. Life 400 human years = 1 day, 4,000 own years. Below wish-fulfilling tree Mind Change (*yid 'gyur*). Cosmological hierarchy: form realm (virtue/meditation) above desire realm (pleasure/merit).>

[RISK: PERMANENCE DELUSION]

<The Brahma realm's "intermediate eon" (*bar bskal*) lifespan presents unique soteriological danger: beings mistake long duration for permanence (*rtag pa*). Lines 1250 "brahma-like dwell"—dwelling LIKE Brahma, not BECOMING Brahma. This is still *'khor ba* (samsara), not liberation. The Great Brahma believes he is creator (*skyed byed*)—delusion of cosmic self-importance. Desire heavens' progressive degradation (16,000 → 8,000 → 4,000 years) encodes merit exhaustion: higher realms = more merit = longer life, but all finite. The pattern: fall from previous excellence (*sngon gyi yon tan*)—cyclical rise and fall, not linear progress. Dzogchen view: All realms equally *snang ba* (appearance), equally *stong pa* (empty). The elaborate cosmology is *tha snyad* (conventional) upaya to motivate virtue, not *don dam* (ultimate) description of reality. Risk: Attachment to Brahma-rebirth as goal; actual goal is recognition beyond all realms.>
