[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CLOUD-SKY METAPHOR]
[ADVENTITIOUS ARISING]

<Lines 11392-11396: "for-example sky-to cloud truly exist not cloud adventitious arise and like, base path awareness exist truly not, compassion like arise cause non-recognition arise, base spontaneous-accomplishment-of state called attach, that also not-determined appearance great one-as dwell"—for example: clouds in sky do not truly exist, clouds arise adventitiously (*glo bur*) and like this; base, path, awareness do not truly exist; compassion arises like [clouds], cause is non-recognition arising; base called spontaneous accomplishment state; that also not-determined appearance great dwelling as one. **Crucial metaphor**: Clouds are adventitious to sky—they appear, move, dissolve, but sky remains unchanged. Similarly: samsara (*non-recognition*) is adventitious to basis (*spontaneous accomplishment state*). Basis, path, awareness do not truly exist (*bden par med*)—they are like clouds. Yet they appear (*snang*). This is *snang stong gnyis med*—appearance and emptiness non-dual. Not-determined (*ma nges*) appearance great dwelling as one: basis accommodates all without determining any.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EIGHT ASPECTS OF SPONTANEOUS ACCOMPLISHMENT]
[JEWEL CASKET STATE]

<Lines 11397-11421: Eight aspects of spontaneous accomplishment state (*lhun grub kyi gnas lugs*):

1. "jewel casket-of state called, desire-objects-of door not cease"—jewel casket state, desire objects' door not ceasing
2. "not establish-of establish great-as dwell"—non-established establishment great dwelling
3. "compassion like arise-of door not cease"—compassion-like arising door not ceasing  
4. "primordial-wisdom like arise-of enjoyment not cease"—primordial wisdom-like arising enjoyment not ceasing
5. "form like arise-of essence not cease"—form-like arising essence not ceasing
6. "non-dual like arise-of view not determined"—non-dual like arising view not determined
7. "limit liberate like arise-of method not cease"—limit-liberating like arising method not ceasing
8. "pure primordial-wisdom-of gate thorough reach"—pure primordial wisdom gate thoroughly reached

Plus: "impure like arise-of compassion not cease"—impure like arising compassion not ceasing. These are eight doors (*sgo brgyad*) of spontaneous arising—clearing obstacles to understanding *lhun grub*. Lines 11408-11421: "desire-objects-of jewel jewel like, that-like my form-to attach, inner youth vase form called extent open, outer spontaneous-accomplishment-of state-as dwell, time that only my appearance outer spread, clear not clear not, shattered not shattered not, scattered not scattered not, distracted not distracted not, move, flicker, variety-as spread happen, then spontaneous-accomplishment-of state great attach"—desire objects like jewel; my form attached like that; inner youth vase form called extent open; outer spontaneous accomplishment state dwelling; time that only my appearance spreading outer; clear/not clear not; shattered/not shattered not; scattered/not scattered not; distracted/not distracted not; move, flicker, variety spreading happening; then great spontaneous accomplishment state attached. Paradoxical formulations: neither clear nor not clear, etc.—transcending dichotomies. This is *phyal ba* (wide open)—unobstructed spontaneity.>
