[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

Uses the metaphor of clouds adventitiously arising in sky—there is truly no awareness in base/path, yet ignorance arises from compassion-like appearance. The eight arising-ways (*'char lugs brgyad*) with desire-objects' door not ceasing establish great unestablished establishment. The primordial wisdom door not ceasing leads to complete enjoyment appearance. From "that only" time, appearance spreads outer: clear/not-clear, shattered/not-shattered, scattered/not-scattered, moving, flickering, spreading variously. This describes the spontaneous presence state (*lhun grub gnas lugs*) as temporal process, risking reification of appearing as sequential.
