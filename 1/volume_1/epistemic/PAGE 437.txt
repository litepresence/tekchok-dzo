<The five wisdoms and five elements are inseparable. Dharmadhātu wisdom is space, mirror-like is water, equality is earth, discriminating is fire, all-accomplishing is wind. Not that wisdoms are associated with elements, but that elements are wisdom's display, appearing as the five lights when recognized.>

<The five wisdoms and five buddha families (*rigs lnga*) correspond: Akṣobhya's vajra family with mirror-like, Ratnasambhava's jewel family with equality, Amitābha's lotus family with discriminating, Amoghasiddhi's karma family with all-accomplishing, Vairocana's buddha family with dharmadhātu. Not separate deities but aspects of single awareness.>

<These correspondences are not ontological claims but recognition frameworks. When one recognizes awareness's nature, the five wisdoms are naturally present without cultivating them. The frameworks support recognition; they are not separate realities to be believed.>
