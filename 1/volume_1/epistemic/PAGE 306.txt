<Symbolic architecture: "Jewel crystal house with eight doors" (*rin po che shel gyi khang pa cig sgo brgyad*) represents the eight consciousnesses (*rnam shes brgyad*) or the eightfold channel structure. The "mirror" (*me long*) that follows indicates the mirror-like wisdom (*me long lta bu'i ye shes*)—recognition that appearances are self-reflections of awareness. These symbolic structures serve as contemplative supports (*rten*) for recognizing that all experience arises from the basis (*gzhi*). The narrative form maintains pedagogical engagement while pointing to non-dual recognition.>
