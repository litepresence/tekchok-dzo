[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[BASE, PATH, AND FRUITION UNITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Base (*gzhi*), path (*lam*), and fruition (*'bras bu*) unity: base is primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*); path is recognition (*rig pa*) of base; fruition is recognition's completion—base fully recognized. No actual separation—path is base recognizing itself; fruition is base recognized. The triad is pedagogical scaffolding, not ontological structure. From definitive view, only *rig pa*—no base separate from path, no path separate from fruition. This is *ngo bo gcig* (single nature) presentation.>
