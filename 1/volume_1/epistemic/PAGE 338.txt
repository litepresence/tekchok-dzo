<Channel nature generally shown: "Channel nature generally shown" (*rtsa'i rang bzhin spyir bstan pa*) begins systematic exposition of the three main channels: central (*dbu ma*), right (*ro ma*), left (*rkyang ma*). *Kun'darma* (*kun 'dar ma*)—the central channel—is described as "quivering by wind's throwing and gathering" (*rlung gi 'phen sdud kyis 'dar ba*), indicating its dynamic, energetic nature. This is NOT anatomy—the channels don't appear on MRI scans. They are *pratyakṣa*—directly perceivable through subtle awareness when mind stabilizes. The trembling/vibration indicates wind-energy flowing through. Risk: Reducing subtle channels to nervous system or vascular structures.>
