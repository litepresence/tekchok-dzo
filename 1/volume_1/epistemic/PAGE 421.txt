[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Wisdom's essence: self-awareness knowing itself, abiding as omniscience from the beginning. Not developed through practice but recognized through recognition. From *De nyid las*: Wisdom called "abiding"—through understanding its characteristic, not dwelling in samsara-nirvāṇa two.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Wisdom's definition: knowing the meaning abiding from the beginning. From *Rang shar*: Primordially nature spontaneously perfected, from that realization manifest. Wisdom's definition is thus. Not a definition to memorize but the nature of awareness itself.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Divisions: ground-abiding wisdom, path-arising wisdom, fruition-completely perfect wisdom. Ground: wisdom already present. Path: wisdom recognized. Fruition: wisdom fully manifest. These are pedagogical distinctions, not different wisdoms. Single awareness described from three perspectives.>
