[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[VASE EMPOWERMENT - BUM DBANG]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<First empowerment: Vase empowerment (*bum dbang*) purifies body obscurations and authorizes deity yoga visualization. In tantra, this establishes practitioner as suitable vessel (*snod*) for subsequent practices. The vase (*bum pa*) symbolizes universe container; water symbolizes purification. Risk: Reifying vase as magical object rather than recognition-support. Critical distinction: Tantric vase empowerment plants seeds (*sa bon*) for eventual realization; Dzogchen vase pointing-out reveals intrinsic deity-nature. The text maintains tantric transformative framework while acknowledging Dzogchen culmination.>
