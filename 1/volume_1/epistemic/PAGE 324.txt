<Channel multiplication and chakra formation: During the four days (*zhag bzhi po*), elemental powers increase channels from four root channels (*rtsa bzhi*) to eight limb channels (*yan lag gi rtsa bzhi*). The text describes how "seven groups of seven" (*bdun tshan bdun*) generate samsaric existence (*srid pa*) and the four channel wheels (*rtsa'i 'khor lo bzhi*). This is intricate subtle body cartography—channels multiply like branches from a root. The tantric practitioner visualizes these structures to purify energetic blockages. Risk: Literalizing channel network as anatomical fact rather than energetic topology for contemplative work.>
