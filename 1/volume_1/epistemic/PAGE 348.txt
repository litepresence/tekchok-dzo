[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Dzogchen integration: "Sound words secret mantra self-sound" (*sgra tshigs gsang sngags kyi rang sgra*) shifts from tantric technique to Dzogchen recognition. The "self-sound" (*rang sgra*) indicates spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*)—sound arising without creation. This marks view transition: From deliberately working with channels and winds to recognizing sound's natural purity. "Earth, body, kidney flesh" (*sa lus gnyan sha*) continues elemental correlations while pointing to their empty nature. Declarative finality: All these structures—channels, winds, bindus—are recognition-devices. When recognition dawns, the devices are seen through, not perfected. Risk: Endless practice without recognition.>
