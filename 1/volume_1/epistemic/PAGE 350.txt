<Four chakras introduction: "Gathering makes form big but power weak, limbs fine" (*sdud pa las gzugs che yang stobs zhan yan lag phra*) continues wind-body correlations. This page introduces the four chakras (*'khor lo bzhi*): navel emanation wheel (*lte ba sprul pa'i 'khor lo*), heart dharma wheel (*snying ga chos kyi 'khor lo*), throat enjoyment wheel (*mgrin pa longs spyod kyi 'khor lo*), crown great bliss wheel (*spyi gtsug bde chen gyi 'khor lo*). Each wheel contains specific channel petals, winds, and bindus. The text explains "definite to four wheels" (*'khor lo bzhi ru nges pa*)—why four, not three or five. Correspondences: four elements, four wisdoms, four lamps, four bodies. This is tantric numerology—structural harmonies organizing practice.>
