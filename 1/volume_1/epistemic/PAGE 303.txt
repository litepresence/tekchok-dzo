<Sems-side explanation of how confusion perpetuates itself: "You yourself didn't escape when told to flee the army" (*khyod rang dmag drongs zer nas ma thar ro*) demonstrates self-deception—the mind (*sems*) fails to recognize its own nature even when pointed out. This passage illustrates the automaticity of habitual patterns (*bag la nyal*) and how recognition (*ngo shes*) must cut through at the precise moment of delusion's arising. The pedagogical structure mirrors the four stages of error: not seeing delusion as delusion, taking it as real, reacting emotionally, and solidifying the pattern.>
