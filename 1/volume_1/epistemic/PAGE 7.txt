[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

The quotations from the Father-Son Meeting Sutra and Flower Ornament Sutra function as scriptural support for the narrative of emanation. The assertion that the Buddha, even after obtaining enlightenment, shows himself as many Buddhas "for the purpose of ripening sentient beings" operates within the sutric framework of compassionate skillful means.

These citations serve an upaya function — using conventional scriptural authority to validate the tantric/Dzogchen narrative of Samantabhadra's emanation while operating from a different hermeneutical foundation.

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

The detailed narrative of Samantabhadra's emanation as Vajradhara, including specific prior lives, offerings, and awakening events, operates within tantric historiography. The claim that this occurred "immeasurable eons before this Good Eon" establishes tantric cosmological timeframes that dwarf sutric chronologies.

The description of spontaneous arising of mandalas, light-rays, and the "thirty-six tantras" represents tantric assertions about the self-arisen nature of the teaching. The assertion that Samantabhadra dwelt "for one great eon in Dharmakaya meaning" before manifesting the Sambhogakaya establishes tantric temporal structures.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

The reference to "light bindu" and the arising of "countless Buddha-bodies" from it marks a transition toward Dzogchen technical vocabulary. The bindu terminology begins to shift the discourse from tantric cosmology toward Dzogchen descriptions of awareness's own display.
