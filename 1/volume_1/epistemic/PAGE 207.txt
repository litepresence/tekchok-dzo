<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*sbyong byed* — purifying agent, *byang sems kundha* — bodhicitta kunda/jasmine water, *sku gsung thugs* — body speech mind, *rtog pa* — concept/thought, *las bag* — karma and latency, *tshe nyi ma zla ba* — life sun and moon)
- Hermeneutical precision: The *sbyong byed* (purifying agent) method of extending (*rgyas pa*) *byang sems* internally and externally produces signs of purification: karma/latency emptying, aging signs (white hair, wrinkles) ceasing, nine body stages forgotten, youthful flesh arising, diseases ending, lifespan equaling sun and moon. These are energetic biomarkers of *rlung* mastery, not magical rejuvenation.
- Temporal warnings: "Youthful flesh" (*gzhon nu'i sha*) and "prime arrived" (*dar la bab*) indicate energetic vitality, not literal age reversal. [RISK: TEMPORALIZATION] — Reading these as chronological anti-aging rather than energetic transformation.
- Ontological warnings: The body transformation is *lam gyi 'bras bu* (path result), not ultimate realization. To pursue bodily signs as goals contradicts Dzogchen's focus on *sems nyid* (mind itself) recognition.
- Pedagogical purpose: The signs (*rtags*) confirm energetic integration. However, the ultimate "sign" is recognition of *ka dag*—beyond all bodily transformation.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: REIFICATION] — Treating bodily signs as inherently significant rather than conventional indicators (*tha snyad kyi rtags*). [RISK: TEMPORALIZATION] — Believing that practice literally reverses aging rather than transforming energetic configuration.>

[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]
[RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*sku gsum rang lugs med* — three bodies self-nature not exist, *lta ba* — view, *sems la gnas* — abiding in mind, *bden pa* — conventional, *stong pa* — empty, *re dog* — hope/fear)
- Hermeneutical precision: The "measure" (*tshad*) of successful practice—three kāya self-nature not existing as view abiding in mind. This indicates transcendence of substantialist (*dngos po*) view of three bodies. The distinction between conventional (*bden pa*) and ultimate (*don dam*) samsara-root: conventional samsara persists if *byang sems* not extended and basis not emptied; ultimate samsara-root is empty from beginning (*gdod nas*), so no need to hope for buddhahood.
- Temporal warnings: The "three times one arise" (*dus gsum gcig tu skye*) is non-temporal integration.
- Ontological warnings: The text explicitly warns against reifying the three kāya as existent (*sku gsum rang lugs med*). To practice "obtaining" three kāya is *bden 'dzin* (true-grasping).
- Pedagogical purpose: The teaching subverts all substantialist fixation. The ultimate point: no need to hope for buddha (*sangs rgyas re dog med*) because *ka dag* is already perfected.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM] — Believing that extending *byang sems* literally purifies samsara. [RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION] — Thinking that bodhicitta expansion produces sequential realization rather than recognition of what's always present.>
