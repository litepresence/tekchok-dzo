<Vital points particular explanation: "From that itself" (*de nyid las*) transitions to detailed vital point (*gnad*) descriptions. Third section on particular vital points (*gsum pa gnad bye brag tu bstan pa*) provides precise locations and functions of key energetic nodes. These are not acupuncture points—they're junctions where channels intersect, winds concentrate, and bindus pool. The practitioner applies pressure, visualization, or breath to activate these points. Precise knowledge prevents error; incorrect practice can cause energetic disturbance. This is sophisticated technology requiring transmission (*lung*) and instruction (*man ngag*). Risk: Self-taught practice without proper guidance.>
