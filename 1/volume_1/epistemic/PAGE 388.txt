<Four Lamps recognition definite practice: "Body speech mind consciousness four always wandering samsara, Four Lamps exist recognize definite, practice, liberation's enlightenment obtained" (*lus ngag yid sems bzhi rtag tu 'khor ba 'khyams pa las sgron ma bzhi yod par ngo shes thag chod nyams su blangs pas thar pa'i byang chub thob pa*)—Dzogchen path summarized. The four ordinary aggregates (body, speech, mind, consciousness) perpetuate samsara when unrecognized. The Four Lamps are their enlightened nature—same essence, different recognition. Recognition is definite (*thag chod*)—beyond doubt. Practice (*nyams su blangs*) stabilizes recognition. Result (*thob pa*) is already present—obtaining what was never lost. This is *yené* (primordial) fruition, not *kyené* (produced).>
