[IMPURITY-PURITY REVERSION]

<Lines 10599-10601: "Also impurity pure-from also impure revert follows, base-to not-determined ground no cause, also samsara-nirvana mutually mix follows"—if impure samsara reverts to pure nirvana and basis is not determined, there is no ground or cause preventing reversion. Samsara and nirvana would mutually mix (*'dres*), losing distinction. Lines 10602-10603: "base not-determined cause anywhere change being cause, accept-if sentient beings effort without liberate"—if basis is undetermined and can change anywhere, sentient beings would liberate without effort. Line 10604: "Buddha impure revert cause suffering-to engage follows"—Buddhas could revert to impurity and engage with suffering. Lines 10605-10606: "base that mind-possessor-as follows not-determined thus one-only assert-as determined cause, those etcetera-of faults many exist"—asserting basis as both not-determined and one-only creates many faults. This is reductio ad absurdum: if basis lacks determinacy, all distinctions collapse.>

[NOT-DETERMINED BASIS REFUTED]

<Citation from Six Spaces Tantra (10607-10608): "not-determined of base said"—but this basis is "truly not-able" (*yang dag mi nus*). Lines 10609-10613: Samantabhadra questions: "I intelligence level this-like understand, effect alternation possess-or, or revert with become, not-determined determined become"—does effect possess alternation? Or does it revert? How can not-determined become determined? Lines 10614-10618: "own not-determined own exist cause, determined be-if action end like, this all knowable not, teacher said that-like"—if own not-determined exists as own cause, and determined is like ended action (past), then this is unknowable. The teacher speaks thus. This is *gnas lugs* (mode of being) critique: not-determined basis makes knowledge impossible.>

[ESSENCE-APPEARANCE DICHOTOMY]

<Lines 10620-10622: Third position refuted: "essence-to change not cause sky like, appearance change not-able fire and water like determined accept"—essence unchanging like sky, appearance unchangeable like fire-water (incompatible elements) determined. Lines 10623-10626: Refutation: "essence-to not appearance change not-able cause, base that-from samsara arise not valid, who also liberate not possible"—if essence does not change but appearance cannot change, samsara cannot arise from basis, and no one can liberate. Lines 10627-10630: "nirvana primordially exist-if eternalist permanent and difference not cause condition-from liberate accept cause contradict"—if nirvana primordially exists, eternalism follows; no difference means no liberation through conditions. "Fire hot just change not necessary like"—fire's heat doesn't need to change to be hot; likewise, if nirvana is essence, liberation needs no change. Lines 10631-10637: "mind-appearance-to necessary thus say-if, appearance change not-able cause contradict, samsara-of appearance being, base-of appearance not thus say-if, base that dual possess follow, base-from separate samsara-of appearance exist cause"—if mind-appearance is necessary but appearance cannot change, contradiction. If samsara-appearance is basis-appearance, dual possession follows. If samsara-appearance exists separate from basis, contradiction. Complete logical closure of all positions.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SYNTHESIS]
[BEYOND DICHOTOMIES]

<The extended refutation of three positions (spontaneous presence, not-determined, essence-appearance) serves to clear conceptual fixation. The actual Dzogchen view transcends all these dichotomies:
- Basis IS spontaneously present but not as inherent characteristic
- Basis IS not determined but this is freedom, not ignorance
- Essence IS unchanging but appearance IS changing—without contradiction

The key is *rtogs pa* (recognition), not logical position. All these refutations apply to *reified* views, not to actual basis. Lines 10637 "base that realize-if determined accept cause base-as not possible"—if basis is realized, accepting it as determined is impossible; basis transcends determination/non-determination. This is *nges 'byung* (definite emergence) from conceptual extremes. The refutation is medicine, not food—take it to cure fixation, then discard it. Risk: Endless logical proliferation, missing the pointing. The three pages of refutation (256-258) are exhaustive to satisfy intellectual doubt, but recognition occurs in immediacy beyond argument.>
