<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*bkod pa'i gnad* — arrangement crucial point, *gnas lugs* — abiding nature, *sems nyid* — mind itself, *chos sku* — dharma body, *longs sku* — enjoyment body, *sprul sku* — emanation body)
- Hermeneutical precision: Detailed posture specifications—tigress stance with "tight excrement door" (*bud med sbubs*), specific elbow angles (four finger-widths from ribs), gaze directed between eyebrows (*smin mtshams su bltas*). The "wisdom wind mandala" (*ye shes rlung gi dkyil 'khor*) at navel with specific visualization of red HRIH indicates internal energetic architecture. These are advanced *rdzogs rim* techniques for central channel activation.
- Temporal warnings: The visualization is sustained contemplation, not momentary imagination.
- Ontological warnings: The visualized mandala is *dmigs pa* (mental object), not ultimately real. To reify it contradicts Dzogchen's *stong pa* (emptiness) view.
- Pedagogical purpose: The technique provides structured approach to energetic transformation. However, the ultimate "mandala" is *chos nyid* (dharmatā) itself—no visualization required.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM] — Treating visualized mandala as real. [RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION] — Believing that specific angles and measurements mechanically produce realization.>

[RISK: EXPERIENTIAL ATTACHMENT]
[RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*bde ba'i tshad* — bliss measure/criterion, *dga' ba* — joy, *tshor ba* — sensation, *myong ba* — experience, *stong pa* — emptiness, *ye shes* — primordial wisdom, *rlung gi 'phen sdud* — wind projection-withdrawal)
- Hermeneutical precision: The four joys (*dga' ba*) and fivefold classification (joy, sensation, bliss, experience, emptiness) mapped to stages of practice: entering wisdom (*'jug pa'i ye shes*), experiencing object (*myong ba'i dngos*), disturbing mind/wisdom (*sems dang ye shes 'khrug pa*), inseparability of mind/wisdom (*sems dang ye shes gnyis dbyer mi byed pa*), and transcendence of extremes (*mtha' gnyis las ma 'das pa*). These constitute *lam gyi bde ba* (path bliss), not ultimate *chos nyid kyi bde ba* (dharmatā bliss).
- Temporal warnings: The five stages are descriptive taxonomy, not mandatory sequence.
- Ontological warnings: The progression from joy → sensation → bliss → experience → emptiness risks reifying emptiness as superior state. In Dzogchen, all are equally *ka dag* (primordially pure)—no hierarchy.
- Pedagogical purpose: The framework provides phenomenological markers for practice. However, the ultimate "measure" (*tshad*) is recognition that *bde stong* (bliss-emptiness) was never absent.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION] — Treating the five stages as necessary evolution rather than descriptive categories. [RISK: EXPERIENTIAL ATTACHMENT] — Becoming attached to specific bliss experiences as signs of progress.>
