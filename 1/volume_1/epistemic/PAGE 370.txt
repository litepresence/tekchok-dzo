<Humans self-luminous round: "Humans self-luminous round itself" (*mi rnams rang gsal zlum po nyid*)—human realm's lamp-appearance is round and self-luminous. This is the page referenced in existing epistemic entries (incorrectly placed). The six-realm summary describes how Five Lamps appear differently across realms: gods high, demigods hand, humans thumb, animals inner luminous, pretas subtle from, hells self-appearance complete. "Small tips inside two channels, element clarity flowing, channel blood clarity mixed"—technical description of how bindus flow in channels. Final integration: Tantric subtle body and Dzogchen recognition converge—channels, winds, bindus are all *rig pa'i rtsal* (awareness's dynamic play).>
