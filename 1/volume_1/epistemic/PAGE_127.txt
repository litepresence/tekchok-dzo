[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-LIBERATION PRINCIPLE]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: NATURAL FREEDOM]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the principle of self-liberation (rang grol) as the distinctive feature of Dzogchen practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, thoughts, emotions, and appearances are not transformed or purified through antidotes but liberated through recognition of their nature.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding self-liberation. Unlike other approaches that apply antidotes to delusions, Dzogchen recognizes that delusions are self-liberated when their nature is seen. The thought liberates itself; the emotion liberates itself; the appearance liberates itself.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that self-liberation is not a technique to be applied but the natural quality of awareness. Just as fire naturally burns, awareness naturally liberates whatever arises within it. This liberation is not a transformation but a recognition that the delusion was never other than awareness.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in self-liberation is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of liberation, ultimately there is nothing to liberate. Delusion is empty by nature; recognizing this emptiness is liberation.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the three modes of self-liberation: liberation upon arising (shar grol), liberation upon recognition (ngos grol), and liberation without trace (dri med grol). These describe progressively deeper levels of recognition.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to practice self-liberation. When a thought arises, instead of following it or suppressing it, one recognizes its nature as awareness. This recognition is liberation—not an act of will but the natural function of awareness.

The section discusses the relationship between self-liberation and other methods. While gradual vehicles emphasize antidotes and transformation, Dzogchen emphasizes recognition and self-liberation. This is faster but requires greater capacity for direct recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for self-liberation, recognizing it as the definitive approach to dealing with delusion. All methods of transformation are provisional compared to the direct recognition of self-liberation.

The section thus establishes self-liberation as the core principle of Dzogchen practice—delusions are not enemies to be destroyed but displays of awareness that liberate themselves when recognized.
