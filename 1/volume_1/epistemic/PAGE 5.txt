[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

The passage presents the expansion of pure fields within each particle as tantric cosmological assertion. The claim that "within the place of one particle, fields without number appear" operates within tantric epistemology, where spatial and numerical limitations are transcended through tantric vision.

The characterization of impure appearances as "like dreams" — appearing yet "not existing in truth" — presents the tantric view of illusion-like nature. However, without careful distinction, this could collapse into nihilism (denying appearances entirely) or reification (treating pure fields as truly existent while impure are illusory).

[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

The extensive quotation from the Samadhiraja Sutra represents a strategic deployment of sutric authority. By citing sutra passages about multiple Buddhas in hair-tip spaces and the coexistence of hells and heavens without mixing, the text establishes scriptural precedent for tantric/Dzogchen cosmology.

This operates as upaya — using the conventional framework of sutra to support views that exceed sutric parameters. The sutra's dream analogy serves a polemical function in distinguishing provisional appearance from definitive awareness, while also demonstrating continuity between sutric and tantric hermeneutics.

The shift back to tantric framing at line 162 indicates the sutra citation serves a supportive rather than definitive function in this context.
