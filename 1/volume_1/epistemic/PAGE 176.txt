[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[ACTIVITY AS SELF-RADIANCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Activity from Dzogchen: *'phrin las* is *rig pa*'s spontaneous display (*rol pa*), not function of realized being. No agent—activity is *rang snang* (self-appearance) responding to *gzhan snang* (other-appearance). The five Buddha activities are *rig pa*'s five natural expressions. Peace is *chos sku*'s nature; increase is *longs sku*'s qualities; power is *thugs rje*'s magnetizing; wrath is *ye shes*'s destroying of obscuration. All activity is *lhun grub*—without deliberate action (*bya rtsol*), naturally accomplishing benefit. This is definitive (*nges don*) view of activity.>
