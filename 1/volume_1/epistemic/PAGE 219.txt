<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*dbang gi sa bcu drug* — sixteen vidyādhara grounds, *thob pa* — obtaining, *gnas pa* — abiding, *brtan pa* — stable, *nye bar rtogs pa* — approaching realization)
- Hermeneutical precision: Classification of sixteen vidyādhara grounds (*rig 'dzin gyi sa bcu drug*) organized by four phases: obtaining (*thob pa*), abiding (*gnas pa*), stability (*brtan pa*), approaching realization (*nye bar rtogs pa*). These correspond to four aspects of each of the four empowerments, totaling sixteen. The grounds represent recognition-continua (*rtogs pa'i rgyun*) rather than spatial locations or hierarchical achievements.
- Temporal warnings: The four phases are aspects of recognition, not temporal sequence.
- Ontological warnings: To view grounds (*sa*) as progressively attainable contradicts Dzogchen's view of *ka dag* (primordial purity). All grounds are spontaneously present (*lhun grub*) as aspects of *rig pa*.
- Pedagogical purpose: The framework provides systematic taxonomy for recognition development. However, ultimate recognition transcends all ground distinctions—*sa med* (groundless) nature of *chos nyid*.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: GROUND REIFICATION] — Treating sixteen grounds as ontological stages rather than recognition-modes. [RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION] — Believing vidyādhara grounds must be sequentially traversed.>

[RISK: ELEMENTAL REIFICATION]
[RISK: PURIFICATION TEMPORALIZATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*thabs shes rab* — method and wisdom, *'byung ba bzhi* — four elements, *bcu drug dag pa* — sixteen purifications, *lus nyon mongs* — body and afflictions, *lnga brgya drug cu* — five hundred sixty)
- Hermeneutical precision: The eight methods-and-wisdoms (*thabs shes rab brgyad*) and four elements subdivided into sixteen (*sa'i sa* etc.) for purification framework. The body elements and afflictions (*nyon mongs*) analyzed into 512 configurations (4 elements × 4 subdivisions × 4 afflictions × 4 levels each, totaling 10,248 distinctions when fully elaborated). This represents exhaustive analytical framework for *sbyong byed* (purification).
- Temporal warnings: The numbers are analytical multiplicities, not literal counts.
- Ontological warnings: The elaborate numerical framework risks reifying elements and afflictions as real entities. In *ka dag*, no elements, no afflictions—only *chos nyid* (dharmatā).
- Pedagogical purpose: The exhaustive enumeration demonstrates thoroughness of path. However, Dzogchen shortcut: recognize *rig pa* and all numbers are spontaneously liberated.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: ELEMENTAL REIFICATION] — Treating four elements and sixteen subdivisions as ultimately real. [RISK: PURIFICATION TEMPORALIZATION] — Believing 512 configurations must be progressively purified rather than recognizing their primordial emptiness.>
