Explains condition-divided fault/quality through the camphor metaphor: camphor appears as quality for fever, fault for cold, yet fault/quality are not established in camphor's essence. Similarly, base-appearance's emergence-mode appears as quality (liberation-condition) for self-face knowers, fault (delusion-base) for non-knowers—yet fault/quality are not established in base or appearance. From spontaneous presence ground, delusion reverses: beings are primordial buddhas, faults manifest as qualities, bad conditions manifest as helpers. Faults self-pure liberate primordially.
