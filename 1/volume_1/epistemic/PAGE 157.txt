[GURU YOGA PRACTICE STRUCTURE]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Guru yoga practice structure: invocation (*spyan 'dren*), offerings (*mchod pa*), praise (*bstod pa*), receiving blessings (*byin rlabs*), dissolution (*bsdu ba*), integration (*bsre 'pho*). This is standard tantric sadhana format applied to guru. Each phase has specific function: invocation establishes connection, offerings create merit/positive conditions, praise aligns mind with recognition, blessings open to transmission, dissolution shows impermanence, integration merges guru and self. The structure supports recognition; in Dzogchen, structure dissolves into direct *rig pa*.>
