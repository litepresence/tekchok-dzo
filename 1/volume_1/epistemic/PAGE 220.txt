<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*dri ma* — obscuration, *sbyong byed* — purifying agent, *dbang bzhi* — four empowerments, *lus ngag yid sems* — body speech mind consciousness)
- Hermeneutical precision: The four empowerments purify four types of obscurations corresponding to body, speech, mind, and consciousness. Body obscurations: water gathering (*chu tshogs pa*) becoming imprisoning factor; fire ripening and clarifying into substantial existence; wind performing actions with self-grasping attachment. Speech obscurations: speech mind conceptions, body of speech, conceptual investigation of words, changing thought from expression.
- Temporal warnings: The purification is recognition, not temporal cleansing process.
- Ontological warnings: The obscurations are *ma rig pa* (non-recognition), not real entities. To enumerate them as if they exist contradicts *ka dag* view.
- Pedagogical purpose: The detailed analysis exhaustively covers what requires recognition. However, ultimate recognition transcends all enumeration—*ka dag* is beyond all purity and impurity.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: OBSTACLE REIFICATION] — Treating enumerated obscurations as real existents requiring removal. [RISK: PURIFICATION TEMPORALIZATION] — Believing purification occurs through time rather than being recognition of primordial purity.>
