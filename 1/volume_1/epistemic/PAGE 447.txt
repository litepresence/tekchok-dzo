<Svābhāvikakāya (*ngo bo nyid sku*): essence-body, the inseparability of the three kāyas. Not a fourth body but the unity of the three—empty essence, clear nature, and unceasing compassion as one. This prevents reifying the three as separate entities.>

<Jñānakāya (*ye shes sku*): wisdom-kāya, awareness's knowing quality. Not separate from the three kāyas but their luminous aspect. When the three kāyas are recognized as awareness-display, this is jñānakāya—the body of primordial knowing.>

<Ten additional kāyas making thirteen total. These are not separate from the main three but further elaborations—mahāsūkhakāya, ādarśajñānakāya, etc. Each describes an aspect of recognition-display. The number thirteen is pedagogical, not ontological.>
