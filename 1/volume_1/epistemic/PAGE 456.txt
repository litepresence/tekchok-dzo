<From the perspective of practice, one might work with different aspects sequentially—first recognizing dharmakāya's emptiness, then saṃbhogakāya's clarity, then nirmāṇakāya's activity. This is skillful means. But the fruition is simultaneous recognition of all.>

<The ultimate view: all thirteen kāyas complete in single instant of recognition. Not recognized one by one, not developed gradually, but fully present as the nature of rigpa itself. This is the meaning of "perfect in the ground" (*gzhi nas rdzogs*).>
