<Eight suitable for gaps: "Eight are suitable for gaps" (*gseng du rung ba brgyad yin no*) describes channels appropriate for specific interventions. Fourth section on crown great bliss wheel sequence (*bde chen 'khor lo'i rim pa so sor bshad pa*) begins detailed chakra exposition. The crown wheel (*spyi gtsug*) is highest of the four—associated with great bliss (*bde chen*), clear light (*'od gsal*), and dharmakāya. Working here requires most subtle awareness. The text now systematically applies Six Yogas framework to each chakra: withdrawal, concentration, life-force, retention, recollection, samādhi. This is graduated path—each yoga builds on previous.>
