[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[WISDOM-KNOWLEDGE EMPOWERMENT]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Third empowerment: Wisdom-knowledge empowerment (*shes rab ye shes kyi dbang*) introduces bliss-emptiness (*bde stong*) non-dual experience. This authorizes sexual yoga (*sbyor ba*) practices or their subtle body equivalents. Critical risk: Confusing tantric bliss cultivation with Dzogchen's spontaneous bliss. In tantra, bliss is method (*thabs*) for realizing emptiness; in Dzogchen, bliss-emptiness is intrinsic (*rang bzhin*). The empowerment plants seed for non-dual wisdom but requires practice to ripen. This is high tantra—most powerful and most easily misinterpreted.>
