Completes four conditions explanation: cause ignorance three, condition three time-equal creates equal immediate condition—delusion actually arises. When recognizing cause as buddha-sentient-being one beyond acceptance-rejection wisdom, cause condition self-place liberates. Objects variously arising liberate as reality's self-appearance. Master condition liberates as nature self-arising wisdom. Without time certainty, before-after mutually conflict—equal immediate condition self-place liberates. Cause-condition two making delusion nature, their ripening accumulation differs through body-mind. This very samsara's first: Thalgyur states samsara's first from non-distinguishing nature, grasping object arises, thought-grasping different appears.
