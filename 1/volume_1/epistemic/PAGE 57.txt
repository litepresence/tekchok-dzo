[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section provides a detailed exposition of the Mind-Only (sems tsam) or Cittamatra school, presenting its three-nature (trisvabhava) theory as a sophisticated philosophical system that, while profound, remains within the domain of [PROVISIONAL MEANING] from the Dzogchen perspective. The three natures—the imagined (parikalpita, kun brtags), dependent (paratantra, gzhan dbang), and perfected (parinispanna, yongs grub)—offer a systematic framework for understanding the relationship between mind and its objects.

The imagined nature refers to the false attribution of inherent existence to phenomena, the dependent nature describes the causal flow of mind and its projections, while the perfected nature is the realization of emptiness within the dependent. From the Dzogchen standpoint, this threefold structure represents an important intermediate stage between naive realism and the thorough emptiness of Madhyamaka, yet it retains a subtle reification of the alaya-vijnana (kun gzhi rnam par shes pa) as truly existent.

The epistemic stratification [DEFINITIVE MEANING] vs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] is crucial here. Mind-Only's denial of external objects while maintaining the true existence of consciousness represents a philosophical advance over the external realism of the lower vehicles, yet falls short of the complete emptiness taught in the Middle Way. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that even the alaya-vijnana is empty, being itself a conceptual construct rather than an ultimately existent ground.

The section discusses Mind-Only's eight consciousnesses—the five sense consciousnesses, mental consciousness, afflicted mind (nyon yid), and alaya-vijnana—demonstrating how this system maps the cognitive process in detail. However, from the [ULTIMATE TRUTH] perspective, these consciousnesses are conventional designations (tha snyad) rather than ultimately real entities. Dzogchen's rig pa transcends this entire structure, being neither the alaya nor its transformations.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] predominates as the text outlines Mind-Only's ontological commitments. The school's assertion that "the three worlds are mind-only" (khams gsum sems tsam) is both its strength and limitation—profoundly true from a certain perspective, yet incomplete without the recognition that mind itself is empty. The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] implicit here involves analyzing experience to recognize the mental nature of appearances, yet stopping short of the direct recognition that transcends analysis.

The distinction between [DZOGCHEN VIEW] and [PROVISIONAL VIEW] becomes clear in how Mind-Only posits a truly existent substrate consciousness, whereas Dzogchen recognizes even the ground of being (gzhi) as empty and beyond all characterization. The transition from Mind-Only to Dzogchen involves dissolving the subtlest reifications, recognizing that rig pa is not a consciousness among consciousnesses but the nature of mind itself, beyond all conceptual proliferation.
