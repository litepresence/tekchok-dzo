<Terms general exposition: "First, terms general exposition" (*dang po rnam grangs spyir bstan pa*) begins systematic Six Yogas instruction. "Tenth, water's gatherer blood" (*bcu na chu yi sdud byed khrag*) continues elemental-body correlations—showing how each yoga targets specific elements and aggregates. The general exposition establishes framework before particular applications. This pedagogical structure—general to specific, theory to practice—reflects traditional Tibetan instructional method. Student receives overview, then detailed guidance. The text functions as both reference manual and practice guide, requiring oral instruction (*man ngag*) to unlock full meaning.>
