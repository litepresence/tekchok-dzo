[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VIEW AS CERTAINTY]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the view (lta ba) as the first aspect of the Dzogchen path—the philosophical certainty that establishes the framework for practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, view is not merely intellectual understanding but direct recognition of the natural state expressed conceptually for those who need such expression.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in establishing the view. The Dzogchen view holds that all phenomena are primordially pure (ka dag), spontaneously perfect (lhun grub), and self-liberated (rang grol). This is not a belief to be adopted but a recognition to be experienced.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the view transcends all philosophical positions, including the Middle Way's emptiness. While emptiness deconstructs inherent existence, Dzogchen points to the positive presence of awareness that is empty yet luminous, beyond both existence and non-existence.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in the view is the recognition that while we conceptually distinguish primordial purity, spontaneous presence, and compassionate energy, ultimately these are inseparable aspects of a single reality that transcends all description.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the three principles of Dzogchen view: the ground as primordially pure, the path as self-liberation, and the result as spontaneous presence. These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of the natural state.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how the view guides practice. With the view of primordial purity, nothing needs to be rejected; with the view of spontaneous perfection, nothing needs to be achieved; with the view of self-liberation, nothing needs to be transformed.

The section discusses the relationship between view and meditation. In Dzogchen, view and meditation are inseparable—the view is the recognition that is continuously present in meditation, and meditation is the continuous flow of that recognition. There is no view without meditation, no meditation without view.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the Dzogchen view, recognizing it as the definitive philosophical position that transcends all others. While it respects the Middle Way's emptiness, it goes beyond to the positive presence of awareness.

The section thus establishes the view as the philosophical foundation of Dzogchen practice, the certainty in primordial purity that guides all subsequent meditation and conduct.
