<Heart inside to eye light channel path made appearance: "From heart inside to eye, light channel path made, appearance" (*snying nang nas mig tu 'od rtsa lam byas te snang ba la*) describes physiological basis for light experiences—channel connecting heart to eyes carries luminous energy. This is sems-side explanation of how lamps manifest physically. "Demigods subtle and flickering" (*lha min rnams la phra zhing 'khyug*) begins six-realm description—how lamps appear differently to different beings based on karma and embodiment. Gods see vast, demigods subtle-flickering, humans round self-luminous. These are relative appearances of same nature—different clarity levels, not different essences.>
