[ELEMENTS & REALMS DEPENDENT ORIGINATION]

<Dependent origination of elements and realms. Lines 12372-12386: "Earth water fire wind sky also, Element great that from arise, God and demigod human and, Hell animal hungry-ghost, Great that from correctly arise, Desire anger delusion and, Pride jealousy etc., That self from miracle arise, Ignorance sentient-being mind and, Aggregate element and sense-base and, Consciousness collection and, Faculty five etc. arise, Sound and smell and taste and, Touch and object-of-desire, That self from action continuum arise"—also earth water fire wind sky; arise from that great element; and human and demigod and god; hungry-ghost animal hell; correctly arise from that great; and delusion anger desire; etc. jealousy pride; arise miracle from self that; and mind sentient-being ignorance; and sense-base and element aggregate; and collection consciousness; arise etc. five faculty; and taste and smell and sound; object-of-desire and touch; arise continuum action from self that. **Dependent origination levels**:
1. **Elements** ('byung ba): earth, water, fire, wind, space → great elements
2. **Realms** ('jig rten): gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hells
3. **Afflictions** (nyon mongs): desire, anger, delusion, pride, jealousy
4. **Miraculous arise** (rdzus skyes): from ignorance, mind, aggregates, elements, sense bases, consciousness, faculties
5. **Sense objects** (yul): sound, smell, taste, touch, desirable objects
6. **Action continuum** (las rgyun): karma continuation

All arise dependently—no independent self-nature. This is *rten 'brel* teaching, not Dzogchen view of spontaneous presence.>
