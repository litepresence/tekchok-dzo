[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GROUND AS PRIMORDIAL PURITY]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: ONTOLOGICAL FOUNDATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section begins the detailed exposition of the ground (gzhi) as primordial purity (ka dag), the foundation of Dzogchen view. From the Dzogchen perspective, the ground is not a metaphysical substance or first cause but the basic space of phenomena (chos dbyings)—the empty, luminous nature of reality that is the source of all appearance yet remains unaffected by it.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in its most fundamental sense. Primordial purity means that the ground has never been stained by delusion, has never been improved by practice, and has never been altered by any condition. It is "primordial" because it has been pure since beginningless time, not achieving purity at some point.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the ground as the nature of mind itself (sems nyid)—self-aware, self-luminous, and free from all extremes. It is not existent (as a thing), not non-existent (as nothing), not both, and not neither. These four extremes are conceptual impositions; the ground itself transcends all conceptual categories.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] at the level of the ground is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of a "ground," ultimately there is nothing to identify as ground. The term is a conventional designation (tha snyad) pointing to what cannot be pointed to, a finger indicating the moon of non-referential awareness.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the ground's threefold nature: essence (ngo bo) as emptiness, nature (rang bzhin) as clarity, and compassionate energy (thugs rje) as unobstructed manifestation. These three are inseparable—the empty essence is naturally luminous, the luminous nature spontaneously manifests, the manifestations are empty by nature.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component points to direct recognition of the ground through introduction (ngo sprod). The master points out the nature of mind, and the disciple recognizes it. This is not an intellectual understanding but a direct experience of the ground's threefold nature in one's own awareness.

The section discusses the ground's relationship to samsara and nirvana. Both are equally expressions of the ground, neither staining nor improving it. Samsara is the ground not recognized; nirvana is the ground recognized. The ground itself remains unchanged throughout.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] throughout, recognizing that the ground is the definitive truth that underlies all appearances. All other teachings are provisional insofar as they prepare for this recognition.

The section thus establishes the ontological foundation of Dzogchen—the primordially pure ground that is the nature of mind, the source of all appearance, and the basis of liberation.
