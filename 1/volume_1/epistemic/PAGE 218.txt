<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*dri ma* — obscuration, *dag byed* — purifying agent, *phyi nang gsang ba* — outer inner secret, *yongs rdzogs* — utterly complete)
- Hermeneutical precision: Continuation of sixteen obscurations analysis, organized by four dimensions: outer (*lus ngag yid sems* body speech mind consciousness), inner (*rtog pa* conceptual), secret (*'gyu ba* movement), utterly secret (*sems* mind). Each dimension has four obscurations to be purified through corresponding empowerment aspects.
- Temporal warnings: "Purification" is recognition, not temporal process.
- Ontological warnings: The framework risks implying that obscurations exist and require removal. Dzogchen view: obscurations are *ma rig pa* (non-recognition) itself—when recognition arises, no obscuration ever existed.
- Pedagogical purpose: The exhaustive enumeration serves pedagogical thoroughness. However, the Dzogchen shortcut: recognize *ka dag* and all obscurations are spontaneously liberated (*rang grol*).
- Risk explanation: [RISK: OBSTACLE REIFICATION] — Treating enumerated obscurations as real entities. [RISK: PURIFICATION TEMPORALIZATION] — Believing purification is process occurring in time rather than atemporal recognition.>

[RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*dbang bcu drug* — sixteen empowerments, *sa bcu drug* — sixteen grounds, *dag pa* — purification, *las* — karma/action, *nyon mongs* — affliction)
- Hermeneutical precision: The sixteen empowerments (*dbang bcu drug*) correlated with sixteen vidyādhara grounds (*sa bcu drug*). Each empowerment purifies specific aspects: outer empowerments purify external karma (*phyir 'byung ba'i las*), inner purify mental concepts (*nang du sems kyi rtog pa*), secret purify wind movements (*gsang bar rlung gi 'phen sdud*), utterly secret establish certainty of abiding on sixteen grounds (*bla med par sa bcu drug la gnas pa'i nges pa*).
- Temporal warnings: The grounds are recognition-continua, not sequential attainments.
- Ontological warnings: The grounds (*sa*) are not locations to reach but recognition-modes. To view them as progressive achievements contradicts Dzogchen's view of *lhun grub* (spontaneous perfection).
- Pedagogical purpose: The correlation provides comprehensive framework linking tantric empowerment to Dzogchen grounds. However, ultimate recognition transcends all ground distinctions.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION] — Believing sixteen grounds must be traversed sequentially. In Dzogchen, all grounds are simultaneously present (*lhun grub*) in recognition of *rig pa*.>
