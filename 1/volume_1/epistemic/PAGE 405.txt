<Appearances as objects (*rnam pa yul du snang ba*)—pure without defilement, number exhausted. The lamp's vajra snake-noose points to space itself, naturally without essence. Understanding this meaning is the definition of essential nature: primordially without separation or gathering.>

[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Threefold division of the sphere lamp: ground-abiding, path-display, fruition-appearance. These are pedagogical distinctions, not temporal stages. Ground: wisdom-kāya naturally present. Path: bindu-essence gathering. Fruition: snake-noose held prisoner—light nets and patterns self-displayed.>

<From *Sgron ma 'bar ba*: Ground-abiding pure sphere's awareness-wisdom held as kāya. Path-display sphere gathers bindu's essence. Object-display sphere holds the snake-noose prisoner. All these are divisions of that. Understanding that they are not sequential developments but simultaneous aspects prevents the error of temporalization.>
