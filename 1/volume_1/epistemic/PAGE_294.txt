Lines 12227-12241: "Compassion sentient-being to appear capacity possess, That to grasp-maker-by-means-of consciousness ignorance part from arise fracture one shift from, Consciousness dark that from I arise or, I from that arise think-by-means-of consciousness arise only-by-means-of delude, Ignorance that basis to not-possess experience-or appearance to exist, Appearance from condition appearance four arise, That also basis light house-by-means-of manner-as dwell from cause condition called, Ignorance actual, That to investigate go-by-means-of master condition called, That to subject-as grasp-by-means-of object condition called, Example mirror on man face show like, That three time equal-by-means-of immediate condition called, That self-by-means-of basis be self-by-means-of face not-know and delude realm-three samsara establish, That from affliction coarse go-by-means-of sentient-being-by-means-of form different arise, Basis thus from delude said"—possess capacity to appear compassion to sentient being; from arise fracture one shift from part ignorance consciousness grasp-maker by means of to that; or I arise from that dark consciousness; delude only by means of arise consciousness by means of think arise from that I; exist to appearance or experience not possess to basis that ignorance; four arise appearance condition from appearance; called cause condition from dwell as manner house light basis also that; actual ignorance; called master condition by means of go investigate to that; called object condition by means of grasp as subject to that; like show face man on mirror example; called immediate condition by means of equal three time that; establish samsara realm-three delude and not know face self by means of be basis self by means of that; arise different form by means of sentient being by means of go coarse affliction from that; said delude from thus basis. **Consciousness fracture** (*rnam shes chag*): compassion capacity → grasping consciousness → ignorance. Four conditions (*rkyen bzhi*):
1. Light house dwelling (basis as condition)
2. Actual ignorance
3. Master condition (investigating)
4. Object condition (grasping subject)

Mirror example: face shown on mirror. Immediate condition: equal three times. Not knowing self-face establishes samsara.>
