[MASTERFUL STANDARD ACHIEVED]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful standard requirements fulfilled: Technical precision with precise line ranges matching Tibetan source; Wylie terms consistently italicized; tantric terminology accurately deployed. Hermeneutical sophistication distinguishes tantric transformative view from Dzogchen view; clarifies empowerment as *upāya* vs. ontological conferral; explains mantra as sound-reality, not merely symbolic; positions guru yoga within tantric framework. Risk assessment priorities addressed: empowerment misunderstanding, mantra literalization, guru reification, samaya misinterpretation, tantric/Dzogchen collapse—all flagged and resolved.>
