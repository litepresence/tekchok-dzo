[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Secret mantra near path: "Secret mantra's near path is channel-bindu-wind three vital point depending" (*gsang sngags kyi nye lam ni rtsa thig rlung gsum gnad bstun pa*)—tantric path works directly with subtle body. "Body speech's vital point pressing, mind incidentally liberated" (*lus ngag gi gnad gzir bas sems zhar la grol*) describes how physical practice can spontaneously liberate mind. This transitions to Dzogchen: "Wisdom actually appearing, making three kāyas path, bindu supreme vital point explained, all vehicles' transcended vital point" (*ye shes dngos su snang bas sku gsum lam du byed pa thig le bla med pa'i gnad gsungs pas theg pa kun gyis 'phags pa'i gnad do*). Declarative finality: The highest vital point transcends all vehicles—Dzogchen view.>
