[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]

[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

<The specification that Pure Abodes (*gnas gtsang ma*) are exclusive to āryas (*'phags pa*) and inaccessible to ordinary beings (*so so skye bo*) marks Dzogchen distinction between recognition and non-recognition. This polemical clarification of path structure establishes that certain realizations are ontologically unavailable without direct awareness recognition.>
