[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[LETTER GROUP MEANINGS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Letter group symbolic meanings: five groups (guttural to labial) corresponding to five Buddha families (*rigs lnga*), five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*), five elements (*'byung ba lnga*). *Ka* as Akṣobhya/vajra-family/mirror-wisdom, *ca* as Amitābha/padma-family/discriminating-wisdom, etc. This is tantric transformative framework—using symbolic resonance for psychological transformation. The correspondences are not arbitrary but based on phonetic production (guttural = deep/mirror, dental = sharp/discriminating). Sound physiology maps onto wisdom topology.>
