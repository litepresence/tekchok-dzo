[DZOGCHEN VIEW – UNITY OF VIEW AND CONDUCT]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: INTEGRATED PRACTICE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the unity of view, meditation, and conduct as the hallmark of Dzogchen practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, these three are not separate activities to be coordinated but inseparable aspects of the natural state.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding unity. Unlike approaches that separate study (view), sitting practice (meditation), and daily activity (conduct), Dzogchen recognizes that all three are the continuous expression of the natural state.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that view is the recognition of the natural state, meditation is the continuous flow of that recognition, and conduct is the natural expression of recognition in activity. These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in this unity is the recognition that while conventionally we distinguish study, practice, and activity, ultimately there is only the natural state expressing itself in all its variety.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: there is no view without meditation, no meditation without conduct, no conduct without view. Each implies and includes the others; separation is conceptual imposition.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to maintain this unity. The view recognized in study continues in meditation; the meditation recognized on the cushion continues in activity; the activity of daily life becomes continuous meditation.

The section discusses the relationship between this unity and conventional discipline. While beginners may need to separate study, meditation, and conduct to develop each, advanced practice dissolves these distinctions. The goal is seamless unity.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for this unity, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While conventional frameworks separate the three, the ultimate reality is their inseparability.

The section thus establishes the unity of view, meditation, and conduct as the natural expression of Dzogchen—three names for the same recognition, three aspects of the same practice, three expressions of the same natural state.
