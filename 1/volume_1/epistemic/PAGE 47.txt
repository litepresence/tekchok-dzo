[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The complete destruction cosmology—world-system burning to golden ground (*gser gyi sa gzhi*), dissolving through seven absorptions (*bsam gtan*) to space—presents Abhidharmic framework. The common vehicle (*thun mong gi theg pa*) calculation of 80 intermediate aeons per great kalpa operates at conventional level. Risk: Confusing Dzogchen's spontaneous perfection (*lhun grub*) with causal vehicle gradual cycling.>
