[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NINE VEHICLES FRAMEWORK]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PEDAGOGICAL STRATIFICATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON TRANSITION]

This section introduces the comprehensive framework of the nine vehicles (theg pa dgu), organizing Buddhist teachings into a hierarchical structure that accommodates practitioners of varying capacities. From the Dzogchen perspective, this nine-fold classification represents a sophisticated [PROVISIONAL MEANING] structure that guides beings progressively toward the definitive recognition of rig pa.

The epistemic stratification distinguishes between the three outer vehicles (phyi'i theg pa gsum)—Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva—and the six inner vehicles (nang gi theg pa drug) of tantra. The outer vehicles are causal vehicles (rgyu'i theg pa), accumulating merit and wisdom as causes for future enlightenment. The inner vehicles are result vehicles ('bras bu'i theg pa), recognizing enlightenment as already present and perfect.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] transcends this classification while respecting its pedagogical function. From the ultimate perspective, there are no vehicles—there is only the self-recognition of awareness. However, the [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] acknowledges that beings require gradual training, and the nine vehicles provide a systematic path from the coarse to the subtle, from the provisional to the definitive.

The causal-result distinction is crucial here. Causal vehicles work through cause and effect, gradually purifying obscurations and accumulating positive qualities. Result vehicles recognize that the result is already present in the ground—enlightenment is not produced but discovered. Dzogchen, as the highest result vehicle, embodies this recognition most fully.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the ontological and soteriological claims of each vehicle, while [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] describes the practices through which these views are realized. The progression from vehicle to vehicle represents an increasingly subtle understanding of emptiness and the nature of mind.

The [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] dichotomy operates throughout this presentation. Conventionally, the vehicles are distinct paths with different views, meditations, conduct, and results. Ultimately, they are all expressions of the same natural state, different ways of approaching the same recognition of rig pa.

The section prepares the ground for detailed presentation of each vehicle. The first three will be summarized briefly as the foundation, while the six tantric vehicles will receive more detailed treatment, culminating in the three divisions of Dzogchen: semde, longde, and mengagde.

The epistemic stance maintains that while the framework is pedagogically necessary, it should not be reified. The vehicles are not ultimately separate paths to separate goals but progressive disclosures of the same truth. Dzogchen represents the direct pointing to this truth, bypassing the need for the gradual approach when the practitioner has sufficient capacity.

The section thus serves as an overview, establishing the hermeneutical principles that will guide the detailed exposition to follow. The practitioner is reminded that all teachings are skillful means, and the ultimate goal transcends all vehicles—the direct recognition of primordial purity and spontaneous perfection.
