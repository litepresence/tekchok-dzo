Explains Buddha's manifestation through supreme wisdom and compassion for realizing others. Such teacher, awakened before all, benefits time-three buddhas and realm-three sentient beings—without first or last, sovereign perfect teacher Samantabhadra. Field and deed: as much as sentient-being and buddha appearance, that much in reality-penetrating sky. Third topic: sentient beings' delusion from ignorance. Though no delusion in first base, when base-appearance arises, self-face not-knowing consciousness with rigpa root categorizes base-appearance, deluding as sentient being. From Pearl Garland: from great difference appearance, existence and non-existence two arise—common ground delusion-basis called.
