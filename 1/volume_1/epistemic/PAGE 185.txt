[SELF-LIBERATION PRINCIPLE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Self-liberation (*rang grol*): not liberation from something, but self-liberated nature. Obscurations (*sgrib pa*) self-liberated—never truly obscured. Confusion (*'khrul pa*) self-liberated—never truly confused. This is *rang sar grol* (liberated in its own place)—no need for antidote, no need for correction. The phrase *ye grol* (primordially liberated) indicates liberation is ground, not result. Recognition is recognition of this self-liberation. This is radical freedom—freedom without bondage, liberation without path.>
