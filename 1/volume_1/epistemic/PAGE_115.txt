[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[INDICATING TANTRA AS METHOD]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Indicating method tantra (*mtshon byed thabs kyi rgyud*): instruction pointing out meaning-to-be-indicated for realizing awareness. The definition emphasizes *nyams len gyi gnad dril nas* (condensing practice essential points)—this is skillful means (*thabs*), not the pointed-to itself. The distinction between explanation tantras (*bshad rgyud*) as difficult wordy and instruction tantras (*man ngag gi rgyud*) as clear and easy indicates pedagogical stratification. Dzogchen tantras classified as *man ngag gi rgyud* because direct pointing (*ngo sprod*) rather than philosophical elaboration.>

[GRADUAL VS. INSTANTANEOUS PATHS]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<The twofold division into effort-free primordial liberation (*'bad med ye grol*) and effortful gradual (*'bad bcas rim pas*): first is *gzhi khregs chod* (cutting through ground) for simultaneous (*cig car*) capacities; second is *lam thod rgal* (direct transcendence leap) for gradual (*rim gyis*) capacities using channels/winds essential points (*rtsa rlung gi gnad*). This is Dzogchen's *sde gsum* (three series) taxonomy: *sems sde* (cutting through), *klong sde* (direct transcendence), *man ngag gi sde* (instruction). The three essential points—body, gate, object—are *lam* (path) frameworks, not ontological requirements. Four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) reaching measure indicates tantric completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) framework applied to Dzogchen.>
