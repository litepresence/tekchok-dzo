[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEVEN BASES FRAMEWORK]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL STRUCTURE]

<Introduction to seven bases (*gzhi bdun*)—Dzogchen's systematic classification of views on the basis (*gzhi*). Line 10472-10473: "basis seven's nature general shown and, supreme's basis particular explain"—framework overview. The seven bases are not competing theories but progressive approximations, culminating in definitive meaning (*nges don*). Line 10474-10476: Three-part structure—brief nature explanation, critique of extreme views, placement in authentic text. The seven bases are:
1. Basis primordially pure (*ka dag*)
2. Basis spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*)
3. Basis not certain (*ma nges*)
4. Basis certain meaning actual basis (*nges don dngos gzhi*)
5. Basis whatever transform able (*ci yang 'gyur*)
6. Basis whatever promise able (*ci yang khas len*)
7. Basis various (*sna tshogs*)

This is *rnal 'byor spyod pa'i dbu ma* (Yogācāra-Svātantrika) style classification—using apparent contradiction to point beyond conceptual fixation.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BASES 1-2: KA DAG LHUN GRUB]
[PRIMORDIAL PURITY & SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]

<First two bases establish Dzogchen's foundational dyad. Basis primordially pure (10490): "elaboration-free drop great's aspect from"—*spros bral thig le chen po'i cha nas*—the great bindu free from elaboration. This is *ka dag* as negation: basis not contaminated by samsara, never was. Basis spontaneous presence (10491): "awareness's nature to quality self-nature primordial dwell sun and ray's manner having and stain not-have"—*rig pa rang byung gi yon tan rang bzhin ye gnas*. Sun-ray metaphor: nature (*ngo bo*) and quality (*yon tan*) inseparable, both primordially present. Risk: Treating ka dag and lhun grub as sequential (first pure, then present) or separate (pure=emptiness, presence=appearance). Dzogchen view: simultaneous, non-dual—emptiness IS appearance, appearance IS emptiness.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BASES 3-7: PROGRESSIVE REFINEMENT]
[BEYOND CONCEPTUAL EXTREMES]

<Bases 3-7 refine view through negation of extremes:
- **Basis not certain** (10492): "awareness's nature to this is one not-established direction all elaboration-free great view"—no single definitive description possible
- **Basis certain** (10493): "awareness's nature change not view certain having"—unchanging nature provides certainty
- **Basis whatever transform able** (10494): "whatever arise view by-means-of whatever transform able"—basis manifests as all possible forms
- **Basis whatever promise able** (10495): "samsara-nirvana's dharma all arise view whatever promise able view"—basis accommodates all phenomena
- **Basis various** (10496): "awareness's nature to appear manner thought not-cease appear view by-means-of various view khra bo called"—myriad display (*khra bo*) of unceasing appearance

The progression: from purity/presence (1-2) → beyond certainty/uncertainty (3-4) → all-accommodating (5-6) → manifold display (7). Not ladder but mandala—each "view" is aspect of single recognition.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CRITIQUE OF EXTREME VIEWS]
[PEDAGOGICAL LIMITATION]

<Lines 10497-10498: "this also awareness one to respective's tenet direction one see after placed is, consequence from"—these seven are "views" (*lta ba*) from perspective of philosophical tenets (*grub mtha'*), not direct recognition. "Fall by-means-of establish one's ground-reality" (*bden gshis*)—reifying any view misses the basis. Lines 10500-10508 summarize characteristics:
- Seven manners of abiding (*gnas tshul*)
- Spontaneous presence as various aspect
- Not-certain as move-measure
- Certain as not-move
- Appear measure as whatever transform
- Promise accompany all arising
- Delusion purify as primordial-pure
- Appear manner as khra bor

This is *thad kar* (summation)—the seven bases exhaust all possible conceptual approaches to basis, showing each insufficient. Teaching strategy: lead students through all views to transcend all views.>

[RISK: REIFICATION OF CLASSIFICATION]

<The seven bases present sophisticated trap: readers may treat classification as map of reality rather than pedagogical device. Each basis is conceptual approximation (*don spyi*), not basis itself. The progression from ka dag → lhun grub → ... → sna tshogs suggests hierarchy, but Longchenpa warns: "awareness one to respective's tenet direction one see after placed is"—these are views ABOUT awareness, not awareness itself. The "actual basis" (*dngos gzhi*) is not basis #4 but what all seven attempt to describe. Risk of "shopping" for preferred view—finding one's temperament in basis classification rather than recognizing basis beyond temperament. The seven bases are fingers, not moon. Final line "thus and" indicates continuation—framework established, now application.>
