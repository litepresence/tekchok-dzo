<Channel form elaboration: "To those channel forms" (*rtsa yi rnam pa de dag la*) continues systematic description of subtle body architecture. This extended passage enumerates channel types, locations, and functions with precise technical terminology. The detail serves multiple purposes: (1) provides complete map for advanced practice, (2) demonstrates master's comprehensive knowledge, (3) creates receptive mind through awe at complexity, (4) prepares practitioner for precise visualization. This is not mere information—it is transmission (*rlung*) embedded in descriptive precision. Reading with proper motivation plants seeds of realization.>
