[SAMAYA AS CAUSAL MECHANISM]

<Fivefold guru-reliance (*bla ma bsten pa*) establishes dependent-origination framework for tantric accomplishment. Lines 10281-10285 present causal chain: guru reliance stops cyclic stream (*'khor rgyun 'gag*), empowerment ripens body-speech (*lus ngag smin*), samaya produces actual accomplishment (*dngos grub*), view ceases three realms (*khams gsum*), meditation stops delusion (*'khrul pa*), conduct purifies body. This is not sequential practice but simultaneous aspects of guru yoga—each "reliance" (*bsten pa*) is mode of connection to source of blessing (*byin rlabs*). The instrumental particle (*kyis*) after each practice indicates tantric causality: guru-reliance AS CAUSE produces stream-stopping AS EFFECT. Risk: Misreading as ordinary moral injunction rather than empowerment-contingent methodology.>

[SAMAYA DEGENERATION TYPOLOGY]

<Fourfold degeneration taxonomy (*nyams pa*) determines restoration feasibility:
1. **Contradict** (*'gal*)—opposite action performed, restorable through confession ritual
2. **Degenerate** (*nyams*)—samaya weakened but not contradicted, restorable through intense regret
3. **Crossed** (*lhag*)—exceeds temporal boundaries (year+ gap), conditional restoration
4. **Loose** (*bral*)—year two-three elapsed, restoration requires extreme measures

Time parameters are precise: day-gap = contradict, month-gap = degenerate, year-gap = crossed, 2-3 years = loose. These are not moral judgments but technical classifications determining ritual response. Restoration (*bskos*) requires knowing (*shes*) the specific method for each type. The Vajrasattva samaya citation establishes scriptural authority for this typology.>

[RESTORATION PROTOCOLS]

<Detailed restoration (*bskos*) procedures mapped to degeneration degree:
- **Contradict**: Confession (*gsol ba*) with aimed object (*dmigs yul*) immediately—no gap day-plus
- **Degenerate**: Intense regret confession within month, otherwise enters crossed category
- **Crossed**: Confession without year-plus gap, pure restoration possible
- **Loose**: Post-three-years, restoration impossible (*bskos su rung ba ma yin*)

Line 10320 "restore able not is" marks irreversible threshold. Consequence: "certain earth-dwell suffering to continually conduct"—doom to vajra hell (*rdo rje dmyal ba*). The instrumental logic is rigorous: degeneration type determines restoration method determines feasibility. This is judicial-ritual system, not ethical appeal.>

[RESTORATION IMPLEMENTATION]

<Specific restoration modalities:
- Contradict: Gathering's wheel (*tshogs kyi 'khor lo*) confession—group ritual
- Degenerate: Self-possession (*rang gi nor*) restoration—personal resources
- Crossed: Body-speech-mind (*lus ngag yid*) + possession + wife/children—total commitment
- Loose: Self-life (*rang srog*) restoration—ultimate stakes

"Great degenerate" (*nyams pa chen po*) beyond loose: irreparable. Line 10334 transition to "third supreme samaya explain is" signals shift to highest samaya category (*bla na med pa'i dam tshig*). The restoration economy is stark: temporal delay escalates cost geometrically until restoration becomes impossible. This structures tantric urgency—samaya breach is not sin but systemic damage with limited repair windows.>
