Presents Aspect 6: Self-Liberation. Base-appearance part manifests as light clarity; from spontaneous presence appearance, kaya-like manifestations bundle. Pure wisdom and impure samsara are the two doors of spontaneous presence jewel-appearance. Knowing self-face: compassion, non-dual, extreme-free appear, potency dissolves into base and liberates. Buddha and sentient being differ only in knowing/not-knowing self-face—samsara-nirvana's cause is one, like palm and back of hand. Appearances need neither acceptance nor rejection; traceless self-reverse when other-appearances arise.
