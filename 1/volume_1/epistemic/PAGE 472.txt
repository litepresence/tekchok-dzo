[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Progressive approach: śrāvakayāna and pratyekabuddhayāna establish renunciation and understanding of no-self. Mahāyāna establishes bodhicitta and emptiness. Outer tantra establishes purification and ritual. Inner tantra establishes transformation and subtle body. Dzogchen establishes recognition beyond all.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Dzogchen is not superior in essence—all paths lead to the same wisdom. But Dzogchen is swifter for those with capacity, directly pointing to what is rather than gradually transforming what seems to be. This is the meaning of "supreme vehicle."

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The danger of Dzogchen pride: thinking "I practice the highest vehicle, therefore I am superior." This is worse than lower vehicle conceit because it obscures the very recognition it claims. Humility and devotion are essential even in the highest view.>
