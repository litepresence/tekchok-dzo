[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[GURU AS THREE KĀYAS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Guru as three kāyas (*bla ma sku gsum*): dharmakāya guru is emptiness-nature, saṃbhogakāya guru is clarity-qualities, nirmāṇakāya guru is compassionate manifestation. The outer guru (person) is nirmāṇakāya—skillful means for accessing deeper dimensions. The guru is also three jewels (*dkon mchog gsum*): Buddha (awakened), Dharma (path), Sangha (community). Guru yoga unifies these in single recognition. This is tantric framework—using guru-relationship as transformative technology. The ultimate guru is *chos nyid* itself; personal guru is its accessible form.>
