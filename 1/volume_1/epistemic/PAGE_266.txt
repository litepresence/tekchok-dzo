[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THAL 'GYUR SYNTHESIS]
[ESSENCE-NATURE-COMPASSION TRIAD]

<Citation from *Thal 'gyur* (Tantra of Spontaneous Liberation) completing samaya section. Lines 10907-10909: "Complete one appearance great, compassion understanding not-cease abide thus"—*rdzogs pa gcig snang ba chen po, thugs rje go ma 'gags par bzhugs so*—great single appearance of completion, compassion abides without ceasing. Lines 10910-10926: "beginning essence nature and, compassion form three-as abide, that also essence body-as abide by-means-of, dharma and enjoyment emanation part, not-divide divide not-exist manner, bebs from accomplish itself, body color etc mind object not-exist, nature arise-do light manner, white red yellow and green blue, mark marked not-is, category not-exist knowable bebs from accomplish, compassion arise various from, this-like one certain not-exist by-means-of, various appear base called"—essence, nature, compassion abide as three; essence as body; dharma/enjoyment/emanation parts not divided; *bebs* (spontaneous arising) accomplishes itself. Body/color not mind objects; nature arises as light manner—five colors without marks; categories non-existent, knowables spontaneously accomplished; compassion arises variously. This is "various appear base" (*sna tshogs snang ba'i gzhi*)—basis as manifold display.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PRIMORDIAL PURE SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
[NON-DUAL ANALYSIS]

<Lines 10925-10928: "essence primordially-pure reverse-from examine if what-also not-established outside clear part light and body color etc marked not-established although, that nature spontaneous-presence expanse from primordial-resonance light five body and ray and sphere appear most subtle identity, expanse inside swirl inside clear subtle wisdom exist"—examining essence primordially pure: nothing established externally, clear light/body/color not marked. Nature spontaneous presence: from expanse, primordial resonance (*ye gdangs*), five lights, body/ray/sphere appear as most subtle identity. Inside expanse, inside swirl (*thigs le*), clear subtle wisdom exists. Lines 10928-10944: "that also primordially-pure isolate side-as split if, body and wisdom arise part what is, base at primordially-pure what-also not-exist is, that expanse from arise think if, exist or not-exist, not-exist if arise suitable-not, thing-not-exist from thing arise suitable-not like, exist if what-also not-exist desire conflict, that by-means-of primordially-pure nature spontaneous-presence is, that expanse inside clear subtle wisdom primordial-resonance light-clear appearance subtle exist, inside clear subtle desire break end from liberate, thus limit-free self-arisen wisdom essence empty where-also not-established, nature clear appear manner not-cease, compassion understanding not-cease what-like-also arise base do is, base thing essence actual-state is"—if primordially pure isolated: body/wisdom arising is what? Basis primordially pure = nothing exists. If expanse gives rise: exist or not-exist? Not-exist cannot arise (like from non-thing); exist creates conflict with non-existence. Therefore: primordially pure IS nature spontaneous presence. Expanse inside: clear subtle wisdom, primordial resonance, light-clear appearance. Desire breaks/end liberates. Limit-free self-arisen wisdom: essence empty, not established anywhere. Nature: clear appearance not ceasing. Compassion: understanding not ceasing, whatever arises is base. Basis: essence actual state. This establishes *ka dag stong pa, lhun grub gsal ba*—primordially pure = empty; spontaneous presence = clear. Not two things, one ground with two aspects.>
