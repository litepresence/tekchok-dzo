<The progressive reconvergence (*bsdus*) statistics map the nine spaces onto the three series: *sems sde* into 5,000 named tantras; *klong sde* into 3,000 named tantras; *man ngag gi sde* into 12,000 named tantras. These enumerations encode pedagogical completeness, not literal bibliographic counts. The divisions—outer/inner/secret spaces, meditation with/without, fabricated liberation/settled liberation/precise liberation—demonstrate hermeneutical flexibility: same teachings viewed through different recognition modalities.>

[INSTRUCTION SERIES ORGANIZATION]

<The *man ngag gi sde* (instruction series) reconvergence into three spaces: play unceasing (*rol pa 'gag pa med pa*), mind not unliberated (*blo la ma grol ba med pa*), essence without good/bad (*ngo bo la bzang ngan med pa*). These characterize *man ngag* approach: pointing directly to spontaneous presence without structured meditation. The statistics (21,000 chapters, etc.) culminate in threefold classification of essential-point gathering/seeing/knowing—progressive recognition deepening.>
