<Introduction to the Five Lamps (*sgron ma lnga*): The text transitions from narrative to describing the "lamp of empty bindu" (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) appearing in the field (*yul*). This marks the shift from symbolic storytelling to direct pointing-out of recognition-devices. The Five Lamps are: far-reaching water lamp (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*), white drop lamp (*thig le dkar po'i sgron ma*), Kati crystal tube lamp (*ka ti shel gyi sgron ma*), naturally-arisen wisdom lamp (*rang byung ye shes kyi sgron ma*), and empty bindus lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*). Critical: These are *pratyakṣa*—direct perception entry points for recognizing *rig pa*, not physiological objects.>
