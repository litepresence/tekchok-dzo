<Days and time calculations: "Three days, three hundred and sixty" (*zhag gsum brgya drug cu*) continues life span calculations based on channel activity. "Third, wisdom and action winds definite conclusion three are" (*gsum pa ye shes dang las rlung nges pas mjug bsdu ba la gsum te*) begins summary of wisdom winds (*ye shes rlung*) vs action winds (*las rlung*). Wisdom winds support recognition and clarity; action winds support worldly activity. The practitioner learns to distinguish and direct each. This is advanced practice—balancing transcendent and mundane without confusion. Completion stage mastery includes both dimensions.>
