[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<The progressive degradation narrative—radiant egg-birth (*'od kyi sgo nga*), self-grown grain consumption (*ma rmos rang 'khrungs*), sexual differentiation emergence—presents standard Buddhist anthropology from *Aggañña Sutta*. The ten-year lifespan minimum with weapon-disease-famine kalpas operates within causal vehicle moral causation framework.>
