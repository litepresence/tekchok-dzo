[DEGRADATION OF GOLDEN AGE]

<Buddhist cosmological narrative of human devolution from radiance to materiality. Lines 1370-1371: "one to one look and touch and laugh desire arose and beings also womb from born from many increased"—sexual differentiation emergence: beings look, touch, laugh, desire arises. Womb-born (*mngal skyes*) reproduction begins, population increases. "this time at light self-clear merely to food clothes tree on enjoy and desire-satisfying cow and sensible horse also exist"—light still self-clear (*rang gsal*), food/clothes from trees, desire-satisfying cow (*'dod 'jo'i ba*), sensible horse (*cang shes kyi rta*)—mythical creatures of golden age. Lines 1372-1377: Merit decreases (*bsod nams bri*), affliction-anger arises (*nyon mongs zhe sdang byung*), killing action (*gsod pa'i las*) submerges previous qualities. Light dims, form/vitality/youth not beautiful. Progressive degradation: sexual desire → greed → violence → loss of luminosity. This is *'jig rten chags tshul* (world formation) from *Aggañña Sutta* (DN 27), not Dzogchen view.>

[ORIGIN OF AGRICULTURE AND CELESTIAL BODIES]

<Lines 1378-1379: "that from long after human some earth essence that when desire merely to not-taken day and month and year storing did all by-means-of that good said imitate from evening from, between there famine and darkness time year many arose"—humans store earth essence (*sa'i snying po*) when unharvested, calling it good. Imitation leads to hoarding. Famine (*mu ge*) and darkness (*mun pa*) kalpas arise. Lines 1380-1386: "that from beings common merit from sky in sun arisen light arisen, here near here far said not-sit by-means-of, sun named near benefit-doing name famous, that from that set and night named, darkness cleared hope from, moon also that with similar arisen from, this also that companion sit said moon famous"—from common merit, sun arises in sky. Called "near" (*nye ba*) because benefit-doing; "that set" (*de nub*) → night. Moon arises similarly, called "companion" (*grogs*). Etymological explanations (*byung tshul*) for sun/moon names. Lines 1387-1392: Moon waxes full with heat; beings wish to cool; heat lost, coolness becomes torment. Saying "not cool" causes waxing/waning. Self-grown grain (*ma rmos rang 'khrungs*)—Sālu rice field: day-seed grows day, evening-seed grows evening. Food enjoyed. This is mythological etiology: human action (wishing) shapes celestial behavior.>

[PROGRESSIVE DEVOLUTION TO PRESENT AGE]

<Continuation of degradation narrative (lines 1393-1420 in Tibetan source). The pattern continues: agriculture → property → social classes → conflict → shorter lifespans. Ten-year lifespan minimum (*mi lo bcu pa*) reached when weapon-disease-famine kalpas (*mtshon nad mu ge'i bskal pa*) dominate. The narrative inverts Vedic cosmic optimism (golden age to present) with Buddhist pessimism (luminous origin to degraded present)—but with soteriological twist: present age is *easier* for liberation because suffering motivates practice. Lines 1415-1420 (from adjacent page): "then excessive desire karma produces pretas, excessive delusion matures animals"—psychological etiology of lower realms. Desire (*'dod chags*) → preta (unsatisfied craving); delusion (*gti mug*) → animal (instinctual confusion). Not punishment but natural maturation (*smin pa*) of mental states. Cosmological narrative serves moral pedagogy: understand origin to understand present condition; understand present to motivate liberation.>

[RISK: LITERAL HISTORICISM]

<The degradation narrative presents multiple risks:
1. **Historical literalism**: Taking radiance → sexuality → agriculture → war as literal history rather than psychological allegory
2. **Primitivism**: Romanticizing pre-agricultural existence as spiritually superior
3. **Misanthropy**: Viewing present age as irredeemably degraded
4. **Determinism**: Fatalistic acceptance of violence/disease as inevitable

Actual meaning: The narrative encodes *rnam smin* (maturation)—how consciousness condenses from light to matter through increasing fixation. The "luminous beings" (*'od kyi skye gnas*) are mind in subtle state; "womb-born" is coarse embodiment. Not historical decline but pedagogical demonstration: samsara is *snying po med pa* (essenceless), whatever its form.

Dzogchen view: The "original luminosity" is *ye nas yod* (primordially present), not lost in past but unrecognized now. Degradation is *snang tshul* (appearance-mode), not *ngo bo* (essence). Essence remains *ka dag* (primordially pure) throughout all epochs. Recognition transcends historical narrative entirely.>
