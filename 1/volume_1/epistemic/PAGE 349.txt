<Wind gathering dynamics: "Wrapping flesh" (*grim sha*) and "its gathering making form small and power weak" (*de'i sdud pa las gzugs chung zhing stobs zhan par byed*) describe how wind patterns shape physical form. This is *rlung* (wind) technology—understanding how energetic flows manifest as embodiment. The text systematically correlates wind states with physical and mental characteristics: contracted winds → small form, weak power; expanded winds → large form, strong power. These are phenomenological observations from contemplative practice, not physiological measurements. The practitioner learns to recognize and adjust their energetic configuration through breath and visualization practices.>
