<Increasing location preparation: "Preparing the location of increase" (*spel ba'i gnas sbyor bar byed pa'o*) describes setting up conditions for bindu multiplication and vitality enhancement. The text describes right-side (*g.yas*) characteristics: "if on right, many thoughts" (*g.yas su yon rtog pa mang*)—the right channel (*ro ma*) associated with conceptual activity. This is subtle body psychology—different channels correlate with different mental states. The practitioner learns to identify which channel is active and apply appropriate techniques. Right channel dominance requires different approach than left channel dominance. This is personalized technology, not one-size-fits-all.>
