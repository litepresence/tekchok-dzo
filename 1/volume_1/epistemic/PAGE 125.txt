[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RAINBOW BODY FRUITION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: ULTIMATE MANIFESTATION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON DEFINITIVE]

This section presents the rainbow body ('ja' lus) as the ultimate fruition of Dzogchen practice—the complete dissolution of the material body into light at the time of death. From the Dzogchen perspective, the rainbow body is not a miraculous achievement but the natural result of complete recognition of primordial purity.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding the rainbow body. The material body is the condensation of the subtle elements that appear due to delusion. When delusion is completely dissolved through recognition, the elements return to their natural state as light. The rainbow body is this natural dissolution.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the rainbow body as the ultimate sign of complete realization. It demonstrates that the material world is the display of awareness, not substantial reality. The practitioner's body dissolves into the five-colored light of the five wisdoms, leaving only hair and nails.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in the rainbow body is the recognition that while conventionally we see a physical body dissolve (conventional), ultimately there was never a physical body—only the display of awareness (ultimate). The dissolution reveals the truth that was always present.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the rainbow body as the sign of complete recognition. Lesser degrees of realization produce the body of light ('od lus) where the body becomes light but doesn't fully dissolve, or the eternal body (phung po lus) where realization is complete but the body remains.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to achieve rainbow body through thodgal practice. The four visions progressively purify the elements until only light remains. The practice of togal creates the conditions for this dissolution at death.

The section discusses the relationship between trekcho and thodgal in achieving rainbow body. Trekcho establishes the recognition of primordial purity; thodgal manifests this as light. Both are necessary for complete realization culminating in rainbow body.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for rainbow body, recognizing it as the definitive sign of complete realization. While other vehicles may doubt or misunderstand this phenomenon, Dzogchen recognizes it as the natural expression of primordial purity fully realized.

The section thus presents rainbow body as the ultimate fruition of Dzogchen practice—the complete dissolution of delusion into the light of primordial awareness, demonstrating the truth of the natural state.
