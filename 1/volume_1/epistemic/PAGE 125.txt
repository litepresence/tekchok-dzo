[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[ORDER SECTIONS 5-8]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Order sections continued: (5) Proficient ritual tantra—*Klong drug pa* as closed door preventing deviation; (6) Three intent self-abiding tantras—*Yi ge med pa*, *Rig pa rang grol*, *Rang shar* as seeing eye for recognizing dharmatā; (7) Word meaning tantra—*Rig pa rang shar* showing meaning-letter relations; (8) Word meaning essence—*Sgra thal 'gyur* as general dharmatā, *Dbyings rig 'dus pa* as specific appearances, *Thal 'gyur* as resolving doubts. The metaphors (seed without flower, harvest without fruit, blind person) indicate necessity of complete curriculum—philosophically each element is complete (*ye rdzogs*), pedagogically they function sequentially.>
