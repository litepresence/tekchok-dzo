[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Nature (*rang bzhin*) free of conceptual grasping (*rnam rtog gzung zad pa*), characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) free of dualistic identification (*gnyis med ngos gzung dang bral ba*)—this describes *klong* (space/expanse) as unobstructed openness. The two divisions into words for the distracted (*glen pa yengs la bor ba'i kha gtam*) and words when circumstances strike (*khar phog dus med pa'i kha gtam*) represent pedagogical responsiveness (*'dul bya'i dbang gis*), not doctrinal positions. The phrase *chos nyid khungs nas gdon pa* (extracting dharmatā from source) is pointing-out instruction, not philosophical extraction.>

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<The essential points (*gnad*) of channels/winds (*rtsa rlung*)—root essential-point wind abiding, body-essential-point wind, distraction-essential-point self-liberation—are *lam* (path) instructions within *klong sde* framework. The phrase *rang sems brtson du zin pa'i man ngag* (instruction of mind seized by diligence) indicates these are methods for those needing progressive approach. The vast expanse (*dbyings rgya che ba*) perspective as *gang yang ma shong ba med* (nothing not accommodated) is *chos dbyings* (dharmadhātu) inclusivity, not philosophical omniscience.>

[TEXTUAL LINEAGE ASSERTION]

<The *rgyud rang gzhung gi man ngag* (tantra self-text instruction) as source of all teachings (*bka' thams cad kyi byung khungs*) establishes Nyingma textual authority. The phrase *chos nyid yid dpyod du gdeng 'tshar ba* (dharmatā intellectually determined) contrasts lower vehicles with this text's direct perception (*mngon sum*). The self-liberation of appearance-conditions (*snang rkyen rang grol*) means conditions are not obstacles to recognition but its very display—this is definitive Dzogchen view.>
