<Movement and illness: "Movement" (*sgul skyod*) and "illness" (*na ba*) describe wind dysfunctions—too much or too little movement creates disease. This is subtle body pathology: energetic imbalances manifest as physical symptoms. The text serves dual function—spiritual technology and medical knowledge. Tibetan medicine (*gso ba rig pa*) and tantra share subtle body framework; physicians and yogins study similar channel-wind-bindu dynamics. The diagnostic principle: observe symptoms, trace to energetic root, apply remedy. Whether medical or spiritual, the approach is systematic and empirical—based on observation and results.>
