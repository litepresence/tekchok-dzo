[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[SUBTLE BODY AS SPONTANEOUS ENERGY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Subtle body from Dzogchen: channels are *rig pa*'s self-organizing display; winds are *rig pa*'s dynamic energy (*rtsal*); essences are *rig pa*'s natural luster. No need to manipulate—spontaneously perfect (*lhun grub*). The four visions (*snang ba bzhi*) of *thod rgal*—direct transcendence—show subtle body as self-liberated display. The central channel is *dbyings* (expanse); winds are *rtsal* (play); essences are *gdangs* (radiance). This reframes tantric subtle body anatomy as description of recognition's energetic dimension, not map to manipulate.>
