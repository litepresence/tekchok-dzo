<Body as vessel of wisdom extensively explained. Body's formation from channels, chakras, bindus—the physical basis. Wisdom's natural presence—not installed or infused but always abiding. The crucial point of their connection—recognition that body is wisdom's display, not container.>

<Channels as pathways, chakras as convergence points, bindus as essence—this is the energetic topology. Wisdom moves through these naturally, not forced or directed. When recognized, the whole structure is seen as awareness-mandala, not physical anatomy.>

<The body is not a prison for wisdom but wisdom's own expression. The mistake is seeing body as impure vessel holding pure wisdom. Correct view: body-wisdom nondual, appearance-emptiness inseparable. This is the meaning of vajra body—indestructible as awareness itself.>
