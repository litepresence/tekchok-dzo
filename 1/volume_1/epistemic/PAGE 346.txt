<Left channel characteristics: "If on left, always abiding in doubt and hesitation" (*g.yon du yon rtag tu the tshom dang yid gnyis la gnas*)—the left channel (*rkyang ma*) correlates with skeptical, doubtful mind. Sixth section on channels' essence (*drug pa rtsa de dag gi ngo bo*) introduces how each channel's nature (*ro ma'i ngo bo bde ba*) brings specific qualities. Right channel (*ro ma*) nature is bliss (*bde ba*) with special method (*thabs khyad par can*). These correlations allow practitioners to diagnose their energetic state and apply remedies. Channel imbalance manifests as psychological tendency; rebalancing channels transforms mind. This is subtle body psychotherapy—working with energy to transform consciousness.>
