[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND EXTREMES]
[NON-DUAL RECOGNITION]

<"Beyond extremes" (*mtha' las 'das pa*) defined as not holding all phenomena as self. "Beyond view" (*lta ba las 'das pa*) defined as inexpressible. These classifications (*rnam par dbye ba*) are like illusions and dreams—appearing as real yet unestablished, empty by nature, merely confused appearances of clear appearance. Mind-itself (*sems nyid*) arises from ignorance as self-arisen wisdom's nature, yet obscures as essence. When these confused appearances dawn as Buddha, called "stainless luminosity manifest."

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KARMIC DEPENDENCE]
[CAUSAL PROVISIONALITY]

<Karma and afflictions (*las dang nyon mongs*) produce nature depending on and abiding in their own face. These depend on incorrect conceptions (*tshul bzhin ma yin pa'i kun tu rtog pa*) of six or seven consciousness collections including alaya. This itself abides in self-arisen wisdom, mind's suchness, naturally pure nature—not abiding anywhere, called self-arisen wisdom. Citation from *Ratnagotravibhāga* (*rgyud bla ma*) on elements interdependence demonstrates karma and afflictions depend on incorrect mental engagement, which abides in pure mind-nature.

[KARMIC CLASSIFICATION]

<Threefold karma classification: white (*dkar ba*), black (*gnag pa*), mixed (*'dres ma*) OR meritorious (*bsod nams*), non-meritorious, unmoving (*mi g.yo ba*). Meritorious karma produces samsaric pleasant results (ten virtues, etc.). Non-meritorious: ten non-virtues, five immediate retributions. Unmoving: karma producing birth in upper realms, immovable because producing results in same category. Afflictions are six [root poisons].
