Presents Aspect 3: Compassion (*thugs rje*) as the unobstructed display (*snang ba*) of spontaneous presence. The Thalgyur tantra establishes non-arising and non-ceasing—neither produced nor stopped, beyond conceptual elaboration. The ground appears as various play (*rol pa*) yet is empty because not existing, appears because not empty: *snang stong 'jug pa* (appearance-emptiness interpenetration). This all-pervading compassion (*kun khyab thugs rje*) spontaneously arises (*shugs kyis 'char*) as knowing-awareness (*rig cing gsal ba*) without deliberate action, the dynamic force of self-rigpa's clarity.
