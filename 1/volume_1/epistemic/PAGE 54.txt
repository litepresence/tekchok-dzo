[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FACULTIES CLASSIFICATION]
[PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS]

<Classification of faculties (*dbang po*) into two: form-faculties (*gzugs kyi cha las byung ba'i dbang po*) and wisdom-faculties (*shes rab kyi cha las byung ba'i dbang po*). Six form-faculties correspond to six elements (earth, wind, water, fire, space, various aggregates). Six wisdom-faculties correspond to path-qualities (faith, diligence, mindfulness, near-recollection, prajña, mental pacification). This operates at [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] level as phenomenological description, not ultimate assertion.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SUBJECT-OBJECT STRUCTURE]
[COGNITIVE MAPPING]

<Analysis of object-subject (*yul dang yul can*) patterns. Objects (*yul*) divided into: apparent objects (*dngos po'i yul* = form, sound, smell, taste, phenomena, touch, four elements, various conditions) and emptiness-objects (*stong pa nyid kyi yul* = all emptinesses free from extreme grasping). Non-objects (*yul ma yin pa*) are those beyond extremes. Subject (*yul can*) is cognizer (*shes pa*) that either appears to objects while free from all extreme grasping, or does not appear to objects as supreme awareness beyond expression. [RISK: REIFICATION] of subject-object structure as ultimately existent.>
