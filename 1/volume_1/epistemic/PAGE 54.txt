[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RANG RGYAL THEG PA]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section examines the Pratyekabuddha vehicle (rang rgyal gyi theg pa), positioned between the Sravaka and Bodhisattva vehicles in the nine-yana schema. The Pratyekabuddha's philosophical achievement lies in realizing not only personal selflessness (gang zag gi bdag med) but also partial phenomenal selflessness (chos kyi bdag med phyed), specifically understanding that external phenomena lack inherent existence. However, they maintain a subtle grasping at the perceiving consciousness, failing to realize its empty nature.

The epistemic stratification here uses [PROVISIONAL MEANING] vs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] to distinguish the Pratyekabuddha's view from the full realization of emptiness. The text cites the Abhisamayalankara: "In order to abandon grasping at objects, but not to abandon grasping at subjects—the path of the rhinoceros-like [Pratyekabuddha] is known through condensed meaning." This demonstrates that the Pratyekabuddha vehicle represents an intermediate position, transcending the Sravaka's external realism while not yet reaching the Madhyamaka's thorough emptiness.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] transcends even this subtle dualism, recognizing that subject and object are equally the display of rig pa, neither truly existent nor truly non-existent. The Pratyekabuddha's meditation on dependent origination in reverse order (rten 'brel lugs bzlog) serves as a [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] that prepares the practitioner for deeper insights, yet remains a [PROVISIONAL VIEW] from the definitive perspective.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] applies here as well. The Pratyekabuddha's realization of external emptiness represents a deeper penetration of ultimate truth than the Sravaka achieves, but still falls short of the complete emptiness taught in the Great Vehicle and fully realized in Dzogchen.

The two types of Pratyekabuddhas—those who live in groups (tshogs spyod) like cranes, and solitary ones like rhinoceroses—represent different approaches to the same philosophical view. Both, however, are classified under [DRANG DON] in the Dzogchen hermeneutic, serving as gradual paths that ultimately lead to the recognition of rig pa beyond all conceptual frameworks. The Pratyekabuddha accumulates merit for a hundred great eons (bskal pa chen po brgyar tshogs bsags), demonstrating the gradual nature of this path.

The section illustrates the progressive refinement of view from Sravaka through Pratyekabuddha to Bodhisattva, each level dissolving more subtle levels of reification. Yet from the Dzogchen standpoint, even the most refined conceptual understanding remains provisional, pointing toward the non-conceptual recognition that transcends all philosophical positions.
