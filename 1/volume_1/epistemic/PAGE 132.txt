[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[STACKED LETTERS SYSTEM]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Ninth stacked letters (*brtsigs yig*) system: tantric symbolic correspondences for letter combinations. Each stack represents layered wisdom-manifestation. The *yi ge 'bru gsum* (three seed syllables)—oṃ, āḥ, hūṃ—as essence, nature, compassion; or body, speech, mind of all buddhas. Risk: Reifying stacks as ontological layers rather than pedagogical scaffolding. In tantra, stacked letters visualize complex mandala architecture; in Dzogchen, complexity resolves into single *rig pa*. The text maintains tantric framework while pointing beyond it.>
