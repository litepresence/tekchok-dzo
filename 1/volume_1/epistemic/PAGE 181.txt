[DZOGCHEN VIEW PROPER INTRODUCTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Dzogchen view proper: *Rdzogs pa chen po* (great perfection) as direct recognition of intrinsic perfection. Not achieved through practice but recognized as always present. The three principles (*gnad gsum*)—basis (*gzhi*), path (*lam*), result ('bras bu*)—are unity, not sequence. Basis is primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*); path is recognition (*rig pa*); result is exhaustion (*rang grol*) of all obscurations. This is definitive (*nges don*) view—beyond all vehicles (*theg pa*), beyond all practice (*bya rtsol*).>
