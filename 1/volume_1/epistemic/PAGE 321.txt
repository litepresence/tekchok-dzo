<Wisdom characteristics and bardo appearance: "Characteristics-grasping wisdom" (*mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i ye shes*) refers to the discriminating wisdom (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes*) manifesting when the body exists. The text describes how appearances (*snang ba*) shine forth from the basis (*gzhi*)—light and form bodies (*'od dang sku ris can*) manifest in the bardo (*bar do*). When absorbed into spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*), no established characteristics remain—this is primordial purity (*ka dag*) abiding in its own place. Tantric view: The subtle body structures continue into the bardo; completion stage mastery enables navigation of these intermediate states.>
