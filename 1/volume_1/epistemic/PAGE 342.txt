[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Body, speech, mind maturation: "That very purity maturing into body, speech, mind three" (*de nyid dag pas sku gsung thugs gsum du smin pa*) describes how purification of the three channels manifests as enlightened dimensions. This is tantric transformative logic—working with channels produces transformation. "Flesh radiant white, hair fine and yellow, body slender" (*sha mdangs dkar la skra li zhing ser la lus phra*) describes the physical signs of successful subtle body practice. Risk: Taking results-oriented descriptions as ontological claims. Dzogchen view: Nothing needs transformation; recognition reveals body, speech, mind were never impure. The practices are preparation for those not yet ready for direct recognition.>
