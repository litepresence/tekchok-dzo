[THREE KĀYAS AS INTRINSIC]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Three kāyas from Dzogchen: dharmakāya is *chos nyid*—emptiness-luminosity; saṃbhogakāya is *rang snang*—self-appearance of qualities; nirmāṇakāya is *thugs rje*—unceasing compassionate display. Not produced through practice but recognized as intrinsic. The phrase *ye nas rdzogs* (primordially perfect) indicates no production necessary. However, recognition may appear gradual (*rim gyis*)—this is *'bras bu* from perspective of those recognizing, not actual development. All pure qualities are *lhun grub*—spontaneously present, not manufactured.>
