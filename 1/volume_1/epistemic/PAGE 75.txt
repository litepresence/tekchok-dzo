[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The Pratyekabuddha realization—external apprehension-lessness (*phyi gzung ba med pa*), mirror-like insubstantiality (*gau brnyan lta bu*)—presents partial selflessness understanding. The *mNgon rtogs rgyan* citation establishes conventional authority. Risk: Stopping at philosophical realization without penetrating to awareness-nature.>
