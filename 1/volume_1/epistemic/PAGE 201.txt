<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*rigs bzhi* — four families, *sku bzhi* — four bodies, *pad+ma'i rigs* — lotus family, *dung can* — conch-possessed, *ri mo can* — line-marked, *har ti* — hariti)
- Hermeneutical precision: This section details tantric consort typology (*yum rtags*) as preparatory framework for *rdzogs rim* (completion stage) practices. The four families (*rigs bzhi*) correlate with four resultant bodies (*sku bzhi thob par nges*), indicating these are not static categories but recognition-contingencies. The meticulous physical characteristics (color, gait, voice, age) serve as *brda* (symbolic code) pointing to energetic compatibility rather than literal requirements.
- Temporal warnings: Ages specified (14, 15, 16, under 30) must not be read as statutory requirements but as indicators of energetic vitality (*srog rtsal*) appropriate for intensive practice.
- Ontological warnings: The families (*rigs*) are not essential identities but skillful means (*thabs*) for activating specific *rtsal* (potency). To reify these as fixed categories contradicts Dzogchen's view of spontaneous perfection (*lhun grub*).
- Pedagogical purpose: The text employs tantric methodology (*sngags lam*) as preparatory ground for recognition. The detailed diagnostics function as *sbyong byed* (purifying agent) for attachment to ordinary perception, ultimately pointing beyond all typology to *rig pa* (awareness) recognizing its own nature.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: REIFICATION] — Treating family characteristics as absolute requirements rather than provisional indicators. Antidote: These are *drang don* (provisional meaning) leading to *nges don* (definitive meaning) of non-dual awareness. [RISK: LITERALISM] — Interpreting physical descriptions as binding criteria rather than symbolic pointers to energetic qualities. Antidote: All characteristics ultimately point to *chos nyid* (dharmatā) beyond all characteristics.>

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*mtshan nyid* — characteristics, *brtag pa* — examination, *kha dog* — color, *'gros* — gait, *skad* — voice, *sbyor ba* — application)
- Hermeneutical precision: The fourfold examination (*rigs bzhi*) through color, gait, and voice represents tantric *rtags* (diagnostic marks) for determining energetic resonance (*sbyor ba*). The *mtshan nyid* (characteristics) are not ontological descriptors but functional indicators of *dbang* (empowerment) compatibility. The progression from Lotus (*pad+ma*) → Conch (*dung can*) → Line-marked (*ri mo can*) → Hariti (*har ti*) corresponds to ascending subtlety of *thugs rje* (compassion) manifestation.
- Temporal warnings: "Age fifteen" (*lo ni bco lnga nyid lon pa*) and similar specifications indicate developmental readiness, not chronological fixation.
- Ontological warnings: The emphasis on physical form risks reifying *gzugs* (form) as ultimately real. Dzogchen view requires recognizing all form as *rang snang* (self-appearance) of *rig pa*.
- Pedagogical purpose: These examinations train the practitioner in *shes rab* (discriminating wisdom) to recognize appropriate conditions. However, the ultimate teaching transcends all examination—*brtag par dka'* (difficult to examine) because *ka dag* (primordial purity) is beyond all *mtshan nyid*.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: REIFICATION] — Treating the four families as substantial categories rather than recognition-skills. [RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE] — Confusing these tantric diagnostics with Dzogchen's direct recognition (*ngo sprod*). The lower vehicles (*theg dman*) require such examination; Atiyoga recognizes directly without criteria.>

[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*byad* — face/form, *mdog* — color, *skra* — hair, *smin mtshams* — eyebrow interval, *dpa' rtul* — courage, *ngang pa'i 'gros* — goose gait)
- Hermeneutical precision: The detailed somatic specifications for each family constitute *phyag rgya* (mudra/seal) recognition in human form. The Lotus family (*pad+ma'i rigs*) characteristics—dark flesh color (*sha mdog smug*), soft yellow hair (*skra yi mdog ser li la 'jam*), unbroken eyebrow interval (*smin mtshams par yang ma chad*)—encode *thugs rje chen po* (great compassion) qualities. These are not aesthetic preferences but indicators of *rtsal* (dynamic potency) configuration.
- Temporal warnings: The age specifications (15, 16, 14 years) must be understood as energetic maturity markers, not legal requirements. [RISK: TEMPORALIZATION] — Reading these as fixed chronological constraints rather than indicators of *byang chub sems* (bodhicitta) ripeness.
- Ontological warnings: Physical characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) are *kun brtags* (conceptually constructed) and ultimately empty (*stong pa*). The text describes them as preparatory supports (*rten*) for recognition, not as ends in themselves.
- Pedagogical purpose: The exhaustive typology serves two functions: (1) training in *shes rab* (discriminating wisdom) to recognize suitable conditions, and (2) ultimately demonstrating that all such distinctions are *drang don* (provisional) pointing to the *nges don* (definitive) recognition that transcends all typology.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: REIFICATION] — Treating physical characteristics as possessing inherent significance rather than being conventional designations (*tha snyad*). The ultimate nature (*ngo bo*) of all beings is equally *ka dag* (primordially pure), regardless of physical form.>
