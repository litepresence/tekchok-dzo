[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<The Saṃbhogakāya field (*longs sku'i zhing khams*) as "five-family perfected retinue" (*rigs lnga phun sum tshogs pa'i 'khor*) operates at sems-side level, presenting visionary topology for practitioner recognition. The thirty-six activity classifications and five-syllable self-arisen letters represent preparatory framework within tantric-Dzogchen transition.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The Nirmāṇakāya field (*sprul sku'i zhing khams*) with twelve emanation deeds (*mdzad pa bcu gnyis*) and saha-world teaching activity employs tantric biographical framework. The three-kāya classification by teacher, place, and teaching follows Candrakīrti's triadic schema adapted for buddhology. Risk: Literalizing emanations as historical biography rather than recognition-display.>
