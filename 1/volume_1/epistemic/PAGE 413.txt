<Sixth: familiarization manner—holding the essential point through critical instructions. Releasing wind-mind into the life-force, gazing at the lamp.

<Seventh: measure—bindu small like sesame, light vast like sky. Eighth: abode—channels, chakras, body. Ninth: door—apertures of sense organs. Tenth: actual—direct experience beyond concept. Eleventh: similes—twelve comparisons pointing to recognition. All these support recognition; none are separate from awareness itself.>
