<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*phyag rgya gsum* — three mudras/seals, *phyag rgya chen po* — great seal, *bdag grol* — self-liberated, *gag* — block/obstruct, *phat* — seed syllable for opening, *byang chub sems* — bodhicitta)
- Hermeneutical precision: The "three struck seals" (*phyag rgya gsum gzhigs*)—lotus PHAT-blocking, vajra HRĪH-blocking, essence enjoyment—represent controlled opening/closing of energetic gateways. The PHAT syllable blocks (*gag*) lotus opening to prevent *rlung* dissipation; HRĪH blocks vajra opening to retain *byang sems*. These are energetic technologies, not magical incantations. The "self-liberated great seal" (*bdag grol phyag rgya chen po*) indicates transcending the deliberate sealing of lower practices.
- Temporal warnings: "Two times one arise" (*dus gnyis gcig tu skye*) indicates energetic simultaneity, not temporal sequence.
- Ontological warnings: The liberation (*grol ba*) described is not acquisition of freedom but recognition of primordial freedom (*gdod ma'i grol ba*). To practice liberation as achievement contradicts Dzogchen's view of *ka dag* (primordial purity).
- Pedagogical purpose: The technique teaches energetic containment and release. However, ultimate "self-liberation" (*bdag grol*) is recognition that nothing was ever bound—*ma bcos pa* (unfabricated) nature of *chos nyid*.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: LIBERATION REIFICATION] — Treating liberation as something to achieve rather than recognizing primordial freedom. [RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION] — Believing that PHAT/HRĪH blocking mechanically produces realization.>

[RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION]
[RISK: EXPERIENTIAL ATTACHMENT]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*sku gsum dag pa* — purifying three bodies, *rdo rje rtse mo* — vajra tip, *rked pa* — waist, *sems nyid* — mind itself, *bde ba* — bliss, *gsal stong* — clarity-emptiness)
- Hermeneutical precision: Advanced technique of drawing (*drangs pa*) essence from vajra tip through waist to root, generating three types of bliss: body-mind nondual bliss, wisdom seal bliss (*ye shes phyag rgya*), samaya seal bliss (*dam tshig phyag rgya*), and dharma seal bliss (*chos kyi phyag rgya*). The "three experiences" (*nyams gsum*) of bliss (*bde*), clarity (*gsal*), and emptiness (*stong*) constitute *las kyi phyag rgya* (action seal) recognition.
- Temporal warnings: The drawing-up technique is not temporal progression but energetic circulation.
- Ontological warnings: The three experiences are not ultimately distinct—they are *gcig dang du bral* (neither one nor many) appearances of *rig pa*. To deliberately cultivate them is *bya rtsol* (effort) approach.
- Pedagogical purpose: The technique provides tangible experience (*nyams*) as basis for recognition. However, ultimate recognition transcends all experience—including bliss, clarity, and emptiness.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: EXPERIENTIAL ATTACHMENT] — Becoming attached to bliss, clarity, or emptiness experiences as goals rather than recognizing them as *rig pa* display. [RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION] — Believing that drawing-up techniques cause realization rather than serve as conditions for recognition.>
