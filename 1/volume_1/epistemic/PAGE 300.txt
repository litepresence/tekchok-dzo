Completes six ignorances: definitely-placing mind (grasping-thought ignorance), artificial path ignorance (six minds gather obscuring wisdom path, mind not seeing wisdom), not-knowing confusion ignorance (not knowing self-appearance's light, again-again samsara). Thus six ignorances arise, not knowing wisdom-appearance. Sentient beings' delusion manner: first spontaneous self-arise from self-face not-knowing awareness; end delusion cease time, impure lineage cut stain—samsara's first-last, not Buddha's last. CITATION: Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury, spontaneous appearance manner door, samsara-nirvana divergence shown—section nine complete. Thus expanse-appearance liberation-delusion sequence shown; now delusion manner and reversal through symbols—eight parts.
