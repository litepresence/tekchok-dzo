[DZOGCHEN VIEW – OUTER VEHICLES SYNTHESIS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PROVISIONAL VIEW SYNTHESIS]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section synthesizes the three outer vehicles (phyi'i theg pa gsum), demonstrating how Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva vehicles form a progressive path of increasing philosophical sophistication and altruistic scope. From the Dzogchen perspective, these vehicles represent essential foundations that purify the coarsest levels of delusion while preparing the practitioner for the subtler tantric and Dzogchen teachings.

The epistemic framework here employs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] as the organizing principle. Each outer vehicle addresses specific aspects of delusion: the Sravaka dissolves attachment to a permanent self, the Pratyekabuddha extends this to external phenomena, and the Bodhisattva cultivates universal compassion while realizing the emptiness of all phenomena. Together they form a comprehensive training in ethics, concentration, and wisdom.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes these vehicles as necessary preparations rather than ultimate destinations. While each achieves its respective goal—liberation from samsara for Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas, full Buddhahood for Bodhisattvas—they remain within the domain of cause and effect, gradually accumulating merit and wisdom. Dzogchen introduces the recognition that enlightenment is already present, not a future result to be achieved.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is crucial here. The outer vehicles operate primarily at the level of conventional truth, purifying relative obscurations through ethical discipline, meditation, and philosophical analysis. The ultimate truth they approach—the emptiness of self and phenomena—is realized conceptually rather than directly.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] summarizes each vehicle's philosophical position: Sravaka asserts the non-existence of self while maintaining the existence of dharmas; Pratyekabuddha realizes the emptiness of external phenomena but retains subtle subject-object duality; Bodhisattva realizes the emptiness of all phenomena including the perceiving consciousness. This progression demonstrates the gradual refinement of view.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the practices: Sravaka meditates on the four foundations of mindfulness and sixteen aspects of the four truths; Pratyekabuddha meditates on dependent origination in reverse order; Bodhisattva cultivates the six perfections and ten stages. Each practice is appropriate to its respective view.

The section establishes that the outer vehicles, while profound, cannot fully realize the natural state (gnas lugs) because they remain within conceptual mind (yid). The direct recognition of rig pa requires methods that transcend conceptuality, which the inner vehicles provide.

The epistemic stance maintains [DRANG DON] for the outer vehicles, acknowledging their provisional nature while respecting their essential function. Without this foundation, the higher teachings would be mere intellectual entertainment rather than transformative wisdom. The practitioner must walk before running, purify the coarsest delusions before recognizing the subtlest.

The section thus serves as a bridge, acknowledging the value of gradual training while pointing toward the direct recognition that transcends all gradualism. The transition from outer to inner vehicles represents a shift from causal to result orientation, from accumulation to recognition.
