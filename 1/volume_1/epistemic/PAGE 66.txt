[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The heterodox conduct enumeration completion—wrong austerities (*log pa'i dka' thub*), this-world attachment (*'jig rten 'di la zhen pa*), debate-supremacy (*rtsod pa lhur len*)—presents standard Buddhist polemics against tīrthika practices. Operating within conventional hermeneutical framework to distinguish authentic Dharma from expedient customs. Risk: Treating polemical distinctions as sufficient without penetrating to awareness-nature recognition.>
