[1321-1340]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The thousand-petaled lotus birth narrative with sixty-four light rays (prophesying 64 Dzogchen doctrine categories) and seventeen ornaments (foretelling seventeen *upadeśa* tantras) employs sems-side visionary framework. The *sGra-thal-'gyur* citation as "first among all teachings" establishes Dzogchen scriptural primacy within pedagogical presentation. Risk: Literalizing prophecies as temporal predictions rather than symbolic encoding of recognition-topology.>
