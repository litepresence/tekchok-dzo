<Relationship to buddha-fields (*zhing khams*): dharmakāya as dharmadhātu, saṃbhogakāya as Akanṣṭha, nirmāṇakāya as various pure lands. But these are not locations—they are dimensions of awareness. To seek them elsewhere is to miss what is present.>

<Buddha-fields as aspects of awareness: dharmadhātu as empty essence, Akanṣṭha as clear nature, pure lands as compassionate display. Not places to be reborn through merit, but dimensions to be recognized through wisdom.>

[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The error of aspiring to be reborn in Sukhāvatī or other pure lands as escape from samsara. Correct view: pure lands are the nature of awareness; recognize this and you are already there. Not transportation but transformation of perception.>
