[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Dzogchen integration: "Form from one is body's limit" (*gzugs gcig las ni lus kyi mtha'*) references Vajra Peak Play (*rdo rje rtse mo rol pa*)—tantric source material. The text now integrates tantric subtle body completion with Dzogchen recognition. Key phrase: All manifestation dissolves into spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) where nothing is established—this is the Dzogchen view overriding tantric structure. The completion stage prepares the vessel; recognition fills it. Finality: No channels, winds, or bindus ultimately exist—they are upaya for those who need gradual preparation. Risk: Missing the Dzogchen integration and treating tantric structure as ontologically real.>
