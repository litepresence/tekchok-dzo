Presents repair methods for body samaya deterioration, including clay-body offerings (*lugs sku*) and vajra-bell offerings to the teacher. The prohibitions against despising one's body, siblings, parents, or other practitioners reflect conventional ethics. The identification of one's body as deity mandala (*lha yi dkyil 'khor*) serves as tantric transformation practice. These structures remain provisional for Dzogchen, where the body's true nature is already primordially pure (*ka dag*) spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*), beyond acceptance or rejection, requiring neither protection nor repair.
