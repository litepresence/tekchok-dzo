[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BASIS OF PURIFICATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PEDAGOGICAL STRUCTURE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]

This section analyzes the ground as the basis of purification (sbyang gzhi)—the primordially pure nature that appears impure due to temporary delusion. From the Dzogchen perspective, the concept of "basis of purification" is a pedagogical tool that reconciles the view of primordial purity with the experience of delusion and the need for practice.

The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. Provisionally, we speak of delusion obscuring the ground and practice purifying this obscuration. Definitively, the ground has never been obscured, and no purification actually occurs—all is the play of primordial purity itself.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the basis of purification is the same as the ground—primordially pure awareness. The "impurities" are temporary delusions that have no substantial existence. They are like clouds in the sky—appearing to obscure but never actually staining the sky's nature.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is crucial here. Conventionally, there are beings to be liberated, obscurations to be purified, and a path to be traversed. Ultimately, there are no beings, no obscurations, and no path—all are conceptual impositions on the natural state.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the relationship between ground and delusion. Delusion does not exist in the ground as an inherent stain; it arises as a temporary adventitious obscuration (glo bur gyi dri ma). Like clouds obscuring the sun, delusion appears to obscure awareness but cannot actually affect its nature.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how the concept of basis of purification guides practice. Recognizing that the nature is pure, one need not reject delusion but recognize its emptiness. Delusion is not an enemy to be destroyed but a temporary obscuration that dissolves when its nature is seen.

The section discusses the relationship between basis of purification (sbyang gzhi), that which purifies (sbyed byed), and the result of purification (sbyang 'bras). In Dzogchen, these three are inseparable—the ground purifies itself through recognition, and the result is the recognition of what was always present.

The epistemic stance maintains that while the framework of basis, purifier, and result is pedagogically useful, it is ultimately [PROVISIONAL MEANING]. The [DEFINITIVE MEANING] is that no purification ever occurs because nothing was ever impure.

The section thus presents the ground as basis of purification, showing how the view of primordial purity accommodates the need for practice without falling into nihilism or eternalism.
