[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[SEED SYLLABLE CORRESPONDENCES]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Vowel correspondences continued with symbolic meanings: *u* as five poisons self-liberated, *ū* as non-dual sphere (*thig le*), *e* as singular (*gcig pu*) awareness, *ai* as naturally clear, *o* as five wisdoms, *au* as spontaneously present, *aṃ* as unceasing, *aḥ* as cutting extremes. These are tantric *thabs* (means)—using sound-structure to point to recognition. The Wylie precision (*dbyangs yig*, *gzhung yig*) maintains technical accuracy. In Dzogchen view, these are spontaneous sound (*rang sgra*), not constructed correspondences; in tantra, they are constructed means leading to spontaneous recognition.>
