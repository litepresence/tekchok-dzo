[WISDOM-KNOWLEDGE DETAILED]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Wisdom-knowledge empowerment detailed: Four joys (*dga' ba bzhi*)—joy (*dga' ba*), supreme joy (*mchog dga'*), joy of cessation (*dga' bral*), coemergent joy (*lhan cig skyes pa'i dga' ba*). These map onto four emptinesses (*stong pa bzhi*)—emptiness, very empty, great empty, all empty. The progression from fabricated to coemergent indicates tantric logic: deliberate cultivation leading to spontaneous recognition. Coemergent joy is closest to Dzogchen—simultaneous (*gcig char*) appearance of bliss and emptiness without sequential cultivation.>
