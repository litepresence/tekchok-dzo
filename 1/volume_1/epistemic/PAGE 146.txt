[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CONFIDENCE AND CERTAINTY]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE ATTITUDE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the importance of confidence (gdeng) and certainty (nges shes) in Dzogchen practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, without confidence in the natural state and certainty about the view, recognition cannot stabilize.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding confidence. Confidence is not blind faith but the certainty that comes from direct recognition. When one recognizes the natural state, confidence arises naturally—it is not something to be manufactured.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes three types of confidence: confidence in the ground, confidence in the path, and confidence in the result. All three are aspects of the same certainty—the natural state is primordially pure, the path reveals this, the result is this recognition.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in confidence is the recognition that while conventionally we develop confidence through study and practice, ultimately confidence is the natural expression of recognition. It is not built but revealed.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes that confidence is essential for Dzogchen practice. Without confidence in the view, one falls into doubt and hesitation. With confidence, recognition naturally remains stable and continuous.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to develop confidence. Through direct introduction, study of authentic texts, and personal experience, confidence in the natural state grows. This confidence is not arrogance but the stability of recognition.

The section discusses the relationship between confidence and doubt. Doubt is the enemy of recognition; confidence is its support. Yet even doubt, when recognized as empty, becomes confidence. The natural state is beyond both.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for confidence, recognizing it as the natural expression of definitive view. While conventional study supports confidence, ultimate confidence comes from direct recognition.

The section thus establishes confidence and certainty as essential qualities of Dzogchen practice—the natural stability that arises when the view is recognized and maintained.
