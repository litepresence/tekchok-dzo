<Sems-side pedagogical narrative explaining samsaric emergence (*srid pa*) through symbolic language: "pig year" (*phag gi lo*) marks the moment of reifying ignorance (*ma rig pa*) as real; "star bird" (*skar ma bya*) represents attachment arising to objects; "wild-men" (*mi rgod*) embody the five poisons (*dug lnga*); "four friends" (*rogs mi bzhi*) indicate the four conditions (*rkyen bzhi*). These are contemplative metaphors, not historical or cosmological claims. The crucial phrase "delusion from first pure samsara-basis not-possess" (*'khrul pa de dang po ka dag 'khor gzhi med pa*) establishes that delusion never originated from primordially pure ground—recognition of this is liberation. Risk: Literalizing symbolic narrative as factual history.>
