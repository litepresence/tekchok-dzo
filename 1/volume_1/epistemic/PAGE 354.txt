<Ṭa and La vajra positions: "Ṭa and La are vajra, above and below" (*ṭa dang la ni rdo rje steng 'og na*) describes upper and lower energetic seals. These syllables mark critical junctures in the subtle body—Ṭa at the upper gateway, La at the lower. The 96 channel petals (*rtsa 'dab dgu bcu rtsa drug*) of the heart chakra are enumerated. This precise numerology serves contemplative functions: visualizing specific numbers of channels, winds, and bindus concentrates and directs awareness. The numbers are not arbitrary—they reflect harmonic relationships between body, cosmos, and consciousness. This is sacred geometry applied to embodiment.>
