[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[EXHAUSTION OF PHENOMENA]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Exhaustion (*zad pa*) of phenomena (*chos*): not destruction but self-exhaustion. Samsara exhausts itself when recognized as *rig pa*'s display. Nirvana exhausts itself when recognized as not separate from samsara. All views exhaust themselves, all practices exhaust themselves, all results exhaust themselves. This is *chos zad*—dharmas exhausted. What remains? *Rig pa* recognizing itself without reference, without ground, without path. This is Dzogchen culmination—not achievement but exhaustion of achievement.>
