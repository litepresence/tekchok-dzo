[BUDDHIST COSMOLOGY – DESIRE REALM GODS]

<Abhidharma classification of six desire-god races (*'dod lha rigs drug*), establishing conventional framework for understanding rebirth destinations. Lines 1269-1273: "Thab-bral" (*'thab bral*, Free from Conflict) gods—fallen from above (*gong ma las lhung*), free from conflict with asuras. Body four forearm-lengths (*rgyang grags bzhi*) = 375 bow-lengths; life span 200 human years = 1 day, 2,000 own years. Below: wish-fulfilling tree (*dpag bsam shing*) on adorned ground. This is *'phags pa'i bstan bcos* (noble treatise) cosmology, not Dzogchen view. The measurements (*dpag tshad*) and lifespans establish hierarchical scale of merit-based existence. Lines 1274-1277: Thirty-three gods (*sum cu rtsa gsum*)—fallen from Boundless Light (*mtha' bral*), with elephant Great Steadfast (*rab brtan*) having 32 golden heads and 1 turquoise head, exercising power. Thirty-three powers/activities. Body 2/4 forearms = 250 bow-lengths; life 100 human years = 1 day, 1,000 years. Lines 1278-1285: Below sun-moon-stars-constellation abode, Meru peak, Yoke-holder (*gdu bu can*) etc. Thirty-three expanded realms, Four Great King races (*rgyal chen ris bzhi*) born as lords of four continents, controlling and protecting. Body 1/4 forearm = 125 bow-lengths; life 50 human years = 1 day, 500 years. These are six desire-god races.>

[ASURAS AND HIERARCHICAL DEPENDENCE]

<Lines 1286-1292: Asuras (*lha ma yin*, non-gods) four races:
1. **Life-glory god type** (*tshe dpal lha'i rigs*)—equal to Thirty-three in body, life, enjoyment
2. **Power-great yakṣa type** (*stobs chen gnod sbyin gyi rigs*)—equal to Four Great Kings in body, life, enjoyment
3. **Killing-action rākṣasa type** (*gsod byed srin po'i rigs*)—equal to hungry ghosts (*yi dvags*)
4. **Cruel-mara demon type** (*rtsub 'gyur bdud kyi rigs*)—equal to Controlling-Magic (*gzhan 'phrul dbang byed*) in enjoyment

This establishes *mtshungs pa* (equal/similar) relationships between asura types and god/ghost classes. Cosmological hierarchy: merit determines rebirth destination, lifespan, body size. Risk: Taking cosmological hierarchy as Dzogchen view—actual Dzogchen view is that all realms are *rig pa'i snang ba* (awareness-display), equally empty. The detailed cosmology serves pedagogical purpose: establishing common ground with Abhidharma before introducing Dzogchen perspective. This is *thun mong gi ngag* (common speech) before *thun mong ma yin pa* (uncommon).>

[RISK: COSMOLOGICAL REIFICATION]

<The extensive measurements (bow-lengths, human-to-divine time ratios) present risk of literal interpretation. These are *thang shig* (pictorial) representations, not astronomical data. The Thirty-three gods' realm is not locatable on GPS; it's *snying po can gyi 'jig rten* (world of those with heart-essence)—those with recognition capacity. The cosmology encodes psychological states: gods = pleasure attachment, asuras = jealousy, desire realm = sense pleasure fixation. Longchenpa presents this conventionally (*tha snyad du*) before revealing definitive meaning. The asura classification by similarity (lines 1287-1292) shows all six realms interpenetrate—no absolute boundaries. This is *'khor ba* (samsara) topology: cyclic existence has structure but no essence. Recognition transcends all realms equally.>
