[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CAUSAL VEHICLES SYNTHESIS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: CAUSAL FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section synthesizes the three causal vehicles (rgyu'i theg pa gsum)—Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva—analyzing their common characteristics as vehicles that work through cause and effect. From the Dzogchen perspective, understanding the causal vehicles is essential for appreciating the unique approach of the result vehicles, particularly Atiyoga. The causal vehicles share the fundamental assumption that enlightenment is a result to be achieved through the accumulation of causes.

The epistemic framework here employs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] as the defining characteristic of causal vehicles. The Sravaka accumulates causes for liberation from samsara, the Pratyekabuddha accumulates causes for realization of emptiness, and the Bodhisattva accumulates causes for full Buddhahood. All three operate within the framework of dependent origination (rten 'brel), where effects arise from their appropriate causes.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the causal vehicles as necessary preparations for those who need gradual training. The purification of coarse obscurations, the cultivation of merit and wisdom, and the development of ethical discipline all create favorable conditions for the direct recognition of rig pa. However, Dzogchen points out that these vehicles cannot fully realize the natural state because they remain within conceptual mind.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is central to the causal vehicles' approach. They systematically analyze the conventional nature of phenomena—impermanence, suffering, no-self, and emptiness—as a means to approach ultimate truth. However, the ultimate truth they approach is conceptual rather than directly realized.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the causal vehicles' shared assumptions: enlightenment is a future result, it is achieved through practice, and it requires the elimination of obscurations and the accumulation of positive qualities. These assumptions are valid within their own framework but are transcended in the result vehicles.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the causal vehicles' characteristic practices: Sravaka's meditation on the four foundations of mindfulness and sixteen aspects of the four truths; Pratyekabuddha's meditation on dependent origination; Bodhisattva's cultivation of the six perfections and ten stages. Each practice is designed to produce its respective result through cause and effect.

The section emphasizes the progressive nature of the causal vehicles. The Sravaka achieves liberation from gross suffering, the Pratyekabuddha realizes partial emptiness, and the Bodhisattva approaches full Buddhahood. This progression prepares the practitioner for the result vehicles' more direct approach.

The epistemic stance maintains [DRANG DON] for the causal vehicles, recognizing their provisional nature while respecting their essential function. They purify the coarsest obscurations and establish the foundational understanding upon which higher vehicles build.

The section thus serves as a bridge between the detailed exposition of individual vehicles and the comprehensive framework that includes the result vehicles. The practitioner is reminded that while causal vehicles are necessary preparations, they are not the final destination—the direct recognition of the natural state awaits in Atiyoga.
