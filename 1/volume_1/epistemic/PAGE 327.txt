[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Karmic afflictions and pure lands: "Formations root and limb afflictions increase" (*'du byed las rtsa ba dang yan lag gi nyon mongs pa 'phel*) tracks how karmic patterns (*las*) embed in the subtle body. "Definitely establishing mind's mindfulness purified is space-wandering" (*nges par 'jog pa'i yi dran pa dag pas mkha' spyod*) indicates that purification of mental factors leads to *ḍākinī* realm attainment. The subtle body serves as the bridge between psychological and cosmological dimensions—purifying channels and winds transforms one's entire experiential world. This is tantric transformational logic, not Dzogchen spontaneous presence.>
