[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[BLISS-EMPTINESS INTEGRATION]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Bliss-emptiness (*bde stong*) integration in tantra: deliberately cultivating bliss (*bde ba*) to realize emptiness (*stong pa nyid*). The four joys (*dga' ba bzhi*) generate progressively subtler bliss states culminating in coemergent joy (*lhan skyes*). This is tantric method—using body's capacity for bliss to transcend ordinary perception. The union of bliss and emptiness is non-dual wisdom. In Dzogchen, bliss-emptiness is intrinsic—*rig pa*'s natural quality, not cultivated state. Tantra builds bridge to recognition; Dzogchen is recognition itself.>
