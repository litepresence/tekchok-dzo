[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: GURU REIFICATION]

<Transition to guru yoga (*bla ma'i rnal 'byor*)—union with guru principle. Critical risk: Literalizing guru as external theistic figure. In tantra, guru is embodiment of three kāyas (*sku gsum*)—dharmakāya as nature, saṃbhogakāya as qualities, nirmāṇakāya as form. Guru yoga unites practitioner with these principles. The guru is not person but recognition-source. Devotion (*mos gus*) is openness to recognition, not worship. Guru yoga is essential tantric method—outer guru points to inner guru (*rang gi bla ma*), which is *rig pa*.>
