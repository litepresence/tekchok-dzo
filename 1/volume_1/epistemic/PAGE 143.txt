[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[SECRET EMPOWERMENT - GSANG DBANG]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Second empowerment: Secret empowerment (*gsang dbang*) introduces subtle body (*rtsa rlung thig le*) practices. This authorizes completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) techniques involving channels (*rtsa*), winds (*rlung*), and essences (*thig le*). Critical risk: Taking subtle body as ontologically real rather than meditational framework. The *rtsa rlung* system is transformative technology, not physiological fact. In Dzogchen view, subtle body practices are *thabs* (means) for those needing structured approach; recognition transcends subtle body manipulation. Secret empowerment plants seeds for bliss-emptiness (*bde stong*) realization.>
