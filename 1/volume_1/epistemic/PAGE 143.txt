[DZOGCHEN VIEW – OBSCURATIONS AND PURIFICATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE DYNAMICS]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the Dzogchen understanding of obscurations (sgrib pa) and their purification—distinct from lower vehicles' approach. From the Dzogchen perspective, obscurations are temporary adventitious veils that have no substantial existence and are self-liberated through recognition.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding obscurations. Unlike lower vehicles that view obscurations as substantial stains to be gradually removed, Dzogchen recognizes them as empty displays of awareness. They cannot actually obscure the natural state.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes two types of obscurations: emotional obscurations (nyon sgrib) and cognitive obscurations (shes sgrib). Both are temporary and adventitious (glo bur), not inherent to the nature of mind. They dissolve when their nature is recognized.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in obscurations is the recognition that while conventionally we experience obscurations as real and powerful, ultimately they are empty and cannot affect the natural state. Purification is recognition, not removal.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: obscurations are self-liberated (rang grol) when their nature is recognized. They do not need to be removed through antidotes; recognizing their emptiness is sufficient.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how purification occurs in Dzogchen. When an obscuration arises, instead of applying an antidote, recognize its nature as awareness. This recognition is purification—obscuration and wisdom are not two.

The section discusses the relationship between Dzogchen purification and lower vehicle methods. While gradual methods emphasize antidotes and removal, Dzogchen emphasizes recognition and self-liberation. Both are valid; Dzogchen is more direct.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for Dzogchen purification, recognizing it as the definitive approach. While provisional methods work with obscurations as real, the ultimate truth is their emptiness and self-liberation.

The section thus establishes Dzogchen's unique approach to obscurations—not removal through effort but self-liberation through recognition of their nature as primordial purity.
