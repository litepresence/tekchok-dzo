[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The nature of awareness-essence abiding as primordial purity—sphere as fence when rigpa enters. Great self-relaxed meditation naturally descended. Spontaneously perfect light-display manifests house-like appearances in the sky—under-barrel, conch-shell, and various forms appearing in the expanse.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<These appearances are not external visions to be cultivated but the natural display of awareness itself. The bindu's light moves slightly—this is awareness knowing itself. Not wind-mind's movement but rigpa's self-radiance. Recognize this and you are liberated in the ground.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<For those who have not recognized, methods are taught—gazes, postures, breath. These are not the view but lead to the view. Once recognition dawns, methods are seen as descriptions of natural state. Do not mistake the finger for the moon, the path for the destination, the instruction for the realization.>
