[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

<The world-destruction sequence—seven suns (*nyi ma bdun*) burning, seven waters (*chu bdun*) dissolving, seven winds (*rlung bdun*) scattering—presents standard Buddhist eschatology. The nineteen intermediate aeons for beings' destruction and one for container destruction establishes conventional dissolution framework. Risk: Interpreting cosmic destruction as nihilistic void rather than recognition of impermanence (*mi rtag pa*) as nature of display.>
