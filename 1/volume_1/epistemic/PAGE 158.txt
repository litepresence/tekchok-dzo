[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[GURU YOGA AS DIRECT INTRODUCTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Guru yoga from Dzogchen perspective: guru is *rig pa*'s self-manifestation, not external entity. The guru's form is *rang snang* (self-appearance); guru's speech is *rang sgra* (self-sound); guru's mind is *rig pa* itself. Devotion is *rig pa* recognizing itself; blessing is *rig pa*'s natural radiance. This reframes guru yoga: not petitioning external being but recognizing intrinsic perfection. The dissolution phase is crucial—guru dissolves into light which merges with practitioner, showing non-duality. Guru yoga culminates in recognition that guru and self are *rig pa*'s indivisible display.>
