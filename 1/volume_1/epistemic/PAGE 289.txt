Details Samantabhadra's awakening: great collection completely complete, undefined non-awareness dawned, obscurations defeated at primordial time. Knowing self-appearance, non-awareness dawned; all afflictions dawned from that dawn. Merely then, self-abide quality manifests—body and wisdom Buddha. Base first-from liberate is rough; base from base-appearance arise time liberates. Not base-first liberate (would return), but complete-end spontaneous ground liberate. Self-face knowing time, space's quality completes; free from obscuration, result-liberation. Space's quality exists in awareness but non-manifest; complete-end time, Buddha's quality.
