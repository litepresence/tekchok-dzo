[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE EMANATIONS SELF-ARISEN]
[NON-MANUFACTURED MANIFESTATION]

<Twelve emanation-bodies' blessing self-arisen (*sprul sku bcu gnyis po'i byin rlabs las rang shar*)—body-form equal to beings' bodies (*sku gzugs 'gro ba'i lus bongs dang mnyam pa*), body-speech-mind emanations (*sku gsung thugs kyi sprul pa*) not made by anyone (*sus kyang ma byas pa*), fearless (*mi 'jigs pa*) through self-arisen blessing (*byin rlabs las rang shar*), immeasurable miracles and qualities (*rdzu 'phrul dang yon tan dpag tu med pa*), possessing activity liberating upon contact (*gang dang phrad pa 'byung ba rang dengs su grol bar byed pa'i 'phrin las*). This emphasizes *rang byung* (self-arisen) as intrinsic nature, not produced by causes.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE SUPPORTS]
[LIBERATION GATEWAYS]

<Three supports (*rten gsum*) for liberation: mind-support vajra (*thugs kyi rten rdo rje*)—from disease-free (*nad med pa*) to fulfilling desires and applying liberation (*'dod pa bskang zhing thar pa la sbyor ba*); speech-support self-arisen letter (*gsung gi rten rang byung gi yi ge*)—liberation through mere meeting and hearing sound (*phrad pa dang sgra thos pa tsam gyis grol ba*); body-support (*sku*)—liberating body into clear light upon contact (*gang dang phrad pa'i lus 'od gsal du grol ba*). These "supports" are recognition-conditions, not magical objects.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TEACHING CHRONOLOGY]
[PEDAGOGICAL TIME]

<Body-speech-mind teachings abide in different places by time—body-taming teaching (*sku'i 'dul ba'i bstan pa*) from Amitāyus to thousand Buddhas: 3 × 5,500 years = 16,500 years; speech-taming until 70-year lifespan: 5,500 years; mind-taming until 10-year lifespan: 5,500 years. Clarification (*dus ma yin gyi*): "not time but years for taming explained by those teachings"—pedagogical categories, not historical periods. The declining lifespan reflects *saddharma-vipralopa* (Dharma-decline) cosmology, not literal chronology.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TREASURE LOCATIONS]
[SACRED GEOGRAPHY]

<Body teaching time: vajra in Uḍḍiyāna land (*u rgyan gyi yul*) at salty-taste ocean island (*rgya mtsho lan tshwa'i ro dang ldan pa'i gling*), occasionally emanating light, sound, monk with miracles; letter in sky 500 leagues (*dpag tshad lnga brgya*) above Vajra-seat held by ḍākinīs; body abiding together (*lhan cig bzhugs*). These are *terma* (*gter ma*) locations—earthly (Uḍḍiyāna), aerial (sky), bridging both. Not static objects but dynamic manifestations when conditions ripen.>
