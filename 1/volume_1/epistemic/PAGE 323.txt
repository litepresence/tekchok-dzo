[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Gestational timeframes and elemental powers: Days 22-25 (*zhag nyer gnyis nas nyer lnga'i bar*) mark the period when individual elements' powers (*'byung ba so so'i nus pa*) establish the body's foundation (*lus kyi gzhi*). This tantric embryology tracks precise temporal sequences of elemental embodiment. The practitioner uses this knowledge to reverse-engineer the process through completion stage dissolution practices. Understanding the sequence of embodiment—space → wind → fire → water → earth—allows conscious reversal at death or in meditation. Critical: Temporal sequences are pedagogical tools, not biological claims. The point is recognition, not obstetric accuracy.>
