<The nature of the four appearances progressing further—object-wisdom (*yul gyi ye shes*) explained. From form and sound's distinctions, training experiences also become five.

Exhaustion of outflows (*zag pa zad*), not possessing defilement. Memory's source ceasing, essence clear. Clear awareness (*gsal rig*) not conceptualizing objects' extremes. Free from sound, true speech absent. All reference points exhausted. From *Thal 'gyur*: The sign-recognition of rigpa placed on the scale delivers dharmas to the place of exhaustion.>

From *Snying po'i mdo*: Within the bodies of all sentient beings, the tathāgatagarbha abides as it was in the beginning. From *Rgyud bla ma*: Perfect buddhahood's kāya radiates, suchness non-dual, possessing family—all embodied ones constantly possess buddha-nature.>
