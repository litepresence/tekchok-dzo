[MEANING VS. WORD TANTRA]

<The twofold division into meaning tantra (*don gyi rgyud*) and word tantra (*tshig gi rgyud*): meaning tantra as mind-essence naturally clear light free from conceptual affliction stains, universally abiding; word tantra as that indicated by names-words-letters-sections. This parallels *nges don* (definitive meaning) and *drang don* (provisional meaning) distinction applied to tantric corpus. The phrase *sems nyid rang bzhin gyis 'od gsal ba* (mind-essence naturally clear light) bridges tantric and Dzogchen view—clear light (*'od gsal*) as common terminology with different implications.>

[DEVELOPMENT/COMPLETION CRITERIA]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<The tenfold criteria (*ldang tshad*) for development stage (*bskyed rim*) prominence—ground/empowerment/samaya, deity/mantra, maṇḍala/offering, samādhi/conduct, activity/view—establish tantric classification system. The eightfold criteria for completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) prominence—view/result, conduct/meditation, mind/wisdom, experience/instruction. These are taxonomical tools for textual categorization, not practice prescriptions. The *zung 'jug gnyis su med pa* (union nonduality) requiring both sets (18 total) indicates analytic framework for classifying tantras by emphasis, not ontological claims about practice requirements.>
