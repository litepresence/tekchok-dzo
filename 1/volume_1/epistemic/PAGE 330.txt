<Five Lamps arising from elemental dissolution: "Abandoning the body's two wheels, wind scatters the gathered dharmas individually" (*lus kyi 'khor lo gnyis bor ba'i tshogs pa'i chos de dag rlung gis so sor gtor*) describes the fourth-day dissolution when winds disperse coagulated elements. From this arise the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*): far-reaching water lamp (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*), self-arisen wisdom lamp (*rang byung ye shes kyi sgron ma*), lamp of pure space (*dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma*), and lamp of empty bindus (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*). These are *pratyakṣa*—direct perception entry points appearing spontaneously when clarity-emptiness is recognized. Critical: Recognition-devices, not created through practice.>
