[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Elaboration on Five Lamps as recognition-anchors: The "daughter's marrow going into iron" (*bu ma'i snyegs mar la song yang bzung nas lcags su bcug*) continues symbolic narrative while simultaneously pointing to subtle body processes. The Yacha (*ya cha*) commentary explicitly links metaphor to meaning—demonstrating the text's dual function as both narrative and instruction. The lamps appear when clarity (*gsal ba*) and emptiness (*stong pa*) are recognized as inseparable. Tantric methodology: Use structured contemplation to arrive at unstructured recognition.>
