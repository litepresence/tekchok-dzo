[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GARLAND OF PEARLS NEGATIONS]
[CONCEPTUAL EXTREMES EXHAUSTED]

<Citation from *Mu tig phreng ba* (Garland of Pearls) continuing exhaustive negation. Lines 11022: "nature dwell-of essence-to"—negations applied to essence where nature dwells. Lines 11023-11042: Extended negation categories:

**Ontological pairs negated:**
- Buddha/sentient being (11023)
- Non-recognition/confusion (11024)
- Mind/mental factors (11025)
- Enemy/friend/relative (11026)
- Affliction/self-grasp (11027)
- Go/come (11028)

**Dharma categories negated:**
- Dharma/dharma-appearance (11029)
- Method/wisdom (11030)

**Abhidharma categories negated:**
- Aggregates/elements (11031)
- Object/grasped-object (11032)
- Sense-powers/objects (11033)
- Grasped-object/grasper (11034)
- Form/primordial wisdom (11035)

**Epistemological negations:**
- Knower/knowable master (11036)
- Light/color (11037)
- Sound/smell/etc. (11038)
- Desire/attachment (11039)

**Tantric categories negated:**
- Space/palace (11040)
- Deity/offering-object (11041)

The pattern: ALL dichotomies, ALL categories, ALL designations are negated. This is *mtha' bral* (free from extremes)—neither existence nor non-existence, neither samsara nor nirvana, neither dharma nor non-dharma.>

[DHARMATĀ PRIMORDIALLY PURE]

<Citation from *Klong drug pa* (Six Spaces). Lines 11044-11054: "elaboration free dharma-nature primordially-pure, own-face completely-pure essence-of base, that-to word and letter free, express by-means-of determine not able, superimpose term all free, grasp and grasp-of conceptualization not, Buddha not and sentient beings not, dharma not dharma-of concept not, what not what not what also not, that-like not-of essence-to"—*spros bral chos nyid ka dag, rang ngo rnam dag snying po'i gzhi, de la tshig dang yi ge dang bral, brjod byed nges par bya ba med, sgro 'dogs tha snyad thams cad dang bral, 'dzin dang 'dzin pa'i rtog pa med, sangs rgyas med sems can med, chos med chos kyi rtog pa med, ci med ci med ci yang med, de ltar med pa'i ngo bo ni*. Elaboration-free dharmatā primordially pure; own-face completely pure, essence of basis; free from words/letters; inexpressible, indeterminable; free from superimposition/terminology; no grasping/grasper conceptualization; no buddha/sentient being; no dharma/dharma-concept; no what/no what/no anything; such non-existent essence. This is *nges pa'i don* (definitive meaning) beyond all expression.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TANTRA WITHOUT LETTERS]
[COMPLETION THROUGH NON-CONCEPTUALITY]

<Citation from *Yi ge med pa'i rgyud* (Tantra Without Letters). Lines 11056-11076: Ninefold completion (*rdzogs*) through negation:
1. "I-to birth and death not cause, cease not dharma complete"—no birth/death, yet dharma complete without ceasing
2. "I-to outer and inner not cause, clear dharma complete"—no outer/inner, clear dharma complete
3. "I-to empty and existent not cause, appear dharma complete"—no empty/existent, appearing dharma complete
4. "I-to perceive-of object not cause, see dharma complete"—no perceptual object, seeing dharma complete
5. "I-to body and mind not cause, self-appear dharma complete"—no body/mind, self-appearing dharma complete
6. "I-to self and other not cause, awareness-of dharma five complete"—no self/other, five awareness dharmas complete
7. "I-to action-of cause not cause, meditation great complete"—no action cause, great meditation complete
8. "I-to gone-of object not cause, self-appear object complete"—no gone object, self-appearing object complete
9. "I-to direction and kind not cause, secret primordial-wisdom complete"—no direction/kind, secret primordial wisdom complete
10. "I-to appear cease not cause, space-of dharma three complete"—no appearing/ceasing, threefold space dharma complete

The paradox: negation leads to completion. "Not cause" (*rgyu med*) yet "complete" (*rdzogs*). This is *sgrub 'gag* (establishing-negation)—negating conceptuality establishes non-conceptual completion. Risk: Thinking negation is goal; actual goal is recognition beyond negation/affirmation.>
