[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

Continues Aspect 1 (Essence) with exhaustive negations from the Garland of Pearls (*mu tig phreng ba*) and Six Expanses (*klong drug pa*). Negates buddha and sentient being, aggregates and elements, sense-powers and objects, grasped and grasper, kayas and wisdoms. The primordially pure dharmata (*ka dag chos nyid*) is free from words and letters (*tshig dang yi ge bral*), conceptual imputation (*sgro 'dogs*), and terminology (*tha snyad*). This negation of all fabrications (*spros bral*) establishes the ground as completely pure own-face (*rang ngo rnam dag*), the essence of the base (*snying po'i gzhi*).
