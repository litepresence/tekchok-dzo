[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Direct recognition instruction: "The meaning of non-doing appearing instantaneously" (*ma byas pa'i don skad cig la 'char ba*) shifts from tantric methodology to Dzogchen direct introduction. This is *ngo sprod*—pointing out the nature of mind without gradual preparation. The text oscillates between method and recognition, requiring careful parsing. "Thoughts self-liberated is killing others' life" (*rtog tshogs rang grol du song ba gzhan gyi srog gcod pa*) uses provocative language to cut through conceptual grasping—meaning conceptual mind (*rtog pa*) kills the life of natural awareness. Declarative finality: Recognition is not achieved through practice but revealed when practice dissolves.>
