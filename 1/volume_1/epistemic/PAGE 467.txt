[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Dharmata exhaustion (ka dag) as ground-conveyance. The action-list (far-reaching lasso, fault-non-existent action abandon, dharmata mother engage, etc.) operates as direct pointing at effortless activity—not instruction to perform. "Samsara-nirvana two gathering place destroy" collapses distinction from rigpa side. "Who flower beautiful see / This dharmata direct go"—recognition-language, not achievement-language. Bindu description (space-extreme equal, horse-ear ten cut, sun-moon mandala clear) returns to contemplative support while undermining fixation on bindu. Epistemic stance: declarative finality with skillful means residue—risk of collapsing view into nihilism.>
