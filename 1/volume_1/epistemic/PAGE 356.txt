<Vital points third section: Third section particular vital points explanation (*gsum pa gnad bye brag tu bshad pa*) continues detailed node descriptions. These vital points (*gnad*) are where practitioner applies specific techniques: pressure, breath retention (*srog rtsol*), visualization, or mantra. Each point has precise location, associated channel, wind pattern, and bindu quality. Mastering these allows precise energetic intervention—dissolving blockages, redirecting flows, concentrating essence. This is tantric surgery at the energetic level. The precision protects against error; improper activation can cause physical or mental imbalance. Proper guidance (*bla ma*) is essential.>
