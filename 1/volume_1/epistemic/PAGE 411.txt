[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Fourth: nature—awareness-essence abiding as primordial purity, sphere as fence when rigpa enters. Great self-relaxed meditation's meaning naturally descends. Spontaneously perfect light-display manifests house-appearances in sky—under-barrel, various appearances arising.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<This is awareness's own display, not external visions. The bindu moves naturally, light radiates spontaneously, appearances self-arise and self-liberate. Do not try to hold or fix them. Do not try to create or avoid them. Simply recognize them as awareness's own face.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<For those still practicing, the instructions continue—how to gaze, how to hold the body, how to breathe. These are skillful means, not the ultimate view. Once recognition is stable, all methods are seen as the natural play of awareness. Until then, use them as a raft to cross the river, then leave them behind.>
