[SUBTLE BODY SYSTEMS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Subtle body (*rtsa rlung thig le*) systems detailed: channels (*rtsa*) as pathways, winds (*rlung*) as energy, essences (*thig le*) as consciousness-basis. Central channel (*dbu ma*), left (*ro ma*), right (*rkyang ma*) channels; five winds (*rlung lnga*); four wheels (*'khor lo bzhi*). Risk: Reifying subtle body as physiological reality rather than meditational framework. The subtle body is *thabs* (means)—construct for guiding energy and attention. In Dzogchen, subtle body is *rig pa*'s energetic display—natural (*rang byung*) rather than systematized. Both frameworks serve recognition; Dzogchen transcends system.>
