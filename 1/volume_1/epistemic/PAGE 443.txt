[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Three kāyas extensively explained. Dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya—these are not three separate bodies but three aspects of recognition-display. Tantric framework describes them as achieved through practice; Dzogchen view sees them as spontaneously present, recognized through pointing.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Dharmakāya: essence (*ngo bo*)—empty, unchanging, free from elaboration. Not produced, not ceasing, not dwelling in any extreme. This is awareness's empty nature, not a state to achieve but what is always present when obscuration dissolves.>

[18906-18930]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Saṃbhogakāya: enjoyment/communication (*longs spyod*)—the play of awareness, five lights, five wisdoms, unceasing display. Not separate from dharmakāya but its natural radiance. Enjoyment for whom? For pure assemblies—those who recognize awareness's nature.>
