<Eye clarity center generally Four Lamps all appear: "From eye clarity's center, generally Four Lamps all appearing" (*mig gi dangs ma'i dkyil las spyir sgron ma bzhi ka snang*)—Five Lamps appear naturally from eye's clear essence. This is *pratyakṣa* (direct perception)—not created through practice but recognized when conditions present. "Abiding in body time" (*lus la gnas dus*) describes how lamps manifest differently at different life stages or practice phases. The Four Lamps are always present; recognition of them varies. This prevents discouragement—practitioner may not see them yet, but they're not absent. Recognition ripens through practice, but lamps themselves are ever-present nature.>
