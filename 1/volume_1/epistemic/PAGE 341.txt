<Three main channels' nature: "Three main channels' nature generally shown" (*rtsa'i gtso mo gsum gyi rang bzhin spyir bstan pa*) systematically describes the central (*dbu ma*), right (*ro ma*), and left (*rkyang ma*) channels. "OṀ AḤ HUṀ abiding in those three" (*de gsum gyi nang na oM aH hUM gsum gnas*) maps the three vajra syllables onto the three channels—body, speech, mind dimensions of enlightened form. This is tantric sonic architecture: specific vibrations correlate with specific energetic pathways. The practitioner uses mantra recitation to activate and purify these channels. Critical: Energetic resonance patterns, not anatomical tubes.>
