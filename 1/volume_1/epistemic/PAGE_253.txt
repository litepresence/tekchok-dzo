[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-ASSERTIVE LIBERATION]
[SELF-ENLIGHTENED SELF-LIBERATED]

<Opening lines establish non-dual completion: "Self-enlightened self-liberated, trace without childlike, expression"—*rang sangs rang grol, rjes med du bu nu nu, phyod do do*. This is *dpe med* (incomparable), *rtsol med* (effortless), *bral ba* (liberated). Line 10363-10364: "Fixation without primordially-enlightened Samantabhadra's intention-to reached-by, phenomena exhausted primordially-exhausted great"—*gltad med ye sangs kun tu bzang po'i dgongs pa la sleb pas, chos zad ye zad chen po*. Reaching Samantabhadra's intention without fixation; great primordial exhaustion of phenomena. Lines 10365-10368: "Anyone samsara not experience, samsara primordially-exhausted, anyone pass not experience, nirvana primordially-liberated"—*su yang 'khor ma myong ste 'khor ba ye zad, su yang 'da' ma myong ste mya 'das ye grol*. No one experiences samsara (it's primordially exhausted); no one passes to nirvana (it's primordially liberated). This is *phyogs chod* (cutting directions)—neither samsara nor nirvana as real.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SUFFICIENCY PARADOX]
[ALL SUFFICIENT]

<Lines 10369-10379: Extended "sufficient-by" (*-pas chog*) litany: awareness-by sufficient, non-awareness-by sufficient, existence-by sufficient, non-existence-by sufficient, samsara-by sufficient, passing-by sufficient, good-by sufficient, bad-by sufficient, realization-by sufficient, non-realization-by sufficient. This is *tha snyad kun la btags chog*—all categories equally sufficient, equally insufficient. No distinction between opposites in Dzogchen view. Lines 10379-10393: "Phenomena existence not experience, anyone-by-means-of done not, done-to need not, non-existence-to mind fix not apply self-arisen"—phenomena not experienced as existent; not done by anyone; need not be done. Non-existence not fixated upon; self-arisen. Lines 10384-10392: "Trace dissolved, self-settled, wide-open, undecided decided, not-dissolved dissolved, not-vanished vanished, not-cleared cleared, not-taxed taxed-to arisen is, Great-Perfection primordially-liberated spontaneously-accomplished yoga called"—*rjes chag, rang bzhag, phyal ba, ma nges nges, ma bkag bkag, ma zad zad, ma sangs sangs, ma skyong skyong du byung*. All categories self-liberated. This is *rdzogs chen rang grol lhun grub kyi rnal 'byor*—Great Perfection self-liberated spontaneously accomplished yoga.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WITHOUT DOING]
[PARADOX OF PRACTICE]

<Lines 10394-10398: "Without-doing completed, without-going arrived, without-seeking found, without-accomplishing accomplished, without-abandoning purified"—*byed med rdzogs, song med sleb, tshol med rnyed, sgrub med grub, spangs med dag*. Paradoxical formulations: completion without doing, arrival without going, etc. Lines 10400-10405: "Guru holy's intention and equal, connection, karma completed, action without spontaneously-accomplished intention-to reached, Klong-chen Rab-'byams good now become, Ah la la"—*bla ma dam pa'i dgongs pa dang mnyam, 'brel, las rdzogs, bya med lhun grub kyi dgongs pa slebs, klong chen rab 'byams da legs gyur, a la la*. Equal to holy guru's intention; karma completed; reached spontaneously accomplished intention without action. Longchen Rabjampa's auspicious completion. "Ah la la"—expression of wonder (*ngams*). Lines 10406-10426: Extended critique: "Realization-by sufficient but effort need, place-by sufficient but who from free, heard but word-taste, understand but concept, realize but extent, meditate but mind-made, analyze but duality-grasp, accomplish but samsara"—sufficiency vs. effort paradox. "Still now dharmata's vast-expanse self where exist, samsara from prior-mixing one-by not-transcended student-to, natural Great-Perfection's karmic-connection one also come will, phenomena exhausted self's appearance-to looked-by, mind exhausted alone joy lost, action without dharmata's nature taken-by, hope-fear duality-grasp's defilement from liberated"—where does dharmata exist? Not transcended from samsara. Those with karmic connection will come. Phenomena exhausted looking at self-appearance; mind exhausted alone joy lost; hope-fear defilement liberated. Final lines: meditate-by sufficient, place-by sufficient, do-by sufficient, abandon-by sufficient—"this is fix-limit dharma non-existent self-to." *Gta' so'i chos med*—no fixed-limit dharma. This is the pinnacle: all sufficient because nothing to do; nothing to do because all already complete.>

[RISK: ANTI-NOMIAN MISREADING]

<This page presents extreme pedagogical danger. The "sufficient-by" litany and "without-doing" formulations can be read as:
1. **Anti-nomianism**: No practice needed, no ethics needed
2. **Nihilism**: Nothing exists, nothing matters
3. **Spiritual bypass**: Using "all sufficient" to avoid psychological work

**Context is crucial**: These lines appear AFTER extensive samaya commitments, guru yoga, and practice instructions (pages 240-252). The "sufficiency" is recognition (*rtogs pa*), not ignorance (*ma rtogs*).

**Proper understanding**: 
- "Without-doing" means without *contrived* effort, not without engagement
- "Sufficient" means recognition completes instantly, not that preparation is unnecessary
- "Exhausted" means empty of inherent existence, not non-existent

The final lines (10416-10426) explicitly address students who haven't transcended samsara—this is not universal license but recognition-context teaching. Risk of "sufficient" misreading: casualness, spiritual materialism, delusion-validation. The text balances: sufficiency for recognition, effort for preparation.>
