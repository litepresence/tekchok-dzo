[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<The three-thousand-world-system (*stong gsum gyi 'jig rten gyi khams*) completion with central Mount Meru (*ri rab*), surrounding mountain ranges, and cosmic ocean presents finalized Abhidharmic cosmology. The dimensional specifications (160,000 leagues height for Meru, four terraces) follow Vasubandhu's *Kośa* conventions.>

[RISK: SPATIAL REIFICATION]

<The Sahā world (*mi mjed kyi 'jig rten*) as thirteenth in the twenty-five stacked array transitions to Dzogchen reframing. The "basis-essence-flower-ornamented" (*gzhi snying po me tog gis brgyan pa*) terminology encodes recognition-topology, preparing for definitive view. Risk: Treating stacked cosmology as literal vertical spatial arrangement rather than multidimensional recognition-mandala.>
