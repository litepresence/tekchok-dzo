[SAMAYA BREAKAGE AND REPAIR]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Samaya breakage (*dam tshig nyams pa*) and repair (*gsos*) mechanisms. Breaking samaya means losing recognition-connection; repair means re-establishing recognition. Tantric methods for repair: confession (*bshags pa*), renewal (*gsar sgrub*), guru yoga. These are recognition-restoration, not guilt-alleviation. The severity of breakage depends on capacity—superior practitioners naturally repair through recognition; ordinary practitioners need deliberate methods. From Dzogchen view, samaya is never truly broken—*rig pa* is unceasing—but recognition can be obscured. Repair means re-recognition.>
