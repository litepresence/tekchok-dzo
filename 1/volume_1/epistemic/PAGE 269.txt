Concludes Aspect 1 (Essence) with the Self-Arisen (*rang shar*) tantra, establishing primordial purity as boundless wisdom (*rgya ma chad pa'i ye shes*), spontaneously accomplished buddhahood (*lhun gyis grub pa'i sangs rgyas*), and awareness free from extremes (*mtha' dang bral ba'i rig pa*). The text refutes (*bkag pa*) the nihilistic interpretation that *ka dag* means mere nothingness by affirming that primordial wisdom (*ye shes*) and light-appearance (*'od snang*) are present within purity. This transitions to Aspect 2: Nature (*rang bzhin*) as the spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) that is the place where kayas and wisdoms arise.
