[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RANGSHAR SYNTHESIS]
[REFUTATION OF NIHILISM]

<Citation from *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) transitioning from negation to positive characterization. Lines 11078-11080: "first-of base primordially-pure great that-to, thought not, non-recognition not, mind not, mental not, grasp not"—first, basis great primordially pure: no thought, no non-recognition, no mind, no mental factors, no grasping. Lines 11084-11100: Positive attributes: "extent not cut-of primordial-wisdom, spontaneous-by-means-of accomplish-of Buddha, elaboration and free-of dharma-nature, limit and free-of awareness, pure great-of appearance, direction fall not-of view dwell, that also vast, clear, not change, primordial-wisdom not cease, bindu variety-as spread, not established-of dharma-nature, outer extent not spread, inner primordial-wisdom-of light five not cease clear, form and primordial-wisdom-of essence-as dwell"—uncut extent of primordial wisdom; spontaneously accomplished Buddha; elaboration-free dharmatā; limit-free awareness; pure great appearance; view dwelling without falling to directions; vast, clear, unchanging; primordial wisdom not ceasing; bindu spreading as variety; dharmatā not established; outer extent not spreading; inner primordial wisdom's five lights clear and not ceasing; form and primordial wisdom dwelling as essence. This is crucial: **ka dag does not mean mere nothingness**. Lines 11100-11102: "this-by-means-of primordially-pure-to primordial-wisdom and light show cause, primordially-pure also not refute"—this shows primordial wisdom and light within primordial purity; primordially pure is not refuted (i.e., not mere negation). This counters nihilistic interpretation.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURE AS SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
[PLACE OF ARISE]

<Transition to Aspect 2: Nature (*rang bzhin*) as spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*). Lines 11103-11106: "second nature appearance part-from revert extensive explain, nature spontaneous-by-means-of accomplish-of state, India also not cut, direction any-to also not fall, form and primordial-wisdom arise-of place"—second, nature appearance extensively explained; spontaneously accomplished state; not cut off from India (all directions); doesn't fall to any direction; place where form and primordial wisdom arise. Lines 11107-11137: Detailed description of spontaneous presence: "inner clarity subtle exist and outer extent not spread, jewel casket-of meaning, spontaneous-accomplishment jewel-of cavity, youth vase form-of field light clarity thick arrange-of expanse"—inner subtle clarity exists; outer extent not spreading; jewel casket (*rin po che'i sgrom*) of meaning; spontaneous accomplishment jewel cavity; youth vase (*gzhon nu bum pa*) form field; light clarity thickly arranged expanse. Fivefold structures: "root life-wind five, form five, speech five, mind five, quality five, activity five, primordial-wisdom five, light five etcetera arise-of base, arise-of place, rely-of object, not exist-from beyond-of exist, outer not and inner-to clear, part subtle-to examine difficult"—five root life-winds, forms, speeches, minds, qualities, activities, primordial wisdoms, lights, etc. as arising basis, arising place, relying object. Existing from beyond non-existence; outer not, inner clear; subtle part difficult to examine. Lines 11125-11128: "base appearance arise-of form, path appearance arise-of base, effect-of appearance arise-of space, form-body and awareness arise-of expanse great-as dwell"—basis as form of arising appearance; basis as path of arising appearance; space as effect of arising appearance; form-body and awareness dwelling as great expanse. This is *lhun grub*—spontaneous presence as dynamic manifestation.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIX SPACES NATURE APPEARANCE]
[FIVE LIGHTS MANIFESTATION]

<Citation from *Klong drug pa* (Six Spaces) on nature appearance. Lines 11139-11180: "nature itself-of appearance-to, sign grasp primordially not, color not self clear cause, know and awareness-of parts only, grasp grasp object what not cause, conceptualization grasp part not, light-from beyond-of primordial-resound-as, primordially from distinction dwell, form-from beyond-of self-resound-as, completely-pure mudra great-as dwell, however nature appearance-to, sign perceive primordially not, meaning part this-like dwell"—nature's own appearance: no primordial grasping of signs; color not, self-clear cause; only parts of knowing/awareness; no grasper/grasped object; no conceptualization grasping parts; primordially resounding from beyond light; dwelling with distinction from primordial; self-resounding from beyond form; great completely pure mudra dwelling; however nature's appearance: no primordial perceiving of signs; meaning parts dwell thus. Lines 11152-11180: Five lights as spontaneous presence: "self-resound produce white part, depth clear great itself-as dwell, depth clear essence splendor produce, appearance self-dissolve yellow part, not manifest depth dwell own-face clear, own-face attachment not resound produce, self-by-means-of bind free of, attachment self-dissolve red part, depth resound not mix great-as dwell, not mix individual part grasp, action effort move self free of, action not green of, beginning those-of radiance also, not manifest depth-from clear part, depth clear pervade connection not, change not complete-of lapis-as, primordially complete make not dwell"—self-resounding producing white; depth-clear great dwelling; depth-clear essence producing splendor; appearance self-dissolving yellow; not-manifest depth dwelling, own-face clear; own-face without attachment resounding; self-bind free of attachment; red self-dissolving; depth resounding unmixed; individual parts not grasped; free of action/effort/movement; green not acting; beginning radiance; not-manifest from depth clear; depth-clear without pervading connection; unchanging complete lapis; primordially complete without making. This is *rang bzhin lhun grub*—nature as spontaneous presence, five lights manifesting without cause/condition.>
