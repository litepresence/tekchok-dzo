<The four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) classified, the text now establishes the nature of knowing (*shes pa'i rang bzhin*)—the crucial distinction between basis (*kun gzhi*) and dharmakāya (*chos sku*), mind (*sems*) and wisdom (*ye shes*). These distinctions are not ontological claims but recognition-criteria: when rigpa knows itself as its own object (*rang yul*), this is wisdom; when consciousness (*rnam shes*) grasps at appearances as other, this is mind. The *Thal 'gyur* citation establishes the decisive point.>

<Kun gzhi (ālaya) as characterized by ignorance (*ma rig pa*) serves as the first support, intermediate abode, and final home for all mind and mental factors (*sems dang sems byung*)—like a pond (*rdzing*) holding habitual tendencies (*bag chags*). This is provisional (*drang don*) description of deluded experience, not ultimate reality. Dharmakāya transcends mind and mental factors' objects, pure of all karma and traces—pointing to what remains when recognition occurs.>

<Kun gzhi appears as manifold (*du mar snang*)—various objects appearing as the perceived, six consciousnesses appearing as perceiver in the three realms, along with bodies, pleasure, pain, and mind's deluded aspects. Dharmakāya is the absence of all these, not cohabiting with conceptual mind (*yid*). From *Rang shar*: Kun gzhi holds conceptual thought (*rnam rtog*) as various deluded knowings; it is ignorance-thing itself, thus called kun gzhi. The basis of sentient beings and buddhas differs by only one distinction—recognition.>
