[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Transition to completion stage practices (*rdzogs rim*): Following narrative closure, the text shifts to systematic subtle body description. The "twenty-one adorned queens" (*btsun mo nyi shu rtsa gcig*) now explicitly correlate to the twenty-one thousand channels (*rtsa*) of the energetic body. This marks entry into the *rtsa rlung thig le* (channels, winds, essences) section—tantric completion stage methodology. Critical distinction: These practices prepare the practitioner for recognition but do not produce it. Dzogchen view holds that *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence) was never blocked; practice reveals what was always present. Risk: Confusing tantric method (*thabs*) with Dzogchen nature (*gnas lugs*).>
