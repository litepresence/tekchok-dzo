[CAUSE-EFFECT SIMULTANEITY PROBLEM]

<Critique of "cause-effect primordially spontaneously-accomplished" position. Lines 10552-10553: If cause and effect are both primordially spontaneously accomplished (*rgyu 'bras ye nas lhun grub*), then they exist simultaneously (*dus gcig*). This violates causal temporal sequence—cause must precede effect. Lines 10554-10558: If cause is samsara and effect is nirvana, and they are one (*gcig*), then samsara IS nirvana and nirvana IS samsana. But this means separation (*so so*) is impossible, contradicting distinction between pure (*dag*) and impure (*ma dag*). Lines 10559-10560: "pure impure exist cause clear, those and other also faults many not dwell"—the clear existence of pure/impure causes many other faults in this view. This is classic *dbu ma* (Madhyamaka) reasoning: reifying spontaneous presence as inherent characteristic creates logical contradictions with conventional causality.>

[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[SPONTANEOUS ACCOMPLISHMENT REFUTED]

<Citation from Six Spaces Tantra (10561-10562): spontaneous accomplishment as variety basis (*lhun grub sna tshogs gzhi*) is "truly not correct base" (*yang dag gzhi ma yin*). Lines 10563-10566: If this were the basis, sentient beings would not become liberated through effort (*'bad rtsol*)—liberation would already be accomplished. Line 10567: non-recognition (*ma rtogs*) itself obscures—the very condition preventing liberation is itself spontaneously accomplished, creating paradox. Lines 10568-10569: If awareness exists as cause of liberation, then effect (liberation) is also not accomplished spontaneously—contradicting premise. Lines 10570-10572: Charcoal analogy—just as black charcoal cannot become white through washing (color cannot change), if cause and effect are spontaneously accomplished as different, they cannot transform into each other. Lines 10573-10576: If cause-effect are one, effort is not needed for those sentient beings. Both alternatives (one/separate) lead to absurdity. This is *thal 'gyur* (prasaṅga) reasoning—reducing opponent's position to absurd consequences.>

[NATURE NOT DETERMINED]

<Lines 10577-10578: "Therefore spontaneous-accomplishment called base, meaning understand able not"—the term "spontaneous accomplishment" applied to basis is incomprehensible. Lines 10579-10584: Samantabhadra/bodhisattva dialogue cited—"as you understand like, this knowable dharmas only-from correct essence not"—knowable dharmas lack correct essence. This is *ye shes* (primordial wisdom) view that phenomena are empty of inherent nature. Lines 10585-10593: Second position refuted: "nature not established cause not determined" (*rang bzhin ma grub rgyu nges med*). From Mind Section (*Sems sde*): "not-determined name-of variety from, meaning also label only-by-means-of empty"—varieties of not-determined are merely labels, empty of meaning. Nature as one is not determined cause; whatever label, appears like that. This is *sems tsam* (Yogācāra) influenced view—nature is mentally imputed, not inherently existent. Lines 10594-10598: Final refutation: If one, contradiction; if nature not determined, then samsara-cause and nirvana-basis both unclear; if basis pure then impure not cause—alternation not determined contradicts cause. Complete logical closure showing all positions untenable.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SYNTHESIS]
[BEYOND REFUTATION]

<The extended refutation (pages 256-257) serves pedagogical purpose, not metaphysical denial. The Seven Spaces Tantra and Mind Section citations establish that basis transcends:
1. Spontaneous presence as inherent characteristic (refuted 10552-10576)
2. Nature as determinable entity (refuted 10585-10598)

But this is *sūtric provisional* critique of *reified* views, not denial of basis itself. The actual Dzogchen view: basis IS spontaneously present (*lhun grub*) AND primordially pure (*ka dag*) AND empty of inherent existence (*ngo bo nyid med*)—these are not contradictory but co-emergent aspects of single recognition. The refutation clears away conceptual fixation so recognition can occur without obstruction. Risk: Taking refutation as nihilistic denial—"nothing exists, nothing can be known." Actual meaning: nothing exists INHERENTLY, everything can be known through direct recognition (*rtogs pa*). The fault lies in reification, not in appearance. Lines 10567 is key: "non-recognition itself-by-means-of obscured cause"—the problem is not spontaneous presence but failure to recognize it. Recognition liberates; non-recognition obscures. Both are spontaneous, but recognition is key.>
