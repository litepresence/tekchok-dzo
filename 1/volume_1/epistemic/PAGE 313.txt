[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Integration of concentration and recognition: "One's own contemplation placed in that state recognizes the meaning of awareness" (*rang bsam bsam gtan gyi chus de'i ngang la bzhag pas rig pa'i don rtogs pa'o*) bridges tantric *bsam gtan* (concentration) with Dzogchen *rig pa* (awareness). This is crucial transition territory—the text uses tantric methodology while pointing to Dzogchen recognition. The phrase "without doing, one doesn't get it; by placing, one gets it" (*byas pas mi zin bzhag na zin pa*) articulates the non-doing of Dzogchen through the language of practice. Risk: View collapse—applying tantric logic (doing, achieving) to Dzogchen (non-doing, recognizing). The resolution: Practice as preparation, recognition as fruition.>
