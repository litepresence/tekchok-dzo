[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-APPEARANCE VS. COMMON APPEARANCE]
[CRITICAL DISTINCTION]

<Lines 11648-11654: "thus self self-to appearance this is-although, common agreeing world part common karma and, teacher activity-by arrange-in, self-to appearance although delusion-as appearance part self-appearance cyclic-existence door-by arrange that, self-appearance part bundle transfer time self-reverse-to go-in, common other face-to now fall-in exist-do, this two divide very important-is"—thus although this is self-appearance to self; common agreeing world part: common karma and teacher activity arranged; although self-appearance, that delusion-as appearance part: self-appearance arranged by samsara door; at time of bundle transfer, going self-reverse; now falling into common other face; this two division very important. **Crucial distinction**: self-appearance (*rang snang*) vs. common appearance (*mthun snang*). Self-appearance: private, mind's own display (like dream). Common appearance: shared, collective karma (like waking world). Lines 11655-11664: "nature awareness-to self-arise spontaneous-presence door-from six-realms appearance exist-therefore, deluded-appearance dream like primordial-purity ground-to appearance not-exist-as self-reverse-to send need-do point that is-in, bardo-in also self face six-realms-to self-appearance emanation-by benefit-do and, not-do part two-as explain-do is, impure cyclic-existence door not-manifest before self-appearance self face know-if benefit not-do that, action object not-appear because, manifest-from benefit need-do, deluded-appearance not-empty-if liberation not-able because, point this-also subtle very important one is"—therefore six realms' appearance exists from nature awareness self-arisen spontaneous presence door; the point is: deluded appearance like dream, as appearance not existing in primordial purity ground, needs to be sent self-reverse; also in bardo, self-appearance emanation benefits self-face to six realms; explaining as two not-doing parts; if knowing self-face of self-appearance before impure samsara door manifests, benefit not done because action object not appearing; benefit from manifestation; because if deluded appearance not empty, liberation not able; this point also very important subtle one. **Soteriological key**: deluded appearance must be recognized as empty (*stong*) to be liberated; if taken as real, bondage continues. Bardo (*bar do*) instruction: self-appearance can benefit if recognized; if not, falls into samsara.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FAULT QUALITY PROOFS]

First proof: if base not spontaneous, base-appearance meaningless; samsara/nirvana meaningless. Inner/outer space distinction: subtle mind space vs. coarse outer space. Compassion without cause from spontaneous self-resonance.>
