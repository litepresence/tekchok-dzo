Distinguishes individual appearances (*rang rang la snang ba*) from common shared world (*thun mong mthun pa'i 'jig rten*). The crucial point (*gnad*) is that deluded-appearance like dreams must be self-reversed into the ground of primordial purity where appearance is non-existent. In bardo, self-face's emanations either benefit or not in self-appearance's six realms. This distinction between self-appearance reversing to self-logic versus common appearance falling to others' faces is critically important. The natural spontaneous presence door gives rise to six realms' appearances.
