[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[FOUR EMPOWERMENTS INTRODUCTION]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: EMPOWERMENT MISUNDERSTANDING]

<Transition to four empowerments (*dbang bskur bzhi*)—vase (*bum dbang*), secret (*gsang dbang*), wisdom-knowledge (*shes rab ye shes kyi dbang*), word (*tshig dbang*). Critical risk: Taking empowerments as external conferral of power rather than revealing intrinsic nature. In tantra, empowerments *transform* by purifying obscurations and planting seeds (*sa bon*); in Dzogchen, they *introduce* intrinsic perfection. The text frames empowerments within tantric *upāya* (skillful means) logic—not ontological transmission but pedagogical authorization. Each empowerment has specific function in the transformative process.>
