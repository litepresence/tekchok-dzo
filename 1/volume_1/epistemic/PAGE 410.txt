[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Third: divisions—three: ground-abiding, path-display, fruition-object. Ground-abiding completely pure sphere lamp: wisdom and light-kāya spontaneously present inner-luminous in citadel. Path-display completely pure sphere lamp: five-rim fence surrounded, center possessing lotus-petal bindu's essence gathered.>

[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Fruition object-display completely pure sphere lamp holds snake-noose prisoner—five light nets and half-nets, under-barrel lines, etc. These are not future attainments but aspects of recognition already present. Ground is recognition of what is. Path is deepening that recognition. Fruition is full manifestation of what was always present.>

<From *Sgron ma 'bar ba* again: Divisions are three aspects—ground-abiding pure sphere's awareness-wisdom held as kāya, path-display sphere gathers rigpa's bindu-essence, object-display sphere holds that snake-noose prisoner. All these are its divisions. Do not see these as separate wisdoms but three ways of describing single awareness.>
