[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Gestational completion: "Generative action does" (*skyed pa'i las byed*) describes the maturation process where wind (*rlung*) and mind (*sems*) fully coagulate with gathered elements. The text has now described complete embryonic development from conception through elemental formation to full embodiment. This provides the foundation for understanding the subtle body (*lus phra mo*)—the template for completion stage practice. The tantric practitioner uses this knowledge to reverse the process: dissolving gross elements into subtle, subtle into very subtle, arriving at the clear light nature of mind. Critical distinction: Practice methodology, not Dzogchen view.>
