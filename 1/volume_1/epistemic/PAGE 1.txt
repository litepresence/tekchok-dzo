[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Title page operates from the definitive Dzogchen view. The Sanskrit-Tibetan titling protocol establishes the text's placement within the atiyoga tradition, not as provisional introduction but as direct pointing to the nature of the Great Perfection.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Prostration to Samantabhadra is framed as recognition of one's own mind-nature, not devotional plea to external deity. The language bridges ritual convention with direct view: "To Glorious Samantabhadra I prostrate" functions as both traditional homage and immediate pointing to rigpa.>

[12-27]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The fivefold homage structure operates from definitive Dzogchen view, describing the mandala of enlightenment as already-complete display rather than goal to achieve. Terms like "primordially pure" (*gdod nas rnam dag*) and "spontaneously accomplished" (*lhun gyis grub*) are not aspirational but descriptive of ground-state.>

[28-35]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE] → [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY] → [DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The three kāya classification begins from pedagogical sems-based entry (classifying through teacher/place/teaching) before shifting to direct rigpa-view. The explanation of "perfect place" (*gnas phun sum tshogs*) as "ground of dharmatā luminosity" marks the transition from instructional framework to definitive assertion of ground-nature.>
