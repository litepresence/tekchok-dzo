[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TITLE PROTOCOL]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Title page establishes *nges don* (definitive meaning) framing. The protocol "*theg mchog mdzod*" (Treasury of Supreme Vehicle) situates text within Atiyoga (*ati yoga*) as apex of nine vehicles—asserting direct recognition of awareness-nature (*rig pa*) over gradualist approaches. This is hermeneutical claim, not comparative evaluation.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MANDALA HOMAGE]
[PRIMORDIAL COMPLETENESS]

<Homage structure encodes *phun sum tshogs lnga* (five perfections) mapped onto *sku gsum* (three bodies) framework. The fivefold prostration (*phyag 'tshal*) traces Samantabhadra (*kun tu bzang po*) → Five Families (*rigs lnga*) → Ocean Teacher (*gang chen mtsho*) → Five Vidyādharas (*rig 'dzin rnam lnga*) → Three Worlds' Ornament (*'jig rten gsum gyi rgyan*). This is not historical lineage but *dbyings* (expanse) topology—each "level" is simultaneous aspect of single recognition.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GZHI CHARACTERIZATION]
[ONTOLOGICAL PRIMORDIALITY]

<Term *gdod nas rnam dag* (primordially pure) establishes ground (*gzhi*) as *spros kun zhi ba* (cessation of all elaborations) and *'dus ma byas* (uncompounded). The seven horses (*rta bdun*) metaphor references solar chariot—indicating *lhun grub* (spontaneous accomplishment) without causal dependence. Risk: Reifying "primordial" as temporal origin rather than timeless immediacy.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VEHICLE HIERARCHY]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL ASSERTION]

<Longchenpa establishes *theg pa* (vehicle) triad: causal vehicles (*rgyu 'bras theg pa*) → secret mantra (*gsang sngags*) → Atiyoga (*rdzogs pa chen po*). The phrase *de dag nang nas* (among these) frames Dzogchen as *rtse mo* (pinnacle)—not superiority claim but *ngo bo gcig* (single nature) recognition. *Mngon sum snying po* (direct essence) points to immediate *de kho na nyid* (suchness) without *bya rtsol* (effort/contrivance).>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE KĀYA CLASSIFICATION]
[PEDAGOGICAL TOPOLOGY]

<Three-kāya (*sku gsum*) framework classified by *ston pa* (teacher), *gnas* (place), and *bstan pa* (teaching)—the *Chandragomin*-style triad applied to buddhology. Dharmakāya (*chos sku*) as *bdud rtsi* (nectar) indicates nature as restorative essence. The *gnas phun sum tshogs* (perfect place) as *chos nyid 'od gsal gyi gzhi* (ground of dharmatā luminosity) uses genitive *gyi* to assert identity—ground IS luminosity, not possessing it.>
