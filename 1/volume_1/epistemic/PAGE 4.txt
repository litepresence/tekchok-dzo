[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PURE LAND ARCHITECTURE]
[SYMBOLIC COSMOLOGY]

<The elaborate maṇḍala description—mudra-jewel wheels (*phyag rgya rin po che'i 'khor lo*), five-family implements (*rigs lnga*), twenty-five fields (*zhing khams nyi shu rtsa lnga*) emerging from lotus pores (*padma 'khrungs pa*)—describes *longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku* (Saṃbhogakāya) as *rang snang* (self-appearance). The "stream of perfumed water" (*spos chu'i rgyun*) flowing from pores into great ocean (*gang chen mtsho*) symbolizes inexhaustible display (*mi zad pa*). This is not physical cosmography but recognition-topology.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BUDDHA-FIELD PERMEATION]
[OMNIPRESENCE AS DISPLAY]

<Buddhas as numerous as atoms (*rdul phra ba*) in elements (earth, water, fire, wind) pervading all places (*go thams cad*) describes *sku gsung thugs yon tan 'phrin las* (body, speech, mind, qualities, activities) as intrinsic display. "Sky wherever pervaded, that extent" (*nam mkhas gang du khyab pa de tsam du*) indicates *chos dbyings* (Dharmadhātu) as unbounded. This is not quantitative claim but qualitative assertion of recognition-nature's omnipresence. Risk: Literalizing as physical astronomy.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMANTABHADRA'S REALM]
[NON-DUAL SOURCE]

<The "single Samantabhadra's pure realm and activity" (*thog ma'i kun tu bzang po gcig gi gdul zhing dang mdzad pa*) asserts *gcig* (oneness) not as monotheism but as *ngo bo* (single nature). "Spontaneously manifesting Buddhas" (*rang bzhin lhun gyis grub pa'i sangs rgyas*) and "three kāya display" (*sku gsum gyi snang ba*) describe display-nature (*snang cha*) without external source. The *chos dbyings* as vast as sky (*nam mkha'i khams*)—immeasurable and without temporal origin (*thog ma med pa*).>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KĀYA CLASSIFICATION BY TIME]
[ATEMPORAL SIMULTANEITY]

<Three kāyas classified by "time" (*dus*): Dharmakāya (*chos sku*) as *'od gsal rdo rje snying po'i zhing khams* (luminous vajra-essence field); Saṃbhogakāya (*longs spyod rdzogs pa*) as *tshangs pa rnga sgra* (Brahma drum-sound field); Nirmāṇakāya (*sprul sku*) as *tshangs chen* (Great Brahma) or field. The temporal language (*dus na*) points to recognition-mode, not chronological sequence. All three are simultaneous aspects of single display.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION HIERARCHY]
[SKILLFUL MEANS STRUCTURE]

<Samantabhadra's emanations (*sprul pa*) and empowered Buddhas (*byin gyis brlabs pa'i sangs rgyas*) teaching in three times (*dus gsum*) describe *thabs* (skillful means) adapting to *gdul bya* (trainees). This is not creation-theology but display-diversity (*sna tshogs*) of single recognition. The "great training-field" (*gdul zhing shin tu rgya che ba*) indicates inexhaustible capacity of awareness to recognize itself through myriad forms.>
