[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

This passage operates within tantric cosmological discourse, presenting detailed mandala configurations, Buddha families, and pure field arrangements. The technical vocabulary (five families, five lights, three bodies) functions within tantric epistemology, where such categories are operative realities rather than mere symbols.

The enumeration of field characteristics — circular, four-cornered, crescent-shaped — and the assertion that "as far as space pervades, so bodies, speech, minds, qualities, and activities pervade" represent tantric claims about the structure of enlightened manifestation. These are definitive assertions within tantric hermeneutics.

Risk of reification is high if these configurations are read as ontological assertions about external locations rather than descriptions of the tantric practitioner's own mandala of experience.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

The shift to identifying all fields as Samantabhadra's single training-field reframes the tantric multiplicity through Dzogchen non-duality. The claim that "Buddhas pervade all" and "there is no before or after" operates from the perspective of timeless awareness. The three body-field classifications (Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya fields) function as upaya — expeditious framings that organize tantric material for Dzogchen hermeneutics.
