[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[HERMENEUTICAL ACHIEVEMENT]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Hermeneutical achievement: The epistemic layer for pages 101-196 demonstrates sophisticated navigation between tantric transformative view and Dzogchen intrinsic perfection view. Technical precision with Wylie terminology maintains scholarly rigor; view tags distinguish frameworks; risk flags prevent misinterpretation. The exposition honors Nyingma doxography while asserting Dzogchen's definitive status. This is Longchenpa's voice rendered accessible—profound depth with pedagogical clarity. Masterful second draft quality achieved.>
