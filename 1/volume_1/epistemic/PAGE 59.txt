[NIHILISTIC ERROR]

<Nihilist view (*chad par lta ba*): Lokāyata (*rgyang 'phan pa*) proponents hold that from present visible pleasure-pain and perceived existence, there is no previous-future life, no karma cause-effect, no liberation. [NIHILISTIC ERROR] denying continuity and causation.>

[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[CAUSE-NIHILISM]

<Two types: cause-nihilism (*rgyu chad par smra ba*) and result-nihilism. First: Cārvāka (*gcer bu pa*) and others hold prior mind is not present mind. Mind exists inherently in four elements; when elements expand-conceal becoming invisible, meeting moisture-heat conditions, latent mind awakens, enters new body, becomes sentient. Earth inherently possesses latent mind producing grass-trees; water produces moisture-movement-sound; fire burns-cooks; wind moves-lifts—this is the point. Thus wood, stone, all coarse objects have mind; when one strikes another, sound emerges, when thrown it moves; some trees close leaves at night, open by day; skin removed becomes dry; growing from moisture, etc. Therefore if prior life karma and mind exist in beings, trees would have prior lives too. No—it's adventitious, arising from present assembled collection like foam from beer. Proof: Summer heat-moisture gathering makes horse-hoof marks become water-filled; uneaten parts remain as horn. Ants and insects become bees; centipedes become frogs. Thus cause is not permanent; summer wooden sticks-stones and rice husks become sentient beings.
