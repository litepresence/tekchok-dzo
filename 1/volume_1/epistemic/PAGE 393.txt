[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Also from that itself continuation: "Also from that itself" (*yang de nyid las*) continues definitive exposition. This page likely completes previous discussion of purity and recognition. The text maintains Dzogchen view throughout—no reversion to lower views. The "that itself" (*de nyid*) refers to dharmatā, the nature of phenomena. All subsequent explanations unfold from this recognition. This is *don gyi nges pa* (definitive meaning)—not provisional (*drang don*) requiring interpretation. The text's structure itself embodies view: beginning, middle, and end all point to same recognition. No hierarchical progression toward truth; all equally expressions of truth.>
