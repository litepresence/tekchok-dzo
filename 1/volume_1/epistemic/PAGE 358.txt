<Directional burning and disease benefit: "This all-directions where burning" (*di kun phyogs ni gang na bsreg*) describes how specific channel work generates heat (*gtum mo*) that burns obstacles and diseases. "That benefits that disease" (*des ni de yi nad la phan*)—targeted energetic intervention for specific conditions. This is *tummo* technology—inner fire practice that generates bliss, purifies channels, and clears blockages. The practitioner learns to direct heat to specific locations for therapeutic or transformative purposes. This is advanced completion stage practice requiring stable foundation in channel and wind work.>
