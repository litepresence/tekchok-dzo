[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CAPACITY DIFFERENTIATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: ADAPTABLE PEDAGOGY]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section analyzes the three capacities (dbang po gsum)—inferior, average, and superior—and how the nine vehicles are designed to accommodate practitioners of each capacity. From the Dzogchen perspective, understanding capacity differentiation is essential for avoiding the errors of teaching beyond the student's ability or underestimating their potential.

The epistemic framework here employs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] as the organizing principle. Capacity is conventionally defined by the depth of obscurations, the degree of wisdom, and the ripeness of karma. Inferior capacity requires the gradual, structured approaches of causal vehicles. Average capacity can engage tantric methods. Superior capacity can recognize the natural state directly through Atiyoga.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that ultimately, capacity is not fixed but can be transformed. A practitioner of inferior capacity can, through practice and blessing, develop superior capacity. Conversely, a practitioner with superior faculties can fall into error if they lack proper guidance. Capacity is a conventional designation, not an ultimate limitation.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] applies to capacity as well. Conventionally, beings have different capacities requiring different methods. Ultimately, all beings possess the same Buddha-nature, and capacity differences are temporary obscurations to be purified.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes that the Buddha taught nine vehicles precisely because beings have nine types of capacity. The framework is not arbitrary but reflects the actual diversity of sentient beings' conditions. Each vehicle is the perfect medicine for a specific type of practitioner.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to assess one's own capacity and choose the appropriate vehicle. Honest self-assessment is crucial—pretending to higher capacity than one possesses leads to error, while underestimating one's capacity leads to unnecessary delay. The guidance of a qualified master is essential for this assessment.

The section emphasizes that in degenerate times, the Mengagde approach of Atiyoga is particularly appropriate. While earlier eras might have had many practitioners capable of elaborate generation stage practices, modern practitioners often benefit most from direct pointing-out instructions.

The epistemic stance maintains that while capacity assessment is important, it should not become a limitation. The Dzogchen view is that recognition is available to all, regardless of conventional capacity. The methods may vary, but the possibility of recognition is universal.

The section thus establishes the practical foundation for choosing among the nine vehicles, emphasizing that while Atiyoga is most direct, each practitioner must honestly assess their capacity and choose accordingly.
