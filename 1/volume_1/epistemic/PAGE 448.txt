[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The thirteen kāyas are not thirteen different bodies that a buddha possesses. They are thirteen aspects of single awareness-display, pedagogically distinguished for thorough understanding. To reify them as separate is to miss the point entirely.>

[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Crucial distinction: in sutra, kāya refers to the form body of the Buddha. In tantra, kāya refers to subtle body dimensions. In Dzogchen, kāya refers to awareness's display-aspects. The term evolves from physical to energetic to recognition-display.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The risk of taking "body" (*sku*) literally—thinking of buddhas as having physical bodies somewhere. Correct view: kāya is display-mode of awareness, not physical form. Even the nirmāṇakāya's apparent forms are awareness-display, not truly existent entities.>
