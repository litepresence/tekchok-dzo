<Empty trunks and vital syllables: "Mouth is empty trunk possessing two" (*kha ni sdong po gnyis su ldan*) describes channel openings as hollow structures. "From vital syllables" (*gnad kyi yi ge las*) indicates how specific seed syllables activate channel functions. This is *mantra* technology—sonic keys unlocking energetic potentials. Each syllable (A, OṀ, HUṀ, etc.) vibrates at frequency that resonates with specific channel, wind, or bindu. The practitioner recites while visualizing to create resonance between sound, awareness, and energetic structure. This is not symbolic—the syllables actually function as energetic catalysts when properly applied. Science of vibration and consciousness.>
