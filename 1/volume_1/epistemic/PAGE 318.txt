[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Elemental suffering and formation: "Merely entering the red fire pit experiences suffering" (*me dmar po'i 'obs su tshud pa tsam gyis sdug bsngal myong*) continues the dissolution sequence—fire element's heat, then water's clarity on the fifth day (*zhag lnga pa*). The text systematically tracks how elements transform from subtle to gross during gestation, and how they dissolve from gross to subtle at death. This mirrors the completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practice of dissolving the elements into the central channel (*dbu ma*). The practitioner learns to navigate these transitions consciously. Pedagogical structure: Understanding formation enables skillful dissolution.>
