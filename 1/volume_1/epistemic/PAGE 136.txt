[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[MANTRA CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL FRAMEWORK]

<Mantric vehicles (*sngags kyi theg pa*) classification: Nyingma six/seven vehicles with anuttara-yoga as highest tantric vehicle before Dzogchen. Anuttara subdivided into father (*pha rgyud*), mother (*ma rgyud*), nondual (*gnyis med*) tantras—emphasizing method, wisdom, or union. This is tantric doxography, not value hierarchy. From Dzogchen view (*rdzogs pa chen po*), all vehicles are *thabs* (means) pointing to *rig pa*—anuttara's completion (*rdzogs*) is preliminary to Dzogchen's perfection (*rdzogs chen*). The classification serves pedagogical clarity, not ontological stratification.>
