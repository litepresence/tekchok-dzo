[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[PHASES OF PRACTICE]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Tantric practice phases: preliminary practices (*sngon 'gro*), generation stage (*bskyed rim*), completion stage (*rdzogs rim*), great completion (*rdzogs pa chen po*). Progressively subtle—external to internal to secret to suchness. Each phase prepares for next through purification and accumulation. This is graduated path (*lam rim*) within tantra. Preliminaries create foundation; generation creates pure perception; completion transforms subtle body; great completion recognizes intrinsic perfection. The progression is skillful means (*thabs mkhas*), not ontological hierarchy.>
