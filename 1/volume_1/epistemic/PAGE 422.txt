<Path-arising wisdom: five wisdoms and five kāyas, wind and knowing's display also five—all five-five's nature. Five lights' increase-decrease ceases. Self-radiance and wisdom's light-rays, bindu essence, self-luminous, unchanging—wisdom free from characteristics.>

<Fruition-completely perfect wisdom: when ripened, appearance-mind as wisdom. Self-appearance outer-empty, dharmakāya's essential nature. Self-radiance inner-empty, saṃbhogakāya's essential nature. Compassion's continuous flow, nirmāṇakāya's essential nature. Three kāyas complete in single awareness.>
