[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIX SPACES BASIS]
[SCRIPTURAL AUTHORITY]

<Citation from *Klong drug pa* (Six Spaces Tantra): "First fall by-means-of establish one's basis" (*thog ma babs kyis grub pa'i gzhi*)—the basis established by primordial descent, not causal origination. Line 10511 "exist one from not-have from"—basis is neither one (*gcig*) nor non-existent (*med*), transcending existence/non-existence dichotomy. Lines 10512-10517: deluded appearance directions (*'khrul par snang ba'i phyogs*) vs. realization certainty (*rtogs pas gtan phab*)—the seven manners of basis appearance from delusion or recognition. This is *gzhi snang*—basis displaying as appearance, neither pure nor impure in itself. Line 10518 "that meaning this like is"—the six bases are not metaphysical claims but phenomenological descriptions of how basis appears to different cognitive conditions.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BASIS AS SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
[ONTOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS]

<Ten characteristics of basis (*gzhi*) as spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*):
1. **Itself-dwelling** (10519): *lhun grub nyid la gnas*—spontaneous presence as mode of being
2. **Various-gathering** (10520): *sna tshogs 'du*—collection of multiplicity in unity
3. **Not-certain** (10521): *nges med*—not fixed, accommodating all possibilities
4. **Move-do-mind** (10522): *g.yo byed sems*—aspect of moving, doing, minding
5. **Certain self-face** (10523): *nges rang ngo*—definite self-recognition aspect
6. **Remember-move-not** (10524): *dran g.yo min*—aspect of memory without movement
7. **Transform-able** (10525): *'gyur rung*—aspect of changeability
8. **Effort-mind** (10526): *rtsol sems*—aspect of effort and conceptual mind
9. **Whatever-nature** (10527-10528): *ci yin rang bzhin*—whatever appears is self-nature
10. **Khra bo** (10529): *khra bo*—variegated, manifold display

Lines 10531-10535: Primordially pure (*ka dag*), stain primordially not-have (*dri ma ye med*), self-face primordially pure—basis is pure from beginning, not purified through practice. This is *ngo bo ka dag* (essence primordially pure), distinct from *rang bzhin lhun grub* (nature spontaneously present).>

[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[REFUTATION OF EXTREME VIEWS]

<Second section: refutation of seven bases with faults (*skyon can*). Line 10537 "blind before elephant say like"—classic Indian parable: multiple blind men touch different parts of elephant, each claims exclusive truth. Seven bases are partial views, not comprehensive. Lines 10538-10539: "awareness's direction one realize's part to cling promise deep placed one accompany after view by-means-of, that refute to meaning seven from"—those attached to partial realization of awareness cling deeply, promising profound meaning, but the seven refute this. Lines 10540-10542: first refute spontaneous presence view (*lhun grub kyi lta ba*). Two arguments against lhun grub:

**Argument 1** (10543-10446): Spontaneous presence as ground-reality (*bden gshis*) implies India never cut off (*rgya gar yang ma gcod*)—samsara would have no beginning. View would fall to any direction (*phyogs gang du yang mi ltung*), i.e., nihilism.

**Argument 2** (10547-10548): If first-from spontaneous accomplishment, then nirvana would depend on conditions (self-face knowing, etc.) rather than being primordially accomplished. This contradicts Dzogchen view of *ye nas lhun grub*.

**Consequence** (10549-10551): If basis is spontaneous presence, either (1) samsara-nirvana cannot arise (unchanging), or (2) everyone liberates effortlessly without practice. Both absurd. This is *dbu ma* (Madhyamaka) style refutation showing extremes untenable.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND REFUTATION]
[SYNTHESIS]

<The refutation is pedagogical, not nihilistic. Lines 10536-10551 present *sūtric provisional* critique of reifying any single view of basis—including spontaneous presence. But the critique itself is provisional. The actual Dzogchen view (10519-10535) is that basis transcends all characterizations while accommodating all appearances. The ten characteristics are not definitions but descriptions of how basis manifests to different recognitions. The seven bases framework (previous page) includes all possible views to show all views partial. The Six Spaces Tantra citation establishes scriptural authority for basis beyond causal origination (*thog ma babs*—primordial descent). Risk: Taking refutation as denial of basis itself, rather than denial of reified views of basis. The basis IS spontaneously present AND primordially pure AND not describable by any single characteristic. This is not contradiction but completion.>
