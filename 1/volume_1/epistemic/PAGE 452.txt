<The crucial instruction: do not seek the three kāyas outside yourself. Dharmakāya is your awareness's empty essence. Saṃbhogakāya is your awareness's clear nature. Nirmāṇakāya is your awareness's compassionate display. All three complete in single rigpa—this is the meaning of svābhāvikakāya.>

<The error of thinking "I will achieve the three kāyas in the future." They are already present. The error of thinking "I have the three kāyas now but they are obscured." Obscuration is adventitious, not affecting the kāyas. The correct view: kāyas are the nature of awareness, never obscured, never achieved.>

<Final summary of three kāyas section: dharmakāya as essence, saṃbhogakāya as enjoyment, nirmāṇakāya as manifestation. Three aspects, one awareness. Not three buddhas, not three bodies, but three modes of display of single wisdom. This is the view of the Great Perfection.>
