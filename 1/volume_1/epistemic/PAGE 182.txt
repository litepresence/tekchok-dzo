[PRIMORDIAL PURITY EXEGESIS]
[ONTOLOGICAL PRIMORDIALITY]

<Primordial purity (*ka dag*): not created, not produced, not achieved—*ye nas* (from the beginning) pure. Not purity from impurity, but purity without impurity ever occurring. The ground (*gzhi*) is *gdod ma nas rnam dag* (primordially pure)—*spros pa* (elaborations) never arose. This is radical groundlessness—no basis for confusion, no process of purification. Confusion (*'khrul pa*) is recognition's failure to recognize itself, not actual state. Recognition is self-recognition; no other to recognize, nothing to achieve.>
