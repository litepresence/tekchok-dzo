Presents the utterly non-elaborate (*rab tu spros med*) as measurement of *rig pa* reaching its limit (*tshad phebs*) and exhaustion (*zad pa*) of dharmata (*chos nyid*) appearance. The thirty-two synonyms (*rnam grangs*) of body (*sku*) and wisdom (*ye shes*) enumerate what spontaneously completes (*lhun grub*) when recognition occurs. The Vajra-holder (*rdo rje 'chang*) ground represents not a attainment but the already-complete nature of the three vajras of body-speech-mind. The five-colored mandalas (*dkyil 'khor*) of the five buddha families arise spontaneously from the ground's own radiance, not through constructed practice.
