[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Excellent food and drink for winds: "To winds, excellent food and drink and good beer appropriate amount sustain" (*rlung la shis pa'i kha zas dang chang bzang po bag re bsten*) describes dietary support for wind practices. This is *yantra* preparation—physical sustenance for energetic work. "Great wisdom bindu reaching the vital point arises" (*ye shes chen po'i thig le gnad la phebs pa las byung ste*) indicates culmination: wisdom essence (*ye shes thig le*) arrives at target location. This is *sbyor ba* (application) phase—bringing all elements together. Risk: Thinking diet produces realization. The diet supports the body; practice prepares the mind; recognition reveals what was always present.>
