[BRANCH SAMAYAS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Branch samayas (*yan lag gi dam tshig*)—secondary commitments supporting root samayas. These include specific behavioral guidelines, practice commitments, and relational ethics. The branch samayas vary by tantra and practitioner capacity. For superior practitioners, few branch samayas—recognition is sufficient. For ordinary practitioners, many branch samayas create supportive structure. This is graduated pedagogy—more structure for those needing it, less for those with recognition. The text emphasizes: samayas are means (*thabs*), not ends.>
