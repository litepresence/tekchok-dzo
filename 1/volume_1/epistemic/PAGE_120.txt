[SINGLE NATURE, MULTIPLE NAMES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<From single ground-awareness-nature arise indicated and indicating method tantras, and from nature ground/essence/potency—five different names but meaning not transcending single essence. The citation from *Mu tig phreng ba*: "From single ground-essence's distinction, method and nature tantras merely imputed, essence single ground, nature empty, not different, unchanging." This is definitive (*nges don*) statement: all taxonomies provisional (*tha snyad*), single *chos nyid* definitive. The analogy of one person with many names illustrates hermeneutical principle: recognition sees through names to nameless.>

[WORD TANTRA CLASSIFICATION]
[DOXOGRAPHICAL FRAMEWORK]

<Word tantra (*tshig gi rgyud*) classification: sixfold brief indication of synonyms (*rnam grangs mdor bstan*)—tantras as ocean-deep (*rgya mtsho*), sun-clear (*nyi ma*), lion-overpowering (*seng ge rtsal*), mountain-king-like (*ri rgyal*), wheel-cutting (*'khor lo*), key-opening (*lde mig*), etc. These are metaphorical designations (*mtshan*) for tantric texts by function, not content descriptions. The analogy pattern—mirror showing reflection, precious gem, mother-child connection—establishes pedagogical accessibility (*go bde*) through familiar images. This is *bshad rgyud* (explanation tantra) style: elaborating what *man ngag* condenses.>
