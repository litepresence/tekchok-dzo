Completes the four kayas (*sku bzhi*) enumeration with the Emanation Body (*sprul sku*) of Vajradhara as sixth Buddha abiding at Tsanglo-can (Akanistha). The eightfold structure describes teacher, place, teaching, retinue, time, field, dharma, and reasoning for each kaya. The Essence Body (*ngo bo nyid sku*) and Form Body (*gzugs sku*) present tantric taxonomies of manifestation. These classifications serve as skillful means (*thabs*) for recognizing the atemporal ground, not literal cosmological descriptions. The hundred million world-systems emanating from pure realms express the inexhaustible (*mi zad pa*) display of awareness, not physical geography.
