[CONCLUSION OF TANTRIC SECTION]
[TEXTUAL TRANSITION]

<Conclusion of tantric exposition and transition to definitive Dzogchen. All tantric methods—empowerments, samayas, guru yoga, subtle body practices—are summarized as *thabs* (means) culminating in recognition. The text has established tantric framework comprehensively; now shifts to direct Dzogchen exposition. This is Longchenpa's characteristic structure: thorough presentation of lower vehicles establishing context, then Dzogchen as culmination. The transition is marked by shift from transformative language to recognition language—from *byang chub* (purification) to *rig pa* (awareness).>
