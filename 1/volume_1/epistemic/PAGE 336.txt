<Fetal positioning and element formation: "Male children from mother's right rib looking inward" (*bu khye'u rnams ni ma'i glo g.yas nas kha nang du lta*) describes fetal positioning in tantric embryology. The directional symbolism (right/left, inward/outward) encodes energetic principles—right associated with masculine/method, left with feminine/wisdom. "Depending on flesh, form aggregate increases" (*sha la brten nas gzugs kyi phung por mched*) describes how form (*gzugs*) coagulates from subtler elements. This is contemplative anatomy tracking consciousness's embodiment, not medical obstetrics. The text serves dual purpose: explaining birth and providing templates for conscious embodiment.>
