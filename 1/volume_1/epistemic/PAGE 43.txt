[RISK: SPATIAL REIFICATION]

<The sun-moon cosmology origin from collective karmic aspiration (*smon pa*) and waxing-waning from beings' wishes presents conventional Buddhist celestial mechanics. The first king Mahāsammata (*mang pos bkur ba'i rgyal po*) narrative establishes political philosophy within karmic framework. Risk: Literalizing celestial phenomena as karmically responsive rather than recognition-display.>
