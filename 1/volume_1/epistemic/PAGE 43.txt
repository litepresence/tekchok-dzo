[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GROUND-PATH-FRUIT UNITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Longchenpa establishes the non-dual view where ground (*gzhi*), path (*lam*), and fruition (*'bras bu*) are inseparable. The epistemic stance here is definitive (*nges don*)—not provisional (*drang don*). The practitioner is warned against temporalizing these as sequential stages. The spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) is not something achieved but recognized as primordially complete.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA RECOGNITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The text points directly to *rig pa* (awareness) as the nature of mind. This is not an intellectual understanding but direct recognition (*ngo shes*). The risk is conceptualizing rigpa as an object of knowledge rather than the knowing itself. The passage operates at the level of immediate experience, not philosophical speculation.>
