<Chakra correction methods: "Correction methods definitely explained" (*bcos thabs nges par bshad pa*) describes remedial practices for chakra imbalances. The text systematically addresses what happens when channels are blocked, winds erratic, or bindus depleted. "Thus outer channels inner pure, action and wisdom's movement" (*de ltar phy i rtsa nang dag na las dang ye shes la sogs pa'i rgyu ba*) describes how purified channels allow unimpeded flow of karmic and wisdom energies. This is tantric medicine—diagnosing energetic pathologies and prescribing specific visualizations, mantras, and physical practices. The subtle body is the patient's body; the practitioner is their own physician.>
