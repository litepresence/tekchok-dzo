[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Blissful nature and purified reality: "Ro ma's nature is bliss with special method, grasping objects liberated into dharmata purity" (*ro ma'i ngo bo bde ba ste thabs khyad par can dang bcas pa gzung ba'i yul chos nyid rnam par dag pa'i ngo bor grol*) describes how right channel cultivation transforms grasping into pure perception. "Speech ceasing, those dharmata appearances" (*ngag zad pa de dag gi chos nyid du snang ba*) indicates how energetic work leads to non-conceptual recognition. Risk: View collapse—applying tantric transformation logic (purifying, liberating) without recognizing Dzogchen primordial purity (*ka dag*). The resolution: These practices prepare the mind for recognition; they don't create purity that wasn't present. Purification reveals what was never impure.>
