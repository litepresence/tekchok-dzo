<Awareness primordially pure space awareness exhausted intention abides: "Awareness primordially pure, space-awareness exhausted intention abides" (*rig pa ka nas dag pas dbyings rig zad pa'i dgongs pa la gnas*)—culmination of Dzogchen view. *Ka dag* (primordial purity) is not achieved; it's recognized. *Dbyings rig* (space-awareness) exhausted—beyond even awareness as object. This is *zad pa'i dgongs pa* (exhausted intention)—mind of exhaustion where all concepts, including enlightenment, are spent. Sixth gate (*drug pa sgo*) introduces next section. The text's architecture mirrors the path: progressively subtler recognitions leading to exhaustion of even recognition itself.>
