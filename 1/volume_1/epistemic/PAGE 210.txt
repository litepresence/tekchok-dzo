<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*lta ba* — view, *lta ba g.yo ba* — view wavering, *lta ba thob pa* — obtaining view, *lta ba brtan pa* — stable view, *byang sems bzung* — holding bodhicitta, *phyag rgya chen po* — great seal, *blo 'das* — beyond mind)
- Hermeneutical precision: Correlation of practice stages with view development: initial contact without root generation = view wavering (*lta ba g.yo ba'i dus*); body-dependent bliss without control = mind not recognizing emptiness; ordinary conceptions absent = obtaining view (*lta ba thob pa'i dus*); refined bodhicitta to channel spread = experiencing body-mind nondual great seal beyond mind (*blo 'das phyag rgya chen po*); mastery over bodhicitta = stable view (*lta ba brtan pa'i dus*) without change/transformation.
- Temporal warnings: The "times" (*dus*) are recognition-phases, not chronological progression.
- Ontological warnings: "Obtaining view" and "stable view" are pedagogical descriptions, not ontological acquisitions. View (*lta ba*) in Dzogchen is recognition of *ka dag*—not obtained or stabilized but recognized as always present.
- Pedagogical purpose: The framework maps energetic experiences to view recognition. However, the ultimate "view" is not something to obtain or stabilize—it is *gdod ma'i gnas lugs* (primordial abiding nature) of *rig pa*.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: PROGRESSION FIXATION] — Believing view must evolve from wavering → obtained → stable. [RISK: VIEW STABILIZATION CONFUSION] — Thinking view needs stabilization rather than recognizing its innate stability as *ka dag*.>

[RISK: MASTERY CONFUSION]

<Masterful Dzogchen analysis:
- Key Wylie terms (*italicized*): (*byang sems bzung* — holding bodhicitta, *rtsa rnams la bkram* — spreading in channels, *lus sems gnyis med* — body mind nondual, *phyag rgya chen po* — great seal, *'pho 'gyur med* — without change transformation, *dbang thob* — obtaining power/control)
- Hermeneutical precision: The criterion for "stable view" (*lta ba brtan pa*)—spreading bodhicitta in channels, experiencing body-mind nondual great seal beyond mind, obtaining control over bodhicitta without change. This describes advanced *rdzogs rim* accomplishment where energetic mastery supports non-dual recognition.
- Temporal warnings: "Without change" (*'pho 'gyur med*) indicates non-fluctuating recognition, not frozen state.
- Ontological warnings: The "control" (*dbang*) is mastery over *byang sems* flow, not ontological power. To reify this as achievement contradicts Dzogchen's view of *rtsol med* (effortless) recognition.
- Pedagogical purpose: The description provides goal for completion stage practice. However, the ultimate "great seal" is not experience to achieve but recognition of *sems nyid* as *chos sku*.
- Risk explanation: [RISK: MASTERY CONFUSION] — Believing that control over bodhicitta constitutes full realization rather than supportive condition. [RISK: TECHNIQUE FIXATION] — Pursuing energetic mastery as end rather than means for recognition.>
