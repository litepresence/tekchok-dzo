[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RESULT VEHICLES FRAMEWORK]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: RESULT FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the six result vehicles ('bras bu'i theg pa drug)—the three outer tantras (Kriya, Upa, Yoga) and three inner tantras (Mahayoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga)—analyzing their common characteristic as vehicles that recognize enlightenment as already present. From the Dzogchen perspective, this shift from causal to result orientation represents a fundamental transformation in approach, from becoming to recognizing, from effort to naturalness.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] as the guiding principle of result vehicles. Unlike causal vehicles that work through accumulation and purification, result vehicles recognize that the ground is already pure, the result is already present, and practice consists of recognizing this rather than creating it. This is not mere semantics but a fundamentally different relationship to the path.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the result vehicles as progressively direct approaches to the natural state. The outer tantras (Kriya, Upa, Yoga) maintain varying degrees of dualism while recognizing the deity as already present in essence. The inner tantras (Mahayoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga) progressively dissolve even subtle dualism, culminating in Atiyoga's direct recognition of rig pa.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in result vehicles is the recognition that the ultimate is not something to be achieved but something to be recognized. Conventionally, practices are performed; ultimately, these practices reveal what has always been present. The separation between practice and realization is itself a conventional imposition.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the result vehicles' fundamental position: enlightenment is primordially present, the ground is spontaneously perfect, and practice reveals rather than creates. This view is definitive (nges don) rather than provisional, pointing directly to the nature of reality.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the result vehicles' distinctive practices. Unlike causal vehicles' emphasis on gradual cultivation, result vehicles employ sudden, powerful methods—visualization of oneself as the deity, manipulation of subtle energies, direct introduction to awareness. These methods are designed to disrupt ordinary perception and reveal the primordial perfection underlying it.

The section emphasizes the progressive subtlety of result vehicles. Kriya maintains deity-practitioner duality while recognizing their essential connection. Upa balances external and internal approaches. Yoga internalizes the deity completely. Mahayoga transforms perception through generation stage. Anuyoga reveals the subtle body's wisdom. Atiyoga transcends all methods in direct recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for result vehicles, recognizing that they point directly to the definitive meaning. While methods vary in sophistication, the view is consistent—enlightenment is already present, and practice reveals this presence.

The section thus establishes the result vehicles as the culmination of Buddhist teaching, representing progressively direct approaches to the natural state. The transition from causal to result vehicles is a paradigm shift that prepares the practitioner for Dzogchen's most direct recognition.
