[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Impure and pure embodiment: "Impure is human" (*ma dag pas mi*) contrasts with pure space-wandering (*mkha' spyod*)—establishing the tantric soteriology of transformation. The "body support" (*sku'i rten*) indicates how the subtle body serves as the vessel (*rten*) for enlightened qualities. This passage marks transition from describing samsaric embodiment to pointing toward tantric liberation. Critical navigation required: The text describes tantric goals (pure realms, transformed embodiment) while Dzogchen view holds nothing needs transformation. Resolution: Tantra is path for those requiring gradual transformation; Dzogchen is direct recognition for those ready to see through transformation itself.>
