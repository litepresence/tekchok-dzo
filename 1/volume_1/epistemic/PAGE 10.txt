[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

The passage continues the enumeration of the thirty-six activities, now describing the Sambhogakaya dimension. The technical Dzogchen terms (rang shar — self-radiating, chos nyid — dharmata, rang byung — self-arisen) indicate operation from the perspective of primordial awareness as always-already manifesting.

The claim that these activities "are not activity by an agent" but are "called activity because they arise as the skillfulness of the essence of qualities" represents the Dzogchen view of non-doing (bya byed med pa). The activities are not performed by a subject but are the spontaneous display of awareness's own nature.

The detailed description of pure fields — layered fields, lotus stems, perfume-water streams, Buddha-forms in pores — presents the Sambhogakaya as self-arisen display. These are not assertions about external locations but descriptions of how awareness appears to itself when unrecognized grasping is purified.

Risk: [RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY] — The elaborate visualizations and field descriptions, if taken literally as ontological assertions about metaphysical realms, would distort the Dzogchen view. These are phenomenological descriptions of awareness's display, not claims about external realities to be reached or achieved.

[NON-ASSERTIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

The assertion that teachings are "self-arisen syllables not made by anyone" yet "abide with all teachings as sons" points to the non-assertive dimension. The teachings are neither existent (as fabricated) nor non-existent (as they appear). This operates as upaya — an expeditious framing that points beyond itself.

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

The enumeration of the thirty-six activities in terms of Sambhogakaya characteristics represents a shift to tantric organizational schema. This provisionally structures the Dzogchen view in tantric terms for pedagogical purposes while the underlying perspective remains Dzogchen.
