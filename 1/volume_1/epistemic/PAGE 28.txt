[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<The five perfections (*phun sum tshogs lnga*) framework—abode, teacher, retinue, teaching, time—configures tantric maṇḍala topology. This result-oriented presentation organizes complete enlightened display for recognition, distinguishing tantric transformative view from gradualist causal vehicles.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The Dharmakāya field (*chos sku'i zhing khams*) as "ground of dharmatā luminosity" (*chos nyid 'od gsal gyi gzhi*) employs genitive *gyi* to assert identity—ground IS luminosity, not possessing it. This definitive Dzogchen position establishes *gzhi* as primordial purity (*gdod ma'i dag pa*) without transition or transformation.>
