[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

<The nihilist view (*chad par lta ba*) refutation—Cārvāka/Lokāyata spontaneous arising (*ngo bo nyid kyis byung ba*) without cause, result-cutter (*'bras bu chad par smra ba*) denying past/future lives—presents standard Buddhist polemics against materialism. Risk: Misreading Buddhist dependent origination as mere causal determinism rather than recognition of empty interdependence.>

[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

<The result-cutter defense and refutation (*rgol lan*) presents standard Abhidharmic dialectics. The seed-sprout (*sbon sbon*) and sharp-thorn (*tser ma rnon po*) analogies operate within conventional Buddhist logic against spontaneous arising.>
