<Tenth earth generator flesh: "Tenth, earth's generator flesh" (*bcu na sa yi skyed byed sha*) completes elemental correspondences: water → blood, earth → flesh, etc. Second section on branching outer channel petals and limbs (*g.yes pa phy i rtsa'i 'dab ma dang yan lag*) describes how channels extend from central structures to periphery. This is *yantra* technology—energetic engineering of the body. The practitioner visualizes these extensions to expand awareness throughout the entire embodiment. What begins as focused central channel work radiates to encompass all experience. This is tantric microcosm-macrocosm correspondence: body contains cosmos; cosmos reflects body.>
