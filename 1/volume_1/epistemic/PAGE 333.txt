[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Empty bindus and wind changes: "Empty" (*stong pa*) bindus are not absence but the state of essence (*thig le*) dissolved into luminous emptiness. "Worms' wind changes" (*srin bu de dag rlung gi 'gyur ba*) describes how energetic patterns (*rlung*) transform through subtle body processes. This is completion stage phenomenology—tracking how consciousness (*sems*) and energy (*rlung*) interact through channels (*rtsa*). The text systematically maps these interactions to provide practitioners with recognition frameworks. Risk: Literalizing subtle body as physical system rather than experiential topology for liberation.>
