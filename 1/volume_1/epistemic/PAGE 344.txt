<Seed non-leakage and consciousness collection: "Seed non-leakage" (*sa bon mi 'dzag*) refers to bindu retention—completion stage technique for conserving essence (*thig le*). "Collection of eight consciousnesses' gathering" (*rnam shes brgyad kyi tshogs pa sdud pa*) describes how winds gather consciousness into the central channel. These are advanced practices requiring precise instruction. The text systematically moves from basic channel knowledge to specific techniques: retention (*'dzin pa*), gathering (*sdud pa*), and directing (*sbyor ba*). This is *sngags lam* (mantra path) graduated practice—each step builds capacity for the next. Risk: Attempting advanced practices without proper foundation.>
