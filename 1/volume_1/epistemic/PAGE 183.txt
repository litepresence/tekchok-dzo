[SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE EXEGESIS]
[SPONTANEOUS ACCOMPLISHMENT]

<Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*): qualities (*yon tan*) naturally complete, not produced by cause. *Lhun* (spontaneous, effortless) and *grub* (accomplished, complete)—spontaneously accomplished without effort or contrivance (*bya rtsol*). The five Buddha bodies, five wisdoms, pure lands—all *lhun grub*, not cultivated. This is not result of practice but intrinsic nature. The phrase *lhun gyis grub pa* indicates natural perfection—like sun's light, not produced but naturally present. Recognition reveals what is already complete.>
