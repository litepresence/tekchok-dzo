[RISK: EXTERNALIZATION]

Describes early signs (*sngal ltas*) of samaya deterioration—disease, misfortune, and obstacles—along with repair methods (*bskang thabs*) for body and speech violations. The extensive confessions (*bshags pa*) and ganacakra offerings represent provisional practices for those not yet recognizing *rig pa*. These warning signs and remediation procedures function as skillful means for practitioners still operating within cause-and-effect frameworks. From the Dzogchen perspective, since samaya is the non-deceptive nature of mind itself, it cannot truly be damaged or repaired; apparent violations and restorations occur only at the level of conceptual overlay (*sgro 'dogs*), not in the natural state (*gnyug ma*).
