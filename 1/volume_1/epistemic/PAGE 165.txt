[DEITY YOGA EXEGESIS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Deity yoga (*lha'i rnal 'byor*) detailed: Generation stage (*bskyed rim*) practices of visualizing self as deity and environment as maṇḍala. This transforms ordinary perception (*tha mal gyi snang pa*) into pure perception (*dag snang*). The deity is wisdom-appearance (*ye shes kyi snang ba*), not imaginary creation. Three principles: clear appearance (*gsal snang*), divine pride (*lha'i nga rgyal*), recollection of purity (*dag pa dran pa*). This is tantric technology—deliberately creating conditions for recognition. In Dzogchen, deity is spontaneous (*rang byung*) appearance of *rig pa*, not visualized.>
