<Sautrantika (*mdo sde pa*) view: twelve knowledges cognizing four truths as objects to be observed. Abandoning 98 subtle afflictions (*phra rgyas*), realizing supreme wisdom. Similar to prior person-selflessness, surpassing through partial dharma-element. Particular atoms (*rdul phran*) with parts as five object-bases obstruct; primary mind-base, secondary mind-produced base, non-associated compositional aggregates base, uncompounded permanent base, appearance-form base—realizing five dharmatās. Not obstructing partless atoms; half of dharma-element as apprehended object coarse appearance atom-wing not reaching, established through partless realization, surpassing prior. Actual non-existence like not accepting atoms. Both meditate five paths' arising stages diligently, antidote to three poisons generally—selflessness and illusion meditation; particular antidotes: desire through eight impure substances and skeleton meditation, anger through love, ignorance through dependent origination forward-reverse meditation; conceptual thought antidote through counting exhalation-inhalation breaths. Selflessness meditation: observing cessation of object-subject, observing nothing-at-all meaning. If lethargic, antidote to dullness-ignorance: placing mind on lamp-flame at forehead.>
