[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MAHAYOGA EXPOSTION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: INNER TANTRA GENERATION STAGE]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents Mahayoga (rnal 'byor chen po), the first of the three inner tantras, emphasizing the generation stage (bskyed rim) as its distinctive practice. Mahayoga transforms ordinary perception into divine perception through elaborate visualization practices, recognizing all phenomena as the mandala of enlightened awareness. From the Dzogchen perspective, Mahayoga represents the most extensive approach within inner tantra, using sophisticated methods to disrupt ordinary perception and reveal the primordial purity underlying all phenomena.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] while maintaining elaborate [PROVISIONAL MEANING] methods. Mahayoga's view recognizes that all phenomena are primordially pure, that the deity is not created but revealed, and that the practitioner is already enlightened in essence. The generation stage mandala is not a fabrication but the recognition of the true nature of reality.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes Mahayoga as a powerful method for those who benefit from elaborate practice. The detailed visualization of mandalas, deities, and palace environments serves to transform perception at its root. However, Dzogchen notes that Mahayoga can become reified if the practitioner mistakes the visualization for reality rather than recognizing it as the display of rig pa.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in Mahayoga is the recognition that the deity is both the visualization (conventional) and the nature of mind (ultimate). The generation stage creates the deity through visualization; the completion stage recognizes the deity as one's own awareness. Mahayoga emphasizes the generation stage, though it includes completion stage elements.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes Mahayoga's specific perspective: all phenomena are the mandala of the deity, the practitioner is the deity in essence, appearances are the play of awareness. This view transcends the dualism of outer tantra while maintaining structured practice.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes Mahayoga's distinctive practices: the three samadhis (ting nge 'dzin gsum) of suchness, illumination, and cause; the generation of the mandala palace and deities; the self-visualization as the deity; and the absorption of the jnanasattva into the samayasattva. These practices transform ordinary perception into enlightened perception.

The section emphasizes Mahayoga's focus on the two accumulations (tshogs gnyis) of merit and wisdom, achieved through the generation stage's elaborate methods. While Dzogchen recognizes these accumulations as naturally present, Mahayoga provides systematic methods for those who need structured practice.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for Mahayoga's view while acknowledging [DRANG DON] for its methods. The view is definitive—all phenomena are primordially pure. The methods are provisional—elaborate visualizations that lead to recognition. This distinction prevents reification of the practices while respecting their power.

The section thus presents Mahayoga as the foundation of inner tantra, establishing the view of primordial purity through elaborate method. For practitioners who benefit from detailed practice, Mahayoga provides a comprehensive path. For those ready for more direct approaches, Anuyoga and Atiyoga offer increasing subtlety and directness.
