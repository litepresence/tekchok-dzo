[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND SAMAYA]
[ULTIMATE PERSPECTIVE]

<Introduction to "supreme samaya" (*bla na med pa'i dam tshig*)—not higher grade of same category but complete transcendence of samaya framework itself. Line 10335 "letter not-have from" (*yi ge med pa las*) echoes Heart Sutra's "no eyes no ears" but points to Dzogchen's radical immediacy: no textual mediation between recognition and nature. "Guard boundary crossed" (*bsrung ba'i mtshams 'das*)—protection protocols themselves surpassed. This is *nges 'byung* (definite emergence) from all conventional categories including Dharma. The phrase "one alone vast" (*gcig pu phyal ba*) describes *rig pa* as solitary expanse without second, companion, or reference point. Line 10341 "primordial guard boundary from crossed one's nature from not-move"—the samaya IS the transcendence of samaya, unmoved (*mi gyo*) by transgression or observance.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KHREGS CHOD SAMAYA]
[PRIMORDIAL PURITY AS VIEW]

<Khregs chod (*khregs chod*) samaya analyzed: All samsaric dharmas (*'khor ba'i chos*)—appearances, existence, container-contents (*snod bcud*), outer-inner—are "primordially not-have" (*ye nas med pa*). Eight examples of illusion (*sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad*): mirage, water, dream, echo, reflection, city of gandharvas, magical creation, rainbow. Not metaphysical claim but epistemic stance: knowing appearances as illusory liberates "true-clinging" (*bden zhen*). The purpose (*dgos pa*) is release from fixation, not denial of appearance. Key: *she pas* (by knowing)—active recognition, not passive belief. Risk: Nihilistic reading as "nothing exists" rather than "nothing exists inherently." Line 10343 "mind seize's rope by-means-of not-bound"—awareness (*rig pa*) not captured by conceptual grasping (*sems 'dzin*).>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THOD RGAL SAMAYA]
[SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE AS VIEW]

<Thod rgal (*thod rgal*) samaya: Self-arisen wisdom (*rang byung ye shes*) possesses qualities (*yon tan*) spontaneously accomplished without dependent gathering (*tshogs*). Line 10347 "self face know by-means-of accomplish certainty after"—direct face-to-face recognition (*rang ngo shes*) produces certainty without external confirmation. Light five (*'od lnga*) self-clear in spontaneous presence's nature—five-colored lights of thod rgal vision. Four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) experienced non-separately: smoke, mirage, fireflies, lamp. These are not objectives but self-nature (*rang bzhin*) accomplishing as buddha. Line 10350 "other from doubt not-need"—no external validation required; recognition is self-confirming. Thod rgal is not technique producing result but direct manifestation of already-accomplished nature.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-LIBERATION]
[NON-DUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT]

<Universal self-liberation (*rang grol*) principle: Conditions appear (*rkyen snang*), pleasure-pain (*bde sdug*) arises, feeling and thought manifest—whatever appears, whatever aware (*ci shar ci snang ci rig*)—all self-arisen wisdom one-only (*gcig pu*). Certainty (*thag chod*) in this produces spontaneous equal great (*lhun mnyam chen po*)—not tranquility but dynamic equanimity. Lines 10356-10357 mark pinnacle: nature as dharmakaya primordially pure (*ka dag*), spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*), cut-through and leap-over non-dual. "Dharma-nature cease ground on sha ra ra ol la la"—onomatopoeia for dissolution into groundless ground. Line 10358 "ye re re sangs sangs sangs"—spontaneous, instant, complete buddhahood without process. All self-clear wide (*rang gsal zang ma*), self-cease (*rang zad*)—appearance and liberation simultaneous.>

[RISK: CONVENTIONALIZING THE TRANSCENDENT]

<The supreme samaya presents unique pedagogical danger: readers may categorize it as "highest" within samaya hierarchy rather than radical break from category itself. The text uses conventional language ("guard," "samaya," "accomplish") while pointing to what transcends all guarding, all commitment, all accomplishment. This is *sgra ji bzhin pa ma yin pa* (not literal meaning)—terms are fingers pointing to recognition beyond term. Risk of " Dzogchen bypass"—using transcendence view to avoid conventional practice. The text balances: khregs chod requires illusion-recognition, thod rgal requires light-vision familiarity. Supreme samaya is not license but completion—when all limits are seen as self-liberated, discipline becomes spontaneous expression rather than imposed rule.>
