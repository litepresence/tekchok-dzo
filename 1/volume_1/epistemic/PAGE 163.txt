[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[COMPLETION STAGE DETAIL]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) detailed: Six yogas (*rnal 'byor drug*)—inner heat (*gtum mo*), illusory body (*sgyu lus*), dream (*rmi lam*), clear light (*'od gsal*), intermediate state (*bar do*), consciousness transference (*'pho ba*). These are advanced tantric practices for transforming death, bardo, and rebirth experiences. Risk: Taking these as literal mechanisms rather than recognition-frameworks. The practices create familiarity with states that become recognition opportunities. In Dzogchen, these are spontaneous (*lhun grub*)—clear light is always present, bardo is always now. Tantra cultivates deliberately what Dzogchen recognizes immediately.>
