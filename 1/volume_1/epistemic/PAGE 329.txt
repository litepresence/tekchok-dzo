<Body, speech, mind determination: "Each abiding as determined support of body, speech, mind" (*sku gsung thugs kyi nges pa'i rten du gnas pa*) describes how subtle body structures serve as supports for enlightened dimensions. The channels carry body (*sku*), winds carry speech (*gsung*), bindus carry mind (*thugs*)—this is the tantric trikaya framework mapped onto physiology. The text then transitions to day 50 (*zhag lnga bcu*), marking a gestational milestone when water element's power (*chu'i byed las*) dominates. The systematic tracking of elemental phases serves as contemplative template for understanding embodiment's constructed nature.>
