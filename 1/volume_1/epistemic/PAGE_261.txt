[CONSCIOUSNESS-BASIS CONSEQUENCES]

<Lines 10724-10726: Consequences of variety-as-consciousness: "consciousness momentary-like basis momentary consequence, consciousness thinking realization many-like basis also-that-to consequence, consciousness affliction condition powerful-like basis also-that-to consequence"—if variety is consciousness, basis becomes momentary like consciousness, multiple like thinking/realization, afflicted like conditioned mind. Lines 10727-10732: Consequences of basis-as-external-internal: "basis grasped-grasper-to consequence, basis six-collections abandon object one-sided-to consequence, again basis expanse as-one not-tenable, many assembled is's because, these etcetera faults"—basis becomes grasper-grasped, abandons six collections for one-sided object, cannot be expanse-as-one because assembled of many. These are *thal 'gyur* (absurd consequences) reducing position to impossibility.>

[SIX EXPANSES CRITIQUE]

<Citation from Six Expanses Tantra (10733-10734): "Teacher above scattered spoke"—teacher spoke scattered above. Lines 10735-10741: "This also side not-tenable-by, whose essence that appearance, result different meaning that similar, many sound-by deterioration's because, this also object-of-knowledge is-not, spoke that also that-like"—not tenable from any side; whose essence is that appearance? Result different, meaning similar; deteriorates by many sounds; not object of knowledge. This critiques *sna tshogs* (variety/multiplicity) as basis characteristic. The scattered (*thar thar*) nature of multiple appearances contradicts basis as unified expanse (*dbyings*).>

[PRIMORDIAL WISDOM EXISTENCE]

<Seventh position (10742-10744): "Awareness self-arisen's primordial-wisdom existence-non-existence's extreme from free-by, primordial-wisdom merely established not, elaboration-free great-bindu's aspect-from anywhere not-established intend"—awareness self-arisen primordial wisdom, free from existence-non-existence extremes, not merely established as primordial wisdom, intent not established anywhere from elaboration-free great bindu aspect. Refutation (10745-10754): "Thus anything not-established primordial-wisdom merely-not existence-from pure-by anywhere place-to-put natural-state anything not-exist if samsara-nirvana arise expanse-to contradiction"—if anything not established, primordial wisdom not merely not-existent, pure anywhere place-to-put natural state not exist, samsara-nirvana arising contradicts expanse. Lines 10747-10748: "Primordial-wisdom not-exist if Buddha and sentient-beings's liberation not-exist-by, basis realize-from liberate also not-logical, subtle five-lights not-exist if basis-appearance arise cause not-exist-by"—if primordial wisdom doesn't exist, liberation doesn't exist; realizing basis to liberate illogical; subtle five lights don't exist if no cause for basis-appearance. Lines 10749-10754: "Not-realized delusion's mind not-logical, Six-Expanses from, essence at primordially-pure-by, sentient-beings samsara this not-logical, non-awareness stain primordially-exhausted's because, thus earlier six-bases similar"—from Six Expanses: essence primordially pure, sentient beings' samsara illogical, non-awareness stains primordially exhausted. Thus similar to earlier six bases.>

[PRIMORDIAL PURE SPONTANEOUS ACCOMPLISHMENT]

<Third section (10755-10757): "primordially-pure spontaneous-accomplishment non-dual's basis own-system posit at actual-meaning, that-at dispute abandon two from, first is essence primordially-pure at spontaneous-accomplishment depth clear exist-by non-dual portion's essence primordially-pure's awareness thing characteristic not-established"—non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous accomplishment, posited in own system as actual meaning; abandoning dispute from two; first, essence primordially pure, spontaneous accomplishment depth clearly existing, non-dual portion, primordially pure awareness thing characteristic not established. This is Longchenpa's own view: *ka dag lhun grub gnyis su med pa'i gzhi*—basis of non-dual primordial purity and spontaneous presence. The seven positions are all refuted as one-sided; actual basis transcends all characterizations while including all. *Rang lugs* (own system) is not eighth position but recognition that basis is beyond positions.>
