[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Individual karma distinctions: "Individual karma's particularities" (*so so'i las kyi bye brag gis*) describes how different practitioners experience different results based on karmic propensities. "Second, *phowa* definite vital points particular explanation" (*gnyis pas 'pho ba nges pa'i gnad bye brag tu bshad pa*) introduces consciousness transference—moving consciousness at death to pure realm. This is advanced completion stage technique requiring precise timing and channel knowledge. The text prepares practitioner for conscious death—navigating dissolution stages and directing consciousness upward through central channel. This is tantric death yoga (*'chi bslu*), not Dzogchen spontaneous liberation.>
