[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[EMPOWERMENT AS POINTING-OUT]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Four empowerments from Dzogchen perspective: not external transmissions but recognition's self-manifestation. Vase empowerment—body as deity is *rang snang* (self-appearance); Secret—subtle body is *rlung* (energy) of awareness; Wisdom-knowledge—bliss is *rig pa*'s quality; Word—nature of mind is *rig pa* itself. This reframes empowerments as descriptions of recognition rather than causes of it. The Dzogchen view: empowerments are *chos nyid*'s self-presentation, not ritual conferrals. This is definitive (*nges don*) understanding—empowerments point to what is already perfect.>
