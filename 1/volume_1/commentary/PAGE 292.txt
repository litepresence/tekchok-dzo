COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 292

You who seek metaphors to understand! Longchenpa offers you jewels at lines [12154-12163]: Jewel empty mandala draw-beautiful, jewel end border-knot three are coiled beautiful, jewel deep darkness dispel wide in naturally profound, jewel ocean peak upon setting none, jewel lamp burning is light clear, jewel secret pristine-awareness in increase-decrease none, jewel variously spreading path upon traverse none, jewel body-stupa burning stupa is stacked beautiful, jewel vajra seat upon change none, jewel empty path upon meeting none. Ten jewels he gives you. But do you understand? The empty mandala drawn beautiful—this is your own mind, empty yet appearing. The border-knot three coiled beautiful—essence, nature, compassion, inseparable. Deep darkness dispelled, naturally profound—your own awareness, wide, clear. Ocean peak—no setting, no rising. Lamp burning—light clear, needing no fuel. Secret pristine awareness—no increase, no decrease. Variously spreading path—none to traverse. Body-stupa burning, stacked beautiful—your form is the stupa, the enlightenment monument. Vajra seat—no change. Empty path—no meeting, no parting.

At lines [12164-12173], mind-intent self-abiding quintessential-instruction as shown thus. These all drop-circle secret-cycle in. Earth jewel kind-five stupa what stacked beautiful says etcetera with consistent. Third that from other benefit doing is. Sphere primordially-pure great dharmakaya field that from unmoving while, spontaneous from-door beings appearance-mode with accord benefit doing, spontaneous light body power from sambhogakaya appearance arranged having, that from Brahma-great aeon arranged, nature nirmanakaya appearance and, impure samsara from-door beings appearance with consistent teacher beings realm pervading shown samsara emptied doing. Mind-intent self-abiding—this is the quintessential instruction shown. These all in the drop-circle, secret-cycle. Earth jewel kind-five stupa stacked beautiful—says etcetera, consistent. Third, from that, other-benefit doing. Sphere primordially pure great dharmakaya field—from that unmoving, while spontaneous from-door beings' appearance-mode, accord benefit doing. Spontaneous light body power—from sambhogakaya appearance arranged having. From that Brahma-great aeon arranged. Nature nirmanakaya appearance. Impure samsara from-door beings' appearance, consistent—teacher beings realm pervading shown, samsara emptied doing.

At lines [12174-12192], these all common vehicles in also appear. Uttaratantra from: Compounded-not and spontaneously accomplished, other condition realized not and, knowing and compassion and power possessing, benefit-two possessing buddha nature, beginning middle end none of, nature being reason compounded-not, peaceful dharmakaya possessing reason, spontaneously accomplished called expressed, self self realize for-reason, other condition realize not, thus manner three realize for-reason knowing, path show for-reason mind compassionate, power pristine-awareness compassion, suffering afflictions dispel for-reason, first three self-benefit, later three other-benefit is, says and. These all appear in common vehicles too. From the Uttaratantra: Not compounded and spontaneously accomplished. Other condition, realized not. Knowing, compassion, power possessing. Benefit-two possessing Buddha nature. Beginning, middle, end none. Nature being reason—not compounded. Peaceful dharmakaya possessing reason. Spontaneously accomplished called, expressed. Self self realize—for reason. Other condition realize not. Thus manner three realize—for reason knowing. Path show—for reason mind compassionate. Power pristine-awareness compassion. Suffering afflictions dispel—for reason. First three self-benefit. Later three other-benefit. Says and.

So you see? The Buddha nature is not something you must create. It is not compounded. It is spontaneously accomplished. It possesses knowing, compassion, power. It has the two benefits—self and other. It has no beginning, middle, or end. It is the peaceful dharmakaya. And why does the compassionate mind show the path? Why does pristine awareness use power and compassion to dispel suffering? For reason. For the reason of benefiting self and other.

The jewels are your own nature. The stupa is your body. The path is untraversable because you are already there. Do not look for the mandala outside. Do not look for the jewel in another's pocket. Everything Longchenpa describes is your own mind, your own awareness, your own spontaneously present nature. Recognize this, and you are the wealthiest being in all existence.
