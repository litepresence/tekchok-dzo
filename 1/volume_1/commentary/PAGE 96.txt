COMMENTARY ON PAGE 96 - Patrul Rinpoche

You who would understand White Space—listen! Lines 3744-3763: The essence of self-purified abiding, nowhere divided, not established as affirmation or negation, transcends conceptual construction. Without duality in characteristic, it does not depart from the single wheel of mind's existence. Through that very activity, unceasingly radiant—it is called "the liberation of appearance and mind without duality."

This too, through the reasoning of thought-free self-nature, intends the primordial liberation of all phenomena, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated from their own ground. The second: Through the self-nature of appearance-emptiness liberated from its own ground, dharmatā of mind is radiantly displayed in manifold forms. Through liberation of non-appearance from its own ground, action is freed from virtue and non-virtue. This too, through the reasoning of transformation into emptiness, establishes non-appearance as self-purified.

The third: Through self-emptiness, primordially pure, not relying on action's cause and effect. Through fabrication, it arises; through arising as emptiness, it liberates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in all directions. Through appearance and concept as ground, the reasoning of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's non-establishment appears. Through inexpressibility, the essential point beyond thought; through being beyond comparison, the essential point beyond meditation; through liberation from the two of abiding and transformation, the essential point of mind free from transformation—through these three, the manifestation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's true form is intended.

The essence of white space, lines 3763-3768: Through the self-liberation of appearance and conditions, without fabrication, pure cause, not to be established in any mode of abiding. Divided—From action's vast expanse, the White Space of ineffable teaching; From the union of view and meditation, the two White Spaces.

The first, lines 3767-3783: The essence is liberated through direct seeing of the nature. The abiding is self-purified. When divided: Ocean Space and Sky Space—these two.

The essence of Ocean Space, lines 3772-3782: Eternally self-liberated beyond extremes. Liberated through non-action, it is liberation itself. Without the two extremes of multiplicity. These divide into two: Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space.

The first: Mind's self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated. When relied upon, mind-emptiness is thoroughly purified. The self-purified dharmatā of appearance-emptiness, from the beginning inexpressible. Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness's transcendence, it is empty—by emptiness, nowhere is anything established—this is the intent.

The Small Ocean Space, lines 3784-3785: Through self-purified reliance, the mind is without stain. Through the particular abiding in purity, conditions are from the beginning inexpressible—this is the intent.

The essence of Sky Space, lines 3786-3796: Dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated. When divided, these are two: Sun-Moon Space and Jewel White Space—these two.

The first: The essence is utterly pure emptiness. Self-nature unborn, primordially liberated. The second: Qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions self-purified. Through non-action toward the mind, dharmatā is spontaneously accomplished—this is the intent regarding causes and conditions.

Do you see? All these names—Ocean Space, Sky Space, Sun-Moon Space, Jewel White Space—they are all pointing to your own mind, your own nature. Not something far away, not something to achieve. Self-liberated, primordially pure, uncontrived. Rest in that!
