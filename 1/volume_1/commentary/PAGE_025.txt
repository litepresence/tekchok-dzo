The names continue—Yoke-holder, Plow-arrow-holder, Acacia-possessing, Beautiful-to-see, Horse-ear, Prostrate, Rim-holder. You read these and think of mountain ranges surrounding Mount Meru. But listen, you who would know your own mind.

These are the obstacles on the path, practitioner. The seven mountains are the seven stages of purification, or the seven obscurations that must be traversed. Yoke-holder—your fixation on self, yoked to existence. Plow-arrow-holder—your aggressive tendencies, plowing up virtue, shooting arrows of harm. Each name describes a pattern in your mind, a way that you hold yourself back from recognition.

The measurements decrease as we move outward—forty thousand yojanas down to six hundred twenty-five. You think this is mere cosmological detail. But observe: as you move away from the center of your being, the delusions become more numerous but less substantial. The grossest obscurations are closest to the core. The subtlest are at the periphery. Yet all are measurable. All can be traversed. The path has dimensions.

The eight great nagas in their lakes—Joyful, Near-joyful, Horse-basis, Releasing-holding, Possessing-splendor, Land-guarding, Great-black, E la leaves. These are not mythological serpents. They are the eight classes of consciousness, the eight ways that awareness can flow when it is not liberated. They control the rains—the rains of experience, of blessing, of obstacles. When the nagas are pleased, the crops grow. When your consciousness is aligned, realization flourishes. When they are disturbed, drought comes. When your mind is agitated, practice withers.

The four yakshas at the corners of Meru's peak—raising-time palaces. You read of them controlling the seasons, bringing summer rain, autumn grain, flower-ripening, winter cold, spring warmth. But look at your own subtle body. Are there not four energy centers at four corners of your heart? Do they not regulate the seasons of your practice—times of growth, harvest, ripening, dormancy, and renewal? Your meditation has its seasons. Do not expect spring flowers in winter. Do not expect harvest in spring. Know the time.

The seven mother-goddesses who dwell in these regions, controlling individual action—these are the seven aspects of karma, the seven ways that your actions ripen. You are never free from their gaze. Every action you take, every thought you entertain—these goddesses record it, weave it into the fabric of your experience. But they are not external judges. They are your own awareness, naturally reflecting back to you the results of your conduct.

And the four great kings, sending disease and weapons, famine and prosperity—do you think these are external deities controlling the world? They are the four cardinal principles of existence: impermanence, suffering, non-self, and peace. When you forget impermanence, they send disease to remind you. When you grasp at self, they send weapons to shatter your fortress. When you are attached to pleasure, they send famine to show you the emptiness of satisfaction. When you practice virtue, they make good—prosperity arises as the natural result of your actions.

All of this is happening now, in your own experience. Do not look for it in some distant heaven. Look for it here.
