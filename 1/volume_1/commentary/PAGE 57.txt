Now Longchenpa enters the profound topic of the two truths [2831-2866], and you must understand this clearly! The conventional and ultimate are not two different realities. They are two ways of seeing the same reality.

The Root Wisdom says: "The Buddhas taught the Dharma, relying correctly upon the two truths: the conventional truth of the world, and the ultimate truth of meaning" [2839-2842]. This is not philosophical dualism! It is practical pedagogy. The Buddha meets beings where they are, speaking conventionally to those who need it, pointing ultimately to those who can receive it.

The conventional has two divisions: false and true [2848]. The false conventional is all imputed appearances arranged by intellect [2849]—the world you create through conceptual construction. You see a table, you name it "table," you believe in the table as truly existing. This functions! You can eat on it, work on it. But when analyzed, where is the table? In the wood? The wood is also imputed. In the atoms? The atoms are also conceptual. Everything dissolves under analysis.

Yet the true conventional [2862-2866]—the white actions of virtue, the collections of merit gathered through wisdom's samadhi—this leads toward liberation. It is still conventional, still conceptual, but it functions to bring you closer to the ultimate. Like using a dream to wake from dreaming.

And the ultimate? Also two: nominal and true [2871-2887]. The nominal ultimate is what you realize through reasoning—through Madhyamaka analysis, through negating all extremes. You see that nothing arises from itself, from other, from both, or from neither. You conclude: empty. This is crucial! But it is still conceptual, still within the realm of mind.

The true ultimate [2881-2887]—phenomena primordially transcend all elaboration. They do not need to be negated; they were never established. They do not need to be emptied; they were never full. This is beyond reasoning, beyond concept, beyond even the notion of "ultimate." It is what remains when the mind that seeks it relaxes completely.
