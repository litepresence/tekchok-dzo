[9872-9878] Listen here, practitioner! Knowing empowerment and oral instruction's occasion, knowing view as vast, knowing meditation's continuity great, knowing dharmatā profound, knowing samsara as unmixed, knowing abiding in passed grounds, knowing individual and general dharma and dharmi's characteristics—this is how you hold samaya!

[9879-9885] Also from that: "This is protection method: knowing one distinction's distinction, superior protection through ten distinctions, less from that one. Samaya king engages thus." Do you see? One knowing becomes ten, ten protect the one. Don't count—recognize!

[9886-9896] Now body-speech-mind samaya specifically explained. From *Thal-'gyur*: "Empowerment-depending samaya explained; though particular expressions hard to fathom, summarized: body, speech, mind—yoga body-speech-mind applied. Object guru vajra sibling; protection sphere distinguishes; commitment body and empowerment gathered; vajra secret place held."

[9897-9921] Body samaya—outer, inner, secret. Not giving outer, not taking inner, not killing secret. Each has its sphere. Repair with clay images, painted deities—seven. Why seven? Complete number to turn the wheel. Guru's shadow—don't step over, don't stretch legs toward, don't show back. Not etiquette—training in non-grasping! Vajra siblings—strike them and you've struck yourself. Damage travels.

Emaho! Samaya is your own mind's protection!
