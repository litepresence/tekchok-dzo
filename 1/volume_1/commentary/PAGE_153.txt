This knowing tantras chapters and meaning know occasion placed established (line 1). Third supreme definite prophecy (line 2): vajra essence teaching and, teaching's seed-kāya and, self-arisen letter and, three vajras and, those holders persons before-after arising sequence shown meaning three (lines 3-7): teaching's descent manner generally shown, flourish decline particularly explained, who holds persons shown (lines 8-10).

First is (line 11): first Samantabhadra Brahma-great eon arranged abode, that blessing Vajradhara Buddha emanation that dharmakāya saṃbhogakāya arose, Vairocana etcetera kāya's abode Brahma-great eon arranged, emanation kāya various disciples benefit doing, that eon first actual teaching dharmakāya great perfection, saṃbhogakāya teaching self-sound, emanation kāya manifestation appearance benefit doing, that blessing arisen vajra and, texts and, kāya images sequence descended, actual reflection teaching held, buddha sentient beings benefit spontaneous arising (lines 12-23):

First emanation awakening eon from, that abode field this not destroyed before fields other emanation benefit doing, now Saha field Buddhas thousand appearance benefit doing these three blessings (lines 24-26).

From Sound Talgyur (line 27): secret definite seventeen and, teaching's light miracle letter with, emanation field first, teacher Samantabhadra, dense arrangement abode held (lines 28-32). Then Tuṣita abode, Rigpa Vairocana, this held five rigpa ripened (lines 33-35). That past I held, teaching's life-tree supreme, buddhas thousand roots two, this depend definitely arise (lines 36-39).

Womb and egg-born and, warmth and womb-born, sentient beings ripen (lines 40-42). Disciple teaching this, twelve dharma wheel arisen (lines 43-44). This deeds thirty-six (line 45).

Listen! Now we come to the prophecy—the definite descent of the teaching. From Samantabhadra in the Brahma-great eon, through Vajradhara, through Vairocana, through countless emanations. The three kayas teaching—dharmakaya's great perfection, sambhogakaya's self-sound, nirmanakaya's manifestation.

And the blessing continues! Vajras, texts, kayas, images—all descending through time. The teaching held as actual reflection, benefit arising spontaneously for sentient beings.

From the Sound Talgyur—the seventeen tantras with light-miracle letters, first in the emanation field with Samantabhadra in dense arrangement. Then Tusita with Vairocana, the five rigpa ripened. This is the life-tree of the teaching, with the thousand buddhas as roots!

Twelve dharma wheels turned, thirty-six deeds performed. This is not mythology, you! This is the structure of how the teaching manifests. It is happening now, in your own mind. The teacher Samantabhadra is your own nature. The dense arrangement is your own body. The teaching is happening now.
