Longchenpa explains the nine vehicles in detail [2475-2538], and you must find yourself among them! These are not abstract categories—they describe living approaches to awakening practiced by real beings right now.

The three inferior vehicles: listener (sravaka), self-enlightened (pratyekabuddha), and bodhisattva [2476-2477]. These are the sutra vehicles, the path of characteristics. They emphasize renunciation, compassion, and the gradual cultivation of merit and wisdom. If your mind is drawn to systematic practice, to step-by-step progress, to clear stages and measurable attainments—these paths are for you.

The three medium vehicles: Kriya, Upa (Charya), and Yoga [2478-2479]. These are the outer tantras, the path of transformation through ritual and visualization. Kriya emphasizes purity and cleanliness, maintaining distance from the deity. Upa brings deity and practitioner closer. Yoga unites them in meditation. If you are drawn to ritual, to mantra, to working with energy and channels—these paths call to you.

The three great vehicles: Maha, Anu, and Ati Yoga [2480-2481]. These are the inner tantras, the path of direct recognition. Maha Yoga works with the generation stage, creating the mandala through visualization. Anu Yoga works with the completion stage, the subtle body practices. Ati Yoga—Dzogchen—is the direct recognition of the nature of mind itself, beyond all fabrication.

But hear this: the vehicles are not hierarchical in the sense that higher is better! They are hierarchical in the sense of directness. A humble practitioner of the listener vehicle who genuinely practices may be closer to awakening than a Dzogchen practitioner who merely thinks they are supreme.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo [2496-2522]: "Inverted and correct view. By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara. Correct: three stages—small mind and great, and thus medium mind possessed, taught as three-stage method." The difference between wandering and liberation is not the vehicle you follow, but whether your realization is correct or inverted. Correct realization sees through the self. Inverted realization grasps at something.

So do not aspire to the "highest" vehicle! Aspire to genuine recognition, whatever vehicle you practice. And if you are drawn to Ati Yoga, to Dzogchen, approach it with humility, with devotion, with the accumulation of merit and wisdom that prepare the ground.
