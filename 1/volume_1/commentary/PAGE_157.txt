Outcaste family thousand years, this abiding flourishing made (lines 1-2). That passed below dark, years thousand five abides (lines 3-4). Then again here descended, Vajra Seat arising abode, this flourishing light blazing, years five hundred fifty (lines 5-8). This Lodro Zangpo holds (line 9). That patron ḍākinī, Cool-pure made (lines 10-11).

That below world this, earth water fire wind joined disturbed, not-abide emptiness great becomes (lines 12-14). Eon called first from, end destruction time arises (lines 15-16). Thus it is spoken (line 17).

Lodro Zangpo this holder all, years five hundred year great, five hundred five hundred passed (lines 18-20). That only humans eon first life ten primordial this appearance, others not ḍākinī abode benefit doing (lines 21-22).

Second flourish decline particularly explained (line 23): Jambudvīpa this now primordial life ten this flourish decline types seven arising (lines 24-24). From Ati Great Arrangement (line 25): listen fortunate Śāriputra, teaching's supreme great extensive arrangement, supreme essence repeatedly gathered, gold essence sun illuminator this, common degenerate flourish not, secret great family possessing some appear (lines 26-32).

Degeneration strife-possessing affliction coarse time, sects internal quarrel hermitages all destroyed. Royal law not-abide self-pride king conduct, father son quarrel weapon bodies protect. Accumulated groups lost earth's environment exhausted. Unsuitable view conduct also many arise (lines 33-38).

Degeneration five hundred life year gradually decline. Merit fortune short life sixty, essence this years sixty abides (lines 39-41). That passed below years hundred interval, logic conduct secret this not-abide (lines 42-43). That passed below years thousand also, study contemplation without person from, secret supreme this sun like (lines 44-46). That passed below two hundred dark (line 47).

Then life years forty, essence this years hundred interval abides (lines 48-49). That passed thirty interval dark (line 50). That passed years hundred interval abiding, beings' life thirty time, secret supreme this distance eight hundred flourish, life twenty this not arising (lines 51-53). Life ten time essence this arisen, this and meet self-release (lines 54-55). Sky exhausted not-appearing teaching's seed, also teaching's ember other becomes (lines 56-57). Thus spoken and (line 58):

Listen to this prophecy of decline! Outcaste family flourishing for a thousand years. Then 1,500 years of darkness. Then the teaching descends to Vajra Seat, blazing with light for 550 years under Lodro Zangpo, with the patron ḍākinī Cool-pure. But then—the world itself disturbed, elements in chaos, returning to great emptiness.

And our own time—Jambudvipa now! The seven types of flourish and decline in the age of ten-year lifespans. Degeneration time—afflictions coarse, sects quarreling, hermitages destroyed. Kings prideful, father and son fighting with weapons. This is our world, you!

But notice—when the common teaching degenerates, the secret great teaching appears! When the gold of the common dharma is exhausted, the sun of the supreme essence shines. This is the time!

Life spans declining—sixty years, then forty, then thirty, then twenty. Yet the secret essence flourishes at eight hundred distance! What does this mean? It means when outer conditions are most difficult, the inner teaching becomes most available. When life is short and coarse, the direct path of dzogchen becomes the only viable path.

Life ten time—this is when the essence truly arises. This is when we meet and self-release. The teaching's seed moves to other fields, but the ember remains. This ember is what we must tend now!
