**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08

## Layer Specifications
- **Purpose:** ngo sprod kyi bshad pa (Heart Instruction) - Direct pointing in plain terms
- **Content:** Earthy, immediate recognition - Patrul Rinpoche voice
- **Character:** Patrul Rinpoche - ragged yogi, raw, piercing
- **Average Length:** ~18 lines per page (target: 25-40 lines)
- **Files:** 479 pages (Volume 1), 415 pages (Volume 2)

## Completion Status
- **Volume 1:** 34.4% Complete (165/479 pages complete, 314 stubs)
- **Volume 2:** 24.1% Complete (100/415 pages complete, 315 stubs)

## Quality Metrics
- Raw earthiness: Common speech, not scholarly
- Piercing the intellect: Hammer emptiness of concepts
- Tangible metaphors: Cold water splash effect
- Intimate address: Always "you" - "Look into your awareness"
- Punchy oral flow: Short sharp sentences, exclamations
- Khenpo-grade precision: Nail key distinctions

## Current State
Most files are stubs (5-15 lines) with placeholder content. Substantive commentary exists for approximately:
- Volume 1: Pages 1-50, sporadic coverage elsewhere
- Volume 2: Minimal coverage

## Remaining Work
- **Volume 1:** 314 pages need full commentary development
- **Volume 2:** 315 pages need full commentary development
- **Priority:** HIGH - Major gap in project completeness

## Next Steps
1. Systematic review of all stub files
2. Expansion to 25-40 lines per page with Patrul Rinpoche voice
3. Ensure line ranges match actual Tibetan content
4. Add [line-range] format to all entries

## Notes
- NOT about cosmology/metaphysics as theory, but as immediate recognition
- No contrived phrases like "empty yet luminous"
- No repetitive parallelism for effect
- No scholarly hedging ("This could mean...")
- Stick to text specifics
