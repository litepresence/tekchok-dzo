[The text continues with detailed descriptions of signs and purification methods for the very elaborationless empowerment.]

Very elaborationless—no elaborations at all! Yet time and signs definite. Outer time: fruit ripening, grain gathering—self-appearance liberated as fruit. Inner time: waxing first, or exhaustion middle—single bindu realized, karma and habitual tendencies exhausted.

Only one fortunate one! Two complete Buddha. More than that, yogi purpose not accomplished.

Faith-possessing son, fortune-possessing—empower one or two. They become Buddha, certain!

Empowerment time: sun tip risen. Individual words definite clear. See nature's pure basis. Whatever signs arise—sin purifies without ritual. Directly purified above.

If cloudless sky: dharmakaya field conduct. Various light expanse arises: sambhogakaya field. Various sounds heard: emanation field breathes.

This is the direct path! No elaborate ritual, no extensive preparation. Just recognition. The signs themselves are the purification. The time is when recognition arises.

But only for the most fortunate! Only for those with the karma ripened. For others, the elaborate path is necessary. Do not skip steps thinking you are more advanced than you are.

One or two—no more. In the very elaborationless, too many dilutes the blessing. Like trying to fill many cups from a single stream—the stream divides, none are full.
