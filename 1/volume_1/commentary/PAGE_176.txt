Wild dakinis untamed! Cemeteries are excellent and auspicious. Not the comfortable places, you! The places where ordinary people are afraid—this is where empowerment enters.

From the Great Perfection Self-arisen: not in the town center! Yogi purpose not accomplished there. At town's end, in forest or mountain ravine—empty places. This is where empowerment meaning enters.

Examine the abode! Valley's end, fruit forest ripened, flowers arising. West high, east expanse. North protecting, south valley. Self-manifest direction. Valley empty in front, no form, no beings. Rock support behind. Fruit trees blazing at sides. Clear water flowing in front. Food abode. Mountain ranges uncut. Birds calling variously.

Times! Autumn for ripening results. Spring for planting liberation seeds. Monkey year auspicious. Waxing eighth day good. Star king supreme. Jupiter good.

For elaboration empowerment: rat, dragon, horse, pig years. Four months. Waxing from first day. Full moon middle. Noon or midnight. Element suitable to yogi's body. Not fixed numbers—hundred fifty or whatever, no contradiction.

But watch for defects! Lamp without expanse—repair samaya. Or you must take again and again. Death obstacles may arise. Disease, stammering, hunger, memory loss. These are signs to purify through confession, recitation, generation and completion stage.
