[14107-14113] Insertion place, spinal vertebrae, lotus stigma, breast peak, sixteen branches. All these locations—have you found the one who locates? That one has no vertebrae.

[14114-14128] Kyangma produces speech. Voice sweet, voice high, voice dull, voice trembling—all from channel straight or crooked, thick or thin, pressed or rough. But who hears? The ear that hears has no curve. Find that ear.

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
