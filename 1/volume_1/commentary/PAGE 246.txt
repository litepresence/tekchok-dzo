[9990-10015] Speech samaya—outer's outer is falsehood abandoning. You speak mantra words but your heart's crooked? Useless. One false word and power doesn't arise. Your speech becomes others' gossip.

[10016-10041] Outer's secret—abandon harsh words. Always speaking harshness, you've made friends into enemies. After death, pride-body leads to bad-migration.

Speech inner—dharma speak outer, accomplish inner, meditate speech. Grieve and blame others following dharma? You've degenerated both their path and yours. Mind-thought becomes uneven.

[10042-10084] Secret's outer—disparage vajra siblings. Inner—guru's mudra. Secret—guru himself. Cut speech with siblings? Aeon after aeon in suffering. Trace of bad speech—even in dream, confess immediately.

The twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, mind—these are your lifeline. Cut them and you've cut yourself.
