You who would gather all into one—listen! Lines 4086-4097: That also gathered into eleven thousand chapters; That also gathered into twenty-two hundred ślokas; That also gathered into eleven thousand enumerations; That also gathered into two bundles of distinctions; That also gathered into five hundred summaries; That also gathered into one thousand essential points; That also gathered into fifty-one sharp nails; That also gathered into two emanations of meditation's presence and absence. And that, when made the vessel of the category, is called the Great Expanse's vessel, gathered into three categories. And that is gathered into the two: command and treatise. And those are gathered as the Mind Category.

All these numbers! Eleven thousand chapters, twenty-two hundred slokas, eleven thousand enumerations... Do not be overwhelmed. They describe the vastness of the teaching, the infinite ways of pointing to the same truth. Like raindrops falling into the ocean—all become one taste, one nature.

The teaching is gathered, organized, systematized for your benefit. But do not mistake the organization for the truth. The truth is simple: your own nature, clear and free. The organization is a method to help you recognize it.

The categories of the Expanse are gathered into three expanses, lines 4098-4101: The expanse of meditation's presence; The expanse of self-nature's non-finding; The expanse of characteristic's non-distinction—gathered as three.

Three expanses: meditation's presence (when you meditate, what is present?), self-nature's non-finding (when you look for self, you cannot find it), characteristic's non-distinction (no duality, no separation).

That also gathered into three thousand name-affixed tantras... [lines 4102-4113 continue listing numbers]

All categories of instruction also gathered into three expanses, lines 4114-4117: The expanse of play's non-cessation; The expanse of mind's non-liberation; The expanse of essence's non-good-non-bad.

Play's non-cessation—manifestation never stops appearing. Mind's non-liberation—mind does not need liberation because it was never bound. Essence's non-good-non-bad—beyond all moral dualities.

Those also gathered into twelve thousand name-affixed tantras... [lines 4118-4121]

You see the pattern? Everything gathered, organized, numbered. But remember: these are fingers pointing. The moon is your own nature. Do not count the fingers; look at the moon!

The Great Perfection is vast, profound, endless in its expressions. But its essence is simple: recognize your own mind. Everything else is commentary, method, skillful means. Use them well, but do not get lost in them. The destination is recognition; the path is whatever brings you there.
