PAGE 252 COMMENTARY

Listen, fortunate one! Lines [10335-10354] pierce to the heart of Great Completion's samaya—primordial purity and spontaneous presence!

The boundary of rigpa—this is not a fence you build! It is the natural limit where awareness cannot be moved. When you cross it, you wander alone in vastness. Your only companion becomes your own delusion!

Cut-through's samaya [10341-10342]: Samsara's dharmas are like mirages, like water in a desert, like the eight examples of illusion! They appear but have no true existence. Cling to them as real and you bind yourself with ropes of your own making!

Look! Whatever arises—thoughts, feelings, appearances—let them be! Do not seize them! The five senses wide open, awareness without basis, directly placed in vast expanse. This is the meaning of release into dharmata!

Leap-over's samaya [10346-10354]: Self-arisen wisdom accomplishes spontaneously! It needs no gathering, no effort, no dependence on other causes. Like the sun that shines without being asked—self-clear, self-present!

The five lights and four appearances—they are not separate from your experience! Buddha nature accomplishes itself. No need to doubt! No need to seek outside!

Whatever appears, whatever you feel—pleasure or pain—recognize it as self-arisen wisdom. One taste, one certainty! This is the samaya of Great Completion!

Do not try to place what is already placed! Do not meditate what is already accomplished! Simply remain in the natural state, like a mountain unmoved by clouds!

Emaho! The samaya that cannot be broken!
