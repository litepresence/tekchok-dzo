You who continue to twelve! Lines 8-14 describe its complete—prophecy sense-object verse, non-dual experience awareness object, breath emission clear mind verse, parting grasping birthlessness, praise secret-held markless verse, expanse-awareness non-dual great bliss twelve. You experience twelve! But twelve dissolve into one. Like twelve hours—one full cycle.

Its utterly unelaborated external at lines 13-19—suitable entry, suitable obtaining two, internal definite conduct, definite view two making four, secret distinguishing families, existing self two making six, complete cause condition two making eight. You distinguish and exist! But existence is self-nature. Like space—exists without effort.

Its thoroughly unelaborated external at lines 21-28—mind abiding, speech abiding two, internal transforming speech, obtaining mind two making four, secret prophesying bliss, secret breath emission two making six, complete abiding elaboration, obtaining own action two making eight. You abide and obtain! But abiding is resting. Like a bird settling—natural state.

Thus unelaborated's elaborated at lines 30-34—sixteen, unelaborated twelve twenty-eight, utterly unelaborated eight thirty-six, thoroughly unelaborated eight forty-four fruits obtained. You obtain forty-four! But fruits are results. Like harvest—comes from cultivation.
