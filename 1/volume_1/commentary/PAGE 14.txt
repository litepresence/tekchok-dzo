[398-405] Listen! The vajra at Ri ma la—at the vajra place, the yaksha kings worship with their hands. The syllable dwells in the sky above the vajra seat, held by dakinis. The body is not fixed to one earth—surrounding Jambudvipa, circling, making special divine and human gatherings into fields of offering. When harm comes to the teaching at times, light rays from the body, HUM from the mouth, fire from the eyes—turn back the obstacles!

[406-410] At the time of mind teaching, the vajra dwells in the sky of the vajra seat. The syllable dwells in the cave of the furious sage. The body dwells at the peak of the stacked vajra palace called "Thirty-three gods' measureless palace." Through such three emanations dwelling, Jambudvipa is supreme among others.

[411-423] The manner of twelve emanation bodies coming to the twelve classes—Vajradhara himself, from sambhogakaya going as nirmanakaya to purify beings' five aggregates, showing five perfections in nature as twelve appearances: First, the field Perfection Rich Stacked Tushita, abode Perfection at the lotus flower heart. Teacher Perfection, youth Display Supreme, Inconceivable One came. This good kalpa—Buddha thousand and bodhisattva two as indicators, ocean of light-display Buddhas thousand and two as retinue Perfection. Teaching: root of all, sound Mahayana tantra. Time: Amitayus time spoke. Compiler: divine son Joy Swelling Lord and Sun Greatly Shining, two.

[424-425] Second, abode Perfection at Jambudvipa. Teacher youth Light Unshakable, from five-colored egg shell born.

Emaho! The Buddha manifests in twelve ways to tame twelve types—recognize these emanations!
