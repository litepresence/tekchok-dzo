[398-410] The three sacred supports move through time and space according to the needs of beings. At Mount Malaya, the vajra abides where yaksha kings render homage. The syllable remains in Vajrasana's upper sky, held by dakinis. The body itself is not fixed—it circumambulates Jambudvipa (our world), making offerings and protecting the teaching. This describes how the enlightened energy functions—not as something static, but as dynamic presence that responds to circumstances.

When harm arises to the teaching, protection manifests naturally—from the body comes light, from the face comes HUM, from the eyes comes fire. This isn't describing some wrathful deity getting angry! It's describing how the natural clarity of awareness responds to obstruction. The light of recognition dispels darkness. The sound of HUM—the quintessence of all mantra—resonates as the nature of sound itself. The fire is the wisdom that burns through confusion.

[411-425] Now begins the detailed account of the twelve emanation-bodies in twelve abodes. Vajradhara from Sambhogakaya manifests as emanation-body to purify beings' five aggregates. This is the principle of skillful means—enlightened awareness appears in whatever form will most benefit beings. The five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness) are what make up ordinary experience. The teaching appears in forms that can purify these aggregates, transforming them from the basis of suffering into the display of wisdom.

First emanation: In Tushita's upper chamber, abiding at the lotus center, the teacher Supreme Light Unimaginable arrives to a retinue of thousand light-appearance Buddhas. This is describing the dimension of perfect enjoyment where the root tantra Sound Thalgyur is taught. Don't think of this as ancient history! These dimensions exist right now. Tushita heaven isn't somewhere you go after death; it's the dimension of contentment that opens when awareness recognizes itself.

Second emanation: In world Saha, teacher Light Akshobhya born from five-light egg, to retinue of dakinis, teaching body-speech-mind-qualities-activities tantras. Each of these emanations represents a different way the teaching manifests based on the capacities of beings.
