PAGE 59 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa continues on the fruit of the bodhisattva path [2903-2961], and you must hear this not as future attainment but as present possibility! The ground of All-Illumination [2905] is not a place you will reach after eons of practice. It is the nature of your awareness right now, when fully recognized.

The Dharma body for self-purpose, the two form bodies for others [2905-2908]—this is the complete awakening. But what are these bodies? Not physical forms you will acquire! The Dharma body is the empty, luminous nature of mind itself—the aspect that knows its own nature. The form bodies are the compassionate display that spontaneously arises to benefit beings—the aspect that appears while remaining empty.

From the Entrance: "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought, working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained" [2910-2913]. This is not poetry about some distant Buddha! This describes what happens when your mind is fully liberated. You become a wish-fulfilling tree—whatever beings need, you naturally provide. You become a wish-fulfilling jewel—whatever they wish for, you spontaneously manifest.

And "until liberation is attained" [2913]—this does not mean until YOU attain liberation. It means until ALL beings attain liberation. The bodhisattva's vow is endless, not because the bodhisattva fails, but because compassion is inexhaustible. Even when all beings are free, the display continues, the benefit continues, the play of awakening goes on.

The conventional and ultimate truths [2918-2961] are explained again here, but now in the context of practice. The false conventional—all imputed appearances [2924-2928]. The true conventional—the ten virtues, the thoughts of faith [2929-2935]. The nominal ultimate—what is established through reasoning [2936-2944]. The truly mental ultimate—emptiness utterly without anything [2945-2954].

But do not stop at the ultimate either! Even emptiness can be grasped. Even "ultimate" is a concept. Go beyond the beyond, to what cannot be named, cannot be thought, cannot be taught—yet is fully present in every moment of your life.
