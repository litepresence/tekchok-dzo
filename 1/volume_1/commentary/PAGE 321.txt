Wisdom self-arisen, spontaneously present. The wisdom that grasps characteristics, that gathers knowing, that abides as light. This is the mirror-like wisdom, the first of the five.

The past wisdom, primordial purity, white light like stars covering everything. From this, dharmata arises unstained by karmic latencies. The wisdom that gathers samsara and nirvana into one knowing.

Wind-channel wisdom, non-conceptual mind, abiding. The wisdom of equalness, red light, self-arisen realization. Yellow light, other-arisen realization. Wisdom that knows existence and non-existence, phenomena and non-phenomena—this is the discriminating wisdom, the third.

All-knowing wisdom, the fourth, gathers into two: ultimate and conventional. From this, the fruition of the three kayas. Birth, abiding, death—pleasure and pain—all experienced. The yogin's body becomes the nature of the three kayas.

Body's characteristics, grasping wisdom—dharmakaya certainty found. Abiding wisdom—sambhogakaya. Ceasing wisdom—nirmanakaya. The three kayas are not somewhere else. They are what you are when wisdom is recognized.

Seven days—the body's basis thickens. All approaching-accomplishing actions gathered in seven days. Elements gathering and expanding, accomplished in seven days.

The wisdom that is like a horse, like wind—when the body dissolves, it's not that wisdom ends. It continues, moving, abiding elsewhere.

Letters, lights, bodies—all arise from awareness's self-radiance, then dissolve back into ignorance itself, into awareness.

Awareness, base-abiding, inner clarity expanding—without color, without form. When the body exists, appearances arise outward. Light body, form body—even in the bardo, appearances arise.

What does this mean?

You're not becoming a buddha. You're recognizing that you already are the wisdom that has always been present. The five wisdoms aren't achievements—they're what awareness naturally is when not confused by appearances.

Mirror-like: reflecting everything without keeping anything. Equal: not favoring pleasure over pain, nirvana over samsara. Discriminating: knowing exactly what things are without混淆. Accomplishing: acting without hesitation. Dharmadhatu: the vast space where all of this happens.

These aren't acquired. They're uncovered. Like removing dust from a mirror—the reflection was always there.

You're not becoming. You're revealing.
