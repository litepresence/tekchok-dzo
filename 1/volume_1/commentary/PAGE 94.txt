COMMENTARY ON PAGE 94 - Patrul Rinpoche

You who would be free from extremes—listen! Lines 3673-3679: Self-arising primordial-wisdom's play one-by samsara-nirvana all-on extreme-falling without pervaded. Appearances-imputed spontaneously-arisen cessation without lower-realms established without. Appearances essence different self-nature direction-tilted reasoning-from not-departed self-nature pure. Samsara emptied. Pervasion great-dzogchen view-from not-departed. That also existence-non-existence appearance-emptiness directions-in not-fallen. Action-free pleasure-pain beyond dharma-nature desired.

The play of self-arising primordial wisdom pervades all of samsara and nirvana without falling to extremes. Appearances are imputed, spontaneously arisen, without cessation, without lower realms being established. The essence of appearances is not different from self-nature—reasoning has not departed from pure self-nature. Samsara is emptied! The pervasion of the Great Perfection view has not departed.

Not fallen into the directions of existence or non-existence, appearance or emptiness. Beyond action, beyond pleasure and pain—this is the dharmata.

Fifth, lines 3681-3685: Mind's direction-on seeing without appearances samsara-nirvana-in not-divided. Objects all's object-basis-on direction-holding whatever not-abandoned. View action-effort without expanse-in dwelling. Whatever is not-is appearances various-in appear. Appearances vast directionless self-liberated action and conduct beyond self-liberated desired.

Without seeing in the direction of mind, appearances are not divided into samsara and nirvana. Not abandoning whatever direction-holding on the object-basis of all objects. Dwelling in the expanse without view, action, or effort. Whatever is or is not appears in various appearances. Appearances are vast, directionless, self-liberated—beyond action and conduct, self-liberated.

Sixth, lines 3687-3690: Intellect-without objects not-become. Appearances self-arisen concepts self-liberated. Appearances essence truth-falsity not-established. Existence-non-existence limitlessness-in dwelling truth-falsity whatever not-established desired.

Without intellect, objects do not become. Appearances are self-arisen; concepts are self-liberated. The essence of appearances—truth and falsity are not established. Dwelling in the limitlessness of existence and non-existence, truth and falsity are not established.

Thus mind's category-in 210,000. Space three, lines 3691-3692. The Mind Category contains 21,000 teachings. The Space Category—three. Lines 3693-3705: Dharma-nature expressible beyond expanse. View not without expanse. Conduct is without expanse. Sections six-hundred three-hundred. Emanations three: abiding basis-top-on striking emanation; appearance self-from liberated emanation; dharma-nature equal non-different without emanation.

Dharmanature is beyond the expressible expanse. View is not without expanse. Conduct is without expanse. There are 600 or 300 sections. Three emanations: striking on top of the basis of abiding; emanation self-liberated from appearance; emanation without difference, equal dharmata.

Dharma-nature penetrated without nails fifty. Object-mind-on applied breaths hundred eleven. Appearance-mind single-moment-in distinguished essential-points hundred-thousand two. View sphere-on applied hundred-thousand five. Meditation exists conceptualization cutting essential-points hundred-thousand one those-on named continuums thousand and three-in abide.

Fifty nails penetrate dharmata without being dharmata. One hundred eleven breaths applied to object-mind. One hundred thousand essential points distinguished in a single moment of appearance-mind. One hundred thousand five applied to the sphere of view. One hundred thousand one essential points cutting conceptualization where meditation exists. Those named abide in one thousand and three continuums.

Do not be overwhelmed by these numbers! They point to the vastness of the teaching, the infinite ways of pointing to what is ultimately simple: your own nature, clear and free.
