[373-382] "Those three emanations of body, speech, mind, not made by anyone, fearless." Keep coming back to this! The enlightened manifestations aren't manufactured. They don't come from someone's intention or effort. They arise spontaneously from the nature of awareness itself. Like how a clear mirror naturally reflects whatever appears before it without deciding to do so, the three kayas naturally manifest to benefit beings without anyone making them happen.

The self-arisen blessing performs miracles and immeasurable qualities. The activity immediately liberates birth when meeting with whichever. What does "meeting" mean here? It's not about physically encountering some special object. It's the moment of recognition—when the disciple's mind meets the teaching and recognizes its own nature. In that moment, birth is liberated. The cycle of samsara is cut. This can happen in an instant, without years of preparation.

The three supports function as gateways: the Vajra supports the mind, pacifying disease; the self-arisen letter supports speech, liberating through sound; the body supports form, liberating into clear light. These aren't superstitious objects with magic powers! They're focal points for recognition. When you look at the Vajra with recognition, you're seeing the indestructible nature of your own awareness. When you hear the self-arisen syllables with recognition, you're hearing the natural sound of dharmata.

[383-397] The text describes the duration and location of these teachings. They abide in different places according to the times of body, speech, and mind teachings. The timeframes are vast—thousands of years, hundreds of Buddhas. This is describing the cosmic scale of the teaching, how it persists through time for the benefit of beings.

The Vajra exists in Uddiyana (the land of the dakinis), sometimes making emanations with light and sound. The letter is held by dakinis in the sky above Vajra-seat. These are descriptions of terma—hidden treasures of teaching that are concealed and revealed at appropriate times. The teaching isn't ever truly lost. It remains in the nature of mind, ready to manifest when conditions are right. This is how the Dzogchen lineage continues—not just through human transmission, but through the natural revelation of awareness itself.

The distinction between body-taming, speech-taming, and mind-taming teachings corresponds to different phases and different capacities of beings. As times change and beings' capacities change, different aspects of the teaching become more prominent. But all are ultimately pointing to the same recognition—the recognition of the nature of mind.
