You who would examine the knowledge-woman! Lines 8172-8186 speak of family, shape, color, conduct door examine four. You think this is about finding a partner! But it's about recognizing the nature of wisdom. Like finding a guide who knows the path—necessary at first, then you know the way yourself.

Family door examine three at lines 8177-8186—outer family royal family sugata family, minister family vajra, commoner family jewel, brahmin lotus, outcaste family karma. You discriminate high and low! But all families can accomplish. Like different seeds—all can grow in fertile soil.

Buddha whichever accomplish think not at lines 8183-8184—family each knowledge-woman each not not accomplish. You think some are excluded! But wisdom doesn't discriminate. Like rain falling on all fields—each grows according to its seed.

Inner family at lines 8191-8201—yakṣa daughter, god daughter, nāga son, brahmā daughter, indra daughter five karma mudra family. You categorize! But these are the energies in your own body. Like naming the different rivers—they all flow to the same ocean.

Before kosala master at line 8202—glorious great-bliss brahmā indra daughter attract empowerment siddhi attained. You want these attainments! But they come from practice, not attraction. Like a flower that attracts bees—it's not trying, just being what it is.

Secret family four at lines 8203-8234—conch-possessed, elephant-nose-possessed, lotus-possessed, deer-possessed, cow-possessed. You get caught in the descriptions! But these describe subtle energies. Like describing different musical notes—they're all sound, but different qualities.

Lines 8210-8234 describe characteristics—hair black teeth good, voice yellow right li, hair bad forehead prominence. You look for these signs! But the real sign is recognition. Like a signpost—the sign is not the destination.
