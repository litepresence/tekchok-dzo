PAGE 77 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa speaks of the Bodhisattva vehicle's definition, purpose, fruit, and divisions [2818-2831], and you must hear this as your own call to awakening! The definition: "depending on whatever method, leading to the supreme great city of liberation" [2818]. Not just any liberation—supreme! Complete! The liberation that includes all beings, all qualities, all wisdom.

The purpose: "causing those with supreme minds to obtain Buddhahood" [2818]. This vehicle is not for the faint-hearted, not for those content with small results. It is for those who aspire to the highest, who will not rest until they have awakened completely for the benefit of all.

The fruit: "accomplishing the all-illuminating ground, the eleventh" [2818]. The ten grounds of the sutra path, culminating in the eleventh—the All-Illumination of Buddhahood. This is not a place you go; it is what you are, fully revealed when all obscurations are cleared.

The divisions: many, but here gathered into the general path of the Vehicle of Characteristics [2831-2838]. This is the approach through the two truths—conventional and ultimate—the basis of all Mahayana practice. First understand the two truths, then practice accordingly, then realize the fruit.

The conventional truth [2837-2866]: phenomena marked by characteristics that appear as objects of intellect. This is your everyday world—the world of tables and chairs, of pleasure and pain, of self and other. It appears real, functions reliably, but when analyzed, cannot be found. Like a dream that seems solid until you wake.

The ultimate truth [2867-2887]: the inherent nature of dharmas, the essence of emptiness, the peaceful aspect beyond elaboration. This is not another world, not a place you go! It is the nature of the conventional world, seen clearly. Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. They are not two separate things.

Your practice begins with the conventional—cultivating virtue, gathering merit, developing concentration. It matures in the ultimate—realizing emptiness, transcending all views, resting in non-dual wisdom. But even the ultimate is not a stopping point! From the ultimate, you return to the conventional, now transformed, now the play of awakening.
