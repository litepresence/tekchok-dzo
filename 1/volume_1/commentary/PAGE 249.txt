[10209-10224] Body samaya transgressed—separated from Buddha-body. All three realm beings—compared to cutting life at one time? By defeat, sin is limitless.

Speech ceases—Buddha-speech doesn't dwell. Tongue faculty cut—sin is limitless.

[10225-10279] Mind degenerates? Filling three realms with meditators, disturbing mind—sin increases more. Especially guru-relying fall is heavy.

Without bad mind, by degenerate mindfulness in dream, or non-virtues becoming careless—confess aimed at guru. Bodily fault by body, speech and mind also. Not confessed immediately—experience uninterrupted suffering.

Guru is nature of all Buddhas. Teaching to liberate from samsara—object is fierce. Abandon non-faith, wrong mind, harm, speaking. Even if body's suffering becomes supreme, by own ability make effort. Guru's mind—even for moment must not be disturbed. Cherish his food and wealth as your own life. This is how yogi acts.
