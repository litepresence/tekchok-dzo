[12418-12422] Wish-fulfilling tree expanding—called thus! Buddha-youth vase-body's blessing arisen tree, egg-arisen heat and moisture-born one exists—from that mind self-arisen wisdom called, moving, tireless world arises! This is confusion-object's ignorance!

[12423-12432] Confusion-basis basis-ignorance—confusion-basis self-by-self impure arisen, first cause-condition called, ignorance actual arisen, basis-not-known ignorance! From that observed-condition called, confusion-object's ignorance like! From that controller-condition tree self-grasping arisen! From that similar immediate-condition called, awareness coarse became, grasping grasped! From that afflictions coarse became! This is confusion-basis basis-ignorance!

[12433-12447] Grasping-conception ignorance—from that afflictions' assembly immeasurable arisen! Also thus: grasping mind six arisen! Ignorance-similar mind, mind's consciousness mind, all-searching mind, certainty-establishing mind, coarse mind, definite-placing mind! Also thus: ignorance-similar-possessed mind is thus: root ignorance actual, mind's movement with!

Do you see? From one not-knowing, all this mess! Cut the root and the tree falls! Emaho!
