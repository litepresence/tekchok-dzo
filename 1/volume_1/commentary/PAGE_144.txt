Listen carefully! The CITTA jewel palace—this is your own heart center. Not the physical heart, but the heart of awareness. Within it, self-awareness wisdom manifests. This is the true teacher—the self-arisen wisdom, not some external being.

The retinue is not separate! The kayas, wisdoms, bindus—all are the play of this awareness, non-conceptually arising. There is no division, no separation. Past, future, present—all are not. Division itself is completely not. All is self-arisen wisdom.

And notice—from Talgyur: self-arisen made without from. This is crucial! It is not made. It is not produced by causes and conditions. It is self-arisen, unaltered, completely pure from the beginning. The elements gather, aggregates arise, but the palace is without production. It simply is.

This is the uncommon introduction—the five perfections from the side of the nature itself, not from the side of the practitioner. Abode, teacher, retinue, teaching, time—all are perfections of awareness itself. Not something to be achieved. Something to be recognized.
