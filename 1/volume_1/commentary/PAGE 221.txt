Listen, you who would purify completely! Lines 1-58 describe that which purifies—empowerment of that which purifies, means of purifying body and afflictions through divisions of number, four types of empowerment, first elaborated based on elaboration divided into four. You divide to purify! But division is for understanding. Like cutting a cake to serve—still one cake.

Elaborated's elaborated external at lines 7-10—preparation assembly, offering tooth-stick, internal offering mandala, secret tying protection cord, complete examining dreams. You prepare and offer! But offering opens. Like opening a gift—reveals what was hidden.

Its unelaborated external at lines 12-14—ablution, request, vajra calling. You wash and request! But washing cleans. Like bathing—removes dirt, reveals clean body.

Its internal at lines 16-19—drinking samaya oath-water, oath abandoning samsara, accepting nirvana, not doing beings' benefit. You drink and swear! But oaths bind. Like a promise—keeps one committed.
