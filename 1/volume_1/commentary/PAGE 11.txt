[323-335] Now we get into the specific activities, starting with the body's activities. The outer activities: through body appearing without self-nature, obscurations are purified. This is pointing to the empty nature of form. When you recognize that the body is empty of inherent existence, that recognition itself purifies the obscurations that come from grasping at the body as solid and real.

The three face-hands represent different aspects of wisdom. The perfected wisdom face-hand perfects the body's self-nature. The clear light face-hand liberates self-appearance. The clear discerning face-hand perfects knowledge. These aren't physical hands! They're symbolic representations of how enlightened awareness functions. The inner four activities relate to the thirty-two marks and eighty signs—the characteristics of an enlightened being. But again, these aren't physical characteristics you can see with ordinary eyes. They're the natural qualities that manifest when awareness recognizes itself.

The secret four are profound: residing without front or back perfects the aspect of appearance. Looking from inside, outer clarity perfects the empty aspect. Looking from outside, inner clarity perfects non-duality. Tip pervasively residing perfects non-dwelling without cessation. This is describing how awareness is structured—it's not directional (no front or back), it's clear inside and outside simultaneously (showing the non-duality of inner and outer), and it doesn't dwell anywhere yet never stops.

[336-350] The speech activities follow the same pattern. The six self-arisen syllables (OM MANI PADME HUM) emanating from the tongue—this is how mantra functions at the Sambhogakaya level. The mantra isn't just sounds you recite; it's the natural vibration of awareness itself. Entering the father's face and emerging from mother's space—these are symbolic descriptions of how the non-dual wisdom emerges from the union of emptiness (mother) and appearance (father).

The secret speech activities are about practice: pure body practice engages self-arisen dharma, pure speech practice engages outflow-free dharma, pure mind practice enjoys wisdom knowing all aspects, pure face practice enjoys all-knowing dharma. These "practices" aren't things you do to become enlightened. They're descriptions of how awareness naturally functions when recognized.

[351-365] The mind activities through various samadhis: non-composite clear, pure wisdom view, pure dharma-nature, exhausted defilements—these are different ways of describing the stability of awareness. Then the five wisdoms: mirror-like, sameness, discriminating, action accomplished—these are the natural functions of awareness when unobscured.

The secret four mind activities are crucial: abiding in non-dual clarity-emptiness clears the duality of samsara and nirvana. Abiding in non-dual appearance-emptiness performs the non-duality of object and wisdom. Abiding in non-dual awareness-emptiness performs the non-duality of apprehension and apprehender. Abiding in non-dual object-mind cuts the conceptual limit of subject-object. These are pointing directly to the heart of Dzogchen view—all dualities are dissolved in the recognition of awareness.
