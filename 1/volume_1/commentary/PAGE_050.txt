PAGE 50 COMMENTARY

Here Longchenpa describes the bodhisattva path in detail [2903-2961], the stages and grounds, the heat and patience and peak. You read this and think "I must achieve these stages!" But listen carefully—you who are always trying to get somewhere.

The path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the path of no-more-learning [2903-2902]—these are not places you arrive at. They are descriptions of how recognition deepens. When you first hear the teachings and feel inspired, you are on the path of accumulation. When you begin to practice consistently, the path of preparation. When you have a genuine glimpse of emptiness—even for a moment—the path of seeing opens.

But do not grasp at these as achievements! The bodhisattva who thinks "I have reached the first ground" has already fallen back. The grounds are not rungs on a ladder; they are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely you have released the illusion of a self who progresses.

The ten grounds themselves—Great Joy, Stainless, Luminous, Radiant, Difficult to Overcome, Manifest, Gone Afar, Immovable, Excellent Intelligence, Cloud of Dharma [2974]—describe the maturing of wisdom. Great Joy: initial recognition brings overwhelming happiness. Stainless: you no longer create new karma that binds. Luminous: wisdom shines clearly. And so forth, each ground dissolving deeper obscurations.

But hear this: you do not need to wait lifetimes to experience these! Right now, in this moment, can you rest in recognition? That is the ground of Great Joy. Can you do so without creating new grasping? That is Stainless. Is the recognition clear? That is Luminous. Do not postpone this!

The fruit—the eleventh ground of All-Illumination, the Dharma body and form bodies [2905-2913]—is not something you become in the future. It is what you already are, obscured by temporary clouds of confusion. The path is simply the clearing of those clouds. The sun does not need to be created; it only needs to be seen.

So practice the six perfections, the four immeasurables, the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment [2899-2902]. But practice knowing that the practitioner is already perfect, the practice is already complete, and the result has never been absent. This is the bodhisattva's secret: working tirelessly while knowing there is nothing to do.
