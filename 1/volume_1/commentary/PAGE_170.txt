Those complete glorious Vajradhara called (lines 45-46).

Now we enter the fifth chapter—the empowerment that is the gate to the unsurpassed vehicle. Listen! Without empowerment, there is no entry. Without the master, there is no empowerment.

The guru must be Vajradhara himself! Not in mere appearance, but in qualities. Six characteristics: abandon samsara's dharmas, few desires and content, skilled application with experience, skilled in tantra words and meanings, skilled in view with complete power, great compassion giving joy.

Do not seek empowerment from just anyone! The master must be qualified. Must have obtained empowerment, must apply the secret mantra meaning, must know outer and inner actions, must never be separate from the yidam, must not be distracted in meditation, must possess the oral instructions of great perfection.

And you, the student—do you have faith? Do you have devotion? The guru is the source of all qualities. The basis of perfect awakening. Without this recognition, empowerment is just ritual. With this recognition, every moment is empowerment.

Examine your master! Not with ordinary judgment, but with wisdom. Does he have these qualities? If yes, then he is glorious Vajradhara. If no, keep searching. Your liberation depends on this connection.
