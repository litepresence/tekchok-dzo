COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 253

Now we come to the pith of it, you who have wandered so long! At lines [10360-10363], Longchenpa speaks of self-enlightened, self-liberated, trace without childlike, fixation without. Do you hear what he is saying? You look for enlightenment like a man searching for his glasses while wearing them on his nose. You are already what you seek. Primordially enlightened Samantabhadra's intention—this is not some ancient Buddha from a distant time. This is your own mind right now, before you think "I am."

At lines [10364-10368], he says phenomena exhausted, primordially exhausted great. Anyone samsara not experience, samsara primordially exhausted. You hear this and you think "Then why do I suffer?" You suffer because you think you suffer. Samsara is not a place to escape. It is a label you put on experience when you grasp at it. When you stop grasping, where is samsara? Like a dream you wake from—did you destroy the dream? No, you simply realized it was a dream. The exhaustion here is not destruction. It is recognition.

At lines [10369-10378], he says awareness sufficient, non-awareness sufficient, existence sufficient, non-existence sufficient, good sufficient, bad sufficient, realization sufficient, non-realization sufficient. You read this and your mind spins. "How can non-realization be sufficient?" You want to pick and choose. You want to keep awareness and discard non-awareness. But look—can you have light without darkness? Can you have up without down? They are not two things. They are one thing seen from different angles. Sufficient means complete. It means nothing needs to be added, nothing needs to be removed.

At lines [10379-10383], phenomena existence not experience, anyone done not, done-to need not, non-existence-to mind fix not apply self-arisen. You think you must do something to realize this. You think you must practice, meditate, accomplish. But who is the doer? Where is the deed? To whom is it done? These three circles are empty from the start, like a sky flower. And mind that fixes on non-existence—that too is just another fixation. Let it be self-arisen, self-liberated.

At lines [10384-10391], trace dissolved, self-settled, wide-open, undecided decided, not-dissolved dissolved, not-vanished vanished, not-cleared cleared, not-taxed taxed-to arisen is. What is he saying? He is saying the opposite of everything you think. You think you must dissolve something, decide something, clear something. But in the nature of mind, dissolution and non-dissolution are the same. Vanishing and not-vanishing—where is the difference when you do not grasp at either?

Great Perfection, primordially liberated, spontaneously accomplished yoga—at line [10392]. This is not a practice to do. This is the recognition of what you already are. At lines [10393-10399], without-doing completed, without-going arrived, without-seeking found, without-accomplishing accomplished, without-abandoning purified. You hear this and you want to argue. "But I must do something!" Why? Who is this "I" that must do? Look for it. Can you find it?

At lines [10406-10417], he warns you: Crucial is but not understand. Realization sufficient but effort need. You hear the teachings and you think you understand. But your understanding is just another concept. You have the word-taste, not the real taste. You realize something, but it is just an extent, a measurement. You meditate, but it is mind-made, fabricated. You analyze, but it is duality-grasp. You accomplish, but it is just more samsara.

At lines [10415-10421], he asks: Still now dharmata's vast-expanse self where exist? Samsara from prior-mixing one-by not-transcended student-to, natural Great Perfection's karmic-connection one also come will. Phenomena exhausted self's appearance-to looked-by, mind exhausted alone joy lost. Action without dharmata's nature taken-by, hope-fear duality-grasp's defilement from liberated. Do you see? The dharmata is not somewhere else. It is not something you will find later. It is right here, but you miss it because you are looking for something special.

At lines [10422-10467], meditate sufficient, place sufficient, do sufficient, abandon sufficient. This is fix-limit dharma non-existent self-to. Stop looking for a method. Stop looking for a place to meditate. Stop looking for something to do or abandon. Just rest as you are. Is that so difficult? Yes, because "you" want to do the resting. Let even that go.
