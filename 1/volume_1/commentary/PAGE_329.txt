You want liberation? Here's the arithmetic of awakening. Pay attention—numbers don't lie.

Each single moment abides as the certain basis of body-speech-mind. Not eventually. Not after you die and become something else. Right now. This basis—this ground of being that you're always already standing on—is where liberation happens or doesn't happen. The gate isn't somewhere else. The gate is what you are when you stop looking for gates.

When empowerment and creation-completion are properly meditated—meaning when you're actually present in the transmission, not just going through motions—liberation becomes possible for whoever can receive it. That person is called the yogi. Not someone with credentials. Not someone with a title. The person who *does* it. Simple.

From the Entry to Yoga itself: the seed of yoga completes. The empowerment bestowal is certain. Transmission happens. Full stop. This isn't negotiation. The blessing doesn't depend on your worthiness—it depends on your openness. You were born with the connection. You just need to stop pretending you don't have it.

Now here's where most people get lost in the weeds. The text starts counting. Sixteen wisdoms. Sixteen syllables. Sixteen light-masses. Father principles, mother principles, gods of body-speech-mind multiplying into hundreds and then thousands. Numbers spiral outward like galaxy arms. Most readers drown here. They think they need to understand every category.

You don't. Let me translate: the inventory of what you are is vast beyond imagination. Four hundred thousand bodies' worth of potential. One hundred ten thousand hairs. Hundreds of thousands of syllables. Eighteen thousand specific phenomena arising from a single moment of basic awareness. Every thought pulses through one hundred twenty mental events per instant. This is not burden—this abundance. This is richness beyond anything you've ever chased.

Like Vishnu-turtle's form—vast, layered, sustaining everything. You carry a universe in here. A complete cosmology of body-speech-mind. When the counting stops feeling like homework and starts feeling like home, you're getting somewhere.

The gates are clear. The wind is present. The faculties are intact. The only question is whether you'll stop long enough to recognize what you've always had.

That recognition is the whole path. Everything else is commentary.

Silence now.
