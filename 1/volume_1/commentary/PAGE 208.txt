You who continue the postures! Lines 8630-8635 describe lion stance—foot toe press out push, action karma-tendency connection cut, lower curl upper hollow cast, body strength expand, eyes not move great bliss wisdom dwell. You press and expand! But this directs energy upward. Like a spring uncoiling—releases stored energy.

Bamboo stance at lines 8636-8639—body all shake, consort not dwell, bodhicitta bliss descend. You shake! But shaking releases. Like a tree in wind—flexes without breaking.

Channel key at lines 8640-8657—vital point, peg rope thread-like, wind up draw down push, body bliss expand, mind emptiness expand, outside consort channel release, inside enlightenment mind release. You push and draw! But this moves the energy. Like pumping water—up and down motion.

Enlightenment mind purify purpose at lines 8649-8661—channel release disease not arise, wind release samadhi arise, foot ground not touch walk able, body dust atom dust see, sky fly able, life sun moon equal. You accomplish powers! But they're side effects. Like warmth from fire—comes with the fire, not the goal.

Ultimate bodhicitta release at lines 8658-8661—transference special practice, consciousness other city enter. You transfer! But this is advanced practice. Like moving house—requires preparation.

Thus said at lines 8662-8667—Charnel ground house piled tantra, bodhicitta bindu purify, supreme common qualities, self mind whatever desire, certainly accomplish. You are promised accomplishment! But practice is required. Like a map—you must travel the path.
