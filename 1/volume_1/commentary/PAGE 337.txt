Here's where it all converges. Don't miss this.

From blood comes perception. From heat comes consciousness. From breath come formations. Depending on wind completing outward, feeling spreads through everything. Flesh generates channel. Channel generates wind. Wind generates both action and wisdom simultaneously. Action gathers samsara. Wisdom gathers nirvana. Same wind. Different result depending entirely on recognition.

The structure branches: blood generates lymph, lymph generates bindu, bindu generates five faculties. Faculties arise from five afflictions. Objects appear as five conditions. Past, present, future—all thought-collections gathered into one display. Samsara and nirvana arise from the same cause. The difference is not in the cause. The difference is in how you look at it.

Then comes the ultimate level. Four elements beyond convention:

White color greatly spreading—far-lasso water-lamp arises from earth channel. Red, greatly red—empty bindu lamp arises from water channel. Yellow, greatly yellow—pure space lamp arises from fire-wind channel. Green, greatly green—self-arisen wisdom lamp arises from wind channel.

Each lamp illuminates the same reality from a different angle. Self-arisen wisdom generates awareness. Far-lasso generates light. Bindu generates body. Space generates wisdom. The display is complete.

What sees all this? Far-lasso's dharmata directly seen. Empty bindu's experience fully present. Space awareness measuring everything. Self-arisen wisdom engaging dharmata exhausted—all appearances recognized as manifestations of wisdom itself.

From the eye-door wisdom arises. Actual engagement.

This is the end of the first chapter—eleven levels of how the body forms, how samsara constructs itself. Now the text shifts to particulars: channel, wind, bindu. Basis channel. Supported wind. Abiding bindu.

Three aspects of the same indivisible system.

You think you have a body that sometimes has spiritual experiences? The body is the spiritual experience. The channels are wisdom. The winds are wisdom. The bindu is wisdom.

Recognition is not adding anything. Recognition is not achieving anything. Recognition is stopping long enough to see what you've always been.

Rest now. The rest is recognition itself.
