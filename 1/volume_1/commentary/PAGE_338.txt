The three main channels. Pay attention. This is the architecture of your awareness.

From the Pearl Garland, all channels arise. Subtle. Quick. Essence possessing. Beautiful by their own light rays. Three divisions: right, left, middle. Not male and female in the ordinary sense—right and left refer to energy patterns, not gender. But the patterns do influence how you experience reality.

The three chief channels: Roma, Kyangma, Kun'darma. Every other channel branches from these three. These are not metaphors. These are literal pathways of energy and awareness running through your body right now.

Roma takes all tastes, like salt permeating everything. Depending on bindu's bliss, experiencing uncommon enjoyment—this is called taste. But the name also comes from desire-attachment being the cause. The one who possesses desire-attachment and depends on Roma becomes Buddha. Or, Roma is the channel of few actions, depending on bindu's confusion, experiencing enjoyment difficult to express—thus called ma. The syllables matter. The names are not arbitrary.

Within Roma moves the relative bindu, carrying method's nature.

Kyangma—the straight one. Not crooked, not branched. A clear hollow channel. Nature arising from both ultimate bindu and relative bindu as cause. From that cause, ultimate element and relative element mature and separate. Straight, thus unchanging. All's basis, thus called mo. Depending on this channel, without effort you become Buddha. That's what it says. Not through striving. Through recognition of what's already there.

Kun'darma—all gathering. Depending on this, bindu and channel's bliss and wind's bliss all arise. Thus ku. That pervading everything, thus darma. Kun'darma means the gathering of all phenomena into one expanse.

Where are these channels located? Roma coils from the navel's left side, all coils moving to the right. Kyangma exits from the heart peak's left, emerges from the throat channel's net, returns through the cranium's inside, opens the left eye door. Roma also flows from the right eye. Kun'darma—the all-gathering channel, present throughout.

You're not learning anatomy. You're mapping your own enlightenment. Every channel is a pathway to recognition. Every bindu is a point of wisdom. The structure is not blocking you. The structure is pointing you home.

No need to force anything. The channels are already clear. The winds are already moving. The bindu is already present.

Recognition is not doing. Recognition is resting in what's already the case.

Rest now. The rest takes care of itself.
