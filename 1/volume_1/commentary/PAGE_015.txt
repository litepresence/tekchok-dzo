[426-436] The second emanation continues—teaching the five tantras of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities during a lifespan of one hundred million years. These timeframes aren't historical! They're describing the duration of different phases of the teaching from the perspective of those dimensions. A "year" in Tushita heaven isn't the same as a year on earth.

Third emanation: At Heat-Moisture-Gathering surrounded by light, teacher Fear-Protecting Mind teaches Samsara Dong-sprugs, Peacock Jing-bsnol, and Four-Elements-Exhausted tantras. Each location, each teacher, each teaching has specific significance. The locations represent different aspects of the mandala. The teachers represent different qualities of enlightened mind. The tantras represent different approaches to recognition.

Fourth emanation: At Attachment-Arising womb appearing, teacher Virarati teaches mind-class root tantras five and branch tantras six. The "womb" here represents the source of manifestation—the matrix from which all appearances arise. Virarati represents the playful, energetic aspect of enlightenment that cuts through attachment not by rejecting it but by seeing through it.

Fifth emanation: At Amrapali's youth's garden, the sixth Vajradhara teaches the six paramitas to Buddhas succession seven. Amrapali was a famous courtesan who became a disciple of the Buddha—the garden represents the transformation of ordinary pleasure into the path. The six paramitas (generosity, ethics, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom) are the practices that accumulate merit and wisdom.

[437-461] Sixth emanation: At Meru's north, charnel-ground Raurava, teacher Hero Power Great teaches Rigpa Rangshar and direct-luminous tantras. Charnel grounds are traditionally associated with wrathful practice—confronting death and impermanence directly. The Rigpa Rangshar (Self-Arising Awareness) is a crucial terma text in the Dzogchen tradition.

Seventh emanation: At rakshasa land Ruru sound-possessing cave, teacher Furious King rsi teaches coarse-taming tantras. The rakshasas represent powerful negative forces—both outer and inner. The "coarse-taming" tantras are forceful methods for dealing with intense obstacles.

The pattern continues—each emanation addresses different beings in different locations with different teachings appropriate to their capacities. This is the principle of skillful means in action. The Buddha doesn't teach one thing to everyone; he teaches what each being needs to hear.
