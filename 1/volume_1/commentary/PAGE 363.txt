[15036-15064] Nadi-petals thirty-two, branched three-hundred sixty, smalllets two-thousand. Crown bliss chakra, extremely great nadis, three-hundred sixty complete. Wisdom nadi fifty, body thirty-eight, awareness twenty. All these numbers—where is the one who counts without counting?

[15065-15098] Dharma-sphere wisdom, mirror wisdom, equality wisdom, discriminating wisdom. Wind hold-means breath, fire hold-means warmth, water gather-means blood. Means and meanings—means for whom? The one without need.

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
