[3883]

You who would understand the tantras—attend! Lines 4211-4218: Meaning tantra and word tantra extensively explained. First: two—Method tantra, Nature tantra.

Two types of tantra: meaning tantra (what is indicated) and word tantra (how it is expressed). Within meaning tantra: method tantra (how to realize) and nature tantra (what is realized).

First, nature, lines 4219-4223: Awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment. Definite term: that same indicating meaning and realizing basis and liberating method, thus called indicated method tantra.

Awareness pervading all beings—this is the basis. Not something exclusive to Buddhas. Every being has this awareness. The mind of enlightenment—bodhicitta—is this very awareness when recognized.

Divided, lines 4224-4231: Emptiness, Clarity—two. Emptiness: awareness's nature, all empty of things and marked dharmas, primordially dwelling in great liberation from elaboration's end. Clarity: That too, not gone to the extreme of emptiness, self-illuminating five wisdoms' appearance. Warm, cool, light. Vast nature's chief great elements five, primordially spontaneously accomplished. Compassion's tone unceasing, arising as capacity, awareness primordially pervading.

Two aspects: emptiness and clarity. Not one without the other! Emptiness is the nature—empty of things, empty of marks. But not mere nothingness. Clarity—the self-illuminating appearance of the five wisdoms. Warm, cool, light—the felt sense of this clarity. The five elements spontaneously accomplished. Compassion unceasing.

That too, lines 4232-4246: Awareness clear-empty great wisdom pervading all beings, called indicated method tantra. From the Pearl Garland: All buddhas' method tantra, from the distinction of one basis nature, indicated and indicating. Indicated tantra, one, all-pervading. All that connected to its trace, pervading aspects two: pervading by emptiness, pervading by clarity.

Clear-empty—both! Not just empty, not just clear. Both simultaneously, naturally, without contradiction. This is the method tantra, pervading all beings. One basis nature—all share the same nature. Indicated and indicating—the truth that is pointed to, and the pointing itself.

One cause of emptiness, without thing, lines 4242-4256: Beyond all things' dharma. Things empty, without appearance, one-pervading. Becoming the basis of all, one nature. Pervading lord itself gathered. Birthless, memory exhausted. From the distinction of nature itself, empty and appearing, appearing and empty. Things, without things, also are. Exhausted, primordially dwelling in emptiness. Cause and condition separated, emptiness's object. Pervading vast, without thing, empty by nature. Without stain, unmixed, perfect. Thoughtless, empty nature, pervading by emptiness, thus called tantra.

Birthless—never born, never created. Memory exhausted—not that you forget, but that the concept of past, present, future loses its grip. Empty and appearing, appearing and empty—these are not different. Things are without things—appearances have no true existence.

Clear, nature unceasing, lines 4257-4269: Illuminating appearance, all-pervading. Clear, warm, cool. Vast, moving, nature holding. Pervading, primordial tone, self-clear. Liberating, ripening seed. Reverse from emptiness, clear pervading. Instant, self-liberation. Self-arising clarity, body connected. Without stain, particularly clear. Graspless, clear object appearing. Five doors' knowledge, self-clear, perfect. Body clear pervading, thus called tantra.

This is clarity—the active, knowing, luminous aspect. Not separate from emptiness, not different. Self-clear—knowing itself, aware of itself. Graspless—without grasping, without fixation. Five doors' knowledge—the wisdom of the five senses, perfected.

Thus, lines 4270-4271: Second, indicating method tantra: three. Now the tantra that indicates—the teaching, the instruction, the pointing itself.
