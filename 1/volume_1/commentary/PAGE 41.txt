PAGE 41 COMMENTARY

Listen, you who sit here reading these words about the world's formation! Longchenpa traces for you the arising of this human realm, this Jambu continent where you now find yourself [1344-1369]. But what use is knowing how beings emerged from light-eggs and gradually degenerated, unless you see your own mind's degeneration right now?

You think you are different from those ancients who lived eighty-thousand years, who ate essence of earth like honey, who needed no clothes because their own light radiated seven fathoms clear? Look at yourself! Your light has dimmed to almost nothing. You need lamps in daytime, heaters in warmth, layers of cloth to cover your shame. This is not merely a story of ancient history—this is the story of your own mind's wandering!

When those first beings fell from light into desire, from desire into grasping, from grasping into stealing and killing—do you not see yourself in each step? [1370-1396] Every moment your mind chases after pleasure, you fall further. Every time you grasp at "mine," you sink deeper into this swamp of existence.

Longchenpa describes the hells arising from anger accumulated [1413-1428]—but you don't need to wait for death to experience hell. Feel your own rage, that burning that consumes you from within! That is the Reviving Hell right here, right now. The Preta realm of endless hunger—you know this when your desires can never be satisfied, when you accumulate and hoard yet remain empty [1444-1445].

Do not read this as mythology. Read this as your own biography written across vast time. The degeneration of light into darkness is happening in every moment you forget your true nature.

This world you cling to—this Jambu continent famous as the action-ground where karma ripens [1344-1369]—is itself the display of your own deluded mind. The vessels and essences, the continents and hells, all arise from the three poisons you harbor in your breast. 

So what to do? Do not merely read. Look directly: Who is reading? What is this light that still knows, still sees, still understands these words? That knowing is itself the primordial radiance that never degenerated, never fell, never became clothed in flesh and karma. Rest there. Let the story of samsara be the story that points you back to what never entered the story at all.
