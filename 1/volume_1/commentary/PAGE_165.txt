This life, those arising in self-purity—specific numbers given. All buddhas arise from this secret great teaching's realm. Those who see the nature directly through awareness become buddhas. Nothing surpasses this.

Those who've met this teaching before, in former eons, gathered the power of accumulation. When they meet this teaching again, they quickly attain buddhahood. The result is certain. The heart of the result.

"O fortunate master, dharma-holder! Whether in this life, in the bardo, or in whatever emanation fields—buddhahood is quickly accomplished, definite. The cause is unfailing, the teaching pure, the result certain. Faith is the key."

"O fortunate master! Those who worshipped countless former buddhas, gathered in Samantabhadra's retinue—they're practicing the secret unsurpassed vehicle now. Even those who merely met the common vehicle before, accumulating virtue, worshipping buddhas—those who meet this uncommon teaching have special prior accumulations, practiced well before. The ground is prepared."

From Abhisamayalankara: the buddhas accomplished great deeds, planted virtue roots, protected by spiritual friends. You who hear this—you are the vessel.

Bardo liberation outcomes: among those who will manifest as buddhas between two births, within ten years—one thousand seven hundred will meet the appearance mother. One thousand six hundred males. One thousand one hundred females. Males, females, boys, girls—whoever meets this teaching, in whatever form, will be completely liberated.

This is the certainty: entered this teaching, received the guidance, obtained the instructions. Liberation is not uncertain.

Numbers again. Certainty again.

All buddhas come from this teaching. All liberation happens through this teaching. There's no other path that brings results like this.

If you've accumulated before, if you've met buddhas before, if you've practiced before—you're positioned. If this is your first encounter, it's still certain. The teaching works regardless.

What's required? Faith. Meeting the teaching. Receiving the instructions. Holding them.

That's all.

No more doubting. No more seeking elsewhere. This is it. The result is certain.
