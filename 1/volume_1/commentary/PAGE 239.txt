[9670-9684] Hundred eighty clairvoyances from devotion alone. You think you need to trek to India? Sit down. Look at your own mind. Devotion isn't bowing and scraping—it's the heat that melts fixation.

Elaboration-without empowerment. Extremely-elaboration-without. Completely-elaboration-without. Three stages, but really one: mind exhausting its own constructions.

[9685-9703] Secret-mantra's foundation is samaya. You want the fruit? Guard the root. Body, speech, mind—these three aren't yours to waste.

Samaya isn't rules from outside. It's the continuity of recognizing your nature. Break it and you've broken your own mirror.

The ground, path, result—three words pointing at one nature. Don't build walls between them.
