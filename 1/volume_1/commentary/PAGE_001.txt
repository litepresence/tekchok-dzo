[1-4] Look here, you who seek liberation! Before Longchenpa utters a single word of teaching, he first bows to the source of all—Samantabhadra. This is not mere politeness, like tipping your hat to a stranger. This is recognition that whatever you will read in these pages, whatever realization you might achieve, it all flows from this primordial awareness that has never been apart from your own mind. The title itself—"Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle"—is a direct pointing. Don't skim over it looking for the "real" teaching to begin later. This IS the teaching. The supreme vehicle is not some advanced course you take after graduating from lesser vehicles. It is the recognition that everything you've been searching for has been right here, from the very beginning.

[11-15] Ah, now look how the master bows to the fivefold mandala of enlightenment! Samantabhadra—the one whose nature holds all perfections—is not some distant god sitting on a throne judging your spiritual progress. He is your own awareness in its naked state, complete and lacking nothing. The five families, the vidyadharas, the ocean of Dharma—all of these are aspects of your own mind's display. When Longchenpa prostrates to them, he is showing you how to bow to your own true nature. Not with your forehead to the floor while your mind wanders to dinner plans, but with the recognition that prostrator and prostrated are not two.

[16-19] Here is the heart of it, my friends! "From the primordial pure"—gdod nas rnam dag—this is not describing some distant past when everything was nice and clean before things got messy. Primordial purity means right now, in this very moment, your awareness is untouched by all the conceptual constructions you've been carrying around like a backpack full of rocks. Where do all elaborations cease? Not in some future meditation retreat, not after you've fixed all your problems. They cease into space—into the open, unobstructed nature of mind itself. And this isn't something you achieve through effort or practice. It is "spontaneously accomplished"—lhun grub—meaning it has never been otherwise.

[20-27] Longchenpa now tells us why he's writing this text. Listen carefully! From the stainless sun of Dharma, the unsurpassed secret Vajra vehicle emerges—the very pinnacle of the Great Perfection. This is Ati Yoga, the most profound teaching. But don't let the fancy words fool you into thinking this is about complexity or sophistication. The Great Perfection is great because it is so simple, so immediate, that the mind keeps missing it while looking for something more complicated. "Revealing the essence of suchness directly"—this means pointing right at what you're experiencing NOW, without the filters of interpretation, judgment, or analysis. He's asking for protection of the lotus-throne of his mind. You should make the same request—for the recognition to remain stable in your own experience.

[28-35] Now the master begins the actual autocommentary. Notice how he explains the three kayas—the three bodies of enlightenment. This is crucial for understanding Dzogchen view. The Dharma-body (chos sku) is the nectar of reality itself—not a body in any physical sense, but the empty, luminous nature of all phenomena. The Enjoyment-body (longs sku) is the complete display of that nature in all its richness. The Emanation-body (sprul sku) is how that display manifests to benefit beings. But here's what you must understand: these are not three separate things, like three people in a room. They are three aspects of a single reality—like how water can be ice, liquid, or steam. The text explains that these are classified through the teacher, the place, and the teaching itself. Don't get lost in the classifications! They are fingers pointing to the moon of direct recognition.

[34-35] "The basis of perfect place, dharmata luminous-clarity"—this is ground zero, my friends. Everything that will be explained in this text rests upon recognizing this dharmata, this suchness, this luminous clarity that is the nature of your own mind. It is uncompounded—meaning it was never created and cannot be destroyed. It is spontaneously manifesting as the display of qualities in the precious realm. This isn't philosophy. This is a description of your own experience, right here, right now. Stop reading and look—what is aware of these words? That awareness is what Longchenpa is pointing to. Everything else in this text is just elaboration on this single point.
