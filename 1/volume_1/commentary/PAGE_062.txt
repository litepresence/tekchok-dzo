PAGE 62 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa enumerates the three hundred sixty mistaken views [2100-2164], and you must hear this as a warning! For every view listed here, there are beings who hold it, who believe it, who will die clinging to it as truth.

The hundred teachers [2107-2207]—Jyotiska, the grasper of the nonexistent, Life, the leaf-possessor, Vishnu, and all the rest—each represents a way that the conceptual mind tries to capture reality. And each fails! Not because reality is beyond capture, but because there is nothing to capture. The net is cast into empty water.

Some speak of permanence [2208]. Some speak of impermanence [2209]. Some speak of both [2210]. From these, the views multiply endlessly. For every assertion, there is a negation. For every philosophy, there is a counter-philosophy. This is the nature of conceptual mind—it divides, it opposes, it debates endlessly.

The tirthikas of various wrongnesses [2084-2092]—Kani and jealousy, Bhasira and Kabisha, Sindhara and Dhasim, and all the rest—these are not just ancient Indians! They are your own mind's tendencies. When you feel jealousy, you are Kani. When you grasp at philosophical positions, you are Bhasira. When you think meaning is utterly nonexistent, you are Sindhara.

And the sixty branches [2246-2283]—the Samkhyas with their atoms and darkness, the Vaisesikas with their minute atoms, Kumaralabha saying mind is nonexistent, Karnaputra holding appearance as permanent—these debates continue today! Only the names have changed. Philosophers still argue about whether reality is material or mental, whether consciousness emerges from matter or matter from consciousness.

But all of them miss the point! They are like people arguing about the color of the hat of someone who doesn't exist. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. When you search for the grasper, the searcher, the philosopher—where is it? In the brain? In the mind? In the heart? Search thoroughly, and you find nothing solid, nothing stable, nothing that persists.

This "nothing found" is not nihilism. It is the doorway to recognition. Not finding a self, you need not construct a non-self. Simply rest in the openness of not-finding. That is freedom from all three hundred sixty views and the countless others not named.
