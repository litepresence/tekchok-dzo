From short commentary also, established by called all god races come near. Then manner of expanding to form realm—when passed twenty-thousand leagues below from sky without end.

You see how the fall begins? From the highest formless realm, one passes down through the lower formless realms, and then, twenty thousand leagues below the lowest formless, one enters the form realm. The form realm is higher than the desire realm, more refined, but it is still below the formless. It is still within samsara.

To sky called jewel ornament various arrangement, five lights clearly appear without outside inside, by becoming one expanding mass of above consciousness. This is the highest form realm, where the five lights dawn—white, red, yellow, green, blue. The lights appear without distinction of outside and inside because the duality of perceiver and perceived has not yet fully re-emerged. It is the unity of consciousness, expanding as light.

Immeasurable expand everywhere clearly possessing light mouth eye ear, do move fly hover etc. by wind power. The beings here have bodies of light, with organs of perception made of light. They move by wind—by the subtle energy that animates the form realm. They fly, they hover, free from the heaviness of desire realm bodies. But they still move. They still go somewhere. They are still not at rest.

That also below compared to above formless, above all desire form, exist above, not below, called "below not" or "below not," exist at peak of all form possess. This is the highest form realm, called "below not" because there is nothing below it within the form realm. It is the peak of form. But remember—it is still below the formless. It is still within the world-system.

That also distinguish difference from limitless four ayatana concentration consciousness emanation body eye consciousness common not seen. This like picture form or rainbow form, become outside light body to clear consciousness. The bodies in the form realm are not seen by ordinary eye consciousness. They are like pictures, like rainbows—appearing but without substantial existence. They are light bodies, clear consciousness taking form.

Body six thousand leagues, life lasts six thousand interval eons. Vast, yes, but measurable. Limited. Temporary.

Then the descent continues through the form realms. Extremely see—cause exceed joy when one sees. Excellent appearance—measuring mark exceeding below. Not sorrow—no sorrow to those arisen joy bliss appearance. Not great—desire attachment to appearance not great. Each stage lower, the joy diminishes slightly, the attachment to form increases slightly, but they are still form realm gods, still absorbed in concentration, still free from gross desire.

These five place classes, without some affliction trace, called five pure class gods, five other noble places. The five pure abodes are special—they are realms where beings go who have attained the state of non-returner. They will not fall back to lower realms. They will achieve liberation from there. But they are still in the form realm. They still have subtle form. They are not yet fully liberated.

Above ordinary beings' three other places—great fruit, merit born, cloud without light. These are lower form realms, achieved by lesser virtue. Great fruit because they established great virtue. Merit born because arisen from accumulated merit. Cloud without light because they are like clouds obscuring the sun—their virtue is not yet brilliant.

Body sizes decrease as we go down—five hundred leagues, two hundred fifty, hundred twenty-five. Life spans decrease correspondingly. What was vast becomes less vast. What seemed almost infinite becomes measurable. This is the nature of the form realm. It is refined, but it is still conditioned. It is still impermanent.
