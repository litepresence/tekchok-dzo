[14003-14006] Listen, dear practitioner! Look at your own body—this very flesh and bone. When pure, it ripens into Buddha's body, speech, and mind. When impure, it ripens into your ordinary body, speech, and mind. Do you see the difference? It is only the presence or absence of confusion! Mistaken view opens the door for the three poisons to arise. Drop the mistake, and where is the impurity?

[14007-14009] Now, this ro ma channel—taste channel, they call it. When you press it, supreme flavor arises like the best food! But leave it alone, and it is like dead flesh—useless. What does this teach you? Use it or lose it! Engage with the dharma, taste the practice. Let it sit idle, and you are a corpse walking.

[14010-14015] This channel runs on the right side for men, left for women. But wait! Some tantras reverse this. Why? To break your rigid certainty! You think you know where things are? The dharma smashes your maps. Certainty is the disease—doubt cut through is the cure. The rkyang ma—solitary channel—when pressed, gives birth to experience free from conceptual thought. Left alone, it stays isolated, unrelated to others, standing alone like a hermit in the mountains. For men it is on the left, for women on the right. Do not cling to positions!

[14016-14020] The kun 'dar ma—central channel, all-shaking—dwells between male and female sides. Press it, and wisdom clarity experience arises! It is the maintainer of your body, speech, and mind. These three channels are the basis of all channels, therefore called "ma"—the mothers. Everything arises from them.

[14021-14027] Now listen closely! When ro ma comes to the right side of a man, it produces bodhicitta—the mind of enlightenment. But in a woman's left, it gathers and swells the bodhicitta, never satisfied with desire. When rkyang ma comes to a man's left, it holds the power of blood emission—the nosebleed marks the time of wisdom! Do you see? Your very fluids are the dharma.

[14028-14034] On a woman's right side, this divides into the five sense channels, source of diseases men never know—this is the difference of constitution. Dark complexion, short thick body, good teeth, round face—these mark the deer-channel, the main one. Like the antler of a stag, thick at the root with much desire, thin at the tip—actual bodhicitta cannot emerge! Here, if you make the thigle's key point into the path, the instruction on channel movement is supreme. Fair complexion, thin body, straight hair—know these signs.

Emaho! Your body is the mandala!
