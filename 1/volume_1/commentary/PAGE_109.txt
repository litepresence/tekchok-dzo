You who would take experience—attend! Lines 4319-4327: Body and speech slack, free from suffering. Awareness slack, five bodies arise. Awareness arisen, conditions cease. Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease. Thus indicated method's tantra. Self's tantra, unproduced and perfected. Indicating, thus method is. Dwelling in the stream, thus called tantra. Thus.

Body and speech slack—not tense, not controlled, relaxed. Free from suffering—when you relax completely, suffering has no hold. Awareness slack—don't try to hold awareness, don't grasp at it. Five bodies arise—the kayas manifest naturally.

Awareness arisen, conditions cease—when awareness is recognized, the conditions of samsara lose their power. Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease—the duality of external world and internal mind dissolves.

Thus indicated method's tantra. Self's tantra—your own nature, unproduced (never created), perfected (already complete). Dwelling in the stream—flowing naturally, like a river to the ocean.

Second, nature's tantra, lines 4328-4336: The meaning of basis, path, and fruition. From that same: Basis, path, fruition, determined holding, nature's tantra. Thus. This essence: Empty-clear awareness's essence, basis, path, and fruition gathered. Definite term: pervading all, accomplishing buddha-nature, thus called nature's tantra.

Nature's tantra—the tantra of what is, the fundamental nature. Basis, path, and fruition—three aspects of the same thing, not three separate things. Empty-clear awareness—empty (no form), clear (knowing), awareness (cognizant). Pervading all—present in every being, every phenomenon.

Divided, lines 4337-4346: Basis, Essence, Quintessence nature's tantra—three. Basis nature's tantra: the first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion—three. That too: essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent. Delusion imputed only, not experienced. Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear. Compassion all-pervading, manifesting, unceasing. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.

Three levels: basis, essence, quintessence. Kadag (ka dag)—primordial purity. Awareness, nature, compassion—three aspects of basis. Essence primordially pure—never stained. Delusion imputed only—not real, just imputed. Nature spontaneously accomplished—not made, not created. Awareness light-clear—luminous, knowing. Compassion all-pervading—manifesting for all beings.

Essence nature's tantra, lines 4347-4362: Primordial wisdom three-stacked, in the heart-essence manner, arisen—basis nature's tantra, that power, basis appearance, eye, four lamps arisen. The path's four appearances actually seen. Quintessence nature's tantra: Awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened. That too: essence empty, marks awareness non-gone. Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established. Empty self-appearance arisen, cut, cut-off non-existent. Empty-clear, indivisible—that awareness's quintessence. That too: measured, ripened, quintessence gathered, thus called.

Primordial wisdom three-stacked—stacked in the heart center. Four lamps arisen—four aspects of inner light. Four appearances—on the path, you actually see these. Quintessence—the most refined, the essential point. Essence empty, marks awareness non-gone—not that awareness goes away, but its marks, its characteristics, are seen through.

Clarity three and... [text continues]

You see, the tantra goes deeper and deeper, more and more refined. But all of it is pointing to what is already present: your own nature, clear, empty, aware. Do not be intimidated by the terminology. Look at your own mind—that is the tantra, that is the teaching, that is the path and the result.
