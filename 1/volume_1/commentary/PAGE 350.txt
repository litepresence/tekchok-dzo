[14270-14273] From gathering: form large but strength weak, limbs thin. From gathering-release: form small but strength endowed. From mindfulness projection: mind clear, senses clear, discrimination without coarseness. From gathering: discrimination large and forgetful.

Listen! It is not what you have but how you hold it. Gather too much, and even a strong body becomes weak. Release with awareness, and even a small form becomes powerful.

[14274-14283] From gathering: senses clear, mind clear, forgetful. From flying projection: discrimination large yet meditation quickly arises. From pure taste projection: speech pleasant, words clear, sounds skillful. From gathering: speech unpleasant. From impure increase: pleasant speech, great eloquence, yet speech powerless. From pure tip projection: mind pure, aspirations accomplished. From impure increase: mind's good accomplished yet virtue not increased. From gathering: mind's desires not accomplished, mindfulness and meditation reversed. From pure: mind's desires not accomplished yet virtue increased. This is the certainty of gathering-releasing.

[14284-14293] Also, the reason for the certainty of four wheels: One and two do not ripen empowerments, path, and final results; three also does not ripen; reverse certainty also makes four. The sequence of what joins and what joins—harmonious certainty also makes four. Outer four elements, inner four wisdoms, secret four lamps, unsurpassed four kayas—certain, therefore four wheels. True body, speech, mind, mind—four. Purifying four empowerments, pure four results—certain, therefore four wheels as basis.

[14294-14302] Second, explaining the individual enumerations of four wheels: navel emanation wheel, heart dharma wheel, throat enjoyment wheel, crown great bliss wheel. First has four: general enumeration, individual limb explanation, particular key points shown.

Emaho! Your body is the mandala of four wheels! Gather and release with wisdom!
