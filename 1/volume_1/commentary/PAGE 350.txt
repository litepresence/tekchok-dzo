[14270-14276] Gathering form great but strength weak, leaping form small but strength possessing. You analyze the vessel to find the essence? The essence has no form to analyze.

[14277-14283] Voice sweet, voice unpleasant, mind pure, intention complete—all these are attributes of the dream. Wake and tell me: what voice did you hear in the natural state?

[14284-14289] Four wheels' certainty, elements four, wisdom four, lamp four. Counting to infinity will not find the one who counts. Stop counting. Look at what looks.

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
