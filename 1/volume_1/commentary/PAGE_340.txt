The body is not built from outside in. It's woven from inside out.

Blood becomes flesh. Flesh becomes tendon. Tendon becomes lymph. Lymph becomes fat. Fat becomes bone. Bone becomes marrow. Marrow becomes sinew. Sinew matures into relative bindu. Every stage dependent on the one before. Every part carrying the whole.

Kyangma's knot generates the far-lasso water-lamp's seed—two shining pupils. The eyes don't just see. They carry the lamp of awareness itself. Within memory, wisdom self-arisen lamp's support lives—fire bindu radiating. The fire isn't burning you. The fire is illuminating what you already are.

Within taste, space pure support—five lights as bindu, like a sesame seed with a rim, containing all colors. Within the peak, empty bindu support—light bindu appearing in whatever colors arise. Depending on that, ultimate wisdom arises directly, not flowing anywhere else. Depending on that, you are Buddha by nature. This is why it's called nature's bindu—the support of pure doors, four lamps, from which all four elements arise unpolluted.

The middle channel, Kun'darma, gathers all channels' nature. Wind's throwing and gathering causes the trembling. This is the basis of samsara and nirvana—hence called ma. From this arises ultimate dharmata's bindu as cause. When Kun'darma's knot generates, it produces the body support—sesame seed-sized light appearing as face and hands, clearly present.

Within memory lives wisdom's mansion: four doors, four horse-tethers, individual deity forms with colors and hand attributes, complete mandalas wherever they appear. This is not fantasy. This is your mental landscape, mapped in divine form.

Within the peak lives all light's support—wrathful mandala, the fierce face of compassion that doesn't flinch from anything.

From the middle: blood and lymph absent, emptiness and openness are wind's action. From the right: water, blood, and bodhicitta moving—this is bindu's action. From the left: elemental clarity and wisdom moving—this is channel's own action.

The structure is complete. The mapping is finished. What remains is recognition.

You're not building a Buddha. You're recognizing one. The channels are clear. The knots are present. The bindus are shining. The mandalas are complete.

Rest in the recognition. The rest is already finished.

Silence now. The silence is the point.
