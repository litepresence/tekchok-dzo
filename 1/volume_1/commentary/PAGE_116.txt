You who would complete the enumeration—attend! This page continues the enumeration of the seventeen tantras, describing how each is shown, what its special quality is.

The introduction-adorning tantra of the mirror, line 4517: Shown applying meaning to the example of images within a mirror. Just as images appear in a mirror without the mirror being changed, so all appearances arise in the mind without the mind being stained. This is the nature of display—appearing, yet empty. Present, yet not real.

The pearl-garland tantra, line 4518: Shown as instruction collected like a beautiful pearl garland. Instructions gathered, strung together, beautiful and precious. Each instruction a pearl, the whole tantra a garland adorning the practitioner.

[Note: Page 116 appears to be a continuation of the enumeration from page 115. The liturgical text shows the listing of the seventeen tantras and their descriptions. The commentary emphasizes that each tantra is a unique expression of the same truth—your own nature, clear and free.]

The seventeen tantras are not different teachings. They are one teaching expressed in seventeen ways. Like one face seen in seventeen mirrors—each reflection slightly different, but all showing the same face.

Do not think "I will study all seventeen tantras and then I will understand." Understanding is not the goal. Recognition is the goal. The tantras are fingers pointing at the moon. Use them to find the moon, then the fingers are no longer needed.

But while you are searching, use every finger you can find! Read the tantras with devotion. Contemplate their meaning. Practice their instructions. Gather the accumulations. Purify the obscurations. And most importantly: recognize your own nature. This is the essence of all seventeen tantras.
