PAGE 66 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa lists the various tirthika teachers and their names [2376-2396]—Kani-pa, Sersnawa, Sambhari, Kabhisha, Sindha, Dhasimba, Katipa, Sangha, Shamkari, Doshaka—and you must not dismiss these as merely historical!

Kani-pa: those who wish for meaning indifferently [2376]. Are you not sometimes this? You want awakening, but you want it casually, without urgency, without commitment. You practice when convenient, when you feel like it, when it doesn't interfere with other desires. This is indifference, and it leads nowhere.

Sersnawa: possessed of suffering, fearing diminished appearances and emptiness [2376]. This is you when you approach the teachings! You want liberation, but you are terrified of what you will lose. You want to transcend the ego, but you cling to its comforts. The fear of emptiness paralyzes you, keeps you circling the teaching but never entering.

Kabhisha: those who think neither special meaning nor common meaning exists [2381]. This is the nihilist again, denying all significance, all purpose. If neither ordinary life nor spiritual practice matters, why do anything? This view leads to paralysis, to depression, to the rejection of all effort.

Sindha: those who think common meaning nonexistent, yet special meaning exists [2381]. This is spiritual elitism! You reject ordinary life while grasping at spiritual achievement. You become a practitioner who looks down on "worldly" people, who believes your path makes you superior. This pride is worse than worldly vanity.

And so on, through Dhasimba who thinks meaning utterly nonexistent, Katipa who thinks meaning exists until breath is cut, Sangha who thinks entering the Sangha's feature is sufficient [2381-2392]. Each represents a way that mind limits itself, creates a box, and calls it the truth.

The truth of compounded impermanence, the truth of life-force and lordship [2392-2396]—these are the alternatives offered, the correct views that lead to liberation. But even these can be grasped! Even the four seals can become a new prison if you hold them rigidly.

The point is not to find the right view among all these. The point is to see through viewing itself. When the viewer is seen as empty, all views—right and wrong, correct and mistaken—are simultaneously liberated into their true nature.
