[9766-9773] Four gurus: yourself engaging dharmas' guide-guru, samaya and vows giving empowerment-guru, instructions extracting oral transmission-guru! From that: "To gurus also four purposes: general, guide, samaya empowerment, oral transmission guru."

[9774-9785] Guru and student's definitive term also from that: "Definitive term thus: not knowing, knowing-liberation purpose—learn (*slob*); Great Perfection meaning engaging—guide (*dpon*). Student's definitive term thus: non-distracted manner listening—learn (*slob*); instruction vessel becoming—student (*ma*). Thus meaning-fulfilled guru-student properly dwell equally in the ground. Possessing samaya, it is thus."

Do you see? Guru isn't someone outside—you're both learning and guiding yourself! The student who listens without distraction becomes the vessel. The guru who points to your nature is your own recognition! Emaho!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
