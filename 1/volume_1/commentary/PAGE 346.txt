[14138-14144] Left side doubt, tip change suffering, slip mind light, open mouth effort. These are signs for doctors, not for yogis. You want to heal channels? Heal the grasping at "this is left, this is right."

[14145-14146] Body by channel, channel by speech, speech by mind, mind by dharmata, dharmata by yogi. Who is the yogi? The one who sees this chain has no links.

[14147-14156] Five channels' actions—lamp radiance, upward throw, downward drip, ultimate mind shown, relative bindu descends. All of this is display. The displayer has no form.

[14157-14170] Man actual descended, woman covered dwell, menstruation descend, element point time. Blood and bindu moving—who sees the movement? That seer does not bleed.

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
