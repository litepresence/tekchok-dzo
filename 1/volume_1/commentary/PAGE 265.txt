COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 265

You who look for completion! Longchenpa tells you at lines [10865-10871] that appearance all time one at complete, wisdom all moment at complete, body all mature abide, light appearance all not-obscured clear. But you say "I am not complete. I need to practice more, understand more, realize more." Foolish! The completion is not something you achieve. It is the nature of things as they already are. Every appearance is complete. Every moment of wisdom is complete. The body that you have right now—do you think it needs to become some rainbow body to be complete? It is already the mature abiding of the kayas. You just do not see it.

At lines [10869-10876], actual-state appearance at, appear method not-obscured essence nature compassion three uninterrupted completely complete great. Essence actual-state great that also body-as abide and, mouth eye ear at desire is at-all not-abide. Empty-as abide bebs empty-as at-all not-abide. You think the kayas are somewhere else, in some pure land, wearing ornaments of gold and jewels. But the actual state appears without obscuration right here. The essence is great, and it abides as the body—not "as" the body in the sense of becoming the body, but the body itself is the display of that essence. And in that display, there is no abiding in the mouth, eye, ear, desire. It is empty, yet not abiding in emptiness. Like a bird flying through the sky—it does not abide anywhere, yet it flies.

At lines [10877-10891], light five-as appearance great at, color divide is at-all not-abide, uninterrupted appear relate-as at-all not-abide, end middle not-exist-as focus and, direction at focus is at-all not-abide, part by-means-of not-stain-as appear and, category divide is at-all not-abide. You want to understand the five lights. You want to see white, red, yellow, green, blue as separate things. But they are not divided. They appear, yes—vast as space, clear as crystal, unmixed yet not separated. And they do not abide in categories. You cannot put them in boxes.

At lines [10892-10906], nose five itself-as abide color not-hold great, round shape not-exist, not-cease condition not-exist, pervade not-exist self-resonance great. Self-clear outside inside together, effort accomplishment not-exist bebs accomplish. This self-resonance, this self-clearing—it is not something you do. It happens by itself. Inside and outside are together, not two. And effort? What effort is needed to accomplish what is already accomplished?

At lines [10901-10906], clear darkness not-exist, not-cease not-exist great, bebs empty all arise great, not-mixed completely appear great, all pervade one gather great, pure confusion not-cease great. You think there is darkness to clear away, cessation to achieve. But in the great nature, there is no darkness. There is no cessation. All arise from emptiness, yet they are not mixed—they appear completely, purely. Confusion and purity do not cease—they are both great displays of the same nature.

So stop trying to clear the darkness. Stop trying to make things cease. Let appearances arise. Let them be not-mixed yet completely apparent. Let them pervade and gather into one. This is the great play of your own nature. Can you just let it be? That is the only practice. That is the only completion.
