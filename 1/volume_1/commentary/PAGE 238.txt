[9623-9641] Thirty-two marks—where do they arise? From purification. You think Buddha is someone with good bones, handsome face? Wrong. These marks bloom when view is purified.

Six clairvoyances—they're not magic. They're mind cleared of obstruction. See through the world's play without grasping.

[9642-9669] Liberation clairvoyances—body outflow exhausts first. What does this mean? Your fixation on form dissolves. Then speech. Then mind. Layer after layer, like peeling an onion that has no center.

Thirty-two Buddha qualities—these aren't ornaments. They're what remains when confusion self-liberates.

Mind's nature doesn't change. Mind's display changes endlessly. Know the difference or wander in samsara's maze forever.
