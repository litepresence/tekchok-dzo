[16214-16235] Listen well, practitioner! Look at your own mind—desire, dullness, hatred, attachment, clinging, ignorance—these arise from causes and conditions, essence and particulars. The moving mind, grasping and holding, chases past, future, and present like a dog chasing its tail. This movement creates samsara's karma, maturation, and results! Mindfulness and latent tendencies—various causes and conditions, many actions—thus we label mind. Some say mind is one, enough with that label; others say divisions are improper. Call it mental events, gather as one—enough! Fifty-one divisions, not improper, all equal. Division and gathering depend on parts, no contradiction. [16236-16255] Now hear the wondrous! The lamp of pure space, completely pure—this is your own nature! Light and form arise from gathering, five colors pervading, dark-blue, unchanging, surrounded by vajra fence, grasped by vajra chain with no place to escape. Inside, light-forms emanate rays—this very bardo of dharmata, cut through it and perfect buddhahood manifests! Light appears upward-standing, side-arising, rim-appearing—delusion self-ceases, wisdom clears! From these, light layers, fragments, partial breaks appear, outer and inner space mix, wisdom with no interval. Eye-webs, eye-many, eye-lines, nets, half-nets, flowers, thousand-petaled lotus, house-fire, tent-house under thatch—these appear as reality's display, made into the path! Four lamps determine the four path-appearances' measure. With the snare of distance, see dharmata directly, reverse from holding philosophical positions. Look! This is the direct path, the immediate recognition!
