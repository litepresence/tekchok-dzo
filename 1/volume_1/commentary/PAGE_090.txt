You who would complete the path—listen! Lines 3451-3453: Eighth: The scripture anuyoga vehicle. Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual, free from elaboration, not abiding in any extreme. Accomplishing through the main door of completion stage wisdom.

Now we enter Anuyoga, the second of the inner tantras. While Mahāyoga emphasized the generation stage—visualizing deities, mandalas, pure perception—Anuyoga emphasizes the completion stage, the dissolution of all such constructs into the expanse of primordial wisdom.

Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual—what does this mean? The expanse (dbyings) is the emptiness aspect, the space-like nature of mind. Primordial wisdom (ye shes) is the clarity aspect, the knowing quality. These two are not separate! Like the sun and its light—can you have one without the other?

Divided: Scripture and sūtra—two, lines 3454-3459. The scripture relying on scripture, wishing the arising of mind and mind, expressing scripture. The sūtra, not wishing words and conventions as basis.

The great anuyoga vehicle of the extensive lineages, lines 3473-3492: Twofold aspect—expanse and primordial wisdom, desiring vajra of non-dual/non-separation. Entry through gate—instantaneous-by/with gradual. View-of-realization—non-dual/non-separation. What-is—instantaneous entry. Deities undeGenerated, essence recalled, by/with perfection.

Here is the profound point: In Anuyoga, you realize that expanse and wisdom have never been separate. It is not that you first meditate on emptiness, then on clarity, then blend them. No! They are primordially non-dual. Your recognition of this is the view.

The samaya of protection, lines 3484-3490: Secret mantra meaning-teacher always honor shall. Secret mantra teacher-of master-to, whatever-accumulated-by offering proffer. Master and thus such-one-gone, distinction-without one-of essence shown. Briefly: expanse and primordial wisdom. Great anuyoga established view.

The guru is paramount in Anuyoga. Not because the guru is some external god, but because the guru introduces you to your own nature. The guru points out what you have been unable to see, like a finger pointing at the moon. Do not mistake the finger for the moon!

Lines 3496-3512: The liberation basis is expanse and primordial wisdom. Created dharma and striving accomplishment and non-transfer, emptiness beyond thought, separation expanse dwelling, self-arising primordial wisdom by/with arisen. All dharmas basis-establishment self-liberation great-by realized. Effortless self-liberation expanse and primordial wisdom called.

Effortless self-liberation! This is the key phrase. In Mahāyoga, there was effort—generating deities, maintaining pure perception, practicing the three concentrations. In Anuyoga, you realize that liberation has never required effort because bondage was never real!

Like a rope mistaken for a snake—you suffer fear until someone points out "it is just a rope." Your self-grasping, your afflictions, your samsara—they are like that snake. Never truly existed. Effortlessly liberated when recognized.
