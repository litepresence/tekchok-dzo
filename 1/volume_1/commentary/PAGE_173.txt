The connection between master and student! This is the living dharma. Master sees student with compassion, urgently benefiting, caring for dharma even more than food and drink. Student thinks of guru's qualities with continuous longing and devotion.

Compassion connection—not cut! Longing continuous. This is the true connection. Not just receiving empowerment and disappearing. Day and night, six sessions, supplicating.

Before entering, prepare! Five or seven or three years serving guru. Offering gold mandala equal to your own age. Requesting permission, supplicating properly. Not suddenly entering! Not without invitation!

And the master—when you request, he removes obstacles, purifies sins, meditates day and night six sessions, then grants permission. This is the tradition. This is how ripening occurs.

Body ripens as deity kaya. Speech ripens as ali kali self-sound. Mind ripens as emptiness meditation without face. Three doors ripened through proper connection. Do not rush! Do not think you can skip steps. The traditional way is the fast way. Trying to go fast without foundation is the slow way—if it works at all.
