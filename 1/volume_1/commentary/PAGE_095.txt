COMMENTARY ON PAGE 95 - Patrul Rinpoche

You who seek to understand space—attend! Lines 3706-3717: Mind's direction grasping. Mind's category grasping. Mind's essential-point grasping three-in gathered. Second result primordial-liberation speaking great-perfection space's category's essence. Existence various-in arisen without result primordially-pure desired. This-on division four: space black causeless speaking; space variegated various speaking; space white mind speaking; space vast cause-result applied.

The grasping of mind's direction, mind's category, mind's essential point—these three are gathered. Now we speak of the result of primordial liberation, the essence of the Great Perfection's Space Category.

Without arising in various existence, the result is primordially pure. Four divisions: Black Space, causeless; Variegated Space, various; White Space, mind; Vast Space, cause-result applied.

Black-space's essence, lines 3717-3724: Unchanging self-perfect directionless arisen phenomena-nature-on not relying. Division activity black-space's category; compassion black-space's category; emanation black-space's category—three. First: Arisen various causeless arisen appearance signless appeared. That also arisen-place-from empty-on appeared liberated samsara-nirvana nameless. That also is-not extremes definitive reasoning-by great-perfection extremes beyond view established.

Black Space is unchanging, self-perfect, directionless arisen—not relying on phenomena-nature. Three categories: activity, compassion, emanation. Arisen variously, causelessly, signlessly. Appeared from the empty arisen-place, liberated, samsara and nirvana nameless. Is-not definitive by reasoning—Great Perfection view established beyond extremes.

Second, lines 3726-3729: Arisen primordial-wisdom is knowing other-on not relying. Liberated mind is cause-conditions applied. Arisen-liberated non-dual abiding result primordially liberated. That also similar-appearances self-pure definitive reasoning-by great-perfection appearance-from liberated desired.

Arisen primordial wisdom is knowing, not relying on other. Liberated mind—cause and conditions applied. Arisen and liberated, non-dual abiding, the result is primordially liberated. Similar appearances, self-pure, definitive by reasoning—Great Perfection is liberated from appearance.

Third, lines 3731-3735: Free from the extremes of is and is-not, beyond directional fixation, self-nature without reliance, causeless, primordially pure—beyond fabrication and correction, through primordial liberation the great expanse beyond extremes is set forth. The great primordial wisdom of self-purified abiding, liberated from the beginning, is called "the exhaustion of self-basis."

Free from is and is-not, beyond fixation, causeless, primordially pure—beyond fabrication and correction. This is primordial liberation, the exhaustion of self-basis. You do not create this; you do not achieve it. It is how things have always been!

This too, line 3735: Through the reasoning that engages deluded mind, is intended as self-liberation. Even the reasoning that seems to engage the deluded mind is actually pointing to self-liberation. Like a thorn used to remove a thorn—once the job is done, both are discarded.

The essence of the variegated space, lines 3736-3743: Speaking of manifold existence. Free from negation, directionless, self-arising everywhere. In spontaneous play, beyond affirmation and negation, this is intended. These divide into three: Assertion of existence corresponds to the Mind School; assertion of non-existence corresponds to the Self-Essential Point; assertion of both corresponds to Supreme Instruction.

Variegated space—manifold existence, free from negation, directionless, self-arising. Beyond affirmation and negation. Three assertions: existence (Mind School), non-existence (Self-Essential Point), both (Supreme Instruction). These are not contradictory positions but different ways of pointing to the same recognition.
