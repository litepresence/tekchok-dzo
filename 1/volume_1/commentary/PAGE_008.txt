[265-272] Listen! The teacher with five perfections: arising, abode, retinue, time, and body complete. Thus born as supreme perfection, in the field Perfection Rich, abode Perfection at Tushita, to retinue Perfection, gods with life. At the time Perfection when the six beings' views ripen. Teaching the unexcelled vehicle. Through accomplishing benefit for self and other, wheel of inexhaustible ornament body, speech, and mind.

[273-279] Thus also, among the thousand and two Buddhas of this good kalpa, at the time of those five perfections. The teacher was born at the royal palace. Abode Perfection at Tushita. Retinue Perfection, gods with life. Time Perfection when beings' views ripen. Teaching Perfection, three baskets and outside.

Dear practitioner, understand this! The Buddha does not just appear—he appears with perfect conditions. Five perfections complete! This shows you that enlightenment requires the right field, the right time, the right retinue. But do not think these are separate from you—your own mind has these five perfections primordially complete. Recognize this!

Emaho! Five perfections—complete in your own mind!
