[16181-16213] Empty effort beyond action accomplish wisdom free, emptiness one mandala not-move dharma space wisdom gather, elaboration free wisdom. Lamp knowledge gather wisdom, abandon not reality extreme-limit free worldly knowledge, basis abandon not-need correct reality establish not transcend knowledge. Not-fabricate free root see knowable gather, clear-light directly see view gather, object aspect how-many see omniscience. Wisdom self-arising lamp knowledge, movement mindfulness thought contemplation. Movement wind mind movement, mind movement six.

[16214-16235] Afflictions mind movement desire dullness hatred attachment clinging not-know cause conditions essence particular arise. Movement hold mind movement past future present follow samsara karma maturation. Mindfulness latent-tendencies cause-conditions action label. Some mind call one enough, division many not-proper, mental-events call one gather enough, fifty-one division not-proper equal. Division-gather parts depend contradiction not.
