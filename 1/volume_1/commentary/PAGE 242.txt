[9766-9784] Four teachers. Connects you to Dharma. Gives samaya. Empowers you. Transmits instruction. Each one opens a different gate. Don't settle for one.

The student who doesn't listen—like a pot turned upside down. No water enters. Don't be that pot.

[9785-9805] Samaya declines and both burn. Teacher in vajra hell. Student in wailing-cry realm. This isn't threat—it's how causality works. Cause and effect never sleep.

Body samaya broken—organ sickness, unbearable pain. Speech broken—darkness, muteness. Mind broken—madness, quarrel without end.

The guru isn't a person. The guru is your recognition appearing in form. Harm that recognition and you've cut your own lifeline.
