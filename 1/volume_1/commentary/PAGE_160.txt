[6296]
When the six hundred thousand eons have passed, when beings are ready to be tamed, a teacher comes. This is Samantabhadra's blessing—teaching's seed-three arising naturally, bringing benefit to sentient beings without flourish or decline.

The beautiful arrangement continues. Fields and realms, appearing and disappearing in ten-year intervals. Each cycle complete, then the supreme teaching moves to another world.

Utpala flower buddha, in the vast protector world, Sukhāvati—the blissful realm. A palace, five thousand retinue, great bodhisattvas who have attained patience for the unborn dharma. Pure beings, single-pointed virtue. The teacher arrives, tames those with wrong desire, establishes the teaching for five thousand years. Then the seven-fold pattern of flourish and decline begins again.

Tuṣita heaven, the contented realm. Amitāyus, infinite life, destroyer of samsara. One hundred eight arhats in the retinue, all outflows exhausted, deeds completed, burdens laid down. The teaching's essence remains for a hundred thousand times seven years. Then the same seven-fold sequence repeats.

Eighty-five eons later, everything dissolves—the dharmas, the buddha bodies, all the worlds. No teaching remains anywhere.

But then: the world below. Six hundred thousand eons. The teaching abides for a long time. No flourish, no decline. Beings ripen naturally.

Here's the teaching's seed-three laid bare:

First seed: The blessing itself—Samantabhadra's arising, bringing benefit without striving.

Second seed: The arrangement—beautiful worlds, vast protector realms, the cycles of teaching and learning.

Third seed: The dissolution—when everything returns to nothing, even teaching ceases.

Notice: all of this is the buddha's teaching. The arising is teaching. The flourishing is teaching. The declining is teaching. The cessation is teaching. There's nothing outside it.

You're not separate from this. Your own mind goes through these same patterns—arisings and cessations, teachings and silences, periods of clarity and periods of confusion. Every moment is part of the cycle.

The question isn't whether you're in a good cycle or a bad cycle. The question is whether you recognize the cycle at all. When you see it—see it completely—that's the teaching. When you don't see it, you're still in the teaching, just dreaming.

Wake up inside the dream.
