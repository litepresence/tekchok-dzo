Now we come to the form realm—beyond the desire gods, beyond the thirty-three, beyond even the asuras who war with them. The text describes houses measureless, relying on sky, like spread planets and stars. Two double sizes, measuring larger and larger.

You read this and think of higher heavens. But listen: these are the jhana states, the absorptions achieved through concentration. Each higher than the last, each more refined, each further from ordinary desire. But still, they are houses. They have dimensions. They rely on sky—they depend on space, on the absence of obstruction. But they are still constructed. They are still fabricated.

The interval sky from Jambu continent to the Thirty-three, eighty thousand leagues—the text says to understand this as before shown, by calculating. But what are you calculating? The progress of your own meditation. The distance from ordinary mind to the first jhana. The distance from the first to the second, the second to the third. Each stage further, each stage higher, but each stage still within the world-system.

"Thus attached, yet in one intermediate eon this vessel world empty nature, free from beings." This is crucial. The text reminds us that all these heavens, all these palaces, all these gods—even the highest form realm—are empty of inherent existence. They appear for an eon, then they empty. They are like a dream palace, magnificent while the dream lasts, gone upon waking.

The mountains and hills with their trees, grass, flowers—each valley with its forest, each continent expanding with jewel trees ripened by nectar rain from the sky. Beautiful. But it is all dependent on conditions. The rain falls, the trees grow. The rain stops, the trees wither. The gods enjoy this, but they do not see its nature. They think it is real. They think it is permanent. They think it is theirs.

The essence attaches manner like above step—the text describes how the world re-forms after being empty. But this is your own mind, practitioner. After a meditation session, after sleep, after distraction, your world re-forms. The essence—the karmic tendencies—attaches again. The vapor releases to ground. The jewel trees of your perceptions ripen again. And you are back in the world, thinking it is real, thinking it is solid, thinking it has always been here.

But you can recognize this process. You can see the world forming. You can see it dissolving. You can see the interval between—empty, free, without beings or essence. That interval is the natural state. That is what the gods do not see. They are so busy enjoying the garden that they do not notice the gardener. They are so busy dwelling in the palace that they do not see the foundation.

Your practice is to see the formation, abide in the emptiness, and not be seduced by the re-formation. When the world dissolves in meditation, do not fear. When it re-forms after meditation, do not grasp. See the whole process as display, as magic, as the play of your own awareness. Then you are higher than the gods. Then you are free of the world-system.
