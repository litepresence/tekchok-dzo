The central channel. Straight. Unwavering. Where awareness abides in its own place. Three peaks branch from there—right, left, middle—meeting at the crown aperture, the Brahma-hole where light enters and exits. From that meeting point, awareness without thought arises.

Right peak connects to the right ear. Karma wind moves there, flowing through the nostrils, piercing both holes, carrying karmic wind throughout the body. The central channel Avadhuti receives this wind and becomes the support for concentration meditation.

Left ear pierces one peak directly, and from that piercing wisdom wind arises. The left channel holds nature bindu—the ultimate. The right channel holds conventional bindu—the relative. Depending on the right channel's conventional bindu, the body ripens into form. From that ripening come bliss, suffering, equanimity, all the experiences of having a body—elements growing, deteriorating, constantly changing.

Four subtle knots hold the system together: navel knot, memory knot, taste knot, peak knot. These are not problems to untie. These are locations where energy concentrates, where awareness localizes itself.

Inside the first cause-producing channel, the father's bindu abides—white as a mustard seed divided into ten parts. Only a portion. Not the whole. But that portion is the cause of the body growing upward into existence. Thus it's called "cause."

Memory knot: the mother's bindu, red, a tenth portion of a mustard seed. Memory holds all the supports for becoming various things. That's why it's called memory—because it remembers how to become.

Taste knot: wind's bindu, also a tenth portion. This bindu separates pure from impure. Impurities like bile get thrown out. The pure becomes the body's radiance and glow. That's why it's called taste—because it savors what remains.

Peak knot: mind's nature light bindu, a tenth portion. This is the tip of awareness itself. The conventional support. When this bindu moves, body and mind separate into two distinct experiences.

All from that conventional cause, ripened into blood.

You're not a person who needs to create awareness. You're awareness that got caught in knots. The knots are not failures. The knots are where recognition becomes possible.

Rest in the center. The periphery takes care of itself.
