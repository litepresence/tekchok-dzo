SA+NGA tagged—short; DA+NA tagged—short. The branches that arise are pronounced accordingly. Thus it is spoken (lines 1-2).

Also CA, JA, ZA, ZHA, and CHA have arisen; one should not doubt that India does not [have them], for although Sanskrit's well-composed letters do not [exist], the ḍākinīs of Uḍḍiyāna have those sounds, so these forms have arisen (lines 3-5).

These tantras are the letters of Uḍḍiyāna, held by the ḍākinīs (lines 5-6).

The second, near-sound expression, is explained in two aspects: the single [letter] and the expression of the sphere's abode (lines 7-9).

The single letter's abode is A, GA, SHA, and so forth—joined to whichever root of saṃsāra or nirvāṇa and explained. Tibetans recite GA, JA, DA, BA, and so forth, joined with aspiration. Other letters are recited separately (lines 10-12).

Also, for KARMA, SARVA, and so forth, the prefix sound is called RA and RBA. When alone, it is called MA and BA (lines 13-15).

The expression of the sphere's abode has three [aspects]: the prefix, the branch, and the stacked [letter] (lines 16-18).

The first is the double-stacked, called "prefix." When life-force is concordant, it is recited as one: like BHA, DHA, JHA, etc. (lines 19-21). These, the letter's consort sound, are expressed with the ZHA-manner of HA sound slightly emanating (lines 22-22).

When life-force is not concordant, it is separated and expressed separately: like AṬA, CAṬA, CA RI, recited as A ṬA, CA ṬA, CA RI (lines 23-23). All stacked types are thus (line 24).

The second also has life-concordant and life-discordant sequences, similar to that (lines 25-25).

Separately, in Tibetan manner, like KAG CHEN: above KA-like, NA RO two, ZHENG BU two, GU GU two, KLAD KOR one, ZHABS KYU two, YA-tagged two, RA-tagged two, RI part one—when these arise, the mother [letter] arises fourteen times (lines 26-26).

"See the classes of these letters aside." Stacked letters, note 2 (line 27).

KO KĀO; KE KĀE; KĪ; KU; KYŪ; KRA KRĀ (lines 28-30).

Listen! The ḍākinīs of Uḍḍiyāna hold these sounds. What does this mean? It means the true tantra is not just Indian Sanskrit. It is the sound of realization itself, which transcends any particular language. The ḍākinīs are the wisdom energy of your own mind. They hold sounds that may not exist in classical Sanskrit because they are the sounds of direct experience.

The distinction between life-force concordant and discordant is crucial. When the elements of a syllable are in harmony, they unite as one sound. When not, they are pronounced separately. This is not arbitrary! It reflects the harmony or disharmony of the energies involved.

And notice—when all the branches are stacked, the mother letter arises fourteen times! This multiplication shows how from one root, many expressions emerge. Yet all are still the mother letter at their core.
