[510-564] The text continues with quotations from the Ati-kota-great tantra, describing the thirty-six activities of body, speech, and mind in exhaustive detail. These lists might seem tedious, but they're describing the complete mandala of enlightened activity. Body's external activities include the major life events—birth, marriage, skill competition, renunciation, alms-round. These are the ways enlightened beings manifest in the world, going through the same experiences as ordinary beings but with recognition.

The internal body activities: abandoning retinue and enjoyment, the great horse, chariot abandoning, essence going to bodhi, emanating light-rays, transforming weapon-rain to flowers. These are symbolic descriptions of how the enlightened body functions. "Transforming weapon-rain to flowers"—this is describing how awareness transforms obstacles into opportunities, how what appears as attack becomes offering when seen clearly.

The secret four body activities relate to samadhi—taming with teaching's final samadhi, making austerity, immediately manifesting twenty-hundred-thousand samadhi-sounds, constantly abiding in precious casket samadhi, bodhi through vajra-like samadhi. These aren't practices to achieve; they're descriptions of the natural stability of awareness when recognized.

[565-576] "Called the activity of the single self-nature of Vajradhara complete in qualities. These are called the succession transmitted by the Victor's intention." All of these elaborate descriptions—twelve emanations, thirty-six activities, countless fields—they're all expressions of one thing: the nature of Vajradhara, which is your own awareness. The "succession transmitted by the Victor's intention" is the lineage of recognition, passed from awakened mind to awakening mind.

The chapter concludes: "From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, The manner of arising established, first chapter. Thus having shown the tamer teacher's history, Now from the definite abode where that teacher tames..." We've completed the first chapter—the history of the teacher. Now we move to the second chapter—the abode where the teaching occurs. This is the structure of the text: first establishing who teaches, then where they teach, then what they teach.
