PAGE 49 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa now enters the profound topic of the two truths [2831-2866], and you must not let this become merely philosophical! The conventional and ultimate are not two different things—they are two ways of seeing the same thing.

When you look at this page, what do you see? Conventionally, you see words, meaning, a teaching. Ultimately, you see emptiness—words that cannot be found when analyzed, meaning that arises dependently, a display that is like a dream. Both are true! The words function. You understand. Yet they have no inherent existence.

The false conventional [2849-2856]—all imputed appearances arranged by intellect—this is your everyday world. You name things, you categorize, you create a reality through conceptual construction. And it works! You navigate, you survive, you communicate. But when you believe this construction is truly real, truly existing out there independent of your mind, you are trapped in the false conventional.

The true conventional [2862-2866]—the white actions of virtue, the collections of merit gathered through wisdom's samadhi—this is the path that leads toward recognition. It is still conventional, still conceptual, but it functions to bring you closer to the ultimate. Like using a thorn to remove a thorn, using a dream to wake from dreaming.

And the ultimate? There are two ultimates too! The nominal ultimate [2873-2879]—what you realize through reasoning, through analysis, through the negation of all extremes. You examine: does something arise from itself, from other, from both, from neither? You find no satisfactory answer. You conclude: empty. This is the nominal ultimate.

But the true ultimate [2881-2887]—phenomena primordially transcend all elaborations. They do not need to be negated; they were never affirmative. They do not need to be emptied; they were never full. This is not something you reach through reasoning. It is what remains when reasoning itself dissolves into its own ground.

So practice with both truths. Engage the conventional path—the virtues, the disciplines, the meditations [2889-2902]. But never forget that even as you practice, the ultimate truth is never separate, never elsewhere. The path itself is empty. The one who walks it cannot be found.
