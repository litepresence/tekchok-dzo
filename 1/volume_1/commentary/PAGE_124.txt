COMMENTARY ON PAGE 124

Now we come to the eight sections, like eight facets of a single jewel. Listen, you who are confused by variety! (lines 1-69)

Two root tantras (lines 1-9)—perfect self-arisen and letterless. These are like the root of a tree. Without root, no branches, no leaves, no fruit. The root tantras empower and ripen through outer elaborations, and show the complete point that ripens and liberates. Do you see? One is for those who need form, the other for those who can go directly. But both are showing the same truth.

The explanatory mother and child tantras (lines 11-19)—rigpa self-arisen and rigpa self-liberated. Like mother and child, they share one nature. The mother tantra shows the special clarity of view, meditation, conduct, result. The child tantra shows the elimination of the mother's ground's object. What does this mean? The ground is delusion. When delusion is eliminated, what remains? Only rigpa, shining clear.

Two limb tantras (lines 21-29)—jewel heap and blazing body-relic. Like limbs of a body, they are essential. One shows qualities complete in themselves, the other shows signs of body, speech, and mind. These are not additions to your nature! They are descriptions of what is already complete within you.

The scripture-logic clear tantras (lines 31-39)—sudden sound and auspicious beauty. Like eyes that see clearly. One shows the root of all scriptural collections, the other identifies delusion's time. When recognition arises suddenly, like sound in silence, that is the root of all scriptures. When you see the nature of delusion, it is auspicious, beautiful—because it shows you what is not deluded.

Four upadesha tantras (lines 41-59)—vajra-sattva heart-mirror, samantabhadra mind-mirror, introduction adorned, pearl garland. These are the direct instructions! Introduction and meeting, empowerment and samaya, distinction and elimination of deviation, examples and meanings with faith, instruction collected causing awakening. These are not information to be memorized, you! They are methods for causing recognition to arise in your direct experience.

Three intention self-position tantras (lines 61-69)—six spaces, blazing lamp, sun-moon-joined. These are about purification and seeing. The six consciousnesses' birth-places purified, the three realms emptied. The four actual lamps seen. The four intermediate states carried on the path. This is the path of direct perception, not gradual accumulation.

Two entering self-liberation tantras (lines 71-73 in next section)—lion-power dzogchen and jewel arrangement. Bringing out the form of view, entering the yogi's path. This is the swift path, the path of courage.

And the expert ritual tantra (lines 77-79)—glorious black wrathful, protecting the supreme teachings. Like a guardian at the gate.

All these from the Pearl Garland (line 21). Ah! Supreme wonder, great! (line 25) Indeed! The wonder is that all of this is already accomplished in your own mind.
