COMMENTARY ON PAGE 83 - Patrul Rinpoche

Hear this, you who seek liberation! From the Ratnakuta Sutra, lines 3087-3091: The Tathagatas are permanent dharmas without birth. All dharmas are like the Sugatas. Childish intellect grasps at signs—you engage in dharma that does not exist within the world.

You grasp at signs! You see a form and think "this is real." You hear a sound and think "this exists." But where is the birth of these phenomena? Can you find the moment when a sound is born? When a thought arises, where does it come from? When it ceases, where does it go? You cannot find these things because they have no true arising, no true cessation!

From the Root Wisdom, lines 3093-3100: Whatever depends and connects, through non-cessation, there is no birth. Through non-annihilation, there is no permanence. Through non-coming, there is no going. This is the profound teaching of dependent origination and emptiness.

You think things come and go? Look at your own mind. A thought arises—is it coming from somewhere? It ceases—is it going somewhere? No! Like a wave on the ocean—does the water come from somewhere when the wave rises? Does it go somewhere when the wave falls? The water is simply water, moving in the ocean. Your mind is simply awareness, displaying its natural play.

Nagarjuna says, lines 3104-3112: If I were to assert something exists, then I would have this fault. Since I assert nothing, I am only without faults. This is the fearless proclamation of the Middle Way. You are afraid to let go of all positions, all views. You want something to hold onto—some philosophy, some system, some certainty. But the ultimate truth offers no handhold!

From the Refutation of Refutations: Since there is nothing to refute, I refute nothing. Therefore, it is said that one refutes. You have imposed that imputation. Your opponent says "you have a view, a position." But the one who realizes emptiness has no position to defend. Like space—does space argue with form? Space simply allows all forms to appear within it.

This great treatise—six collections of Middle Way reasoning—points to what cannot be pointed to. The three turnings of the wheel, lines 3127-3144, all teach the same truth: from the four truths to the characteristic-less dharmas to the ultimate distinguished dharmas. Do not think these are different teachings. They are medicine for different ailments, but the cure is the same: recognition of your own nature.

Stop philosophizing and look at your mind!
