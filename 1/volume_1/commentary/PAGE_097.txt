You who would know the vast expanse—attend! Lines 3797-3807: The essence of the Infinite Space expanse, when appearing to the mind, is known. When not appearing, it is known by the mode of abiding. When divided, there are three: The Outer Infinite Space free from action; The Inner Infinite Space of the view's own position; The Secret Infinite Space of radiance and obstacle-removal; The Infinite Space of that-which-is itself.

The first, lines 3805-3808: Through causelessness, no reversal—this is the key point. Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed—this is the key point. Through the absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nowhere established—this is the key point. Also, through uncontrivance toward the mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcending non-samsāra.

Causelessness! No reversal! Whatever appears is unharmed—nothing can damage it, nothing can stain it. Samsara and nirvana are nowhere established because there is no cause and no condition for them. This is not mere philosophy—it is your direct experience when you look without concepts.

The space free from action, lines 3838-3840: Through non-doing, is liberated into the dharmatā of self-liberation. Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation. Thus it is said.

Non-doing! Liberation through not doing anything. Not that you must stop acting in the world—you can act, speak, think—but the liberation itself is not something you do. It is the nature of things. Like space—does space do anything to accommodate forms? It simply is.

The space of ornament, lines 3842-3843: Appearance is the continuity of mind. The ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty, so it is called. Appearance is the continuity of mind—all these forms, sounds, thoughts, they are like ornaments decorating the expanse of mind. But they are free from grasping—they do not stick, they do not bind.

Furthermore, lines 3845-3846: Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived. Thus it is said. Non-arising, non-ceasing—where can you conceive of this? Not in thought, not in concept. Only in direct recognition.

The space of play, lines 3848-3849: The play without direction, unceasing, arises. The transformation of appearance and mind does not occur, so it is called. The play without direction—manifestation appearing everywhere, without a center, without a goal. Unceasing. And here is the crucial point: transformation of appearance and mind does not occur. You do not need to transform impure appearance into pure appearance. You recognize that transformation is not necessary—that very recognition is the pure appearance!

The space of dharmatā, lines 3854-3855: Abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not. The basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing and knowing are non-dual. Abiding uncontrived—not made, not fabricated. Self-arisen—not created by anyone. Whatever arises is not—it has no true existence. The basis is uncontrived emptiness. And seeing and knowing are non-dual—the subject and object are one.

Furthermore, lines 3857-3858: The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond all. Thus it is said. The peak of emptiness—this is not mere empty nothingness. It is the emptiness that is also clarity, also knowing, also compassionate display. Completely good, beyond all.
