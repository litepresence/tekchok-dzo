Student's six families seed empty, afflictions six purifying, wisdom six meaning arising, that power possessing (lines 1-4). Also guru divide root and, branch two from (lines 5-6):

First root guru: characteristics four complete empowerment basis placed, tantra explained, oral instruction shown, now also self guru that shown oral instruction practice (lines 7-11). Oral instruction guru empowerment basis placed, tantra explained two possessing, oral instruction struck branch guru three possessing (lines 12-14).

Incidentally training master (line 15): from Rangshar (line 16): ignorance pride great and, stupid words attached and, secret mantra meaning not mind and, other's criticism proud words and, wrong path entered and, empowerment maṇḍala face not seen, samaya spread and, questions answer not able, little learning pride great, master not examined student's demon, secret mantra teacher not, great perfection Ati cannot teach, that associate not (lines 17-29). Thus it is spoken (line 30).

Second student's nature (line 31): saṃsāra's dharmas mind reversed, guru dharma companion faithful devotion great, faith firm dharma other mind not enter, definite meaning faith renunciation diligence great, attachment few nature good, wisdom great samaya vows abide, other's mind suitable dharma transform, guru's words listen secret gate not miss, study contemplation great self-nature tamed, especially guru Buddha or more devotion possessing, ten dharmas possessing, liberation supreme good student, quickly saṃsāra liberation supreme obtain definite (lines 32-44). Thus also (line 45):

Listen! The student must also be qualified! Six families seed empty—purifying the afflictions, arising wisdom. Without this power, empowerment cannot take root.

Two types of guru—root and branch. The root guru explains tantra, shows oral instruction, practices what he teaches. The branch guru may only give oral instruction, may lack the complete basis. Know the difference!

And avoid the false masters! Those with ignorance and pride, attached to stupid words, not understanding secret mantra meaning, proud of criticizing others, entered wrong paths, never seen empowerment mandala, spread samaya without basis, cannot answer questions, proud with little learning. These are not teachers—they are demons!

But you, the student—have you reversed your mind from samsara's dharmas? Do you have great devotion to guru and dharma companion? Firm faith that does not enter other dharmas? Renunciation, diligence, few attachments, good nature, great wisdom, samaya vows?

Can you transform others' minds with suitable dharma? Do you listen to guru's words without missing the secret gate? Do you study and contemplate, taming your self-nature? Do you see guru as Buddha—or even greater?

These ten dharmas make you a supreme vessel. With these, you quickly obtain liberation. Without them, even the best teaching cannot enter. Examine yourself honestly!
