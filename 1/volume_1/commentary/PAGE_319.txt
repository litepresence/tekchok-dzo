[13193]
The work of production. How your body and mind arise from letters, from elements, from sounds you cannot hear but that nonetheless create everything you experience.

Within that, the syllable SAṀ—yellow, clear, radiant. Attachment. From this syllable, bound to beings' voices, all experience arises.

The four directions: earth, water, fire, wind. Channels of each, gathering and spreading. Within them: SUṀ white, red, green—each color, each channel, each abiding in its place. From this, the four activities of beings—going, sleeping, sitting, acting—all arise.

Then the sixth day: fire and wind combining, the body's form taking shape. Within the blazing, expanding fire channel, the syllable RĀṀ—greatly scraping, pulsing. This syllable distinguishes all beings' cognition: sharp and dull, clear and unclear.

The four directions again, the inner elements, the channels expanding. Within burning, the syllables RĀṀ producing, RUṀ empty. These become the signs of sleep, the markers of dreams. From these, beings' memory and thought arise, spinning the wheel of mental activity.

Six days complete, and the elements become the body's support, the form's foundation.

Without this, the four elements cannot control food and clothing. The inner dharmas cannot manifest as groups. The four secret empowerments' fruits remain immature. The four forms become the certain support.

Then: the work of elements over days and nights, male and female combining, seed growing. The elements and the genders together create the body's aggregation.

On the seventh day, the four elements become one taste. Four causes: wind, mind. Four supports: flesh, blood, warmth, breath. Four channels. Four syllables—becoming one form, the aggregate of everything gathered.

Here's what's being described: your body is a construction. Letters, syllables, elements, channels—all coming together to create this apparatus you call "me." The sounds you cannot hear are building everything you experience.

Don't mistake the construction for the builder. Don't identify with the built. The elements will disperse. The syllables will return to their sources. The channels will dissolve.

What's left? The awareness that was never built, never constructed, never formed from elements and syllables. That's who you really are. Not the body. Not the mind. The presence that watches it all arise and dissolve.

Watch it. Don't identify with it. You're the awareness, not the construction.
