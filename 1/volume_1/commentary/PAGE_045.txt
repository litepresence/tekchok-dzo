PAGE 45 COMMENTARY

Now we come to the heart of delusion—actions and afflictions [1775-1831]. You read that aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleshas [1802-1809], and you must take this personally! Every moment of your life, you are creating the world you inhabit through the three poisons.

When you feel desire, you are not merely having a feeling—you are casting a vote for the desire realm, reinforcing the structures of attachment that bind beings. When anger arises, you are building hell realms, not in some future life but immediately, in the texture of your present experience. The hells are not locations; they are states of mind so contracted, so burning, so without relief, that we call them hell.

Longchenpa lists the six afflictions: ignorance, delusion, hatred, pride, attachment, jealousy [1824-1831]. Look at yourself! Which one rules you today? Is it the confusion that doesn't know what is truly happening? The anger that burns everything it touches? The pride that makes you separate and superior? The attachment that grasps and never lets go? The jealousy that poisons every relationship?

You think these are just emotions, just natural responses? No! They are the architects of samsara. Through these, you have built the world you suffer in. And the kicker is—you are doing it right now, even as you read these words. Is your mind grasping at understanding? Is there pride in knowing? Is there aversion to what challenges you?

The eighty-four thousand conceptual masses [1837] are not abstract categories. They are the individual thoughts you have every day, multiplied across all beings, creating a storm of confusion so vast it seems like the world itself. But the world IS that confusion, solidified, repeated, believed.

Yet Longchenpa gives the antidote: "All of these, although non-existent, are grasped as self—like a mirage, like water, like confusion, arising and grasping a snake where there is only a rope" [1842]. You who suffer so intensely from these afflictions—where are they now? In the past moment, they seemed so real, so solid. In this moment, can you find them? They are like dreams that terrify until you wake.

The rope has never been a snake. Your mind has never truly been afflicted. This is not optimism—it is the nature of things, waiting for you to recognize.
