PAGE 44 COMMENTARY

Here Longchenpa lays out the aggregates, sense sources, and faculties [1623-1756], and you must not let this become mere academic study! These are not categories in a book—they are the very structure of your suffering right now.

The eighteen elements—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind consciousness, their objects, and the contact between them [1623-1666]—this is how you construct your prison moment by moment. You see a form, consciousness arises, contact happens, feeling follows, and immediately you are caught: "I like this, I don't like that." 

Look at how it happens: The eye element arises from clear knowing [1646], the ear from single-pointed knowing [1647], and so forth. But what is this knowing? Is it inside you? Outside? Neither? When you truly look for where seeing happens, where hearing occurs, you cannot find a boundary. The sound and the hearing are one event, not two!

You think your senses connect you to the world? No! They create the illusion of separation. The sense sources expand as grasper and grasped [1706-1718]—subject and object—but this division is the original error. Like a mirror that seems to hold images but is never touched by them, your awareness appears to perceive objects while remaining forever pure and unaffected.

The faculties—eye faculty holding earth portion, ear holding wind, nose holding water [1744-1749]—again, these are not physical organs you can dissect. They are functions of knowing, ways that awareness modulates itself. Your physical eyes may fail, but the knowing that sees has never been damaged. Deafness does not touch the knowing that hears.

When Longchenpa speaks of the aggregates with thought and without thought [1667-1705], he is showing you that even liberation has been conceptually divided! But liberation is not an aggregate to be gathered or abandoned. It is the recognition that the one who gathers and abandons was never anything more than a fleeting thought.

So examine: Who possesses these faculties? Who owns these aggregates? Search thoroughly. When you cannot find an owner, rest in that not-finding. That openness is the faculty of wisdom itself [1755], beyond all division into six or sixty or eighty-four thousand.
