Life like thirty-three. Then demon class included in god class, titan class four only. The asuras, though demonic in nature, are classified within the god realm because they share the same lifespan, body, and enjoyment. But their inclusion is a reminder that even the highest pleasures can be poisoned by wrong mind.

Then expanded to humans—first, two god sons from clear light expanded to lotus miraculous birth on this excellent merit ground Jambu continent explained. We have descended through all the god realms, through all the asura realms, and now we arrive at the human realm. But what a birth! Not from womb, not from egg, not from moisture, but from clear light, from lotus, miraculous.

That after formed beings up to four great kings, two god sons from clear light fallen to this Jambu continent: Sun Greatly-Illuminating, Moon Stainless. These are the first humans, descending from the clear light gods, falling from the sky like sunlight and moonlight. Their names describe their nature—illuminating, stainless. The original human condition was luminous, pure.

Then to immeasurable lotus of light where all appearance greatly beautiful, from those two's minds greatly moved, by condition of manifest space seed part arisen, some miraculous birth god sons expanded. From the minds of the first two humans, moved by the beauty of the lotus light, other beings arose. The power of mind to create, to manifest, to expand. This is the origin of the human race—not from evolution, not from chance, but from mind. From the clear light.

Those joy when seeing each other, greatly clear light appearance, activity by miracle: Those beings go, also go to sky. Sit, also sit in sky. Food as meditation, dwell in joy bliss. The first humans had miraculous powers. They could fly. They could dwell in bliss. They took meditation as food—they were nourished by absorption, by the clear light. They had no need for coarse food.

Body extends immeasurable light ray groups, where wish to go, by mere thought arrive, life years immeasurable last, no afflictions manifestly move. No suffering. No limitation. No affliction. This is the human condition in the first eon, before the fall. Before grasping. Before duality fully emerged.

Some tantras explain expanded from Joy Possess, some explain expanded from Four Great Kings. Intention: those two first chiefs fallen from clear light, below that Joy Possess, Four Great Kings, fallen from above others, miraculously born here, know no contradiction in all views. Different teachings give different accounts of the origin. But the intention is the same: humans came from light, from higher realms, from purity. The fall is the descent into denser states, into embodiment, into limitation.

That time first eon that place name called Joy Possess Pile. What cause? Inconceivable light appearance enjoyment, immeasurable awareness concentration joy bliss. The first eon was called "Joy Possess Pile" because it was characterized by inconceivable enjoyment, by immeasurable bliss. The humans of that time possessed joy naturally, without effort, without seeking.

That time sixth teacher Vajra Holder tames those beings. Even in this state of natural bliss, there is need for teaching. The Vajra Holder, Vajradhara, the sixth Buddha of this eon, came to guide these beings. Not because they were suffering—they were not. But because even bliss, when not recognized as the nature of mind, is still samsara. Even enjoyment, when clung to, becomes bondage.
