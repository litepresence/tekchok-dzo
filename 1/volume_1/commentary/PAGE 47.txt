PAGE 47 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa continues his relentless exposure of wrong views [2100-2164], and you must feel the urgency here! Every one of these three hundred sixty views is a trap you could fall into, a way of thinking that promises liberation but delivers only more bondage.

Look at how he describes the cutting of flesh, the jumping from cliffs, the burning of bodies with fire [2273-2283]—these extreme ascetic practices performed in the name of spirituality. You may not be wrapping yourself in cloth soaked with sesame oil and setting yourself ablaze, but what are you doing to yourself in the name of practice? Are you pushing until you break? Are you making your spiritual life another form of self-punishment?

The tirthikas who declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed [2350-2364]—these are not just ancient heretics. They are your own mind when it gives up, when it says "nothing matters," when it falls into nihilism disguised as wisdom. Beware! The true Dharma never severs anything. It reveals that there was never anything to sever.

When Longchenpa speaks of those who "wield evil mantras as chief, performing fierce destructive rites" [2324], or those who "take divination and prophecy as chief, caring only for this world's happiness" [2324], he is warning you about spiritual materialism. Are you using practice to get what you want? To harm your enemies? To predict the future? Then you have become what he describes.

The four types he identifies—extreme view, extreme end, distant benefit, indifference [2401-2411]—cover all the mistakes. Eternal permanence at one pole, complete annihilation at the other, with various compromises in between. Where do you stand? Probably you oscillate between them, sometimes believing in something permanent, sometimes believing in nothing at all.

The purpose of teaching all this [2425] is so you do not enter wrong paths. But how do you know what is wrong? Wrong is anything that requires you to grasp at a view, to establish a position, to become something. The right path is the path that dissolves the path-walker, that reveals no one ever needed to go anywhere.

So read these lists not as history but as diagnosis. Find your own tendencies here. Then let them go. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. Rest there.
