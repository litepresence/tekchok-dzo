PAGE 267 COMMENTARY

Look here, earnest seeker! Lines [10945-10964] point directly to what cannot be pointed to—the primordial purity beyond all extremes!

The entity empty-portion reversed! Look at what is not: Not awareness! Not non-awareness! Not buddha! Not sentient being! Not samsara! Not transcended! Not light! Not color! Not body! Not primordial wisdom! Not ground! Not path! Not result!

This is not nihilism—this is the great freedom from all conceptual constructs! Like the sky cannot be stained by clouds, your nature cannot be limited by any quality!

No confusion! No liberation! No bondage! These are mere labels applied to what has always been free!

The nature appearance-portion reversed! Whatever appears, its essence is emptiness. Whatever is empty, its nature is appearance. Not two, not one—beyond the mind that divides!

You seek to establish what cannot be established! You seek to characterize what has no characteristics! Stop looking with the mind that creates distinctions! The primordially pure has no direction, no limit, no center!

This is the view that destroys all views! The meditation that transcends all meditation! The conduct that is beyond conduct! The result that was never apart from the ground!

Like searching for the edge of space—you will search forever and find nothing to find!

Rest in what cannot be described, what cannot be thought, what cannot be meditated!

Emaho! The great reversal of all concepts!
