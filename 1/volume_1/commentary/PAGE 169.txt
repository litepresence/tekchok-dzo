Arhat result guide, then dark eon six, that passed arhat hundred-thousand two, self's retinue gathered, sūtra teaching eon eight, provisional definite karma guide, miracle power conquered, definitely propelled teaching complete, again nirvāṇa manner shown (lines 1-9). Then dark eon two, then teacher's kāya born, bodhisattva great's retinue, thousand eight gathered, supreme aspiring Rab-'jigs-dpal, greatly shown teaching gathered, abhidharma teaching eon hundred, all life one result obtain, this time Saṃsāra-emptied, beings Buddha obtain, six migrations appearance not possible, eon thousand twenty, beings saṃsāra continuum cut, beings not-appear (lines 10-23).

Then karma distinction, beings afflictions former not, habitual tendencies arose power, very subtle taken form, number many very subtle from, form beings body increase (lines 24-29). Thus express immeasurable, teaching's end inconceivable, temporarily word shown (lines 30-32). Thus it is spoken (line 33).

Here some masters, Samantabhadra's abode all beings all emptied, some Vajradhara arranged Brahma-great beings all liberated, teaching's end inconceivable, thus Samantabhadra's abode still measureless, however not contradictory, Samantabhadra's compassion all liberated, sphere arising still habitual tendencies measureless two not contradictory, liberation great measure best very good (lines 34-42).

From Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle (line 43):

Listen! The complete cycle—dark eons, arhats gathering, sutra teachings, then abhidharma teachings. Each vehicle serving its purpose, each liberation cutting the continuum of samsara. Finally, Samsara-emptied! All beings become Buddha. Six migrations no longer possible. For a thousand twenty eons, beings do not appear.

Then—habitual tendencies arise again. Very subtle forms appear. Form beings increase. This is the nature of samsara. Even when emptied, it arises again from the power of latent tendencies.

The teaching's end is inconceivable! Some masters say Samantabhadra's abode is emptied of all beings. Some say Vajradhara's Brahma-great eon liberates all. Both are true! Not contradictory. Samantabhadra's compassion liberates all, yet the sphere's arising from habitual tendencies is measureless. These two—liberation and appearance—are not in conflict.

This is the great measure of liberation. The best of the very good. Do not be discouraged by the vastness! Even one moment of recognition is enough. Even one being liberated is enough. The teaching continues, endless, until all are freed.
