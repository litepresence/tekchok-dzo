[15724-15732] Three hundred sixty days, seven hundred twenty meals calculated! One day twelve times calculated: thousand nine hundred thirty-two and a half conception adventitious change; thousand nine hundred twenty-eight wisdom pure measure moving wind held! Thus five day, five night, two midnight—twelve parts calculated! This day-night equal time calculated! Autumn-spring two equal times certainly hold!

[15733-15748] Moon itself increase-decrease calculation: moon female and male difference! Moon female six, twenty-nine days not more; male six, thirty complete! One year six days lacking! Thus moon controlled! Autumn-spring two middle day-night equal—remainder half and three extra fraction known! Vinaya also: sojong able-unable calculated! Thus wind calculation certainly obtained—outer year and month connected, day time divided, known! Its object summer-winter-autumn-spring four, moon twelve dawns, that confusion-wheel not reversed, all appearances certainly obtained! Also *Thal-'gyur*: "Day thirteen also, months are one! Thus twelve complete, year is one!"

Do you see? Time itself is wind-play, practitioner! Emaho!
