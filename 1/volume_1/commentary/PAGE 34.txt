Cause no sorrow to those arisen joy bliss appearance—body two thousand leagues, life lasts two interval eons. We continue through the form realms, each with its specific characteristics, each lower than the one before.

Jewel crystal house pile—arise beings called not great, cause desire attachment to appearance not great. The name itself tells the story. Not great. The beings here are less magnificent than those above. Their houses are made of crystal, beautiful but cold. Their attachment to appearance is not great, but it is still attachment.

Life lasts one interval eon, body size thousand leagues exist. Still vast by human standards, but the decline is clear. From six thousand leagues at the peak of form to one thousand here. From six thousand interval eons to one. The trajectory is downward, even through the heavens.

Then we reach the ordinary form realm heavens—virtue increase, measure without virtue, virtue small, light clear, jewel glory pile, jewel brave light. Each name describes both the quality of the realm and the limitation of its inhabitants. Virtue increase—they are increasing in virtue, but from a low base. Measure without virtue—their virtue is immeasurable, which means they have not measured it, do not understand it. Virtue small—self-explanatory. Light clear—their bodies are clear light, but this clarity is still a form of obscuration.

Body sizes continue to decrease—sixty-four leagues, thirty-two, sixteen, eight, four, two. Life spans decrease correspondingly. What was vast becomes intimate. What was cosmic becomes personal. But it is still form. It is still realm. It is still not liberation.

Some also say measure without virtue above virtue increase—there is some disagreement about the ordering of these realms. This is because the distinctions are subtle. The differences between one level of virtue and another are not always clear-cut. The important point is not the exact ordering but the principle: there are gradations of form realm existence, each with its characteristics, each with its limitations.

Jewel keruja, jewel kekeru, jewel samika, jewel sikata—the names become more obscure, more difficult to translate. But they all share the jewel prefix. These realms are precious, valuable, attained through virtue and concentration. But they are still constructed. They still depend on causes and conditions.

Light clear expanded from above, cause clear light body. The beings here have clear light bodies, achieved through the concentration on light. But clear light achieved through concentration is not the same as the natural clear light of the nature of mind. One is fabricated, the other is innate. One depends on practice, the other is always present.

Then to desire realm from two—first of six god races: below that to sky called greatly expanded wish fulfilling tree jewel. We have descended through the entire form realm, from the peak of "below not" down through the five pure abodes, through the ordinary form heavens, down to the lowest form realm. And now, below that, we enter the desire realm.

The wish-fulfilling tree jewel—this marks the transition to the desire realm. The beings here have desires, but they are refined desires. They wish for things, and the wish-fulfilling tree provides. They have power over emanation—the ability to manifest forms. Their bodies are leagues in size, their lives thousands of years by their reckoning.
