Now we're getting into the architecture of the teaching itself. The tantra-body and its introduction—how these connect, how meaning unfolds.

Longchenpa lays out four approaches:

**First approach**: Summarizing the meaning through eleven words of instruction, establishing eleven categories of verbal meaning. Cutting through confusion and crossing over to liberation—binding the two stages of practice together.

**Second approach**: For those whose awareness is already direct—all of it gathers into the single meaning of rigpa itself. No need for elaborate structures when recognition is present.

**Third approach**: The four bonds of the root vajra. Vimalamitra's supreme view, passed down unbroken. Great Paṇḍita, pure knowing.

**Fourth approach**: The great secret, fourfold, established in meaning.

Now, how tantras are structured. The teaching always has:

**Title**: What it's called, the name that points.

**Text**: The words themselves, the clear sequence of what's spoken.

**Body**: The main teaching, arranged systematically.

**Limbs**: The branches, the extensions, explained extensively.

All tantras arise from the introduction-base—the point where teaching meets student. That's why tantras don't read like ordinary books. They're not composed by someone trying to make points. They're arising from the meeting of wisdom and capacity.

Each tantra has:

**The teacher**: Perfected, complete—not just a person but the embodiment of the teaching.

**The place**: Perfected—where the teaching happens isn't ordinary space.

**The retinue**: Perfected—those receiving aren't ordinary beings.

**The dharma**: Perfected—the teaching itself is complete.

**The time**: Perfected—not sequential time but the timeless moment of transmission.

Five perfections, five ways the teaching is complete. These are called the great secret tantras—common and uncommon, ordinary appearance and extraordinary meaning.

The seed of all this is the introduction-base. Without that, without the meeting point, there's just words on a page. With it, the whole tantra arises, alive.

Here's what this means for you: you're not just reading information. You're entering a transmission. The teacher, place, retinue, dharma, time—all must be present for it to work. Maybe not in outer form—maybe you're alone with a book in a monastery or a city apartment. But inwardly, something must be perfected too.

Don't read tantras like novels. Read them as transmissions. Feel for the presence. If it's not there, put the book down and look for what will make it arise.
