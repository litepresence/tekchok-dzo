Here Longchenpa begins the great teaching on vehicles [1865-1901], and you must understand: these vehicles are not paths you travel from here to there. They are ways of seeing, levels of recognition, and you may shift between them many times in a single day!

The worldly vehicle—the vehicle of gods and humans—is where most of you dwell. You accumulate merit, maintain virtue, and hope for better circumstances [1895-1896]. Nothing wrong with this! But do not mistake it for liberation. It is like cleaning your prison cell until it becomes comfortable—you are still in prison.

Then comes the mistaken vehicle [1900-1943], and Longchenpa is fierce here. Eternalists and nihilists, Samkhyas and Lokāyatas—you think these are ancient philosophies you can dismiss? No! You hold these views yourself! When you believe in a permanent soul, an unchanging self that persists through time, you are eternalist. When you think death is the end, that nothing continues, you are nihilist.

The Samkhyas speak of a self-nature hidden in the heart, white and oily, coiled like a serpent [1913-1935]. You search for this same self! You look for the "real you" somewhere inside, some essence that is truly yours. It is not there. It has never been there. The search itself is the delusion.

The Lokāyatas deny past and future lives, action and result [1944-2004]. You also deny karma when you think your actions have no consequences, when you believe you can harm others without consequence to yourself. The materialists say mind arises from elements meeting—heat and moisture producing consciousness like maggots from rotting flesh. Do you not sometimes feel this way? That you are just chemistry, just biology, just random processes with no deeper meaning?

Longchenpa lists hundreds of wrong views [2023-2092], but do not get lost in the catalog. The point is simple: any view that grasps at permanence or interruption, that establishes something as truly existent or truly non-existent, is a deviation. The only correct view is the view that transcends all views—not by negating them, but by seeing through the one who holds them.

You are not a Samkhya, not a Lokāyata, not a Buddhist or non-Buddhist. These are clothes you try on. What remains when all costumes are removed? That is what you must discover.
