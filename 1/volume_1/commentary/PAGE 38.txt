Came in manner of miraculous birth to wide large cavity of thousand-petaled greatly beautiful light lotus. The Buddha Vajradhara, the primordial Buddha, appears spontaneously, born from the lotus of reality itself. Not from parents, not from conditions, but from the natural expression of the dharmakaya.

That also, by gazing at beings with three forms of gaze, expanded from above: god sons Sun Greatly-Illuminating, Moon Without-Stain arose. Sign of arising as teacher taming beings by relying on means and wisdom. The Buddha's gaze—compassionate, wise, all-seeing—calls forth the first students. The sun and moon, the first humans, arise from that gaze. The teacher and the taught are not separate. They arise together.

That time, upon each lotus petal top, each similar to Buddha and cause came: Sign of thousand Buddhas arising in this eon. Each petal of the thousand-petaled lotus represents a Buddha who will appear in this fortunate eon. The first humans, sun and moon, are the precursors, the signs, the causes for the thousand Buddhas to come.

Then, taming appearance eye gazing at lotus, proclaimed self sound of hot cold arisen from sky: From thrice arisen sound called "not appear dark," those beings also seized being called human. The Buddha's teaching manifests as sound—three times arising, dispelling the darkness of not-knowing. And the beings who hear it are "seized"—captured, transformed, claimed by the dharma. They become human—not just in body, but in nature. To be human is to have the capacity to hear the dharma, to understand, to practice.

That time, no body flesh etcetera flesh blood—occasionally rely on above light, clearly appear, greatly beautiful sense five, limb, color, ayatana etcetera exist and-yet, male and female different not. The first humans had no coarse bodies. They were made of light, sustained by light. Occasionally they relied on the light from above—the light of the clear light gods, the light of the natural state. Their senses were beautiful, their limbs perfect, but there was no male and female. No duality. No separation.

That time, sixty-four light stars appearing in sky: before sign of sixty-four Great Perfection dharma enumerations arising. The sixty-four stars that appeared were omens of the sixty-four tantras of the Great Perfection that would be taught. From within that, seventeen beautiful bright: Sign of seventeen extremely secret supreme tantras arising. Seventeen of the sixty-four are especially secret, especially profound. They are the heart of the teaching.

Then, awareness form all-knowing eye showing emptiness that, gazing at taming object, say early to all teachings sound thalgyur great root tantra. The Buddha's all-knowing eye, the wisdom that sees emptiness, gazes at the beings to be tamed. And from that gaze, the sound of the Thalgyur tantra arises—the great root tantra that contains all teachings.

This time, beings' life years immeasurable, body thirty-two cubits. Then gradually decline. The golden age does not last. Even with miraculous birth, even with light bodies, even with immeasurable lifespan, decline sets in. This is the nature of conditioned existence. Where there is birth, there is death. Where there is formation, there is dissolution.

Then beings also many expand, life also gradually decline, body light etcetera also fade, merit also small went. The multiplication of beings, the decline of lifespan, the fading of light, the exhaustion of merit—all happening together, all signs of the world's degeneration. But this degeneration is not a fall from grace in the biblical sense. It is the natural play of conditions. It is the way the world-system operates. And within it, there is always the opportunity for awakening.
