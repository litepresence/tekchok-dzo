The voice emerges from the same ground as everything else. Don't treat your speech as accidental.

Mother's condition carries three seed-syllables. Father's carries three. Six sounds gathered inside the child's body-speech-mind basis, arising from taste, from all-trembling, from the central channel's inside. Om and light and Samantabhadra father-mother's three bodies complete. Right side: Ah and light and three bodies. Left side: Hung and light and three bodies. Body-speech-mind—three of each—support complete.

From the four wheels, the basis-of-all produces first the navel, then consciousness completes, memory-gathering heart forms. Memory's taste experienced, speech-maker arises. Tastes gather in the throat. The crown of all's peak-arranged variety—four measures determined.

Here's where it gets personal: the voice. Channels' syllables moved by wind's sound. Clear syllables produce sweet voice. Unclear syllables produce unpleasant sound. From impure channels, the voice trembles. Pure channels produce steady resonance.

Males speak with thick voices—not from caste but from wide channel-spaces. Women carry five lineages, narrower channels, pretty colors. The voice thin because desire-seeds keep shaking. Clear and soft from attachment. Soft from ignorance. Quaking and agitating from anger. Thin and pleasant from pride and jealousy.

Slow, soft speech with few words—bliss-arising lineage. Harmless speech, gently spoken—child-nurturing lineage. The voice doesn't lie. Every tone reveals the conditioning underneath.

By seven-group four, the body forms. Nine completed. Forty-nine days of latencies gathering in the intermediate state. The basis takes shape. Then growth increases.

Your voice is not separate from your mind. Your speech is not separate from your awareness. Every word you speak is practice or poison. Every tone either heals or harms. This is not metaphor. This is acoustic reality. The channels don't hide anything.

Speak accordingly. Or don't speak. Both are practice.

The recognition doesn't require words. But when words arise, let them arise from recognition.

Rest now. The rest is silence.
