PAGE 55 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa continues his exposition of the self-enlightened vehicle [2710-2781], and I want you to appreciate their unique path! These pratyekabuddhas do not depend on teachers in their final life—they realize through their own power, at the end of existence [2710].

There are two types: like rhinoceroses dwelling alone, and like crows gathering in flocks [2710]. The rhinoceros is the superior type, meditating deeply on dependent arising, realizing both the person-selflessness and the outer dharma-selflessness—seeing that atoms and particles have no inherent existence [2731]. Yet even they do not fully realize the inner dharma-selflessness—they still grasp at the consciousness that knows.

Their meditation on dependent arising is profound [2760]. They go to charnel grounds and contemplate: "From what did this corpse arise?" From death. From what death? From birth. From what birth? From existence. From what existence? From grasping. From grasping? From craving. From craving? From feeling. From feeling? From contact. From contact? From the six sense bases. From the six sense bases? From name and form. From name and form? From consciousness. From consciousness? From formative forces. From formative forces? From ignorance.

This is the twelve links, traced backward from effect to cause. And when they see it clearly, they reverse it: destroy ignorance, and formative forces cease. Destroy formative forces, consciousness ceases. All the way to the cessation of aging and death. This is liberation!

They also meditate on the eight unpleasant objects [2781]: the bloated corpse, the blue-black corpse, the rotting corpse, the split corpse, the devoured corpse, the scattered corpse, the burned corpse, the white skeleton. Why? To break attachment to the body! You cling to this flesh as "mine," as beautiful, as desirable. But look at it in a charnel ground! This is what awaits your precious body.

Yet their limitation remains: they teach by signs, not words [2742], and their compassion does not extend to teaching others extensively. They attain liberation for themselves, like a rhinoceros wandering alone. Noble, yes! Complete, no. The full awakening of a bodhisattva or buddha goes beyond, liberating all.
