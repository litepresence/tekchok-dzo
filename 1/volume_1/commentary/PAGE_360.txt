[14862-14868] Space-of essence mind first that from change only. You read this and think of bindus moving? The bindu that moves is not the bindu that matters. The bindu that matters never entered any channel.

[14869-14876] Four phlegm channels, four bile, four wind, two earth. Fourteen affliction paths—who walks them? The walker is the path. The path is empty.

[14877-14882] Throat enjoyment wheel, four above going, empty potency purifying. All true. But do not seek these wheels in the throat. The throat is a label. The enjoyment is recognition.

[14883-14891] Two all-pervading, two below, four right, four left. Wisdom potency, action power. These winds—have you found the windless? The one who knows wind has no breath.

[14892-14908] Direction portion, moving wind, dissolve reverse, grasping essence, form pair unite. Technical terms for children. The adult knows: all of this is spontaneous presence. Presence does not study.
