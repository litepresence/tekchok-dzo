PAGE 64 COMMENTARY

Here Longchenpa describes the extreme ascetic practices [2284-2315]—flesh removed, body placed in holes, feeding worms, dog conduct, and all the rest. You read this and think "How primitive! How misguided!" But look at yourself—what are you doing to your body in the name of spirituality?

Are you pushing through pain until you damage yourself? Are you denying sleep, food, comfort, believing this will purify you? Are you making your body an enemy to be conquered? This is the same error! The body is not the obstacle. The obstacle is the grasping at the body as "mine," as self, as something to punish or reward.

Those who "enter dog conduct" [2288]—literally imitating dogs, eating like dogs, behaving like dogs—believing this will lead to liberation. This is mistaken conduct, yes! But why? Not because dogs are low, but because imitation is not transformation. You cannot become liberated by acting like something else, whether that something is a dog or a Buddha.

The agent cause theory [2289-2295]—like a carpenter making different forms—the belief that you can shape yourself through will and effort. There is truth here! Effort is necessary. Discipline is required. But the error is thinking the agent is solid, permanent, real. The carpenter is as empty as the forms he creates.

Those who take conduct as permanent yet see cause and result as impermanent [2316-2324]—this is the inconsistency Longchenpa warns against! You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say the path is eternal while the walking of it is not. You cannot say practice matters while results don't exist. This is confusion, not wisdom.

And those who "wield evil mantras as chief" [2324]—using spiritual power to harm, to destroy, to get what they want. Are you not also doing this when you pray for your enemies to fail, when you use your practice to feel superior, when you manipulate others with spiritual language? The form is different, but the essence is the same.

The attachment to this world [2324-2335]—called "worldly benefit"—this is where most practitioners remain. They practice for health, wealth, success, good relationships. Nothing wrong with these! But do not mistake them for the path. They are the byproducts, not the goal.

All these wrong views [2421] gather into permanence and interruption. But the Middle Way avoids both. Not grasping at existence, not grasping at non-existence. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Emptiness appears as cause and effect. This is the recognition that cuts through all three hundred sixty views in a single stroke.
