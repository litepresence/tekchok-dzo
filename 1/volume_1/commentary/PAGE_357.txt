[14754-14761] Ha! You think you know this body, practitioner? Cut here—liver diseases flee. That short rut inside—the kha kha small heat channel—cut it for phlegm. Dza at the bile corner of the elbow—that's the right upper channel—cut for lung disease. Left side too, dza dwells—the left upper channel—yellow phlegm flees. Don't you see? These points aren't anatomy—they're where your energy knots itself into delusion!

[14762-14778] Center back of the knee—ta dwells straight—back channel neck completion—cut for upper body disease. Between thumb and forefinger, one tsen span—Ta dwells—heart channel white woman—cut for kidney, bile, heart. Straight center back, tha dwells—great back channel—back taste disease flees. Little toe's outer corner, da dwells—liver channel hron bu—hand disease. Big toe's back straight, dha dwells—bile channel ghan dhe—head disease. All these doors in your very flesh!

[14779-14793] Middle finger's back, na dwells—stomach branch—poison flees. Ring finger's back, ta dwells—spleen branch—spleen disease. Ring finger back straight, tsa dwells—kidney crooked channel—kidney disease. Little toe's back, da—the male crooked channel—male disease. Palm center, dha dwells—black liver channel—male liver disease. This is your body, fool! Not meat and bone—the mandala itself! Cut through the knot and recognize! Emaho!
