You who wish to know the highest yoga—attend! Lines 3278-3284: The inner five actions and afflictions are completely purified. The five secret objects and faculties are completely purified. The five families become Buddhas as one's own self. Meditating on commitment deity and self as brothers and friends. Knowing no good cause for deity. Accomplishment arises from oneself. Realizing no bad cause for self, now as clear deity form in the illusion body—surpassing the lower.

This is the yoga tantra view. You and the deity are non-dual! Not two, not one—beyond such concepts. The deity does not exist as something separate from you; you do not exist as something separate from the deity. Like water and wetness—can you separate them?

The established view of yoga, lines 3289-3309: The doors of entry are the five manifest enlightenments. The view of realization as deity and friend. Keeping the three samayas of protection without shame. Pure conduct neither refutes nor establishes. The five enlightenments are practiced: enlightenment through the door of seat, form, emblem, generation, syllables and letters.

The three shameless ones—what are they? Shamelessness through commitment deity, through master, disciples, and friends, through one's own mind (lines 3301-3304). What does this mean? In lower vehicles, you maintain shame and decorum—"I am the practitioner, that is the deity, I must be careful not to offend." But here, you realize deity and yogi are also oneself. Desiring the manner of brother and friend. Meditating on deity and mandala as non-dual with self.

Deity also arises from self and dissolves into self. Desiring the radiation and gathering of self and deity.

Do you see? The deity is your own display. The mandala is your own mind. You are not worshipping something external; you are recognizing your own nature!

Now the seventh vehicle, Mahāyoga, line 3311: The presentation of the mahāyoga tantra vehicle—surpassing the lower. Relying on the outer three and the five whites, etc. Conducting bath, purity, fasting, and dwelling, tormenting. Conducting the inner five meats and five nectars, etc. (lines 3314-3316).

The lower vehicles could not meditate on deity face union. The inner surpasses through ability. The outer does not realize the indivisible true view. The inner surpasses through realization (lines 3317-3321).

Here you enter the secret mantrāyana in earnest. The five meats and five nectars—substances the lower vehicles reject. Why? Because the lower vehicles are still caught in accepting and rejecting, pure and impure. But in Mahāyoga, you realize that all phenomena are the display of wisdom. What appears impure is itself the deity. What seems poison is itself amrita.

This is not a license for wild behavior. It is a recognition of the equal nature of all phenomena. When you truly realize this, you are beyond the duality of pure and impure. But if you merely pretend, you are like a fox wearing a lion's skin—dangerous to yourself!
