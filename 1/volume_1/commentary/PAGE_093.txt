You who would understand the mind's nature—look! Lines 3636-3642: That-on division six: result mind's arising-place desired mind's direction; deviation-obscuration beyond mind's direction; reasoning confused compounded mind's direction; extreme-falling without self-arising primordial wisdom's mind's direction; direction-holding objects self-established mind's direction; established-tenets intellect-free distinguishing mind's direction.

Six ways of pointing to mind—six doors through which you might recognize it. The first, lines 3643-3649: Dharma-nature change-place without mind-on change without. Phenomena self-liberated desired made not-arose spontaneously-complete called unconditioned three-realms basis established samsara-on beginning without end. Final birthless spontaneously-complete basis-establishment called.

That also primordially-established without repetition. Self-established without antidote. Effort-without various extremes without spontaneously-complete called desired.

Dharrmanature has no place to change—mind has no change. Phenomena are spontaneously complete, not made, not arising from conditions. This is the unconditioned, the basis of the three realms. Samsara has no beginning and no end—not because it is eternal, but because it was never truly established!

You search for the beginning of samsara—when did it start? You search for its end—when will it finish? But these questions assume samsara is real! Like searching for the beginning and end of a dream. The dream appears, but has it truly begun? It ceases, but has it truly ended?

Second, lines 3650-3660: Eight-stages intellect-examined basis-from deviated dharmas called. Non-existence direction-falling spontaneously-complete on relying. Existence direction-holding extremes including deviated. Non-existence cause non-existence self-arising deviated. This desire word-only-in established essence intellect-and separation. Cause-conditions applied point-by unmade self-arising.

Unmade cause-less primordially-pure obscurations-and separation dharma-nature called desired. That also deviated-in dharma-nature-from departed place without. Cause-less result-from beyond basis is. Obscuration path-from beyond actions virtue-vice whatever-by stained without basis called.

Those who examine with intellect, who rely on the eight stages of reasoning—they are deviated! Falling into the extreme of non-existence, relying on spontaneous completion. Holding to existence, including extremes, deviated. Holding to non-existence as cause, deviated from self-arising.

The dharma-nature is causeless, unmade, primordially pure. Obscurations are separate from it—not that they need to be removed, but that they never truly touched it. Like clouds and sky—the clouds appear in the sky but do not stain it. When they dissolve, the sky was never not pure.

Third, lines 3661-3671: Mind's aspect definitely known samsara-nirvana source pressed called. Basis natural-state without arrangement. Self-arising mind-primordial-wisdom directions everywhere arisen self-nature that-from birthless. Actions virtue-vice without known.

Thus birthless mind-from appearances various-in appear because. Play cessation without samsara-nirvana's dharmas accepting without known. Thus play-basis's characteristic non-dual reasoning-by essence non-different known. Thus non-dual dharma intellectually analyzed not. Essence-itself self-liberated reasoning-by all dharma-nature beyond not. That also basis mind-itself unaltered reasoning-by deluded considered.

When you definitely know the aspect of mind, you have pressed the source of samsara and nirvana. The basis is the natural state, without arrangement. Self-arising mind-primordial-wisdom arises everywhere, birthless. Actions, virtue, vice—known without being anything.

Appearances appear from the birthless mind—why? Because the play has no cessation! Samsara and nirvana's dharmas are accepted without being anything. The characteristic of the play-basis is non-dual—its essence is non-different. This non-dual dharma cannot be intellectually analyzed. Its essence is self-liberated—all is beyond dharmata. Yet the basis, mind itself unaltered, is considered deluded by reasoning!

Do you see the irony? The very mind that searches for understanding is itself what needs to be recognized. Like an eye trying to see itself—it cannot, yet it is always seeing.
