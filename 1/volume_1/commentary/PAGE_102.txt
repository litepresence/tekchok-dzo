You who would know the cycles of teaching—look! Lines 4020-4024: Divided, there are four: The outer cycle; The inner cycle; The secret cycle; The unsurpassable secret cycle.

Four cycles of the explanation lineage. Like four concentric circles, each deeper than the last. Or like peeling an onion—each layer reveals another, until you reach the heart.

The essence of the outer cycle, lines 4025-4028: Without abandoning afflictions, the five poisons dwell as path-vehicles. Self-nature without effort or establishment—whatever appears arises as dharmatā. Characteristic without parts—emptiness nowhere divided.

Without abandoning afflictions—you don't need to get rid of your anger, desire, ignorance. The five poisons dwell as path-vehicles—they are the very fuel for liberation! Self-nature without effort—you don't work at this. Whatever appears arises as dharmata—naturally, spontaneously. Characteristic without parts—emptiness is not divided into pieces; it is whole, complete.

The essence of the inner cycle, lines 4029-4033: Not possessing form, the markless dharmatā. Self-nature without coming or going, the wisdom always dwelling at all times. Characteristic: from the aspect of solidity, arising like a root; from the aspect of twisting, arising like a trunk; from the aspect of clarity, arising like a flower; from the aspect of ripening, arising like a fruit.

Not possessing form—dharmata has no shape, no color, no size. Markless—no signs to identify it. Without coming or going—it does not arrive from somewhere or depart to somewhere. Always dwelling at all times—not sometimes present, sometimes absent. Always!

The characteristic described through the tree metaphor: solidity like a root (grounded), twisting like a trunk (dynamic), clarity like a flower (beautiful, open), ripening like a fruit (result of practice). These are aspects of your own mind's display.

The essence of the secret cycle, lines 4034-4038: Pointing out and realization attained simultaneously, depending completely on the three: hearing, contemplation, and meditation. Self-nature: breath cessation and buddhahood simultaneously, depending completely on effort, establishment, and familiarization-power. Characteristic: buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneously, depending completely on accumulation and merit.

Pointing out and realization simultaneous—not gradual, not step by step. When the teacher points, and you recognize—that moment is complete. Depending on hearing, contemplation, meditation—you need to hear the teaching, think about it, meditate on it. Then recognition can occur.

Breath cessation and buddhahood simultaneously—in advanced practice, when the breath stops, buddhahood is present. Depending on effort, establishment, familiarization—you must practice, you must become familiar with the nature.

The essence of the unsurpassable secret cycle—this is the highest, the peak, the absolute. It transcends all the others while including them. The essence of all essences. The nature of your own mind, completely naked, completely revealed.

Do not think these four cycles are separate teachings for separate people. They are one teaching viewed from different depths. Like a mountain seen from different distances—same mountain, different perspectives. Come closer and closer until you are the mountain itself!
