[9109-9117] Listen well, dear practitioner! Longchenpa unfolds the mandala of methods like a merchant counting treasures. The complete examination of dreams—good and bad omens—six in number for those who elaborate. Then the progression: elaboration-without's outer, inner, secret, and complete—nine, thirteen, seventeen, twenty-one. Do you see the pattern? Each layer adds four, like rings expanding in a pond!

For the Shravakas—six; for the Pratyekabuddhas—five more, making eleven; for the Bodhisattvas—four, totaling fifteen. These are not just numbers, dear one! They represent how methods multiply as compassion deepens, as the view widens!

[9118-9128] Now the inner empowerments! Kriya—nine, making twenty-four; Upa—nine, thirty-three; Yoga—nine, forty-two. The secret empowerments: Maha—twelve, fifty-four; Anu—six, sixty complete; Ati—four, sixty-four. See how Atiyoga has the fewest methods? Not because it's deficient, but because it's complete! When recognition dawns, who needs elaborate techniques?

The very-without-elaboration: sixty-four becomes ninety-four. The without-elaboration: fifteen makes hundred-and-nine. The with-elaboration: six, plus eight conveyance dharmas, fifteen. These aren't abstract mathematics—these are the pathways from confusion to recognition, from bondage to liberation!

[9129-9133] Look at the outer empowerments of without-elaboration's with-elaboration: lama's action and student's action—two. Inner: mandala and vase—four. Secret: mandala's well-explained dharma—five; vase's well explanation—five, making ten. Each number is a door, practitioner! Enter through any, and you reach the same palace. But Atiyoga's door is widest—no door at all! Emaho!
