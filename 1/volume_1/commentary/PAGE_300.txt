Dear practitioner, abandon false refuge! Lines [12455-12474] reveal the six ignorances that bind you!

Vow-breaking actions many done! Mind definitely placed! All these by-means-of appearance to "I"-by-means-of be! Other-by-means-of be think! Definitely place mind!

This grasping thought is ignorance itself! Remedy path-by-means-of ignorance? No! Mind six gather-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of path obscure! Mind-by-means-of wisdom not-see! Clear not give!

Wisdom to thought not-possess! Mind from move-maker exist-by-means-of cause! Buddha-by-means-of path obscure! Artificial path-by-means-of ignorance called!

Not-know confuse-by-means-of ignorance! Self-by-means-of appearance-by-means-of light-in exist not-know! Again again samsara cause! Samsara-in samsara!

Thus ignorance six-as arise-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of appearance not-know! Ignorance sentient-being-by-means-of delusion manner!

First spontaneous from self arise! Self face not-know-by-means-of awareness from! End delusion cease time later not-pure! Lineage cut! Stain what be! Samsara first-last! Buddha last not-possess!

Like a man lost in a dream—searching for the dreamer who is himself! Like a mirror seeking its own reflection—it already shows everything!

You wander endlessly, creating the prison of "I" and "mine"! The remedy is not another path! The remedy is recognizing the path-maker is the path itself!

Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury—from this wisdom appears!

Emaho! The ignorance that wisdom itself reveals!
