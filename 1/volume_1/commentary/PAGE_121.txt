COMMENTARY ON PAGE 121

Listen, you who seek liberation! Longchenpa here shows us the tantras like a merchant displaying his wares—eighteen wrathful black ones, sixteen sequences, and more. But do not be fooled by the counting, you! (lines 1-41)

These tantras are not books on a shelf, not scriptures to be worshipped from afar. They are like maps drawn in the sky—visible yet empty, pointing to what has always been right here in your own mind. The Snake-Knot Tantra (line 1)—what is this snake but your own confusion, coiled around itself? And what cuts it? Not a blade from outside, but rigpa seeing its own face. Self-liberated, just as a knot unties itself when seen clearly.

The Great Garuda (line 3)—ah, this is you! Going through space without effort, without flapping wings, without destination. Have you not noticed? When you cease struggling, the sky is already open. The view is not something to be achieved, you fool! It is the very space in which you move.

And the River Tantra (line 7)—blessings flowing like water. Do you see? You are standing in this river now, have always been standing in it. The empowerment is not a ceremony performed once upon a time. It is this very awareness reading these words, self-arisen, never apart from you.

Longchenpa lists these treasures (lines 11-73), but I tell you—do not grasp at the list! The Treasury Tantra (line 11) says whatever desired arises from the wealthy treasury. What treasury? Your own mind! Richer than all the jewels of the three times. Whatever you need, it is already given. Why do you seek outside?

These eighteen wrathful ones (lines 13-17)—they protect the teachings, yes. But what teachings? The teaching that there is nothing to protect, no one to protect it. They guard the gateless gate. When you recognize that samsara itself is self-liberated through these tantras (line 53), what need for protection?

The Ocean, Sun, Lion, Mountain-King (lines 55-58)—these are not far away. Look at your own mind: vast as ocean, bright as sun, fearless as lion, unmoving as mountain. These tantras do not give you what you lack. They point to what you have never lost.

So read these words, but do not stop at the words. Let them cut through, like the Razor Tantra (line 13) says—cutting whatever it touches. Cut your concepts. Cut your grasping. Cut even the idea of cutting. Then rest, you, in what remains.

That is the purpose.
