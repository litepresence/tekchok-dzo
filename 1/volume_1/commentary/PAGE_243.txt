COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 243

You think samaya is some pristine thing that once broken, stays broken? Listen to Longchenpa here, at lines [9820-9835]. He speaks of early signs of deterioration—unhappiness arising, diseases, epidemics, spirits and misleaders. You feel these and you panic. "My samaya is broken!" you cry. But look—are these not just mind's own display? Sickness and suffering arise from the thought that something is wrong. The fever is not the problem. The thought "I have a fever and this is bad"—that is the real fever.

At lines [9826-9835], he lists terrible consequences—killing sentient beings, going to hell, losing sight, leprosy, thieves, punishment, death of children and wife, enemies rising. You read this and fear grips your heart. But understand: these are not punishments from some angry deity. These are the natural results of believing in separation, of grasping at self and other. When you break samaya, you break the recognition of your own nature. And when that recognition is lost, of course hell appears! Hell is not a place below the earth. Hell is the mind that grasps at "me" and "mine."

But then, you ask, "Can it be repaired?" At lines [9836-9859], Longchenpa gives you hope. Three methods he teaches. For body deterioration—scripture and ganacakra, three circles correctly done. You think this means elaborate rituals, expensive offerings. Foolish! The scripture is the recognition of your own nature. The ganacakra is feeding all beings with the understanding that they are not separate from you. The three circles—doer, deed, and done-to—are empty from the start. To "correctly do" means to do without the doer.

For speech deterioration at lines [9843-9849]—lamp rituals, confess-repair recitations. You want to chant a hundred times and be free. But speech is purified when you recognize that the words you speak are empty resounding, like an echo in a valley. Who is confessing? What is there to repair? The confession itself dissolves when you see the confessor has no substance.

And for mind deterioration at lines [9850-9859]—offer substance to the teacher, offer wealth-accumulation. You think this means gold and silver, horses and cattle. No! Offer your thoughts. Offer your grasping. Offer the very mind that thinks "I need to offer." When you offer everything, what remains? That remainder is the dharmakaya, and that is the only offering worth making.

At lines [9860-9866], he speaks of the protection method. Fault and quality seen with mindfulness and awareness, pure continuum bound. You hear "bind" and you want to tie something up. But this binding is like binding space with space. Mindfulness is not remembering. It is not forgetting. Awareness is not watching. It is the natural clarity that has always been present. Samaya is protected when you do not protect it, when you let it be as it is for even one aeon without abandoning it—meaning, without abandoning your own nature.

At lines [9867-9871], he says the student should protect what they do not know. You think this means blind faith. No! It means protect the not-knowing itself. Do not cover it with concepts. Let the not-knowing be naked, and in that nakedness, wisdom appears. The teacher's command is not an order from outside. It is your own deepest nature calling you home. Will you listen?
