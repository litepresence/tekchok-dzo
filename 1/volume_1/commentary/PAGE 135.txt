COMMENTARY ON PAGE 135

Root prefix explanation, branch prefix explanation (lines 1-3). First: root letters thirty-four's context made, NYA and WA two breaths—one made here (lines 5-9). Prefix NYA and single WA arranged, these long A and not-uniform double-stacked (lines 11-15).

Listen, you who are confused by Sanskrit grammar! The prefixes are not mere linguistic decorations. They are the energetic modifiers, the conditions that shape the root awareness. NYA and WA—breath sounds. The breath of life, the wind of prana.

Single appearing, breath great within—meaning double-stacked abiding (line 17). Separately arranged thus: A KṢA KHA GHA DHA / CCA CHA JA JHA ÑĀ / ṬṬĀ ṬHĀ ḌṆA ḌHA ÑĀ / TA THA DA DHA NĀ / PĀ A PHA KHA BHA BHA MĀ A / YĀ ṢĀ RA LA MĀ ṢA BHA ṢA HA MĀ / KṢAḤ: these prefixes with reality joined (lines 19-33).

Appearance-emptiness, method-wisdom, father-mother, sphere-wisdom—pure and spontaneous individually joined explained existing (lines 35-43).

From Rangshar (line 45): thus letters' meanings joined, reality-basis thus applied. That prefix's power explained (lines 47-51). Thus it is spoken (line 53).

The prefixes joined with reality! Appearance-emptiness, method-wisdom, father-mother, sphere-wisdom. These are not abstract philosophical pairs. They describe the structure of your own experience. Every appearance is empty. Every method is wisdom in expression. Every father is mother, every mother is father—non-dual.

Second: root letters those to: NA RO, GU GU, DRENG BU, YA-tagged, RA-tagged—five tagged: awareness, wisdom five's self-light etc. shown—manner thus (lines 55-71).

These letter types—please examine carefully (line 1 of next section). Stacked letters 1. Note: these letters' nature double-stacked is prefix, root prefix (lines 3-7). NA RO etc. are called "branch." "Prefix of prefix" called (lines 9-11).

Explanation manner: roots earlier syllable-joined, explained (line 13). Letters RA and LA: two, CA-tag not, others all obtained—explained (lines 15-17).

Also from Rangshar (line 19): all branches thus are. Explanation manner this like: prefix and branch connection—explanation manner prefix explains. Letter's syllable meaning applies. Letter's explanation manner: sound-like explained. Letter RA: CA not. Letter's example, symbol meaning joined—thus all abiding (lines 21-37). Thus it is spoken (line 39).

Third: saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's explanation manner, definite—two: saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's explanation manner (lines 41-43).

First: tantra's occasion, prefixless letters: saṃsāra's dharmas, own awareness arise—explained (lines 45-47). That also: KA-like, saṃsāra's primordial sphere, deluded, established, ignorance etc., kleśas' collections, with—called, etc.—explained (lines 49-51).

Prefix and branch: whatever arisen, nirvāṇa—explained (lines 53-53). That also: prefix arisen, appearance-emptiness etc., dual explained, branch arisen: kāyas five etc., five-group, three-group, six-group etc., branch's number suitable—explained (lines 55-57).

Also from Rangshar (line 59): there, letters all's explanation manner types two gathered: nirvāṇa-letter explanation manner and saṃsāra's letters explanation manner (lines 61-67). Nirvāṇa's letters: prefix and branch—explained (lines 69-71). Impure saṃsāra's letters: first MA—explained (lines 73-75).

Thus explanation manner types two by, letters all's meanings liberated (lines 77-79). Thus it is spoken (line 81).

Do you understand? Samsara and nirvana are distinguished by the presence or absence of prefixes! Prefixless letters are samsara—the root without modification. With prefixes and branches, nirvana—the enlightened expression. Yet both arise from the same letters! This is the non-duality of samsara and nirvana.
