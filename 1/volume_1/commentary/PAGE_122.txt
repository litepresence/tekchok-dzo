Now Longchenpa brings us to the heart of the matter—the three heart essences of tantra. Listen well, you who are weary of wandering! (lines 1-5)

Rigpa self-arisen, self-liberated, letterless—these three. What does this mean for you, right now? Like a king ruling people (line 7)—do you see? The king does not create the kingdom. The kingdom is already there. He simply recognizes his position and rules. Rigpa is like this king. It does not manufacture reality. It is the natural ruler, self-arisen, complete.

You have been searching for liberation like a subject paying taxes (line 17), working hard, struggling, serving. But the tantras tell us—self-liberated liberates that very meaning (line 19). The very thing you are seeking is the thing doing the seeking! Like trying to find your own head—you will never see it with your eyes, yet it has never been absent.

The three essences are shown (lines 25-35)—Samantabhadra mind-mirror, Vajrasattva heart-mirror, jewel spread. What are these but your own nature reflected back at you? When you reach the three mountains' peaks (line 33), you see all the low valleys. This is not climbing, you! This is simply stopping where you are and looking. The view has always been panoramic. You were just looking down at your feet.

The three flowers (lines 37-47)—pearl garland, auspicious beauty, lion power. Like three suns rising (line 45), clearing the world's darkness. But I ask you—where does the sun rise from? Does it travel from somewhere else? No! It is simply revealed when the earth turns. Your wisdom is like this sun—always shining, merely obscured by the clouds of your concepts.

The one summary (lines 49-55)—perfect self-arisen. Like a fort's foundation well-laid. Do you understand? Everything else—the practices, the rituals, the teachings—they are like roofs built upon this foundation. But if the foundation is rotten, what good the roof? The foundation is rigpa. Know this, and everything else falls into place naturally.

And when you know the appearance depth-complete (lines 57-61), you reach the fort's peak unpenetrable by armies. What armies? The armies of doubt, of distraction, of the eight worldly concerns. They cannot touch you when you abide in this recognition. You fear no samsara (line 61) because you see it has never been separate from nirvana.

This is not philosophy, you! This is your immediate experience. Look now—what is aware of these words? That is the king, the sun, the foundation. Rest there.
