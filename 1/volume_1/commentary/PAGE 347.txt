[14172-14176] Roma essence bliss, Kyangma essence emptiness, Kundarma essence bliss-emptiness non-dual. These are not essences found in channels. They are labels for your own face before you had a name.

[14177-14182] Seven channels' dharmata. Food taking, artery wide, belly big, belly small, crooked vomit, sudden disease. All this is body-talk. The dharmata has no belly.

[14183-14196] Heat rise-fall, body heat, thirst, not-thirst. Cut attachment to food, clothing, drink. Good advice for beggars. But do you know who is hungry?

[14197-14205] Light-meaning, body form longs-sku, speech meditation, cease chos-nyid appear. Three mandala—sku three's mandala. The mandala maker has no shape.

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
