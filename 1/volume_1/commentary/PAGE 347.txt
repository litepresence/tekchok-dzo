[14172] Romā's essence is bliss—with special method, grasping sphere dharmatā pure essence liberates!

[14173-14176] Rkyangma's essence is emptiness—prajna pure, grasping mind's conception liberates into dharmatā! Kundarma's essence bliss-emptiness non-dual, union non-dual, liberating from grasping-grasped, wisdom spontaneously shows!

[14177-14182] Seventh: these channels' dharmatā—romā takes food, food's essence-impurity, digests dharmatā. If its inside wide, person big-bellied; thin, small-bellied; crooked, always vomiting, not taking food, many adventitious diseases!

[14183-14191] Rkyangma—body's heat increasing-decreasing. This channel thin, body naturally much heat; wide, small, always cold; crooked and changing as before. Kundarma—body's thirst characteristic, showing non-thirst dharmatā. This thin, never thirsty; wide, great thirst desire.

Do you see? Your belly, your temperature, your thirst—all from these channels! Recognize their nature and liberation is immediate! Emaho!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
