COMMENTARY ON PAGE 131

Vajra-holder, Vajrasattva visualized (lines 1-3). Dharma light-rays pervading sky, emanated—beings in fields of dust-count hear, ignorance's sleep is awakened, wisdom's meaning obtained, liberation's path entered (lines 5-13).

Listen to this, you who feel small and powerless! The visualization is not fantasy. When you visualize Vajrasattva, you are not making something up. You are recognizing what is already present. The dharma light-rays pervading the sky—this is your own awareness, extending everywhere, touching all beings. The "fields of dust-count" are the countless thoughts and perceptions. They all hear the dharma when awareness recognizes itself.

Word-meaning's abode realized, meditating: listeners, heroes of the lineage, and mind-consorts, knowing dakinis' appearance—practicing mind's sublime clear light, realized, focused (lines 15-23).

The dakinis are not external spirits! They are the appearances of your own mind, dancing in space. When you recognize them as such, they become allies, not obstacles. The clear light is not something to be achieved through effort. It is the natural luminosity of your own awareness, always present, merely obscured by grasping.

Self and limitless sentient beings are primordially Buddha—knowing that, self-nature, supreme awakening generated (lines 25-31).

This is the key! You are primordially Buddha. All beings are primordially Buddha. Not will be, not can become. ARE. Right now. This is not wishful thinking. This is the nature of reality. When you know this, truly know it in your bones, supreme awakening is not generated as something new. It is recognized as what has always been.

Thus: In actual Akanishtha's field, appearance: natureless mandala of five perfections' dharma-wheel arisen—for sentient beings and teachings to abide long: dedication: May the Buddha's teachings flourish and spread! May all sentient beings be blissful and happy! May they practice dharma day and night! May self and other benefit arise spontaneously! Thus to be spoken (lines 33-46).

Akanishtha—the highest pure realm. But where is it? Not somewhere else! It is this very appearance, when recognized as natureless, as the mandala of five perfections. The five perfections are not somewhere else. They are the perfection of your own teacher, place, retinue, dharma, and time—right here, right now, when recognized.

Third topic: arisen-basis letters' sound and meaning explained—two: letter-cloud's nature generally shown, and abode-definite specifically explained (lines 49-53). First has four: abode-nature-meaning's letter, body-abode-channel's letter, expression-sound's letter, result's ultimate letter (lines 55-63).

Now we come to the letters. Do not think these are just Sanskrit phonemes! They are the very structure of reality, the patterns through which awareness expresses itself. The letter-cloud is like the sky filled with writing—everywhere, yet empty.

First: Mind-nature, naturally clear light, self-arisen wisdom—transcending eternalism and nihilism, coming and going—is the nature (lines 67-67). Called "letter of sphere-ultimate reality" (line 69). From the Secret Essence of Magical Display: mind-nature is letter's nature—letter: wish-fulfilling jewel cloud (lines 71-75). Thus (line 77).

Mind-nature IS the letter's nature! The letter is not something else. It is your own mind, naturally clear light, self-arisen wisdom. It transcends eternalism and nihilism—it is not permanent, not annihilated. It does not come or go. This is the true letter, the wish-fulfilling jewel cloud.

Second: In the body's four channel-wheels' center, within the three heart-channels existing as three pillars—OM AH HUM: these self-arisen letters three, colors white-red-blue three, abiding (lines 79-84).

The body is the mandala! The channels are not just physical structures. They are the pathways of awareness. OM AH HUM—white, red, blue—body, speech, mind. These are already present in your heart center. You do not need to create them. You need to recognize them.
