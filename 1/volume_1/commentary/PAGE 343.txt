[14035-14046] Five types of women's channels described like breeds of cattle. Elephant-nose, lotus-mouth, line-drawn, conch-curl. You study these to know the world? Study instead the one who looks at these descriptions.

[14047-14055] Glang-sna-ma, Padma-can, Ri-mo-can, Dung-can-ma. Names for what has no name. The woman who has these channels—does she know your mind? Does your mind know her channels? Both are empty labels.

[14056-14076] Five poisons, thirty-two diseases, ten menstruation afflictions—all from channels changing, from bindu moving. But who moves? The wind that moves has no home. Find the unmoved before tracing the moved.

[14077] Situation superior, vessel superior—superior to what? To the grasping that calls one thing higher than another. Drop that, where is superior?

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
