Third: sound's letter is: speech—speaking ones (lines 1-3). Cause: root letters, wind-moved, arise (line 5). Condition: tongue and palate's action, arise (line 7).

Listen! Sound is not separate from the one who speaks. The root letters are moved by wind—the wind of prana, the energy of awareness. The tongue and palate are the conditions. This is the dependent arising of speech—wind moves, conditions meet, sound emerges. But from where? From nowhere! From the same emptiness from which all things emerge.

That also: within, A-like arises, throat: KA etc. arise, tongue-tip: TA THA etc. arise, tongue-tip and palate two meet: crown arises—called so (lines 9-13). RA LA-like: tongue and palate strongly joined: ṬA ṬHA arise (lines 15-15). Lips: PA PHA BA BHA MA said like—these sounds: whatever expressed, arise depending on those places (lines 17-19).

Each sound has its place of arising—throat, tongue-tip, palate, crown, lips. This is the anatomical structure of sacred speech. But more than anatomy, it is the energetic structure. The sounds arise in specific locations because those locations correspond to different energies, different aspects of awareness.

Fourth: ultimate result's letter is: Buddha's speech, sixty vowels, appear—from enjoyment-body's channels, abodes, pure letters (lines 21-25). Letters emanated: in sky, dharma-sounds famous (line 27). Letters emanated: Buddha's body etc. become, sentient beings' benefit performing (lines 29-29). Enjoyment-body and emanation-body's root letters: wisdom five's appearance adorned (lines 31-31).

This existing: depending, Buddha-time, sūtras and tantras enumerate measureless sentient beings appear (lines 33-33). Emanation: sentient beings' benefit arising (lines 35-35).

Second: abodes definite, specifically explained—five: root letters briefly shown, branch prefixes extensively divided, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa explained manner definite, abode enjoyment explained, those expression manner shown (lines 37-57).

First: KA A KHA GA NGA / CA CHA JA VA / ṬA ṬHA ḌA ṆA / TA THA DA NA / PA PHA BA MA / YA RA LA / ṢA ṢA SA HA KṢAḤ (lines 59-73).

The thirty-four consonants. These are not arbitrary! Each contains an entire universe of meaning. KA—the first, the primordial. A—the life-giver. Each letter is a complete mandala. Each sound is a complete teaching.

When you recite these, do not just make sounds! Recognize that each sound is the expression of awareness, each vibration is the play of wisdom. The letters are not external to you. They are the very structure of your being.
