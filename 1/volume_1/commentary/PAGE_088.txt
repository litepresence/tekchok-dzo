[3247]

You who enter Mahāyoga—listen well! Lines 3323-3327: The essence is the indivisible true, pure, equal primordial wisdom, liberation attained in one life through its play. The etymology: Accomplishing great purpose through slight effort—the inner means vehicle. The purpose: Obtaining the two accomplishments in one life. The result: Reaching the level of Vajradhara in this life.

This life! Not countless eons hence, but now! This is the promise of the secret mantrāyana. Do you believe it? Or do you think "I am not ready, I need more practice, maybe in a future life..." This is the deception of your own mind!

Divided: Mahāyoga tantra, Anuyoga scripture, Atiyoga instruction—three (lines 3328-3330). These are the inner three, the highest of the high. Mahāyoga emphasizes the generation stage. Anuyoga emphasizes the completion stage. Atiyoga transcends both.

In Mahāyoga, lines 3336-3361: Meditating through the three doors of concentration, the main means of the generation stage, on the indivisible true, great clear empty light primordial wisdom. The basis is the mind itself, ultimate, free from elaboration, great distinguished, without effort—the great itself. The basis to be accomplished, accomplishing—realizing near the mind's characteristics.

The three concentrations—the concentration of suchness, free from thought, crystal clarity; the all-illuminating concentration, meditating without distraction, clearly; the concentration of cause, meditating on the three-stacked being from Hūṃ (lines 3420-3425).

What are these three concentrations? They are the framework of your practice. First, suchness—resting in the nature of mind, free from conceptual thought. Second, all-illuminating—clarity, the radiance of awareness, without distraction. Third, cause—the generation of deity from emptiness, the play of wisdom.

But do not think these are three separate things! Like a lamp—its nature is fire, its radiance is light, its function is to illuminate. Three aspects, one lamp. Three concentrations, one wisdom.

The tradition of wishing the main accomplishment, lines 3362-3367: Accomplishing body, carrying to the path of Manjushri's mandala wheel. Accomplishing speech, making Buddha of the lotus family. Accomplishing mind, making Buddha of the heruka vajra family. Accomplishing qualities, making Buddha of the jewel family. Accomplishing activity, accomplishing Buddha of the karma family.

Each deity is a door to the same realization. Manjushri for body, Amitabha for speech, Heruka for mind, Ratnasambhava for qualities, Amoghasiddhi for activity. But remember: these are not truly separate. They are the display of the one dharmakaya, appearing as five for those who need such forms.

The essence of these: Accomplishing each deity through three concentrations without duality (line 3369). Without duality! This is the key. Not "I am here, deity is there." Not "I am ordinary, deity is pure." No! Non-dual means your awareness and the deity's awareness are not two.

Look at your own mind right now. Is it not clear? Is it not aware? This very clarity, this very awareness, is the deity. Why do you look elsewhere?
