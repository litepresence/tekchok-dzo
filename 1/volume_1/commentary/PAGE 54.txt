Here Longchenpa speaks of the hearer vehicle in detail [2538-2669], and you must not look down on it! The sravakas, the "hearers," follow the four truths with dedication that puts most of us to shame. They hear the Dharma, they practice, and they attain liberation—foe-destroyer status, with or without remainder [2538].

Their path is systematic: the four applications of mindfulness, the four right exertions, the four bases of miraculous power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, the eightfold path [2899-2902]. These are not outdated categories! They describe how mind training actually works.

First, mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena—this stabilizes you. Then right exertion to abandon the unwholesome and cultivate the wholesome—this energizes you. Then the bases of miraculous power—this concentrates you. Then faculties and powers—this makes practice unshakeable. Then the branches of enlightenment—this opens wisdom. Finally the eightfold path—this integrates everything into a complete way of being.

The Vaibhasikas and Sautrantikas debate about atoms and moments [2549, 2580], about what is ultimately real. The Vaibhasikas accept partless dust-atoms; the Sautrantikas say even these are conceptual. But both realize the person-selflessness—the "I" cannot be found in the aggregates. This is huge! Most beings never question the self at all. These practitioners analyze until they see: no self in form, in feeling, in perception, in formations, in consciousness. Where is it then? Nowhere!

Yet they stop halfway. They realize the person is empty, but they think dharmas—the atoms, the moments, the elements—are real. This is like cleaning your house thoroughly but leaving one room locked, one closet unexamined. The self-enlightened ones go a bit further, seeing that outer dharmas are also empty [2731], but they still grasp at the mind that knows this emptiness.

You who practice—do not repeat their error! When you realize emptiness, do not grasp at the realization. When you see no self, do not establish a "no-self" to cling to. Go all the way to the Middle Way, where even emptiness is empty, even liberation is not something to attain.
