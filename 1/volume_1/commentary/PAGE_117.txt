Pay attention now. This section is about clearing, stability, appearance, and emptying—four movements in one process. The three kayas, phenomena that have ripened to completion. But don't imagine emptiness as nothing, cut off and barren. And don't imagine clarity as something gradual, accumulating piece by piece. The three are inseparable: knowledge without direction, entity without marks, self-aware ultimate. Cut free from the four extremes—permanent/impermanent, existent/non-existent, etc. This is the mind of body and wisdom indivisible.

**The three clear aspects:**

When outer realms appear, awareness doesn't disappear into them. Awareness appears as kaya—form that is formless. Dimension displays its colors. Sky and awareness, dimension and awareness—appearing as one, no seam between them. You see a tree, awareness is the tree. You see the sky, awareness is the sky. Not two things. One display.

**The three stabilities:**

Faith that arises like this: unshakeable confidence in the view. Not belief from hearsay—direct recognition. The stability of realm: whatever appears, you don't get lost in it. You're holding the object like something grasped in your nose, never forgotten. The stability of decision: confusion has ceased, the cut is made. You know. No more doubt.

**The three non-returns:**

Here's liberation: when samsara itself is seen as primordially buddha. The moment of recognition—awareness has no further continuum. No root left to grow back. Awareness-body manifests, and delusions transform into pure appearances. You see the same world, but it's no longer binding. Dharmata appearing as manifold—and you rest in that, certain. No going back.

**The three appearances:**

Dimension appearing without day or night, without the markings of time. Awareness appearing without the dimming that comes when you lose clarity. Dharmata appearing without change, without needing to become something else. Thus liberated: delusion's appearances are self-pure. No cause for samsara left. Conditions cease of themselves.

**The three emptinesses:**

Awareness without comparison—nothing to measure it against, nothing to call it by. Delusion emptied at its root. Mind without conditions—when conceptual thought has no fuel, the fire burns out. Light without coming-and-going—no origin, no destination, no middle. The elements' conditions are empty.

**The three tantras:**

Basis, essence, and flower-tantra—shown separately but they're one essential nature, just viewed from different angles. How do these three proceed?

Basis-tantra shows reality as it is. Buddha and all beings arise from that—so the outer tantra, the basis-tantra, is established.

Stop here. Don't move. The basis is not something distant. It is what you are right now, looking at these words. Recognition happens or it doesn't. All the classifications are just ways to point you back to this moment, this awareness, this clarity that needs no improvement.
