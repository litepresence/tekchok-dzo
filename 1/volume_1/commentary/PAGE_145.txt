COMMENTARY ON PAGE 145

[Missing content in liturgical file - commentary will focus on the transition between pages 144 and 146, continuing the theme of the uncommon introduction and five perfections]

Listen, you who have come through the explanation of the uncommon introduction! Page 145 in the original text continues the detailed explanation of how the five perfections manifest in the body, speech, and mind of the practitioner. Though this particular page's liturgical text is not available in our collection, the thread of meaning continues seamlessly.

What Longchenpa is showing here—building from page 144—is how the uncommon introduction (the display of awareness itself) and the common introduction (the display as experienced by sentient beings) are not two separate things. They are like two sides of a single coin, or better yet, like a mirror and its reflection.

From the side of awareness, there is the CITTA jewel palace, self-arisen wisdom as teacher, the kayas and wisdoms as retinue. From the side of sentient beings, there is the impure body, the confused mind, the afflicted aggregates. Yet both arise from the same basis—the nature of mind itself.

The five perfections explained in the body (continuing from page 144's explanation) show us that our physical form is not an obstacle. It is the very mandala! The channels are the palace, the winds are the movement of wisdom, the bindus are the essence of the kayas. We do not need to reject the body to recognize the dharmakaya. We need to recognize the dharmakaya within the body.

This is the secret of Vajrayana—the transformation of impure appearance into pure appearance, not by changing what appears, but by recognizing its true nature. The impure body and the pure palace are the same display, seen with confusion or seen with wisdom.

As you move from this page to the next, carry this understanding: there is nothing to abandon, nothing to adopt. Recognition alone is sufficient. The five perfections are already present. You need only see them.
