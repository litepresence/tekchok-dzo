PAGE 70 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa speaks of the very extensive Great Vehicle [2523-2538]—all the Word gathered in three baskets, the twenty-one thousand, the eighty-four thousand dharma heaps. This is vast! But do not be overwhelmed.

The three baskets: Sutra (the discourses), Vinaya (discipline), and Abhidharma (higher knowledge). These contain everything the Buddha taught, organized for study and practice. And the tantras—the manifest great, the secret teachings that reveal what the sutras hint at. All of these are medicine for different ailments, food for different hungers.

"Regarding each antidote taming beings' thought accumulations, extensively many, inconceivable, transcending expression" [2526]. The teachings are not arbitrary! Each one addresses a specific confusion, a particular obscuration. The Buddha was like a master physician, prescribing different treatments for different conditions. What cures one patient might harm another. What liberates one mind might confuse another.

The categorization into nine vehicles [2538] is not for the sake of division, but for the sake of clarity. Just as a library organizes books so you can find what you need, the vehicles organize the teachings so you can find what suits your mind. But do not mistake the organization for the reality! The Dharma is one taste—liberation. The vehicles are fingers pointing at that moon.

The hearer vehicle explained in five aspects: essence, definition, purpose, fruit, and division [2538]. This systematic presentation is characteristic of Longchenpa's scholarship—thorough, comprehensive, leaving no room for confusion. But scholarship alone does not liberate! You must take these teachings into practice, into your life, into your very being.

The Vaibhasika and Sautrantika divisions [2538]—these are not merely historical schools. They represent approaches to understanding that are still present today. The analytical mind that wants to break everything down into parts (Vaibhasika) versus the fluid mind that sees everything as process (Sautrantika). Both have value. Both have limitations.

What matters is not which school you belong to, but whether you practice genuinely, whether you apply the teachings to transform your mind. A simple practitioner who meditates daily is superior to a scholar who knows all the classifications but does not practice.
