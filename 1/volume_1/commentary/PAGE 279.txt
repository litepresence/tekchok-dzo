COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 279

You who believe in the solidity of the world! Longchenpa tells you at lines [11607-11612] that the outer container is the five elements' mandala formation—earth, water, fire, wind, and the great space element. You walk on the earth and think "this is solid, this is real." You drink water and think "this is wet, this is real." But from what are these grasped? Thought and speech do not perceive their nature. They appear, yes, but their nature is not what you think.

At lines [11613-11626], that-from grasping thought speech not-perceive and, desire and, hatred and, delusion and, pride and, jealousy and, anger and six are. That-from beings types six arisen-are. Jealousy-from human-in form, anger-from god-in form, pride-from god not-in form, desire-from hungry-ghost-in form, delusion-from animal-in form, hatred black-from hell-in form-do. Thus types six appearance-in form-do. That cyclic-existence place-is. You think the six realms are far away, places you might go after death. Foolish! They are right here. When jealousy arises in your mind, you are in the human realm at that moment. When anger burns, you are in the god realm—or when pride towers, you create a god realm without form. Desire makes you a hungry ghost, delusion makes you an animal, hatred deep and black makes you experience hell. The cyclic existence is not a place. It is the place of your own mind's grasping.

At lines [11627-11642], that-also base-mode great one-from appearance-mode four like arisen-are, base-mode four-from appearance-means four like manifest-do, appearance great four are, spontaneous-presence various appearance-do, enjoyment-kaya mouth eye ear having light nature illusion body-as abide-do, emanation-kaya form like appearance-do, sentient-beings appearance-in distinct appearance-do, that-also sentient-beings appearance-means obscuration-do said speak-do. The six realms arise from one great base-mode, in four appearance-modes. From four base-modes, four appearance-means manifest. The four great appearances—spontaneous presence appearing variously, enjoyment kaya with mouth, eye, ear, having light nature, abiding as illusion body, emanation kaya appearing like form, sentient beings appearing distinct. This is called sentient beings' appearance-means obscuration.

At lines [11637-11642], that all gather-if, primordial-purity-from cloud not-having space like appearance under, spontaneous-presence door eight emergence-mode-from primordial-awareness appearance enjoyment-kaya and, that potency-from directly five-families appearance measureless-from, nature emanation-kaya appearance-in, downward six realms pure-lands teacher and having, kayas three appearance three-stacked manifest-do base spontaneous-presence appearance-do. If you gather all this, from primordial purity like space without clouds, from spontaneous presence's eight door emergence-mode, primordial awareness appears as enjoyment kaya. From that potency, directly five families appear measureless. Nature emanation kaya appears in. Downward, six realms, pure lands, teacher—all having. Three kayas' appearance three-stacked manifest—this is base spontaneous presence's appearance.

At lines [11643-11646], self face-to appearance enjoyment-kaya beings-taming nature emanation buddhas all self base-to appearance potency is-but, now direction which-in not-exist that, self-awareness appearance is-therefore self-awareness and together abide-do. Self-face appearance, enjoyment kaya taming beings, nature emanation—all Buddhas are self-base's appearance potency. But now, in which direction does this not exist? Self-awareness appearance—therefore self-awareness together abides. Do you see? The pure lands and the hell realms, the Buddhas and the sentient beings—all are the display of your own base. They do not exist in any direction outside. They are self-awareness appearing to itself.

At lines [11646-11647], self-appearance six-realms appearance also other-in not-exist that impure cyclic-existence door like emergence-mode not-cease-from self-arise-therefore. Self-appearance, six realms appearance—also in other, not exist. That impure cyclic existence door, like emergence-mode not ceasing, therefore self-arises. The six realms are your own appearance. They do not exist in some "other" place. They self-arise from the door of impure cyclic existence that never ceases. But who made it impure? Your own not-recognizing. Your own grasping at self and other.

So look at the world around you. Is it solid? Is it real? Or is it the display of five elements, the play of spontaneous presence, the self-appearance of your own awareness? Do not be fooled by the outer container. Look at what contains it.
