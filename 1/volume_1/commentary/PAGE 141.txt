COMMENTARY ON PAGE 141

"Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter five—annotation (lines 1-3).

Thus it is called: NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KAYA SIDDHI BHĀRA (line 5).

Within these established sounds: DHARMA KAYA, SIDDHI, BHĀRA exist (line 7).

Their meaning: the pure body is shown by actual sound; the impure body is shown through establishment (lines 9-11).

Therein, the pure wisdom-body: this appearance, ceasing, immediately arises (lines 13-14).

The impure sentient beings' body is this very appearance as concreteness (line 16).

The wisdom-body: rigpa at the heart, empty-cognizing, meaning-wisdom (lines 18-18).

Dharmatā: permanent, unchanging—reversed from confusion (line 20). Rigpa's wisdom reversed from the world (line 21). Rigpa's compassion, unceasing, benefits beings (line 22).

Further, the stacked classes are shown (line 24): "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter six—annotation (lines 26-28).

Thus it is: E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA; AD MA KO TSAG KRA BA LO KI (line 30).

Its meaning enters light: rigpa's light, kāya's light, wisdom's light—these three gathered into dharmadhātu (lines 32-34).

This too: from dharmatā's equality, not gone beyond (line 36).

For the non-dual meaning, wisdom's self-nature: emptiness stacked—emptiness of sambhogakāya's equality, meaning of complete enjoyment body (lines 38-39).

Kāya beyond words, pervaded by clear light, whatever portion depends—nothing remains (lines 40-42).

The path has three: 1. the empty wisdom-path, 2. the clear light-path, 3. the unchanging rigpa's empty path (lines 44-47).

First: the lamp of the bodhi path. Second: wisdom's illusory body. Third: the precious body (lines 49-51).

These three too, in dharmadhātu's nature, are one taste: dharmatā's great equality's expanse, supreme, unchanging, not gone beyond (lines 53-55).

Further stacked classes: "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter seven—annotation (lines 57-59).

Thus it is: SHAM PADZRA MU TAD YA BYA NYA PRA PA RA DUS STAN KA HIH—its meaning (lines 1-3 of next section):

By wisdom's meaning, realized; time-unchanging wisdom, ignorance by nature conquered; dharmadhātu's equality, surrounded and endowed; in self always existing, pervasion threefold endowed; equality-day's wisdom, self-arisen (lines 5-9).

Further: "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter eight—annotation (lines 11-13).

Thus it is: MAṂ GAM HA SA HŪM—accomplishing, MA LA MA LA DHA THIM DHA THIM—its meaning (lines 15-15):

Self's rigpa, equal-pure body's form, realized. That too, by self-arisen emptiness-wisdom, pervaded, realized. That too, to self-entity's ground, complete parinirvāṇa, realized. Three kāyas, gathering-separating without, meaning realized. All dharmas, equality, non-dual, realized. From that, compassion unceasing, like sun-rays, shines. Conceptual wisdom, self-place grasped (lines 17-23).

Further: "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter nine—annotation (lines 25-27).

Thus it is: TA KA YU MU SHA SU MA HĀ DU BHĀRI KE HĀ KE HĀ—unchanging, three kāyas' ground, pressed. All-times wisdom, always abiding, dharma-pure wisdom-heart possessed; equality-wisdom's self-nature become. To emptiness, three compassions, one time arising—that too, unceasing manner, equality-wisdom's kāya, not gone beyond. Unchanging wisdom, self-constituent, explained (lines 29-35).

Sound's place, many letters stacked: vowel and NA RO below, in order given, with GU GU, thus read; head-circle below's top, placed. This letter-place is the bind of seventeen tantras' internals; wherever tantra's place arises, thus understand. These stacked letter examples, from Samantabhadra's mind-mirror arisen, like. This letter-wheel's order, tantra's difficult place, is (lines 37-43).

Do you see? Each stacked letter combination is a complete teaching! NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KAYA SIDDHI BHĀRA—the pure body, siddhi, bhara. The pure wisdom-body arising as this appearance. The impure body as concreteness. All explained in stacked letters.

And E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA—the three lights gathered into dharmadhātu. The three paths that are one taste in dharmadhatu.

And SHAM PADZRA MU TAD YA BYA NYA PRA PA RA DUS STAN KA HIH—wisdom realized, ignorance conquered, dharmadhatu equality, pervasion threefold, self-arisen wisdom.

And MAṂ GAM HA SA HŪM—self's rigpa realized, pervaded by emptiness-wisdom, complete parinirvana realized, three kayas non-dual, all dharmas equality, compassion shining.

And TA KA YU MU SHA SU MA HĀ DU BHĀRI KE HĀ KE HĀ—unchanging three kayas, all-times wisdom, equality-wisdom's nature, three compassions arising.

These are not random syllables! They are the encoded wisdom of the buddhas, the very structure of reality expressed in sound. When you recite these, if you recognize their meaning, you are not just making sounds. You are invoking the very qualities they represent.
