Look here, seeker of truth! Lines [12227-12246] trace the arising of delusion from pure ground!

Compassion possesses capacity to appear to sentient beings! But grasped by grasping-consciousness, ignorance fractures! Shift from one to the other! From that dark consciousness, "I" arises! Or "I" arises from that!

Thinking thus, consciousness arises only! Deluded! Ignorance—that basis possesses neither experience nor appearance! Appearance from conditions—four appearances arise!

Like a man shown his face in a mirror! Three times equal—immediate condition! From this basis, self by self-face not knowing, deluded! Three realms' samsara established!

From this, affliction coarse—sentient beings arise in different forms! Basis thus deluded! When consciousness arises to investigate basis-appearance, cause-identity one-by-means-of ignorance! Self-face not knowing! Condition four-by-means-of object not-pure!

Deluded! Manner that Fortune-Beauty from! Condition basis-by-means-of deluded!

Like a clear sky suddenly covered with clouds—was the sky ever truly obscured? Like pure water stirred to mud—was the water ever truly dirty?

The basis remains pure! The delusion is adventitious! Remove the cause and the effect vanishes!

Do not chase the delusion—find its root! Cut the root and the tree falls! The root is ignorance—the not-knowing of one's own face!

Emaho! The root of all confusion!
