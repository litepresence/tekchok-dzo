COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 273

You who want to understand the base! Longchenpa speaks from the Rangshar at lines [11335-11346]: That all essence primordially-pure actual-state called, India also not-cut direction where-also not-fall, that below spontaneous-presence jewel casket called exist and, that at arise-manner form six exist, gate form two exist, that base spontaneous-presence called, base not-certain called, base various arise called also, that below reverse ground exist, that below base appearance great called exist, that below enjoyment-body appearance exist thus spoke. You hear "base" and you think it is a thing, a foundation, something solid to stand on. Foolish! The base is the actual state—primordially pure, not falling in any direction, not cut by any boundary. India is just a name. Direction is just a concept. The base does not fall anywhere because it is everywhere.

The jewel casket of spontaneous presence—below it, forms arise in six manners, gates exist in two forms. Called spontaneous presence, called not-certain, called various arising. Below that, reverse ground exists. Below that, base appearance great is called. Below that, enjoyment body appearance exists. You think these are levels, stages, something to climb. They are not. They are descriptions of how the base appears—not certain, various, spontaneously present. Like the ocean that can be calm or wavy, yet remains ocean.

At lines [11347-11364], here that meaning elaborate explain if, beginning expanse youth vase body inside essence body-as abide, nature speech-as abide, compassion mind-as abide, that-also life-wind limb four possession wisdom wind five essence awareness abide resonance outside appear from, youth vase body limitless not-separate spontaneous-presence resonance from light five appearance flame each arise and together, compassion awareness resonance form investigate knowledge arise that also, self-face not-know just part from awareness depend ignorance called abide, that word base not-change although base appear arise change change similar become is, awareness appearance change called, that time primordially-pure appearance like sky cloud not-exist like state from, spontaneous-presence arise-manner eight self-appearance arise, jewel casket actual-state great appearance is, compassion like arise understanding not-cease sentient-being compassion arise, light like arise understanding not-cease wisdom five self-light rainbow like appearance pervade, wisdom like arise understanding not-cease not-think state abide, body like arise understanding not-cease peaceful-wrathful light-clear body sky pervade, two not-exist like arise understanding not-cease one and many not-investigate.

Inside the expanse, the youth vase body—essence abides as body, nature as speech, compassion as mind. Life-wind, four limbs, five wisdom winds—essence awareness abides, resonance appears outside. The youth vase body, limitless, not separate—from spontaneous presence resonance, five lights appear, flames arise together. Compassion-awareness resonance form investigates, knowledge arises. Self-face not-knowing—just part from awareness, ignorance is called and abides. The base does not change, yet base-appearances arise, change, become similar. Awareness-appearance is called change. At that time, from the primordially pure appearance like sky without clouds, spontaneous presence arises in eight manners, self-appearance arises. The jewel casket actual-state great appearance. Compassion arises like compassion—not ceasing understanding, sentient being compassion arises. Light arises like light—not ceasing understanding, five wisdoms' self-light rainbow-like pervades. Wisdom arises like wisdom—not ceasing understanding, not-thinking state abides. Body arises like body—not ceasing understanding, peaceful-wrathful light-clear body pervades the sky. Two not-existing arises like—not ceasing understanding, one and many not investigated.

So the base is not a thing. It is the actual state from which all arises—body, speech, mind, light, wisdom, form. Yet it does not change. Like the sky that remains sky whether clouds come or go. The eight manners of spontaneous presence arise from the cloudless sky of primordially pure appearance. Do you see? Do not investigate one and many. Do not grasp at the arising. Let it be as it is.
