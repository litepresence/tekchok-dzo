PAGE 79 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa speaks of the fruit of complete perfection [2903-2961], and you must understand: this fruit is not far away! The ground of All-Illumination [2905] is not a place you will reach after eons. It is the nature of your awareness right now, fully recognized.

The Dharma body for self-purpose [2905]—the empty, luminous nature of mind itself, knowing its own nature without obstruction. The two form bodies for others [2906-2908]—the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya, the compassionate display that spontaneously arises to benefit beings. These are not physical forms you will acquire; they are modes of your being when fully liberated.

Beholding all that is and the extent of all with the two wisdoms [2907]—the wisdom of knowing the nature of reality, and the wisdom of knowing its variety. You see emptiness and you see form. You see the ultimate nature and you see the conventional display. These are not contradictory! They are two aspects of the same knowing.

Working for the benefit of beings until samsara is emptied [2908]—this is the bodhisattva's endless vow. Not because samsara can never be emptied, but because compassion is inexhaustible. Even when all beings are free, the display continues, the play of awakening goes on.

From the Entrance: "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought, working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained" [2910-2913]. This is not poetry about some distant Buddha! This describes your own mind when fully recognized. You become a wish-fulfilling tree—whatever beings need, you provide. You become a wish-fulfilling jewel—whatever they wish for, you manifest.

The conventional and ultimate explained again [2918-2961]—the false conventional of imputed appearances [2924-2928], the true conventional of ten virtues and merit [2929-2935], the nominal ultimate established through reasoning [2936-2944], the truly mental ultimate beyond all [2945-2954]. These distinctions are crucial! Do not confuse them. Do not grasp at any of them. Use them as a ladder, then let the ladder go when you have climbed.
