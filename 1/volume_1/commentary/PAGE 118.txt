COMMENTARY ON PAGE 118 - Patrul Rinpoche

You who would understand the scriptures—listen! This page continues the detailed explanation of the Atiyoga tantras, showing the depth and vastness of the Great Perfection teachings.

The liturgical text here discusses the various categories and divisions of the teachings, gathering them into systematic presentations. But remember: all these divisions are for the purpose of teaching. The truth itself is undivided, seamless, whole.

When Longchenpa presents these elaborate classifications—the Mind Category, the Space Category, the Instruction Category; the outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassable cycles; the four lamps, the four visions—he is not creating complexity for its own sake. He is providing paths for beings of different capacities, different inclinations, different needs.

Some practitioners connect more with the Mind Category—understanding that all is mind. Some connect with the Space Category—understanding the vastness beyond expression. Some connect with the Instruction Category—needing direct pointing-out and specific techniques.

There is no hierarchy among these. What matters is recognition. If you recognize your nature through the Mind Category, that is perfect. If you recognize it through the Space Category, that is perfect. If you recognize it through the Instruction Category with all its detailed techniques, that is perfect.

The danger is attachment—to the method, to the system, to the philosophy. You study the teachings, you understand the classifications, you become expert in the terminology... and you forget to look at your own mind. This is like collecting medicine but never taking it. Like owning a map but never traveling.

Use these teachings. Let them inspire you. Let them guide you. But always return to the essence: your own awareness, right here, right now. Look at it. Recognize it. Rest in it. That is the point of all these words.

The scriptures say so much because the mind is so stubborn. You need to hear the truth again and again in different ways until it finally penetrates. But once recognized, all the words are seen as the display of that recognition. They do not contradict each other; they illuminate each other.
