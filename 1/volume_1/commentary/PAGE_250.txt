Dear practitioner, look sharply here! Lines [10209-10226] reveal the devastating consequences of broken samaya—more terrible than death itself!

If body's samaya breaks, you separate from the buddha body! The three realms of existence become your prison, and one moment cuts your life stream. Sin without end! Limitless suffering! This is not poetic exaggeration—this is the nature of cause and effect!

If speech's samaya degenerates, buddha speech no longer dwells within you. The tongue that once recited mantras becomes a weapon against yourself. Like a bell that rings cracked—no pure sound emerges!

If mind's samaya shatters, your meditation becomes poison. The virtue you cultivate turns to sin. Disturb the mind of a virtuous monk even once, and sin increases without measure! This is the heaviness of guru reliance—the greater the height, the harder the fall!

From the Glorious Sky of Exhaustion Tantra: even in dreams, if mindfulness degenerates, if bad thoughts arise—the seed of downfall is planted. The guru who gave you empowerment, who opened the door of mantra—if you betray this connection, you burn seven times more than the vajra sibling, one hundred times more than the lineage guru, one hundred times more than the root guru!

These are not mere numbers. They are measures of the bond between teacher and student. The deeper the transmission, the greater the breaking!

Guard your samayas like a mother guards her only child! For in them lies the distinction between liberation and endless wandering!

Emaho! The weight of broken vows!
