COMMENTARY ON PAGE 91 - Patrul Rinpoche

You who would realize the unborn—attend! Lines 3510-3522: Arising as wisdom beyond view-meditation of limitlessness. Realizing all dharmas as equal in pleasure and pain. Called the sphere and wisdom of dharma-nature beyond action. Those gradually enter sphere and wisdom—abiding, empty, understanding bliss as entering. Called the union without superior or inferior, without acceptance or rejection.

What is this sphere and wisdom? The sphere (dbyings) is the empty nature, the dharmadhatu. The wisdom is the knowing quality, the awareness. These two are not different, not separate. Like a mirror and its capacity to reflect—can you divide them?

Through instantaneous entering into sphere and wisdom, lines 3518-3522: Understanding the self-arising dharma-nature as free from view, dharmas exhausted—called the cause-free liberation. Through entering liberation, understanding all that is, and that which is not—not abandoning all. Called the liberation where nothing is obtained.

Cause-free liberation! What causes are we free from? The causes of samsara—afflictions, karma, habitual tendencies. But these were never truly existent! They were like clouds in the sky—the sky was never bound by the clouds. When clouds dissolve, do we say "the sky is now liberated"? The sky was always free!

So too with your mind. Your afflictions appear, but they have no true existence. When you recognize their nature, they are self-liberated. Not transformed into something else, not rejected or abandoned—self-liberated in their own place.

The view of non-dual equality, lines 3523-3528: That sphere and wisdom are non-different, thus the view of non-dual equality. Without coming or going in sphere and wisdom. The view of not becoming other than abiding. Without extent or falling to either side in sphere and wisdom. The view of abiding from primordial wisdom. Called the view without reference point, single word, single reliance, without base or separation.

Without reference point! This is crucial. Most views have a reference point—some position to hold, some place to stand. "All is empty"—there's a reference point. "All is mind"—another reference point. But the ultimate view has no reference point at all. It is like space—where is the center of space? Where is its boundary?

Lines 3529-3533: The meaning sphere is the basis. Liberation through effort of beings on the path of wisdom. Sphere is cause, wisdom is result. Through the pristine sense faculties, liberation from outer action, cause and result without reference—surpassing the lower.

This is difficult to realize, extensively explained. Yes, because the mind wants something to grasp. The intellect wants to understand. But this teaching transcends intellect. It is to be recognized, not understood.

Ninth: The instruction of great perfection, line 3534: In self-arising wisdom, samsara and nirvana are not established. Wishing beyond wisdom, liberation, acceptance, rejection. This is not established anywhere. All-liberating wisdom does not cease.

Ah! Here we approach Atiyoga, the Great Perfection. In self-arising wisdom—this is your own awareness, naturally clear, naturally knowing—samsara and nirvana are not established. They have no true existence. They are merely labels, conceptual constructs.

Do not think "I must achieve nirvana" or "I must abandon samsara." These very thoughts are the problem! Rest in self-arising wisdom, and both samsara and nirvana are seen as the play of that wisdom. Neither accepted nor rejected—they simply are, as they are.
