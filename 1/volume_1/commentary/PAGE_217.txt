You purify and produce! But production is manifestation. Like a tree bearing fruit—natural result.

Third very unelaborate at lines 8895-8903—self face difference, elaborate border separate, mandala offer request, sky mandala enter, knowing self introduce. You separate enter introduce! But introduction is crucial. Like meeting someone important—remember the moment.

Fourth utterly unelaborate at lines 8904-8914—self face difference, elaborate posture show, gaze do, four directions gaze stance rely, go perfect. You show and do! But showing demonstrates. Like a dancer performing—exhibits skill.
