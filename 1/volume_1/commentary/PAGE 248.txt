[10042-10084] Secret's outer—disparage vajra siblings. Inner—guru's mudra. Secret—guru himself. Cut speech with siblings? Aeon after aeon in suffering. Trace of bad speech—even in dream, confess immediately.

The twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, mind—these are your lifeline. Cut them and you've cut yourself. Guru isn't a person outside. Guru is your recognition appearing in form. Harm that recognition and you've cut your own lifeline.

Sem chases thoughts. Rigpa sees the sky they cross. Don't confuse them.

The ground isn't the path. The path isn't the result. Three distinct—don't mash them together like tsampa.
