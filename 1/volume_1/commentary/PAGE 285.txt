COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 285

You who seek liberation somewhere else! Longchenpa speaks at lines [11854-11861] of base-appearance part light clarity-to manifest-therefore, spontaneous-presence appearance-from kaya like manifest-do bundle-is, primordial-awareness and light like manifest-do four gather-do, spontaneous-presence precious appearance-to pure primordial-awareness and, impure cyclic-existence door two are. Self face know-if compassion and, nondual and, extreme liberation like manifest-therefore, potency base-to dissolve-therefore liberate-do. You think liberation is a place you will reach, a state you will achieve. Foolish! The base-appearance manifests as light clarity. From spontaneous presence appearance, the kayas manifest like a bundle. Primordial awareness and light manifest, four gatherings gather. Spontaneous presence's precious appearance—to pure primordial awareness. Impure cyclic existence door—two. If you know your own face, compassion and nonduality, extreme liberation manifests. Potency dissolves into base, liberates.

At lines [11862-11873], thus base-to base-appearance exist-therefore practice time and, bardo and, first sentient-beings-as delude time which is-any emergence-mode eight appearance arise-do point that is. Buddhas and sentient-beings-also appearance self face know not-know only-are. Cyclic-existence transcendence awareness cause one hand palm back like. Now appearance this-also impure door-to appearance illusion example eight only-from. Outer inner object not-exist base free equal vast open one-from, abandon not-need, accept not-need appearance other manifest time trace not-exist self-reverse great, sleep wake-from dream reverse like. Base liberation-to self-reverse-therefore primordial-empty one-to go-therefore point one well realize-from effort not boundless liberation-to go-do is. Base and base-appearance exist—therefore practice time, bardo, first sentient beings deluded time—whatever emergence-mode, eight appearances arise. This is the point. Buddhas and sentient beings—appearance, self-face know or not-know, only these. Cyclic existence and transcendence—awareness cause one, like the back of your hand. Now this appearance also—impure door appearance, illusion example, eight only. Outer inner object not exist—base free, equal, vast, open, one. Abandon not needed. Accept not needed. Appearance, other manifest time, trace not exist—self-reverse great. Like waking from sleep, dream reverses. Base liberation self-reverses—primordial-empty one goes. Point one well realized—from effort not, boundless liberation goes.

At lines [11874-11882], third first base-to dissolve-mode show-do is. Thus base-from manifest-do appearance great those self face know-or not-know although suitable-therefore, crystal light inside-to dissolve-or, dream later manifest time earlier cease like interval-by go-therefore, appearance any not-exist-as go-do is, primordial-resonance inside-to reverse-from, other-to go-do not-exist that, dream two state-in dissolve-from other-to not-go like, especially wake time dream manifest-do know inside-to dissolve-from other where-also not-go like. Third, first base-to dissolve-mode shows. Thus from base manifest appearance great—self-face know or not-know, although suitable. Crystal light dissolves inside—or dream, later manifest time, earlier ceases, like interval goes. Appearance any not exist as goes. Primordial resonance inside reverses from. Other-to go does not exist. Dream, in two states, dissolves from—not going to other. Especially wake time, dream manifest-do know, inside dissolves from—other where-also not-go like.

At lines [11883-11895], dissolve manner how think-if. Precious heap tantra-from: Alas speech vajra listen. That all fault quality emergence-mode. Awareness itself quality or. Play potency-as dissolve-mode eight. Spontaneous-presence certainty not-exist base. Quality manner this like. Compassion sun compassion-to. Self essence self dissolve-therefore. Not-place obtain-do mode-by-means-of. Action not-exist expanse-to go. Not-action any not-is-therefore. How to think of dissolve manner? From the Precious Heap Tantra: Alas, speech vajra, listen! That all fault quality emergence-mode. Awareness itself quality. Or play potency-as dissolve-mode eight. Spontaneous presence certainty not exist base. Quality manner like this. Compassion sun to compassion. Self essence self dissolves. Not-place obtain-do mode. Action not exist—expanse goes. Not-action any not is—therefore.

So liberation is not going somewhere else. It is the self-dissolving of the base-appearance into the base itself. Like a dream that ceases when you wake—not going anywhere, just ceasing to appear as separate. The crystal light dissolves into itself. The sun's rays dissolve into the sun. You do not need to go to the expanse. You are the expanse. Action does not exist. Not-action also does not exist. Just this. Just this.
