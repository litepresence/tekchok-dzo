Here's where it gets genuinely overwhelming if you try to count it. Eighty-five thousand affliction-latencies. That's the seed-stock of your confusion. Each one caused by eighty-five thousand fire-insects burning through your system. Each insect has its own syllable, its own body, its own wisdom-being residing in your heart-center.

You're not a single person. You're a civilization of eighty-five thousand micro-minds, each one carrying a syllable of the cosmic alphabet, each one housing a miniature Buddha. The total inventory: three hundred three thousand three affliction-thought basis-points. Three hundred three thousand dharmas in the taste wheel alone. One hundred sixty-six abodes.

This is why they call it the basis-of-all. Not because it's empty of content—but because it's full beyond measure. You carry more complexity than any computer, more phenomena than any galaxy. The collection has no measure. The inventory cannot be completed.

By day fifty-seven, water gathers everything into one. Earth presses down and steadies. Fire burns through nine channels. Wind scatters everything into individual strands. Two months of this elemental work and the pacifying action exhausts its power. Then the gathering begins again. The elements never stop. The construction never rests.

At two months and three days, the Peak-Arranged Wheel activates. Eight main channels multiply into forty-five own-face channels, then multiply again into hundreds. Thirty-eight channel-petals, sixty full centers, spreading through the body's outside and inside entirely. Distinction channels arise alongside common channels. The system becomes impossibly intricate. Branching, coiling, straightening, thickening, thinning. Every variation present. Blood flowing. Lymph draining. Breath cycling. Everything riding everything else.

Seventy-two types of wind-action: throwing, changing, shifting, leaping, increasing. Each one producing disease possibilities. Each one generating new causes for suffering. The system is designed to break down. The construction is engineered for dissolution.

And yet within all of this—in the very fibers of your confusion—affliction self-possessing action arises. Change. Steal. Grasp. The three poisons running through every channel. The basis-of-all also the basis of all your problems.

But here's the punchline you keep missing: the basis is not divided. The insects are not separate from the wisdom-beings. The fire is not other than the water that gathers it. You think you have to clean up eighty-five thousand latencies? You don't. You need to recognize that the latencies were never real. Only the wisdom was ever true.

Rest now. Nothing to fix. No one to fix it.
