Now listen carefully, you who hunger for liberation! The whole problem, the entire mess you're in right now, boils down to one thing—you're chasing your own tail and calling it enlightenment.

Here's how it works: ignorance isn't something foreign that invaded you from outside. No, you got hooked by your own display! The moment awareness turns back on itself, caught in its own reflection—that's when the knot tightens. That's ignorance's root. And it wraps around the three realms like a coil of rope.

But here's the stunning part—don't miss this—the very thing binding you is also what frees you. No need to import some external wisdom. Cut the root where it grows, and the whole tangled mess collapses.

Longchenpa lays out three ways to slice through this:

**First**: Cut error at its root. Stop trying to purify saṃsāra from nirvāṇa—that whole view is the disease. See that awareness itself, when left alone, self-liberates. Primordial purity isn't achieved later—it's what's already happening, though you don't recognize it. You're like someone searching for their spectacles while wearing them.

**Second**: Leave error to itself. Don't wrestle with it, don't battle your thoughts. Just recognize the dharmatā—that which is never not already pure. Ignorance's continuum is naturally empty. Actions and afflictions have no ground to stand on. The cord of your karma gets severed without you having to do anything special. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa? One taste. One ground. Stop pretending they're enemies.

**Third**: Emrace the basis itself. This is for those who still think liberation is something to achieve. The basis of falling beings is empty—not in the sense of "nothing there," but in the sense of nothing to fix. Self-nature beyond all calculation. Even the distinction between error and non-error dissolves. You're not becoming pure—you're recognizing that purity was never absent.

And here's the bindu point: all three paths point to the same essential fact. Stop adding onto what's already complete. You're not a project. You're not broken. You're just asleep to what's always been awake.

Wake up!
