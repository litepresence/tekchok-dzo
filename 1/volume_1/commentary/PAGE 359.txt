[14606-14617] Channel form, water-yellow essence, blood essence, wind earth elements. Essence located, wind radiate. Form located. The formless radiates without location.

[14618-14642] Dharma wheel leaf, five above go, five left go, five space center, secret continuity. Day twenty thousand, moment ten-thousand four-thousand. Count until tired. The uncounted is already present.

[14643-14656] Coiled latency, inside clear, string stretched, bodhicitta channel. Consciousness essence, color light, drop body. All these channels—strings tying nothing to nothing.

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
