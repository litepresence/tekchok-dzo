Now Longchenpa distinguishes different types of upadesha and explains key terms. Listen sharply, you who confuse levels of teaching! (lines 1-63)

Listening, exercising the wisdom of the state (line 1). This listening is not ordinary hearing. It is listening with the wisdom that is your own nature. When you hear these words, is there not an immediate knowing? That is the wisdom of the state.

Upadesha elaboration, word-upadesha cast into words—meaning does not reach immediately (line 3). This is important! Many teachings are just words about wisdom. They circle around the truth but do not touch it directly. Do not mistake the finger pointing for the moon, you!

Essence-gathered meaning-upadesha, without depending on words—buddhahood (line 5). Here it is! The essence-gathered meaning that does not depend on words. This is the direct introduction, the pointing out instruction. When your teacher points and you recognize, no words are needed. Buddha is not somewhere else. Buddha is this very recognition.

Upadesha expression depending: inexpressible awareness-meaning arises in tantra (lines 7-9). Even the inexpressible is expressed—what a miracle! Like trying to describe the taste of water to one who has never drunk. Yet somehow, through skillful means, the tantra expresses what cannot be expressed.

Explanation words: depending on elaboration of words—demonstrates wisdom free of elaboration (lines 11-13). This is the great joke of the dharma! We use elaboration to show what is free of elaboration. We use concepts to point beyond concepts. It is like using a thorn to remove a thorn, then throwing both away.

Intention: dharmatā transcending intervals, without gap (lines 15-17). That self-abiding, not arising from other (line 19). Dharmatā—the nature of phenomena—has no gaps, no intervals, no separation. It is self-abiding, not created by anything else. Your awareness is like this. It does not arise from somewhere else. It has always been present.

Scripture: unchanging, stable—confidence arises (lines 21-23). When you recognize the unchanging nature, confidence naturally arises. Not confidence in something, but confidence as your own nature.

Awareness: depending on that meaning—liberates to the Buddha level (lines 25-27). Liberates! Not gradually, not eventually. Liberates now, in this very moment of recognition.

Clarity: knowledge clear—abides nowhere (lines 29-31). This is the clarity that has no location, the knowing that is not fixed anywhere. Faculty clear—distinguishes dharma and non-dharma (line 33). Five faculties placed in themselves—the six aggregates merely tremble (line 35). When the faculties rest in their own nature, the aggregates lose their power over you. They tremble like leaves in wind, but you are unmoved.

Holding those—transcend the three realms (line 37). The three realms are transcended not by going somewhere else, but by holding the faculties in their natural state.

Entering emptiness, entering appearances—appearance-mind mouth-joined (line 39). Entering appearance-emptiness—object and mind non-dual (line 41). Self-liberated—uncontrived (line 43). This is the path! Entering emptiness, entering appearances—both are the same entry. Appearance and mind are not two. Object and mind are not two. Self-liberated without contrivance.

Expert—expert in time and crucial points: merely thinking accomplishes destruction (lines 45-47). Expert in action and completion: merely examining mind accomplishes without need for mantra and samādhi—steals life-force (lines 49-49). Expert in time mantra and samādhi: deity approaches, siddhis arise (line 51). Expert in time approach-accomplish action-application: accomplishes self-wished benefits (line 53). Expert in substance and offering: increases prosperity, accomplishes actions (line 55).

These are the skills of the practitioner who knows the crucial points. Not skills learned from books, but from direct recognition of mind's nature.

Thus established, from those: for those liking mental elaboration—all shown (lines 57-59). For middling ones, those gathered into eight sections—accomplished by eight tantras (lines 61-61). For excellent ones, those transformed—tantra's meaning condensed (lines 63-63).

Three types of beings, three approaches. But in the end, all reach the same place. Do not be proud if you are "excellent," nor discouraged if you need elaboration. The destination is the same.
