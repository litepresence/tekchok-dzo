[3384]

You who would enter Atiyoga—the Great Perfection—listen with your whole being! Lines 3597-3604: Ati's great array—from those-with-mind, mind's category; those-with-sky, space's category; those-without-striving, instruction. Mind-category, space-category, instruction-category—three.

The Great Perfection is divided into three categories: Mind (sems sde), Space (klong sde), and Instruction (man ngag sde). Each is a different approach to the same recognition, like three doors into the same house.

Lines 3605-3616: Self-mind not dharma elsewhere without various mind's category. These self-arising mind-primordial-wisdom-from other-than changed stopping intention-only. Dharma-nature all-good-one's space-from other-destination without speech space's category. These expressible dharma-nature's space-from other-arising stopping need-only. Essential-nature point-directly setting instruction's category. These essential not elsewhere widely meaning-from strayed stopping intention all summit's reached.

The Mind Category teaches that your own mind is the dharma—there is no dharma elsewhere. The Space Category teaches that dharmata is like space—no other destination, nothing to express. The Instruction Category points directly to the essential nature—no need to stray elsewhere.

What is this mind that is taught in the Mind Category? Lines 3618-3628: Mind exist—what? Mind-only meaning exist and non-existence stopping. Meaning thus mind-only-in not-established. Mind-on meaning-only-in also not-established. Various minds exist yet not-looked-upon. Mind-on cause and characteristic-in not-established various minds not called even called not-established.

External meaning's non-existence called even conventional intellectually examined not-established. That various exist nothing obstructs. Mind exist various also not-established. Great-perfection acceptance-rejection beyond called.

Do you hear this? Mind exists—but what is it? You cannot find it! You look for mind and find nothing. Yet nothing obstructs the appearance of various phenomena. This is the mystery: mind cannot be established, yet it displays all phenomena. Phenomena cannot be established, yet they appear. This is beyond acceptance and rejection, beyond existence and non-existence.

That appearance various-in appear yet mind-one's wheel-from not-departed various-in understood (lines 3629-3630). Mind-itself various-in understood called. Appearances appear as various, yet they never depart from the wheel of the one mind. The mind itself is understood in the various appearances.

Like waves on the ocean—the waves appear various, but they never depart from the ocean. The ocean is understood through the waves. The one mind is understood through the various appearances.

Second, mind's aspect exist speaking mind's category, lines 3631-3636: That also essence appearance-direction is. Mind-direction appearance is. Whatever appears mind is. Mind-itself self-arising primordial-wisdom-in arisen mind's aspect's play cessation without self-arising called.

Whatever appears is mind. This is not idealism, not a philosophical position. It is a direct recognition. Look at what appears right now—this form, this sound, this thought. Is it not known by mind? Can you separate the appearance from the awareness of it? They are non-dual.

The mind itself, self-arising in primordial wisdom, the play of mind's aspects without cessation—this is called self-arising. It arises spontaneously, without cause, without conditions. Not created by anyone, not produced by anything. Simply—appearances appear. Knowingly, clearly, luminously.
