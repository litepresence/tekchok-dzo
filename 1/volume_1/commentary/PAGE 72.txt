PAGE 72 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa continues with the hearers' path in detail [2567-2618], and you must see this as a living tradition, not ancient history! These methods still work. These insights still liberate.

The realization of emptiness and selflessness [2567]—"cultivate, definite liberation, cessation, peace, excellence"—this is the core. By seeing and cultivating the three realms, abandoning the four hundred fourteen afflictions to be abandoned, the wisdom of knowing exhaustion and non-arising manifests. This is the foe-destroyer, the arhat who has conquered the enemies of affliction.

The path of cultivation [2597]: five paths arising in sequence, earnest doing. First, the general antidote of selflessness and illusion—seeing all as like a dream, a mirage, a reflection. This undermines the solidity of the world. Then individual antidotes: impure substances and skeletons for desire; love and dependent arising for anger; breath counting for delusion. These are targeted missiles, precise strikes against specific enemies.

And selflessness meditation [2597]: when object and object-possessor cease, when non-observing object is cultivated, dullness and torpor are abandoned. This is the subtle work! Not just meditating on a topic, but allowing the meditation itself to dissolve, the meditator to disappear, the duality of subject and object to collapse.

The faculties—dull, medium, and sharp [2607]—determine how quickly one obtains result. Some need many lifetimes of accumulation. Some achieve in one lifetime. This is not unfair; it is simply the result of previous cultivation. The path is open to all, but each walks at their own pace.

The hearers and self-enlightened ones attain the eight grounds [2618]: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, foe-destroyer; each with entered and abiding aspects. These are not titles to boast about! They are stages of irreversible progress toward liberation. Once you enter the stream, you will inevitably reach the ocean of awakening, even if it takes eons.

But remember their limitation [2611]: their path intellect is small, medium, or great, but they do not desire the Mahayana and mantra paths. They are satisfied with their own liberation, content to enter cessation without returning for others. Noble? Yes. Complete? No. The bodhisattva goes further, staying in samsara until all beings are free.
