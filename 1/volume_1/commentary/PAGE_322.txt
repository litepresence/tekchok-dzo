Spontaneously present, naturally perfect. Not made, not constructed, just naturally abiding. The three kayas are already complete in this body—this is why the path of wisdom arises from the body's basis.

Then the second seven, the action of arising as before. Within eleven days, in the eight water channels of the first wheel, syllables and lights arise. Father-mother in union, expanding from the channels. The channels moved by winds, generating and dispersing.

Eight channels, eight types of arising. Eight bases of consciousness. Within these, eight consciousnesses appear as self-arisen syllables.

These consciousnesses arise depending on objects of experience, using the six realms as their domain.

From the four channels, the wind of method manifests as the syllable KHASPUNG—self-ripening. From this, many syllables emanate. The earth channels' wheels rising, between them the KHASPUNG wind, subtle as a grain of rice, not touching, grasping. Like stars covering, light's radiance, syllables blazing.

Below, the lotus padma expanding.

Then fourteen days, the four supports of alaya becoming like flickering flames. The water element's germ producing the basis: subtle, changing knowing, expanding, karmic winds becoming the four bodies.

Within these, the supports from before appearing like reflections. One body, life uninterrupted—this is the body of transformation.

This is called the transformation body. Father-mother buddhas, two-non-abiding—hence "body-less," not form but not formless.

Here's what this means: the wisdom was always present. The construction—syllables, channels, winds, consciousnesses—was just arranging what was already complete.

You're not building wisdom. You're recognizing what's always been here. The syllables come and go. The channels appear and dissolve. The body of transformation continues its work.

But awareness—that which knows all this—that was never constructed, never arranged, never made. It's naturally perfect, spontaneously present.

Stop trying to create what is already here. Stop arranging what is already complete. Rest in what's naturally present.

That's the practice. Not adding. Not fixing. Just recognizing what's always been.
