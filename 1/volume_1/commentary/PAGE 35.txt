Below that to sky called wish fulfilling tree see beautiful—fall from above is emanation joy. That sound by doing play joy, emanating hundred or thousand or immeasurable sons from body light. The descent continues. Now we are in the realm of emanation joy, where the gods take pleasure in manifesting forms, in creating.

Body league one and four part, five hundred and one hundred twenty-five bow lengths. Life eight hundred human years, calculate one day as own year thousand eight lasts. Time moves differently here. One day for these gods is eight hundred human years. Their lifespan, by their own reckoning, is a thousand eight hundred years. But by human reckoning, it is vastly longer. This is the nature of the god realms—time is relative, existence is prolonged, but it is still existence. It still ends.

Below that to sky called wish fulfilling tree eye beautiful—joy possess expanded from emanation joy, cause dwelling in supreme joy bliss dharma. Each level more refined, more capable of joy, but also more attached to that joy. The supreme joy bliss dharma—they think this is the ultimate. They dwell in it. They possess it. But possession implies separation. Where there is possessor and possessed, there is duality. Where there is duality, there is not liberation.

Body league one, five hundred bow lengths. Life four hundred human years, calculate one day as own year four thousand lasts. The progression continues. Bodies get smaller. Lives get shorter. But they are still immense compared to humans.

Below that to sky called wish fulfilling tree mind change—Thab-bral called, Asuras and conflict free. We have reached the realm of the Thirty-three, where Indra dwells, where the conflict with asuras is suspended. Thab-bral means "free from conflict," "without battle." This is the highest of the ordinary desire god realms, the most pleasant, the most refined.

But notice—even here, conflict is mentioned. Even in the realm free from conflict, conflict is remembered. The asuras are not absent; they are simply not fighting at the moment. The peace is conditional. It depends on the balance of power, the exhaustion of karma, the temporary alignment of conditions. It is not true peace. It is not the peace that passes all understanding.

Body leagues four-three: bow-lengths three-hundred seventy-five. Life human-years two-hundred, day one calculated, own-years two-thousand enduring. Still vast. Still desirable by ordinary standards. But you, practitioner, know better. You know that all this is temporary. You know that the gods, when their merit exhausts, fall. You know that the realm free from conflict is still within conflict's domain, still subject to the laws of karma, still part of the world-system.

Your goal is not to be reborn among these gods. Your goal is to transcend the entire system. To recognize that all these realms—hell, preta, animal, human, asura, god, form, formless—are equal in their emptiness. To see that the nature of mind is not higher or lower, not better or worse, not god or demon. It simply is. And in that is-ness, there is freedom.
