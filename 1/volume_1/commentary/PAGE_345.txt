[14107-14113] Listen, dear practitioner! Insertion place, making close. Conventionally, at the twenty-first vertebra of mind-ripened-born men. At women's thirteenth, at the lotus stigma's tip. Its branches gather at the breast peak. Those sixteen branches at the navel gathering. At men's rib interval. These perform body's formation, abiding, destruction—taking close.

[14114-14119] Rkyang ma produces speech. Without curve and straight—voice pleasant, code clear. If minor branches thin—voice shrill and short, or code unclear like stammer comes. Naturally, without branches and curve.

[14120-14128] From those ten channels gone, voice comes rough. If that channel has upper-lower thick-thin gaps—voice comes with many tips and interrupted. If that channel has pressure—voice comes suppressed and trembling. If channel completely exists—voice comes very clear, chewing others. Yogis change by channel oral instruction.

Do you see? Your voice comes from channels! Straight channels, pleasant voice. Crooked channels, stammering. But who speaks? Find that one!

Emaho! The speaker has no voice!
