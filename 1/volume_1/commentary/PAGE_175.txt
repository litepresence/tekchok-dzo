The hundred eight qualities continue! Remembering former lifetimes, seeing beings take birth, knowing others' minds, associating with non-humans. All obtained through empowerment.

But the defects of not receiving empowerment! Master not pleased, empowerments not obtained, result lost. Like a deaf and handless person trying to cross a river—impossible!

In bardo: fainting, fear, suffocation, obstacles, lost perception. Not seeing worthy beings, small merit, short life, few enjoyments, many obstacles. Actions not accomplished.

Even Buddha cannot turn the dharma wheel without empowerment! Cannot benefit beings through emanation kaya. Therefore—obtain empowerment!

Where? Secluded, pleasant, near siddhi. Auspicious earth, good forest. Four particular abodes for elaboration: body-earth with south expanse north protection; water-east with west protection; fire-west with east protection; wind-north with south protection.

Elaborationless: dense forest, ravine, mountain—following element signs. Very elaborationless: three valleys gathered at mountain peak. Or very secluded hermitage, one league above town.

For all four empowerments: where beings are afraid, where carnivorous wild animals reside, where poisonous snakes are, where cemeteries and charnel grounds exist—this is excellent, auspicious!
