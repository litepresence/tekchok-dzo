[635-682] The description of the pure lands continues with rich imagery from the south-eastern and south-western directions. The sound of Thal-ba resounding, surrounded by victory banners and parasols, flowers and fragrances descending—this is describing the celebratory atmosphere of the Sambhogakaya. In this dimension, everything naturally honors and celebrates the teaching. There's no struggle, no effort required. The environment itself supports recognition.

The "wind of Thal-ba" moving and stirring in intermediate space, giving rise to all sounds—this is describing how the teaching propagates. Not through force or coercion, but naturally, like wind moving through space. The teaching is "moved by wind, the three gateways of the five-possessing one"—the five sense doors functioning as gateways to recognition.

The thirteen stacked at the summit, called Jewel Thal-ba, adorned with solar rays and the qualities of desire—this is describing how even desire is transformed in the pure lands. In ordinary experience, desire leads to grasping and suffering. In the pure lands, desire is liberated into the natural richness of the display. The "lotus eyes of lda-ldi"—pure perception that sees everything as beautiful, as the play of awareness.

[683-695] "Thus from immeasurable fields, this Saha's sequence is explained." Our world, Saha (the world of endurance), is explained as arising from the same source as all the pure lands. The external elements arise from wind, connected with space's khams, that water, that upper earth. This is the traditional Buddhist cosmology—worlds arising from the interaction of elements.

But here's the key: this cosmology is describing not just physical reality but the structure of perception. "Continents arrangement and Meru and wishing-tree and jewel with, sun moon individual gods..." These are descriptions of how the mandala of experience is organized. Meru (the cosmic mountain) is the central channel, the sun and moon are the right and left channels, the continents are the different aspects of perception. The external world and the internal body are mirrors of each other.
