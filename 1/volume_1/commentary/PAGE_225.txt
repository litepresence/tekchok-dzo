PAGE 225 COMMENTARY

You who count further! Lines 1-21 describe elaborated's unelaborated external—three making nine, internal four making thirteen, secret four making seventeen, complete four making twenty-one. You count to twenty-one! But numbers multiply. Like branches on a tree—many, but one trunk.

Utterly unelaborated external at lines 23-27—six for hearers, five for pratyekabuddhas eleven, four for bodhisattvas fifteen. You receive according to capacity! But capacity can grow. Like a container—can be enlarged.

Its internal at lines 28-33—nine for kriya twenty-four, nine for upa thirty-three, nine for yoga forty-two. You progress through vehicles! But vehicles are methods. Like different cars—any can reach destination.

Its secret at lines 34-36—twelve for maha fifty-four, six for anu sixty complete. You approach completion! But complete means nothing lacking. Like a full moon—whole, perfect.

Its complete at lines 37-40—four for ati sixty-four, elaborated's thoroughly unelaborated external seventeen, internal six twenty-three, secret six twenty-nine, complete one thirty. You reach sixty-four! But sixty-four is eight squared. Like a mandala—ordered pattern.
