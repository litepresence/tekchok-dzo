[16025-16026] Karma-wind pure, wisdom-wind part—from this arises the far-reaching snare! Do you see? The lasso that catches the distant is right here in your own channels!

Karma-wind, wisdom-wind—two names, one movement! From their meeting comes the lamp that sees beyond distance. This is not philosophy, practitioner—this is your body, your breath, right now! The far and near are one when you recognize!

Emaho! The distance-snare is your own face!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
