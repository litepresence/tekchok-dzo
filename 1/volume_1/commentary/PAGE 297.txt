COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 297

You who fear the wheel of existence! Longchenpa speaks at lines [12331-12338] of dependent origination—object from utilize is touch, that from joy sorrow middle three arise is feeling, that from bliss to attached and suffering not-desiring knowing is craving, that from object accept grasping is grasping, that from karma and afflictions spread future birth in propel karma accomplish is becoming, that from realms various in birth is birth, that from mature and aged and die is aging-dying. That also beginning from ego up-to wheel twelve delusion. You know this wheel. You have been told about the twelve links since you first came to the Dharma. Touch, feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, aging and death. You think this is something that happens to you, something you must escape. But look—Longchenpa says this is delusion, from beginning ego up to the wheel twelve.

At lines [12339-12347], life one even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first self face not-know is ignorance. Outer breath cut time die by. That interval dependent-origination manner enters. Then coarse subtle dissolving manner channels transfer stages dependent-origination reverse. Deluded-appearance empty from samsara turn when. Nirvana self-arisen manner first primordially-pure appearance arise from. Dharmata bardo appearances are nirvana dependent-origination manifest appearance. There self face not-know if also wander. Know if liberate samsara nirvana-samsara liberate called. Life one—even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first, self-face not-know is ignorance. Outer breath cut—time die by. That interval, dependent origination manner enters. Then coarse subtle dissolving, channels transfer stages—dependent origination reverses. Deluded-appearance empty from, samsara turns. When? Nirvana self-arisen manner—first primordially pure appearance arises. Dharmata bardo appearances are nirvana dependent-origination manifest appearance. There, self-face not-know—if also wander. Know—if liberate. Samsara nirvana-samsara liberate called.

At lines [12348-12358], that-also base and base-appearance, both to ignorance none although, cloud like adventitiously arise condition made, impure samsara like appear doorway cause made, realms three kinds six variously deluded. Pearl garland from: Thus abiding dharmata to, delusion from-start none is, dharmakaya sky like to, adventitiously beings clouds obscured, says and. That also base and base-appearance—both to ignorance none, although. Cloud-like, adventitiously arise, condition made. Impure samsara-like appear, doorway cause made. Realms three, kinds six, variously deluded. From the Pearl Garland: Thus abiding dharmata to, delusion from start none is. Dharmakaya sky-like to, adventitiously beings clouds obscured. Says and.

At lines [12359-12371], base-appearance great that itself from, ignorance called labeled none, delusion accomplished exist not, says. Adventitiously force labeled impure samsara dharma arise is. That itself from, thus world three itself, aggregates five and faculties five, limbs five and essences five, objects five and afflictions five, minds five mentals five thoughts five, grasped-grasper samsara accomplished, says and. Base-appearance great—that itself from, ignorance called, labeled none. Delusion accomplished—exist not. Says. Adventitiously force labeled, impure samsara dharma arises. That itself from—thus world three itself. Aggregates five, faculties five, limbs five, essences five, objects five, afflictions five, minds five, mentals five, thoughts five. Grasped-grasper samsara accomplished. Says and.

So you see? The wheel of dependent origination is not ultimate truth. It is the deluded appearance. When you die, when the breath is cut, you enter the interval—the bardo. There, dependent origination can reverse. The coarse and subtle dissolve. The channels transfer. And from deluded-appearance empty, samsara turns. How? Nirvana self-arisen—primordially pure appearance arises first. The dharmata bardo appearances are nirvana's dependent origination manifest. If you do not know your own face there, you wander. If you know, you liberate. It is called liberation from samsara-nirvana-samsara.

But understand—the base and base-appearance, both have no ignorance. They are cloud-like, adventitious, condition-made. The impure samsara appears like a doorway, cause-made. But delusion from the start? None. The dharmakaya is like the sky. Beings, like clouds, obscure it adventitiously. The base-appearance itself—ignorance is just a label. Delusion is not accomplished. It does not exist. All these—worlds, aggregates, faculties, limbs, essences, objects, afflictions, minds, mentals, thoughts—grasped and grasper, they accomplish samsara. But they are like clouds. The sky remains pure.

So do not fear the twelve links. Do not fear death. In the bardo, the dharmata appears. Know your own face, and you are liberated. Do not know, and you wander. But even wandering is not other than the display of your own base. The clouds are not other than the sky. The waves are not other than the ocean. Rest in that recognition, and the wheel turns itself to liberation.
