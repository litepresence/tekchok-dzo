[15183-15194] From that: bliss wheel's channels—these are outer limbs! Wheel stages possessed, outside stages right side: white conch spiral color similar, crown Brahma's aperture, lotus-like great channel, ba-men horn-like channel! From these two, branches six-fold divided!

[15195-15207] From that cakra's left side, transforming aspect: lotus-like right-left, two channels exist! From these spreading: ear's upper four finger-widths, right-left two each four! Cakra's outer rim front, wish-fulfilling tree shape, root trunk with branches, skull-crown near, buffalo-tongue similar one, from that forty channels! Below wheel's rim...

Do you see? Your skull holds forty channels like a wish-fulfilling tree! Every thought branches from this crown! Cut the root—find no root! Emaho!
