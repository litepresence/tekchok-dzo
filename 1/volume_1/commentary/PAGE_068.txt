Longchenpa concludes the explanation of outsiders' philosophical positions [2428], and now turns to the transcendent vehicles [2430-2474]. This is the turning point! Everything before was what to avoid. Now we enter what to practice.

"Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates" [2428]. This is the Buddha's compassion! He did not teach the wrong views to confuse you, but to protect you. Like a parent who points out all the dangerous animals so the child knows what to avoid, Longchenpa has shown you the philosophical pitfalls.

The transcendent vehicle is superior because of the four seals [2434]: all compounded things impermanent, all defiled things suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation peaceful. And because of refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha who showed the way, the Dharma that is the way, the Sangha that walks the way. These the outsiders lack! They have their gods, their scriptures, their communities, but not the Three Jewels that lead beyond all conditioning.

The essence of the transcendent vehicle: "supreme method of definitely exiting samsara" [2446]. Not merely improving samsara, not merely making it more comfortable, but exiting entirely! This is the difference between worldly and transcendent spirituality. One wants better circumstances; the other recognizes circumstances themselves are the problem.

From the Compendium: "mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—joy, happiness, bliss, accomplishing supreme virtue. This vehicle like space, a measureless great palace" [2446]. Space holds everything without preference. The Great Vehicle includes everything without discrimination. It is vast enough for all beings, all paths, all methods.

The nine vehicles [2475-2502] are taught according to faculties—listener, self-enlightened, bodhisattva for the inferior; Kriya, Upa, Yoga for the medium; Maha, Anu, Ati for the sharp. But do not think this means you must start at the bottom and climb! It means teachings are available for every level of capacity. Find where you are, practice accordingly, and progress naturally.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo [2496-2522]: "The Dharmas I taught from beings' mind stages, by differences of great and small, taught as two-stage method." The teachings emerge from the needs of beings, not from the Buddha's preference. They are skillful means, appropriate to the recipient. What matters is not which vehicle you follow, but whether you follow it to its completion.
