[14807-14813] By this, benefit comes to that illness. Yogis accomplish by pressing. These are the key syllables summarized. The rest have no benefit or harm. Pressing, shaking, and drawing—the yogi should know these.

Listen! The throat chakra—the wheel of enjoyment. Here speech becomes mantra, voice becomes vajra song. Press the channels, shake the elements, draw the winds—this is the yogi's play.

[14814-14827] Third, the throat enjoyment wheel—from four: first, generally showing the numbers. Sixteen channel leaves. From these, inner and outer divide into countless minor leaves. Three hundred forty major inner channels dwell in the coils of seven wheels. From the wheel location: At the throat enjoyment wheel dwell three hundred forty major channels. Having seven wheels in sequence: the first wheel's leaves are ten. The rest are all like that. All have twenty at the end. These are the channel types.

[14828-14838] Karma and affliction latencies, wisdom movement channels, gathering channels—these are the paths. Sixteen wisdom movements, awareness bodies likewise that many. Sixteen prajna bindus, elements also sixteen. Eight channels of empty-clear bindu. Fourteen gathering channels. The rest are path karma.

[14839-14849] The awareness body wheels—sixteen in number. Seven are actual awareness. The rest are bodies. First, the root channel awareness body. Second is the expansive body. Third flows to the heart. Fourth, unchanging vajra body. Fifth, bodhisattva body. Sixth is the nature itself. Seventh, seeing self-liberation.

[14850-14861] Eighth, true bliss body. One extra is the moving. For awareness, two each. Sixteen prajna bindus—eight are empty bindu movement. Four are ground-path bindus. The rest are wisdom movement paths. Sixteen element leaves: from four come wind essences, from four come wisdom-fire essences, from three come earth-yellow essences, from three come water-blood essences.

Emaho! The throat wheel where speech becomes dharma! Press, shake, draw—liberation is in your very channels!
