[76-87] Now the text describes the elaborate mandala of the five families with their symbols—the wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, and crosswise arrangements. Twenty-five fields appear from the lotus-born, with perfume-water flowing from pore-holes like great oceans. Earth, water, fire, wind pervading all places... Don't get lost in the poetic imagery here! This isn't describing some distant Buddha-field you'll visit after death if you're good enough. This is a description of the richness of your own awareness when it's fully recognized.

The five elements—earth, water, fire, wind— pervading with their subtle particles everywhere, along with the Buddha's blessings and beings' karma creating different fields. Round, four-cornered, crescent, semi-circle—immeasurable forms and arrangements. Don't think these are just describing some cosmic geography! These shapes are describing how awareness manifests. Round like completeness, four-cornered like stability, crescent like waxing and waning, semi-circle like partial recognition. All of it inconceivable, immeasurable—not because it's too complex for your mind, but because it transcends conceptual measurement entirely.

[88-98] Round fields, four-cornered fields, crescent fields, semi-circular fields—forms and arrangements immeasurable, inconceivable, appearing. This is the play of awareness! Every possible configuration manifesting spontaneously. And then the text says something crucial: "To the extent that sky pervades, to that extent body, speech, mind, qualities, activities, and fields arising from those pervade." This is describing the boundless nature of awareness itself.

There's no limit to it. It's not contained in your skull. It's not limited by time or space. The Buddha's body pervades everywhere, the Buddha's speech is all sounds, the Buddha's mind is all awareness, the Buddha's qualities are all positive qualities, the Buddha's activities are all benefit that occurs. This isn't metaphor—this is describing how things actually are when seen clearly, serving the purpose of beings in the perpetual continuous wheel without interruption.

[99-105] "This is the training field and activities of the one, the first Samantabhadra." The first Samantabhadra is the Dharmakaya—the body of reality itself. Not a person, not a being, but the nature of reality as it is. "Vast like the dharma-sphere and the sky-field"—the dharmadhatu, the field of all phenomena, is as vast as space itself. It has no center and no edge. It has no beginning and no end.

The text emphasizes this: from this first time only having arisen—years and eons, the field-particles like an ocean cannot be measured. Finally, these activities being complete, the latter end cannot be measured. This is the great field-ocean possessing the essence of unmoving spontaneity—the Buddha naturally spontaneously accomplished, lama of all samsara and nirvana, having come in beginningless time, arranging fields as three different appearances of the three bodies.

[106-111] Longchenpa now gives the three specific field names. In the time of dharma-body, it's called the field of luminous-clarity vajra-essence—emphasizing the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. In the time of self-appearing enjoyment-complete body, it's called the field of Brahma's drum-sound—referencing the cosmological sound-vibration underlying all manifestation. In the time of emanation-body, it's called the great-Brahma eon field—connecting to cyclical cosmology while indicating its supramundane nature.

But remember—these aren't three separate places! They're three ways of describing the same reality from different perspectives. Like how water can be described as H2O, as wetness, or as waves—same substance, different aspects. In this sense, the emanation Buddha of Samantabhadra himself, and those teachers who came in the three times, becoming Buddha through that blessing—all are manifestations of this single nature, appearing differently according to what needs to be tamed.
