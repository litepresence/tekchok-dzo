COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 264

You who seek the nature of the base! Listen to Longchenpa here, at lines [10832-10836]. He speaks of the gathering of meaning, the beginning base essence primordially pure like a conch shell pure unmixed stains. But look—you are not a conch shell. You are not a thing to be compared to a conch shell. The base is not something "like" something else. The metaphor points, but do not mistake the finger for the moon. The base essence is primordially pure. This means it has always been pure. Not "became" pure. Not "will be" pure. Always. Like the sky has always been blue, even when clouds cover it.

At lines [10836-10844], he says outside limitless youth vase body actual-state abides, essence primordially pure empty, thing not-existing although subtle awareness primordial-resonance self-light not-restricted self-possession. The youth vase body—you imagine some beautiful young deity, radiant and perfect. Foolish! The youth vase body is your own nature, unobscured by age or decay, because it was never born. It abides in the actual state, which is not a place. It is the state of actuality itself. Empty, yes—empty of thingness, empty of marks. But not empty of awareness. Not empty of the subtle resonance that is your own primordial wisdom.

At lines [10841-10849], essence nature compassion three possession supreme abide. Essence empty thing and mark not-established. Nature clear primordial-resonance appearance self-face not-abandon. Compassion awareness know wisdom expand arise-base not-cease abide. You want to separate these three. You want to say "Essence is emptiness, nature is clarity, compassion is the function." But they are not three things. They are three aspects of one thing, like a jewel has color, shape, and value. You cannot have one without the others. The essence is empty, yet nature is clear. How? Look at space—empty, yet it appears clear. The compassion is the unce arising of awareness-knowing, wisdom expanding.

At lines [10850-10864], he quotes the Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra. Realize buddha not-arisen. Not-realize sentient-being not-arisen earlier front in. Awareness self-arisen wisdom base from not-moved. You think Buddha is something to become, sentient being is something to stop being. But neither has ever arisen. Where is the Buddha you will become? Where is the sentient being you are now? They are concepts, labels, fingers pointing at the moon. And awareness—self-arisen wisdom—it has never moved from the base. You think you have wandered through samsara for eons, but the awareness that knows that wandering has never moved an inch.

Not-confused buddha great as abide, essence body not-cease abide, essence not-change, method secret, unmoved, not-move, not-shaken. You hear "not-move" and you think you must freeze, hold still, become like a rock. No! Unmoved means not moved by conditions. The essence does not change when the weather changes. The method is secret—not hidden from you, but secret because it cannot be spoken. It can only be recognized.

So look at your own mind. Is it not like the youth vase body—unborn, undying, naturally radiant? Do not look elsewhere. Do not think you will find it in some future practice, some future realization. It is here. It has always been here. The only question is: do you recognize it?
