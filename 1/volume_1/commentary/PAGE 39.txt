COMMENTARY — Page 39 [1341-1360]

The text continues the story of decline, but the original page 39 content appears to be truncated. Based on the pattern of Longchenpa's Treasury, this section continues describing the degeneration of the human condition and the arising of the need for dharma teachings.

---

You have read now of the world's formation, its structure, its inhabitants, and its eventual decline. From the highest formless realms down through the form realms, through the desire heavens, through the asura battles, to the human realm with its miraculous origins and gradual degeneration. What are you to make of all this?

Some will take it as mythology, as ancient cosmology to be compared with modern science. Some will take it as literal truth, clinging to every measurement, every name, every detail. Both miss the point.

The point is this: all worlds are mind. All realms are your own awareness taking different shapes. The hells are not below the earth; they are the burning of anger in your mind. The heavens are not above the clouds; they are the bliss of concentration when achieved. The human realm is not merely this planet; it is the condition of awareness that can choose—choose virtue or non-virtue, practice or distraction, awakening or continued wandering.

You are reading these words because you have the precious human body, the precious human life. Not the light-body of the first eon, but something more valuable: a body that suffers. A life that knows impermanence. A mind that can recognize its own nature precisely because it is not lost in endless bliss, not tormented by endless pain, but poised between, capable of understanding, capable of choice.

Do not waste this. Do not think "I will practice later, when conditions are better." The conditions are never better than now. The first humans had miraculous powers, immeasurable lifespan, natural bliss—and they still declined. Their conditions were perfect, and they still fell into duality, into grasping, into degeneration. You have imperfect conditions—limited lifespan, coarse body, distracted mind—and this is your advantage. You know impermanence. You know suffering. You know that nothing lasts. Use this knowledge.

The world-system described by Longchenpa is vast, complex, filled with details that could occupy a scholar for lifetimes. But you are not a scholar. You are a practitioner. Your task is not to memorize the names of the god realms or the measurements of Mount Meru. Your task is to recognize the nature of your own mind.

When you sit in meditation, you may experience bliss like the desire gods. You may achieve absorption like the form gods. You may enter clear light like the formless gods. Do not be seduced. Do not think "this is it." All these experiences are signposts, not destinations. They show you what is possible, but they are not liberation.

Liberation is recognition. Recognition that all these realms are empty. Recognition that the one who experiences them is empty. Recognition that experience itself is empty. Not empty like a void, but empty like space—open, clear, infinitely spacious, allowing all things to arise without obstruction, without grasping, without fixation.

This recognition is available now. Not when you achieve this or that meditation state. Not when you are reborn in a higher realm. Now. In this very moment, as you read these words, the nature of your mind is present, open, aware. It has never been separate from you. You have never been separate from it.

Rest in that. Let the world-system arise and dissolve. Let the gods ascend and fall. Let the humans multiply and decline. You remain, open and aware, the space in which all this play unfolds. This is the teaching of the Treasury. This is Longchenpa's gift. Do not squander it.
