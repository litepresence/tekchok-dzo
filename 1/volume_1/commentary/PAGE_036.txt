That under wishing-tree completely-surrounded decorated ground—Limit-without from fallen realm expanded: thirty-three. We return to the Thirty-three, to Indra's realm, but now we see the details.

The great elephant with thirty-two gold heads and one turquoise head, roots three power and near-power exercise. This is the elephant Airavata, Indra's mount. The thirty-two gold heads represent the thirty-two major marks of a Buddha, but here they are inverted—instead of being marks of enlightenment, they are the pride of worldly power. The one turquoise head is the single eye of wisdom that is almost lost in the multiplicity of power.

Separate and necklace blazing abodes thirty-three. The elephant wears the thirty-three worlds as his necklace, blazing with the light of their splendor. Powers thirty-three's activities that called. The activities of the gods, their power and glory, are like ornaments—beautiful, impressive, but ultimately just decoration.

Body leagues' four portion two: bow-lengths two-hundred fifty. Life human-years hundred, day one calculated, own-years thousand one enduring. The numbers continue to diminish as we descend. What was two hundred human years per day is now one hundred. What was two thousand god-years is now one thousand one hundred. The trajectory is clear.

That under sun moon planets stars appearing abode Meru peak and yoke-holder basis, thirty-three from expanded realms: Great-king types four called. We have reached the realm of the Four Great Kings, at the base of Meru, where the sun and moon appear. These are the lowest of the desire gods, the guardians of the four directions.

Continents four individual's lords born, power control protect. The Four Great Kings rule over the four continents. They have power, they control, they protect. But they are still bound. They are still within the system. Their protection is conditional, limited, temporary.

Body leagues four portion one, bow-lengths hundred twenty-five, life human-years fifty, day one calculated, own-years five-hundred enduring. The decline continues. Fifty human years per day. Five hundred god-years of lifespan. Still vast, but now comparable to human longevity in the early eons. The gap between gods and humans is narrowing.

These desire-gods types six. Asuras types four: Life-glory god's type thirty-three, body and life equal. Great-power yaksha's type Great-king four's body life enjoyment equal. Fierce naga's type nagas equal. Killer raksasa's type pretas accord. Cruel mara's type cloth-beautiful type and so forth. Paranirmitavasavartin enjoyment's type equal.

The four types of asuras, demons, classified according to their equivalence to gods. The life-glory type equal to the Thirty-three. The great-power type equal to the Four Great Kings. The fierce naga type equal to the nagas. The killer raksasa type equal to pretas. The cruel mara type equal to the highest gods. The paranirmitavasavartin type equal to the gods who control others' emanations.

This classification shows the close relationship between gods and asuras. They are not so different. The asuras are almost gods. They have the same lifespan, the same body, the same enjoyment. Only their mind is different—filled with jealousy, competitiveness, aggression. This is the crucial point. The difference between high and low, god and demon, is not in the external circumstances but in the mind.
