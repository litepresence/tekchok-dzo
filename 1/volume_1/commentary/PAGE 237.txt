[9585-9591] What are you looking for, practitioner? The teaching is right here—in the root channels and winds! The retinue is nothing other than five wisdoms, five winds, five prajnas, five lights, five bodies, five families. These aren't separate deities in some pure land! They're your own confusion, recognized. Time? When body and mind gather—that's the moment! Field? Taming the wanderer in your own skull!

[9592-9596] Dharma? Samsara and nirvana—where do you think they are? Activity? Through relying on this, body and mind's suffering pacifies itself—thus called peace body. Liberating from three realms? Eight aspects, but they're all the same liberation wearing different masks!

[9597-9605] Now the wrathful! Five Herukas of wisdom dwell in the blazing skull charnel ground—your brain, that white conch palace! Teaching? Great bliss blazing and flowing! Retinue? The four lamps blazing in your eyes! Time? When wisdom coils into itself! Field? The eye sense power seeing without ceasing! Dharma? Form's suchness—your own face! Activity? Wild in object and consciousness—thus wrathful body! Cutting through those with wrong views—eight!

[9606-9614] Do you see the trick? Peace body, wrathful body—same display, different gate! Five wisdoms, five families—all are your mind's own radiance. Don't chase the peaceful, don't fear the wrathful. Heruka is not somewhere else—he's what looks through your eyes right now! Emaho!
