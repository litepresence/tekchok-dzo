[9585-9611] Nadis, winds, lights—your inner channels aren't pipes. They're awareness taking shape. Five wisdoms, five families—this isn't counting beans. It's pointing at what you already possess but never looked at directly.

The five Herukas blaze in your skull-cavity right now. You don't need to go anywhere. The lamp-women of the four aspects—they're the display of your own clarity.

[9612-9638] Six hundred sixty-six beings—numbers hide meaning. Look at what purifies what. Third abhijna, boundless power—this isn't about flying through walls. It's seeing how fixation binds you.

Eye wisdom sees forms without grasping. Ear wisdom hears sounds without following. Each sense-power purified becomes a gate of liberation. Thirty existence branches—your own confusions, naked in awareness.

The base is primordially pure. The appearance is spontaneous presence. Don't mix them. Don't separate them.
