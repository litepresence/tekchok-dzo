COMMENTARY ON PAGE 132

Outer: body, speech, mind—three (line 1). Inner: afflictions, poisons—three (line 3). Secret: body, speech, mind—three's support (line 5). With light-rays five's radiance existing: in wheels four's channel-petals: father, mother, method, wisdom's letters: vowel letters sixteen and consonants—thirty-four (lines 7-13).

Listen, you who think the teachings are merely philosophical! Here is the architecture of your own being. Body, speech, mind—outer level. Afflictions and poisons—inner level. The supports—secret level. All expressed through the letters, the very sounds and forms that structure your experience.

Singles, doubles, prefixes, through branch divisions: all eighty-four thousand abiding (lines 15-21). Outer: body's aggregates, elements, sense-fields' support. Cause of speech and expression arising (lines 23-25). Inner: afflictions, thought-collections, eighty-four thousand's support. Day and night, conceptions many arisen, support doing (lines 27-29). Secret: when pure, dharma's gates that many arising, support doing (lines 31-31).

Eighty-four thousand—this is not an arbitrary number. It represents the eighty-four thousand types of afflictions, and thus the eighty-four thousand dharma gates to liberation. Every affliction contains its own liberation. Every poison is itself medicine when recognized.

That also: each consonant with vowel letters sixteen's sound nearby abiding (lines 33-33). Letter's form also that's sound whatever arisen, stacked—for example: KA KĀ—within, life A existing: called A Ā (lines 35-39).

The letter A is the life of all letters! It is the open sound, the space from which all sounds emerge. Just as awareness is the "life" of all appearances—all appearances arise within awareness, are pervaded by awareness, yet awareness itself is empty like the sound of A.

From Symbolic Expression: A is all letters' supreme—within, arisen, birthless (lines 41-45). Thus (line 47): KI KĪ is Ī. KU KŪ is Ū. KE KAI is E AI. KO KAU is O AU. KRA KRA is RA RA. RI RĪ and LI LĪ: life A existing, KI KĪ gathered—AṂ AḤ is KAṂ KAḤ called (lines 49-61).

The vowels emerge from A, modify the consonants, give them life and direction. Just as the manifestations of awareness take countless forms, yet all arise from the same empty ground.

Those root letters: double-stacked KKA said is great. GHA JHA DHA BHA: said like thick (lines 63-65). Triple-stacked and five-stacked, etc.: called "sphere's single letter" (lines 67-69). Suitable ones read as one. Unsuitable ones read separately (lines 71-73).

Channels in thus existing: body, speech, mind, wisdom five, etc., in different spheres (lines 75-75). Letters and similar: light five's appearance having—just brush-strokes, essence white-red, in wind's center, self-clear existing (lines 77-77).

Now: the clear root letters—memory clear, wisdom great—sense-fields clear and unclear: those reverse (lines 79-83). Youth: root letters clear, mind sharp, sense-fields clear (line 85). Old age: root letters unclear, diminished (lines 87-87).

Do you see? Youth and old age are not just physical conditions. They are states of clarity. In youth, the channels are clear, the letters are distinct, awareness is sharp. In old age, they become obscured. This is why it is said to practice while young! But even in old age, recognition is possible. The nature of mind does not age.
