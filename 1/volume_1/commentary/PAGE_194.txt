Listen, you who study empowerment! Lines 8010-8012 speak of symbol-four meaning certainty, thirty-six elaboration-great empowerment classification. You memorize these classifications! But they are just maps. The territory is your own experience.

Elaboration-with medium at lines 8012-8013—those few condensed. You want the condensed version! But condensed means potent—like a seed that contains the whole tree. Don't mistake small for insignificant.

Lines 8014-8018 from Rigpa self-arisen—empowerment form two teach: realize wisdom empowerment, not-realize sign empowerment. This is crucial! One leads to recognition, one to more seeking. Like the difference between tasting honey and just hearing about it—vast difference!

Mark-possessing sign empowerment at lines 8020-8026—meaning wisdom indicate method arisen. You want the signs! But the sign is not the meaning. Like a sign saying "water" when you're thirsty—useful, but you still need to drink.

Lines 8027-8043 describe mark substance, powder maṇḍala, yum bhaga. You get distracted by the forms! But they point to the formless. Like a statue pointing at the sky—follow the direction, not the finger.

Not-realize sign empowerment at lines 8052-8063—substance each meaning each show, generation peaceful, completion wrathful. These are for those not yet recognizing. Like training wheels on a bicycle—necessary at first, but to be removed when balance is found.

Mark-free wisdom empowerment at lines 8064-8067—outer appearance mind play, inner meditation mind place, secret rigpa wisdom self-face. This is it! No marks, no signs, just recognition. Like the sun rising—no one needs to tell you it's light.
