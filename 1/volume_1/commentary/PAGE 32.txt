Consciousness without end—the next formless ayatana. Those beings expand greatly, consciousness without end, form object, wheel enters. Only conceive self to only consciousness, exceed end knowing, condense thing not exist.

You read this and think of infinite consciousness. But listen: what is consciousness without end? It is the mind grasping at itself infinitely. It is the attempt to know the knower. It is the consciousness trying to be conscious of being conscious, stretching out infinitely like mirrors reflecting mirrors. It has no end because it is chasing its own tail.

Arisen from those, beings' form expands without end. Called consciousness without end ayatana. This is the second formless absorption, higher than "nothing at all" but still within the formless realm. The beings here have transcended the perception of "nothing," but they are caught in the perception of "consciousness." They have traded one prison for another.

Those also from above life measure short, body size small, light not clear. Compared to the beings in higher realms, these are diminished. Low concentration—that also cause decline of merit power. The concentration is weak because it is based on grasping. The merit power declines because it is not sustained by wisdom.

Then sky without end ayatana—below that at two thousand leagues, to sky called great cloud various play. Self-appearance concentration, pervaded by various colored cloud mass heaps. This is the third formless realm. Having exhausted the fascination with infinite consciousness, the beings expand into infinite space. The sky without end. The great cloud of various play—the display of phenomena appearing in space.

But it is still play. It is still various. It is still cloud—obscuring, not clear. Immeasurable beings expand from expanding consciousness. The expansion continues, but it is expansion into more of the same. More space. More consciousness. More infinity. None of it is liberation.

Thus from four formless—peak of existence lasts eighty thousand great eons. Nothing at all sixty thousand. Consciousness forty thousand. Sky without end twenty thousand. These are vast numbers, vast time spans. But they are still limited. They end. The peak of existence lasts eighty thousand great eons, but then it ends. What use is eighty thousand eons if it ends in fall?

The text addresses a question: if think body appearance contradicts formless, not contradict. Meditation gods' appearance dwells only as consciousness by formless of light. The formless gods do have bodies, but they are bodies of light, bodies of consciousness. They are not like our coarse bodies of flesh and blood. Desire gods humans' arise without flesh blood body, dwell not actually conceiving consciousness to object. Even in the desire realm, gods arise without the coarse bodies we have. They are more subtle.

Pretas' move without mind form—consciousness clear inside. Hells' experience without suffering body of contact. That consciousness dwelling in concentration joy bliss state also. This is showing the gradations. As realms become more subtle, the reliance on coarse form diminishes. But consciousness remains. Experience remains. The capacity for suffering and joy remains.

Peak of merit share equal fruit, to concentration part four, self-nature emanation appearance body or form, not manifest to below, only see from self place and above. Each realm sees what is appropriate to it. The formless gods see formless appearances. The form gods see form. The desire gods see desire realm appearances. Each sees from their own place and above, but not below. This is the limitation. To see below, to see the suffering of lower realms, one must have compassion. One must descend.

From middle Mother also, that time desire and form, formless dwell gods also holding flower in hand, worship Tathagata. Even the gods in these high realms, when they encounter the teachings, worship the Buddha. They know that their state, however high, is not the ultimate. They offer flowers—offer their merit, their achievement, their very existence—to the Tathagata. This is wisdom. This is the beginning of true path.
