The tantras describe the arrangement of worlds, the beings who inhabit them, the kings who rule. You might wonder why this matters. Here's why: what you take yourself to be determines which world you inhabit.

The Sound Tantra describes how teachings are destroyed. It happens when beings become attached, when wrong desire takes hold. Those individuals become causes for teachings to fade. Each decline has its time, its place, its character.

First dark age, western continent. A king with six fingers, blue teeth, a black mole on his wrist marking evil. Terrifying appearance. Under such rulers, buddha's teaching falls into darkness. Sixty years, an age.

Then Palden rises. A thousand three hundred years pass, and the teaching flourishes again. But decline comes—northern continent, radiant mountains. A monk with loving mind, free of attachment. Two ears, three eyes with coverings. Tirthika sects quarrel. Another sixty years of darkness.

Further ages: kings with one eye, powerful bodies, skilled in archery and magic. They suppress the dharma. Sixty-year intervals of darkness, then flourishing, then decline again.

Pratyekabuddhas appear, the vajra seat arising in the west. Pure teachings lasting one hundred twenty years.

Golden cities, elders with split tongues, humped backs, short limbs, quarreling sects. The same patterns repeating through time.

Lions arise—Palden Seng-ge, ruling for a thousand four hundred years. Then decline again. Princes with reddish complexion, ordained at four finger-heights. Darkness follows.

These aren't just stories about ancient times. This is describing your own mind, your own world. Every time attachment arises, every time wrong desire takes hold, a small dark age begins in your experience. Every time recognition dawns, a golden age.

The geography is inner. The kings are aspects of mind. The continents are states of consciousness. You're not reading about somewhere else. You're reading about yourself.

So which age are you in? Which king is ruling your mind right now? That's the only question that matters.
