PAGE 53 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa speaks now of the transcendent vehicle's superiority [2802-2831], and you must understand what makes it supreme! It is not that it offers better rewards—gods and humans also offer pleasures. It is not that it is more sophisticated—philosophers have endless sophistication. The transcendent vehicle is supreme because it includes what all others exclude.

What does it include? Great compassion combined with wisdom realizing both selflessnesses [2802]. Hear this! Compassion without wisdom becomes mere sentiment, worldly kindness that exhausts itself. Wisdom without compassion becomes cold isolation, liberation only for oneself. But when compassion and wisdom unite—when you see emptiness and it breaks your heart with love for all who do not see—this is the Great Vehicle.

From the Ratnavali: "Emptiness with compassion as essence—this accomplishes enlightenment for some" [2802]. This is the secret formula! Not emptiness alone, not compassion alone, but emptiness AS compassion, compassion AS emptiness. When you truly see that all beings lack inherent existence, how can you not feel compassion for their confusion? When you truly feel compassion for their suffering, how can you hold to any view of their solid existence?

The bodhisattva's aspiration and dedication [2802]—this is what transforms practice from self-liberation to universal liberation. You do not practice to escape; you practice to return, again and again, until all are free. Is this not a heavier burden? Yes! But it is also the only complete liberation. The one who seeks only their own freedom still harbors the grasping that separates self from other.

The definition of the Great Vehicle: "depending on whatever method, leading to the supreme great city of liberation" [2818]. Notice—methods are many! As many as beings' needs. But the destination is one: the recognition that was always present, the liberation that was never bound.

And the eleventh ground, All-Illumination [2818]—this is not a place you reach. It is the full maturation of what was always true: that awareness is all-illuminating, that wisdom pervades everywhere, that there is no corner of existence untouched by Buddha-nature. You do not become this; you recognize you have never been anything else.
