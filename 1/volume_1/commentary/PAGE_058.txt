PAGE 58 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa details the bodhisattva path's stages [2889-2961], and you must not see this as merely theoretical! These stages describe how your own practice will unfold if you commit to the path.

First, the four establishments of mindfulness on the small path of accumulation [2895]—mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena. This stabilizes you. You learn to watch without immediately reacting. You see your body as impermanent, your feelings as unsatisfactory, your mind as changing, your phenomena as selfless. This is the foundation!

Then the four right abandonments on the medium path [2896]—abandoning unwholesome states that have arisen, preventing unwholesome states that have not arisen, producing wholesome states that have not arisen, maintaining wholesome states that have arisen. This energizes your practice!

The four miraculous feet on the great path [2897]—desire, effort, mind, and investigation. This concentrates your power. You become capable of sustained attention, of penetrating insight.

Then come the five faculties on the path of heat and peak [2898]—faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. These are like five roots drawing up nourishment. Without faith, no effort. Without effort, no mindfulness. Without mindfulness, no concentration. Without concentration, no wisdom.

The five strengths on the path of patience and supreme dharma [2899]—the same five, but now unshakeable. You cannot be swayed by doubt, by distraction, by any obstacle.

The seven limbs of enlightenment on the path of seeing [2900]—mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, pliancy, concentration, equanimity. These blossom when you have direct perception of emptiness.

And finally the eight aspects of the superior path on the nine grounds of meditation [2901]—right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration. The complete integration of wisdom and conduct.

But hear this: these are not steps you climb once and for all. You cycle through them again and again, each time more deeply. And the final fruit—the All-Illumination ground, the Dharma body, the form bodies [2905-2913]—is not a reward you earn. It is what you already are, fully revealed when the clouds of confusion dissolve.
