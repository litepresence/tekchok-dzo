COMMENTARY ON PAGE 130

By word meaning, the straight line is connected (line 1). By history meaning, the minds are satisfied (line 3). Thus it is spoken (line 5).

Thus, when not explained, the defects are (line 7). From that itself—if history meaning is not explained, toward this Secret Great Definite Teaching, the defect of mind-not-believing arises (lines 9-15). If root meaning is not explained, dharmas are not gathered into rigpa—the defect of limitless arises (lines 17-21). If yoga meaning is not explained, vehicle distinctions are not divided—big and small ranks become meaningless (lines 23-27). If great meaning is not explained, toward Great Perfection without effort—the defect of meaninglessness arises (lines 29-33). If word meaning is not explained, when tantras are clearly ranked, the defect of not grasping letters arises (lines 35-39). Thus it is spoken (line 41).

Do you see? Each type of explanation serves a purpose. Without history, no faith. Without root meaning, no gathering into rigpa. Without yoga meaning, confusion about vehicles. Without great meaning, the Great Perfection seems meaningless. Without word meaning, cannot read the tantras. All are necessary!

Well explained, the benefits are (line 43). From that itself—thus, when defects are abandoned, all qualities become perfect (lines 45-49). Thus it is spoken (line 51).

The purpose is (line 53). From Rigpa Rangdrol: to protect one's own view and to refute others' views—also called "to explain" (lines 55-61). Thus it is spoken (line 63).

Also from that (line 73)—By tigress-leap wisdom, the great earth is cut and explained (lines 75-77). By mind like a garuda soaring in the sky, chests of meaning are filled and explained (lines 79-81). By mind like a lion's roar, lower vehicles are suppressed and explained (lines 83-85). By mind like a tortoise's slow movement, letters are grasped and explained (lines 87-89). By mind like a raven's claw, error and obscuration are cut and explained (lines 91-93). By mind like a wrestler's striking method, extensive meaning is gathered and explained (lines 95-97). By mind like a sleeping elephant, the view is introduced and focused (lines 99-101). By mind like a garuda's wheel, meaning's focus is sought and explained (lines 103-105). By mind like a vulture devouring, meaning is explained without doubt (lines 107-109). By mind like a young goat climbing cliffs, the inappropriate and appropriate are explained (lines 111-113). By mind like a pearl string, instructional meaning is gathered and explained (lines 115-117). By mind like seasonal dragon-rain, others are refuted and expelled (lines 119-121). By mind like blooming signs, all doors are gathered and explained (lines 123-125). By mind like a wish-fulfilling tree, the very great extensive is explained (lines 127-129). By mind like a clear sky sun, all is pervaded and explained (lines 131-133). By mind like a clear deep moon, samsara and nirvana are explained (lines 135-137). By mind like a lion's sitting posture, meditation's meaning is suited and explained (lines 139-141). By mind like a duck's harmonious movement, meaning's chest is filled and gathered (lines 143-145). By mind like a rainbow in space, dharmasphere is adorned and explained (lines 147-149). By mind like a razor strike, the view's distinction is cut and explained (lines 151-153). By mind like a mirror mandala, two causes and conditions are explained (lines 155-157). By mind like lightning in space, words and meanings are quickly explained (lines 159-161). By mind like empty sky, the extensive end is explained (lines 163-165). By mind penetrating roots, awareness-things are shown and explained (lines 167-169). By mind like a coiled trunk, dharmas are coiled into meaning (lines 171-173). By mind like spreading branches, instructional meaning is impressed (lines 175-177). By mind like extensive leaves, twenty-one like explained (lines 179-181). By mind like a clear flower, two types of lamps are explained (lines 183-185). By mind like ripening fruit, results are explained without return (lines 187-189).

Twenty-eight methods, each with its metaphor! What is the point of all these metaphors? To show that explanation can take countless forms, yet all point to the same recognition. The garuda soaring, the tortoise moving slowly, the razor cutting—all different approaches, same destination.

Those and other explanation methods—are to be known in order (lines 191-193). Thus it is spoken (line 195). Thus explained and heard (line 197).

Now you have heard. The question is—have you recognized?
