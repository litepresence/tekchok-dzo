...continues from page 179...

If fortune possessing, the signs are clear. Direct recognition without elaboration. This is the pinnacle of the path—the very elaborationless empowerment where all distinctions dissolve into natural perfection.

What happens here? Not ritual, not ceremony, not elaborate mandala. Just the meeting of minds. Master and student recognizing simultaneously. The sun risen, words clear, nature seen.

This is not for everyone! Longchenpa has shown us the graduated path—from elaborate to simple, from many to one, from effort to effortlessness. Each step necessary for those who need it. Each step transcended by those who can.

The very elaborationless is the essence of all empowerments. It contains them, yet is free of them. Like space containing all, yet being none.

You who have read this far—do you understand? The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle is not a book to be read once and put aside. It is a manual for liberation, generation after generation. From Samantabhadra to Vajradhara to Vimalamitra to the masters of today—the stream continues.

The life-ten time is now. The teaching is here. The lineage is unbroken. What will you do with it?

Will you merely read and nod? Or will you enter the mandala, receive empowerment, practice day and night, and become the lineage holder for the next generation?

The choice is yours. The teaching is given. The master waits. The dakinis gather. The time is now.

Recognize!
