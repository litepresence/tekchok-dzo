[14206-14220] Listen here! The Kun-darma channel joins mind's movement with pure dharmatā, aligning memory-thought with reality. This matches self-arisen wisdom—earlier and later conceptions self-cease, self-liberate, self-arise. Objects and conditions liberate into dharmatā, memory-conception self-depleted, dharmatā's intent appears!

The *Mu-tig-phreng* tantra teaches: "Body is three-kaya mandala body; words spoken are mantra speech; thoughts are meditation itself." When you squeeze the channel's ripening essence, the channel reaches its own characteristic. Finding the location, you recognize dharmatā arisen from channels. At the channel's leaping time, knowing death-transference and birth-place. Pressing the channel's nature, mind non-separated from samadhi's wheel. Holding the wrapped channel's heat measure, always becomes food yoga. Following the channel's movement calculation, becomes clothing yoga. Relying on the channel's pulsing vital-point, latent tendencies cease—these channel vital-points are extremely profound!

[14221-14235] Now the four wheels! All beings' bodies depend on wheels; even non-wheel dharmas are established from many. Like external existence: wind depends on water, water on earth, etc.—wind-mind clear-essence gathered, water gathers as one, internal body forms. First wheel from water's action—blood, water-yellow, saliva, eye-water arise as essence. Body's increase-decrease is blood's function. When elements heat, blood dries—body becomes disease. Increasing blood cures disease. When cold, blood freezes—disease. Do you see? Your body is the play of these wheels, practitioner!

Emaho! Three kayas right in your flesh!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
