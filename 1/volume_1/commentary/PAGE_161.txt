Two reflections of the teaching. The first is the reflection of faith and blessing—beings' devotion and the guru's grace, pervading all six realms. The second is the actual teaching itself.

The actual teaching has three aspects. First, dharmakaya and sambhogakaya—the teaching of the two bodies, the teacher's self-appearances in the pure sphere. The dharmadhātu palace, clear light, dense arrangements—eternal continuous wheel, always turning.

Then the emanation body: common teachings through sūtra and tantra sequences. The uncommon secret great vehicle, the supreme definite teaching. This teaching isn't found anywhere else—not in the abodes of gods, not in the merit of humans. Even ḍākinīs dwell in human and divine realms, waiting.

When you meet this secret great definite teaching, when the seed-three of the teaching meets you—no effort needed, liberation is certain, no doubt remains.

From the emanation of speech, from letters: whatever teaching the buddhas brought, written in colors matching their bodies. Preserved in jewel caskets, carried under the left arm, read in due time. Honored and worshipped—again, no effort, liberation follows.

Benefits in this life: long life, no disease, wishes fulfilled, demons and obstacles find no opening. At death: no pain, no suffering, a happy passing.

If you see the introduction gate in this life, in the bardo you'll hold fast to the wisdom lamp. Even those with intellectual understanding, holding the vehicle, will be born in pure lands.

Ordinary beings who meet this teaching, even they ripen into higher happy realms. The qualities are beyond counting.

From the Sound Tantra: like the sun illuminating everything, the three kayas descend without effort. Buddha is certain to be obtained. This is the blessing's key point.

Emanation of speech also: the teaching's colors written, placed under the left arm, read and held in time. Definitely, liberation is certain.

Read this tantra always. It works the same way.

Don't underestimate what's being offered here. This isn't just information. It's a transmission. When the letters touch your mind, something happens—effortlessly, without striving. The blessing enters.

Your only job: receive it. Don't block it with doubt, with clever analysis, with the need to understand before accepting. Just receive. The liberation is already certain.
