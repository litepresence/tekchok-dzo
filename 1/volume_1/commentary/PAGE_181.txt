Ah, listen here, you who seek the path! Longchenpa has laid before you the body key-point at lines 7314-7316—seven years of exhaustion reached. Do you understand what this means? Like a farmer who has tilled the same field season after season, the body itself becomes the ground of ripening. 

Look at lines 7317-7319: speech expression lost, twenty-one days, reality exhaustion ground reached. You think you need fancy words? No! The river doesn't need to explain itself to be wet. When speech falls away, what remains? That—look there!

Lines 7320-7322 speak of mind skilled, wind empty, appearance all exhausted. Like smoke rising from a fire and dissolving into the open sky—this is how thoughts exhaust themselves. You don't push them away; they exhaust naturally when you stop fanning the flames of grasping.

The four empowerments complete at lines 7318-7331—you think these are ceremonies? They're recognition! Like suddenly seeing your own face in a mirror you've walked past a thousand times without noticing. The mirror was always there. Your face was always there. You just weren't looking properly.

And this very rare supreme becoming at lines 7327-7328—don't think this is somewhere else, some other time. Like finding water by digging a well in your own courtyard. The water was always there, beneath your feet.

Son power enters purpose at line 7341. You are that son, that daughter. The power is not given from outside. It is your own nature remembering itself, like a person waking from a dream and realizing the dream-tiger never had teeth to harm them.

Listen well to the celebration sequences beginning at line 7343. These are not empty rituals—they are the play of your own awareness recognizing itself. Like a child playing, fully absorbed, yet knowing it is play. This is the great celebration.
