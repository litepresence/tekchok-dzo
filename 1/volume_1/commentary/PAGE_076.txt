Now we arrive at the Bodhisattva vehicle [2787-2818], and this is the path for those who cannot rest while others suffer! The self-enlightened ones are like rhinoceroses, content with their own liberation. The bodhisattva is like a mother who cannot sleep while her child cries—compassion drives them back into samsara again and again.

What makes the Bodhisattva vehicle superior? Great compassion as method, and wisdom realizing both selflessnesses [2802]. This is the union that creates the Great Vehicle! Compassion without wisdom becomes mere sentiment, exhausting itself in endless worldly activity. Wisdom without compassion becomes cold isolation, liberation only for oneself. But together—oh, together they are unstoppable!

From the Ratnavali: "Emptiness with compassion as essence—this accomplishes enlightenment for some" [2802]. This is the secret! Not emptiness alone, not compassion alone, but emptiness AS compassion, compassion AS emptiness. When you see that all beings lack inherent existence, how can you not feel compassion for their confusion? When you truly feel compassion, how can you hold to views of their solid, separate existence?

"Through compassion alone, connection to existence continues until enlightenment" [2802]. The bodhisattva does not flee samsara; they transform it. Even after they could enter cessation, they choose birth after birth, appearance after appearance, because beings need them. This is not martyrdom; this is the natural expression of awakened heart.

From the Compendium: "Without method, separated from wisdom, one falls into the hearer state" [2802]. Method is compassion—the activities that benefit beings. Wisdom is the understanding of emptiness. You need both! Method alone creates virtuous samsara. Wisdom alone creates isolated peace. Together they create the complete awakening of a Buddha.

The essence of the Bodhisattva vehicle [2818]: "realizing all dharmas as space-like, and through great compassion becoming the supreme method or cause for vast conduct benefiting others." Space-like: vast, open, unobstructed, holding all without preference. This is the mind of awakening—spacious enough for all beings' sufferings, open enough to include all beings' joys.
