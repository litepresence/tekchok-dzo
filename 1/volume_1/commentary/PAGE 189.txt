Ah, you who seek the empowerments! Lines 7837-7847 describe vase, secret, prajñā-jñāna, word-empowerment precious complete four. You think receiving these makes you special! But they simply point to what you already are. Like a sign saying "water"—the sign is not the water, but it can lead you there.

The twelve elaboration-with empowerments at lines 7849-7871—washing, crown, vajra, bell, and more. You collect these like treasures! But the real treasure is the recognition they point to. Like collecting maps but never traveling—what use?

Lines 7874-7890 describe the elaborate empowerment sequence—approach, accomplish, near-approach, earth ritual, maṇḍala. You want to do it all perfectly! But perfection is recognizing the perfect nature already present. Like washing a jewel that is already clean—just remove the dust of not-seeing.

Śrāvaka to Dzogchen at lines 7890-7893—nine vehicles all dividing, thirty-six become. You think higher is better! But the highest vehicle is the one you actually practice. Like a boat—any boat that carries you across is the best boat.

Lines 7893-7933 detail the elaborate sequence—hair-cutting, robes, vows, water-strainer. You follow these step by step! Good. But don't mistake the steps for the destination. Like counting each step up a staircase—necessary, but the view from the top is what matters.

The four empowerments at lines 7934-7941—water, crown, vajra, bell earnest empower. These purify the four obscurations. But what purifies? Recognition! Like darkness dispelled by light—the light doesn't "do" anything to the darkness, just reveals its non-existence.

Secret empowerment at line 7942—knowledge-woman earnest empowerment. You get distracted by the form! But this is the union of means and wisdom in your own body. Like two wings of a bird—both needed to fly.
