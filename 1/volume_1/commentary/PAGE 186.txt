Ah, you who enter the mandala! Lines 7615-7624 speak of guru empowerment obtained, food various, dyed cloth, fruit drink. You think these are offerings to buy favor? No! They are symbols of your own qualities being offered to your own recognition. Like a mirror reflecting a mirror—endless, yet nothing added.

The great celebration at lines 7613-7637—this life siddhi any obtain, special time. You think siddhi comes later, after practice? Look now! The siddhi of recognizing mind's nature is available this very instant. Like a person carrying a jewel in their pocket, searching for wealth—foolish! Check your pocket!

Lines 7639-7650 introduce the second meaning: actual path three—where empower, how empower, thus empower. You want methods! But the method is simple: look at your own mind. Like a thief entering an empty house—there's nothing to steal, nothing to lose.

The mandala divisions at lines 7647-7650—basis spontaneous, path reflection, result pure nature. Three mandalas, yet one mandala. Like water can be ice, liquid, or steam—different forms, same essence. Your mind is the basis, the path, and the result.

Lines 7659-7666 describe the root mandala great—each citta mandala center abiding. You search for mandalas in paintings! But the real mandala is in your own heart center. Like a wheel turning, the energies circulate—this is the mandala of body.

Self-arisen awareness mandala at line 7665—this is you! Not something to achieve. Like space that doesn't need to become spacious, your awareness doesn't need to become aware. It already is.
