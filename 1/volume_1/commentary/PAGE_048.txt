Now we arrive at the transcendent vehicle [2430-2474], and here you must pay sharp attention! The difference between worldly and transcendent is not a matter of doing different things—it is a matter of completely different seeing.

The four seals that distinguish the Buddha's teaching [2434]: all compounded things impermanent, all defiled things suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation peaceful—these are not beliefs to adopt. They are facts to be recognized. Look at your own experience! Is anything you grasp permanent? Does anything stained by attachment bring lasting satisfaction? Can you find a self in all your searching? When you stop struggling, is there not peace?

Longchenpa speaks of the vehicle "like space, a measureless great palace" [2446]. Space does not reject anything. It holds all without preference. This is how the bodhisattva's mind must become—vast enough to include all beings, all sufferings, all joys, without being moved from its natural openness.

The nine vehicles [2475-2502] are not rungs on a ladder to climb one by one. They are descriptions of how different minds approach the truth. If you have lesser faculties, you may need the gradual approaches of the lower vehicles. If your mind is sharp, you may go directly to Dzogchen. But do not pride yourself on being "higher"! The pride itself places you lower. The humble practitioner of the lowest vehicle who genuinely transforms their mind surpasses the arrogant Dzogchenpa who merely thinks they are supreme.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo: "By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara. Correct: three stages" [2502-2508]. You are always realizing something. The question is: is your realization correct or incorrect? Correct realization sees through the self and rests naturally. Incorrect realization grasps at something—experience, view, status—and builds a new prison.

The small, medium, and great stages correspond to how much of the self you have seen through. Small stage: you understand intellectually but still grasp at appearances. Medium: you see through outer appearances but grasp at mind itself. Great: even the grasping at mind dissolves, and what remains is what was always there.

Do not compare yourself to these stages. Simply look: what is grasping right now? Release that, and you are already beyond all vehicles.
