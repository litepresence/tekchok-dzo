The demigods' realm described in detail now—golden cities, pleasure-groves, wish-fulfilling trees, great elephants, swift horses. You read this and think of mythology, of ancient cosmology. But look at the envy in your own heart.

The asura city of Gold-possessing, with its assembly-place Good-wealth and its parks of joy—this is the realm of those who have much but cannot enjoy it because they are obsessed with what others have. The tree Chief Tsi Tri Pa, the elephant Difficult-to-endure, the horse Swift—these are the talents and resources you possess, which become sources of competition rather than joy because you compare yourself to others.

You may have wealth, but you see someone wealthier and you are miserable. You may have skill, but you see someone more skilled and you are tormented. This is the asura condition. Not lacking, but unable to enjoy because of jealousy. The demigods have pleasure-groves equal to the gods', but they cannot enter them. They are blocked by the roots of their own resentment.

Then we ascend to the desire gods' realms—the six types. Great King Four, Thirty-three, Conflict-free, Joy-possess, Emanation-joy, Other-emanation-power. Each higher than the last, each with greater pleasure and longer life. You read of their palaces, their gardens, their nectar, their music, and you think "this sounds wonderful." But listen, you who seek true happiness.

These gods are meditators who have achieved temporary concentration, practitioners who have accumulated merit, beings who have created good karma. Their pleasures are the results of virtuous action. But they are still in the desire realm. They still experience desire, albeit refined. They are still within the world-system. When their merit is exhausted, they fall.

The text describes the Thirty-three gods on the peak of Meru, with Indra's palace Completely-victorious, surrounded by four pleasure-groves: Chariot Various-possessing, Rough-change, Enjoyment-mix, Everywhere-joy. These are the four immeasurables—loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity—practiced by those who have achieved the level of the Thirty-three. But practiced with attachment to the experience. Practiced with the thought "I am practicing." This is why they remain in the desire realm.

The tree Complete Gather Burst, the white rock slab, the assembly-place Dharma Good—these are the supports of their meditation. But they are external supports. They depend on conditions. When the condition changes, the support fails. True meditation has no support. It does not depend on a tree or a rock or an assembly. It is the nature of mind itself, always present, always free.

You read of the sun and moon palaces, fifty-one leagues, fifty leagues, made of fire-crystal and water-crystal, surrounded by towers and fences, adorned by gods' cities. Beautiful imagery. But the sun and moon are the right and left channels in your body, the solar and lunar energies. Their palaces are the chakras at the crown. Their circling is the natural movement of prana. Their light is the light of wisdom and method united.

Do not look for these in the sky. Find them in your own body, your own experience. The gods who dwell in the sun and moon are the deities of the channels, the natural luminosity of awareness when the winds enter the central channel.
