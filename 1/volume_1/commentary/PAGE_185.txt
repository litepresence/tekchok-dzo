PAGE 185 COMMENTARY

Listen carefully, you who seek siddhi! Lines 7507-7526 detail miraculous powers—eye medicine, life power, earth-goer, sky-goer. You read these with greed in your heart! But what use are these powers if you don't know your own mind? Like a dreamer who becomes king in the dream—upon waking, what has been gained?

The world empowerment at lines 7527-7541—fire water transform, male female transform, kill and revive. These are the play of elements, the play of mind. Like an artist who can paint any picture, the realized mind can display any form. But the artist is not bound by the painting.

Lines 7543-7561 tell the story of Black Feet, five hundred yogis, feast celebration. You read this as history! But it's instruction. Like a finger pointing at the moon—don't look at the finger. The feast is happening in your own body right now, with your own energies.

The yoginī at lines 7555-7560—feast master speaks, siddhi definite. What made the siddhi certain? The recognition. Like recognizing a familiar face in a crowd—all the searching ends instantly.

Lines 7564-7589 describe the results—elephant ridden, mothers retinue, sky east gone. You think these are literal elephants! Foolish! These are the elements tamed, the energies mastered. Like a skilled rider who controls a wild horse—the horse's power serves the rider.

Now at lines 7588-7590: celebration accomplish, it is spoken. This celebration is not past, not future. It is now. Like the open sky that is always present, whether noticed or not—turn your attention and see!
