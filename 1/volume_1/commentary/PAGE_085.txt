You who enter the vajra vehicle—attend! From self-arisen awareness, the vajra vehicle has two aspects: the outer Muni tantra and the inner means tantra (lines 3166-3172). This is the great division that you must understand.

If you ask what is placed as tantra in mantra, line 3174: When the main person's continuum meets the clear light of expanse, it is called "thus." Tantra means continuity—the continuity of awareness meeting the clear light. This is not something fabricated; it is what you already are.

The outer tantra has three aspects: Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga (lines 3176-3179). First, Kriyā: Accomplishing through the three purifications and pure conduct as self and deity, master and servant, attaining accomplishment (line 3186). Here you see yourself as the servant, the deity as the master. You purify through bath, through changing garments, relying on the three whites and three sweets (lines 3191-3194).

But look deeper! Lines 3196-3205: Not establishing as true in the capacity of conventional appearance. Without abandoning form, not abiding in the extremes of one and many. Meditating on speech syllables and letters, all sounds become clear as deity sounds. The sound extent is no other than the deity of sound. Meditating on the mind's signs, all thoughts become clear as concentration deities.

What is this telling you? That deity and self are not truly separate! But in Kriyā, you maintain the appearance of separation while knowing the deeper truth. It is like a child and parent—the child respects the parent as master, but they are of the same family, the same nature.

The three objects of meditation—visualizing forms, statues, images—all appearances become clear as deity forms (lines 3197). Do you understand? Every form you see is already deity form. Every sound you hear is already mantra. Every thought you think is already wisdom. You do not need to transform them; you need to recognize what they already are!

But you grasp at impurity. You think "this body is ordinary, these thoughts are afflictions." This grasping is your only obstacle. Let it go, and the deity is already present.

The three purifications—deity and mandala, substance and enjoyment, mantra and concentration (lines 3218-3225). These are the doors through which you enter. But remember: the door is not the house. Do not get stuck in the doorway, endlessly purifying, endlessly preparing. Enter!
