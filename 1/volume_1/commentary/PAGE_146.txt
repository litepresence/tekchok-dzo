Listen carefully. If you understand, this great meaning penetrates your mind and settles here permanently.

The tantras explain meaning through two approaches: generally and particularly. Each suited to different minds.

**First approach: for those with self-appearing awareness**

When rigpa is already shining, the tantras speak differently. They point directly: symbol, sound, meaning—three ways to show dharmata. Reality becomes the direct path. The three realms, the continuum of samsara—cut through. No need to reverse anything outward. You recognize the exhausted nature directly.

The tantras say it plainly: tantra, definite arising. Mind types divide into two.

**Second approach: for those with object-focused minds**

These beings hold onto objects. For them, tantras explain through text, through meaning. Whatever they grasp, whatever they desire, the teaching gives them a key point. Each capacity gets its point. And when they realize the inseparability—not dwelling in samsara, not attached to elaborations—they too achieve their goals. Various methods, various accomplishments. Each according to their kind.

Oral instruction for the mind's key points, learned according to individual occasions.

**Four ways the teaching adapts**

Here's how it works across four types of minds:

**First**: For those with elaborations still active—the teaching appears as outer tantra, wrapped in the five perfections, complete manner. Language they can grasp.

**Second**: For those whose elaborations have fallen away—the teaching shows the inner meaning, oral instruction, definite text. Clear and direct.

**Third**: For those with very few elaborations left—the teaching points to name and self-arising text, recognizing the secret directly. No wrapper needed.

**Fourth**: For those with almost no elaborations at all—the teaching is the tantra's meaning condensed, the secret unsurpassed Great Perfection itself. What remains is the teaching.

The teaching is a mirror. It shows you what you need, nothing more. Don't complain the teaching doesn't match your expectations—the teaching matches your capacity. Work with what's given, and the capacity grows.

What you are right now determines what's handed to you. When you change, the teaching changes. That's why the same tantra reads differently to different people—the teaching is alive, responsive, alive to your state.

Stop asking for teachings you can't use. Start using the teaching you have.
