Words also listener's awareness from, meaning sound letters not (lines 1-2). From Uttaratantra: echo like letters not, thus spoken and: how echo's sound, other awareness arisen, concept not craft not, thus Tathāgata's speech, concept not craft not, outer and inner abode not (lines 3-10). Thus manner (line 11).

There tantra arising abode types three (line 12): dharmakāya's abode, dharmadhātu palace great, teacher Samantabhadra, retinue wisdom ocean's gathering, dharma nature great perfection, time reality expression transcended, words letters not spoken (lines 13-19).

Saṃbhogakāya's abode, completely pure dense arrangement, teacher saṃbhogakāya Vairocana retinue Rigpa-five Buddhas and, space Ākāśagarbha etcetera mothers five and, Kṣitigarbha etcetera beings and, Mohinī etcetera consorts and, self-appearance maṇḍala sky sphere whole, dharma great vehicle unsurpassed enumerate, letter six self-sound vowel tongue not spoke understand, wisdom self-appearance time (lines 20-29).

Nirmāṇakāya's abode Tuṣita etcetera, teacher Vajradhara Vajrasattva wisdom illusion body, retinue transcended fortunate guide appearance and, bodhisattvas and, siddhas and, wisdom ḍākinīs and, worldly retinue gods and, humans and, asuras and, garuḍas and, yakṣas and, nāgas etcetera numberless, dharma sūtra tantra inconceivable, time eons countless hundred spoke (lines 30-43).

These occasion time perfection called (line 44).

Listen! Now we see the five perfections from the side of sentient beings—the COMMON introduction. Abode: vast sky. Teacher: self-mind gathering delusion-appearance. Retinue: outer objects and inner thoughts. Teaching: karma, afflictions, samsara dharmas. Time: beginningless, endless, appearance-consciousness.

This is how it appears to the deluded! The same five perfections, but seen through confusion. Yet even here, Ratnaketu tells us: appearance-grasping part pure from, outer objects retinue like appear (lines 15-16). Even in delusion, the pure nature is present. The outer objects appearing as retinue—this is the key! They are not truly separate. They are the display of mind.

And the three kayas' speech—dharmakaya's blessing speech, sambhogakaya's clear speech, nirmanakaya's sixty-fold speech. From the Uttaratantra: like an echo! Not truly existent, yet heard. Not crafted, not conceptual, without outer or inner abode. This is how the Buddha speaks.

The three abodes—dharmakaya's abode in dharmadhatu palace, sambhogakaya's in dense arrangement, nirmanakaya's in Tusita and other realms. Three levels, but all are the display of awareness. The teaching appropriate to each, the retinue appropriate to each, the time appropriate to each.
