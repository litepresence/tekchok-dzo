[15687-15723] Listen, dear practitioner! Feel the heat in your body, understand death's approach, observe the differences in the actions of body, speech, and mind. These are not random occurrences—they follow the deterioration of elements! Look: the elements deteriorate in sequence, reverse, make effort, and change. When moving, they deteriorate; when reversing, they transform; when making effort, they persist; when changing, they evolve. Past time, if long, changes and removes; future time, if long, shifts and transforms. The present, brief as it is, shows through action and counting of change. One youth moves 21,600 winds in a single day—measure this with water-clock and finger-counts! Eight watches in a day, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts. Each shift: 1,350 winds. Each finger: 338 and a half plus eight-eight movements. Each watch: 2,700 movements. Twelve element-actions create 144 permutations, showing twelve winds developing and decreasing. The sun moves south past Meru, making days long and nights short; reversed, days shorten and nights lengthen. The White Lotus commentary teaches: when going south, add and subtract. Two water-clock measures change each month. Six hundred seventy-five wind movements increase and decrease with each measure. This is the body-clock, the breath-timer, the secret of elemental balance! Understand this, and you hold the key to the body's wisdom winds. Practice with precision, and the channels open like flowers to the sun!
