[510-511] From Ati Kodpa Chenpo, spoken in the Land of Turquoise Letters, extensively arising. From these also, the inexhaustible body, speech, and mind ornament wheel's thirty-six activities.

[512-518] The body's outer four activities: Aiming to abandon the four rivers of suffering—birth, worldly games, miracles competition, manifestation, and alms round conduct.

[519-525] The inner four: Aiming to abandon retinue and enjoyments—horse supreme, discarding chariot, going to the essence of bodhi, spreading light rays, transforming weapon rain into flowers.

[526-529] The secret four: Aiming to tame at the end of teaching through samadhi—performing austerities, at Mount Golden Samadhi sound hundred-twenty thousand moments manifesting.

Listen, dear practitioner! Do you see how the Buddha's activities are vast? Outer, inner, secret—each level deeper than the last. The Buddha appears to abandon suffering, to teach through play, to tame through samadhi. But these are not different Buddhas—they are one wisdom displaying according to need. Do not get stuck on outer forms! See through to the wisdom activity behind them all.

Emaho! Thirty-six activities of inexhaustible body, speech, and mind!
