[14240-14246] Listen here, dear practitioner! Squeezed flesh, flesh variety from heart branched and supported—these when cut, pinched, struck, pierced make life's end. Burning and roasting through dependent origination liberates from disease!

[14247-14252] Thus from earth, wood and so on arise—fire's cause in So-nga Wang-ra. Third wheel fire's action chief. This produces body's heat, faculties, color. When heat is great, becomes hot element, making body's disease and death conditions. When heat is small, becomes cold disease condition. Elements equal through dharmat's dependent origination liberates!

[14253-14264] Also fire heat moved by wind moves, blazing like great fire. Fourth wheel wind's action work, breath outside-inside moving, rising-descending eliminating work. Karma wheel makes samsara's root. Latency and hatred's work disturbs body elements' individual functions, making disease and death conditions—liberation through dependent origination of elements placed in vital-point.

Do you see? Disease comes from elements disturbed! Liberation comes from recognizing dependent origination!

Emaho! Elements equal—liberation through dharmata!
