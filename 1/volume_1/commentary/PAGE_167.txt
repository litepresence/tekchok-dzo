The marks of the master! Mole A mark on the nose-tip—the sign of one who holds the definitive oral instructions. Clairvoyance, prophecy of the future, clear showing of difficult points. This is not ordinary praise. These are the signs of a true vidyadhara.

And when such a master passes into nirvana—the earth moves, forests tremble, five lights pervade the sky, music plays spontaneously. These are not just poetic descriptions. They are the signs that appear when a great being departs, if you have the eyes to see.

The relics, the rainbows, the dakini offerings—these are the natural expressions of a realized master's final liberation. The five lights dissolve into space, yet emanations continue to benefit beings.

Vimalamitra's compassionate emanations have come to Tibet. Kumārarāja is here. The teaching is alive! Seven generations have flourished. Now, in the life-ten time, it is your turn. Will you be merely a spectator, or will you enter the mandala?
