Even before birth, boys and girls are already different. Not in worth. In orientation.

Male children gaze inward from the mother's right lung—already preparing to hold their own home. Female children gaze outward from the left—already oriented toward leaving. This is not cultural conditioning. This is constitution. From dependent-origination's action, the pattern begins. At nine months and ten days for boys, nine months for girls, birth occurs.

Wind from avadhuti moves through the nose-channels, right and left. Afflictions grow coarser. The storehouse of many karmic actions takes shape.

Four elements mature the body: earth becomes flesh, water becomes blood, fire becomes warmth, wind becomes breath. But these are not neutral processes. Flesh generates delusion. Blood generates desire-attachment. Warmth generates anger. Breath generates pride. Jealousy and other poisons arise as natural byproducts.

The body is not separate from the mind. The constitution is not separate from the confusion. First, desire-attachment motivates everything—this is why beings are born at all. Then, anger shapes the blood, gives rise to speech. Then, ignorance shapes the mind, gives rise to confusion. Riding the breath-horse, going through the world, the three poisons generate different thoughts.

Where does each poison mature? Delusion matures in sleep. Desire-attachment matures in laughter. Anger matures in dreams. The body reflects the conditioning: heavy flesh means heavy sleep. Anger's heat produces vivid dreams of moisture and warmth. When anger rises, the body heats up, speech becomes urgent. When desire-attachment rises, moisture arises, agitation follows.

All of this from depending on flesh, the form-aggregate spreads.

You're not a person who sometimes gets afflicted. You're an affliction that sometimes takes human form. The structure is built into the materials.

But here's the cut: the materials were never solid to begin with. The flesh is empty. The blood is empty. The heat and breath are empty. The poisons are empty. The dreams are empty. The sleep is empty.

What remains when emptiness is recognized? Nothing to fix. No one to fix it.

Rest in that. The rest is already complete.
