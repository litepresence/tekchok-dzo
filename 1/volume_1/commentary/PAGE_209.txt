Listen, you who would know bliss! Lines 8669-8678 describe bliss arise sequence—first joy, second feeling, third bliss, fourth experience, fifth emptiness. You think bliss is just one thing! But it has stages. Like climbing a staircase—each step higher than the last.

First joy only from at lines 8680-8684—second feeling experience touch, third bliss itself, fourth experience co-emergent, fifth emptiness. You progress through them! But they blend into one. Like colors of the rainbow—distinct yet flowing together.

That view join change measure at lines 8686-8697—first consort actually not use, ordinary desire self not view, then actual body release bodhicitta hold purify, then purify release measure reach, view stable. You change your view! But change means transformation. Like a caterpillar becoming butterfly—same being, new form.

Also from before at line 8697—change and obtain and stable, three bodies ground go. You reach the grounds! But they are within you. Like finding rooms in your own house—always there, just not seen before.
