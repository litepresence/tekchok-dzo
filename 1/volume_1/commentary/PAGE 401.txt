[16743-16745] You sit there, waiting for something to happen. Fool. The bindu already falls through your channels. The peacock's tail spreads in your own skull-cave. Don't look elsewhere.

[16746-16749] Twelve similes—twelve traps for your conceptual mind. Vulture's eye, fish eye, cat eye, thief's eye. You want to understand? Look at your own eyeball. The light you see is your own rigpa shining back at you.

[16750-16755] Peacock tail, vulture eye, fish eye, thief eye. These are not metaphors in a book. They appear in your meditation right now. You miss them because you wait for something grand.

[16756-16760] Third sphere—completely pure lamp. Essence, definition, classification, nature, characteristic. You want to analyze? The lamp is already blazing. Your analysis is smoke obscuring the flame.

[16761-16767] Familiarization, measure, abode, door, actual, simile. Eleven aspects. You think knowing them helps? The lamp needs no student. It shines whether you study or not. But you must look.

[16768-16771] Five colors spread like a house under a barrel. Blue at the center. You search for this in scriptures? Open your eyes. The space between your eyebrows is the treasury.

[16772-16777] Snake-noose rays shoot from the fence. The bindu's light-house moves slightly. You feel it as dizziness, as bliss, as fear. Don't name it. Let it move.

[16778-16783] Who familiarizes with this meaning? You already do, every night when dreams dissolve. Blue, unchanging, self-luminous. The fence abides at the rim. Self-luminous outer objects appear. This is unfabricated essence.

[16784-16788] First gaze: sky-blue pervades the treasury-brow. Colors five arise within. Rainbows at the eye's corners. Pearl garlands. Like sky-rainbow, pure of afflictions.

[16789-16796] Vast sphere, uncut expanse. Pure appearance meets pure condition. Five colors together. You think this is description? It is instruction. Look now.
