COMMENTARY ON PAGE 129

Thus is the definitive manner of explanation established (line 1). The arising-basis of letters, their sounds and meanings hereby declared (line 3). Listen well, you who would understand the very structure of these teachings!

First: Though explanation methods are manifold, in summary they are established as three (lines 5-7). From Rigpa Rangdrol (line 9)—The King of Teachings' manner of explanation also is expounded according to this very occasion (lines 11-13). Scripture-style explanation and tantra-style explanation, instruction-style explanation—these three (lines 15-17). Through the gate of entry they are to be known (line 19). Thus it is spoken (line 21).

Three styles—scripture, tantra, instruction. Each for different capacities, different needs. But all lead to the same recognition. Do not think one is superior to another! They are medicine for different diseases.

There, scripture-style explanation is shown by means of the five perfections (line 23), tantra-style explanation is declared by means of the three definite abodes (line 25), oral instruction is explained by basis, path, and result—these three (lines 27-27), from which here the main tantra-style explanation has three abodes (lines 29-29):

For the sharp-facultied, by mentioning names, toward realization's face the tantra's name-meaning is expressed (lines 31-31); for the middling, by mentioning types only, toward realization's face the five perfect complete-abidings are shown (lines 33-33); and for the dull, with example and meaning, toward realization's face the body is extensively explained (lines 35-35).

Three types of beings, three ways of teaching. The sharp-facultied hear a name and recognize immediately. The middling need types and classifications. The dull need extensive examples and explanations. Be honest—which are you? There is no shame in being dull! Better to be a dull practitioner who recognizes than a sharp one who is proud.

First: From that itself—that also name explained is like this: name, homage, and promise (lines 37-43). Thus it is spoken (line 45).

Second: Also from that itself—the introduction shown is like this: teacher, mother, and the retinue, and father's request—all are to be known (lines 47-55). Thus it is spoken (line 57).

Third: The body brief, extensive, extremely extensive by means shown, conclusion with meaning and rejoicing (lines 59-63). From Rangdrol: text shown is like this: sūtra and great extensive, and extremely great extensive explained (lines 65-71). That is shown by the text's words (line 73).

Conclusion's meaning is like this: oral instruction meaning untied explained, that great tantra is definitely shown (lines 75-79). Secret mantra all's explanation method—thus all are to be known (lines 81-83). Thus it is spoken (line 85).

That also, from the manner of explanation method's two definite branches: first, grounded by five types, is explained (lines 87-89).

From the Sun-Moon-Joined Tantra (line 91)—By root meaning: name-identity grasped (line 93). By yoga meaning: conclusion gate shown (line 95). By purpose meaning: one's place established (line 97).

These are the five types—root, yoga, purpose, word, history. Each serves a function. Together they ground the explanation so it cannot be shaken by doubt or confusion.
