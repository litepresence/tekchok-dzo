[10085-10114] Mind samaya—outer's outer harm-mind abandoning. Hold harm-mind even toward common being? Leprosy body, cold hell certain. Hold harm-mind toward vajra holder? Suffering multiplies beyond expression.

[10115-10148] Outer's secret—wrong-view arising. Established-view becomes wrong-view. Once root samaya exceeded, earth-dwell fire suffering. Long time dwelling. No chance of liberation.

Mind's inner—outer conduct, inner meditate, secret view. Wrong view, wrong meditation, wrong conduct? Path is wrong. Whatever suffering beings experience, ripens in your mind.

Secret's three—outer view meditate conduct, inner yi-dam, secret guru and sibling. Abandon yi-dam, destroy actual-accomplish. Abandon guru, nothing accomplished anywhere. Mind-thought of virtue abandoned—actual-accomplish degenerated.

Yi-dam is your own face. Guru is your own wisdom. Abandon them and you've abandoned yourself.
