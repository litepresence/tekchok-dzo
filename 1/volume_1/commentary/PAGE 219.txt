PAGE 219 COMMENTARY

Listen, dear practitioner! Look here at lines [8941-8964]! The stains that cling to your body, speech, mind, and consciousness—these are not your true nature! Like dust settling on a mirror, they obscure but do not change what is already perfect and pure.

The four empowerments are the waters that wash these stains away. Body, speech, mind, consciousness—each carries four stains, sixteen in total. But look deeper! These sixteen multiply through elaboration-with and elaboration-without, sign and meaning, until thirty-two obscurations stand purified. Like a lotus rising through muddy water, you emerge unstained!

Lines [8951-8958] reveal the eightfold path of purification: elaboration-with sign and meaning, elaboration-without sign and meaning, very elaboration-without, and extremely elaboration-without. Each doorway leads to the same primordial purity. Like rivers flowing to the ocean—all paths converge in realization!

The mind that thinks virtue and non-virtue, prophecy and non-prophecy, grasping and rejecting—all these thoughts are the very stains themselves! But who is the thinker? Search and you will find only empty space. Like searching for the color of the sky—you look everywhere and find nothing to grasp!

Doubt is the demon that binds you. Analysis is the net that ensnares you. Release the mind that holds objects variously! Let thoughts arise and dissolve like clouds in the vast sky of awareness. The thirty-two stains purify not through effort but through recognition—seeing their true nature as emptiness!

Emaho! The stains were never real!
