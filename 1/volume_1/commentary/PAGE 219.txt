Lines 8931-8950 describe those empowerments purify—body speech mind consciousness four stain purify rely establish, body water collection dharma binding seal, fire ripen clear, wind action done attachment, speech speak think deceive, speak do body, speak word thought examine, expression thought change. You purify all these! But stains are adventitious. Like dirt on a mirror—not the mirror's nature.
