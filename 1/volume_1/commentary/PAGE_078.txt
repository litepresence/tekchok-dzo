PAGE 78 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa details the stages of the bodhisattva path [2889-2902], and you must walk these stages yourself! Whether you are householder or monastic, the path is open. The lay practitioner's vow or full ordination—both are suitable [2889-2891]. What matters is not the outer form but the inner transformation.

The ten novice disciplines, the two hundred fifty bhikshu precepts, the three hundred sixty-three bhikshuni precepts [2890-2892]—these are the foundation. Without discipline, meditation has no base. Without ethical conduct, wisdom has no ground. Do not think you can skip this! The great Dzogchen practitioners of the past were also great upholders of discipline.

Generating the mind of awakening [2893]—this is the entry into the Great Vehicle. Not just wishing to be enlightened, but wishing to awaken for the benefit of all beings. This changes everything! Your practice is no longer for yourself; it is for everyone. Your obstacles become opportunities to develop patience. Your successes become offerings to others.

The eighty-five training sutras [2894], the four establishments of mindfulness on the small path of accumulation [2895], the four right abandonments on the medium path [2896], the four miraculous feet on the great path [2897]—this is systematic progression! Each stage builds on the previous. Each practice prepares the ground for the next.

The five faculties on the path of heat and peak [2898]—faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. Like five roots drawing nourishment from the soil of practice. The five strengths on the path of patience and supreme dharma [2899]—the same five, now unshakeable, irreversible.

The seven limbs of the path of enlightenment on the path of seeing [2900]—mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, pliancy, concentration, equanimity. These blossom when you directly perceive emptiness. Not merely understand intellectually, but see directly, unmistakably, that all phenomena lack inherent existence.

And finally the eight aspects of the superior path on the nine grounds of meditation [2901]—right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration. The complete integration of wisdom and conduct, the fruition of the path.
