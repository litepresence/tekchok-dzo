COMMENTARY ON PAGE 143

From the Treasury (line 1): the first of the four introductions arising from the tantra. Holding the seeds of the five. Thus it is spoken (lines 3-5).

These two perfections give rise to the fivefold reasons, namely: common and uncommon reasons (lines 6-7). First (line 8): whatever tantra has arisen, the teacher and retinue are therein certain to be taught. That time and place are certain to exist. Those gathered simultaneously arise in time (lines 9-11).

Second (line 12): when matter and consciousness gather, the body serves as support, placed in a certain abode. In the field of form aggregates, the consciousness as teacher, gathered with perception as retinue. The teaching of feeling arises. Formations have five times, certain (lines 13-18).

Those five impure aggregates of the disciple-base are tamed by the five perfections of the introduction-base. Suitable for disciple and method (lines 19-21).

From that itself (line 22): the individual persons of disciples. The five types of disciple-base aggregates. The introduction-base of that method. Thus it is spoken (lines 23-26).

That also is called the five perfections of the introduction-base, namely (line 27): basis, abode, time, teacher, retinue, the five dharmas (lines 28-32).

Each of those also becomes threefold (line 33). From the Treasury (line 34): the introduction is expressed in words. The basis has five types. Abode is accepted as threefold. What is called perfection is gathered. The three appear as numbers. The gathering of qualities is complete (lines 35-40).

The teacher himself is also threefold. What is called perfection is the completion of the kāyas. The three kāyas arise as three. The gathering of retinue is assembled (lines 41-44).

The retinue is also threefold. What is called perfection is arranged in form. The three appear as various gatherings. The gathering of faith and aspiration (lines 45-48).

The teaching itself is also threefold. What is called perfection is the very essence. The three are the precious collections. The gathering liberates persons (lines 49-52).

Time also has three gathering into four. The perfection of all vehicles. The three are past, present, the gathering is definitively complete (lines 53-56). Thus (line 57).

Second, the individual meanings extensively explained in two parts (line 58).

Uncommon introduction and, common introduction extensively explained (lines 1-2 of next section). First is (line 3):

Awareness wisdom abiding manner five perfections possessing abiding, uncommon introduction expressed shown (lines 4-5). That also clear light tantras beginning, thus I taught time once, thus arising is (lines 6-8). Manner basis thing nature abode ultimate truth showing, vehicles dark sūtra tantra surpassing (lines 9-10).

From Talgyur (line 11): uncommon distinguished, vehicles all surpassing sign. Thus it is spoken (lines 13-14).

Here divide two (line 15): basis thing nature abode five perfections possessing shown and, that arrangement body how abiding five perfections (lines 16-17). First is (line 18):

Abode perfection, reality elaborations free characteristics wherever not-established, words letters sphere not (lines 19-21). Thing abiding manner teacher perfection: elaboration-basis word only not thing signs not-established self-arisen awareness (lines 22-23). Teacher that retinue perfection. Reality's play wisdom ocean's collection (lines 24-25). Teaching perfection, nature equality dharmadhātu ultimate abode great perfection tathātā (lines 26-27). Time perfection, all not-separate one and many both not reality inconceivable clear light great time (lines 28-29).

Thus also (line 30):

From Ratnaketu (line 31): not-existing empty dharmadhātu from, primordial first Buddha by, awareness and wisdom distinction from, reality empty self-sound, primordially dharma wheel turned, beginning middle end without (lines 33-38). Thus spoken and (line 39):

Secret great's self-sphere in, primordially abiding from, not-grasped abode manner possessing, play great first arisen (lines 40-43). Thus it is spoken (line 44).

Second body's five perfections (line 45):

Abode perfection, CITTA jewel palace channel essence great center in (lines 46-46). Teacher perfection, self-arisen awareness clear light supreme unchanging nature nature compassion three nature, five kāyas, five wisdoms, five lights, five wisdoms, five winds, bindu tiny etcetera retinue perfection surrounding (lines 47-51). Dharma perfection, channel wind bindu key points and, key point arisen bliss-clear non-conceptual wisdom advice practice experience with (lines 52-53). Time perfection, awareness meaning familiar self-arisen self arisen (line 54-54).

Do you see the profundity? The five perfections exist at multiple levels—outer, inner, secret. Each of the five becomes threefold. This is not mere multiplication of categories. It is the recognition that each aspect of the teaching contains all aspects.

The abode perfection—reality free of elaborations. The teacher perfection—self-arisen awareness. The retinue perfection—the play of wisdom. The teaching perfection—the nature equality of dharmadhatu. The time perfection—the inconceivable clear light that transcends one and many.

And from Ratnaketu—from the not-existing empty dharmadhatu, the primordial first Buddha, awareness and wisdom distinguished, reality's empty self-sound, the dharma wheel turned primordially without beginning, middle, or end!

This is the uncommon introduction—the introduction from the side of awareness itself, not from the side of sentient beings. This is the clear light tantra, the ultimate truth. Not taught as something new, but recognized as what has always been.
