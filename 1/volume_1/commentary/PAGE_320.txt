The wind channels moving, leaping. YAṀ—the syllable of movement, of breath, of the going and coming of all beings. From this syllable, existence pulses.

Earth channels, water gathering, fire's three actions. YAṀ again, piling and separating. YE separating and gathering. AUM—rolling, bowing, abiding.

Within the four syllables, the aggregates form at the particle level. The form aggregate: particles, subtle. The perception aggregate: warmth, like a horse galloping through space. The feeling aggregate: memory's cord, coiled three ways. The consciousness aggregate: knowing, color, movement. The formation aggregate: feeling's doors opening.

Five aggregates arising from the elements, five bases from conditions. Around these five, like a net of light, the five syllables adorn the five heads of the five supports: DZRIṀ, KHAṀ, TĀṀ, MAṀ, BYAṀ. These are the five buddha families, the five vital points.

From these syllables, transformation happens. The changeless awareness becomes buddha certain.

Within water channels, four aspects: primordial wisdom, not opening, not distinguishing. The body becomes a thousand subtle drops, cooled, clear. Five lights gathering, five wisdoms arising.

The syllable OM and others—AUM, DZRIṀ, KHAṀ, HŪṀ, TĀM, SWĀ, MAṀ, HAPYAM—from these, certainty of awakening.

All of this is the wisdom that is self-arisen, spontaneously present. Not constructed, not made. Already complete within the construction itself.

The five buddha families, five wisdoms, five lights—all arising from the same source. The syllable contains everything. The body is a display of syllables, a congregation of sounds that have arranged themselves into form.

What does this mean for you?

You're not just flesh and bone. You're syllables, sounds, elements, lights arranged in this particular pattern. The pattern will dissolve back into its elements. The syllables will return to their sources.

But awareness—the knowing that experiences all this—that was never a syllable, never an element, never formed from parts. Awareness is the space in which syllables arise and dissolve.

Don't identify with the syllables. They're just visitors, passing through. You are the sky they're passing through.

The construction is temporary. The sky is permanent.
