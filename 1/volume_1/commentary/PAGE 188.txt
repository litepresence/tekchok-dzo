PAGE 188 COMMENTARY

Listen, you who would know the deities! Lines 7777-7781 speak of Herukas—Vajra, Padma, Karma. You worship these as gods outside yourself! But they are your own wisdom energies made manifest. Like a lamp appearing to display different colors through different colored glass—the light is one.

The wrathful residence at lines 7783-7797—posture stance strike, fierce manner, thunder-sound. You fear these wrathful forms! But they are the compassion of your own mind, fierce against delusion. Like a mother's fierce protection of her child—not anger, but love in action.

Four natures of empowerment at lines 7799-7803—elaboration-with, elaboration-free, very elaboration-free, completely elaboration-free. You think these are stages to climb! But they are simply descriptions of how recognition can dawn. Like describing dawn in different ways—still the same sun rising.

Lines 7805-7818 from Thal-gyur: outer, inner, secret, secret complete, combined form four. You want to know which is best! But all are paths to the same recognition. Like different doors into the same house—enter through whichever is open to you.

The four seasons at lines 7821-7824—spring, summer, autumn, winter. You feel these as outer weather! But they are the cycles of your own energies. Like the breath flowing in and out, the winds of the body have their seasons.

Body, speech, mind, consciousness gathering-four at lines 7825-7828. These are not four separate things! They are one awareness displaying as four. Like a single actor playing four roles—different costumes, same actor.

Delusion, hatred, desire, portion-equal four at lines 7829-7832. You try to destroy these! But when recognized as the play of awareness, they are the four wisdoms themselves. Like poison transformed into medicine by the skilled doctor—same substance, different effect.
