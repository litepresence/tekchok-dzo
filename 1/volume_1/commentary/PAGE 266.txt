COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 266

You who divide essence from nature! Longchenpa shows you at lines [10907-10913] that complete one appearance great, compassion understanding not-cease abide, and from the Thalgyur Tantra: beginning essence nature and, compassion form three-as abide. That also essence body-as abide, Dharma and enjoyment emanation part, not-divide divide not-exist manner. You think essence is one thing, nature another, compassion a third. You think the three kayas are separate—Dharmakaya here, Sambhogakaya there, Nirmanakaya somewhere else. But look—can you separate water from its wetness? Can you separate fire from its heat? They are not divided because division does not exist in the manner of actual-state.

At lines [10915-10924], bebs from accomplish itself at also, body color etc mind object not-exist, nature arise-do light manner, white red yellow and green blue is, mark marked not-is, category not-exist knowable bebs from accomplish, compassion arise various from, this-like one certain not-exist, various appear base called. You want to know what the nature does. It arises as light—white, red, yellow, green, blue. But these are not marks. They are not categories. They are not knowable as separate things. The compassion arises variously, but there is no certainty, no fixed form. The base is called "various appear" because that is what it does—it appears variously. Like a crystal prism that shows many colors, but the crystal itself has no color.

At lines [10925-10937], he warns: That also essence primordially-pure reverse-from examine if what-also not-established outside clear part light and body color etc marked not-established although. That nature spontaneous-presence expanse from primordial-resonance light five body and ray and sphere appear most subtle identity. You examine the essence and find nothing established. You look for light, body, color, marks—and they are not established as separate things. Yet the nature spontaneously present shows the five lights, the bodies, rays, spheres, most subtle identity. They appear, yes, but not as things you can grasp.

At lines [10937-10944], inside clear subtle desire break end from liberate. Thus limit-free self-arisen wisdom essence empty where-also not-established, nature clear appear manner not-cease, compassion understanding not-cease what-like-also arise base do is. Base thing essence actual-state is. Inside the clear subtle, desire breaks, ends, liberates. Why? Because the essence is empty, not established anywhere. The nature is clear, appearing without ceasing. The compassion is the understanding that does not cease, whatever arises. This is the base. This is the essence actual-state. Not a thing. Not nothing. The actual state itself.

So stop trying to separate essence from nature from compassion. Stop trying to find the base as a thing. It is the actual-state. It is what is actually happening right now, without your concepts about it. Can you see it? Can you rest in it? That is the only question worth asking.
