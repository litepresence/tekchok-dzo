[462-497] The twelve emanations continue: Eighth at Gridhrakuta (Vulture Peak), teacher Supreme Golden Light teaching vinaya to sravakas. This corresponds to the historical Buddha's teachings on monastic discipline. Ninth in Mongolian turquoise-eyebrow land, beneath the bodhi-tree, teacher Love-Play Wisdom teaching sutra-tantra combinations. Tenth at Gridhrakuta again, teacher Kashyapa the Elder teaching various vehicles. Eleventh at Vajrasana, teacher Abhisambodhi King teaching definitive-meaning vehicle only. Twelfth at Varanasi, teacher Shakyamuni teaching the three baskets.

Notice how the twelve emanations cover the full spectrum of Buddhist teachings—from the most esoteric Dzogchen tantras to the basic vinaya discipline. This represents the complete mandala of the Buddha's activity. There's nothing left out. Every aspect of the path is included.

The timeframes get progressively shorter—from immeasurable lifespans down to one hundred years for Shakyamuni. This represents the degeneration of the dharma over time from the perspective of cosmic history. But don't be discouraged! In Dzogchen, none of this matters. The recognition of awareness is available right now, regardless of what era it is.

[498-509] Now a quotation from the Rigpa Rangshar Great Tantra: "At beginningless time, my precious jewel lost, by jewel-lost self-nature, from darkness-appearance interval came..." This is describing the human condition! The precious jewel is your own awareness—primordially pure, naturally present, but unrecognized. "Lost" not because it's gone anywhere, but because you don't recognize it. The "darkness-appearance interval" is samsara—the confusion that arises when awareness doesn't recognize itself.

"By four conditions concept impure"—the four conditions that lead to delusion. But then: "To Tushita upper-chamber land came, support is pure lotus, secret mantra great teaching established." This is describing the path of return—how the teaching manifests to guide beings back to recognition. The secret mantra (Vajrayana) is the swift path, the direct route to recognition.
