[14456-14467] Listen here, dear one! These channels have secret names in the medical tradition. The long bindu tail dwells at the right waist—cut it to benefit kidney disease. The short bindu tail at the left—cut it for spinal curvature. The bol gong at the right holds sha's tail—cut for wind disorder. The klong du gyu at the left—cut for ear disease. The left tail at the ankle's outer edge—cut for kidney ailments. These are not anatomy lessons! These are signs pointing to where energy gets stuck in your own body.

[14468-14485] The kham letter dwells at the left—called the kidney grasping channel in medicine—cut it for lumbar distortion and hip pain. But listen well, practitioner! When disease arises, the yogi does not do this to oneself! When these letters arise internally, recite them verbally with breath five times each, expelling them to the nostril—this is liberation! The ti and ti at right and left forehead, la at right and left thigh hollow, sa and sa at right and left kidney hollow, sha and sha at the armpit—these points burned heal disorders. But the yogi does not burn oneself! Draw breath from outside to inside with awareness—this is the path!

Emaho! The body itself is the mandala of liberation!
