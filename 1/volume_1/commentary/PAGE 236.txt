[9546-9566] Look here. Five perfect kayas, eight manifestations—these aren't stories about someone else. They're your mind's own display. You sit by this fire thinking bodies stack up like bricks, but look closer. The emanation body isn't distant. Right now, it's how you appear to others.

[9567-9584] Essence body—where can you point? Mind's nature has no mark, no parting. No dust on this mirror. The ocean of wisdom doesn't gather waves. This isn't philosophy. Touch your face. That's the form body, yet where's its essence?
