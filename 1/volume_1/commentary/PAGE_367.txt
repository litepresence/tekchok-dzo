[15354-15364] Crown top straight—letter A dwells! Medical tongue gnyan rope! Cut for heart fever disease! From here right one tsen—letter Kā dwells! Named Bodhi-right! Cut for right waist disease! Left one tsen—Kī letter! Named Bodhi-left! Cut for left waist disease!

[15365-15378] Then four finger-widths skull top—Ki dwells, named great eyelid! Cut for skull swelling! Right one tsen—Ku dwells, named conch-channel circle-ma! Cut for right lung disease! Below that one tsen—Klu letter, named erect conch-channel! Cut for left lung disease! Then one tsen front—Kyeh dwells, named small eyelid! Cut for eye disease! Its right one tsen—Kyeh dwells, named yellow bile channel!...

Your skull alone holds sixteen vital points! Sixteen doorways to recognition! Don't cut with knives—cut with awareness! Emaho!
