You're not building a body from scratch. The body builds itself. You're just watching the show.

Listen to how it happens. The two wheels of your energy system—abandoned, scattered by wind. You think you have control over your nervous system? The wind has been rearranging your consciousness since before you had a name. The wheels spin, the channels open and close, the whole thing runs on wind-energy you never asked for.

Then water gathers everything. Condenses chaos into form. Like a seed taking shape in the womb—this is not metaphor, this is what happens right now in every cell of your body. You're being conceived continuously. Every moment, a new embryo. Every second, a new formation pressing against the weight of earth.

And here's where it hurts: the suffering starts immediately. Cold contact. Pressure. Burning. Scattering. The four flavors of embodiment. You think suffering is something that happens to you later, something you can avoid with enough money or enough retreat time? Suffering is built into the physics of having a body. The elements themselves press, burn, scatter. No one's doing this to you. This is just what matter does when it gathers into form.

But look further—deeper into the construction. Thirty-two channel-petals ripen. Within each: wisdom. Light. Wind's tone. Syllable. Light-mass. You carry Buddhadharma in your blood, in your marrow, in the very structure of your nervous system. Samantabhadra's body—you're wearing it right now. Self-arisen. No one made you this way. You just showed up already complete.

Then the cascade: channels generate body, body generates faculties, faculties generate limbs, limbs generate flesh-blood-heat-breath. Bones. Marrow. Fat. Skin. Lymph. Spittle. Tendons. Veins. Arteries. Sinews. Bindu. All-complete. All arising without a single decision on your part.

You think you chose any of this? You think you chose to have a nervous system? A liver? Thoughts?

The wind-mind gathers into four aspects and you call it "me."

Stop defending the construction. The builder never existed. What you are was never built.
