[14364-14378] Second wheel speech, throat enjoy. Third wheel mind, heart dharma. Fourth wheel quality, navel emanation. These wheels—have you looked for the axle? The axle is your own awareness. It has no location.

[14379-14385] Wheel's name, quality, location, channel, action. Five things explained. The explainer is the sixth. Do not forget the sixth.

[14386-14396] Enjoyment wheel throat-in speech produce, dharma wheel heart-in mind produce, quality wheel navel-in attachment aversion produce. Body speech mind three produced from wheels? No. Wheels are produced from grasping at body speech mind. Grasping itself is empty.

[14397-14402] Emanation wheel navel-in aggregates elements produce. Buddha-field appear, emanation send. All from a wheel at the navel? The navel is a concept. The wheel is a concept. You are not a concept.
