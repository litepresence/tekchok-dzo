[16601-16609] Listen! From the center of the eye's essence, generally the four lamps appear. Particularly, the empty bindu lamp with self-light appears. From that: "Eyes of beings unobscured by conditions, through the door called cakṣu, like the sun's mandala, self-light and rays, appear as self-possessions."

[16610-16618] Generally, from the right eye—distance-snare and prajna two. From the left—bindu and dharmadhatu two. At the Brahma aperture, awareness body lamp blazes in manner. From Jewel Garland: "Beings' path is the seeing door. That itself, right two, left two, center—lamp blazing manner dwells."

[16619-16620] Seventh, nature: From the nature of original kadag, clear light lhungrub bindu empty appears like a water-moon.

Dear practitioner! Do you see? Your own eyes are the lamps! Right eye, left eye—distance-snare, bindu—all are wisdom's display. Do not look outside for light. The light is what sees!

Emaho! Your eyes are the four lamps blazing!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
