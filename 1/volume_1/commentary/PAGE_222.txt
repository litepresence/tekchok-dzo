You who continue the empowerments! Lines 1-58 describe its secret—samaya, giving vows, entering mandala, offering mind-flower, complete entering showing deity-face, throwing flower, name empowerment. You enter and receive! But entering means commitment. Like entering a house—step across threshold.

Its utterly unelaborated external at lines 30-43—entering sravaka mandala, showing ground path, giving upper lower covers, bowl fan, discipline's edge, action distinction, indicating dependent arising, giving meditation, prophecy, entering bodhisattva mandala, generating mind, giving vows, holding distinction-mind. You enter many mandalas! But all lead to one. Like different roads to same city—destination matters.

Its internal empowerment at lines 45-53—entering kriya mandala, generating mind, holding vows, throwing flower, showing deity-face, name empowerment, prophecy, encouraging, emitting breath, conferring empowerment. You receive step by step! But each step is important. Like climbing stairs—each one brings you higher.

Likewise entering upa yoga at line 55—nine types each twenty-seven. You do twenty-seven! But twenty-seven are nine times three. Like combinations—same elements, different arrangements.
