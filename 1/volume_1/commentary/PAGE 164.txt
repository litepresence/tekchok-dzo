The first protector's emanation arranged sixty-four thousand great manifestations, benefiting disciples through nineteen hundred thousand buddhas. Samantabhadra, Vairocana, all the great ones arranging the realms.

The teaching shows Vairocana in the lotus heart, the thirteen petaled center of the jewel sky. The abode of all buddhas, the fields of all five families. Buddha's deeds, qualities, activities—the three kayas equal to space, beyond what even tenth-ground bodhisattvas can measure.

From Uttaratantra: the buddha realm, buddha awakening, buddha qualities, buddha activities—pure beings beyond thought. From Ratnaketu: sky pervades as much as kāya pervades, as much as light pervades, as much as speech pervades. Everything interpenetrating everything else.

Now the second point: liberation outcomes.

In Jambudvipa, this secret great definite teaching liberates countless ḍākinīs beyond number, non-human beings. Here, among humans—males, females, ordained ones—liberation happens in this life or in the bardo.

The Great Arrangement speaks: "Listen, fortunate monk Pal! I will not abide here. Within sixty years, one thousand one will attain liberation. All arising in self-release. Half in monk form, half as bodhisattvas. Then within fifty years, two hundred thousand will obtain birthless liberation. Mostly women. One thousand two hundred men."

Then: "Within thirty years, six hundred thousand will be liberated. Mostly men, one hundred thousand women. All arising in self-release."

Those were my former retinue, attaining buddhahood even in degenerate times. The definite secret essence, when gathered, brings definite result. Other teachings don't bring this result.

If you encounter other teachings where a manifest buddha appears, meet this one as you would meet that.

Here's the point: all results gather in the heart of this teaching. This is what's being offered to you.

Numbers. Outcomes. Certainty.

This teaching doesn't leave liberation to chance. It specifies who will be liberated, when, how many. This isn't arrogance—it's confidence. The teaching knows what it does.

Ordained or lay, male or female—it doesn't matter. What matters is encountering this teaching, receiving it, holding it. The liberation numbers will be filled. The question is: will you be one of them?

Sixty years, fifty years, thirty years—the teaching specifies. Time is short. The retinue is gathering. Will you join them?

No more waiting. No more hesitating. The numbers are being counted. Your name could be among them.
