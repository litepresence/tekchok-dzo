[696-742] The cosmological description continues, explaining how the three realms (desire, form, formless) arise and support each other. From Pearl Garland's tantra, the mechanics of world-formation are described—wind supporting water, water supporting earth, the process of gathering, contracting, pulling, and lifting. This traditional cosmology describes how worlds come into being through the interaction of elements.

But again, don't mistake this for geology! It's describing the structure of experience. The "formless khams arisen from that"—the formless realm arises when consciousness exists without the support of form. The three realms (desire, form, formless) support each other, and from them arise the pure abodes and other realms.

The description of the fortunate aeon's first humans is telling: possessing form and beauty marks, body pervaded by own-light radiance, living eighty-thousand years, without male and female faculties. This describes the original state of beings before the fall into duality. The "delusion's cause two"—the arising of dualistic perception—led to the gradual coarsening of experience, the arising of faculties and gates, the decrease of light, the exhaustion of merit.

[743-756] Then beings began to eat earth-oil, then rice, and so forth—food becoming coarser as perception becomes more dualistic. This is the traditional Buddhist account of the decline of the world-age. But in Dzogchen, none of this is ultimate truth. It's all the play of awareness. The fall into duality, the decline of the age, the coarsening of experience—it's all part of the display. And it can all be recognized as such, right now.

The important point: whether in the golden age with eighty-thousand year lifespans or in our current age with all its problems, the nature of awareness never changes. Recognition is equally available in all times and circumstances. The outer conditions don't determine your capacity for awakening. Your recognition does.
