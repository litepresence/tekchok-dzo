PAGE 52 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa continues through the detailed exposition of vehicles and views, and you must not get lost in the complexity! The Sautrantika and Vaibhasika schools [2526-2597] may seem like ancient history, but their debates live in your own mind.

The Vaibhasikas hold to dust-atoms, partless particles that compose reality [2549]. Do you not also seek the fundamental building blocks? The irreducible truth? The final answer? This is the Vaibhasika tendency in you—wanting to reduce everything to smallest units, to analyze until you find what is truly real.

The Sautrantikas go further, seeing even atoms as conceptual imputations [2580]. They emphasize the stream of consciousness, the flow of moments. You experience this in meditation—thoughts as moments, sensations as flickering, reality as a movie rather than solid objects. But still they grasp at the moments themselves as real.

Both schools practice the four truths and the twelve links [2549, 2710-2781]. They meditate on impurity, on skeletons, on the eight unpleasant objects [2669-2781]—all to break attachment. And these methods work! When you truly see the body as impermanent, as impure, as suffering, attachment loosens.

But here is the limitation: they still grasp at the antidote. They think "I am meditating on impurity." They establish a subject, an object, and an action. This subtle grasping keeps them from full liberation. The rhinoceros-like self-enlightened ones realize half the dharma-selflessness—the outer grasping of atoms is empty—but they do not realize the inner grasping of the antidote itself is also empty [2731-2733].

The crow-like self-enlightened ones meditate on dependent arising in reverse [2742], going to charnel grounds and contemplating how corpses arise from death, from birth, from existence, back to ignorance. This is powerful practice! But still, they teach through signs, not words, and their realization remains partial.

You who read this—do not be satisfied with partial! Do not stop at breaking attachment to outer things while still grasping at inner mind. Go all the way. See that even the one who meditates is unfindable. Then meditation and non-meditation, path and non-path, are both liberated in the same recognition.
