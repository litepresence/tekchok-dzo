COMMENTARY ON PAGE 89 - Patrul Rinpoche

You who meditate on the generation stage—understand this! Lines 3384-3398: From the two upadeśas, accomplishing through the svātma upadeśa with mind as main and branches, accomplishing through the maṇḍala upadeśa with entry into mandala. The essence of these: Only conventional, in the correct conventional time, looking at the outer container world palace, looking at the mandala of supporting sentient beings as deities and goddesses. Seeing all beings as forms of deities and goddesses.

This is the vision of Mahāyoga! You look at the world—this very world, right here—and you see it as the palace of the deity. You look at beings—all these beings around you—and you see them as deities and dakinis. Is this madness? No! This is the recognition of the true nature of reality.

What you normally see as ordinary, impure world is merely your own obscured perception. Like a cataract patient seeing hair falling—there are no hairs, only the disease. Your impure vision is the disease; the pure vision is the cure.

Lines 3400-3411: In ultimate truth, no deity exists, no entities or signs. Only conventionally purifying aggregates and elements, dwelling in the mandala of deities and goddesses. The five aggregates, the five elements, the five objects, the five faculties—purifying the five afflictions, etc. Purifying meaning upon the pure expanse of basis nature.

Do you see the subtle point? Conventionally, you purify—aggregates become deities, elements become goddesses, afflictions become wisdoms. But ultimately, nothing was ever impure! The purification is a method, a path, a skillful means. The truth is that everything has always been pure from the beginning.

The three samayas, lines 3441-3448: Abandoning the killing of life through the body door, stealing and sexual misconduct, abandoning lies and slander through the speech door, harsh speech and idle talk, abandoning covetousness and harmful intent through the mind door, completely abandoning wrong view. Realizing means and wisdom as non-separate.

These are the root samayas. But understand: in the ultimate sense, there is no abandonment because there has never been impurity. You are not making something impure into something pure. You are recognizing that it was always pure. This is the difference between the gradual path and the instantaneous recognition.

The established view of mahā, lines 3414-3419: The door of entry is the three concentrations. The view of realization: Whatever appears, realize as deity. The root samaya: Body, speech, mind. The result: Means and wisdom, not separate.

Whatever appears, realize as deity! This is the heart instruction. When you see a form, it is the deity's form. When you hear a sound, it is the deity's mantra. When a thought arises, it is the deity's wisdom. Not eventually, after transformation—but right now, directly, immediately!

Why do you wait? Why do you think "after I complete my practice, then I will see..." No! See now! This very perception, if recognized, is the mandala. This very awareness, if acknowledged, is the deity. This very moment, if understood, is the great perfection.
