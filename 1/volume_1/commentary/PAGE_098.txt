You who would enter the path of instruction—listen! Lines 3859-3864: The section distinguishing the threefold teaching—the supreme complete teaching of the path that is distinctive—is: The essential point of the path is the essential point of entering the essence, like a spark striking flint. This is divided into three: Taught in the manner of oral transmission; Taught in the manner of symbolic instruction; Taught in the manner of self-arisen tantric scripture.

The Instruction Category (Man Ngag Sde) is the pinnacle of Atiyoga. Three ways of teaching: oral transmission, symbolic instruction, self-arisen tantric scripture. Like a spark striking flint—instantaneous, direct, no gradual process.

Among these, the essence of oral transmission, lines 3866-3869: The path of action, beyond the intellect, is practiced. The division: The instruction that cuts the extremes of fixation; The two instructions that manifest the confidence of liberation and the purity of means.

The first, lines 3871-3877: At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, without relying—when distinguishing from the basis. Even the mere word of elaboration is not established. The elaboration of designation does not exist. In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter—so it is said. Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted. The ultimate meaning of cessation.

All-pervasive emptiness—not emptiness as a thing, but emptiness as the nature of all things. The path of everything rolling—manifestation appearing without reliance, without basis. Not even the word of elaboration is established. No designation. Dharmata has no letters, no words. Through actionlessness, cyclic existence is exhausted. This is the ultimate cessation—not achieved, but recognized as always present.

The second, lines 3878-3882: From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur. At the time of the three kāyas appearing on the path, whatever is not liberated does not exist. At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.

Transformation in mind does not occur—you do not need to change your mind into something else. The three kayas appear on the path, and whatever is not liberated does not exist! This is the key: nothing needs liberation because nothing was ever bound.

The essence of symbolic instruction, lines 3883-3886: Non-deluded, thought-free. Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping. Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping. When divided, there are two: The oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness; The oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.

Non-deluded, thought-free! This is the state of symbolic instruction. Not deluded by appearances, yet free from conceptual thought. Thought-construction's grasping ceases. Non-dual, free from grasping at essence.

The first, lines 3889-3892: Through the vital-point wind abiding in the channels, the mind's own diligence through instruction—from the very source of dharmatā, the activity of averting harm. Through that spreading, the essential point of severing the debate between buddhas and sentient beings. Through the wind vital-point descending into the body, the essential point of severing the connection between body and mind. Through the root wind exhausted in the extreme, the essential point of arising's self-liberation.

Working with the winds and channels—this is the subtle body practice. But understand: these are skillful means, methods to bring you to recognition. The essential point is always the same: self-liberation of arising, severing of artificial distinctions.
