Fourth: letters' abode and enjoyment explained (line 83). Prefix and branch all-complete time (line 85).

Explained now the not-circulating portion of the first root-letter's mother (line 1). That prefix which has arisen up to that point is the abodes beyond nirvāṇa (line 3). When expressing, that vowel should be joined to that prefix and recited together (line 5).

The nature of letters and the prefix branches are the abodes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa (line 7). The prefixes and branches also arise as the enjoyment of the consort letters (line 9).

There the consort's above existing prefix's letters are the GU GU light letters: GRENG BU, the path. NA RO, the sphere. KLAD KOR, the dharmatā letters. Thus the four existing above are called the lamp letters (lines 11-19).

The four lamps arise from the eyes in the upper head of the body, like [images] in a mirror (line 20). The prefix below is the basis letter. The YA-tagged is the pervading letter. The RA-tagged is the arising letter. The foot-hook is the compassion letter. These also arise from self-arisen [wisdom] (lines 21-31).

The abode and enjoyment of letters should be known thus for all (line 33).

There the prefixes and branches: GU GU light letter explained. GRENG BU path letter explained. NA RO sphere letter explained. KLAD KOR dharmatā letter explained. Those four above letters are the lamp letters as accepted (lines 35-43).

Foot-hook compassion letter explained. YA-tagged pervading letter explained. RA-tagged arising letter explained (lines 45-49). There the prefix which has arisen is explained joined to the prefix. Thus it is spoken (lines 51-51).

These letters in such collections are symbols (line 53). Like when many threads are tied to many fingers of someone's many messages (lines 55-55). The meaning indicates the basis of dharmas, path and result, sphere, wisdom, and so forth of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa (lines 57-57).

The fifth shows two expression manners of those (line 59). The abode and expression manner are shown generally, and the near-sound expression is explained in particular (lines 61-63). The first two: the common abode's arrangement and... (lines 65-65).

Listen carefully! The letters are not just for recitation. They are symbols, like threads carrying messages. Each letter, each prefix, each branch points to aspects of reality—basis, path, result, sphere, wisdom, samsara, nirvana.

The four above letters are the lamp letters—GU GU (light), GRENG BU (path), NA RO (sphere), KLAD KOR (dharmata). These are the four lamps that arise from the eyes, like images in a mirror. Do you see? The visual experience is not separate from the letters. The light you see is the light letter. The path you walk is the path letter.

And the three below—the YA-tagged pervading letter, RA-tagged arising letter, foot-hook compassion letter. These are the active principles. Pervading everywhere, arising spontaneously, expressing compassion.

The letters are the structure of your being. Not something to be learned intellectually, but to be recognized in direct experience. When you see light, recognize it as GU GU. When you walk the path, recognize it as GRENG BU. This is not superstition. This is the recognition that all experience is sacred, all appearance is letter, all sound is mantra.
