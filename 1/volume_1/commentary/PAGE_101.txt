COMMENTARY ON PAGE 101 - Patrul Rinpoche

You who would understand self-clarifying explanation—listen! Lines 3972-3974: The fourth: the essence of self-clarifying explanation—word-attachment's stream is cut, the established view does not dwell, the establishment is specially supreme. Self-nature not perceived, completely pure, primordial purity's dharmatā that arises directionlessly—so it is called. Characteristic not mind, self-pure movement, without done to the basis—so it is called.

Word-attachment's stream is cut—no more clinging to concepts, to names, to descriptions. The established view does not dwell—you don't settle into any position, any view. Self-nature not perceived—you cannot perceive it because it is the perceiver! Completely pure, primordially pure—never stained, never changed.

Characteristic not mind—it is not what you think of as "mind." Self-pure movement—moving spontaneously, without someone doing the moving. Without done to the basis—the basis is not acted upon, not modified, not achieved.

That divided, there are three, lines 3975-3976: Speaking in the manner of error's messenger... [text continues]

You who would receive the ear lineage—attend! Lines 4005-4009: Self-nature without multiplicity—dharmatā beyond the words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading. Characteristic: pointed out, the cord of confidence is cut. That divided, there are two: The ear lineage and The explanation lineage.

Self-nature without multiplicity—only one, not many. Dharmata beyond all conceptual elaboration—cannot be captured in words. All-pervading—present everywhere, in everything. The cord of confidence is cut—not that you lose confidence, but that the artificial confidence based on concepts falls away. True confidence is beyond proof or disproof.

The essence of the ear lineage, lines 4010-4014: Connected one-to-one, especially near itself. That too: self-nature connected to the ear faculty, without interruption by others. Characteristic: without wavering, with confidence and the certainty of liberation. Divided into many: with syllables and without syllables—the ear lineage of dharmatā's meaning and instruction.

Connected one-to-one—direct transmission from teacher to student. Especially near itself—the teaching is not about something far away; it is about your own nature, closest to you. Without interruption by others—direct, immediate. Without wavering—stable, certain.

With syllables and without syllables—some teachings use words, some go beyond words. Both are the ear lineage. Do not think only silent meditation is the truth. Words can point; silence can reveal. Both are necessary, both are methods.

The essence of the explanation lineage, lines 4015-4019: Dharmatā without action, without cause, without basis to reverse the three realms. Self-nature: Clear light without stain, knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms. Characteristic: beyond thought and investigation, dwelling in the intention of the three bodies possessing the five wisdoms.

Dharmata without action—you don't do anything to it. Without cause—it is not produced. Without basis to reverse the three realms—you don't need to reject samsara to realize it. Clear light without stain—your nature is luminous, pure. Knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms—this clear light is not blank; it knows, it discerns, it is wisdom.

Beyond thought and investigation—you cannot think your way to it. Dwelling in the intention of the three kayas possessing the five wisdoms—the natural state is already complete with all qualities. You don't add them; you recognize them.
