PAGE 65 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa continues his relentless catalog of wrong views [2335-2376], and you must feel the urgency! Every view described here is a trap, and you are caught in many of them.

Those who "declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed, primordial wisdom severed" [2350]—this is nihilism disguised as Dzogchen! They hear that all is empty and conclude that nothing matters. They learn that the nature of mind is beyond cause and effect and decide that actions have no consequences. This is worse than the eternalist views! At least the eternalists believe in virtue.

"Buddha nonexistent" [2356]—when you say this, do you understand what you are saying? If Buddha nature is nonexistent, why practice? If awakening is impossible, why bother? This is not the teaching of emptiness; this is the denial of the Buddha's own attainment.

Those severed while abiding on the path who "declare the effect definitely severed" [2356]—these are practitioners who have fallen into despair. They practiced, they tried, they did not get the results they wanted, so they conclude liberation is impossible. Do not become one of these!

"Severance is emptiness—you are severed, I am severed—therefore nothing exists" [2356]—this is the worst kind of pseudo-wisdom! Taking the profound teaching of emptiness and turning it into an excuse for laziness, for immorality, for giving up.

The knowers who speak secretly [2359]—"Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent. Slight parts exist, suitable for appearance to faculties"—these are not realized beings! They are intellectuals playing with concepts. They construct elaborate philosophies that satisfy the mind but do not transform the heart.

And the tirthikas who deviate [2364-2376]—those who think all is magic, those who say anger finishes spirits, those who say the mind is self-arisen and uncorrectable, those who say meditating on deity-body is sufficient. Each of these is a deviation you might fall into! The one who thinks practice doesn't matter because "all is illusion." The one who justifies anger as "wrathful activity." The one who believes they are already enlightened so no correction is needed.

Beware! The path is narrow. The deviations are countless. At every step, ego finds a way to co-opt the teaching. Your job is not to avoid all these views—impossible! Your job is to recognize the one who holds views, the one who deviates, and see that it too is empty. Then all views are simultaneously liberated.
