Longchenpa details the Vaibhasika and Sautrantika views [2549-2597], and you must appreciate their rigor! These are not primitive philosophies to be dismissed—they are sophisticated attempts to understand reality, and they contain important insights.

The Vaibhasikas accept partless dust-atoms and partless instants [2549]—the fundamental building blocks of reality. They analyze the person and find no self in the aggregates, elements, or sense-bases. This is a huge accomplishment! Most beings never question the self at all. The Vaibhasikas use analysis to see through the gross illusion of a permanent, unitary, independent self.

Yet they stop there. They accept dharma-self—the atoms, the moments, the dharmas themselves—as real. This is like cleaning one room while leaving another dirty. They have seen through the person, but not through phenomena themselves. They still grasp at the building blocks of existence.

The Sautrantikas go further [2580]. They realize that even atoms are conceptual imputations, that the stream of consciousness is more fundamental than particles. They emphasize direct perception, the immediate knowing of objects. But they too stop short, grasping at the moments of consciousness themselves as real.

Both schools cultivate the four truths [2549]—understanding suffering, abandoning its origin, realizing cessation, practicing the path. They know the twelve links of dependent arising. They meditate on the three marks of existence: impermanence, suffering, and no-self. They are serious practitioners, not mere philosophers!

Their meditation methods are precise [2597]: cultivate selflessness and illusion as general antidote to the three poisons; cultivate impurity and skeletons for desire; cultivate love and dependent arising for anger; count breaths for conceptuality. These work! They actually reduce affliction, actually calm the mind, actually lead toward liberation.

But their limitation [2597]: they still grasp at the antidote. They think "I am meditating on emptiness." They establish a subject, an object, and an action. This subtle grasping keeps them from the full liberation of the Great Vehicle, where even emptiness is empty, even the path is pathless.
