From the Great Arrangement tantra: whoever holds this teaching easily masters all crafts, all arts, all treatises, all sounds. Know whatever they wish. The secret supreme unsurpassed teaching—when honored and praised, supreme and common accomplishments arise as wished.

Just carrying this teaching, holding the scriptures and oral instructions—these dispel the world's darkness like jewel light. The lamp illuminates all who see it. Those who encounter it are liberated. The fortunate ones attain buddhahood without doubt.

The third section: the types of persons who hold this teaching, explained in three categories. First, those with prophecy, whose liberation is certain.

The first among them: primordial Samantabhadra, the first king, who obtained clear light and arranged the Brahma-great upper fields. Vajradhara. Emanating in many other forms and names, arranging all of this. The blessing of other buddhas who arranged the Brahma-great eons—filling the sky's limit with numberless expressions beyond words.

Some abide. Some destroy. Some form and abide. All of this arranged by Vajradhara, the secret essence, the clear light eon. Sixty-four hundred thousand sequences for taming beings. Between these, other eons beyond number arise. The clear light essence explained here—this teaching has been present since the beginning, ripening countless beings.

This is the first teaching, arisen primordially. The secret essence that ripens beings without measure.

Then the second teaching: Śikhin, world-protecting buddhas.

Here's what this means: the teaching hasn't just appeared once. It's been arranged, held, transmitted across eons beyond counting. Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, all the great beings—they're not distant figures. They're aspects of the same transmission, the same blessing, the same teaching.

You're not starting from nothing. You're entering a stream that has flowed since the beginning of time. The holders before you number beyond measure. The fortunate ones who attained buddhahood—you're joining their company.

The question isn't whether you can do it. The question is whether you'll receive what's already being offered. The stream is flowing. Will you step into it?

This teaching, this transmission—it's been working for eons. It's worked before you. It'll work after you. Your only job: get out of the way and let it work.
