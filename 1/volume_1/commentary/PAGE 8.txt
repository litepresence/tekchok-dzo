[219-228] From the bindu of light—this bindu is the point of concentrated luminosity, like a spark or a drop of liquid light. It's the essence of awareness in its most concentrated form. From this, sixty complete perfections arise, countless Buddha-bodies appear, inexpressible and self-appearing. This is describing how the display unfolds from the nature of mind. It's not created; it's self-arisen. Like how a dream arises naturally from sleep, the entire universe of appearances arises naturally from awareness.

The tongue-faculty of the five-family Buddhas radiating light as the six syllables—this is the dimension of communication in the Sambhogakaya. In our ordinary experience, speech is sound that conveys meaning. In the Sambhogakaya, the very radiance of awareness IS the teaching. The light-rays are the words, and the meaning is immediate, not filtered through concepts.

From this state, Buddha Vairochana manifests with countless retinues—the Dharmata Samantabhadra's complete enjoyment gathering. Then the other Buddhas of the five families—Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi—each with their own mandalas, all blazing with the light of the Great Perfection. This is describing the five aspects of awareness when fully manifest. Each Buddha represents a different facet of enlightened nature, but they're all expressions of the same awareness.

[229-248] Now the text names Vairochana specifically as Gang-chen-mtsho, "Great Ocean of the Ganges," who became lord of all mandalas. His body, speech, and mind are without fabrication—the precious teaching's state unmoving. The lists that follow (non-arising, non-abiding, non-taking, non-rejecting, non-moving) are all negations. This is crucial! Dzogchen uses negation to point beyond all conceptual categories. The nature of mind doesn't arise (it's not born), doesn't abide (it doesn't stay in one state), doesn't take or reject (it's beyond acceptance and rejection), doesn't move (it's not subject to change).

The description of the tamer of those not to be tamed, with retinue assembly countless, radiating from body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities—this is the dimension of enlightened manifestation. "Thus all appearances—upper and lower, ten directions' worlds—not being, all completely pure, dense arrangement, blissful field, self-appearance completely pure, self-arisen Buddha-field clearly became." This is it! All appearances are the pure field. Your world right now is the Buddha-field. You just don't see it because you're looking through the filter of grasping and aversion.
