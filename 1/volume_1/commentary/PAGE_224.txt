[9141-9149] Listen, dear one! The secret mandala entry—three aspects: introducing awareness into expanse through vital-point, pointing out expanse-awareness through deity recognition, making Buddha's heir through name empowerment. These three, plus the complete: outer prophecy through verses on sense-faculties and objects—experiencing non-dual knowledge and sphere; inner mind-clarity prophecy through verses—empowerment free from birthless recognition; secret entering without division—encouragement through verses showing non-dual expanse-awareness great bliss. Twelve in total!

Do you see? Each level peels back another layer of obscuration. Outer: sense and object dissolve. Inner: mind's clarity reveals no birth. Secret: expanse and awareness were never two!

[9150-9169] The very-without-elaboration's outer: suitable entry, suitable attainment—two. Inner: certain conduct, certain view—four. Secret: race distinction, self-abiding—six. Complete: cause and condition—eight. The completely-without-elaboration's outer: mind abiding, speech abiding—two. Inner: speech transformed, mind attained—four. Secret: bliss prophesied, secret released—six. Complete: dwelling in manifestation, own action attained—eight. Thus without-elaboration's with-elaboration: sixteen. Its without-elaboration: twelve, making twenty-eight. Its very-without-elaboration: eight, thirty-six. Its completely-without-elaboration: eight.

[9170] Through empowerment, attained result: sixty-four! Listen, practitioner—all these numbers are fingers pointing at the moon. Don't count the fingers! Look at what they indicate: your own nature, already perfect, never stained. Emaho!
