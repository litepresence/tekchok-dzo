[15649-15668] Listen here, dear practitioner! The fire channel-wind causes steaming, and from this ripening come the changes of bodhicitta—contracting, dripping, scattering, drawing. These four create impotence in men, constant numbness, untimely seed emission, and dysfunction with objects. In women, menstrual blood not descending becomes disease, untimely emission, or monthly occasional emission. When the second and third days of the waxing moon see stainless menstrual emission, this benefits male children. When it descends at the fifteenth lunar mandala and so on, this benefits females. When it constantly descends in the waning moon, both male and female children ripen as twins. If menstrual flow is heavy with much blood, or constantly flows on the twenty-second or fifth, no children will arise at all!

[15668-15686] The earth wind generates faculties and faculty-supports, producing much karma and conception. The wind fire creates awareness-power—light, heavy, blazing, roaring, full, and empty. The wind wind moves breath outside and inside. In women when sons and daughters are conceived, it creates eye disease; in men, it creates alcohol disease. The water of wind stops conception and makes non-conception. The earth wind draws and gathers the limbs. The fire wind makes affliction-power various. When wind wind and fire mix, they create various wisdom-powers—marvelous example discrimination, skill in dharma word-meaning, skill in cooking for women, and skill in body-speech transformations. The birth order of four elements changes through the actions of summer, winter, autumn, and spring—the element ranks shift, creating disease!

Emaho! See how the elements dance in your very body!
