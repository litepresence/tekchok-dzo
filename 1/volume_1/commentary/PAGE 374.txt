[15649-15670] Trembling movement, paralysis, fire nadi wind vaporized, scent-water variety. Thickening coagulating scattering drawing, sense-organ rising not, numb, seed flows. Fire wind defilement power, wind wind breath moving, female liver-disease, male chang-disease. Earth wind limb extending, fire wind defilement.

[15671-15686] Wind water thought ceasing non-thought, wind fire mixed discriminating-wisdom, example distinguishing wonder. Elements four birth sequence, summer autumn spring winter, elements sequence shifts, disease hot death. Body speech mind action differences show.

The differences are no differences. The no-differences is your own face before the seasons were born.
