COMMENTARY ON PAGE 125

Longchenpa now shows us why these eight sections are necessary. Listen carefully, you who think you can skip steps! (lines 1-67)

The tantra sequence is explained (lines 29-45)—two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence. Like the trunk of a tree. Two explanatory tantras explain as leaves spreading. Two limb tantras explain like planets and stars arising from oceans. Two scripture-logic tantras explain like flowers opening. Four upadesha tantras explain as ripening results. Three intention tantras explain as seeing the peak. Two entering tantras explain as mindful basis and heart. Expert ritual tantras explain like a dog that does the messenger's work.

What does this mean for you? It means the teachings have structure, like a body has structure. You cannot have a head without a body, you cannot have realization without foundation.

The reasons for establishing eight sections (lines 49-66)—if the two root tantras are lacking, like a trunk with rotten roots, branches cannot arise. You see? Without understanding the root nature of mind, all other practices are like painting flowers on a rock. Beautiful, but without life.

If the two explanatory tantras are lacking, like no leaves from that—no flowers arise. Without understanding how phenomena spread from the root, you cannot recognize their display.

If the two limb tantras are lacking, like climbing a cliff without limbs—one falls. Without the supports of qualities and signs, you have nothing to hold onto in your practice.

If the two entering tantras are lacking, like a corpse without a heart—cannot benefit others. Without actually entering the path of self-liberation, you are dead to the dharma, no matter how much you know.

If the two scripture-logic tantras are lacking, if no flowers exist, results do not ripen in time. Without clear understanding, your practice bears no fruit.

If the four upadesha tantras are lacking, if no results, agriculture is meaningless. Without direct instruction, all your effort is wasted.

If the three intention tantras are lacking, like a person without eyes not knowing the way, unable to enter a city. Without seeing the actual nature, you wander blindly.

If the expert ritual tantra is lacking, like a watchdog gone, wealth lost to thieves. Without protection of the teachings, they are stolen by misunderstanding.

Thus, lacking those eight: the condition of the teachings is incomplete (line 15). If they exist, complete: appropriate and certain in eight (line 17). If more than that: not needed (line 19).

Do you hear this? Not needed! Beyond these eight, nothing more is required. Do not accumulate teachings like a merchant hoards goods. These eight are sufficient. The rest is elaboration.
