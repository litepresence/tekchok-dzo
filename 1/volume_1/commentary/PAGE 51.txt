PAGE 51 COMMENTARY

Now Longchenpa speaks of the Mind-Only school [2981-2995], and you must be careful here—this view is subtle and easily misunderstood! When the Cittamatras say "all is mind," they do not mean your personal mind, your thoughts and emotions, creates the world. They point to something vaster.

The example given: a jewel reflected in water [2984]. The jewel appears in the water, but is the jewel in the water? No. Does that mean there is no jewel? No. The appearance is real as appearance, but the jewel is not where it appears to be. So with all phenomena—they appear to be out there, independent, but their actual nature is the knowing in which they appear.

The debate about whether aspects and consciousness are one or different [2986-2998]—this is not mere philosophy. It strikes at how you experience reality right now! When you see a tree, is the tree separate from your seeing? Is the seeing separate from the tree? Can you have one without the other? Investigate this directly, not conceptually.

The Mind-Only view corrects the extreme of materialism—the belief that mind arises from matter, that consciousness is merely brain function. But it risks its own extreme: grasping at mind as truly existent, as the absolute foundation. This is why the Middle Way school goes further, showing that mind too is empty of inherent existence.

Yet do not dismiss Mind-Only! It is a necessary step. First you must see through the illusion of external matter. Then you must see through the illusion of internal mind. When both external and internal are seen through, what remains? Not nothing—rather, a knowing that is neither inside nor outside, neither mind nor matter, yet the basis of both.

This is why Longchenpa will move to the Middle Way view. But for now, rest in the recognition that all appearances are like reflections. They appear, they function, they have consequences. But they do not exist as they appear to exist. The tree you see is not a tree independent of seeing. The sound you hear is not a sound independent of hearing. And the one who sees and hears? Equally without independent existence.
