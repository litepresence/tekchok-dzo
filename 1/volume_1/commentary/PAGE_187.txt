You who study the channels! Lines 7661-7686 describe the root mandala great in detail—conch shell white, pure bindu, tiny light. You get lost in the descriptions! But these are simply the natural state of your own body. Like a house that stands whether you think about it or not, these mandalas are always present.

The three kayas mandala at lines 7680-7686—kaya, speech, mind, each center retinue with. You think these are separate? They are one essence displaying as three. Like a single face showing different expressions—laughing, crying, angry—yet the face remains one.

Lines 7688-7710 speak of reflection mandala great—sand mandala, peaceful, wrathful. You make these elaborate constructions! But the real mandala cannot be constructed or destroyed. Like the sky cannot be painted and cannot be erased—where do you draw the sky?

Nature mandala great at lines 7719-7758—Akaniṣṭha, dharmadhātu palace, Vairocana center. You imagine this as somewhere far away! But Akaniṣṭha is your own head, the palace is your own brain, the deities are your own energies. Like finding out the treasure map points to your own home—you've been sitting on it all along!

The peaceful forms at lines 7743-7768—standing, sitting, father, mother, mudra, samadhi. These are the natural display of awareness. Like a fountain displaying various water patterns—the water is one, the patterns many.

Lines 7759-7763 describe ornaments—head-ornament five-five, shoulder, throat, hand, foot. You think these are decorations! They are the channels, the chakras, the bindus of your own body. Like a city with its roads and intersections—this is your own energy system.

Colors at lines 7766-7770—dark-blue center, east white, south yellow, west red, north green. You memorize these! But they are simply the natural radiance of the elements in your own body. Like a rainbow appearing in the sky—beautiful, yet empty.
