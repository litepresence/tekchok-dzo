Now we come to the lower realms—the hells, pretas, animals. You read of hot hells and cold hells, of yama-soothed tortures and bubble-possessing sufferings. Your intellect may recoil, or it may become fascinated with the descriptions. But listen closely, you who would be free.

Where are these hells? Twenty thousand leagues below Mount Meru, the text says. But look at your own mind when anger arises—where is that anger located? Is it not burning you right now? Is it not a hot hell, immediate and intense? When you are consumed by hatred, you are in Yama's realm. When you are frozen by jealousy, you are in the cold hells. The text describes these as lasting for eons, but have you not experienced moments that seemed like eons when you were in the grip of rage?

The hells are not punishments imposed by an external deity. They are the natural results of the mind's poisons. Anger produces the experience of burning. Attachment produces the experience of hunger—this is the preta realm, where beings have mouths the size of needles and stomachs like mountains, never satisfied. Delusion produces the experience of blind suffering—this is the animal realm, where beings act on instinct without understanding.

You read of occasional hells, without definite location, existing variously in earth, water, fire, wind. These are the sudden bursts of suffering that come upon you without warning—a sharp pain, a shocking loss, a moment of terror. They have no fixed abode because they arise from the unpredictability of your own karma.

The demigods, asuras, dwelling in the hollow space below Meru's water-level—you picture them gazing up at the gods' paradise, consumed with jealousy. But look at your own mind when you see another's success. Do you not dwell in that same hollow space, looking up at what others have, resenting your own position? The demigods' constant war with the gods is your own envy, your own competitiveness, your inability to rejoice in others' virtue.

The gods on Meru's tiers, with their cities and pleasure-groves—you may think this sounds pleasant. But listen: the gods are those moments when you experience temporary pleasure, success, or meditative bliss, and you think "this is it, this is liberation." You dwell in your pleasure-grove, intoxicated by your own accomplishments. But you are still on Mount Meru. You have not transcended the world-system. You have only risen to a higher tier. And from that height, the fall is further.

The text mentions the great yaksha kings—Golden-foot, Powerful, Entering-existence, Glory Splendor, Mountain-raising, Supreme-existence. These are the great successes of worldly life, the achievements that make you feel powerful and glorious. But they are still yakshas—nature spirits, powerful but bound. They send disease and famine when their domains are threatened. Your worldly success, when clung to, becomes the cause of your suffering.

Do not seek to be born among the gods. Do not fear the hells. Recognize that all realms are mind. When anger arises, recognize its nature, and the hot hell is instantly cool. When craving arises, see its emptiness, and the preta finds food. When delusion arises, know it as wisdom, and the animal awakens. The transformation does not happen in some future life. It happens now, in the recognition of what is.
