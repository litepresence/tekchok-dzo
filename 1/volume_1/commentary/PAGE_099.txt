You who would receive the oral transmission—attend! Lines 3894-3896: Through the vast expanse's aspect—never departing anywhere—the pervasion and estimation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Through essence-grasping being free in dharmadhātu's emptiness, the estimation of phenomena's transformation. Through non-fabrication in the expanse, that-which-is-called self-arisen wisdom.

The vast expanse—never departing anywhere. Samsara and nirvana pervade it, are estimated within it, but the expanse itself never moves. Essence-grasping freed in dharmadhatu's emptiness—when you stop grasping at essences, phenomena transform naturally. Through non-fabrication, self-arisen wisdom shines forth.

The essence of the self-arising tantra's instruction, lines 3897-3901: All commands' source is clear in the arising ground. The unique is cut by the axe of distinctive knowing. Through non-duality in self-nature, the cessation of saṃsāra's reliance. Through characteristic not established as words or letters, emptiness is free from the ground of dispute.

All commands' source—clear in the arising ground. Your own awareness is the source of all instructions. Cut by the axe of distinctive knowing—this knowing that knows without grasping. Non-duality in self-nature—samsara's reliance ceases.

When divided, there are four, lines 3902-3906: Commanded in the manner of view's thorough investigation; Commanded in the manner of removing obscurations; Commanded in the manner of bringing forth the hidden to manifestation; Commanded in the manner of self-clarifying explanation.

The first, lines 3908-3911: Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground. Action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation. Through self-nature's emptiness arising in all aspects—action, virtue, and non-virtue not abandoned—buddhas and sentient beings do not exist. Through characteristic not established as words or letters, the dharma of all vehicles—through non-transcendence—is the essential point of the single sovereign's path.

Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground—this is your nature, free from all elaboration. Action free from good and bad—not that you become immoral, but that you see through the duality of moral and immoral. Virtue and non-virtue not abandoned—you don't reject them; they self-liberate in their own place. Buddhas and sentient beings do not exist as separate entities!

When divided, lines 3912-3913: The view clinging to appearance and concept—non-arising; The investigation of mind's realization—all doubts released—these are two.

The view clinging to appearance and concept is non-arising—when you look for it, it cannot be found. The investigation of mind's realization releases all doubts. Do not be satisfied with partial understanding. Investigate until doubt is exhausted!
