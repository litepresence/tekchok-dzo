Listen! The lineage of vidyadharas! From Buddha's nirvana, the teaching passed to Uddiyana—Vajra He, Manjushripati, Shri Simha, Jnana Sutra, and on through the ages. Each holder maintaining the essence, each adding their blessing.

And notice—the teaching flourishes for a time, then does not abide in one place. It moves! From India to Tibet, from master to disciple, like a lamp passed from hand to hand. The life-ten time—our time—this is when it flourishes most!

Our master, the supreme monk Pal, and Kumārarāja—these are the emanations of Vimalamitra himself! The prophecy is clear. The teaching is here, now, in this very text you hold. Do not take it lightly! This is the direct lineage from Samantabhadra, through Vajradhara, through all the buddhas, to you.
