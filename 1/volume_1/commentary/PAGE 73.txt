Longchenpa continues with the hearer vehicle's meditation methods [2632-2669], and you must apply these! The Vaibhasika's view: aggregates, realms, sense-bases analyzed into dust atoms [2632]. This is not mere theory—it is a meditation instruction. Sit and break down your experience into smallest parts. Where is the "you" in all these parts?

The Sautrantika's view [2639]: recitation, hearing, contemplation, meditation—the three wisdoms cultivated. First you hear the teaching, then you think about it, then you meditate on it. This is the natural progression! Do not try to meditate on what you have not understood. Do not contemplate what you have not heard.

The four fruits obtained through fourfold contemplation [2669]: stream-entry, once-returner, non-returner, foe-destroyer. These correspond to meditating on cessation, origination, and the path. When you truly see that suffering can cease, you enter the stream. When you understand the origin of suffering, you return only once more. When you walk the path excellently, you become a foe-destroyer.

But what is this meditation on cessation [2647]? Entering the non-attached abode, first becoming accustomed to food free from concepts. This means letting go of attachment even to sustenance! Then samadhi, non-concept, single-pointed. This is the progression: first simplify outer conditions, then simplify the mind.

The meditation on desire's antidote [2669]: visualizing a white thumb-sized skeleton on your forehead mandala, accumulating white light-rays. This is tantra entering the sutra path! Working with channels, with visualization, with light. Then expanding—head, body, surroundings, whatever appears—all as white skeletons, three thousand of them. This shatters attachment to the body as beautiful, as desirable, as "mine."

And the meditation on delusion [2669]: red fire at the crown, clear and bright. Fire transforms, fire purifies, fire burns away confusion. Through this meditation, knowledge becomes clear and bright; mind itself is realized as empty. Delusion dissolves not by analysis alone, but by transformation through visualization and light.

These methods work! They have liberated countless beings. Do not dismiss them as "Hinayana" or "inferior." Practice them sincerely, and you will see results. Then, having tasted liberation, you can go further to the Mahayana, carrying your realization like a lamp to light the way for others.
