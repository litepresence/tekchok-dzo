[299-307] The text continues describing the activities of the enjoyment-complete body, or Sambhogakaya. Notice the phrase "Those also not the activity of meaning's agent, but called 'activity' through the arising of qualities' essence and radiance." This is crucial! The enlightened activities aren't something being done by someone. There's no agent, no doer. The activities are the natural radiance of awareness itself. Like how light naturally illuminates without a decision to do so, the qualities of enlightenment naturally manifest without anyone making them happen.

From the play of unobstructed radiance—the former appearances and the arising of compassion—the pure abodes are densely arranged. This is describing how the pure lands manifest. They're not somewhere else you go after you die. They're the dimension of richness that opens when awareness recognizes itself. From the gesture of the great ocean's teacher, from the lotus-pericarp's base, thirty-two realms appear with layered masses, varied colors and forms like water and moon. This is describing the mandala structure—not as a physical place, but as the architecture of awakened perception.

[308-316] The text describes various arrangements—like palace arrangements, like descending offering-feast houses, like infinite jewel-umbrella arrangements, like mutual grain-pile masses. Don't get lost in the imagery! These are descriptions of how the display of awareness organizes itself. The key point is that all of this is "self-appearing"—it appears naturally from the nature of awareness, not created by anyone.

From all pores of hair-light, radiating into space—infinite enumerable variety of realms and teachers, boundless, measureless, infinite. This is the fractal nature of reality. Every point contains infinite worlds. Every moment contains infinite Buddhas. Your own body, right now, has countless realms within it. You just don't perceive them because your perception is filtered through ordinary dualistic mind.

[317-322] "Thus in enjoyment-body's realm: teaching actual, speech self-arisen syllables whoever not made, yet all teaching's sons and simultaneous appearances those abide—at the time of unchanging dharmatā." This is describing the dimension of communication in the Sambhogakaya. The teachings aren't spoken words; they're the natural expression of dharmata itself. The syllables are self-arisen—not created, not manufactured. And all the beings who appear there abide simultaneously in the unchanging nature of reality.
