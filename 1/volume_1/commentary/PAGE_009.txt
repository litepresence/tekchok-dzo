[249-254] "From offering a vajra as basis for mind-generation arose this." The vajra offering represents the indestructible commitment to recognize one's nature. When that commitment is pure, the body appears without fixed nature—accumulation pure, mind's great wisdom knows all aspects. This is describing the result of the path. In the time of Dharmakaya, when place, dharmasphere, object, and thought are all pure, Samantabhadra's natural activities are perfectly accomplished and abide. This isn't something to achieve in the future. It's describing how things already are from the perspective of awareness.

[255-258] "Upon one particle of retinue, particles-number Buddhas countless, with teaching actual nature, dzogchen dharma-nature vajra whoever—uncompounded." This is the fractal nature of reality in Dzogchen view. Every particle contains infinite Buddhas. Every moment contains infinite teachings. The Dzogchen dharma-nature is uncompounded—meaning it's not made of parts, not created through causes and conditions. It's the natural state, always already present.

[259-298] Now comes detailed lists of the activities of body, speech, and mind—outer, inner, and secret. Don't skim over these as mere catalogues! Each category is pointing to a different dimension of how awareness functions when recognized.

Body's outer activities: unchanging, uncoming, ungoing, non-abiding. This is describing the Dharmakaya body—it's not subject to change, doesn't come from anywhere, doesn't go anywhere, doesn't abide in any fixed location. Inner activities: non-appearing, non-doing, non-radiating, non-gathering. This is subtler—the body of enjoyment doesn't appear in the ordinary sense, doesn't do things in the ordinary sense, doesn't radiate or gather in the way physical things do. Secret activities: clear-open, even, loose, direct. These are the qualities of awareness itself—openness without obstruction, evenness without preference, looseness without fixation, directness without mediation.

Speech follows the same pattern—outer: inexpressible, unshowable, unseeable, unslightable (cannot be dismissed or diminished). Inner: natural, passing, objectless, nonplural. Secret: fresh, innate, natural, unfabricated. Mind's activities are listed as various samadhis—stainless, lion-display, hero-going, wish-fulfilling jewel pinnacle, victory-banner peak play, lightning garland, great wheel, light-blazing. These aren't different meditation techniques to master! They're different ways of describing the natural stability of awareness when it recognizes itself.

The key point throughout all of this: these aren't achievements. They're descriptions of what is already the case. Your awareness right now has all of these qualities. You just don't recognize it because you're too busy looking for something else.
