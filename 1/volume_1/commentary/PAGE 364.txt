[15099-15125] Earth produce meat, space send mind, wisdom channel twenty-eight, discern prajna, gather essence, liberate wisdom. Mind channel ten, ignorance ten, hatred ten, desire five, delusion five. All these defilements—where is the defiler? The defiler is the defiled. The defiled is empty.

[15126-15182] Crown great-bliss wheel, awareness wisdom wind, karma gather blood consciousness. Fifty above go, fifty left go, fifty spoke located. Coiled time, disturbed time, located time, move time. Times for the timeless. The timeless has no wheel.

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
