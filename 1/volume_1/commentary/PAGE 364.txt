[15099-15108] Listen! Ten channels produce earth element flesh! Ten channels space send forth mind! Twenty-eight prajna channels! Nine discern, nine gather essence! Five liberate prajna! Five agitate! Ten mind channels—each dwells! One dwells as two!

[15109-15122] Ten ignorance channels! Two dwell root-ignorance! Two dwell confusion-ignorance! Two dwell fourfold-confusion-ignorance! Two dwell grasping-conception! Remainder each one! Twelve mind aspects—each mind two channels! Twenty-eight affliction channels! Ten dwell hatred! Five dwell desire! Five dwell delusion! Four dwell jealousy! Four dwell pride! Thus channels and winds...

Do you see, practitioner? Every poison has its channel! Hatred, desire, delusion—all mapped in your body! But who maps? No mapper! Just wisdom playing at being confusion! Cut through the map and find what was never lost! Emaho!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
