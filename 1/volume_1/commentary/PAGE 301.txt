Listen, you who wonder about existence! Lines [12500-12519] reveal the ground of appearing!

Existence called-as arise! Sentient-being-by-means-of form think-by-means-of not-imagine arise! Delusion path and thought also how think thought like thought arise!

That Vajrasattva awareness! Field Broad! First four! Place Beautiful! Basis appear spontaneous-by-means-of arise door! Time when destroyed!

Self ignorance other-as appear-by-means-of delusion-basis-by-means-of appearance! Pig year! Ignorance actual all-imagine time! Created sun!

Object appear coarse-as grasp-by-means-of thought clear part! Star Bird! Object attached desire-as arise! Old-one! Ignorance-by-means-of consciousness delusion-grasp-as arise!

Lineage not-determinate! Basis appear that where-also arise! Liberation delusion two both! Common ground be-from delusion to say!

Like a crystal that shows all colors but remains colorless itself! Like space that accommodates all forms but is never formed!

The basis is neither pure nor impure! It is the ground from which both arise! Do not cling to liberation! Do not fear delusion! Both are waves on the same ocean!

The six realms are your own face! The six poisons are wisdom's display! Do not reject! Do not accept! Simply recognize what already is!

Emaho! The ground that is no ground!
