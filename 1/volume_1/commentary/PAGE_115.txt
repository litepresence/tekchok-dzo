COMMENTARY ON PAGE 115 - Patrul Rinpoche

You who would understand the seventeen tantras—listen! Lines 4486-4497: From the single nature of basis-awareness, come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method. From nature: basis and essence. Three quintessences, though designated with five different names, are not beyond one meaning-essence. From that itself: From the distinction of the single basis's essence, are called method and nature tantra. Though they appear merely as designations, the essence: single basis, empty nature, are not different, have no variation.

From one basis-awareness, two tantras: indicated (what is pointed to) and indicating (the pointing). Basis and essence—not different. Three quintessences, five names—but all are one meaning, one essence. Single basis, empty nature—not different, no variation.

For example, a person, lines 4497-4500: If many names exist, however called, appears so, meaning unchanged, likewise.

Like a person called by many names—son, brother, father, friend. Different names, same person. Different tantras, same essence. Do not be confused by the variety. The essence is one.

Thus, lines 4501-4506: SECOND: THE WORD TANTRAS, EXPLAINED EXTENSIVELY. Three: Enumeration, Purpose, Order. Enumeration, Briefly Shown; Purpose, Explained Extensively; Order, Determined, Entered and Gathered.

Now the word tantras—how the teaching is expressed. Three aspects: enumeration (listing), purpose (why), order (how arranged).

First, lines 4507-4518: The self-arisen rigpa's tantra: shown deep and vast as an ocean of expressions. The vajra-sattva heart-mirror tantra: shown clear as the sun. The great dzogchen tantra of lion's power: shown overwhelming all lower vehicles. The glorious letterless tantra of the mountain-king: shown as the unchanging dharmatā. The beautiful-auspicious tantra of the wheel: shown cutting the wheel of delusion. The suddenly-sounding tantra of the key: shown opening all scriptural doors. The universal-goodness mind-mirror tantra of the sword: shown cutting wrong places. The blazing-lamp tantra: shown making the lamp's appearance empty yet bright. The jewel-spread tantra of gold-purity: shown as gold adorned with turquoise. The sun-and-moon-joining tantra of the mother-child connection: shown clearly indicating with faithful, definite words.

The seventeen tantras each have their unique flavor, their special emphasis. Self-arisen rigpa—deep and vast like an ocean. Vajrasattva heart-mirror—clear as the sun. Lion's power—overwhelming lower vehicles. Letterless—unchanging dharmata. Wheel—cutting delusion. Key—opening all doors. Sword—cutting wrong understanding. Blazing lamp—empty yet bright. Gold-purity—adorned with wisdom. Sun-and-moon—mother-child, clarity and emptiness united.

Lines 4517-4518: The introduction-adorning tantra of the mirror: shown applying meaning to the example of images within a mirror. The pearl-garland tantra: shown as instruction collected like a beautiful pearl garland.

Introduction-adorning—like a mirror reflecting images, showing how appearance and mind relate. Pearl-garland—instructions collected, beautiful, precious.

Each tantra is a door. Each tantra is a method. But all lead to the same place: recognition of your own nature. Do not prefer one over the other. Use them all as needed. Some days you need the sword to cut through delusion. Some days you need the lamp to illuminate the path. Some days you need the mirror to see your own face.

The tantras are not just ancient texts. They are alive, speaking to you now. Open them with devotion, practice them with diligence, realize them with confidence. This is the way of the Great Perfection.
