Now we come to Mount Meru, the cosmic mountain, rising like butter from churned milk. You picture a golden mountain, silver to the east, beryl south, ruby west, gold north—beautiful, yes? But listen carefully.

Where is Mount Meru in your own experience? It is your spine, practitioner. The central channel, avadhuti, rising from the pelvic floor to the crown of your head. The four sides? The four subtle channels that branch from it. The colors? The elements that flow through them. Do not think this is mere correspondence or symbolic fancy. The ancient yogis mapped the outer world from their inner experience. They discovered that the macrocosm and microcosm are not two.

The text describes tiers upon tiers—turquoise vajra tier, lotus tier, wheel tier, jewel light tier. These are the chakras, wheels of subtle energy in your body. The lower tier at the navel, the lotus at the heart, the wheel at the throat, the jewel at the crown. Each tier elevated, each more refined than the one below. As your meditation deepens, you ascend these tiers. The coarse winds settle, the subtle winds arise. The clear light dawns at the crown.

You read of seven mountains, seven lakes, and you picture a geography. But look at your own face—seven orifices. Look at your body—seven main chakras. The play-lakes where nagas dwell? The bindu drops in your channels. The naga kings who control rain? The energy currents that nourish your practice. Everything in this description has an inner dimension that is the true meaning.

The four continents—do you think they exist somewhere in space? East, south, west, north—they are the four directions of your awareness. Expanding, contracting, rising, settling. The shapes described—circular, square, semicircular, trapezoidal—these are the shapes your awareness takes in different states. When awareness expands infinitely, it is circular like Godaniya. When it is stable and grounded, it is square like Uttarakuru. When it wavers between two extremes, it is semicircular like Purvavideha. When it is broad at the base and narrow at the top, concentrated, it is Jambudvipa.

Jambudvipa, the southern continent where we dwell—you read this and feel confirmed in your location. But recognize: Jambudvipa is the state of awareness where beings have the greatest capacity for suffering and for liberation. It is not a geographical location. It is the human condition itself—precarious, perched between heaven and hell, capable of the greatest delusion and the greatest awakening. You are here, reading these words, because your awareness has taken this shape. Use it well.

The islands that accompany each continent—Deha and Videha, Kuru and Uttarakuru—these are the satellite states of mind, the secondary patterns that accompany your main delusion or realization. Do not grasp at the names. Look at your own mind's patterns. See how they cluster around central tendencies. This is the true meaning of the cosmology.
