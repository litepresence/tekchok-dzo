[163-175] Now Longchenpa quotes from the Sutra of Entering the Buddha Realm, and you need to understand what these comparisons are pointing to. The gods and humans of three-thousand worlds are "very few" compared to what a sage with clairvoyance can see. This isn't a census report! It's showing you how limited ordinary perception is. Your everyday awareness is like looking through a keyhole—you see a tiny slice of reality and think that's all there is.

The text builds up through different levels of perception—shravakas, bodhisattvas, meditators—each seeing more than the last. But the Tathagata's eye sees across all of it. What is this Tathagata's eye? It's not a physical eye. It's awareness itself when it recognizes its own nature. When rigpa knows itself, it sees without limits, without obstruction. "Wherever sky pervades, in those places sentient-beings pervade"—this is describing the boundless compassion and perception of awakened awareness.

[176-191] Longchenpa is now addressing a technical point about how tantras arose. Some people think different tantras came from different sources at different times. But the Magical Vairotsana tantra refutes this—the first Buddha is Vajradhara, "Buddha before all Buddhas." This isn't historical chronology; it's pointing to the primordial nature of awareness that has never not been enlightened. The "first" Buddha is the Dharmakaya itself—the nature of reality that was never born and never dies.

The text describes how Samantabhadra manifests through emanations, displaying as ordinary beings who generate bodhicitta and demonstrate Buddhahood. This is describing how the display of awareness functions. From the perspective of the absolute, there's no separation between Buddhas and beings. Buddhas appear in order to guide beings, but they're not different in essence from the beings they guide. It's all the play of awareness recognizing itself.

[180-191] The second section discusses Vajradhara's manner of obtaining peace. The view that different tantras generated different minds is invalid because Vajradhara is Buddha before all Buddhas. This is subtle but crucial—don't think of tantras as competing philosophies or different religious traditions. They're all describing the same reality from different angles, like how physicists might describe light as both waves and particles. The reality itself is one; the descriptions are many.
