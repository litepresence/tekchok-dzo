PAGE 75 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa details the self-enlightened path further [2726-2781], and you must appreciate its rigor! The distinction between person-self and dharma-self [2726] is crucial here. Person-self: the grasping at "I" and "mine" on the five aggregates. Dharma-self: the grasping at atoms, at moments, at the antidote consciousness as real.

Arya hearers realize person-selflessness but not dharma-selflessness [2731]. They see no self in the aggregates, but they still think aggregates themselves are real. Self-enlightened ones realize outer dharma-grasping is non-existent—atoms are empty, particles are conceptual—but they do not realize non-grasping itself is also empty. They still hold to the mind that knows.

This is subtle! The difference between seeing through outer objects and seeing through inner consciousness. It is like cleaning the window so clearly you forget the glass itself is still there, still slightly obscuring. The bodhisattva's wisdom goes further, seeing that even the clarity, even the knowing, even the emptiness itself is empty.

The meditation on the eight unpleasant objects [2781]—the blue, red, remaining, swollen, worm-entered, scattered, white corpses—this is powerful antidote to attachment! You cling to this body as beautiful, as desirable, as "mine." But look at it after death! This is what awaits. The worms do not discriminate between beautiful and ugly. Decay does not respect your vanity.

These meditations are not morbid; they are liberating! When you truly see the body's nature—impermanent, impure, suffering, not-self—attachment naturally loosens. You do not have to force renunciation; it arises spontaneously from clear seeing.

"Without listening or hearing, therefore called the self-enlightened vehicle" [2781]. In their final life, they do not depend on a teacher. They realize through their own power, their own insight, their own meditation. This is possible because of vast previous cultivation—a hundred kalpas of accumulation [2739]! Do not think you can skip the preparation. Their independence is earned through eons of dependence on teachers in previous lives.
