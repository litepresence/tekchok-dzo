[9344-9348] Listen here, practitioner! The great yoga's stages—four of them: very yoga ground, self-ground certain yoga ground, elaboration yoga ground, and action-free complete yoga ground. Do you hear the progression? From certainty in one's own nature, through the play of elaboration, to freedom from doing—these are not sequential achievements but simultaneous aspects of recognition!

[9349-9358] The discriminating yoga ground: sign ground, meaning ground, sign-meaning non-dual ground, unmixed ground—four. The realizing yoga ground: miraculous emanation ground, distinction-realization ground, manifest arising ground, heroic race-distinction ground—four. Combined: sixteen grounds! These aren't rungs on a ladder, dear one—they're facets of a single jewel, viewed from different angles.

[9359-9368] On the first ground, seven controlling miraculous powers arise: emanating body as hundred-thousand; emanating those as hundred-thousand limbs; on one body, emanating hundred-thousand heads; on hundred-thousand bodies, emanating one head; on one head, emanating hundred-thousand different bodies, then emanating from those; emanating countless different heads and limbs on body; emanating in various births—these seven come from realizing the controllable ground. On the second ground, opening one's own belly, showing entrails and heart-lungs to others—this power arises!

Don't chase these powers, dear practitioner! They're signs on the path, not the destination. The real miracle is recognizing what's already here! Emaho!
