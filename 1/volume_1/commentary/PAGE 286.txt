COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 286

You who still think there is something to do! Longchenpa declares at lines [11896-11900]: Action conduct all nirvana, not-done action-do appearance not-exist-therefore, conditioned all pure expanse, that itself self-to self dissolve-therefore, other-to go-do not-is. You think you must perform actions, follow conduct, accumulate merit. You think nirvana is the result of doing something right. Foolish! All action and conduct—already nirvana. Why? Because action that is done, appearance does not exist. Conditioned—all pure expanse. It itself dissolves self-to-self. There is no going to other.

At lines [11901-11920], example-for sun heart-to, self rays all self dissolve like, self resonance and having-by-means-of, mirror appearance all nirvana, this all quality precious, fault-in not-abide self ground-is, self light self-to dissolve-therefore, this-also quality great-as manifest, self essence completely-pure-as, sign grasp-do attachment object cease, outer four-elements coarse-as although, here not-appear-therefore attachment reverse, self pure emptiness great-from, color self-grasp nirvana, this-also other-to go-do not-exist, self essence-as self dissolve-therefore, appearance all nirvana, light mandala self dissolve-therefore, example-for sky rainbow itself, sky itself-to self dissolve like, not-divide great expanse-in, grasping-attachment all nirvana, this-also quality precious. Example: sun to heart—self rays all self dissolve. Self resonance having by means of. Mirror appearance—all nirvana. This all quality precious. Fault not abiding—self ground. Self light self dissolves. This also quality great manifests. Self essence completely pure. Sign grasping, attachment object ceases. Outer four elements coarse, although here not appear—therefore attachment reverses. Self pure emptiness great—from color self-grasp nirvana. This also other-to go not exist. Self essence self dissolves. Appearance all nirvana. Light mandala self dissolves. Example: sky rainbow itself—sky itself self dissolves. Not divide great expanse in. Grasping-attachment all nirvana. This also quality precious.

At lines [11921-11944], quality emergence-mode this like, primordial-awareness itself-to primordial-awareness itself, self essence-as self dissolve-therefore, awareness grasping-thought recollection thought, self-abide equality expanse-to, all nondual nirvana, individual primordial-awareness appearance part-also, made not-exist expanse center-to, set not-exist-as nirvana, that itself self-to self dissolve-therefore, primordial-awareness play various all, self face mother-to dissolve-do is, example-for mother lap child enter like, self primordial-awareness self confident, self nature nirvana, this-also quality precious. Quality emergence-mode like this. Primordial awareness to primordial awareness itself. Self essence self dissolves. Awareness, grasping thought, recollection thought—self-abide equality expanse. All nondual nirvana. Individual primordial awareness appearance part—also made not exist, expanse center. Set not exist as nirvana. That itself self-to self dissolves. Primordial awareness play various all—self face mother dissolves. Example: mother's lap, child enters. Self primordial awareness self confident. Self nature nirvana. This also quality precious.

At lines [11940-11956], again quality dissolve-do mode, kaya itself kaya-to self dissolve-therefore, form all not-thought great-in, appearance not-exist-as nirvana, coarse-by gather-do elements and, subtle-by grasp-do ignorance etc, action-do not-exist-as nirvana, kayas self face-to dissolve-therefore, awareness arise part outward not-fall, example-for vase body form like, inner clear outer move all, nature fire place-as pure. Again quality dissolve-mode. Kaya itself kaya self dissolves. Form all not-thought great in. Appearance not exist as nirvana. Coarse gather elements and, subtle grasp ignorance etc. Action-do not exist as nirvana. Kayas self face dissolve. Awareness arise part outward not fall. Example: vase body form like. Inner clear, outer move all. Nature fire place pure.

So look at the sun. Its rays do not go anywhere else. They dissolve into the sun itself. Look at the mirror. Its appearances do not go anywhere. They are already nirvana. Look at the rainbow in the sky. It does not go somewhere else when it fades. It dissolves into the sky itself. Look at the child entering the mother's lap. It does not travel far. It returns to the source. Your own primordial awareness—confident, self-nature nirvana. The kayas dissolve into themselves. Form is not-thought in the great. Appearance is nirvana without existing as appearance. Action does not exist as nirvana. Everything self-dissolves, self-pure, self-complete. What is left for you to do? Only recognize. Only rest. Only be confident in your own nature.
