[14078-14084] Seed not dripping, insects entering, disease in vessels—these are dreams described to dreamers. Wake up. Where is the vessel now?

[14085-14090] Kundarma center not-changing—this is the only truth in all these words. The center does not change. Have you found your center, or do you still count vertebrae?

[14091-14097] Roma indicates bliss-thought-free. Not the bliss of contact. Not the thought-free of sleep. The natural state before those names were made. That is Roma pointing. Do you see where it points?

Kyangma indicates clear many tastes one. One taste is not a taste at all. It is the tongue before flavor.

Kundarma indicates union non-dual. Not two becoming one. Never two in the first place.

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
