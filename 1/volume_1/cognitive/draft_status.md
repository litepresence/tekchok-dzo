# Draft Status - Cognitive Layer

**Status:** SKELETON DRAFT - 0% SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08

## Layer Specifications
- **Purpose:** shes pa'i rjes su brjod pa (Translator Log) - Internal alignment process
- **Content:** Cognitive trace of translator who already understands the text
- **Character:** Senior Lotsawa - fluent, confident, never searching for meaning
- **Average Length:** ~13 lines per page (target: 15-30 lines)
- **Files:** 479 pages (Volume 1), 415 pages (Volume 2)

## Completion Status
- **Volume 1:** 0% Complete (0/479 pages substantive, 479 stubs)
- **Volume 2:** 0% Complete (0/415 pages substantive, 415 stubs)

## Quality Metrics (Target)
- Structural function documentation
- View register identification
- Translation risk flagging
- Preservation requirements noted
- Page/section bleed tracking
- Line-by-line notes as cliff's notes
- Pre-recognition alignment log

## Current State
BOTH VOLUMES:
- ALL files are stubs (2-17 lines each)
- No substantive cognitive documentation exists
- Layer is essentially empty
- Only minimal placeholder content

## What Should Be Documented (Per Page)
- What is noticed about structure
- What is flagged for attention
- What is accounted for in translation choices
- View register shifts
- Technical term decisions
- Ambiguities and resolutions
- Page-to-page bleed considerations

## Remaining Work
- **Volume 1:** 479 pages need full development
- **Volume 2:** 415 pages need full development
- **Priority:** LOW - This is a non-authoritative audit layer

## Next Steps
1. Review prompt.md cognitive layer specifications in detail
2. Generate sample high-quality cognitive log for 5-10 pages
3. Establish consistent format and depth
4. Systematic generation of remaining pages
5. Focus on structural insights and translation decisions

## Important Distinctions
- NOT analysis - it's pre-translation recognition
- NOT teaching - it's translator's internal notes
- NOT discovery - it's post-understanding documentation
- Transcript of "what is already clear"

## Tone Requirements
- Fully fluent, fully confident
- Never searching for meaning
- Cliff's notes style - concise and practical
- No doctrinal explanation
- No interpretation for others
- Self-talk documentation only

## Notes
- Non-authoritative cognitive artifact
- Exists solely for auditability and translation accountability
- Must never be cited as interpretation, commentary, or teaching
- LLM-generated approximation of translator cognition
