[6675-6713] After the seven lineages of awareness-holder victors complete their activity in Jambudvipa, the teaching moves to other realms following the lifespan of ten years. The Buddha Utpal me tog mdzes appears in Yangs pa skyob pa, engaging in enlightened activity for beings. After this aeon ends, the aeon of 'Khor ba dong sprugs manifests, where Buddha 'Khor lo glog gi phreng ba holds the teaching and liberates beings from samsara. The dissolution of the realms and the entry of the teaching supports into the expanse of suchness marks the completion of one great cycle.

[6714-6754] Following the long dissolution, the subsequent emergence repeats the pattern. The citation from Sgra thal 'gyur chen po presents the cycle of teaching emergence across seven realms, with the final teaching in this world system occurring when the lifespan reaches ten years and the essence of the teaching appears. The mention of two hundred years of darkness, three hundred years, five hundred years, and the re-emergence of the teaching's fire establishes the cyclical nature of manifestation. The structure of ten hearers, twenty thousand arhats, and the 'dul ba teaching for one aeon preserves the systematic presentation.
