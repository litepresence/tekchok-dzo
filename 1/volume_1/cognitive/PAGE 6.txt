Scriptural citation from Inconceivable Buddha-Field and Wisdom Sūtra. Hierarchical vision capacity: gods and humans of three thousand worlds fewer than one outsider ṛṣi with clairvoyance sees beings within cart-wheel's extent. That vision exceeds śrāvakas' eight liberations, one dhyāna practitioner sees more within cart-wheel. That exceeds bodhisattvas' eight liberations, one dhyāna practitioner sees more. That exceeds Tathāgata's vision sees more within cart-wheel's extent. Progressive hierarchy establishes Buddha-vision as supreme. Cart-wheel as unit of measure signals limited scope containing infinite content. The comparative structure demonstrates quantitative transcendence at each level.

Cosmic pervasion and emanation. Thus wherever sky pervades as place, sentient beings pervade. Those pervaded by Buddha emanations doing benefit, some directly by Samantabhadra's emanations, some by Buddhas included in other tantras, all arising from Samantabhadra first showing path, generating mind. Called Samantabhadra's tantric benefit. The emanation hierarchy distinguishes direct from indirect manifestation. Rgyud as tantra or continuum signals unbroken lineage.

Transition to second topic. In this field Vajradhara's peaceful attainment, some think from primordial protector, different tantra sentient beings generate mind. This is incorrect. Polemical refutation establishing correct view. Kha cig signals opponent position to be rejected.

[183-189]
Scriptural proof from Guhyagarbha. First victorious one, earth-victorious one, great being, great destroyer. This teacher Vajradhara, Buddha before all Buddhas. Contradicts opponent view. Citation from root tantra as authoritative refutation.

[190-191]
Resolution. Therefore for this field's beings' benefit, from primordial time Samantabhadra's emanations taught like ordinary beings generating mind, manner of becoming Buddha, great activities play. Such manner renowned in common sūtras too. Resolution synthesizes apparent contradiction: emanations appear as ordinary while being primordially enlightened.
