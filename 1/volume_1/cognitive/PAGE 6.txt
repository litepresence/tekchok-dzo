[163-170]

RECOGNITION:
Citation from Sūtra of Entering Buddha Fields and Inconceivable Wisdom (sangs rgyas kyi yul dang ye shes bsam gyis mi khyab pa la 'jug pa'i mdo). Hierarchical perception: gods/humans < outsider sages < śrāvakas < bodhisattvas < Tathāgatas. Progressive expansion of vision measured in chariot-wheel extent (shing rta'i 'phang lo tsam) of earth. Standard Buddhist epistemological gradation.

VIEW REGISTER:
Sūtric view - Hierarchy of perception / Graduated omniscience

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 163: Explicit citation marker
- Line 165: shing rta'i 'phang lo = chariot wheel = standard measurement
- Progressive hierarchy: trichiliocosm < meditation person < bodhisattva < Tathāgata

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Hierarchical vision = epistemological capacity gradation
- Chariot-wheel extent = finite measure containing infinite perception
- Tathāgata vision = most expansive = omniscience

[171-176]

RECOGNITION:
Synthesis: Sky-pervading places filled with sentient beings, pervaded by Buddha emanations. Some directly Samantabhadra's emanation (ston pa kun tu bzang po'i sprul pas), some other tantra Buddhas—all ultimately from Samantabhadra showing path and generating mind (sems bskyed). Called "Samantabhadra benefiting through tantra" (kun tu bzang pos rgyud nas don mdzad pa).

VIEW REGISTER:
Tantric view - Emanation unity / Single source

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 173: dngos su = directly
- Line 175: lam bstan nas sems bskyed du bcug pa = showing path and causing mind-generation
- Line 176: rgyud nas = through tantra/continuity

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Single source = Samantabhadra as ground of all emanation
- Multiple emanations = diversity from unity
- rgyud = continuity = unbroken lineage transmission

[177-179]

RECOGNITION:
Reference to treatise sequence: sangs rgyas las chos chos las 'phags pa'i tshogs. Standard three jewels formula applied to cosmological emanation structure. Sequence meaning (go rim gyi dgongs pa) establishes hierarchical derivation.

VIEW REGISTER:
Sūtric framework / Three jewels sequence

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 177: bstan bcos 'ga' zhig tu = in some treatises
- Line 178: Three jewels sequence = Buddha > Dharma > Sangha

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Standard formula given tantric interpretation
- Sequence implies dependence and derivation
- Three jewels manifesting from ground

[180-182]

RECOGNITION:
Second topic (gnyis pa): manner of Vajradhara obtaining peace in this field. Refutation of view that different tantra sentient beings generate mind from first protector. Position deemed invalid (mi rigs te).

VIEW REGISTER:
Polemical distinction / Tantric doxography

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 180: gnyis pa zhing 'dir = second topic, in this field
- Line 182: mi rigs te = not valid = logical rejection

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Doxographical debate structure
- Single vs multiple ground sources
- Logical validity (rigs) as epistemological criterion

[183-189]

RECOGNITION:
Citation from Guhyagarbha (sgyu 'phrul rdo rje) refuting alternative view. "First Buddha, earth Buddha" (dang po'i rgyal ba sa rgyal ba) and "This teacher Vajradhara, Buddha before all Buddhas" (sangs rgyas kun bas sngar sangs rgyas). Contradiction ('gal ba) established with opposing view.

VIEW REGISTER:
Tantric citation authority / Primordial Buddha doctrine

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 183: sgyu 'phrul rdo rje = Guhyagarbha Tantra
- Line 184: dang po'i rgyal ba = first Buddha = primordial
- Line 188: sangs rgyas kun bas sngar sangs rgyas = Buddha before all Buddhas

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Guhyagarbha as highest tantric authority
- Primordial Buddha = Samantabhadra/Vajradhara
- Citation trumps philosophical speculation

[190-191]

RECOGNITION:
Conclusion: For this field's beings' purpose, Samantabhadra's emanation showed ordinary beings generating mind (so so skye bos sems bskyed pa ltar bstan), becoming Buddha manner, opening great activity play (mdzad pa chen po'i rol pa bkye ba). This manner famous even in common sūtras (thun mong gi mdo sde dag las kyang grags te).

VIEW REGISTER:
Dzogchen view - Single emanation source / Pedagogical manifestation

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 190: so so skye bo = ordinary individual beings
- sangs rgyas pa'i tshul = manner of becoming Buddha
- Line 191: thun mong gi mdo sde = common sūtras

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Pedagogical manifestation = appears as ordinary but is primordial
- Single Samantabhadra source for all Buddha activity
- Even sūtras acknowledge this tantric structure
