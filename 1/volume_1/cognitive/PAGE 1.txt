[1-11]
Opening frame with triple ornamental shad establishing textual authority. Sanskrit incipit in Tibetan script, bilingual titular protocol declaring Indian origin and Tibetan rendering. Standard mdzod colophon formula marks treasury genre. Homage to Samantabhadra as primordial dharmakāya. The Tibetan text uses phrasing that positions Sanskrit as source and Tibetan as derived, though both coexist as parallel authorities. Translate the Sanskrit restoration carefully following IAST conventions. Retain bzhugs so as formulaic presence-marker, not mere location. Kun tu bzang po must remain as Samantabhadra, not reduced to All-Good.

[12-15]
First homage verse establishing fivefold refuge mandala. Samantabhadra possesses five perfections in nature, five family regents emerge as sambhogakāya, five vidyādharas carry aural lineage, three worlds comprise retinue, culminating in source of auspiciousness receiving crown offering. The structure builds hierarchical ascent through anaphoric chains. Five perfections formula references teacher, retinue, place, teaching, time condensed into one. Snyan brgyud denotes unbroken whispered transmission. The cosmological enumeration must not flatten into mere list; maintain mandala ascent.

[16-19]
Second homage shifting to dharmakāya register. Primordial purity, cessation of all elaboration, dharmatā, clear light, seven horses as sun metaphor, non-abiding in existence or peace, uncompounded nature, spontaneous accomplishment. Culminates in Vajra-point and Sugata-essence. Technical Dzogchen vocabulary requires precise rendering: gdod nas as from the primordial, spros kun zhi ba as cessation of elaboration, srid zhir mi gnas as transcendence of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dichotomy. Lhun gyis grub must retain spontaneously accomplished without fabrication. These terms anchor the view.

[20-23]
Third homage establishing vehicle hierarchy. Dharma-sun as source, vast and immeasurable. Unsurpassed secret vajra vehicle as supreme among paths. Great Perfection positioned as pinnacle vehicle. Prayer for protection of mind-lotus follows as conventional frame. Vehicle stratification is clear: causal vehicles below, resultant tantra above, Atiyoga at apex. Rang bzhin denotes self-existing, not constructed through practice. Bde gshegs snying po as Sugata-essence signals Buddha-nature doctrine.

[24-27]
Composition declaration in four-line verse. Makara throne as mythological place, vajra essence sphere as nature, profound and vast abodes as subject matter. Future tense declaration establishes autocommentary genre. Fourfold structure names place, essence, clarification, action. The makara throne signals non-ordinary setting. Rnam par bshad bya in future tense marks shift from homage to exposition. Preserve the architectural clarity of the fourfold declaration.

[28-35]
Transition to autocommentary prose body. Trikāya manifestation as basis for threefold classification: teacher, place, teaching as organizing principles. Perfect place defined as dharmatā luminous-clarity ground. Uncompounded qualities spontaneously manifest as appearance in precious field. The trikāya structure is universal Buddhist framework, not unique to Dzogchen. Gzhi as ground serves as basis for both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Threefold classification by teacher-place-teaching follows standard commentarial convention.
