[1-11]

RECOGNITION:
Opening title page with triple ornamental shad (@#/) framing Sanskrit incipit yAnAgraratnakOzanAmabhidzahAram in Tibetan orthography. Bilingual titular protocol establishes textual authority: Sanskrit Yānāgratnakōśanāma (Treasury of the Jewel of the Supreme Vehicle) rendered into Tibetan as Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod ces bya ba. Standard mdzod genre colophon formula ces bya ba bzhugs so marks canonical presence. Initial homage (phyag 'tshal lo) directed toward dpal kun tu bzang po—Samantabhadra as primordial dharmakāya Buddha.

Dzogchen view - Dharmakāya homage / Supreme vehicle framework

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 2: Sanskrit in Tibetan script requires phonetic reconstruction; standard restoration follows IAST conventions
- Line 4: Formulaic bzhugs so denotes authoritative textual presence, not mere physical location
- Line 7-10: Bilingual protocol (rgya gar skad du / bod skad du) establishes Indian-Tibetan transmission lineage
- Line 11: phyag 'tshal lo = full prostration formula indicating total surrender of ego

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Sanskrit-Tibetan title hierarchy must remain visible as authorizing structure
- "Kun tu bzang po" must not be reduced to "All-Good"; retain as Samantabhadra (primordial Buddha)
- Genre markers (mdzod, ces bya ba bzhugs so) signal encyclopedic treasury format

[12-15]

RECOGNITION:
First homage verse (tshig bcad) establishing the fivefold refuge structure: (1) Samantabhadra as ground principle possessing five perfections (phun sum tshogs lnga), (2) five family regents (rgyal tshab rigs lnga) as sambhogakāya emanation, (3) five vidyādharas (rig 'dzin rnam lnga) representing aural lineage transmission (snyan brgyud), (4) three worlds with gods as cosmic retinue, (5) culmination in source of auspiciousness (bkra shis bde legs). Cumulative anaphoric structure (gang gi...rgyal tshab...rig 'dzin...dpal ldan) builds hierarchical mandala of refuge.

Tantric/Dzogchen view - Fivefold perfection / Mandala refuge

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 12: phun sum tshogs lnga = five perfections (teacher, retinue, place, teaching, time) condensed into Samantabhadra's nature
- Line 13: rgyal tshab = regent; rigs lnga = five families; de ded dpon dam pa'i ston pa = sublime guide teacher
- Line 14: snyan brgyud = aural/ear-whispered lineage (unbroken transmission); 'jig rten gsum gyi rgyan = ornament of three worlds
- Line 15: gtsug gi mchod = crown offering (supreme offering position)

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Five perfections = cosmological completeness formula
- "Gang chen mtsho" = Great Ocean = epithet of Samantabhadra's regent
- Hierarchical enumeration must not flatten into list; maintain cosmological ascent

[16-19]

RECOGNITION:
Second homage verse shifting to dharmakāya-level praise. Technical Dzogchen vocabulary: primordial purity (gdod nas rnam dag), cessation of elaboration (spros kun zhi ba), dharmatā (chos nyid), clear light ('od gsal), seven horses (rta bdun = sun), non-abiding in existence or peace (srid zhir mi gnas), uncompounded ('dus ma byas), spontaneous accomplishment (lhun gyis grub). Culminates in Vajra-point (rdo rje rtse mo) and Sugata-essence (bde gshegs snying po).

Dzogchen view - Dharmakāya nature / Primordial ground

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 16: gdod nas = from the primordial = primordial time; spros kun zhi ba = cessation of all elaboration (prapañca)
- Line 17: rtag bzhugs = ever-abiding; rta bdun = seven horses = sun = clear light metaphor
- Line 18: srid zhir mi gnas = not dwelling in existence or peace = transcendence of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dichotomy
- Line 19: rdo rje rtse mo = Vajra-point = diamond essence; bde gshegs snying po = Sugata-essence = Buddha-nature

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- "'Dus ma byas" = uncompounded = not produced by causes = essential nature
- "Lhun gyis grub" = spontaneously accomplished = without effort or fabrication
- Technical Dzogchen terms (ka dag, 'od gsal, lhundrub) must retain precision

[20-23]

RECOGNITION:
Third homage verse establishing vehicle hierarchy. Dharma-sun (chos tshul nyi ma) as source, stainless (dri med), vast, immeasurable. Unsurpassed secret vajra vehicle (bla med rab gsang rdo rje'i theg pa) as supreme. Among vehicles, Great Perfection (rdzogs pa chen po) as pinnacle (rtse). Prayer for protection (skyongs) of author's mind-lotus (bdag blo'i pad mtshor).

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 20: chos tshul = Dharma-principle; dpag yas = immeasurable; nam mkha'i rgyan = ornament of space
- Line 21: bla med = unsurpassed = anuttara; rab gsang = secret = guhya; so nor bu = wish-fulfilling jewel (cintāmaṇi)
- Line 22: rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po = natural Great Perfection = Atiyoga
- Line 23: de kho na nyid = suchness/tathatā; brda'i kyis = by symbolic indication

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Vehicle hierarchy: causal < resultant tantra < Atiyoga
- "Rang bzhin" = natural = self-existing, not constructed
- Protection prayer = conventional frame for supreme teaching

[24-27]

RECOGNITION:
Composition declaration in four-line verse (tshig bcad). Makara throne (chu srin 'dzin khri) as place, vajra essence sphere (rdo rje snying po'i dbyings) as nature, profound and vast abodes (zab cing rgya che'i gnas) as subject matter. Future tense declaration (rnam bshad bya = I shall compose) establishes autocommentary genre.

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 24: chu srin = makara (sea monster); 'dzin khri = throne
- Line 25: rdo rje snying po = vajra essence = dharmakāya nature
- Line 26: zab cing rgya che = profound and vast = standard Dzogchen descriptor
- Line 27: rnam par bshad bya = future tense = intent to compose autocommentary

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Fourfold structure: place/essence/clarification/composition
- Makara throne = mythological setting = non-ordinary location
- Future tense signals shift from homage to exposition

---

[28-35]

RECOGNITION:
Transition to autocommentary prose body. Trikāya manifestation (dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya) as basis for threefold classification. Teacher (ston pa), place (gnas), and teaching (bstan pa) as classificatory principles. Perfect place defined as dharmatā luminous-clarity ground (chos nyid 'od gsal gyi gzhi). Uncompounded qualities (su'ang mngon par 'dus ma byas pa'i yon tan) spontaneously manifesting as appearance (snang ba lhun grub) in precious field.

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 28-30: Trikāya formula standard across Mahāyāna
- Line 31-33: Threefold classification (ston pa, gnas, bstan pa'i dbang gis)
- Line 34: chos nyid 'od gsal gyi gzhi = dharmatā clear light ground = ultimate abode
- Line 35: su'ang = by anyone/anything; lhun grub = spontaneously present

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Trikāya structure = universal Buddhist framework
- "Gzhi" = ground = basis of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa
- Uncompounded = not caused = primordial nature
