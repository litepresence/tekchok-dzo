[6801-6831] The classification of teachers distinguishes root and branch teachers. The root teacher, based on empowerment, explains tantra, gives oral instructions, and maintains the continuity of practice. The branch teacher of oral instructions relies on empowerment as the basis, with explaining tantra as the secondary condition, and receiving oral instructions transforming the branch into a second root teacher. The supplementary explanation of teachers to be abandoned presents the Rang shar citation enumerating ten characteristics of unsuitable teachers: great ignorance and pride, foolishness and verbosity, not understanding secret mantra meaning, arrogance about harming others, entering wrong paths, not seeing the mandala of empowerment, violating samaya, unable to answer questions, little learning and great pride—these are demons of students, not secret mantra teachers, incapable of teaching ati dzogchen, to be avoided.

[6832-6855] The student's nature presents the ten qualities: aversion to samsaric phenomena, devotion and longing for the teacher, dharma, and companions, stable faith not attending to things other than dharma, interest in definitive meaning with generosity and diligence, few attachments and good fortune, great wisdom and abiding in samaya and vows, concordance with others' minds and turning the mind to dharma, listening to the teacher's words and not squandering the secret, great learning and tamed mind, and specifically viewing the teacher as buddha or greater. The student possessing these ten qualities is the excellent supreme student who will certainly attain liberation from samsara.
