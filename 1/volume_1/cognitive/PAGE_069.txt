[2428-2433] Thus the Sugata spoke: Son of good family, because you doubt having entered mistaken paths, I taught perishable composite views extensively. Externalists' philosophical positions are explained. Second, beyond-world vehicles expanded classification has three: the way of transcending externalists, general designation, and detailed explanation.

[2434-2445] First is accepting the four seals of dharma and going for refuge to the Three Jewels, thus transcending. Among externalist paths, this is absent. The four seals are: all compounded things are impermanent; all with outflows are suffering; all dharmas are empty and selfless; nirvana is peace. Second has five: nature, etymology, classification, purpose, and result. The nature of beyond-world vehicles is whatever dharma classification is the supreme method for definitely extracting from samsara. Etymology is whatever entered produces happiness and joy. From the Sutra: Whatever ridden, all sentient beings transcend sorrow, produce joy, happiness, and virtues. This vehicle is like space, immeasurable great mansion. Classification: small and great two, or Hearers, Solitary Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas' three vehicles, or inconceivable regarding trainees' minds. From Lankavatara: As long as mind engages, vehicles' ends are not reached. Purpose: temporary and ultimate purposes are accomplished. Result: definitely emerging from three realms, obtaining liberation.

[2446-2474] Third, detailed explanation: from Rigpa Rangshar, vehicle classification: Sutra and Great Expansion; and also Super Great Expansion. Super Great Expansion is eighty-four thousand inconceivable, extensively numerous great, inconceivable immeasurable, inexpressible transcending thought great. Great victory: thus the Bodhisattva vehicle, wordless emptiness, nonexistent emptiness is asserted. Thus it was spoken. Second, expanded explanation of established philosophical positions: Mind-Only and Middle Way systems. First, various white-red appearances with consciousness all are asserted as truly mind's aspects: Mind-Only true-aspect and consciousness-aspect false two. First, meaning-appearances are external-sharings of one's own consciousness's aspects only, like jewel-tree-branch-hanging jewels' reflections appearing in water while jewels appear externally. Here classification: as many aspects so many consciousnesses; aspects and consciousness like cracked egg; aspects and consciousness various non-dual three. First, when hearing sound, only sound-grasping consciousness arises, not color-grasping etc., consciousness arises regarding whatever object engaged, others not arising, therefore as many aspects so many consciousnesses.
