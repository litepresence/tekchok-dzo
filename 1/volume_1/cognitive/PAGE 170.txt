[6801-6829] The sixth chapter addresses the topic of empowerment, the door of entry into the unsurpassed vehicle. The threefold structure—basis for entering empowerment, actual path of empowerment, and complete result of empowerment—organizes the presentation. The first section on the teacher's characteristics presents the Rang shar citation enumerating twelve qualities: possessing vajra meaning, good fortune, skill with students, obtained empowerment, accomplished in secret mantra meaning, unobstructed with yidam deity, undistracted in samadhi, learned in dzogchen instructions, accomplished in external and internal activities, not departing from view, engaged in secret activities, and abiding like a jewel mine of inexhaustible qualities.

[6830-6855] The Sgra thal 'gyur citation presents the definitive characteristics: the root of all qualities, holding the basis of complete enlightenment, and six perfections including abandoning samsaric phenomena, few desires and contentment, skill in methods with experience, learned in tantra meaning and diligent in practice, skilled in view with complete ability, and great compassion delighting in generosity. The term dpal ldan rdo rje 'dzin pa refers to the glorious vajra holder as the fully qualified teacher, embodying the capacity to plant the seeds of the six classes of beings and purify the six afflictions while manifesting the six wisdoms.
