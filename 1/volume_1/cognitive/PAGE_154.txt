[5982-6020] The citation from the sbyong rgyud and the explanation of 'di skad bdag gis thos pa establishes the lineage transmission through direct hearing. The identification of the compiler as Vajrapani hearing from Samantabhadra preserves the mythic structure of transmission that operates outside ordinary temporal sequence. The four purposes of presenting the common prologue—establishing confidence in the teacher, maintaining unbroken lineage, demonstrating consistency across time, and generating faith in the retinue—structure the hermeneutical approach. The refutation of the objection that this is a fabricated teaching requires careful translation of the logical structure to preserve the argumentative force without distortion.
