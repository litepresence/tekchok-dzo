[5891-5901] The discussion of sound and letters moves into the subtle domain of how the ineffable expresses itself. The metaphor of echo and the analogy of reflected sound appearing without conceptual construction must be rendered with precision to avoid importing Western philosophical distinctions between representation and reality. The phrase rnam rtog med cing bzo med pa describes a mode of manifestation that operates beyond ordinary cognitive processing, and translation choices here risk either over-intellectualizing or reducing to mere metaphor what the text presents as literal functioning.

[5902-5935] The threefold division of where the tantra emerges structures the cosmology of manifestation. Each of the three locales—chos kyi sku'i gnas, longs spyod rdzogs pa sku'i gnas, and sprul sku'i gnas—requires distinct terminology that preserves their functional relationships. The enumeration of the five mothers, five male bodhisattvas, and eight female bodhisattvas in the sambhogakaya realm presents a conventional enumeration that must be preserved exactly as given. The description of emanated forms in the nirmanakaya realm lists the standard six classes of beings, maintaining consistency with Abhidharma frameworks while preparing for the uncommon presentation to follow.
