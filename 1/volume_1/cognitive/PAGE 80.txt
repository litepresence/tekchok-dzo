[2960-2978] Heat is shown through three aspects: external, internal, and both. External heat generation thus: from second Stainless, appearance-emptiness arises. This is samadhi practice, said to arise on two grounds. Internal heat is on sixth ground, empty-knowable realized. Both heat thus: said to arise from seventh ground. Eighth obtaining patience. Ninth peak culmination. Tenth supreme dharma. Thus desiring ten grounds' attainment. This is Bodhisattva vehicle, wordless emptiness, nonexistent emptiness asserted. Thus spoken.

[2979-2993] Second, expanded established-philosophical-positions explanation: Mind-Only and Middle Way systems. First also, various white-red appearances with consciousness all are asserted as truly mind's aspects: Mind-Only true-aspect and consciousness-aspect false two. First is meaning-appearances as merely external-sharings of own consciousness's aspects, like jewel-tree-branch-hanging jewels' reflections appearing in water while jewels appear externally. Here classification: as many aspects so many consciousnesses; aspects and consciousness like cracked egg; aspects and consciousness various non-dual three. First, when hearing sound, only sound-grasping consciousness arises, not form-grasping etc., consciousness arises regarding whatever object engaged, others not arising, therefore as many aspects so many consciousnesses.

[2994-3008] Second is external-various-appearing also produced from consciousness, aspects and consciousness subject-object one mind arising like cracked egg. Now when holding objects, though one external-aspect consciousness and one internal-holding consciousness arises, beginningless habits make two appear, yet self-awareness one only, no other establishment, like cracked egg. If so, when internal-holding consciousness arises regarding one external-aspect consciousness at that time, two knowledges become simultaneous? Not becoming: because that aspect-consciousness is non-conceptual. Third, though external-objects' aspects variously appear, one internal-holder consciousness knows, like quick monkey entering fort, four corners blurred appearing, looking-looking, one consciousness entering five doors knowing objects. When knowing, aspects and consciousness both are one mind's nature non-dual, like dream-appearances and holder self-appearances both non-dual with one sleep-consciousness.

[3009-3021] Second, false-aspects: external-object these aspect-consciousnesses deluded-appearance habits false, not truly consciousnesses; that meeting-knowledge also false-measured, no measure by true experience; object-consciousness both merely deluded-appearances false-nature is asserted. Here classification: asserting defiled-false and undefiled-pure two. First is present various-aspect-appearances and that meeting-knowledge both merely mind's defilements appearing, ultimately non-dual wisdom with dharmadhatu's qualities merely existing; consciousness-establishment nothing exists. Buddha's dharmakaya without remainder...
