[6755-6776] The citation completes the description of the final aeons, including two dark aeons, the birth of the teacher, the gathering of eight thousand bodhisattvas as the retinue, and the Abhidharma teaching for one hundred aeons with all attaining the result in one lifetime. The dissolution of samsara at this time and the non-existence of the six classes of beings marks the completion. The subsequent twenty thousand aeons without embodied beings leads to the re-emergence through the power of karma, demonstrating the cyclical nature of manifestation dependent on conditions.

[6777-6800] The clarification addresses differing views among teachers regarding whether Samantabhadra's realm alone dissolves or whether the realms established by Vajradhara also dissolve. The resolution affirms that both are correct—Samantabhadra's compassion liberates all, and the awakening of potential from the expanse remains without contradiction. The transition marks the completion of the fifth chapter on difficult points in the definitive secret essence, concluding the presentation of establishing confidence in the lineage.
