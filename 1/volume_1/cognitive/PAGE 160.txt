[6296-6342] The explanation of the teaching's duration in other world systems culminates in the description of the final dissolution. The Buddha Utpal me tog mdzes holds the teaching essence for five thousand years in the Yangs pa skyob pa realm, followed by the Buddha 'Khor ba 'jig in the Gtsug phud dbyangs ldan realm for seven hundred thousand years. After eighty-five aeons, all phenomena dissolve into the buddha nature, and the world realms become space itself. The subsequent emergence of beings from the expanse and the re-establishment of the Tshangs chen realm by Vajradhara repeats the cycle without beginning or end.
