[59-60]

RECOGNITION:
Definitive determination of "place" (gnas nges pa) specified as luminous-clarity vajra-essence teaching ('od gsal rdo rje snying po'i bstan pa). Characterized as unsurpassable mind-secret (thugs kyi gsang ba bla na med pa) of all Tathāgatas—the great completely-complete vajra place of wondrous marvelous self-nature (ngo mtshar rmad du byung ba'i bdag nyid). Establishes tantric authority through epistemological definitiveness.

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 59: gnas nges pa = definite place = epistemologically determined ground
- Line 60: thugs kyi gsang ba = mind secret = innermost dimension
- ngo mtshar rmad du byung ba = wondrous marvelous = standard tantric epithet

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- gnasa nges pa = technical term for definitive specification
- bla na med pa = unsurpassable = anuttara = highest tantra category
- Self-nature as marvelous = primordial perfection without contrivance

RECOGNITION:
Explicit citation from Guhyagarbha Tantra (gsang ba rgyal po'i mdzod). Threefold cosmogonic presentation: (1) primordial protector's manifest enlightenment and field arrangement (zhing khams ji ltar bkod pa'i tshul rgya mtsho), (2) peaceful attainment in this field through Vajradhara's emanation (zhi ba brnyes pa'i tshul), (3) Dharma-wheel turning through emanation-body elaboration (sprul pa'i sku spros pas chos kyi 'khor lo bskor ba'i tshul). Sequential trikāya emanation structure.
