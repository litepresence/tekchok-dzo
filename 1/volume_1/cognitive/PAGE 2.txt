[36-40]

RECOGNITION:
Detailed exposition of "perfect teacher" (ston pa phun sum tshogs pa). Samantabhadra as dharmakāya teacher possessing complete dominion (mnga' dbang rdzogs pa) together with wisdom-ocean retinue (ye shes rgya mtsho'i tshogs). Key technical term: sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa = body and wisdom non-dual abiding in intention (dgongs pa). Teaching beyond cause-effect and effort (rgyu 'bras bya rtsol las 'das pa) as dharmakāya nature. Temporal frame: dharmatā beyond effort, abiding in primordial sphere (gdod ma'i dbyings) of subtle inner clarity-wisdom (nang gsal phra ba'i ye shes).

VIEW REGISTER:
Dzogchen view - Dharmakāya level / Non-dual ground

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 36: mnga' dbang rdzogs pa = complete dominion/sovereignty
- Line 37: 'du 'bral med pa = non-dual/non-separate; dgongs pa = intention/mindset
- Line 38: rgyu 'bras bya rtsol las 'das pa = definitive Dzogchen marker: beyond cause-effect AND action-effort
- Line 40: nang gsal = inner clarity; phra ba'i ye shes = subtle wisdom

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- "Bya rtsol" negation = cornerstone of Dzogchen view; must retain "action and effort" not just "effort"
- Body-wisdom inseparability = non-dual ground state
- Primordial sphere = atemporal non-beginning

[41-45]

RECOGNITION:
Explanation of "perfect place" (gnas phun sum tshogs pa) as self-appearing field from ground-nature or blessing (de nyid kyi ngang ngam byin rlabs las). Technical terms: rang snang stug po bkod pa = densely arranged self-appearance; phyir gsal 'od lnga = outer clarity five lights. Five family teachers (rigs lnga so so'i ston pa) self-appearing as mandala play (dkyil 'khor gyi rol pa). Teaching specification: dharmatā luminous-clarity dzogchen spontaneously accomplished. Great self-arisen wisdom (rang chas ye shes chen po) beyond object of pure trainees.

VIEW REGISTER:
Dzogchen view - Sambhogakāya field / Spontaneous display

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 41: ngang ngam = ambiguous particle (nature OR blessing); stug po bkod pa = densely arranged
- Line 42: phyir gsal = outer clarity; rol pa = play/display
- Line 43: rang snang lhun gyis grub = spontaneously accomplished self-appearance
- Line 44: rang chas = self-arisen (not constructed); ye shes chen po = great wisdom

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- "Rang snang" = self-appearing = not externally existent, not mentally constructed
- Five lights = five wisdoms manifesting
- "Las dag pa'i gdul bya" = pure karma trainees = advanced practitioners still cannot objectify this

[46-51]

RECOGNITION:
Sambhogakāya enumeration: sixth teacher Vajradhara of complete marks (mtshan rdzogs rdo rje 'chang) arising in Akanishta field ('og min) through strength and blessing (rtsal lam byin rlabs). Fivefold retinue: earth-dwellers (sa la gnas pa), awareness-holders (rig pa 'dzin pa), ḍākiṇīs (mkha' 'gro ma), accomplished ones (grub pa), completely arranged self-appearances. Teaching result-vajra vehicle (bras bu rdo rje'i theg pa) tantra sections (rgyud sde) ocean-like.

VIEW REGISTER:
Tantric view - Sambhogakāya mandala / Result vehicle

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 46: mtshan rdzogs = complete marks = sambhogakāya; 'og min = Akanishta
- Line 47-50: Fivefold retinue enumeration with shad markers
- Line 51: bsam gyis mi khyab = inconceivable

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Sixth teacher = sambhogakāya Buddha in tantric cosmology
- Retinue includes both pure and impure realm beings
- Result vehicle = tantric path distinct from causal vehicles

[52-56]

RECOGNITION:
Nirmāṇakāya exposition. Perfect place appearing individually (so so) to beings' self-appearances. Perfect teacher as emanation-body (sprul pa'i sku) manifesting as holy guides (ded dpon dam pa) adapting to capacity (gang la gang 'dul). Teaching perfections: when karma and aspiration pure, three baskets (mdo sde, 'dul ba, mngon pa = sūtra, vinaya, abhidharma) appear as various vehicles.

VIEW REGISTER:
Sutric view - Nirmāṇakāya / Causal vehicle

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 53: gang la gang 'dul = taming each according to their capacity
- Line 54-56: Three baskets (sde snod gsum) = tripitaka

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Transition from tantric to sutric presentation
- Individual self-appearances = subjective perception
- Three baskets as causal vehicle, not ultimate

[57-58]

RECOGNITION:
Vehicle hierarchy conclusion. Three causal characteristic vehicles (rgyu mtshan nyid kyi theg pa gsum) as cause and method (rgyu dang thabs) for entering result-vajra vehicle. Secret mantra vajra vehicle (gsang sngags rdo rje theg pa) as completely complete peak (yongs su rdzogs pa'i rtse mo). Supreme result ('bras bu dam pa) = natural Great Perfection (rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po) = unsurpassable vehicle (bla na med pa'i theg pa).

VIEW REGISTER:
Dzogchen view - Vehicle stratification / Atiyoga supremacy

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 57: rgyu mtshan nyid = causal characteristics = svabhāvavāda
- Line 58: yongs su rdzogs pa = completely complete; bla na med pa = unsurpassable = anuttara

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Vehicle hierarchy clearly stratified: Causal < Tantric < Dzogchen
- Dzogchen explicitly positioned as supreme result
- "Rang bzhin" = natural = not acquired through practice
