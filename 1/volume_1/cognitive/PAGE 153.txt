[5936-5964] The root text from Rin po che spungs pa presents in verse the threefold division of locations where the tantra manifests. The verses distinguish the dharmakaya expression characterized by freedom from elaboration, the sambhogakaya expression of spontaneous self-arisen letters, and the nirmanakaya expression that accommodates disciples' capacities. The technical term spros med appears in multiple contexts with slightly different applications, requiring careful attention to preserve its specific meaning in each instance. The phrase rang gsal dag pa'i longs sku describes a mode of clarity and purity that is intrinsic rather than achieved, and translation must avoid implying a process of purification.

[5965-5981] The continuation of the verse structure moves through the three kayas systematically. The dharmakaya section emphasizes the absence of characteristics and the expression of great equality. The sambhogakaya section describes the emanation of teachings from the gathering of the five wisdoms. The nirmanakaya section addresses the six classes of beings according to their respective capacities. Preservation of the enumeration and sequence is essential, as these verses function as a summary framework that subsequent exposition will elaborate.
