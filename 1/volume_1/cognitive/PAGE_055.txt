[1782-1786] The text establishes transcendence of extremes and views as the culmination of the preceding analysis. Beyond extremes means not grasping self in phenomena; beyond view means inexpressibility. This is the seal of the Dzogchen view where all philosophical positions are released without being negated. Translation must preserve the performative dimension of these statements as pointing instructions rather than propositional claims.

[1787-1793] The summary verse declares all distinctions to be illusory like magic and dreams, unestablished in their apparent nature, empty of essence, mere appearances of clarity-emptiness delusion. Mind itself, self-arisen wisdom, arises from ignorance yet obscures as essence. When these deluded appearances dissolve, stainless luminosity becomes manifest. This is the crux of the text's soteriological trajectory. The view register is unmistakably Dzogchen with its identification of sems nyid and rang byung ye shes. Preservation requires maintaining the paradox that ignorance gives rise to wisdom's self-obscuration without temporal or causal priority.

[1794-1796] The present condition is established as dependent on karma and afflictions, yet these depend on improper mental engagement resting on the six or seven consciousness groups including the alaya. This itself rests on self-arisen wisdom, the suchness of mind, naturally pure essence. Because this rests on nothing, it is called self-arisen wisdom. The structural function here is the classic Dzogchen reversal: what appears as ground is actually dependent, while what is groundless is foundational. Translation risks include domesticating this reversal into linear causality.

[1797-1810] The citation from Uttaratantra uses the analogy of elements resting on each other without independent ground to illustrate the dependency of aggregates, elements, and faculties on karma and afflictions. These in turn rest on improper mental engagement, which rests on pure mind essence. Yet mind's nature transcends all location. The verse form requires preservation of its pedagogical function without reducing it to mere ornamentation.

[1811-1822] The text shifts to a threefold classification of karma as white, black, and immovable, or alternatively as meritorious, non-meritorious, and unwavering. Meritorious actions produce pleasant samsaric results including the ten virtues. Non-meritorious actions encompass the ten non-virtues and five heinous deeds. Immovable actions propel birth in the upper realms and yield irreversible results. This is standard Sutric karma theory serving as the conventional foundation for subsequent transcendence.
