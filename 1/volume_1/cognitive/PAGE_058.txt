[1902-1906] The section on mistaken paths begins with the enumeration of three hundred sixty views of the perishable composite. The twofold structure presents first the general nature of eternalism and nihilism, then their specific variations. This architectonic reflects the text's systematic approach to philosophical classification. The view register is polemical yet analytical, serving the soteriological function of establishing correct view through the refutation of error.

[1907-1935] The exposition of eternalist views centers on the Samkhya system as the paradigmatic representative. The tripartite nature of primal matter, darkness, and vital force in equal measure constitutes the self, located in the heart in forms proportionate to the body. This is invisible, white, oily, coiled, indestructible, known to itself. The description preserves the internal logic of the opponent's position before refutation. Translation risks include anachronistic imposition of either Vedantic or Buddhist categories onto this distinct system.

[1936-1942] The citation from Madhyamakavatara summarizes the Samkhya view of self as neither agent nor enjoyer, without qualities or actions, established through enumeration. From slight variations in this, heretical systems diverge. This confirms the text's reliance on authoritative Indian sources for its doxography. Preservation requires maintaining the citation's function as both summary and authentication.

[1943-1948] The nihilist position is introduced as the Lokayata view holding that from present perception of pleasure and pain, nothing else exists. No past or future lives, no karma, no cause and result, no liberation. This extreme reduction to immediate sensation represents the dialectical opposite of eternalism. The structural function is to establish the parameters of philosophical error as grasping at either existence or non-existence.
