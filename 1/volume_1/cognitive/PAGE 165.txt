The recognition that this teaching is the heart of all results, distinct from other paths, requires careful articulation to avoid sectarian distortion while maintaining the text's self-presentation. The term 'bras bu'i thus ka—the causal condition of the result—describes the meeting with this teaching as the decisive factor for swift liberation. The threefold liberation—in this life, in the intermediate state, or in the natural nirmanakaya realm—structures the soteriological outcomes according to capacity.
