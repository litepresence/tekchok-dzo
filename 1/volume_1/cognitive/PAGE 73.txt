[2607-2610] Faculties dull and medium, diligent, some obtain result in that life; sharp and Bodhisattvas, some on support having accumulated much previous five paths' collections, in one sitting completing five paths, desiring liberation. This structural presentation establishes the correlation between faculties' sharpness and temporal efficiency in achieving results. The view register bridges Sutric gradualism with Dzogchen's simultaneous perfection, noting that even within the Hearer vehicle, capacities differ radically.

[2611-2625] This also, from Hearers' vehicle, their path small, medium, great accomplishing Hearers, Solitary Buddhas, and Buddhas' three enlightenments is desired; Mahayana and Mantra path is not desired.

Ground-path meditation thus: desire-antidote meditation, delusion-antidote meditation, thus path meditation is desiring suffering abandonment. Path meditation system thus: regarding desire's antidote, own forehead's center, white skeleton thumb-sized, white light-attachment meditated, from this producing head-only, then body-only meditated, then own seat-only, then all appearances meditated.
