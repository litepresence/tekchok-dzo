[2165-2207] The text enumerates sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety tirthika practitioners with their distinctive characteristics. This cataloging function serves to exhaustively map the field of non-Buddhist spiritual practitioners. The list includes contemplatives, renunciants, and various ascetic types identified by their practices, habitats, and doctrinal affiliations. The view register is doxographical, systematically distinguishing Buddhist from non-Buddhist positions through enumeration. Translation requires preserving the proper names and epithets without attempting to Sanskritize them retroactively. The preservation challenge lies in maintaining the specificity of each category without collapsing them into generic "heretic" labels.

[2208-2244] The classification summarizes that among these practitioners, some assert eternalism, some nihilism, some both, yet all reduce to these two extremes. The citation from Rangshar provides a summary verse: eternalism and nihilism. Nihilism holds that tirthikas are greatly empty, cut off like empty space, viewing nihility as without nature, and results as cut-off emptiness. Eternalism positing non-emptiness is the philosophical position of eternalist vehicles, established as permanent eternalism. Cause-eternalism holds that from the citadel of one's own mind, without father-cause or mother-condition, the size of a mustard seed, sesame grain, or hair-tip, oily coiled white pure, such is the nature of cause, unchanging from the beginning, permanently existent. This cause with habit and aggregates dwells inseparably, therefore held as cause-eternalism. Result-eternalism holds that fortune or great power, served and worshipped through virtue, even when this first body is abandoned, causes rebirth in one's own place. The two, eternalism and nihilism, disagree regarding their own meaning.

[2245-2247] The second section expands on the meaning of the sixtyfold divisions among these positions. This transition indicates the text's movement from summary to detailed exposition, maintaining the structural integrity of the doxographical presentation.
