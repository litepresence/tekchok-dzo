[323-335]
Sambhogakāya body activities enumeration. Threefold face-hand perfection: wisdom, light, and discerning. Each completing body, self-appearance liberation, and knowledge. Four inner activities: thirty-two marks, eighty signs, light-rays emanation, all-direction face pervasion. Four secret activities: no front/back, inner-to-outer clarity, outer-to-inner clarity, tip pervading all directions. The face-hand formula denotes enlightened activity display. Marks and signs as symbolic perfection, not anatomy. Three levels maintain systematic structure: outer, inner, secret.

[336-349]
Speech activities enumeration. Four outer: six self-arisen syllables from tongue, entering father's face, emerging from mother's space, emanating-gathering. Four inner: self-nature explained, non-word, understood meaning appearance, light-rays from face. Four secret: pure body/speech/mind practice. Six self-arisen syllables denote natural mantra, not composed. Yab yum as father-mother signals dharmakāya-dharmadhātu union. Three vajras as body-speech-mind purity complete the structure.
