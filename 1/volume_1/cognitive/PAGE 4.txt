Mandala enumeration section. Precious mudra wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, cross patterns appearing in hollow spaces. Lotus growing from the center supports twenty-five fields in dimensional hierarchy. The five emblems correspond to five families: vajra (Akṣobhya), jewel (Ratnasambhava), lotus (Amitābha), crossed vajra (Amoghasiddhi), with Buddha Vairocana implicit. This architectural description requires maintaining spatial relationships without flattening into inventory.

[81-87]
Pore-mandala cosmology. From pore-holes flow scented water streams as great oceans. Within earth, water, fire, wind particles, all spaces contain Buddha blessings and beings' karma-fields distinct. The ba spu'i khung as pore-holes signals micro-macrocosm identity. Gar khyab as pervasive presence dissolves ordinary spatial limits. Two types of fields: blessed by Buddhas and karmic, operating simultaneously without confusion.

[88-97]
Infinite field manifestations. Round, square, oblong, crescent shapes with immeasurable forms and arrangements appearing inconceivably. Sky-pervasion corresponds to body, speech, mind, qualities, activities and fields arising from these. The geometric forms reference traditional Indian cosmology shapes. Fields emerging from five aspects parallels five Buddha wisdoms. Rtag pa rgyun gyi 'khor mor denotes perpetual wheel of benefit.

[98-105]
Cosmic scope and timelessness. All benefit as activity of original Samantabhadra's field. Vast as dharmadhātu and space. Cannot be measured by years, eons, dust-oceans of fields. Neither beginning nor end can be determined. Unmoving spontaneously accomplished great field-ocean essence. Natural spontaneous Buddha as teacher of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa since beginningless time. The temporal language paradoxically describes atemporal reality. Mi g.yo as unmoving signals unchanging ground.

[106-111]
Trikāya field classification. Dharmakāya time: Luminous-clarity vajra-essence field. Sambhogakāya time: Brahmā drum-sound field. Nirmāṇakāya time: Great Brahmā eon or field. This is Samantabhadra's emanation-Buddhas, those blessed by him, and teachers gone to three times. The threefold temporal classification maintains trikāya structure throughout. Time here denotes dimension, not chronological sequence. Emanation hierarchy: direct emanations and blessed manifestations.
