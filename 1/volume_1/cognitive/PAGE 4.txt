[76-81]

RECOGNITION:
Detailed sambhogakāya cosmological architecture. Five Buddha family symbols enumerated: precious wheel of mudra (phyag rgya rin po che'i 'khor lo), vajra, jewel, lotus, cross (rgya gram). Twenty-five fields (zhing khams nyi shu rtsa lnga) appearing within lotus-born cavity (padma 'khrungs pa'i khong gseng). Pore-holes (ba spu'i khung) emanating perfume-water streams (spos chu'i rgyun) flowing like great ocean.

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 76-80: Five symbols = five families (Buddha, Vajra, Ratna, Padma, Karma)
- Line 80: khong gseng = inside/cavity = interior space of manifestation
- Line 81: ba spu'i khung = pore-holes = subtle body gateways

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Twenty-five fields = 5 families × 5 directions
- Body cosmology: pores as gateways to pure fields
- Symbolic correspondences must not be literalized as physical anatomy

[82-91]

RECOGNITION:
Four elements (earth, water, fire, wind) as subtle particles (rdul phra ba) pervading all places. Dual causation: Buddha blessings (sangs rgyas kyi byin gyis brlabs) AND beings' karma ('gro ba'i las) producing diverse field appearances. Geometric pure land forms: round (zlum po), four-cornered (gru bzhi pa), crescent (nar mo), semi-circle (zla gam), etc. Immeasurable inconceivable (tshad med bsam gyis mi khyab pa) forms and arrangements.

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 86-87: Dual causation: blessings + karma = field diversity
- Line 88-91: Geometric forms as symbolic architecture
- bsam gyis mi khyab = inconceivable = transcending conceptual mind

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Elements as wisdom manifestations, not material constituents
- Field diversity = karmic perception, not objective variety
- Geometric forms carry tantric symbolic meaning

[92-98]

RECOGNITION:
Five Buddha aspects (sku, gsung, thugs, yon tan, 'phrin las) pervading to extent of sky. Fields arising from these aspects pervading all. Perpetual continuous wheel (rtag pa rgyun gyi 'khor mo) serving beings' purposes. Serving as purpose-maker (don mdzad pa) for beings.

Tantric/Dzogchen view - Five wisdoms / Continuous activity

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 92-96: Five aspects enumerated with shad markers
- Line 97: shar ba = arising/emanating
- Line 98: rtag pa rgyun gyi 'khor mo = perpetual continuous wheel

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Five aspects = five wisdoms manifesting as compassionate activity
- Extent of sky = infinite, boundless
- Continuous wheel = timeless compassionate engagement

[99-102]

RECOGNITION:
Attribution to single primordial Samantabhadra as sole agent. Vastness compared to dharmadhātu and sky-field (chos kyi dbyings dang nam mkha'i khams). Time immeasurable from first arising—years and eons, field-particles like ocean cannot be measured. Activities complete without beginning or end cannot be measured.

VIEW REGISTER:
Dzogchen view - Primordial ground / Atemporal activity

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 99: thog ma'i kun tu bzang po gcig = one primordial Samantabhadra
- Line 101: dpag par mi nus = cannot be measured
- Line 102: mthar gyis mdzad pa = finally activities

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Single source = ground manifesting as diversity
- Time measurement impossible = transcends temporal categories
- Activities complete without beginning = primordial perfection

[103-109]

RECOGNITION:
Definition of three fields corresponding to three kāyas. Great unmoving spontaneous field-ocean possessing essence (mi g.yo lhun grub chen po'i zhing khams rgya mtsho'i snying po can). Dharmakāya time: luminous-clarity vajra-essence field ('od gsal rdo rje snying po'i zhing khams). Sambhogakāya time: Brahma drum-sound field (tshangs pa rnga sgra'i zhing khams). Nirmāṇakāya time: great Brahma eon (tshangs chen gyi bskal pa).

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 103: mi g.yo = unmoving = dharmakāya stability
- Line 107: 'od gsal rdo rje snying po = dharmakāya field
- Line 108: tshangs pa rnga sgra = Brahma's drum-sound = sambhogakāya
- Line 109: tshangs chen gyi bskal pa = great Brahma eon = nirmāṇakāya

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Three fields = three kāyas manifesting
- Brahma references = tantric pure land nomenclature
- Field names are technical terms requiring preservation

[110-111]

RECOGNITION:
Clarification of emanation structure. In this meaning ('di'i go na): Samantabhadra's emanation Buddhas (sprul pa'i sangs rgyas) and those becoming Buddhas through that blessing (byin gyis brlabs pas sangs rgyas pa'i ston pa). Teachers of three times (dus gsum du gshegs pa) included.

VIEW REGISTER:
Tantric emanation theory / Single source

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- 'di'i go na = in this meaning/sense = hermeneutical specification
- byin gyis brlabs = blessing = transformative empowerment
- dus gsum = three times = past, present, future

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Emanation structure: ground > blessing > historical Buddhas
- All Buddhas of three times unified in Samantabhadra's field
- Blessing = direct transmission without mediation
