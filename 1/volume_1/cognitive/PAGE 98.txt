[3632-3642] That also is essence appearance-aspect, mind-aspect appearance, therefore whatever appears is mind, mind itself self-arisen wisdom appearing, mind-aspect's display without cessation is self-arisen. Here classification six: result-mind-aspect-source-desired mind-aspect, deviated-obscuration-transcended mind-aspect, reasoning-disturbance-composed mind-aspect, extreme-fallen-without self-arisen-wisdom mind-aspect, aspect-holding things self-established mind-aspect, established-philosophical-position mind-free distinction mind-aspect.

[3650-3660] Second: eight sequences analyzed by intellect deviated-from dharma, depending on nonexistent-aspect-sleep's spontaneous presence, existing-aspect-holding-extreme with deviated, causeless nonexistent self-arisen deviated, therefore assertion merely word-established, essence mind-free, cause-condition crossed key's unproduced self-arisen, unproduced causeless primordially pure, free from obscurations dharmata. This also, deviation dharmata transformation-place without, causeless result-transcended ground, obscuration path-transcended, virtue-sin whichever cannot stain ground.
