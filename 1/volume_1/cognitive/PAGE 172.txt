[6856-6898] The supplementary section on students to be abandoned presents characteristics that render individuals unsuitable vessels: not showing respect and humility, engaging secret mantra loosely, lacking family lineage and good fortune, little wisdom, disparaging kindness, proclaiming one's own family, adorning the body with ornaments, and engaging in meaningless activity—such a student is a demon of teachers to those who speak the meaning of dzogchen. The analogy of pouring lion's milk into a clay vessel that cannot contain it illustrates the unsuitability. If poured, the dharma's power degenerates and the unsuitable vessel falls into lower realms. Therefore, oral instructions of dzogchen should be kept secret from those of lesser intelligence.

[6899-6902] The common practices section presents three aspects: common consideration between teacher and student, methods of service and supplication, and the result of definite necessity.
