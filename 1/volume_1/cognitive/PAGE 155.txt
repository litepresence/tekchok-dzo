[6021-6049] The third main topic addresses the prophecy of the sublime definitive teaching. The three aspects—teaching, supports of the teaching, self-arisen letters, and the three vajras, along with the individuals who uphold them—structure the prophetic framework. The explanation of the manner in which the teaching arose begins with the first Samantabhadra establishing the pure realm of Ogmin, from which Vajradhara emerged through blessing and established subsequent pure realms. The preservation of technical terms like byin rlabs and bkod pa requires consistency with their usage throughout the text, as these carry specific implications about the nature of manifestation and establishment that differ from conventional causation.
