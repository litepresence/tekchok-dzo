[6583-6625] The prophecy of lineage holders from the Sgra thal 'gyur enumerates the succession beginning with Dharma me tog in Uddiyana. The systematic presentation of each holder—their location, duration of holding the teaching, and the successor—establishes the transmission line. The appearance of the Brahmin youth Manjushrimitra after seventy-five years, followed by Shrismha in the So sha gling, Dznyana Sutra in the outcaste class, and subsequent holders through various social classes demonstrates the teaching's accessibility beyond conventional hierarchies. The mention of our own teacher Dge slong dpal ldan as an emanation of the Lord of Beings Ku maradza connects the prophecy to immediate experience.
