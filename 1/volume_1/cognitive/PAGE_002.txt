[36-40]
Exposition of perfect teacher as Samantabhadra possessing complete dominion together with wisdom-ocean retinue. Body and wisdom abide non-dually in intention. Teaching beyond cause-effect and effort characterizes dharmakāya nature. Temporal frame places this in dharmatā beyond effort, abiding in primordial sphere of subtle inner clarity-wisdom. The negation rgyu 'bras bya rtsol las 'das pa is definitive Dzogchen marker requiring both cause-effect and action-effort, not merely effort. Body-wisdom inseparability denotes non-dual ground state. Primordial sphere signals atemporal non-beginning.

[41-45]
Exposition of perfect place arising from ground-nature or blessing as self-appearing field. Dense arrangement of self-appearance adorned with outer clarity five lights. Five family teachers self-appearing as mandala play. Teaching specification: dharmatā luminous-clarity Great Perfection spontaneously accomplished. Great self-arisen wisdom beyond object of pure trainees. The ambiguity ngang ngam allows nature or blessing as source. Rang snang as self-appearing excludes external existence and mental construction. Las dag pa'i gdul bya denotes advanced practitioners who still cannot objectify this level.

Nirmāṇakāya exposition. Perfect place appearing individually to beings' self-appearances. Perfect teacher as emanation-body manifesting as holy guides adapting to capacity.

Individual self-appearances signal subjective perception rather than objective reality. Three baskets as causal vehicle positioned below resultant path.

[57-58]
Vehicle hierarchy conclusion. Three causal characteristic vehicles as cause and method for entering result-vajra vehicle. Secret mantra vajra vehicle as completely complete peak.
