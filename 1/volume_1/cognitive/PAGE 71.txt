[2526-2546] The text classifies Sutra, Vinaya, Abhidharma, and Mahayana vehicle as all included in the three baskets, while mantras are Great Abhidharma. Sutra, Vinaya, Abhidharma, and those three equally are twenty-one thousand, eighty-four thousand dharmaskandhas. From this also, regarding each antidote taming beings' thought-aggregates, extensive numerous inconceivable transcending expression exists. Here, from nine vehicle classification, first Hearers' vehicle explanation has five: nature, etymology, purpose, result, and classification. Nature is the method for realizing personal selflessness, wishing for liberation from samsara alone. Etymology is hearing dharma from the Teacher, proclaiming to others, accomplishing final existence enlightenment, Hearers depending on teachers. Purpose: definitely extracting from samsara. Result: obtaining arhatship with or without remainder. Classification: Sutrantikas and Vaibhasikas two.

[2547-2566] Vaibhasika is asserting coarse conventional truth appears like yak-tail whisk and goat-hair assemblage, yet ultimately partless atom particles; consciousness continuum conventional, momentary ultimate without parts like pot-water. From aggregates, elements, and sense-sources, coarse-appearance atoms circling with intervals. Though asserting personal selflessness, asserting dharmic self of atoms and moments exists. This also, knowing cause-result acceptance-rejection regarding dharmas included in four truths, regarding conditions' four aspects, knowing consciousness-aspects: suffering is known, origin is abandoned, path is practiced, cessation is obtained. Knowing abandoning by suffering...

[2567-2576] Empty and selfless realization aspects: path, reasoning, establishment, definite extraction: cessation, peace, excellence, meditating selfless method, abandoning three realms' seeing and meditation's four hundred fourteen to be abandoned, manifesting exhaustion-knowledge and non-arising-knowledge's supreme wisdom, desiring liberation.

[2577-2596] Sutrantikas: regarding four truths' object, knowing twelve consciousnesses as what engages, abandoning eighty-eight afflictive obstructions, desiring supreme wisdom realization. This also, similar to previous personal selflessness, above this through one portion of dharmadhatu transcending. This also, mainly obstructing partite atoms' five knowable bases, mainly mind-basis, peripheral mind-produced basis, non-associated compositional aggregates basis, uncompounded permanent basis, appearance-form's basis, and five's dharmata. Not obstructing merely partless atoms. Through knowing dharmadhatu's half-portion as external coarse-appearance atom-wings not encountering, this also begun, through knowing partless, transcending previous, similar to not asserting atoms due to lack of meaning.

[2597-2606] Both also, when meditating path, five paths' arising sequence diligently practicing, general antidote to three poisons is meditating selflessness and illusion, particular antidotes: desire through eight impure substances and skeleton, anger through love, delusion through dependent origination forward and reverse, thought-antidote through counting exhalation-inhalation. Selflessness meditation also is meditating object-subject cessation cessation nothing-meaning. If sinking, dullness-delusion antidote: directing mind to crown-fire burning.
