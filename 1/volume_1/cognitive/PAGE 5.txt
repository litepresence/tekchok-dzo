Universal sentient being realm. All sentient being realms exist, extremely vast as field to be tamed. Earth, water, fire, wind, space pervade everywhere, all contained within great Brahmā eon. The gdul zhing as field-to-be-tamed implies pedagogical relationship, not ontological category. Spatial elements as containers reference traditional cosmology. Thams cad tshangs chen gyi bskal pa'i khongs su 'dul signals macrocosmic containment.

Micro-macrocosm identity in deluded perception. Within beings' deluded appearance, even within one atom's scope appear immeasurable fields beyond count. Pure karma appearance shows great Buddha activities variously: passing beyond sorrow, teaching remaining, path accomplishment, etc. Impure experience shows teaching decline, lower realms appearance, eon destruction, happiness-suffering varieties. All like dream. The rdul phran re'i go na as scope of one atom signals infinite worlds within each point. Las dag pa'i snang ba denotes karmically purified perception revealing Buddha activity.

Epistemological status of appearances. Thus even within one atom's scope appearing as great fields with mountains, islands: beings' deluded appearance. Actually non-existent clear appearance, therefore tenable. 'Gro ba'i 'khrul snang as beings' deluded perception frames all experience as misperception. Don la med pa as actually non-existent signals emptiness. Gsal snang as clear appearance maintains luminous quality despite emptiness.

Scriptural citation from Samādhirāja Sūtra. Proofs of inconceivable Buddha-fields: within hair-tip space many Buddhas as Ganges sand-grains. Those victorious ones have equal number of fields. Different characteristics, unequal eons. Within hair-tip five realms: hell beings, animals, Yama world, gods, humans. Non-mixed, non-harmful. Those abodes with lakes and oceans, rivers, pools, non-mixed, non-harmful. Thus victorious ones' Dharma inconceivable. Those abodes many mountains: surrounding Meru, Sumeru, Btang zung, great Btang zung, Vulture Peak, Snow Mountain. There unbearable hell beings, hot and very hot, unpleasant. Those hell beings experience suffering. Those abodes gods' measureless palaces, twelve leagues delightful, thousands of gods experience great divine bliss. Those abodes Buddhas arise, world-knowing teachings blaze. Those same abodes Dharma declines, guide's passing beyond sound also heard. Impure beings in own homes like dream, enjoying desirable qualities, upon waking do not see those desires. Know that as dream. Thus seen, heard, known, distinguished, all these like dream, untrue. The detailed enumeration demonstrates simultaneous presence of contradictory realms within single space. Hair-tip as unit of measure signals microcosm containing macrocosm. Non-mixing despite proximity maintains karmic separateness.

Conclusion of citation. Thus within one dust-mote's world, within appearing subtle dusts also sentient being fields and arrangements immeasurable. Reiterates micro-macrocosm principle as established through scripture.
