[112-114]

RECOGNITION:
Assertion that all sentient being realms exist (sems can gyi khams thams cad yod) as training fields (gdul zhing). Vastness of fields including all four elements pervaded within great Brahma eon (tshangs chen gyi bskal pa'i khongs su 'dul). Cosmic inclusivity establishing universal scope of training.

Tantric/Dzogchen view - Universal training field

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 112: sems can gyi khams = sentient being realms
- Line 113: gdul zhing = training fields = place of maturation
- Line 114: sa chu me rlung = four elements + space

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Training field = entire cosmos as place of spiritual maturation
- Great Brahma eon = highest temporal container
- No realm excluded from training field

[115-122]

RECOGNITION:
Explanation of confusion-appearance ('khrul snang). Even single particle place (rdul phran re'i go na) contains immeasurable fields beyond measure. Pure karma appearances (las dag pa'i snang ba) show Buddha activities. Impure appearances: teaching decline, lower realms, eon destruction. All like dream (rmi lam lta bu).

VIEW REGISTER:
Dzogchen view - Confusion as appearance / Dream-like nature

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 115: 'khrul snang = confusion-appearance = karmic perception
- Line 116: las dag pa'i snang ba = pure karma appearances
- Line 119-121: Impure appearances enumerated
- Line 122: rmi lam lta bu = like dream = emptiness simile

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Appearance from karma = fundamental principle
- Single particle contains infinite fields = holographic cosmos
- Dream simile = emptiness of inherent existence

---

[123-124]

RECOGNITION:
Validation of appearance ('thad pa). Great fields appearing in single particle place are confusion-appearance of beings. Not existent in truth (don la med pa) yet clearly appearing (gsal snang) = valid cognition.

VIEW REGISTER:
Madhyamaka/Dzogchen view - Appearance-emptiness

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 123: ri dang gling = mountains and continents
- Line 124: don la med pa = not existent in ultimate
- 'thad pa = valid/reasonable = epistemological conclusion

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Appearance without inherent existence = Madhyamaka-Dzogchen synthesis
- Valid cognition = functional without true existence
- Confusion-appearance = functional yet empty

[125-161]

RECOGNITION:
Extensive citation from Samādhirāja Sūtra ('phags pa ting nge 'dzin rgyal po'i mdo). Classic presentation of coexisting realms: Buddhas as numerous as Ganges sands in hair-tip space (skra rtse'i khyon la'ang). Five realms in hair extent not mixing or harming. Mountains, oceans, lakes, pools coexisting without obstruction. Inconceivable Dharma. Dream analogy conclusion: all experience illusory.

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- Line 126: Explicit citation marker
- Line 127-128: skra rtse'i khyon = hair-tip space; gang+gA'i klung = Ganges river
- Line 134: 'dres pa med = not mixing
- Line 155-161: Dream analogy applied to all experience

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Samādhirāja Sūtra = authoritative Mahāyāna source
- Hair-tip = infinitesimal space containing infinite
- Dream conclusion = all experience illusory

[162]

RECOGNITION:
Synthesis statement. Single particle's world (rdul gcig gi go sa'i 'jig rten) containing subtle appearance particles (snang ba'i rdul phra ba) with immeasurable sentient being fields and arrangements. Holographic cosmos principle.

VIEW REGISTER:
Dzogchen view - Holographic cosmos

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- rdul gcig = single particle
- sems can gyi zhing = sentient being fields
- bkod pa = arrangements = cosmological structure

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Holographic principle = whole contained in part
- Infinite fields in finite space = non-dual geometry
- Sets up further cosmological elaboration
