[1740-1743] The text establishes a twofold division of faculties arising from form and wisdom aspects. This structural partition serves as the foundation for subsequent phenomenological analysis. The view register here operates at the interface of Sutric Abhidharma and Dzogchen sensibilities, where the six sense faculties are not merely categorized but positioned within a broader soteriological framework. Translation risks emerge in rendering dbang po as either "faculties" or "powers," with the latter potentially overdetermining the semantic field. Preservation requires maintaining the distinction between gzugs kyi cha and shes rab kyi cha as complementary rather than hierarchical categories.

[1744-1749] The enumeration of the six form-based faculties maps the classical elements to sensory capacities in a precise architectonic. Earth supports the eye through its stable, coarse nature; wind enables the ear through movement; water gathers scent; fire ripens taste; space pervades as the mental faculty; the body aggregates diversity. This elemental correlation reflects a Tantric substrate underlying the apparent Sutric presentation. The mapping requires careful attention to avoid anachronistic physiological interpretations that would displace the cosmological framework.

[1750-1756] The six wisdom faculties shift register from elemental correspondence to epistemic virtues. Faith arises from mental fervor, diligence from sharpness, mindfulness from unbroken attention, samadhi from manifesting emptiness, wisdom from approaching the view, and peace from generating non-conceptuality. This sequence traces a graduated path that could be mistaken for a linear progression rather than a simultaneous perfection. The preservation challenge lies in maintaining the Dzogchen resonance of sems rnam par zhi ba as transcending rather than merely calming mental activity.

[1757-1761] The fifth section introduces subject-object relations as the structural matrix of experience. The bifurcation into gzung ba and 'dzin pa constitutes the foundational illusion that the text will progressively deconstruct. The view here is quintessentially Yogacara in its initial formulation, yet the identification of objects as both apparent phenomena and empty nature begins the dialectical movement toward Madhyamaka. Translation must resist collapsing the distinction between chos can and chos nyid into simple appearance-emptiness dualism.

[1762-1767] The exposition of objects as beyond extremes establishes the middle way epistemology. Objects appear yet transcend reification; the supreme intelligence moves beyond expression. This is the transition point where Sutric analysis yields to Dzogchen directness. The twofold division into objects of phenomena and emptiness requires preservation of the yul/yul ma yin distinction without reducing it to a naive realism.

[1768-1776] The enumeration of apparent objects follows standard Abhidharma categories while preparing for their emptiness. Form, sound, scent, taste, phenomena, tactile appearances, the four elements, and distinct conditions of entry constitute the conventional domain. The structural function here is to exhaust the possible field of sensory engagement before demonstrating its illusory nature. Translation risks include over-literalizing 'byung ba chen po as "great elements" rather than recognizing their processual nature.

[1777-1781] The objects of emptiness encompass all emptinesses and the transcendence of reified consciousness. The second category of non-objects includes what is beyond extremes and what is beyond view. This is the pivot toward Dzogchen where the analysis itself is released. Preservation requires maintaining the apophatic momentum without falling into nihilistic interpretation.
