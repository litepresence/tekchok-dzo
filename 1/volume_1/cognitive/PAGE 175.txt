[6988-7011] The additional benefits from Rang shar include recognizing one's own appearances in the intermediate state, gaining stability in that recognition, and the capacity to emanate the nirmanakaya for twenty-one days. Those with supreme faculties will not experience suffering, fear, or terror, and at the time of practice, wisdom light will appear unceasingly—these are special qualities. Common benefits include understanding dakini speech, receiving dakini blessings, being seen as worthy of respect by humans, loving all beings, beautiful and pleasant appearance, increase of great merit, birth as a wheel-turning king after death, arising of great qualities like jewels, engaging in pure dharma like lotus, being seen as worthy of circumambulation like a stupa, surpassing ordinary beings like a parasol, and liberating beings with wisdom like fire. These and similar qualities numbering one hundred and eight arise, and all activities become accomplished, unobstructed by obstacles and misleading forces, with the signs of obtaining empowerment including many children and great prosperity, remembering previous lives, seeing beings taking birth, knowing others' minds, and subduing non-humans and demons.

These citations establish the necessity of the empowerment process as the foundation for all subsequent practice.
