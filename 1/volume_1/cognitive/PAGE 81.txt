[2994-3008] Second is external-various-appearing also produced from consciousness, aspects and consciousness subject-object one mind arising like cracked egg. Now when holding objects, though one external-aspect consciousness and one internal-holding consciousness arises, beginningless habits make two appear, yet self-awareness one only, no other establishment, like cracked egg. If so, when internal-holding consciousness arises regarding one external-aspect consciousness at that time, two knowledges become simultaneous? Not becoming: because that aspect-consciousness is non-conceptual. Third, though external-objects' aspects variously appear, one internal-holder consciousness knows, like quick monkey entering fort, four corners blurred appearing, looking-looking, one consciousness entering five doors knowing objects. When knowing, aspects and consciousness both are one mind's nature non-dual, like dream-appearances and holder self-appearances both non-dual with one sleep-consciousness.

Here classification: asserting defiled-false and undefiled-pure two. First is present various-aspect-appearances and that meeting-knowledge both merely mind's defilements appearing, ultimately non-dual wisdom with dharmadhatu's qualities merely existing; consciousness-establishment nothing exists.
