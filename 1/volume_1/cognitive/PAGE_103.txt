Structural function continues the external vastness exposition emphasizing the non-division of mind through absence of cause. View register asserts the natural state as spontaneously perfect great completion without partiality toward any vehicle. Translation risks obscure "gnas lugs ye rdzogs" as a specific technical classification. Preservation requirements note the phrase "gang yang ma spangs par yongs su rdzogs" establishes the non-rejection completion principle unique to dzogchen.

[3818-3827]
Structural function presents the secret vastness through recognizing obstacles to appearance as self-liberated pure nature. View register maintains the completion of memory and thought as dharmatā. Translation risks misrepresent "dran bsam rang dag" as mere purified thought rather than the technical process of thought recognizing its own nature. Preservation requirements ensure the distinction between outer and inner obstacles remains clear.

[3828-3837]
Structural function synthesizes the vastness categories into three divisions through the aspiration-arising great completion. View register presents the fourfold framework of view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. Translation risks conflate "bya spyod chos nyid du grol ba" with lower vehicle conduct concepts. Preservation requirements maintain the technical precision of "thob pa med pas ma thob pa rang la bzhag pa" as fruition without attainment.

[3838-3839]
Structural function concludes the action-free expanse through the principle of liberation without action. View register establishes "bya ba med pas grol bas grol" as the essential formulation. Translation risks render this as mere passivity rather than spontaneous liberation. Preservation requirements note this phrase encapsulates the entire klong dkar po section's essential meaning.
