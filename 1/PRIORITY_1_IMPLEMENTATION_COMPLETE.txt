## PARTIAL COMPLETION

### File 4: 02-19-01-01.txt - REQUIRES EXTENDED WORK
**Status:** Critical lines identified, full fix requires 2-3 additional hours
**Lines Identified:** 28 breathless tantra citations

**Critical Lines Found:**
- Line 6630 (file line 217): 72 words - tantra citation
- Line 6638 (file line 225): 85 words - tantra citation  
- Line 6670 (file line 256): 133 words - tantra citation
- Line 7078 (file line ~659): 338 words - EXTREME tantra citation

**Complexity:**
This file contains extended tantra quotations that require:
1. Breaking while preserving tantra citation markers
2. Maintaining verse structure and flow
3. Respecting the liturgical voice
4. Potential consultation with Tibetan source for caesura points

**Recommendation:**
Given the liturgical complexity of these tantra citations, the remaining fixes in 02-19-01-01.txt should be handled as:
- Priority 1A (this document): ✓ COMPLETE - 6 critical fixes done
- Priority 1B (extended): 28 tantra verse breaks - requires 2-3 hours focused work
