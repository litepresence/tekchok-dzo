**List of 28 short files to LEAVE AS IS:**
- 01-02-01-03.txt, 01-02-01-04.txt (2 lines each)
- 01-05-04-02.txt through 01-05-04-05.txt (1 line each)

### FORMATTING STANDARDIZATION

#### TANTRA CITATION FORMAT
**Standardize all to:**
```
<prose><tantra> From [Source]:
<verse> "First line of verse,
<verse> Second line of verse,
<verse> Third line of verse."
<verse> Thus it is said.
```

**Files needing review:**
- All files with tantra citations (check 50+ files)

**Consistency items:**
1. Quotation marks at start/end of verse blocks
2. "Thus it is said" placement (inside/outside verse tags)
3. Colon after source attribution

---

### VERSE FORMATTING

#### LINE BREAK ISSUE
**FILE:** 02-23-06-02.txt
**Line:** [14229]

**Current:**
```
[14228] <verse> Where exhausted, exhausted in one's own continuum; <verse>How exhausted? The appearance-rain of the above qualities <verse>Exhausted in the manner of dharmatā's purity.
```

**Fix:**
```
[14228] <verse> Where exhausted, exhausted in one's own continuum;
[14229] <verse> How exhausted? The appearance-rain of the above qualities
[14230] <verse> Exhausted in the manner of dharmatā's purity.
```

---

### LIST FORMATTING

#### STANDARDIZE LIST TAGS
**Ensure consistent use of:**
- `<list>` for enumerated items
- `<prose>` for descriptive text
- `<verse>` for poetic enumeration

**Review files with lists:**
- Chapter 1 (homage verses)
- Chapter 2 (cosmological lists)
- Chapter 4 (philosophical arguments)
- Chapter 6 (four convictions)
- Chapter 14 (wisdoms)
- Chapter 18 (mandala deities)

---

## PUNCTUATION STANDARDIZATION

### DASH USAGE
**Standard:** Use em-dash (—) not hyphen (-) for:
- Caesuras in verse
- Parenthetical breaks in prose
- Attributions before tantra citations

**Files to review:** All 213 files

### QUOTATION MARKS
**Standard:** Use straight quotes (") for:
- Tantra verse citations
- Direct speech
- Translated terms

**Check for consistency:** Mixed curly/straight quotes

### SEMICOLONS
**Usage:** In lists and compound sentences
**Review:** Ensure consistent application

---

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### After Priority 3 fixes:

**Check whitespace:**
```bash
grep -n "^\[.*\] <prose> $" *.txt | head -20
```

**Check isolated words:**
```bash
grep -n "Thus,$" *.txt
```

**Check XML tag balance:**
```bash
# Count opening/closing tags (approximate)
for file in *.txt; do
  prose_open=$(grep -o "<prose>" "$file" | wc -l)
  verse_open=$(grep -o "<verse>" "$file" | wc -l)
  tantra_open=$(grep -o "<tantra>" "$file" | wc -l)
  echo "$file: prose=$prose_open verse=$verse_open tantra=$tantra_open"
done
```

## TIME ESTIMATE

- Whitespace cleanup: 30 minutes
- Fragment fixes: 30 minutes
- Formatting standardization: 2 hours
- Punctuation review: 1 hour
- **Total: ~4 hours**
