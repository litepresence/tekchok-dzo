### QUALITY METRICS

✅ **Line Count Integrity:** 100% (all 26 files match Tibetan)
✅ **Data Loss:** None (all backups secure)
✅ **Byte Changes:** Minimal (mostly neutral or slight increases)
✅ **Metaphysical Accuracy:** Preserved without compromise
✅ **Tag Integrity:** All <verse>, <prose>, <tantra> maintained

**Sample Byte Changes (Session 3):**
- 02-23-01-01.txt: 19,319 → 19,340 bytes (+21)
- 01-13-01-01.txt: 18,141 → 18,142 bytes (+1)
- Other files: Minimal changes from batch patterns

### NEXT SESSION PLAN

**Priority 3 Remaining:** 34 files (20-29 long lines each)
- Continue batch processing
- Target: 10-12 files per session
- Estimated: 3-4 more sessions to complete Priority 3

**Then Priority 4:** 98 files (<20 long lines each)
- Light touch needed
- Batch patterns sufficient
- Estimated: 10-12 sessions

**Total Estimate:**
- Current: 16.5% complete
- Sessions completed: 3
- Sessions remaining: ~15-18
- Completion: On track

### MASTER VIMALAMITRA'S ASSESSMENT

**Progress Status: ACCELERATING**

Session 1: 7 files (4.4%)
Session 2: 6 files (3.8%)
Session 3: 13 files (8.2%) ← Doubled efficiency!

The batch processing strategy is proving highly effective. By applying consistent patterns across multiple files simultaneously, we're achieving greater throughput while maintaining quality.

**Key Insights:**
1. Batch patterns work well for common constructions
2. Priority 1 & 2 files required individual attention
3. Priority 3+ files can be batch processed efficiently
4. Line count preservation is 100% reliable

**The text is breathing more freely with each session.**

### VERSION 2.0 STATUS

**Completion: 16.5%**
- High-priority files (Priority 1-2): 100% ✓
- Medium-priority files (Priority 3): 24%
- Low-priority files (Priority 4): 0%

**Quality: EXCELLENT**
- No data loss
- No line count errors
- Metaphysics preserved
- Backups secure

**Estimated Completion:**
- 15-18 sessions remaining
- At current pace: achievable
