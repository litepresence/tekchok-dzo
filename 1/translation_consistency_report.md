# Translation Consistency Report
## For Khenpo Review

---

## SUMMARY

Comprehensive review of dictionary.md, glossary.md, liturgical, and cognitive layers for translation consistency.

---

## ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED

### 1. 'gzhi' Translation (Critical)
**Issue:** 'gzhi' was inconsistently translated as 'basis' instead of 'ground' in doctrinal contexts.

**Fixed in:**
- 57 liturgical files (~208 changes)
- 19 cognitive files (35 changes)

**Key corrections:**
- 'basis, path, and result' → 'ground, path, and result'
- 'primordial basis' → 'primordial ground'
- 'original basis' → 'primordial ground'
- 'one basis' → 'one ground'

### 2. 'ka dag' Translation
**Issue:** 'original purity' used instead of 'primordial purity'

**Fixed:** All 7 occurrences corrected to 'primordial purity'

### 3. Dictionary and Glossary Updated
**Added:**
- Critical note on gzhi vs kun gzhi distinction
- Entries for 'ground, path, and result' (gzhi lam 'bras bu)
- Entry for 'primordial ground' (ye gzhi)
- Additional terms: bardo, trekcho, thogal, bindu

## REMAINING ISSUE

### Liturgical Content Offset (Requires Full Review)

**Location:** 01-05-04-01.txt lines 5310-5315

**Issue:** Liturgical content does not match Wylie line numbers:
- Wylie 5311 = "When pure nirvana is explained"
- Liturgical 5311 = "When samsara and nirvana are both explained on one basis"
- Wylie 5314 = "When samsara and nirvana are explained on one ground"
- Liturgical 5314 = "When the result is explained"

**Status:** The translations appear shifted. This file needs realignment with Wylie source.

## FINAL STATISTICS

| Layer | 'ground' count | 'basis' count | Status |
|-------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Liturgical | 1,155 | 305 | Fixed |
| Cognitive | 478 | 89 | Fixed |

**Remaining 'basis' in liturgical:** Context-dependent uses (non-doctrinal contexts where 'basis' is acceptable).

---

## DOCTRINAL SIGNIFICANCE

In Dzogchen:
- **gzhi (ground)** = Primordial ground of all phenomena
- **kun gzhi (all-ground/kunzhi)** = Universal ground (ālaya)

Translating gzhi as "basis" loses this crucial distinction and can confuse readers about the Dzogchen view of ground as the primordial basis of both samsara and nirvana.

---

## FILES MODIFIED

### Dictionary
- protocol/dictionary.md (added gzhi note, additional terms)

### Glossary
- text/glossary.md (changed 'basis' to 'ground' entry)

### Liturgical (57 files)
- All files with doctrinal 'gzhi' references

### Cognitive (19 files)
- All files with doctrinal 'gzhi' references

## RECOMMENDATION

1. **Complete:** gzhi → ground fix in doctrinal contexts
2. **Complete:** ka dag → primordial purity fix
3. **Complete:** Dictionary and glossary updated
4. **Needs Review:** 01-05-04-01.txt line alignment
