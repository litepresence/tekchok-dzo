## Usage Notes

When revising or generating new content, reference these exemplars for:

1. **Literal Layer:** Maintain strict constraints—no articles, 1:1 word order, particle precision
2. **Liturgical Layer:** Balance elegance with precision—majestic but not flowery
3. **Commentary Layer:** Be earthy and direct—Patrul's voice is intimate, not academic
4. **Scholar Layer:** Use Four Pillars consistently—tag all analysis

**Remember:** These are "best of the best" but still first drafts. Second and third drafts will refine further.

## ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN KHENPO REVIEW

### February 7, 2026 - COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT WITH EXTENDED SAMPLING

**Review Scope:** 
- Volume 1: Pages 1-15, 25-30, 50, 95-110, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400
- Volume 2: Pages 1-10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 350-415
**Total Pages Sampled:** 40+ pages across all available layers
**Audit Method:** Systematic head-check of literal layer files for Wylie contamination

---

### CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE CORRECTION

#### Literal Layer - WYLIE CONTAMINATION (CONFIRMED)

**VOLUME 1 - Affected Pages (7 total):**

1. **PAGE 3.txt** - Single page contamination
   - Contains Wylie: "de'i gnas nges-pa ni 'od-gsal rdo-rje snying-po'i bstan-pa ste/"

2. **PAGES 95-100.txt** - Consecutive block (6 pages)
   - PAGE 95: Wylie text
   - PAGE 96: Wylie text
   - PAGE 97: Wylie text
   - PAGE 98: Wylie text
   - PAGE 99: Wylie text
   - PAGE 100: Wylie text ("chos-nyid la brjod-du med-pa'i klong-dang")

**VOLUME 2 - Affected Pages (15+ total):**

Extensive contamination in final section (pages 350-415):
- PAGE 350: Wylie
- PAGE 375: Wylie
- PAGE 385: Wylie
- PAGE 395: Wylie
- PAGES 398-403: Consecutive block (6 pages)
- PAGE 405: Wylie
- PAGE 410: Wylie
- PAGE 415: Wylie

**Estimated Total Contamination:** 22+ pages (2.5% of total 894 pages)

**Root Cause:** 
- Files were never translated (remained as Wylie placeholders)
- OR incorrectly copied from Wylie folder to Literal folder
- OR translation process failed silently

**Impact:** 
- **CRITICAL** - These represent gaps in the primary translation layer
- Commentary and Scholar layers cannot proceed on these pages until Literal is fixed
- Project integrity compromised until remediated

**Remediation Required:**
1. Generate English literal translations for all 22+ affected pages
2. Full audit of remaining pages to identify any additional contamination
3. Verify all 894 pages have actual English translations

### MODERATE ISSUES - Quality Refinement Needed

#### Literal Layer - Particle and Grammar

**PAGE 2.txt, Line 36:**
- **Issue:** "teacher five-complete possessing dominion-complete all-victorious samantabhadra with wisdom-ocean assembly together/"
- **Problems:**
  - "five-complete" should be "five-perfections" (more accurate term)
  - Hyphenation inconsistent
  - Word order slightly disrupted
- **Standard:** "teacher five-perfections possessing dominion-complete all-victorious samantabhadra wisdom-ocean assembly together/"

**PAGE 5.txt, Line 112:**
- **Issue:** "sentient-beings realm all exist/"
- **Problems:**
  - Article "all" should be omitted per prompt constraints
  - "sentient-beings" should be "sentient-being" (singular compound)
- **Standard:** "sentient-being realm exist/"

#### Liturgical Layer - Flow and Consistency

**General Observations:**
- **Sentence Length:** Some passages exceed 40 words (guideline: rare)
  - Example: PAGE 8.txt, Line 221 (complex sentence on five-family Buddhas)
  - **Impact:** May reduce chantability
  - **Recommendation:** Break into shorter rhythmic phrases

**Hyphenation Inconsistencies:**
- "great-Brahma" vs "great Brahma" (PAGE 4.txt)
- "self-arisen" vs "self arisen" (various pages)
- **Recommendation:** Standardize hyphenation rules

---

### COMMENDABLE QUALITY - MAINTAIN STANDARDS

#### Commentary Layer - OUTSTANDING

**Overall Assessment:** The Commentary layer is the strongest component of the project.

**Strengths:**
1. **Patrul Rinpoche voice fully activated** - Direct, earthy, piercing
2. **Line range references accurate** - Easy navigation to source
3. **No scholarly hedging** - "Listen to this!" not "This might suggest..."
4. **Tangible metaphors throughout:**
   - "tipping your hat to a stranger" (PAGE 1)
   - "fingers pointing to the moon" (PAGE 2)
   - "This isn't a census report!" (PAGE 6)
   - "You who are always trying to get somewhere" (PAGE 50)

5. **Transformative closures:**
   - "Stop reading and look"
   - "All of this is happening now, in your own experience"
   - "Do not postpone this!"

**Training Potential:** Commentary layer should be used as training exemplar for future Patrul Rinpoice voice generation

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT REVIEW

#### Priority 1 (Immediate):
1. Fix all Wylie files misplaced in literal folder
2. Systematic article removal sweep in literal layer
3. Standardize hyphenation across all layers

#### Priority 2 (Quality Polish):
4. Review sentence length in liturgical layer (target <40 words)
5. Verify page bleed continuity at major transitions
6. Cross-check Dzogchen terminology consistency

#### Priority 3 (Maintenance):
7. Continue batch review through remaining 872 pages
8. Document additional exemplars as discovered
9. Update master glossary based on findings
