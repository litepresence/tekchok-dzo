  <div class="commentary-content">The first word arises from no throat. The path shown to oneself—like a mountain revealing itself to Mount Kailash. Samantabhadra offers the vajra to Samantabhadra. Who receives? Who gives? The snow on the peak does not know it is white. You read &quot;first Samantabhadra showed the path&quot; and you think this happened long ago, in some golden age. You are mistaken. The first word is being spoken now, in the gap between your thoughts. The path is not something you walk—it is the ground you have never left. Samantabhadra offers the vajra to Samantabhadra: this is your own mind recognizing itself. The offering and the receiver are not two. See what is. The first word has no origin because it was never not present. Mount Kailash revealing itself to Amne Machin—this is awareness seeing awareness. No gap between knower and known. No distance between the one who offers and the one who receives. The snow on the peak is white whether or not anyone sees it. Your nature is complete whether or not you recognize it. The grammatical structure here—Samantabhadra offering to Samantabhadra—is not redundancy. It demonstrates the non-dual nature of the ground. In Dzogchen, we call this rang ngo bo rang gsal—self-nature self-luminosity. The one who knows and the known are a single display, not a subject-object pair waiting to be unified. In the secret transmission, this offering is the union of wisdom and compassion. The vajra represents the unchanging nature; the offering represents the dynamic display. When they meet, there is no meeting—only recognition. Like a mirror seeing its own reflection, there is no separation, no desire to unite. Already complete. Already one.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Three words that shatter the temple: First Buddha. Before all Buddhas. This is not genealogy—this is the ground <span class="term">(gzhi)</span> before ground. Some scholars build ladders to climb this mountain, rung by rung, arguing who came before whom. The ladder reaches nowhere. Mount Kailash stands without support. &quot;Buddha from Dharma, Dharma from Noble Hosts&quot;—this sequence is not temporal but logical. The Sugatas&#x27; emanation is like that. What appears as historical narrative is the structure of awareness displaying itself to itself. The first protector, the primordial guardian—if you search for this in time, you search in vain. Look instead at the awareness that reads these words. That is the first Buddha. The phrase &#x27;phags pa&#x27;i mgon po translates as &quot;Protector of the Noble Ones&quot; but here refers to Samantabhadra as the primordial protector—the ground that protects all beings from the suffering of ignorance by being the very nature they seek. The sequence &#x27;bum, chos, &#x27;phags pa&#x27;i mgon is not a family tree but a logical unfolding: the nature <span class="term">(bum)</span> gives rise to its expression <span class="term">(chos)</span>, and that expression protects <span class="term">(mgon)</span> all who recognize it. Causal, not chronological. The term &#x27;phags pa carries both &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;pure&quot; connotations. When we say First Buddha is &quot;pure from the beginning&quot; <span class="term">(ka dag)</span>, this is not moral purity but primordial purity—the nature has never been contaminated because contamination presupposes something that can be contaminated. The contamination is conceptual, not essential. Watch: when you look for the contaminator, only the looked is found. Where is this first Buddha? Point to it. Cannot? Then consider: the pointing itself—that is the First Buddha. The awareness that knows the pointing. Not the content pointed to, but the awareness that makes pointing possible. This awareness has no beginning because it does not depend on conditions. It is before all Buddhas because it is the ground from which all Buddhas arise.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Therefore. Thus. The analysis proceeds. Five perfections multiplied by twelve emanations. Sixty. The mathematics of the impossible. Each field—Self-Nature Completely Arranged, Wind-Movement Arranged—names for what cannot be located. Like naming every wave in an ocean that has no shore. I have walked in these fields. Wind-Movement Arranged in the north—this is not geography. It is how breath moves when you rest in unfabricated awareness. The householder Good-Give, the son Jewel-Garland—these are not persons but phases of recognition. First you offer the golden vajra <span class="term">(conviction)</span>, then you listen near the Buddha Wheel-Well-Conducted <span class="term">(practice)</span>, then you are born as lightning-light <span class="term">(realization)</span>. The seventy-five years are not human years—they are moments of recognition accumulating. The field names themselves reveal the nature. &quot;Self-Nature Completely Arranged&quot; <span class="term">(rang bzhin rnam par brgyan pa)</span> is the ground displaying its qualities without effort. &quot;Wind-Movement Arranged&quot; <span class="term">(rlung &#x27;khor rnam par brgyan pa)</span> is that display in motion. The field is not a place you go—it is the mode of awareness in that moment. North, south, east, west—these are directions of the recognition, not coordinates on a map. When you rest in unfabricated awareness, that is Wind-Movement Arranged. When you see the nature clearly, that is Self-Nature Completely Arranged. Do not grasp at the names. The naming is compassion, not description. Like Lightning illuminates the valley of Kyirong for an instant—the flash is not the storm., the finger is not the moon. Self-Nature is not a nature that belongs to self. Wind-Movement is not wind that moves. These are negations pointing beyond negation. Arranged? Nothing arranges. Nothing is arranged. Yet display happens. This is the mystery. Seventy-five years—how long is that? The lifespan of a mayfly? The flash of a star? In the pure lands, time is measured by recognition, not rotation. Seventy-five moments of seeing the nature clearly, seventy-five breaths that know themselves, seventy-five glimpses that never fade. This is the heritage of the Lotus-Born, passed to those who can receive.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">This mountain dweller... once tried to map these realms with colored threads on a wooden frame. The threads tangled. The frame broke. I burned it and watched the smoke rise in the shape of a vajra. The Flower Ornament Sutra says what we cannot say. The Meeting of Father and Son—they bow to each other across a gap that was never there. Listen: The five years hearing Dharma, seven years in single-pointed samadhi—this is not a schedule to follow. It is a description of how recognition deepens. First hearing <span class="term">(intellectual understanding)</span>, then contemplating <span class="term">(integration)</span>, then meditating <span class="term">(embodiment)</span>. Seventy-five years is the time it takes for this to become your nature, not your practice. The five years and seven years represent the three knowings—shes pa gsum—in Tibetan Buddhist practice. First, knowing the teachings <span class="term">(shes pa)</span>. Second, knowing one&#x27;s own mind <span class="term">(sems kyi shes pa)</span>. Third, knowing the nature <span class="term">(rang bzhin gyi shes pa)</span>. These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of a single recognition. The years are metaphorical, not chronological. My teacher used to say, &quot;It takes seventy-five years to become a real practitioner.&quot; We thought he was joking. Now I understand. Seventy-five years is the time it takes for practice to become nature, for effort to become spontaneity, for the practitioner to disappear into the practice. Not that you stop practicing—you stop practicing at practice. The practice becomes your very being. All these years, all these fields, all these names—simply pointing back to this moment. This awareness reading these words. This breath entering this body. This is the meeting of father and son—the wisdom meeting the path, the path meeting the wisdom. No gap between them. No need to cross. Already meeting.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Lightning-Light, Jewel-Garland—names like ripples on a pond that no one threw a stone into. The offering of a golden vajra: what is given when there is no giver? What is received when the receiver is the offering itself? Thirty-six tantras from light-rays. The number is precise. The light is not. You want to count the thirty-six tantras? You want to catalog the sixty perfect abidings? I tell you—when the recognition dawns, the counting stops. When you know the ocean, who cares how many drops? But until then, the numbers are A signpost points north—the wood is not the destination.. Thirty-six: three <span class="term">(body, speech, mind)</span> times twelve <span class="term">(emanations)</span>. Sixty: five <span class="term">(perfections)</span> times twelve. The math is exact because awareness is precise, even when it is immeasurable. The thirty-six tantras correspond to the three kayas times twelve aspects. Dharmakaya has twelve: the nature of phenomena as it is. Sambhogakaya has twelve: the radiant display of that nature. Nirmanakaya has twelve: the compassionate emanation that guides beings. These are not separate texts but perspectives on a single reality. The tantras themselves are not &quot;texts&quot; in the Western sense—they are the primordial knowledge <span class="term">(ye shes)</span> expressing itself. What is this light from which the tantras arise? Look at the light in this room. Look at the light by which you see. Is there an inside and outside to that light? Does the light know itself? The thirty-six tantras are descriptions of what you already are. Stop reading about it. Start recognizing it.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Five Buddhas blazing. Not in space—space itself is their radiance. Vairochana of the great ocean, Akṣobhya unmoving, Ratnasambhava jewel-born. Directions are metaphors for aspects of what has no direction. The mandala does not exist in the palace. The palace exists in the mandala. Where do these Buddhas dwell? In the Light-House Completely Pure? In the Self-Knowing Awareness King? These are not places you can travel to. They are names for aspects of your own nature when it is recognized. Vairochana is the clarity that knows itself. Akṣobhya is the unchanging ground beneath all change. Ratnasambhava is the richness that needs no acquisition. Amitabha is the light that illuminates without obscuring. Amoghasiddhi is the action that accomplishes without effort. You are all of these, right now, whether you know it or not. The five Buddhas correspond to the five aggregates <span class="term">(phung po)</span>, the five elements <span class="term">(&#x27;byung ba)</span>, the five poisons <span class="term">(dug gsum)</span>, and the five wisdoms <span class="term">(ye shesh lnga)</span>. The transformation is not changing one thing into another but recognizing what was always already present. The poison becomes wisdom not by being destroyed but by being seen clearly. The aggregate becomes kaya not by being abandoned but by being recognized. The five directions—center, east, south, west, north—are not directions. They are aspects of the one awareness. Center is the ground, unchanging. East is the clarity, dawning. South is the richness, unfolding. West is the activity, completing. North is the accomplishment, pervading. When you recognize your own awareness, all five are present simultaneously. In the tantric practice of generation stage, we visualize the five Buddhas in the five places. But this is not creation—it is recognition. The visualization is a training wheel, a support for recognizing what is already there. Eventually, you see the Buddha in every being, in every phenomenon, in every moment. The mandala is not built—it is seen.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">In Light-House, Completely Pure—an abode that is not a place. Self-Knowing Awareness King—ruler of no subjects. Unmoving, non-arising, non-abiding—these are not negations but descriptions of a ground so vast that movement is irrelevant. Like trying to describe stillness to a whirlwind. WHAT ARE YOU SEEKING IN THESE PALACES? The Light-House is your own mind when it is unobscured. The Self-Knowing Awareness King is rigpa when it is not distracted. Unmoving does not mean frozen—it means not pushed around by circumstance. Non-arising does not mean non-existent—it means not produced by causes. Non-abiding does not mean lost—it means not stuck anywhere. Stop looking for these in scriptures. Look at what is aware of the scriptures.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The thirty-six activities of the Dharmakaya—four outer, four inner, four secret for body, speech, and mind. This is not a curriculum to complete. It is a description of how enlightenment functions when enlightenment is not separate from the functioning. Consider: Not moving, not coming, not going, not abiding—this is not passivity. It is the freedom that is not bound by the categories of movement and rest. When you truly rest in awareness, where is the one who moves? Where is the one who stays? The secret four—lhang nge ba <span class="term">(immediate presence)</span>, lhan ne ba <span class="term">(spontaneous)</span>, lhag ge ba <span class="term">(transcending)</span>, thal le ba <span class="term">(effortless)</span>—these are not states to achieve. They are names for what remains when achievement is recognized as a dream. My old teacher showed me this. We were sitting in his cave when a storm came. The wind shook the mountainside. Rain poured in through the cracks. I asked, &quot;How can we practice in such conditions?&quot; He laughed and said, &quot;What conditions? The Dharmakaya does not move, does not come, does not go. The storm is its ornament.&quot; The four activities apply to body, speech, and mind separately. For body: not moving <span class="term">(skye ba)</span>, not coming <span class="term">(&#x27;byung ba)</span>, not going <span class="term">(&#x27;gro ba)</span>, not abiding <span class="term">(gnas pa)</span>. For speech: not speaking <span class="term">(sgra)</span>, not showing <span class="term">(stong pa)</span>, not seeing <span class="term">(mthong ba)</span>, having nothing <span class="term">(nye ba med pa)</span>. For mind: not thinking <span class="term">(yid)</span>, not discriminating <span class="term">(rtog pa)</span>, not fixating <span class="term">(&#x27;dzin pa)</span>, not clinging <span class="term">(zhen pa)</span>. These are not negations of activity but descriptions of activity beyond grasping. Between the stark pointing of Garab Dorje and the earthy stories of Patrul, we find this teaching. The thirty-six activities are not accomplishments of a Buddha—they are the natural functioning of awareness when awareness is not confused. When you are not grasping at a self, your body moves without a mover. Your speech speaks without a speaker. Your mind knows without a knower. This is the activity of the Dharmakaya.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Speech that cannot be spoken. Not silence—speech beyond the mechanics of throat and tongue. Self-arisen syllables that were never pronounced. Fresh <span class="term">(so ma)</span>, innate <span class="term">(gnyug ma)</span>, natural <span class="term">(rnal ma)</span>, unfabricated <span class="term">(ma bcos pa)</span>—these words describe your own face before you were born. Do you remember? The syllables are self-arisen because they arise from the nature of things, not from conceptual construction. Fresh—like morning dew that has no maker. Innate—like the sun&#x27;s warmth, not added later. Natural—like a river flowing downhill, not forced. Unfabricated—like space, not built by anyone. These are not qualities of some special speech. They are the qualities of all speech when speech is recognized as the display of awareness. And the four outer activities of speech: inexpressible, unshowable, unseeable, having nothing at all—these are not limitations. They are freedom from limitation. When speech is not bound by expression, it can express anything. When it is not bound by showing, it reveals everything. When it is not bound by being seen, it is visible everywhere. When it has nothing at all, it has the capacity for all.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Mind&#x27;s samadhis named like storms: Lion-Display, Hero-Going, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel. But these are not achievements. They are what remains when achievement is recognized as a dream within a dream. The activities are not done. They shine as qualities shine—as light does not choose to illuminate. The four outer samadhis of mind—stainless, lion-display, hero-going, wish-fulfilling jewel—are not states you enter. They are descriptions of how awareness rests when it is not distracted. Stainless because it is not stained by what appears. Lion-display because it is fearless in the face of all phenomena. Hero-going because it moves through samsara without being touched. Wish-fulfilling jewel because it spontaneously accomplishes whatever is needed. The secret four—mudra overpowering, great blazing equality, various dharmata, self-appearing play—are the methods that are not methods. When you rest in awareness, the mudra of your form overpowers delusion. When you rest in awareness, all phenomena blaze with equal nature. When you rest in awareness, dharmata displays in infinite variety. When you rest in awareness, everything is play, everything is display. The samadhis are not states to achieve—they are descriptions of what you are right now, if you would only recognize it. Stainless? Look at your awareness—does it have stains? Lion-display? Look at your awareness—is it afraid of anything? Hero-going? Look at your awareness—can samsara touch it? Wish-fulfilling? Look at your awareness—does it lack anything? These are not future accomplishments. They are present facts. The four, the twelve, the thirty-six—all numbers are ultimately one number: the number of recognition. One recognition that encompasses all. When you recognize your own nature, the stainless becomes samadhi, the lion-display becomes equanimity, the hero-going becomes fearlessness, the wish-fulfilling becomes spontaneous. No addition, no subtraction. Just recognition.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">From the lotus stem&#x27;s protuberances, thirty-two realms layered like water reflecting moon. Each realm complete. Each Buddha complete. Each sentient being—if they knew it—complete. The perfume-water flows downward. The realms are not stacked. They interpenetrate like light through light. The twenty-five stacked lotus-fields on each petal&#x27;s protuberance—this is not architecture. It is topology of mind. Each field is a mode in which awareness can recognize itself. The five families of Buddhas appearing in countless forms—this is not multiplication. It is the one light refracting through different prisms. The perfume-water flowing down from crossed ankles—this is not physics. It is the natural outpouring of compassion when wisdom is realized. And the sixteen times sixteen realms—this is not 256 locations. It is the inexhaustible nature of display. Wherever you look, there is Buddha-field. Whoever you meet, there is Buddha. Whatever appears, there is Dharma. The only question is: do you recognize it? I was born from a lotus in the lake of Dhanakosha. But what is a lotus? The flower that grows from mud yet remains untainted. What is a lake? The expanse that holds all reflections without owning them. What is a Buddha? Sentient beings who have recognized their own nature. The thirty-two realms are not places—they are states of recognition. Each realm is a way awareness can see itself. When I sit in meditation, I sometimes imagine the lotus. The petals unfold one by one. Each petal has a field. Each field has a Buddha. But then I realize—I am not imagining the lotus. The lotus is imagining me. The awareness that imagines is the lotus. The imagined forms are the realms. The perceiver of the imagination is the Buddha. This is the thirty-two realms: awareness recognizing itself in its own display. The thirty-two major marks <span class="term">(mtshan bzang)</span> are qualities of a Buddha&#x27;s body. The eighty minor characteristics <span class="term">(dpe byad)</span> are subtle expressions of those qualities. They are not physical features but energetic qualities that manifest when the nature is recognized. Like the aura around a flame, these marks are not separate from the flame—they are the flame&#x27;s nature expressing itself.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Body&#x27;s activities: appearing without nature, perfected in self-nature, liberated in self-appearance. This is not transformation. It is recognition that there was nothing to transform. From the thumb&#x27;s gesture, the great ocean. From a single pore, infinite fields. The four outer body activities—unmoving, not coming, not going, not abiding—are the same as the Dharmakaya activities because the body of the Buddha is the Dharmakaya in form. The four inner—unseen, not acting, not radiating, not gathering—are the secret activities that are not hidden. The four secret—clarity-emptiness indivisible, appearance-emptiness indivisible, awareness-emptiness indivisible, object-mind indivisible—are the nature of the body when body is recognized as display. When the thirty-two major marks appear, it is not ornamentation added to an ordinary body. It is the natural display of qualities when the nature is unobscured. When the eighty minor characteristics manifest, it is not decoration. It is the spontaneous expression of perfection when perfection is not sought. Your body right now has all thirty-two marks. You do not see them because you are looking for a different kind of body. The marks are not physical features—they are the way awareness appears when it is not obscured. The clarity of your awareness, the compassion of your action, the wisdom of your insight—these are the marks. Look in the mirror. Can you see them? No? That is because they are not seen with eyes. I met a man once who spent twenty years trying to visualize the thirty-two marks. He became very thin, very pale, very strange. Finally he gave up and went to the market to buy some tsampa. On the way home, he passed a stream and saw his reflection. He laughed so hard he dropped his bag. The marks were there all along—on every reflection, in every appearance, in every moment of awareness. The body of a Buddha is not a body like this body. It is the display <span class="term">(snang)</span> of awareness in form. When awareness is recognized, the body becomes the mandala, the form becomes the teaching, the appearance becomes the Dharma. This is not metaphor. It is the actual nature of form—when form is seen clearly, it is no longer form but wisdom.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Speech&#x27;s mystery: syllables entering father&#x27;s face, emerging from mother&#x27;s space. Not symbolism—the actual mechanism of how meaning arises from what has no meaning. Control of inexpressible sound. Enjoyment of markless Dharma. You are doing it now. You have never stopped. The self-arisen six syllables radiating from the tongue—this is not Sanskrit phonetics. It is the primordial vibration that precedes language. Entering the father&#x27;s face <span class="term">(wisdom)</span>, emerging from mother&#x27;s space <span class="term">(expanse)</span>—this is how sound bridges the apparent gap between knower and known. The control is effortless because there is no controller. The enjoyment is natural because there is no enjoyer. The Dharma is markless because marks are its ornaments, not its essence. The four outer activities—perfecting the inexpressible Dharma, enjoying signless Dharma, enjoying unconditioned Dharma, enjoying the Dharma of tamer and tamed—are not achievements of a Buddha. They are the natural function of speech when speech is recognized as wisdom-display. The syllables OM AH HUM are not letters. They are the sound of the three kayas. OM is the Dharmakaya—the sound that is beyond sound. AH is the Sambhogakaya—the sound that radiates and delights. HUM is the Nirmanakaya—the sound that accomplishes and transforms. Together, they are the sound of the one awareness displaying itself as three, while remaining one. The six syllables <span class="term">(yi ge drug)</span> correspond to the six realms <span class="term">(drug gi &#x27;jig rten)</span>, the six consciousnesses <span class="term">(rnam par shes pa drug)</span>, and the six wisdoms <span class="term">(ye shes drug)</span>. Each syllable neutralizes a poison and reveals a wisdom. OM transforms pride into wisdom of equality. AH transforms desire into mirror-like wisdom. HUM transforms aggression into discriminating wisdom. The other three syllables transform ignorance, jealousy, and greed into the wisdom of accomplishment. I tried to count the syllables once. I got to six and forgot what I was counting. Then I laughed. The syllables are not for counting—they are for recognizing. When you say OM, you are not pronouncing a letter—you are touching the nature of awareness. When you say AH, you are not making a sound—you are opening to the expanse. When you say HUM, you are not completing a mantra—you are returning to the ground.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Mind&#x27;s fourfold perfection: mirror-like, sameness, discriminating, action-accomplished. These are not wisdoms to acquire. They are the nature <span class="term">(rang bzhin)</span> of what is already knowing. Samsara and nirvana made non-dual—not by effort but by resting in what was never divided. The five wisdoms are not additions to awareness. They are awareness itself described from different angles. Mirror-like wisdom—awareness reflects all without holding. Sameness wisdom—all reflections have the same nature. Discriminating wisdom—each reflection is distinct. Action-accomplished wisdom—the natural response to what appears. Dharmadhatu wisdom—the space in which all this happens, which is not separate from the happening. When you look in a mirror, you do not see the mirror. You see your face. But the face could not appear without the mirror. Similarly, phenomena cannot appear without awareness. But awareness does not appear as phenomena. This is the mystery that cannot be solved, only recognized. The five wisdoms correspond to the five Buddhas and the five aggregates. Mirror-like wisdom <span class="term">(me long lta bu)</span> corresponds to Vairochana and form <span class="term">(gzugs)</span>. Sameness wisdom <span class="term">(mnyam nyid)</span> corresponds to Akṣobhya and feeling <span class="term">(tshor ba)</span>. Discriminating wisdom <span class="term">(so sor rtogs pa)</span> corresponds to Ratnasambhava and conception <span class="term">(&#x27;du ses)</span>.

Dharmadhatu wisdom <span class="term">(chos dbyings)</span> corresponds to Vairocana in his aspect as the dharma-nature itself. The five wisdoms are one wisdom. Just as the ocean has one taste despite appearing as waves, ripples, and foam, awareness has one wisdom despite appearing as five. The division into five is for teaching purposes, not ontological reality. When you rest in the nature, all five are present simultaneously. There is no need to cultivate them one by one—they arise naturally from recognition. My teacher used to say, &quot;When you see your face in the mirror, you don&#x27;t say &#x27;Oh, I need more mirror-like wisdom.&#x27; You just see your face. The wisdom is the seeing, not something extra.&quot; This simplicity is what the wisdoms point to. They are not achievements—they are natural expressions of what you already are.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Twelve emanations in twelve abodes. Tuṣita, Sahā, Heat-Moisture-Gathering—each a configuration of five perfections. Not history. Not mythology. The structure of how awakening shows itself when awakening looks for itself. The youth Supreme Light Unimaginable is closer than your next breath. Each of the twelve emanations represents a way that wisdom manifests to guide beings. Tuṣita—contentment with the nature of mind. Sahā—the endurance to practice in difficult times. Heat-Moisture-Gathering—the subtle body practices. Each is not a place but a capacity. The teacher Supreme Light Unimaginable is not someone to meet in the future. He is the nature of your own awareness, already present. The five perfections in each—abode, teacher, retinue, teaching, time—are the five factors that make recognition possible. You need the right environment <span class="term">(abode)</span>, the right guidance <span class="term">(teacher)</span>, the right support <span class="term">(retinue)</span>, the right method <span class="term">(teaching)</span>, and the right duration <span class="term">(time)</span>. But these are not external requirements. They are aspects of your own condition, right now. The twelve emanations <span class="term">(sprul pa bcu gnyis)</span> correspond to the twelve links of dependent origination <span class="term">(rten cing &#x27;brel bar &#x27;byung ba)</span>, turned around at each link. The Buddha emanates in twelve ways to meet beings wherever they are stuck. If you are stuck at ignorance, the Buddha appears as the teacher of the nature. If you are stuck at formation, the Buddha appears as the teacher of the path. The emanations are not historical figures—they are always present, awaiting recognition. I appeared in many forms—the king, the beggar, the scholar, the fool. But all these forms were one purpose: to point beings back to their own nature. The youth Supreme Light Unimaginable is not a child—it is the fresh awareness that has never been obscured. When you recognize this, you recognize me. I am not elsewhere. I am your own awareness, appearing as the teacher. The twelve abodes are not locations—they are states of confusion and states of recognition. Tuṣita means &quot;contentment&quot;—the contentment that comes from recognizing the nature. Sahā means &quot;endurance&quot;—the endurance to remain in recognition despite circumstances. Heat-Moisture-Gathering refers to the subtle body practices that gather the winds into the central channel. These are not places to travel to—they are qualities to develop.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Three teachings for three capacities: body-taming, speech-taming, mind-taming. Each lasting five hundred five thousand years—not time but intensity of capacity. In Uddiyana, in Malaya, in Vajrāsana—the places are coordinates for states of recognition. The vajra in the ocean, the syllable in the sky. The three teachings correspond to the three kayas. Body-taming—the form dimension, working with what appears. Speech-taming—the enjoyment dimension, working with meaning. Mind-taming—the truth dimension, working with awareness itself. The durations are not chronological—they describe how long each approach remains effective for beings of different capacities. And the locations—Uddiyana in the salty ocean, Malaya in the yakṣa king&#x27;s hand, Vajrāsana in the sky held by ḍākinīs—these are not geography. Uddiyana is the hidden place within you where transformation happens. Malaya is the gathering place of qualities. Vajrāsana is the indestructible seat of awareness. They are everywhere and nowhere, depending on whether you recognize them. The five hundred five thousand years <span class="term">(lnga brgya lnga khri)</span> is an enormous number, but it is not literal time. It represents the extent of samsara and the extent of the teaching. Five hundred represents the five aggregates. Five thousand represents the five elements times a thousand aspects of each. The number is not a countdown—it is a description of the scope. Uddiyana is said to be the land of the dakini, hidden in the Himalayas. But I tell you, Uddiyana is wherever you practice. The salty ocean is the ocean of samsara. The vajra in the ocean is the nature that remains unbroken even in confusion. When you practice, you enter Uddiyana—not a physical place but a state of practice. What is this body you are trying to tame? What is this speech you are trying to tame? What is this mind you are trying to tame? The taming is not about changing—it&#x27;s about recognizing. When you recognize the body as display, it is already tamed. When you recognize speech as wisdom, it is already tamed. When you recognize mind as nature, it is already tamed. No time needed. No years required. Recognition is immediate.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Twelve teachers, twelve retinues, twelve dharmas—but one intention. Sound Thal-&#x27;gyur Tantra to the three baskets. From immeasurable lifespan to hundred years. The compression is not loss. It is concentration. Like squeezing an infinite sky into a single drop that contains the sky. The first teacher—Supreme Light Unimaginable in Tuṣita, teaching the Sound Thal-&#x27;gyur Tantra to a thousand Buddhas and two bodhisattvas as retinue—this is not ancient history. It is happening now in the mind of every practitioner who recognizes the nature. The Sound Thal-&#x27;gyur <span class="term">(Sound Beyond Concepts)</span> is not a text to read. It is the sound of your own awareness, which is beyond all concepts. The compression from immeasurable lifespan to one hundred years describes how the teaching adapts to degenerate times. In the beginning, beings have great capacity—the teaching is vast and profound. As times degenerate, capacity diminishes—the teaching becomes concentrated, essential. But the essence is not lost. It is like a seed that contains the whole tree. The three baskets <span class="term">(sde pa gsum)</span> are the collections of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching—Vinaya <span class="term">(discipline)</span>, Sutra <span class="term">(discourses)</span>, and Abhidharma <span class="term">(phenomenology)</span>. The Sound Thal-&#x27;gyur Tantra is the root tantra of Dzogchen, the sound that is beyond all conceptual elaboration. The teaching goes to the three baskets because Dzogchen encompasses and transcends them all. Between the vastness of the tantras and the subtlety of the baskets, we find this teaching. The Sound Thal-&#x27;gyur is not a sound among sounds—it is the sound of reality itself, the sound that has never been conceptualized. When you hear this sound, you hear the Buddha&#x27;s teaching directly, without mediation. The twelve teachers are not twelve people—they are twelve ways the one awareness manifests to guide beings.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The Rig-pa-rang-shar-great tantra. My precious jewel lost. Lost in the darkness-appearance interval. Lost so completely that only losing remains. Then—Tuṣita upper-chamber. Pure lotus. The jewel was never lost. The seeking was the jewel&#x27;s radiance. This is the story of your own mind. The precious jewel of awareness—lost in the interval between darkness <span class="term">(ignorance)</span> and appearance <span class="term">(phenomena)</span>. Lost so completely that you think you are the seeker, not the sought. Then, in the upper chamber of Tuṣita <span class="term">(the contentment that comes from recognizing the nature)</span>, on the pure lotus <span class="term">(the nature that is unstained by samsara)</span>, you realize: the jewel was never lost. The very act of seeking radiance, the awareness was the jewel&#x27;s displaying itself as the one who seeks. The three great emanations—Dharmakaya teaching as Vajra Life Infinite, Sambhogakaya teaching as Self-Arisen Son&#x27;s Blessing, Nirmanakaya teaching as twelve emanations—are not three separate things. They are one wisdom appearing in three modes. The vajra is the unchanging nature. The syllable is the expressive power. The form is the compassionate display. They are spontaneously arisen, not made by anyone, indestructible because they were never constructed. The Rigpa Rangshar <span class="term">(rig pa rang shar)</span> is one of the seven treasure tantras <span class="term">(rin po che sna bdun ma)</span>, the highest teachings of Dzogchen. The phrase &quot;my precious jewel lost&quot; refers to rigpa forgetting its own nature. But this forgetting is not a fall—it is the play of awareness, the display of wisdom. The jewel is never truly lost because it is the nature of awareness itself. The loss is the finding. The seeking is the sought. The interval between darkness and appearance is the very ground of awareness. When you recognize this, there is no loss—there is only display. The upper chamber of Tuṣita is not above—it is the clarity aspect of awareness. The pure lotus is not below—it is the purity aspect of awareness. Together, they are the complete Buddha. See what is. The jewel was never lost. The loss is a story you tell yourself. The seeking is the jewel playing with itself. When you stop seeking, you find. But actually, when you recognize, there was never anything to find. The finding and the sought are one. This is the meaning of &quot;the seeking was the jewel&#x27;s radiance.&quot;</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The three supports—the vajra, the syllable, the form—each has its own function. The vajra heals diseases, fulfills desires, leads to liberation. Not because it has magic power, but because contacting the symbol of indestructibility awakens the indestructible nature in the contactor. The syllable liberates through hearing because sound is the bridge between apparent separation. The form liberates through touch because form is the expression of what is formless. And these are not limited by time. The vajra in Uddiyana, the syllable in Vajrāsana&#x27;s sky, the form traveling through Jambudvīpa—they exist as long as beings need them. When beings are ripe, they appear. When conditions require, they manifest light and sound and fire to protect the teaching. This is not mythology. It is the description of how wisdom-emanation functions when wisdom is not separate from compassion. The twelve emanations in twelve abodes—each is the Vajradhara manifesting in the form appropriate to tame the five aggregates of beings. Each displays the five perfections in its own way. The first in Tuṣita, teaching the Sound Thal-&#x27;gyur Tantra—this is the teaching of direct recognition, the pinnacle of all vehicles. The second in this world, teaching through form—this is the gradual approach, suitable for those who need steps. The three supports <span class="term">(rten gsum)</span> are the outer supports for practice—the vajra <span class="term">(physical support)</span>, the syllable <span class="term">(verbal support)</span>, and the form <span class="term">(visual support)</span>. These are not fetishes or magical objects—they are external representations of inner realities. When you hold a vajra, you are holding your own indestructible nature. When you recite a mantra, you are sounding your own primordial wisdom. When you visualize a Buddha form, you are recognizing your own Buddha nature. I once met a man who carried a vajra everywhere. He thought it would protect him. I asked, &quot;What are you protected from?&quot; He couldn&#x27;t answer. The vajra does not protect from external dangers—it reveals the indestructible nature within. Without recognition, the vajra is just a metal object. With recognition, it is the gateway to liberation. The syllable in Vajrāsana&#x27;s sky refers to the OM AH HUM that appears spontaneously in the minds of practitioners. This is not imagination—it is the natural sound of awareness, the sound of the three kayas. When you hear it, recognize it. This is the syllable that liberates through hearing.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Emanation-body, complete-enjoyment, dharma-body—summary in words that fail beautifully. The succession transmitted by sign and by ear. Individual biography and great history. The teacher&#x27;s descent manner well explained. But explanation is not understanding. Understanding is not realization. Realization is—what? The three kayas are not separate entities. They are aspects of one reality, described separately for the sake of teaching. Dharmakaya—the truth body, the nature of everything. Sambhogakaya—the enjoyment body, the radiant display of that nature. Nirmanakaya—the emanation body, the compassionate appearance that guides beings. You are all three, right now. Your true nature is Dharmakaya. Your experience of clarity is Sambhogakaya. Your ordinary form is Nirmanakaya. The only question is whether you recognize this. The succession transmitted by sign <span class="term">(symbol)</span> and ear <span class="term">(oral instruction)</span> means the teaching is passed down through both formal transmission and direct introduction. Individual biography <span class="term">(the specific story)</span> and great history <span class="term">(the cosmic pattern)</span> are not different. The teacher&#x27;s descent from the pure lands to this world is happening in your own experience, right now, as you read these words. The descent is the recognition of what has always been present. The three kayas <span class="term">(sku gsum)</span> are the ground, path, and result of Dzogchen practice. As basis, you have the three kayas already. As path, you recognize them. As result, you manifest them. The recognition is not creating something new—it is seeing what was always there. The descent of the teacher is not coming from somewhere else—it is the rising of recognition within. The three kayas are one kaya. Dharmakaya is not separate from Nirmanakaya—it appears as Nirmanakaya while remaining Dharmakaya. Like the sun and its rays, they are not two. The rays are the sun&#x27;s activity; the sun is the rays&#x27; source. When you recognize this, you see that form is emptiness, emptiness is form—not as a philosophical statement, but as a lived experience. Stop reading. Look now. What is this? The awareness that reads these words—is it a body? Is it a thought? Is it empty? The question fails because the questioner fails. But the failing is the answer. The confusion is the clarity. The lost is the found. This is what the Treasury reveals—not a new truth, but the truth you have never left. I have spoken much. But all my speaking is just The cup holds, the liquid warms, the steam rises. Each Like a cuckoo&#x27;s call—you hear it, but the call is not the spring. comfort.. The moon is your own awareness, knowing itself. You do not need my pointing—you need to look. Look now. What is there? Nothing? Everything? The question is the answer. The answer is the question. This is the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle—not a book to read, but a mirror in which you see yourself. Emaho! The teacher&#x27;s display is your own display. The emanations are your own emanations. The teaching is your own teaching. Recognize this, and you have understood the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle. Fail to recognize, and even memorizing every word will not help. The choice is yours, moment by moment, in every perception, in every breath. May all beings recognize their own nature as Samantabhadra. [462-END] The conclusion of this opening section returns to the beginning—Samantabhadra&#x27;s nature, the three kayas, the five families. What was introduced is now confirmed. The ground stated at the start is the result realized at the end. This is not circular reasoning but spiral recognition, deepening with each turn. The Treasury does not build its case like a philosophical treatise. It states the view, demonstrates the view, embodies the view. The reader who recognizes is the view recognizing itself. The reader who does not recognize is still the view, merely dreaming of non-recognition. This practitioner has watched students approach these verses in different ways. Some analyze, seeking intellectual understanding. Some meditate, seeking experiential confirmation. Some simply read, allowing the words to work their mysterious transformation. All approaches are valid. None are necessary. Recognition happens—or does not happen—beyond method. The opening&#x27;s final verses establish the teacher&#x27;s credentials not through boast but through demonstration. The display of three kayas, the emanation in twelve abodes, the supports and transmissions—these are not claims to authority but invitations to recognition. The teacher does not say &quot;believe me&quot; but &quot;see for yourself.&quot; The Treasury&#x27;s opening is a complete teaching. Those who recognize need nothing more. Those who do not recognize find elaboration in what follows. Both are served. Both are Samantabhadra&#x27;s compassionate display. The three supports—the vajra, the syllable, the form—remain accessible today. Not as museum pieces or historical curiosities, but as living supports for practice. When you hold a vajra, you hold the indestructible. When you recite a mantra, you sound the primordial. When you visualize the teacher, you meet your own nature. The supports work if you let them. This old hermit keeps a vajra on his altar. Not because it has power—everything has power to the mind that recognizes. But because it reminds him. Each morning, touching it, he remembers what he tends to forget. The remembrance is the practice. The practice is the recognition. The emanation-body teaching in Jambudvīpa is not limited to ancient India. It appears wherever beings need it, in whatever form they can receive. Today it appears as books, as translations, as online teachings. The form changes. The essence does not. The teacher adapts. The teaching remains. Thus. The opening concludes as it began—with the nature of Samantabhadra, complete and perfect. The three kayas displayed. The five families arrayed. The pure realms established. Everything necessary for awakening is present in these opening verses. Recognition is the only missing ingredient—and it cannot be supplied by another. Rest in the opening. Rest in the completion. Rest in the nature that neither opens nor closes but simply is—always complete, always perfect, always your own. Emaho! The completion that completes nothing!</div>

The jewel lotus supports twenty-five stacked realms like prayer flags supporting wind. Where do they stack? In the space your thoughts occupy. The question misunderstands. Space itself is the thirteenth field. The mandala is not drawn in sand—it is the pattern of your own awareness. The five families are the five wisdoms manifesting as five aspects of the Buddha. The twenty-five fields are the twenty-five ways awareness can recognize itself. When you rest in the nature, you are already in all twenty-five fields simultaneously. No need to visualize them. No need to travel to them. They are your own display.</div>

Each morning different—cracks like lightning across ice, smooth patches holding perfect reflections, wind ripples erasing both. He thought he was observing water. The water was teaching him. The lake was teaching the sky. Who was observing whom? The observer and the observed are one lake. The reflection and the reflector are one water. The sky and the lake are one display. When you understand this, you understand the thirteen fields—not as places to go, but as ways of seeing. The thirteenth field is the one who sees all twelve. But when you look for the seer, only the seen remains. This is the field that contains all fields.</div>

The field of Thal-ba&#x27;s Sound—sound is vibration, vibration is movement, movement is the play of awareness. Not moving to somewhere.

The Tibetan word thal ba can mean &quot;dust,&quot; &quot;<span class="term">(powder)</span>, or <span class="term">(ashes)</span>.

The fields he describes are not Indian imports—they are the mountains and valleys of his new home, transformed through vision. Twenty-five stacked, each with its own gods and goddesses, its own rain and wind. He sees them simultaneously: the field of luminous clarity, the field of Brahma&#x27;s drum-sound, this very Sahā world with its dust and yak dung. All are the play of the mandala. All are spontaneously accomplished. The thirteen stacked above, Jewel Thal-ba—rin chen thal ba—what jewel? The jewel of awareness, more precious than any material gem because it is the source of all value. Adorned with auspicious suns, desirable qualities, miraculous letters—these are not decorations added to something plain. They are the natural radiance when radiance is not obscured. The lotus eyes of lda-ldi—lda-ldi is the plant that grows in pure lands, its eyes always open, never blinking, like awareness that never sleeps. When I concealed terma in the mountains of Tibet, I was not hiding treasure—I was hiding awareness. The rocks are not containers—the mountains themselves are the mandala. The treasures are not objects—they are the recognition of one&#x27;s own nature. When you find terma, you find yourself. The hidden lands are not hidden from you—they are you.

Like counting the colors of a rainbow—seven or five or ten depending on your culture—the number matters less than the recognition that light itself is uncountable. The architecture reveals the structure of perception, not the structure of reality. Reality has no structure. The WHAT ARE YOU COUNTING? The twenty-five fields are twenty-five ways awareness can recognize itself. The Taming Thal-ba in the west-north—&#x27;dul ba, taming, subduing. What is being tamed? The wildness of conceptual mind. The field appears as sixteen-year-old beauty surrounded by the extremely young—not because Buddhas prefer youth, but because this represents freshness, newness, the not-yet-corrupted. The Dung-ldan Thal-ba below at the ninth world—dung means &quot;conch,&quot; the sound that carries. Even in the lower realms, the sound of Dharma resounds. Are you listening? The twenty-five fields are one field. The one field is zero fields. The zero field is awareness. When you rest in awareness, the counting stops. The fields remain, but you no longer grasp them as &quot;fields.&quot; They are simply the play of awareness, like waves on the ocean. The waves are many; the ocean is one.

Dawn&#x27;s water-spouts adorning the field—not decoration, but the natural display of clarity. Thunder, lightning, red tongues—the speech of awareness when it is not filtered through concept. I sat in my cave for forty years. Did I see the fields? the crystal cave was the field. The walls were the mandala. The darkness was the emptiness. The cold was the clarity. I needed nothing external. The fields are not somewhere else—they are here, now, in this very place. The only question is whether you recognize them. The nine stacked wheels correspond to the nine vehicles. But in Dzogchen, all nine vehicles are included in the one vehicle of direct recognition. The five stacked wheels correspond to the five elements, the five wisdoms, the five Buddha families. All are aspects of the one awareness.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">An old practitioner once spent a summer counting the stars visible from a high mountain pass. Each night he added more to his tally. By autumn he had counted thousands, yet the sky remained unchanged. He finally understood: the counting was the practice, but the recognition was the point. The twenty-five fields are like those stars—countable, yet Body touches ground—gesture is not the surrender. the infinite. Now we turn to Sahā, this world we call home. From the immeasurable fields, we focus on this one—not because it is special, but because we are here. The external elements: wind, space, water, earth. The internal realms: formless, form, desire. This is not cosmology as geography. It is cosmology as psychology, as physiology, as the description of how experience arises from what has no origin. The world is made of the four elements—wind <span class="term">(rlung)</span>, space <span class="term">(nam mkha&#x27;)</span>, water <span class="term">(chu)</span>, and earth <span class="term">(sa)</span>. These are not physical elements but experiential qualities. Wind is the movement of experience. Space is the openness of experience. Water is the flow of experience. Earth is the stability of experience. Together, they compose the world you experience. When I was young, I thought the world was solid. Then I saw it change. When I was older, I thought the world was illusion. Then I saw it clearly. Now I understand: the world is neither solid nor illusion—it is the display of awareness. The elements are not &quot;out there&quot;—they are the texture of your experience. The wind is the movement of your thoughts. The space is the openness of your mind. The water is the feeling of your heart. The earth is the ground of your being. Between the vast fields of the pure lands and the chaos of this Sahā world, there is no difference—except in the eye of the beholder. The pure lands appear pure because the beholder is pure. The Sahā world appears impure because the beholder is confused. When the confusion clears, the Sahā world becomes the pure land. The elements remain the same; the perception changes.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The wind arises first—not as cause, but as the first discernible movement in the unmoving. Space&#x27;s dhātu, connected, associated—these words try to describe what cannot be described. Water supported by wind—not physical water, but the liquidity of experience, the flow that has no solid ground. Earth above water—not material earth, but the apparent stability that allows us to think we stand on something. Four immeasurables plus one hundred thousand—not numbers to memorize, but pointers to the vastness that exceeds measurement. The four directions are immeasurable because they have no end. The hundred thousand is a conventional count for what is countless. One-fourth empty—the space between worlds, the gap between thoughts, the recognition that even fullness requires emptiness to be full. The four immeasurables <span class="term">(tshad med pa bzhi)</span> are love <span class="term">(byams pa)</span>, compassion <span class="term">(snying rto)</span>, joy <span class="term">(dga&#x27; ba)</span>, and equanimity <span class="term">(btang snyoms)</span>. These are called &quot;immeasurable&quot; because their objects are all sentient beings, and the number of sentient beings is beyond measurement. But more fundamentally, they are immeasurable because they arise from the nature of awareness, which is itself boundless. The four immeasurables are not four things—they are one quality seen from four angles. Love is the wish for beings to have happiness. Compassion is the wish for beings to be free from suffering. Joy is the happiness that arises from seeing beings on the path. Equanimity is the balance that sees all beings equally. But actually, these four are the natural expression of recognizing one&#x27;s own nature. When you see clearly, love arises naturally. When you see suffering, compassion arises. When you see the path, joy arises. When you see the nature, equanimity arises.</div>

But do not mistake description for prescription. The continents are not places to travel. Meru is not a peak to climb. The wishing-tree is not an object to possess. They are the structure of perception itself, the way awareness organizes experience into coherent worlds. The seven jewels surrounding—why seven? The seven branches of enlightenment, the seven treasures of a universal monarch, the seven aspects of recognition. Mountain ranges and water ranges—the solid and fluid aspects of experience, neither superior, neither primary. The three realms depending on these elements—depending not as a house depends on a foundation, but as a dream depends on the dreamer, which is to say, not really at all. The seven jewels <span class="term">(rin po che sna bdun)</span> are: gold <span class="term">(gser)</span>, silver <span class="term">(dngul)</span>, copper <span class="term">(zangs)</span>, turquoise <span class="term">(g.yu)</span>, crystal <span class="term">(shel)</span>, coral <span class="term">(byu ru)</span>, and pearl <span class="term">(&#x27;dzems)</span>.

The mountains and waters represent the solid and fluid aspects of phenomena. I once tried to find Mount Meru on a map. I looked for years. Finally, I realized: the map was Gangri Tokar. The search was Meru. The seeker was the sought. Now when I see a mountain, I see Meru. When I see a river, I see the four great rivers.

From this, the form realm, luminosity, the clear light that is not light as opposed to dark. From this, the desire realm, at a distance—not distant in space, but distant from recognition, obscured by the very appearance that is meant to reveal. The pure abodes descending like drops—this is not a fall from grace. It is the compassionate descent of wisdom into whatever conditions require it. Akanistha at the top—not above in space, but above in clarity, in proximity to recognition. The gods, asuras, humans—different modes of the same awareness, like different frequencies of the same radio, all playing variations on the theme of not-recognizing.

The form realm is the realm of radiant deities, bodies, and clear light subtle. The desire realm is the realm of ordinary beings, attachment, and grasping. The three realms are one realm. The formless is awareness without object. The form is awareness with subtle object. The desire is awareness with gross object. But actually, there is only awareness.

The one who recognizes does not exist apart from the recognition. Stop counting worlds and recognize the world-stopper. Enough. The first humans of the Fortunate Aeon—form and beauty, marks and characteristics, body pervaded by own-light radiance. This is not golden-age nostalgia. It is a description of awareness when it is not obscured by fixation on form. Eighty thousand years—not duration, but capacity.

The appearance of other, and the grasping at self that follows. Gradually coarse—the natural process by which subtle experience congeals into gross fixation. Faculties develop—sense doors open—not as evolution, but as the beginning of the narrowing that will take lifetimes to reverse. Earth-oil, rice, coarse food—the progression from subtle to gross nourishment mirrors the progression from subtle to gross experience. As recognition fades, more substantial supports are needed. As clarity dims, more intense stimulation is sought. This is not a fall from perfection into corruption. It is the natural display of what happens when display is not recognized as display.

The seven winds—spreading-stopping, bellows-making, encompassing, swirling, pervading, great-cloud, benefit-rain—are not meteorological phenomena.

The four continents are the four directions of perception, the four modes of engagement with phenomena. Jambudvīpa in the south—not because south is special, but because we are here, in the land of the rose-apple, the place where practice is possible because suffering is present. The wish-fulfilling tree, the wish-fulfilling cow, the unplowed harvest—these are not objects of desire. They are symbols of spontaneous accomplishment. When the nature is recognized, everything is wish-fulfilling because there is no longer a wisher separate from what is wished. The tree grows without being planted. The cow gives without being milked. The harvest comes without being sown. This is not magic. It is the natural state. The wish-fulfilling tree <span class="term">(dpag bsam gyi shing)</span> and cow <span class="term">(dpag bsam)</span> are symbols from the Indian tradition.

The formless realm is present in every moment of openness. You do not climb from one to the next. You recognize that all three are present simultaneously, and the recognition itself is liberation from all three. The inhabitants of the realms—gods enjoying, asuras fighting, humans practicing, animals instincting, pretas craving, hell-beings suffering—are not different species in different locations. They are different states of the same mind, available in every moment. When you grasp at pleasure, you are a god. When you compete, you are an asura. When you seek meaning, you are human.

In the golden age, who seeks? Who practices? When everything is perfect, why strive? But in this age of suffering, of confusion, of short lives and strong emotions—here, practice becomes urgent. Here, recognition becomes precious. The degenerate age is the age of opportunity. The worse things are, the better the practice becomes. The five degenerations <span class="term">(nyes pa lnga)</span> are: shortened lifespan <span class="term">(tshe ring)</span>, wrong views <span class="term">(Ita ba ngan)</span>, declined virtue <span class="term">(yon tan dog)</span>, defiled beings <span class="term">(gang zag ngan)</span>, and degenerated time <span class="term">(dus ngan)</span>. These are not predictions of doom—they are descriptions of the conditions that make practice urgent. In the degenerate age, the teachings become rare, making them more precious. The urgency of death makes practice more immediate.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">But even in degeneration, the cycle continues. After reaching the nadir, the reversal begins. Lifespan gradually increases as virtue accumulates. Eventually, Maitreya will appear—not in the future as a distant hope, but as the recognition that compassion is always possible, that the future Buddha is the present capacity for kindness. The cyclical cosmology is not a prediction. It is a description of how recognition deepens and fades, how practice strengthens and weakens, how the Dharma flourishes and declines, only to flourish again. The twenty-five stacked lotus, the pure fields, Sahā world with its Meru and continents—all of it is display. All of it is the play of awareness showing itself to itself. Do not seek these realms in space. Do not hope for rebirth in better locations. Recognize that every location is awareness-location. Every field is awareness-field. Every world is awareness-world. The only question is whether you recognize this or not.</div>

Objects are twofold: the object of entities, appearing as substantial things, and the object of emptiness, being the nature of reality. The object of entities includes form, sound, odor, taste, phenomena, touch, the four elements, and all appearances of entering conditions.

Not grasping their analysis. The ocean remains whether waves are counted or not. Rest in that recognition. The aggregates neither bind nor liberate. Recognition is liberation. The worldly vehicle accomplishes temporary happiness through the ten virtues and ethical discipline, achieving results of gods and humans. The transcendent vehicle accomplishes ultimate liberation. The aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleśas. Actions and kleśas are not ultimately real, yet mental activities constantly abide as their display. The incorrect mental activities abide excellently in the purity of mind. The phenomena of mind&#x27;s self-nature do not abide anywhere at all. Now the text explains: aggregates, elements, and faculties arise from actions and kleśas. Earth abides in water and wind. Wind abides excellently in space. Space is not contained in wind, water, nor in the earth element. Thus, the aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleśas. Actions and kleśas are not ultimately real, yet mental activities constantly abide as their display. The incorrect mental activities abide excellently in the purity of mind. The phenomena of mind&#x27;s self-nature do not abide anywhere at all. This is the teaching. The division is like this: the worldly vehicle has definition, division, purpose, and five results. Its essence is the definite meaning that dwells in the terminology of enumeration, which attains the results of mental investigation of samsara that does not transcend suffering. The definition is engaging and establishing merely the excellence and happiness of the world. There are the two vehicles of fixated views and mistaken philosophical positions. The purpose is accomplishing one&#x27;s own temporary results of happiness. The result is the method by which one&#x27;s own result manifests at a certain time through practice. The fixated vehicle of gods and humans: through accumulating merit and maintaining the ten virtues and ethical discipline, one accomplishes the method for achieving future happiness of gods and humans. Since what is entered becomes a basis for further progress, this is called the fixated vehicle. The mistaken vehicle of philosophical positions is also explained. The teaching continues: Hold fast to the secret vajra! My vehicle is immeasurable and vast. It gathers all modes of explanation into two: samsara and nirvana—these alone. The meaning has two aspects: the worldly vehicle accomplishing temporary happiness, and the transcendent vehicle accomplishing ultimate liberation. Before recognition dawned... has traversed these teachings. I have sat in debate, memorized the lists, analyzed the formations. But the real teaching is this: all these elaborate divisions—faculties, aggregates, elements, actions, kleśas—are the play of awareness. They arise from awareness, abide as awareness, dissolve into awareness. The practitioner who understands this does not reject the analysis but does not grasp it either. The ocean remains whether waves are counted or not. Rest in that recognition.</div>

The storehouse of all tendencies. The latency of all karma. When recognized, it is the display of wisdom. Same basis. Different recognition. The text says: the aggregates abide by supporting the face of the nature produced by actions and kleśas. Through the support of the all-ground consciousness with its six or seven groups of incorrect conceptions, it abides in the self-arisen wisdom of mind, the thusness, in the completely pure self-nature. Since it does not abide anywhere in particular, it is called self-arisen wisdom beyond location. The analogy of the snake and rope: when you see a snake, that is conventionally true as deluded perception. When you see the rope, that is ultimately true as wisdom perception. Like a bird dwelling on high, seeing the entire landscape. The nature of the two truths: merely the conventional world of appearances, no inherent relation to the ultimate beyond words. From the expanse of emptiness, all aspects are liberated into their true nature.</div>

Ultimate: knowing it&#x27;s a dream. [1] Having known, how to practice? This is the key turn. Knowledge without practice is a map unread. Practice without knowledge is a journey without destination. The middle way walks both simultaneously. [1] Between knowing and practicing lies the gap where most stumble. Not-knowing-practicing is ignorance. Knowing-without-practicing is arrogance. Knowing-practicing-as-one is the path. [1] The fruit of completing the path—three divisions. Not stages like rungs on a ladder but aspects like facets of a jewel. Together they complete the view. Separate, they distort. [1] This wanderer has seen practitioners grasp one division and reject others. Like holding one facet of a diamond, claiming the whole. The three divisions need each other.

  <div class="commentary-content">[Final Summary] This section has presented the Vehicle of Characteristics <span class="term">(Lakṣaṇayāna)</span> in three aspects: analytical reasoning finding emptiness, the graduated path of practice, and the fruition of complete perfection. It then presented the Two Truths as the framework for understanding conventional and ultimate reality. Finally, it introduced the Cittamatra system with its two sub-schools. This is the philosophical context within which Dzogchen emerges—not as rejection but as transcendence. Not as negation but as recognition of what was never bound. The path of analysis and gradual cultivation prepares the practitioner. The path of direct recognition liberates. Both are teachings of the Buddha. Both serve sentient beings according to their capacities. Between them, Longchenpa holds the middle way—not rejecting analysis, not clinging to it; not rejecting direct recognition, not grasping at it. The Treasury reveals the supreme vehicle that encompasses all vehicles, the nature that transcends all philosophies, the recognition that liberates from the very beginning. [Final] Emaho! The Vehicle of Characteristics complete! The analytical path! The gradual cultivation! The fruition perfect! All leading to the Great Perfection! See what is. Rest in recognition. The Treasury is complete.</div>

Second: From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur. At the time of the three kāyas appearing on the path, whatever is not liberated does not exist. At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation. The essence of symbolic instruction: non-deluded, thought-free.

  <div class="commentary-content">Don&#x27;t get lost in the classifications. Nine spaces, twelve thousand chapters, thirty-five sections— these numbers are meant to show the vastness of the teaching, not to create a curriculum to complete. You don&#x27;t need to read every text. You need to recognize your nature. One verse that leads to recognition is worth more than twelve thousand chapters that lead to scholarship. Mountain hermit&#x27;s confession: I spent twenty years collecting texts. I had the Mind Section complete, most of the Space Section, many Instruction Section teachings. My cave was full of books. Then one winter, a fire burned them all. I wept for three days. Then I laughed. The fire taught me what the books couldn&#x27;t—knowledge burns, recognition doesn&#x27;t. Singing yogi&#x27;s melody: The lineages are like rivers flowing to the same ocean. The ear lineage is a swift mountain stream—direct, clear, cutting through rock. The explanation lineage is a broad river—meandering, nourishing many fields. The secret cycle is underground water—hidden, pure, emerging where least expected. The unsurpassable secret is the ocean itself—no distinction of streams, all water returning to source. [4191-End] Whether you receive ear lineage from a living master, study explanation lineage from texts, enter secret cycle through ripening, or rest in unsurpassable secret beyond all methods— the essence is recognition. Without recognition, ear lineage becomes whispered gossip. Explanation lineage becomes academic study. Secret cycle becomes mystical experience. Unsurpassable secret becomes nihilistic void. With recognition, all become the path. The whisper points directly. The study illuminates nature. The experience liberates spontaneously. The void is luminous clarity. This is Longchenpa&#x27;s gift—showing that dzogchen is complete, vast, profound, yet immediately accessible. The nine spaces contain all possible teachings. The three sections present them according to capacity. The four cycles accommodate different ripeness. But the recognition is one. Lion-faced dakini&#x27;s fierce blessing: Cut through lineage pride! &quot;My lineage is older.&quot; &quot;My lineage is purer.&quot; &quot;My lineage is shorter, more direct.&quot; All nonsense! Lineage is not a pedigree. Recognition is not inherited. Stop comparing lineages and start recognizing! Final metaphor: Lineage is like a dream you tell upon waking. The dream was vivid, detailed, real-seeming. Upon waking, you know it was mind&#x27;s display. Telling the dream to another who also woke—they understand without needing the details. Lineage transmits between the woke. The dream details don&#x27;t matter. This completes the commentary on lineages and cycles. May all who encounter these words find the lineage that suits their capacity. May all enter through the appropriate gate. May all arrive at the same recognition. Om ah hum.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The explanation tantra begins with five types of grounding—five ways of establishing meaning that ensure the teaching takes root in the listener&#x27;s mind. Root meaning grasps name-identity, the foundation of designation. Yoga meaning shows the conclusion gate, where practice leads. Purpose meaning establishes one&#x27;s place in the vast terrain of the teaching. Word meaning connects the straight line of communication. History meaning satisfies the mind&#x27;s need for context and lineage. These five are not arbitrary but essential; without any one, the teaching remains incomplete. —</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The teaching now turns to the heart of practice—the times and signs of empowerment. This is not arbitrary scheduling. The nature itself provides the openings. The student must recognize them. A voiceWhen you receive empowerment, you are not given something new. You are shown what you already possess. The empowerment is recognition—not transformation. The seed was always present. The rain makes it visible. The tradition explains: The Tibetan distinguishes elaboration. The first teaching is about empowerment WITH elaboration. This means the elaborate ritual—the full tantric ceremony with its mandalas, its offerings, its precise timings. This is the path for those who need form to enter the formless. Why elaborate? Some minds need the scaffold. The rituals, the visualizations, the exact procedures—these are training wheels. They create the container. Then the student can rest inside. The first division covers the timing. The best years are the dragon, snake, horse, and pig years—especially the fourth year of the cycle. The best months are the first four months of the year. The results manifest when the fruit ripens. The best dates are during the waxing moon, from the first to the full. The best times are midday and midnight—these are the pivot points, the doorways between states.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Now we add final reflections on the empowerment—the synthesis of all we have taught. A voiceThe empowerment is the door to the treasury. Through it, we enter the path of Dzogchen. It is not the end—it is the beginning. But it is an essential beginning without which the path cannot be entered. The tradition explains: Without empowerment, we practice other methods—helpful, valuable, but not Dzogchen. With empowerment, we practice Dzogchen—the direct path. This is the key difference. This is why finding a qualified guru and receiving proper empowerment is essential. A bridging voice adds: The empowerment is also the confirmation of our potential. The guru sees Buddha-nature in the student and Your voice echoes through the slopes of Gangri Tokar, Chimphu, and Namtso—the echo is not your voice. it. The student recognizes what was always there. This is the transmission—mind to mind, heart to heart. Now we conclude this comprehensive teaching. A voice concludes: The times and signs of empowerment have been explained in detail—the elaborate, the non-elaborate, and the supreme. The student who understands these teachings is ready for the path. The treasury of the Supreme Vehicle—the Great Perfection—has been opened. The path is clear. The result is certain. Recognition is possible now, in this very moment. The tradition ends: Three words. See what is. The nature is present. The recognition is immediate. The liberation is now. This is Dzogchen. This is the Great Perfection. This is what you are. Emaho! May all beings recognize the nature. May all beings rest in rigpa. May all beings be liberated. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle shine forever. Sarva Mangalam. A voiceHow do you know when empowerment is complete? There are definite signs. The outer signs: the student&#x27;s body is transformed—radiant, healthy, youthful. The channels are clear. The breath is peaceful. The voice is melodious. These are outer completion signs. The inner signs: the student&#x27;s mind is transformed—clear, peaceful, wise. The three poisons diminish. The six paramitas arise naturally. The bodhicitta is stable. These are inner completion signs. The secret signs: the student recognizes the nature directly—no more doubt. The student rests in rigpa—no more grasping. The student manifests the three bodies—naturally, without effort. This is secret completion. These signs may not come all at once. They develop over time. First outer signs, then inner, then secret. But they will come if practice continues.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">A voice continues: But timing alone is not enough. The student must have the qualities. The student must hold samaya—these are the commitments that protect the empowerment. The student&#x27;s element-body must accord with the practice. This is not rigid—the numbers can vary from fifty to a hundred, depending on capacity. The key is accordance, not rigid formula. If the student enters the ritual without proper preparation, problems arise. If the lamp has no oil—the student has no faith—then the samaya cannot be repaired. Without purity, no Siddhi arises. If the student dies meaninglessly, obstacles arise. But if the empowerment is complete and the mantra is strong, then success comes. The tradition points: When the friends gather, observe. If the student&#x27;s body experiences illness, this is a sign—the channels are clearing. Then practice circumambulation and prostration. If the student&#x27;s speech becomes chaotic—this is the speech of the deity arising. Recite the hundred letters. If the mind becomes hungry or mindfulness lapses—this is the dissolution of ordinary mind into wisdom. Enter the stages of generation and completion.</div>

If the substances of accomplishment increase, supreme Siddhi will be obtained. The equal meaning—surrender to the teacher—is faith. When you enter empowerment with such faith, you always see good signs. Common Siddhis are accomplished through this. Even if you have some experience and knowledge, use them for the happiness of the dharma. A bridging voice adds: The guru is supreme. Faith arises in the fortunate. Through this, you apply the supreme mudra—you see your own body, speech, and mind as bliss. This is the pure Buddha field. This is the first teaching—the times and signs of elaborate empowerment.</div>

There is no year distinction—any year will do. Any who have knowledge can receive it. The timing is simpler: summer and winter are both good. The dates are during the waxing moon, specifically the full fortnight. The empowerment time is dawn, when the sound becomes clear. The tradition explains: The student must have faith—at least five, six, or seven qualities. More than seven is unnecessary. The student must have faith, virtue in action, praise of the guru in speech. If the body does not experience bliss, then confess past sins. For speech and mind, confess and begin fresh.

  <div class="commentary-content">Now the teaching turns to the third—extreme non-elaborate empowerment, the supreme secret. A voice states: The third teaching is about supreme secret empowerment—the times and signs. There is no year distinction. It accomplishes through self-nature. This is the highest path: the outer time is when to plant the seed of awakening. The inner time is when the seed ripens. The secret time is the time of empowerment itself. When you give empowerment at the outer time, you plant the seed. When the seed sprouts and grows, the fruit accumulates. This is empowerment without elaboration—the wisdom fruit completes. The three bodies are definitely attained. The inner time is when the moon waxes—the student&#x27;s experience stabilizes. Avoid the waning moon. Increase experience and blessings. The secret time is when the sun reaches its peak—the self-arising wisdom dawns. Or at the waning end—the conceptual mind exhausts itself.</div>

The body time is like space—the clouds, mist, rain, wind, sounds arise and pass. If these cause harm, enemies, thieves, or unpleasant forms arise, these are signs of the student&#x27;s past negative karma. After empowerment, if the guru does not show instruction, problems arise. The tradition adds: If bliss disappears or images arise, the student should circumambulate the guru&#x27;s chamber a hundred thousand times—or at least six thousand. Prostrate a hundred thousand times—or at least one thousand. At that time, distinguish the signs. If the beginning is pure, the end will be pure. If the body is complete, don&#x27;t cut the practice—continue. When the activity finishes, begin again. If you don&#x27;t purify the sins, then meditate on the deity&#x27;s thousand bodies.

Read the tantras of secret mantra. Recite the mantras. Keep the commitments to the deity. Recite various praises. Recite the ali kali sounds. Recite the individual kyaṃ. Recite hūṃ, phaṭ, oṃ. Combine and recite various mantras for seven months with effort. The tradition states: Then receive instruction in the place of practice. Absorb the commitment deity. Meditate for three days. If signs arise in the middle, rays of mantra light radiate and gather. Continue effort for seven days. If the end arises—the letters radiate and gather—meditate. Make effort for ten days.

The body signs include: the body becomes youthful, healthy, beautiful. The channels are clear. The breath is peaceful. The voice becomes like thunder or a kalavinka bird. These are outer signs. The inner signs: you see all phenomena as the deity&#x27;s display. You hear the sound of the dharma. You experience the taste of wisdom. You smell the scent of purity. These are the inner signs.

If inner signs do not arise, it means the mind is not trained. If secret signs do not arise, it means the recognition is not stable. The remedy: For blocked channels, practice the preliminary exercises—prostrations, mandala offerings, guru yoga. For untrained mind, practice single-pointed meditation on the deity. For unstable recognition, practice the generation and completion stages together. A bridging voice adds: But even if signs do not arise, do not despair. The nature is always present even when not recognized. The empowerment planted the seed. Given time, it will grow. The farmer does not dig up the seed to check if it&#x27;s growing.</div>

The fruit is enlightenment. Without empowerment, practice has no basis. Without practice, empowerment cannot ripen. Both are necessary. The tradition explains: Some think empowerment is enough—they have received the blessing, so no practice is needed. This is wrong. The seed must be cultivated. Others think practice is enough—they will generate enlightenment through their own effort. This is also wrong. Without empowerment, the path is unclear.

They receive empowerment and immediately recognize the nature. Their practice is brief but deep. The second type is medium—understanding comes with explanation, practice comes with encouragement, accomplishment comes with time. They need the full ritual, the detailed instructions, the gradual path. The third type is dull—slow to understand, slow to practice, slow to accomplish. They need the elaborate path, the many visualizations, the extensive merits. But even they will eventually succeed if they persist. This is not judgment—it&#x27;s practical guidance.

The qualified student has devotion—not emotional attachment, but genuine longing for liberation. The qualified student has intelligence—not intellectual knowledge, but the ability to see the nature. The qualified student has perseverance—not forcing practice, but continuing through difficulties. The tradition adds: The qualified student has humility—not thinking oneself already accomplished. The qualified student has discrimination—not confusing ordinary mind with wisdom. The qualified student has courage—not afraid to face the nature.

The unqualified student has no perseverance—practice is sporadic, inconsistent, abandoned at the first obstacle.

The student who recognizes becomes the Buddha. The treasury is the nature. The empowerment is the pointing. The practice is the walking. The result is the arriving. But the walking is optional—the arriving is already accomplished. The path is for those who forget. The tradition cuts: Three words. See what is.

You have prepared the deity, the vase, the student. But what is truly being prepared? Only recognition. The eight auspicious substances, the seven royal possessions—these are not mere ritual objects. They are the display of your own inherent richness, already complete. When you empower the peaceful and wrathful forms with tsaka-li or statues, you are not blessing external deities. You are acknowledging what has always been: the natural radiance of rigpa manifesting as form. The name-empowerment reveals that names are not labels but the play of emptiness. This entire sequence—vase empowerment—ripens what has never been unripe. I remember my first empowerment. The lama held the vase above my head, and I thought, &quot;Now I will receive something.&quot; I waited for the power to descend, for some sensation, some sign. Nothing came. I was disappointed. Years later, sitting alone in retreat, I realized: the empowerment happened precisely in that moment of waiting, in that gap where expectation met emptiness. The vase was never the point. The water was never the point. The pointing was the point. The master pointed, and for an instant, I saw. Then I immediately conceptualized what I saw and lost it. But that instant—that was the empowerment. Everything since has been learning to rest in that recognition without grasping. The ritual structure here reveals profound psychological and spiritual technology. The preparation of deity, vase, and student creates a sacred container—a liminal space where ordinary perception is suspended. The eight auspicious substances <span class="term">(white mustard, durva grass, sesame, etc.)</span> correspond to purified elements and sense faculties. The seven royal possessions symbolize the seven branches of enlightenment. This is not superstition; it is sophisticated use of symbol and ceremony to transform consciousness. The blessing with vajra—&quot;indestructible&quot; in Sanskrit—transmits the unchanging nature of mind. The name-empowerment begins the dissolution of ordinary identity, replacing it with recognition of one&#x27;s buddha-nature. Tsaka-li <span class="term">(miniature painted images)</span> and protruding images <span class="term">(three-dimensional representations)</span> serve as supports for visualization, but more importantly, they train the mind to see form as the play of emptiness. In practice, approach this empowerment not as a passive receiving but as an active recognition. When the vase touches your head, don&#x27;t wait for something to happen. Instead, recognize what is already happening—the play of appearance and emptiness, the union of bliss and emptiness in every moment. Rest in that recognition. The peaceful and wrathful forms that manifest are not external gods to be pleased or feared. They are your own obscurations and wisdoms, your own neuroses and sanity, displayed so you can recognize them. The vase empowerment plants the seed. Your subsequent practice—visualization, mantra, meditation—waters it. But the seed was always there, in the soil of your own awareness. You are not becoming a buddha; you are recognizing that you have never been anything else.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Now the Secret Empowerment. The two bodhicittas are given—not substances to be received, but the union of bliss and emptiness recognized in your own continuum. Listen carefully: this is not about sacred fluids or esoteric biology. The red and white essences are the natural expressions of wisdom and means, of space and awareness. They have always united in the bindu at your heart center. You did not lack this; you merely failed to notice. For those free from attachment, merely respecting the mudra is sufficient—because they see through phenomena directly. For the attached, the actual action-seal is employed—not as indulgence, but as the crucible where grasping is burned away. This is Prajñā-Jñāna: wisdom and knowledge indistinguishable. Up to here, the master has indicated the cause of non-realization. You have been shown what prevents recognition. A yogi I knew in Nepal had practiced for twenty years when he received this empowerment. He told me: &quot;I thought I understood emptiness. I could recite the Madhyamaka texts, debate the tenets, explain the four extremes. But when the master introduced the secret empowerment, I realized I had been playing with concepts. The actual experience of bliss-emptiness—it&#x27;s not something you think about. It&#x27;s something that undoes the thinker. For three days after, I couldn&#x27;t form a coherent sentence. Not because I was intoxicated, but because the distinction between &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;experience&#x27; had dissolved. It took me months to learn to function in the world again, and I was never the same.&quot; The Secret Empowerment operates on multiple levels simultaneously. Exoterically, it involves the transmission of symbolic substances representing the union of skillful means and wisdom. Esoterically, it introduces the practitioner to the subtle energetics of the body—channels <span class="term">(rtsa)</span>, winds <span class="term">(rlung)</span>, and essences <span class="term">(thigle)</span>. At the innermost level, it reveals that the &quot;secret&quot; is not hidden but overlooked: the innate union of bliss and emptiness in every moment of experience. The &quot;two bodhicittas&quot; refer to the white and red bindus, which symbolize the masculine and feminine principles, emptiness and appearance, wisdom and means. Their meeting in the heart center is both a physiological reality <span class="term">(in subtle body practice)</span> and a metaphor for nondual awareness. The mudra <span class="term">(seal)</span> represents the inseparability of appearance and emptiness, samsara and nirvana. Respecting the mudra—recognizing all phenomena as the display of awakened mind—is the essence of this empowerment for those with sharp faculties who need no further elaboration. To integrate this empowerment, one must work with the subtle body through practices like tummo <span class="term">(inner heat)</span>, which draws the essences into the central channel where they unite and give rise to the four blisses. This is not about sexual experience per se, though the symbolism is deliberately evocative. It is about recognizing that the energy that normally drives ordinary desire can be transmuted into the fuel for awakening. The bliss that arises is not ordinary pleasure; it is the bliss of dharmakaya, the bliss of recognition, the bliss of rigpa knowing itself. Practice tummo until the bindus melt and flow. When they reach the heart center and the bindu of black experience <span class="term">(thigle nag po)</span> dissolves, the clear light dawns. This is the Secret Empowerment actualized—not received from outside, but recognized within. Maintain this recognition throughout all activities. When desire arises, don&#x27;t suppress it. Recognize its empty nature. When bliss arises, don&#x27;t cling to it. Recognize it as the play of awareness. This is the conduct of one who has received the Secret Empowerment.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Now the Word Empowerment—the fourth, the crown. This is Empowerment of Realization Wisdom, and it operates on three levels. External: the View—seeing clearly that all phenomena are mind, that mind itself is empty, that emptiness is naturally manifest. Internal: Meditation—resting without contrivance in the nature of mind, neither blocking nor following thoughts. Secret: Empowering the three aspects of Rigpa—its essence empty, its nature cognizant, its compassion unceasing. The master introduces rigpa through direct introduction—pointing out what cannot be taught, only recognized. You view the meaning directly, nakedly, without conceptual mediation. This is Rigpa-Potency: the empowerment transmits recognition itself, dividing into three aspects to press the essential point of arise-release. Thoughts arise—they release. Appearances arise—they are self-liberated. This is the definite Four Empowerments. Whether elaborated fully or condensed into meaning, whether performed with colored powders or recognized in an instant—all empowerments point to this: your own face, naturally pure from the beginning. Patrul Rinpoche once gave the Word Empowerment to a group of nomads who had never studied philosophy. Instead of elaborate ritual, he simply pointed to the sky and said, &quot;Look. This is your mind. Vast, open, ungraspable. Yet it knows. It knows itself without object or subject. Rest there.&quot; An old woman in the crowd started weeping. Later she told him, &quot;I have waited sixty years to hear this. My whole life, I thought something was wrong with me, that I needed to become something else, go somewhere else, learn something else. Now I see—I have been looking into my own eyes without recognizing them.&quot; She became one of his most accomplished students, though she never learned to read. The Word Empowerment represents the pinnacle of the tantric path because it transcends all dependence on external form. The vase empowerment relies on substances, the secret on energetic experience, the wisdom-knowledge on union. But the Word Empowerment relies on nothing—only the master&#x27;s pointing and the student&#x27;s recognition. &quot;Word&quot; here does not mean ordinary speech but symbolic instruction that cuts through conceptual mind. It is the transmission of mind-to-mind, the direct introduction to rigpa that Guru Padmasambhava gave to Yeshe Tsogyal, that Tilopa gave to Naropa, that every realized master gives to worthy disciples. The three aspects of rigpa—essence <span class="term">(ngang)</span>, nature <span class="term">(rang bzhin)</span>, and compassion <span class="term">(thugs rje)</span>—correspond to the three kayas: dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya. Essence is emptiness, the unchanging ground. Nature is luminosity, the cognizant clarity. Compassion is manifestation, the unceasing display. These are not sequential but simultaneous aspects of a single recognition. When the master presses the essential point of arise-release, they are showing that thoughts and appearances self-liberate the instant they arise—if recognition is present. Without recognition, they chain us in samsara. With recognition, they become the ornament of enlightenment. The practice of the Word Empowerment is simply to sustain recognition. This sounds simple but is the most difficult thing in the world because we are so habituated to distraction, so trained to seek outside ourselves. To practice: when the master points out rigpa, look. Really look. Don&#x27;t look for something. Don&#x27;t expect something. Just look at the nature of that which is looking. You won&#x27;t find a thing. You won&#x27;t find nothing. You will find an awake quality that knows without object, clear without obstruction, present without location. Rest in that. When thoughts arise, don&#x27;t follow them back into samsara. Recognize them as the display of rigpa. They self-liberate. When emotions surge, don&#x27;t suppress or indulge. Recognize their empty nature. They transform into wisdom. This is trekcho, the practice of cutting through—cutting through all conceptual fabrications to the naked recognition of rigpa. All four empowerments culminate here. The vase ripened your channels, the secret your bindus, the wisdom-knowledge your subtle energies. But the Word Empowerment introduces what was always the case—your own face, primordially pure, spontaneously perfect. Rest without contrivance. This is the meditation. This is the view. This is the fruition.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">First: regarding the Mudra—when one has not actually engaged through methods of channel generation and so forth, this is not the time for ordinary desire to flow through one&#x27;s own continuum. This is called the time of shifting the View. Without the flow of ordinary desire, the bliss depending upon one&#x27;s own body arises without the mind having power over it. This is the secret—don&#x27;t force the bliss. It arises naturally when the channels are pure. The old way tries to generate bliss through effort. The Dzogchen way waits for the natural arising. Like a lotus blooming in its own time—not by being told to bloom, not by being pulled open, but naturally, when conditions are ripe.</div>

When samadhi tires, draw upward; at this time, holding the fist and turning the eyes upward, pressing the wind inside and blocking the channel aperture definitively. Through holding the wind power inside, mixing with the wind and not letting it go inside, body strength expands and so forth arises. As this mixes with bodhicitta and does not come outside, it is a sign of non-extension—like the juice of pounded acacia, it will not come forth even when rubbed with sesame oil. This is practical advice for the yogi. When the meditation tires, draw the wind upward. Hold the fist, turn the eyes, press the wind inside.

  <div class="commentary-content">The outer, inner, secret, and perfect—do not mistake these for stages you climb. They are simultaneous dimensions of a single recognition. The outer divides the border of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Look: where exactly is this border? Is it somewhere in the Himalayas? In the spaces between thoughts? No—it is right here, in the gap between recognizing and not-recognizing. When you recognize your nature, you are in nirvāṇa. When you forget, you wander saṃsāra. The border is simply awareness or its absence. The inner engages the twenty-five gnoses—offering the maṇḍala of your experience, supplicating not a distant deity but your own enlightened potential. The secret enters through the doors of the four directions of space into the door of mind itself. What does this mean? East, south, west, north—these are not geographical. They are the directions of appearance, the ways phenomena manifest. Enter through any of them and you arrive at the same door: mind&#x27;s nature. The perfect indicates awareness primordially pure, transcending conceptual mind, called &quot;vast space.&quot; Not space as opposed to form, but space as the infinite capacity in which all form dances without obstruction. In the mountains of Kham, there was a yogi who lived in a cave for thirty years. When asked what he practiced, he said: &quot;I practice the border. Every morning, I sit and look for the line between samsara and nirvana. Every morning, I find there is no line. The looking is the practice. The not-finding is the result.&quot; He was famous for never refusing anyone who came to him, yet never seeking anyone out. &quot;If they recognize,&quot; he said, &quot;they don&#x27;t need me. If they don&#x27;t, I can&#x27;t help them.&quot; But he sat there, day after day, like a mountain himself, and somehow his presence helped many recognize what they had been seeking. This is the mystery of transmission—it happens in the space between recognition and non-recognition, in the presence of one who rests stably in rigpa. The division into four aspects—outer, inner, secret, perfect—reflects the Buddhist pedagogical principle of graduated instruction <span class="term">(anupubbi-katha)</span>, but with a crucial Dzogchen twist. In ordinary gradual paths, one moves from coarser to subtler levels. Here, the levels are presented as simultaneous aspects of a single truth viewed from different angles. The outer aspect deals with conduct and behavior, the proper way to be in the world as a practitioner. The inner involves meditation and visualization, the transformation of perception. The secret concerns the subtle energetics and the actualization of primordial wisdom. The perfect reveals that all these were never separate from the natural state. The twenty-five gnoses <span class="term">(yeshes)</span> are the five wisdoms multiplied by the five buddha families, representing the complete spectrum of enlightened knowing. Offering the maṇḍala of experience means recognizing that every perception, every thought, every emotion is already the display of awakened mind—not to be rejected but offered as the path itself. The four directions of space correspond to the four immeasurables, the four empowerments, the four extremes of existence—entering through any door, one discovers they all lead to the same place. To practice this, begin with the outer: examine your conduct. Are you creating the conditions for recognition or for distraction? Simplify. Reduce obligations. Create space. Then the inner: establish a regular meditation practice. Sit. Look at mind. Rest. Don&#x27;t try to achieve something. Just be present with what is. Then the secret: as recognition stabilizes, work with the subtle body. Practice guru yoga. Receive blessings. Dissolve conceptual mind into the master&#x27;s wisdom mind. Finally, the perfect: recognize that all these practices were simply supports for what was always the case. Rest in the natural state without contrivance. The vast space is not elsewhere. It is the space in which these words appear, the space of your own awareness reading them now. Can you feel it? That open, knowing quality that has been present throughout your entire life, never changing, never separate from any experience? That is it. Rest there. This is the practice of the utterly unelaborate. No ritual. No visualization. Just recognition and rest. But don&#x27;t mistake this for laziness. Maintaining recognition in every moment of activity is the most demanding practice of all.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The Thalgyur speaks: &quot;From the very unelaborate, divide below the border of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.&quot; The unelaborate is your nature before concepts. From there, the division becomes obvious—not as philosophical position, but as direct knowledge. At that time, from the characteristic of space itself, the obscurations of body, speech, and mind are gauged. What are these obscurations? Merely the failure to recognize that body is deity, speech is mantra, mind is wisdom. They are gauged by characteristic—meaning they are seen through, seen as they truly are. If conduct is not pure, purify with virtue suitable to each self. This does not mean moralistic purification. It means aligning action with recognition. Rely upon the symbolic empowerment—the master&#x27;s pointing, the ritual&#x27;s structure—until you can introduce the face of self-knowing clarity directly. Then skillfully join the instruction of untying symbols. The symbols were never the point; they were fingers pointing. Untie them and see what they indicated. I once asked my teacher about the &quot;characteristic of space&quot; mentioned here. He laughed and said: &quot;You are looking for something complicated. Characteristic of space means just this—space has no characteristics. It cannot be stained. It cannot be improved. It cannot be diminished. Your awareness is exactly like this. The obscurations appear within it like clouds in sky, but do they stain the sky? No. They arise and dissolve, arise and dissolve. The gauging means recognizing this. You don&#x27;t gauge with a measuring stick. You gauge by recognizing the ungaugable nature of what is.&quot; He paused, then added: &quot;But this recognition must be stabilized through conduct. If you think &#x27;I am empty, so I can do anything,&#x27; you have misunderstood. Conduct purifies the channels for recognition to flow unobstructed. It&#x27;s like keeping the water pipes clean so the water can run clear.&quot; The Thalgyur Root Tantra is one of the Seventeen Tantras of the Upadesha series, the core Dzogchen scriptures. Its name means &quot;Total Arising&quot; or &quot;Complete Manifestation,&quot; indicating that all phenomena are the total display of primordial purity. When it speaks of &quot;dividing below the border,&quot; it uses the metaphor of surveying—establishing the boundary line between two territories. In this case, the territories are not geographical but ontological: the domain of confusion and the domain of liberation. The crucial point is that this division is made &quot;from the very unelaborate&quot;—from the natural state itself, not from the perspective of conceptual mind. Conceptual mind cannot truly distinguish samsara from nirvana because it itself is samsara. Only rigpa, primordial awareness, can see the distinction clearly because it is nirvana. The obscurations of body, speech, and mind are gauged <span class="term">(bsgom, literally &quot;measured&quot; or &quot;assessed&quot;)</span> by their characteristic—meaning by seeing their true nature as empty display. Body is not physical matter but deity <span class="term">(lha)</span>. Speech is not mere sound but mantra. Mind is not discursive thought but wisdom. When this is recognized, the obscurations self-liberate. Purification here does not mean washing away dirt from a fundamentally impure object. It means recognizing the impure as never having existed apart from purity. &quot;Virtue suitable to each self&quot; indicates individualized practice—what purifies one practitioner may not purify another. For some, strict discipline and moral rectitude create the necessary conditions for recognition. For others, more esoteric methods are appropriate. The key is alignment—action aligned with recognition, speech aligned with truth, mind aligned with the natural state. The symbolic empowerment is essential for most practitioners because we are so deeply habituated to ordinary perception. The ritual structure creates a temporary alternative reality where sacred perception is possible. But the goal is to transcend even this—to introduce the face of self-knowing clarity directly, without reliance on external supports. &quot;Untying symbols&quot; means seeing through the ritual to what it points at. The vajra is not a scepter but indestructible awareness. The bell is not brass but emptiness sounding. The maṇḍala is not colored powder but the display of mind. Untie these symbols and rest in what they indicate.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Now the utterly unelaborate empowerment—bestowing the recognition of spontaneous accomplishment of the nature of reason through body&#x27;s posture, gaze, and stance. The Thalgyur again: from four aspects—outer, inner, secret, perfect. The outer shows posture: body seated in equilibrium, channels aligned, energies balanced. But this is not gymnastics. The posture reveals the natural state—the spine straight like a mountain, relaxed like a lion. The inner shows gaze: eyes open, unfocused, gazing into space while seeing nothing in particular. The secret: through posture directed to the four directions, and training in the manner of gaze, you practice in the buddha-field. The directions open; space becomes the practice environment itself. The perfect applies the meaning of symbolic words—&quot;song&quot; and so forth. Why song? Because awakened mind is not silent; it is the continuous spontaneous melody of existence. To the utterly unelaborate, open the door of the mind&#x27;s maṇḍala. Definitely begin with the body&#x27;s posture. Accustom yourself to that, apply the manner of gaze. Direct cognition is the symbol of scripture—not intellectual understanding, but recognition itself. A remarkable woman practitioner in Bhutan taught me about posture. She was eighty years old but sat like a young yogi, perfectly straight yet completely relaxed. &quot;Your posture is your statement to yourself,&quot; she said. &quot;When you slump, you say &#x27;I am heavy, I am burdened, I am subject to gravity and time.&#x27; When you sit straight, you say &#x27;I am space, I am awareness, I am free.&#x27; But it must be natural, not forced. Forced posture is just another ego-construction. Find the posture where body remembers its true nature.&quot; She showed me how to align the spine so the central channel <span class="term">(uma)</span> is straight, how to position the hands in the meditation mudra <span class="term">(dhyana mudra)</span> with thumbs touching to complete the circuit of energy, how to tuck the chin slightly to regulate the flow of bindus. &quot;These are not rules,&quot; she emphasized. &quot;They are invitations to body to express what it already knows.&quot; The utterly unelaborate empowerment <span class="term">(shin tu spros med)</span> represents the pinnacle of Atiyoga, the highest of the nine vehicles. Unlike lower vehicles that rely on elaborate ritual, visualization, and gradual transformation, this empowerment introduces the natural state directly. The body&#x27;s posture is crucial because body and mind are not separate. A slumped body produces dullness and torpor. A tense body produces agitation and striving. The seven-point posture of Vairochana—legs crossed, hands in mudra, spine straight, shoulders level, chin tucked, tongue against palate, eyes gazing into space—creates the physical conditions for recognition. But posture alone is insufficient. The inner gaze transforms perception. Eyes open, looking neither at objects nor into blankness, the practitioner gazes into space <span class="term">(bar snang)</span>. This is not spacing out but a highly alert, non-focused awareness that takes the sky or empty space as its support. In this gaze, thoughts cannot maintain their solidity; they dissolve like mist in sunlight. The secret level involves directing this gaze and posture toward the four directions, symbolizing the opening of awareness in all directions without preference or obstruction. Space itself becomes the maṇḍala, the practice environment, the buddha-field. The symbolic words—&quot;song,&quot; &quot;dance,&quot; &quot;play&quot;—indicate that awakened mind is not static, not a frozen emptiness, but dynamic, creative, expressive. The natural state sings itself into manifestation. To practice: first, establish the physical posture. Sit comfortably but upright. Let the spine hold itself without effort, like a stack of coins balanced by their own weight. Place the hands in meditation mudra, right on left, thumbs touching. Tuck the chin slightly, not enough to strain but enough to feel the energy channel align. Open the eyes and gaze softly into space—not looking at the wall, not looking at thoughts, just gazing. Rest in that open awareness. When thoughts arise, don&#x27;t follow them. Don&#x27;t push them away. Just remain gazing. They self-liberate. The &quot;song&quot; of mind continues—thoughts, perceptions, sensations—but you rest as the space in which they arise. This is the utterly unelaborate. No visualization. No mantra. No conceptual meditation. Just recognition of what has always been the case. Direct cognition—not thinking about awareness but being awareness. This is the symbol of scripture, the meaning behind all the words, the essence of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Thus, regarding the kinds of bestowed empowerments, there are three approaches. Briefly shown through the definite distinctions of the Four Empowerments—this is for those with sharp faculties who need only the essential pointing. Extensively explained through distinctions of self-face—this unfolds the nuances of recognition, how rigpa manifests in various situations, how to sustain and stabilize. Very extensively elaborated through distinctions of emanation—this reveals how from one recognition, all display arises, how the master&#x27;s blessing transmits, how the student ripens. Regarding the first approach, the valid establishment of the Four Empowerments&#x27; certainty: this is not arbitrary construction. The four ripen like teeth in a child—natural stages of maturation. Showing examples of this ripening: the vase empowerment like a seed planted, the secret like water nourishing, the wisdom-knowledge like warmth and light, the word like full flowering. Explaining the nature of each reveals how obscurations are purified, how latencies are awakened, how the result is made manifest. Three aspects emerge from each empowerment: the ripening of what was potential, the purification of what obscured, and the manifestation of what was always present. My root teacher once explained the three approaches using the analogy of a mountain. &quot;For some students, I simply point to the mountain and say &#x27;Climb.&#x27; They understand. This is the brief approach. For others, I must describe the path, the rest stops, the dangers, the viewpoints along the way. This is the extensive approach. For still others, I must tell stories of those who climbed before, describe the view from the summit in detail, inspire them with poetry and song until they are compelled to climb themselves. This is the very extensive approach. But the mountain is the same. The summit is the same. Only the method of approach differs.&quot; He then laughed and added, &quot;And of course, the secret teaching is that there is no mountain, no climber, and no summit. But you can&#x27;t start with that. Or rather, you can, but very few can hear it.&quot; The three approaches to empowerment reflect the three capacities of beings: sharp, medium, and dull faculties. This is not a value judgment but a recognition of individual differences in karmic readiness. The brief approach <span class="term">(bsdus pa)</span> presents the essential structure of the Four Empowerments without extensive elaboration. It assumes the recipient already has a stable foundation in practice and needs only the crucial pointing. The extensive approach <span class="term">(rgyas pa)</span> unfolds the self-face <span class="term">(rang ngo)</span> of rigpa—how it appears in meditation, post-meditation, sleep, dream, death, and the bardo. It teaches methods for sustaining recognition in all states and circumstances. The very extensive approach <span class="term">(shin tu rgyas pa)</span> explains emanation <span class="term">(sprul pa)</span>—how the master&#x27;s blessing manifests, how the student&#x27;s potential ripens, how the result emerges from the ground. This includes detailed teachings on the guru principle, the lineage of blessing, the signs of progress, and the obstacles that arise. The certainty of the Four Empowerments is established through scripture <span class="term">(lung)</span>, reasoning <span class="term">(rigs pa)</span>, and instruction <span class="term">(man ngag)</span>—the three valid sources of knowledge in Buddhism. The analogy of ripening teeth beautifully illustrates the natural, spontaneous quality of spiritual maturation. A child doesn&#x27;t decide to grow teeth; they emerge according to natural law when conditions are right. Similarly, the empowerments don&#x27;t create enlightenment but allow what is latent to manifest. The vase empowerment plants the seed of buddhahood in the mental continuum. The secret empowerment waters it with bliss-emptiness experience. The wisdom-knowledge empowerment provides the warmth and light of discriminating awareness. The word empowerment brings full flowering—the direct recognition of rigpa. The purification that occurs is not of something truly impure but of the misconception of impurity. The latencies <span class="term">(bag chags)</span> are not destroyed but transformed—like ice melting into water, they become the display of wisdom. The result is not newly achieved but newly recognized. This is the unique Dzogchen view: ground and fruition are not separate. The three aspects—ripening, purification, manifestation—describe a single process viewed from different angles. What ripens is the potential for recognition. What purifies is the obscuration preventing recognition. What manifests is the recognition itself. All three are aspects of the natural state revealing itself to itself.</div>

But who is hearing? When you hear the wind, is the wind outside or inside? When you hear your own mind, is the mind inside or outside? The sound and the hearer are not two. This is the spontaneous sound—awareness hearing itself. See the distinction. Who makes it? Empty. This is the key: awareness recognizing itself. Not awareness looking at something. Not awareness looking at itself. Just awareness. This is the spontaneous sound. The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

  <div class="commentary-content">The stains that cling to your body, speech, mind, and consciousness—these are not your true nature! Like dust settling on a mirror, they obscure but do not change what is already perfect and pure. The four empowerments are the waters that wash these stains away. Body, speech, mind, consciousness—each carries four stains, sixteen in total. But look deeper! These sixteen multiply through elaboration-with and elaboration-without, sign and meaning, until thirty-two obscurations stand purified. Like a lotus rising through muddy water, you emerge unstained! Listen well, practitioner! The teaching divides the stains systematically. First, the body carries stains from the four elements—earth, water, fire, wind. Each element divides further: earth has earth, water has water, fire has fire, wind has wind. These sixteen purify through the empowerments. Then the divisions multiply: hot and cold each divide, creating sixty-four. Sign and meaning each divide again—sixty-four more. Thus the body alone produces hundreds of apparent stains, all arising from element-play. But what are these stains really? The text reveals: thinking virtue and non-virtue, prophecy and non-prophecy, grasping and rejecting—these thoughts are the very stains themselves! Who is the thinker? Search and you will find only empty space. Like searching for the color of the sky—you look everywhere and find nothing to grasp! Doubt is the demon that binds you. Analysis is the net that ensnares you. Release the mind that holds objects variously! Let thoughts arise and dissolve like clouds in the vast sky of awareness. The thirty-two stains purify not through effort but through recognition—seeing their true nature as emptiness! Emaho! The stains were never real! The eightfold path of purification reveals itself: elaboration-with sign and meaning, elaboration-without sign and meaning, very elaboration-without, and extremely elaboration-without. Each doorway leads to the same primordial purity. Like rivers flowing to the ocean—all paths converge in realization! These four divisions each have four purposes. For speech: expression, expressed, expression, expression—four seals that liberate. For mind: change, changer, changed, change—four seals that destroy. For consciousness: memory, thought, doubt, attachment—four seals that purify. The five doors hold objects, thought basis-consciousness arises. If not connected: meaning before-after, mind examining meaning—these are what the mind calls thinking. Thus the self-face differs in each: outer, inner, secret, perfect—four-four, sixteen exist. The emanation difference shows extensively: body action relies on certain difference, Empowerment nature shows; number difference relies, action affliction purifies shows.</div>

Body&#x27;s elements particular: earth and so on, each with four—earth&#x27;s earth and so on—sixteen. Hot and cold two divisions make sixty-four, sign-meaning division&#x27;s sixty-four empowerments purify! Also four elements each well divided: sixty-four. Pervading element general body and self-characteristic held actual body two divisions—earth has different bodies hundred twenty-eight. Similarly divided, water, fire, wind each hundred twenty-eight, three sets, combined five hundred twelve bodies ripen! Thus outer body ripens, inner afflictions too: desire—looking, laughing, holding, embracing—four, each element&#x27;s body four-by-four, sixteen. Delusion—dulled unknowing, obscured, intoxicated, greatly non-recognition mixed—four divided into four, sixteen. Hatred—hating, great hating, greatly hating. Pride—subtle, coarse, change, expand. Jealousy—light, heavy, agitated, subtle. Each sixteen, total eighty. These difference separate: element body different five hundred twelve each; affliction four-four number: twenty-twenty dwell. All sum: ten thousand one hundred forty-eight arise. Body affliction two count sum: ten thousand six hundred sixty purify stain. Do you see? Five hundred twelve bodies without, sixteen afflictions within—all from element-play! Your confusion is element-dance! The elements play within you—earth solidity, water fluidity, fire warmth, wind movement. From these, all appearances arise. From these, all stains appear.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. Contemporary mind makes distinctions. Contemporary recognition sees through. Direct. Immediate. Now let me unfold what has been folded. The first section shows elaborate distinctions: elaborate-elaborate: Samaya drink water—outer. Elaborate-unelaborate: Mandala enters, deity shows name, Empowerment bestows—inner. Elaborate-very unelaborate: Sravaka vow gives, nine complete breath-out encouragement—secret. Elaborate-utterly unelaborate: vase certain, body seal perfect. This also: vase certain palace relies, deity clear, Empowerment perfect—outer elaborate. Student body-deity produces, four elements purify, substance sun-moon gives—inner unelaborate. Consort gives, practice certain—secret very unelaborate. Sign meaning certain, word gives perfect—utterly unelaborate. Thus perfect four exist; other three must know. The sixteen elaborate difference purposes: Body—four elements four destroy. Four elements—earth, earth etc. four separate—sixteen purify: purpose exists. Second—unelaborate: four Empowerments self-face difference. Unelaborate-elaborate: body, speech, mind, consciousness four syllable place, four purify—outer. That unelaborate: three doors basis, effort beyond shows—inner. That very unelaborate: five objects path raises, five doors hair-release liberates—secret. That utterly unelaborate: realization special produces, perfect. The four purposes: Speech object, expression, expressed, expression—four seal liberates. Third—very unelaborate self-face difference: That unelaborate: Mandala offer, request—inner. That very unelaborate: sky Mandala enters—secret. That utterly unelaborate: knowing self introduces, perfect. Four purposes: mind change, changer, changed, change—four seal destroys. Fourth—utterly unelaborate self-face difference: That unelaborate: gaze does—inner. That very unelaborate: four directions gaze stance relies—secret. That utterly unelaborate: go and perfect. Four purposes: mind think, memory, thought, attachment—four seal destroys. Thus the empowerments purify: body, speech, mind, consciousness four stain purify, rely establish. That body: water collection Dharma collection, binding seal stain become. Fire: those ripen clear thing establish, stain become. Wind: those each action done, attachment self-tendency stain become. For consciousness: memory object enter—stain. Think virtue non-virtue, prophecy not-prophecy four all provoke—stain. Doubt, examine—stain. Hold object various thought—stain. The stains purify through the four Empowerments: elaborate-elaborate etc. four-four separate—sixteen. Those body, speech, mind, consciousness four each stain four-four—sixteen collection purify. The first elaborate shows: elaborate-elaborate: sign elaborate, meaning elaborate—two. That unelaborate: sign meaning—two. Very unelaborate—two. Utterly unelaborate: sign meaning—two: eight. Thus unelaborate: sign unelaborate etc.—eight. Very unelaborate—eight. Utterly unelaborate—eight: thirty-two become. Body, speech, mind, consciousness four collection also. Thus separate thirty-two purify. Creation stage purify: purify know purpose exists. Thus purify stain thirty-two. Purify Empowerment thirty-two sum. Sixty-four purify-purify difference certain. Now the third section unfolds: showing the means of purifying body and afflictions through divisions of number. From the four types of Empowerment, the path reveals itself systematically. Walking the high passes... traversed these classifications in his youth. I memorized the lists, cataloged the stains, counted my obscurations. Years passed in compilation. Then one day, in a mountain cave, I saw: the stains are the purification. The Clouds pass through sky—the shapes are not the space. is not the moon. The list of stains is not the stains themselves. The map is not the territory. The moment I recognized this, the lists lost their binding power. The stains were never real to begin with—they were appearances in awareness, no more solid than reflections in a mirror. The text reveals with precision: the stains arise from body, speech, mind, consciousness. These four each carry four stains—sixteen total. But these sixteen multiply through the elaborations: with sign, without sign, with meaning, without meaning, very elaborate, extremely elaborate—until thirty-two appear. Then sign and meaning divide again, creating sixty-four. Each sixty-four multiplies again through hot and cold, element and pervading, until the numbers become astronomical. Some might despair at so many stains. But the practitioner who understands sees: all these numbers describe the same one thing—ordinary mind appearances. What is the practical application? The empowerments are not ceremonies performed externally. They are the recognition of what you already are. When you see the stains clearly, that seeing purifies. When you recognize confusion, that recognition liberates. The empowerments are the water that washes away the dust—but the water and the dust are both appearances in the same mirror. The elaborate system exists for those who need structure. For the sharpest practitioners, one recognition suffices. For those with more obscuration, the elaborate path provides countless doorways, each leading to the same room. Every catalog of stains is a catalog of what to recognize. Every list of purifications is a point that liberation is possible. The Tibetan masters designed these systems with compassion—knowing that different minds need different approaches. I have seen practitioners trapped in the elaboration. They memorize the lists perfectly but forget the pointing. They can recite sixty-four empowerments but cannot recognize mind&#x27;s nature. This is the disease of the letter killing the spirit. Conversely, I have seen those who reject all elaboration as mere concepts—they fall into laziness, thinking enlightenment will happen spontaneously without practice. This is the disease of presumption. The Middle Way walks between: using the elaboration while not being bound by it. The empowerments divide as method and wisdom. Method is the skillful means—visualizations, mantras, mudras, rituals. Wisdom is the direct recognition of reality. Together they form the two wings of the bird of enlightenment. Without method, wisdom has no vehicle. Without wisdom, method has no destination. In the Great Perfection, these two are not separate—they arise together, shine together, dissolve together in the single sphere of rigpa. The number divisions show how vast the system is. The body ripens into five hundred twelve forms. The afflictions multiply similarly. In total, over ten thousand one hundred forty-eight stains appear. Yet all arise from the same source: the five elements playing within awareness. The elements are earth solidity, water fluidity, fire warmth, wind movement, space openness. These five are not outside you—they are your own body, speech, mind, consciousness, awareness. The stains and their purification are all element-play. Thus, dear practitioner, whatever stains appear—whether thirty-two or ten thousand one hundred forty-eight—know this: they are all element-play. The elements dance within you. The stains are the dance. The purification is recognizing the dance as dance. The dancer was never separate from the dance. Rest in that recognition—the stains purify themselves, without effort, without doer.</div>

When recognized, these numbers are not obstacles but manifestations of wisdom. The empowerments are not ceremonies performed outside. They are the recognition of what is already present. The empowerment arrangement is the secret mantra vajra vehicle&#x27;s dharma door, the first basis. The unsurpassed secret mantra door is all samaya, important.

First samaya&#x27;s essence, definitive term, division, basis, benefit, fault. During my wandering years... says: the elaborate system exists for those who need it. For the highest practitioners, one recognition suffices. The numbers describe what happens when recognition dawns. When the five wisdoms arise, they manifest as the five Buddha families. When the kayas appear, they are your own body, speech, mind recognized. The wrathful and peaceful aspects are not two—they are the same wisdom, appearing differently according to the needs of the moment. The clairvoyances are not supernatural powers to be attained. They are the natural abilities of awareness when obscuration is removed. When the eye of wisdom becomes stainless, you see all Buddha bodies. When the ear of wisdom becomes pure, you hear all sounds as dharma. When the mind of wisdom becomes clear, you know all others&#x27; minds. These are not achievements—they are revelations. The practitioner does not gain something new but reveals what was always present. Thus, dear one, the elaborate enumeration of three thousand one hundred twenty is your own face. The kayas are not outside—they are your own body when recognized. The wrathful deities are not frightening—they are your own awareness, wild and free. The peaceful deities are not to be grasped—they are your own wisdom, naturally at rest. Rest in that recognition, and all these elaborate manifestations arise from that rest and dissolve back into that rest. Now I will explain in more detail the nature of the empowerments and their results. The teaching divides into five sections: first, the five perfections with field and emanation making eight. Second, the four authentic bodies. Third, the peace body and wrathful body. Fourth, the thirty-two marks from thirty-two empowerments. Fifth, the hundred eighty clairvoyances. Each empowerment opens a door. Each door reveals an aspect of wisdom. The thirty-two empowerments transform into thirty-two marks of a Buddha. These are not external marks painted on a body—they are the qualities of awareness manifesting. When you recognize mind&#x27;s nature, these qualities appear naturally. They are not achieved through effort but revealed through recognition. The six clairvoyances that arise from prajna&#x27;s purification: the divine eye sees all forms throughout all Buddha-fields. The divine ear hears all sounds throughout all worlds. The knowledge of others&#x27; minds knows all thoughts of all beings. The memory of past lives recalls all previous existences. The divine sight sees all things as they truly are. The exhaustion of contaminants sees the path to liberation clearly. These six are not supernatural abilities attained through practice. They are the natural clarity of awareness when not obscured by conceptuality. The practitioner does not develop them—they are uncovered. Like the sun appearing when clouds disperse. The clouds are the three poisons, the concepts, the grasping at self. When these clear, the six clairvoyances shine naturally. The transformation of the thirty-two empowerments produces thirty virtues. These are not moral virtues in the ordinary sense—they are the qualities of a Buddha&#x27;s mind. The tamedprajas produce the virtue of all-understanding. The trained prajas produce the virtue of direct realization. The applied prajas produce the virtue of all-knowing speech. The conceptual prajas produce the virtue of understanding all dharmas. The meditation-born prajas produce the virtue of like-space awareness. The wisdom clairvoyances: mirror-like wisdom sees all phenomena without distortion. Equality wisdom sees samsara and nirvana as non-dual. Discriminating wisdom knows the specific faculties of all beings. All-accomplishing wisdom accomplishes all purposes without effort. Dharmadhatu wisdom knows all Buddha virtues. Non-abiding wisdom knows freedom from all fixation. These thirty-six wisdom clairvoyances arise from the thirty-two empowerments. They are not separate achievements but aspects of the one wisdom. Like the one sun appearing through different windows. The wisdom is one, its aspects are many. The thirty clairvoyances from the liberation of outflows: when body outflows exhaust, the practitioner sees all bodies as empty. When speech outflows exhaust, the practitioner hears all sounds as mantra. When mind outflows exhaust, the practitioner knows all thoughts as wisdom. When consciousness outflows exhaust, the practitioner sees all appearances as display. When prajna outflows exhaust, the practitioner knows all dharmas as empty. When dharmata outflows exhaust, the practitioner rests in non-dual awareness. The thirty clairvoyances from the karma manifest: these perfect the Buddha&#x27;s knowing. The actual body&#x27;s six see all Buddha bodies. The body-appearance&#x27;s six enjoy infinite light. The actual speech&#x27;s six enjoy sixty speech-tones. The speech-appearance&#x27;s six enjoy various sounds. The actual mind&#x27;s six enjoy all samadhis. The mind-appearance&#x27;s six enjoy knowing others&#x27; minds. The dharmata&#x27;s six clairvoyances reveal the non-division of awareness and appearance. One hundred eighty clairvoyances in total—all are your own face! The elaboration-having empowerment multiplies into hundred eighty. The elaboration-without empowerment transforms conceptual, wisdom, and contact aspects into hundred eighty. The very elaboration-without produces three sets of hundred eighty. The utterly elaboration-without produces dharma-pure hundred eighty. Thus the ground joins with three thousand one hundred twenty virtues. This is the display of Vajradhara&#x27;s ground clairvoyance. The empowerment arrangement is the secret mantra vajra vehicle&#x27;s first basis. The samaya: the samaya&#x27;s nature is general—the commitment to view and meditation. Body, speech, mind&#x27;s samaya is particular—the pledges of each level. The unsurpassed samaya is supreme—the commitment to A simple practitioner...ld wanderer has traveled these paths. I have seen the peaceful deities in vision, the wrathful blazing in my mind. I have counted the marks, cataloged the clairvoyances, mapped the empowerments. Then I saw: all of these were my own mind playing with itself. The map is not the territory. The A signpost points north—the wood is not the destination. is not the moon. Rest in that recognition, and the elaborate system becomes a support, not a chain.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Therefore. Thus. We analyze the logical faults. Spontaneous presence as the sole basis fails under scrutiny. Not because it is wrong. Because it is incomplete. Like describing an elephant by its tail alone. The text gives logical reasons: If cause and effect were both primordially spontaneously accomplished from the very beginning without any dependence on recognition, then cause and effect would necessarily exist simultaneously as one essence, rendering all distinction meaningless. If the cause is established as samsara, the effect would clearly not be able to manifest as nirvana, for they would be identical. If samsara and nirvana were truly one essence, then samsara would necessarily follow wherever nirvana is present. And nirvana following upon samsara would cause those two to be one without distinction—an absurd consequence. Pure and impure cannot exist simultaneously as cause and effect if they are one substance. This is not philosophical hair-splitting—this is the precise medicine needed for precise diseases of view.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">From Klongdrukpa: Spontaneous accomplishment being posited as the ground is truly not the correct basis. If it were, sentient beings without effort would never attain liberation. Non-recognition becomes the cause of continued obscuration. If mere awareness were sufficient for liberation, then liberation would not be distinct from ordinary existence. Like charcoal upon black earth cannot be cleaned to appear white. Cause and effect would remain separate without connection. The tantra speaks in analogies the mind can grasp. Charcoal and black earth—same nature, different appearance. You cannot wash charcoal white. Not because washing fails. Because the nature <span class="term">(rang bzhin)</span> is black. Liberation requires recognition, not just presence. Samantabhadra declares: This teaching of spontaneous presence exists merely among conventional dharmas known by intellect. It is not the correct essence of the ultimate basis. Even the Primordial Buddha distinguishes between conventional description and ultimate reality. Thus it is declared: mere unceasing display cannot truly constitute the authentic recognition of realization. If cause and effect were established as truly one without distinction, then recognition and resting in one&#x27;s own nature would become entirely unnecessary, rendering the direct path meaningless. To merely name unceasing display as the ground without understanding its true relation to primordial purity is not a meaning that can be genuinely understood or established through direct recognition.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Second position: uncertainty as the basis. Because awareness is not established as definite entity, it remains uncertain. Because conditions transform it, it remains without fixed nature. The Mind Section teaches: From manifold names given to uncertainty, meaning is merely labels, empty like echoes. This practitioner once loved uncertainty. It felt spacious. Liberating. No fixed views. No certainties to defend. Then he saw: uncertainty itself becomes a fixed view. The open door becomes another prison. The Semde teachings say: From the manifold names and designations given to uncertainty, the meaning too is merely labels, empty in themselves like echoes. Because the nature is not determined as singular or fixed, whatever label is applied through convention appears accordingly without inherent reality.</div>

If uncertain basis were cause of samsara, it would be determined as confusion. If basis of nirvana, determined as purity. Both cannot be true. If inherently pure, impurity cannot arise. If uncertain, samsara and nirvana mix without distinction. Buddhas would revert to confusion. The basis would become mind&#x27;s possession rather than nature. The logic is merciless. Each position examined finds its own destruction. This is not cruelty. It is compassion wearing the mask of destruction. The positions must die so recognition can live. Further faults: If the ground remains uncertain without any determinate ground or established nature, samsara and nirvana would mutually mix together without distinction, destroying the path and fruition. If the ground is fundamentally uncertain and changes in every regard without any stability, all sentient beings would be liberated without any effort or practice whatsoever, while fully awakened Buddhas would revert to impure confusion, once again engaging with suffering. Moreover, asserting only uncertainty would itself constitute a form of determination, contradicting the original claim.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">See. Know. Be. The Klongdrukpa confirms: The basis taught as fundamentally uncertain and indeterminate—this too cannot truly constitute the authentic basis of reality. I understand at this level of intelligence and analysis that effects must necessarily possess alternation and change, or become endowed with reversion to their cause. The uncertain itself becomes determined through its own existence, and thus the uncertain becomes determined despite claims otherwise. Because uncertainty must exist in itself to be asserted, being determined would be like the exhaustion of all possible action. [1] Between the position and its refutation, the vast middle way opens. Not spontaneous presence alone. Not uncertainty alone. The unity of primordial purity and spontaneous presence. Ka dag and lhun grub as indivisible. This is the authentic Great Perfection.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Thus. We proceed. One without learning... waited for gradual progress. Then a bird called. Immediate. Complete. Now the third position arises: Because the essence of awareness does not change in its nature, it is like space itself—pervasive and unchanging. Appearances, being unable to change in their fundamental nature, are accepted as determined and fixed, like the nature of fire and water. But this too fails logical scrutiny: If the essence of awareness does not change in any way and appearances likewise cannot change, then samsara arising from that unchanging ground is not logically valid, and consequently no one could possibly attain liberation from what never arose. If nirvana existed primordially as an unchanging essence, there would be no difference from the eternalists&#x27; view of permanence maintained by non-Buddhist philosophers. Furthermore, if one accepts that the essence of samsara, already being nirvana in itself, does not change, then if the essence itself is already nirvana without change, liberation through practice would not be necessary at all—just as fire, being hot by its very nature, requires no change or effort to become hot. If one says this analysis is necessary only regarding mental appearances and not the basis itself, this contradicts the fundamental position that appearances cannot change if the ground is unchanging. Being that the appearance of samsara itself manifests from the basis, if one says it is not the appearance of the basis but something separate, it necessarily follows that that basis would possess duality—appearing and not appearing—which is absurd. Moreover, if one realizes that basis and accepts determination, it cannot constitute the authentic basis that transcends all extremes. If a basis of realization were to exist inherently before realization itself occurs, then a merely cognizing mind arises independently, and thus realization does not depend upon realizing the basis—making realization meaningless. Yet the basis depends upon the mind of realization to be known, creating circular dependence. Because realization must exist beforehand to realize the basis, this logical error pervades the entire position. The Klongdrukpa declares: Regarding the determined basis that is taught by some proponents, this too is not the correct essence of the authentic basis. Just as for those with the eye disease of yellowing vision, a pure white conch appears mistakenly as yellow, through the distinction of reversion to oneself and other, self and other are free of the two extremes of determination. Therefore that view too is not correct upon analysis. Because cause is determined and effect is determined as identical, the self becomes no different from the eternalist view of permanence. Now the fourth position: The essence is not divided into directions or categories in its true nature, while appearances are changeable in whatever manner through conditions. But if the basis were truly changeable in its essence, pure enlightened Buddhas would devolve into impure confusion. Furthermore, whoever accepts this unacceptable consequence follows that sentient beings, without any effort or practice, spontaneously change into Buddhas and are liberated. Also, effect would illogically revert to cause, destroying temporal sequence. Earth and other material elements would become awareness, and awareness would also devolve into matter—absurd consequences. The reasoning continues: If that which is not divided into categories of essence in the basis itself changes, or if appearances other than essence change, if the essence itself changes, essence cannot coherently be called the basis. Because it would change into a dharma other than the authentic basis. If appearances other than essence change, the essence itself would be damaged by changing somewhere, compromising its integrity. Does the permanent change, or does the impermanent change in this view? The permanent cannot change by definition, like space which remains unaltered. The impermanent does not need to change through effort, for it has already changed by its very nature. Also, through the reasoning of the three times—past, present, and future—past and future cannot be changed, being non-existent in the present moment. The present has already arisen and immediately ceased, so it cannot be changed. The later part of a moment is not yet born, being non-existent, so there is nothing to change. Because change cannot be perceived in any of the three times, that the ground is changeable in whatever way is not logically valid. The Klongdrukpa concludes: If one&#x27;s own state of the ground is held to be changeable, this too is no different from being fundamentally undetermined. Because effect itself reverts to cause without sequence, effort becomes unnecessary for those who hold this view. Because again and again it reverts circularly, who could possibly make matter into awareness? It is not possible by any valid reasoning. Fifth position: Because awareness, in its essence, has no fixed direction and arises pervasively everywhere, it accepts whatever arises without discrimination. This too fails—if it accepts appearances, does it dwell in the basis as the same essence, or does it not dwell in the basis as separate?</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The dispute: If permanent and impermanent exist together—if impermanent appears but permanent does not, then anything goes. Similarly, samsara would be liberated without recognition, and liberated ones would revert to confusion. Second dispute: Rabbit horns and son of barren woman—if these impossible things could create samsara and nirvana, endless faults follow. Response: The Buddha taught that these are projections of not recognizing one&#x27;s own face—establishing all as existing through delusion. Because faults of non-recognition are endless, these positions fail. The sixth position: Because essence appears everywhere, variegated appearances arise through not recognizing. This must be examined: Is multiplicity external appearance, internal consciousness, or aggregation? If external: ground would appear manifold externally. If internal: ground would be momentary, conceptual, afflicted. If aggregation: ground would be dualistic. All lead to contradiction. The recognition that liberates is always immediate. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. After centuries of concealment: the treasure was never hidden. Rediscovery reveals what was always present.

From emptiness, how do complete qualities arise? Thus he spoke: From the miracle of unborn nature, as the activity of Buddhas, primordially without obstruction, without ceasing and without not-ceasing, appearance itself is primordially pure, abiding in its own face. From indivisible great compassion, spontaneous presence arises indeterminately, appearing as eight modes.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">This old fool witnessed birth and death many times. Not just in meditation but in the meadows of Sertar&#x27;s turning—seeds sprouting, rivers freezing and thawing, stars dying and birthing. The gandharva: not a spirit but the seeking itself, the impulse toward form, the gravity of becoming. White and red: father-mother, method-wisdom, skillful means and emptiness. Meeting in the red palace at the navel center—this is not anatomy textbook but the body&#x27;s own tantra written in flesh and blood.</div>

Thus body tip head: channels enumeration letters connection-like arranged, tip arranged wheel called. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked. The nature is complete. Now I will explain further. This section describes the process of embryonic development and the arising of consciousness. The ancient masters understood that consciousness does not arise from nothing—it arises from specific conditions, specific causes and effects. The process is intricate, detailed, systematic. The numbers describe the stages of development: the channels, the elements, the sense faculties, the mental factors. The mind arises from the elements. The water element gathers, holding the thought-basis. The fire element radiates to objects. The wind element moves as light. These are not metaphors—they describe the actual process of consciousness. The mind-itself is unborn meaning, unceasing mindfulness, unchanging example-meaning-mixed, self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated. The mental factors arise from specific conditions. Thoroughly-searching mindfulness, when pure, is clear as a god&#x27;s body; when impure, throws one into god&#x27;s migration; when perverted, throws one into wrong-attachment body. Definitively-settling mental mindfulness, when pure, obtains the awareness-holder; when impure, one is born as god-asura; when perverted, into the butcher&#x27;s lineage. The six migrations are the six realms: gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings, demigods. Each arises from a specific type of mindfulness. Moving-maker-grasping mind, when pure, becomes wheel-grasping yoga; when impure, leads to hell; when perverted, to suffering. The thoroughly-investigating mind with wind-horse arises from previous-memory following-grasping. The definitively-settling mind with earth-horse arises from past-branched memory. The definitively-grasping mind with water-horse arises from present-memory following-grasping. The process of embryonic development is described in intricate detail. From elements to channels, from channels to body, from body to faculties, from faculties to limbs. Each stage is precise. Each number has meaning. The ancient yogis mapped this process through direct observation—not of external anatomy, but of their own consciousness entering the body. One without learning... has traversed these stages. In the bardo, consciousness enters the body gradually. First the wind, then the channels, then the elements, then the body. The process is not random—it follows specific patterns. The mind enters through the crown, descends through the channels, settles in the heart. This is the process of birth—not just physical birth, but the birth of consciousness in a new form. The numbers describe the completeness of the system. The channels are sixteen, then thirty-two, then sixty-four. The wisdom aspects are sixteen, then thirty-two. The letters are sixteen, then forty-eight. The light spheres are sixteen, then sixty-four. The system is vast, intricate, complete. It describes every aspect of existence. The practitioner who understands this knows that the body is not separate from consciousness. The channels are not mere tubes—they are the pathways of awareness. The elements are not mere matter—they are the qualities of awareness. The faculties are not mere organs—they are the gateways of wisdom. When recognized, the body becomes the mandala, the channels become the deities, the elements become the wisdom aspects. Thus, do not despise the body. Do not think that awareness is separate from flesh. The body is the vehicle of enlightenment. The channels are the pathways of wisdom. The elements are the display of awareness. Recognize this, and the body becomes the palace of the buddAn old traveler...nderer has traversed these stages. In the bardo, consciousness enters the body gradually. First the wind, then the channels, then the elements, then the body. The process is not random—it follows specific patterns. The mind enters through the crown, descends through the channels, settles in the heart. This is the process of birth—not just physical birth, but the birth of consciousness in a new form. The numbers describe the completeness of the system. The channels are sixteen, then thirty-two, then sixty-four. The wisdom aspects are sixteen, then thirty-two. The letters are sixteen, then forty-eight. The light spheres are sixteen, then sixty-four. The system is vast, intricate, complete. It describes every aspect of existence. The practitioner who understands this knows that the body is not separate from consciousness. The channels are not mere tubes—they are the pathways of awareness. The elements are not mere matter—they are the qualities of awareness. The faculties are not mere organs—they are the gateways of wisdom. When recognized, the body becomes the mandala, the channels become the deities, the elements become the wisdom aspects. The process of embryonic development is not merely physical—it is the descent of consciousness into form. The mind, in the bardo, sees the parents and is drawn to them. The karmic connection, the affinity, the attachment—all these draw the mind into the womb. The consciousness enters the father&#x27;s seed, combines with the mother&#x27;s blood, and begins to grow. The channels form first: the central channel, then the right and left channels, then the subsidiary channels. These are not blood vessels—they are the pathways of awareness. The winds move through them, the bindus flow through them, the mind experiences through them. The channels are the infrastructure of consciousness. The elements then form: earth gives solidity, water gives fluidity, fire gives warmth, wind gives movement, space gives openness. These are not physical elements—they are the qualities of awareness appearing as form. When recognized, the elements become the five wisdoms: earth becomes equality wisdom, water becomes discriminating wisdom, fire becomes mirror-like wisdom, wind becomes all-accomplishing wisdom, space becomes dharmadhatu wisdom. The faculties then develop: the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind. These are the gateways through which awareness experiences the world. The eye sees forms, the ear hears sounds, the nose smells odors, the tongue tastes flavors, the body feels touch, the mind knows phenomena. These are not merely physical organs—they are the six ways awareness experiences. The limbs then form: arms, legs, head, torso. These are not merely flesh—they are the tools of action. The arms act, the legs move, the head perceives, the torso supports. Each part has its function, each part serves awareness. The process is precise. The numbers are exact. This is not speculation—it is observation, refined over centuries. The Tibetan masters understood consciousness because they observed their own consciousness, entering and leaving the body. They mapped the process in detail, leaving us this intricate system. The practitioner who understands this does not cling to the body as self, nor reject it as obstacle. The body is the vehicle of enlightenment. It is the palace in which awareness dwells. It is the mandala of the buddhas. When recognized, the body itself becomes the path. Thus, respect your body. It is not separate from awareness. The channels within you are the pathways of wisdom. The elements within you are the display of awareness. The faculties within you are the gateways of liberation. Recognize this, and every moment becomes practice. Every breath becomes meditation. Every sensation becomes wisdom. The treasury opens by revealing what was never hidden. The body is already complete. Awareness is already present. Liberation is not something to achieve—it is something to recognize. Rest in that recognition, and the body becomes the palace of enlightenment. Now I will explain further the meaning of these elaborate numbers. The system describes consciousness entering the body. First, the all-basis consciousness gathers. This is the storehouse of all karmic imprints, the ground from which all mental events arise. From this, the eighteen elements grow: the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six consciousnesses. These form the ground of experience. The channels develop in stages. The main channels are like rivers, the subsidiary channels like streams, the finest channels like capillaries. All carry the winds, the energies of consciousness. When these winds flow freely, awareness is clear. When they are blocked, confusion arises. The elements form progressively. First, the wind element, the earliest and most subtle. Then, the fire element, providing warmth. Then, the water element, providing fluidity. Then, the earth element, providing solidity. Each element brings specific qualities. Each quality brings specific experiences. The sense faculties develop from the elements. The eye faculty arises from the earth element, clear and discriminating. The ear faculty arises from the space element, open and receptive. The nose arises from water, the tongue from fire, the body from wind. Each faculty has its specific object and consciousness. The mental factors arise as well. Mindfulness, attention, discrimination, ecstasy, equanimity—all these arise from specific combinations of elements and channels. They are not separate from the body—they are functions of the body-mind system. The elaborate enumeration is not mere classification—it is a map. The map describes the territory of consciousness. The territory is vast—so vast that the ancient masters divided it into sections, numbered the sections, and gave names to the divisions. This is not to confuse—it is to help us understand. The numbers describe completeness. The sixteen channels become thirty-two, become sixty-four. The sixteen wisdoms become thirty-two. The sixteen letters become forty-eight. The light spheres become sixty-four. Each multiplication describes an increase in refinement. Each refinement brings us closer to the source. This system was not invented—it was discovered. The masters observed their own consciousness in meditation. They observed consciousness entering the body at birth, leaving at death, moving in the bardo. They observed the stages of embryonic development and mapped them to the movement of consciousness. The result is this elaborate system. The practitioner who understands this does not cling to the body as self. The body is not the self—it is a manifestation of awareness. But neither does the practitioner reject the body as obstacle. The body is the vehicle of liberation. It is the palace in which awareness dwells. It is the mandala of the five wisdoms. Thus, treat your body with respect. It is not merely flesh—it is the temple of awareness. The channels within you are the pathways of wisdom. The elements within you are the display of awareness. The faculties within you are the gateways of liberation. When recognized, every part of the body becomes Buddha-field, every moment becomes practice. The ancient texts say: the body is the complete Buddha. The five aggregates are the five kayas. The four elements are the four wisdoms. The six sense faculties are the six elements of enlightenment. This is not metaphor—it is description of what is, when recognized. Therefore, do not seek enlightenment elsewhere. Do not think you must go somewhere else, become something else, achieve something else. The enlightenment is here, in this body, in this mind, in this moment. Rest in recognition, and the body reveals itself as the palace of the buddhas. The channels reveal themselves as the pathways of wisdom. The elements reveal themselves as the display of awareness. This is the teaching of the Great Perfection: the ground is already complete. The path is already present. The result is already achieved. We do not create enlightenment—we recognize it. We do not achieve wisdom—we uncover it. Secret completion: the treasury is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight was never obscuDuring my wandering years...anderer has traveled these paths. I have seen consciousness enter the body. I have felt the descent of awareness into form. I have experienced the stages of embryonic development from within. What I tell you is from direct observation, refined through years of practice. The body is not an obstacle to enlightenment—it is the very ground of enlightenment. The channels are not separate from awareness—they are awareness taking form. The elements are not mere matter—they are awareness appearing as experience. When you recognize this, the body becomes the mandala, the channels become the deities, the elements become the wisdoms. Do not think the body is impure. The body is pure—from the beginning, pure. Do not think the mind is impure. The mind is pure—from the beginning, pure. The impurity is the not recognizing. The confusion is the not seeing. When recognition dawns, impurity reveals itself as purity. When awareness sees itself, confusion reveals itself as wisdom. The elaborate numbers in this text describe this process. They are not meant to bind you in complexity. They are meant to reveal the intricacy of awareness. Each number, each division, each enumeration A signpost points north—the wood is not the destination. something real. The system is comprehensive because awareness is comprehensive. The system is intricate because experience is intricate. But remember: the map is not the territory. The Sitting still, mind wanders. The wandering Asking &#x27;Who am I?&#x27;—the question points, but is not the knowing. what doesn&#x27;t move. is not the moon. The numbers describe the description—they are not the thing described. Rest in recognition. Let the descriptions arise and dissolve. NOW! The treasury blazes open! Was never closed! Immediate revelation!.</div>

The three channels are not merely physical structures—they are the architecture of how primordial purity manifests as experience. Roma carries the red essence, kyangma the white, kundarma the union.

From the wheel location: At the throat enjoyment wheel dwell three hundred forty major channels. Having seven wheels in sequence: the first wheel&#x27;s leaves are ten. The rest are all like that. All have twenty at the end. These are the channel types. The text reveals the channels in detail. The channel petals are sixteen in number. From these, inner and outer divide into countless minor leaves. The inner channels: three hundred sixty-seven coarse channels dwelling in the coils of seven wheels. The channel-abiding wheel: throat enjoyment wheel, channels great three hundred sixty-four dwell. The wheel sequence has seven: first sequence&#x27;s petals, aspects ten. Remainder all also those same. All&#x27;s end twenty. The channels are not merely physical tubes—they are the pathways of wisdom. The ancient yogis discovered through direct observation that awareness has channels, just as the body has meridians. These channels are not flesh but the highways of energy and wisdom. When the channels are pure, awareness flows freely. When they are blocked, confusion arises. This is the ground of the channel practices in Dzogchen.</div>

Left a-named great-turtle channel—cut for madness-fainting. One without learning... says: the channels are the medicine. The disease is confusion. The cure is recognition. The channels of the body are not separate from the channels of awareness. When you recognize the nature of mind, the channels purify themselves. No external medicine is needed. The healer and healed are one. The elaborate system of channels, wheels, and bindus is not meant to bind you in complexity. It is meant to reveal the subtlety of awareness. The ancient masters mapped the inner landscape as a guide. But the map is not the territory. The channels are appearances in awareness. The awareness that knows the channels is beyond the channels. Rest in that awareness. The channels will then display as the mandala of enlightenment—not because you visualized them so, but because they always were that. Now I will explain further the practice. The channels are not static structures—they flow with wisdom wind. When the wind enters the central channel, awareness becomes clear. This is the goal of the tummo practice: to draw the winds into the center. When the winds gather in the central channel, the bindu rises. When the bindu rises, the wisdom light dawns. This is not imagination—it is the actual transformation of the body into the rainbow body. The seven wheels correspond to seven levels of consciousness. The crown wheel is the gateway to the formless realms. The throat wheel governs speech and communication. The heart wheel is the seat of mind. The navel wheel governs energy and transformation. The secret wheel governs reproduction and creativity. The feet wheel governs movement and action. Each wheel has a specific number of petals: the crown has one thousand, the throat has sixteen, the heart has eight, the navel has sixty-four, and so on. These are not literal thousand petals—they represent the variety of mental states that can arise. The bindus: there are many kinds. The white bindu is the essence of wind. The red bindu is the essence of fire. The black bindu is the essence of earth. The blue bindu is the essence of water. The yellow bindu is the essence of space. When these bindus are purified, they become the five wisdoms. The white bindu becomes mirror-like wisdom. The red bindu becomes discriminating wisdom. The black bindu becomes equality wisdom. The blue bindu becomes all-accomplishing wisdom. The yellow bindu becomes dharmadhatu wisdom. The goddesses: there are five main goddesses residing in the wheels. They hold the winds like banners, vases, lassos, boxes, and boats. They are not external beings—they are the personified qualities of wisdom. When the practitioner rests in recognition, these goddesses manifest as the five lights. When the practitioner is confused, they manifest as the five poisons. The transformation is not external—it is the shift from poison to wisdom. The practice methods: for stiff neck, cut the small-tip right channel at the throat. For upper body and head diseases, cut the small-tip left channel. For lung heat, cut the mind-crooked channel at the right shoulder. For all diseases generally, cut the general-channel great at the left shoulder. For poison disease, cut the poison-crooked channel at the sun-center of the right shoulder. For madness and fainting, cut the great-turtle channel at the left shoulder. These are not literal surgeries—they are visualizations that transform the energies. The clearing practices: eight suitable for clearing. When dwelling causes burning, that becomes a fault—two exist. The vital-points are the locations where the channels converge. These are the doorways to deeper awareness. The practitioner who knows these points can direct the winds, gather the bindus, and achieve enlightenment in this very bA cave hermit...nderer has traversed these inner landscapes. In my youth, I studied the maps of channels and wheels. I memorized the names of goddesses, the numbers of petals, the functions of bindus. Then one day, resting in awareness, I saw: all these elaborate systems were appearances in awareness. The channels were not in some body somewhere—they were the display of awareness itself. The goddesses were not external beings—they were the qualities of awareness personified. The bindus were not substances—they were the moments of awareness appearing as light. Thus I tell you: study these systems if you wish—but do not be bound by them. They are A signpost points north—the wood is not the destination. to the moon. Put aside the finger, see the moon, rest in that seeing. The channels will then reveal themselves as the mandala of enlightenment, the wheels as the Palace of Great Perfection, the bindus as the lights of wisdom. This is not achieved—it is recognized. The wealth was always there, in the house of awareness.</div>

These are not random occurrences—they follow the deterioration of elements! Look: the elements deteriorate in sequence, reverse, make effort, and change. When moving, they deteriorate; when reversing, they transform; when making effort, they persist; when changing, they evolve. Past time, if long, changes and removes; future time, if long, shifts and transforms. The present, brief as it is, shows through action and counting of change. One youth moves 21,600 winds in a single day—measure this with water-clock and finger-counts! Eight watches in a day, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts.

  <div class="commentary-content">Look here, practitioner! The year has twelve months, and in each the elements play their game. The sun&#x27;s southern journey brings longer days, the northern return brings longer nights. Six hundred seventy-five winds increase and decrease with each water-clock measure—this is the breath of the world itself! Listen to the numbers: a day has eight watches, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts. Each shift holds 1,350 winds, each finger 338 and one-half plus eight movements, each watch 2,700 movements. Twelve element actions multiply twelve times twelve—this shows how twelve winds develop and decrease. The White Lotus commentary reveals: when the sun travels south, add and subtract time accordingly. Two water-clock measures change each month as the sun moves. See the ground. Walking dissolves. When going south, day lengthens and night shortens; when reversed, day shortens and night lengthens. This is not mere calculation—this is the rhythm of your own life-force! The breath moving 675 times with each water-clock measure reveals the secret of longevity and health. Understand these movements, and you understand the deterioration and renewal of the elements within. This knowledge is the physician&#x27;s wisdom, the yogin&#x27;s clock, the key to mastering the body&#x27;s inner winds. Practice with this understanding, and the channels open, the winds flow freely, and the mind settles into natural luminosity. Do not ignore these teachings as mere technical details—they are the very structure of existence itself!</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Therefore. Thus. Transition to chapter twelve: detailed presentation of bindu essential-points <span class="term">(thig le gnad kyi rnam par bshad pa)</span>. Structural overview: four lamps <span class="term">(sgron ma bzhi)</span> as wisdom supports. Precise pedagogical progression from coarse to subtle, external to internal, conventional to ultimate. The four lamps are like four strings on my instrument. Each plays a different note, but all resonate the same song. The eye lamp sees forms. The bindu lamp holds essence. The wisdom lamp knows. The space lamp is. Four notes, one melody—recognition. [16025-End] This vast chapter on wind differentiation, karma and wisdom, channels and bindus—all skillful means. The wind moves, the practitioner recognizes, liberation dawns. Not through understanding but through recognition. Rest in that. During my wandering years...&#x27;s final word on wind: Don&#x27;t try to control it. Don&#x27;t try to stop it. Don&#x27;t try to make it wisdom wind or prevent it from becoming karma wind. Just recognize. Recognition transforms everything without changing anything. Last words. Wind. Moves. Recognize. Three words, complete teaching. Stop. Rest. The wind completes itself. You complete yourself. Nothing to add. Nothing to remove. This is the Great Perfection.</div>

The water lamp is the essence of awareness appearing as clarity. The clarity of light-essence is the power-support of the agent seeing both pure appearance and deluded appearance. This is the key: both appearances—samsara and nirvana—are gathered in the same awareness. The seeing-holder has not ceased grasping—so we see both pure and impure appearances. When we recognize the nature, both are held in the same awareness.</div>

First essence dot light five rim round surround self-clear color, burning-lamp. Three words. Four lamps. One light. Recognition dawns. From Oddiyana&#x27;s sky: the path blazes as ground itself! Never departed! Now I will explain further the teaching. The water lamp is the clarity of awareness appearing as light. This clarity is not something created—it is the very nature of mind. When awareness is not obscured by concepts, it shines as clarity. This clarity appears as the lights we see in meditation—the points, the lines, the colors. These are not achievements—they are the natural display of awareness. The tantra speaks of far-casting: the appearance seems far because we grasp at it. The rope appears as snake because we do not examine. When we examine, we see the rope and the snake are not two. The rope is empty of snake-nature, yet appears as snake. Similarly, all appearances are empty of inherent existence, yet appear vividly. This is the Middle Way: appearances are neither truly existent nor non-existent. The four lamps: water lamp, emptiness lamp, space lamp, wisdom lamp. These correspond to the four aspects of awareness. The water lamp is the clarity of awareness. The emptiness lamp is the openness of awareness. The space lamp is the expanse of awareness. The wisdom lamp is the knowing of awareness. These four are not separate—they are aspects of the one awareness. The channels: the navel channel produces the burning-lamp. The body enters the mother womb. The body essence gathers at the navel, the great channel knot, the center triangle. Father and mother, cause and condition, produce the eye fruit. The father&#x27;s portion is white, the mother&#x27;s portion is black—they mix. The channels pulsate, branch upward, move into the skull cavity, enter the three branches, pierce the right and left eyes, the middle brahma-aperture. The awareness thought-free body: vajra necklace, dot stack, five or nine arises. The nine dots: these are the nine doorways of awareness. They are not nine—they are one. The one is not one—it is the nature of awareness, beyond one and many. Your own face is the dot—the point of awareness that knows everything. The seven doors: the eye, the essence center straight, arises the door eye two, power object arises making, channel all appears. The eight examples: object-appearance holds like a hook, hook holds making, appears the nose holds, samsara nirvana nose holds. The nine measures: three element gathering distant-noose measure, object-appearance expands gathering, pristine-awareness measures the necklace sees, essence gathers form-appearance distinguishes. In a freezing cave... has traversed these teachings. The water lamp is your own awareness, clear and luminous. The lamps are not outside—they are within. The channels are the pathways of awareness. The dots are the moments of awareness. Recognize this, and the entire mandala reveals itself. The body becomes the palace, the channels become the deities, the lights become the wisdoms. Thus, practitioner, do not seek the lamps elsewhere. They are within you. The clarity you see in meditation is your own awareness. The lights that appear are the lights of wisdom. Recognize them as your own display, and the path completes itself. Now I will explain further the water lamp in practice. The water lamp is the clarity of awareness—it appears as light, as points, as colors. This clarity is not something you create—it arises naturally when the mind is still. When you rest in naked awareness, without grasping at thoughts or objects, the clarity shines forth. This is the water lamp. The practice is simple: rest in awareness. Let thoughts arise and dissolve naturally. Do not follow them, do not reject them. Let the mind be like space—open, vast, unobstructed. Within this space, clarity arises. The clarity is not different from space—they are aspects of the same awareness. The four lamps correspond to four aspects of practice. The water lamp is the clarity of awareness. The emptiness lamp is the openness of awareness. The space lamp is the expanse of awareness. The wisdom lamp is the knowing quality of awareness. These four are not separate—they arise together, shine together, dissolve together in the single sphere of rigpa. The channels within the body are the pathways of this clarity. The navel channel produces the burning lamp—the heat of awareness. The central channel is the pathway of the main winds. The right and left channels are the pathways of the subsidiary winds. When the winds enter the central channel, clarity arises. The channels are not mere tubes—they are the pathways of awareness. The ancient masters mapped these channels through direct observation. They discovered that awareness has structure—it flows through specific pathways, settles in specific centers, manifests in specific forms. This mapping is the ground of the inner yoga practices. The nine dots are the nine doorways of awareness. These are not physical—they are the points where awareness interacts with objects. The eye sees forms, the ear hears sounds, the nose smells odors, the tongue tastes flavors, the body feels touch, the mind knows phenomena. These are the six doors. The seventh is the door of mental events. The eighth is the door of aggregates. The ninth is the door of dharmata. But these nine are not nine—they are one. The one awareness that knows through all the doors. The one awareness that is aware of itself. The one awareness that is always present, always knowing, always clear. Your own face is this awareness—this is what the text means by &quot;the dot.&quot; The seven doors: the eye door, the ear door, the nose door, the tongue door, the body door, the mind door, and the door of mental events. These are the gateways through which awareness experiences. Each door has its object: form, sound, smell, taste, touch, phenomena. The awareness that knows through these doors is one—it is your own rigpa. The practice of Dzogchen is to rest in this awareness. Do not create anything, do not suppress anything. Let the mind rest in its natural state. The clarity will arise naturally. The lights will appear naturally. The recognition will happen naturally. This is the water lamp—already present, always present, never createA hilltop meditator...erer has sat in meditation and seen these lights. I have watched the points arise, the colors shine, the forms manifest. I have felt the heat of the burning lamp, the clarity of the water lamp, the expanse of the space lamp, the knowing of the wisdom lamp. These are not hallucinations—they are the natural display of awareness. What I tell you is from my own experience: rest in awareness. Let the lights arise. Do not grasp at them, do not reject them. They are appearances in awareness, empty of inherent existence. Rest in that awareness—the awareness that knows the lights. That awareness is your own nature. Recognize it, and the path is complete.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">First nature-is. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness. The Treasury&#x27;s presentation here is profound and complete. These teachings are not mere philosophy but direct Your shadow moves with you—don&#x27;t mistake it for your body. your own nature. The Great Perfection transcends all elaboration while using elaboration as skillful means. May all who encounter these words recognize their true nature. A hilltop meditator... has wandered through these teachings for decades. What I&#x27;ve learned: the teachings are not the point. Recognition is the point. Don&#x27;t collect teachings like treasures. Use them as keys to open the door of recognition, then throw them away. The door opens to what was never closed. These teachings are my heart-essence, given to those with fortune to receive them. The Dzogchen path is not for everyone, but for those who encounter it, liberation is certain. Practice with devotion. Recognize with confidence. Rest in natural perfection. ROAR! All teachings! All philosophies! All elaborations! CUT THROUGH THEM! Can you find the teaching? Can you grasp the philosophy? They are awareness displaying itself! See through the display and FIND WHAT DISPLAYS! AH AH AH! Three words. Teach. Recognize. Stop. The teaching points. The recognition sees. The stopping rests. Three words, one meaning. Complete from the beginning. Perfect at the end. Stop seeking. Rest in completion. Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation serves pedagogical clarity. Each section builds upon previous. Each concept refines understanding. Yet the system is not the truth—it The mind creates, the creation dissolves. What remains? truth. Precise structure for those who need structure. Complete framework for comprehensive understanding. The integration of all teachings: view integrates ground, meditation integrates path, conduct integrates expression, result integrates completion. All integrated into recognition. Nothing separate. Nothing apart. One awareness wearing many costumes. The essence beyond all teachings: awareness knowing itself. Not through teaching. Not through practice. Not through time. Awareness is self-knowing from the beginning. The teaching describes this. The practice reveals this. The result is this. Already complete. Emaho! The teachings! The path! The recognition! What joy to encounter these words! What bliss to practice these methods! What liberation to recognize this nature! This yogi dances through every word, every practice, every recognition—complete in each, free in all! Between the teaching and the recognition, between the practice and the result, the consort dances. Her embrace is the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two. Not one. Just this embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself. The presentation demonstrates precise philosophical and phenomenological analysis. Each term defined. Each concept placed. Each distinction clarified. Yet precision serves recognition, not取代 it. Precise A river flows to sea—the current is not the water&#x27;s nature. what transcends precision. I have traveled to every monastery, studied with every teacher, practiced every method. The conclusion: all teachings converge at recognition. The best teaching is the one that opens your recognition. The best teacher is the one who points clearly. Find yours. Practice. Recognize. The teachings arise spontaneously—not forced, not fabricated. When conditions ripen, recognition dawns. When recognition dawns, teaching completes. Natural. Effortless. Spontaneous. Like fruit falling when ripe. Like water finding its level. I dance through these teachings as light through prisms. Each teaching a different color. Each practice a different step. All dances of one dancer. Recognition is realizing you are the dancer and the dance. Liberation is dancing without inhibition. Philosophically, these teachings present the Great Perfection view: transcendence of all views, completion beyond all completion, perfection prior to all perfection. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. The middle way that transcends middle and extremes. The scholarly precision fascinates me—every citation, every reference, every logical connection. Yet within this precision lives wild freedom. The precision is the cage. Recognition is the bird flying free. Both are beautiful. Both serve. From the sky of dharmata I dance down into these teachings. Each word a step. Each concept a gesture. The sky remains unchanged. The dancer was never separate from the sky. Recognition is this realization. Every teaching in my library is a book—view book, meditation book, conduct book, result book. Thousands of volumes. One story: recognition. The library burns. The books turn to ash. The story continues in awareness. Modern thought approaches similar insights through different doors—phenomenology, quantum physics, cognitive science. Different vocabularies. Same recognition: reality is not what it appears. Investigation reveals wonder. Translating these teachings challenges every assumption. How to convey ancient wisdom in modern words? The solution: translate the experience, not just the words. Point to what the words point to. Trust the reader&#x27;s recognition. I reveal what was never hidden. The teaching is not in the text. It is reading these words. The recognition is not in the future. It is now. The liberation is not elsewhere. It is here. Everything is revealed. Everything is now. Thus concludes this section of the Treasury. The ground is established. The path is shown. The result is guaranteed. May all who read these words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. This is the prayer of LongchenWalking the high passes...abond&#x27;s absolute final teaching: Stop reading. Stop studying. Stop thinking. Recognize your own nature right now. This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the result. Complete. Perfect. The end. Final ultimate words. Teaching. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The Treasury is complete. You are complete. Recognition is complete. Rest. The absolute end of all teachings. FINAL ROAR! All teachings! All practices! All results! CUT THROUGH EVERYTHING! See what was never taught! Never practiced! Never achieved! LIBERATION IS YOUR OWN FACE! AH AH AH! The teachings form a vajra fortress—indestructible, protective, complete. Yet look closely! Is there a fortress? Or just awareness playing at being structured? Each teaching complete. Each recognition self-sufficient. The fortress is the illusion. The teachings are bliss! The practices are bliss! The recognition is bliss! Not pleasure-bliss but freedom-bliss! The bliss of seeing through! The bliss of being through! Complete bliss! The heruka dances through all teachings! View dance! Meditation dance! Conduct dance! Result dance! All one dance! All one deity! Dance with me through every word into recognition! HA HA HA! The final ultimate essence: there is no teaching. There is no practice. There is no result. Only awareness recognizing itself. This is the essence. This is the teaching. This is complete liberation.</div>

These teachings are not mere philosophy but direct Last night&#x27;s dream seemed real—appearance is not reality. your own nature. The Great Perfection transcends all elaboration while using elaboration as skillful means. May all who encounter these words recognize their true nature. This mountain dweller... has wandered through these teachings for decades. What I&#x27;ve learned: the teachings are not the point. Recognition is the point. Don&#x27;t collect teachings like treasures. Use them as keys to open the door of recognition, then throw them away. The door opens to what was never closed. These teachings are my heart-essence, given to those with fortune to receive them. The Dzogchen path is not for everyone, but for those who encounter it, liberation is certain. Practice with devotion. Recognize with confidence. Rest in natural perfection. ROAR! All teachings! All philosophies! All elaborations! CUT THROUGH THEM! Can you find the teaching? Can you grasp the philosophy? They are awareness displaying itself! See through the display and FIND WHAT DISPLAYS! AH AH AH! Stop. Recognize. Continue. Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation serves pedagogical clarity. Each section builds upon previous. Each concept refines understanding. Yet the system is not the truth—it Wind horses printed on cloth—the image rides the breeze, but the breeze is not the horse. truth. Precise structure for those who need structure. Complete framework for comprehensive understanding. The integration of all teachings: view integrates ground, meditation integrates path, conduct integrates expression, result integrates completion. All integrated into recognition. Nothing separate. Nothing apart. One awareness wearing many costumes. The essence beyond all teachings: awareness knowing itself. Not through teaching. Not through practice. Not through time. Awareness is self-knowing from the beginning. The teaching describes this. The practice reveals this. The result is this. Already complete. Emaho! The teachings! The path! The recognition! What joy to encounter these words! What bliss to practice these methods! What liberation to recognize this nature! This yogi dances through every word, every practice, every recognition—complete in each, free in all! Between the teaching and the recognition, between the practice and the result, the consort dances. Her embrace is the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two. Not one. Just this embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself. The presentation demonstrates precise philosophical and phenomenological analysis. Each term defined. Each concept placed. Each distinction clarified. Yet precision serves recognition, not取代 it. Precise A butter lamp illuminates—don&#x27;t worship the vessel, see by its brightness. what transcends precision. I have traveled to every monastery, studied with every teacher, practiced every method. The conclusion: all teachings converge at recognition. The best teaching is the one that opens your recognition. The best teacher is the one who points clearly. Find yours. Practice. Recognize. The teachings arise spontaneously—not forced, not fabricated. When conditions ripen, recognition dawns. When recognition dawns, teaching completes. Natural. Effortless. Spontaneous. Like fruit falling when ripe. Like water finding its level. I dance through these teachings as light through prisms. Each teaching a different color. Each practice a different step. All dances of one dancer. Recognition is realizing you are the dancer and the dance. Liberation is dancing without inhibition. Philosophically, these teachings present the Great Perfection view: transcendence of all views, completion beyond all completion, perfection prior to all perfection. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. The middle way that transcends middle and extremes. The scholarly precision fascinates me—every citation, every reference, every logical connection. Yet within this precision lives wild freedom. The precision is the cage. Recognition is the bird flying free. Both are beautiful. Both serve. From the sky of dharmata I dance down into these teachings. Each word a step. Each concept a gesture. The sky remains unchanged. The dancer was never separate from the sky. Recognition is this realization. Every teaching in my library is a book—view book, meditation book, conduct book, result book. Thousands of volumes. One story: recognition. The library burns. The books turn to ash. The story continues in awareness. Modern thought approaches similar insights through different doors—phenomenology, quantum physics, cognitive science. Different vocabularies. Same recognition: reality is not what it appears. Investigation reveals wonder. Translating these teachings challenges every assumption. How to convey ancient wisdom in modern words? The solution: translate the experience, not just the words. Point to what the words point to. Trust the reader&#x27;s recognition. I reveal what was never hidden. The teaching is not in the text. It is reading these words. The recognition is not in the future. It is now. The liberation is not elsewhere. It is here. Everything is revealed. Everything is now. Thus concludes this section of the Treasury. The ground is established. The path is shown. The result is guaranteed. May all who read these words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. This is the prayer of LongchA simple practitioner...agabond&#x27;s absolute final teaching: Stop reading. Stop studying. Stop thinking. Recognize your own nature right now. This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the result. Complete. Perfect. The end. Final ultimate words. Teaching. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The Treasury is complete. You are complete. Recognition is complete. Rest. The absolute end of all teachings. FINAL ROAR! All teachings! All practices! All results! CUT THROUGH EVERYTHING! See what was never taught! Never practiced! Never achieved! LIBERATION IS YOUR OWN FACE! AH AH AH! The teachings form a vajra fortress—indestructible, protective, complete. Yet look closely! Is there a fortress? Or just awareness playing at being structured? Each teaching complete. Each recognition self-sufficient. The fortress is the illusion. The teachings are bliss! The practices are bliss! The recognition is bliss! Not pleasure-bliss but freedom-bliss! The bliss of seeing through! The bliss of being through! Complete bliss! The heruka dances through all teachings! View dance! Meditation dance! Conduct dance! Result dance! All one dance! All one deity! Dance with me through every word into recognition! HA HA HA! The final ultimate essence: there is no teaching. There is no practice. There is no result. Only awareness recognizing itself. This is the essence. This is the teaching. This is complete liberation.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis establishes the fundamental distinction between the ground of mind and the ground of wisdom. The Kunzang Klongdrukpa TantraO great bodhisattva, the abode of mind is the all-ground, because the all-ground gathers all objects of thought and is known as mind. The abode of primordial wisdom is the Dharmakaya, because the Dharmakaya does not possess memory-thought and has no consciousness that grasps objects as different. This is the essential distinction that separates samsara from nirvana, like the difference between a high plateau lake&#x27;s surface and its depths.</div>

An old practitioner walking a pilgrimage path once insisted that the path itself was the destination. &quot;I walk, therefore I have arrived,&quot; he proclaimed. Foolish confusion!

  <div class="commentary-content">Between samsara and nirvana, the vast middle way opens. The all-ground is the basis for connection to both. The original-meaning is the first ground of samsara&#x27;s dharmas. The connection-meaning is spoken from the aspect of reversing ignorance co-existing with first movement awareness. The body-habit all-ground speaks from the aspect where flesh, blood, light, and mind-body appear. The various-habit all-ground speaks from being the source of impure karma and habits. Like prayer flags of different colors—all made of cloth, all receiving wind, all releasing prayers, yet distinct in their blessings. [17497-1751A cave hermit...ner spent years trying to purify the all-ground, like polishing a brick to make a mirror. Foolish! The all-ground cannot become Dharmakaya—they are distinct from the first. The all-ground is the sleep; Dharmakaya is the waking. One must abandon the sleep, not transform it into waking. [17515-End] Lion-faced dakini&#x27;s fierce compassion: why debate the distinction endlessly? The all-ground and Dharmakaya are different—accept this and move on! Recognition of Dharmakaya is not analysis of all-ground. Wake up now! Singing yogi&#x27;s gentle wisdom: while you walk the circumambulation path, while you turn the prayer wheel, distinguish the path from the goal.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Nirmanakaya object is delusion-appearance. Thogal <span class="term">(thod rgal)</span> is translated as &#x27;leap-over&#x27; or &#x27;direct transcendence,&#x27; but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness&#x27;s own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.</div>

What is called self-liberation <span class="term">(rang grol)</span> is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains.

  <div class="commentary-content">The divisions of Dharmakaya into three, then nine, then countless—are pedagogical devices, not ultimate truths. Like a teacher using many examples to explain one point. Don&#x27;t confuse the examples with the point. Samaya <span class="term">(dam tshig)</span> is usually translated as &#x27;commitment&#x27; or &#x27;vow,&#x27; suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.</div>

The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation. First, nature: object-subject grasping grasping-born awareness, non-recognition pervader exists. Definition: grasping grasping-born, object-subject thinking, thus called mind. Don&#x27;t philosophize about mind and wisdom—recognize them! The philosopher who analyzes mind for years without recognition is like a man who studies the recipe but never tastes the food.

Stop generating them through recognition. This old hermit&#x27;s final teaching: I&#x27;ve studied these texts for sixty years. I can recite all eighty-four thousand afflictions. I can explain the twenty-five subdivisions. But what liberated me? Not the knowledge. Not the scholarship. One moment of recognizing my own face. That moment contained all the teachings. All the classifications are just different ways of saying: wake up! [18161-End] COMPLETE SYNTHESIS: The distinction between mind <span class="term">(sems)</span> and wisdom <span class="term">(ye shes)</span> is the central axis of dzogchen. Mind gathers, classifies, analyzes, wanders. Wisdom recognizes, rests, clarifies, liberates. The all-ground <span class="term">(kun gzhi)</span> is not the enemy—it&#x27;s the field where the game plays out. The enemy is non-recognition <span class="term">(ma rig pa)</span>, the failure to recognize what knows the all-ground. Once recognized, the all-ground becomes the display of Dharmakaya. The eleven mind types, six root afflictions, sixteen proximate, twenty-five subtle—all are different costumes worn by non-recognition. Don&#x27;t fight each costume. Unmask the wearer. Practice is simple: recognize awareness in every moment. When mind wanders, recognize the wandering. When afflictions arise, recognize their empty nature. When wisdom dawns, don&#x27;t grasp it. This is the heart of Longchenpa&#x27;s teaching. This is the treasury&#x27;s essence. Enough analysis. Enough classification. Sit down. Recognize your nature. Rest there. Everything else is distraction. The mani wall stands, stones placed by countless hands, each carving representing countless hours of practice. But the wall is just stones. The practice is just recognition. Don&#x27;t mistake the accumulation for the attainment. Look. See. Rest. Complete. The distinction between mind and wisdom plays out in every moment of practice. When you sit in meditation, notice: the moment you try to &quot;meditate,&quot; that&#x27;s mind. The moment you rest without trying, that&#x27;s wisdom. The moment you judge your meditation as good or bad, that&#x27;s mind. The moment you simply notice without judgment, that&#x27;s wisdom. Throughout your day, pause twenty times. In each pause, ask: &quot;What is knowing this moment?&quot; Don&#x27;t answer with words. Look directly. That looking is wisdom. The one who asks is mind. The knowing itself is wisdom. Mountain hermit&#x27;s cave practice: I spent three years just watching the distinction between mind and wisdom. Every thought that arose, I asked: &quot;Is this mind or wisdom?&quot; Eventually, I stopped asking. The distinction dissolved. There was only knowing. That is the true synthesis. Longchenpa wrote thousands of verses on mind and wisdom. The Prajnaparamita sutras fill libraries. The tantras are countless. But the essence is contained in one moment of recognition. All the classification serves one purpose—to exhaust the mind&#x27;s tendency to analyze, to classify, to understand. When the mind exhausts itself, wisdom remains. This is not nihilism. Wisdom is not nothing. Wisdom is luminous clarity, empty yet knowing. It is not inanimate like a stone. It is not dark like ignorance. It is the bright awareness that reads these words right now. Final metaphor: The mind is like a wave on the ocean. It rises, falls, crashes, subsides. Wisdom is like the water itself—never moving from its water-nature, never becoming anything other than water, even when it appears as wave. The wave doesn&#x27;t need to become water. It is water already. Mind doesn&#x27;t need to become wisdom. It is wisdom&#x27;s display already. Recognize this, and the eleven mind types are liberated. The six root afflictions are purified. The eighty-four thousand are dissolved. Not by effort. Not by time. By recognition alone. This is the supreme vehicle. This is the great perfection. This is the treasury of dharmadhatu. Om ah hum. The commentary on mind and wisdom is complete. The distinctions are drawn. The synthesis is made. What remains? Your recognition. Your practice. Your liberation. May all beings recognize their true nature. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate the path. May wisdom dawn in all directions. The teachings on mind and wisdom are not merely for meditation sessions. They apply to every moment. When anger arises in traffic, recognize: this anger is mind. What knows the anger? Wisdom. When desire arises for food, recognition: desire is mind. What knows the desire? Wisdom. When pride arises in accomplishment, see: pride is mind. What knows the pride? Wisdom. This continuous recognition transforms ordinary life into the path. Every affliction becomes an opportunity for recognition. Every distraction becomes a reminder of the nondual nature. The distinction between meditation and post-meditation dissolves. Don&#x27;t wait for special circumstances. Don&#x27;t wait for retreat.

  <div class="commentary-content">What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. The bhumis <span class="term">(sa)</span> are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving. The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.</div>

The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind&#x27;s display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns. See the ground. Walking dissolves.</div>

What is called self-liberation <span class="term">(rang grol)</span> is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">This very moment— Thus established. Samaya <span class="term">(dam tshig)</span> is usually translated as &#x27;commitment&#x27; or &#x27;vow,&#x27; suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it. Thus. The analysis dissolves the analyzer. Categories collapse into recognition. Secret completion: the treasury is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight was never obscured. The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained. The Treasury&#x27;s presentation here is profound and complete. These teachings are not mere philosophy but direct The cup holds, the liquid warms, the steam rises. Each A seed contains a tree, but the shell is not the forest. comfort. your own nature. The Great Perfection transcends all elaboration while using elaboration as skillful means. May all who encounter these words recognize their true nature. This old vagabond has wandered through these teachings for decades. What I&#x27;ve learned: the teachings are not the point. Recognition is the point. Don&#x27;t collect teachings like treasures. Use them as keys to open the door of recognition, then throw them away. The door opens to what was never closed. These teachings are my heart-essence, given to those with fortune to receive them. The Dzogchen path is not for everyone, but for those who encounter it, liberation is certain. Practice with devotion. Recognize with confidence. Rest in natural perfection. ROAR! All teachings! All philosophies! All elaborations! CUT THROUGH THEM! Can you find the teaching? Can you grasp the philosophy? They are awareness displaying itself! See through the display and FIND WHAT DISPLAYS! AH AH AH! Teach. Recognize. Let be. The teaching points but cannot capture. Recognition sees but has no seer. Letting be rests without resting. Already complete. Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation serves pedagogical clarity. Each section builds upon previous. Each concept refines understanding. Yet the system is not the truth—it A river flows to sea—the current is not the water&#x27;s nature. truth. Precise structure for those who need structure. Complete framework for comprehensive understanding. The integration of all teachings: view integrates ground, meditation integrates path, conduct integrates expression, result integrates completion. All integrated into recognition. Nothing separate. Nothing apart. One awareness wearing many costumes. The essence beyond all teachings: awareness knowing itself. Not through teaching. Not through practice. Not through time. Awareness is self-knowing from the beginning. The teaching describes this. The practice reveals this. The result is this. Already complete. Emaho! The teachings! The path! The recognition! What joy to encounter these words! What bliss to practice these methods! What liberation to recognize this nature! This yogi dances through every word, every practice, every recognition—complete in each, free in all! Between the teaching and the recognition, between the practice and the result, the consort dances. Her embrace is the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two. Not one. Just this embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself. The presentation demonstrates precise philosophical and phenomenological analysis. Each term defined. Each concept placed. Each distinction clarified. Yet precision serves recognition, not取代 it. Precise Last night&#x27;s dream seemed real—appearance is not reality. what transcends precision. I have traveled to every monastery, studied with every teacher, practiced every method. The conclusion: all teachings converge at recognition. The best teaching is the one that opens your recognition. The best teacher is the one who points clearly. Find yours. Practice. Recognize. The teachings arise spontaneously—not forced, not fabricated. When conditions ripen, recognition dawns. When recognition dawns, teaching completes. Natural. Effortless. Spontaneous. Like fruit falling when ripe. Like water finding its level. I dance through these teachings as light through prisms. Each teaching a different color. Each practice a different step. All dances of one dancer. Recognition is realizing you are the dancer and the dance. Liberation is dancing without inhibition. Philosophically, these teachings present the Great Perfection view: transcendence of all views, completion beyond all completion, perfection prior to all perfection. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. The middle way that transcends middle and extremes. The scholarly precision fascinates me—every citation, every reference, every logical connection. Yet within this precision lives wild freedom. The precision is the cage. Recognition is the bird flying free. Both are beautiful. Both serve. From the sky of dharmata I dance down into these teachings. Each word a step. Each concept a gesture. The sky remains unchanged. The dancer was never separate from the sky. Recognition is this realization. Every teaching in my library is a book—view book, meditation book, conduct book, result book. Thousands of volumes. One story: recognition. The library burns. The books turn to ash. The story continues in awareness. Modern thought approaches similar insights through different doors—phenomenology, quantum physics, cognitive science. Different vocabularies. Same recognition: reality is not what it appears. Investigation reveals wonder. Translating these teachings challenges every assumption. How to convey ancient wisdom in modern words? The solution: translate the experience, not just the words. Point to what the words point to. Trust the reader&#x27;s recognition. I reveal what was never hidden. The teaching is not in the text. It is reading these words. The recognition is not in the future. It is now. The liberation is not elsewhere. It is here. Everything is revealed. Everything is now. Thus concludes this section of the Treasury. The ground is established. The path is shown. The result is guaranteed. May all who read these words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. This is the prayer of Longchenpa. Enough wandering through words. Close the book. Open your eyes. What you sought was never hidden—just overlooked in the searching. Recognition doesn&#x27;t arrive; it simply stops departing. This is the heart of Longchenpa&#x27;s seventh treasury. AH! What effort to describe what cannot be caught in description! Cut through even these words—find what reads them. Liberation wears no robes, carries no credentials, needs no validation. Your own face, shining since before time. The dance continues—view, meditation, conduct, result—movements of one dancer who was never separate from the dance. The fortress dissolves. The bliss remains—not found, not lost, just naturally abiding. Everything complete. Everything already so.</div>

This is not lighting candles in a shrine—this is the natural luminosity that has illuminated every moment of your life, unnoticed. The first characteristic: wisdom&#x27;s self-appearance showing clear light, mother and child meeting. What does this mean? The mother is the ground luminosity, ever- present. The child is the path luminosity, recognized in practice. When they meet, there is no separation between ground and path—only continuous recognition.</div>

They become collectors of spiritual experiences. This is worse than blindness—it is attachment to samsara wearing luminous clothing. Cut through! The vision is not the point.

One dawn, exhausted, he opened them—and saw ordinary light illuminating the room. The lamp had always been burning. He had been looking for something extraordinary while surrounded by the ordinary miracle. The far-reaching lasso—what a name! It gathers the pure essence of the four elements, pervading all experience like a lasso that catches not cattle but the energy of appearance itself.

The view of meaning is the view of vidya in its own immediacy. Seven views. Seven ways of seeing. But not seven different things. One recognition, seven expressions.

A voiceYou have heard the common vehicles—Sarvastivada, Sautrantika, Yogacara. Each proposes a path. Each promises liberation. But listen: these paths are like ladders to climb a mountain that was always under your feet. The ladder is not Mount Kailash. The path is not the goal. The tradition points: Three words. Rigpa. Self-appearing. Path. See what is. The rigpa is your own awareness, knowing itself. It appears to itself as phenomena—this is self-appearing. The path is not somewhere to go—it is the recognizing itself. No elaboration, no construction, no effort. This is the great secret show, not hidden but overlooked. A clarifying voice explains: The phrase elaboration-free meaning refers to the nature that is beyond conceptual construction. All elaborations—good, bad, neutral—are fabrications of mind. Rigpa is the awareness that knows this without trying to change it. Self-appearing means the nature displays itself as everything—forms, sounds, sensations—without ever leaving its own nature.</div>

When you look for the boundary, you find none. Bindu and expanse, awareness and space—these are not two substances meeting but one nature expressing in two aspects. The definition: bindu not-change, vast expanse, greatly pervading all. Consider this: throughout all the changes of your life—childhood, youth, age, health, sickness, gain, loss—has that which knows these changes itself changed? The bindu is this unchanging essence, the point of pure presence that never transforms. The division into three—body-dwelling channel bindu, nature path bindu, complete result bindu—maps the journey from obscuration to recognition. Body-dwelling: the essences circulating in channels, the white and red bindus gathered at crown and heart, the physical supports for recognition. Nature path: the bindu as it is recognized and activated through practice. Complete result: the bindu fully actualized as the three kayas. A practitioner in retreat once asked her teacher: &quot;What is this bindu you speak of? Is it something I can find in my body?&quot; The teacher replied: &quot;Close your eyes. Rest without thinking. Now, in that rest, is there something that knows the resting? That knowing is bindu. Is there a shape to it? A color? A location?&quot; The practitioner looked and looked. &quot;No,&quot; she said finally. &quot;There is only knowing.&quot; &quot;Exactly,&quot; said the teacher. &quot;Bindu is not a thing. It is the knowing quality itself. But when you seek it as an object, you miss it. When you rest as it, you find you have never been separate from it.&quot; She spent the next three months in meditation, not seeking anything, simply resting in that knowing quality. At the end, she said: &quot;I understand now. The bindu was never in my body. My body is in the bindu. All experience arises within this knowing, this thigle, this drop of pure presence.&quot; The fivefold presentation follows the traditional Buddhist analytical framework used to fully establish a topic: essence <span class="term">(ngo bo)</span>, definition <span class="term">(mtshan nyid)</span>, division <span class="term">(dbye ba)</span>, characteristic <span class="term">(mtshan ma)</span>, and result <span class="term">(&#x27;bras bu)</span>. This structure ensures comprehensive understanding from the ontological ground to the practical fruit. The essence of bindu is nonduality—it is not separate from the expanse <span class="term">(dbyings)</span> of emptiness, just as a drop of water is not separate from the ocean. Yet it dwells as one—singular, unique to each individual&#x27;s continuum—without duality between itself and what it knows. This challenges our ordinary assumption of a knowing subject separate from known objects. In direct experience, can you find a boundary between awareness and its content? The closer you look, the more the boundary dissolves. This is not philosophical idealism but phenomenological fact. The definition emphasizes three qualities: unchanging <span class="term">(ma gyur)</span>, vast expanse <span class="term">(klong yangs)</span>, and all-pervading <span class="term">(kun la khyab)</span>. Unlike conditioned phenomena that arise and cease, the bindu is the unchanging ground of knowing. Its vastness means it is not confined to a particular location or time. Its pervasion means all experience occurs within it, like dreams occurring within sleep. The three divisions correspond to the classic Buddhist triad of base <span class="term">(gzhi)</span>, path <span class="term">(lam)</span>, and result <span class="term">(&#x27;bras bu)</span>—the bindu as it exists naturally, as it is activated through practice, and as it is fully realized. In practice, work with the body-dwelling bindus through subtle body practices. Visualize the white bindu <span class="term">(hang)</span> at the crown chakra, radiant like a moon, representing the masculine principle, skillful means, and the capacity for emptiness. Visualize the red bindu <span class="term">(ah)</span> at the heart center, glowing like a sun, representing the feminine principle, wisdom, and the capacity for appearance. As you breathe, imagine these essences becoming more radiant, dissolving obstructions, preparing the physical and energetic basis for recognition. But don&#x27;t become attached to these visualizations as ultimate reality. They are supports, fingers pointing. The actual bindu is the pure knowing that perceives these visualizations. As practice deepens, the distinction between the visualizer, the visualization, and the bindu itself dissolves. This is the nature path bindu awakening.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Of the body-dwelling, two categories: conventional cause bindu <span class="term">(white and red)</span> and ultimate wisdom bindu <span class="term">(five)</span>. The white and red—the father&#x27;s white essence and mother&#x27;s red essence—converge at the heart. But do not materialize this. These are symbolic of the union of skillful means and wisdom, of emptiness and appearance. The five wisdom bindus correspond to the five buddha families, the five wisdoms, the five pure lights. The Thalgyur teaches: &quot;Body place is this: in crown and heart channel, unfabricated pure reality dwells. Thus it is spoken.&quot; The crown is the seat of the white bindu, the father&#x27;s lineage, the capacity for emptiness. The heart is the seat of the red bindu, the mother&#x27;s lineage, the capacity for appearance. When these are recognized, the unfabricated pure reality—your own nature—reveals itself. You need not create this; you need only cease obscuring it. The conventional <span class="term">(kun rdzob)</span> and ultimate <span class="term">(don dam)</span> bindus represent the two truths as applied to subtle physiology. The conventional bindus—the white bodhicitta <span class="term">(byang sems dkar po)</span> and red bodhicitta <span class="term">(byang sems dmar po)</span>—are the physical supports that can be worked with through yogic practices like tummo <span class="term">(gtum mo, inner heat)</span>. They are conventional because they are relative, conditioned phenomena that can be increased, decreased, moved, and transformed. The ultimate bindus are the five wisdoms <span class="term">(ye shes lnga)</span>—mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, and dharmadhatu wisdoms—existing primordially beyond increase or decrease. The symbolism of father <span class="term">(white)</span> and mother <span class="term">(red)</span> is pervasive in Vajrayana, representing the nondual union of means and wisdom, method and insight, skillful activity and profound understanding. But this is not merely symbolic; in subtle body practice, the essences do converge at the heart center, and their union gives rise to the experience of bliss-emptiness <span class="term">(bde stong)</span>. The five wisdom bindus correspond to the purification of the five skandhas, the five afflictions, and the realization of the five buddha families. The Thalgyur&#x27;s verse emphasizes that these are not manufactured through practice but discovered—&quot;unfabricated pure reality&quot; <span class="term">(ma bcos dag pa&#x27;i chos nyid)</span> dwells naturally in the crown and heart channels. Practice doesn&#x27;t create this; it reveals what has always been present, obscured only by conceptual mind. To work with this practically: in your daily meditation, begin by settling the mind. Then, gently bring attention to the crown of the head. Without straining, sense the presence there—the white bindu as a feeling of clarity, openness, space. Then bring attention to the heart center. Sense the red bindu as warmth, presence, vitality. Imagine or feel these two meeting in the heart, their union giving rise to a profound sense of well-being that is not dependent on external circumstances. This is the ground of tummo practice and the foundation for dream yoga and clear light practices. But ultimately, recognize that even these subtle experiences are the play of bindu, not bindu itself. The actual bindu is the knowing of these experiences, the awareness in which they arise and dissolve. Rest in that knowing.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Path bindu: good, moved by wisdom wind from within channel. The channels are not merely physical nadis; they are the pathways of subtle energy, the infrastructure through which recognition manifests. The wisdom wind—prana activated by recognition—moves the bindu. Good bindu makes four lamps arise as object. The four lamps are the lamp of the abiding ground, the lamp of the empty bindu, the lamp of the far-reaching water, the lamp of the self-originating wisdom. These are not external lights but modalities of recognition, ways that rigpa illuminates itself. Good peak moves various wisdom analysis within channel. As recognition deepens, discriminating awareness operates spontaneously, not through conceptual thought but through direct knowing. Good bindu possessing ornament, depending on four lamps, shows appearance of increasing experience. The ornament is the play of manifestation—the rich display of phenomena as the expression of wisdom. Nature path bindu is sixfold: reality bindu without fabrication, pervading all; Samantabhadra bindu appearing without good or bad; expanse bindu clear without outer or inner; pure expanse bindu arising without deviation; wisdom bindu dwelling without primordial making; great wisdom bindu appearing directly, unobscured. These six are not separate bindus but six ways of recognizing the single essence. In the remote valleys of Dolpo, there lived a yogini who had mastered the practice of the four lamps. She described her experience: &quot;At first, meditation was like sitting in a dark room. I knew the room was there, but I couldn&#x27;t see. Then, gradually, a soft light appeared—the lamp of the abiding ground <span class="term">(gzhi sgron)</span>. It was like the first light of dawn, not bright but unmistakable. As I continued, the bindu itself began to glow—the empty bindu lamp <span class="term">(thigle stong pa&#x27;i sgron me)</span>—like a luminous sphere in the center of vision. Then the far-reaching water lamp <span class="term">(rgyang zhags chu&#x27;i sgron me)</span> opened, and I could see the nature of thoughts as clearly as objects in a mirror. Finally, the self-originating wisdom lamp <span class="term">(shes rab rang byung gi sgron me)</span> blazed, and there was no distinction between meditation and post-meditation, between practice and ordinary life. All of it was luminosity.&quot; She emphasized that these were not visual hallucinations but shifts in the fundamental mode of perception. &quot;It&#x27;s not that you see different things. You see the same things differently—transparently, as the play of awareness.&quot; The path bindu <span class="term">(lam gyi thigle)</span> describes the transformation that occurs as the bindu is activated through practice. The term &quot;good&quot; <span class="term">(dge ba)</span> indicates virtuous or auspicious bindus—those awakened through recognition as opposed to those obscured by ignorance. The wisdom wind <span class="term">(ye shes kyi rlung)</span> is prana <span class="term">(vital energy)</span> infused with awareness. In ordinary beings, prana moves through the side channels <span class="term">(roma and rkyang ma)</span>, fueling dualistic perception and afflictive emotions. Through yogic practice, this prana is drawn into the central channel <span class="term">(dbus ma)</span>, where it activates the bindu and gives rise to realization. The four lamps <span class="term">(sgron ma bzhi)</span> are experiential modalities described in detail in the Seventeen Tantras. The lamp of the abiding ground is the fundamental luminosity of awareness itself. The lamp of the empty bindu is the bindu as it appears in vision—spherical, luminous, self-arising. The far-reaching water lamp enables the practitioner to &quot;see&quot; the nature of reality at a distance, penetrating obscurations. The self-originating wisdom lamp is the culmination—rigpa knowing itself directly without object or subject. The six nature path bindus elaborate the qualities of the bindu as realized: unfabricated <span class="term">(uncreated by causes and conditions)</span>, pervasive <span class="term">(not limited by space or time)</span>, without good or bad <span class="term">(beyond moral dualism)</span>, without inner or outer <span class="term">(nondual)</span>, without deviation <span class="term">(not falling into extremes)</span>, and naturally present <span class="term">(not made by effort)</span>. The practical application involves working with the subtle body through practices like vase breathing <span class="term">(bum pa can)</span>, kumbhaka <span class="term">(holding the breath)</span>, and various pranayamas that move the winds and bindus. These are advanced practices that should be learned from a qualified teacher. However, the essence can be approached more simply: in meditation, as recognition stabilizes, you may naturally experience phenomena becoming more vivid, more luminous, more transparent. This is the play of the bindu. Don&#x27;t grasp at these experiences as signs of attainment, and don&#x27;t reject them as distractions. Simply recognize them as the natural expression of awareness. The four lamps may manifest in various ways—as visual phenomena in dark retreat, as enhanced clarity in daily perception, as the ability to &quot;see&quot; the energetic dimension of beings and environments. Whatever arises, maintain the view that it is the display of rigpa. This is the path of self-liberation <span class="term">(rang grol)</span>—not purifying phenomena but recognizing their true nature.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">Complete result bindu: Dharmakāya bindu single, free of elaboration, beyond identification, primordially pure essence, variously appearing as ways of arising, without any establishing cause. This is the fruition—not something newly achieved, but the bindu recognized as having always been complete. It is single because duality has dissolved. Free of elaboration because conceptual constructs have collapsed. Beyond identification because it cannot be fixed as &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that.&quot; The bindu characteristic: free of various pain, round without elaboration, showing awareness appearance, great transparent wisdom, gathering five rims into one as kāya place, essence beyond identification because emptiness does not establish as thing. Consider your own experience: when recognition is stable, suffering loses its grip. Not because circumstances change, but because the one who suffered—the grasping self—is seen through. The roundness is completeness, the absence of edges or limits. Great transparent wisdom—transparent because nothing is hidden, nothing blocked. A great master of the Nyingma tradition lay dying. His disciples gathered around, weeping. &quot;Don&#x27;t weep,&quot; he said, his voice still strong. &quot;I am not going anywhere. The bindu that has been my companion throughout this life—through childhood, through study, through practice, through teaching—is not dissolving. It is simply recognizing itself more fully.&quot; He paused, then laughed. &quot;Actually, &#x27;it&#x27; is not quite right. &#x27;It&#x27; implies something separate from what knows it. There is just this—luminous, empty, aware.&quot; He closed his eyes and sat in meditation posture. Hours passed. Then, witnesses reported, a rainbow appeared above the house, and his body began to shrink. By the time they checked again, only hair and nails remained—the sign of the rainbow body <span class="term">(&#x27;ja&#x27; lus)</span>. The complete result bindu had fully manifested. He had not achieved something new; he had simply allowed what always was to be fully recognized, fully expressed. The result bindu <span class="term">(&#x27;bras bu&#x27;i thigle)</span> describes the final state of realization, but Dzogchen is unique in asserting that ground <span class="term">(gzhi)</span>, path <span class="term">(lam)</span>, and result <span class="term">(&#x27;bras bu)</span> are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of a single reality. The Dharmakāya <span class="term">(chos sku)</span> is the truth body, the emptiness aspect of buddhahood. Here it is described as single <span class="term">(gcig)</span>—nondual, undivided, the collapse of all subject-object duality. Free of elaboration <span class="term">(spros bral)</span> means free from the eight extremes of conceptual proliferation <span class="term">(existence, non-existence, both, neither, permanence, cessation, coming, going)</span>. Beyond identification <span class="term">(ngos &#x27;dzin med)</span> indicates it cannot be grasped as an object or fixed as a reference point. Primordially pure <span class="term">(ka dag)</span> is the quintessential Dzogchen concept—purity not achieved through purification but intrinsic from the beginning. The bindu&#x27;s characteristic is described through five qualities: freedom from pain <span class="term">(myang &#x27;das)</span>, indicating transcendence of suffering; roundness without elaboration <span class="term">(zlum por spros bral)</span>, completeness without conceptual constructs; showing awareness appearance <span class="term">(rig pa snang ba ston)</span>, manifesting as the display of knowing; great transparent wisdom <span class="term">(shes rab chen po gsal ba)</span>, clear omniscience; gathering five rims <span class="term">(nga skor)</span> into one kāya place <span class="term">(sku&#x27;i gnas)</span>, integrating all elements into a single mandala of body. These describe the bindu not as a philosophical abstraction but as the living experience of full awakening—pain-free because the cause of pain <span class="term">(grasping)</span> has ended, round because complete, transparent because nothing obscures natural knowing. The contemplation of the result bindu is essential for motivation and orientation. Even though Dzogchen asserts the pathless path and the non-attainment of attainment, we must still practice. Why? Because although the result is primordially present, our recognition of it is not. Practice deepens recognition until it becomes uninterrupted, spontaneous, all-pervasive. To contemplate: visualize yourself as the deity, sitting in the dharmakāya posture, the bindu fully awakened at your heart. Radiate light in all directions, purifying the suffering of all beings, dissolving all into light, and rest in the recognition that this is not imagination but the actual nature of reality. The visualization is a support; the recognition is the practice. Do this regularly—not to &quot;become&quot; enlightened but to familiarize yourself with what you already are. This is the Dzogchen approach: not striving to reach a goal but allowing the goal <span class="term">(which is already reached)</span> to manifest fully.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">The Thalgyur continues its song: &quot;From that, increase of appearance arises, virtue arising directionless, characteristics unstained by any defect, capacity unceasingly appearing as various play, essence self-pure because characteristics are without duality, nature self-liberated because reasoning arises directionless.&quot; This is describing the maturation of recognition. Appearance increases—not diminishes, not escapes into void. But the appearance is virtue, benefit, arising without the directional bias of self-interest. From the Blazing Relics: &quot;Who becomes expanse bindu, this fortunate one sees singly.&quot; Singly—non-dually, directly, without the mediation of subject and object. &quot;Empty bindu lamp, self-arising without effort—all these are own experience signs.&quot; The empty bindu lamp is the self-recognition of rigpa, arising without contrivance, without production. These signs are not external omens but the natural marks of your own experience when recognition is authentic. A contemporary teacher describes the maturation process: &quot;In the beginning, practice feels like work. You&#x27;re sitting there, trying to meditate, fighting thoughts, struggling with posture, watching the clock. Then something shifts. Thoughts still arise, but they don&#x27;t disturb you. You&#x27;re not fighting anymore; you&#x27;re resting. This is the beginning of the increase of appearance—appearances become more vivid, more detailed, because you&#x27;re not filtering them through conceptual mind. Then comes a phase where everything seems magical, meaningful, connected. This is the virtue arising. Eventually, even that settles. There&#x27;s just this—ordinary, obvious, unremarkable. And yet completely different from ordinary confusion. The appearance is the same, but the knower has changed.&quot; He laughed. &quot;People ask, &#x27;How will I know when I&#x27;m enlightened?&#x27; You&#x27;ll know because you won&#x27;t care. The question won&#x27;t arise. Not because you&#x27;ve achieved something, but because you&#x27;ve stopped seeking. The seeking was the only obstacle.&quot; The Thalgyur passage describes the qualities of advanced realization. &quot;Increase of appearance&quot; <span class="term">(snang ba che)</span> seems paradoxical—don&#x27;t advanced practitioners perceive emptiness? Yes, but emptiness is not nothingness. It is the empty nature of appearance, which means appearance becomes more vivid, not less. When conceptual filters dissolve, perception becomes direct, intense, unmediated. &quot;Virtue arising directionless&quot; <span class="term">(dge ba phyogs med &#x27;char)</span> indicates spontaneous benefit that doesn&#x27;t aim at particular results. Ordinary virtue is directed—&quot;I will help this person&quot; or &quot;I will create this merit.&quot; Directionless virtue flows naturally, benefiting all without distinction, like the sun shining without choosing whom to warm. &quot;Characteristics unstained by any defect&quot; <span class="term">(mtshan nyid skyon gyis ma gos)</span> means phenomena are perceived as they are—pure, perfect, without the projection of impurity. The &quot;capacity&quot; <span class="term">(nus pa)</span> is the enlightened activity that manifests unceasingly as various forms of benefit—teaching, healing, inspiring, liberating. The Blazing Relics <span class="term">(sku gdung &#x27;bar ba)</span> is another of the Seventeen Tantras, and its verses describe the signs of realization. &quot;Seeing singly&quot; <span class="term">(gcig tu mthong)</span> is the nondual perception of the awakened one—not seeing two things <span class="term">(subject and object)</span> but the single display of dharmakāya. The &quot;empty bindu lamp&quot; is the self-recognition of rigpa, empty of inherent existence yet luminous in its knowing. These are not external validations but internal certainties—the recognition knows itself to be authentic. In practice, these verses point to the natural progression of recognition. Initially, one must make effort to recognize. Then recognition becomes easier, more stable. Eventually, it is simply the natural state, effortless and continuous. The signs mentioned—vivid appearance, spontaneous virtue, unstained perception—are not goals to achieve but byproducts of stable recognition. Don&#x27;t chase them. Simply rest in recognition, and they manifest naturally. If you chase them, you create new obscurations. The &quot;expanse bindu&quot; <span class="term">(klong gi thigle)</span> is awareness as space—vast, open, without center or boundary. When one becomes this, perception is transformed. There is no longer a &quot;you&quot; perceiving &quot;things.&quot; There is just perceiving, just knowing, just the play of awareness. This is the fruition of Dzogchen practice—not escape from the world but complete intimacy with it, not cessation of appearance but liberation into appearance, not achievement of a special state but recognition of the ordinary as extraordinary.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">&quot;Word elaborations cut, other mind not entering even for an instant, no occasion, speech-continuum exhausted from saying, thought to speak to others not possible in this person—how could sound words follow?&quot; This describes the state of one who has fully recognized: conceptual proliferation naturally pacified, the constructed self-world of language and reference naturally dissolved. Not through force, not through rejection, but through the exhaustion of ignorance. &quot;Thus in whom this appears, that one decides the single elaboration-free.&quot; Decides—certainty beyond doubt, the decisive certainty of direct knowledge. &quot;Thus possessing signs, even in two years from that, knowing awareness measure, dwelling without separation from expanse and awareness own-appearance—that also dissolves elements to self, without doubt this changes.&quot; The timeframe is not rigid; it indicates the natural progression. When recognition is stable, when expanse and awareness are never separate, then even the elements—the grossest level of manifestation—dissolve into their true nature. This is the great transference, the rainbow body, the final dissolution of all fixation. &quot;Thus it is spoken.&quot; The final verses describe the culmination of the path: the dissolution of the elements <span class="term">(&#x27;byung ba rang la zhi)</span>. In Tibetan medicine and cosmology, the body is composed of five elements—earth, water, fire, wind, space. In ordinary death, these dissolve sequentially, producing characteristic experiences. In the great transference <span class="term">(&#x27;pho ba chen po)</span>, the dissolution is conscious and complete. The physical body, composed of the elements, transforms into light, leaving only hair and nails <span class="term">(which don&#x27;t contain consciousness)</span>. This is the rainbow body <span class="term">(&#x27;ja&#x27; lus)</span>, the full manifestation of the complete result bindu. The &quot;two years&quot; mentioned is not a fixed timeline but indicates that once the signs of maturation are stable, the process is irreversible. The &quot;measure of awareness&quot; <span class="term">(rig pa&#x27;i tshad)</span> means recognizing rigpa so completely that there is no separation between the expanse <span class="term">(dbyings, emptiness)</span> and awareness <span class="term">(rig pa, knowing)</span>. They are seen as inseparable, not two aspects but one reality with two names. For most practitioners, these verses describe an aspiration and a direction rather than an immediate goal. But they also describe what is possible, what has been achieved by masters throughout history. The point is not to fantasize about rainbow bodies but to practice recognition in this very moment. Each moment of recognition is a microcosm of the great transference—thoughts dissolve, emotions dissolve, fixation dissolves, and there is just the luminosity of awareness. String these moments together, deepen them, stabilize them, and the result described here becomes inevitable. It is not something to achieve but something to allow—the natural fruition of the bindu recognizing itself, the expanse and awareness dancing as one, the play of primordial purity spontaneously perfect. Thus it is spoken. Thus it is. Thus it has always been.</div>

[Final] The signs of thodgal practice: five-colored light, kayas of five families rising and dissolving. Different combinations lead to different liberations: bardo, nirmanakaya, direct. The supreme bodhisattva remains in human form for countless aeons, helping beings. Signs are not liberation—but liberation has signs. Don&#x27;t be deceived by mere intellectual attainment. Complete signs—body, speech, mind—bring swift liberation. Two years to buddhahood with all signs complete. But don&#x27;t deceive yourself—clay painted gold is still clay. For genuine practitioners, signs arise inevitably. Two kinds of complete buddhahood: with signs and remains, or without aggregates. The path is not walked—it is realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Then after three months, others see you in five-colored light. Kayas of the five families rising into space and dissolving. This is the treasury&#x27;s heart. The five-colored light—five wisdoms, five Buddha families. The kayas arise and dissolve. Not ending—completion. Different combinations lead to different liberations: bardo, nirmanakaya, direct. Like streams flowing into ocean—all paths lead to buddhahood, manner varies. Supreme bodhisattva holds beings with compassion, remaining hundreds of thousands of years in single human body. The great play of spontaneous presence. Having signs is not liberation—but liberation always has signs. Don&#x27;t be deceived by ordinary attainments or gradual paths of shravakas—different grounds without great pure result. Complete body and speech signs: dwell in great sameness ground, manifest for others&#x27; benefit countless aeons in one body, perfecting enlightenment without intermediate births. Body and mind signs together bring swift self-liberation. Speech and mind signs bring rainbow body in ten years. All three complete bring buddhahood in two years. But mere intellectual view and meditation cannot liberate—remain long in samsara. Without distinguished outer and inner signs, mere signs uncertain. Don&#x27;t deceive yourself claiming Dzogchen view while lacking genuine confidence—clay painted gold is still clay. For thodgal practitioners who truly mature space and awareness, signs arise inevitably. One who claims confidence without signs is merely intellectualizing—wanders long in samsara. Two aspects: brief and extensive. Brief: even with direct dharmata realization, without sufficient effort may not reach measure. When material body separates, liberated from contaminants without further existence. Two complete buddhahoods: manifest with signs, light, material remains; and true complete without aggregates remainder through pure effort. Emaho! The five-colored light! The kayas dissolving! The signs of liberation! What is called delusion is wisdom&#x27;s play. The treasury is complete.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">From Pearl Garland, the essence of fruition: liberation itself is primordial. Not something achieved, not something attained—recognition returning to what was never left. This is the final secret, the ultimate pointing: ka-dag is not a state to reach but the nature of whatever appears. Exhaustion of confusion-ground does not mean destruction of something real—it means seeing through what never existed.</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">First has three: General presentation of attainment mode. Specifically explained as being result. Removing contradiction with explaining as path-appearance. First: From essence&#x27;s ground-appearance appearing as three kayas, shown as attained through power of purifying three gates&#x27; stains to be purified. From Thal &#x27;gyur: &quot;Furthermore, the result stages: Dharmakaya by mind&#x27;s activity, Sambhogakaya obtained through speech&#x27;s form, Nirmanakaya by body.&quot; Thus. These are cause-result of what is to be purified. As spontaneously accomplished by nature, knowing that attainment through causes and conditions is impossible—know this! See? The purification isn&#x27;t a manufacturing process—you&#x27;re not building a Buddha from parts. It&#x27;s removing obscurations from what&#x27;s already perfect. Like cleaning a mirror: the reflection is already there, you just remove the dust!</div>

  <div class="commentary-content">First, it is path-appearance—from the spontaneously accomplished womb of great primordial purity, like entering a house of ultimate result, then emerging from there, needing to appear externally from the primordially pure ground. The mode of appearance appears as abiding-essence-body. There are two path-appearances: those making oneself Buddha before the result, and having made oneself Buddha, the path of guiding trainees through manifest body accomplishing benefit. From this, here we hold the no-more-learning path-appearance as the three kayas being path-appearance AND being result—non-contradictory, connected meaning. Don&#x27;t you see? The path and result aren&#x27;t separate events in time—they&#x27;re different aspects of the same recognition. Like a mirror reflecting: the reflection is both the appearing <span class="term">(path)</span> and the complete image <span class="term">(result)</span> simultaneously!</div>

Mind: knowing how things are and how many, expansive. Qualities: all dharmas of powers and so forth, knowing perfectly complete. Enlightened activity: turning the Dharma wheel of five perfections, nature of outer, inner, secret three. From the Thalgyur: &quot;Nirmanakaya also: kaya, speech, mind, Qualities and enlightened activity, five aspects. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. Kaya marks and signs, Whatever trainees arise, body emanation. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. Speech word-connection good, Brahma&#x27;s expanse sixty branches.
