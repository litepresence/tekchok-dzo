---

## CAESURA STRATEGY APPLIED

### Pattern 1: Philosophical Arguments
**Locations:** Before logical connectors
- `, — for if` (introduces premise)
- `, — yet` (introduces contradiction)
- `, — therefore` (introduces conclusion)
- `, — consequently` (introduces result)

**Example:**
```
Before: "It does not exist as material, for if it did, it would be visible..."
After:  "It does not exist as material — for if it did, it would be visible..."
```

### Pattern 2: Tantra Citations
**Locations:** At major clause transitions
- Between semicolon-separated sections
- At thematic shifts in enumerations
- Preserved density while adding breath

**Example:**
```
Before: "Thus in dharmatā so abiding, delusion is nonexistent from the start; 
         in dharmakāya like space..."
After:  "Thus in dharmatā so abiding — delusion is nonexistent from the start; 
         in dharmakāya like space..."
```

### Pattern 3: Technical Descriptions
**Locations:** At natural boundaries
- Before explanatory clauses
- At source citations
- Between descriptive elements

### Pattern 4: Massive Lists (Edge Cases)
**Approach:** Minimal, strategic intervention
- Line 6784: 6 caesura marks in ~200-word list
- Placed at major thematic transitions only
- Preserved overwhelming enumeration nature
