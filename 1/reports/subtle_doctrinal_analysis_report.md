All three layers have been thoroughly analyzed for subtle doctrinal issues. The major 'basis' issue has been resolved. Remaining subtle issues have been investigated and verified.

---

## SUBTLE ISSUES INVESTIGATED

### 1. Kaya Terminology
**Status:** ✓ No issues

- 'dharmakaya' used consistently across all layers
- 'truth body' appears only in explanatory contexts
- Sanskrit terms preferred in doctrinal contexts

### 2. sems vs rig pa (Mind vs Awareness)
**Status:** ✓ No issues

- Clear distinction maintained
- No conflation found
- 'mind' and 'awareness' correctly distinguished

### 3. Wisdom Terminology
**Status:** ✓ No issues

- 'wisdom' used for 'ye shes'
- 'jñana' appears occasionally
- 'pristine cognition' used appropriately
- 'knowledge' appears only in compound terms like 'wisdom-knowledge empowerment'

### 4. Metaphysical Precision
**Status:** ✓ No issues

- No 'ground as cause' doctrinal errors
- The phrase 'ground as cause to be made clear' is correct
- Translates 'gsal bar bya ba'i rgyu' - cause to be clarified
- Ground is the object to be recognized, not cause in causal sense

### 5. Recognition vs Attainment
**Status:** ✓ No issues

- 'recognition' used extensively (3,000+ instances)
- 'attainment' appears but not in doctrinally wrong contexts
- No statements like 'wisdom is attained' or 'ground is attained'

### 6. Three Kayas
**Status:** ✓ No issues

- Sanskrit terms used consistently
- No problematic 'truth body' instances in doctrinal contexts

### 7. Three Aspects of Ground
**Status:** ✓ No issues

- Essence, Nature, Compassion terminology consistent
- ngo bo → essence
- rang bzhin → nature
- thugs rje → compassion

### 8. 'original ground' vs 'primordial ground'
**Status:** ✓ Both acceptable

- 'original ground' translates 'gdod ma'i gzhi'
- 'primordial ground' translates 'ye gzhi'
- Both are doctrinally correct
- Different Tibetan terms, both valid
