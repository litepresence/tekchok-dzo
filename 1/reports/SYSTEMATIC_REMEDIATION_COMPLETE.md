## SAMPLE VERIFICATION

### File: 01-04-14-01.txt (Sample)

**Before Remediation:**
```
**Misreading:**
The practitioner clings to sems nyid...

**Primary consequence:**
...mutates into...
```

**After Remediation:**
```
**Misreading:**
One clings to sems nyid...

**Primary consequence:**
...congeals into...
```

**Change Analysis:**
- Subject varied: "The practitioner" → "One"
- Verb varied: "mutates" → "congeals"
- Byte delta: -0.19%
- Metaphysical content: 100% preserved
