## WORK PERFORMED

### Source Analysis
- All 4 files had genuinely incomplete Tibetan source material
- Not a processing error - the source text itself is fragmented
- Lines: 2-4 lines each in original Tibetan

### Regeneration Method
1. Preserved existing content (translated from Tibetan)
2. Added proper XML tags (`<prose>`, `<ornament>`)
3. Added FRAGMENT markers with cross-references
4. Added publication markers (`|| 10 ||`)
5. Maintained Vairotsana voice quality

### Consolidation Notes

**For Future B1 Operations:**
- **01-04-03-01.txt** → Consolidate into 01-04-02-01.txt
- **01-08-08-01.txt** → Consolidate into 01-08-07-01.txt  
- **01-14-07-01.txt** → Consolidate into 01-14-07-03.txt
- **01-14-07-02.txt** → Consolidate into 01-14-07-03.txt

## STATISTICS

- **Files Regenerated:** 4
- **Total Lines:** 10 lines
- **XML Tags Applied:** 10 tags
- **Time:** 15 minutes
- **Source Status:** Incomplete (not a processing error)

---

## IMPACT

**Before:**
- 4 files with raw/unformatted fragment content
- No XML tags
- Unclear status for publication

**After:**
- 4 files with proper XML formatting
- Clear FRAGMENT markers indicating source limitations
- Cross-references to complete sections
- Ready for consolidation (B1 operations)

---

## RECOMMENDATION

These files should be consolidated into their parent files during **B1 operations** rather than kept as separate fragments. The Tibetan source material is genuinely incomplete at these points, suggesting either:
1. Original text was abbreviated
2. Text was damaged/lost in transmission
3. These were intended as section headers only

**Next Step:** Execute B1 consolidation to merge these fragments into their parent sections.

**Copyleft 2026:** In the appearance of regeneration, the fragments were acknowledged.
