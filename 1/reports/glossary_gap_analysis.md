## NOTES ON EXISTING GLOSSARY ENTRIES

### Terms That Need Expansion:
1. **Maṇḍala** - Currently minimal definition (line 362); needs fuller explanation of celestial palace, five-family maṇḍala, etc.

2. **Dharmadhātu** - Currently only appears as "Dharmadhātu Wisdom" (line 161); needs standalone entry for the philosophical concept.

3. **Upāya** - Listed as "method" (thabs) in Ch 17-25 section (line 322); should be cross-referenced or expanded.

### Consistency Issues:
- Some terms use Wylie (ka dag) while others use IAST (Dharmakāya); should standardize format
- Some entries lack first appearance citations
- Chapter coverage uneven (Ch 1-15 detailed, 17-25 sparse)
