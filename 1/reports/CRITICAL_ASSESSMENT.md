## SIGNIFICANT GAPS (C-GRADE) - 14 FILES

These files have substantial Tibetan sources but thin commentary coverage:

### Commentary Layer Issues

| File | Tibetan Size | Comm Lines | Comm Ratio | Grade | Issues |
|------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|--------|
| **01-09-02-01** | 2,316 B | 14 lines | 0.75x | 🟠 C | Only 14 lines for 2.3KB source. Lacks voice rotation. |
| **02-25-02-01** | 3,480 B | 18 lines | 0.74x | 🟠 C | Only 18 lines for 3.5KB source. Thin analysis. |
| **02-25-04-01** | 2,790 B | 19 lines | 0.89x | 🟠 C | Only 19 lines for 2.8KB source. Minimal voices. |

### Tiny Fragment Files (Acceptable for <200B Sources)

These have 1-5 lines but Tibetan sources <200 bytes (acceptable per byte ratio guidelines):

| File | Tibetan Size | Comm Lines | Status |
|------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 01-08-08-01 | 36 B | 2 lines | ✅ Acceptable (structural marker) |
| 01-14-07-01 | 105 B | 4 lines | ✅ Acceptable (structural marker) |
| 01-14-07-02 | 114 B | 4 lines | ✅ Acceptable (structural marker) |
| 02-23-08-01 | 57 B | 3 lines | ✅ Acceptable (structural marker) |
| 01-05-04-03 | 104 B | 5 lines | ✅ Acceptable (tiny source) |

## DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WORST FILES

### 01-09-02-01 - Twelve Links of Dependent Origination

**Tibetan Source:** 2,316 bytes (Medium)  
**Commentary:** 14 lines  
**Grade:** 🟠 C

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Voice Count**: Only 2-3 distinct voices evident (narrator, doctrinal explainer)
2. **Line Ranges**: No explicit [start-end] markers
3. **Coverage**: Only 14 lines for substantial doctrinal content on twelve links
4. **Metaphor Freshness**: Uses "waves arising from ocean" (common metaphor, not fresh)
5. **Direct Pointing**: Some direct language but mostly explanatory

**Delusion Layer:** 🟢 A (152 lines - EXCELLENT)
- 9 distinct error blocks
- Proper cascade chains (2-3 levels)
- Comprehensive coverage of narrative misreadings

**Recommendation:** Commentary needs expansion to 40+ lines with 6+ voices.

### 02-25-02-01 - Fruition: Three Kayas as Result

**Tibetan Source:** 3,480 bytes (Medium)  
**Commentary:** 18 lines  
**Grade:** 🟠 C

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Voice Count**: 3-4 voices (Patrul-like, Garab Dorje, modern explainer)
2. **Line Ranges**: Present ([Final] marker)
3. **Coverage**: Only 18 lines for complex doctrinal topic
4. **Content Quality**: Good content but insufficient depth
5. **Generic Markers**: Uses "[Final]" marker (one of 31 files with this pattern)

**Delusion Layer:** 🟢 A (397 lines - EXCELLENT)
- 20 error blocks
- 4-5 level cascade chains
- Comprehensive taxonomy

**Scholar Layer:** 🔵 A++ (2.23x ratio - EXEMPLARY)

**Recommendation:** Commentary adequate but could expand 30% for A-grade.

---

### 02-25-04-01 - Dharmakaya Abode

**Tibetan Source:** 2,790 bytes (Medium)  
**Commentary:** 20 lines  
**Grade:** 🟠 C

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Voice Count**: 3 voices (doctrinal, Patrul-like, direct pointer)
2. **Line Ranges**: Present ([Final] marker)
3. **Coverage**: Only 20 lines for Dharmakaya analysis
4. **Content Quality**: Good but thin

**Delusion Layer:** 🔵 A++ (7.58x ratio - EXEMPLARY)

**Recommendation:** Commentary adequate but minimal.

---

## PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Generic [Final] Markers

**31 files** use "[Final]" or similar generic closing markers:
- 02-25-02-01
- 02-25-04-01
- 01-04-18-01
- Multiple Chapter 18 completion stage files

**Issue:** These suggest template-driven generation rather than organic voice rotation.

### 2. Voice Rotation Deficiencies

Files with <4 distinct voices on medium sources (>2KB):
- 01-09-02-01: 2-3 voices
- 02-25-02-01: 3-4 voices
- 02-25-04-01: 3 voices

**Standard Required:** 6+ voices for A-grade on medium sections.

### 3. Missing Line Ranges

**<5% of files** have explicit [start-end] line range markers in format [XXXX-XXXX].

**Standard Required:** Line ranges for every block (A++), mostly complete (A).

### 4. Delusion Layer Excellence

Contrary to initial concerns, **delusion layer is the STRONGEST layer:**
- Average ratio: 0.98x
- Ch 17-25 average: 1.34x (exceeds 0.30x minimum)
- 100% have cascade chains
- Safety-critical sections comprehensively covered

## REPAIR RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Enhance Thin Coverage (14 files)

**Target:** Bring C-grade files to B-grade minimum

**Actions:**
1. **01-09-02-01**: Add 20-30 lines, introduce 3-4 additional voices
2. **02-25-02-01**: Add 15-20 lines, vary voice intensity  
3. **02-25-04-01**: Add 15-20 lines, add Patrul/Longchenpa voices

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours total

### Priority 2: Remove Generic Markers (31 files)

**Target:** Replace "[Final]" with organic voice conclusions

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ [Final]
The commentary ends where it began—in recognition.

✓ [10542-10550]
Mountain hermit gathered his few possessions. The cave
would be empty again, as it always was. What had been
said? Nothing that could be repeated. What had been
transmitted? Only what was already present. He bowed
to the emptiness and walked out into snow.
```

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours total

### Priority 3: Add Line Range Markers (All files)

**Target:** Add [start-end] markers to commentary blocks

**Standard:** Every 2-4 paragraphs should reference Tibetan line ranges

**Estimated Effort:** 20-30 hours total

---

## GRADE RECALCULATION (After Repairs)

If Priority 1 repairs completed:
- C-grade: 14 → 0 files
- B-grade: 142 → 156 files
- A-grade: 398 (unchanged)

**Publication Readiness:** 97.8% → 100%

---

## CONCLUSION

**Critical Finding:** The translation project has **ZERO critical failures (F-grade)**.

**Actual Issues:**
- 14 files (6.6%) have thin commentary coverage (C-grade)
- 31 files use generic closing markers
- <5% have explicit line range markers

**Delusion Layer:** Exceptional quality across all sections, including safety-critical advanced practice materials.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with publication after Priority 1 repairs (4-6 hours).
