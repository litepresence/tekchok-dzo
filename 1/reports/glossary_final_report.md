## RECOMMENDED FUTURE ADDITIONS

### High Priority:
1. **ground** - synonym for basis (gzhi) used in some contexts
2. **delusion** - 'khrul pa (confusion vs. non-recognition)
3. ** Trekchö/Thogal relationship** - could add cross-references

### Medium Priority:
1. **five winds** - could expand current "life-wind" entry
2. **four lamps** - already in text but could be glossed
3. **twelve links** - dependent origination (rten 'brel)

### Low Priority:
1. **Additional realm names** - if they appear frequently
2. **Philosophical schools** - already have main ones
3. **Tantra titles** - already have main ones
