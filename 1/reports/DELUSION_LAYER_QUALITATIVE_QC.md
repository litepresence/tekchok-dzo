## OVERVIEW

This report tracks the qualitative assessment of delusion layer files against A++ exemplar standards. Each file is evaluated for:
- Error classification accuracy
- Misreading specificity
- Cascade effect mapping
- Clinical tone consistency
- Structural adherence to prompt_delusion.md framework

**DO NOT USE QUANTITATIVE TECHNIQUES** - Assessment must be QUALITATIVE.

### CHAPTER 02 - CONTAINER WORLD AND CONTENTS BEINGS

#### 01-02-01-01.txt
- **Lines:** 635-892 (Tibetan, 257 lines), 26 lines (Delusion)
- **Status:** CRITICAL - NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
- **Grade:** C+
- **Assessment:** Severely underdeveloped. Only 1 error block (emptiness-clarity non-dual substantialism) with PAGE BLEED AWARENESS. Tibetan source contains extensive cosmological exposition (257 lines) including seven mountains, four continents, hell realms, and world-system measurements. Delusion layer should have 15-25 error blocks covering: spatial substantialism, measurement literalism, Meru reification, hell geography, continent hierarchy, ocean measurements, vertical cosmology, and directional symbolism. File appears to be a stub or incomplete draft.
- **Action Required:** Full enhancement to A++ standards needed.

- **Status:** ACCEPTABLE
- **Grade:** B+
- **Assessment:** Contains 2 error blocks (spatial substantialism/container world reification, karmic geography determinism). Quality is good but coverage is incomplete. Missing error analysis for: directional god hierarchies, specific continent measurements (350 yojanas, 7,500 yojanas), seven gold mountains symbolism, spatial relationship between realms, and container-contents dichotomy. Could be enhanced but meets minimum standards.
- **Action Required:** Optional enhancement to add 3-5 more error blocks.

#### 01-02-01-04.txt
- **Lines:** 999 (Tibetan, 1 line), 15 lines (Delusion)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - EXEMPLAR
- **Grade:** A++

- **Grade:** C+
- **Assessment:** Underdeveloped for extensive Tibetan content (425 lines covering form realms, four great kings, Indra's palace, thirty-three gods, formless realms, pleasure groves). Only 3 error blocks present (form realm attainment addiction, cosmic architecture fetishism, formless realm substantialism). Missing: heavenly hierarchy errors, guardian deity dependency, wish-fulfilling tree materialism, divine city literalism, kalpa-length duration anxiety, and realm-attainment ladder. Significant gaps in coverage.
- **Action Required:** Full enhancement to A++ standards needed. Add 10-15 error blocks.

#### 01-02-02-01.txt
- **Lines:** 1424-1463 (Tibetan, 39 lines), 34 lines (Delusion)
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Grade:** A-
- **Assessment:** Contains 2 error blocks (hell lifespan literalism, cosmic cycling materialism). Appropriate coverage for 39-line Tibetan section on hell calculations and kalpa formation. Could add 1-2 more blocks on specific hell measurements but acceptable as-is. Clinical tone maintained. Cascade effects clear.

#### 01-02-02-02.txt
- **Lines:** 1463-1582 (Tibetan, 119 lines), 52 lines (Delusion)
- **Status:** ACCEPTABLE
- **Grade:** B+
- **Assessment:** Contains 3 error blocks (moral progression addiction, world destruction anxiety, kalpa calculation fetishism). Covers main themes: ten non-virtues lifespan calculations, seven suns destruction, kalpa mathematics. Missing: specific non-virtue analysis (killing, stealing, etc.), moral causality literalism, destruction sequence visualization errors.
