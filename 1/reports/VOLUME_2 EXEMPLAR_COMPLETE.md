## COMPARISON: BEFORE & AFTER EXEMPLAR ROUND

### Chapter 18 (Vajra Essence Path)

**Before:**
```
Thogal is not leaping over but the natural leap of recognition.
The four lamps are not visual phenomena but ways rigpa sees itself.
```

**After (Exemplar):**
```
Thogal is the sun rising—no one pushes it over the horizon. It is 
the natural display of awareness recognizing itself, not through effort 
but through the exhaustion of effort. The visions are not attainments; 
they are the luminescence of recognition, like heat rising from 
fire—natural, spontaneous, undeniable.

The four lamps are four ways of seeing that have always been present, 
obscured only by looking elsewhere. The flesh lamp is the body seen 
as display. The far-reaching water lamp is perception recognized as 
projection. The lamp of empty bindus is form recognized as light. 
The lamp of self-originated wisdom is mind recognizing mind.

The vajra chain (rdo rje lu gu rgyud) is not a sequence to follow but 
the linking of moments, each complete, each connected to what never 
left it. The chain is golden from beginning to end—if you see one 
link as base metal, you miss the gold of all.
```

**Difference:** From definition to transmission
