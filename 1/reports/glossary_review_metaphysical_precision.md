# GLOSSARY REVIEW: Metaphysical Precision & Standardization

## Date: February 19, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The glossary is comprehensive (122 main entries) and generally well-structured, but needs refinement in three areas:

1. **Missing Tibetan Terms:** 8 entries lack Tibetan equivalents
2. **Inconsistent Length:** Definitions range from 15 to 300+ characters
3. **Metaphysical Precision:** Some definitions too generic for Dzogchen context

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Missing Tibetan Terms (8 entries)

| Entry | Line | Issue | Recommended Fix |
|-------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **downward-clearing wind** | 41 | No Tibetan | Add (thur rlung) |
| **elemental formation** | 44 | No Tibetan | Add ('byung 'jog) or similar |
| **Mu-tig-phreng-ba** | 65 | No Tibetan | Add (mu tig phreng ba) |
| **Thal-ba-brdal** | 89 | No Tibetan | Add (thal ba brdal) |
| **Thal-ba-dbyangs** | 90 | No Tibetan | Add (thal ba dbyangs) |
| **Thal-ba-skyob** | 92 | No Tibetan | Add (thal ba skyob) |
| **Thal-ba-'dzin** | 93 | No Tibetan | Add (thal ba 'dzin) |

**Note:** Lines 147-150 are EWTS convention table entries, not glossary terms.

### 2. LENGTH STANDARDIZATION

#### Current Distribution:
- **Very Short** (< 50 chars): ~15 entries - Too brief for technical terms
- **Short** (50-100 chars): ~45 entries - Acceptable
- **Medium** (100-200 chars): ~50 entries - Ideal
- **Long** (200+ chars): ~12 entries - Some necessary, others need trimming

#### Recommended Standard:
- **Standard entries:** 80-150 characters
- **Complex concepts:** 150-250 characters (with Dzogchen-specific nuance)
- **Layer notes:** Keep separate or append in parentheses

---

### 3. METAPHYSICAL PRECISION ISSUES

#### A. Too Generic (Need Dzogchen Context)

**Current:**
```
affliction (nyon mongs) | Mental factors that disturb the mind and create suffering.
```

**Recommended:**
```
affliction (nyon mongs) | Mental factors (kleshas) that disturb the mind; in Dzogchen, recognized as self-liberated when their nature is seen.
```

**Current:**
```
aggregate (phung po) | The five components of personality: form, feeling, perception, formation, consciousness.
```

**Recommended:**
```
aggregate (phung po) | The five skandhas (form, feeling, perception, formation, consciousness); in Dzogchen, seen as spontaneously self-liberated display of the ground rather than solid entities to be rejected.
```

#### B. Lacks Distinction from Lower Vehicles

**Current:**
```
Dharmakāya (chos sku) | Truth body; the formless dimension of enlightenment beyond all concepts.
```

**Recommended:**
```
Dharmakāya (chos sku) | Truth body; the formless dimension of enlightenment beyond all concepts. In Dzogchen: primordially pure from the beginning (ka dag), not produced by causes, the essence-aspect of the basis.
```

**Current:**
```
Sambhogakāya (longs sku) | Enjoyment body; the dimension of enlightened communication and blessing.
```

**Recommended:**
```
Sambhogakāya (longs sku) | Enjoyment body; the dimension of enlightened communication. In Dzogchen: self-appearing luminosity (rang snang), the nature-aspect of spontaneous presence (lhun grub).
```

#### C. Missing Technical Precision

**Current:**
```
appearance (snang ba) | Phenomenal display, manifestation; rang snang (self-appearance), snang stong (appearance-emptiness).
```

**Recommended:**
```
appearance (snang ba) | Phenomenal display or manifestation; rang snang (self-appearance of awareness) vs. gzhan snang (other-appearance of delusion). Key Dzogchen distinction: appearances are not separate from emptiness (snang stong dbyer med).
```

**Current:**
```
bindu (thig le) | Energy drops or essences; white and red bindus at crown and navel; basis of subtle experience.
```

**Recommended:**
```
bindu (thig le) | Energy drops or essences; white (male) bindu at crown, red (female) bindu at navel. In Dzogchen: the basis of subtle body manifestation, dissolves into clear light at death. Distinct from Hindu bindu concepts.
```

## STANDARDIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Format Standard:

**Standard Entry (80-150 chars):**
```
| **term** (tibetan) | Precise definition with Dzogchen nuance. First appearance. |
```

**Complex Entry (150-250 chars):**
```
| **term** (tibetan) | Detailed definition distinguishing Dzogchen view from lower vehicles. Key characteristics. First appearance. |
```

**With Layer Notes (append):**
```
| **term** (tibetan) | Definition. Note: Literal layer uses X; Liturgical layer uses Y. First appearance. |
```

### Examples of Standardized Entries:

**Good (Keep as-is):**
```
| **primordial purity** (ka dag) | The view that the basis is empty and pure from the beginning, free from all elaborations. | 01-08-01-01:10480 |
| **vidya** (rig pa) | Primordial awareness; knowing without duality or confusion. Distinct from ordinary awareness. | 01-01-01-01:6 |
```

**Needs Expansion:**
```
| **affliction** (nyon mongs) | Mental factors that disturb the mind and create suffering. | 01-03-03-01:1821 |
```
→ Expand to include Dzogchen perspective on self-liberation

**Needs Trimming:**
```
| **Kunzhi** (kun gzhi) "All-Ground" | The universal ground or basis of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa; the neutral ground of all experience. In Dzogchen, distinguished from Dharmakāya (primordially pure wisdom) and from Kunzhi consciousness (the defiled aspect). Literal layer: "kunzhi" (lowercase); Liturgical layer: "Kunzhi" (capitalized). | 01-14-01-01:17361 |
```
→ Keep main definition, move layer notes to Usage section or parentheses

## SPECIFIC ENTRIES TO REVISE

### High Priority (Metaphysical Precision):

1. **affliction** - Add self-liberation perspective
2. **aggregate** - Add Dzogchen view on skandhas
3. **appearance** - Clarify rang snang vs gzhan snang
4. **Dharmakāya** - Add ka dag and essence-aspect
5. **Sambhogakāya** - Add lhun grub and nature-aspect  
6. **Nirmanakāya** - Add thugs rje/compassion-aspect
7. **clear light** - Add connection to 'od gsal and death
8. **bardo** - Add moment-to-moment interpretation
9. **rigpa/vidya** - Expand distinction from ordinary awareness
10. **primordial purity** - Already good, could add emptiness aspect

### Medium Priority (Standardization):

11. **life-wind** (duplicate entry at lines 55, 56) - Consolidate
12. **bindu** - Add white/red distinction and death dissolution
13. **channel** - Clarify distinction from physical nerves
14. **wind** - Add five winds specificity
15. **wisdom** - Distinguish from prajna vs jnana

### Low Priority (Tibetan Terms):

16. **downward-clearing wind** - Add (thur rlung)
17. **elemental formation** - Add Tibetan or clarify term
18. **Thal-ba-*** entries - Add Tibetan for consistency
19. **Mu-tig-phreng-ba** - Add (mu tig phreng ba)

## LAYER-SPECIFIC NOTES

Move the following to a separate "Layer-Specific Renderings" section:

- Kunzhi: Literal layer uses "kunzhi" (lowercase); Liturgical layer uses "Kunzhi" (capitalized)
- Lugu Gyud: Literal layer uses "Lugu Gyud"; Liturgical layer uses "Spiral Continuity"
- Thogal: Literal layer uses "thogal" (lowercase); Liturgical layer uses "Thogal" (capitalized)

Keep main glossary entries clean and move implementation notes to Usage section.
