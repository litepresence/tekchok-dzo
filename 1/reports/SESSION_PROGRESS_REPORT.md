## TOOLS DEVELOPED

### Line Range Verification Script:
```bash
for f in /path/to/scholar/*.txt; do
  t="${f//scholar\//\/tibetan\/}"
  sfirst=$(head -1 "$f" | grep -oP '^\[\K[0-9]+' | head -1)
  tfirst=$(head -1 "$t" | grep -oP '^\[\K[0-9]+' | head -1)
  if [ "$sfirst" != "$tfirst" ]; then
    echo "MISMATCH: $(basename $f)"
  fi
done
```

### Four Pillars Counter:
```bash
for tag in structure philology context concept; do
  grep -c "<$tag>" filename.txt
done
```

## NEXT ACTIONS

### Immediate (High Priority):
1. Rewrite 2 critical files (01-02-01-05.txt, 01-04-04-01.txt)
2. Fix 19 minor line range mismatches
3. Complete review of remaining Chapter 1.14 files (8 files)

### Short-term:
1. Begin Volume 2 systematic review (93 files)
2. Verify all files have comprehensive Four Pillars coverage
3. Cross-check philosophical terminology consistency

### Documentation:
- 笨 Master QC report updated: SCHOLAR_LAYER_QUALITATIVE_QC.md

## KEY FINDINGS

1. **Scholar file length is not an indicator of quality** - Commentary can be extensive
2. **Line range alignment is critical** - Must match Tibetan source exactly
3. **Most files (60%) are already A++ quality** - Only 21 need correction
4. **Four Pillars framework is consistently applied** - Where present, coverage is good
5. **Two files have wrong content entirely** - Need complete rewrite, not just adjustment

---

## TIME ESTIMATE FOR COMPLETION

- **2 critical rewrites:** 4-6 hours each = 8-12 hours
- **19 minor adjustments:** 15-30 minutes each = 5-10 hours
- **8 remaining Chapter 1.14 files:** 30 minutes each = 4 hours
- **Volume 2 (93 files):** 15 minutes per file average = 23 hours

**Total estimated time to full A++ completion:** ~40-50 hours
