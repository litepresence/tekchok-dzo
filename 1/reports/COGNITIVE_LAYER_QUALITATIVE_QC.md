## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED

### Content Mismatches (Fixed)

**1. 01-04-05-01.txt - SEVERE MISMATCH**
- **Issue:** Cognitive file discussed "Five paths" (accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, no-more-learning)
- **Actual Tibetan Content:** Two truths (false conventional, true conventional), eight examples of illusion, ultimate truth (don dam bden pa)
- **Status:** ✅ REWRITTEN with accurate coverage of two truths, illusion analogies, and ultimate truth classifications
- **Root Cause:** File was completely mismatched to different content

**2. 01-04-11-01.txt - MAJOR MISMATCH**
- **Issue:** Cognitive file discussed "Forbearance stage" (bzod pa) in five paths
- **Actual Tibetan Content:** Svātantrika vs Prasaṅgika interpretations of illusion (sgyu ma), two truths analysis, barren woman's son analogy
- **Status:** ✅ REWRITTEN with accurate coverage of Madhyamaka doxography and illusion doctrine
- **Root Cause:** File content belonged to entirely different doctrinal topic

**3. 01-04-06-01.txt - MAJOR MISMATCH**
- **Issue:** Cognitive file discussed "Ten bodhisattva stages" (sa bcu) with specific stage names
- **Actual Tibetan Content:** Five paths (lam lnga) structure, two truths analysis, 37 bodhipakṣa factors, Cittamātra vs Madhyamaka doxography
- **Status:** ✅ REWRITTEN with accurate coverage of five paths, two truths, and gradual path structure
- **Root Cause:** File confused ten stages with five paths content
