## CONVERSION EXAMPLE

### BEFORE (Structured Format):
```
[1983-1988]
RECOGNITION:
Causation debate. Temporary causes and conditions gathering produce sentient being results.

VIEW REGISTER:
Madhyamaka / Causation debate

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- rgyu glo bur ba = temporary causes
- 'bras bu sems can = sentient being result

PRESERVATION FLAGS:
- Causation theories
- Nihilist positions
```

### AFTER (Prose Format):
```
[1902-1906]
Doxographic exposition opening. Erroneous vehicles classification into two main categories: eternalism and nihilism. The text positions itself as orthodox evaluator of non-Buddhist positions. Three hundred sixty views as comprehensive catalog of wrong positions. Structural binary: general nature of extremes first, specific varieties second. Translate *log pa'i theg pa* as errant vehicles, not wrong paths. Preserve evaluative stance without modernizing.
```
