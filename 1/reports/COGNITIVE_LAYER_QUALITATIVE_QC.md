### AFTER (Prose):
```
[2539-2546]
Śrāvakayāna exposition opening. Fivefold analytical structure: essence, definition, purpose, result, divisions. Personal liberation motivation: wanting to escape saṃsāra for oneself alone. Wisdom realizing person selflessness as method. Definition: one who hears from teacher, proclaims to others, achieves final existence bodhi, depends on teacher. Purpose: definite emergence from saṃsāra. Result: arhat attainment with remainder. Structural clarity in fivefold exposition must be preserved; resist flattening into narrative.
```
