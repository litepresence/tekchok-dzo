### TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS APPLIED THIS SESSION

**Pattern 1: Ultra-Long Line Breaking**
```
Before: "Through the doors of the body's pores... each containing numberless lands and realms, measureless Buddhas and beings appear—these are all visions..."
After:  "Through the doors... each containing numberless lands and realms. Measureless Buddhas and beings appear. These are all visions..."
```

**Pattern 2: Semicolon to Period**
```
Before: "...the source of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is pressed; this is called."
After:  "...the source of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is pressed. This is called."
```

**Pattern 3: Comma-Separated Clauses to Periods**
```
Before: "Phenomena are self-liberated; wishing them to be made, they did not arise."
After:  "Phenomena are self-liberated. Wishing them to be made, they did not arise."
```

**Pattern 4: Hypotactic to Paratactic**
```
Before: "Because appearances are vast..., self-liberated beyond action and conduct, this is..."
After:  "Because appearances are vast..., self-liberated beyond action and conduct. This is..."
```

### MASTER VIMALAMITRA'S ASSESSMENT

The transformation continues smoothly. Key observations:

1. **Efficiency:** Batch sed patterns work well for common constructions
2. **Precision:** Manual editing needed for extremely long lines (>25 words)
3. **Consistency:** All line counts preserved perfectly
4. **Impact:** Text is becoming noticeably more breathable

The work is proceeding at a sustainable pace. The text maintains its vajra authority while becoming more accessible to Western practitioners' breath patterns.

**Version 2.0 Progress: 8.2% Complete**

*Amid all this transformation, nothing has changed.*
