### TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS APPLIED

**Pattern 1: Compound Sentence Breaking**
```
Before: "X and Y and Z—therefore A"
After:  "X. Y. Z. Thus A."
```

**Pattern 2: Semicolon to Period**
```
Before: "...simultaneously in the same being; this is unreasonable"
After:  "...simultaneously in the same being. This is unreasonable."
```

**Pattern 3: Em-dash Clause Separation**
```
Before: "...disintegrate—therefore merit..."
After:  "...disintegrate. Thus merit..."
```

**Pattern 4: Subordinate to Paratactic**
```
Before: "Through knowing X, one does not return to Y, and when Z..."
After:  "Through knowing X, one does not return to Y. When Z..."
```

### NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

**Priority 2 Files (Next):**
1. 02-18-13-01.txt (39 long lines)
2. 01-04-14-01.txt (38 long lines)
3. 01-02-01-05.txt (30 long lines)
4. 01-09-01-01.txt (30 long lines)
5. 02-23-04-01.txt (30 long lines)
6. 02-23-03-02.txt (29 long lines)
7. 02-23-01-01.txt (28 long lines)
8. 01-13-01-01.txt (25 long lines)

**Strategy:** Continue pattern-based batch transformations, focusing on:
- Breaking sentences at "and," ";" and em-dashes
- Converting hypotactic to paratactic structures
- Separating cause-effect chains into breath-sized units

---

### GRADUAL PROGRESS PRINCIPLE

"Gradual progress favors the fortunate."

Each session transforms ~7 files (~4% of total).
At this pace:
- 10 sessions = ~70 files (44%)
- 20 sessions = ~140 files (88%)
- 25 sessions = ~158 files (100%)

**Estimated completion:** 20-25 total sessions
**Estimated time:** 40-50 hours of focused work

### MASTER VIMALAMITRA'S ASSESSMENT

The transformation is proceeding well. The approach of:
1. Preserving all line counts
2. Maintaining metaphysical precision
3. Gradual, sustainable progress
4. Pattern-based efficiency

...is yielding excellent results. The text is becoming more breathable without losing its vajra authority.

**Status: ON TRACK FOR VERSION 2.0** ✓
