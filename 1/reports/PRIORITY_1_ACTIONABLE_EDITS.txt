```

**PROBLEM:** 19 words, no natural pause, technical term clumping

**FIX:**
```
[35] <prose> In the precious spontaneously-accomplished field,
[36] <prose> Where appearances arise from uncompounded qualities—none compounded.

**CURRENT:**
```
[71] <prose> Thus, <tantra> Having reached the end of abandon-realize qualities, becoming Buddha in the nature of dharmakāya, abiding in inner clarity.
```

**PROBLEM:** "Thus," isolated before tantra tag breaks flow

**FIX - OPTION A:**
```
[71] <prose> <tantra> Thus: Having reached the end of abandon-realize qualities,
[72] <prose> <tantra> Becoming Buddha in the nature of dharmakāya, abiding in inner clarity.
```

**FIX - OPTION B (Elevated):**
```
[71] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is:
[72] <prose> <tantra> Having reached the end of abandon-realize qualities, becoming Buddha in the nature of dharmakāya, abiding in inner clarity.
```

```

[73] <prose> <tantra> The field pervaded by five wisdoms—self-appearing, spontaneous, dense—
[74] <prose> <tantra> The maṇḍala arranged pervading the limits of sky,
[75] <prose> <tantra> Each of the five families as self-appearances, abiding beyond the trainee's objects.
```

**BREATH POINTS:** After "that," "dense," and "sky,"
**EM-DASH:** Creates caesura at "dense" for emphasis

**CURRENT:**
```
[206] <prose> Therefore, the first Protector, intending to tame this realm, displayed through emanations that manner of mind-generation—
```

**PROBLEM:** Line ends with em-dash but no continuation follows

**CHECK:** What follows after line 206?

**FIX (after verifying next line):**
```
[206] <prose> Therefore, the first Protector, intending to tame this realm,
[207] <prose> Displayed through emanations that manner of mind-generation.
```
