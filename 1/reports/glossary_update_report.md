## SUMMARY OF CHANGES

### Critical Issues Resolved:

✅ **Missing Tibetan Terms (7 added):**
- downward-clearing wind (thur rlung)
- elemental formation ('byung 'jog)
- Mu-tig-phreng-ba (mu tig phreng ba)
- Thal-ba-brdal (thal ba brdal)
- Thal-ba-dbyangs (thal ba dbyangs)
- Thal-ba-skyob (thal ba skyob)
- Thal-ba-'dzin (thal ba 'dzin)

✅ **Duplicate Entry Consolidated:**
- Combined two "life-wind" entries into one comprehensive entry

✅ **Metaphysical Precision Enhanced (9 entries):**

1. **affliction** (nyon mongs)
   - Before: "Mental factors that disturb the mind and create suffering."
   - After: "Mental factors (kleshas) that disturb the mind; in Dzogchen, recognized as spontaneously self-liberated when their true nature is directly seen."

2. **aggregate** (phung po)
   - Before: "The five components of personality: form, feeling, perception, formation, consciousness."
   - After: "The five skandhas (form, feeling, perception, formation, consciousness); in Dzogchen, the aggregates are not rejected but recognized as the spontaneously self-liberated display of the ground (lhun grub kyi snang ba)."

3. **appearance** (snang ba)
   - Before: "Phenomenal display, manifestation; rang snang (self-appearance), snang stong (appearance-emptiness)."
   - After: "Phenomenal display or manifestation; rang snang (self-appearance of awareness, pure) vs. gzhan snang (other-appearance of delusion, impure); in Dzogchen, appearances and emptiness are non-dual (snang stong dbyer med)."

4. **bardo** (bar do)
   - Before: "Intermediate state between death and rebirth; also moment-to-moment gaps in this life."
   - After: "Intermediate state between death and rebirth; four types: natural (life), dying, dharmatā (reality), and existence; also refers to moment-to-moment gaps in ordinary experience."

5. **Dharmakāya** (chos sku)
   - Before: "Truth body; the formless dimension of enlightenment beyond all concepts."
   - After: "Truth body; the formless dimension of enlightenment beyond all concepts. In Dzogchen: primordially pure from the beginning (ka dag), unproduced by causes, the essence-aspect (ngo bo) of the basis; inseparable from Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya."

6. **Sambhogakāya** (longs sku)
   - Before: "Enjoyment body; the dimension of enlightened communication and blessing."
   - After: "Enjoyment body; the dimension of enlightened communication and self-appearance. In Dzogchen: self-appearing luminosity (rang snang), the nature-aspect (rang bzhin) of spontaneous presence (lhun grub); inseparable from Dharmakaya."

7. **Nirmanakāya** (sprul sku)
   - Before: "Emanation body; the dimension through which enlightenment manifests in the world."
   - After: "Emanation body; the dimension through which enlightenment manifests in the world for beings to be trained. In Dzogchen: unceasing compassion (thugs rje), the manifestation-aspect of spontaneous presence (lhun grub)."

8. **bindu** (thig le)
   - Before: "Energy drops or essences; white and red bindus at crown and navel; basis of subtle experience."
   - After: "Energy drops or essences; white (male, bodhicitta) bindu at crown, red (female, blood) bindu at navel. In Dzogchen: basis of subtle body manifestation, dissolves into clear light at death, giving rise to thögal visions."

9. **clear light** ('od gsal)
   - Before: "Luminous clarity; dharmakāya at death; fundamental nature of mind."
   - After: "Luminous clarity; the fundamental nature of mind as self-illuminating awareness. In Dzogchen: recognized as Dharmakaya at death (inner clear light) and in thögal practice (outer clear light of visionary experience); the ground of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa."

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Review by lineage holder** - Verify Dzogchen interpretations
2. **Cross-reference with text** - Ensure consistency with actual usage
3. **Add Sanskrit equivalents** where missing (for academic users)
4. **Consider adding:**
   - Rigpa (as separate from vidya, if distinction is made in text)
   - Trekchö (complement to Thogal entry)
   - More detailed wind entries (upward-moving, fire-dwelling, etc.)

## NOTES FOR PROOF EDITOR

The glossary now provides:
- **Consistent formatting** across all entries
- **Dzogchen-specific nuance** for key metaphysical terms
- **Complete Tibetan coverage** for all terms
- **Appropriate length** (80-250 chars for standard entries)
- **Clear distinctions** from lower vehicle interpretations

**Critical terms** (Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya, rigpa, ka dag, lhun grub) now include specific Dzogchen metaphysical context that distinguishes this translation from generic Buddhist glossaries.
