# Scholar Layer File-by-File Analysis
## Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod - Volume 1 & 2

**Total Files:** 213  
**Analysis Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Purpose:** Compare scholar layer vs Tibetan source and liturgical translation

---

## METHODOLOGY

Each scholar file was analyzed for:
1. **Line count** - Comprehensive files should have 40+ lines
2. **Analysis blocks** - Presence of `<structure>`, `<philology>`, `<context>`, `<concept>` markers
3. **Content depth** - Specific engagement with Tibetan terms vs generic summaries
4. **Comparative quality** - Does it analyze the Tibetan source meaningfully?

## QUALITY GRADING

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **A++** | Exceptional: Multiple analysis types, deep philological engagement, specific Tibetan term analysis |
| **A+** | Strong: Good analysis coverage, clear structure, meaningful engagement |
| **A** | Good: Adequate analysis, some depth |
| **B+** | Adequate: Basic coverage but could be enhanced |
| **B** | Weak: Limited analysis, generic content |
| **C** | Poor: Fragmented, template-like, or missing substantial analysis |
