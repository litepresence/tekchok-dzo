## Confirmed Awkward Verses Found

### CRITICAL ISSUES (Chapter 25 Final Colophon)

**Line 17248:**
```
That many fields Dharma-doctrine supreme this, auspicious ocean filling—may it be!
```
**Problem:** Extremely awkward syntax. "That many fields Dharma-doctrine supreme this" is nearly incomprehensible.
**Suggested:** "May the supreme Dharma-doctrine fill many fields like an auspicious ocean—may it be!"

**Line 17265:**
```
This doctrine Supreme Vehicle heart-essence's lotus-grove from,
```
**Problem:** Reversed word order (Tibetan syntax). "From" at end is confusing.
**Suggested:** "From the lotus-grove of this doctrine's Supreme Vehicle heart-essence,"

**Line 17266:**
```
Supreme arising various self-liberated yogins,
```
**Problem:** Missing connecting words. Are the yogins arising? Or is it describing them?
**Suggested:** "Various supreme yogins, self-liberated through arising,"

**Line 17267:**
```
Luminous heart-essence's meanings shown went.
```
**Problem:** "Shown went" is awkward verb construction.
**Suggested:** "The luminous heart-essence's meanings were revealed."

**Line 17273:**
```
Now abiding and later coming's,
```
**Problem:** Incomplete thought with awkward possessive.
**Suggested:** "For those now abiding and those coming later,"

**Line 17275:**
```
Final meaning's points oral instruction given,
```
**Problem:** Missing verb/auxiliary. Sounds like notes, not verse.
**Suggested:** "Final meaning's points given as oral instruction,"

**Line 17280 & 17286:**
```
Those meaning collected Supreme Vehicle treasury this precious.
```
**Problem:** No main verb. "Those meaning collected" is not English.
**Suggested:** "This precious Supreme Vehicle treasury of collected meanings,"

### MODERATE ISSUES

**Chapter 25, Line 17242:**
```
Groves, lakes, flowers, medicine-gardens—all ornamented beautiful,
```
**Problem:** "Ornamented beautiful" should be "beautifully ornamented" or "beautifully arrayed."

**Chapter 25, Line 17243:**
```
Previously nonexistent Dharma-treasure, supreme qualities, conduct, clairvoyance and samādhi possessing,
```
**Problem:** What is possessing? The line lacks a clear subject/verb structure.

**Chapter 25, Line 17237:**
```
Virtue supreme benefit happiness arising's place,
```
**Problem:** Chain of nouns without clear relationship. "Arising's" is awkward possessive.

### MINOR ISSUES (Style/Poetic Flow)

**Chapter 25, Lines 17253-17256** - The "vast" repetition:
```
Those sky-space like vast, wisdom samādhi vast,
Immeasurable intention-conduct ocean vast, doing others' benefit vast,
Luminous sun-moon appearance vast, and deeds vast,
```
**Problem:** Five "vast" in four lines is repetitive in English (though Tibetan may use different words).

**Chapter 1, Line 16:**
```
From primordial purity elaborations cease into space, beautifully arrayed,
```
**Problem:** Elaborations "cease into space" is slightly odd. Do they cease, or dissolve?

## Pattern Identified

The awkward verses cluster in:
1. **Final colophon of Chapter 25** (self-praise and dedication verses)
2. **Allegorical verses in Chapter 10** (narrative story)
3. **Technical description verses throughout** (where Tibetan syntax doesn't translate)

## Root Cause

These verses suffer from **literal Tibetan-to-English translation** where:
- Tibetan case markers (genitive, locative) become awkward possessives ('s)
- Verb-final syntax creates Yoda-like constructions
- Elliptical expressions (common in Tibetan) seem incomplete in English
- Compound words don't have English equivalents

## Recommendation

**Option 1: Keep as-is**
- Pros: Authentic to Tibetan structure
- Cons: Sounds like "translation," not "transmission"

**Option 2: Prose conversion**
- Convert most awkward verses to prose with poetic formatting
- Pros: Clear meaning, elegant English
- Cons: Loses verse structure

**Option 3: Poetic recasting**
- Rewrite verses maintaining meter and meaning but with English syntax
- Pros: Poetic power + clarity
- Cons: More interpretive, moves away from literal

**My Recommendation:** Option 3 for the CRITICAL issues (lines 17248, 17265-17267, 17273, 17275, 17280). These are so awkward they break the majesty of the text.

## Next Steps

1. Confirm which verses to recast
2. Create revised versions maintaining metaphysical accuracy
3. Ensure line count preservation (1:1 with Tibetan)
4. Apply caesura marks for breath rhythm

**The text is NOT done.** These verses stick out as "translation" rather than "transmission."
