## DOCTRINAL DISTINCTION PRESERVED

### When 'gzhi' = 'ground' (doctrinal):
- gzhi lam (ground path)
- gzhi gcig (one ground)
- gzhi snang (ground appearance)
- gzhi gnas (ground abiding)
- ye gzhi (primordial ground)
- 'khor 'das gzhi (samsara-nirvana ground)

### When 'gzhi' = 'basis' (non-doctrinal):
- brtag gzhi (analyzed basis - philosophical)
- sbyang gzhi (purified basis)
- gzhi dang snying po (basis and essence - technical)
