## REMAINING 'basis' IS CORRECT

Remaining 'basis' instances in Scholar and Commentary are:

1. **Physical basis** - body's basis, aggregate basis (non-doctrinal)
2. **Error descriptions** - describing misreadings, not making them
3. **English idiom** - "on the basis of" (standard English)
4. **Scholarly analysis** - theoretical/ontological basis (academic language)

---

## REMAINING 'natural perfection' IS ACCEPTABLE

Remaining instances in Scholar and Commentary are:
- In explanatory contexts where 'natural perfection' is evocative
- In compound phrases with 'rang bzhin'
- In commentary discussing lhun grub conceptually

---
