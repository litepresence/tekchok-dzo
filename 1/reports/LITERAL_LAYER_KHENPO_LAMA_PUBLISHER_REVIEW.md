## FINAL VERDICT

### Khenpo Says:
> "The Literal layer achieves its purpose as immutable foundation. Technical precision is exceptional, especially in Chapters 7, 11, 14, and 18. The 1:1 grammatical mapping allows scholars to work back to Tibetan with confidence. The layer is frozen for good reason - it is correct."

### Lama Says:
> "The Literal layer provides solid ground for commentary transmission. Chapters 7 (Samaya) and 11 (Subtle Body) are particularly strong foundations. The Patrul voice in commentary can build naturally on this base. Nothing here obscures the meaning."

### Publisher Says:
> "The Literal layer is technically sound and commercially viable. 37,756 lines of consistent formatting. Frozen status appropriate for foundation layer. No defects requiring remediation. Ready for publication as reference layer."
