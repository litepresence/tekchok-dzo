## TRUNCATED CONTENT REVIEW

### Finding: Content Was NOT Removed

The "truncated" content was preserved. Only line ranges were adjusted.

**What happened:**
- Blocks that exceeded Tibetan boundaries had their end-line adjusted
- Content itself was NOT deleted
- All 173 "truncated" blocks still exist in files

---

## CONTENT QUALITY ANALYSIS

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Specific blocks | 1640 | 96.4% |
| Generic blocks | 61 | 3.6% |
| **Total** | **1701** | **100%** |

### Generic Blocks (61 blocks, 3.6%)
- Appear in short Tibetan passages (3-15 lines)
- Most are transitional/structural sections
- Could be improved but not wrong
- Examples: "Structural function: Textual exposition continuing..."
