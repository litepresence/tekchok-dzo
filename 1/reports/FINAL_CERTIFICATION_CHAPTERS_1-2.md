"Some hermit in a yak hair tent near the Nepali border once tried to 
pronounce that Sanskrit title aloud while his butter tea cooled. He got 
as far as 'Yānāgra' before his old dog started howling."

"I used to think the five perfections were something grand you accumulate, 
like yak butter in a churn. Now I see they're more like the five holes 
in my tent—always there, letting light in whether I notice or not."

"My grandmother would say this is like smoke from the fire. It goes 
everywhere, touches everything, but you can't grab it. She never read 
a sutra in her life. Smartest person I knew."
