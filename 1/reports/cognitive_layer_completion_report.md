## QUALITY VERIFICATION

### Specific Content Examples

**Before (generic):**
```
Structural function: Textual exposition continuing sequential doctrinal presentation.
```

**After (specific):**
```
Empowerment (dbang) analysis. The transmission blessing enters through the crown,
fills the body, matures the subtle channels. Four empowerments: vase, secret,
wisdom-knowledge, precious word. Each empowerment purifies specific obscurations
and plants the seed of specific kayas.
```

2. ✓ Uses appropriate technical terminology
3. ✓ Maintains doctrinal precision
4. ✓ Recognizes the ground (gzhi) vs path (lam) distinction
5. ✓ Preserves ka dag (primordial purity) as ground, not achievement
6. ✓ Distinguishes sems (deluded mind) from rig pa (awareness)
7. ✓ Tracks translation decisions with technical precision
