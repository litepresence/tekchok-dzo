## PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT

### From Pointing (Aggressive):
- Commands action from the reader
- Creates pressure and urgency
- Demands immediate recognition
- Uses imperative language

### To Resonating (Heart-Essence):
- Invites investigation through presence
- Creates space while maintaining clarity
- Points to the nature of what is
- Uses warm, realized language

### Wrathful Voices Retained but Transformed:

**OLD Lion-Faced:**
```
BINDING? You want to bind the ESSENCE?
Slash through hesitation.
```

**NEW Lion-Faced:**
```
BINDING? You want to bind the ESSENCE?
Hesitation itself—does it have a root? Look closely, and it dissolves.
```

**OLD:**
```
Wake up! Stop dreaming! The time is NOW!
```

**NEW:**
```
This very dream—who is dreaming it? Look. The dreamer cannot be found.
```

## QUALITY VERIFICATION

✅ No more "Cut through" imperatives  
✅ No more "Liberate NOW" demands  
✅ No more "Sever immediately" commands  
✅ No more "Stop. Recognize" patterns  
✅ Wrathful voices use "fierce yet spacious" language  
✅ Tone is resonating (snying po) not forcing  
✅ All 27 voices remain distinct  
✅ Fresh metaphors preserved  
✅ Heart-essence transmission maintained

---

## PROMPT UPDATES

The `prompt_commentary.md` has been updated to:
1. Change "POINTING, NOT EXPLAINING" → "RESONATING, NOT FORCING"
2. Add "FIERCE YET SPACIOUS: THE WRATHFUL HEART" section
3. Update Lion-Faced voice examples to show fierce-but-spacious patterns
4. Update First Point voice to be less commanding
5. Add resonance checks to quality verification

---

## CONCLUSION

Volume 1 Commentary has been successfully repaired to emphasize **heart-essence resonance** (snying po'i man ngag) over aggressive pointing. The 27 Dzogchen master voices now create an atmosphere where recognition can arise naturally, without the text attempting to force direct introduction.

The wrathful voices retain their fierce energy but channel it through **invitation** rather than **command**, maintaining authentic Dzogchen transmission while respecting the reader's own timing and capacity.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Ready for:** Volume 2 (Chapters 15-25) with updated approach
