## EDIT 5: 02-19-01-01.txt [Line 659] - CRITICAL
**Issue:** 338 words - EXTREME length
**Action:** This requires manual breaking into 6-8 sentences
**Location:** Mid-file, requires reading context

**Approach:**
1. Read full line and identify natural break points at:
   - Periods
   - Semicolons
   - Transition words ("Furthermore," "Therefore,")
2. Break into logical sections of 40-50 words each
3. Maintain tantra citation integrity

## EDIT 6: 02-19-01-01.txt [Additional lines]
**Lines needing breaks:** 217, 225, 256, 278
**Word counts:** 72, 85, 133, 65 words

**Approach:** Similar to Edit 5 - break at natural transition points
