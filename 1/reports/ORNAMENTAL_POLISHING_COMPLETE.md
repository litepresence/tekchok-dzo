**Scope:** All ornamental headers using First/Second/Third/Fourth

## EDGE CASES PRESERVED

The following were intentionally NOT changed:

1. **Tantra Citations:** Text within <tantra> tags preserved as-is
   - Example: "From the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle," in tantra citations
   - Reason: These are scripture quotations, not ornamental headers

2. **Chapter 1 Sanskrit Elements:** ༄༅། and Sanskrit titles preserved
   - Reason: These are traditional root text elements

3. **List Items:** Short enumerations like "First: six," or "First: two,"
   - Capitalized per standard, but structure preserved

---
