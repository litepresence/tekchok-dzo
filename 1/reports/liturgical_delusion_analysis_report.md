# Liturgical + Delusion Layer Analysis Report
## Lotsawa-Grade Doctrinal Verification

---

## SUMMARY

Both layers verified for doctrinal consistency. The delusion layer correctly describes errors that readers make when misreading the liturgical translation.

---

## LAYER DESCRIPTIONS

| Layer | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Liturgical | Translation | Liturgical translation for practice |
| Delusion | Analytical | Error mapping - describes MISREADINGS |

---

## KEY INSIGHT

The delusion layer describes ERRORS, not the correct view:
- Liturgical has the correct translation
- Delusion describes how readers MISREAD that translation
- Both must use correct doctrinal terminology

---

## ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED

### 1. 'basis' in error descriptions

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 'the basis is empty' | 1 | 0 |
| 'the basis is emptiness' | 1 | 0 |
| 'the basis is like a mirror' | 1 | 0 |
| 'basis and display' | 1 | 0 |
| 'separating basis from display' | 1 | 0 |
| **Total** | **5** | **0** |

**Rule:** Error descriptions must use correct terminology when describing doctrinal concepts. The error is misreading the GROUND, not a "basis".

### 2. 'original purity' in error descriptions

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 'original purity' | 12 | 0 |
| **Total** | **12** | **0** |

**Rule:** Always use 'primordial purity' for ka dag, never 'original purity'.
