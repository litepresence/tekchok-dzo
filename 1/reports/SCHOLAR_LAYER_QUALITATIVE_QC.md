## CLARIFICATION: SCHOLAR FILE LENGTH

**Important Note:** Scholar files appropriately contain extensive commentary and analysis that can be considerably longer than the Tibetan source text. The Tibetan and liturgical layers match line-for-line, while the scholar layer provides:
- Detailed Four Pillars analysis
- Philological commentary
- Doxographical context
- Conceptual unpacking

**Proper Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Do scholar line range tags (e.g., [45-66]) match actual Tibetan source lines?
2. Is Four Pillars framework comprehensively applied?
3. Is the analysis accurate and substantive?
4. Is Wylie terminology properly used with semantic explanations?

## QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT PROGRESS

**Assessment Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Evaluation Method:** Line-by-line verification of scholar tags against Tibetan source

### Files Verified A++:
- 01-01-01-01.txt through 01-01-03-01.txt (Chapter 1 complete)
- 01-02-01-01.txt through 01-02-01-04.txt (Four Great Kings section)
- Most files in 01-03 through 01-04 series properly aligned

### Files with LINE RANGE MISMATCHES (Require editing):

#### 🔴 CRITICAL (Content from wrong topic/major gap):
| File | Scholar Starts | Tibetan Starts | Issue |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| 01-04-04-01.txt | [2539] | [2836] | -297 lines - Scholar has Śrāvakayāna content, Tibetan has Two Truths |
| 01-06-09-01.txt | [8770] | [8810] | -40 lines - Major gap |

#### 🟡 MODERATE (Minor gap, content likely aligned):
| File | Scholar Starts | Tibetan Starts | Issue |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| 01-04-05-01.txt | [2833] | [2849] | -16 lines - Content aligned (Two Truths) |

| 01-08-07-01.txt | [10757] | [10782] | -25 lines |

#### 🟢 MINOR (1-5 line gaps, easy fix):
| File | Scholar Starts | Tibetan Starts | Issue |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| 01-02-01-05.txt | [997] | [999] | -2 lines - Belongs to previous files |
| 01-04-18-02.txt | [3888] | [3893] | -5 lines |

**Total Files with Mismatches:** 21 files require line range corrections (2 critical, 8 moderate, 11 minor)

## COMMON ISSUES IDENTIFIED

1. **Mixed Content:** Widespread - Many files combine analysis from different sections
2. **Incomplete Coverage:** Some files missing Four Pillars analysis entirely
3. **Missing Philology:** Particle analysis absent in many files
4. **Context Gaps:** Doxographical placement underdeveloped
5. **Format Inconsistencies:** Tagging style varies
6. **Line Range Mismatches:** Scholar line ranges don't match Tibetan source
