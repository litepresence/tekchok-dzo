## CRITICAL FINDINGS: WIDESPREAD MIXED CONTENT ISSUES

**Assessment Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Issue Severity:** CRITICAL - Affects ~60+ files  

### Problem Description
Systematic analysis reveals **widespread mixed content contamination** in scholar layer files. Many files contain analysis from completely different sections/chapters, with scholar files having 2-10x more lines than corresponding Tibetan sources.

### Files with MAJOR Mixed Content Issues (Scholar lines >> Tibetan lines):

| File | Scholar Lines | Tibetan Lines | Issue |
|------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 01-01-01-01.txt | 721 | 174 | Mixed content from other sections |
| 01-02-01-02.txt | 338 | 105 | Mixed content |
| 01-02-01-03.txt | 38 | 1 | Content when Tibetan has only 1 line |
| 01-02-01-04.txt | 38 | 1 | Content when Tibetan has only 1 line |
| 01-02-01-05.txt | 1917 | 425 | Major mixed content |
| 01-02-02-01.txt | 163 | 39 | Mixed content |
| 01-04-03-01.txt | 100 | 3 | Content when Tibetan has 3 lines |
| 01-04-04-01.txt | 112 | 13 | Mixed content |
| 01-04-05-01.txt | 169 | 24 | Mixed content |
| 01-04-10-01.txt | 65 | 3 | Content when Tibetan has 3 lines |
| 01-04-11-01.txt | 305 | 22 | Major mixed content |
| 01-04-12-01.txt | 1174 | 251 | Major mixed content |

### Root Cause
Previous generation process appears to have systematically included analysis from wrong sections, likely due to:
1. Line range miscalculations
2. Copy-paste errors across files
3. Section boundary confusion
4. Lack of validation against Tibetan sources

### Remediation Strategy
1. **Priority 1:** Files with >3x line count discrepancy (complete rewrite required)
2. **Priority 2:** Files with 2-3x discrepancy (major editing required)
3. **Priority 3:** Files with <2x discrepancy (review and QC)
4. **Validation:** Each rewritten file must be verified against Tibetan source line-by-line

## COMMON ISSUES IDENTIFIED

1. **Mixed Content:** Widespread - Many files combine analysis from different sections
2. **Incomplete Coverage:** Some files missing Four Pillars analysis entirely
3. **Missing Philology:** Particle analysis absent in many files
4. **Context Gaps:** Doxographical placement underdeveloped
5. **Format Inconsistencies:** Tagging style varies
6. **Line Range Mismatches:** Scholar line ranges don't match Tibetan source
