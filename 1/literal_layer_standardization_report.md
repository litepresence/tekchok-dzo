# Literal Layer Standardization Report
## Lotsawa-Grade Repair

---

## ISSUE

The literal layer was using 'basis' for the Tibetan term གཞི་ (gzhi), which contradicts:
1. The dictionary specification
2. Dzogchen doctrinal precision
3. Tibetan literal meaning

---

## LOTSAWA JUDGMENT

**Question:** Is there a valid lotsawa reason to use 'basis' in literal for gzhi?

**Answer:** NO.

**Reasoning:**
1. gzhi literally means "ground" in Tibetan
2. In Dzogchen, gzhi = primordial ground (not abstract "basis")
3. Dictionary specifies: gzhi MUST be translated as "ground"
4. No doctrinal justification exists for using "basis"

---

## ACTION TAKEN

### 1. Updated Literal Layer Prompt

Added explicit specification:
```
**gzhi:**
- **ALWAYS** translate as "ground"
- **NEVER** translate as "basis"
- Hyphenate in compounds: "ground-appearance," "ground-abiding"
```

### 2. Fixed All Literal Files

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Lines using 'basis' for gzhi | 504 | 0 |
| Lines using 'ground' for gzhi | 564 | 1068 |

### 3. Files Modified

- 213 literal files checked
- 76 files modified
- 504 lines corrected

---

## DOCTRINAL PRECISION MAINTAINED

The term gzhi (གཞི་) in Dzogchen:
- **Meaning:** Primordial ground, the ground of being
- **Translation:** ALWAYS "ground"
- **Compounds:** ground-appearance, ground-abiding, ground-path

This distinguishes it from:
- **kun gzhi (ཀུན་གཞི་):** all-ground or kunzhi
- **kun gzhi rnam shes:** kunzhi consciousness

---

## VERIFICATION

```
Total 'gzhi' occurrences: 1068
Using 'ground': 1068
Using 'basis': 0
```

**✓ ALL LITERAL LAYER 'gzhi' NOW TRANSLATED AS 'ground'**

---

## CROSS-LAYER CONSISTENCY

All layers now use consistent terminology:

| Layer | gzhi translation |
|-------|------------------|
| Literal | ground |
| Epistemic | ground |
| Delusion | ground |
| Liturgical | ground |
| Cognitive | ground |
| Dictionary | ground |
