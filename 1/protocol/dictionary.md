## CRITICAL TRANSLATION NOTE: gzhi (གཞི་)

**DOCTRINAL DISTINCTION - MUST PRESERVE**

| Tibetan | Translation | Context | NEVER Use |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| gzhi (གཞི་) | **ground** | Primordial ground, the basis of all, Dzogchen technical term | "basis" in doctrinal contexts |
| kun gzhi (ཀུན་གཞི་) | **all-ground** or **kunzhi** | The universal ground (ālaya), neutral basis of experience | "ground" alone (confuses with gzhi) |
| kun gzhi rnam shes | **kunzhi consciousness** | The defiled aspect, 8th consciousness | "ground consciousness" |

### Rule for "gzhi"

In Dzogchen doctrinal contexts, **gzhi MUST be translated as "ground"** - never "basis."

**Key phrases requiring "ground":**
- `gzhi lam 'bras bu` = **ground, path, and result** (NOT "basis, path, result")
- `'khor 'das gzhi gcig` = **samsara and nirvana are one ground**
- `ye gzhi` = **primordial ground**
- `gzhi'i ngo bo` = **ground's essence**

### Why This Matters

In Dzogchen:
- **gzhi (ground)** = the primordial ground of all phenomena, the basis-as-suchness
- **kun gzhi (all-ground)** = the universal ground as neutral container

Translating gzhi as "basis" loses this crucial distinction and confuses the Dzogchen view.

### Files Fixed

The following liturgical files were corrected to use "ground" instead of "basis":
- 01-04-14-01.txt [3612]: "basis, path, result" → "ground, path, result"
- 01-04-13-01.txt [3338]: "basis, path, and result" → "ground, path, and result"
- 01-04-19-01.txt [3997]: "basis of samsara and nirvana" → "ground of samsara and nirvana"
- 01-14-01-01.txt [17459]: "original basis" → "primordial ground"
- 02-21-01-01.txt [10136]: "base, path, fruit" → "ground, path, result"
