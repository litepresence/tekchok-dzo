# Dzogchen Precision Variations
## Commentary Layer - Phase 1 Implementation
## Priority: Metaphysical Precision > Linguistic Variety

---

## SECTION 1: GNAS PA (RESTING/ABIDING) VARIATIONS

**CORE CONCEPT:** Gnas pa - to abide, dwell, remain, settle without contrivance
**METAPHYSICAL PRECISION:** Must convey non-doing, natural presence, uncontrived awareness
**AVOID:** Any implication of effort, achievement, or manufactured state

### Tier 1: Direct Technical Terms (Highest Precision)
- Abide in recognition
- Dwell in the nature
- Remain as the display
- Settle into rigpa
- Rest without contrivance

### Tier 2: Implicit Resting (Medium Precision)
- Simply be
- Let be
- Leave as is
- Don't touch
- Natural presence
- Uncontrived awareness
- As it is

### Tier 3: Process-Oriented (Context-Dependent)
- Recognition settles
- Awareness remains
- The nature abides
- Settling occurs naturally
- Presence continues unobstructed

### Tier 4: Negative Formulation (Advanced)
- Without leaving
- Not moving from
- Unchanging amidst change
- Neither remaining nor departing
- Beyond abiding and non-abiding

**USAGE GUIDELINES:**
- Garab Dorje: Use Tier 1, stark, fragmented
- Patrul: Mix Tier 1 and 2, conversational
- Longchenpa: Tier 1-4 as appropriate to synthesis
- Technical sections: Tier 1 priority

## SECTION 2: SELF-REFERENTIAL VOICE VARIATIONS

**CORE CONCEPT:** Humility as teaching method (rang bab)
**METAPHYSICAL PRECISION:** Must embody selflessness, not mere rhetorical device
**AVOID:** Cartoonish repetition, losing authenticity

### Traditional Self-References (Authentic)
- This wanderer
- This hermit
- This practitioner
- One such as myself
- Your servant
- One without qualities

### Implicit Self-Reference (Subtle)
- Years of practice revealed...
- Sitting in retreat, I saw...
- The recognition came slowly...
- Fool that I was...
- I once believed...

### Fragmented/Direct
- This fool...
- Wandered for years...
- Learned nothing...

### Third-Person Legitimizing
- Patrul used to say...
- The Vagabond recalls...
- As the old teachers taught...

**USAGE GUIDELINES:**
- Max 2 self-references per section
- Vary within single file
- Patrul: "This wanderer" / "This fool" / "I"
- Garab Dorje: Minimal to none
- Longchenpa: "One such as I" / "This practitioner"

## SECTION 3: METAPHOR VARIATIONS

**CORE CONCEPT:** Dpe (example/comparison) as upaya
**METAPHYSICAL PRECISION:** Must point to non-dual nature, not solidify concepts
**AVOID:** Over-polished symmetry, predictable "Like X doing Y"

### Construction Variations

**Standard:**
- Like a mirror reflecting...

**Varied:**
- Awareness mirrors...
- Reflection without mirror...
- Mirror-nature of mind...
- As with a mirror...
- The way a mirror...

**Direct Appositive:**
- Awareness, mirror-like, reflects...
- Mind—empty, luminous—knows...
- Recognition, dawn-like, dispels...

**Embedded Narrative:**
- Watching water reflect clouds...
- In a mirror, face and reflection...
- Consider how a mirror...

**Without Explicit Comparison:**
- Water reflects without grasping...
- Sky holds clouds effortlessly...
- Fire burns without intention...

### Metaphor Categories by Doctrinal Function

**1. Nature Elements (High Frequency - Acceptable)**
- Water: Reflecting, flowing, wetness
- Sky/Space: Holding, accommodating, unchanging
- Fire: Illuminating, transforming, warmth
- Wind: Moving, penetrating, carrying
- Earth: Supporting, stable, holding

**2. Process Metaphors (Skillful Means)**
- Dawn/Day/Dusk: Recognition maturing
- Wave/Ocean: Individual/universal nature
- Seed/Fruit: Cause-result relationship
- Dream/Waking: Appearance-emptiness

**3. Object Metaphors (Pedagogical)**
- Mirror: Awareness reflecting
- Lamp: Self-illuminating knowing
- Crystal: Pure nature displaying colors
- Hologram: Appearance-emptiness unified

**USAGE GUIDELINES:**
- Rotate categories systematically
- Never use same metaphor within 3 sections
- Prefer natural elements over manufactured objects
- Vary construction more than content

## SECTION 4: MADHYAMAKA CONSTRUCTIONS

**CORE CONCEPT:** Madhyamaka logic - freedom from extremes
**METAPHYSICAL PRECISION:** Must convey emptiness without nihilism
**AVOID:** Mechanical "Neither X nor Y" formulas

### Standard Formulations (Use Sparingly)
- Neither existence nor non-existence
- Neither one nor many
- Neither same nor different

### Varied Formulations (Preferred)
- Beyond existence and non-existence
- Transcending both and neither
- Free from extremes of permanence and annihilation
- Not falling into existence or void
- Liberated from positions

### Process-Oriented
- Existence dissolves upon examination
- Non-existence fails to describe
- Both positions untenable
- Neither captures the nature

### Positive Formulation (Advanced)
- The middle way between... is itself empty
- Extremes dissolve in examination
- Positionless position
- Freedom from all positions

### Negative Constructions
- Not this, not that
- Without X, without Y
- Devoid of extremes
- Unmarked by distinctions

**USAGE GUIDELINES:**
- Mipham: Precise logical formulations
- Garab Dorje: Stark negation
- Longchenpa: Synthesizing all approaches
- Integrator: Spacious dissolution

## SECTION 5: SENTENCE RHYTHM VARIATIONS

**METAPHYSICAL PRECISION:** Rhythm affects cognition; vary to prevent mechanization

### Pattern Variations

**Standard AI Pattern (Reduce):**
Subject + Verb + Object + Explanation
"The aggregates are ripples on awareness. The awareness remains unchanged."

**Fragmented (Increase):**
Subject. Verb. Object.
"Aggregates. Ripples. Awareness unchanged."

**Interrogative (Strategic):**
Question + Statement
"What are aggregates? Ripples. What remains? Awareness."

**Imperative (Direct):**
Command + Context
"See aggregates as ripples. See awareness unchanged."

**Embedded (Natural):**
Context + Observation
"Watching ripples on the lake, one sees aggregates as display, awareness as water."

**Inverted (Emphasis):**
Object + Subject + Verb
"Unchanged, the awareness remains. Ripples, the aggregates appear."

## SECTION 6: AI-TELL REDUCTION CHECKLIST

### Before Publishing Any Commentary Block:
- [ ] Does "Rest in" appear more than once per voice block?
- [ ] Does "This old X" follow identical pattern?
- [ ] Are metaphors constructed "Like a [noun] [verb]ing"?
- [ ] Do Madhyamaka constructions use "Neither...nor" formula?
- [ ] Are sentences all Subject-Verb-Object?
- [ ] Is punctuation predictable (periods every 2-3 lines)?

### If YES to any:
- Vary using Section 1-5 above
- Prioritize metaphysical precision
- Maintain doctrinal terminology
- Accept awkwardness over mechanization

## SECTION 7: VOICE-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION

### Voice 01 - Garab Dorje (First Point)
**Priority:** Stark precision
**Resting:** Tier 1 only, fragmented
**Self-reference:** Minimal, "I" only if essential
**Madhyamaka:** Direct negation
**Example:** "Recognize. Rest. Return. Three words. Beyond neither."

### Voice 10 - Longchenpa (Omniscient)
**Priority:** Synthesis with precision
**Resting:** All tiers, context-appropriate
**Self-reference:** "One such as I" / "This practitioner"
**Madhyamaka:** Complete formulations
**Example:** "Abiding in the nature that neither abides nor departs..."

### Voice 13 - Patrul/Vagabond
**Priority:** Accessible precision
**Resting:** Tier 1-2, conversational
**Self-reference:** Varied, max 2 per section
**Madhyamaka:** Practical dissolution
**Example:** "This fool tried to... Finally saw: rest in what's already resting."

### Voice 14 - Mipham (Philosopher)
**Priority:** Logical precision
**Resting:** Tier 1, technical
**Self-reference:** Minimal, third-person preferred
**Madhyamaka:** Rigorous formulations
**Example:** "The gnas pa of rigpa transcends abiding and non-abiding..."
