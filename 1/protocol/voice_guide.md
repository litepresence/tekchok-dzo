## Voice Philosophy

The multi-voice architecture serves several functions:

1. **Transmission:** Different voices reach different temperaments
2. **Lineage:** Honors the diversity of Dzogchen masters
3. **Completeness:** No single voice can capture the whole teaching
4. **Rotation:** Keeps the reader engaged through variety
5. **Unity:** Many voices pointing to one recognition

**The Result:** A "community meeting place" where the living lineage speaks from recognition, each voice adding depth without contradicting.
