## PHASE 2: FINGER POINTING METAPHOR REPLACEMENTS

### Why Replace "Finger Pointing"?
The "finger pointing at the moon" metaphor appears **403 times** across the commentary layer. While doctrinally sound (from the Lankavatara Sutra), the repetition becomes mechanical and contributes to AI-tell signals. Below are fresh alternatives that maintain the same teaching function.

### Teaching Function
The metaphor conveys: "The teaching indicates reality but is not reality itself. Don't mistake the indication for the indicated."

### CATEGORY 1: Himalayan/Nomadic Alternatives

**1. Bird Calling at Dawn**
- "Like a cuckoo's call—you hear it, but the call is not the spring."
- "The bird calls, you turn to look. The call is not the bird, the looking is not the sound."

**2. Smoke Rising from Valley**
- "Smoke rising from a distant valley—you see the sign but the smoke is not the fire."
- "Where there's smoke, there's fire, but the smoke is not what warms you."

**3. Footprints on a Trail**
- "Footprints in snow—you follow them, but the prints are not the destination."

- "Clouds pass through sky—the shapes are not the space."
- "White against blue, changing constantly. The change points to stillness."

**17. Rivers and Ocean**
- "A river flows to sea—the current is not the water's nature."
- "Waves rise and fall—the rising points to falling, both point to water."

**18. Seeds and Sprouting**

- "Calling it 'awareness'—the label is not what is labeled."

**29. Memory and Experience**
- "You remember yesterday—the memory is not the day."
- "Recollection points to experience, but is not the experiencing."

### IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**Replacement Strategy:**
1. **Keep 5%** of original "finger pointing" metaphors for doctrinal continuity
2. **Rotate categories** - don't use same category twice in succession  
3. **Match to voice**:
   - Himalayan voices: Use Categories 1, 3 (nomadic, natural)
   - Monastic voices: Use Categories 2, 4 (domestic, practice)
   - Abstract voices: Use Category 5 (direct, philosophical)

**Voice-Specific Preferences:**
- **First Point/Garab Dorje**: Category 3 (Lightning, shadows) - stark, immediate
- **Patrul/Vagabond**: Category 1 (Footprints, smoke) - earthy, experiential
- **Systematizer**: Category 5 (Map, signpost) - precise, analytical
- **Lotus-Born**: Category 3 (Rainbow, clouds) - visionary, spacious
- **Consort**: Category 4 (Breath, visualization) - intimate, subtle
- **Lion-Faced**: Category 1 (Echo, stars) - fierce, dramatic

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] No more than 1 finger metaphor per 20 blocks
- [ ] At least 3 different categories used per chapter
- [ ] Matches voice archetype
- [ ] Maintains doctrinal precision (indication ≠ indicated)

## PHASE 2: VOICE SIGNATURE VARIATIONS

### Current Patterns (Overused)

**Garab Dorje/First Point: "Three words" (281 occurrences)**
Problem: Mechanical repetition of "Three words. [X]. [Y]. [Z]."

**Patrul/Vagabond: "This old" (363 occurrences)**  
Problem: Always "This old fool/vagabond/wanderer..."

**Systematizer: "Thus" (26 occurrences)**
Status: Acceptable - already varied

### VARIATION SET 3: Sentence Length Variation

**Current Problem**: Many blocks are exactly 20 lines (mechanical)

**Solution**: Vary block length intentionally

**Garab Dorje**: 3-8 lines (staccato, minimal)
**Patrul**: 12-25 lines (storytelling range)
**Systematizer**: 15-30 lines (elaboration needed)
**Integrator**: 18-28 lines (spacious, flowing)
**Lotus-Born**: 10-22 lines (poetic, variable)
**Consort**: 12-20 lines (intimate, concise)

**Implementation:**
- Target: No more than 3 blocks of same length in succession
- Vary by ±5 lines from current average
- Shorter blocks for impact (First Point, Lion-Faced)
- Longer blocks for development (Systematizer, Integrator)
