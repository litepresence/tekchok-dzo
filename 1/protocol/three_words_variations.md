# Three Words Variation Guide
# Reducing AI-tells while preserving Garab Dorje's teaching
# 
# CORE TEACHING: Recognition, Rest, Return (rtogs, gnas, slar log)
# 
# VOICE-SPECIFIC EXPRESSIONS:
#
# VOICE 01 - Garab Dorje (First Point): Keep stark "Three words. X. Y. Z."
# - Authentic to character
# - Staccato, fragmented
# - Example: "Three words. Recognize. Rest. Return."
#
# VOICE 02 - Systematizer: Analytical variation
# - "The threefold structure..."
# - "Triadic schema: recognition, resting, restoration"
# - "Three aspects of single practice..."
#
# VOICE 03 - Integrator: Flowing, spacious
# - "Recognition, rest, and return—three waves, one ocean"
# - "Like dawn, day, and dusk—appear separate, all light"
# - "Three descriptions of what has no parts"
#
# VOICE 06 - Lotus-Born: Visionary, poetic
# - "Three jewels of pointing..."
# - "Recognition as lightning, rest as sky, return as storm"
# - "Three words my teacher whispered..."
#
# VOICE 10 - Longchenpa (Omniscient): Synthesizing
# - "Recognition, rest, return—three words containing the treasury"
# - "The First Point distilled..."
# - "Three gates to what has no entrance"
#
# VOICE 13 - Patrul/Vagabond: Conversational, self-deprecating
# - "Three words, yeah? Recognize, rest, return. Though I often forget the third."
# - "They say three things..."
# - "Recognition, rest, return—or as I call it, see, stay, remember"
# - "Three words my teacher gave me before he left. That's all."
#
# VOICE 14 - Mipham/Philosopher: Logical precision
# - "Triadic structure: initial recognition, continuous resting, repeated restoration"
# - "Threefold method: rtogs, gnas, slar log"
# - "Recognition, rest, return—not sequential but simultaneous aspects"
#
# GENERAL VARIATIONS (for any voice):
# 1. Embedded in sentence: "The three words—recognize, rest, return—point to..."
# 2. Interrupted: "Three words... uh... recognize, yeah, and rest. The third?"
# 3. Questioning: "Three words? Or maybe just one: Abide."
# 4. Shortened: "Recognize. Rest. Return."
# 5. Expanded: "Recognition dawns, resting occurs, returning happens"
# 6. Subverted: "They say three. I say the third is just the first again."
# 7. Omitted entirely: Just teach without the formula
#
# FREQUENCY RULES:
# - Max 1 explicit "Three words" per file for non-Garab Dorje voices
# - Garab Dorje can use up to 2 per file (authentic to character)
# - Vary expressions dramatically between files
# - Sometimes skip entirely—let the teaching stand without formula
#
# HUMAN MESSINESS TO ADD:
# - Self-corrections: "Three words... no, four..."
# - Dialect: "Three words, yeah?"
# - Interruptions: "Three—wait, what was I saying?"
# - Colloquialisms: "Three things..."
# - Fragments: "Three words. Recognize. The rest follows."
