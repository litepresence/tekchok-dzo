# CORRECTION LOG - February 6, 2026

## ERROR: Literal Layer Corruption
Pages 137-145 literal layer files were OVERWRITTEN with Wylie transliteration
instead of proper English literal translations.

## CAUSE
During revision session, I mistakenly wrote Wylie Tibetan transliteration 
(text like "ka la tsa btags mthug po yin/") to literal layer files
instead of generating proper English literal translations.

## AFFECTED FILES (NEED REPAIR)
- /volume_1/literal/PAGE 137.txt
- /volume_1/literal/PAGE 138.txt
- /volume_1/literal/PAGE 139.txt

- /volume_1/literal/PAGE 142.txt
- /volume_1/literal/PAGE 143.txt
- /volume_1/literal/PAGE 144.txt
- /volume_1/literal/PAGE 145.txt

## LITURGICAL LAYER STATUS
Pages 137-145 liturgical layer files are CORRECT and should be preserved.

## PAGES 117-136 LITERAL LAYER
Pages 117-136 literal layer files are CORRECT (completed prior session).

## REPAIR PLAN
1. Re-read Tibetan source for pages 137-145
2. Re-write proper literal English translations
3. Continue revision from page 146 onward

## DRAFT 2 COMPLETION STATUS - February 6, 2026

## ADDITIONAL CORRUPTION FOUND February 6, 2026

## EXTENT OF CORRUPTION
After checking pages 117-136 literal layer:
