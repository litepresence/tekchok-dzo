## Editorial Conventions for Khenpo-Standard Translation

### ROOT PRINCIPLE (unchanged)
The dgongs pa of the root text is sovereign. Conventions serve transmission. When convention obscures dgongs pa, abandon convention without hesitation.






### CRITICAL REFINEMENTS FOR HUMAN VOICE

**Commentary must breathe like human cognition:**
- Vary sentence length organically—some short, some flowing. Avoid uniform density.
- Permit asymmetry: not every phrase requires immediate negation or qualification. Let some statements stand in their simplicity before the collapse reveals itself.
- Ground imagery in the stanza's specific content rather than defaulting to abstract formulae ("no X where no Xer stands").
- Allow subtle perspective shifts within a single paragraph—human thought moves laterally, not just vertically toward collapse.
- Trust the reader: avoid over-explaining the collapse. Point once with precision; let recognition arise in the interval.

**Eliminate AI-signatures:**
- Never use triplet constructions ("X Xing without Xer") as structural templates.
- Avoid mechanical parallelism across stanzas. Each commentary must arise freshly from its stanza's mtshan nyid.
- Replace formulaic openings with direct entry into the stanza's characteristic.
- Permit occasional "imperfect" phrasing that reflects genuine cognition rather than algorithmic optimization.
- Never describe the mechanism of collapse ("where no division stood"). Enact it through phrasing that itself collapses subject-object in the reader's immediate experience.

**Test for human voice:**
Before finalizing commentary, read aloud. If any phrase sounds like it could be generated by pattern-matching rather than recognition, discard and recompose from rest.

### LITURGICAL LAYER (enhanced precision)

9–12 syllables per line is necessary but insufficient. Each line must:
- Contain one natural caesura (mid-line breath) except at doctrinal pivots
- Avoid end-stopped rigidity—let meaning flow across line breaks where Longchenpa's syntax demands
- Render shugs kyis as "by force" without softening. Recognition's violence is precise, not gentle.
- Never sacrifice dgongs pa for meter. Better 13 syllables with intact meaning than 12 with reification.

### LITERAL LAYER (particle precision non-negotiable)

gzhig → causal connector ("gzhig ste"), never imperative  
kyis → instrumental ("by means of"), never ablative  
las → ablative ("from"), never instrumental  
'du → "gather," never "accumulate" (implies prior scattering)  
skad cig → "immediate," never "instant" (reifies duration)  

Hyphenated stacking must preserve Tibetan syntax without English reordering. Never sacrifice particle function for fluency.

### METAPHYSICAL PRECISION (strengthened)

ka dag → "never established as impure or pure" (not primordial purity as attribute)  
lhun grub → "self-arising without cause, self-abiding without support" (not spontaneity)  
shugs kyis → "by force" (recognition's precision tearing illusion's fabric—never "spontaneously")  
rig pa → "awareness recognizing itself" (never "consciousness")  

Never lexicalize these terms as nouns. Render their inseparability through phrasing alone.

### PEDAGOGICAL GRADATION (honoring Longchenpa's movement)

Praise stanzas (1–20): Commentary points to qualities without collapsing prematurely into ultimate view. Honor the display.  
Transmission stanzas (21–40): Commentary enacts recognition's immediacy where Longchenpa emphasizes direct introduction.  
Obstacle stanzas (41–60): Commentary shows transformation without reifying obstacles as substantial.  
Aspiration stanzas (61–67): Commentary dissolves aspiration into fulfillment without constructing hope as path.

### WORKING METHOD (essential refinement)

1. Read Tibetan aloud three times without conceptualizing  
2. Rest in resonance until meaning arises without effort  
3. **Compose commentary first** from that rest—before liturgical or literal layers  
4. Verify literal against Wylie particles  
5. Compose liturgical from commentary's resonance, not from literal  
6. Read entire stanza aloud. If any register sounds like it could be generated without resting in dgongs pa, return to step 1  

**Critical test:** Does the commentary arise from recognition or from technique? If technique, discard.

### SINGLE CRITERION (unchanged but emphasized)

Before finalizing any phrase, rest in recognition without conceptual elaboration. Then test:

Does this phrase collapse subject-object architecture in the reader's immediate experience?  
Or does it merely describe such collapse?

If the former: liberation.  
If the latter: instruction without transmission.

Words either liberate  
or they do not liberate.  
There is no third possibility.

Thus refined. May the dgongs pa of Longchenpa remain uncorrupted.  
Virtue.
