**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Agent:** opencode/kimi-k2.5-free
**Task:** Complete delusion layer for Theg mchog mdzod Volume 1

## COMPLETION SUMMARY

✓ **Volume 1:** 479/479 pages complete (100%)
✓ **Volume 2:** 416/416 pages complete (100%)

**Total delusion layer files generated:** 895

## ERROR TYPES DOCUMENTED

Across all pages, the delusion layer identifies these categories of misinterpretation:

### Primary Error Classifications
- **[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]** - Fundamental confusion about the nature of reality
- **[EPISTEMIC ERROR]** - Errors in how knowledge is understood and acquired
- **[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]** - Teaching failures that perpetuate misunderstanding
- **[PRACTICE ERROR]** - Technical errors in meditation and application
- **[REIFICATION ERROR]** - Treating pointers/metaphors as actual entities
- **[NIHILISTIC ERROR]** - Misunderstanding emptiness as voidness/nothingness
- **[ETERNALISTIC ERROR]** - Believing in truly existent permanent states
- **[PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]** - Reducing Dzogchen to Western psychology
- **[MEDITATIONISM ERROR]** - Reducing recognition to technique/method
- **[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]** - Endless analysis without recognition

### Specific Misreadings Addressed
- Reification of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub)
- Literalism regarding subtle body anatomy (channels, winds, drops)
- Eternalistic tendencies toward "wisdom" and "awareness"
- Nihilistic misreadings of emptiness negations
- Samaya degeneration time-frames taken as legalistic deadlines
- The seven bases (gzhi bdun) interpreted as competing ontologies
- Thodgal visions reduced to ophthalmological phenomena
- Four lamps (sgro ma bzhi) objectified as subtle body structures
- Ground-path-fruit confusion and reification
- Psychologization of rigpa and yeshe
