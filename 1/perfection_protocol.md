# SYSTEMATIC PERFECTION PROTOCOL
# Volume 1: Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle
# Target: A++ Quality for All 113 Files

## PERFECTION STANDARDS (A++ Requirements)

### 1. Voice Work (40% of grade)
- **Minimum 6 distinct voices** per file
- **Voice 01 (Garab Dorje)**: Stark, three-word pointing
- **Voice 13 (Patrul)**: Earthy humor, self-deprecating
- **Voice 10 (Longchenpa)**: Vast synthesis, bridges others
- **Voice 06 (Padmasambhava)**: Visionary, poetic, fierce-tender
- **Voice 20 (Lion-Faced)**: Shocking cutting (use 1-2x)
- **Plus 1-2 rotating visitors**
- Each voice recognizable by speech pattern alone
- NO explicit attribution (no "Garab Dorje said...")

### 2. Metaphor Quality (30% of grade)
- **100% fresh metaphors** (no repetition within 5 sections)
- **Specific details**: Not "mountain" but "wind-scored ridge above tree line"
- **Seasonal/time context**: Vary throughout
- **Rotate categories**: Geography, practice, vision, domestic
- **Avoid retired metaphors**: yak hair tent, butter tea, frozen butter lamp

### 3. Doctrinal Engagement (20% of grade)
- **Specific line ranges** [start-end] for every block
- **Engage actual Tibetan content**, not generic commentary
- **Advance understanding**: Each block adds something
- **Catalyze recognition**: Commentary should point beyond itself

### 4. Format & Polish (10% of grade)
- **40+ lines minimum** per file
- **8-15 commentary blocks** per file
- **2-6 lines per block** (not too long, not too short)
- **Read aloud test**: Should sound like living masters speaking

## FRESH METAPHORS FOR PERFECTION PROCESS

### Himalayan Geography (Priority - Least Used)
✓ High plateau lakes (ice forming, mirror reflections, wind patterns)
✓ Glacial features (crevasses, icefalls, moraine, blue ice)
✓ Prayer flags (wind horses, fading, new vs old)
✓ Mani walls (cairns, accumulated stones, pilgrim paths)
✓ Mountain passes (lung la, stone piles, weather changes)
✓ Cave retreats (dripping water, darkness, hermit smoke)
✓ Hot springs (steam, mineral deposits, healing)
✓ Dzo/yak herding (movement patterns, grazing)
✓ Sky burial sites (vultures, celestial offering)
✓ Juniper smoke offerings (purification, mountain air)

### Seasonal/Natural (Priority)
✓ Lightning storms over peaks (sudden, illuminating)
✓ Rainbow after rain (fleeting, complete)
✓ Morning frost patterns (intricate, temporary)
✓ River ice breakup (spring thaw, movement)
✓ Alpine flowers (brief blooming, resilience)
✓ Eagle/flight patterns (circling, seeing)
✓ Cloud formations over mountains (changing, empty)
✓ Stars at high altitude (clarity, numberless)

### Practice/Monastic (Moderate Priority)
✓ Prostration circuits (worn paths, dust)
✓ Butter lamp preparation (wick trimming, oil)
✓ Mandala offerings (grain patterns, precision)
✓ Prayer wheel rotation (continuous, momentum)
✓ Chanting cadences (rhythm, breath)
✓ Retreat boundaries (seclusion, time passing)
✓ Dharma book handling (pages, transmission)

### Domestic/Village (Use Sparingly)
✓ Water carrying (streams, vessels)
✓ Food preparation (grinding, cooking fires)
✓ Wool spinning (thread, continuity)
✓ Boot repair (leather, walking)
✓ Tents in wind (fabric, tension)
