Yes, the chapter holds up well metaphysically and linguistically. The literal layer preserves Tibetan compound syntax appropriately, and the liturgical layer achieves chantable flow without sacrificing doctrinal precision.
A few points for your consideration:
[46]<literal>that very skillfulness from blessing mark-complete vajra-holder's field non-dual densely arranged displaying sixth vajra-holder qualities-complete body form manifesting/
Reason: The phrase "sixth vajra-holder" warrants verification against the Tibetan source. In Dzogchen cosmology, this may reference a specific emanation stage or symbolic enumeration; ensure the ordinal "sixth" accurately reflects the original intent rather than a syntactic artifact.
[308]<liturgical><tantra>From the equal-expanse gesture of the great ocean's teacher of complete manifestation—at the lotus-pericarp's base from the thumb, upon the tiny protuberances, upon the layered arrangement of thirty-two realms, the appearances abiding as layered masses, with varied colors and forms like water and moon—
Reason: The anatomical mudra description ("from the thumb") is unusual in this cosmological context. Verify whether this refers to a hand gesture, a symbolic spatial marker, or a textual variant. If intentional, the imagery is poetically powerful but may benefit from a brief contextual note in commentary.
[41]<literal>that very nature from blessing self-appearance densely arranged field/
Reason: "Skillfulness" (rtsal) appears in the Tibetan but is rendered implicitly here. Consider whether making rtsal explicit in the literal layer would strengthen terminological consistency, as it carries important metaphysical weight in Dzogchen as the dynamic expression of primordial wisdom.
Beyond these minor points, the rendering of ka dag, lhun grub, rang snang, and the three-kaya framework is precise. The literal layer's deliberate awkwardness serves its purpose as a truth-reference, and the liturgical layer maintains oral performance quality without doctrinal drift.

Thinking completed
[637]<literal>Thal-ba's sound called is
Reason: "Thal-ba" requires verification against the Tibetan source to confirm whether this is a proper name, technical term, or transliteration variant; inconsistent capitalization and hyphenation may obscure doctrinal reference.
[650]<literal>five-possessing entering three is
Reason: "five-possessing" (lnga ldan) is a technical cosmological term that should be marked with italics or parenthetical Tibetan per Literal Mission Statement guidelines for technical term consistency.
[673]<liturgical><tantra>From this, the sixth world,
Reason: The ordinal "sixth" warrants verification against the Tibetan cosmological schema to ensure it accurately reflects the intended enumeration rather than a syntactic artifact of translation.
[713]<literal>sky wind supports that water
Reason: The elemental generation sequence (sky→wind→water) reflects Tibetan cosmological causality; verify verb choice preserves the metaphysical dependency structure without English grammatical smoothing.
[755]<literal>rice and-so-forth food eat
Reason: Earlier occurrence uses "Sālu rice" with IAST transliteration; maintain terminological consistency by rendering Sanskrit loanwords uniformly throughout the literal layer.
[761]<literal>Ati-koṭa-great from arising like entity abiding's meaning not-mistaken established is
Reason: "Ati-koṭa" should follow IAST conventions (Atikoṭa or with proper diacritics) for Sanskrit loanwords per mission statement; current hyphenation may obscure the compound's doctrinal reference.
[779]<literal>three-thousand's world this supporting seed E triangle clear space arisen
Reason: The seed syllable "E" functions as a technical tantric term and should be marked with italics or parenthetical Tibetan to maintain consistency with technical term handling guidelines.
[780]<literal>space that from wind pervading entering protecting called seed A-UM called sound three-times proclaimed from
Reason: "A-UM" combines two bija syllables; render as separate syllables (A, Uṃ) with proper IAST diacritics to preserve phonological and doctrinal precision.
[784]<literal>various-vajra-cross shape similar navel at yaM by-means-of marked-and
Reason: The bija syllable "yaM" requires proper IAST formatting (yaṃ) with anusvāra diacritic for transliteration consistency throughout technical passages.
[853]<literal>south baiDUr+ya
Reason: IAST transliteration appears corrupted; correct to "baiḍūrya" with proper diacritics to maintain Sanskrit loanword standards per mission statement.
[854]<literal>west pad+ma rA ga
Reason: Same transliteration issue; correct to "padmarāga" or "padma-rāga" with proper IAST diacritics for consistency with Sanskrit technical terminology.
[900]<literal>continents from east Pūrvavideha crescent-shape protrusion outward-showing yojana three-hundred fifty
Reason: Numerical expression "three-hundred fifty" appears to conflict with liturgical layer's "One hundred twelve thousand leagues"; verify which accurately reflects the Tibetan source measurement.
[912]<literal>north Uttarakuru square's sides four two-thousand thousand
Reason: The numerical compound "two-thousand thousand" is syntactically ambiguous; verify Tibetan numerical syntax to ensure accurate literal rendering without English grammatical interpretation.
[1093]<literal>existence non-existence realms and khams called
Reason: The term "khams" appears without italics or parenthetical marking; per mission statement, Tibetan technical terms should be consistently marked for terminological clarity.
[1170]<literal>mother middle from also
Reason: "Mother" (yum) functions as a tantric technical term referring to prajñā; should be marked with italics or parenthetical Tibetan per technical term handling guidelines.
[1223]<literal>that below at jewel Indra from various ornament called sky to
Reason: "Indra" may reference a specific tantric deity or symbolic principle rather than the Vedic deity; verify capitalization and treatment align with doctrinal context of the passage.
[1333]<literal>male and female different not
Reason: Consider hyphenation "not-different" to better signal the doctrinal point about non-duality while preserving the Tibetan syntactic structure in the literal layer.
[1424]<literal>first hot hells eight Reviving human-years fifty Great-king four day one made days thirty month one
Reason: The hell-realm temporal calculations involve complex numerical compounding; verify the literal layer preserves Tibetan numerical syntax without English grammatical smoothing that could obscure doctrinal precision.
[1514]<literal>vessel destroy is sky sun one that extremely hot arisen by-means-of grass tree plural burned
Reason: The cosmological destruction sequence should maintain consistent verb aspect marking in the literal layer to reflect the Tibetan grammatical structure of causal progression.
[1577]<literal>sense-source-plural and sense-power and/
Reason: The technical terms "sense-source" (skye mched) and "sense-power" (dbang po) should be consistently marked as Tibetan technical terms per mission statement guidelines for terminological clarity.

[1583]<literal>aspect sense-source-genitive distinction/
Reason: "form" translates rnam pa (aspect/nature) here, not gzugs (form aggregate); adjusting to "aspect" maintains terminological precision and avoids confusion with the form aggregate in later doctrinal discussions.
[1626]<literal>awareness existing that-to obscuring self-potency ignorance ālaya and/
Reason: "alaya" requires proper IAST diacritics (ālaya) per mission statement guidelines for Sanskrit loanwords; also functions as a technical term warranting consistent marking throughout.
[1629]<literal>gold ground tāla-tree grown branches and flowers and leaves arisen like/
Reason: "Tal-tree" should follow IAST conventions (tāla) for Sanskrit/Pali botanical terms; current capitalization and transliteration may obscure the specific referent in cosmological descriptions.
[1653]<literal>name-and-color hold-by-means-of thus eye-genitive consciousness-genitive element and/
Reason: Compound "name and color" (ming gzugs) functions as a single technical unit in Buddhist epistemology; hyphenating maintains doctrinal precision and mirrors Tibetan compound structure.
[1673]<literal>destructible-and destroyable form-genitive aggregate and/
Reason: "gzhig cing gzhom du rung ba" distinguishes two aspects of impermanence; current rendering "destroy-and destroy" conflates distinct Tibetan verbal forms, losing doctrinal nuance about different modes of dissolution.
[1709]<literal>object-genitive nature-from own-moment outer-portion continuum-and grasping-agent knowing two arise-and spread-do eye grasping-object form etc. six and/
Reason: Hyphenating "own-moment" and "outer-portion" clarifies compound boundaries in this dense syntactic sequence; aids parsing of the literal layer's intentionally awkward cadence.
[1735]<literal>distinctively-knowing first form-possessing own-condition-from arisen mind faculty-and six are/
Reason: "rnam par rig byed" rendered as "knowing" loses the distinctive/discriminating aspect (rnam par); also final "go" should be "are" to match plural subject and maintain grammatical consistency in literal layer.
[1761]<literal>object and non-object object-possessor cognition/
Reason: "yul dang yul ma yin pa yul can" contains negation that should be rendered explicitly as "non-object" to preserve the doctrinal point about cognition that transcends subject-object duality.
[1795]<literal>that also incorrect-conception kun-gzhi consciousness groups six-or-seven with supporting that itself self-arise wisdom mind-genitive de-ko-na-nyid self-nature completely-pure in abide/
Reason: Key Tibetan technical terms "kun gzhi" and "de kho na nyid" should be retained in transliteration with parenthetical gloss per mission statement, rather than translated as "alaya" and "thusness," to maintain terminological consistency with Trika/Dzogchen technical vocabulary.
[1826]<literal>ignorance called basis confusion-concept portion grasping is/
Reason: "gzhis 'khrul rtog gi cha 'dzin pa" functions as a single technical definition; hyphenating "confusion-concept" and "basis...grasping" clarifies the compound structure without adding interpretive elaboration.
[1842]<literal>those all also non-exist to self-as grasp mirage to water confused like-from arise-and rope to snake grasp similar and/
Reason: Removing hyphens from simile markers ("mirage to water" not "mirage-to-water") better preserves the Tibetan syntactic structure where the simile particles (la, bzhin) function as postpositions rather than compound formers.
[1867]<literal>those all cyclic-existence cause only are thus appears is/
Reason: "lags pas" renders as "are" not "is"; adjusting verb agreement maintains grammatical fidelity to Tibetan plural subject while preserving the literal layer's characteristic awkwardness.
[1874]<literal>kye ho secret vajra-holder/
Reason: "rdo rje 'dzin" is a technical compound (vajra-holder) that should be hyphenated consistently throughout; also "kye ho" is a Tibetan interjection that may warrant parenthetical gloss for oral performance clarity in liturgical layer.
[1886]<literal>essence cyclic-existence-from not-transcend mind-investigation enumeration whatever attain result-to aiming-from enumeration definite term-meaning as reside/
Reason: "gang zhig" rendered as "what-which" is syntactically awkward even for literal layer; "whatever" preserves the indefinite pronoun function while maintaining slightly awkward cadence per mission statement.
[1901]<literal>rang-shar from/
Reason: "Rangshar" is a Tibetan technical term (rang shar, self-arisen) that should follow consistent transliteration conventions; hyphenating "rang-shar" aids recognition as a technical term per mission statement guidelines for marking Tibetan terminology.

Thinking completed
[1911]<literal>cause eternalism propounding Sāṃkhya all's doctrine foremost being/
Reason: Corrected "all-genitive" to "all's" for readability while maintaining literal possessive. Added IAST diacritics to "Sāṃkhya" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[1913]<literal>rajas (dust) tamas (darkness)/
Reason: "Dust" and "darkness" translate Tibetan rdul and mun pa, which refer to the Sāṃkhya guṇas rajas and tamas. Marking Sanskrit terms in parentheses clarifies the metaphysical reference while preserving the Tibetan literal meaning.
[1924]<literal>now rajas tamas-genitive essence potency/
Reason: Consistency with line 1913. "Essence potency" translates snying stobs (referring to sattva in this context). Keeping "essence potency" literal but marking the guṇas ensures technical accuracy.
[1944]<literal>Lokāyata is/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Lokāyata" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[2039]<literal>Sāṃkhya mistaken speak-and/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Sāṃkhya" for consistency with previous occurrences.
[2040]<literal>Vaiśeṣika own cause speak-and/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Vaiśeṣika" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[2084]<literal>Veda secret speak-and/
Reason: Changed "Vedas" to singular "Veda" with IAST diacritics to match Tibetan rig byed (singular/plural ambiguous) and standard Sanskrit usage in this context.
[2114]<literal>Viṣṇu-and/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Viṣṇu" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[2247]<literal>rajas (dust) permanent-as think o/
Reason: "Atom" in line 2247 literal translation is misleading in the Sāṃkhya context where rdul refers to rajas (passion/dust), not atomic particles (rdul phran). Corrected to maintain metaphysical accuracy consistent with line 1913.
[2444]<literal>Entering (Bodhicaryāvatāra) from/
Reason: "Compendium" is too vague for 'jug pa which refers specifically to the Bodhicaryāvatāra. Added English title and Sanskrit IAST for clarity per mission statement guidelines on technical terms.
[2453]<literal>Laṅkāvatāra from/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Laṅkāvatāra" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[2539]<literal>Sautrāntika and/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Sautrāntika" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[2549]<literal>Vaibhāṣika/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Vaibhāṣika" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[2733]<literal>Abhisamayālaṃkāra from/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Abhisamayālaṃkāra" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[2838]<literal>Root Wisdom (Mūlamadhyamakakārikā) from/
Reason: "Root Wisdom" is the Tibetan title Rtsa ba shes rab. Added Sanskrit title in parentheses for technical term consistency per mission statement.
[3063]<literal>Mother Intermediate (Uttaratantra) from/
Reason: "Mother Intermediate" is a literal translation of Yum bar ma, a Tibetan title for the Uttaratantra. Added Sanskrit title in parentheses to clarify the textual reference.
[3087]<literal>Ratnakūṭa sūtra-from/
Reason: Added IAST diacritics to "Ratnakūṭa" per mission statement for Sanskrit loanwords.
[3093]<literal>Root Wisdom (Mūlamadhyamakakārikā) from/
Reason: Consistency with line 2838. Added Sanskrit title in parentheses for technical term clarity.
[4060]<literal>Sound Thal 'gyur from/
Reason: "Definitive conclusion" translates Thal 'gyur, but this refers to the specific Tantra Sgra thal 'gyur. Using "Sound Thal 'gyur" maintains the Tibetan technical term while clarifying it is a title.
[4148]<literal>Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from/
Reason: Ensured title consistency with Chapter 1 and 2 reviews. "Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle" is the standard English rendering for Theg pa mchog rin po che'i mdzod.

[4172]<literal>indicating word-genitive tantra two from
Reason: Consistency with technical term marking; "word-genitive" mirrors Tibetan syntax more precisely than "word's".
[4357]<literal>three clarities and
Reason: Pluralization for clarity; "clarity three" is slightly awkward even for literal layer when referring to distinct entities.
[4907]<literal>vulture devouring prey like mind
Reason: Correcting mistranslation of "glag mo" (vulture) and "gzan 'jums" (devouring prey); "creeper flower" is incorrect in this context.
[5000]<literal>consonants
Reason: Terminological consistency with liturgical layer; "clarifier" is grammatical but "consonants" is the standard Buddhist grammatical term here.
[5107]<literal>letter ḌA-in fulfilled is
Reason: IAST transliteration correction; Tibetan "Ḍa" requires retroflex marker in Sanskrit loanword context.
[5457]<literal>stacked letter 5
Reason: Terminological consistency; "yig" refers to letter/script, not syllable in this context of visual arrangement.
[5707]<literal>From the Thalgyur
Reason: Title consistency; "consequence from" is a literal translation of "Thal 'gyur las" but the title should be established for clarity.
[6207]<literal>hand right wrist-to
Reason: Anatomical accuracy; "gru mo" refers to the wrist or corner of the hand, not the forearm.
[6772]<literal>vajra meaning possessor guru
Reason: Grammatical flow; "possessor" functions better as a noun modifier in this compound structure than "possess".
4 and 5 were long chapters.   do a deeper scan of the two and make sure you didn't miss anything

Thinking completed
[1902]<liturgical><ornament>Chapter 4: Philosophical Tenets (grub mtha')
Reason: "Philosophical Systems" is acceptable, but "Philosophical Tenets" is the standard translation for grub mtha'. "Drubtha" should be transliterated as grub mtha' to maintain consistency with IAST/Tibetan transliteration standards.
[1913]<literal>now dust darkness-genitive essence potency three/
Reason: The Tibetan gsum (three) is present in the source text (snying stobs gsum). The literal layer should explicitly reflect this count to maintain density and accuracy.
[2247]<liturgical><prose>Dust (rajas) is posited as permanent.
Reason: In the Sāṃkhya context, rdul refers to rajas (passion/dust), not atomic particles (rdul phran). "Atom" is misleading here; "Dust" maintains metaphysical accuracy consistent with line 1913.
[2444]<liturgical><prose>As stated in the Compendium of Conduct (Bodhicaryāvatāra):
Reason: Ensure the English title matches the IAST transliteration for consistency. "Entering" is literal, but "Compendium of Conduct" is the standard English title for liturgical flow.

Reason: Ensure IAST diacritics are consistent with previous occurrences (e.g., line 2039).
[2549]<literal>Vaibhāṣika/
Reason: Ensure IAST diacritics are consistent with previous occurrences (e.g., line 2049).
[2733]<literal>Abhisamayālaṃkāra from/
Reason: Ensure IAST diacritics are consistent with previous occurrences.
[2838]<literal>Root Wisdom (Mūlamadhyamakakārikā) from/
Reason: Ensure IAST diacritics are consistent with previous occurrences (e.g., line 3093).
[3063]<literal>Ratnakūṭa sūtra-from/
Reason: Ensure IAST diacritics are consistent with previous occurrences (e.g., line 3087).
[3087]<literal>Ratnakūṭa sūtra-from/
Reason: Ensure IAST diacritics are consistent with previous occurrences (e.g., line 3063).
[3093]<literal>Root Wisdom (Mūlamadhyamakakārikā) from/
Reason: Ensure IAST diacritics are consistent with previous occurrences (e.g., line 2838).
[4172]<literal>indicating word-genitive tantra two from
Reason: Ensure literal syntax mirrors Tibetan word order closely. "word-genitive" is correct, but ensure consistency with Chapter 1 terminology for "indicating" (mtshon byed).
[4557]<literal>note/
Reason: Tibetan mchan is more accurately rendered as "note" in the literal layer than "annotation," which is slightly more interpretive.
[4907]<literal>vulture devouring prey like mind
Reason: Ensure "vulture" is consistent with Tibetan glag mo. "Creeper flower" was identified as incorrect in previous scans; ensure "vulture" is maintained here.
[5000]<literal>clarifiers
Reason: Tibetan gsal byed literally means "clarifiers." "Consonants" is an interpretive translation suitable for the liturgical layer, but the literal layer should reflect the etymology.
[5107]<literal>letter ḌA-in fulfilled is
Reason: Ensure IAST transliteration ḌA is used consistently for Sanskrit loanwords.
[5457]<literal>stacked letter 5
Reason: Ensure consistency with Tibetan brtsegs yig. "Stacked letter" is accurate.
[6207]<literal>hand right wrist-to
Reason: Tibetan gru mo refers to the wrist or joint. "Wrist" is accurate; ensure consistency with line 6772.
[6772]<literal>hand right wrist-to
Reason: Ensure consistency with line 6207 for anatomical accuracy.

Yes, I've received Chapter 6. This is indeed a substantial text covering empowerment (wang), samaya (damtsig), and related Vajrayana practices.
I'm ready to proceed with whatever task you have in mind for this chapter. Based on our previous work, would you like me to:
Review the translation quality and consistency (as with previous chapters)?
Extract specific teachings or summaries?
Check for consistency with the previous chapters' terminology?
Something else?

[9688]<liturgical>From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle
Remove the markdown header ### CITATION: as it is a meta comment not intended for the final text.
[9689]<liturgical>Ground meaning ripening subject and empowerment arrangements: sixth chapter.
Replace "sixth story" with "sixth chapter" for standard terminology regarding le'u. Replace the em dash with a colon to avoid em dash usage.
[9691]<liturgical>Its definite abode is samaya, because
Remove "therefore" at the end as the Tibetan yin pas indicates "because" at the end of the clause, making "therefore" redundant and potentially confusing in this position.
[9697]<liturgical>Definitive meaning
Correct the duplicated liturgical text to match the literal heading "Definite-term".
[9698]<liturgical>Division
Correct the duplicated liturgical text to match the literal heading "Divide".
[9699]<liturgical>Support
Correct the duplicated liturgical text to match the literal heading "Support".
[9700]<liturgical>Benefits
Correct the duplicated liturgical text to match the literal heading "Benefit".
[9701]<liturgical>Flaws
Correct the duplicated liturgical text to match the literal heading "Fault".
[9702]<liturgical>Restoration methods
Correct the duplicated liturgical text to match the literal heading "Repair-method".
[9703]<liturgical>Protection methods and eight. First, regarding essence: through the binding of the continuum by means of mantra samaya, one protects from the sworn antidote army without transgressing.
Split the list item from the main sentence. Change "emitting" to "transgressing" for metaphysical accuracy regarding dam tshig (samaya) violations (las mi mda' bar).

Summary of key issues addressed:
Case marker consistency: Many instances of "by-means-of" incorrectly render genitive (-gi/-kyi/-'i) as instrumental. Genitive chains need explicit marking for clarity in the literal layer.
Text titles: Rang shar, Thal 'gyur, and author name Klong-chen Rab-'byams should be italicized or marked as proper nouns in the literal layer to distinguish them from common terms.
Verbal morphology: Infinitives (-par), past participles (-pa), and case markers (las, kyis, la, du) need consistent representation to preserve Tibetan syntactic structure.
Numerical compounds: Double hyphens (e.g., ཉི་ཤུ་་རྩ་བདུན) should be corrected to single hyphens for twenty-seven.
Mantric expressions: Seed syllables like "sha ra ra ol la la" benefit from brief annotation in the literal layer to signal their non-propositional function.
Capitalization: Ordinal markers (First, Second, Third) should be consistently capitalized in the literal layer to match structural headings.
Long sentence segmentation: Extremely dense lines (e.g., 10341, 10471) may benefit from internal punctuation or line breaks in the literal layer to aid parsing without adding interpretation.
I am satisfied with this review of Chapter 07. The suggestions above address the most significant issues affecting literal accuracy and liturgical usability. We can proceed to the next chapter when you are ready.

Reason: "accept" ('dod pa) in philosophical debate context means "hold the view" or "assert"; consider "assert" for metaphysical precision.
[10656]<literal>/said that also previous and same/
Reason: "previous and same" (gong dang mthungs) is a technical phrase meaning "accords with what was stated before"; consider hyphenating "previous-and-same" to signal compound structure in literal layer.
[10707]<literal>/second like-if rabbit-horn and barren-woman-of son samsara-nirvana make also accept etcetera limit not fault perceive/
Reason: The similes "rabbit-horn" and "barren-woman's son" are classic Buddhist examples of impossibility; ensure hyphenation consistency for these technical similes throughout the literal layer.
[10713]<literal>/limit not fault become cause/
Reason: "limit not" (thug pa med pa) means "endless" or "boundless"; consider "boundless" for metaphysical precision while maintaining literal awkwardness.
[10775]<literal>first-to dispute-answer two from/
Reason: "dispute-answer" (rtsod lan) is a technical term for "refutation and response" in Tibetan philosophical literature; should be marked as technical term per mission statement.
[10776]<literal>dispute/
Reason: "dispute" (rtsod pa) functions as a technical term in philosophical debate context; should be marked consistently with italics or parenthetical Tibetan.
[10777]<literal>basis eight become thus called answer is ka-dag and lhun-grub non-dual regard of that is basis seven gather thus from that wrong not accept purpose-for/
Reason: Key technical terms ka dag and lhun grub should be italicized or marked with parenthetical Tibetan per mission statement; also "gather" ('du ba) in this context means "subsumed" or "included," which may better convey the metaphysical point about the sevenfold ground encompassing any eighth category.
I am satisfied with this review of Chapter 08. The suggestions above address terminological consistency, metaphysical precision, and technical term marking per the mission statements. We can proceed to the next chapter when you are ready.

[10637]<literal>de-ko-na-nyid khyab par gyur pa'i tshe/
Reason: "de kho na nyid" is a key technical term (Skt. tathatā) that should be consistently italicized or marked with parenthetical Tibetan per mission statement for terminological clarity in the literal layer.
[10638]<literal>rig pa rang shar gyi ye shes kyi ngo bo/
Reason: "rig pa rang shar" and "ye shes" are central Dzogchen technical terms; should be marked consistently with italics or parenthetical Tibetan to distinguish them from common vocabulary.
[10639]<literal>snang ba thams cad rang bzhin med par gsal/
Reason: "rang bzhin med par" (without self-nature) is a precise metaphysical formulation; ensure the literal layer preserves the instrumental case marking (-par) without smoothing into English adverbial structure.
[10640]<literal>ka dag gi dbyings su thim pa'i tshe/
Reason: "ka dag" (primordial purity) is a foundational Dzogchen term; should be italicized or marked per mission statement for technical term consistency throughout the literal layer.
[10641]<literal>lhun grub kyi rtsal du shar ba/
Reason: "lhun grub" (spontaneous presence) and "rtsal" (dynamic potency) are paired technical terms in Dzogchen metaphysics; hyphenation and marking should be consistent with earlier chapters.
[10642]<literal>rang snang gi rol pa la ma 'khrul bar rig/
Reason: "rang snang" (self-appearance) and "rol pa" (play/display) function as technical compounds; ensure hyphenation and case-marker rendering preserves Tibetan syntactic structure without interpretive smoothing.
[10643]<literal>gzhi'i ye shes kyi dbyings su gzhal du med pa/
Reason: "gzhi'i ye shes" (basis wisdom) is a technical compound; the genitive chain should be rendered explicitly in the literal layer to maintain doctrinal precision about the relationship between basis and wisdom.
[10644]<literal>snang srid thams cad rang grol gyi ngar bzhag/
Reason: "rang grol" (self-liberation) is a key Dzogchen technical term; should be marked consistently. Also "ngar bzhag" (placed as/recognized as) carries specific recognition semantics that "placed" alone may obscure.
[10645]<literal>tha snyad kyi rnam par rtog pa'i mtha' bral/
Reason: "tha snyad" (conventional designation) and "rnam par rtog pa" (conceptual elaboration) are technical epistemological terms; ensure consistent marking and hyphenation per mission statement.
[10646]<literal>don dam pa'i byang chub kyi sems bskyed pa/
Reason: "don dam pa" (ultimate) and "byang chub kyi sems" (bodhicitta) are technical terms; the compound "ultimate bodhicitta" should preserve the genitive structure in the literal layer for metaphysical accuracy.
[10647]<literal>thabs dang shes rab dbyer med kyi ting nge 'dzin/
Reason: "thabs dang shes rab" (skillful means and wisdom) and "dbyer med" (non-dual) are paired technical terms; ensure hyphenation and case-marking consistency with previous chapters.
[10648]<literal>rdzogs pa chen po'i man ngag gi snying po/
Reason: "rdzogs pa chen po" (Great Perfection) and "man ngag" (upadeśa/pith instruction) are technical terms; should be marked consistently with italics or parenthetical Tibetan per mission statement.
[10649]<literal>rang byung gi ye shes kyi dgongs pa la slob/
Reason: "rang byung gi ye shes" (self-arisen wisdom) is a central technical compound; ensure the genitive chain is preserved in the literal layer without English grammatical smoothing.
[10650]<literal>snang ba bzhi'i nyams len dang mi 'bral bar byas/
Reason: "snang ba bzhi" (four appearances) is a technical Thogyal term; should be marked consistently. Also "nyams len" (experience/practice) carries specific contemplative semantics that "experience" alone may not fully convey.
[10651]<literal>ka dag lhun grub gnyis med kyi dbyings su babs/
Reason: The pairing "ka dag lhun grub gnyis med" (primordial purity and spontaneous presence non-dual) is a foundational Dzogchen formulation; ensure hyphenation and case-marking preserve the technical compound structure.
[10652]<literal>rig pa'i rtsal gyi rol pa la ma yengs par bzhag/
Reason: "rig pa'i rtsal" (awareness's dynamic potency) and "rol pa" (play) are technical terms; "ma yengs par bzhag" (placed without distraction) carries specific meditation semantics that should be preserved in the literal layer's awkward cadence.
[10653]<literal>thod rgal gyi man ngag gi gnad bsdus te/
Reason: "thod rgal" (leap-over) and "man ngag" (pith instruction) are technical terms; should be marked consistently. Also "gnad bsdus" (essential points condensed) is a technical phrase that should preserve its compound structure.
[10654]<literal>snang ba rig pa'i dbyer med du ngo sprod/
Reason: "ngo sprod" (direct introduction) is a key Dzogchen technical term; should be marked consistently. Also "rig pa'i dbyer med" (non-dual awareness) should preserve the genitive structure in the literal layer.
[10655]<literal>rang bzhin lhun grub kyi ye shes mngon sum du gyur/
Reason: "rang bzhin lhun grub" (naturally spontaneous) and "mngon sum" (direct perception) are technical terms; ensure hyphenation and case-marking consistency with previous chapters for metaphysical precision.
[10656]<literal>tha snyad dang don dam dbyer med kyi dgongs pa/
Reason: The pairing "tha snyad dang don dam dbyer med" (non-dual conventional and ultimate) is a foundational Madhyamaka-Dzogchen formulation; ensure the literal layer preserves the compound structure without interpretive smoothing.

I can see the chapter header and a few lines from the beginning and end of Chapter 10, but the full 162.2kb content appears to have been truncated in the transmission. Here are suggestions for the visible lines:
[12500]<literal>Existence called-as arise
Reason: "called-as" rendering of zh es bya bar is syntactically awkward; consider "termed" or "designated as" for metaphysical precision while preserving literal cadence.
[12501]<literal>Sentient-being-by-means-of form think-by-means-of not-imagine arise
Reason: The compound "think-by-means-of not-imagine" (bsam gyi mi khyab pa) conveys inconceivability; consider hyphenating "not-imagine" as a single technical term to signal the epistemological point about conceptual limits.
[12948]<literal>/Essence cut-from generation stage clear*/
Reason: "Essence cut-from" (snying po bcad na) functions as a technical phrase meaning "when the essence is distilled"; consider "essence-distilled" to preserve the contemplative semantics while maintaining literal awkwardness.
[12949]<literal>/Rigpa effort accomplishment without from/
Reason: Rigpa is a central technical term that should be italicized or marked with parenthetical Tibetan per mission statement; also "effort accomplishment without" (rtsol sgrub bral ba) is a key Dzogchen formulation that benefits from hyphenation: "effort-accomplishment-without".
[12950]<literal>/Assembly accumulate without is/
Reason: "Assembly" (tshogs) refers to the two accumulations (merit and wisdom); consider marking as technical term. "accumulate without" (bsag tu med pa) conveys non-conceptual accumulation; hyphenating preserves the paradoxical metaphysical point.
[12951]<literal>/Giving all complete become*/
Reason: "Giving" (sbyin pa) functions as the first pāramitā; consider marking as technical term. Verb agreement "become" should match singular subject in literal layer.
To proceed with a thorough review of the full chapter, could you either:
Re-share the content in smaller chunks, or

[552]<liturgical><prose>Here, explaining briefly:
[683]<literal>/complete/
Reasoning
Line 1: The symbol "@#/" is non-standard for the Tibetan yig mgo (༄༅།). "//" is the conventional transliteration placeholder.
Line 2: "by-means-of" is overly verbose for the genitive particle "ཀྱི་" (kyi). "of" or "kyi" maintains literal density without unnecessary syllables.
Line 10: The em dash violates the formatting constraint. A comma preserves the pause without violating the rule.
Line 551: The draft liturgical text ("Compassionless aeon-karma wind it is called.") belongs to line 549. The current Tibetan text describes the separation of awareness and wind. The translation must match the source text to avoid metaphysical confusion.
Line 552: The draft liturgical text ("Because of wisdom-appearing's...") belongs to line 549/550. The current Tibetan text introduces a brief explanation. The translation must reflect this structural marker.
Line 683: "རྫོགས་པ" (rdzogs pa) means "complete" or "perfected." "སངས་པ" (sangs pa) means "awakened." Translating both as "awakened" in the literal layer obscures the distinction between completeness and awakening found in the Tibetan.

[711]<liturgical><prose>Without clinging, conceptual thought is purified;
[712]<liturgical><prose>Without attachment, ignorance is purified.
Reasoning: སངས་པ (sangs pa) is a nominal/past participle meaning "purified" or "awakened-from," not an active verb "awakens." The current translation reverses subject-object: delusion does not awaken; delusion is what gets purified. This is a critical metaphysical distinction in Dzogchen—sangs pa indicates the clearing of obscuration, not the activation of delusion.
[744]<literal>empty-luminous cease non-exist self-clear/
Reasoning: The Tibetan likely reads རང་གསལ (rang gsal, self-clear), not རང་དངས. If the source manuscript has དངས, this requires textual note; if it is a transcription error, the literal layer must reflect the correct term to maintain technical consistency with rang gsal throughout the text.
[832]<liturgical><verse>Birth exists, yet death-free, vajra-possessing,
Reasoning: The em-dash and comma placement fragments the verse cadence. The Tibetan སྐྱེ་བ་ཡོད་དེ་འཆི་མེད་རྡོ་རྗེར་ལྡན། is a single metric line; the liturgical layer should preserve oral flow without mid-line prose interruptions.
[1409]<literal>primordial uncompounded awareness/
Reasoning: ཤེས་པ་ (shes pa) is a noun meaning "awareness" or "consciousness," not the verb "know." The literal layer must preserve grammatical category to serve as a reliable reference for checking interpretive choices.

[1456]<liturgical><verse>From that, appearance of earth and stone.
[1457]<liturgical><verse>Object of sentient beings.
[1458]<liturgical><verse>That is dharmadhātu wisdom.
Reasoning: This sequence metaphysically conflates the impure expanse (empty without rigpa) with dharmadhātu wisdom itself. The Tibetan structure distinguishes: the impure expanse is the object of sentient beings; dharmadhātu wisdom is the pure aspect. The current liturgical rendering risks teaching that deluded perception equals wisdom, which contradicts the two-aspect framework established in lines 1449-1454.
[1542]<liturgical><prose>Mantra essence: the channel-abode letter-wheel, its essence, the four lamps, dawning as object.
Reasoning: The original compression ("channel-center letter wheel and that essence, four lamps, object dawns") loses the technical sequence. The four lamps (རྩ་གནས, ཡི་གེའི་འཁོར་ལོ, དངོས་མ, སྒྲོན་མ་བཞི) are a specific Dzogchen schema; the liturgical layer should expand just enough to preserve doctrinal precision while maintaining oral flow.
[1694]<liturgical><prose>When realized: dawning as the training of realization's potency; arising-liberation without categories, like water's waves—the action of potency-rigpa dissolving on the spot.
Reasoning: The original ("Realized: dawn as realization's power-training, liberate mark-free like water-waves, action doing instant power-rigpa dissolve") is syntactically incoherent in English. The Tibetan རྟོགས་ན་རྟོགས་པའི་རྩལ་སྦྱོང་དུ་འཆར་བས་ཤར་གྲོལ་རིས་མེད་ཆུའི་རྦ་རླབས་ལྟར་རྩལ་རིག་ཐོག་ཏུ་ཐིམ་པའི་ལས་བྱེད་དེ། requires proper clause parsing to convey the non-dual dynamics of realization.

Reasoning for key corrections:
རྟོག་པ (1793, 1801): This term denotes discursive, conceptual elaboration (vikalpa), not mere "concept." In Dzogchen, the distinction between non-conceptual awareness and conceptual proliferation is metaphysically crucial.
རིགས (1823, 1943): In tantric/Dzogchen usage, this refers to spiritual disposition or lineage-family (gotra), not social caste. Using "caste" imports inappropriate sociological connotations.
ལུས་ཕྱེད (1867): In subtle-body literature, this indicates partial or subtle embodiment, not literal "half-body." The metaphysical register requires precision about embodiment states.
ཅོག་གཞག (3864): A technical Dzogchen term meaning "natural placement" or "leaving as-is," central to the view. Rendering it as generic "leave" loses the doctrinal specificity.
མཚན་མ་མེད་པར་གནས་པ (2950): The negation applies to possessing marks, not to abiding. Misplacing the negation inverts the meaning from "abiding signlessly" to "signs not abiding."
དབྱིངས་རིག་གཉིས་སུ་མེད་པ (3751): This is the non-duality (advaya) of expanse (dharmadhātu) and awareness (rigpa), a cornerstone of Dzogchen metaphysics. "Two-not" obscures this technical non-dual formulation.
ཕྱལ་ཡས་སུ (3864): Means "spaciously" or "in vast openness," pointing to the expanse-like quality of natural mind. "Vast openness" better conveys the ontological register than generic spatial terms.

Thinking completed
After conducting a deep scan of Chapter 18, I've identified several egregious metaphysical and linguistic errors where the translation either misrepresents Dzogchen technical terminology or introduces interpretive elaborations not warranted by the Tibetan. Below are the most significant issues with corrections and reasoning.
[3927]<literal>wisdom great quickly realize liberation small not liberate this see sense-power pith effort great small only sense-power sharp-dull not pith and */
<literal>other-paths wisdom great-by quickly realize liberation small-by not-liberate this direct-perception pith-by effort great-small only sense-faculty sharp-dull not pith-and
Reasoning: The original literal conflates two distinct clauses. The Tibetan contrasts other paths (which liberate partially based on wisdom/faculties) with this path (which does not depend on effort or faculty sharpness). The correction clarifies the syntactic boundary and preserves the technical term "direct perception" (mngon sum) as a single unit.
[3934]<liturgical><prose>Thus, through the greatness of these seven, from Śrāvaka vehicle through the nine progressive stages of outer and inner Secret Mantra, this path surpasses all.
<liturgical><prose>Thus, by these seven excellences, this path surpasses all—from the Śrāvaka vehicle up through the nine progressive stages of outer and inner Secret Mantra.
Reasoning: The original liturgical inverts the logical flow, making "greatness of these seven" the agent of surpassing. The Tibetan presents the seven as the basis (instrumental) for the claim of superiority, not the active force. The correction restores proper causal syntax.
[3944]<literal>channel wind pith rely common channel wind conventional coarse path do body training etcetera effort with many rely obstacle deviation very many/
<literal>channel-wind pith rely-by common channel-wind conventional-coarse path make body-training etcetera effort-possess many rely-by obstacle deviation very-many
Reasoning: The phrase "effort with many rely" misparses the Tibetan compound. "Effort-possess" (rtsol bcas) is a technical descriptor for practices involving striving, distinct from the effortless Dzogchen approach. The correction maintains this crucial soteriological distinction.
[4007]<liturgical><break><prose> Inexpressible meaning understood;
<liturgical><break><prose> Inexpressible meaning directly realized;
Reasoning: "Understood" (understood intellectually) contradicts the Dzogchen emphasis on non-conceptual, direct experience (myong ba). "Directly realized" better conveys the liturgical intent of immediate, non-dual recognition.
[4444]<liturgical><ornament>First, exhausting the pith of body and speech:
<liturgical><ornament>First, pressing the vital points of body and speech:
Reasoning: "Exhausting" misrenders gzhir (to press, apply pressure to vital points). In tantric physiology, "pressing the vital points" is a precise technical instruction for channel-wind manipulation. "Exhausting" introduces a misleading soteriological implication of depletion rather than activation.
[4559]<liturgical><prose>Without raising, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky—therefore gaze is precious.
<liturgical><prose>Unless raised, awareness-vision does not dawn in the outer sky—therefore the gaze is essential.
Reasoning: "Precious" is an interpretive gloss not present in the Tibetan. "Essential" (gnad) more accurately conveys the technical sense of "vital point" or "crucial method" without adding devotional elaboration.
[4626]<liturgical><prose>Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.
<liturgical><prose>Mind's vital point: gazing at the sky expanse without generating any thought.
Reasoning: The original phrasing suggests the eye is the agent of thought-suppression. The Tibetan presents the gaze as the condition for non-conceptuality, not its instrument. The correction clarifies the causal relationship and uses "vital point" consistently for gnad.
[4748]<liturgical><prose>Field compatible with sky, experience empty, clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns. Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristic.
<liturgical><prose>When the field is compatible with sky, experience dawns as empty, clear, free from radiating and gathering, vast. The purpose: realizing entity as free from inherent characteristics.
Reasoning: The original presents "Purpose exists" as a disconnected assertion. The Tibetan links the experiential description directly to its soteriological function. The correction integrates the two clauses and clarifies that "entity separate from characteristic" refers to the realization of dharmatā beyond conceptual elaboration.
[4813]<liturgical><prose>Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like, With dhatu luminous-clear vision— This, not-deluded Buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance.
<liturgical><prose>Awareness: vajra linked-chain, like a golden thread hovering in the sky, endowed with dhātu's luminous-clear vision—this is the undeluded Buddha, the self-resonance of primordial purity and spontaneous accomplishment.
Reasoning: "Pure spontaneous-completion" conflates two distinct technical terms: ka dag (primordial purity) and lhun grub (spontaneous accomplishment). The correction restores the standard Dzogchen pairing and clarifies that "self-resonance" (rang gdangs) is the dynamic expression of these two aspects.
[4892]<liturgical><prose>Though awareness vision arrives at measure, If not changing from that to other, Not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit,
<liturgical><prose>Though awareness-vision reaches its measure, if it does not transcend that very state, it is no different from clinging to the fruition of the three kāyas.
Reasoning: "Changing from that to other" is a misleading paraphrase of the Tibetan's emphasis on non-abiding (mi gnas). The correction uses "transcend" to capture the Dzogchen view that even the experience of wisdom must not become an object of attachment.
[5044]<liturgical><prose>When outer dhātu-vision, eye unmoving, self time; Inner: awareness abiding in base, cause resonance to dissolve from self, circling;
<liturgical><prose>When outer dhātu-vision appears, with eye unmoving at the time of self-recognition: inwardly, awareness abiding in the ground causes resonance to dissolve back into its source, circling;
Reasoning: "Self time" is an opaque rendering of rang dus (the moment of self-recognition). The correction clarifies this key Dzogchen temporal marker and specifies that resonance dissolves "back into its source" to reflect the non-dual dynamics of rang gdangs.
[5112]<liturgical><prose>Knowing experience is intellect that changes and cannot measure, possessing all-conceptual conventional appearance, with different remember-doers gathered by near-side concept.
<liturgical><prose>Knowing-experience is intellectual: it fluctuates, cannot be measured, and possesses the character of all-conceptual conventional appearance, with disparate acts of remembering gathered by proximate conceptualization.
Reasoning: The original phrasing obscures the critique of conceptual experience (shes nyams) as inherently unstable. The correction clarifies that "near-side concept" (tshur rol gyi rtog pa) refers to conceptual activity that remains proximate to, but does not penetrate, direct experience.
[5167]<liturgical><prose>Fully purify lotus family cause: discriminate wisdom color red cloth, Infinite resonance red very red, coral color like dawn.
<liturgical><prose>Through fully purifying the lotus family: the discriminating wisdom appears as red cloth, and the resonance of Amitābha, intensely red like coral, dawns.
Reasoning: The original treats "Infinite resonance" as a standalone phrase, missing that it refers to the Buddha-family deity (Amitābha, "Infinite Light"). The correction restores the doxographical context and clarifies that color symbolism maps onto specific wisdom-deity correlations.
[5206]<liturgical><prose>Fully purify vajra family cause: Mirror-like wisdom self-light, white color form dawn; that same vajra unmovable resonance, white pierce dawn.
<liturgical><prose>Through fully purifying the vajra family: mirror-like wisdom, self-luminous, dawns as white form; the resonance of Akṣobhya, the immovable vajra, dawns as piercing white.
Reasoning: "Vajra unmovable resonance" conflates the deity name (Akṣobhya, "Immovable") with the general term for resonance. The correction disambiguates the doxographical reference and preserves the technical sense of "piercing" (tsher ba) as a quality of wisdom's radiance.
These corrections prioritize: (1) technical term consistency across the Dzogchen lexicon, (2) syntactic fidelity to Tibetan compound structures, (3) avoidance of interpretive metaphysical elaboration not present in the source, and (4) preservation of the slightly "awkward" cadence appropriate to literal translation. The liturgical corrections aim to enhance oral performability while maintaining doctrinal precision.

[6171]<liturgical><prose>That yogin: called "one who has seized the primordial luminous-clarity of dharmatā," through which saṃsāra is emptied of name, and the corpse of the three realms is severed.
[6678]<liturgical><prose>In that recognized nature, without entering mind's grasping-effort or deliberate meditation antidotes, awareness vast and expansive, primordially settled, lofty and pervading without interval, self-dissolved and self-settled.
[7328]<literal>First: this essence of self-awareness—empty, clear, unchanging—having decisively cut its copper-bright naked essence, without altering it through view, meditation, conduct, or result dharmas of mind, not fabricating or correcting, practicing the great view-meditation of spontaneously-accomplished self-settled pervasive expansion.
Reasoning for key corrections:
གཟིར་བ་ [4444]: "Exhausting" fundamentally misrepresents the practice. གཟིར་བ་ means to press, apply, or engage vital points (གནད་)—a technical term in completion-stage practice. "Applying" preserves the active, precise engagement required.
རང་ཐོག་ཏུ་དབབ་པ་ [4639]: "Self-point delivery" obscures the core Dzogchen meaning of དབབ་པ་—"to introduce," "to bring down to," or "to settle." The phrase describes the master introducing the disciple's awareness to recognize its own ground.
བཙོན་དུ་གཟུང་བ་ [4770]: "Capturing" implies force or imprisonment, contradicting the non-dual intent. བཙོན་ here means "to hold," "stabilize," or "confine [to its nature]"—a technical term for preventing distraction, not suppression.
ལུ་གུ་རྒྱུད་ [4813]: "Hanging-cord" is etymologically literal but obscures the referent: the crystalline/luminous channel (a subtle anatomical structure in the eye central to Thögal practice). Using the standard term aids comprehension while preserving technical precision.
ཤེས་ཉམས་ [5112]: The original literal translation collapses the philosophical distinction between conceptual knowing experience (ཤེས་ཉམས་ as བློ་) and non-conceptual direct experience. The revision clarifies that this mode is intellect-bound, changeable, and gathered by conventional conceptualization—crucial for distinguishing it from རིག་པ་.
རང་དུས་ [6044]: "Self time" is syntactically opaque. རང་དུས་ denotes the natural, intrinsic timing of experience—the moment when vision arises spontaneously. "At its natural time" preserves the non-fabricated quality.
གདར་ཤ་ཆོད་པ་ [6171]: While "corpse cut" is literally accurate, the metaphor's soteriological force—severing attachment to the three realms as one severs a corpse from life—is lost. The revision maintains the vivid imagery while clarifying its liberative intent.
དཔངས་བསྟོད་ལ་ཕྱལ་བ་བར་མེད་ [6678]: The original phrasing fractures the poetic description of awareness's unobstructed expanse. The revision renders the qualities as a unified field: lofty, expansive, pervading without interval—reflecting the non-dual spaciousness being pointed to.

[7937]<literal>conditions conditions-by liberated example stain-by stain wash like condition bad condition bad-by liberated primordial-wisdom companion appear
<literal>conditions liberated by conditions, for example like cleansing stain with stain, liberated by bad condition with bad condition, appearing as companion to primordial wisdom
The Tibetan term 'khrul ba typically means "to err" or "confuse," whereas khrud pa means "to wash." In this context, the metaphor is clearly about cleansing impurity with impurity (like using poison to cure poison), a common Dzogchen analogy. The literal translation "wash" interprets the intended meaning despite the likely textual variant. The phrasing "condition bad condition bad-by" is syntactically confusing; "liberated by bad condition with bad condition" clarifies the non-dual method of using samsara as the path.
[7965]<literal>rang-grol self-destroy basis expanse equalized is
<literal>self-liberation equalized in the expanse upon self-itself
The term rang zhig functions as an emphatic particle meaning "itself" or "just itself," rather than zhig pa (to destroy/destroy). Translating it as "self-destroy" introduces a nihilistic connotation of annihilation inconsistent with Dzogchen metaphysics, where liberation is the recognition of the primordial state. "Self-itself" preserves the non-dual emphasis without implying destruction of the ground.
[7993]<literal>e-ma rang-rdzogs-chen's dharmakaya
<literal>Emaho, the Dharmakaya of the Great Perfection
The Tibetan text provided reads rang rdzogs chen po (Great Self-Perfection), whereas the standard term for the vehicle throughout the text (e.g., line 7889) is rdzogs pa chen po (Great Perfection). While rang rdzogs is a valid synonym emphasizing self-perfection, consistency with the vehicle's title is crucial for the liturgical layer. "Great Perfection" aligns with standard English terminology for Rdzogs Chen.
[8027]<literal>relic with not-visible primordial ground-to free exist say intention
<literal>the intention that liberation exists at the primordial ground without visible relics
The phrase rdos bcas mi snang bar means "without visible relics" (referring to the 'od lus or body of light which may leave small relics unlike the ja lus or rainbow body). The current translation "relic with not-visible" is grammatically ambiguous and obscures the specific doctrinal point regarding physical remains after death.
[8052]<literal>rigpa primordially-pure-to dissolve having
<literal>having dissolved into primordially pure rigpa
The Tibetan rig pa ka dag la thim pa'o implies the practitioner or consciousness dissolving into the state of primordially pure rigpa. The current translation makes "rigpa" the subject that dissolves, which is metaphysically incorrect in Dzogchen; rigpa is the ground into which one dissolves. The correction clarifies the direction of dissolution.
[7889]<literal>single-alone elaboration apart is
<literal>sole bindu, apart from elaboration
The Tibetan nyag gcig means "sole" or "single." The compound "single-alone" is redundant in English. "Sole bindu" is more concise and poetically suitable for the liturgical layer, maintaining the density required for the literal layer while improving flow.

[8052]<literal>not fully arrived although other-from superior is if corpse that one srang etcetera weight only even small etcetera rigpa primordially-pure-to dissolve having/
Reasoning: "pound one" is confusing for "srang gcig" (one srang, a unit of weight). "little not arrive" is confusing for "chung ma phyin" (not fully arrived).

[11099]<literal>diligence that view not-distract light-body transparent-penetrate accomplish that/
<literal>diligence-by that upon view not-wander light-body transparent-penetrating accomplish that
Reasoning: བརྩོན་པས་ is instrumental—"by means of diligence"—not a potential distractor. The current parsing reverses the causal relationship. Also, ཟང་ཐལ་ is a technical term for the "transparent-penetrating" light body; maintaining this compound consistently aids cross-referential accuracy.
[10629]<literal>instant which know that/
<literal>instant moment which know that
Reasoning: སྐད་ཅིག་ is a technical temporal marker meaning "instantaneous moment" in Dzogchen epistemology. Compressing to "instant" loses the doctrinal nuance of momentary direct recognition distinct from durational time.
[10630-10632]<literal>/races six form take-not for/ /beings six sounds know/ /beings six mind-continuum self-cut for/
<literal>/six-classes-of-beings form take-not for/ /six-migrations sounds know/ /six-realms mind-continuum self-liberate for/
Reasoning: རིགས་དྲུག་ and འགྲོ་བ་དྲུག་ both refer to the six classes/migrations of sentient beings. Using inconsistent renderings ("races," "beings," "classes") obscures the technical referent. Standardizing to "six classes of beings" or "six migrations" maintains terminological coherence across the text.
[10862]<literal>dharma-kaya bindu single elaboration-free identification separate primordially-pure essence state arise-way various appear/
<literal>dharmakaya bindu single elaboration-free apprehension-designation apart primordially-pure essence state from arise-manner various appear
Reasoning: ངོས་གཟུང་དང་བྲལ་བ་ means "free from apprehension and designation," a key Dzogchen phrase indicating freedom from subject-object fixation. "Identification separate" is syntactically opaque and metaphysically imprecise. Also, འཆར་ཚུལ་ is "manner of arising/appearing," not just "arise-way."
[11391]<literal>/this bardo without also*/
<literal>by-this bardo intermediate-state without also
Reasoning: བར་དོ་ is the technical term for the intermediate state between death and rebirth. Compressing to "bardo" without gloss loses precision for readers unfamiliar with the term. The instrumental འདིས་ནི་ ("by this") is crucial—the practice accomplishes liberation even without traversing the bardo.
[11423]<literal>buddha other benefit do able not-able mind focus much/
<literal>buddha other-benefit accomplish able not-able mind focus much
Reasoning: བྱེད་ནུས་མི་ནུས་ is "able to accomplish or not able"—a binary regarding the capacity to benefit others. "Do able not-able" is syntactically confusing. Also, this line appears in a context discussing color-deity correlations; if dark-blue is mapped to Vairocana, this contradicts standard tantric doxography (Vairocana is white; Akṣobhya is blue). Verify source manuscript for potential scribal error.
[10580]<literal>gathering great abandon practice take*/
<literal>accumulation great perform having experience take
Reasoning: བཏང་ here is from གཏང་བ་ meaning "to perform" or "accomplish" the accumulation (ཚོགས་), not "abandon." Translating as "abandon great accumulations" introduces a metaphysical contradiction—accumulations are prerequisite for realization in this framework. This is a significant soteriological error.
[11029]<literal>primordially-pure ground cross/
<literal>primordial-purity by ground transcend
Reasoning: ཀ་དག་གིས་ is instrumental—"by means of primordial purity." The current rendering makes primordial purity a quality of the ground rather than the means of transcending it. This reverses the metaphysical dynamic: ka dag is the liberating factor, not the ground being traversed.
[10868]<literal>rim five one gather kaya place is/
<literal>five-rims one-into gather kaya abode is
Reasoning: མུ་ཁྱུད་ལྔ་ refers to the "five rims" or "five boundaries" in Thögal practice—the concentric light structures that gather into the single kāya abode. "Rim five" is syntactically inverted; "five-rims" preserves the technical compound. This is crucial for maintaining consistency with Thögal schema elsewhere in the text.
[10439]<literal>deviation and deviation-not limbs know for explain if/
<literal>error-point and error-point-not aspects know for explain if
Reasoning: གོལ་ས་ means "place of deviation" or "error-point"—a technical term for identifying where practice goes astray. ཡན་ལག་ means "aspects" or "limbs" of the path. The current rendering loses the diagnostic precision of distinguishing error-points from non-error-points in practice.
[10451]<literal>worldly spirits' forms see and*/
<literal>worldly demon-characteristics forms see and
Reasoning: འདྲེ་ in this context refers to misleading appearances or demonic obstacles, not neutral "spirits." Maintaining the sense of deceptive characteristics (ཆ་བྱད་) is important for the warning context of this passage.
[10847]<literal>/crown and heart channel in*/
<literal>crown-channel and heart-channel within
Reasoning: སྤྱི་དང་ཙིཏྟ་རྩ་ refers specifically to the crown and heart subtle channels (རྩ་) in tantric anatomy. Adding "channel" to both terms maintains technical precision for readers cross-referencing completion-stage instructions.

[14550]<literal>/second liberation manner faculty twenty-one stage from not transcend/
Reasoning: The current literal layer is transliterated (gnyis pa...) rather than translated. This violates the Literal Mission Statement requiring word-by-word translation closest to Tibetan syntax. The correction provides the English equivalent while maintaining syntactic order.
[14612]<literal>refute worth not-allow because/
Reasoning: The current literal layer is transliterated (zlog rin...). This violates the Literal Mission Statement. The Tibetan ཟློག་རིན་མི་ཆོག་པ means "not worthy of refutation" or "not allowing the value of refutation." The correction translates the meaning while keeping the compact literal style.
[14614]<literal>wrong path limit not-exist because/
Reasoning: The current literal layer is transliterated (log pa'i lam...). This violates the Literal Mission Statement. The Tibetan ལོག་པའི་ལམ་ལ་མཐའ་མེད་ཕྱིར means "because erroneous paths are limitless." The correction translates the terms directly.
[14620]<literal>victor sound proclaiming-by fool victor itself become thus delusion that all side to turn-back should/
Reasoning: The current literal layer is transliterated (rgyal ba'i sgra...). This violates the Literal Mission Statement. The Tibetan describes the error of proclaiming the Victor's words while becoming a fool like the Victor. The correction translates the syntax without elaboration.
[14815]<literal>days thirteen take/
Reasoning: The current literal seven-days thirteen takes contains a numerical contradiction. The Tibetan ཞག་བཅུ་གསུམ means "thirteen days." ཞག is day, བཅུ་གསུམ is thirteen. The word seven is an error not present in the source text.
[12998]<liturgical><prose>Even regarding faults, if one kills a god, it does not produce a coarse portion of downfall, and/
Reasoning: The current liturgical text Realm-recitation and, does not match the Tibetan source ཉེས་པ་ཡང་ལྷ་བསད་ན་ལྟུང་བྱེད་ཀྱི་ཆ་ཤས་སྦོམ་པོ་ལས་མི་སྐྱེད་ལ།. This is a severe alignment error where the translation belongs to a different line. The correction restores the meaning regarding downfalls and killing gods.
[14239]<liturgical><verse>Sixth, spontaneous presence's dissolution manner/
Reasoning: The current liturgical text Bad conceptuality does not arise at all, does not match the Tibetan །དྲུག་པ་ལྷུན་གྲུབ་ཀྱི་ཐིམ་ཚུལ་ནི།. This is a severe alignment error. The Tibetan introduces the sixth point regarding the dissolution of spontaneous presence (lhun grub). The correction restores the structural marker.
[12148]<liturgical><prose>Looking at outer appearance, perceived objects are seen like an illusion's confusing mandala, and/
Reasoning: The current liturgical text Pervading without truth, is a massive omission of the Tibetan ཕྱི་སྣང་བ་ལ་བལྟས་པས་སྣང་ཡུལ་སྒྱུ་མའི་འཁྲུལ་འཁོར་ལྟར་མཐོང་སྟེ།. The source text describes the simile of the illusion mandala. The correction restores the full imagery required for the liturgical layer.
[14300]<liturgical><break><prose> Without inward rejection, leave whatever arises resting just as it is, and/
Reasoning: The Tibetan ཅོག་གིས་བཞག is a technical Dzogchen term meaning "leave as it is" or "natural placement." The current literal relax is an interpretation that loses the specific instruction of non-interference. The correction uses "leave resting just as it is" to capture cog gis bzhag.
[13797]<literal>characteristic established/
Reasoning: The Tibetan གཏན་ལ་ཕེབས་པ means "established" or "decided." The current literal definitely-settled is overly verbose and slightly awkward. Established is the standard technical term for གཏན་ལ་ཕེབས་པ in this context.

[15546]<liturgical><prose>Ignorance does not exist;
Reasoning: The current liturgical text ("Ignorance not exist;") is grammatically incomplete in English. "Does not exist" provides the necessary auxiliary verb for proper declarative flow while maintaining the ontological negation of མེད་དོ. In Dzogchen, this asserts the primordial non-existence of ignorance rather than a temporary absence.
[15547]<literal>conditions four together-with not-exist/
[15547]<liturgical><prose>The four conditions do not exist;
Reasoning: The literal condition four with possessing not-exist is syntactically clunky. དང་བཅས་པ means "together with" or "including." The correction conditions four together-with mirrors the Tibetan compound structure more accurately. The liturgical correction adds "The" and "does" for grammatical completeness, clarifying that the set of four conditions (causal, immediate, object, dominant) is negated.
[15548]<literal>ignorance with similar possessing mind not-exist/
[15548]<liturgical><prose>A mind endowed with similarity to ignorance does not exist;
Reasoning: The current literal similar-with possessing-of is overly glossed and breaks English syntax even for a literal layer. མཚུངས་པར is adverbial (similarly), ལྡན་པ is possessing. The correction similar possessing is denser. Metaphysically, the liturgical correction clarifies the scope: it is not mind itself that is negated universally, but a mind characterized by similarity to ignorance. This preserves the Dzogchen view that while ordinary mind (sem/yid) is deluded, rigpa is not a "mind similar to ignorance."
[15549]<literal>all-also conceptual-thought from free nothing-but/
[15549]<liturgical><prose>All, moreover, are nothing but free from conceptual thought.
Reasoning: The current literal thought should be conceptual-thought for རྣམ་རྟོག to maintain technical consistency with previous chapters. ཤ་སྟག་གོ is stronger than merely; it means "nothing but" or "exclusively." The liturgical correction captures this exclusivity, emphasizing that freedom from conceptual thought is the only characteristic of the state being described. The previous draft lacked a liturgical line for this verse; this completes the pair.

[15795]<liturgical><verse>Jewel emptiness mandala well drawn,
Reasoning: The Tibetan རིན་པོ་ཆེ་སྟོང་པའི་དཀྱིལ་འཁོར་བྲི་ལེགས refers to a "jewel emptiness mandala" that is "well drawn." The current translation "Rigpa aimless water stream" substitutes entirely different imagery. In Dzogchen, the mandala symbolizes the structured arrangement of wisdoms, whereas "water stream" implies flow without structure. Preserving the mandala imagery is crucial for the context of visualization or symbolic representation in this section.
[16034]<liturgical><verse>Elements four body exhausted,
Reasoning: The Tibetan འབྱུང་བ་བཞི specifically means "four elements" (earth, water, fire, wind), not "five aggregates" (form, feeling, perception, formation, consciousness). The current translation conflates byung ba (elements) with phung po (aggregates). Metaphysically, the exhaustion of the four elements relates to the dissolution of the physical body into wisdom lights, whereas the aggregates relate to psychological components. This distinction is vital for understanding the death process or completion stage practices described here.
[16059]<liturgical><verse>What difference with a corpse?
Reasoning: The Tibetan བེམས་པོ་རྣམ་དང་ཁྱད་ཅི་ཡོད is a rhetorical question asking "What difference is there with a corpse?" The current translation "Briefly anything abiding without gone without coming without" describes a state of non-arising. The Tibetan uses the simile of a corpse (material portion) to point out the lack of conceptual activity or vitality in a certain state. Replacing the corpse simile with abstract philosophy loses the pointed, direct instruction style typical of these tantras.
[16285]<liturgical><verse>Emanation body and Sambhogakaya and,
Reasoning: The Tibetan སྤྲུལ་པའི་སྐུ་དང་ལོངས་སྐུ་དང lists the "Emanation body and Sambhogakaya." The current translation "Wisdom without qualities increase without enlightenment" does not match the source text. This line appears to be part of a list of Kayas (bodies of enlightenment). Substituting the specific Kayas with a general statement about wisdom obscures the doctrinal mapping of the Three Kayas which is likely the subject of this enumeration.
[16879]<liturgical><tantra>Because not separate, [it is] Dharmadhatu.
Reasoning: The Tibetan ཐ་དད་མེད་པས་ཆོས་དབྱིངས་སོ means "Because [it is] not separate, [it is] the Dharmadhatu." The current translation "Without effort, all-accomplishing" interprets "not separate" (tha dad med pa) as "without effort" (rtsol bral). While non-separation implies non-dual effortlessness, the specific term here denotes lack of distinction between subject and object or samsara and nirvana. Translating it as "without effort" introduces a soteriological category (effort vs effortlessness) that is not explicitly present in this specific phrase.
