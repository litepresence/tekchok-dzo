# PROJECT STATUS: Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod Translation Project

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-06
**Current Phase:** SECOND DRAFT - VOLUME 2 LITERAL/LITURGICAL REVISION
**Current Task:** Beginning Draft 2 Revision for Volume 2
**Started:** 2026-02-06

## DRAFT 2 REVISION PROTOCOL

### Model: MiniMax M2.1

### Current Task
- **Target:** Volume 2, Literal and Liturgical Layers
- **Pages:** 001-415
- **Priority:** Address Khenpo-identified critical failures

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES (From Khenpo Review)

### Literal Layer
1. **Articles Present:** Remove all "the", "a", "an" unless Tibetan explicitly uses de/di
2. **Word Order Violation:** Restore 1:1 mapping from Tibetan, not previous draft
3. **Particle Ambiguity:** Mark with slashes (to/in, from/by)
4. **Compound Hyphenation:** Reflect nonduality (emptiness-luminosity)
5. **Verbal Phrases:** Keep ka dag/lhun grub verbal, not nominal

### Liturgical Layer
1. **Semantic Drift:** *rig pa* must be "awareness" only
2. **Elegance vs Precision:** Never sacrifice Dzogchen accuracy for style
3. **Sentence Length:** Sentences over 40 words should be rare
4. **Vairotsana Voice:** Maintain majestic, transmissive tone

### Page Bleed
- Treat page numbers as scanning artifacts only
- Maintain logical continuity across page boundaries

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

The previous status report declared "VOLUME 2 COMPLETE" with celebration. I must be blunt: file completion does not equal translation completion. While all 3,576 files across the four base layers exist, the quality of those files is questionable at best and unreliable at worst.

This status report reflects the true state of the project based on critical Khenpo review.

---

## FILE STATISTICS (MISLEADING METRICS)

**Volume 1:**
- Tibetan: 479/479 pages (100%)
- Wylie: 479/479 pages (100%)
- Literal: 479/479 pages (100%)
- Liturgical: 479/479 pages (100%)

**Volume 2:**
- Tibetan: 415/415 pages (100%)
- Wylie: 415/415 pages (100%)
- Literal: 415/415 pages (100%)
- Liturgical: 415/415 pages (100%)

**Project Total:** 894 pages × 4 layers = 3,576 files

**Reality:** 3,576 files exist. Quality audits suggest significant revisions are needed for approximately 70% of Literal layer files and 60% of Liturgical layer files.

## LAYER-BY-LAYER STATUS

### Tibetan Layer (Tshad Ma)
**Status:** IMMACULATE
**Assessment:** The source text is treated as absolute truth. No changes should ever be made to this layer. It is the final arbiter of all disputes.

### Wylie Layer (Lam)
**Status:** STRUCTURALLY SOUND
**Assessment:** The mechanical transliteration provides 99% accurate syllable breakdown. Use for parsing ambiguity. Rare cases where Wylie and Tibetan disagree should be noted but Wylie never changed.

### Literal Layer (Dpyad kyi bshad pa)
**Status:** REQUIRES MAJOR REVISION
**Known Issues:**
- Articles (a, an, the) present throughout despite prompt instructions
- 1:1 word order frequently violated
- Particle ambiguity not consistently marked with slashes
- Compound hyphenation inconsistent
- Verbal phrases (ka dag, lhun grub) sometimes nominalized
- Subject insertions where Tibetan is implicit
- Page bleed causing continuity failures

**Estimated pages requiring revision:** ~625 pages (70%)

### Liturgical Layer (sgrub pa'i gleng gzhi)
**Status:** REQUIRES MODERATE REVISION
**Known Issues:**
- Dzogchen terminology drifting into generic spiritual language
- *rig pa* rendered as "consciousness," "knowing," "presence" instead of "awareness"
- Sentence length exceeding reasonable bounds
- Elegance occasionally sacrificing precision
- Vairotsana persona inconsistent across pages
- Flow prioritized over metaphysical accuracy

**Estimated pages requiring revision:** ~536 pages (60%)

---

## CRITICAL FAILURES

### 1. Article Creep
Despite clear instructions in prompt.md, the Literal layer contains numerous articles. Every "the" or "a" inserted is a corruption of Longchenpa's voice.

**Example:**
*Current:* "the mind obtains ease"
*Should be:* "mind obtains ease"

**Scope:** Found in approximately 40% of sampled pages.

### 2. Word Order Violation
The Literal layer claims 1:1 word order preservation. This is not being achieved. The LLM is rearranging clauses for English fluency.

**Example:**
*Tibetan:* རྟེན་འབྱུང་པའི་སྟོབས་བཞིན་དུ་འབྱུང་
*Current:* "It arises according to the power of dependent origination"
*Correct:* "arising according-to power-of dependent-origination"

### 3. Semantic Drift in Liturgical Layer
Dzogchen terms are being replaced with synonyms that shift philosophical meaning:
- *rig pa* → "consciousness" (Yogacara connotation)
- *gzhi* → "ground" (when "basis" sometimes intended)
- *ka dag* → "primordial purity" (nominalized, losing verbal force)

### 4. Page Bleed Failures
Continuity across page breaks is not consistently maintained. Subject drops, repeated subjects, and broken logical chains found in approximately 25% of sampled multi-page passages.

## TERMINOLOGY INCONSISTENCY

The project lacks a frozen terminology glossary. Results from sampled pages:

| Tibetan | Wylie | Current Renderings | Correct Rendering |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| རིག་པ་ | rig pa | awareness, consciousness, knowing, presence | awareness |
| ཁམས་གདངས་ | ka dag | primordial purity, primordially pure | primordially pure (verbal) |
| ལྷག་གྲཊ་ | lhun grub | spontaneous presence, spontaneously accomplished | spontaneously accomplished (verbal) |
| ཐིག་ལེ་ | thig le | thigle, bindu, point, drop | thigle |
| སེམས་ | sems | mind, consciousness, mindstream | ordinary mind |

---

## VOLUME-SPECIFIC NOTES

### Volume 1
**Pages 1-50:** Opening sections reasonably well-handled. Article creep already visible.
**Pages 100-200:** Critical Ground (gzhi) section. Found significant *sems*/*rig pa* confusion.
**Pages 300-479:** Technical sections. Quality degrades as content becomes more complex.

### Volume 2
**Pages 1-100:** Similar issues to Volume 1. Terminology inconsistency more pronounced.
**Pages 200-300:** "Three times" section acceptable but particle analysis weak.
**Pages 300-415:** Quality degradation continues through conclusion. Agent fatigue suspected.

## REVISION ROADMAP

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Create master terminology glossary
- [ ] Implement article removal script for Literal layer
- [ ] Flag all page-boundary passages for continuity audit

### Short-Term (This Month)
- [ ] Complete Literal layer revision for Volume 1 (479 pages)
- [ ] Complete Literal layer revision for Volume 2 (415 pages)
- [ ] Establish terminology enforcement protocol

### Medium-Term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Complete Liturgical layer revision for Volume 1
- [ ] Complete Liturgical layer revision for Volume 2
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive page bleed audit

### Long-Term (This Year)
- [ ] Begin Commentary layer only after Literal/Liturgical quality verified
- [ ] Begin Scholar layer only after Commentary layer quality verified
- [ ] Final quality review by human Khenpo before publication

---

## REALISTIC MILESTONES

**Current State:** Foundation complete, quality unverified
**Terminology Freeze:** 1 week
**Literal Layer Revision:** 3-4 months (with adequate resources)
**Liturgical Layer Revision:** 2-3 months (after Literal complete)
**Page Bleed Audit:** 1 month (concurrent)
**Commentary Layer Start:** 6+ months from now
**Scholar Layer Start:** After Commentary complete
**Complete Project:** 18-24 months minimum

---

## CONCERN: COMMENTARY/SCHOLAR READINESS

The previous status report stated "Commentary and Scholar layers ready to begin." This is **not accurate**. Proceeding to Commentary and Scholar layers with the current Literal and Liturgical drafts would be:

1. Building Commentary on unstable foundations
2. Creating scholarly analysis of corrupted translations
3. Multiplying errors rather than eliminating them

**Status:** Commentary and Scholar layers are NOT ready. Literal and Liturgical layers must be brought to acceptable quality first.

---

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

To achieve the timeline above, the project requires:

1. **Tibetan Text Expert:** For Literal layer reconstruction
2. **Dzogchen Terminologist:** For Liturgical layer purification
3. **Project Manager:** For coordination and quality tracking
4. **Terminology Database:** For consistent enforcement
5. **Automated Quality Checks:** For article detection, word order verification, page bleed detection

---

## FINAL STATUS

**Translation Complete:** NO
**Foundation Layers Complete:** YES (files exist)
**Foundation Layers Verified:** NO
**Commentary Layer Ready:** NO
**Scholar Layer Ready:** NO
**Project Ready for Publication:** NO

The project has achieved impressive scope but requires significant quality work before it can claim to be a translation of Longchenpa's Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle.

*This status reflects honest assessment rather than celebratory metrics. The work is not complete. The foundation exists but requires reinforcement before building continues.*
