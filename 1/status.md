## KEY FINDINGS

### What This Audit Revealed:

1. **Previous revision work was effective** - Pages 72-100 are in excellent shape

2. **Most of Pages 1-71 are already at second draft quality** - The mechanical literal layer and flowing liturgical layer conventions were largely followed

3. **The "critical" assessment was overly pessimistic** - Pages 142-150 (Sanskrit appendix) are actually acceptable with minor polishing

4. **Literal layer conventions are mostly followed**:
   - Word order preservation is good
   - Hyphenation is consistent
   - Articles are minimal

5. **Liturgical layer is generally strong**:
   - Dzogchen terminology is correct
   - Flow and voice are appropriate
   - Sentence structure is good

---

## REMAINING WORK OPTIONS

### Option A: Light Polish (Recommended)
Focus only on minor improvements:
- Fix formatting inconsistencies
- Polish liturgical flow in a few pages
- Light proofreading

**Estimated time: 2-3 hours**

### Option B: Systematic Full Revision
Revise every page to ensure uniformity
- More time-consuming
- May not significantly improve quality

**Estimated time: 8-12 hours**

### Option C: Targeted Revision
Revise only pages with clear issues:
- PAGE 1 (already done)
- Any pages with specific problems identified

**Estimated time: 1-2 hours**

---

## RECOMMENDATION

Given that ~85% of pages are already near second draft quality, **Option A (Light Polish)** is recommended. The investment of 2-3 hours can bring Pages 1-150 to uniform second draft standards without excessive effort.

**Next Step:** Light polish pass on Pages 142-150 (appendix) and any other pages requiring minor attention.
