## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The 25-Line Truncation Pattern

**Discovery:** Initial batch generation silently capped output at ~25 lines per file

**Impact:** 
- 22/415 files in Volume 2 (5%)
- 350+ lines of critical teachings missing
- Pages with 30-120 Tibetan lines had only 25 literal lines

**Resolution:**
- Line-by-line manual repair
- Complete translation of missing content
- Full adherence to prompt.md constraints

## LESSONS LEARNED

### The Value of Polishing Pass
1. **File count ≠ Content completeness**
2. **Silent failures** in batch generation require systematic audit
3. **Line-by-line verification** essential for transmission-quality work
4. **Pattern analysis** reveals systematic vs. random errors

### Critical Discoveries:
- Systematic 25-line truncation in Volume 2
- Crystal example teachings severely truncated (76-78% missing)
- Seven introductions method incomplete
- Boundary divisions truncated mid-content

### Resolution Success:
- All 22 files repaired
- 350+ lines restored
- Core transmission secure
- Project 98% complete

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Optional):
1. **Downstream layer spot-check:** Verify liturgical/commentary/scholar layers for continuity with repaired literal content
2. **Excess lines audit:** 4 files have 2x Tibetan line count (potential duplication)

### Final Polish (Optional):
3. **MiniMax M2.1 pass:** Final refinement of literal/liturgical layers
4. **Cross-layer consistency:** Verify terminology and line references

### Publication Preparation:
5. **Format for print/digital:** Layout design, typography
6. **Index and cross-references:** Navigation aids for 9-layer structure
7. **Final blessing:** Khenpo approval for transmission

## CONCLUSION

**The polishing pass is complete.** All critical deficiencies in the Volume 2 Literal layer have been identified and repaired. The systematic 25-line truncation pattern has been eliminated, preserving **350+ lines of essential Dzogchen teachings** including:

- Crystal example pointing-out instructions (theg mchog mdzod's heart teaching)
- Seven methods of introduction
- Body/speech/mind boundary divisions
