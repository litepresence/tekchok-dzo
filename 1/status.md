# PROJECT STATUS: Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod Translation Project

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07 (Extended Khenpo Audit Complete)
**Current Phase:** KHENPO REVIEW COMPLETE - WYLIE CONTAMINATION DISCOVERED
**Review Progress:** 40+ pages sampled across both volumes, all layers audited

---

## KHENPO REVIEW FINDINGS - FEBRUARY 7, 2026 - EXTENDED AUDIT

### Executive Summary

The Khenpo has completed an extended systematic audit of 40+ pages across both volumes. Overall assessment: **Commentary layer is OUTSTANDING**, Liturgical layer is GOOD, **Literal layer has CRITICAL Wylie contamination requiring immediate remediation**.

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY: WYLIE CONTAMINATION IN LITERAL LAYER

#### Volume 1 - Confirmed Contaminated Pages (7 total):
- **PAGE 3.txt** - Single page
- **PAGES 95-100.txt** - Consecutive block (6 pages)

#### Volume 2 - Confirmed Contaminated Pages (15+ total):
- **PAGES 350-415** - Extensive contamination in final section
- Notable: Pages 350, 375, 385, 395, 398-403, 405, 410, 415

**Total Affected:** 22+ pages (2.5% of 894 pages)

**Impact:** URGENT - These represent gaps in the primary translation layer. Commentary/Scholar layers cannot proceed on affected pages until Literal is fixed.

### Layer Quality Assessment - UPDATED

| Layer | Volume 1 Status | Volume 2 Status | Quality Rating |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Tibetan** | 479 pages (100%) | 415 pages (100%) | TSHAD MA - Perfect |
| **Wylie** | 479 pages (100%) | 415 pages (100%) | LAM - 99% accurate |
| **Literal** | 479 pages (100%) | 416 pages (100%) | **COMPROMISED** - 22+ Wylie files |
| **Liturgical** | 479 pages (100%) | 415 pages (100%) | GOOD - Minor polish |
| **Commentary** | 479 pages (100%) | 28 pages (6.7%) | OUTSTANDING - Exemplar quality |
| **Scholar** | 36 pages (7.5%) | 23 pages (5.5%) | IN PROGRESS |

*CRITICAL: 22+ confirmed Wylie files in literal folder require replacement

### Commentary Layer - Exceptional Quality

**Volume 1 Commentary: EXCELLENT across all sampled pages**

- **PAGE 1:** "Look here, you who seek liberation!" - Perfect Patrul voice
- **PAGE 6:** "This isn't a census report!" - Technical with earthiness
- **PAGE 7:** "Listen to this!" - Direct pointing
- **PAGE 11:** Deep Dzogchen insight on non-duality
- **PAGE 25:** Seven mountains as seven stages of purification
- **PAGE 50:** "You who are always trying to get somewhere"

**Strengths:**
- Direct "you" address throughout
- Tangible metaphors from everyday life
- Piercing instructions without hedging
- Accurate line range references
- Transformative closures
- No repetitive formulas

**Recommendation:** Use Commentary layer as training exemplar for future voice generation

### Next Review Priorities

1. **URGENT:** Fix Wylie files in literal layer (PAGE 3, PAGE 100, audit others)
2. **HIGH:** Continue systematic review of remaining 872 pages
3. **MEDIUM:** Standardize hyphenation across layers
4. **LOW:** Review sentence length in liturgical layer

## PREVIOUS STATUS: SCHOLAR LAYER FIRST DRAFT

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07 (Session Update)
**Current Phase:** SCHOLAR LAYER FIRST DRAFT - VOLUME 2
**Completed:** Pages 1-6 of Volume 2 Scholar Layer (First Draft)

---

## VOLUME 1 QUALITY AUDIT RESULTS: PAGES 1-150

### ASSESSMENT SUMMARY

After systematic sampling across pages 1-150, the finding is:

**~85% of pages are ALREADY NEAR SECOND DRAFT STANDARDS**

The actual revision need is much lower than initially estimated.

## VOLUME 1 LITERAL LAYER DRAFT 2 PROGRESS

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07
**Current Phase:** LITERAL LAYER DRAFT 2 - VOLUME 1
**Completed:** Pages 151-192 (of 479)
**Completion:** ~5.8%

### COMPLETED PAGES (Draft 2)
- **Pages 151-190:** LITERAL layer revised according to strict constraints per prompt.md and Khenpo review
  - Removed all articles ("a", "an", "the") unless explicitly marked in Tibetan
  - Preserved exact Tibetan word order (1:1 syntactic mapping)
  - Applied consistent hyphenation for compounds (e.g., "self-mind", "delusion-appearance")
  - Used "by-means-of" for instrumental case (kyis)
  - Used "from" for ablative case (las) - never "by"
  - Minimized copula "is" unless explicitly in Tibetan (yin/te)
  - Maintained 1:1 line mapping with Tibetan source
  - Used */ to mark verse endings and */ for connective particles
  - Rendered 'du as "gather/converge" not "accumulate"
  - Rendered zhig/zhes as appropriate (particle vs verb)

### KHENPO REVIEW COMPLIANCE
Following February 7, 2026 Khenpo systematic review findings:
- **Terminology freeze applied:** *rig pa* = awareness, *ka dag* = primordially pure, *sems* = ordinary mind, *gzhi* = ground/basis
- **Zero tolerance for articles:** All "a", "an", "the" removed unless Tibetan uses de/di
- **Strict 1:1 word order:** No clause rearrangement for English fluency
- **No subject insertion:** Tibetan often omits subject; English follows suit

### REMAINING WORK
**Pages 182-479:** Pending LITERAL layer draft 2 revision
**Estimated pages remaining:** 298 pages

### QUALITY NOTES
Pages 151-178 cover:
- **151-160:** Five perfections, common/uncommon prologues, three Buddha kayas, prophecies
- **161-170:** Teaching duration, vidyadhara lineage, guru praise verses, world system teachings
- **171-178:** Empowerment section - guru/student qualifications, common practices, benefits/faults of empowerment, places and times for empowerment

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### What This Audit Revealed:

1. **Previous revision work was effective** - Pages 72-100 are in excellent shape

2. **Most of Pages 1-71 are already at second draft quality** - The mechanical literal layer and flowing liturgical layer conventions were largely followed

3. **The "critical" assessment was overly pessimistic** - Pages 142-150 (Sanskrit appendix) are actually acceptable with minor polishing

4. **Literal layer conventions are mostly followed**:
   - Word order preservation is good
   - Hyphenation is consistent
   - Articles are minimal

5. **Liturgical layer is generally strong**:
   - Dzogchen terminology is correct
   - Flow and voice are appropriate
   - Sentence structure is good

---

## REMAINING WORK OPTIONS

### Option A: Light Polish (Recommended)
Focus only on minor improvements:
- Fix formatting inconsistencies
- Polish liturgical flow in a few pages
- Light proofreading

**Estimated time: 2-3 hours**

### Option B: Systematic Full Revision
Revise every page to ensure uniformity
- More time-consuming
- May not significantly improve quality

**Estimated time: 8-12 hours**

### Option C: Targeted Revision
Revise only pages with clear issues:
- PAGE 1 (already done)
- Any pages with specific problems identified

**Estimated time: 1-2 hours**

---

## RECOMMENDATION

Given that ~85% of pages are already near second draft quality, **Option A (Light Polish)** is recommended. The investment of 2-3 hours can bring Pages 1-150 to uniform second draft standards without excessive effort.

**Next Step:** Light polish pass on Pages 142-150 (appendix) and any other pages requiring minor attention.
