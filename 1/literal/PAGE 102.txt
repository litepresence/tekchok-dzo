[3764] From the action of not-explaining the great expanse, the white space and

[3765] From the union of view and meditation, the two white spaces:

[3766] The first is:
[3767] The essence is liberated by seeing the nature.
[3768] The abiding is self-purified.

[3769] When divided:
[3770] The ocean’s space and
[3771] The two spaces of sky—
[3772] The ocean’s space’s essence is timelessly self-liberated,
[3773] Liberated by non-action, liberation through liberation.
[3774] It is without the two extremes.

[3775] When divided, there are two:
[3776] The ocean’s space, great and small.
[3777] The first:
[3778] The mind’s self-abiding emptiness is spontaneously liberated,
[3779] The mind’s emptiness, when relied upon, is thoroughly purified,
[3780] The self-purified dharmatā of appearance and emptiness is not to be expressed,
[3781] Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness’s exhaustion, it is empty,
[3782] By emptiness, nowhere is attainment possible—this is the intent.

[3783] The small ocean’s space:
[3784] By reliance being self-purified, the mind is without stain,
[3785] By particulars abiding in purity, the conditions are not to be expressed—this is the intent.

[3786] The sky’s space’s essence:
[3787] Dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated.

[3788] When divided, there are three:
[3789] The sun-and-moon space and
[3790] The two white spaces of the jewel—
[3791] The first:
[3792] The essence is utterly pure emptiness,
[3793] The self-nature is unborn, spontaneously liberated.

[3794] The second:
[3795] Qualities being completely perfected, the causes and conditions are self-purified,
[3796] By non-action toward the mind, dharmatā is spontaneously accomplished—this is the intent regarding causes and conditions being self-purified.

[3797] The essence of the infinite space’s expanse, when appearing to the mind, is known,
[3798] When not appearing, it is known by the mode of abiding.

[3799] When divided, there are three:
[3800] The infinite space free from action,
[3801] The infinite space of the view’s own position,
[3802] The infinite space of the secret’s radiance,
[3803] The infinite space of that-which-is itself—these are the four infinite spaces.

[3804] The first:
[3805] By being causeless, there is no reversal—this is the key point,
[3806] By being conditionless, whatever appears in this way is not harmed—this is the key point,
[3807] By the two, cause and condition, being absent, samsara and nirvana are not attained anywhere—this is the key point.

[3808] Also, by being uncontrived toward the mind, the dharma’s activity is the key point of the non-transcendent non-abiding.
