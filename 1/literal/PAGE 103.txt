[3809] By-means-of mind without cause-and-sign, the object-of-desire is that-which is non-dual.

[3810] The second is:

[3811] By-means-of not-relying-on the nine vehicles, the exertion-of-progression is abandoned, thus

[3812] Although appearances arise in manifold, liberation is from one—not-ceased self-nature arising, so-called.

[3813] That also, the ultimate of the perfect completion stage’s accomplishment is:

[3814] Self-appearance, directionless, all-pervasively self-arising,

[3815] Whatever is not-rejected is completely perfected,

[3816] The basis-of-all-phenomena’s basis, in whatever direction, is not-exceeded.

[3817] Dharmatā arising in manifold, even in India, is not-exhausted.

[3818] The third is:

[3819] Appearance, by-means-of being drawn-into mind, the rays of self-awareness clearly manifest,

[3820] Appearance not-rejected, completely perfected,

[3821] The rays of mind’s continuity, by-means-of recollection-and-meditation clearly manifest, recollection-and-meditation perfected in dharmatā, thus continuity emptied, purified, so-called.

[3822] Perception-and-awareness entering, by-means-of non-dual relation’s severance, saṃsāra’s essence completely liberated, so-called.

[3823] Desire self-arising’s great perfection is:

[3824] By-means-of view not-being, beyond conceptual-imputation,
[3825] By-means-of meditation not-being, without acceptance/rejection/negation/establishment,
[3826] By-means-of conduct not-being, action liberated in dharmatā,
[3827] By-means-of result not-being, non-attainment abides in itself.

[3828] Among those, when analyzed:

[3829] Enumeration is beyond measure.

[3830] The spreading-of-key-points, that itself’s vast compassion is:

[3831] Saṃsāra-and-nirvāṇa’s dharmas, arising in perception-and-awareness’s kāya and jñāna, saṃsāra-and-nirvāṇa wherever not-divided dharmatā, so-called.

[3832] That also, by-means-of the non-changing mark’s perception-and-awareness dual-proliferation, saṃsāra is reversed.

[3833] Self-face clearly-seen’s key-point, by-means-of recollection-and-meditation self/other proliferation, thought completely purified, so-called.

[3834] By-means-of outer-and-inner object’s non-existence, bliss non-conceptual, awakening, so-called.

[3835] By-means-of being free-from action, mind liberated,

[3836] By-means-of self-knowing investigation, bliss-and-suffering equal-taste, so-called.

[3837] Those also, when gathered, are collected into three.
