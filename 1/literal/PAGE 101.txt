[3731] Free-from affirmation/negation, free-from direction-fixation, and free-from connection—

[3732] That-which is without reliance on self-nature, without cause, is primordial-purity.

[3733] By-means-of being without reliance on fabrication, by-means-of primordial-liberation, the expansion of the resting-place of liberation is set-forth.

[3734] The great primordial-wisdom of self-purified abiding, by-means-of liberation, is called "self-basis exhaustion."

[3735] That also, by-means-of the reasoning of deluded-mind engagement, is intended as self-liberation.

[3736] The essence is the nature-of-khra-bo.

[3737] Regarding affirmation of a multitude:

[3738] Free-from negation, free-from direction, self-arising everywhere—

[3739] In activity, non-affirmation/non-negation is intended.

[3740] Divided, there are three:

[3741] Affirmation-of-existence corresponds to the mind-school, the khra-bo school.
[3742] Affirmation-of-non-existence corresponds to the self-key-point, the khra-bo school.
[3743] Affirmation-of-existence-and-non-existence corresponds to the supreme-instruction, the khra-bo school.

[3744] First:
[3745] The self-purified abiding, wherever not divided, by-means-of not being established as affirmation/negation, transcends the effort of conceptual-construction.

[3746] By-means-of being without duality in characteristic, it does not depart from the single wheel of mind-existence.

[3747] By-means-of that very activity being unceasingly radiant—

[3748] It is called "liberation of the two, appearance-and-mind."

[3749] That also, by-means-of the reasoning of thought-free self-nature, is intended as the activity of primordial-liberation, the dissolution of the circle, from one's own ground.

[3750] Second:
[3751] By-means-of the self-nature of appearance-and-emptiness being liberated from one's own ground, the dharmatā of mind is radiantly displayed in a multitude.

[3752] By-means-of liberation from appearance-and-non-appearance from one's own ground, freedom from virtue-and-non-virtue in action is intended.

[3753] That also, by-means-of the reasoning of transformation-into-emptiness, establishes non-appearance as self-purified.

[3754] Third:
[3755] By-means-of self-emptiness being primordial-purity, it does not rely on action's cause-and-effect.

[3756] By-means-of fabrication, it arises.

[3757] By-means-of arising as emptiness, it liberates the circle in all directions.

[3758] By-means-of appearance-and-concept being ground, the reasoning of non-attainment of the circle's arising is displayed.

[3759] By-means-of being inexpressible, it is the key-point of being free-from thought.

[3760] By-means-of being without comparison, it is the key-point of being free-from meditation.

[3761] By-means-of liberation from the two of abiding-and-transformation, it is the key-point of mind being free-from transformation, and by-means-of these three, the dissolution of the circle's essence is intended.

[3762] The essence of the white ākāśa, by-means-of self-liberation of appearance-and-cause, is without activity, the primordial-basis, and is not to-be-established in abiding-ways.
