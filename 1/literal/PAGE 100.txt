[3693] The expanse that-is-without-speaking-about dharmatā, and

[3694] the expanse that-is-without-view, and

[3695] the expanse that-is-without-being-an-object-of-engagement—

[3696] /one-hundred-and-eighty-six-thousand-and-six/

[3697] are three emanations:

[3698] the emanation that-is-ground-primordially-pervaded, and

[3699] the emanation that-is-appearance-self-liberated, and

[3700] the emanation that-is-dharmatā-signlessness-non-duality.

[3701] /The five-hundred nails that-do-not-enter-into dharmatā, and

[3702] the one-hundred-and-eleven bonds that-bind object-mind,

[3703] the two essential-points that-clarify appearance-mind in whatever-way,

[3704] the five-hundred-thousand views that-are-liberated-in-the-sphere-of-primordial-purity,

[3705] the one-hundred-thousand essential-points that-sever-conceptual-construction-in-meditation—
these, in the three: name-signless-continuum, emptiness-continuum, and the threefold-abiding, are also established.

[3706] The grasping-of-mind’s-directions, and

[3707] the grasping-of-mind’s-vehicles, and

[3708] the grasping-of-mind’s-essential-points—
these-three are gathered.

[3709] /The second, the great perfection of the emanation of primordial-liberation’s fruition, the essence of the space-class is:

[3710] In the non-existence-of-fruition-in-the-manifold-of-existence, the primordial-purity-of-fruition is intended.

[3711] /In this, there-are-four-divisions:

[3712] the black-space that-is-spoken-of-as-causeless, and

[3713] the variegated that-is-spoken-of-as-manifold, and

[3714] the white that-is-spoken-of-as-mind, and

[3715] the vast-yellow that-is-applied-to-cause-and-fruition.

[3716] /The essence of the black-space is:

[3717] By-means-of emanating as unchanging, self-perfected, directionless, it-is-not-bound-to-phenomena.

[3718] /The divisions are:
the space-class of activity,
[3719] the space-class of compassion,
[3720] the space-class of emanation—
from these three,

[3721] the first is:
[3722] By-means-of emanating as causeless in the manifold-of-existence, appearance arises as signless.

[3723] /And that, by-means-of emanating from the existence-sphere as emptiness and liberating from the appearance-sphere, is the signless saṃsāra-and-nirvāṇa.

[3724] /And that, by-means-of the definitive-sign of non-abiding-in-either-extreme, is the great perfection of the view that-is-beyond-conceptual-elaboration.

[3725] /The second is:

[3726] By-means-of emanation being primordial-awareness, it-is-not-dependent-on-other-knowledge;
[3727] by-means-of liberation being mind, it-applies-to-causes-and-conditions;
[3728] by-means-of emanation-and-liberation being non-dual, it-is-the-primordial-liberation-of-fruition.

[3729] /And that, by-means-of the definitive-sign of spontaneous-presence-and-appearance, is the great perfection of liberation from the appearance-sphere.

[3730] /The third is:
