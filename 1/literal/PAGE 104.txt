[3838] The space free-from action, by-means-of not-doing, is liberated into the dharmatā of self-liberation.

[3839] By-means-of actionlessness, liberation is liberation.

[3840] Thus it is said.

[3841] The space of ornament is:
[3842] Appearance is the continuity of mind,
[3843] The ornament free-from the grasping of mind-as-empty is called.

[3844] Furthermore,
[3845] Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived.

[3846] Thus it is said.

[3847] The space of play is:
[3848] The play without direction, unceasing, arises,
[3849] The transformation of appearance-and-mind does not occur, thus it is called.

[3850] Furthermore,
[3851] For the sake of liberating all into the completely pure path.

[3852] Thus it is said.

[3853] The space of dharmatā is:
[3854] By-means-of abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not,
[3855] The basis is uncontrived emptiness, thus seeing-and-knowing are non-dual.

[3856] Furthermore,
[3857] The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond.

[3858] Thus it is said.

[3859] The section distinguishing the threefold teaching, the supreme complete teaching of the path that is the distinctive feature, is:
[3860] The essential point of the path is the essential point of entering the essence, like a spark striking flint.

[3861] This is divided into three:
[3862] Taught in the manner of oral transmission,
[3863] Taught in the manner of symbolic instruction,
[3864] Taught in the manner of self-arisen tantric scripture.

[3865] Among these, the essence of oral transmission is:
[3866] The path of action, beyond the intellect, is practiced.

[3867] The division is:
[3868] The instruction of the path that cuts the extremes of fixation,
[3869] The two instructions of the path that manifest the confidence of liberation and the purity of means.

[3870] The first is:
[3871] At the time of the all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, by-means-of not-relying, the time of distinguishing from the basis.

[3872] Even the mere word of elaboration is not established,
[3873] The elaboration of designation does not exist,
[3874] In the dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter, thus it is said.

[3875] By-means-of the reason of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted,
[3876] The ultimate meaning of cessation.

[3877] The second is:
[3878] From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur,
[3879] At the time of the three kāyas appearing on the path,
[3880] Whatever is not liberated does not exist,
[3881] At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.

[3882] The essence of symbolic instruction is the non-deluded, thought-free.
