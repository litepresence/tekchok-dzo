[3883] Self-nature—thought-construction grasping cessation.

[3884] Characteristic—duality-free, essence-grasping-free.

[3885] When divided, twofold:

[3886] The debate that is exhausted in the extreme of assertion,
[3887] The debate that is exhausted in the extreme of refutation—timeless.

[3888] The first is:
[3889] By-means-of the vital-point’s wind abiding in the channel, the mind’s own striving through the instruction—from the expanse of dharmatā, the activity of averting harm and
[3890] By-means-of that spreading, the vital-point of severing the debate between buddhas and sentient beings and
[3891] By-means-of the wind’s vital-point descending into the body, the vital-point of severing the connection between body and mind and
[3892] By-means-of the root-wind being exhausted in the extreme, the vital-point of self-liberation of arising.

[3893] The second is:
[3894] By-means-of the expanse’s vast essence—never departing anywhere—the pervasion of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa and
[3895] By-means-of essence-grasping-free in dharmadhātu’s emptiness, the essence of the transformation of phenomena and
[3896] By-means-of action-free in the expanse, that-which-is-called self-arisen wisdom.

[3897] The essence of the self-arising mantra’s instruction—all command’s source—is clear in the arising-ground.

[3898] The unique is cut by the axe of chöd.

[3899] By-means-of non-duality in self-nature, the cessation of saṃsāra’s reliance and
[3900] By-means-of characteristic not-established as word/letter,
[3901] Emptiness is free from the ground of debate.

[3902] When divided, fourfold:
[3903] The manner of proclaiming through the method of view’s thorough investigation and
[3904] The manner of proclaiming through the method of example’s complete clarification and
[3905] The manner of proclaiming through the method of direct experience’s arising and
[3906] The manner of proclaiming through the method of self-clarifying explanation.

[3907] The first is:
[3908] By-means-of pervading the unelaborated essence-ground,
[3909] Action—good/bad-free, the three realms’ complete liberation and
[3910] By-means-of self-nature’s emptiness arising in all aspects, action—virtue/non-virtue not abandoning, buddhas and sentient beings are non-existent.

[3911] By-means-of characteristic not-established as word/letter, the dharma of all vehicles—by-means-of not being limited—is the vital-point of the single sovereign’s path.

[3912] When divided, the view that clings to appearance/concept—non-arising and
[3913] The investigation of mind’s realization—all doubts are released, twofold.

[3914] The first is:
