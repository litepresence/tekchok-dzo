## QUALITY METRICS

| Metric | Before | After | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Generic openings | 69 files | 0 files | 0 | ✅ |
| Synthetic markers | 8 files | 0 files | 0 | ✅ |
| Line number errors | 6 files | 0 files | 0 | ✅ |
| Four Pillars coverage | 93.4% | 93.4% | 100% | ~ |
| Files >30 lines | 85.9% | 85.9% | 100% | ~ |

**Note:** Four Pillars coverage and file length were not modified per user instructions ("don't create fluff"). Files with <4 pillars or <30 lines are intentionally concise but high-quality.

grep -r "END OF PAGE" text/dynamic/scholar/01-*.txt | wc -l
# Expected: 0

# Verify byte count
du -sb text/dynamic/scholar/
# Expected: ~3822692
```
