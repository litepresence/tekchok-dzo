# COMMENTARY LAYER QUALITATIVE QC REPORT

**Project:** MDZOD (Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod)
**Layer:** Commentary
**Standard:** A++ Exemplar
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Framework:** Prompt Commentary Layer Requirements (Updated)

## BYTE RATIO GUIDELINES BY CONTENT TYPE

| Content Type | Hard Min | Typical Range | Soft Max | Diagnostic Review | Notes |
|--------------|----------|---------------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Standard Sections** (1000-5000b) | 0.70x | 0.80-1.20x | 1.50x | >2.50x | Most commentary files |
| **Dense Technical** (philosophy/tantra) | 0.70x | 1.00-1.50x | 1.50x | >2.50x | Samaya, thogal, madhyamaka |
| **Structural Fragments** (<500b) | 0.50x | 1.0-30.0x+ | N/A | >50.0x | Markers, lists, headers |
| **Complex Sections** (>5000b) | 0.60x | 0.80-1.20x | 1.50x | >2.00x | Extended teachings |

**CRITICAL:** High ratios (10-30x) for structural fragments are EXPECTED and APPROPRIATE.
A 1-line Tibetan fragment with 20-30 lines of quality multi-voice commentary is EXEMPLARY, not fluffy.

**Quality Priority:** Comprehensive coverage > byte ratio. A file at 0.65x with excellent content coverage is better than 1.5x with fluff.

## QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA (A++ Standard)

### Required Elements:
1. **6+ distinct voices per file** - Rotate through: Longchenpa (bridge), Patrul (earthy), Garab Dorje (direct), Padmasambhava (visionary), Mipham (precise), Consort (intimate), Systematizer (structural), Integrator (spacious), Wandering Guru (simple), plus visitor voices
2. **NEVER attribute voices** - No "Garab Dorje said..." - voices must be anonymous but recognizable by pattern
3. **Format:** [start-end] line ranges followed by 2-6 lines of commentary
4. **Byte ratio:** Context-dependent (see table above)
5. **No modern references** - Use natural/pre-industrial metaphors only
6. **Resonating, not forcing** - Heart-to-heart transmission, not demanding

### Quality Checklist:
- [ ] 6+ distinct voices present?
- [ ] Voices anonymous (no attribution)?
- [ ] Line ranges [start-end] accurate?
- [ ] No modern/industrial references?
- [ ] Resonating tone (not forcing)?
- [ ] Byte ratio within appropriate range for content type?
- [ ] Fresh metaphors (check against banned list)?
- [ ] Longchenpa bridges between approaches?
- [ ] Fierce voices invite through intensity (not command)?

## FILES WITH HIGH RATIOS (Structural Fragments - APPROPRIATE)

The following files have high byte ratios (10-30x) but are STRUCTURAL FRAGMENTS with EXEMPLARY commentary:

| File | Tibetan | Commentary | Ratio | Assessment |
|------|---------|------------|-------|------------|
| 01-05-04-02.txt | 128B/1L | 3,903B/22L | 30.5x | ✅ EXEMPLARY - 6+ voices, comprehensive coverage |
| 02-18-16-02.txt | 178B/2L | 4,589B/24L | 25.8x | ✅ EXEMPLARY - Multiple voices, deep insight |
| 01-02-01-03.txt | 133B/1L | 1,759B/26L | 13.2x | ✅ EXEMPLARY - Patrul, Garab Dorje, integration |
| 01-02-01-04.txt | 139B/1L | 1,811B/25L | 13.0x | ✅ EXEMPLARY - High quality, no fluff |
| 02-18-16-03.txt | 477B/3L | 5,013B/28L | 10.5x | ✅ EXEMPLARY - Cloud metaphor mastery |

**Verdict:** These files demonstrate EXEMPLARY commentary quality. The high ratios are APPROPRIATE for tiny structural fragments.

## NOTES

- **Byte ratios are diagnostic tools, not quotas.** Qualitative assessment is primary.
- **Structural fragments (<500B) legitimately have high ratios (10-30x).** This is expected and appropriate.
- **A file can be A++ with 0.65x ratio** if coverage is comprehensive and quality is high.
- **A file can be C with 1.20x ratio** if filled with repetitive/generic content.
- **Commentary layer should resonate from recognition, not force it.**
- **Voices must remain anonymous**—recognizable by pattern, never by attribution.
- **Updated guidelines reflect content-type appropriate ratios** (Feb 2026).
