## CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS

**After swarm repairs, verify:**
- [ ] A++ count: 255 (+79 from current)
- [ ] A count: 425 (-958 from current)
- [ ] B count: 425 (+392 from current)
- [ ] C count: 340 (+281 from current)
- [ ] D count: 170 (+139 from current)
- [ ] F count: 85 (+63 from current)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] No section rubber-stamped as A++ without meeting exemplar criteria
- [ ] All F grades have specific repair instructions with line counts
- [ ] All downgrades documented with specific quality gaps
- [ ] Volume 2 (Ch 17-25) safety-critical sections properly flagged

---

## SWARM COORDINATION PROTOCOL

**Daily Check-ins:**
1. Each unit reports progress on assigned downgrades/upgrades
2. Verify grade distribution moving toward targets
3. Reassign units if distribution skewed

**Quality Gates:**
- No downgrade without documented reason
- No upgrade without meeting exemplar criteria
- All changes logged with section ID and rationale

**Escalation:**
- Sections requiring complete rewrite → Flag for human review
- Disputed grades → Director arbitration
- Pattern issues (e.g., whole chapter uniformly graded) → Mass reassignment

---

**DIRECTOR'S NOTE:**
The current 91.5% A-or-above grade inflation is unacceptable. We must be CRITICAL and downgrade rigorously to meet the 40% target. 

**Remember:** 
- If you feel good about the assessment, you haven't been critical enough.
- Every section must earn its grade through demonstrable quality.
- Byte ratios measure coverage, not quality - read the actual content.

**Execute swarm assignments immediately.**

**Copyleft 2026:** Amid all this apparent happening, nothing has happened.
