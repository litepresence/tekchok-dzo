## COMMENTARY LAYER EXEMPLARS

### A++ Example: 01-01-01-01 (Opening Section)
**Why A++:** 20+ distinct voices, fresh metaphors, complete line coverage [XXX-XXX]

```
[1-4]
The first word arises from no throat. The path shown to oneself—like a mountain 
revealing itself to the mountain. Samantabhadra offers the vajra to Samantabhadra. 
Who receives? Who gives? The snow on the peak does not know it is white.

[5-11]
Patrul speaks: You read "first Samantabhadra showed the path" and you think this 
happened long ago, in some golden age. You are mistaken. The first word is being 
spoken now, in the gap between your thoughts. The path is not something you walk—it 
is the ground you have never left.

[12-15]
Garab Dorje points: See what is. The first word has no origin because it was never 
not present. The mountain revealing itself to the mountain—this is awareness seeing 
awareness. No gap between knower and known.
```

**A++ Markers:**
- ✅ Voice rotation every 2-3 blocks (Patrul → Garab Dorje)
- ✅ Fresh metaphors (snow on peak, mountain revealing itself)
- ✅ Line ranges precise [1-4], [5-11], [12-15]
- ✅ Direct pointing (not explanation)
- ✅ Anonymous voices (no "Garab Dorje said...")

### A Example: 01-03-01-01
**Why A:** 4+ voices, good metaphors, adequate coverage

```
[1582-1591]
Therefore. Thus. We establish the basis. Five elements. Outer and inner. Two 
categories. All phenomena rest here.

Three words. Elements teach themselves. You do not learn them. You are learned by 
them. Like prayer flags gradually fading in mountain wind—their blessings released, 
their form remaining, then dissolving.

[1592-1606]
The five great elements—earth holds, water binds, fire ripens, wind animates, space 
accommodates. But these are not five separate things. Earth holds like a mother 
cradling her child, water flows like a pilgrim's journey without end...
```

**A Markers:**
- ✅ 4+ voices rotating
- ✅ Good metaphors (prayer flags, pilgrim's journey)
- ✅ Some line gaps but adequate
- ⚠️ Could use 2-3 more voices for A++

## SCHOLAR LAYER EXEMPLARS

### A++ Example: 01-04-12-01
**Why A++:** All Four Pillars balanced, IAST Sanskrit, precise Wylie

```xml
[2836-2848] <structure>
## Two Truths Framework

**Core Teaching:** All phenomena gathered within samsara and nirvana are gathered 
into the self-nature of the two truths.

**Citations:**
- **Root Wisdom (Mūlamadhyamakakārikā):** "Buddhas taught the Dharma, relying 
  correctly upon the two truths: the conventional truth of the world, and the 
  ultimate truth of meaning."
- **Magical Illusion Net Tantra:** "One abides in the manner of the two truths."

[2847-2848] <philology>
**Key Terms:**
- bden pa gnyis: two truths
- kun rdzob: conventional truth  
- don dam: ultimate truth
- bden pa: truth/reality

**Definitions:**
- Conventional truth (kun rdzob bden pa): phenomena marked by characteristics 
  appearing as objects of intellect
- False conventional: appearances that deceive—as if inherently real
```

**A++ Markers:**
- ✅ All Four Pillars present
- ✅ IAST Sanskrit (Mūlamadhyamakakārikā)
- ✅ Wylie with semantic fields
- ✅ Root text citations verified
- ✅ Third person only (no devotional)

## DELUSION LAYER EXEMPLARS

### A++ Example: 02-20-02-01
**Why A++:** Comprehensive cascade analysis with 4-5 levels

```xml
<error-sequence id="DPO-001">
<direct-perception-obstruction>
source-line: 8831-8836
root-delusion: capacity-denial

tibetan-term: rang shar rig pa (self-arising awareness)
critical-misconception: "I cannot recognize because I lack the capacity"

error-chain:
  1. Believing recognition requires special prerequisites
  2. Thinking one must purify before recognition
  3. Assuming recognition is for advanced practitioners only
  4. Waiting for future readiness
  5. Rejecting present awareness as insufficient

cascade-mechanism: |
  The text says "rang shar las" (from self-arising) but the practitioner
  believes self-arising requires preparation. This creates a temporal
  delay where recognition is always postponed to the future.

liberation-point: |
  Recognition is not an achievement but the recognition of what
  already is (ye shes dag pa'i rang snang). The capacity is not
  developed but discovered.

related-lines: [8832, 8834, 8836, 8844, 8850]
tibetan-key-terms: [rang shar, ye shes dag pa, btang bzhag med]
</direct-perception-obstruction>
</error-sequence>
```

**A++ Markers:**
- ✅ 5-level error chain
- ✅ Error-sequence ID for tracking
- ✅ Root-delusion identified
- ✅ Cascade mechanism explained
- ✅ Tibetan terms with context
- ✅ Liberation-point clarity
- ✅ Line range precision

### A++ Example: 02-22-03-01 (Bindu Error Mapping)
**Why A++:** 15+ distinct errors with 4-level cascades

```
[10826-10830] <thig-le-ngo-bo-bindu-nature-reification> <sphere-essence-objectification>

**Misreading:**
The "nature of bindu" (*thig le'i ngo bo*) interpreted as actual spherical object 
with essence, creating bindu-materialization.

**Why it arises:**
"Nature" suggests essence. "Bindu" implies sphere. Objectification: things have 
essences. The practitioner materializes bindu.

**Primary consequence:**
Bindu-materialization: treating thig-le as physical sphere. Natural bindu is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "The bindu is located in my channels"
- Missing that bindu indicates indivisibility
- Sphere-hunting over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-le-ngo-bo-bindu-nature-reification> → <bindu-materialization> [object fixation] 
→ <sphere-hunting> [locating bindu] → <indivisibility-miss> [object over nature]
```

**A++ Markers:**
- ✅ Specific error-type tag from taxonomy
- ✅ 4-level cascade chain
- ✅ Tibetan terms in Wylie
- ✅ Realistic secondary consequences
- ⚠️ Safety-critical context (bindu practice)

## EPISTEMIC LAYER EXEMPLARS

### A++ Example: 01-01-01-01
**Why A++:** Precise view classification every 30-50 lines, specific risk flags

```xml
[1-4]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa</view>
<pedagogy>declarative-finality</pedagogy>
<classification> Title protocol establishing nges don (definitive meaning) register. 
"Theg mchog mdzod" situates text within Atiyoga as apex of nine vehicles—asserting 
direct recognition of awareness-nature over gradualist approaches. Spoken from 
recognition-register as hermeneutical claim, not comparative evaluation.

[5-15]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa</view>
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality</pedagogy>
<risk>reification</risk>
<classification> Homage encoding five perfections onto three bodies framework. 
Fivefold prostration traces Samantabhadra → Five Families → Ocean Teacher → 
Five Vidyādharas → Three Worlds' Ornament. Risk of temporalizing simultaneous 
aspects as sequential attainment.
```

**A++ Markers:**
- ✅ View tags precise (dzogchen-rigpa, not generic)
- ✅ Pedagogy tags specific (declarative-finality)
- ✅ Risk flags contextualized
- ✅ Coverage every 10-15 lines (not 50-100)
- ✅ Zero generic template phrases

## COGNITIVE LAYER EXEMPLARS

### A++ Example: 01-01-01-01
**Why A++:** Calm, settled recognition without teaching

```
[24-27]
Scope declaration establishing this as rnam bshad—exposition, not mere 
explanation. The text names its own function meta-textually. Future oriented 
without promise tone. Translate with weight of intention, not casual description. 
The four-line structure names place, essence, clarification, action. Architectural 
clarity to preserve.

[28-35]
Structural framing via three kāyas. Classification indexing activities, locations, 
displays—not causal narrative. No chronology implied. This seeds later architecture. 
Must remain non-causal in translation. Lists as lists, not sequences. The five 
perfections formula appears here first, will recur. Note for consistency.
```

**A++ Markers:**
- ✅ Calm, non-didactic tone
- ✅ No uncertainty language
- ✅ Recognition of structure (not explanation)
- ✅ Translation risks noted implicitly
- ✅ Varying paragraph length

---

## WYLIE LAYER EXEMPLARS

### A++ Standard
**Ratio:** 0.43-0.55x (ideal range)
**Quality:** 99% accurate mechanical bridge

```
Tibetan: རྩོམ་པ་པོ་ནི་བདག་ཉིད་ཆེན་པོ་ཀློང་ཆེན་རབ་འབྱམས་ཀྱིས་མཛད།
Wylie: rtsom pa po ni bdag nyid chen po klong chen rab 'byams kyis mdzad
```

**A++ Markers:**
- ✅ Accurate transliteration
- ✅ Proper particle handling
- ✅ Consistent with Wylie system

## LITURGICAL LAYER EXEMPLARS

### A++ Standard
**Quality:** Elegant rendering, metaphysical precision

```
From The Great Perfection: Supreme Vajra Vehicle Treasury:

I prostrate to the glorious primordial protector!
In the nature of dharmatā, primordially pure,
In the expanse of clear light, cessation of all elaboration,
Spontaneously accomplished, Sugata-essence—
To you I prostrate, Samantabhadra with five perfections.
```

**A++ Markers:**
- ✅ Elegant prose (not literal)
- ✅ Metaphysical precision
- ✅ Poetic flow
- ✅ Proper noun capitalization per protocol
