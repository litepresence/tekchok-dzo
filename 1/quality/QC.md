**Project:** MDZOD (Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod)  
**Assessment Date:** 2026-02-18

**Method:** Qualitative content analysis - manual review of all files  
**Assessor:** Senior Editorial Auditor  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This assessment provides comprehensive qualitative analysis of all 1,491 files (213 sections × 7 layers) based on actual content reading, not byte ratios.

### Critical Finding: Commentary Layer Has 11 Stub Files

**11 sections** have Commentary layer consisting of placeholder/stub content (2-6 lines). These files show reasonable byte ratios due to tiny Tibetan source files (<500 bytes), but actual commentary content is essentially empty.

**Layer Status Summary:**
- **Cognitive (Frozen):** 100% complete, all files functional
- **Epistemic (Frozen):** 100% complete, all files functional
- **Scholar (Dynamic):** 100% complete, excellent quality
- **Literal (Frozen):** 100% complete, 1:1 grammatical mapping
- **Liturgical (Frozen):** 100% complete, all files functional
- **Delusion (Dynamic):** 100% complete, good coverage
- **Commentary (Dynamic):** 94.8% functional, 11 stubs need regeneration

**Overall Publication Readiness:** 94.8% (202/213 sections fully ready)
