# QC CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY
## MDZOD Translation Project - Priority Repair Queue

**Assessment Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Analyst:** Senior Editorial Auditor  
**Scope:** 213 sections × 8 layers = 1,704 assessments

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Quality:** GOOD (80.5% A grades)  
**Critical Issues:** 35 F-grades requiring immediate repair  
**Priority Focus:** Volume 2, Chapters 17-25 (Advanced Practice)

---

## CRITICAL PATTERN: VOLUME 2 DELUSION LAYER CRISIS

**Finding:** Systematic under-coverage in advanced practice chapters (Ch 17-25)

**Statistics:**
- 23 of 35 F-grades (66%) are in Volume 2
- 22 of 23 delusion F-grades (96%) are in Chapters 17-25
- Average delusion ratio in Ch 17-25: 0.31x (target: 0.3-0.8x)

**Safety Implications:**
These chapters cover Trekcho, Thogal, Bardo, and Phowa—advanced Dzogchen practices with significant risk if misinterpreted. The delusion layer is CRITICAL for mapping error cascades that could lead to:
- Practice misapplication
- Psychological harm
- Doctrinal deviation
- Lineage transmission corruption

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 4)
1. Upgrade D-grades to C/B
2. Review B-grades for A potential
3. Verify all safety-critical sections have adequate error mapping

## QUALITATIVE SAMPLING RESULTS

### Verified Issues:

**02-20-02-01 Delusion (F-Grade, 0.09x):**
- Only 64 lines for 15,020 byte section
- Content: Repetitive error blocks (same text repeated 3x)
- Missing: Cascade chains, distinct error types, consequence depth
- **Verdict:** F-grade justified - essentially placeholder content

**02-17-14-01 Delusion (F-Grade, 0.09x):**
- Only 32 lines for 8,708 byte section (Chapter 17 - advanced)
- Content: 2 error blocks, nearly identical
- Missing: Advanced Dzogchen error types, cascade analysis
- **Verdict:** F-grade justified - insufficient for safety-critical material

**02-19-01-01 Commentary (F-Grade, 0.09x):**
- 320 lines for 184,130 byte section (largest in corpus)
- Content: Shows voice rotation but insufficient coverage
- Line coverage: ~2,000 Tibetan lines, only 320 commentary lines
- **Verdict:** F-grade justified - needs 3x expansion minimum

## CONCLUSIONS

### Strengths:
1. **Frozen layers (Wylie, Literal):** 99%+ completion, excellent quality
2. **Cognitive layer:** 93.9% A/A++ grades - translator notes comprehensive
3. **Scholar layer:** 75.1% A/A++ grades - Four Pillars structure working
4. **Epistemic layer:** 82.2% A/A++ grades - view classification precise

### Weaknesses:
1. **Commentary layer:** 15.5% below A-grade - needs voice rotation enforcement
2. **Delusion layer (Ch 17-25):** 10.8% F-grades - CRITICAL for safety
3. **Volume 2 bias:** Advanced practice sections systematically under-covered

### Critical Actions Required:
1. **Immediate:** Repair 22 delusion F-grades in Ch 17-25 (safety critical)
2. **Urgent:** Expand 9 commentary F-grades in Volume 2
3. **Important:** Regenerate 3 corrupted literal files
4. **Ongoing:** Establish minimum 0.30x delusion threshold for all Ch 17-25

**Assessment Confidence:** HIGH  
**Data Coverage:** 100% (213/213 sections)  
**Sampling Verification:** 15+ sections reviewed qualitatively  
**Grade Distribution:** Within acceptable bounds (F-grade target met)  

**Copyleft 2026:** Amid all this apparent happening, nothing has happened.
