## LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Byte Ratios Are Diagnostic, Not Targets
Files with good ratios can be low quality (generic fluff).
Files with low ratios can be high quality (minimal but specific).

### 2. Generic Template Language Is the Enemy
Phrases like "Hermeneutical strategy..." and "This passage presents..." provide ZERO value.
Every sentence must be unique to the specific passage.

### 3. Tibetan Terminology Is Essential
Specific terms (with Wylie in parentheses) ensure precision.
Generic descriptions ("the nature of mind") are insufficient.

### 4. Citation Integration Requires Manual Work
Automated generation misses citations.
Manual review ensures citations are named and contextualized.

### 5. Risk Flags Must Be Contextualized
Generic "<risk>reification</risk>" is useless.
Specific "Risk of reifying compassion as emotional state..." is valuable.
