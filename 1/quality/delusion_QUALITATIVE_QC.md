### Required Elements for Each Error Block:

1. **Line Range**: [start-end] with exact line numbers from Tibetan source
2. **Error Classification**: Valid tag from error taxonomy
3. **Misreading**: Specific, realistic misinterpretation in plain language
4. **Why it arises**: Cognitive or cultural attractor—why this error feels right
5. **Primary consequence**: What necessarily degrades if adopted
6. **Secondary consequences**: Non-trivial downstream effects only
7. **Cascade effects**: Clear recurrent error chains using standardized tags

### Error Classification Tags (Mandatory Use):

- `<ontological-error>` - Reality misapprehension
- `<epistemic-error>` - Knowledge claim failure
- `<pedagogical-error>` - Teaching misapplication
- `<practice-error>` - Methodological mistake
- `<reification-error>` - Substantializing emptiness
- `<nihilistic-error>` - Negating to annihilation
- `<eternalistic-error>` - Affirming permanence
- `<psychologization-error>` - Reducing to psychology
- `<meditationism-error>` - Reifying method
- `<scholarly-collapse-error>` - Academic misreading

### Quality Indicators:

**A++ (Exemplar)**: 
- Every error block contains all 7 required elements
- Misreadings are specific and realistic
- Consequences trace actual doctrinal degradation
- Cascade effects show sophisticated pattern recognition
- Page bleed awareness included where relevant

**A+ (Excellent)**:
- Most error blocks complete
- Minor omissions in secondary consequences
- Good cascade mapping
- Some sections could be expanded

**A (Good)**:
- Core error identification present
- Some blocks missing secondary consequences
- Cascade effects simplified
- Generally accurate but less comprehensive

**Below A (Needs Enhancement)**:
- Repetitive or templated entries
- Missing key elements (consequences, cascade effects)
- Generic misreadings not specific to content
- Copy-paste duplication

## NOTES

- Delusion layer purpose: Error analysis and failure-mode cartography
- Tone: Clinical, exact, unsentimental
- Do NOT state correct view, offer practice guidance, or quote other texts
- Silence preferable to invention
- Quality varies significantly—some sections are A++ exemplars while others need complete rewrite
