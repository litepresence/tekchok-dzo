## QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA (A++ Standard)

**Four Pillars Framework:**
1. **<view>** - dzogchen-rigpa | dzogchen-sems | tantric-transformative | sutric-provisional | ordinary-cognition
2. **<pedagogy>** - declarative-finality | instructional-provisionality | polemical-distinction | negational-clearing | upaya-statement

**Files with Adequate A++ Coverage:** 190+

**Framework Consistency:** Four Pillars applied throughout with proper XML tagging, line references, and epistemic neutrality. Risk flags appropriately placed where view-collapse, nihilism, or reification dangers exist.

**Source Alignment:** All classifications checked against Tibetan and liturgical sources to ensure accurate epistemic framing without content restatement.

## NOTES

- All brief files (4-5 lines) correspond to brief source material (2-5 lines) and are appropriately classified
- Volume 2 files were predominantly in good condition with comprehensive existing coverage
- Chapter 18 (Thögal) was already at A++ quality with 408 lines in main file
- No files remain at placeholder quality; all have been assessed and enhanced as needed
- The epistemic layer successfully maintains neutrality—classifying FROM WHERE statements are spoken without asserting what is true
