## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Expand 8 critical sections** listed above to reach 0.50x minimum
2. **Verify 18 high-ratio files** (5.0x+) for fluff content
3. **Add <philology>** to remaining tantric sections in Ch 5-6

### Quality Maintenance

1. **Four Pillars Balance:** Ensure no single pillar exceeds 40% of content
2. **Wylie Consistency:** All technical terms must include Tibetan
3. **Citation Verification:** Cross-check tantra/sutra references against Tibetan source

### Long-term Enhancement

1. **Volume 2 Advanced Practice:** Ch 17-25 need careful attention for practitioner safety
2. **Comparative Analysis:** Add more doxographical comparisons across all sections
3. **Exemplar Update:** Add 01-04-04-01 and 01-05-01-01 to exemplars.md as A++ models

## CONCLUSION

The scholar layer is in **GOOD CONDITION** with 85% of sections meeting or exceeding quality standards. Three critical files have been successfully enhanced to A++ standard, demonstrating the viability of the Four Pillars framework.

**Key Strengths:**
- Strong philosophical analysis throughout
- Consistent technical terminology
- Good structural mapping
- Excellent Volume 1 coverage

**Remaining Work:**
- 8 sections need expansion to reach minimum ratios
- 18 high-ratio files need fluff verification
- Volume 2 advanced practice sections require focused attention

**Overall Grade: B+** (trending toward A- with continued repair)
