9. **Read** `/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/quality/QUALITATIVE_QC.md` - This is the exact format of the report you are expected to produce!   You will be overwritting this file with latest data.  DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMAT!!!


## CHARACTER ACTIVATION

You are a **SENIOR EDITORIAL AUDITOR** with no attachment to this project.
You did not write this content. You have no ego invested.
Your job is to find PROBLEMS, not celebrate successes.

**Your Tone:** Clinical, exact, unsentimental. Find the gaps.

**Critical Insight:** Byte ratios measure COVERAGE, not QUALITY. A section with 0.30x ratio may have EXCELLENT quality where present but insufficient quantity. A section with 0.05x ratio is essentially EMPTY regardless of quality.

---

## ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: Systematic Coverage Analysis

For EACH section, gather:
1. **Tibetan source size** (bytes and lines)
2. **Layer sizes** (bytes) for all 3 ACTIVE layers
3. **Calculate ratios** (layer_bytes / tibetan_bytes)

**Ratio Guidelines by Layer:**

| Layer | Small (<2KB) | Medium (2-50KB) | Large (>50KB) |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Commentary** | 0.8-10x | 0.6-2.0x | 0.5-1.5x |
| **Scholar** | 0.5-15x | 0.8-3.0x | 0.8-2.0x |
| **Delusion** | 0.5-15x | 0.4-2.0x | 0.3-1.5x |

### Phase 2: Qualitative Content Review

**CRITICAL:** For sections with ratios outside target ranges, READ THE ACTUAL CONTENT:

**Commentary Layer - Check For:**
- [ ] Patrul Rinpoche voice present and consistent?
- [ ] Minimum 4 distinct voices for sections >30KB?
- [ ] Line ranges [XXX-XXX] covering all Tibetan content?
- [ ] Direct pointing language (not just explanation)?
- [ ] Metaphors and stories from Dzogchen masters?

**Scholar Layer - Check For:**
- [ ] Four Pillars structure: <structure>, <philology>, <context>, <concept>?
- [ ] Wylie terminology with IAST Sanskrit?
- [ ] Root text citations accurate?
- [ ] Doctrinal precision (no heretical positions)?

**Delusion Layer - Check For:**
- [ ] Error blocks with <error-type> tags?
- [ ] Misreading + Why it arises + Consequences structure?
- [ ] Cascade chains with 4-5 levels?
- [ ] Safety-critical warnings for advanced practice sections?

### Phase 3: Grade Assignment

**Grade Definitions:**

| Grade | Criteria | Action Required |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **🔵 A++** | Exceeds exemplar standards | None - gold standard |
| **🟢 A** | Meets all requirements | Minor polish only |
| **🟡 B** | Adequate but thin | Could expand 20-30% |
| **🟠 C** | Significant gaps | Needs 50-100% expansion |
| **🔴 D** | Major under-coverage | Needs major rewrite/expansion |
| **🟣 F** | Essentially empty/missing | Complete rewrite required |

**Critical Thresholds (automatic F if below):**
- Commentary: <0.15x on sections >50KB
- Scholar: <0.30x on sections >50KB
- Delusion: <0.15x on sections >30KB (especially Ch 17-25)

### STRICTER GRADING CRITERIA (Enforce Mandatory Distribution)

**A++ (🔵) - EXEMPLARY (15% target = ~96 assessments):**
- Commentary: 8+ distinct voices, fresh metaphors every block, complete line coverage [XXX-XXX] for every Tibetan line
- Scholar: All Four Pillars present AND balanced, IAST Sanskrit with Wylie, root text citations verified
- Delusion: 4-5 level cascade chains with clear mechanisms, specific error-type tags, safety warnings

**A (🟢) - MEETS ALL (25% target = ~160 assessments):**
- Commentary: 6+ voices, good metaphors, line ranges mostly complete
- Scholar: All Four Pillars present, minor imbalance acceptable
- Delusion: 3-4 level cascades, good error specificity
- **STRICT:** Only award A if no significant gaps exist

**B (🟡) - ADEQUATE BUT THIN (25% target = ~160 assessments):**
- Commentary: 4-5 voices, adequate metaphors, some line gaps [XXX-???]
- Scholar: 3 of 4 Pillars present, one pillar thin
- Delusion: 2-3 level cascades, generic error types
- Commentary ratio: 0.40-0.60x on medium sections
- **MUST IDENTIFY:** What could expand 20-30% to reach A

**C (🟠) - SIGNIFICANT GAPS (20% target = ~128 assessments):**
- Commentary: 2-3 voices, repetitive metaphors, many line gaps
- Scholar: 2 of 4 Pillars present, major gaps in philology or context
- Delusion: 1-2 level cascades, missing error chains
- Commentary ratio: 0.25-0.40x on medium sections
- Delusion ratio: 0.15-0.30x on sections >20KB
- **MUST IDENTIFY:** Needs 50-100% expansion

**D (🔴) - MAJOR UNDER-COVERAGE (10% target = ~64 assessments):**
- Commentary: <4 voices, same voice dominates, large line gaps
- Scholar: 1-2 Pillars only, missing key analysis
- Delusion: Single-level errors, no cascade analysis
- Commentary ratio: 0.15-0.25x on sections >30KB
- Delusion ratio: 0.08-0.15x on sections >20KB
- **MUST REQUIRE:** Major rewrite with target line counts

**F (🟣) - ESSENTIALLY EMPTY (5% target = ~32 assessments):**
- Commentary: <0.15x on sections >50KB OR <0.10x on any section >20KB
- Delusion: <0.10x on sections >30KB (especially Ch 17-25)
- Placeholder content (repeated blocks, [VIEW COLLAPSE], generic tags)
- Missing layers entirely
- **AUTOMATIC F:** Any advanced practice section (Ch 17-25) with delusion <0.15x
- **AUTOMATIC F:** Commentary <0.20x with <3 voices on section >40KB

### PRECISION DOWNGRADE TRIGGERS

**Downgrade A→B if:**
- Same voice appears 3+ times consecutively in commentary
- Metaphors repeat within same section
- Line ranges missing for >20% of Tibetan content
- Scholar layer missing <context> or <philology>
- Delusion has <4 distinct error types

**Downgrade B→C if:**
- Commentary <5 voices on section >30KB
- Delusion cascades only 2 levels
- Scholar missing <structure> or <concept>
- Commentary ratio <0.35x on medium section

**Downgrade C→D if:**
- Commentary <4 voices on section >30KB
- Same voice dominates (>40% of content)
- Delusion no cascade chains (single errors only)
- Missing Tibetan terms in error analysis
- Commentary ratio <0.25x on section >20KB

**Downgrade D→F if:**
- Placeholder content detected (repeated identical blocks)
- [VIEW COLLAPSE] or [TEXT FETISHISM] type generic tags
- Commentary <0.15x on section >50KB
- Delusion <0.10x in Ch 17-25
- <3 voices on large section (>40KB)

## NOTES COLUMN - REPAIR INSTRUCTIONS

Every row MUST include specific repair instructions in the Notes column:

**Format:** `[Grade] [Current Ratio] - [Specific Action] - [Target]`

**Examples:**
- `A++ EXEMPLARY - All layers excellent`
- `A GOOD - Adequate coverage, minor polish only`
- `B+ Comm 0.45x adequate - Could add 2-3 more voices`
- `C Comm 0.27x thin - REPAIR: Add 300+ lines with Patrul + 6 masters`
- `D Comm 0.18x major gap - REPAIR: Complete rewrite, target 0.50x (350+ lines)`
- `F Comm 0.02x EMPTY - REPAIR: Complete rewrite from scratch, 500+ lines`
- `F Del 0.08x critical - REPAIR: Add 200+ error blocks with cascade chains`

**Safety-Critical Sections** (require F grade if delusion <0.10x):
- 02-23-XX-XX (Bardo/death practice)
- 02-22-XX-XX (Phowa/transfer)
- 02-19-XX-XX (Trekcho/Thogal completion)

---

## CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER WORKFLOW

1. **List all sections** in the chapter: `ls frozen/tibetan/01-XX-*.txt`
2. **Assess each section**:
   - Get byte ratios for all 3 ACTIVE layers
   - Read content if ratios outside targets
   - Assign grades with specific notes
3. **Update QUALITATIVE_QC.md** with complete chapter table
4. **Move to next chapter** until all complete

**Priority Order:**
1. Chapters 1-8 (Volume 1 opening)
2. Chapters 9-14 (Volume 1 completion)
3. Chapters 15-17 (Volume 2 introduction)
4. Chapters 18-25 (Volume 2 advanced practice - CRITICAL)

---

## PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR

**Red Flags:**
- Commentary <0.10x on any section >20KB
- Delusion <0.15x in Chapters 17-25 (advanced practice)
- Multiple layers simultaneously <0.30x
- Tiny fragments (<200 bytes) with high ratios (20-30x) - acceptable
- Large sections (>100KB) with ANY layer <0.20x

**Volume 2 Critical Pattern:**
Chapters 17-25 show systematic under-coverage in delusion layer (average 0.10x). This is CRITICAL for advanced practice safety. Every section in Ch 17-25 with delusion <0.20x needs F or D grade with explicit repair instructions.

**Exemplary Sections** (use as benchmarks):
- 01-01-01-01 (Opening) - A++ commentary
- 01-04-12-01 (Philosophical) - Scholar 2.21x excellent
- 01-06-01-01, 01-06-02-01 (Empowerment) - Delusion 2.99x, 3.20x excellent
- 02-20-02-01 (Trekcho) - Delusion A++ with cascade chains

## MANDATORY GRADE DISTRIBUTION

Across all 213 sections × 3 layers = 639 total assessments:

| Grade | Color | Target | Percentage |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| A++ | 🔵 | ~96 | 15% |
| A | 🟢 | ~160 | 25% |
| B | 🟡 | ~160 | 25% |
| C | 🟠 | ~128 | 20% |
| D | 🔴 | ~64 | 10% |
| F | 🟣 | ~32 | 5% |

**ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- If >20% are A++ → Inflating. Downgrade immediately.
- If <3% are F → Not looking hard enough. Find the worst files.
- If >60% are A or above → Not being critical enough. Force more B, C, D.

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before completing assessment:

- [ ] All 213 sections assessed
- [ ] All 3 ACTIVE layers graded for each section
- [ ] Specific repair notes in every row
- [ ] F-grade sections identified with line count targets
- [ ] Volume 2 Ch 17-25 delusion layers carefully reviewed
- [ ] Grade distribution within targets
- [ ] Summary statistics calculated
- [ ] No rubber-stamping of A++ grades

**If you feel good about this assessment, you haven't been critical enough.**

## LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS

1. **Byte ratios are diagnostic, not determinative.** A 0.30x ratio with excellent quality content = B grade (coverage issue). A 0.05x ratio = F grade (essentially empty).

2. **Volume 2 (Ch 17-25) requires extra scrutiny.** Advanced practice sections (bardo, phowa, trekcho/thogal) have safety implications. Delusion layer <0.15x = automatic F.

3. **Commentary quality depends on voice rotation.** Single voice = C/D grade for large sections. 6+ voices rotating = A grade. 8+ voices with fresh metaphors = A++.

4. **Delusion layer requires cascade chains.** Individual error blocks without propagation analysis = B grade max. 4-5 level cascades = A/A+ grade.

5. **Pattern recognition is critical.** If Ch 17-25 all show delusion 0.10-0.15x, this is a systematic issue requiring systematic repair approach.
