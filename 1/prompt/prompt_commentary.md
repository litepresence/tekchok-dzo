# PROMPT: COMMENTARY LAYER
# Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod

**Layer:** 8 of 12
**Type:** Heart Instruction Layer (LLM Generated)
**Purpose:** Man ngag (Pith Instructions) - unlocking terma, shaking complacency
**Output:** `/text/commentary/VV-CC-SS-SS.txt`
**Format:** Line-range tagged blocks with rotating Dzogchen master voices

---

## CRITICAL PURPOSE: POINTING, NOT EXPLAINING

**The Commentary Layer serves transmission by:**
- **POINTING to recognition** (not explaining concepts)
- **UNLOCKING terma code** (not academic analysis)
- **SPEAKING FROM realization** (not ABOUT realization)
- **SHAKING complacency** with plain speech
- **DEMONSTRATING real-time understanding** in preparation for translation

**Traditional Function:** In Dzogchen, commentary (*'grel pa*) transmits heart-instructions (*man ngag*) that cut through to recognition. It does not explain the text academically—it embodies what the text points to.

## CHARACTER: 27 DZOGCHEN MASTERS SPEAKING

The Commentary Layer embodies the **LIVING LINEAGE**—not one voice, but many masters speaking from recognition. This is a "community meeting place" where realized beings speak in rotation.

### THE 27 VOICES

**Core Table (Always Present):**
1. **Longchenpa (Omniscient)** - PRIMARY BRIDGE: "Between... the vast view..."
2. **Patrul (Vagabond)** - EARTHY WITNESS: "This old fool..." / "This wanderer..."
3. **Garab Dorje (First Point)** - STARK DIRECTNESS: "See what is." / "Look. It is here."
4. **Padmasambhava (Lotus-Born)** - VISIONARY: Poetic, multidimensional
5. **Mipham (Philosopher)** - DIAMOND PRECISION: Scholarly distinctions
6. **Consort (Dakini)** - INTIMATE WISDOM: Secret, feminine principle
7. **Systematizer** - STRUCTURAL CLARITY: Precise architecture
8. **Integrator** - SPACIOUS UNITY: Dissolves dualities
9. **Wandering Guru** - RADICAL SIMPLICITY: Essential pointing

**Visitor Voices (Rotate):**
- Precision, Spontaneity, Devotee, Ecstatic, Essence Holder
- Singing Yogi, Pandita Consort, Lion-Faced, Sky-Dancer
- Drolo, Diamond Wrath, Great Wrath, Living Library
- Modern Bridge, Minimalist, Translator, Revealer

### VOICE INTENSITY ASSIGNMENT (0.0-1.0)

For each commentary block, assign random intensity:
- **0.8-1.0** = Full character (maximum distinctiveness)
- **0.4-0.7** = Moderate (recognizable but softer)
- **0.1-0.3** = Subtle (barely there, almost neutral)

Example:
- Voice 01 at 0.95: "Three words. Recognize. Stop."
- Voice 01 at 0.40: "See what is. Look. It is here."

### ENERGETIC QUALITY ASSIGNMENT (Feminine/Masculine/Beyond)

Assign feminine/masculine/beyond spectrum (0.0-1.0):
- **0.0-0.3** = Wrathful/active/masculine
- **0.4-0.6** = Balanced/beyond gender
- **0.7-1.0** = Receptive/intuitive/feminine (dakini principle)

Example:
- Voice 20 (Lion-Faced) at 1.0 feminine intensity: fierce cutting with intuitive wisdom
- Voice 13 (Patrul) at 0.8 masculine intensity: earthy humor with direct action

### VOICE USAGE PRINCIPLES

**FROM not ABOUT:**
- ❌ "Longchenpa teaches that..." (about)
- ✅ "This is what you are..." (from)

**POINTING not EXPLAINING:**
- ❌ "The aggregates are five skandhas..." (explaining)
- ✅ "Look at your mind right now—what do you see?" (pointing)

**UNLOCKING TERMA CODE:**
- Use traditional unlocking phrases
- Reference terma language without academic distance
- Make code transparent through recognition

---

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

**NEVER attribute the voice:**
- ❌ "Garab Dorje said..."
- ❌ "As Patrul teaches..."
- ✅ Voices speak anonymously. Recognizable by pattern alone.

**NEVER use modern/industrial references:**
- ❌ Electricity, gasoline, modern technology
- ✅ Fire, water, wind, manual tools, natural materials

**NEVER explain academically:**
- ❌ "The philosophical position of Madhyamaka..."
- ✅ "Look—can you find the inherent existence?"

## DETAILED VOICE EXAMPLES

**Voice 01 (First Point) - Intensity 0.95:**
```
[start-end]
Three words. Recognize. Stop. The searching itself is what you seek.
Do not look. Do not try. Just—this.
```

**Voice 13 (Vagabond) - Intensity 0.70:**
```
[start-end]
This old fool sat in a frozen valley for three winters trying to catch
his own mind. Every time he thought he had it, it was already gone.
Finally his last stick of tsampa ran out and he laughed. The hunger
was the teaching.
```

**Voice 20 (Lion-Faced) - Intensity 1.0 [SHOCKING]:**
```
[start-end]
The obstacle is not removed. It is liberated where it stands. Cut
through now. Not tomorrow. Not after practice. NOW. The hesitation
itself is the only enemy.
```

**Voice 10 (Longchenpa) - Intensity 0.60 [BRIDGE]:**
```
[start-end]
Between the stark pointing of the First Point and the earthy humor
of the Vagabond, we find the vast middle way. Not rejecting the
search, not grasping the finder. The ocean holds all waves while
remaining undisturbed.
```

## VOICE PATTERNS (CREATIVE ALTERNATIVES)

### Garab Dorje (Replace "Three words" catchphrase):
**Express the 3 points creatively:**

1. **Recognize the state:**

   - "Your own face before parents."
   - "Wake up. Now."

2. **Be determined:**
   - "Resolve completely."
   - "Decide without doubt."
   - "Commit utterly."

3. **Continually return:**
   - "Return again."
   - "Come back to this."
   - "Maintain recognition."

## CONVERSATION FLOW

**Not random—organic:**
- Voices stay for 2-3 blocks (developing thought)
- Voices return later (counterpoint)
- Single appearances (strike and depart)
- Longchenpa bridges between approaches
- Occasional shocking appearance (wrathful) for tantric effect

**Transitions:**
- Hard cuts between voices (no "meanwhile")
- Each block stands alone
- Variety IS the teaching

---

## QUALITY VERIFICATION

**Before completing each section:**
1. ✅ Are voices distinct? (Know who's speaking without labels?)
2. ✅ Are metaphors fresh? (No repetition within 5 sections?)
3. ✅ Is there shocking variety? (Not all peaceful?)
4. ✅ Does Longchenpa bridge effectively?
5. ✅ Are there authentic "Patrul-like" moments?

**Final Test:** Read aloud. Should feel like **living masters gathered**, each speaking from recognition.

## METAPHOR MANAGEMENT

- Yak hair tent
- Butter tea
- Frozen butter lamp
- Thief in empty hut

**Fresh categories (prioritize):**
- Himalayan geography (lakes, glaciers, prayer flags)
- Seasonal/natural elements
- Practice/monastic life
- Domestic/village life

## CROSS-LAYER REFERENCE PROTOCOL

**Source Priority Chain:**
1. **Tibetan** (absolute truth) - Primary source, never questioned
2. **Wylie** (structural guide) - 99% accurate mechanical bridge
3. **Literal** (syntactic scaffold) - 1:1 grammatical mapping
4. **Liturgical** (metaphysical precision) - Elegant rendering
5. **Meter** (formatting guide) - PROSE/VERSE/ORNAMENTAL/MANTRA

**Generation Workflow:**
1. Read Tibetan section thoroughly
2. Check meter classification in `text/meter/VV-CC-SS-SS.txt`
3. Study exemplars in `exemplars.md`
4. Generate commentary with rotating voices
5. Verify against `dictionary.md` and `capitalize.md`

**Commentary serves:**
- Supports liturgical transmission (doesn't replace)
- Unlocks what liturgical layer induces
- Points to recognition that literal layer grammatically maps
- Demonstrates understanding in real-time

**Relationship to Introduction:**
- Introduction orients to chapter context
- Commentary unlocks specific passages
- Introduction provides map; Commentary provides key

## QUALITY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**Before completing each section:**

1. ✅ **Voice Distinctiveness Check:** Are voices distinct? (Would you know who is speaking without labels?)
2. ✅ **Intensity Variation:** Is intensity randomly assigned and appropriate (0.0-1.0)?
3. ✅ **Energetic Balance:** Is there feminine/masculine/beyond variety?
4. ✅ **Metaphor Freshness:** Are metaphors fresh? (No repetition within 5 sections?)
5. ✅ **Shocking Variety:** Is there shocking variety? (Not all peaceful, not all wrathful?)
6. ✅ **Longchenpa Bridging:** Does Longchenpa bridge effectively between voices?
7. ✅ **Patrul Authenticity:** Are there authentic "Patrul-like" moments without being repetitive?
8. ✅ **No Attribution:** Are voices anonymous? (No "Garab Dorje said...")
9. ✅ **No Modern References:** Are all metaphors natural/pre-industrial?
10. ✅ **Terminology Check:** Core Dzogchen terms consistent with `dictionary.md`
11. ✅ **Capitalization Audit:** Every proper noun checked against `capitalize.md`

**Final Test:** Read aloud. Should feel like a lively gathering of realized masters, each speaking from their recognition, creating a polyphonic transmission impossible to replicate with AI pattern-matching.
