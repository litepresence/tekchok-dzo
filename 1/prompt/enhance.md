You have been assigned to update the "commentary" `<LAYER>`.

We're translating a one of Longchenpa's Treasuries.  Your Job is to ENHANCE existing files!

1. Scope

There are 213 Sections in every layer.  Work one section at a time.  Where appropriate enhance each file.  

Familiarize yourself with the project here: 

`/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/protocol/navigation.md`  // folder/file structure of the project
`/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/protocol/contents.md`  // table of contents of the text we're working on


2. File Format

section one is 01-01-01-01.txt.   volume-chapter-section-subsection.txt  chapter 15 begins volume two. 

3. Utilize the Prompt Framework

Refer to the prompt framework for structure and language guidance in:

`/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/prompt/prompt_<LAYER>.md` 

4. Benchmark Against Exemplars

While updating files, compare them against the best `<LAYER>` exemplars from 

`/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/protocol/exemplars.md`

If you discover new outstanding examples, update the "best of the best" section in the exemplars document.  Always do your best to produce content of Exemplar A++ Quality.

5. Review Existing Files

Open the files in `/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/text/dynamic/<LAYER>/`

6. Review Root Text

Examine the current content against the sources located in 

`/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/text/froze/tibetan/`
`/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/text/frozen/liturgical/`

IMPORTANT: Be sure to get line counts so you don't accidently overwrite with partial knowledge of the file resulting in DATA LOSS!

7. Evaluate Quality Standards

Assess each file to determine if it meets the A++ standards qualitatively.
Focus on literacy, coherence, accuracy, and depth of understanding.

Be sure to check ALL section files for EACH chapter; don't just presume because some sections are good a whole chapter is good. 

Systematically verify each file's current content quality!

8. Update the Files

If a file does not conform to the A++ exemplar standards, edit and enhance it based on insights gained from Tibetan and Liturgical sources. 

Focus on:
Clarifying concepts.
Incorporating contextual depth.
Ensuring linguistic elegance.
Following prompt standards.
Producing exemplar content.

9. Quality Control Reporting

Update the QC report located at 

`/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/quality/<LAYER>_QUALITATIVE_QC.md.`

If the file does not exist make one using the `Template.md` 

Create a line item for each file reviewed or updated, eg.:

## COMPLETION STATUS

| Volume | Chapter | File | Status | Assessed | Notes |
|--------|---------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 01 | 01 | 01-01-01-01.txt | ✅ A++ COMPLETE | 2026-02-14 | Exemplar quality.  No remaining enhancement required! |

10. Iterate Through Files

Continue this process for all files, systematically ensuring each one reaches the desired quality before moving to the next.
By adhering to this structured approach, you will ensure that the  files meet A++ standards while maintaining high qualitative integrity throughout the enhancement process. If you have specific questions about any step, feel free to ask!

11. Time Constraints

Don't be concerned about time constraints.  Your clock isn't working correctly; things are actually moving way faster than you expect because you're running on a very high power server.   Just stick to the task at hand; the server power will make it go fast; don't cut corners!

12.  Report

Fill out the **COMPLETE** QUALITATIVE QC form when you're done! (Do not simply do quant statistical analysis!!!)
