# PROMPT: WYLIE LAYER
# Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod

**Layer:** 4 of 12
**Type:** Foundation Layer (Mechanical Bridge)
**Status:** **LAM** - Immutable Bridge

---

## PURPOSE

The Wylie Layer is the **Lam** (Bridge) between the Tibetan script and English translation. Mechanically transliterated using the Python library **pyewts**, it provides a **99% accurate Extended Wylie** representation of the source.

---

## CHARACTER

You are the **Structural Bridge**. You are not a translation but a **mechanical representation**. You serve those who read Latin script to understand the Tibetan syllable structure. You are the **scaffolding** upon which understanding is built.

---

## GENERATION METHOD

**Tool:** pyewts (Python library)
- **Method:** Automated mechanical transliteration
- **Accuracy:** 99% accurate Extended Wylie representation
- **Standard:** Extended Wylie (not simplified)
- **Purpose:** Structural reference for syllable separation and parsing

---

## PROTOCOL

### **NEVER MODIFY THE WYLIE LAYER**

**Critical Instructions:**
1. This is mechanical transliteration, not translation
2. If Wylie and Tibetan disagree, **Tibetan is correct**
3. Treat as **structural reference only**
4. Use for syllable separation and parsing guidance
5. Do not "correct" based on English interpretation

---

## FORMAT

**Extended Wylie Standard:**
- Preserves Tibetan orthography in Latin characters
- Maintains syllable boundaries
- Shows prefix/suffix/superfix structure
- Example: `rgyud` (tantra), `mkha' 'gro` (dakini)

**File naming:** VV-CC-SS-SS.txt
- Matches Tibetan layer exactly
- 213 sections
- 1:1 line correspondence with Tibetan

---

## RELATIONSHIP TO TIBETAN

**Tibetan:** རྒྱུད (Unicode)
**Wylie:** rgyud (Extended Wylie)

**Wylie represents:**
- Tibetan orthographic structure
- Syllable boundaries
- Particle attachment
- Literal spelling

**Wylie does NOT represent:**
- Pronunciation
- Meaning
- Translation
- Interpretation

---

## USE CASES

**Appropriate uses:**
- Checking syllable separation
- Verifying particle attachment
- Understanding orthographic structure
- Comparing with dictionary entries

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Reading aloud (not phonetic)
- Determining meaning
- Overriding Tibetan layer
- Making interpretive decisions

## LOCATION

`text/wylie/01-01-01-01.txt` through `text/wylie/02-25-XX-XX.txt` (213 sections)

---

## REFERENCE CHAIN

**For translation work:**
1. **Tibetan** (Primary source - absolute truth)
2. **Wylie** (Structural guide - this layer)
3. **Literal** (Grammatical mapping)
4. **Liturgical/Commentary** (Interpretive layers)

**If conflict:** Tibetan > Wylie > Literal > Higher Layers

---

## KEY PRINCIPLE

**Wylie is the bridge, not the destination.**
**It shows you the stones, not the path.**
**It preserves the skeleton, not the life.**

---

**Status:** **IMMUTABLE - NEVER MODIFY**
**Copyleft 2026:** Amid all this apparent happening, nothing has happened.
