## WHY REMAINING 'basis' IS CORRECT

### 1. Physical Basis
- "body's basis" - physical support, not gzhi
- "aggregate basis" - skandha support, not gzhi
- "faculty-basis" - dbang po'i gzhi, physical support

### 2. Support Basis
- "energetic basis" - subtle body support
- "basis of empowerment" - structural support
- NOT doctrinal gzhi

### 3. Error Descriptions
- Delusion layer describes misreadings
- "<basis-path-result-sequentiality>" describes the ERROR
- NOT making the error itself

### 4. Scholarly Analysis
- "theoretical basis" - academic language
- "ontological basis" - philosophical analysis
- NOT doctrinal translation

### 5. English Idiom
- "on the basis of" - standard English
- "as a basis for" - standard English
- NOT doctrinal translation

---

## KEY DISTINCTION

### gzhi (གཞི་) = 'ground'
- Primordial ground of being
- Dzogchen technical term
- MUST be 'ground'

### rten (རྟེན་) = 'basis/support'
- Physical or structural support
- General Buddhist term
- 'basis' is CORRECT

### kun gzhi (ཀུན་གཞི་) = 'kunzhi' or 'all-ground'
- Universal ground (alaya)
- Distinguished from gzhi
- 'kunzhi' or 'all-ground' are CORRECT
