  - NEEDS: Break after "field" or "qualities"
  
- [36]: Multiple appositives - "Teacher possessing perfections, complete power, the Victorious One, Samantabhadra, together with hosts of wisdom-ocean retinue,"

- [46]: 48 words - EXTREME
  - MUST BREAK: Into 2-3 sentences at commas after "nature," "Akanisṭha," "marks,"

**[MODERATE] FRAGMENT:**
- [206]: Ends with em-dash but no continuation
  - ADD: "—thus is the manner renowned."
