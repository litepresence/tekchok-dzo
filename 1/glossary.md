## Usage Notes

1. **Capitalization**: Proper names (Buddhas, schools, tantras) are capitalized. Technical terms are lowercase unless they begin sentences.

2. **Sanskrit vs. Tibetan**: When available, Sanskrit terms are preferred for Buddhist philosophical concepts (e.g., "dharma" not "chos"). 

3. **Consistency**: Once a term is glossed here, it should be used consistently throughout all translation layers.

4. **Context Sensitivity**: Some terms have different meanings in different contexts (e.g., "awareness" as vidya vs. ordinary awareness). Context should always be clear.
