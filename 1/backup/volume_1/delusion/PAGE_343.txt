[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PHYSIOGNOMIC DETERMINISM]

MISREADING:
Physical characteristics (eye shape, hair color, body proportions) determine spiritual capacity or channel type as fixed destiny.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14030-14066: Extensive correlations between physical traits and channel types: "kha dog smug cing bongs thung so legs la byad zlum pa" (dark color, short body, good teeth, round cheeks = deer channel).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing appearance as determining spiritual potential.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Discrimination based on physical features.
Missing that all forms are equally wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SOMATOTYPING OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing classification as ontologically real.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Identifying with a particular channel type.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TAXONOMIC OBSTRUCTION ERROR]

[PRACTICE ERROR] [BODHICITTA EMISSION MATERIALISM]

MISREADING:
Bodhicitta (byang sems) emission is a physical process that can be controlled through channel manipulation.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14021-14032: Descriptions of bodhicitta emission in relation to channel types.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing subtle energy as material substance to be manipulated.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Obsession with physical control.
Missing that bodhicitta is the nature of mind itself.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SOMATIC CONTROL OBSESSION ERROR]
