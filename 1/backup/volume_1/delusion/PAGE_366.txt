[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DUALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The classification of winds into "wisdom wind" (ye shes rlung) and "karma wind" (las rlung) describes two distinct types of energy that can be distinguished and separately cultivated or eliminated.

WHY IT ARISES:
The binary classification suggests two distinct ontological categories. Dualistic habits lead readers to imagine these as separable energies with different essences.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to eliminate karma wind while cultivating wisdom wind, treating them as actually distinct rather than differently labeled depending on recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Aggression toward "ordinary" energy develops. The practitioner tries to get rid of karma wind, failing to recognize that all wind is empty of inherent nature.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error generates [WIND DUALISM] separating energies, [ELIMINATION OBSESSION] getting rid of bad, and [PURITY PURSUIT] rejecting ordinary. The error creates warfare with breath.

[REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The description of channels where winds and thigle dwell indicates specific locations that can be accessed through techniques, and that damaging certain channels (gseng) creates defects while preserving others maintains function.

WHY IT ARISES:
The technical medical language (defects, preservation, damage) suggests a mechanical system requiring careful manipulation. Practical applications invite literal interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes a preservation project of protecting channels. The practitioner develops anxiety about damaging subtle body structures through wrong practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conservative caution replaces fearless view. The practitioner becomes hesitant and careful, believing delicate channels can be damaged by incorrect practice.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error produces [PRESERVATION ANXIETY] protecting channels, [CONSERVATIVE FIXATION] fear of damage, and [TECHNIQUE TIMIDITY] cautious approach. The error transforms fearlessness into caution.

[MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "vital letters" (gnad kyi yi ge) placed at specific body locations constitute a precise map for visualization meditation—one should place awareness at these letter-locations to transform the body into the mandala.

WHY IT ARISES:
Tantric practice commonly involves placing seed syllables at body locations. Readers familiar with such practices automatically apply this framework.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes tantric visualization practice. The practitioner focuses on placing letters in body locations, believing this constitutes Dzogchen meditation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Construction effort replaces recognition. The practitioner works to build or transform the body through visualization rather than recognizing its already-perfect nature.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error generates [SYLLABLE OBSESSION] letter fixation, [BODY MANDALA CONSTRUCTION] building rather than recognizing, and [PLACEMENT EFFORT] working to position. The error reduces Dzogchen to spelling.

[LIGHT CHASING] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The winds carrying thigle through channels produce light experiences that practitioners should seek to intensify and prolong—bright wind experiences indicate successful practice while dull wind indicates failure.

WHY IT ARISES:
The wind-thigle-light correlation suggests desirable phenomenology. Practitioners habitually chase luminous experiences as proof of progress, assuming brightness equals realization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes wind-light cultivation. The practitioner works to generate bright, clear wind experiences, tracking light intensity as progress meter, seeking ever more vivid sensations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Substantialism of luminosity develops. Light experiences are treated as valuable accomplishments to possess. The practitioner becomes attached to brightness, developing aversion to ordinary or dim experiences, creating dualistic fixation on desirable phenomenology.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error produces [LUMINOSITY CHASING] brightness as goal, [WIND-LIGHT CORRELATION] tracking experiences, and [DULLNESS AVERSION] rejecting ordinary. The error creates preference hierarchy.

[POSTURE RIGIDITY] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The specific body locations for vital letters require precise physical positioning to access—certain channels only open in specific postures, and maintaining "correct" posture mechanically activates the channels and letters.

WHY IT ARISES:
The spatial specificity suggests postural requirements. Body-work traditions emphasize positioning as causal factor for energetic activation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes posture obsession. The practitioner fixates on sitting exactly right, holding specific positions rigidly, believing mechanical alignment produces awakening.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Physical tension replaces natural presence. The effort to maintain "correct" posture creates bodily rigidity and mental fixation, directly obstructing the relaxation and openness necessary for recognition. Posture becomes obstacle rather than support.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error generates [POSITION RIGIDITY] fixation on form, [MECHANICAL ALIGNMENT] forcing posture, and [TENSION OBSESSION] body as obstacle. The error transforms support into prison.
