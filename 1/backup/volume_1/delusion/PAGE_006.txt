[PERCEPTUAL HIERARCHY ELITISM] [CAPACITY SUPERIORITY]

MISREADING:
The graduated scale of perception (gods < sages < shravakas < bodhisattvas < Buddhas) interpreted as a spiritual hierarchy where higher beings are "better" and lower beings are defective or inferior.

WHY IT ARISES:
The text explicitly compares capacities using "more than" (ches mang) and "than" (bas ni). The structure resembles developmental psychology, evolutionary advancement, or spiritual elitism. "Buddha sees most" sounds like "Buddha is superior."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Perceptual capacity is moralized into spiritual superiority. Practitioners develop arrogance about their Dzogchen view or shame about their limited perception.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The hierarchy is read as ladder to climb. Teachers are ranked by "level of perception." Students feel inadequate for not seeing infinitely. Dzogchen becomes competition of perceptual powers.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SPIRITUAL ELITISM] (hierarchy of beings), [CAPACITY SHAME] (feeling inadequate), [COMPETITIVE PERCEPTION] (trying to see more), [TEACHER RANKING] (better/worse teachers), and [DEVELOPMENTAL FIXATION] (climbing perceptual ladder).

[OMNISCIENCE PROJECTION ERROR] [BUDDHA AS ALL-SEER]

MISREADING:
"Buddha's eye sees infinitely more" interpreted as describing omniscience in the sense of knowing all facts, possessing complete information about everything.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Buddha eye" (*sangs rgyas kyi spyan*) and "seeing" (*gzigs pa*) suggest perceptual capacity. Western conceptions of God include omniscience as total knowledge. The comparative "more than" suggests quantitative difference.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddhahood is understood as epistemic achievement—knowing everything that can be known. This turns enlightenment into information accumulation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners try to expand their "perception" through psychic development. Meditation becomes attempt to see more, know more, perceive subtle realms. The simplicity of direct recognition is buried under paranormal pursuit.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Generates [OMNISCIENCE FIXATION] (wanting to know all), [PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT] (siddhi chasing), [INFORMATION ACCUMULATION] (knowledge as awakening), [EPISTEMIC MATERIALISM] (facts as treasure), and [PARANORMAL OBSESSION] (special powers).

[SUTRA QUOTATION HIERARCHY] [SCRIPTURAL COMPETITION]

MISREADING:
The multiple sutra quotations (Samadhiraja Sutra, Magical Display Vajra/Guhyagarbha) understood as competing authorities—using one sutra to refute another, establishing which text is "right."

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 182-189 explicitly refutes one view using another text. This resembles theological debate where scripture is used to prove/disprove positions. Academic Buddhist studies analyze "sutra vs. sutra" conflicts.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes scriptural debate—accumulating quotations to win arguments. Practitioners quote texts at each other to establish authority.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The actual meaning—different teachings for different capacities—is lost. Sutras become evidence in scholastic disputes. Longchenpa's integration is read as partisan defense of Nyingma against Sarma.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCHOLASTIC DEBATE] (arguing with quotations), [SCRIPTURAL PARTISANSHIP] (my text vs. yours), [AUTHORITY COMPETITION] (which sutra wins), [NIHILISM/ETERNALISM DEBATE] (proving positions), and [DOXOGRAPHICAL WARFARE] (school vs. school).

[LINEAGE ORIGIN MYTH ERROR] [SAMANTABHADRA AS FIRST]

MISREADING:
"Samantabhadra as the first, from whom all Buddhas arose" interpreted literally as historical claim about lineage origins—all teachers descend from Samantabhadra in temporal succession.

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 175 says Buddhas "arose from" (*byung ba*) Samantabhadra having shown the path. This sounds like genealogical origin. "First" (*dang po*) suggests temporal priority.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samantabhadra is historicized as primordial teacher who taught the first generation of students. Lineage becomes traced back to this original event.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The "first Buddha" concept emerges—who was first, how did lineage begin? Questions about origin plague the tradition. Practitioners seek "original" teachings closer to the source.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Generates [GENEALOGICAL HISTORICIZATION] (lineage as family tree), [ORIGIN OBSESSION] (what happened first), [TEMPORAL PRIORITY] (earlier is better), [PRIMORDIAL TEACHER CULT] (worshipping first Buddha), and [LINEAGE ANXIETY] (authenticity through descent).

[REFUTATION AGGRESSION ERROR] [POLEMICAL READING]

MISREADING:
Longchenpa's refutation of other views (lines 182-189: "this is incorrect... contradicts the Magical Display Vajra") interpreted as aggressive polemic—attacking opponents, defending territory, winning debate.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language is confrontational: "not correct" (*mi rigs*), "contradicts" (*'gal ba*). Academic Buddhist studies categorize Tibetan literature by polemical debates. Readers import competitive frameworks.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen study becomes identification of who is "right" (Longchenpa) and who is "wrong" (others). The text is read as refutation of opponents rather than clarification for practitioners.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners develop sectarian attitudes—"we Nyingma are right, they are wrong." The actual pedagogical purpose (showing different views for different needs) is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SECTARIANISM] (us vs. them), [POLEMICAL POSTURE] (debate mentality), [REFUTATION OBSESSION] (finding errors in others), [DEFENSIVE IDENTITY] (protecting Dzogchen), and [AGGRESSIVE CORRECTNESS] (being right as goal).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 6 continues from Page 5's cosmological exposition, now focusing on perceptual capacity and sutra quotations. Line 190 introduces how Samantabhadra's emanations benefit beings, which continues the theme.

Line 191 begins: "Such a manner is also renowned in common sutras..." indicating that Page 7 will show how Dzogchen cosmology is not unique but shared with sutra teachings.

ERROR RISK: Readers may treat the refutation section (lines 177-190) as the main point, missing that it's a digression to clarify a specific doctrinal point before returning to the main exposition in Page 7.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands that Longchenpa's refutations are pedagogical clarifications, not sectarian polemics. Page 7 will return to the cosmological framework.
