[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The sevenfold appearance is an illusion or error that obscures the single essence, which is the true reality behind the appearances.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Not knowing the one, thus it appears" suggests the seven are false appearances hiding truth. Platonic frameworks seek unitary reality behind multiplicity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Single essence is reified as true ground while sevenfold display is dismissed as mere appearance. Recognition becomes reduction to unity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks to transcend or dismiss the sevenfold diversity in favor of singular essence, missing that diversity is display of that essence.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [ETERNALISTIC ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The verse describes how mind (blo) creates the sevenfold appearance through its own processes, making the ground a mental projection.

WHY IT ARISES:
"From mind's stages" (*blo yi rim pa*) suggests mind-creation. Idealist frameworks interpret all appearance as mental construction.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Ground is reduced to mind-only (*sems tsam*) position. Dzogchen ground becomes philosophical idealism.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Self-face primordially pure" is interpreted as mental purity rather than ontological primordial purity. Recognition becomes psychological purification.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The seven bases are "flawed" and must be rejected in favor of a correct view beyond all seven.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Flawed" (*skyon can*) suggests error to be eliminated. Dualistic frameworks require rejection of wrong views for right view.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Seven bases are abandoned rather than recognized as aspects. Dzogchen degenerates into view-negation without recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner adopts anti-view posture, claiming "beyond all positions" while unconsciously maintaining hidden position.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [EPISTEMIC ERROR].

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
If everything is spontaneously present from the beginning, then samsara and nirvana are eternally established states with no path or transformation needed.

WHY IT ARISES:
"From the first spontaneously present" suggests eternal pre-establishment. Essentialist frameworks interpret presence as inherent existence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Path and fruition collapse into ground. "Already enlightened" becomes excuse for non-practice while remaining in ordinary delusion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Recognition is deemed unnecessary because "already present." The spontaneous becomes warrant for inaction and spiritual lethargy.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].
