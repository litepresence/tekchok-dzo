[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The six arrangement bindus and their correlation with "dharmatā single taste gathering all phenomena" is interpreted as asserting a literal process where specific bindus actually gather or synthesize reality—substantialist metaphysics.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Gathering" (*གཅིག་སྡུད་) suggests collection. "Arrangement" (*བཀོད་པ་) implies ordering. Western systems-thinking interprets this as organizing principle.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Bindus are treated as agents that perform functions. The natural display is replaced by bindu-agency. "Dharmatā gathering" becomes something bindus do rather than how reality naturally abides.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Entry bindus establish samsara-nirvana connection" is read as causal claim. "Birth bindus establish maṇḍala" suggests productive power. "Arrangement bindus gather to single taste" is taken as active synthesis.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where bindus are reified as functional entities. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows as bindu-system is elaborated. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The locations of bindus in all sentient beings is interpreted as asserting universal Buddha-nature as literal physical presence—anatomical essentialism claiming all beings "have" enlightenment in specific body parts.

WHY IT ARISES:
"All sentient beings" triggers universalist reading. Location specifics suggest physical presence. Western essentialism interprets this as "everyone has Buddha inside."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature is spatialized and reified as inner possession. "You have Buddha in your heart" becomes literal claim. The emptiness of Buddha-nature and groundless ground are lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Citadel bindu" is mapped to heart location. "Dhūtī bindu" is located in central channel. "Conch-shell bindu" is placed in skull. Natural display becomes anatomical treasure hunt.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] where Buddha-nature is substantialized. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as students search for "inner Buddha." [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The presentation of vajra chain-linked as the basis for fifteenfold classification of awareness is interpreted through tantric framework—as completion-stage subtle-body practice requiring specific prerequisites and preparations.

WHY IT ARISES:
Familiarity with tantric systems causes projection. Technical terminology overlaps with completion stage. Western hierarchical thinking assumes Dzogchen requires lower-yana preparation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is collapsed into tantric completion stage. Thodgal becomes advanced subtle-body practice requiring deity yoga foundation. The directness of Atiyoga is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"True rigpa in vajra chain-linked" is equated with tantric bindu practices. "Fifteenfold awareness" is compared to deity maṇḍalas. Display (*རྩལ་) is confused with generated visualization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] produces [PRACTICE ERROR] where years of tantric preparation are required before Dzogchen. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] proliferates as traditions are conflated. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows.
