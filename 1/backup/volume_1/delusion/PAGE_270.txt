[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes "Rang shar" and earlier sources describing spontaneous accomplishment's display as the wish-fulfilling jewel's meaning, inner wisdom jewel-display, outer vast, youth vase body. A reader might think: "These are the real names and forms of the display - the wish-fulfilling jewel, the youth vase body. These exist in the nature."

WHY IT ARISES:
Rich symbolic language creates vivid mental imagery. "Wish-fulfilling jewel," "youth vase body" - these are powerful symbols that seem to refer to real metaphysical entities or realms.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies symbolic terms as referring to real entities. The "youth vase body" becomes a place or state, the "wish-fulfilling jewel" becomes an actual metaphysical jewel.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking the "youth vase body" as a destination
2. Imagining the wish-fulfilling jewel as real
3. Creating maps of symbolic realms
4. Missing that symbols point, not define

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (symbols as entities) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking symbolic realms) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (symbolic cartography). The practitioner chases symbols.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that primordial purity is without things or characteristics, while spontaneous accomplishment has the meaning of form and wisdom without gathering or separation. A reader might think: "So there ARE two aspects - empty essence and manifest nature - united without duality. This is the structure of reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
The two-aspect model is intellectually satisfying. We grasp it as the "correct view" - reality has these two aspects that are non-dual. This feels like understanding the ultimate truth.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The two aspects become the fundamental ontology. The practitioner constructs a metaphysics around essence and nature, understanding everything through this dual-yet-non-dual framework.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Imposing two-aspect framework on everything
2. Debating the relationship between the aspects
3. Seeking experiences of "non-dual unity"
4. Missing that aspects are imputed, not inherent

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (aspects as real) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (aspect metaphysics) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking non-dual experiences). The practitioner dualizes non-duality.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes "Thal 'gyur" tantra: no name of existence for non-recognition, no numbers of one or two, no existence or non-existence established by examination, no wisdom even slightly established. A reader might think: "This is the ultimate philosophical position - beyond all extremes, beyond existence and non-existence, beyond even wisdom."

WHY IT ARISES:
We seek the ultimate philosophical formula. "Beyond all extremes" seems like the final answer. The negation of even wisdom sounds like the most radical emptiness teaching.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts "beyond all extremes" as the ultimate position. This becomes a new extreme - the extreme of having no position, a subtle metaphysical conceit.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Taking pride in having "no position"
2. Debating the "correct" way to be beyond extremes
3. Seeking experiences of "beyond extremes"
4. Missing that no-position is also a position

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to EPISTEMIC ERROR (no-position as position) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (debating non-positions) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching radical emptiness). The practitioner becomes positionless.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, Nihilistic ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text says: without cause, without conditions, no duality of perceived and perceiver, characteristics not divided anywhere, coarse perceiver exhausted. A reader might think: "This is total emptiness - nothing exists, no causes, no conditions, no perceiver or perceived. Everything is completely empty."

WHY IT ARISES:
Radical emptiness can feel liberating. No causes, no conditions, no perceiver - complete freedom from all structures. But this easily slides into nihilistic denial of all functional reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner denies causality, conditions, and perception. "Everything is empty" becomes a blanket dismissal of all phenomena, leading to irresponsible disengagement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Denying cause and effect
2. Rejecting all knowledge as "mere imputation"
3. Using emptiness to avoid accountability
4. Missing that emptiness doesn't negate functionality

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates NIHILISTIC ERROR (total denial) → PRACTICE ERROR (abandoning ethics) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (confusing emptiness with non-existence). The practitioner becomes irresponsible.
