[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The description of lamp-supports (sgron ma'i rten) as "causing samsara-nirvana seeds to expand" is interpreted as literal energetic mechanics—supports actually "work" to produce realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
Instrumental reasoning assumes causality. "Support" suggests functional mechanism. The practitioner assumes described supports are causal instruments.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-context nature of supports is lost. The practitioner believes "correct" supports cause realization. Support-gathering replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Materialism of supports emerges. Specific gazing-postures, breathing-patterns, or cushions are deemed "necessary." The practitioner judges practice by support-proximity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 467-468's support elaborations. Each support becomes another "thing to have." By PAGE 476, deity yoga's supports are compared unfavorably to dzogchen's "superior" supports.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The distinction between supports of different lamps is interpreted as hierarchy of "support-efficacy," with wisdom-lamp supports being "more powerful" than distant-water supports.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative language triggers value-ranking. Differentiation suggests superiority. The practitioner wants "best" supports.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The equal availability of recognition through any support is lost. The practitioner chases "superior" supports while neglecting present conditions. Grasping at support-hierarchy prevents recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Support-snobbery emerges. "I use wisdom-lamp supports" becomes status-marker. The authentic recognition that supports are merely conditions is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Support-mastery becomes capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having superior supports."

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The "threefold gathering of function" (gsum gyi byed 'dus) is interpreted as three requirements that must all be assembled for "correct" practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerative language triggers checklist-psychology. "Three" suggests necessities. The practitioner assumes all must be present.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural recognition is suffocated by requirement-assembly. The practitioner worries: "Do I have all three? Is my gathering complete?" The pointing function collapses into adequacy-anxiety.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Orthodoxies form around "correct" threefold-assembly. Teachers who verify completeness gain authority. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed if "functions aren't gathered."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] becomes entrenched by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of nine deviations. Having worried about threefold-gathering, the practitioner now obsesses over ninefold-avoidance. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by complexity.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The completion of four-lamp exposition is seen as "finishing the main teaching" of Volume 1. What follows (deviations, practitioner types, colophon) is seen as "supplementary material" to skim.

WHY IT ARISES:
Pedagogical structure suggests "main point" versus "addenda." Dense technical content creates fatigue. The practitioner wants to "get to the end."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration-function of latter sections is missed. The practitioner has "lamp-knowledge" without deviation-awareness, practitioner-humility, or dedication-merit.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward dismissive pattern. "Main teachings" are studied; "concluding sections" are ignored. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed entirely.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 469-472's deviations are not taken seriously. Arriving at PAGE 479 without deviation-awareness, the practitioner misses the dedication's importance. Volume 1 is "finished" without foundation.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "vajra essence" (rdo rje snying po) and "indestructible" descriptions are interpreted as establishing dzogchen as "superior substance" compared to other paths.

WHY IT ARISES:
Substantial language triggers essence-thinking. "Vajra" suggests indestructible essence. The practitioner wants this superior essence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The emptiness-of-all-essences teaching is lost. The practitioner believes dzogchen "has" vajra-essence. Recognition is replaced by essence-possession.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Vajra practitioner" becomes identity. Other paths are deemed "non-vajra" and inferior. The authentic recognition that all paths are essenceless is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Substantial differences are emphasized over functional similarities. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed an "essence-identity" around dzogchen.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The support-substantialism on this page carries to PAGE 467-468's support-elaboration. By PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga, the practitioner expects "support-independent practice." The deviations (PAGE 471-472) are blamed on "wrong supports," and the colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "final support."
