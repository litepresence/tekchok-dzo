[SEQUENCING ERROR] [TEMPORALIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17946-17966 present six types of ignorance in apparent sequence: "root mind ignorance," "confusion object ignorance," "confusion-basis basis ignorance," "grasping thought ignorance," "artificial path ignorance," and "not-knowing delusion ignorance." The reader understands this as describing an actual temporal sequence of how delusion develops from root to manifestation.

WHY IT ARISES:
The numbering and explicit sequence markers ("first," "second," etc.) naturally suggest chronological order. The progression from "root" through increasingly specific forms implies a developmental process. The phrase "that also sequence like" appears to confirm temporal interpretation. Narrative structures are universally compelling to human cognition, and the sequence creates a story of how delusion happens that is intuitively satisfying.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Delusion becomes objectified as a real process occurring in stages through time. The understanding that all six types are simultaneous aspects of a single non-recognition—and that neither ignorance nor its types have any temporal existence—is completely lost. The timeless, non-sequential nature of confusion is obscured by developmental narrative.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to trace their delusion back to its "root" or try to work through the sequence in reverse to achieve liberation. They may believe that understanding the sequence of how delusion arose will reveal how to undo it. The direct recognition that sequence itself is delusion, and that there is nothing to trace back to, is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [DEVELOPMENTAL ERROR] where delusion is understood as having progressive stages, [REGRESSION ERROR] where practitioners endlessly seek the "first moment" of ignorance, [NARRATIVE ERROR] where samsara becomes a story with plot, and [PROCESS ERROR] where undoing delusion is believed to follow reverse sequence. Also activates [HISTORICIZATION ERROR] where timeless confusion is placed in time.

[ETYMOLOGICAL ERROR] [DEFINITIONAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17946-17981 provide six definitions of ignorance based on what is not recognized: not recognizing self-face, not knowing object-essence, confusion like scarecrow, self as house, artificial path, and not-knowing nature. The reader treats these as fixed technical definitions establishing six distinct phenomena.

WHY IT ARISES:
The definitional format ("X is Y") resembles dictionary entries and technical terminology. Academic training encourages precise categorization, memorization of definitions, and mastery of taxonomies. The systematic presentation suggests completeness. The desire for certainty drives acceptance of definitions as definitive.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The living, immediate experience of not recognizing one's nature is replaced by conceptual knowledge about types of ignorance. Practitioners can discuss the six types, quote their definitions, and explain their relationships while remaining fundamentally deluded. The actual recognition of non-recognition is replaced by knowledge about it.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Intellectual mastery of the six ignorances creates false confidence. Practitioners believe they "understand ignorance" because they can name, define, and categorize its varieties. They may teach others about the six types while lacking recognition themselves. The distinction between knowing about and knowing directly is collapsed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CONCEPTUAL MASTERY ERROR] where knowing about ignorance substitutes for recognizing it, [SUBTLE PRIDE ERROR] where definitional precision becomes spiritual accomplishment, [TEACHING ERROR] where those without recognition instruct others, and [CONFIDENCE ERROR] where intellectual clarity masks experiential confusion. Also activates [SCHOLASTICISM ERROR] where study replaces practice.

[TYPOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYSTEMATIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17966-17991 describe eleven types of mind using vivid animal and elemental metaphors: water-like mind, pig-like mind, tiger-like mind, light feather-like mind, wind-like mind, mud-puddle-like mind, fire-spark-like mind, bird-like mind, branch-like mind, garuda-like mind, and madman-like mind. The reader literalizes these into personality types or psychological categories.

WHY IT ARISES:
The systematic presentation (eleven distinct types) invites classification and cataloging. Modern psychology has trained us to think in personality types, cognitive styles, and behavioral patterns. The vivid animal metaphors are memorable and seem to capture observable characteristics. The number eleven suggests comprehensiveness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The fluid, context-dependent nature of mental states is completely obscured. What are skillful, provisional descriptions of how mind operates under various conditions become reified as enduring personality characteristics. The understanding that all minds are equally empty of inherent type is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may proudly identify with certain types ("I have tiger-like courage") or despair of others ("I have pig-like delusion"). They may aspire to develop "better" types or reject "worse" ones. Teachers may categorize students by type. Type becomes subtle self, and type-aspiration becomes subtle goal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [IDENTITY FORMATION ERROR] where spiritual typology replaces personality psychology, [ASPIRATION ERROR] where wanting a "better" mind-type becomes goal-setting, [SELF-ASSESSMENT ERROR] where constant typing occurs, and [LIMITATION ERROR] where type determines self-concept. Also activates [HIERARCHY ERROR] where types are valued differentially.

[BEHAVIORAL ERROR] [CORRESPONDENCE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17981-17991 explain the eleven mind types through specific behavioral and conditional correspondences: water-like mind from "object and latencies various gathered," pig-like from "accept-reject on deluded," tiger-like from "anger and pride coarse," wind-like from "move on obstacle nonexistent," etc. The correspondences are literalized as actual causal mechanisms.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed behavioral explanations appear to provide scientific or psychological accuracy. The causal language ("through of," "from") suggests mechanism. Traditional and modern behavioral sciences train us to accept such correspondences as explanatory. The desire for understanding "why" drives literal interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Behavior becomes objectified as actually caused by specific factors and conditions. What are pedagogical illustrations, skillful means for recognizing patterns, become ontological claims about how mind works. Practice becomes about manipulating causes to change mind-types rather than recognizing the emptiness of all causation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may attempt to "purify latencies," "avoid certain objects," or "cultivate specific conditions" to change their mind-type. They may believe understanding the correspondences gives them control. The recognition that all such factors, conditions, and correspondences are empty constructs is completely lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [INTERVENTION ERROR] where causes are manipulated, [BEHAVIORISM ERROR] where Dharma becomes behavioral therapy, [CHANGE ERROR] where self-improvement replaces recognition, and [CONTROL ERROR] where understanding mechanisms creates illusion of mastery. Also activates [CONDITIONING ERROR] where conditions are taken as real.

[CONDITIONAL ERROR] [DEPENDENT ORIGINATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17992-18012 describe how "object and condition through of virtuous non-virtuous unspecified mind three gather" and how "mind from intellect arise... intellect from affliction arise... that also play is capacity or power or ray like that from arise tone just." The conditional language is read as describing actual dependent origination (pratityasamutpada) as a real process.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed conditional structure (X las byung, through of X, from X) closely resembles classical descriptions of dependent origination. Buddhist training heavily emphasizes understanding dependent origination as key to liberation. The logical, systematic presentation invites acceptance as describing reality. The philosophical sophistication impresses.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dependent origination becomes objectified as an actual process occurring in reality. The understanding that even dependent origination is empty—not ultimately real, but a conceptual tool—is lost. Practice becomes about understanding conditions and their relationships rather than recognizing the emptiness of all conditional thinking.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may study dependent origination extensively, believing this analytical understanding brings liberation. They may trace chains of conditionality, analyze causes and effects, and map relationships. The direct recognition that all conditions, chains, and origination are empty constructs is obscured by analytical mastery.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ANALYTICAL ERROR] where conditions are endlessly studied, [UNDERSTANDING ERROR] where knowledge of dependent origination substitutes for recognition, [CHAIN ERROR] where practitioners trace infinite causal regress, and [INTELLECTUALISM ERROR] where analysis replaces practice. Also activates [BUDDHIST STUDY ERROR] where learning Dharma concepts substitutes for realizing them.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 426 completes the detailed presentation of the six ignorance types and eleven mind types begun in page 425, adding sequential interpretation and behavioral attribution errors. The sixfold ignorance structure particularly invites temporalization—understanding the six as stages rather than aspects. Page 427 will present the six root afflictions and sixteen proximate afflictions, continuing and amplifying the enumeration pattern. The transition from ignorance types to mind types to affliction types maintains the systematic, structural approach that risks reification throughout. The conditional language ("through of," "from," "arise") sets up dependent origination interpretation that will continue through page 428. The Abhidharma analytical framework throughout these pages must be consistently recognized as analytical tool, not ontological description. The behavioral and conditional correspondences on this page set up interventionist approaches that must be seen through.
