[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DICHOTOMY ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "supreme samaya beyond letters" is a higher or more advanced type of samaya that replaces or supersedes conventional samaya commitments.

WHY IT ARISES:
Hierarchical language ("supreme," "beyond") suggests progression from lower to higher. Western spiritual frameworks emphasize transcending rules through realization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practitioner abandons conventional samaya prematurely, claiming "beyond letters" status while lacking stable recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Rigpa rangbyung yeshe" becomes license for any behavior. The distinction between authentic spontaneous wisdom and ordinary ego-expression collapses.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
"All appearances without exception are primordially non-existent like mirages" means phenomena are literally unreal, therefore nothing matters and no action has consequence.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Primordially non-existent" interpreted as ontological nullity rather than empty of inherent existence. Western nihilism merges with Buddhist emptiness teachings.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Two truths collapse into single nihilistic view. Conventional causality denied while ultimate realization also absent.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Illusory appearance" becomes excuse for irresponsible behavior. The eight similes of illusion are used to dismiss ethical considerations rather than to deepen non-attachment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Thodgal practice with the four visions will automatically result in Buddhahood without need for accumulation or other practices.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Without depending on accumulation" suggests complete autonomy of thodgal method. Technological thinking seeks single sufficient mechanism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practitioner neglects foundational practices (ngondro, accumulation) believing thodgal sufficient. Direct crossing becomes bypassing.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Five lights and four visions are pursued as experiences rather than natural self-display. "Self-accomplished Buddha" becomes premature claim.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [ETERNALISTIC ERROR].

[PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Whatever appears or is aware is self-arising wisdom alone" means all mental content, emotions, and thoughts are automatically wisdom without distinction.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Self-arising" and "whatever" interpreted as universal inclusion. Western psychological frameworks conflate awareness with content.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
No distinction made between rigpa and ordinary mind. All mental states validated as wisdom-display without recognition requirement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Self-liberated in great spontaneity" becomes justification for indulging any impulse. The natural state is confused with ordinary habitual patterning.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EPISTEMIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Never transgressing the intent of great spontaneous evenness" means one must maintain a specific state or view at all times.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Never transgressing" suggests continuous maintenance of position. Eternalistic frameworks seek permanent achievement of view.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Spontaneous evenness becomes objectified state to be maintained through effort. The effortless nature of lhundrub is undermined by grasping.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops anxiety about "falling away" from view. Monitoring replaces naturalness. The "great intent" becomes conceptual reference point.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] and [MEDITATIONISM ERROR].
