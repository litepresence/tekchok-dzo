[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains how compassion arises from the base like clouds from the sky - not truly existent yet appearing. A reader might think: "So compassion is like clouds - they appear but aren't real. This means appearances are illusory but the base (sky) is real."

WHY IT ARISES:
The cloud-sky metaphor is common and evocative. We naturally privilege the sky as "real" and clouds as "mere appearances." This creates a dualistic reading of the metaphor.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as "real" (like sky) and appearances as "unreal" (like clouds). This becomes a dualistic metaphysics with a real substratum and unreal manifestations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Privileging base over appearances
2. Seeking the "real" base beyond appearances
3. Disdaining appearances as "mere illusions"
4. Missing that both base and appearances are empty

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (base as real) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking the real base) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (dualistic metaphor). The practitioner seeks the sky beyond clouds.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the eight modes of arising of spontaneous accomplishment - desire, enjoyment, form, non-dual view, methods, wisdom gates, compassion. A reader might think: "These are the eight real ways that spontaneous accomplishment manifests. These are the fundamental modes of enlightened expression."

WHY IT ARISES:
Numbered lists create systematic clarity. "Eight modes" sounds comprehensive and authoritative. We imagine understanding the complete structure of manifestation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The eight modes become a taxonomy of enlightened manifestation. The practitioner studies them as categories of reality, seeking to experience or embody each mode.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Memorizing the eight modes as doctrine
2. Seeking experiences of each mode
3. Creating hierarchy among the modes
4. Missing that modes are descriptive, not prescriptive

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (eight-fold system) → REIFICATION ERROR (modes as real categories) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking modes). The practitioner counts to eight.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes the wish-fulfilling jewel and how it abides in one's form, the youth vase body appearing outwardly while abiding in spontaneous accomplishment's mode. A reader might think: "This describes actual metaphysical structures - the wish-fulfilling jewel within, the youth vase body as a real inner dimension."

WHY IT ARISES:
Rich symbolic imagery seems to describe metaphysical realities. "Wish-fulfilling jewel," "youth vase body" - these suggest actual entities or realms within the practitioner's being.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies symbolic anatomy as literal metaphysical structure. The "youth vase body" becomes an actual inner body, the "wish-fulfilling jewel" a real inner jewel.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking the youth vase body as inner reality
2. Imagining literal wish-fulfilling jewels inside
3. Creating maps of inner metaphysical anatomy
4. Missing that symbols point to experience, not entities

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (symbolic anatomy as literal) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking inner bodies) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (inner metaphysics). The practitioner explores inner realms.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists how from wisdom's unceasing meaning arises the mode of enjoyment, from qualities the mode of spontaneous form, from compassion the mode of impure appearance. A reader might think: "This explains the causal mechanism of manifestation - how different aspects produce different displays. This is the cosmology of manifestation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Causal explanations satisfy our need for understanding how things work. We assume the text is explaining the mechanics of manifestation - the "how" of appearance arising.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the description as causal mechanics. "Compassion gives rise to impure appearance" becomes a cosmological law explaining the origin of samsara.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Understanding the description as causal explanation
2. Studying the mechanics of manifestation
3. Debating the causal relationships
4. Missing that description is not explanation

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (description as causality) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (manifestation mechanics) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding as explanation). The practitioner seeks mechanics.
