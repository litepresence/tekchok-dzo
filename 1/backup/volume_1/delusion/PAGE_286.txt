[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "Base-appear see-of instant liberate-of method" as compassion awareness arising from primordial space, with self-appear self-known and distinction dividing leading to instant Buddhahood. A reader might think: "This is describing a technique—look at base-appearances, recognize them as self-appear, make distinctions, and you become Buddha instantly."

WHY IT ARISES:
The phrase "instant liberate-of method" suggests a technique for instant liberation. Westerners want quick results and methods. The description sounds like steps to follow: look inward, recognize, distinguish, liberate.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a method of "instant liberation" involving looking at appearances, recognizing them as self-appear, and making distinctions. They turn spontaneous recognition into a procedure.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Recognition becomes a technique to perform
2. "Instant" is pursued as quick result
3. Natural liberation is replaced with method
4. Spontaneity is lost in following steps

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MEDITATIONISM ERROR (method for instant liberation) → PRACTICE ERROR (performing recognition) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (steps to Buddhahood). The practitioner races through steps to instant enlightenment.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes the Intention Pronouncement Tantra: "That time Samantabhadra dharma six-by-means-of base know non-awareness six defeat-from slight from mind slight empty awareness slight arise-by-means-of awareness obscuration destroy." A reader might think: "Samantabhadra defeated non-awareness through the six dharmas. I need to follow this process—go from slight mind to clearing obscurations."

WHY IT ARISES:
The narrative of Samantabhadra's victory over non-awareness sounds like a mythic process to emulate. Westerners read tantric narratives as instructions. The "six dharmas" suggest a system to learn.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies Samantabhadra's awakening as a process to replicate, seeking the "six dharmas" as specific practices. They try to defeat non-awareness through effort.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Samantabhadra is worshipped as separate deity
2. The six dharmas are sought as secret techniques
3. Natural recognition is replaced with mythic emulation
4. Obscurations are battled instead of self-liberated

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (myth as literal) → PRACTICE ERROR (emulating Samantabhadra) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (defeating obscurations). The practitioner plays mythic hero instead of recognizing rigpa.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "illusion from instant one-by-means-of distinction divide instant one-by-means-of complete Buddha" and Samantabhadra's virtue as self-arisen outflow-non-existent. A reader might think: "From the illusion of ordinary mind, through making distinctions, I can become complete Buddha instantly. My natural virtues are already perfect."

WHY IT ARISES:
The "instant" and "complete Buddha" sound like attainable states. Westerners want completion and perfection. "Self-arisen virtue" suggests inherent goodness to discover.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner believes they can become "complete Buddha" through an instant of distinction-making, and that their natural virtues are already an "ocean." They await this instant transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Waiting for the magic instant of completion
2. Reifying "ocean of virtue" as possession
3. Ordinary confusion is denied as illusion only
4. Gradual purification is rejected

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (inherent virtue) → PRACTICE ERROR (awaiting instant completion) → ETERNALISTIC ERROR (complete Buddha as goal). The practitioner waits for a magical moment.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text discusses "base first-from liberate" and asks "if base first liberate also return become." A reader might think: "The base is liberated from the first, so I'm already liberated. But wait—could I fall back? I need to ensure I don't return to delusion."

WHY IT ARISES:
The question about return triggers anxiety about losing liberation. Westerners want security and permanence. The possibility of "return" suggests liberation needs protection.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner anxiously seeks confirmation that liberation is irreversible, or creates practices to "protect" their recognition from backsliding. They reify liberation as a state that can be lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Liberation is monitored for stability
2. Practices are adopted to prevent "return"
3. Doubt about whether one is "really" liberated
4. Natural confidence is replaced with anxious checking

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PRACTICE ERROR (protecting liberation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (doubt about recognition) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (liberation as reversible state). The practitioner guards their enlightenment like a possession.
