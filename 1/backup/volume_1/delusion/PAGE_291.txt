[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENTAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These elements are the actual building blocks of realms. I need to understand how elements create realms to master manifestation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Elements suggest primal forces to harness. Western occult and elemental traditions seek elemental mastery. The text seems to offer a cosmology of elemental creation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner studies elements as creative forces, seeking to understand how they produce realms. They try to work with elements spiritually.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Elements are reified as forces
2. Realm creation becomes project
3. Natural manifestation is manipulated
4. Dzogchen becomes elemental magic

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ELEMENTAL ERROR (force fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (elemental work) → REIFICATION ERROR (elements as powers). The practitioner becomes an elemental magician.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, IGNORANCE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "ignorance six-as arise" including root mind ignorance, delusion object ignorance, delusion-basis ignorance, grasp thought ignorance, remedy path ignorance, and not-know confuse ignorance. A reader might think: "These are six types of ignorance I need to identify and eliminate. Each requires a specific antidote."

WHY IT ARISES:
Taxonomies suggest specific problems needing specific solutions. Western problem-solvers want to address each ignorance type. Six types suggest a system to master.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner categorizes their ignorance into six types, seeking to eliminate each. They create a project of ignorance-eradication.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Ignorance is reified as enemy
2. Six-fold strategy is developed
3. Self-liberation is replaced with eradication
4. Dzogchen becomes ignorance-management

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates IGNORANCE ERROR (fighting ignorance) → PRACTICE ERROR (six-fold eradication) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorance as enemy). The practitioner wages war on their own confusion.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR, OBJECT ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text asks "Delusion what-by-means-of delude object before world not-arise only when wish-fulfilling tree spread called." A reader might think: "Delusion happens through objects. Before the world arose, there was no delusion. I need to understand how objects delude the mind."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Object" suggests external things causing delusion. Western mind-object dualism assumes objects affect subjects. The question sounds like epistemological inquiry.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner investigates how objects delude, creating a theory of object-delusion. They try to free mind from object-influence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Objects are blamed for delusion
2. Subject-object dualism is reinforced
3. World is rejected as delusive
4. Dzogchen becomes idealism

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates OBJECT ERROR (blaming objects) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (mind-object theory) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (subject-object split). The practitioner tries to live without objects.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, CERTAINTY ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "Certainty put mind object I-by-means-of object is think-by-means-of consciousness-by-means-of grasp-by-means-of that to attachment arise-by-means-of certainty put called." A reader might think: "This is describing how certainty-fixation arises through grasping. I need to avoid certainty to stay open."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Certainty" sounds like rigidity to avoid. Western postmodernists reject certainty. The text seems to warn against fixation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner avoids all certainty, seeking permanent openness. They reject confidence and conviction as fixations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. All certainty is rejected
2. Openness becomes fixation
3. Genuine confidence is abandoned
4. Dzogchen becomes permanent uncertainty

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates CERTAINTY ERROR (rejecting conviction) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (confusing confidence with fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (permanent openness). The practitioner becomes confidently uncertain.
