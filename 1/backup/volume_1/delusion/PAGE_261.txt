[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text shows absurd consequences if the base is identified with consciousness: it would be momentary, subject to afflictions, etc. A reader might think: "This proves the base is NOT consciousness—it's something beyond consciousness, a deeper reality."

WHY IT ARISES:
Vedantic and mystical traditions teach "beyond mind, beyond consciousness." This creates expectation of a "higher" reality transcending ordinary awareness. The refutation of "base as consciousness" suggests this transcendent reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner seeks something "beyond consciousness"—pure emptiness, the unmanifest, the void. This becomes a new metaphysical ultimate, subtly reified as "higher" than awareness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Rejection of "awareness" teachings as limited
2. Seeking "deeper" states beyond rigpa
3. Dismissal of consciousness-only traditions
4. Creating hierarchy: emptiness > awareness > phenomena

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to ETERNALISTIC ERROR (transcendent void) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking "beyond" states) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (debating relative merits of awareness vs emptiness teachings). The practitioner becomes a metaphysical architect.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text presents the seventh position: self-arisen wisdom transcends existence and non-existence, beyond elaboration. A reader might think: "This is the ultimate truth! The base is pure wisdom that transcends all conceptual extremes."

WHY IT ARISES:
The description sounds like the highest teaching—beyond existence/non-existence, beyond elaboration. This is what seekers want: the final, definitive description of ultimate reality. It feels like arriving home.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies "wisdom" (ye shes) as the ultimate reality, transcending all conceptual extremes. This becomes a new supreme entity—"Wisdom" with a capital W. The Great Perfection becomes the Great Reification.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Clinging to "wisdom" as a state or attainment
2. Spiritual arrogance ("I understand the ultimate")
3. Dismissing lower teachings as "mere concepts"
4. Missing that even "wisdom" is a concept

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified wisdom) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking experiences of "wisdom") → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching "wisdom" rather than pointing). The practitioner creates a cult of ineffable wisdom.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, NIHILISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text refutes the position that wisdom is nothing at all, no nature anywhere. A reader might think: "This proves there IS something—wisdom exists, Buddha-nature exists, even if we can't say what it is."

WHY IT ARISES:
Fear of nihilism. Western spirituality is often reacting against scientific materialism and existential meaninglessness. The idea that "wisdom doesn't exist" feels threatening. The refutation is welcomed as salvation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner insists that wisdom/awareness/Buddha-nature "exists" in some sense, even if ineffable. This is subtle eternalism—affirming existence while denying we can say what exists.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Clinging to "there is something" as comfort
2. Rejecting emptiness teachings as "too negative"
3. Eternalist view of Buddha-nature
4. Missing that existence/non-existence are both extremes

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (affirming existence) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (needing something to exist for psychological security) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (debating existence vs non-existence). The practitioner is caught in the same dualism.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text transitions to establishing the author's own view: primordially pure and spontaneously accomplished are non-dual. A reader might think: "Finally, the positive teaching! The base is the non-dual unity of purity and spontaneity."

WHY IT ARISES:
Relief after pages of negation. The mind desperately wants something positive to hold onto. "Non-dual" sounds sophisticated and final. This seems like the ultimate philosophical achievement.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies "non-duality" as a metaphysical principle. "The base is the non-dual unity of X and Y" becomes the new creed. Non-duality is turned into a dualistic position (non-dual vs dual).

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. "Non-dual" becomes a badge of spiritual attainment
2. Debates about what is "really" non-dual
3. Missing that non-duality is not a position
4. Conceptual confusion masquerading as realization

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This triggers ETERNALISTIC ERROR (reified non-duality) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (philosophical system-building around non-duality) → PEDAGOGICAL ERROR (teaching non-duality as doctrine). The tradition becomes a school of non-dual metaphysics.
