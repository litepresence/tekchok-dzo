[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The description of the general object (spyi'i yul) as "outer space free of clouds, inner dharmata self-clear, in-between expanding display luminosity" is interpreted as literal map of three ontological zones or regions of reality that must be navigated sequentially.

WHY IT ARISES:
Tripartite structures trigger spatial mapping instincts. "Outer, inner, between" suggests dimensional geography. The practitioner assumes sophisticated teachings describe literal territories rather than modes of recognition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual nature of the three domains collapses into navigational model. The practitioner believes they must "enter" inner dharmata from outer space through the in-between gateway. Recognition becomes spatial traversal rather than present nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation becomes "traveling" from outer to inner. The practitioner seeks "arrival" at dharmata-location. Communities form around "outer practitioners" versus "inner realizers," creating new hierarchies based on claimed spatial positioning.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 465-468's detailed lamp-objects. Each becomes a "location" to reach. By PAGE 476's deity yoga vs. dharmata comparison, the practitioner has constructed an elaborate geography of spiritual territories. The colophon (PAGE 479) is seen as "outside" this geography.

[EXPERIENCE CHASING] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The specific objects (bye brag gi yul) of each lamp—distant water's empty form, wisdom's word-meaning, thigle's color-measurements—are interpreted as phenomenological catalog to be experienced in sequence.

WHY IT ARISES:
Catalog structure triggers collection-psychology. Detailed specifications suggest "advanced content" to master. The practitioner assumes enumerated experiences constitute higher practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is replaced by experience-cataloging. The practitioner judges practice-success by "which objects they've accessed." Those claiming more objects are deemed senior practitioners.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dzogchen becomes museum of experiences. The practitioner compares collections: "I have three lamp-objects, you have four." Authentic pointing-out is replaced by phenomenological show-and-tell.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] intensifies through PAGE 466-468's elaboration of objects. By PAGE 469-472's deviations, the practitioner is confused because their object-collection hasn't produced liberation. The similarity-mistaken pairs (PAGE 477-478) are reduced to "object-comparisons."

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The instruction to "hold the gaze at the self-nature of the eye" (mig gi de bzhin nyid) is interpreted as precise anatomical directive requiring exact eye-position. The practitioner fears deviation from "correct" gaze-angle.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical specificity triggers conformity-anxiety. "Self-nature of eye" suggests esoteric anatomy. The practitioner assumes precise instructions require precise execution.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural uncontrived recognition is suffocated by ocular orthodoxy. The practitioner strains to achieve "correct" gaze, creating tension and fixation. Recognition is replaced by eye-position-achievement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Teachers who specify eye-positions gain authority. The practitioner develops ophthalmological Buddhism, judging practice by gaze-criteria. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed as "incorrectly positioned."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] becomes pathological by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of actual deviations. Having worried about eye-position, the practitioner now worries about all nine deviations. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by practice-paranoia.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "vajra coil" (rdo rje lu gu rgyud) description as "the eye's suchness reveals the nature of all dharmas" is interpreted as claiming that only practitioners who master eye-gazing can truly understand Dharma.

WHY IT ARISES:
Exclusivity markers trigger elitist identification. "Reveals all dharmas" suggests master-key. The practitioner wants to possess this key.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-through-any-gate nature is lost. The practitioner believes eye-gazing is "the" method. They look down on practitioners using other approaches as "not having the vajra coil."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Lineages emphasizing eye-practices are deemed superior. The practitioner becomes sectarian about gaze-techniques. Authentic recognition is dismissed if achieved without "proper" eye-training.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. The vajra-coil becomes the mark of "superior capacity." By PAGE 476, the practitioner cannot understand deity yoga because it lacks this "essential" technique.

[COMPLETION ANXIETY] [COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The detailed object-descriptions are seen as "content to cover" so the practitioner can "finish" the four lamps section. Technical detail creates resistance, triggering "just get through it" mentality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Density of information triggers overwhelm. Detailed specifications suggest "advanced material" to complete. The practitioner wants Volume 1 credential.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The profound pointing-out in object-descriptions is missed. The practitioner skims for "the point" without absorbing recognition-contexts. Information substitutes for realization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward shallow-engagement pattern. Every detailed teaching becomes obstacle to overcome. The colophon (PAGE 479) will be dismissed as "just wrapping up."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COMPLETION ANXIETY] ensures PAGE 465-468's completion of lamp-objects is rushed. Arriving at PAGE 469-472's deviations without foundation, the practitioner misunderstands them as more "content to cover." By PAGE 479, Volume 1 is "finished" without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The object-substantialism on this page carries forward to PAGE 465's completion of lamp-objects. Each becomes another "thing" to find. By PAGE 466-468's summary, the practitioner expects "final objects." The deviations (PAGE 469-472) are reduced to "wrong objects," and the similarity-mistaken pairs (PAGE 477-478) become "similar objects to distinguish."
