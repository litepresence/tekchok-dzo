[ONTOLOGICAL, REIFICATION]

MISREADING:
Taking "'od lnga" (five lights) as referring to five specific colored lights that one should look for or visualize during practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The number five and the term "lights" suggest concrete visual phenomena. Students want to know: "What are the five colors? What should I see?"

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural radiance of awareness is reduced to color visualization. Students strain to see specific colors, missing that light is a metaphor for the clarity aspect of mind.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes fixation on visual phenomena. Students report seeing lights with pride or frustration when they don't appear.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of visualization technique, then to REIFICATION of light as objective phenomenon, and finally to EPISTEMIC confusion between metaphor and reality.

[EPISTEMIC, MEDITATIONISM]

MISREADING:
Taking the progressive stages (mirror-like mandala → piece → area → sky-filling) as a curriculum one must deliberately develop through graduated practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
The sequence suggests development from simple to complex. Educational conditioning projects curriculum structure onto the description.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The natural unfolding of recognition is replaced by progressive achievement. Each stage becomes a milestone to reach through effort.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Students feel inadequate if they don't experience the stages. Teachers design curricula to "produce" the stages artificially.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PEDAGOGICAL institutionalization of stages, then to MEDITATIONISM of stage-focused practice, and finally to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of realization as developmental achievement.

[ONTOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Understanding the three locations ("gzhi'i dbyings tsitta, lam gyi dbyings 'briguta, 'bras bu rang shar gyi dbyings") as three different psychological states or levels of consciousness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Dbyings" (space/dimension) and terms like "citta" suggest psychological categories. Modern students naturally psychologize these terms.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ontological dimensions of ground, path, and fruit are reduced to psychological experiences. Dzogchen becomes a system of mental states.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice focuses on achieving altered states rather than recognizing nature. The transcendent dimension is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to PSYCHOLOGIZATION of the entire path, then to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE through academic analysis of Dzogchen psychology, and finally to PRACTICE collapse as students chase experiences.

[REIFICATION, EPISTEMIC]

MISREADING:
Taking "mig nas 'char" (arising from the eye) as referring to the physical eye organ as the source of vision, understanding the teaching as eye-based meditation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Mig" (eye) naturally refers to the physical organ. The technical Dzogchen meaning of the "wisdom eye" or the gateway of appearance is not obvious.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practice becomes fixation on eye-based techniques: open-eye meditation, staring exercises, or eye-position manipulation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The recognition that appearance arises from the nature of mind is obscured. Students believe the physical eye creates vision.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Leads to MEDITATIONISM of eye technique, then to ONTOLOGICAL materialism of vision, and finally to SCHOLARLY debate about eye vs. mind as source.
