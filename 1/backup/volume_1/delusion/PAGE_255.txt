[10472-10486]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [DICHOTOMY ERROR]

MISREADING:
The seven bases are competing philosophical positions, and one must determine which is the "correct" view of the ground.

WHY IT ARISES:
Seven distinct formulations suggest doctrinal debate. Western philosophical frameworks seek single accurate ontology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Practitioner engages in analytical comparison to determine "best" view, missing that all seven are aspects of single rigpa.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dzogchen becomes philosophical sectarianism. Ground is fragmented into seven competing theories rather than recognized as indivisible.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] and [REIFICATION ERROR].

[REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
Each of the seven bases represents a distinct attribute or quality of the ground that can be affirmed or possessed.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Is considered" (*'dod pa*) language suggests active positing of attributes. Substantialist frameworks interpret properties as inherent characteristics.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Ground becomes objectified as entity possessing qualities (purity, spontaneity, indeterminacy, etc.) like a substance with properties.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner attempts to "access" or "realize" these qualities sequentially or collectively, turning recognition into attribute-acquisition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The quote from *Thal 'gyur* validates one specific view among the seven, proving it is the definitive Dzogchen position.

WHY IT ARISES:
Scriptural citation suggests authoritative proof-text. Academic frameworks seek textual evidence for doctrinal claims.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The sevenfold presentation is reduced to scriptural debate about which formulation is orthodox. Dzogchen becomes scholastic disputation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner quotes verses to support one view over others. The direct pointing of Dzogchen degenerates into citation-warfare.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR].

[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Transformable into anything" and "accommodating anything" means the ground is empty chaos without pattern or coherence.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Anything" interpreted as absolute randomness. Postmodern frameworks celebrate indeterminacy as liberation from structure.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Ground becomes identified with formlessness so radical that appearance itself is denied. Samsara-nirvana distinction collapses into meaninglessness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Variegated" (*khra bo*) celebrated as aesthetic of pure difference without unity. Recognition dissolves into dispersion.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EPISTEMIC ERROR] and [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR].
