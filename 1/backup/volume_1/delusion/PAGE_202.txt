[PRACTICE ERROR] [MANTRA MECHANISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The mantra "oṃ leṅ leṅ bsdus bsdus..." is interpreted as a mechanical spell with automatic efficacy, where exactly 1000 recitations guarantee the subjugation of the target regardless of the practitioner's recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Magical thinking patterns project onto mantra practice. The quantified instruction (1000 recitations) suggests measurable cause-effect mechanics. The desire for guaranteed results without recognition-work supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Mantra becomes objectified as external power-tool rather than expression of realized nature. The teaching that mantra is mind's own sound-emptiness is entirely lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners obsess over precise syllable counts and pronunciation while neglecting recognition. Competitive counting replaces contemplative inquiry. The energetic dimension of mantra is reduced to mechanical repetition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent ritual procedures are approached as mechanical operations rather than symbolic enactments of wisdom. The subtle body practices become techniques for accumulating power.

[VIEW ERROR] [SUBSTANTIALIST ERROR]

MISREADING:
The ritual diagram (chakra with eight spokes drawn with menstrual blood) is understood as possessing substantial magical power in itself, capable of automatically controlling others when properly constructed.

WHY IT ARISES:
Fetishistic object-causation patterns project onto ritual implements. The use of powerful substances (blood) suggests sympathetic magic mechanics. The desire for power-over-others supports this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic nature of ritual is entirely obscured. The teaching that all phenomena are mind's projection is abandoned for belief in the autonomous power of external objects.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners collect substances obsessively while neglecting view. Ritual performance becomes goal rather than expression. Coercive intentions develop under guise of "skillful means," justifying manipulation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING] and [PRACTICE ERROR]. Ritual success/failure is measured by external results rather than internal recognition. Subsequent pages on accomplishment methods become technique-accumulation.

[EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [SUBSTANCE FETISHISM]

MISREADING:
The substances listed (black dog heart-blood, lotus menstrual blood, donkey semen, shing ma le ge leaf juice) are treated as substantially potent materials whose physical properties cause effects, like ingredients in a chemical formula.

WHY IT ARISES:
Materialist causation frameworks are unconsciously projected. The exotic and transgressive nature of substances suggests hidden physical powers. Taboo-breaking is confused with spiritual power.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic dimension of substances (representing elements, wisdoms, purification) is entirely lost. Practice degenerates into substance-acquisition and combination rather than recognition-based transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Animal harm is justified for ritual ingredients. Black markets for "sacred substances" develop. Hygiene and ethical concerns are dismissed as "worldly considerations." The view of emptiness is abandoned for substance-obsession.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. Subsequent discussions of body practices will be approached as chemical manipulations rather than energetic recognitions.

[GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [FRUITION DEFERRAL]

MISREADING:
The distinctions between "approach," "accomplishment," "great accomplishment," and "activity" are interpreted as sequential stages requiring time to traverse, with "activity" as distant goal.

WHY IT ARISES:
Hierarchical achievement models unconsciously impose staircase-progression frameworks. The desire for increasingly advanced attainments supports temporal sequencing. Fear of "premature" activity drives deferral.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The simultaneous completeness of all four is obscured. Activity is separated from approach, creating artificial distinctions. The teaching that ground already contains fruition is entirely lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners remain perpetually in "approach" mode, deferring "activity" indefinitely. Elitist hierarchies form based on claimed stage-attainment. Recognition is replaced by stage-aspiration.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Four visions (snang ba bzhi) will be misread as temporal sequences rather than simultaneous aspects.

[PROGRESS TRACKING] [ACHIEVEMENT FETISHISM]

MISREADING:
The description of "approach" bringing supreme, medium, and lesser siddhis is interpreted as a promise of guaranteed worldly attainments (wealth, power, influence) proportionate to practice effort.

WHY IT ARISES:
Commodity-exchange frameworks project onto spiritual practice. The transactional language ("contact brings accomplishment") suggests investment-return mechanics. Desires for worldly success are spiritualized.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The siddhis are misunderstood as worldly powers rather than signs of realization. Practice becomes investment strategy for spiritual ROI. Recognition is abandoned for acquisition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Disappointment when worldly results don't manifest leads to abandonment of practice or frantic technique-switching. Comparison and competition around "attainments" poison communities. The supreme siddhi (recognition) is sacrificed for lesser gains.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent descriptions of signs and indications are treated as promises to be collected rather than pointers to recognize.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains mantra and ritual substance instructions. Preceding page (201) established consort classification errors that carry forward—practitioners will combine consort-objectification with ritual-mechanism in dangerous ways. Following pages (203+) discuss subtle body practices that will be misunderstood through lens of substance-fetishism.
