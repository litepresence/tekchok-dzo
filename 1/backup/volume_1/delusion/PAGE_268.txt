[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes "Klong drug pa" tantra describing the base free from elaboration, primordially pure, beyond words and concepts. A reader might think: "This tantra reveals the ultimate truth about the base - it's ineffable, pure, beyond all description."

WHY IT ARISES:
Tantric sources carry authority. When a tantra describes the base, we assume this is definitive revelation. The poetic language seems to encode metaphysical truths about ultimate reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats tantric descriptions as revealed metaphysics. "Beyond words" becomes a property of the base, "primordially pure" becomes its inherent nature. Tantra becomes ontology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying tantric language as ontology
2. Debating which tantra is most authoritative
3. Seeking experiences that match tantric descriptions
4. Missing that tantras are skillful means

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (tantric literalism) → REIFICATION ERROR (tantric metaphysics) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (tantric experiences). The practitioner becomes tantra-obsessed.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, ETERNALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes the "Yi ge med pa" tantra with positive descriptions: complete teachings, complete clarity, complete appearances, complete self-appearance, complete five rigpas. A reader might think: "This reveals that everything is actually complete and perfect - it's all the complete display of the base, inherently whole."

WHY IT ARISES:
After so much negation, positive descriptions are a relief. "Complete" suggests wholeness, perfection, fullness. We want to hear that everything is actually okay, perfect, complete as it is.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner adopts "everything is complete" as an ontological claim. This becomes a form of metaphysical optimism - everything is inherently perfect, nothing needs to change.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Reifying "completeness" as inherent perfection
2. Justifying present conditions as "complete"
3. Avoiding change since everything is perfect
4. Missing that completeness is recognition, not description

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (inherent perfection) → PRACTICE ERROR (no need for change) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (spiritual bypassing). The practitioner adopts false completion.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes "Rang shar" describing the original base as vast, clear, unchanging, wisdom not ceasing, various thigles radiating. A reader might think: "This is the description of the actual base - vast awareness, clear light, eternal wisdom radiating as thigles."

WHY IT ARISES:
Vivid imagery creates strong impressions. "Vast, clear, unchanging" with "thigles radiating" evokes a cosmic landscape. We naturally visualize this and take the visualization for reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies the base as a luminous field with radiating thigles. This becomes the sought-after vision - the true nature of mind as light-display with thigles.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Seeking visions of radiating thigles
2. Reifying "unchanging wisdom" as permanent awareness
3. Creating dualism: luminous base vs dark world
4. Missing that thigles are metaphors, not objects

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This leads to REIFICATION ERROR (thigles as real) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking light visions) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (luminous metaphysics). The practitioner chases lights.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text explains that this shows wisdom and light-display in primordial purity, refuting that primordial purity is mere nothingness. A reader might think: "So primordial purity IS something - it's wisdom, light, display. It's not empty in a nihilistic sense but full of positive qualities."

WHY IT ARISES:
Fear of nihilism drives us to find positive content. The assurance that primordial purity is not "nothing" but contains wisdom and light is comforting. We want the base to be something positive.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies primordial purity as containing real wisdom and light. This becomes a subtle eternalism - the base has positive qualities that survive all negation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Attributing inherent qualities to the base
2. Seeking positive experiences of "primordial purity"
3. Rejecting emptiness as "too negative"
4. Missing that qualities are imputed, not inherent

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates ETERNALISTIC ERROR (positive qualities) → REIFICATION ERROR (wisdom as inherent) → MEDITATIONISM ERROR (seeking pure experiences). The practitioner seeks positive emptiness.
