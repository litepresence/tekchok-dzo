[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The channels (rtsa) and winds (rlung) are understood as actual anatomical structures or subtle physiology to be manipulated rather than symbolic of cognitive processes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical terminology suggests physical structures. Tantric preliminary practices condition subtle body interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on how conceptual mind develops is replaced by subtle body practice. The recognition of mind's nature is obscured.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner focuses on manipulating energies rather than direct recognition. Dzogchen simplicity is lost in complexity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBTLE BODY ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Cause and condition" (rgyu rkyen) as "two" is interpreted as dualistic metaphysics rather than teaching on the inseparability of ground and display.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Two" suggests duality. Philosophical frameworks interpret cause/condition as metaphysical categories.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual teaching is replaced by dualistic causation theory. The inseparability of appearance and emptiness is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader develops philosophical understanding without recognition. The direct pointing to experience is obscured by metaphysics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PHILOSOPHICAL ERROR] and [DUALISTIC ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TEMPORAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The weekly developmental stages are interpreted as rigid temporal schema rather than symbolic of recognition's maturation.

WHY IT ARISES:
Temporal markers suggest chronological process. The seven-day units suggest measurable development.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic teaching on recognition's development is replaced by temporal expectations. Practice becomes waiting for time to pass.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner expects automatic development without recognition. The timeless nature of recognition is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [TEMPORALIZATION ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The channels of the four elements are understood as actual tubes or vessels carrying elemental energies rather than symbolic of cognitive functions.

WHY IT ARISES:
Channel imagery suggests physical conduits. The four-element theory suggests elemental physics.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on the arising of the five poisons from the elements' interaction is lost. Subtle physiology replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner learns anatomy rather than recognizing mind's nature. The pointing to immediate experience is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ANATOMICAL ERROR] and [ELEMENTAL ERROR].
