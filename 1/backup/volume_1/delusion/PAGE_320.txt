[13469-13478]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "channels of the four elements" are understood as actual subtle anatomy requiring purification or manipulation rather than symbols for cognitive processes.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Channel" suggests physical conduit. Elemental language suggests energy system.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on recognizing the nature of conceptual mind is replaced by subtle body work. Direct recognition is obscured by technique.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner manipulates channels rather than recognizing mind. Dzogchen's simplicity becomes complex energy practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SUBTLE BODY ERROR] and [TECHNIQUE ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "wisdoms not distinguished" are interpreted as actual states yet to be differentiated or achieved rather than the non-dual ground itself.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Not distinguished" suggests potential awaiting differentiation. Developmental language supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual ground is replaced by potential to actualize. The immanence of wisdom is lost in teleological becoming.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks to differentiate or develop wisdoms. The "already accomplished" nature is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [POTENTIALITY ERROR] and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The syllables (OM, JRAM, AH, etc.) are understood as actual seed mantras with inherent power rather than designations for the nature of aggregates.

WHY IT ARISES:
Syllable names suggest mantras. Seed syllable tradition supports this interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition of aggregate nature is replaced by mantra recitation. The direct pointing becomes ritual practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner recites syllables without recognizing nature. The immediacy of Dzogchen is lost in vocalization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MANTRA ERROR] and [RITUALIZATION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "buddhahood of the five aggregates" is interpreted as actual transformation of physical constituents or achievement of rainbow body.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Buddhahood" suggests goal. Aggregate transformation suggests physical process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that aggregates are already display of awareness is replaced by belief in transformation. The immanence is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner seeks to transform aggregates or achieve rainbow body. The recognition of present nature is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [RAINBOW BODY ERROR] and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].
