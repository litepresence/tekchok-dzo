[12799-12809]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Old woman" (rgan mo) representing ignorance is understood as misogynistic imagery rather than technical term for co-emergent ignorance.

WHY IT ARISES:
Gendered imagery triggers gender analysis. Modern sensitivity to sexist language supports this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The technical Dzogchen term ma rig pa is obscured by gender analysis. The teaching on co-emergent ignorance becomes feminist critique.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader either dismisses text as sexist or attempts to redeem it through reinterpretation, missing the actual technical content entirely.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [IDEOLOGICAL ERROR] and [TECHNICAL ERROR].

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The "lineage not determined" (rus ma nges pa) is interpreted as social commentary on caste/class rather than teaching on the ground's neutrality.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Lineage" suggests social hierarchy. Contemporary concerns with social justice support this reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that the ground appears for both delusion and liberation is lost. Dzogchen ontology is replaced by social critique.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader believes they are extracting "deeper meaning" while missing the surface-level technical instruction entirely.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SOCIOLOGICAL COLLAPSE ERROR] and [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].

[SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR] [MORALISTIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The narrative of killing the old woman and eating flesh, drinking blood is understood as literal violence or as endorsement of transgressive behavior.

WHY IT ARISES:
Violent imagery triggers moral outrage or fascination with transgression. Taboo-breaking suggests antinomian practice.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The symbolic language pointing to recognition without rejection (spang blang) is either dismissed as barbaric or literalized as license for harmful behavior.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader either rejects the teaching or adopts harmful practices. The middle way of recognition without acceptance/rejection is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ANTINOMIAN ERROR] or [MORALISTIC REJECTION ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
"Fire deity" (me lha) is understood as actual deity to be propitiated or visualized rather than symbol for self-recognizing wisdom.

WHY IT ARISES:
Deity names trigger deity yoga practice. Tantric preliminary training conditions deity-based interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Self-recognizing wisdom is externalized as deity. The teaching that wisdom arises naturally when ignorance is recognized is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner performs deity yoga rather than direct recognition. The unique Dzogchen approach is replaced by common tantric practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [DEITY EXTERNALIZATION ERROR] and [TANTRIC COLLAPSE ERROR].
