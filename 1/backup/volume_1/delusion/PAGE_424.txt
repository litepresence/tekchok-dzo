[DEFINITIONAL ERROR] [ESSENTIALIST ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17887-17902 present formal definitions of mind: "What arises as grasper-grasped object-subject is non-aware pervader" as essence, "grasper-grasped arising object-subject, thus called mind" as definition. The reader treats these as establishing the essential nature of mind through precise conceptual determination.

WHY IT ARISES:
The format (essence, definition, division) follows traditional scholastic methodology that appears to nail down exact meanings. The systematic presentation suggests comprehensive understanding. Academic training values precise definitions as foundations of knowledge. The desire for certainty about "what mind really is" drives acceptance of these definitions as definitive.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Mind becomes conceptualized according to these definitions rather than investigated directly. The definitions, which are actually pedagogical tools pointing to what cannot be defined, become objects of knowledge. The distinction between conceptual label and direct experience is collapsed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may believe they "know what mind is" because they can recite the definitions. Direct investigation is replaced by conceptual understanding. The fluid, ungraspable nature of mind is obscured by the sense that it has been captured in words. Meditation becomes thinking about the definitions rather than looking at mind.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CONCEPTUALISM ERROR] where definitions substitute for recognition, [SATISFACTION ERROR] where intellectual clarity prevents deeper inquiry, and [RECITATION ERROR] where verbal knowledge is mistaken for understanding. Also activates [FIXATION ERROR] where practitioners grasp at specific definitions.

[TYPOLOGICAL ERROR] [CLASSIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17891-17902 distinguish "pure mind" and "impure mind," with further divisions into "pure mind" and "mind-itself pure." The typology is understood as a comprehensive classification system describing actual types of mind that exist.

WHY IT ARISES:
The hierarchical classification (pure/impure, then subdivisions) resembles scientific or psychological typologies. The systematic enumeration suggests completeness. Modern education trains us to value classification systems. The appearance of order and structure invites acceptance of the categories as objectively real.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The categories become reified as actual divisions in reality. The fundamental point—that all such distinctions are provisional, pedagogical, and ultimately empty—is lost. Practice becomes about identifying which "type" of mind is present rather than seeing through all fixation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may identify themselves as having certain types of mind, creating new forms of self-grasping. They may judge experiences as "pure" or "impure" according to the typology. The natural, undivided nature of awareness is obscured by the sense of multiple categories.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [IDENTITY ERROR] where spiritual typology replaces personality, [JUDGMENT ERROR] where experiences are constantly evaluated, and [SEPARATION ERROR] where recognizing a "type" becomes another object of knowledge. Also activates [ELITISM ERROR] where "pure" types are valued over others.

[PATH ERROR] [GRADUALISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17903-17911 describe mind at "path time" as "conception-through-uncorrupted liberation-cause-suitable samadhi" and quote the Precious Garland on "emptiness compassion essence-possess enlightenment accomplish." The reader understands this as describing an actual path with stages where certain causes produce enlightenment.

WHY IT ARISES:
The language of "path time," "cause," and "accomplishment" naturally suggests temporal progression. The citation from Nagarjuna's Precious Garland appears to establish the causal structure. Buddhist path language (lam) is habitually read through developmental frameworks. The desire for clear direction drives acceptance of staged models.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Enlightenment becomes objectified as a result to be achieved through specific causes and conditions. The understanding that path and result are not different—that recognition IS the path and the result—is lost. Practice becomes instrumental, focused on producing results rather than recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may obsess about whether they are "on the path," what stage they have reached, and what causes they need to accumulate. The natural, spontaneous quality of recognition is obscured by the sense of a journey with distance to travel. Present experience is devalued in favor of future attainment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS ERROR] where practice is measured by advancement, [ACCUMULATION ERROR] where causes are stockpiled, and [FUTURE ORIENTATION ERROR] where present recognition is missed. Also activates [INSTRUMENTALISM ERROR] where practice becomes goal-oriented.

[SCRIPTURAL ERROR] [AUTHORITY ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17912-17919 cite the Uttaratantra: "Self-arisen ultimate that faith itself realization object on sun mandala clear-light though eye not-possess through of see nonexistent." The citation is treated as authoritative proof establishing the nature of ultimate reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
The quotation from a major treatise (Maitreya's Uttaratantra) carries significant weight. The scriptural citation format suggests proof or validation. Traditional study emphasizes the authority of major texts. The desire for certainty drives attachment to scriptural authority.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The pointing function of the metaphor (sun mandala, clear light, eye not possessing) is lost. The citation becomes a doctrinal statement about reality rather than an invitation to recognize. The living meaning is replaced by bibliographic knowledge.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may accumulate scriptural references as proof of view without investigating the actual meaning. Debates about interpretation substitute for recognition. The experiential dimension is lost in favor of textual authority.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [BIBLIOGRAPHY ERROR] where knowledge of sources substitutes for understanding, [INTERPRETATION ERROR] where debates about meaning replace experience, and [AUTHORITY DEPENDENCY] where external validation is required. Also activates [CANON ERROR] where texts are treated as revelation.

[PHENOMENOLOGICAL ERROR] [APPEARANCE ERROR]

MISREADING:
Lines 17920-17944 describe the "extensively-explained impure mind" with detailed phenomenology: "from expanse impure nonexistent though that from move time basis-appearance from cut impossible what also arise." The reader understands this as describing actual processes of how impurity arises from purity.

WHY IT ARISES:
The detailed phenomenological description appears to explain the mechanism of delusion. The language of arising, moving, and cutting suggests processes in time. The comprehensiveness invites acceptance as an accurate description. The desire to understand "how samsara happens" drives engagement.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Samsara becomes objectified as a real process with stages and mechanisms. The understanding that all descriptions of arising are provisional and ultimately empty is lost. Practice becomes about understanding the process rather than recognizing the emptiness of all process-description.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners may study the phenomenology of delusion extensively, believing understanding it will lead to liberation. The direct recognition that none of this actually happens—that there is no real arising, no real process—is obscured. Complexity becomes a substitute for simplicity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MECHANISM ERROR] where processes are studied as real, [COMPLEXITY ERROR] where elaborate descriptions substitute for recognition, and [ONTOLOGY ERROR] where phenomenology is taken as ontology. Also activates [ANALYSIS PARALYSIS] where endless study prevents practice.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 424 introduces formal definitions and typologies that amplify definitional and classificatory errors. The detailed phenomenology of impure mind's arising sets up process-oriented understanding that will be expanded in page 425. Page 425 will present the most elaborate hierarchical structures of the entire section (root ignorance, mind divisions, affliction enumerations), making analytical and enumeration errors particularly likely. The path language on this page establishes temporal frameworks that will recur throughout. The Uttaratantra citation and others set up scriptural authority patterns. The pure/impure distinctions introduced here will be elaborated extensively in subsequent pages and must be recognized as provisional throughout. The phenomenological description of arising processes will be detailed further, risking mechanistic interpretation.
