[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The four lamps (*སྒྲོན་མ་བཞི་) are interpreted as meditation objects or techniques to be applied—specifically that one should practice with distant water lamp, empty bindu lamp, and self-arisen wisdom lamp as graduated stages.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumeration (four lamps) triggers categorical thinking. "Essential point" (*གནད་) suggests technique. Western practitioners habitually transform descriptions into prescriptions—"these are the four practices I should do."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes systematic lamp-cultivation practice. Natural self-arising of awareness-display is replaced by deliberate application of techniques. "Maturing" (*སྨིན་) and "entering" (*འཇུག་) are interpreted as something the practitioner causes.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Empty bindu lamp" (*ཐིག་ལེ་སྟོང་པའི་སྒྲོན་མ་) is sought as specific experience. "Distant water lamp" (*རྒྱང་ཞགས་ཆུའི་སྒྲོན་མ་) becomes visualization target. "Self-arisen wisdom lamp" (*ཤེས་རབ་རང་བྱུང་གི་སྒྲོན་མ་) is treated as advanced attainment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where lamp-experiences become progress markers. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as practitioners fixate on achieving specific visions. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as lamp-stages are taught sequentially.

[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]

MISREADING:
The detailed instructions for looking posture, sun and moon training, and "drawing" with expanse are interpreted as specific techniques to be practiced regularly to achieve thodgal visions and eventually manifest the body of light.

WHY IT ARISES:
Prescriptive language (*བསླབ་, *བྱ་, *སྦྱར་) triggers procedural reading. "Training" suggests effort. The promise of body of light (*ལུས་འབྱུང་) attracts achievement-oriented practitioners.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes goal-oriented practice with stages—first stabilize looking posture, then train with sun and moon, eventually achieve rainbow body. Natural display is replaced by deliberate cultivation. Spontaneity is undermined.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Cutting off deluded appearances" (*འཁྲུལ་པའི་སྣང་བ་རྒྱུན་ཆད་) is interpreted as result of practice rather than recognition. "Five wisdoms' light" (*ཡེ་ཤེས་ལྔ་ཡི་འོད་) becomes something to achieve. The formless is forced into form.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where rainbow body becomes the goal. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as progressive stages are institutionalized. [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] proliferates—believing light-body is truly existent attainment.

[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The statement that the lamps "cut the connected stream of habitual patterns" and "abandon samsara" is interpreted as asserting that thodgal practice gradually purifies obscurations through the force of experience—gradualist framework applied to Atiyoga.

WHY IT ARISES:
Cause-effect language (*གཅོད་, *སྤོང་) triggers gradualist reading. "Abandon samsara" sounds like result of practice. Western spiritual frameworks interpret Dzogchen through developmental psychology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen view collapses into gradual purification. The direct recognition of primordial purity is replaced by progressive cleansing through lamp-practice. "Primordially pure" (*ཀ་དག་) is misunderstood as achieved purity.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The four lamps become purifying agents. "Essential point gathering Buddha's intent" (*སངས་རྒྱས་དགོངས་པའི་གནད་འདུས་) is interpreted as achieved through effort. Natural liberation becomes gradual elimination.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [VIEW COLLAPSE] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] where thodgal is practiced as purification method. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as gradual paths are mapped onto Dzogchen. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] proliferates when sutric frameworks are applied to Atiyoga.
