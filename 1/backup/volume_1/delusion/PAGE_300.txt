[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, OBSTRUCTIVE-FORCES-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes "Vow break action many do definitely place mind that all-by-means-of appearance to I-by-means-of be and other-by-means-of be think that definitely place mind that grasp thought-by-means-of ignorance called remedy path-by-means-of ignorance." A reader might think: "Breaking vows creates forces that grasp at appearances and self. These are actual obstructive entities generated by negative action. I need purification practices."

WHY IT ARISES:
Moral causality suggests generated forces. Western guilt creates fear of karmic consequences. "Definitely place mind" sounds like created entities.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner reifies broken-vow consequences as actual forces, seeking purification to eliminate them.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Guilt drives purification obsession
2. Forces are treated as real obstacles
3. Natural purity is obscured by purification
4. Dzogchen becomes sin-management

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates OBSTRUCTIVE-FORCES-ERROR (karmic literalism) → PRACTICE ERROR (purification obsession) → REIFICATION ERROR (sins as entities). The practitioner scrubs their karma.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show and now delusion manner and delusion reverse manner sequence symbol door from extensive show to eight from." A reader might think: "The text has a precise structure—nine sections on divergence, then eight doors on reversal. Understanding this architecture is essential."

WHY IT ARISES:
Structural analysis appeals to Western academic minds. The numerical precision suggests intentional design. Architecture implies engineering principles.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes the text's structure, believing architectural understanding reveals meaning.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Form replaces content
2. Structure is analyzed rather than recognized
3. Natural pointing is missed in architecture
4. Dzogchen becomes structural engineering

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS-ERROR (architectural fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (endless analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (form for content). The practitioner studies the building instead of entering.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MULTIPLICITY-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists "Friend four do then wild-man five arise then back-support one arise then thief one arise that all accumulate-by-means-of one arise that etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise that etc. measure-not-possess-as delude." A reader might think: "These specific numbers—four, five, one, one—have numerological significance. I need to understand the pattern of accumulation."

WHY IT ARISES:
Numerical patterns suggest esoteric codes. Western numerology seeks hidden meanings. The accumulation arithmetic implies calculable process.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes the numerical pattern, seeking numerological significance in the accumulating forces.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Numbers are esotericized
2. Arithmetic replaces recognition
3. Pattern is sought in description
4. Dzogchen becomes numerology

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates MULTIPLICITY-ERROR (numerological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (pattern-seeking) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (numbers as powers). The practitioner counts their obstacles.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, DELUSION-BASIS-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text concludes "That from delusion-basis not-possess from arise-by-means-of cause although there-not is basis that delusion not-possess from arise although delude." A reader might think: "Even though delusion-basis doesn't exist, it still arises as cause. This is the mystery—how non-existent basis produces apparent delusion. I need to solve this paradox."

WHY IT ARISES:
Paradoxes fascinate Western philosophical minds. The contradiction between "not-possess" and "arise" invites analysis. Solving paradoxes seems like wisdom.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to philosophically resolve the paradox of non-existent basis producing delusion.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Paradox is approached intellectually
2. Resolution is sought conceptually
3. The mystery is explained away
4. Dzogchen becomes philosophy puzzle

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates DELUSION-BASIS-ERROR (paradox fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (philosophical analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (resolution for understanding). The philosopher solves the unsolvable.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOLOGICAL-DETAIL-ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text lists specific delusion scenarios: "Field Broad called from delude place Beautiful called from delude time when destroyed and delude year Pig year to delude sun Created sun to delude star Bird to delude human name Old-one Heap-possess called delude." A reader might think: "These are specific astrological and historical conditions that trigger delusion. I must avoid these times and names."

WHY IT ARISES:
Specific details suggest actionable information. Western astrology and superstition seek to avoid inauspicious conditions. The particulars seem meaningful.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner treats the details as astrological warnings, seeking to avoid specific times and circumstances.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. External conditions are controlled
2. Superstition replaces recognition
3. Life is constrained by avoidance
4. Dzogchen becomes divination

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates COSMOLOGICAL-DETAIL-ERROR (superstitious literalism) → PRACTICE ERROR (avoidance behavior) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (conditions as determining). The practitioner consults their horoscope.
