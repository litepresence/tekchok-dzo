[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The transition from fifteen metaphors to the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) is interpreted as moving from "preliminary analogies" to "actual metaphysical structures." The practitioner believes the four lamps describe real ontological entities in the subtle body rather than recognition-contexts.

WHY IT ARISES:
The technical terminology (distant water lamp, wisdom lamp, thigle lamp, space lamp) triggers "insider knowledge" satisfaction. The practitioner assumes sophisticated vocabulary indicates sophisticated reality. "Lamp of distant water" becomes a thing to find rather than a way of seeing.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The four lamps are reified into four objects of meditation. The practitioner searches for "the distant water lamp" in their visual field, believing it to be a specific light-experience. The pointing-out function collapses into object-grasping.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation practice becomes lamp-hunting. The practitioner compares notes on "which lamp they saw today." Communities form around different lamp-experiences, creating new sectarian divisions in Dzogchen practice. Recognition is replaced by lamp-sighting.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] intensifies through PAGE 463-468 as the four lamps are elaborated. Each lamp-description becomes a new experience-target. By PAGE 469-472's deviations, the practitioner has already accumulated years of lamp-chasing, making the recognition-based deviations incomprehensible. The volume's conclusion (PAGE 479) finds them exhausted from the chase.

[EXPERIENCE CHASING] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The distinction between the four lamps is interpreted as a hierarchy of experiences, with the "lamp of pristine cognition" being superior to the "distant water lamp." The practitioner believes they must progress through the lamps sequentially, collecting each as an attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Progressive path psychology assumes development through stages. The numbered list (four lamps) triggers sequential achievement patterns. The practitioner unconsciously maps their meditation "career" onto the four-lamp framework, creating a new curriculum.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awareness is fragmented into four hierarchical experiences. The practitioner feels "behind" if they haven't "reached" the thigle lamp. Those who claim higher lamp-experiences are revered. The equal nature of all lamps as pointing-out instructions is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes strategic: "How do I progress from lamp one to lamp two?" The practitioner studies techniques for "activating" each lamp, turning recognition into manipulation. Dzogchen becomes a technology of experience-production.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] spreads to PAGE 473-475 where actual capacity distinctions are discussed. Having created lamp-hierarchies, the practitioner now reads capacity-differences through this lens. By PAGE 479, they have constructed an elaborate identity as "one who has mastered the four lamps," completely missing that the lamps were never meant to be mastered.

[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The detailed characteristics of each lamp are interpreted as precise specifications that must be exactly replicated in experience. The practitioner fears that any deviation from these specifications indicates wrong practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical detail triggers precision-anxiety. The practitioner believes that "authentic practice" requires matching experience to description. "Characteristic of distant water lamp" becomes a standard against which they judge their meditation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Spontaneous recognition is suffocated by specification-matching. The practitioner cannot rest in awareness because they are constantly checking: "Is this the right kind of clarity? Is this the correct pervasion?" The lamps' pointing function is replaced by conformity-anxiety.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner develops orthodoxies around "correct lamp-experience." Teachers who confirm specific experiences are valued; those who emphasize recognition are dismissed. A culture of "lamp-validation" emerges, replacing direct pointing.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] becomes entrenched by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of actual deviations. Having worried about lamp-specificity, the practitioner now obsesses over deviation-specificity. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by fear of practice-mistakes, unable to recognize that deviation from recognition is the only real deviation.

[COMPLETION ANXIETY] [COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [EPISTEMIC ERROR]

MISREADING:
The four lamps section is seen as "the main point" of Volume 1, leading the practitioner to rush through understanding it so they can "complete" the volume and move to Volume 2. The detailed exposition becomes something to "get through."

WHY IT ARISES:
Future-orientation always seeks the next thing. The technical density of the four lamps creates resistance, triggering "just get it done" psychology. The practitioner wants the "credential" of Volume 1 completion.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The four lamps' profound pointing-out instructions are skimmed rather than absorbed. The practitioner knows ABOUT the four lamps without knowing the four lamps. Information substitutes for recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward a pattern of shallow engagement. Every teaching becomes something to "complete" rather than something to realize. The colophon (PAGE 479) will be dismissed entirely as "just the ending."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COMPLETION ANXIETY] ensures that PAGE 463-468's detailed exposition of the four lamps is never properly digested. The practitioner arrives at PAGE 469-472's deviations without foundation, misunderstands them, and by PAGE 479 has "completed" Volume 1 without having begun it. The dedication and seal are skipped, leaving the teaching ungrounded.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The four lamps are interpreted as describing four "higher states of consciousness" accessible only to advanced practitioners. The technical vocabulary is used to gatekeep Dzogchen, with claims like "You must realize the four lamps to be a real Dzogchen practitioner."

WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual materialism seeks exclusivity markers. The sophisticated terminology signals "advanced teaching," triggering elitist appropriation. The practitioner wants to belong to the "four-lamp club."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is reduced to an esoteric experience-package. The practitioner believes that "having" the four lamp-experiences constitutes realization. The simple recognition of awareness is deemed "beginner-level" compared to these "advanced" lamps.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Teachers who emphasize ordinary awareness are dismissed as "not teaching the profound four lamps." Teachers who detail lamp-experiences are sought after, regardless of their understanding. Authentic pointing-out is replaced by esoteric initiation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's discussion of different practitioner capacities. The four-lamp hierarchy becomes the lens through which all capacity-distinctions are read. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed an entire spiritual identity around "four-lamp realization," having missed that the lamps were simply pointers to what was already present.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The substantialization of the four lamps on this page carries forward to PAGE 463-468, where each lamp is elaborated in detail. The experience-chasing practitioner now seeks these elaborated details as experiences. The elitist practitioner claims mastery of these details. The deviation-obsessed practitioner fears misaligning with these details. And all rush toward PAGE 479's colophon without having recognized what the lamps were pointing to.
