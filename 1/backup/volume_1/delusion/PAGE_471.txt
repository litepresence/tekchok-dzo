[DEVIATION CONFUSION] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The instruction that "cutting deviations" requires "settling recognition with its radiance at the sense-gates" is interpreted as technique to be executed precisely.

WHY IT ARISES:
Instructional language triggers technique-assumption. "Settling" suggests action. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate procedures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-effort nature of recognition is obscured by technique-anxiety. The practitioner worries about "correct settling." Recognition is replaced by position-achievement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Settling techniques" proliferate. Teachers who specify precise methods gain authority. The authentic recognition that recognition is not a position is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] continues through PAGE 472's deviation-details. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by technique-accumulation.

[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]

MISREADING:
The distinction between "those with deviations" (sem lam byed) and "those who see directly" (rig pa mngon sum) is interpreted as establishing ontological practitioner-types.

WHY IT ARISES:
Typological language triggers essentialism. "See directly" suggests superior capacity. The practitioner wants superior type.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-to-all nature is lost. Direct-seeing becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes some are inherently "direct-seeers."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Direct-seer" becomes exclusive identity. Mind-path practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that direct-seeing is simply present recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Direct-seeing status becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "being direct-seer."

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The description of "not going to extremes of dullness or excitation" and "not being moved by conceptual investigation" is interpreted as precise phenomenological standards to maintain.

WHY IT ARISES:
Phenomenological language triggers experience-matching. "Not" suggests prohibition. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate requirements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural recognition is suffocated by state-monitoring. The practitioner constantly checks: "Am I dull? Excited? Conceptual?" Self-policing replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
State-anxiety consumes practice. Teachers promising "correct state" validation gain authority. The authentic recognition that states don't matter is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. State-distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is trapped in state-optimization.

[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]

MISREADING:
The approach to volume's end triggers "just finish" mentality. The practitioner wants to "complete deviations" and reach colophon.

WHY IT ARISES:
Proximity to end triggers momentum. Dense technical content creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "closure."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration-function of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "finished" deviations without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern. Final sections are skimmed. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "just ending."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 472's deviation-cuts are not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's importance.

[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]

MISREADING:
The "spontaneous liberation" (thal byung du grol) and "arising-there liberated" (shar thog tu grol) descriptions are interpreted as special attainment-marks.

WHY IT ARISES:
Liberation-language triggers achievement-association. "Spontaneous" suggests advanced. The practitioner wants spontaneous-liberation status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The always-already nature of liberation is lost. Spontaneous liberation becomes elite experience. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is insufficient.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Spontaneously liberated" becomes exclusive identity. Gradual practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that liberation is not an attainment is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Liberation-metaphors are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "achieved" spontaneous liberation conceptually.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The deviation-resolution on this page carries to PAGE 472's elaboration. By PAGE 473-475's practitioner-types, resolution-status determines type. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with "resolved" complacency.
