[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]

MISREADING:
The root awareness kāya as "vajra chain-linked body not ceased in own eye sense-power" is interpreted as asserting that thodgal visions are literally perceived through physical eyes as external objects—sensory experience of subtle forms.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Eye sense-power" (*མིག་གི་དབང་པོ་) triggers sensory reading. "Clear" (*གསལ་) suggests visual perception. Western visual culture unconsciously projects ocular seeing onto thodgal.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal is reduced to visual phenomenon—external light forms seen with eyes. The non-dual self-display (*རང་སྣང་) of awareness is lost. Practitioners seek visual experiences as thodgal signs.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Vajra chain-linked" (*རྡོ་རྗེ་ལུ་གུ་རྒྱུད་) becomes specific visual pattern to look for. Root awareness is localized in eye faculty. The formless dharmakāya is reduced to perceptible form.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [EPISTEMIC ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR]—staring at skies, pressing eyes, seeking visions. [REIFICATION ERROR] follows as visions are taken as wisdom itself. [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] proliferates.

[NIHILISTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The statement "no ignorance, no mind, no intellect, no grasping" is interpreted as nihilistic denial—that these phenomena literally do not exist at all, neither conventionally nor ultimately, resulting in blank voidism.

WHY IT ARISES:
Negation language (*མེད་) triggers nihilistic reading. "No" suggests absolute absence. Western practitioners conflate emptiness with non-existence.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The two truths collapse. The conventional reality of mind and ignorance is denied. Practitioners adopt blank non-conceptuality as goal, missing the wisdom that recognizes appearance as empty.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Vast dharmatā kāya" (*ཡངས་པ་ཆོས་ཉིད་ཀྱི་སྐུ་) is interpreted as void. "Uninterrupted wisdom" becomes non-functioning blankness. The productive negation (*མེད་དགག་) of Mādhyamaka is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [NIHILISTIC ERROR] produces [PRACTICE ERROR] where meditation becomes blanking out. [EPISTEMIC ERROR] follows as students cannot distinguish nihilism from emptiness. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] proliferates.

[ETERNALISTIC ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The positive characterizations—"spontaneously accomplished Buddha," "dharmatā free from elaboration," "pure great appearance"—are interpreted as asserting truly existing positive attributes of the ground, reifying the basis as having inherent qualities.

WHY IT ARISES:
Positive terminology (*ལྷུན་གྱིས་གྲུབ་པ་, *དག་པ་ཆེན་པོ་) triggers eternalistic reading. After negations, practitioners grasp at positive descriptions as something to hold onto.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The ground (*གཞི་) is reified as possessing inherent qualities—spontaneity, purity, appearance. "View without falling to extremes" becomes another position. The emptiness of the ground is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Self-existing wisdom" (*རང་བྱུང་གི་ཡེ་ཤེས་) is treated as possessed attribute. "Unceasing bindu radiance" becomes characteristic of true nature. The formless is given form through attribution.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] triggers [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] where ground is conceived as substratum with properties. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as practitioners seek to stabilize in these qualities. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The extensive expanse kāya (*གདལ་བ་དབྱིངས་ཀྱི་སྐུ་) with its fifteen characteristics is interpreted as asserting a truly existing vast container or field that has specific properties—an elaborate metaphysics of space.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial language (*དབྱིངས་, *ཡངས་པ་, *ཕྱོགས་) triggers reification of expanse. Enumeration (fifteen characteristics) suggests categorical ontology. Western metaphysics encourages mapping these as properties of Being.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dharmadhātu is reified as container or field. The fifteen characteristics become attributes of this space. Natural display is replaced by metaphysical system.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Without increase or decrease" (*འཕེལ་འགྲིབ་མེད་པ་) is treated as property of the expanse. "Place where many kāyas arise" suggests location. "Buddha of view-seeing" becomes entity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is reduced to elaborate metaphysics. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] follows as expanse is reified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates as students study characteristics.
