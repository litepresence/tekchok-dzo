ERROR TYPE 1: [WRONG VIEW EXTINCTION FANTASY] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The detailed refutation of 360 wrong views is interpreted as establishing that liberation requires the extinction or elimination of all wrong views through systematic refutation, rather than recognizing that wrong views self-liberate when their empty nature is recognized.

WHY IT ARISES:
Purification mentality assumes errors must be eliminated. The comprehensive refutation suggests active destruction is needed. The practitioner believes wrong views are obstacles to be removed. Western education emphasizes correcting errors.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to eliminate wrong views through intellectual refutation. Mental energy is spent arguing against positions. The recognition that wrong views are empty appearances is missed. Battle with concepts replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Aggressive anti-wrong-view stance develops. The practitioner becomes a "Dharma warrior" fighting misconceptions. Compassion for those holding wrong views is replaced by polemical zeal. The gentle nature of wisdom is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This feeds [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] where liberation is deferred until "all wrong views are refuted." It generates [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] where teaching becomes debate rather than pointing-out.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 2: [NON-BUDDHIST INFERIORITY COMPLEX] [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The presentation of tirthika (non-Buddhist) views as "wrong" (log pa) is interpreted as establishing absolute Buddhist superiority, encouraging contempt for other traditions and the assumption that all non-Buddhist teachings are without value.

WHY IT ARISES:
Religious identity requires feeling special. The text's clear distinctions invite hierarchical thinking. The practitioner wants validation of their choice. Cultural chauvinism masquerades as doctrinal correctness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner develops sectarian arrogance. All non-Buddhist wisdom is dismissed. The recognition that truth is not the monopoly of any tradition is blocked. Openness to universal wisdom is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Interfaith hostility develops. The practitioner cannot learn from other traditions. Dialogue becomes conversion. The universal nature of pointing-out instructions is obscured by Buddhist exclusivism.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] where Buddhist views are considered absolutely superior. It generates [SUTRA DISMISSAL] when practitioners arrogantly dismiss all non-Buddhist teachings as "mere wrong view."

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 3: [CORRECT VIEW ACQUISITION] [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The presentation of Buddhist vehicles as "correct" (yang dag) is interpreted as establishing that liberation comes from acquiring the correct view and abandoning wrong views, rather than recognizing that all views including correct ones are conventional designations pointing to the inexpressible.

WHY IT ARISES:
Causal thinking assumes correct causes produce correct results. The practitioner believes right view causes enlightenment. Educational systems emphasize correct answers. Religious traditions valorize orthodoxy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues "correct Buddhist view" as the goal. Intellectual orthodoxy replaces direct recognition. The emptiness of all views is missed in favor of attachment to "correct" view.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Doctrinal fundamentalism develops. The practitioner judges others by their view-correctness. Debate about fine points replaces practice. The transformative purpose of teachings is lost in scholastic wrangling.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This feeds [VIEW COLLAPSE] where conceptual understanding of correct view is mistaken for realization. It generates [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] where teaching focuses on doctrinal correctness rather than pointing to recognition.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 4: [VEHICLE PROGRESSION LADDER] [PROGRESSION MYTH]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The transition from wrong views to Sravaka vehicle is interpreted as the beginning of a progressive ladder where each vehicle is higher than the last, establishing a hierarchy from worldly to transcendent, Hinayana to Mahayana, sutra to tantra.

WHY IT ARISES:
Developmental psychology expects progression. The text's structure suggests ascent. The practitioner wants to know "where am I on the path." Spiritual marketing emphasizes advanced teachings.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner becomes obsessed with vehicle-identification. "I am a Mahayana practitioner" becomes ego-identity. Lower vehicles are looked down upon. The recognition that all vehicles are skillful means is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner rushes to "higher" vehicles without foundation. Sravaka and Pratyekabuddha teachings are dismissed as "too basic." The gradual accumulation of wisdom is replaced by ambition for advanced status.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] where higher-numbered vehicles are pursued for status. It generates [TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] where advanced practices are taken up without proper foundation.

================================================================================
ERROR TYPE 5: [TRANSCENDENT/WORLDLY DUALISM] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
================================================================================

MISREADING:
The distinction between worldly vehicles (jig rten pa'i theg pa) and transcendent vehicles ('jig rten las 'das pa'i theg pa) is interpreted as establishing an ontological dualism between ordinary and sacred, samsara and nirvana as distinct realms, rather than recognizing their inseparability.

WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic thinking habitually creates sacred/profane distinctions. The practitioner wants to escape the worldly. Religious traditions often posit transcendent realms. The language of "beyond world" suggests separate domain.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues transcendence as escape from world. Ordinary life is devalued. "Transcendent practice" becomes special activity separate from daily life. The natural perfection of all experience is denied.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual escapism develops. The practitioner neglects worldly responsibilities. Relationships and work are seen as obstacles. The integration of practice and daily life collapses into dualistic separation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This produces [SUTRA DISMISSAL] where worldly Dharma is rejected in favor of transcendent. It generates [NIHILISTIC ERROR] where the world is dismissed as worthless illusion.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS
================================================================================

PREVIOUS PAGE (59) CONTEXT:
Page 59 completed the extensive analysis of 360 wrong views. Page 60 marks the transition from wrong views to the presentation of correct Buddhist vehicles, beginning with the Sravaka vehicle as the foundation of transcendent Dharma.

NEXT PAGE (61) ANTICIPATION:
The text will begin detailed presentation of the Sravaka vehicle—its definition, etymology, divisions, purpose, and result. This marks the beginning of the systematic exposition of the nine vehicles.

CRITICAL CONTINUITY POINT:
The transition from wrong views to Sravaka vehicle is not a jump from "wrong" to "right" but the beginning of skillful means appropriate for certain capacities. The practitioner must not develop superiority complex about being "finally on the right track."

BLEED RISK:
High. The transition invites "we've finally arrived at truth" thinking. The Sravaka vehicle may be dismissed as "too basic" or, conversely, practitioners may become attached to it as "sufficient."
