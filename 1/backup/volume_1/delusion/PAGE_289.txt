[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text quotes the Pearl Garland: "Difference great-by-means-of appearance from exist and not-possess two arise common ground delusion-basis called ignorance self and mix-by-means-of cause." A reader might think: "Delusion arises from mixing self with causes. I need to unmix them, separate self from conditioning, to find the common ground."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Mix" and "unmix" suggest psychological processes of identification and disidentification. Western therapy works with these patterns. The "common ground" sounds like healthy baseline.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates a therapeutic project of "unmixing" self from ignorance and conditions, seeking to return to a pure "common ground" of separation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Delusion is treated as psychological mixing
2. Therapy replaces recognition
3. Common ground is reified as separate state
4. Dzogchen becomes self-help

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (delusion as mixing) → PRACTICE ERROR (unmixing project) → REIFICATION ERROR (common ground as state). The practitioner becomes their own therapist.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, CAUSAL ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes dependent origination: "Compassion sentient-being to appear capacity possess that to grasp-maker-by-means-of consciousness ignorance part from arise fracture one shift from consciousness dark that from I arise." A reader might think: "This is explaining how samsara works—through a causal chain from compassion through grasping to I-making. I need to understand this mechanism."

WHY IT ARISES:
The causal description sounds like a mechanism to understand. Westerners seek explanations for how things work. The chain of dependent origination appears as a process to analyze.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner analyzes dependent origination as a causal mechanism, seeking to understand how samsara "works." They try to intervene in the causal chain.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Dependent origination is reified as mechanism
2. Intervention strategies are developed
3. The empty nature of causality is missed
4. Dzogchen becomes engineering

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates CAUSAL ERROR (mechanistic thinking) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding for liberation) → PRACTICE ERROR (intervening in causality). The practitioner tries to fix the samsara machine.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text describes conditions: "Master condition mirror and face and self actual direct grasp-by-means-of face and mirror-as understand like light and awareness and reality three-as understand-by-means-of master condition called." A reader might think: "The master condition is like a mirror—I need to understand face, light, and awareness as conditions to master. This is a practice of condition-mastery."

WHY IT ARISES:
"Master condition" suggests something to control or master. Westerners want mastery and control. The mirror metaphor seems to offer a method for understanding conditions.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts to "master conditions" by understanding them through mirror-like reflection. They try to control the conditions of appearance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Conditions are approached as controllable
2. Mirror becomes technique for mastery
3. Spontaneity is replaced with management
4. Natural unfolding is suppressed

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates PRACTICE ERROR (condition-mastery) → REIFICATION ERROR (conditions as controllable) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mastery over spontaneity). The practitioner becomes a spiritual control freak.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, TIME ERROR]

MISREADING:
The text states "Time to certainty not-possess-by-means-of time before after mutually conflict-by-means-of equal immediate condition self place liberate." A reader might think: "Time is uncertain and conflicting. I need to transcend time into the immediate condition where past and future don't conflict."

WHY IT ARISES:
Time anxiety is universal. The mention of time's uncertainty triggers desire for timelessness. "Equal immediate condition" sounds like an eternal present to escape to.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner seeks to escape time into an "immediate condition" of eternal present. They reject temporal experience for timelessness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Time is rejected as obstacle
2. "Immediate" is reified as timeless state
3. Natural time is denied
4. Escapism replaces recognition

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates TIME ERROR (escaping temporality) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking timelessness) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (immediate as escape). The practitioner tries to stop time.
