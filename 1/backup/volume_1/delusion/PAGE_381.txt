[15922-15924]
[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [EFFORTLESS APPROPRIATION]

MISREADING:
The distinction between effortful (rtsol bcas) and effortless (rtsol med) systems is a hierarchical progression from lower to higher.

WHY IT ARISES:
Natural assumption that "effortless" is superior. Common marketing of "direct path" over gradual methods.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Premature abandonment of effortful preliminary practices.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Lack of foundation for recognizing effortless state.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR].

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [BINDU SUBSTANTIALISM]

MISREADING:
The bindu (thig le) is a physical substance or energetic particle that can be manipulated through technique.

WHY IT ARISES:
Descriptions use physical language ("hold," "reverse," "drop"). Modern subtle-body discourse conflates symbol with physiology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Treating thigle practices as bioenergetic manipulation rather than recognition of nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fixation on sensation and localized experience.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[REIFICATION ERROR] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] mistaken for ontological claim.

[15943-15953]
[PRACTICE ERROR] [POSTURAL LITERALISM]

MISREADING:
Specific sitting postures ('dug stangs) and gazes (gzigs stangs) mechanically produce realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
Prescriptive language suggests causality. Physical interventions offer tangible handles.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Obsession with correct posture over recognition of nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Body tension and fixation on form.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR] distracts from direct pointing.

[15954-15971]
[EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VERSE ONTOLOGIZATION]

MISREADING:
Poetic verse citations (mu tig phreng ba las) assert literal anatomical and metaphysical truths.

WHY IT ARISES:
Canonical authority of quotations. Beautiful language taken as descriptive fact.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
System-building around poetic images.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Elaborate symbolic interpretation disconnected from direct recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].
