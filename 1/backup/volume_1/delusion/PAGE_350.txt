[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [GENERATIVE POWER AGENCY]

MISREADING:
The "generative power" (skyed byed) actively transforms and creates male/female, lifespan, enjoyments, etc.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14264-14267: "skyed byed kyis pho mo gnyis su sgyur bar byed...dran pas tshe ring thung du sgyur bar byed" (generative power transforms into male and female...mindfulness transforms lifespan).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Attributing causal agency to conceptual designations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Trying to control the generative power.
Missing that all transformation is spontaneous wisdom-display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[AGENCY ATTRIBUTION ERROR]

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CONTRACTION/EXPANSION MECHANISM]

MISREADING:
Contraction (sdud pa) and expansion ('phel ba) are physical processes that mechanically affect form and power.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14268-14283: Detailed descriptions of how gathering and throwing affect body, power, mindfulness, etc.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing subtle processes as mechanical operations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to manipulate gathering and throwing.
Missing that they are natural movements of awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MECHANISTIC YOGA ERROR]

[NUMERICAL LITERALISM] [FOUR WHEEL ENUMERATION]

MISREADING:
The enumeration of four wheels is definitive and exhaustive, representing complete classification.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14284-14293: Multiple reasons why there are "four" wheels, based on elements, wisdoms, lamps, bodies.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing the number four as ontologically significant.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Searching for the "correct" classification.
Missing that enumeration is pedagogical device, not reality.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ENUMERATIVE OBSTRUCTION ERROR]
