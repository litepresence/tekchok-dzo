[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<The *klong nag po* (black space/expanse) division presents three modalities: enlightened activity (*mdzad pa*), compassion (*thugs rje*), and emanation (*sprul pa*). The first—activity as appearing manifoldly causeless (*shar snang sna tshogs rgyu med du shar*)—demonstrates *chos can* (subject) without reference (*mi ltos pa*). This is not nihilistic absence of causality but *chos nyid* transcending cause-effect logic. The play (*rol pa*) without affirmation/negation (*dgag sgrub med pa*) is spontaneous display, not deliberate action.>

[NONDUAL MANIFESTATION]

<The reasoning (*gtan tshigs*) of is/is-not extreme slumber (*yin min phyogs nyal*) establishes Dzogchen view free from limits (*mu mtha' dang bral ba*). Appearance-emptiness self-liberated from seeing (*mthong snang rang sar grol*) means *snang ba* (appearance) and *stong pa* (emptiness) are not sequential stages but simultaneous (*gcig char*) recognition. The non-dual wheel (*'khor lo gnyis med*) indicates *chos sku* (dharmakāya) and *longs sku* (saṃbhogakāya) as unified display.>

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<Compassion (*thugs rje*) as black space: appearing as primordial wisdom therefore knowing not dependent on other (*shes pa gzhan la mi ltos*), liberating as mind therefore not reciting on causes/conditions (*rgyu rkyen la bzla ba*). The non-dual abiding of appearing-liberating (*shar grol gnyis su med du gnas pa*) indicates *'bras bu ye nas grol ba* (result primordially liberated). This is *sems sde* framing—using *sems* (mind) as access point to *rig pa* (awareness).>

[EMANATION AS DISPLAY]

<Emanation (*sprul pa*) black space: the reasoning of harmonious appearance self-purified (*mthun snang rang dag pa'i gtan tshigs*) establishes Dzogchen as liberated from appearance-place. The phrase *ye shes gsum shar bas chos sku'i zhing khams su sprul* (three wisdoms arisen emanate into dharmakāya field) indicates *'od gsal* (clear light) display—not creation but self-manifest recognition. This transcends emanation theory (*sprul sku*) of lower vehicles.>
