[RISK: TEMPORAL REIFICATION]

<The six desire heavens (*'dod khams lha rigs drug*) enumeration with human-year calculations (Paranirmitavaśavartin, Nirmāṇarati, Tuṣita, Yāma, Trayastriṃśa, Four Great Kings) presents standard Buddhist cosmology. The temporal magnification formulas operate within conventional karmic-merit framework.>
