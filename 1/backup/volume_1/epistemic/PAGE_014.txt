[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPEECH TEACHING SUPPORTS]
[PROTECTIVE MANIFESTATION]

<Speech teaching period: vajra at Mount Malaya (*ri ma la ya*) at hand-vajra abode (*phyag rdo rje'i gnas*) where yakṣa kings render homage; letter in sky above Vajra-seat held by ḍākinīs; body not fixed to one place, circumambulating Jambudvīpa, creating special offering-fields for gods and humans. When teaching harm arises (*bsTan pa la gnod pa byung*), protection manifests: light from body, HŪṂ from face, fire from eyes—threefold protective mechanism of light (wisdom), sound (mantra), fire (transformation). This describes *chos skyong* (Dharma protector) as recognition-response, not external deity.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MIND TEACHING SUPPORTS]
[SAMĀDHI LOCATIONS]

<Mind teaching period: vajra abides in Vajra-seat's sky; letter in extremely wrathful sage's cave (*rab tu khros pa drang srong gi phug*)—Vajrapāṇi's wrathful manifestation; body in thirty-three gods' measureless palace (*sum cu rtsa gsum gyi lha rnams kyi gzhal med khang*), upper story of hand-vajra house. Such three emanations make Jambudvīpa surpass others—preeminence due to presence of these supports, not geographical superiority.>

[SOTERIOLOGICAL FUNCTION]

<Twelve emanation-bodies (*sprul sku bcu gnyis*) in twelve abode-types (*gnas ris bcu gnyis*) to purify beings' five aggregates (*phung po lnga dag par bya ba*). Self-nature of five perfections appearing twelve times (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga'i rang bzhin lan bcu gnyis su snang bar mdzad pa*)—systematic multiplication of pedagogical structure. This is *thabs* (skillful means) architecture, not historical biography.>

<Second: Abode world Sahā (*'jig rten mi mjed*), teacher Light Akṣobhya (*'od mi 'khrugs pa*), born from five-light egg (*'od lnga'i sgo nga*)—connecting to eastern direction Akṣobhya narrative, emphasizing luminous nature of emanation. Each emanation represents different teaching-manifestation based on capacities of beings (*gdul bya'i dbang*).>
