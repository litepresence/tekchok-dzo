[TEXTUAL LINEAGE]

<The *thig le rang gnad la phab pa* (drop established in self-essential-point) system's essence as singularly unique (*nyag gcig*), free from elaborations, without partiality—nature as non-multiple therefore dharmatā universally pervading beyond conceptual construction words; characteristics as introduction (*ngo sprod*) therefore confidence completely determined. This is *man ngag gi sde* (instruction series) pointing-out: direct introduction rather than philosophical argument. The division into *snyan rgyud* (oral/ear tantra) and *bshad rgyud* (explanation tantra) distinguishes transmission modes, not ontological categories.>

[FOURFOLD CYCLE CLASSIFICATION]

<The *bshad rgyud* (explanation tantra) fourfold cycle classification: outer (*phyi skor*)—afflictions without abandonment therefore five poisons (*dug lnga*) as path; inner (*nang skor*)—not material therefore signless dharmatā; secret (*gsang skor*)—introduction and realization obtained simultaneously therefore not dependent on hearing/contemplation/meditation (*thos bsam sgom gsum*); unsurpassed secret (*gsang ba bla na med pa'i skor*)—not depending on words therefore wisdom completely sufficient. These are progressive subtlety classifications for different capacities, not hierarchical truths.>

[SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]

<The three nature-characteristic correlations in secret cycles: breath-ceased and Buddhahood simultaneous therefore not dependent on effort/accomplishment or habituation-power; Buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneous therefore not dependent on accumulations/merit. This is *lhun grub* (spontaneous accomplishment) framing—recognition's natural qualities (*yon tan*) are not cultivated but self-manifest. The phrase *thabs dang shes rab* (means and wisdom) simultaneous indicates non-dual method-view, not sequential cultivation.>
