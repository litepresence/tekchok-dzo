[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-LIBERATION]
[CONVENTIONAL-ULTIMATE NON-DUALITY]

<Lines 10791-10794: Self-liberation explained: "conventional appearance power-to eye mantra-of power by-means-of horse ox-as appear liberation-to, effort without own-place place cause nature own dwell and child ball-like revert, space-to liberate appear time-from revert appear revert only-from, liberate liberation new-arise anything not bondage not established cause"—conventional appearance power, like eye mantra making horse-ox appear, liberation without effort; own-place placed, nature own dwells, reverts like child's ball; space liberates appearance, time reverts appearance, only reversion; liberation not newly arisen, bondage not established. Lines 10795-10800: "appearance conventional-of part-from spontaneous-accomplishment-to, empty ultimate-of part-from primordially-pure word by-means-of express only-from, those two substance separate not cause separately not change, essence one-to revert different separate ze being not be and, vow-possessor being cause fully-ordained being cause two not contradict like"—appearance conventional aspect from spontaneous accomplishment; empty ultimate aspect from primordially pure, expressed by word only; two not separate substance, not changing separately; essence one, reverts different, separate not being; like vow-possessor and fully-ordained not contradictory. This is *kun rdzob don dam dbyer med*—conventional and ultimate non-dual.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIX SPACES SYNTHESIS]
[SURPASSED BASIS CONCLUSION]

<Citation from Six Spaces (10801-10807): "essence itself-to primordially-pure cause, sentient beings samsara this not reasonable, non-recognition impurity primordially exhausted cause, teacher said bodhisattva great, nature spontaneous-by-means-of accomplish cause, that also not-cease play-as appear"—essence itself primordially pure; samsara not reasonable; non-recognition impurity primordially exhausted; teacher spoke thus to great bodhisattva; nature spontaneously accomplished; also not ceasing as play-appearance. Dialogue continues (10808-10820): bodhisattva asks—if nature spontaneous accomplishment, sentient beings self-liberate reasonable; if primordially spontaneous accomplished; teacher responds essence primordially pure, liberation as play. Bodhisattva asks again—if essence primordially pure, spontaneous accomplishment not needed; or if spontaneous accomplishment, primordially pure not become. Teacher responds: exist way, express word not, express sound word free, essence establish not, word harm free. Lines 10825-10829: "sentient beings self-grasp mind object-from, variety recollection thought not cease cause, word harm essence distinction not, ultimate conventional term cause"—sentient beings self-grasp mind object, variety recollection thought not ceasing, word does not harm essence, ultimate conventional term. This is *brda* (symbolic) teaching: words are fingers, not moon. Lines 10830-10831: "meaning second unsurpassed base particular explain-to three, common brief show"—meaning: second, unsurpassed basis particular explanation; three common brief show. Section concludes: seven bases general, supreme basis particular; two major divisions with three subsections each.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DEFINITIVE SYNTHESIS]
[COMPLETION OF BASIS SECTION]

<This page completes the extensive basis section (pages 255-263, ~35 pages in original Tibetan). Key insights:

1. **Self-liberation** (*rang grol*): Not transformation but recognition of primordial liberation
2. **Play-appearance** (*rol pa'i snang ba*): Manifestation without bondage or liberation as events
3. **Non-dual expression**: ka dag and lhun grub not contradictory like vow-possessor and fully-ordained monk—different aspects, same person
4. **Word and meaning**: Ultimate beyond word, conventional expressed by word; word does not harm essence

The dialogue format (bodhisattva questioning, teacher responding) is *mdo* (sutra) style establishing authority. The teacher's final response (10820-10829) emphasizes that words cannot establish essence; they are conventional designations that do not harm the ultimate. This is critical for translation: all nine layers are conventional (*kun rdzob*), pointing to ultimate (*don dam*) beyond expression.

The section structure: seven bases general explanation → refutation of seven extreme views → synthesis of ka dag/lhun grub non-duality → conclusion with self-liberation. This is classical Indian *śāstra* format: presentation (*uddeśa*), refutation (*parīkṣā*), synthesis (*saṃgati*). Risk: Taking any single view (ka dag OR lhun grub) as exclusive; actual meaning is non-dual completion.>

[STRUCTURAL SUMMARY]
[BASIS SECTION ARCHITECTURE]

<Section completed: Lines 10472-10831 (~360 lines, ~10% of Volume 1). Structure:
1. **Seven bases general** (255-256): gzhi bdun framework
2. **Refutation** (256-261): seven positions refuted via *thal 'gyur*
3. **Synthesis** (262-263): ka dag/lhun grub non-duality
4. **Conclusion** (263): self-liberation, unsurpassed basis

Doctrinal sources: *Klong drug pa*, *Rang shar*, *Mu tig phreng ba*. Method: *dbu ma* (Madhyamaka) style refutation clearing conceptual fixation so *rig pa* recognition can occur. Next section: unsurpassed basis particular explanation (*bla na med pa'i gzhi bye brag*).>
