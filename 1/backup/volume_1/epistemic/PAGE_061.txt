[DZOGCHEN VIEW – HETERODOX CONDUCT REFUTATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section continues the systematic refutation of non-Buddhist practices, focusing on the heterodox conduct (mu stegs spyod pa) that accompanies wrong views. Three primary errors are identified: attachment to views (lta la zhen pa), supremacy of black mantras (nag gsag gtsor byed), and reliance on divination (mo pra gtsor byed). These represent approaches that mistake means for ends, rituals for liberation.

The epistemic framework here distinguishes between authentic Buddhist soteriology and magical-ritual approaches that seek worldly benefits rather than liberation. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that all such practices, while they may produce temporary results, fail to address the root of samsara—ignorance of the natural state. From the [ULTIMATE TRUTH] perspective, even Buddhist rituals are empty, yet they function as skillful means when oriented toward recognition.

View-attachment (lta la zhen pa) represents the error of grasping at philosophical positions as ultimate truths. Whether eternalist or nihilist, such attachment prevents the open recognition of rig pa, which transcends all views. Dzogchen teaches that views are like fingers pointing at the moon—necessary for direction, but not to be confused with the moon itself.

Black mantra supremacy refers to the use of mantras and magical practices for harmful or worldly purposes, divorced from the altruistic motivation of bodhicitta. The [PROVISIONAL MEANING] here acknowledges that such practices exist and may be effective within the realm of conventional causality, but they cannot lead to liberation. The [DEFINITIVE MEANING] recognizes that all phenomena are the display of rig pa, and using this display for harmful purposes only deepens delusion.

Divination and prophecy (mo pra) represent reliance on external signs rather than direct recognition. While such methods may have limited validity within conventional reality, they cannot reveal the ultimate nature of mind. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] holds that the future is not fixed but arises from present causes and conditions, and true knowledge comes from recognizing the nature of mind, not from divining external events.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] applies here as the text clearly distinguishes authentic from inauthentic practice. The [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] framework acknowledges that beings have different capacities and may need gradual approaches, yet the ultimate goal remains the direct recognition of rig pa beyond all ritual and philosophy.

The section functions pedagogically as [UPAYA], warning practitioners against distractions that may appear spiritual but lead away from liberation. The epistemic stance maintains that while conventional practices have their place, they must be oriented toward the [NGES DON] definitive meaning—the recognition of primordial purity and spontaneous perfection.
