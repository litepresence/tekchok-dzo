[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMĀDHI ACTIVITIES]
[NON-DOING AS DOING]

<Additional samādhi names: mudra-overwhelming (*phyag rgya zil gyis gnon pa*), great-blaze equality (*'bar chen mnyam pa*), dharmatā all-encompassing (*chos nyid sna tshogs pa*), naturally-arising adornment play (*rnam par bkod pa rang snang rol pa*)—"these are not activity of agent-object" (*don byed byed kyi mdzad pa ma yin gyi*) but called activity because arising as essence of qualities and skillfulness (*yon tan gyi ngo bo dang rtsal du shar ba'i phyir*). This is crucial: enlightened activity is not deliberate action but natural display of recognition.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAṂBHOGAKĀYA PURE LAND]
[SPONTANEOUS ARCHITECTURE]

<Saṃbhogakāya self-arisen (*rang byon*) from former appearance and compassion's uninterrupted skill (*sngar gyi snang ba dang thugs rje'i 'char tshul ma 'gags pa'i rtsal*)—in pure densely-arranged places (*gnas rnam dag stug po bkod par*), teacher Vairocana Great Ocean's equal-samādhi gesture (*mnyam gzhag gi phyag mthil*) produces lotus stems (*padma'i sdong po*) with twenty-five stacked fields (*zhing khams nyi shu rtsa lnga re brtsegs mar*) like water-moon colors and forms (*chu zla 'dra ba*), each level infinite and vast (*yas man du rgya theb*), mutual offering-feast arrangements (*phan tshun za 'og gi gur khyim*), countless five-family Buddha forms. This is *longs sku* as recognition-display, not external paradise.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-ARISEN TEACHING]
[DHARMATĀ AS SOURCE]

<In Saṃbhogakāya field, "actual teaching, self-arisen letters, no author" (*bstan pa dngos gsung rang byung gi yi ge sus kyang byas pa med pa*)—all teachings' sons appearing together (*bstan pa thams cad kyi bu dang lhan cig snang ba*). "Unchanging time of Dharmatā" (*chos nyid la 'gyur ba med pa'i dus*) indicates *chos nyid* as atemporal ground. Thirty-six activities self-radiating (*rang shar ba*) from inexhaustible ornament wheel of body, speech, mind (*sku gsung thugs mi zad pa rgyan gyi 'khor lo*)—body's outer four activities purifying obscurations with natureless appearance (*sku snang la rang bzhin med pas sgrib dang bcas dag par mdzad*).>
