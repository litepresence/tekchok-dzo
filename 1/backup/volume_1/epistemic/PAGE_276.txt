[EIGHT MANIFEST-MAKING METHODS]

<Lines 11469-11504: Continuation of eight methods: "That-of appear-method non-cease-by-means-of, Compassion like-of appear-method from, Beings all-of protect-place, Appear self-clear cease-non-existent from, Light five-of appear-make method as appear, Knowledge-of appear-aspect non-cease-by-means-of, Primordial-wisdom pure-of door self-in, Appear cease-non-existent path-like arise, Self-appear body all complete-end for, Dharmas all-of body like appear, Say-of nature one is-by-means-of, Two-in non-existent like also arise, That self own-place abide non-existent-by-means-of, Extreme liberate great-of appear in as-for"—by means of non-ceasing appear-method; from compassion-like appear-method; all beings' protection place; from self-clear appearing, cease-non-existent; as appear-making method of five lights appearing; by means of non-ceasing knowledge appear-aspect; in primordial wisdom pure door; arising like path, appear cease-non-existent; for completion-end of all self-appearing bodies; appearing like body of all dharmas; by means of nature being one; arising like non-existent in two; by means of non-existent self-own-place abiding; as for appearance in great extreme liberation. **Eight manifest-making methods** (*snang byed thabs brgyad*):
1. Non-ceasing appearance method
2. Compassion-like appearance method
3. Self-clear appearing from non-ceasing
4. Five lights appear-making
5. Knowledge non-ceasing aspect
6. Primordial wisdom pure door
7. Path-like arise cease-non-existent
8. Nature one, two non-existent

These methods manifest without truly existing—*lhun grub* as dynamic display.>
