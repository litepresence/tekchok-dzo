[RISK: TEMPORAL REIFICATION]

<The degeneration narrative continuation—beings multiplying, lifespan gradually diminishing, bodily radiance fading, merit declining—presents standard Buddhist eschatology. Operating within temporal framework of karmic maturation through successive world-ages. Risk: Misreading as historical prediction rather than recognition of dependent origination patterns.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<The progressive loss of spontaneous blessings (*lhun grub kyi byin rlabs*) and transition to coarse food, sexual differentiation, and womb birth operates at sems-side pedagogical level. This narrative of adventitious obscuration prepares practitioners for definitive recognition that all such transformations are appearances within primordially pure ground.>
