**Status:** INTERMEDIATE DRAFT - 85% COMPLETE (V1), 46% COMPLETE (V2)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08

## Layer Specifications
- **Purpose:** lta ba'i rim pa (View Stratification) - Classify epistemic viewpoint of each passage
- **Content:** View tags, risk warnings, pedagogical context
- **Character:** Hermeneutic analyst - clinical, diagnostic, preventive
- **Average Length:** ~44 lines per page (target: 35-60 lines)
- **Files:** 479 pages (Volume 1), 415 pages (Volume 2)

## Completion Status
- **Volume 1:** 84.8% Complete (406/479 pages complete, 73 stubs)
- **Volume 2:** 46.3% Complete (192/415 pages complete, 223 stubs)

## Quality Metrics
- [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SUBTOPIC] tags for definitive meaning passages
- [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] tags for gradualist frameworks
- [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] tags for method-based passages
- [RISK: REIFICATION/Nihilism/etc.] warnings where applicable
- Line-range coverage matching actual Tibetan content
- 35-60 lines per page for substantive analysis

## Recent Repairs (2026-02-07/08)
- Volume 1, Pages 51-150: Batch repair completed (100 pages)
- Expanded from 5-7 line stubs to 35-50 line analyses
- Full view-stratification tagging implemented
- Proper Dzogchen terminology integrated

## Standardized Tags in Use
- [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SUBTOPIC]
- [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
- [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
- [RISK: REIFICATION]
- [RISK: NIHILISM]
- [RISK: FAMILIES-REIFICATION]
- [RISK: PRACTICE ABANDONMENT]
- [RISK: CONVENTIONALIZING THE TRANSCENDENT]

## Remaining Work
- **Volume 1:** 73 pages need expansion from stubs
- **Volume 2:** 223 pages need full development (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Volume 2 has significant gaps requiring systematic repair sweep

## Current State Analysis
Volume 1:
- Strong coverage in pages 1-150 after recent repairs
- Pages 200-479 have sporadic gaps
- Average quality high where complete

Volume 2:
- Majority of pages are stubs (5-15 lines)
- Early pages (1-50) partially covered
- Pages 100+ largely undeveloped

## Next Steps
1. Complete Volume 1 stub repairs (73 pages)
2. Systematic Volume 2 repair sweep (223 pages)
3. Ensure all line ranges match actual Tibetan content
4. Standardize tagging across all pages

## Notes
- Do not restate the teaching - label its epistemic altitude
- Identify view being employed, classify claim-type, flag confusion risks
- Note transitions where Longchenpa shifts view mid-passage
- Diagnostic and preventive, not corrective
