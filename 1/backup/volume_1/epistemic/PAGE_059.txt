[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WRONG VEHICLES REFUTATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: VIEW ASSERTION]

This section introduces the systematic refutation of non-Buddhist philosophical systems (mu stegs pa), establishing the boundaries of authentic Buddhist teaching through the identification and analysis of wrong views (log par lta ba). The 360 views of the worldly aggregates ('jig tshogs) are categorized under the two extremes of eternalism (rtag pa) and nihilism (chad pa), which the Middle Way and Dzogchen both transcend.

The epistemic framework here uses [DZOGCHEN VIEW] vs [WRONG VIEW] to distinguish authentic dharma from philosophical error. Eternalism reifies the self or ultimate reality as permanent, while nihilism denies continuity, causation, and liberation. Both extremes obscure the middle way of dependent origination, which Dzogchen embodies in the recognition of the natural state.

The Samkhya (grangs can pa) system is presented as the paradigmatic eternalist view, positing a permanent self (purusha) that becomes entangled with matter (prakriti) through the three qualities (gunas: sattva, rajas, tamas). This self is characterized as white, oily, round, indestructible, and invisible—located in the heart, varying in size according to the being's spiritual development. The [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] lies in reifying consciousness as a permanent entity separate from its objects.

From the [ULTIMATE TRUTH] perspective, this view fails to recognize the empty nature of all phenomena, including the self. Dzogchen's rig pa is not a permanent self but the nature of mind beyond all extremes of existence and non-existence. The [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] critique notes that even conventionally, the Samkhya system cannot account for the relationship between the inactive purusha and the active prakriti.

The viewpoint tag [DRANG DON] applies here in the sense that refuting wrong views serves a pedagogical function, clearing away misconceptions to prepare for correct understanding. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] holds that all such philosophical positions are ultimately mental constructs (rnam rtog), while rig pa is beyond all construction.

The section demonstrates the Dzogchen hermeneutic principle that authentic dharma must avoid both extremes—neither affirming an eternal self nor denying dependent origination. The middle way of dependent origination (rten 'brel dbu ma'i lam) is the philosophical foundation upon which Dzogchen builds its view of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous perfection (lhun grub).

The epistemic stance maintains that while philosophical analysis is [PROVISIONAL MEANING], it serves the crucial function of establishing correct view. Without clearing away wrong views, the practitioner cannot recognize the natural state. Thus polemics, while seemingly negative, function as [UPAYA] skillful means to guide beings toward authentic recognition.
