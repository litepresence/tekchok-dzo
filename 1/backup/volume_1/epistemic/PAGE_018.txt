[DZOGCHEN VIEW – UNITIVE SYNTHESIS]
[SINGLE VAJRADHARA NATURE]

<Twelve emanations synthesized as "activity of Vajradhara qualities-complete self-nature" (*rdo rje 'chang yon tan rdzogs pa'i bdag nyid gcig gi mdzad pa*)—called "succession transmitted by Victor's intention" (*rgyal ba dgongs pas brgyud pa'i rim pa*). Vajradhara appearing at different times (*dus tha dad par byon pa*) is merely appearance—essentially (*ngo bo*) all are one in Vajradhara's self-nature. This establishes *gcig* (oneness) as single-nature recognition, not monotheistic unity. Later Fortunate Eon guides (*bskal bzang gi 'dren pa*) though emanations different, essence is Vajradhara's nature alone (*ngo bo rdo rje 'chang 'di kho na'i rang bzhin du gcig pa*).>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE TRANSMISSIONS]
[LINEAGE TOPOLOGY]

<Three modes of transmission distinguished: (1) Victor's intention succession (*rgyal ba dgongs pa'i brgyud pa*)—ultimate lineage; (2) Vidyādhara sign-transmission (*rigs 'dzin brdas brgyud pa*)—symbolic/esoteric; (3) Person ear-transmission (*gang zag snyan khung du brgyud pa*)—human oral. Correspond to *brda brgyud* (sign), *snyan brgyud* (aural), *gdam ngag brgyud* (instruction) lineages in Nyingma. Direct to individual biographies (*so so'i rnam thar*) and Great Chronicles (*lo rgyus chen mo*) for details. This is transmission-ontology, not historical genealogy.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SECOND CHAPTER OPENING]
[ABODE TOPOLOGY]

<Transition to second major section: explaining definite abode (*gnas nges pa*) where teacher tames. First sub-topic: fields (*zhing khams*) and container-contained (*snod bcud*) sequence. Cosmology: from Vajradhara quality-complete bodhi (*yon tan rdzogs pa'i rang bzhin*), abiding as Saṃbhogakāya from Dharmakāya, five-family kāya manifests immeasurable fields. Center ornamented by Vairocana (*dbus ma rnam par snang mdzad kyis brgyan pa*). Sahā world (*mi mjed 'di*) at thirteenth level of twenty-five stacked appearances upon jewel lotus. "Upper-lower and directions-intervals" (*steng 'og dang phyogs mtshams*) indicates three-dimensional maṇḍala architecture—not physical cosmography but recognition-topology.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THALGYUR QUOTATION]
[THIRTEEN FIELDS]

<Extensive quotation from *sGra thal 'gyur* (Sound Unobstructed/Thalgyur) tantra describing thirteen field-types (*zhing khams rnam pa bcu gsum*) arrayed around Sahā: (1) Thal-ba-dbyangs—below this world, immeasurable; (2) Thal-ba-'dzin—six worlds below, wheel-shaped; (3) Thal-ba-skyob—three to right, ornamented by mothers/nurses; (4) Thal-ba-brdal—six worlds above, lotus-blooming; (5) Thal-ba'i be-con—above nineteen worlds, skull-garland; (6) Thal-ba'i rgyun—northeast interval, caitya-shaped; (7) Thal-ba rgyas—at top twenty-one, extremely pervading. "Thal" (*thal*) relates to *thal 'gyur*—unobstructed, penetrating, direct. Each field: name, location relative to Sahā, shape, teaching function.>
