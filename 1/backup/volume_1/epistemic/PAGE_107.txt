[HIDDEN REVELATION]

<The *gab pa mngon phyung* (hidden revealed) category presents two modalities: (1) one hidden, two revealed, and (2) two hidden, one revealed. First modality: view-conduct revealed, meditation hidden—its essence is *zung 'jug* (union) without beginning/end therefore samsara/nirvana's beginning/end severed. This is Dzogchen's *thog mtha' chod* (cutting beginning/end)—not temporal but atemporal recognition. Nature as non-differentiated two therefore *thig le* (sphere/drop) without outer/inner; characteristics without reference therefore causeless zang-thal (direct/penetrating).>

[PEDAGOGICAL REVEALING]

<Second modality variations: conduct revealed—abiding empty, emptiness pure; view hidden—non-grasping cognition appears directionless, objectless awareness liberated in non-thought. These are pedagogical revealing (*mngon du phyung*) patterns, not ontological truths. The *bshad pa rang gsal* (explanation self-clear) category cuts word-grasping continuum (*tshig zhen rgyun chad*), not establishing philosophical positions (*grub mtha' mi gnas*) but superior establishment (*grub pa khyad par 'phags pa*). This is *man ngag gi sde* method: using explanation to undermine explanation.>
