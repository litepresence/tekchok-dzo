[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The *klong dmar po* (red space/expanse) category presents the sixfold essential-point classification (*gnad drug*). The threefold division into mind (*sems*), wisdom (*ye shes*), and space (*klong*) maps onto the recognition topology: mind as conception-free (*rnam rtog med pa*), wisdom as obstacle-free (*gegs med pa*), space as changing-free (*'gyur med pa*). The essence of space as *chos nyid rang grol* (dharmatā self-liberated) indicates *ye nas grol* (primordially liberated) nature—not achieved but recognized.>

<The mind-space (*sems kyi klong*) threefold division: (1) undistracted essential-point (*yengs med kyi gnad*), (2) essential-point of mind-emptiness beyond observation (*sems nyid stong pa ltos med kyi gnad*), (3) essential-point of thought-free essence (*blo bral ngo bo'i gnad*). Each *gnad* (essential point) is not a technique to apply but a recognition to rest in. The *sems sde* framework uses progressive subtlety to undermine fixation on progressively subtler objects.>

[NONDUAL WISDOM]

<Wisdom-space (*ye shes kyi klong*) threefold: (1) wisdom-emptiness obstacle-free (*ye shes stong pa gegs med kyi gnad*), (2) play-emptiness without interruption (*rol pa stong pa bar chad med pa'i gnad*), (3) indemonstrable essential-point (*bstan du med pa'i gnad*). The phrase *chos nyid 'gyur med gegs su med pa* (dharmatā unchanging obstacle-free) indicates *ye shes* as *rig pa*'s knowing quality—not separate from emptiness but its luminous clarity.>

[EXPANSE AS SUCHNESS]

<Space-space (*klong gi klong*) threefold: (1) essence as uncompounded (*ngo bo 'dus ma byas pa'i gnad*), (2) nature as birthless (*rang bzhin skye med kyi gnad*), (3) characteristics as unceasing play (*mtshan nyid 'gag med rol pa'i gnad*). This completes the *gnad drug* (six essential points) structure. The threefold pattern—essence (*ngo bo*), nature (*rang bzhin*), characteristics (*mtshan nyid*)—mirrors *sku gsum* (three bodies) topology applied to recognition itself.>
