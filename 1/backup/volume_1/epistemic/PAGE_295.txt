<Appearance change and not-change. Lines 12257-12271: "Appear manner many with together, Appear manner-by-means-of pervade, That also spontaneous-jewel locket-by-means-of nature-by-means-of appearance not-cease from, Basis not-change although appear change and, Object many-by-means-of after follow, All to realize, Dharmakaya-by-means-of appearance not-change although, Delusion-by-means-of appearance to change change like arise, Vajrasattva to delusion not-possess although, Sentient-being to delusion-by-means-of manner show, End self-by-means-of appearance self condition-by-means-of basis to return, Two-as not-possess-by-means-of appearance self arise-as not-know and, Delusion to master-as grasp-by-means-of master condition, Self awareness-by-means-of result self arise-as not-know, Cause self dependent-as grasp-by-means-of cause condition"—with together many appear manner; pervade by means of appear manner; from not ceasing appearance by means of nature by means of spontaneous-jewel locket also that; and change appear although basis not change; follow after by means of many object; realize to all; although not change appearance by means of dharmakāya; arise like change change to appearance by means of delusion; although not possess delusion to Vajrasattva; show manner by means of delusion to sentient being; return to basis by means of condition self appearance by means of self end; and not know as arise self appearance by means of not possess as two; master condition by means of grasp as master to delusion; not know as arise self result by means of awareness self; cause condition by means of grasp as dependent self cause. **Paradox**: basis not change but appearance changes; dharmakāya not change but delusion changes. Vajrasattva has no delusion yet shows delusion manner to sentient beings. **Three conditions**:
1. Master condition: grasping delusion as master
2. Vajra condition: not knowing awareness result
3. Cause condition: grasping self as dependent cause

Return to basis through self-appearance condition.>
