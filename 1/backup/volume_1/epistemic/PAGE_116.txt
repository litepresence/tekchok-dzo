[POINTING-OUT INSTRUCTIONS]

<The concluding verses on indicating tantra: "Body and speech relaxed, separated from suffering; awareness relaxed, five bodies arise." This is *man ngag* (instruction) poetry—not descriptive metaphysics but pointing-out (*ngo sprod*). The five bodies (*sku lnga*) arising from awareness relaxed indicates spontaneous display, not fabricated achievement. The phrase *rang gi rgyud la ma bskyed rdzogs* (in one's own tantra without development-completion) indicates recognition transcends staged practice.>

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[NATURE TANTRA AS CONTINUITY]

<Nature tantra (*rang bzhin gyi rgyud*): ground-path-result meaning (*gzh lam 'bras bu'i don*). The etymology as "continuous (*rgyud*) because determined as pervading all and nature producing buddhahood" indicates tantric view of *rgyud* as transformative continuity. The threefold division—ground, essence, potency nature tantras—maps Dzogchen structure onto tantric terminology: ground nature tantra as primordial pure (*ka dag*) awareness essence-nature-compassion (*ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje*), essence nature tantra as wisdom-threefold-essence, potency nature tantra as ripened result of practice. This is hermeneutical translation between systems, not ontological hierarchy.>

[ESSENCE NATURE AS DISPLAY]

<Essence nature tantra (*snying po rang bzhin gyi rgyud*): wisdom-threefold-essence arising from heart in essence-mode. The four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) arising from ground-nature-tantra's power-basis appearance-eye indicates *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) framework—spontaneous luminosity, not fabricated visualization. The path-four-appearances (*lam snang ba bzhi*) actually seen (*dngos su mthong*) indicates *thod rgal*'s visionary progression as direct perception, not meditation-generated experiences.>
