[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TRANSITION TO GROUND PATH FRUITION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON PREPARATION]

This section marks the transition from the detailed exposition of the nine vehicles to the ground-path-fruition (gzhi lam 'bras bu) framework that will organize the remaining presentation. From the Dzogchen perspective, this threefold structure provides the essential framework for understanding how the view is realized through practice to manifest as the result.

The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in a synthetic structure. The ground (gzhi) represents the basis of purification—primordial purity itself. The path (lam) represents the process of purification—the methods that reveal this purity. The fruition ('bras bu) represents the result of purification—the recognition of what was always present. This structure applies to all vehicles but is most fully realized in Atiyoga.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that ultimately, ground, path, and fruition are inseparable. The ground is not separate from the path; the path does not lead to a different fruition; the fruition is not other than the ground. This non-separation is the distinctive Dzogchen view. Yet conventionally, the threefold structure provides a necessary pedagogical framework.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] operates in the ground-path-fruition structure as the recognition that while conventionally we speak of basis, process, and result, ultimately there is nothing to purify, no one to purify, and no purification to perform. All three are conceptual impositions on the natural state.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the ground-path-fruition as the universal structure of Buddhist practice. Whether in Sravaka, Mahayana, or Vajrayana, this structure applies—the ground is the nature of mind, the path is the methods that reveal it, the fruition is the recognition of this nature. The differences between vehicles lie in how they understand and work with this structure.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component is implicit in the framework itself—the ground is recognized through view, the path is traversed through meditation, the fruition is stabilized through conduct. This applies to all vehicles, though the specifics vary dramatically.

The section prepares for detailed exposition of each of the three aspects. The ground will be analyzed in terms of primordial purity, spontaneous presence, and compassionate energy. The path will be analyzed in terms of view, meditation, and conduct. The fruition will be analyzed in terms of dissolution of obscurations, manifestation of qualities, and benefit for beings.

The epistemic stance maintains that the ground-path-fruition structure is a conventional teaching device that points to the ultimate reality beyond structure. It is not to be reified but used as a pointer to the natural state that transcends all frameworks.

The section thus establishes the hermeneutical key for the remaining presentation, showing how the nine vehicles can be understood through the lens of ground, path, and fruition, with Dzogchen providing the most direct recognition of their inseparability.
