[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[METHOD TANTRA AS SKILLFUL MEANS]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Method tantra (*thabs kyi rgyud*) as part of ground tantra: the meaning itself as indicated-ground. The phrase *gzhir rig pa la ma brten pa'i sangs rgyas sems can gang yang med* (no buddhas/beings not relying on ground-awareness) establishes *rig pa* as universal ground. The need for guru's instruction (*bla ma'i man ngag*) to indicate demonstrates tantric framework: even universal ground requires pointing-out. Liberation upon realization (*rtogs nas grol ba*) as result (*'bras bu*) indicates tantric causal logic, not Dzogchen's primordial liberation.>

[ESSENCE/FLOWER/POTENCY TANTRAS]
[PEDAGOGICAL DISTINCTION]

<Essence tantra (*snying po'i rgyud*) as *rig pa*; flower tantra (*me tog gi rgyud*) as four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) seen/recognized; potency tantra (*bcud kyi rgyud*) as practice-ripened result. These are pedagogical entry points, not separate ontological categories. The phrase *lam du 'phang byed* (shooting/throwing as path) indicates tantric gradualism; citations from various tantras establish textual authority for this framework. *Dbyings rig 'du 'bral med pa'i bcud* (potency of space-awareness without meeting/parting) bridges to Dzogchen view.>
