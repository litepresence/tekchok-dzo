[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MUKTĪKĀ CITATION]
[ELEMENTAL FORMATION]

<Citation from *Muktīkā-phreng-ba'i-rgyud* (Pearl Garland Tantra): Sky wind supports, water by 110,000 hundred-thousands, round coiled arisen like milk-cream, earth 120 hundred-thousands. Wind's number hundred-thousand—gathering, contracting, pulling, lifting. Water's pervading, holding, ripening. Earth's rubbing subtle and coarse. Churned down became like—among mountains, mountain king Meru with four terraces, great peaks, play-lakes, seven mountains, continents and surroundings arisen, three-thousand world-systems. Desire, form, formless support three realms. Non-existing anything without and consciousness slight without's formless realm arisen from that. Pure abodes etc. embodied, upper from below drops manner, Akanistha etc. desire, gods and asuras and humans, high from that three abodes, animals, pretas, hells, those beings four births.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COSMIC DEGENERATION]
[KALPA COSMOLOGY]

<Fortunate eon first humans—form and beauty marks-characteristics possessing, own-light radiance pervading body, desire-food etc. merit food, beings' life 80,000, male and female faculties without. Then from delusion's two causes, desire etc. kleśas gradually coarse became, faculties etc. gates that, merit exhausted reason light etc. decrease. Then sequence earth oil and rice etc. food eat. This describes Buddhist *kalpa* cosmology—progressive degeneration of lifespan and conditions from golden age to present. Not historical geology but recognition-context: understanding samsara's nature as impermanent (*mi rtag pa*) and unsatisfactory (*sdug bsngal*).>

[RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY]
<Pages 1-20 establish foundational *gzhi* (ground), *lam* (path), and *'bras bu* (result) topology of Dzogchen view. Primary risks: (1) Reifying Samantabhadra/Vajradhara as temporal beings who achieved enlightenment; (2) Literalizing pure land descriptions as physical cosmography; (3) Treating twelve emanations as historical biography; (4) Misreading five perfections/three kāyas as ontological categories rather than recognition-descriptors; (5) Confusing emanation doctrine with theistic creation theology. Antidote: All descriptions point to *rig pa* (awareness) recognizing itself—*rang snang* (self-appearance) as *chos nyid* (dharmatā).>
