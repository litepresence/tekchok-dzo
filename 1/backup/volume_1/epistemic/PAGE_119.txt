[TANTRIC CITATIONS AS AUTHORITY]

<Extensive citations from *Mu tig phreng ba*, *Sangs rgyas kun gyi bcud bsdus*, *Brtson pa don ldan gyi rgyud*, *Rdo rje nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud*, *Gser 'od dam pa* establish tantric textual lineage. The citations emphasize: (1) all buddhas' potency condensed, (2) dharmatā direct path as all teachings' essence, (3) ground/essence/flower as nature tantra, (4) reliance on ground/nature/method for easy Buddhahood. These are authoritative grounding (*lung*) for the taxonomy, not philosophical arguments. The unified meaning (*don ngo bo gcig*) beneath five names demonstrates hermeneutical principle: different terms, single recognition.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[NATURE TANTRA AS SINGLE ESSENCE]

<Citation from *Mu tig phreng ba*: ground as essence-nature-compassion, pervading all, three wisdoms' nature, primordially pure, without meeting/parting, uniquely singular, great secret of buddhas. This describes *gzhi* (ground) as Dzogchen view—primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) unified. The phrase *ma bskyed rdzogs pas snying po che* (great essence of unfabricated completion) indicates *dzogchen* proper: beyond *bskyed rdzogs* (development/completion), not within tantric staged framework.>
