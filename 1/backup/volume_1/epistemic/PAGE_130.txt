[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND ACTION AND AGENT]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: NON-DUAL CONDUCT]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the Dzogchen view that transcends the duality of action and agent, practice and practitioner. From the Dzogchen perspective, the natural state is beyond all doing—neither acting nor refraining from action, neither practicing nor not practicing.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding conduct beyond action. Unlike conventional practice where a practitioner performs actions to achieve results, Dzogchen recognizes that there is no practitioner separate from the natural state and no action separate from spontaneous presence.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the division into action and agent is a conceptual imputation. In the natural state, there is simply the spontaneous display of awareness. This display is not someone's action; it is the natural expression of primordial purity.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is crucial here. Conventionally, we speak of practitioners, practices, and results. Ultimately, there is only the natural state expressing itself in all its variety, with no one doing anything.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes that in the natural state, all activity is spontaneous (lhun grub), not performed by an agent. The distinction between meditation and post-meditation dissolves; all activity is the display of awareness.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to transcend the duality of action and agent. Instead of thinking "I am meditating," simply rest in the natural state. Instead of thinking "I am practicing," allow all activity to be the spontaneous expression of awareness.

The section discusses the relationship between this view and conventional practice. While beginners need the structure of practice and practitioner, advanced recognition transcends these categories. Yet this transcendence does not abandon conventional practice—it recognizes its ultimate nature.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for this view, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While conventional frameworks are necessary for pedagogy, the ultimate reality is beyond action and agent.

The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of conduct as the spontaneous expression of the natural state—beyond the duality of action and agent, practice and practitioner, effort and achievement.
