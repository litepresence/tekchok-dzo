[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LINEAGE AND TRANSMISSION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: AUTHENTICITY FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]

This section presents the importance of lineage (brgyud pa) and transmission (lung) in Dzogchen as the means by which the recognition of the natural state is passed from master to disciple. From the Dzogchen perspective, while the nature of mind cannot be transmitted like an object, the conditions for its recognition are passed through authentic lineage.

The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. Provisionally, the lineage is a historical succession of masters who have held and transmitted the teaching. Ultimately, the lineage is the continuity of recognition itself, transcending historical time and individual persons.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the lineage is not merely institutional but the living expression of the teaching. When a master gives direct introduction, the lineage is present. When a disciple recognizes the natural state, the lineage continues. It is the living transmission of recognition.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in lineage is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of historical masters and transmissions, ultimately the lineage is the natural state itself, recognizing itself through apparently separate individuals.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes that authentic Dzogchen requires connection to an authentic lineage. This is not institutional rigidity but recognition that the pointing-out instructions must come from one who has recognized, who received from one who recognized, back to the Buddha Samantabhadra.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to connect with lineage. Through devotion to the master and confidence in the teaching, the disciple opens to the transmission. The lineage is not received from outside but recognized as one's own nature.

The section discusses the relationship between lineage and direct recognition. While the lineage provides the context and method, recognition itself is direct and immediate. The lineage is the doorway; recognition is entering the room.

The epistemic stance maintains that while lineage is [PROVISIONAL MEANING] in its historical form, it conveys [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in the recognition it facilitates. The form is provisional; the recognition is definitive.

The section thus establishes lineage as the living transmission of Dzogchen—the unbroken continuity of recognition from master to disciple that makes the direct introduction possible.
