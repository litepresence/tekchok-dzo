[ASURA CLASSIFICATION & HUMAN ORIGIN]

<Completion of desire realm classification. Line 1293: "life thirty three like"—asura lifespans parallel Thirty-three gods. Line 1294: "then demon class also god class to include from titan class four only"—demon (*bdud*) class included in god class; titan (*lha min*, asura) class four only. Consolidation of previous four asura types into four only. Line 1295: "then human to expand is"—transition to human realm origination. This is *mi 'jig rten* (human world) cosmogony. The four asura races integrated with god-class demonstrates hierarchical permeability—non-gods (*lha min*) are "almost gods," demigods with jealousy.>

[HUMAN ORIGINATION FROM LIGHT BEINGS]

<Lines 1296-1298: "first Jambu continent merit excellent ground this to light clear from god son two lotus to miraculous birth expand explain, that also four great king up-to beings form that below to light clear from god son two Jambu continent this to fall is sun greatly illuminate and moon stainless"—first, Jambudvīpa (*'dzam bu'i gling*, Rose-Apple Continent), merit-excellent ground. From light clear (*'od gsal*) god sons two, lotus (*padma*) miraculous birth (*rdzus skyes*). This is first human origin: Sun Greatly Illuminating (*nyi ma rab tu snang byed*) and Moon Stainless (*zla ba dri med*) fall from clear light. They are *'od kyi skye gnas* (light beings) descending to material realm. Lines 1299-1307: "then appearance all greatly beautiful light lotus measure without to, those two mind greatly move from, space seed part manifest become condition to arise by-means-of, miraculous birth god son some expand, those also each-other see when joy and light appearance greatly clear miracle by-means-of activity is, beings those go when also sky to go, sit when also sky to sit, food as meditation what joy bliss to dwell, body to light rays group measure without extend and go to wish only by-means-of where think that to go"—appearance all greatly beautiful, light lotus measureless. Those two minds greatly moved; space seed (*dbyings kyi sa bon*) part manifest as condition; miraculous birth god sons expand. Seeing each other: joy, light appearance, clear miracle activity. Going: sky-going; sitting: sky-sitting; food: meditation; dwelling in joy/bliss. Body light rays measureless; extending where thought goes—*'dod 'jo* (wish-fulfillment). Lines 1308-1312: "life year also measure without last, afflictions manifest move what also not exist, tantra some from joy possess from expand explain, some from four great king from expand explain, intention is first chief those two light clear from fall is"—life measureless years; no afflictions (*nyon mongs*) manifest. Some tantras say from Joy Possessors (*dga' ldan*) expanded; some say from Four Great Kings. Intention: first, those two chiefs fell from clear light. This is *rigs pas skyes pa* (caste-born) origin myth—first humans divine descent, establishing human potential for enlightenment.>

[RISK: CREATIONISM & CASTEISM]

<The "fall from light" narrative presents two risks:

**1. Creationism**: Sun and Moon as first humans can be read as literal cosmic origin story. Actual meaning: *'od gsal* (clear light) = mind's primordial nature; "fall" = condensation into material embodiment. Not historical event but phenomenological description of consciousness individuating.

**2. Casteism**: Divine origin establishing human superiority over animals/pretas can feed hierarchical social structures. Buddhist context: All beings have Buddha-nature; human birth is precious (*dal 'byor*) because of recognition capacity, not inherent superiority.

**Miraculous birth** (*rdzus skyes*): Not virgin birth mythology but asexual reproduction in early cosmic ages—before sexual differentiation emerged (detailed pages 1370+). This encodes psychological development: from unitary awareness (light beings) → dualistic perception (male/female) → sexual reproduction → material embodiment.

Dzogchen view: The "fall" is not biblical expulsion from Eden but *ma rig pa* (non-recognition) of own nature. Sun/Moon are metaphors for *rig pa* (awareness) and *ye shes* (primordial wisdom). Jambudvīpa is not geography but *snying po can gyi 'jig rten*—world with heart-essence, capable of recognition.>
