[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DEVOTION AND BLESSING]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: SPIRITUAL CONNECTION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON / NGES DON]

This section presents devotion (mos gus) and blessing (byin rlabs) as essential elements of Dzogchen practice. From the Dzogchen perspective, devotion opens the heart to the transmission, and blessing is the transmission's natural effect.

The epistemic framework here employs both [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING]. Provisionally, devotion is the disciple's opening to the master, and blessing is the master's transmission. Ultimately, devotion and blessing are the natural state recognizing itself.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that devotion is not worship of an external deity but recognition of the master's nature as one's own. The master is the mirror in which the disciple recognizes the natural state. Blessing is not external power but the natural state manifesting.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in devotion and blessing is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of master and disciple, transmission and reception, ultimately there is only the natural state recognizing itself.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes that devotion and blessing are inseparable. Devotion invokes blessing; blessing deepens devotion. In this mutual enhancement, recognition naturally occurs and stabilizes.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to cultivate devotion. Through remembering the master's kindness, recognizing the master's nature as one's own, and maintaining continuous connection, devotion becomes the path itself.

The section discusses the relationship between devotion and recognition. Devotion creates the conditions for recognition; recognition is the ultimate blessing. They are not separate—devotion is recognition in the form of longing.

The epistemic stance maintains that while devotion and blessing are [PROVISIONAL MEANING] in their conventional forms, the recognition they facilitate is [NGES DON].

The section thus establishes devotion and blessing as the living connection between master and disciple—the dynamic through which the natural state is recognized and transmitted.
