[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SENTIENT BEING REALMS]
[INEXHAUSTIBLE DISPLAY]

<"All sentient being realms exist" (*sems can gyi khams thams cad yod de*)—the *khams* (realm/element) as ground of possibility. The training-field (*gdul zhing*) pervaded by earth, water, fire, wind, space (*sa chu me rlung nam mkha*) gathered within Great Brahma eon (*tshangs chen gyi bskal pa*) describes *snod bcud* (container/contained) as display-structure. This is not population census but assertion of recognition-nature's inexhaustible capacity.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DREAM-LIKE APPEARANCE]
[ILLUSION DOCTRINE]

<Within each atom (*rdul phran re*), measureless fields (*zhing khams grangs med*) appear to confused perception (*'khrul snang*). "Like a dream" (*rmi lam lta bu*) and "clearly apparent yet non-existent" (*gsal snang yin pas 'thad pa*) describe *maya* (illusion) not as denial of appearance but as recognition of *rang snang* (self-appearance) nature. Pure karma (*las dag pa*) appears as Buddha-activity (*sangs rgyas kyi mdzad pa*)—samsara and nirvana as dual aspects of single display.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DELUSION AS APPEARANCE]
[EMPTY DISPLAY]

<Mountains, continents (*ri dang gling*), and great fields appearing within single atom describe *'gro ba'i 'khrul snang* (beings' confused appearance). "Non-existent in truth" (*don la med pa*) points to *stong pa nyid* (emptiness) of all phenomena—not nihilistic denial but *gsal stong* (clarity-emptiness) unity. This is valid (*'thad pa*) because appearance and emptiness are non-dual (*dbyer med*). Risk: Misreading as ontological nihilism.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMĀDHIRĀJA CITATION]
[SŪTRIC AUTHORITY FOR DZOGCHEN]

<Extensive citation from *'phags pa ting nge 'dzin rgyal po'i mdo* (Samādhirāja Sutra) establishes *gsung rab* (scriptural) grounding for Dzogchen view. Buddhas as numerous as Ganges sands (*gangga'i klung gi bye ma*) and fields likewise within hair-tip extent (*skra yi khyon*) describes *thogs med* (unobstructed) nature of recognition. Hell beings (*sems can dmyal ba*) and gods (*lha*) coexisting without mixing (*'dres pa med*) or harm (*gnod pa med*) points to *chos nyid* (dharmatā) beyond dualistic conflict.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – INTERPENETRATION PRINCIPLE]
[HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY]

<"Within space of single atom... immeasurable arrangements" (*rdul gcig gi go sa... bkod pa tshad med*) encapsulates *sdong po bkod pa* (interpenetration) doctrine—each part contains whole, each instant contains eternity. This is not physical microcosm but description of *chos nyid* (dharmatā) as non-localizable and inexhaustible. The *sems can gyi zhing* (sentient being fields) are *sangs rgyas kyi yul* (Buddha object/wisdom) as recognition-nature itself.>
