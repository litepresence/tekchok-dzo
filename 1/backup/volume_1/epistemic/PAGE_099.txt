[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR LAMPS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) of thodgal practice—the conditions that allow the four visions to manifest. From the Dzogchen perspective, the four lamps create the optimal conditions for spontaneous presence to appear, though they do not create the visions themselves.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding the four lamps. They are not causes that produce effects but conditions that allow what is already present to manifest. The visions are the natural expression of awareness; the lamps create the conditions for this expression.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the four lamps as skillful means that facilitate recognition. They are not ultimately necessary—awareness is always present—but they are conventionally useful for creating the conditions where recognition can occur.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in the four lamps is the recognition that while conventionally we use specific practices, ultimately awareness requires no conditions. The lamps are fingers pointing at the moon, not the moon itself.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the four lamps:

1. The lamp of the hollow crystal tube (tshigs bu shel gyi sgron ma): The channels of the subtle body through which awareness manifests.

2. The lamp of the smooth white channel (rtsa bkra dkar gyi sgron ma): The central channel as the pathway of primordial wisdom.

3. The lamp of the far-reaching water (rgyangs zhings chu yi sgron ma): The eye consciousness as the gateway for visions.

4. The lamp of self-arisen wisdom (ye shes rang byung gi sgron ma): The innate awareness that is the source of all manifestation.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to work with the four lamps. Specific gazes, postures, and practices activate these conditions, allowing the visions to manifest naturally. The practitioner works with the lamps while maintaining recognition that the source is awareness itself.

The section discusses the relationship between the four lamps and the four visions. The lamps create the conditions; the visions are the natural manifestation. Neither can be neglected—the lamps without recognition are empty; recognition without the lamps may not fully manifest.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the four lamps as conditions, while recognizing that the definitive truth is awareness itself. The lamps are provisional means; the recognition is definitive.

The section thus presents the four lamps as the framework for thodgal practice, the conditions that allow the natural manifestation of spontaneous presence.
