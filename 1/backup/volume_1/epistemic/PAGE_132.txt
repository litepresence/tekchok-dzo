[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TRANSCENDENCE OF CAUSALITY]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: BEYOND CAUSE AND EFFECT]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section presents the Dzogchen view that transcends the causal framework of dependent origination. From the Dzogchen perspective, while causality operates conventionally, ultimately the natural state is beyond cause and effect—it is not produced by causes and does not produce effects.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding transcendence of causality. Unlike lower vehicles that work entirely within the framework of cause and effect—purification producing purity, practice producing realization—Dzogchen recognizes that the natural state is uncaused and unproduced.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that rig pa is not the result of any cause. It has been present since beginningless time, not arising from any condition. This is not a rejection of dependent origination but a recognition that the ultimate transcends even this profound teaching.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in causality is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of causes and effects, ultimately the natural state is empty of both. The ground is not caused; the recognition is not produced; the result is not achieved.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes that Dzogchen transcends both eternalism (a permanent entity) and nihilism (nothingness), both of which are causal notions. The natural state is neither existent nor non-existent, neither caused nor uncaused—it transcends all categories.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to rest in this transcendence. Do not try to cause enlightenment through practice; do not try to prevent delusion through rejection. Simply rest in the uncaused, unproduced natural state.

The section discusses the relationship between this view and conventional practice. While causality is valid conventionally, Dzogchen points to what transcends it. This is not a license for unethical behavior but a recognition of the ultimate nature beyond causality.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for transcendence of causality, recognizing it as the definitive view. While provisional teachings work within causality, the ultimate truth is beyond it.

The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of the natural state as uncaused and unproduced—beyond the framework of dependent origination that characterizes lower vehicles, yet not contradicting it.
