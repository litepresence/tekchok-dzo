[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PARADOX OF PRIMORDIALITY]
[RECOGNITION VS. ATTAINMENT]

<Opening lines establish fundamental Dzogchen paradox: spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) is clear as water wave (*chu 'o dang 'dra*) yet "one by-means-of also my meaning not-understand"—the nature is evident but recognition is rare. Lines 10429-10434 repetitive structure: "primordially-X in dwell and again X"—primordially seized yet doing again, primordially released yet releasing again, primordially placed yet placing again, primordially meditated yet meditating again, primordially viewed yet viewing again, primordially traversed yet traversing again. This is not criticism of practice but description of *ma rtogs* (non-recognition)—seeking what already possessed. Line 10435 "do in not-dwell"—activity without abiding, the Dzogchen ideal. Line 10436 "do not-need"—not prohibition but recognition that need implies lack, and lack is impossible in primordial completeness.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TRANSCENDENCE OF METHOD]
[BEYOND TECHNIQUE]

<Systematic negation of conventional practice categories:
- **Doing**: "done by-means-of seized not-have"—no doer, no deed, no object (*bya byed las gsum*)
- **Meditating**: "meditate not-need, meditate not-have, meditate from exceed, meditated and exhausted"—fourfold transcendence
- **Looking**: "look not-need, look not-have, look object from exceed, what to look"—no object of observation
- **Seeking**: "seek not-need, seek not-have, seek from exceed, find not-have"—paradox of seeking what is never lost

This is *chos nyid zad sa*—exhaustion ground of dharmatā. Not nihilism but completion: when everything is primordially accomplished, method becomes recognition of non-necessity. Line 10452 "wide spontaneous-arising in dwell"—expansive *phyal ba* as mode of being. Line 10453 critique: those who don't understand despite explanation lack *rtogs pa'i las 'brel*—karmic connection for realization. Humor (*bzhad gad*) as appropriate response to futility of explaining what must be recognized directly.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIMÉ PERSPECTIVE]
[NON-SECTARIAN FINALITY]

<Line 10454 "primordially-place dharma ceased"—*chos zad* at primordial ground. "Student all meaning not-find pra yas"—Sanskrit invocation to Prajñāpāramitā, source of meaning. Line 10455 "space wide klong-chen's meaning"—author's name (*klong chen*) as description: vast expanse (*klong*) of great (*chen*) space. "Appear by-means-of experience delightful"—*rig pa* as joyful recognition. Line 10456 "cease one's ground always conduct by-means-of samsara-nirvana boundary not-have release one's yogi"—classic *ris med* (non-sectarian) formulation. Yogi (*rnal 'byor pa*) released from *'khor 'das* boundary through continuous conduct in ground of cessation. Lines 10459-10460 address future readers: "actual meet one's statue arose by-means-of realization self-arise appear one's faith-basis make"—visualization of Longchenpa as living presence, not historical figure. "Realization view's samaya great four always dwell"—four great samayas of Dzogchen view.>

[TRANSITION – CHAPTER CONCLUSION]
[STRUCTURAL MARKER]

<Line 10467-10468: "vehicle's supreme jewel treasury from, samaya aspects arranged is sequence house seven is"—explicit chapter closure. Seventh house (*rim khang bdun pa*) of the Treasury complete. Line 10469-10471: Transition formula (*de ltar*) to next major section: "empowerment and samaya's king great shown after, now essence meaning's nature certainty place from"—completion of preliminary topics (*dbang dam*), now entering definitive meaning (*don gyi snying po*)—the actual nature (*rang bzhin*) to be established with certainty (*gtan la dbab pa*). "First basis nature by-means-of aspect pure's dimension ultimate truth"—primordially pure dharmadhātu as ultimate truth. "Secret-mantra vajra's place difficult spontaneous by-means-of accomplish one's mandala"—vajra mandala as spontaneously accomplished, not constructed. Structural: 7 chapters on empowerment/samaya complete, now entering 8+ chapters on definitive meaning of basis/path/fruit.>

[RISK: PRACTICE ABANDONMENT]

<The systematic negation of "do," "meditate," "look," "seek" presents serious pedagogical risk. Readers may conclude all practice should cease, missing the context: these negations apply from recognition (*rtogs pa*), not from confusion (*ma rtogs*). Lines occur AFTER extensive instructions on guru reliance, empowerment, and samaya. The negation is completion, not rejection—like discarding raft after crossing river. Risk of premature "everything is primordially accomplished" without foundation of view recognition. The text balances: "wide spontaneous-arising in dwell" (recognition) vs. "meaning not-understand one's person" (non-recognition). The teaching is discriminating, not universal—offered to those with connection, wasted on those without.>
