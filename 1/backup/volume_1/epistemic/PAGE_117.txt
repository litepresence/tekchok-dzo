[SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The three clarities (*gsal ba gsum*), three confidences (*gdeng gsum*), three irreversibilities (*mi ldog pa gsum*), three appearances (*snang ba gsum*), three emptinesses (*stong pa gsum*)—these taxonomies describe recognition's qualities, not progressive attainments. The phrase *sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa'i dgongs pa* (intent of body and wisdom without meeting/parting) indicates *sku gsum* and *ye shes lnga* as non-dual display. The threefold clarification (*gsal ba gsum*)—external objects, awareness-body, space-awareness—demonstrates *thod rgal* visionary recognition of display as display.>

[GROUND TANTRA AS SUCHNESS]

<The three emptinesses—delusion empty because awareness inexpressible, mind empty because conditionless, light empty because no coming/going—indicate *stong pa* as recognition's nature, not nihilistic void. Ground tantra (*gzhir rgyud*) etymology: all buddhas/beings born from it therefore outermost (*phyi mo*) tantra, or recognized as buddha-tantra, unrecognized as being-tantra. This is hermeneutical, not ontological: same *rig pa* recognized or not.>
