[KARMIC PRODUCTION OF LOWER REALMS]

<Karmic causality establishing three lower realms (*ngan 'gro gsum*). Lines 1420-1422: "instant vicinity and also arose, then desire excess action preta and, delusion excess animals in individually ripened and attached"—Jambudvīpa with near surrounding (*nyi tshe nyi 'khor*) arose. Then excessive desire (*'dod chags lhag pa*) matures as pretas; excessive delusion (*gti mug lhag pa*) matures as animals—each respectively shrinking/attached (*chags*). This is *las rnam smin* (karmic maturation) doctrine: affliction → action → rebirth. The mapping is precise: desire → preta (insatiable hunger); delusion → animal (instinctual confusion). Missing: anger → hell, which follows immediately. The psychological etiology: mental states produce corresponding existence conditions. This is *rgyu 'bras* (cause-result) teaching, not Dzogchen view of primordial liberation.>

[HELL REALM TEMPORALITIES]

<Exponential time dilation in hell realms. Lines 1423-1425: Reviving hell (*yang sos*)—50 human years = 1 day of Four Great Kings; 30 days = 1 month; 12 months = 1 year; 500 years = 1 day of Reviving; living 500 own years. This establishes base unit: human-to-divine time ratio. Lines 1426-1432: Escalating geometric progression:
- Thirty-three gods' 1,000 years = 1 day for Kālakāñja (Black Line) hell
- 2,000 years = Saṃghāta (Crushing) day
- 4,000 years = Tuṣita's Raurava (Screaming) day
- 8,000 years = Nirmanarati's Mahāraurava (Great Screaming) day
- 16,000 years = Paranirmitavaśavartin's Pratāpana (Intense Heating) day
- Mahātāpana (Great Intense): 1/2 intermediate eon (*bar bskal*)
- Avīci (Uninterrupted): 1 full intermediate eon

The mathematics encode psychological intensity: deeper hells = longer subjective time = more intense suffering. This is *sems kyi snang ba* (mind's display), not external geography.>

[COLD HELLS AND MATHEMATICAL EXHAUSTION]

<Eight cold hells (*grang dmyal brgyad*) named by symptoms (lines 1433-1439):
1. Arbuda (Blisters)
2. Arbudanirbheda (Burst Blisters)
3. Aṭaṭa (Chattering Teeth)
4. Hahava (Lamentation)
5. Huhuva (Teeth Chattering)
6. Utpala-like splitting
7. Padma (Lotus)-like splitting
8. Mahāpadma (Great Lotus)-like splitting

Lines 1440-1443: Lifespan calculation—Kosala's 100-load sesame, 100 human years per seed removal. When sesame exhausted, Arbuda life exhausted; remaining twenty times longer. This produces astronomical numbers encoding *infinite* from finite perspective—kalpa-scale durations. Lines 1444-1446: Preta lifespan: 100 human years = 1 day, 500 own years. Animals: indefinite (*nges pa ma yin*)—great nāgas (*klu*) live intermediate eon. The indefiniteness of animal realm reflects ignorance's amorphous nature—no clear boundaries like desire/delusion.>

[RISK: TEMPORAL LITERALISM]

<The elaborate time calculations present serious pedagogical risk. Readers may:
1. Take durations literally ( sesame-counting as temporal measurement)
2. Calculate total years mathematically
3. View hells as physical locations with coordinates

Actual meaning: These encode psychological intensity and karmic weight. "Intermediate eon" (*bar bskal*) is not clock time but *experience of duration*—intense suffering stretches time; bliss contracts it. The Avīci hell's "one eon" is instant from enlightened perspective, eternity for sufferer.

Risk of soteriological despair: "Hell is so long, liberation impossible." Response: Line 1432 says "experiencing long continuous suffering"—*myong* (experiencing), not permanent condemnation. All hells are *chos can* (possessors of dharmatā)—empty nature allows liberation.

Dzogchen view: These realms are *rang snang* (self-display) of *ma rig pa* (non-recognition). No external hell exists; suffering is mind's own display. Recognition transforms hell into pure land instantly. The detailed cosmology is *tha snyad* (conventional) upaya, not *don dam* (ultimate) truth.>
