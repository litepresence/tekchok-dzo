[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMAYA COMMITMENTS]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: PRACTICE FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: DRANG DON]

This section presents the samaya (dam tshig) commitments of Dzogchen practice—the vows that bind the practitioner to the natural state. From the Dzogchen perspective, samaya is not merely ethical constraint but the continuity of recognition itself.

The epistemic framework here employs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] as the structure for samaya. While the natural state is beyond all vows, conventionally the practitioner takes commitments to maintain recognition and avoid reifying delusion. These are skillful means, not absolute constraints.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the ultimate samaya is recognition itself. To remain in recognition is to keep samaya; to fall into delusion is to break it. The conventional vows—root samayas and branch samayas—are supports for maintaining recognition.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in samaya is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of commitments to keep and violations to avoid, ultimately there is nothing to violate because all is primordially pure.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the root samaya is not to stray from the natural state. The branch samayas support this root—avoiding harm, maintaining practice, respecting the master, and so on. These are expressions of recognition, not external rules.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how samaya functions in practice. When recognition is strong, samaya is naturally maintained; when recognition weakens, conscious commitment to samaya helps restore it. Samaya is both protection and expression of recognition.

The section discusses the restoration of broken samaya. In Dzogchen, since delusion is empty, samaya can always be restored through recognition. There is no stain that cannot be purified; no violation that cannot be mended through returning to the natural state.

The epistemic stance maintains [DRANG DON] for conventional samaya, recognizing it as provisional support for recognition. The ultimate samaya—continuous recognition—is [NGES DON].

The section thus establishes samaya as the continuity of recognition expressed through commitment—the vows that bind the practitioner to the natural state and protect against falling into delusion.
