[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE DOORS OF APPEARING]
[EXTREME FREE SPONTANEOUS CLEAR]

<Three doors of appearing (*snang sgo gsum*) from spontaneous presence. Line 11365: "extreme free like appearing's door not-ceased by-means-of spontaneous self-face-in clear"—*mtha' grol ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas lhun grub rang ngo na gsal ba*—door of appearing like extreme freedom, not ceased, spontaneously clear in own-face. This is *lhun grub*—spontaneous presence without obstruction. Line 11366: "pure primordial-wisdom's door like appearing's door not-ceased by-means-of entity primordially-pure's appearance sky cloud not-like appearance above see"—pure primordial wisdom door appearing: entity primordially pure appearance like cloudless sky seen above. This is *ka dag*—primordial purity as unobscured clarity. Line 11367-11369: "impure samsara's door like appearing's door not-ceased by-means-of below six-classes's appearance-portion appearance, samsara lower-realms play-to primordially-arise, said manner"—impure samsara door appearing: below, six classes' appearance portion; samsara lower realms play primordially arising. Three doors: (1) extreme free spontaneous clear, (2) pure primordial wisdom, (3) impure samsara. All "not ceased" (*ma 'gags*)—basis accommodates all appearances without obstruction.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE KAYA MANIFESTATION]
[CAPACITY OF APPEARANCE]

<Three capacities (*rtsal*) of ground-appearance manifesting as three kayas. Line 11370: "thus spontaneous's appearance's capacity from primordial-wisdom five's field-in enjoyment-body's appearance measure not also directly self-clear"—spontaneous appearance's capacity: from five primordial wisdoms' field, enjoyment body's appearance measureless, directly self-clear. *Saṃbhogakāya* (*longs sku*) from five wisdoms' capacity. Line 11371: "quality's capacity from direction-corner-in nature emanation body's field appearance also infer-to not self-arise"—quality's capacity: from direction-corner, nature emanation body's field appearance, not inferred, self-arisen. *Nirmāṇakāya* (*sprul sku*) from qualities' capacity in all directions. Line 11372: "compassion's capacity from below sentient-being-to appearance also measure not self-to appear"—compassion's capacity: from below to sentient beings, appearance measureless, self-appearing. This is the dynamic of *thugs rje*—compassion as appearance capacity. All three kayas are not created but spontaneously manifest from ground's capacities.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GROUND-APPEARANCE NATURE]
[DREAM-LIKE MANIFESTATION]

<Lines 11373-11376: "thus this-like ground-appearance clear-to directly appearing mirror-to form-reflection arisen like, self-to appear other-to not-appear self-appearance-to not-know dream's appearance like, flickering confused scattered arise, self-side not-grasped by-means-of moment instant"—thus ground-appearance like this: clear, directly appearing like mirror-form-reflection arisen; self-appearing, other not appearing, not knowing self-appearance, like dream appearance; flickering, confused, scattered arising; self-side not grasped, momentary instant. Ground-appearance (*gzhi snang*) is self-appearing (*rang snang*)—not objective, not shared. Like dream: vivid yet private, momentary yet unreal. Lines 11377-11391: Hierarchical structure: "that also primordially-pure's below spontaneous's appearance, that-of below light-clear five's thig-le and ray-radiance-to appearance ground early great exist, that-of below enjoyment-body's appearance, that-of below nature emanation-body's appearance exist, that-of below six-modes's appearance"—beneath primordial purity: spontaneous appearance; beneath that: five light-clear thigles and ray-radiance appearance, ground early great; beneath that: enjoyment-body appearance; beneath that: nature emanation-body appearance; six-modes appearance. Emanation bodies: "that tame beings-tame emanation-body muni six and, impure emanation body birth aging death tame-by-means-of field appearance exist"—taming beings: six muni emanation bodies; impure emanation body: birth-aging-death taming field appearance. Spontaneous arising-way eight: "that spontaneous arising-way eight that arise's ground, being's bag filling like, that-by-means-of ga'u-of sound expressed, that also bkra-shis mdzes-ldan great's tantra from, alas fatigue confusion not also I-of capacity-from confusion arisen, ground not-change from, nature not-cease arise-from, compassion-by-means-of not-determinate from non-awareness self-arise"—eight spontaneous arising ways; ground like being's bag filling; expressed by ga'u sound; from Bkra shis mdzes ldan great tantra; confusion arisen from capacity, not fatigue; from ground not changing, nature not ceasing to arise, compassion indeterminate, non-awareness self-arisen. This is *gzhi snang* topology: layered manifestation from subtle (primordial purity) to coarse (emanation bodies).>
