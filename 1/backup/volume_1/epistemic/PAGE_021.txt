[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

<Longchenpa establishes the hermeneutical triad distinguishing common (*thun mong*) sūtra-treatise sources, uncommon (*thun mong ma yin pa*) tantra-section measurements, and the unsurpassed vehicle (*bla na med pa'i theg pa*) Vajra-peak (*rdo rje rtse mo*) perspective. This is doxographical positioning, not hierarchical superiority claim—asserting that Dzogchen view recognizes the single nature (*ngo bo gcig*) of all presentations while other vehicles remain at the level of conceptual designation (*rtog pa'i btags pa*).>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<The *Ati-bkod-pa-chen-po* citation from the *sGra-thal-'gyur* cycle anchors cosmology in Dzogchen scriptural authority. The twenty-five stacked three-thousand-world-systems (*stong gsum nyi shu rtsa lnga brtsegs ma*) positioned at the thirteenth level—mathematical center of the array—functions as *sems*-side preparatory framework. The "basis and essence flower-ornamented field" (*gzhi dang snying po me tog gis brgyan pa'i zhing khams*) terminology encodes recognition-topology within visionary cosmology.>

[RISK: TEMPORAL REIFICATION]

<The four-stage aeon cycle (*bskal pa bzhi*)—arising, abiding, destruction, emptying—derives from Vasubandhu's *Kośa* and operates within causal vehicle temporal framework. The container-contained sequence (*snod bcud kyi rim pa*) with twenty intermediate aeons (*bar gyi bskal pa nyi shu*) presents conventional cosmogony. Risk: Misreading this sequential genesis as literal temporal process rather than recognition-context establishing dependent origination (*rten 'brel*) patterns.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The seed-syllable cosmogony—triangular E (*e gru gsum*) as ground-supporting space and A-UṂ (*a 'um*) as activating wind—employs tantric sonic-energetic framework. The "completely mind-joy" (*rnam par yid dang ba*) space with white-white light quality represents *thig le* topology within visionary generation. Risk: Reifying seed-syllables as causal agents rather than spontaneous display (*lhun grub*) of primordial awareness.>
