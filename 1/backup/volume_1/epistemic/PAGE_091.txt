[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PATH AS RECOGNITION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: SOTERIOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON]

This section transitions from the ground to the path (lam), presenting Dzogchen's unique understanding of the path as recognition rather than transformation. From the Dzogchen perspective, the path does not lead to a different state but reveals the ground as it always was. This is the fundamental distinction between causal and result vehicles.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding the path. Unlike causal vehicles that work through gradual accumulation and purification, Dzogchen's path consists of recognizing what is already present. The path is not a journey from here to there but a recognition that there is nowhere to go.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes the path as the self-liberation (rang grol) of delusion. Delusion is not purified through antidotes but liberated through recognition of its nature. When the nature of a thought is recognized, it self-liberates; when the nature of an emotion is recognized, it self-liberates. This is the path of direct recognition.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] on the path is the recognition that while conventionally we speak of path, practice, and progress, ultimately there is no path to traverse, no practice to perform, and no progress to make. The path dissolves in the recognition of the ground.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the three aspects of the path in Dzogchen: view (lta ba) as certainty in the natural state, meditation (sgom pa) as continuous flow without distraction, and conduct (spyod pa) as natural expression without acceptance or rejection. These three are not separate practices but aspects of recognition.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes the distinctive practices of the Dzogchen path. Trekcho (khregs chod) cuts through conceptual mind to reveal primordial purity. Thodgal (thod rgal) allows spontaneous presence to manifest in its full display. Both are methods of recognition, not transformation.

The section discusses the relationship between ground, path, and fruition in Dzogchen. The ground is primordial purity; the path is recognizing this; the fruition is the full manifestation of recognition. These three are inseparable—recognizing the ground is the path, and the full flowering of recognition is the fruition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the Dzogchen path, recognizing that it points directly to definitive meaning. While the path may employ provisional methods, its essence is the direct recognition of the natural state.

The section thus establishes the Dzogchen path as recognition rather than transformation, distinguishing it from causal vehicles while respecting their function for those who need gradual training.
