[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CONCLUSION OF NON-BUDDHIST REFUTATION]
[EPISTEMIC CATEGORY: SYNTHETIC TRANSITION]
[VIEWPOINT TAG: NGES DON PREPARATION]

This section concludes the extensive refutation of non-Buddhist views, summarizing three fundamental errors that characterize all wrong vehicles: eternalist self-grasping (bdag 'dzin), nihilist denial of cause and result, and incomplete realization of the middle way. Having cleared away these misconceptions, the text now prepares to present the authentic Buddhist vehicles, with Dzogchen as their culmination.

The epistemic framework here transitions from [PROVISIONAL MEANING] polemics to [DEFINITIVE MEANING] presentation. The refutation serves its purpose—not to establish Buddhism's philosophical superiority in a worldly sense, but to clear the ground for direct recognition. From the [DZOGCHEN VIEW], even the distinction between Buddhist and non-Buddhist is ultimately conventional, for rig pa transcends all such categories.

Eternalist self-grasping represents the root of samsara—the mistaken identification with a permanent self. Whether this self is conceived as cosmic (Samkhya's purusha) or individual, the error is the same. The [ULTIMATE TRUTH] recognizes that all phenomena, including the self, are empty of inherent existence. Dzogchen's recognition of rig pa dissolves this grasping at its root, revealing the self as the spontaneous display of awareness.

Nihilist denial of cause and result cuts the root of ethics and spiritual practice. Without acknowledging karma and dependent origination, beings have no framework for transformation. However, the [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that karma is also empty—not non-existent, but dependently originated without inherent nature. This allows for the possibility of swift liberation through recognition, rather than merely gradual purification through cause and effect.

Incomplete realization characterizes those who have partial insight but fail to reach the complete view. This includes practitioners of lower vehicles who achieve liberation from gross afflictions but fail to recognize the subtlest obscurations. The [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] acknowledges these as valid paths for beings of lesser capacity, but the [DEFINITIVE MEANING] points to Atiyoga as the complete realization.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] gives way to [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] as the text transitions to presenting the actual path. Having established what is to be abandoned, the text now turns to what is to be practiced and realized.

The epistemic stance maintains that while polemical distinctions are necessary for pedagogy, the ultimate goal transcends all distinctions. The Buddha taught 84,000 teachings to address 84,000 types of mental affliction, yet all converge in the recognition of the natural state. Dzogchen represents the most direct pointing to this recognition, bypassing the need for extensive philosophical analysis.

The section thus serves as a bridge between the preliminary clearing of wrong views and the positive presentation of the authentic path. The practitioner, now freed from major misconceptions, is prepared to enter the nine vehicles and progress toward the Dzogchen view.
