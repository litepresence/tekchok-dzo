[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMANTABHADRA NATURE]
[ONTOLOGICAL NON-DUALITY]

<Samantabhadra "abiding in state inseparable from kayas and wisdom" (*sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa*) describes *chos sku'i rang bzhin* (Dharmakāya nature) as *bya rtsol las 'das pa* (beyond activity/effort). The phrase *nang gsal phra ba'i ye shes* (inner clarity subtle awareness) points to *gdod ma'i dbyings* (primordial expanse)—not location but recognition-state. Risk: Reifying Samantabhadra as temporal being who "achieved" enlightenment.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-DISPLAY COSMOLOGY]
[SPONTANEOUS MANIFESTATION]

<The "spontaneously manifesting pure realm" (*rang snang lhun grub*) emerges from *byin rlabs* (blessing) as *gzhi snang* (ground-appearance)—not external creation but *rang snang* (self-appearance) of awareness. Five lights (*'od lnga*) and five-family maṇḍala (*rigs lnga'i dkyil 'khor*) describe *ye shes lnga* (five wisdoms) as intrinsic display. The *las dang smon lam dag pa* (pure karma/aspiration) indicates recognition-condition, not merit accumulation.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VAJRADHARA MANIFESTATION]
[QUALITY-COMPLETE EMBODIMENT]

<Vajradhara (*rdo rje 'chang*) manifestation as "sixth Buddha" from *longs sku* (Saṃbhogakāya) describes *yon tan rdzogs pa'i sku* (qualities-complete body)—not sixth in temporal sequence but *mtshan rdzogs* (complete marks) as display-nature. The retinue (*'khor*) of vidyādharas, ḍākinīs, and siddhas represents *rig pa* (awareness) recognizing itself through diverse forms. Tantra-ocean (*rgyud sde rgya mtsho*) teaching is *chos phun sum tshogs* (perfection of Dharma)—inexhaustible display.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION TEACHING]
[SKILLFUL MEANS HIERARCHY]

<Nirmāṇakāya (*sprul sku*) teaching appears through *gang la gang 'dul* (whichever tames whichever)—the principle of *thabs* (skillful means) adapting to *gdul bya* (trainees). Sūtra, Vinaya, Abhidharma (*mdo sde, 'dul ba, mngon pa*) as *theg pa sna tshogs* (various vehicles) prepare for *'bras bu rdo rje'i theg pa* (result Vajra vehicle)—not linear prerequisite but recognition-ground preparation. The *phun sum tshogs pa lnga* (five perfections) structure maintained across all displays.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VEHICLE BEYOND VEHICLES]
[TRANSCENDENT ASSERTION]

<Causal vehicles (*rgyu mtshan nyid kyi theg pa gsum*) function as *rgyu dang thabs* (cause and method) for entering Vajra vehicle—not denigration but functional classification. The *gsang sngags rdo rje theg pa* (secret mantra Vajra vehicle) culminates in *rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po* (nature Great Perfection) as *bla na med pa'i theg pa* (unsurpassable vehicle). "Beyond peak" (*rtse mo'i 'das pa*) indicates transcendence of vehicle-concept itself—*theg pa'i rtse mo* that is no vehicle.>
