[2013-2032] [CONCEPT] The Synthesis Position
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa presents a third position synthesizing cause and result nihilism, attributed to the hunchbacked son of Katika (*ka ta'i bu nog can*).

**Three-Phase Ontology:**

1. **Arising** (*dang po*): All sentient beings first arise from the space of elements (*'byung ba'i dbyings*)
2. **Abiding** (*bar du*): They abide in the space of elements
3. **Dissolution** (*tha ma*): They dissolve into the space of elements without trace (*yang yal te cang med par*)

**Key Doctrines:**

**The Space of Elements as Universal Self:**
- *'byung ba'i dbyings tsam zhig kun gyi bdag nyid du smra* — "they speak of merely the space of arising as the self-nature of all"

**The Ninefold Structure:**

In the space of abiding:
- *mi gnas dgu gnas pa* — "nine abodes of non-abiding" arise as whatever appears

From the space of arising:
- *ma shar dgu shar* — "nine non-arisings arise"

**Appearance Structure:**
- Outer: forms, objects of various colors (*dkar dmar sna tshogs*)
- Inner: sentient beings, mental concepts (*sems kyi rtog pa*)
- Body: nine aspects that do/don't arise differently

**Liberation Mechanism:**

At liberation (*grol ba'i tshe*):
- *ma grol dgu grol* — "nine unliberated become liberated"
- All vessels, contents, embodied forms dissolve themselves (*rang yal*)
- Since there's no unliberation, destroyed beings cannot return to three realms

**Final Position:**
- All beings first arise adventitiously (*glo bur du byung*) from space
- Now they abide adventitiously in space
- Finally liberated adventitiously into space, never returning
