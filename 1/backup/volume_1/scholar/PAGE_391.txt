[16256-16259] [STRUCTURE] # SA BCAD: Enumeration of the Four Lamps
**Analysis:** This section marks the transitional enumeration (*sa bcad*) of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) in the *thod rgal* exposition. Longchenpa lists the four lamps following the completion of the Three Movements of Mind-Turning in the preceding section. This structural placement reflects the Dzogchen architectural principle that *thod rgal* practice presupposes preliminary mind-turning.

[16259] [PHILOLOGY] The term *so so'i* (each/particular) functions as a distributive marker, indicating that each lamp will receive individual treatment. The particle *la* with the verb *bshad* (explain) establishes the locative sense: "in explaining the detailed nature of each."

[16260-16263] [CONCEPT] The Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*):
1. *rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma* — Water Lamp of Far-Casting (holds both samsara and nirvana appearances)
2. *thig le stong pa'i sgron ma* — Lamp of Empty Bindus
3. *dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma* — Lamp of Completely Pure Sphere
4. *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma* — Lamp of Self-Arising Wisdom

Longchenpa here introduces the foundational *thod rgal* terminology following the *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Pradīpodyotana*) tantric tradition.

[16264-16273] [STRUCTURE] # Architectural Scheme of the Water Lamp Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes a ninefold analytical framework (*dgu*) for the Water Lamp:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*)
2. Definition (*nges tshig*)
3. Classification (*dbye ba*)
4. Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*)
5. Abode (*gnas*)
6. Manner of arising (*gang gis skyed tshul*)
7. Appearance of arising door (*'char sgo'i snang ba*)
8. Simile (*mthun dpe*)
9. Definite measure (*tshad nges pa*)

This ninefold schema reflects the *mdzod* genre's encyclopedic impulse and mirrors structural patterns found in Longchenpa's *Yid bzhin mdzod*.

[16274-16276] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *'khor 'das gnyis ka'i cha 'dzin pas*:
The instrumental *kyis* following the genitive *ka'i* creates a compound causal construction: "by means of holding the parts of both samsara and nirvana." The term *dbang rten* (power-support) denotes the supporting condition for the arising of appearances, not the appearances themselves.

[16276-16282] [CONTEXT] Citation from *gser gyi me tog mdzes pa rin po che'i sgron ma 'bar ba'i rgyud* (*Beautiful Golden Flower: Blazing Jewel Lamp Tantra*). This tantra belongs to the esoteric *thod rgal* cycle of the *sNying thig* tradition. The verse employs the technical term *mthong byed* (seeing-agent) rather than *mig* (eye), indicating a distinction between the physical organ and the cognitive function of visual apprehension.

[16283-16292] [CONCEPT] Etymological Analysis of *rgyang zhags* (Far-Casting Snare):

**Rgyang (Distance):**
- Holds (*'dzin*) the reflection of clarity (*'od gsal dngas pa'i gzugs brnyan*) and deluded appearances
- Casts samsara (*'khor ba*) with deluded thoughts far away
- Casts nirvana (*myang 'das*) far if not realized

**Zhags (Snare):**
- The particle *zhags* (*zhags pa*) functions as both noun (snare) and metaphorical extension
- Self-appearance (*rang snang*) binds impurity when seen
- Non-recognition (*ma rtogs*) binds self-awareness through attachment to deluded appearance

[16290-16292] [PHILOLOGY] The comparative particle *lta bu* (like/as) following *chos mthun pa* (similar with the Dharma) establishes the rope-snare simile. The particle *kyang* in line 16292 functions as concessive: "although when examined..." This sets up the Madhyamika-style analysis that follows.

[16292] [CONTEXT] The analysis of *'khrul snang* and *'khrul 'dzin* reflects the standard Yogācāra-Svātantrika distinction between deluded appearance and deluded apprehension. The phrase *dpyad na gzhi med* (when examined, groundless) invokes the emptiness of inherent nature (*ngo bo nyid kyis stong*).
