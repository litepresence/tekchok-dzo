[1344-1346] [PHILOLOGY] The Mechanism of Degeneration
**Analysis:**

**Causal Chain:**
- *sngon gyi las kyi dbang gis* — By power of previous action
- *nyon mongs pa bag la nyal langs te* — Afflictions' latency arose
- *dpal dang gzi brjid dman par gyur to* — Splendor and majesty became low

**Technical Terms:**
- *bag la nyal* (anusaya) — Latent tendencies dormant in the mindstream
- *langs te* — Arose/awakened (perfective, indicating completed action)
- *dbang* (power/influence) — Indicates karma's compulsive force

**Doxographical Context:** This reflects the standard Buddhist view that karmic maturation (*vipāka*) occurs when conditions ripen, causing cyclic existence to manifest.

[1345-1349] [CONTEXT] Human Expansion to the Four Continents
**Analysis:**

**Sequential Settlement:**

1. **Jambudvīpa** (*'dzam bu'i gling*) — First arisen, famous as "action ground" (*las kyi sa pa*)

2. **Pūrvavideha / Body-Elevated** (*shar gyi lus 'phags gling*) — East
   - *lus 'phags* = Body-Elevated (Tibetan translation)
   - Humans increased from gods via miraculous birth

3. **Uttarakuru / Sound-Not-Heard** (*byang gi sgra mi snyan*) — North
   - *sgra mi snyan* = Sound-Not-Heard (Tibetan etymology)

4. **Aparagodānīya / Cow-Enjoyment** (*nub kyi ba glang spyod*) — West
   - *ba glang spyod* = Cow-Enjoyment (Tibetan rendering)

**Cosmological Significance:** The directional expansion represents the universal nature of saṃsāric existence—human condition extends throughout the world-system.

[1350-1354] [STRUCTURE] The World-Endurable Epoch (*'jig rten mi mjed*)
**Analysis:**

**Etymology:** *'jig rten mi mjed* (World-Endurable/Trāyastriṃśa-like)
- Land name when life reached 100 million years (*bye ba* = 10 million)

**Characteristics:**
- Beings born from light eggs (*'od kyi sgo nga*)
- Light radiated 7 fathoms (*'dom bdun*) 
- Could travel through sky (*nam mkha' la 'gro*)
- Food: elemental essence (*'byung ba'i dngas ma*)
- Naked but with good lakes for washing

**Virtue:** *rang bzhin gyis dge ba bcu la spyod pa* — Naturally engaged in ten virtues

**Golden Age Continuation:** Despite decline from primordial state, still maintains extraordinary qualities and natural virtue.

[1355-1358] [PHILOLOGY] The Heat-Moisture Gathered Epoch
**Analysis:**

**Name:** *drod gsher 'dus pa 'od gyis spungs pa* — Heat-Moisture Gathered Light-Gathered

**Degeneration Process:**
- *tshe yang bags kyis bri* — Life gradually decreases
- *'od dang bsod nams kyang nyams par gyur* — Light and merit also degenerated

**Mechanism of Birth Transformation:**
- Hot elements (*'byung ba tsha ba*) create heat
- Cool elements become cause and condition
- All beings born from tree sap heat-moisture (*shing gi zil pa las drod gsher skyes*)

**Lifespan:** 100,000 years (*'bum*)

**Material Culture:**
- Food: tree fruit (*ljon shing gi 'bras bu*)
- Clothes: good tree leaves (*shing lo bzang po*)
- One human birth per tree

[1360-1364] [CONTEXT] The Attachment-Arising Epoch
**Analysis:**

**Name:** *chags 'byung mngal du snang ba* — Attachment-Arising Womb-Appearance

**Lifespan:** 80,000 years (*brgyad khri*)

**Physiological Development:**
- *pho mo'i dbang po ni ma dod* — Male-female sense-powers not yet opened
- *gcig la gcig mthong na dga'* — Joy when seeing each other
- *reg na bde ba tsam* — Merely pleasure when touching

**Emergence of Sexuality:** The "opening" of male-female sense powers marks the arising of sexual differentiation and desire.

[1365-1369] [STRUCTURE] The Beginning of Affliction Manifestation
**Analysis:**

**Critical Transition:**
- *nyon mongs pa mngon du rgyu langs pa'i mgo btsugs te* — Beginning made of afflictions manifestly moving/arising

**Completion of Sexual Differentiation:**
- *las kyi dbang gis* — By power of action/karma
- *pho mo'i dbang po'i sgo dod pa tsam du gyur* — Male-female sense-power apertures merely opened

**Philosophical Significance:** This marks the transition from spontaneous birth to womb-birth, from androgynous to sexual, from natural virtue to conditions requiring discipline. The Buddha's teachings become necessary from this point onward.

**Dzogchen Parallel:** This narrative of decline mirrors the Dzogchen teaching that sentient beings have fallen from primordial awareness (*rig pa*) into dualistic consciousness (*sems*), requiring the path of liberation to return.
