[9012-9038] [STRUCTURE] Purification Causes: Sixteen Defilements

This section presents the sixteen defilements (dri ma bcu drug) to be purified and their corresponding sixteen purifiers, establishing the complete framework for purification through the empowerment system.

[9012-9030] [PHILOLOGY] Defilement and Purification Terminology

The text employs karmic vocabulary:
- "Dag byed" (purifier): Agent of cleansing
- "Dag rgyu" (cause of purification): Defilement to be purified
- "Dri ma" (defilement): Obscuration, stain
- "Bcu drug" (sixteen): Complete number
- "'Gyur dang bcas" (with transformation): Including change

The particle "ni" marks completion: "de dag gi dag byed dbang bzhi ste" (their purifiers are four empowerments). The emphatic "ste" establishes identification.

[9031-9056] [CONTEXT] Sixteen Defilements System

The sixteen defilements correspond to:
- Four defilements per aspect (lus, ngag, yid, sems)
- Four aspects per empowerment
- 4 x 4 = 16 total

Structure:
1. Lus (body): 4 defilements
2. Ngag (speech): 4 defilements
3. Yid (intellect): 4 defilements
4. Sems (mind): 4 defilements

Each defilement has specific purifier.

[9057-9082] [CONCEPT] Defilement-Purifier Correspondence

The system operates through:
1. Identification:
   - Each defilement recognized
   - Specific purifier applied
   - Transformation occurs

2. Progressive refinement:
   - Gross to subtle
   - Outer to inner
   - Temporary to ultimate

3. Complete coverage:
   - All dimensions addressed
   - No residue remains
   - Natural purity revealed

[STRUCTURE] Body Defilements: Fourfold Analysis

[9083-9108] [PHILOLOGY] Body and Element Terminology

The text employs elemental vocabulary:
- "Lus" (body): Physical form
- "Chu" (water): Liquid element
- "Tshogs" (collection): Aggregated mass
- "Me" (fire): Heat element
- "Rlung" (wind): Air element

The particle "ni" marks defilement: "lus la chu tshogs pa'i chos bsdus pas 'ching byed rgya'i dri mar song" (in body, dharmas collected as water collections become binding fetter defilement). The resultative "song" indicates transformation.

[9109-9134] [CONTEXT] Four Elements and Defilements

The four body defilements based on elements:
1. Chu (water) defilement:
   - Tshogs pa (collection): Aggregation
   - 'Ching byed (binding fetter): Restriction

2. Me (fire) defilement:
   - Smin cing gsal bar byed pa (ripening and clarifying)
   - Dngos por grub pa (established as thing)

3. Rlung (wind) defilement:
   - So so'i las byed pa (performing individual actions)
   - Zhen pa rang rgyud (attachment to self)

4. Sa (earth) defilement:
   - Khyab pa'i gzhi (pervasive ground)
   - Lhan cig skyes pa (co-emergent)

[9135-9160] [CONCEPT] Element-Defilement-Wisdom Correspondence

The four elements become defilements through grasping:
1. Water: Aggregation → Attachment to form
2. Fire: Ripening → Attachment to vitality
3. Wind: Activity → Attachment to function
4. Earth: Stability → Attachment to existence

Purification transforms them into:
1. Water → Mirror wisdom (me long lta bu)
2. Fire → Equality wisdom (mnyam pa nyid)
3. Wind → Discriminating wisdom (sor rtogs)
4. Earth → Dharmadhatu wisdom (chos dbyings)

[STRUCTURE] Speech and Mind Defilements

[9161-9186] [PHILOLOGY] Speech and Thought Terminology

The text employs conceptual vocabulary:
- "Ngag" (speech): Verbal expression
- "Smra" (speak): Vocalization
- "Yid kyi rtog pa" (intellect's conceptuality): Discursive thought
- "Bslad pa" (corrupted): Distorted
- "Dri ma" (defilement): Obscuration

The particle "ni" marks defilement: "ngag smra na'ang smra'o snyam pa yid kyi rtog pas bslad pa'i dri ma" (even when speaking, the defilement corrupted by intellect's conceptuality thinking "I speak"). The emphatic "ni" establishes identification.

[9187-9212] [CONTEXT] Speech Defilements Fourfold

The four speech defilements:
1. Smra byed kyi dri ma (speaker's defilement):
   - Body level of speech
   - Physical production

2. Smra bya'i tshig gi dri ma (spoken word's defilement):
   - Conceptual investigation
   - Verbal formulation

3. Brjod las rtog pa'i dri ma (expression-action thought's defilement):
   - Transformation by thought
   - Conceptual overlay

4. Gzhan: Additional defilements complete four

[9213-9238] [CONCEPT] Conceptual Defilement Structure

The defilements operate through:
1. Production level:
   - Smra byed (speaker): Physical mechanism
   - Unclean due to attachment

2. Content level:
   - Smra bya (spoken): Verbal formulation
   - Unclean due to conceptualization

3. Process level:
   - Rtog pa (thought): Cognitive overlay
   - Unclean due to distortion

4. Result level:
   - Brjod bya (expression): Communicated meaning
   - Unclean due to limitation

Purification transforms speech into vajra speech (rdo rje gsung).

**Summary:**

Page 221 presents the sixteen defilements system, body defilements based on four elements, and speech/mind defilements. Philologically, the text employs karmic vocabulary, elemental terminology, and conceptual vocabulary. Contextual sources include Abhidharma elemental theory, Yogacara defilement analysis, and four/five wisdom systems. Conceptually, the section demonstrates sixteen-fold defilement-purifier correspondence, element-based defilements transformed into wisdoms, and conceptual defilements of speech operating through production/content/process/result levels—all representing empowerment as comprehensive defilement purification revealing natural wisdom.
