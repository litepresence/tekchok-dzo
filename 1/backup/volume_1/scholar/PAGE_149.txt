[5868-5934] [CONTEXT] Common Preamble Explanation
**Analysis:** Lines 5868-5934 present the common preamble as taught in other vehicles:

**Citation from *Thal 'gyur* [5869-5874]:**
- "Teacher's speech taught to retinue"
- "Marvelous supreme assembly teaching chief"
- "Common preamble cause and condition"
- "For opening others' doors merely"
- "Called common"

**Purpose [5875-5883]:**
As common vehicle sutras and tantras teach, this great secret definitive tantra also, after uncommon preamble, says "Thus I heard at one time" etc. This serves to:
- Accord with all vehicles' sutras
- As it is meaning, explained
- Dispel doubt about where, when, what teacher, what retinue, what dharma taught

**Three Buddha Body Teaching Modes [5884-5894]:**
When tantra arises, the three kayas' nature as one must teach. The manner:
- Dharmakaya: meaning nature by blessing teaches
- Sambhogakaya: naturally clear pure by differentiation teaches
- Nirmanakaya: that itself word arrangement good, six melodies' aspect teaches

**Word Nature [5890-5901]:**
These words too from hearer's vijnana, no sound or letter in meaning. Like echo, no letters. Citation from *Rgyud bla ma*: "Like sound-image's sound, arising from others' vijnana, without conceptualization, without fabrication, thus Tathagata's speech."

**Three Location Types [5902-5934]:**
1. **Dharmakaya location**: Great dharmadhatu palace, teacher Samantabhadra, retinue ocean of wisdom, dharma nature Dzogchen, time transcending word dharmatā, without words teaches.

2. **Sambhogakaya location**: Pure dense array, teacher Vairochana Sambhogakaya, retinue five Rigpa Buddhas, five Yum, Sattvas, Semma, self-appearing mandala filling space, dharma Mahayana unsurpassed varieties, six self-sounds' melody, not spoken by tongue yet understood, time of self-appearing wisdom.

3. **Nirmanakaya location**: Tushita, etc., teacher Vajradhara Vajrasattva wisdom-maya kaya, retinue world-transcending fortunate guides, Bodhisattvas, siddhas, wisdom dakinis, worldly gods, humans, asuras, nagas, etc., dharma sutra-tantra inconceivable, time from infinite years to hundred years teaches.
