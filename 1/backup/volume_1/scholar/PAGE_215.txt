[8815-8840] [STRUCTURE] Four Empowerments: Ripening Signs Example

This section presents the example (dpe) of ripening signs (smin pa'i rtags) to illustrate the four empowerments through the analogy of seed growth. The structure moves from agricultural metaphor to spiritual maturation, establishing the natural law (rang bzhin) of empowerment effectiveness.

[8815-8832] [PHILOLOGY] Agricultural and Ripening Terminology

The text employs metaphorical vocabulary:
- "Zhing sa" (field ground): Suitable vessel
- "Sa bon" (seed): Empowerment potential
- "Skyon med" (without fault): Unobstructed capacity
- "Btab pa" (planted): Bestowed, deposited
- "Smin pa" (ripened): Matured, fructified

The particle "ni" marks metaphor: "dpe na zhing sa bzang po la sa bon skyon med btab pas 'bras bu smin pa ltar" (for example, just as a faultless seed planted in good field ground ripens as fruit). The comparative "ltar" establishes analogy.

[8833-8858] [CONTEXT] Agricultural Metaphor in Dharma

The seed-field-fruit metaphor derives from:
- Early Buddhist texts: Karma as seed, mind as field
- Yogacara: Alaya-vijnana as ground, bijas as seeds
- Tantra: Dbang as seed, practice as cultivation
- Nyingma: Natural fruition without effort

The metaphor establishes:
- Field (zhing): Disciple's capacity
- Seed (sa bon): Empowerment blessing
- Cultivation (skyed): Post-empowerment practice
- Fruit ('bras bu): Realization attainment

[8859-8884] [CONCEPT] Four Stages of Ripening

The four empowerments as ripening stages:
1. Spros bcas: Sa bon btab (seed planted)
   - Initial empowerment
   - Potential deposited
   - Foundation established

2. Spros med: Myu gu 'thons (sprout emerged)
   - Inner sign of growth
   - Practice indicators appear
   - Confidence develops

3. Shin tu spros med: Me tog shar (flower bloomed)
   - Qualities manifest
   - Signs of realization visible
   - Near to fruition

4. Rab tu spros med: Sku bzhi nges pa'i 'bras bu smin (four kaya fruit ripened)
   - Complete realization
   - Definitive attainment
   - Natural perfection

[STRUCTURE] Self-nature Divisions of Four Empowerments

[8885-8910] [PHILOLOGY] Self-nature and Power Terminology

The text employs intrinsic vocabulary:
- "Rang bzhin" (own nature): Intrinsic character
- "Nus pa" (power/capacity): Functional ability
- "Rnam gzhag" (arrangement): Systematic presentation
- "Sbyor ba" (application): Engagement, union
- "Dag pa" (purification): Cleansing, clearing

The particle "ni" marks arrangement: "dang po sprul bcas kyi nus pa'i rnam gzhag ni" (first, the arrangement of elaborated empowerment's power). The emphatic "ni" establishes focus.

[8911-8936] [CONTEXT] Four-fold Self-nature Analysis

Each empowerment's self-nature (rang bzhin):
1. Spros bcas:
   - Lus lha ru dag (body purified as deity)
   - Ngag sngags su dag (speech purified as mantra)
   - Yid ting 'dzin du dag (mind purified as samadhi)
   - Sems chos nyid du dag (mind purified as dharmata)

2. Spros med:
   - Snang ba phyi rol don 'khrul pa stongs (outer appearances' delusion ceases)
   - 'Phrin las bzhi la sbyor (engages four activities)
   - Bde gsal stong gsum myong (experiences bliss-clarity-emptiness)
   - Zung 'jug gi nus pa (union power)

3. Shin tu spros med:
   - 'Phrin las bzhi la sbyor (four activities)
   - Beyond ordinary perception

4. Rab tu spros med:
   - Bde ba (bliss), gsal ba (clarity), mi rtog pa (non-conceptuality)
   - Zung 'jug gi nus pa (union power)

[8937-8962] [CONCEPT] Progressive Purification

The self-nature reveals progressive purification:
1. Body-speech-mind-sems:
   - Coarse to subtle
   - External to internal
   - Constructed to natural

2. Appearance-activity-experience:
   - Snang ba (appearance): What appears purifies
   - 'Phrin las (activity): What is done purifies
   - Nyams (experience): What is felt purifies

3. Union power (zung 'jug gi nus pa):
   - Bde stong zung 'jug (bliss-emptiness union)
   - Gsal stong zung 'jug (clarity-emptiness union)
   - Rig stong zung 'jug (awareness-emptiness union)

[STRUCTURE] Elaborated Empowerment: Changes and Transformations

[8963-8988] [PHILOLOGY] Change and Transformation Terminology

The text employs process vocabulary:
- "'Gyur ba" (change): Transformation, alteration
- "Rtsi ba" (reckon/calculate): Determine, assess
- "Gnas pa" (abide): Stability, remaining
- "Nye bar rtogs pa" (near realization): Proximate understanding
- "Lus ngag yid sems" (body-speech-mind-mind): Four aspects

The particle "ni" marks assessment: "gnyis pa sprul med kyi dbang bzhi'i 'gyur ba rtsi ba ni" (second, calculating the changes of four unelaborated empowerments). The emphatic "ni" establishes topic.

[8989-9014] [CONTEXT] Four Changes in Each Empowerment

The four changes (bsgyur ba bzhi) in each empowerment:
1. 'Jug pa (entry): Initial engagement
2. Thob pa (attainment): Achievement gained
3. Gnas pa (abiding): Stable establishment
4. Nye bar rtogs pa (near realization): Proximate to full understanding

These correspond to:
- Four reliances (rton pa bzhi)
- Four stages of arhatship
- Four levels of bodhisattva grounds

[9015-9040] [CONCEPT] Transformation as Maturation

The changes represent maturation:
1. 'Jug pa: Initiation
   - Entering the path
   - Beginning transformation
   - New orientation

2. Thob pa: Attainment
   - Gaining stability
   - Establishing qualities
   - Consolidating gains

3. Gnas pa: Abiding
   - Remaining stable
   - Not regressing
   - Continuous development

4. Nye bar rtogs pa: Near realization
   - Close to completion
   - Almost fully matured
   - Ready for fruition

**Summary:**

Page 215 presents the ripening signs example, self-nature divisions, and changes/transformation analysis of four empowerments. Philologically, the text employs agricultural metaphor vocabulary, intrinsic terminology, and process vocabulary for change. Contextual sources include early Buddhist seed-field metaphors, Yogacara bija theory, and tantric empowerment traditions. Conceptually, the section demonstrates four stages of ripening through seed-flower-fruit analogy, progressive purification from body to awareness, and four changes as maturation markers—all illustrating empowerment as natural unfoldment toward spontaneous perfection.
