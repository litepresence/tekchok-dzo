[11607-11646] [STRUCTURE] Impure World-System Cosmogony
The section presents the arising of impure samsara: (1) from outer container five elements maṇḍala—earth, water, fire, wind, space great element (11607-11612); (2) from that, inexpressible grasping mind and six afflictions (desire, anger, delusion, pride, jealousy, aversion) (11613-11619); (3) from that arise six classes of beings (11620); (4) affliction-realm correspondences—jealousy→humans, aversion→gods, pride→demigods, desire→hungry ghosts, delusion→animals, black anger→hell (11621-11626); (5) thus six-class appearance arises, that is samsara's place (11627-11628); (6) from one great mode of abiding arise like four appearance-modes; (7) from four modes of abiding arise like four appearance-means; (8) four great appearances itemized—spontaneous presence as manifold; sambhogakāya with sense organs as magical light-body; emanation body as form-appearance; sentient beings as separate appearance (11631-11635); (9) to sentient beings, obscuration by appearance-means; (10) summary—from cloudless sky of primordial purity, through eight doors of spontaneous presence arise sambhogakāya wisdom-appearance; (11) from its capacity in directions, from immeasurable five-family appearance, natural emanation body appears, showing below six-class fields with Teacher—three-body appearance stacked is ground spontaneous presence appearance (11638-11643); (12) sambhogakāya appearing to self-face, taming beings natural emanation Buddhas, are capacity of self ground-appearance, not existing externally now, abiding together with self-knowing because self-knowing appearance (11644-11646); (13) self-appearance six-class appearance also not elsewhere, self-arisen from unceasing impure samsara door manner of arising.

[11607-11646] [PHILOLOGY] Affliction-Realm Mapping
The six afflictions mapped to realms: 'dod chags (desire) → mi dwags (hungry ghosts); zhe sdang (anger) → dmyal ba (hell); gti mug (delusion) → byol song (animals); nga rgyal (pride) → lha ma yin (demigods); phrag dog (jealousy) → mi (humans); khong khro (aversion) → lha (gods). The modifier "gnag pa" (black) intensifies anger. The term "thun mong mthun pa'i 'jig rten" (common concordant world) indicates collective/shared reality. "Snang thabs" (appearance-means) indicates the method/modality of appearing. "Sum brtsegs" (stacked/three-tiered) describes the structure of three bodies.

[11607-11646] [CONTEXT] Psychological Cosmology
The affliction-realm mapping presents a psychological cosmology: realms are not external locations but projected states of consciousness. Each realm corresponds to a dominant mental affliction that colors experience. This is standard in Vajrayāna (particularly the Guhyagarbha-tantra) but Longchenpa presents it systematically. The "common world" (thun mong 'jig rten) is the shared projection from collective karma; individual experience varies based on personal karma within that shared field.

[11607-11646] [CONCEPT] Appearance-Means as Obscuration
The phrase "snang thabs kyis sgrib pa" (obscuration by appearance-means) indicates that obscuration is not the appearance itself but HOW it appears—the "means" or modality of appearing. When ground-appearance is recognized as self-display, the means is wisdom; when not recognized, the means is obscuration. This is a subtle point: there is no "separate" obscuration, only unrecognized appearance. The appearance itself is neutral; recognition vs. nonrecognition determines its quality.

[11647-11663] [STRUCTURE] Common vs. Individual Appearance Analysis
The section presents a crucial distinction: (1) though appearing to each self; (2) common world-aspect arranged by common karma and Teacher's activity; (3) aspect appearing as confusion arranged as individual self-appearance samsara door; (4) self-appearance reverses when casket shifts (dies); (5) common remains projected to others; (6) distinguishing these two is extremely important; (7) naturally, from awareness's spontaneous presence door six-class appearance exists—key point is letting confused appearance like dream reverse to nonappearance in primordial purity; (8) in bardo, two aspects explained regarding benefit through self-appearance emanation in self-face six-class; (9) if known before impure door arises, benefit not accomplished (no object); (10) must accomplish after arising (must empty confused appearance to liberate); (11) this key point is subtle but very important.

[11647-11663] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Distinctions
The key distinction: "thun mong mthun pa'i 'jig rten gyi cha" (common concordant world-aspect) vs. "rang la snang rung 'khrul par snang ba'i cha" (individual confused appearance). "Spyi mthun gyi las" (common karma). "Ston pa'i mdzad pas bkod" (arranged by Teacher's activity—cosmic creative act). "Rang snang 'khor ba'i sgos bkod" (individually arranged samsara). "Spubs 'pho dus" (casket-shifting time—death). "Rang log" (self-reversal/return). "'Khrul snang rmi lam 'dra ba" (confused appearance like dream). "Ka dag gi sa la snang med du rang log" (self-reverse to appearance-nonexistence in primordial purity ground). "Bar do" (intermediate state). "Ma dag pa 'khor ba'i sgo ma shar ba'i gong du" (before impure samsara door arises). "'Khrul snang ma stongs na grol bar mi nus" (cannot liberate without emptying confused appearance).

[11647-11663] [CONTEXT] Death and the Bardo
The "casket shifting" (spubs 'pho) refers to death—the moment when the "jewel casket" (ga'u) of the body is abandoned. At death: (1) individual self-appearance reverses (rang log)—personal projections dissolve; (2) common world remains projected to others (those still living). The bardo (bar do) is the intermediate state between death and rebirth when self-appearance can still be recognized. The key teaching: recognition must occur BEFORE complete manifestation of impure samsara (rebirth) for liberation; after manifestation, one must work to "empty" confused appearance through practice.

[11647-11663] [CONCEPT] Dream as Paradigm for Confused Appearance
The simile "confused appearance like dream" ('khrul snang rmi lam 'dra ba) is central to Dzogchen soteriology: (1) dreams appear real to the dreamer but are mind's display; (2) confusion appears real to the confused but is ground's display; (3) upon waking, dream dissolves naturally; (4) upon recognition, confusion dissolves naturally; (5) the dreamer doesn't destroy the dream but recognizes it as dream; (6) the practitioner doesn't destroy appearance but recognizes it as display. The instruction "let it reverse to appearance-nonexistence" indicates non-grasping rather than destruction.
