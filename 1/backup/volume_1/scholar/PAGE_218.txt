[8915-8940] [STRUCTURE] Yid and Sems: Distinction of Mental Functions

This section presents the crucial distinction between yid (intellect) and sems (mind) in the context of consciousness and empowerment. The structure establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding how purification operates on different levels of mental function.

[8915-8930] [PHILOLOGY] Mental Function Terminology

The text employs psychological vocabulary:
- "Yid" (intellect): Discursive, analytical mind
- "Sems" (mind): Basic consciousness, alaya
- "Kun gzhi rnam par shes pa" (all-base consciousness): Storehouse consciousness
- "Sgo lnga" (five gates): Five sense doors
- "Yul" (object): Perceptual target

The particle "ni" marks definition: "sems ni kun gzhi rnam par shes pa" (mind is all-base consciousness). The equative "ni" establishes identity.

[8931-8956] [CONTEXT] Yogacara and Dzogchen Integration

The yid/sems distinction derives from:
- Yogacara: Eight consciousnesses (rnam shes brgyad)
- Alaya-vijnana: Storehouse of impressions
- Manas: Afflicted consciousness
- Dzogchen: Rig pa vs kun gzhi

Distinction:
- Sems (kun gzhi rnam shes pa): Holds all impressions, neutral
- Yid: Analyzes, discriminates, conceptualizes
- Yid investigates objects; sems stores traces

[8957-8982] [CONCEPT] Two-level Purification

The distinction enables two-level purification:
1. Sems level:
   - Kun gzhi rnam shes pa dag pa
   - Purification of storehouse
   - Removal of bag chags (latencies)

2. Yid level:
   - Discursive thought purification
   - Conceptual framework release
   - Analytical function transformation

This corresponds to:
- Bag chags (latencies): Sems level
- Rtog pa (thoughts): Yid level

[STRUCTURE] Sixteen Divisions of Self-nature

[8983-9008] [PHILOLOGY] Multiplicative Enumeration

The text employs mathematical vocabulary:
- "Bzhi" (four): Base number
- "Bcu drug" (sixteen): Four times four
- "Rang ngo'i dbye ba" (self-nature divisions): Intrinsic classification
- "Rang ngo" (self-face): Own nature

The particle "ni" marks calculation: "rang ngo'i dbye ba re re la phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs bzhi bzhi ste bcu drug tu yod do" (each self-nature division having four [each]—outer, inner, secret, perfect—exists as sixteen). The emphatic "do" confirms existence.

[9009-9034] [CONTEXT] Recursive Tantric Classification

The sixteen divisions follow tantric recursive logic:
- 4 empowerments (dbang bzhi)
- x 4 aspects each (phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs)
- = 16 divisions (bcu drug)

This structure:
- Ensures exhaustive coverage
- Mirrors mandala architecture
- Corresponds to bodhisattva grounds

[9035-9060] [CONCEPT] Exhaustive Classification Framework

The sixteen divisions provide:
1. Complete coverage:
   - Every empowerment has all four aspects
   - No gaps in presentation
   - Total systematicity

2. Hierarchical organization:
   - Outer within each
   - Inner within each
   - Secret within each
   - Perfect within each

3. Practical application:
   - Progressive practice path
   - Gradual maturation
   - Complete realization

[STRUCTURE] Three-fold Manifestation Divisions

[9061-9086] [PHILOLOGY] Manifestation and Purification Terminology

The text employs extensive vocabulary:
- "Rnam 'phrul" (manifestation): Display, emanation
- "Dag byed" (purifier): Agent of purification
- "Dag rgyu" (purification cause): Cause of cleansing
- "'Gyur dang bcas" (with transformation): Including change
- "Bstan pa" (show/teach): Presentation, instruction

The particle "ni" marks enumeration: "gsum pa rnam par 'phrul pa'i dbye bas shin tu rgyas par spro ba la gsum ste" (third, the manifestation divisions' very extensive elaboration is three). The enumerative "ste" establishes count.

[9087-9112] [CONTEXT] Three Manifestation Topics

The three manifestation divisions:
1. Dbang so so'i dag byed kyi dbye bas dag rgyu bcu drug 'gyur dang bcas pa bstan pa
   - Individual empowerment purifiers' divisions showing sixteen-fold purification causes with transformation

2. Lus kyi bya ba la brten nas nges pa'i dbye bas dbang gi gnas lugs bstan pa
   - Body activity reliance definitive division showing empowerment's natural state

3. Grangs kyi dbye ba la brten nas las dang nyon mongs pa'i dag byed bstan pa
   - Number division reliance showing karma and affliction purifiers

[9113-9138] [CONCEPT] Comprehensive Purification Framework

The three topics cover:
1. Empowerment-specific purification:
   - Each empowerment has specific purifier
   - Sixteen total purifiers
   - Corresponding to sixteen divisions

2. Body-activity-based purification:
   - Lus (body) as basis
   - Bya ba (activity) as method
   - Gnas lugs (natural state) as result

3. Numerical purification:
   - Enumeration as structure
   - Las (karma) purification
   - Nyong mongs (affliction) purification

**Summary:**

Page 218 presents the yid/sems distinction, sixteen divisions of self-nature, and three-fold manifestation divisions. Philologically, the text employs psychological vocabulary for mental functions, mathematical enumeration, and extensive manifestation terminology. Contextual sources include Yogacara eight consciousnesses, tantric recursive logic, and systematic purification frameworks. Conceptually, the section demonstrates two-level purification through yid/sems distinction, exhaustive 16-fold classification through 4x4 recursion, and comprehensive three-topic framework covering empowerment-specific, body-activity-based, and numerical purification—all representing empowerment as complete systematic coverage of all aspects of being.
