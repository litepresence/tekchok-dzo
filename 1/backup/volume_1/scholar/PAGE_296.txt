[12288-12330] [STRUCTURE] Three Non-Recognitions and Four Conditions Detailed
This section presents three non-recognitions (ma rig pa gsum) and four conditions: (1) Causal non-recognition (rgyu bdag nyid gcig pa'i ma rig pa, 12277-12280) - slight non-recognition of self-face without subject-object arising, like nameless becoming named; (2) simultaneously-arisen non-recognition (lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig pa, 12281) - co-emergent subject-object without recognition, producing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa appearances; (3) imputed non-recognition (kun brtags pa'i ma rig pa, 12282-12286) - conceptual imputation creating name-meaning grasping. Four conditions: (a) causal condition (rgyu'i rkyen, 12284-12285) - combining three non-recognitions, like body with limbs; (b) observed condition (dmigs pa'i rkyen, 12286-12287) - like mirror with face; (c) dominant condition (bdag po'i rkyen, 12289-12294) - light-awareness-dharmatā appearing as three; (d) immediately antecedent condition (de ma thag pa'i rkyen, 12295-12297) - simultaneity producing actual delusion. Concludes with *Thal 'gyur* citation (12313-12324).

[12288-12330] [PHILOLOGY] Non-Recognition Types and Condition Syntax
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Enumerative gsum (three) with types: rgyu bdag nyid gcig pa'i ma rig (single-nature causal non-recognition), lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig (simultaneously-arisen), kun brtags pa'i ma rig (imputed); (2) Particle tsam (merely) qualifying initial non-recognition: rang ngo ma rig pa'i cha tsam las (from mere non-recognition of own-face, 12278), ngo ma shes tsam (mere non-recognition, 12281), gnyis snang tsam du (merely dual appearance, 12282); (3) Simile lta bu: ming med ming du song ba lta bu (like nameless becoming named, 12280), skyes bu gzugs dang yan lag dang ldan pa la byad rang chas su 'byung ba lta bu (like person with body/limbs generating byad-appearance, 12285), me long dang 'dra bar (like mirror, 12286); (4) Compound gnyis snang (dual appearance) marks threshold of delusion; (5) Causative 'dus pas (by combining, 12284) marks condition-combination; (6) *Thal 'gyur* citation: 'khor ba rnams kyi thog ma ni (saṃsāra's beginning), mi 'byed byas med rang bzhin las (from undivided unfabricated nature), dmigs par 'dzin pa'i yul shar te (grasped-object appears), rtog 'dzin las ni tha dad snang (grasping-concept distinguishes appearances), dmigs 'dzin 'brel pa bcu gnyis su (subject-object relation in twelve ways), 'khor ba'i thog ma nyid du'o (this is saṃsāra's beginning itself), ma rig gsum gyis 'khrul tshul te (three non-recognitions' delusion mode), brgyud cing 'byed med rtsa ba ste (continuous indivisible root), rang ngo yin par ma shes pas (not knowing it is own-face), 'di yang 'khor ba'i thog ma'o (this too is saṃsāra's beginning).

[12288-12330] [CONTEXT] Threefold Avidyā and Pratyaya Theory
The passage draws on: (1) Indian Buddhist threefold avidyā adapted to Dzogchen: ātmāśrayāvidyā (self-basis non-recognition) - subtle failure without duality, saha-jāvidyā (co-emergent non-recognition) - arising with appearance, parikalpita-avidyā (imputed non-recognition) - conceptual construction; (2) Four conditions (pratyaya) from Abhidharma and Yogācāra: hetu, adhipati, ālambana, samanantara; (3) *Thal 'gyur* (Prasāda) tantra citation provides Atiyoga authority for twelve links as elaboration of non-recognition; (4) Twelve links (rten 'brel bcu gnyis, 12325) identified as beginning with non-recognitions; (5) "Like body with limbs generating byad-appearance" (12285) - standard analogy for condition-combination; (6) "Like mirror, face, and self" (12287-12294) - extended mirror metaphor for observed and dominant conditions.

[12288-12330] [CONCEPT] Delusion's Cascade from Subtle to Gross
The philosophical framework: (1) Causal non-recognition is seed - slight failure without subject-object: "not deluded by object but deluded" (don gyis ma 'khrul zhes bya ba de 'khrul par song, 12279); (2) Simultaneously-arisen non-recognition is sprout - co-emergent subject-object producing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa appearances ('khor 'das gnyis kyi snang char byung ba, 12281); (3) Imputed non-recognition is full plant - mind dividing appearance into name-meaning-grasping; (4) Four conditions as environmental factors: causal combines three non-recognitions, observed projects external object, dominant grasps self as possessor of light-awareness-dharmatā, immediately antecedent's simultaneity produces actual delusion; (5) Saṃsāra's beginning ('khor ba'i thog ma, 12312) - entire process occurs instantaneously (skad cig ma dang po la 'khrul lo, 12311); (6) Three non-recognitions are continuous indivisible root (brgyud cing 'byed med rtsa ba); (7) Not knowing it is own-face (rang ngo yin par ma shes pas) - the fundamental error.
