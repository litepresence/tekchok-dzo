[2350-2355] [CONCEPT] Nihilist Extremes
**Analysis:**

**Severance Views (*chad lta*):**

The text enumerates extreme nihilist positions:

1. **Cause Severed** (*rgyu chad*):
   - Mind cannot be held as entity
   - Like space, suddenly cut

2. **Result Severed** (*'bras bu chad*):
   - Life-force and lordship nonexistent
   - Primordial wisdom severed
   - Buddha nonexistent

3. **Path Severed** (*lam chad*):
   - Withered, nothing exists
   - Abiding upon path, effect definitely severed

4. **Complete Emptiness Severance** (*stong pa chen po*):
   - Cause and effect nonexistent
   - Emptiness completely severed
   - You are severed, I am severed
   - Therefore nothing exists

**Critique:** These positions represent the extreme of nihilism, denying even the conventional validity of karma and its effects.
