[1293-1294] [PHILOLOGY] Classification Summary: Asuras
**Analysis:**

**Reclassification:** The demon class (*bdud ris*) is included in the god class (*lha ris su bsdus nas*), leaving only four titan classes (*lha min ris bzhi*).

**Doxographical Note:** This reflects the standard Buddhist classification where asuras can be counted as either:
- A separate sixth realm (making seven total)
- Part of the god realm (maintaining six realms)
- Part of the animal or preta realms in some traditions

**Lifespan Reference:** The Thirty-three gods' lifespan is used as the comparative standard.

[1295-1302] [CONTEXT] The Origin of Humanity on Jambudvīpa
**Analysis:**

**Setting:** *'dzam bu'i gling bsod nams khyad par can gyi sa pa* — The excellent merit ground of Jambu continent

**First Humans:** Two god-sons from clear light (*'od gsal las lha'i bu gnyis*) born miraculously (*rdzus skyes*) from lotuses.

**Names:**
- *nyi ma rab tu snang byed* — Sun Greatly-Illuminating
- *zla ba dri med* — Moon Stainless

**Arising Process:**
1. After formation of beings up to Four Great Kings
2. Two god-sons fall from clear light to Jambudvīpa
3. Upon immeasurable lotuses of beautiful light-appearance
4. Their minds greatly moved (*yid rab tu g.yos pa*)
5. Space-seed parts manifest as condition
6. Miraculous birth god-sons expand

**Dzogchen Connection:** This narrative parallels Dzogchen cosmogony where beings arise from the clear light nature of mind (*'od gsal*) through spontaneous display.

[1303-1309] [CONCEPT] The Golden Age: Primordial Human Abilities
**Analysis:**

**Extraordinary Powers of Primordial Humans:**

1. **Transportation:** 
   - Go through sky when traveling
   - Sit in sky when dwelling
   - *'gro na yang nam mkha' la 'gro* / *'dug na yang nam mkha' la 'dug*

2. **Nourishment:**
   - Food is meditation (*bsam gtan*)
   - Dwell in joy-bliss (*dga' bde la spyod*)

3. **Radiance:**
   - Body extends immeasurable light rays (*'od zer gyi tshogs dpag tu med pa 'phro*)

4. **Teletransportation:**
   - Arrive wherever merely thought (*gang du bsam pa der phyin*)

5. **Lifespan:**
   - Immeasurable years (*tshe lo yang dpag med thub*)

6. **Purity:**
   - No afflictions manifestly move (*nyon mongs pa mngon du rgyu gang yang med pa*)

**Philosophical Significance:** This "golden age" description represents humanity in its primordial purity before the decline into coarse material existence—analogous to the Dzogchen concept of primordial purity (*ka dag*).

[1310-1315] [CONTEXT] Resolving Variant Accounts
**Analysis:**

**Variant Sources:**
- Some tantras (*rgyud 'ga' las*) say humans expanded from Joy Possess (*dga' ldan*)
- Some (*la la nas*) say from Four Great Kings (*rgyal chen bzhi*)

**Longchenpa's Resolution:**
- The two first chiefs (*thogs ma'i gtso bo de gnyis*) fell from clear light
- Below them, [beings fell from] Joy Possess, Four Great Kings, and other upper [realms]
- All miraculously born here (*'dir rdzus te skyes pa*)

**Hermeneutical Principle:** All views are non-contradictory (*thams cad kyi ltar 'gal ba med par*) because beings fell from multiple upper realms at different times.

[1316-1319] [PHILOLOGY] The Name: Joy Possess Pile (*dga' ldan brtsegs pa*)
**Analysis:**

**Place Name:** *dga' ldan brtsegs pa* (Tuṣita Pile/Mound)

**Etymological Explanation:**
- *snang ba 'od kyi longs spyod bsam gyis mi khyab pa* — Inconceivable light-appearance enjoyment
- *rig pa ting nge 'dzin gyi dga' bde dpag tu med pa* — Immeasurable awareness-concentration joy-bliss

**Grammar Note:** *brtsegs pa* (pile/mound/accumulation) indicates abundance and layered excellence.

**Doxographical Connection:** This connects to the heaven called Tuṣita (*dga' ldan*) mentioned earlier, suggesting the first human realm mirrored the divine realm in its qualities.

[1320] [STRUCTURE] Introduction of the Teacher
**Analysis:**

**The Sixth Teacher:** *ston pa drug pa* — The sixth in the series of cosmic teachers

**Identity:** *rdo rje 'chang nyid* — Vajra Holder (Vajradhara) himself

**Function:** *'gro ba de dag 'dul ba* — Taming/disciplining those beings

**Buddhist Cosmology Context:** In Buddhist cosmology, there are typically "seven Buddhas of antiquity" or multiple teachers who appear in different world-cycles. Vajradhara as the sixth teacher represents the highest tantric enlightenment principle.

**Transition:** Having established the origin and golden age of humanity, Longchenpa will now describe the gradual decline into the present condition of human existence.
