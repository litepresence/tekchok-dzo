[8065-8143] [STRUCTURE] Wisdom Gnosis Empowerment Categories

[8065-8092] **Threefold Wisdom Gnosis Empowerment:**
From the tantra:
1. **Outer**: Sentient beings' appearances sent outward (*sems can snang ba phyi ltar bskur*)
2. **Inner**: Meditation, mind-holding inwardly (*sgom pa sems 'dzin nang ltar bskur*)
3. **Secret**: Recognition's twenty-one introductions (*ngo 'phrod nyi shu rtsa gcig*) matched to faculties, exemplified meaning and signs

Plus: Isolated awareness self-clear as five lights (*rig pa rkyang pa 'od lnga rang gsal*)
And: East-liberated, without frame, Great Perfection transcending acceptance/rejection/effort (*shar grol ris med rdzogs pa chen po spang blang bya rtsol las 'das*)

[8093-8143] **Accomplished Guru Distinction:**
Accomplished gurus can complete empowerment with single isolated piece or lump—whatever is said is accomplished.
Unaccomplished gurus must combine all and confer to accomplish meaning.

**Empowerment Four Classification:**
1. Vase empowerment (*bum dbang*): colored powder maṇḍala, deities, vase, student preparation, auspicious eight substances, royal seven, peaceful/wrathful *cakrā*/image/statue, vajra name, command sign (*bka' rtags*), seal empowerment (*phyag rgya*), action completion
2. Secret empowerment (*gsang dbang*): giving two bodhicittas
3. Wisdom-gnosis empowerment (*shes rab ye shes*): attachment-free seal visualization, merely recognizing seal, attachment-possessing actual consort activity
4. Word empowerment (*tshig dbang*): realization wisdom, view, meditation, awareness

[8144-8191] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of Consort Terms

**Rig pa (Awareness) Definitions:**
- Awareness wisdom directly recognized (*rig pa'i ye shes mngon sum du rig pas na rig pa*)

**Ma (Mother) Etymology:**
- Worldly: Nothing exists without depending on mother
- Dharmic: Like earth ground—no Buddha arises without depending on consort mother

**Alternative: Gzungs ma (Retention):**
- Mind's bliss retention depends on body
- Holding increases body retention

**Sky-like Mother:**
- Like space—no world-system exists without depending on space

**Phyag rgya ma (Seal):**
- *Phyag* = holding—from cyclic existence to Buddhahold
- *Rgya* = sealing—sealing cyclic existence with enlightenment
- *Ma* = sustenance—like food, without food, death; without seal consort, realization doesn't arise

**Five-fold Classification:**
1. Outer five (*phy'i rigs lnga*)
2. Inner five (*nang gi lnga*)
3. Secret five (*gsang ba'i lnga*)
4. Perfect two (*yongs rdzogs kyi gnyis*)
- Total: seventeen (*bchu bdun*)

[8192-8253] [CONTEXT] Consort Lineage Classifications

**Outer Lineages:**
- Royal lineage: Tathāgata family Buddhas
- Noble lineage: Vajra family
- Commoner lineage: Jewel family
- Brahmin: Lotus family
- Outcaste: Karma family Buddhas

Not that any single Buddha family suffices—all five lineages needed with corresponding consorts.

**Inner Lineages:**
- Yakṣa daughters
- Goddess daughters
- Nāga daughters
- Brahmā daughters
- Śakra daughters
These are karma mudrā lineages.

**Historical Example:**
Kośala master Śrī-heruka invoked Brahmā, Śakra, etc.'s daughters for empowerment and achieved siddhi.

**Secret Lineages:**
Fivefold classification (*rigs can lnga*):
1. Conch-bearing (*dung can ma*): black hair, good teeth, beautiful locks
2. Elephant-nose (*glang sna can ma*): bad hair, extra front teeth
3. Lotus (*padma can*): yellow hair, right spiral
4. Deer (*ri dwags can*): bad hair, large forehead prominence
5. Cow (*ba glang can ma*): beautiful hair, vertical forehead wrinkles

[8254-8296] [CONCEPT] Consort Functions and Wisdom

**Lotus-bearer Special Function:**
Produces superior bliss and serves as companion for clear dharmatā—like lotus blooming/non-blooming, main instruction is opening channel mouth.

**Deer Special Function:**
Thin channels entering like King Añjana's deer leg—channel-lengthening instruction essential.

**Elephant-nose Function:**
Like elephant trunk spiraling upward—summoning instruction essential.

**Cow Function:**
Channels latent in mind without sound—channel-taming instruction essential.

**Conch Function:**
Like right-spiraling conch—channel-squeezing instruction essential.

**Wisdom Results:**
All five produce five wisdoms' lineage holding.
For bliss path, Lotus-bearer surpasses all.

**Actual Bodhicitta:**
Women don't produce actual red bodhicitta (blocked by five lineages); men produce bindu through five lineages but not actual red bodhicitta—channel mouth doesn't change.

**Channel Functions:**
Channels flow upward—right nostril bleeds at youth's maturity, those without body element diseases.

**Lineage Accomplishments:**
- Deer: body enhancing activities
- Conch: speech enhancing
- Elephant-nose: mind enhancing
- Cow: consciousness enhancing
- Lotus: bliss body expanding

From *Dbang bkod chen po*:
"All women are five lineages—this arrangement is great bliss, yogins' siddhi completion."

**Perfect Lineages:**
1. Common siddhi-producing lineage (ordinary)
2. Supreme siddhi-producing lineage (ḍākinī sky-goer)

**Ordinary:**
- Wide eyes
- Right-spiraling hair
- Extra teeth on left
- Right view: ninth month
- Left view: bloated appearance
- Direct view: very straight

**Sky-goer:**
Large form, half-opened waist channels, good nose, beautiful brows, occasional harsh voice, gentle conduct, sweet speech, cow-like movement, heroic conduct, under thirty years.
