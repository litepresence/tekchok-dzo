[12227-12256] [STRUCTURE] Four Conditions of Delusion and Mirror Analogy
This section presents the four conditions (rkyen bzhi) producing delusion from non-recognition: (1) apprehending cognition arising from non-recognition's aspect ('dzin byed kyi shes pa ma rig pa'i cha las byung ba, 12228); (2) arising of slight delusion (breng tsam cig 'gyus pa las, 12228); (3) emergence of dualistic cognition: "Did I arise from father or father from me?" (pha gi las nga byung ngam/nga las pha gi byung snyam pa'i shes pa, 12229-12230); (4) non-recognition exists in mode/appearance, not basis (ma rig pa de gzhi la med de nyams sam rnam pa la yod do, 12231). Four conditions: (a) causal condition (rgyu'i rkyen, 12233-12234) - basis abiding like light in house, non-recognition itself; (b) dominant condition (bdag po'i rkyen, 12235) - going to analysis/investigation; (c) observed condition (dmigs pa'i rkyen, 12236-12237) - apprehending as object-possessor, like face in mirror; (d) immediately antecedent condition (de ma thag pa'i rkyen, 12238) - simultaneity of three.

[12227-12256] [PHILOLOGY] Conditional Terminology and Mirror Analogy
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Ablative las with arising: ma rig pa'i cha las byung (arising from non-recognition's aspect, 12228), 'gyus pa las (from stirring, 12228); (2) Dubitative ngam: nga byung ngam (did I arise); (3) Location markers: gzhi la med (not in basis), nyams sam rnam pa la yod (exists in mode or appearance, 12231); (4) Comparative ltar with mirror: dper na me long la skyes bu'i byad bstan pa lta bu'o (like face of person shown in mirror, 12237); (5) Enumerative dang bcas pa'i (endowed with) marking combinations; (6) *Bkra shis mdzes ldan* (Glorious Auspicious) citation (12245-12252): 'khrul (delude) with condition types; (7) Technical terms: dmigs pa can (having observed object), bdag po'i rkyen (dominant condition), rgyu'i rkyen (causal condition), de ma thag pa'i rkyen (immediately antecedent condition); (8) Four results from four conditions: various causes ('bras bu sna tshogs pa'i rgyur 'khrul, 12249), various names (ming sna tshogs su 'khrul, 12250), inexhaustible results ('bras bu la thug pa med par 'khrul, 12251), various appearances (snang ba sna tshogs su 'khrul, 12252).

[12227-12256] [CONTEXT] Pratyaya Theory and Dzogchen Adaptation
The passage integrates: (1) Standard Indian Buddhist pratyaya theory: hetu-pratyaya (rgyu'i rkyen) - cause as basis, adhipati-pratyaya (bdag po'i rkyen) - dominant/master condition, ālambana-pratyaya (dmigs pa'i rkyen) - observed/object condition, samanantara-pratyaya (de ma thag pa'i rkyen) - immediately antecedent condition; (2) Yogācāra and Sautrāntika epistemology developed these extensively; (3) Dzogchen adaptation to mechanics of non-recognition: basis as causal condition, analytical mind as dominant, object-apprehension as observed, their simultaneity as immediately antecedent; (4) Mirror-face analogy (me long zhal) - standard Indian and Tibetan pedagogical tool for explaining perception and error; (5) *Bkra shis mdzes ldan* (Glorious Auspicious) tantra citation provides authority for the condition-result correlations; (6) "Great delusion mode of secret mantra basis" (gsang sngags gzhi'i 'khrul lugs chen po, 12253) establishes Vajrayāna framework.

[12227-12256] [CONCEPT] Delusion as Conditioned Arising from Slight Error
The philosophical framework: (1) Delusion is conditioned arising (rkyen 'byung) - not inherent in basis but produced through specific conditions; (2) Causal cascade: slight stirring (breng tsam) → dualistic cognition (pha gi...nga) → full delusion; (3) Non-recognition exists in mode/appearance, not basis - preserving ground's purity; (4) Four conditions elaborated: from causal condition arise various causes, from dominant condition various names, from observed condition inexhaustible results, from immediately antecedent various appearances; (5) This is "great delusion mode of secret mantra basis" (gsang sngags gzhi'i 'khrul lugs chen po, 12253); (6) Appearance mode itself together with non-recognition's condition appears with self-just-as-it-is (rang ka ma, 12254); (7) Non-recognition collects root five afflictions and many conceptual heaps (rtsa ba'i nyon mongs pa lnga dang bcas te rtog tshogs du ma sdud pa, 12255); (8) With ten thousand conditions and appearance modes, manifestation becomes extensive ('byams pa, 12258).
