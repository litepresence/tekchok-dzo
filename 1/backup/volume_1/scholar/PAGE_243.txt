[9820-9835] [STRUCTURE] # Portents of Samaya Deterioration
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents a graduated typology of negative portents (*snga ltas*) that indicate samaya deterioration. The structure moves from general misfortune to specific physiological, environmental, and interpersonal signs.

**The Portent Categories:**
1. **General Misfortune** (9821)—Various forms of unhappiness
2. **Disease Manifestations** (9822-9823, 9829)—Epidemic, fever, leprosy, skin diseases
3. **Spirit Aggression** (9824-9826)—Malevolent spirits (*gdon*) and misleaders (*log 'dren*) causing death and hell-rebirth
4. **Sensory Impairment** (9827-9828)—Loss of sight and hearing, failed activities
5. **Social Calamity** (9830-9833)—Thieves, royal punishment, unusual plagues, death of children and spouse, lands becoming hostile
6. **Existential Futility** (9834)—Actions becoming meaningless

[9820] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *snga ltas*
**Analysis:** The term *snga ltas* (early signs/portents) combines:
- *snga* = early, before, prior (temporal precedence)
- *ltas* = sign, omen, portent (indicative phenomenon)

The genitive *nyams pa'i* (of deterioration) establishes these as signs belonging-to/samaya-transgression. The locative *su* marks the context: "in the case of/at the time of."

[9821-9824] [CONTEXT] The Buddhist Theory of Misfortune
**Analysis:** This enumeration reflects the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist understanding that spiritual transgression manifests in worldly misfortune. The sequence follows the *karma-vipāka* (action-ripening) framework:

- **Line 9821:** *mi bde rnam pa sna tshogs*—"Various forms of unhappiness"—the general category
- **Line 9822:** *yams dang 'tshe ba'i nad*—"Epidemic and harming diseases"—collective calamity
- **Line 9823:** *rims nad*—"Fever diseases"—specifically infectious disease
- **Line 9824:** *gdon dang log 'dren*—"Spirits and misleaders"—supernatural aggression

The particle *kyis* (instrumental) in line 9824 establishes agency: these spirits cause harm.

[9826] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of Hell Rebirth Formula
**Analysis:** *bsad nas sems can dmyal bar 'gro*—"Having been killed, go to hell"

- *bsad nas* = having been killed (past participle of *gsod*)
- *sems can* = sentient beings
- *dmyal bar* = to hell (dative/locative)
- *'gro* = go

This laconic formulation encapsulates the tantric warning: malevolent spirits kill the transgressor, who then takes rebirth in hell.

[9827-9829] [CONCEPT] Sensory Karmic Retribution
**Analysis:** The text establishes specific correspondences between samaya-transgression and sensory impairment:

- **Eye damage** (9827): *mig gis gzugs mi mthong*—"Eyes not see form"
  - Corresponds to failing to "see" the guru's nature
- **Ear damage** (9828): *rna ba 'on*—"Ears hearing"
  - *'on* (hearing) paired with *las mi 'grub* (actions not accomplished)
  - Corresponds to failing to "hear" the teachings properly
- **Skin disease** (9829): *mdze dang shu ba*—"Leprosy and itch"
  - Physical manifestation of "impurity"

[9830-9834] [CONTEXT] Social and Environmental Consequences
**Analysis:** The enumeration extends to the socio-political realm:

- **Line 9830:** *chom rkun rgyal po'i chad pa*—"Thieves and royal punishment"—breakdown of law and order
- **Line 9831:** *gzhan la med pa'i rims nad*—"Fevers non-existent to others"—unique/unusual plagues marking the individual
- **Line 9832:** *bu dang chung ma 'chi bar ston*—"Children and wife shown to die"—familial destruction
- **Line 9833:** *yul rnams thams cad dgrar ldang*—"All lands rise as enemies"—environmental hostility
- **Line 9834:** *byas pa don med*—"Done [actions] meaningless"—existential futility

The instrumental *zhing* (and) in 9833 connects the land-enmity with the meaninglessness.

[9836-9866] [STRUCTURE] # The Threefold Restoration (bskang thabs)
**Analysis:** Having established the consequences of transgression, Longchenpa presents the three methods of restoration corresponding to body, speech, and mind samayas.

**The Structure:**
1. Body samaya restoration (9837-9842)
2. Speech samaya restoration (9843-9850)
3. Mind samaya restoration (9851-9859)
4. General protection methods (9860-9866)

[9837-9842] [CONTEXT] Body Samaya Restoration
**Analysis:** The citation from *de nyid* (the same [text]) prescribes:

- **Line 9839:** *gsung rab rgya chen bklag pa*—"Reading extensive scriptures"
- **Line 9840:** *tshogs kyi 'khor lo rgya chen bskor*—"Extensively turning the gaṇacakra"
  - *tshogs kyi 'khor lo* = feast wheel/assembly circle (Skt. *gaṇacakra*)
  - The tantric communal feast gathering
- **Line 9841:** *'khor gsum yang dag bya*—"Correctly performing the three circles"
  - The three circles (*'khor gsum*) refer to:
    1. Offerer (the practitioner)
    2. Offered-to (the deities/guru)
    3. Offerings (substances)
  - "Correct" (*yang dag*) implies non-dual operation

[9843-9850] [CONTEXT] Speech Samaya Restoration
**Analysis:**

- **Line 9845:** *mar me brgya rtsa'i cho ga*—"Ritual of the hundred [butter] lamps"
  - *brgya rtsa* = "hundred base"—a standard complete number
  - Fire offering to purify speech-obscurations

- **Line 9846:** *spang skong brgya rtsa gdon pa*—"Reciting the hundred confessions and repairs"
  - *spang* = confession (of faults)
  - *skong* = repair, restoration
  - *gdon pa* = to recite, read aloud

- **Line 9850:** *spang skong ni na rag rgyun bshags so*—"Confession-repair is continuous confession of Naraka"
  - Identifies this practice as the *Narakāntaka* (Hell-ender) confession
  - *rgyun* = continuous, stream

[9851-9859] [CONTEXT] Mind Samaya Restoration
**Analysis:** The restoration of mind samaya focuses on guru-pleasure (*mnyes pa*):

- **Line 9853:** *slob dpon mnyes pa'i rdzas kyis mchod*—"Offering with substances pleasing to the teacher"
  - *rdzas* = substance, material
  - The instrumental *kyis* indicates the means of offering

- **Line 9854:** *'byor tshogs ci yod 'phags pa mchod*—"Whatever wealth-accumulation exists, offer to the noble ones"
  - *'byor tshogs* = gathered wealth, accumulated resources
  - *'phags pa* = noble ones (Skt. *ārya*)

- **Lines 9856-9858:** The results of proper restoration:
  - *bsam pa thams cad 'grub*—All intentions accomplished
  - *'dod pa thams cad skong*—All desires fulfilled
  - *bya ba thams cad rdzogs*—All actions completed

[9860-9866] [CONCEPT] Methods of Protection
**Analysis:** Prevention supersedes restoration:

- **Line 9861:** *skyon yon mthong nas*—"Having seen faults and qualities"
  - Discriminative awareness of what to abandon and adopt

- **Line 9861:** *dran pa dang shes bzhin dag pas rgyud sdom pa*—"Binding the continuum with pure mindfulness and awareness"
  - *dran pa* = mindfulness (Skt. *smṛti*)
  - *shes bzhin* = awareness (Skt. *saṃprajanya*)
  - *rgyud* = continuum (Skt. *saṃtāna*)
  - *sdom pa* = binding, vow, commitment

- **Line 9864:** *bskal pa zhig kyang mi gtong*—"Not abandoning [it] for even one aeon"
  - *bskal pa* = aeon (Skt. *kalpa*)
  - Emphasizes absolute commitment without temporal limit

[9867-9868] [PHILOLOGY] Teacher-Student Responsibility Distinction
**Analysis:** The text distinguishes protection responsibilities:

- **Teacher (9867):** *slob dpon gyis rgyud dang dam tshig gi rim pa shes pas zhes bcus bsrungs*—"The teacher protects through knowing the stages of continuum and samaya"
  - The instrumental *pas* marks knowledge as the means
  - *zhes bcus* (by ten) refers to the ten knowledges listed next

- **Student (9868):** *slob mas mi shes pas slob dpon gyi bka' bzhin bsrung*—"The student, not knowing, protects according to the teacher's command"
  - The causal *pas* (from not-knowing) establishes student-deference
  - *bka' bzhin* = according to command/instruction (Skt. *ājñā*)

[9869-9871] [STRUCTURE] Introduction to the Ten Knowledges
**Analysis:** The text transitions to enumerating the ten knowledges (*shes pa bcu*) required for samaya protection:

1. **Line 9870:** *tshig don gyi gnas shes pa*—"Knowing the places of word-meaning"
   - Hermeneutical competence: understanding what the teachings mean

2. **Line 9871:** *dris pa'i lan ldon par shes pa*—"Knowing how to expound answers to questions"
   - Pedagogical capacity: ability to clarify doubts

The text will continue enumerating the remaining eight knowledges on subsequent pages.
