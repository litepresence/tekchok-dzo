[2994-3048] [CONCEPT] Cittamatra Non-Dual Wisdom
**Analysis:**

**Holding Consciousness:**

The holding consciousness (*'dzin pa'i rnam shes*) arises from mind itself, not from external objects.

**Aspect-Consciousness Relation:**

When holding objects:
- Outer aspect consciousness (*phyi'i rnam pa'i rnam shes*) — the appearance
- Inner-holding consciousness (*nang 'dzin pa'i rnam shes*) — the apprehension

Both arise through beginningless latent tendencies.

**Self-Awareness Alone:**

*rang rig tsam las gzhan med par grub* — established merely as self-awareness, nothing else.

**Non-Dual Primordial Wisdom:**

*gnyis med ye shes* — non-dual wisdom is the stainless suchness (*dri ma med pa'i de bzhin nyid*).

**At Time of Remainder (*lhag ma'i dus*):**

- Slight stain of latent tendencies appears mistaken
- Taste, sickness, etc. exist conventionally
- When stain of mixed affliction and wisdom purified
- False part of affliction removed
- Pure wisdom of remainder manifests

**Pure Not Established as False:**

The pure is not merely false aspects and consciousness.

**Manifest Attachment:**

Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated in the small work of mind.

**Appearance as Reflection:**

Objects appear as various white and red aspects, like reflections.

Both measurer and measured non-existent, yet appearing.

[3049-3086] [CONTEXT] Illusion and Ultimate Truth
**Analysis:**

**Dream and Illusion:**

All phenomena like dream, like illusion (*rmi lam sgyu ma lta bu*).

All phenomena merely various objects and consciousness.

**Nirvana Attains Form-Body:**

Nirvana works benefit through form-body.

**Excellent Dharma:**

One's own self-aware suchness and supreme dharma-body.

**Autonomous Lower (*rang rgyud 'og ma*):**

Those who assert:
- Illusion as established reasoning (*sgyu ma grub pa'i rigs pa*)
- Appearance as merely illusion (*snang ba sgyu ma tsam*)
- Merely illusion — various divisions beyond measure

**Second Position:**

In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides.
- No objects or aspects
- Self-aware experience does not exist
- Like barren woman's son
- No meeting consciousness

**Conventional Truth Not True:**

Since conventional truth is not true, ultimate truth is non-abiding.
