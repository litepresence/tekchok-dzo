[13022-13065] [CONTEXT] Reversed Cause-Effect, Nyida Khasbyor, and Primordial Liberation
The passage integrates: (1) Reversed cause-effect (rgyu 'bras go log) - central Dzogchen concept that ordinary causal relations are inverted in recognition: result (awareness) is path, cause (effort) self-ceases; (2) Dependent origination reversal - instead of cause producing effect, recognition of effect (awareness) eliminates cause (delusion); (3) *Nyida Khasbyor* (Nyi zla kha sbyor, Union of Sun and Moon) - major Dzogchen tantra emphasizing self-liberation through recognition without effort; (4) Self-liberation metaphors: iron cutting iron, stone breaking stone - like cutting like, not different substance; (5) Self as own antidote (rang gi gnyen por rang) - not external remedy but recognition of nature; (6) Natural Great Perfection (rang bzhin rdzogs chen) - not achieved but recognized; (7) Naraka (na rag kan) - addressed in citation, even heinous sins liberated through familiarization; (8) Chapter conclusion marking transition to symbolic presentations (brda'i sgo).

[13022-13065] [CONCEPT] Atiyoga's Radical Reversal and Self-Liberation
The philosophical framework: (1) Radical reversal of causality: in ordinary path, cause (practice) produces effect (awakening); in Atiyoga, effect (awareness) is recognized as always present, causing cause (effort/delusion) to self-cease; (2) Non-action (ma byas pa) dawns instantaneously when effort released - not passivity but recognition of spontaneous presence; (3) Dependent origination forward progression (yar lugs) reversed (bzlog pas) - saṃsāra cut at root through recognition rather than transformed through practice; (4) Self-liberation structure: like iron cutting iron (same substance), like stone breaking stone (same nature) - awareness liberates awareness, not different entity acting on it; (5) Self as own antidote: no external remedy needed, recognition itself is liberation; (6) Without seeking (ma btsal), without meditation (ma bsgoms) - negating all deliberate practice; (7) Even heinous sins (mtshams med sdig) liberated through this familiarization - ultimate inclusivity of Dzogchen path; (8) Transition to symbolic door (brda'i sgo): having established direct pointing-out, now presenting through esoteric symbols.
