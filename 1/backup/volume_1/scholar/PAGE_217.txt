[8867-8896] [STRUCTURE] Completely Unelaborated: Definitive Divisions

This section presents the completely unelaborated empowerment (rab tu spros med) through its definitive divisions (nges pa'i dbye ba), establishing the ultimate level beyond all constructs through four-fold analysis of each change ('gyur ba).

[8867-8886] [PHILOLOGY] Ultimate Division and Freedom Terminology

The text employs ultimate vocabulary:
- "Rab tu spros med" (completely unelaborated): Beyond all constructs
- "Nges pa" (certainty): Definitive determination
- "Dbye ba" (division): Classification, distinction
- "Chags sdang rang grol" (attachment-aversion self-liberated): Natural freedom
- "Rang grol" (self-liberated): Spontaneous release

The particle "ni" marks definitiveness: "bzhi pa rab tu spros med kyi dbye ba nges pa ni" (fourth, the definitive division of completely unelaborated). The emphatic "ni" establishes certainty.

[8887-8912] [CONTEXT] Four Changes in Completely Unelaborated

The four changes at ultimate level:
1. Spros bcas level:
   - Sems gang yin la sogs pas chags sdang rang grol
   - Whatever mind is, attachment-aversion self-liberated

2. Spros med level:
   - Sprul sku'i zhing bstan pas phung po khams skye mched stongs
   - Showing nirmanakaya fields, aggregates-elements-sense bases empty

3. Shin tu spros med level:
   - Longs sku'i zhing bstan pas sems nyid 'gro 'ong med pa'i don rtogs
   - Showing sambhogakaya fields, realize mind itself without coming-going

4. Rab tu spros med level:
   - Chos skur lung bstan pas 'khor 'das la zhen pa'i shes sgrib phra mo sbyong
   - Prophesy dharmakaya, purify subtle knowledge obscuration of attachment to samsara-nirvana

[8913-8938] [CONCEPT] Self-liberation at Ultimate Level

The completely unelaborated reveals:
1. Chags sdang rang grol:
   - Attachment and aversion
   - Not rejected
   - Self-liberated upon arising

2. Three kaya fields:
   - Sprul sku: Activity dimension
   - Longs sku: Enjoyment dimension
   - Chos sku: Truth dimension

3. Subtle obscurations:
   - Shes sgrib phra mo (subtle knowledge obscuration)
   - 'Khor 'das la zhen pa (attachment to samsara-nirvana)
   - Completely purified

[STRUCTURE] Self-nature Divisions: Extensive Explanation

[8939-8964] [PHILOLOGY] Self-nature and Division Terminology

The text employs intrinsic vocabulary:
- "Rang ngo" (self-face): Own nature, identity
- "Dbye ba" (division): Classification
- "Rgyas par bshad" (extensive explanation): Detailed presentation
- "Dbang bzhi" (four empowerments): Complete set
- "Spros bcas" (elaborated): With constructs

The particle "ni" marks topic: "gnyis pa rang ngo'i dbye ba rgyas par bshad pa la dbang bzhi las" (second, to the extensive explanation of self-nature divisions from four empowerments). The emphatic "ni" establishes focus.

[8965-8990] [CONTEXT] Four-fold Self-nature Structure

Each empowerment's self-nature divided into four:
1. Spros bcas rang ngo:
   - Spros bcas kyi spros bcas: Dam bsre, mna' chu, etc.
   - Phyi (outer)
   - Spros bcas kyi spros med: Dkyil 'khor du gzhug, lha ngo bstan, ming gi dbang
   - Nang (inner)

2. Spros bcas kyi shin tu spros med:
   - Nyan thos sdom pa nas rim dgu rdzogs
   - Gsang ba (secret)

3. Spros bcas kyi rab tu spros med:
   - Bum pa nges pa'i skur rgyu
   - Yongs rdzogs (perfect)

[8991-9016] [CONCEPT] Recursive Four-fold Structure

The self-nature divisions reveal:
1. Each empowerment contains four aspects:
   - Phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs
   - Outer, inner, secret, perfect

2. Each aspect has specific content:
   - Phyi: External rituals
   - Nang: Internal processes
   - Gsang: Secret realizations
   - Yongs rdzogs: Perfect integration

3. Complete enumeration:
   - 4 empowerments x 4 aspects = 16 divisions
   - Plus subdivisions
   - Exhaustive presentation

[STRUCTURE] Elaborated Self-nature: Outer Dimension

[9017-9042] [PHILOLOGY] Ritual and Commitment Terminology

The text employs ritual vocabulary:
- "Dam bsre" (samaya mixing): Commitment exchange
- "Mna' chu" (oath water): Bond water
- "Blud pa" (pour): Administer
- "Sogs pa" (etcetera): And so forth
- "Phyi" (outer): External dimension

The particle "ni" marks classification: "spros bcas kyi spros bcas dam bsre zhing mna' chu blud pa la sogs pa ste phyi'o" (elaborated's elaborated: samaya mixing, oath water pouring, etc.—outer). The emphatic "o" confirms classification.

[9043-9068] [CONTEXT] Outer Ritual Components

The outer dimension (phyi) includes:
1. Dam bsre (samaya mixing):
   - Exchange of commitments
   - Mutual pledge
   - Binding agreement

2. Mna' chu blud pa (pouring oath water):
   - Ritual libation
   - Binding substance
   - Witness offering

3. La sogs pa (and so forth):
   - So shing brims pa (tooth-stick distribution)
   - Dkyil 'khor bshams pa (mandala arrangement)
   - Other preparatory rituals

[9069-9094] [CONCEPT] Outer as Foundation

The outer dimension serves as:
1. Foundation for inner:
   - External creates conditions
   - Internal actualizes essence
   - Progressive deepening

2. Commitment establishment:
   - Dam tshig (samaya) binding
   - Mna' (oath) solemnization
   - Future conduct guidance

3. Ritual technology:
   - Structured approach
   - Observable actions
   - Measurable progress

**Summary:**

Page 217 presents the completely unelaborated definitive divisions, self-nature divisions with extensive explanation, and elaborated self-nature outer dimension. Philologically, the text employs ultimate vocabulary for complete unelaboration, intrinsic terminology for self-nature, and ritual vocabulary for outer dimension. Contextual sources include three kaya doctrine, four empowerment structures, and standard tantric ritual taxonomy. Conceptually, the section demonstrates self-liberation at ultimate level without rejection, recursive four-fold structure with 16+ divisions, and outer dimension as foundation for progressive interiorization—all representing empowerment as exhaustive classification leading to spontaneous recognition beyond classification.
