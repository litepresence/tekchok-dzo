[17286-17302] [CONCEPT] Simile (*mthun dpe*) and Section Completion:
The simile is like tinder (*spra ba*)—whatever object is seen is known and realized, all afflictions burned. The butter-lamp fire blazes.

Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17290-17295) and *sdud pa* (17296-17299):
- Example like tinder moisture-free
- Fire sparks subtle even meet
- Tinder all blaze fire burning
- Wisdom burns latencies
- These all wisdom lamp
- Wisdom dharmas' nature completely knowing
- Three realms mother-free truly transcends

[17300-17306] [STRUCTURE] # Major Rim Khang: Four Lamps Classification
**Analysis:** Longchenpa concludes the thirteenth major section (*rim khang bcu gsum pa*): The Classification of the Four Lamps. The text marks this as the conclusion (*ste*) of the four-lamps presentation and prepares to transition to the second major division: establishing the nature of knowing supported by that body.

The transition formula (*de ltar...de ni*) marks the structural shift from supporting base (*rten*) to supported cognition (*brten pa shes pa*).

[17303-17306] [STRUCTURE] # Second Major Division: Supported Cognition
**Analysis:** The three topics of establishing the nature of knowing supported by that body:
1. Alaya (*kun gzhi*) and dharmakaya (*chos sku*) distinction
2. Mind (*sems*) and wisdom (*ye shes*) distinction
3. Distinct dharmas analysis

[17307-17313] [CONCEPT] First Topic: Alaya-Dharmakaya Distinction
Brief presentation (*mdor bstan pa*):
- Sentient beings' basis and buddhas' basis considered: rigpa's essence ka dag stainless
- Stained with marigpa (*ma rig pa*), conceptualization (*rtog tshogs*)—becomes all delusion-appearance, delusion-holder's basis
- Thus alaya and dharmakaya two aspects

The *thal 'gyur* citation (17315-17316): "Alaya and dharmakaya's vital point."

[17317-17334] [CONCEPT] Alaya (*kun gzhi*) defined:
- Made distinct by ignorance (*ma rig pas khyad par du byas pa*)
- Mind and mental factors' first support, middle abode, final home
- Latencies' vessel, like a pond (*rdzing*)

Dharmakaya (*chos sku*) defined:
- Made distinct by ignorance reversed (*ma rig pa log pas*)
- Beyond mind and mental factors' objects
- Pure from all action and latencies

Alaya:
- Under-barrel spread basis of various appearances
- Various objects appear in lung
- Object-possessors, six ignorance, three realms essence appear
- That body, happiness-suffering, mind's delusion parts many held

Dharmakaya:
- All these nonexistent
- Not abiding together with mind etc.

The *rang shar* citation (17335-17339):
- Alaya conceptualization holder
- Various delusion knowing stained
- Alaya ignorance entity is
- Alaya called that

And (17341-17343):
- Sentient being basis and buddha basis
- One distinction divided certainly

[17344-17360] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig phreng ba*:
- Alaya accumulation's cause
- Dharmakaya outflow exhausted
- Empty clear and clear pervading
- Contemplation unstained memory-clear
- Elaboration itself free
- Sky-like pervading empty
- Self-pure all free
- Cause and condition with alaya
- Latencies etc. like pond
- Dharmakaya latencies free
- Mind and sems etc. gathering
- Embodied alaya various appears
- Dharmakaya mind etc. free
- Various form-appearance body nonexistent

[17361-17374] [CONTEXT] Citation from *kun tu bzang po klong drug pa'i rgyud*:
- Hey mahasattva
- Mind's abode is alaya
- Why? Alaya gathers all contemplation objects, known as mind
- Ye shes's abode is dharmakaya
- Why? Dharmakaya lacks all memory-conceptualization, no different-object-holding knowing

---

**Summary:** Page 407 completes the fourth lamp with its simile, concludes the four-lamps section, and inaugurates the second major division on supported cognition. The alaya-dharmakaya distinction establishes the fundamental ground for understanding samsara-nirvana differentiation.
