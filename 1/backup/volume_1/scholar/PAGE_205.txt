[8507-8546] [STRUCTURE] Sequential Generation and Causative Syllables

This section presents the sequential generation (rim gyis bskyed pa) of vajra through three syllables (yi ge gsum) and their causative effects on body, speech, and mind. The structure follows the Guhyasamaja archetype of three-vajra generation progressing from root to tip of the subtle body vajra.

[8507-8526] [PHILOLOGY] Causative Morphology and Instrumental Particles

The text employs systematic causative constructions:
- "Bskyed pa" (causes to arise): From skyed (to grow/develop)
- "Byas pa" (causes to become): Causative of 'gyur
- "Sbyar ba" (causes to join): Causative of 'phrod

The instrumental chain: "om gyis rdo rjer bskyed pa ni" (by means of OM, vajra is produced). The particle "gyis" marks the agentive instrument, while "ni" emphasizes the result. The construction "byas pas" indicates completed action with consequence.

[8527-8546] [CONTEXT] Guhyasamaja Tantra and Three Vajra Architecture

The syllable generation follows Guhyasamaja (gsang ba 'dus pa) structure:
- OM: Sku rdo rje (vajra body) - purification of sku'i las (body karma)
- AH: Gsung rdo rje (vajra speech) - purification of gsung gi las (speech karma)
- HUM: Thugs rdo rje (vajra mind) - purification of thugs kyi las (mind karma)

This corresponds to the gsang ba gsum (three secrets) doctrine and the threefold purification into rdo rje gsum (three vajras). The Thalgyur citation "sku gsung thugs kyi rdo rje che" confirms Nyingma integration of this Sarma system.

[8547-8566] [CONCEPT] Three-fold Bliss and Kaya Correspondence

The three syllable locations generate corresponding bliss types:
1. Rtsa ba (root/base): Chos sku'i bde ba (dharmakaya bliss)
   - Generated by OM
   - Primordial purity (ka dag) aspect
   - Non-conceptual (mi rtog) realization

2. Rked pa (waist): Longs sku'i bde ba (sambhogakaya bliss)
   - Generated by AH
   - Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) aspect
   - Self-arising (rang byung) bliss

3. Rtsa mo (tip): Sprul sku'i bde ba (nirmanakaya bliss)
   - Generated by HUM
   - Compassion (thugs rje) aspect
   - Pervasive (khyab brdal) activity

[STRUCTURE] Four Mudras and Liberation Through Bliss

[8567-8590] [PHILOLOGY] Mudra Classification and Liberation Particles

The four mudras employ technical classification vocabulary:
- "Las kyi phyag rgya" (action mudra): Karma family engagement
- "Dam tshig gi phyag rgya" (samaya mudra): Commitment seal
- "Chos kyi phyag rgya" (dharma mudra): Phenomenal seal
- "Phyag rgya chen po" (great mudra): Mahamudra realization

The liberative construction "las grol" (liberated from bonds) employs las as ablative: "lus ngag yid gsum gyi 'ching byed las grol" (liberated from binding of body, speech, and mind). The emphatic "ni" marks definition: "rang grol phyag rgya chen po zhes bya'o" (this is called self-liberated great mudra).

[8591-8614] [CONTEXT] Hevajra and Cakrasamvara Integration

The mudra system derives from:
- Hevajra Tantra: Karma mudra (las kyi phyag rgya) as entry point
- Cakrasamvara: Integration with six yogas
- Thalgyur citation: "sku gsung thugs kyi rdo rje che / rgya gsum ldan pa'i padma'i dbus"

The progression mirrors the dbang bzhi (four empowerments): vase, secret, wisdom-knowledge, and word.

[8615-8638] [CONCEPT] Progressive Realization Through Mudras

Each mudra generates specific capacity:
1. Las kyi phyag rgya: 'Phrin las bzhi (four activities) without obstruction
   - Generated by external thigle release
   - Corresponds to sprul sku activity

2. Dam tshig gi phyag rgya: Dri med ye shes bzhi (four stainless wisdoms)
   - Generated by waist-level practice
   - Samaya without separation ('du 'bral med pa)

3. Chos kyi phyag rgya: Chos spyi and rang mtshan engagement
   - Generated by tip-level experience
   - Universal and particular phenomena

4. Phyag rgya chen po: Bde stong zung 'jug (bliss-emptiness union)
   - Non-abiding (mi gnas pa) realization
   - Beyond method and wisdom duality

[STRUCTURE] Thigle Refinement and Release Indicators

[8639-8668] [PHILOLOGY] Perfective Aspect and Resultative Constructions

The text employs perfective markers:
- "Sbyangs pa" (having refined): Completed action
- "'Byongs pa" (having released): Perfective aspect
- "Thob pa" (attained): Resultative achievement

The construction "sbyangs pas...'byung" (having refined...arises) establishes causation. The particle "ni" marks attainment: "nang du sems 'byongs te" (mind is released internally).

[8669-8696] [CONTEXT] Signs of Accomplishment (Dngos Gyi Rtogs)

The indicators of successful thigle release include:
- External: Skra dkar (white hair) and gnyer ma (wrinkles) absent
- Internal: Rnam rtog nub pa (cessation of conceptuality)
- Secret: Bde ba lhun grub (spontaneously present bliss)

These correspond to the three kayas:
- External: Sprul sku (emanation body) sign
- Internal: Longs sku (enjoyment body) sign
- Secret: Chos sku (truth body) sign

[8697-8728] [CONCEPT] Three-fold Release System

The complete release operates through three dimensions:
1. Phyir 'byongs (external release): Body signs
   - Indestructible thigle manifestation
   - No ordinary appearance (dngos po mthong ba med pa)

2. Nang du sems 'byongs (internal release): Mind signs
   - Conceptuality ceases (rnam rtog nub pa)
   - Karma and latencies exhausted (las dang bag chags stongs pa)

3. Lus kyis sems 'chings (body-mind binding): Integrated signs
   - Three-fold simultaneous occurrence
   - Sku gsum bdag tu med pa'i lta ba (view of three kayas without self)

**Summary:**

Page 205 presents the three-syllable generation of vajra body-speech-mind, the four mudras system, and the three-fold thigle release with its indicators. Philologically, the text employs systematic causative constructions, perfective aspect markers, and resultative particles. Contextual sources include Guhyasamaja Tantra, Hevajra, Cakrasamvara, and Thalgyur root text. Conceptually, the section demonstrates how syllable generation creates three-vajra architecture, how mudra practice progresses from action to non-dual realization, and how thigle refinement generates external, internal, and secret signs of accomplishment corresponding to the three kayas.
