[17088-17122] [PHILOLOGY] Etymological analysis of *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*:
- *shes rab* (wisdom/prajñā): From *nang du rang gnas lhun grub kyi dgongs pa shes dus* (when knowing the self-abiding spontaneous intent within)
- *rang byung* (self-arising): Not found by seeking, obtained from self; arising without cessation; wisdom knows dharmas clearly
- *rab* (supreme): Intent difficult to realize by others, obtained from self without searching, supreme peak
- *rang* (self): Jewel existing primordially in self found
- *byung* (arisen): Self-arisen without cessation
- *sgron ma* (lamp): Dharmas clearly known
- *ma* (mother/suffix): Self-appearance self-face known, pervading knowing

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17098-17115) provides extensive analysis:
- Knowing entity and non-entity
- All appearance greatly entered
- General meaning knowing
- Unsought placed confidence obtained
- Self ye shes measures known
- Nature pure dharmakaya
- Unobtained by three, self-known
- Superior appearing greatly
- Others' analysis place nonexistent
- Self-arisen primordially pure object
- Not others' object, called self
- Without doing, this meaning not obtained
- Without hope for anyone
- Primordially self-arisen called arisen
- Lamp dharmata all
- Nondual appearance makes
- Ma: self-face pervading knowing

[17116-17122] [CONTEXT] Citation from *mu tig phreng ba*:
"Example like butter-lamp / Knowing all dharmas instantaneously / Supreme becomes all's peak / Self other-dependency dharma free / Arisen unblocked freely appears."

This establishes the butter-lamp (*sgron me*) simile for wisdom's illuminating function.

[17123-17157] [CONCEPT] Fivefold classification (*dbye ba*) of Self-Arising Wisdom:
1. *gzhi gnas rang byung gi shes rab* (Ground-abiding self-arising wisdom): Rigpa's knowing aspect, arising basis and support
2. *snang ba cer 'dzin gyi shes rab* (Appearance-directly-holding wisdom): Sphere-awareness nondual union, self-time self-clear, stainless purity, intent delivers to dharmata
3. *dran pa 'gag med kyi shes rab* (Memory-unceasing wisdom): Arising marks none, yet arising, liberated self-face dharmata unified gathering
4. *so sor rtog pa'i shes rab* (Individually-discriminating wisdom): Dharma and dharma-possessor, self and general marks, characteristics, etc., unmixed appearance knowing
5. *'jug byed rnam gsum gyi shes rab* (Three-entrance wisdom): In natural bardo, hearing establishes, thinking decides, meditation tastes experience, definitely extracts from samsara, word-meaning realized

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17140-17157) authenticates:
- Classification fivefold
- Ground-abiding self-arising wisdom makes body etc. dharmas' supports
- Appearance-holding wisdom holds sphere-awareness union
- Unceasing memory wisdom gathers one-pointed knowing objects
- Individually-discriminating wisdom discriminates general and self marks
- Three-entrance wisdom establishes in natural bardo

[17158-17163] [CONTEXT] Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*):
The characteristic is knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and dharmas gathered by object-awareness rigpa as natureless.

Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17156-17159) and *sdud pa* (17160-17163):
- Appearing and non-appearing all dharmas / natureless who knows / this is that characteristic
- Dharmas natureless transformed / this called prajñāpāramitā supreme

[17164-17178] [CONCEPT] Door of arising (*'char byed kyi sgo*):
The five faculties (*dbang po lnga*) are the door because sense-faculties measure objects as wisdom, that being the door.

Particularly, nose memory wisdom wind (*shes rab kyi rta me rlung*) moving is that itself. Fire-wind wisdom's resound like fire sparks, night-time yawn occurring, arises thus known.

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17169-17178):
- Arising door five faculties
- Particularly from nose arises
- That sign night time
- Yawn and fierce yawn
- Very fierce yawn body time
- Red resounding light rays
- Like fire sparks spreading
- That measure and sign
- Arising door recognized

---

**Summary:** Page 405 provides the definition, fivefold classification, characteristic, and door of the fourth lamp. The analysis reveals self-arising wisdom as the self-recognized knowing that integrates all prior lamps through nondual sphere-awareness union.
