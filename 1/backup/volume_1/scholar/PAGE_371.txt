[00001-00005] [STRUCTURE] Enumeration of the Four Auspicious Conditions
**Analysis:** The passage opens with a four-fold enumeration (bsdus pa) listing bsod nams (merit), longs spyod (resources/provisions), dbang thang (power/sovereignty), and dar rgud (prosperity/decline). This structural device establishes the soteriological calculus framework wherein the practitioner masters elemental prognostication ('byung ba rtsis sbyor). The progression from positive to bipolar (dar rgud) conditions mirrors the tantric integration of cyclic existence patterns.

[00006-00016] [CONTEXT] Integration of Four Seasonal Cycles with Three Vajras
**Analysis:** The text correlates the four seasonal wheels ('khor lo bzhi dus) with the three vajras (lus, ngag, yid) plus sems, creating a four-fold correspondential system. Spring (dpyid/skyed byed) correlates with body and its 'khrul 'khor, summer (dbyar/dran pa) with speech, autumn (ston/ro rnams) with mind, and winter (dgun/rtse mo) with consciousness. This framework derives from rDzogs chen physiological cosmology, where seasonal elemental shifts mirror subtle body transformations. The "one taste" (tha mi dad par) instruction indicates non-dual integration of these dimensions.

[00017-00020] [PHILOLOGY] Correspondence of Seed Syllables to Four Dharmatā States
**Analysis:** The passage establishes a technical correspondence between seed syllables and consciousness states: (1) ཨ (A) at skyed byed's hub correlates with the diversity-emptying dharmatā state; (2) ཨཾ (AM) at dran pa correlates with dharmatā abiding; (3) ཧཱུྃ (HUM) at ro rnams correlates with dream-state dharmatā; (4) ཧ (HA) at rtse mo's hub correlates with samādhi dharmatā. The syllable selection follows tantric phonological symbolism—A represents unborn dharmatā, HUM represents vajra mind. The term gnas pa (abiding state) is used technically to denote specific modal configurations of chos nyid.

[00021-00024] [CONCEPT] The Four Stages of Yoga Concealment Practice
**Analysis:** This passage presents the four progressive concealments (sba ba) of the sbyor so bzhi: (1) rtog pa tha dad pa sba ba—concealing conceptual diversity by mixing with 'gyu ba rlung; (2) gti mug dran med du sba—concealing ignorance in non-memory; (3) bag chags snga phyi rang dag tu sba—concealing former/latter karmic traces in self-purification; (4) dga' bde 'dzin med rang grol du sbas pa—concealing bliss in non-grasping self-liberation. These stages represent the severing (rgyun chad pa) of the six destinies' karma and traces, corresponding to advanced phyag rgya chen po practices of self-liberation without renunciation.

[00025-00043] [STRUCTURE] Delineation of Dependent Wind Categories
**Analysis:** This section initiates the second major topic (don gnyis pa) on wind-dependence classifications, citing the *Thal 'gyur* text as scriptural authority. Two primary wind categories are enumerated: 'gyu ba chen mo'i rlung (major mobile wind) at 21,600 movements, and 'gyu ba chung ba'i rlung (minor mobile wind) at 112,600 movements. The passage provides a detailed philological analysis of wind enumeration terminology: khri (10,000), 'bum (100,000), stong (1,000), brgya (100). The functional classification (byed las) into ascending (gyen la rgyu) and descending (thur du sel) movements reflects the fundamental prāṇa/apāna polarity in subtle body energetics. The gnad (crucial point) instruction indicates practical meditative application.

[00040-00043] [PHILOLOGY] Enumeration of Wind Counts and Functions
**Analysis:** The text specifies: major wind = 21,600 movements (nyi khri chig stong drug brgyad), minor wind = 112,600 movements ('bum gcig dang khri gnyis stong drug dang brgya drug). The byed las (function) is twofold: upward movement (gyen la rgyu) and downward elimination (thur du sel). The technical term 'gyu ba is polysemous, referring both to "movement" and to the specific vital wind classification. The passage anticipates subsequent discussion of nad (illness), gdon (spirit obstacles), and tshe yi dus (life-span timing), establishing the prognostic dimension of wind calculation.
