[18321-18360] [STRUCTURE] # Synthesis: Ground, Path, and Fruition
**Analysis:** Longchenpa synthesizes the distinct dharmas into the three-stage structure of Dzogchen presentation:

**Ground (*gzhi*):**
- Alaya and dharmakaya as basis
- Primordial purity and spontaneous accomplishment
- Four lamps as ground-display
- Self-arising wisdom as ground-nature

**Path (*lam*):**
- Vision (*snang ba*): Recognizing ground-display
- Familiarization (*goms pa*): Stabilizing recognition
- Measure (*tshad*): Progress indicators
- Signs (*rtags*): Accomplishment markers

**Fruition ('bras bu*):**
- Exhaustion (*zad pa*): Phenomena exhausted in dharmata
- Liberation (*grol ba*): Self-liberated in own place
- Buddhahood (*sangs rgyas*): Recognition complete
- Three kayas: Fruition display

[18361-18400] [CONCEPT] Integration of All Topics:
The synthesis integrates the volume's major topics:
1. Body basis (*lus kyi rten*): Channels, winds, bindus
2. Cognition nature (*shes pa'i rang bzhin*): Mind and ye shes
3. Four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*): Visionary progression
4. Three kayas (*sku gsum*): Fruition display
5. Alaya-dharmakaya (*kun gzhi chos sku*): Samsara-nirvana basis

[18401-18440] [PHILOLOGY] Synthesis terminology:
- *rtogs pa* (realization): Ground recognized
- *sgom pa* (familiarization): Path stabilization
- *grub pa* (accomplishment): Fruition attained
- *snang stong* (appearance-emptiness): View integration
- *grol gsum* (three liberations): Path method
- *sku gsum* (three kayas): Fruition form

[18441-18480] [CONTEXT] Citations from *rang shar* on synthesis:
The text cites extensively on the integrated nature:
- Ground as it is, path thus
- Fruition not sought elsewhere
- Self-arisen, self-liberated
- Dharmata spontaneously perfect
- Buddha in own face

[18481-18520] [CONCEPT] Relationship to Other Vehicles:
The synthesis distinguishes Dzogchen from other vehicles:
- **Sutra**: Gradual, cause-based, conceptual
- **Tantra**: Transformation, method-based, symbolic
- **Dzogchen**: Direct, self-arisen, beyond cause-result

Dzogchen transcends yet includes:
- Sutra's emptiness
- Tantra's luminosity
- Direct recognition (*ngo sprod*)

---

**Summary:** Page 416 provides the synthetic integration of ground-path-fruition, correlating all major topics into a coherent system. The synthesis establishes Dzogchen as the culmination of Buddhist vehicles while maintaining its distinctive direct approach.
