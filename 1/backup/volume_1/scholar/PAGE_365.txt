[15183] [CONTEXT] Source Citation
**Analysis:** Standard citation formula "yang de nyid las" - again from that very [text], indicating continuation from the same source material (rtsa gnas rin po che'i 'khor lo).

[15184-15186] [STRUCTURE] External Limbs of the Bliss Cakra
**Analysis:** Introduction of external channels (phyi yi yan lag) associated with the bliss cakra (bde ba'i 'khor lo). The rim pa (stages/sequences) of the cakra correlate with external stages (phyir rol rim pa), establishing an isomorphism between internal cakra architecture and external body geography.

[15207-15237] [STRUCTURE] Sequential Cakra Rim Channel Mapping
**Analysis:** Systematic mapping by cakra rims/rings:
1. First rim (mu khyud): Line 15207-15212 - Great channels (rtsa chen) dividing to right/left shoulder bumps (ltag pa'i 'bur), bee-like forms (sbrang bu tre la), 10 gathering channels ('dus pa'i rtsa) each
2. Left side channels (line 15213-15217): "phyi dril lta bu" - like outer scroll/cover, one channel each near appropriate sides (ldan pa'i phyogs), 10 each
3. Third rim (line 15218-15225): Ant-wheel-like channels (grog mo'i 'khor), three action channels (las byed rtsa), golden needle-like (gser gyi khab) channels at forehead center (dpral ba dkyil), 10 branches
4. Right/left of cakra (line 15226-15243): Two appearing channels ('char te) with grasping flow ('dzin byed rgyu), white-black border of eye (tsakshu lta byed dkar nag mtshams), one each side; right side has beautiful lotus (padma mdzes pa) and white silk thread (dar dkar snal ma), 5 each; left side has vajra-like (rdo rje lta bu) and hook-like (lcags kyu lta bu), 5 each; center has two pearl-like (mu tig lta bu) channels, 5 each

**Analysis:** 
- Line 15244-15249: Fourth cakra channels: finger-like (lag sor lta bu) channels at eye sockets (mig gi phugs), fish-eye-like (nya mo lta bu), red color blazing with light rays ('od zer 'bar), 10 each
- Line 15250-15254: Moon-like (zla ba lta bu) channels from front/back of cakra, emerging at two peaks (rtse ltag gnyis), white pure light rays, 10 each
- Line 15255-15260: Sun-eye-like (nya mig lta bu) great channels from cakra corners (mtshams), coiling form, one each at right/left nose-eye socket, 5 each
- Line 15261-15263: Fifth rim illusion-like (sgyu ma lta bu) great coiling channel (rnam par 'khyil ba'i sdong po)

[15264] [PHILOLOGY] Channel Structural Description
**Analysis:** 
- "kha ni sdong po gnyis su ldan" - mouth endowed with two stems/branches
- "gcig ni padma lta bu" - one lotus-like
- Located on tongue (lce yi steng na), two each (gnyis gnyis)

[15265-15287] [CONCEPT] Five Elements and Channel Functions
**Analysis:**
- Line 15271-15275: Hollow moon of channels (rtsa yi stong zla) with three-fold petals ('dab ma ldan pa gsum), black color hook-form (lcags kyu'i dbyibs), three twisted (sgril ma), 10 each
- Line 15276-15281: These channel forms are methods of arising ('byung ba'i thabs) and essential causes (gnad kyi rgyu). Practitioner should understand five each of: wind (rlung), bindu gathering (thig le 'du), essential point (gnad), consciousness-mount (shes pa'i rta), essence (dngas ma)
- Line 15282-15289: Fourfold classification of wind, bile, phlegm, gathering; desire, delusion, anger; each with three characteristics (mtshan nyid gsum gsum): object (yul), measure (dud tshod), location (gnas), and engagement ('jug byed)
- Line 15290-15310: Two types of wind: wisdom wind (ye shes rlung) and karma wind (las rlung); hot and cold; wisdom wind has four types; bindu also twofold (karma cause and wisdom); wisdom has two (wind sound and light cause); gathering twofold (warm and cold); consciousness-mount similar; gathering through mind and prajñā; essence twofold (blood, serum, flesh, light, wind color)
