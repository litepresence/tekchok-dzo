[16344-16350] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of verse structure:
The particle *ste* (16344) functions as continuative, suspending meaning across the line break — a formal marker of verse (*tshig bcad*) style. The phrase *dbyings rigs 'dres pas* (space-race mixed) employs *rigs* (race/type) in the tantric sense of "aspect" or "category," not ethnic or biological race.

[16344-16350] [CONTEXT] The term *ma* (mother) here operates within the Nyingma *thod rgal* technical vocabulary: the "mother" is the supporting base (*rten gzhi*) for all sense powers, not a procreative metaphor. The *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*) citation establishes this as scriptural authority for the terminology.

[16351-16367] [STRUCTURE] # Threefold Classification of the Water Lamp
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes a tripartite typology (*dbye ba rnam pa gsum*):

1. **'Byung ba 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags** — Element-gathered Far-Casting Snare
   - Arises from the essence of wind (*rlung gi dngas ma*)
   - Root is like ram-horn (*ba men gyi rwa*)

2. **Ye shes 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags** — Pristine-awareness-gathered Far-Casting Snare
   - Holds the colors of pristine awareness
   - Does not hold deluded appearances

3. **Dbang po 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags** — Sense-power-gathered Far-Casting Snare
   - The essence of the five sense powers in the center of the eye's "a-berry"
   - Produces the power-support clarity as what sees forms
   - Does not see pristine awareness appearances

[16355-16359] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of *dbang po'i dngas ma mig gi a 'bras dkyil na*:
The term *a 'bras* (a-berry) is a technical anatomical term in Tibetan medical and tantric literature, referring to the crystalline structure within the eye. The genitive chain (*dbang po'i dngas ma mig gi a 'bras*) creates a nested structure: "the essence of the sense powers [within] the eye's a-berry."

[16356-16360] [CONCEPT] The distinction between *chos can* and *chos nyid*:
Longchenpa asserts that the actual (*dngos*) Water Lamp is the second category (pristine-awareness-gathered), while the other two function merely as supporting conditions (*rten byed pa'i cha nas*). This reflects the Dzogchen distinction between the apparent phenomenon (*chos can*) and the definitive nature (*chos nyid*).

The phrase *'di shes pa gal che'o* (16360) — "knowing this is extremely important" — is an emphatic pedagogical marker typical of Longchenpa's autocommentary style.

[16361-16367] [CONTEXT] Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The tantric citation confirms the threefold classification using parallel structure:
- *'byung ba'i dngas ma rang 'dus pa'i rgyang zhag chu yi sgron ma*
- *ye shes 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags*
- *dbang po 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags*

[16368-16373] [STRUCTURE] # Characteristics Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa distinguishes:
- General characteristic (*spy'i mtshan nyid*): produces capable form-appearance as object-appearance
- Own characteristics (*rang gi mtshan nyid*): threefold corresponding to the three classifications

[16371-16373] [CONCEPT] The three own characteristics:
1. **Element-gathered**: Abides in the aspect of gathering, holding, and expanding appearance
2. **Pristine-awareness-gathered**: Holds the self-appearance of light-clarity clearly
3. **Sense-power-gathered**: Holds appearance, appearance-object, and eye-consciousness self-knowing

[16374-16379] [PHILOLOGY] Distinction between *snang ba* and *snang yul*:
Longchenpa clarifies the technical terminology:
- *Snang ba*: initially appears as object — placed as mountains, etc.
- *Snang yul*: object's own characteristics — rocks, etc.
- *Snang ba shes pa*: consciousness free of thought, aspect of sign-names
- *Snang yul*: object self-characterized, inert abiding, etc.

This distinction reflects the standard Sautrāntika-Yogācāra epistemological framework adapted for *thod rgal* context.
