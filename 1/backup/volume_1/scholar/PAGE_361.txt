[14927-14929] [STRUCTURE] Completion of Throat Cakra Analysis and Transition to External Channels
**Analysis:** This section completes the analysis of the five wisdom goddesses (lha mo lnga) associated with the throat cakra, identifying them as the five purified winds (rlung lnga dag pa) coiled within the wisdom space (ye shes dbyings). The text then transitions via structural marker "གཉིས་པ་" (second) to a new topic: detailed explanation of external channels (phyi rtsa'i 'dam ma so sor bshad pa), sourcing from "དེ་ལས་" (from that [text]).

[14930-14942] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology of Throat Cakra Channels
**Analysis:** The passage introduces technical terminology for channels (rtsa) at the throat cakra (mgrin pa 'khor lo):
- Line 14934: "me stag lta bu" - like fire/spark, describing the anterior-posterior channels
- Line 14936: "dar lce" - silk/streamer, referring to wind-agitated channels
- Line 14939: "ye shes 'od" - wisdom light; "khrag dngas" - blood essence
- Line 14940: "long kha" - possibly "klung kha" (wind channel) or related to spatial expanse
- Particle analysis: Extensive use of locative particles (la, na) and instrumental (gis) to establish spatial relationships and agency.

[14943-14964] [STRUCTURE] Enumeration of External Channel Divisions
**Analysis:** Systematic architectural mapping of the saṃbhoga-cakra (longs spyod 'khor lo) channels:
1. Right/left sides (g.yas g.yon): "sing 'bru" (kapāla-like) channels → shoulders (dpung pa'i mgo)
2. Four spokes (rtsibs bzhi): "dung phor" (conch-vessel) channels → cheeks (sog pa) and ears (me long)
3. Remaining petals ('dab ma): "chu yi thigs pa" (water drops) channels
4. Shoulder centers (byin gzhug dkyil): single channels on each side
5. Lower shoulder petals: "phur pa" (dagger) channels at shoulder centers
6. Remaining petals: "nyi zer" (sun rays) channels at shoulder corners (dpung zur)
Each location follows a consistent enumerative pattern with numerical precision (gnyis gnyis, re re).

[14965-14966] [CONTEXT] Citation Formula
**Analysis:** Standard Tibetan citation closure "ཞེས་སོ་" (zhes so) marking the end of the quoted passage. Transition via "གསུམ་པ་" (third) introduces the next section on detailed essential points (gnad bye brag tu bshad pa).

[14967-14972] [PHILOLOGY] The Sabhāta Cakra Structure
**Analysis:** Introduction of "ས་བྷ་ཏ་" (sa b+ha ta, Skt. sabhāta/sabhāva) cakra:
- "'dab ma bcu drug" - sixteen petals, standard configuration for throat cakra in tantric physiology
- "'gyu ba'i rlung" - moving winds
- "thig le'i rten" - support/bindu for thig le
- "shes pa'i zungs" - the pair/union of consciousness (wisdom and consciousness dichotomy)
The terminology bridges medical (rtsa rlung) and yogic (thig le, ye shes) discourses.

[14973-14983] [CONCEPT] Taxonomy of Channel-Wind-Bindu Relationships
**Analysis:** Sophisticated classification system organizing channels by their functional capacities:
1. "gtem du rung ba'i rtsa bzhi" - four channels suitable for piercing/cutting (bloodletting)
   - Contain "bskyil du rung ba'i rlung bzhi" - four winds suitable for drawing up
   - Support "thub pa'i thig le bzhi" - four firm/stable bindus
2. "ma gtems 'chor ba'i rtsa bzhi" - four channels that bleed without piercing
   - Contain "rnam par shes pa'i rlung bzhi" - four consciousness winds
   - Support "sdud pa'i thig le bzhi" - four gathering/bindu
3. "cha mnyam rtsa bzhi" - four equal channels
   - Contain "'khu ldog med pa'i rlung bzhi" - four winds without reversal
   - Support "gsang ba'i thig le bzhi" - four secret bindus
This establishes a tripartite classification (pierceable/non-pierceable/equal) with corresponding wind and bindu typologies.

[14983] [STRUCTURE] Enumeration Continuation
**Analysis:** Enumeration continues with "'phar ba'i rtsa ni bcu gcig" - eleven channels of projection/expansion. The numerical progression (4+4+4+11) suggests systematic coverage of the 72,000 channel system through categorical aggregation.
