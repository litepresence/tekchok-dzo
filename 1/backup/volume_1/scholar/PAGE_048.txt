[1542-1568] [STRUCTURE] Kalpa Calculations Summary
**Analysis:**

**Uncommon Vehicle System:**
- 60×60 equal measures = 180 = First duration kalpa (*yun gyi bskal pa dang po*)
- 180 such = Second intermediate kalpa (*bar gyi bskal pa gnyis pa*)
- 180 such = One great kalpa (*bskal pa chen po*)

**Thalgyur Citation Verse:**
"From first immeasurable to final ten,
Increase and decrease, disease, famine, weapons,
Three minor kalpas marking intervals,
Sixty abiding, then again
Seven by fire and seven by water,
Fourteen complete, then
Remainder destroyed by wind—
Thus sixty abiding,
Destruction duration also that much,
Between sixty, empty abiding,
Thus from 180,
First duration kalpa,
Thus 180,
Second intermediate kalpa,
Thus combined, that much
Is one great kalpa."

**Next Topic:** *rdo rje'i gnas gsum* — Three vajra places/bases
- Khams (elements)
- Chos kyi phung po (aggregates)
- Sog pa'i rnam grangs (enumerations)

**Source Citation:** *nyi zla kha sbyor gyi rgyud* — Sun-Moon Lip-Union Tantra

**Five Topics to Analyze:**
1. *yul khams* — Object-elements
2. *phung po* — Aggregates
3. *skye mched* — Sense-bases
4. *dbang po* — Sense-powers
5. *yul dang yul can shes pa* — Objects and subject-consciousness

**Structural Significance:** Having established the cosmological framework (container/contained), Longchenpa now analyzes the constituent elements of existence—the building blocks of saṃsāric experience.
