[19418-19462] [STRUCTURE] ## Fruition Thigles: Progressive Vision
**Analysis:** Lines 19418-19462 present the third thigle category: the fruition self-ripened thigle (*'bras bu rang smin pa'i thig le*). The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* citation (19431-19435) distinguishes three types:
1. Light-ripened thigle (*'od rnams smin pa'i thig le*)
2. Wisdom-ripened thigle (*ye shes smin pa'i thig le*)
3. Rigpa-ripened thigle (*rig pa smin pa'i thig le*)

This threefold structure represents progressive stages of visionary maturation.

[19418-19462] [PHILOLOGY] **Vision Terminology:**
- *gru chad/*: Broken vessel (semicircular shape)
- *ban bun/*: Smoke-like wisps
- *lang long/*: Mirage-like shimmer
- *dum bu/*: Fragments/pieces
- *'phrig pa/*: Flickering
- *ltem pa/*: Pulsing/throbbing
- *mer bar/*: Blazing fire

These terms constitute the technical vocabulary for dark retreat phenomenology—describing the progressive refinement of visionary appearances.

[19418-19462] [CONCEPT] **Progressive Vision Schema:**
The passage presents three stages of visionary development:

**Stage One: Light-Wall and Derivatives** (19416-19420):
- Initial appearance: light-wall (*'od kyi snam bu*)
- From this: fragments (*dum bu*), broken vessels (*gru chad*), smoke (*ban bun*), mirage (*lang long*)

**Stage Two: Ray-Threads** (19421-19426):
- Appearance as light-ray threads (*'od kyi zer thag*)
- From this: subtlety (*phra ba*), movement (*'gul ba*), flickering (*'phrig pa*), pulsing (*ltem pa*), blazing (*mer bar*)

**Stage Three: Thigle Rim** (19427-19429):
- Arising at the thigle's rim (*mu khyud*)
- From this: vertical ascensions (*gyen 'greng*), radial displays (*rtsibs shar*)

This progression—from diffused light to structured rays to concentrated spheres—mirrors the meditative trajectory from dispersion (*'khrul snang*) to stability (*gnas pa*).

[19418-19462] [CONTEXT] **The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* on Fruition Thigles:**
The citation (19437-19439) describes the light-ripened thigle:
- *'od rnams smin pa'i thig le 'greng bar gnas/*: "The light-ripened thigle abides standing vertically"
- *shin tu gsal la ma 'dres 'ja' tshon bzhin/*: "Extremely clear and unmixed like a rainbow"
- *'di la goms na snang ba yang mthong ngo/*: "Through familiarity with this, vision is also seen"

This describes the actual appearance in advanced practice—the thigle standing vertically, rainbow-like, extremely clear.

[19418-19462] [CONCEPT] **Wisdom-Fortress Appearance:**
Lines 19442-19445 describe the light-ripened thigle's manifestation:
- *tshe za 'og gi gur khyim lta bu/*: Like a tent-house of the tshe za 'og (subterranean spirits)
- *ye shes mkhar thab tu snang ba/*: Appearing as the wisdom fortress
- Extremely clear, thigle and external lights mixed like a rainbow in space

This "wisdom fortress" (*ye shes mkhar thab*) is a standard visionary appearance in Dzogchen dark retreat, representing the stabilization of recognition.

[19418-19462] [PHILOLOGY] **Comparative Syntax:**
The construction *dper na/* (for example) + *bar snang gi 'ja' tshon gzhi du snang ba'o/* (appears as the basis of a rainbow in the atmosphere) uses the simile to ground the visionary experience in natural phenomena—the practitioner sees something "like" a rainbow, not conceptually but phenomenologically.

[19418-19462] [STRUCTURE] ## Wisdom-Ripened Thigle
**Analysis:** Lines 19452-19462 transition to the second fruition thigle: wisdom-ripened (*ye shes smin pa*). The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* citation (19454-19456) describes:
- *ye shes smin pa'i thig le rtsibs la gnas/*: "Wisdom-ripened thigle abides at the ribs/horizontally"
- *kha dog dang gsal nyi ma'i dkyil 'khor 'dra/*: "Like the sun's mandala in color and clarity"
- *'di la goms pas yang ni rang snang mthong/*: "Through familiarity, self-appearance is seen"

[19418-19462] [CONCEPT] **Horizontal vs. Vertical:**
The distinction between vertical (*gyen 'greng*) light-thigle and horizontal (*rtsibs* or *'phred*) wisdom-thigle represents different modalities of visionary appearance:
- Vertical: Ascending, associated with light-transcendence
- Horizontal: Expanding, associated with wisdom-pervasion

Both are five-colored (*kha dog lnga*), radiating (*zer 'phro ba*), like the sun—indicating their shared nature as wisdom-display.
