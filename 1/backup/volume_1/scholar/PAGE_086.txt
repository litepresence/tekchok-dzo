[3166-3173] [STRUCTURE] # Outer Tantra Classification: The Two Systems
**Analysis:** This section introduces the classification of Outer Tantras (*phyi pa'i rgyud*), dividing them into two main categories:

1. **Outer Tantra of Asceticism** (*phyi thub pa rgyud kyi theg pa*) — Kriya Tantra
2. **Inner Tantra of Method** (*nang pa thabs kyi rgyud kyi theg pa*) — Upa and Yoga Tantras

This bipartite division reflects the standard Nyingma doxographical schema found in the *Mdo dgongs pa 'dus pa* and the *Manjusrinamasamgiti* commentaries. The verse citation [3169-3172] from the *Rig pa rang shar* (lines 3170-3172) establishes scriptural authority for this division.

**Key Terminology:**
- *thub pa* — Asceticism/renunciation (tapas), emphasizing purification
- *thabs* — Method/skillful means (upāya), emphasizing transformation

[3174-3175] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of "Tantra" (rgyud)
**Analysis:** The section addresses why mantra teachings are called "tantra" (*sngags la rgyud du 'jog pa ci yin*).

**Etymological Explanation:**
- *gtso bor* — Primarily
- *gang zag gi rgyud* — The continuum of the individual person
- *dbyings kyi 'od gsal* — The luminosity of the expanse (dharmadhātu-prabhāsvara)
- *'jal bas* — By meeting/encountering

The term *rgyud* (tantra) means "continuum" — specifically the continuum of the individual's connection with the luminous nature of reality. This connects to the Sanskrit root "tan" (to stretch/extend), indicating the thread of awakening running through the practitioner.

[3176-3184] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Division of Outer Tantras
**Analysis:** The text presents the standard threefold schema:

1. **Kriya** (*bya ba rgyud*) — Action Tantra [3177]
2. **Upa** (*gnyis ka rgyud*) — Dual/Performance Tantra [3178]  
3. **Yoga** (*rnal 'byor rgyud*) — Yoga Tantra [3179]

The citation from *De nyid las* (lines 3182-3183) provides scriptural support: "Outer tantras are threefold: Kriya, Upa, and Yoga."

This classification reflects the Sarma tradition's standard organization, which Longchenpa integrates into his Nyingma framework.

[3185-3194] [CONCEPT] Kriya Tantra: Practice and Purification
**Analysis:** Kriya Tantra (*bya ba rgyud*) is characterized by:

**Core Practice:**
- *dag pa gsum* — Three purities (body, speech, mind)
- *gtsang sbra spyod pa* — Practice of cleanliness/purity
- *bdag dang lha gnyis rje dang 'bangs kyi tshul du bsgrub pa* — Accomplishing self and deity in the manner of lord and servant
- *dngos grub thob par 'dod pa* — Aspiring to attain siddhis

**Two Sub-divisions [3187-3189]:**
1. **Emphasizing purity** (*dag pa gtso bor byed pa*) — External purification rituals
2. **Emphasizing visualization** (*dmigs pa gtso bor byed pa*) — Internal deity meditation

**Purity Practices [3190-3194]:**
- *khrus gsum* — Three ablutions (bathing rituals)
- *gos gsum brje ba* — Changing three garments
- *dkar gsum bsten pa* — Adopting three white foods (milk, butter, curd)
- *dngar gsum bsten pa* — Adopting three sweet foods (sugar, honey, molasses)

[3195-3205] [CONTEXT] Superiority Over Lower Vehicles
**Analysis:** This section explains why Kriya Tantra surpasses (*'phags*) the lower causal vehicles:

**Key Distinction:**
- Does not posit conventional appearances as truly existent (*kun rdzob snang tshod du bden par mi 'jog par*)
- Uses the **three meditations** (*dmigs pa gsum*):
  1. On the body as deity form (*sku gzugs brnyan la dmigs pas*) — all appearances become visible as form-deities
  2. On speech as letters (*gsung yig 'bru la dmigs pas*) — all sounds become deity-sounds
  3. On mind as mudra (*thugs phyag mtshan la dmigs pas*) — all thoughts become samādhi-deities

**Philosophical Sophistication:**
- Without abandoning form (*gzugs ma spangs pas*), one does not abide in the extremes of singular or plural (*gcig dang du ma'i mtha' la mi gnas*)
- Without falling into the four extremes of production (*mu bzhi'i skye ba*)
- Ultimately (*don dam par*), the yidam is wisdom-being (*ye shes sems dpa'*)

[3202-3204] [PHILOLOGY] Analysis of Meditation Transformations
**Analysis:** The text describes how the three meditations transform perception:

**Line 3202-3203:**
- *dran bsam thams cad* — All mindfulness and thought
- *ting nge 'dzin gyi lhar gsal* — Clearly manifest as samādhi-deity
- *rtog pa thams cad bsam gtan las mi 'da'* — All conceptuality does not transcend meditation

**Line 3204:**
- *rten 'brel chen po la mi gnas* — Not abiding in great dependent origination
- *kun rdzob tsam du yang ma byung ma skyes* — Not produced, not arisen even conventionally

This indicates a more profound view than lower vehicles—emptiness is integrated with appearance, not mere negation.
