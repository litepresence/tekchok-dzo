[6872-6885] [PHILOLOGY] Rejected Student Characteristics

Eightfold classification of students to reject (*spang bya'i slob ma*):
1. Not honoring guru with respect and service
2. Practicing revealing secret mantras
3. Without lineage, without good disposition
4. Become of little wisdom
5. Considering kindness trivial
6. Discussing own lineage
7. Adorning body with good ornaments
8. Becoming hollow without meaning

From *Rang shar*:
"Unexamined student is guru's demon
For person not taking into practice
Great Perfection meaning not explained"

[6886-6898] [CONTEXT] Vessel Analogy

Bad vessel cannot hold good essence—like lion's milk cannot be held in clay vessel. If poured, Dharma's greatness deteriorates and that bad vessel goes to lower realms. Therefore secrets must be kept from such bad vessels.

From *De nyid*:
"Essence of Great Perfection instructions
Don't pour into bad vessels generally
If poured into bad vessels
Both essence and vessel destroyed
Therefore keep from inferior intellects"

[6899-6911] [CONCEPT] Guru-Student Mutual Relationship

Threefold common practice:
1. Guru regards student with compassion, looking with clarity, timely benefit, Dharma, even food and drink
2. Student contemplates guru's qualities with yearning respect and faith without interruption

From *Rang shar*:
"Compassion's connection thread not severed
Yearning stream not interrupted
Is guru-student relationship"
