[12257-12287] [STRUCTURE] Lhungrub's Display and Reversal Mechanics
This section analyzes how lhungrub's spontaneous appearance becomes delusion's ground: (1) lhungrub's jewel-box natural display uninterrupted (lhun grub rin po che'i ga'u'i gnas lugs kyi snang ba ma 'gags pa las, 12259); (2) basis not changing while appearances change (gzhi ma 'gyur bar snang ba 'gyur te, 12260); (3) following after many objects (yul du ma'i rjes su 'brengs te, 12261); (4) everything becoming conceptual (thams cad la rtogs pa'o, 12262); (5) dharmakāya appearance not changing but deluded appearance seeming to change (chos kyi sku'i snang ba ma 'gyur kyang 'khrul pa'i snang ba la 'gyur 'gyur ltar byung ba'o, 12263-12264); (6) Vajrasattva not possessing delusion yet demonstrating delusion-mode for beings (rdo rje sems dpa' la 'khrul pa mi mnga' yang sems can la 'khrul pa'i tshul ston pa'o, 12265-12266); (7) reversal of self-appearance into conditional basis (tha ma rang gi snang ba rang rkyen gyi gzhi la bzlog pa'o, 12267); (8) fourfold misrecognition details (12268-12276).

[12257-12287] [PHILOLOGY] Delusion-Mechanics and Spatial Reversal
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Compound rin po che'i ga'u (jewel-box, 12259) as metaphor for lhungrub; (2) Privative ma with verbs: ma 'gags (uninterrupted), ma 'gyur (not changing), ma shes (not knowing), ma mnga' (not possessing); (3) Terminative te with appearance: 'gyur te (changing), byung ba'o (having arisen); (4) Particle yang introducing paradox (12265); (5) Verb bzlog (reverse, 12267) marks fundamental error; (6) Causative bzung bas (having grasped, 12269, 12271) indicates misapprehension; (7) Terminative du with dependence: ltos can du bzung (grasped as dependent, 12271), yul du bzung (grasped as object, 12273); (8) Compound rang byung (self-arisen, 12274) contrasted with conditioned error; (9) Particle ste establishing location: dus la ltos nas 'od rang byung bar ma shes (not knowing light is self-arisen through dependence on time, 12274); (10) Mtshungs pa de ma thag pa'i rkyen (immediately antecedent condition, 12276).

[12257-12287] [CONTEXT] Vajrasattva's Skillful Means and Jewel Symbolism
The passage integrates: (1) Lhungrub rin po che'i ga'u (jewel-box of spontaneous presence) - maṇi (wish-fulfilling jewel) manifests according to conditions without changing essence; (2) Vajrasattva (rdo rje sems dpa') as primordial buddha demonstrating delusion-mode (ston pa) for beings - bodhisattva's skillful means (thabs mkhas) appearing to share delusion while remaining free; (3) "Great Lhungrub" (chen po de, 12276) and "Great Secret Mantra" (gsang sngags gzhi'i 'khrul lugs chen po, 12253) establish Vajrayāna framework; (4) Fourfold misrecognification: (a) non-dual display not recognized as self-arising (gnyis su med pa'i snang ba rang shar bar ma shes, 12268), (b) grasping delusion as possessor (bdag por bzung bas bdag po'i rkyen, 12269), (c) not recognizing self-aware result as self-arisen (rang rig pa'i 'bras bu rang shar bar ma shes, 12270), (d) grasping cause itself as dependent (rgyu nyid ltos can du bzung bas rgyu'i rkyen, 12271).

[12257-12287] [CONCEPT] Delusion as Misrecognition of Spontaneous Display
The philosophical framework: (1) Lhungrub's display (rtsal snang) is uninterrupted (ma 'gags) and non-dual, yet appears as deluded duality through misrecognition; (2) Basis (gzhi) never changes - only perception of display changes; (3) Non-dual display appears as dualistic subject-object through self-grasping error (bdag por bzung bas bdag po'i rkyen); (4) Reversal (bzlog pa) of self-appearance into conditional basis describes self-display projected outward as separate phenomena; (5) Fourfold misrecognition: grasping delusion as possessor, not recognizing self-aware result as self-arisen, grasping cause as dependent, not knowing object-consciousness as empty; (6) Object and consciousness not known as empty (yul dang shes pa stong par ni ma shes, 12272); (7) Observed object grasped as object (dmigs pa yul du bzung bas dmigs pa rang ngo'i rkyen, 12273); (8) Dependence on time not known as self-arisen light (dus la ltos nas 'od rang byung bar ma shes, 12274); (9) Simultaneity of conditions (dus mtshungs pas, 12277) produces actual delusion ('khrul pa dngos su byung ba'o, 12297).
