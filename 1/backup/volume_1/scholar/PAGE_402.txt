[16798-16805] [PHILOLOGY] Etymological analysis of *dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*:
- *dbyings* (sphere/expanse): From *rig pa'i rang yul* (awareness's own object) and *snang ba'i 'char gzhi* (appearance's arising basis)
- *rnam par dag pa* (completely pure): Absence of stains (*dri ma med pa*) in appearing objects (*yul du snang ba*)
- *sgron ma* (lamp): From *lu gu rgyud go rar bzung nas snang rig gsal bar byed pa* (grasping at the snake-noose fence, making appearance-awareness clear)

The definition emphasizes the lamp's dual function: establishing the sphere as both the basis of awareness and the ground of appearance.

[16801-16817] [CONTEXT] Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The sphere makes awareness's own object / Vajra itself is the snake-noose / This itself enters within / Self-essence free of conceptualization / Also at the inner sphere's fence / Not grasped, not abiding, by this manner / Without separation continuously appears / To appearing objects / Purity exhausts stain numbers / Lamp's vajra snake-noose / Sky itself is focused / Without nature causes appearance / Mind holds that meaning / Therefore is definition of nature / From primordial time abides without gathering-separation."

This verse establishes the ungraspable (*ma bzung*) yet continuously appearing (*rgyun du snang*) character of the sphere lamp.

[16818-16835] [CONCEPT] Threefold classification (*dbye ba*) of the sphere lamp:
1. *gzhi la gnas pa'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Ground-abiding sphere lamp): Wisdom and light body spontaneously arising within the cit
2. *lam la snang ba'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Path-appearance sphere lamp): Five-rim fence gathering the bindu's clarity at the lotus-petal bindu
3. 'bras bu yul la snang ba'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma (Fruition-object sphere lamp): Snake-noose holding with five-color net, half-net, under-barrel, etc.

This triad maps the same lamp across ground-path-fruition (*gzhi lam 'bras bu*) structure characteristic of Dzogchen presentation.

[16836-16849] [CONCEPT] The nature (*rang bzhin*) as nonduality:
The nature is identified as the nonduality of primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*). The citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (lines 16838-16849) describes:
- Nature appearance not ceasing
- Mind-entity and memory all exhausted
- Appearance self-pure in sphere
- Awareness without conceptualization
- Unmoving equal cognition
- All exhausted in the sphere
- Primordial conceptualization exhausted
- Nature completely-pure abides in sphere
- Expressing-appearance word-mind nondual
- Without outer-inner in sphere
- Abides in great ease

[16850-16862] [CONCEPT] Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*) analysis:
The characteristic is defined as the equal purity (*zang ma*) of:
- Outer light sphere empty-luminous (*phyi 'od kyi dbyings stong gsal zang ma*)
- Self-awareness sphere primordially pure (*rang rig pa'i dbyings ka dag zang mar*)

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (lines 16854-16862) establishes this through the metaphor of unfabricated primordial purity (*ye nas ka dag chen por*).

[16863-16897] [STRUCTURE] # Familiarization Method Section
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the sixth topic (*goms tshul*): the method of familiarization. The procedure involves:
1. Separating samsara-nirvana boundary (*'khor 'das ru shan phye*)
2. Placing body-speech in natural state (*lus ngag rnal du phab*)
3. Introducing awareness in the sphere's fence directly (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcu*)
4. Continuous practice day-night (*nyin mtshan med par*)

Progressive stages of appearance:
- First: merely mirror-like light (*od me long tsam*)
- Then: portions (*dum bu*)
- Then: land-area extent (*yul gru tsam*)
- Then: sky-filling (*nam mkha' gang ba*)
- Finally: whatever appears arises as sphere's appearance, seeing kayas until exhaustion of appearances

Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (16872-16883) and *rang shar* (16884-16897) authenticate this progressive visionary unfolding.

---

**Summary:** Page 402 provides the definition, threefold classification, nature, characteristic, and familiarization method of the third lamp. The structural analysis reveals how Longchenpa maps the visionary experience through progressive stages from mirror-light to sky-filling appearances.
