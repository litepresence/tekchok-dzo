[7002-7039] [STRUCTURE] Faults of Not Receiving Empowerment

From *Sgyu 'phrul gsang snying*:
"Not pleasing guru
Not obtaining empowerments
Listening, etc., beginning endeavors
Fruitless and lost"

From *Dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud*:
"Secret mantra without depending on empowerment, accomplishment won't occur
Like one without hand-ears
Cannot cross to river's other side"

From *Rang shar* comprehensive enumeration:
"Faults of not obtaining empowerment thus:
In bardo, wandering
Fear
Obstruction
Hindrance
Consciousness lost
Until karmic body not abandoned
Not seen as worthy of honor by beings
Little merit
Short life
Few enjoyments of livelihood
Narrow mouth
Many obstacles occur
All activities unaccomplished
This is fault of secret mantra practitioner not obtaining empowerment
Secret mantra practitioner should obtain empowerment
Without obtaining, even Buddha cannot turn Dharma wheel at Tathāgata level
Without turning wheel, compassion's emanation body cannot benefit beings
Therefore secret mantra practitioner should obtain empowerment"

[7040-7057] [PHILOLOGY] Empowerment Location Classifications

**Location Types:**
Isolated, delightful, near accomplishment places.

General location: Auspicious with good earth-examination, good forests, etc.

Four specific location categories:
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): Student's body element
   - Earth: south-facing, north protected
   - Water: east-facing, west protected
   - Fire: west-facing, east protected
   - Wind: north-facing, south protected

2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): Thick forest interior, mountain ravine matching student's element form and characteristics

3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): Peak of mountain where three valleys meet—excellent

4. **Utterly without elaboration** (*rab tu spras med*): Extremely isolated or charnel ground—one *rgyang grags* from village

All four empowerment locations:
- Where other beings fear
- Wild fierce beasts dwell
- Poisonous snakes
- Charnel grounds, *spyang gi*, etc.

Excellent charnel ground with extremely fierce ḍākinīs is supreme.

[7058-7086] [CONTEXT] Location Characteristics from Tantras

From *Rdzogs pa rang byung*:
"This supreme empowerment shown
In great village's center
Yogin purpose not accomplished
Village and city's end
Forest or mountain rock empty valley
Yogin enters empowerment meaning"

And:
"Very isolated and delightful place
Examine location's characteristics
End of extensive village
Fruitful forest place
Various flowers born
West high, east facing
North protected, similar
South extensive, similar place
From self clear direction
Without holes and gaps
Without form in front
Without being-like form
Back leaning on rock
Sides various fruit trees blazing
Front river and pure water flowing
Or like life-sustaining place
Mountain ranges not completely cut
Various bird sounds proclaim"

[7087-7131] [CONCEPT] Empowerment Timing Classification

Two aspects:
1. Generally explained
2. Specifically explained

**General:** When guru grants and dependent connections gather—auspicious time.

**Specific excellent time:**
- Autumn: bodhi fruit ripens
- Spring: liberation's seed planted
- Monkey year: auspicious
- Waxing eighth day: good
- Star *rgyal mchog*: good
- Planet Jupiter: good

From *De nyid*:
"Mouse, Dragon, Horse, Pig
Especially years, four
Empowerment ritual accomplished
Months, four first
For perfect fruit result, accomplished
Day count waxing from one
To moon full juncture
Confer time midday or midnight
Yogin body's particularities
Individual element year match
Empowerment ritual auspiciously becomes
This time commitment-holding student
Elements' bodies harmonious
Number immeasurable as measure
Hundred or fifty, etc.
Elements harmonious, no contradiction
If entering ritual
Lamp facing not matching
Commitment replenishing ritual do
If no fault, siddhi
Again and again take
Meaningless death, obstacles arise
Empowerment completion, strongly endeavor
If assembled relative sick
Body disease arisen
Mudrā and circumambulation do
Speech stammering, confusion
Think, recite hundred syllables
Mind hungry or memory lost
Enter generation and completion stage"
