[2430-2445] [STRUCTURE] Superiority of Buddhist Vehicles
**Analysis:**

**Four Dharma-Seal Mudras:**

The transcendent vehicle accepts four seals (*phyag rgya*) that outsiders lack:

1. **All compounded things impermanent** (*'dus byas thams cad mi rtag pa*)
2. **All with defilements suffering** (*zag bcas thams cad sdug bsngal ba*)
3. **All dharmas empty and selfless** (*chos thams cad stong pa bdag med pa*)
4. **Liberation from suffering peaceful** (*sdug bsngal las grol ba zhi ba*)

**Threefold Refuge:**

Going for refuge to the Three Jewels (*dkon mchog gsum*) — another feature absent in outsider paths.

**Fivefold Analysis:**

Longchenpa applies the standard analytical framework:

1. **Essence** (*ngo bo*):
   *'khor ba las nges par 'byin pa'i thabs khyad par can* — "supreme method of definitely exiting samsara"

2. **Definition** (*nges tshig*):
   *zhugs nas bde ba sgrub pa* — "that which, when entered, produces happiness"

3. **Division** (*dbye ba*):
   - Small and great (*theg pa chung dang chen po*)
   - Or three: hearer, self-enlightened, bodhisattva

4. **Purpose** (*dgos pa*):
   *don dang mthar thug sgrub pa* — "accomplishing temporary and ultimate meaning"

5. **Effect** ('*bras bu*):
   *khams gsum las nges par 'byung zhing thar pa thob pa* — "definitely exiting the three realms, obtaining liberation"

**Scriptural Citations:**

From the *Compendium* (*bsdus pa*):
```
Mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—
Joy, happiness, bliss,
Accomplishing supreme virtue.
This vehicle like space,
A measureless great palace.
```

From the *Lankavatara*:
```
As long as mind engages,
Vehicle-limits have no end.
```
