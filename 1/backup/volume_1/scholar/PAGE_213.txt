[8756-8787] [STRUCTURE] Unelaborated Empowerment: Speech Purification

This section presents the unelaborated empowerment (spros med dbang) focusing on speech purification (ngag gi gnas dag pa) through syllables (yi ge) and channel-pressing bliss (rtsa 'tsir ba'i bde ba). The structure establishes the transition from elaborated external rituals to unelaborated internal practices.

[8756-8776] [PHILOLOGY] Unelaboration and Purification Terminology

The text employs contrastive vocabulary:
- "Spros med" (unelaborated): Without constructs, beyond ritual
- "Spros bcas" (elaborated): With constructs, ritual-based
- "Ngag gi gnas" (speech place): Location of speech vajra
- "Dag pa" (purification): Cleansing, clearing
- "Ngo sprod" (introduction): Direct pointing

The particle "ste" marks definition: "'di spros med gsang dbang ste" (this is unelaborated secret empowerment). The emphatic "o" confirms identity.

[8777-8802] [CONTEXT] Four-fold Classification of Unelaborated

The unelaborated empowerment contains four levels:
1. Phyi (outer): Sku gsung thugs kyi yi ges dag par byed pa
   - Three vajra syllables purify
   - External dimension purified

2. Nang (inner): Chos thams cad skye ba med pa la sogs pa
   - All phenomena unborn
   - Inner dimension recognized

3. Gsang (secret): Dngos po gang la'ang rang bzhin med pa
   - No inherent nature in any entity
   - Secret dimension realized

4. Yongs rdzogs (perfect): Chos rnams thams cad stong zhing bdag med
   - All phenomena empty and selfless
   - Perfect dimension complete

[8803-8828] [CONCEPT] Progressive Recognition Through Unelaboration

The progression moves from:
1. Ritual → Essence
   - Spros bcas: Full mandala, implements, sequence
   - Spros med: Direct essence extraction

2. External → Internal
   - Phyi: Observable actions
   - Nang: Subtle processes

3. Constructed → Natural
   - Gsang: Beyond ordinary perception
   - Yongs rdzogs: Complete naturalness

This follows the tantric principle of dbang (ripening) leading to grol (liberation).

[STRUCTURE] Thoroughly Unelaborated: Samsara-Nirvana Distinction

[8829-8854] [PHILOLOGY] Thorough Unelaboration and Distinction Terms

The text employs ultimate vocabulary:
- "Shin tu spros med" (thoroughly unelaborated): Beyond all constructs
- "'Khor 'das" (samsara-nirvana): Cyclic existence and liberation
- "Ru shan 'byed" (distinguish/part): Separate, discriminate
- "Rang rig" (self-awareness): Intrinsic knowing
- "Ka dag" (primordial purity): Original purity

The particle "ni" marks method: "shin tu spros med kyi dbang ni 'khor 'das ru shan phyed nas" (thoroughly unelaborated empowerment distinguishes samsara-nirvana). The instrumental "gis" indicates means.

[8855-8880] [CONTEXT] Thalgyur Citation and Atiyoga Integration

The Thalgyur (kun byed rgyal po) citation:
"Shin tu spros pa med pa las / 'khor 'das ru shan 'og bzhin dbye / de tshe nam mkha'i mtshan nyid las / lus ngag yid kyi sgrib pa yang"

This establishes:
- Source: Thalgyur root tantra
- Method: Ru shan 'byed (distinction)
- Result: Sgrib pa dag (obscuration purification)
- Integration: Atiyoga view in Anuyoga structure

[8881-8906] [CONCEPT] Direct Introduction Through Distinction

The thoroughly unelaborated empowerment:
1. Distinguishes 'khor 'das (samsara-nirvana):
   - Not the same
   - Not different
   - Distinction is conventional
   - Beyond distinction is ultimate

2. Introduces rang rig (self-awareness):
   - Ye stong (empty of self)
   - Nam mkha' lta bu (sky-like)
   - Ka dag (primordially pure)

3. Accomplishes ngo sprad (introduction):
   - Beyond empowerment as transaction
   - Direct recognition transmission
   - Atiyoga in Anuyoga form

[STRUCTURE] Completely Unelaborated: Posture and Gaze Introduction

[8907-8932] [PHILOLOGY] Postural and Visual Terminology

The text employs embodied vocabulary:
- "Rab tu spros med" (completely unelaborated): Ultimate level
- "'Dug stangs" (sitting posture): Physical position
- "Gzigs stangs" (gaze manner): Visual orientation
- "Bstun nas" (in accordance with): Following, adapting to
- "Lhun grub" (spontaneously present): Natural occurrence

The particle "ni" marks definition: "rab tu spros pa med pa'i dbang ni lus kyi 'dug stangs gzigs stangs bstun nas" (completely unelaborated empowerment follows body posture and gaze manner). The emphatic "ste" establishes condition.

[8933-8958] [CONTEXT] Body Postures in Completion Stage

The postures derive from:
- Six Yogas of Naropa: Physical supports for recognition
- Mahamudra: Posture as direct path
- Dzogchen: Natural position without contrivance
- Thalgyur: "Sems kyi dkyil 'khor sgo phyed la / lus kyi 'dug stangs nges par brtsam"

Specific postures:
- Sitting: Seven-point posture of Vairochana
- Gaze: Eyes in space, soft focus
- Alignment: Body as support, not obstacle

[8959-8984] [CONCEPT] Spontaneous Recognition Through Posture

The completely unelaborated empowerment:
1. Uses lus (body) as path:
   - 'Dug stangs (posture): Physical stability
   - Gzigs stangs (gaze): Visual openness
   - Bstun nas (in accordance): Natural alignment

2. Introduces lhun grub (spontaneous presence):
   - Not created through effort
   - Recognized through stability
   - Present from beginning

3. Culminates in rig pa (awareness):
   - Rang ngos sprad (self-introduction)
   - Beyond empowerment as bestowal
   - Original face recognition

**Summary:**

Page 213 presents the unelaborated empowerment with four-fold classification, thoroughly unelaborated empowerment with samsara-nirvana distinction, and completely unelaborated empowerment through posture and gaze. Philologically, the text employs contrastive vocabulary between elaborated and unelaborated, ultimate terminology for thorough unelaboration, and embodied vocabulary for complete unelaboration. Contextual sources include Thalgyur root tantra, Six Yogas, Mahamudra, and Atiyoga systems. Conceptually, the section demonstrates progressive recognition from ritual to natural, direct introduction through distinction, and spontaneous recognition through proper posture—all representing the movement from constructed method to original nature.
