[10281-10334] [STRUCTURE] Introduction to Unsurpassed Samaya
**Analysis:** Line 10281 begins the restoration methods continuation from the previous citation, presenting specific practices for different degradation degrees. The formulaic structure establishes graduated restoration: violation through ganacakra (tshogs kyi 'khor los bshags), degradation through one's wealth (rang gi bdogs pas bskang), transgression through offering children, spouse, attendants, body, speech, mind and possessions (bu dang chung ma dang nye 'khor lus dang ngag dang yid dang bdog par bcas pas bskang), rupture through one's life (rang gi srog gis bskang). Lines 10330-10333 provide the final warning: if repeated, becomes great degradation (nyams pa chen po), unrestorable (gso bar rung ba ma yin). Line 10334 introduces the third major section: "gsum pa bla na med pa'i dam tshig bshad pa ni" (third: explaining the unsurpassed samaya), marking the transition to the Dzogchen view of samaya as non-maintained natural state.

[10335-10342] [PHILOLOGY] Citation from Anuttara Tantra
**Analysis:** Lines 10335-10338 cite the Yi ge med pa las (From the Without Letters/Anuttara Tantra) presenting the view basis for unsurpassed samaya: "de dus bsrung ba'i mtshams 'das pa'i med dang gcig pu phyal ba yi de yi grogs su de 'gyur ro" (at that time transcending the boundary of maintenance, non-existent and single wide open, that becomes companion of that). The citation employs the characteristic Dzogchen language of transcending boundaries (mtshams 'das pa), non-existence (med pa), singularity (gcig pu), and wide openness (phyal ba). The phrase de yi grogs su de 'gyur ro (that becomes companion of that) uses the metaphor of companionship to describe the inseparability of practitioner and natural state. This citation establishes the scriptural basis for the Dzogchen view of samaya as non-maintained spontaneous presence.

[10339-10405] [CONTEXT] Longchenpa's Direct Explanation
**Analysis:** Lines 10339-10405 present Longchenpa's autocommentary on the citation, his most extensive prose exposition in this section: "rang gi rtogs pa'i steng nas thag chod par drang thad du brjod de" (I will speak directly from the certainty of my own realization). The passage explains: thus the samaya of Great Perfection nature (rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po'i dam tshig), self-arisen awareness wisdom (rig pa rang byung ye shes), primordially transcending maintenance and boundary (ye nas bsrung mtshams las 'das pa'i ngo bo), makes unmoving from that essence (las mi g.yo bar byed pa). This establishes the Dzogchen view: samaya is not something to be maintained but the natural state itself. The passage then explains the trekcho (khregs chod) samaya: from the aspect of primordial purity essence (ngo bo ka dag la ltos nas), all apparent phenomena of cyclic existence (snang srid snod bcud phyi nang thams cad) are primordially non-existent (ye nas med pa) like the eight illusion examples (smig rgyu'i chu la sogs pa sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad du shes pas), releasing fixation on appearance (snang ba la bden zhen grol ba). This explanation integrates the view of emptiness (trekcho) with the tantric framework.

[10339-10405] [CONCEPT] Trekcho Samaya as Open Awareness
**Analysis:** The text conceptualizes trekcho samaya as maintaining awareness openly without binding (sems 'dzin gyi 'jur bus ma bcings pa'i rig pa phyal ba bar med chen por skyong zhing). The phrase phyal ba (wide open/extensive) describes awareness without focus or limitation. The instruction not to do any fixation (zhen 'dzin gang yang mi bya bar) establishes the non-doing aspect of trekcho: not fixing on anything, allowing the five senses to be wide open (sgo lnga har sangs), awareness without support (rten med), nakedly released (rjen la phud) and widely released (phyal phyal gtong ba). The purpose (dgos pa) is releasing apparent imputation into dharmata (snang btags chos nyid du grol ba). This concept represents the cutting through (trekcho) aspect of Dzogchen practice: cutting through all conceptual elaborations to rest in naked awareness.

[10406-10426] [PHILOLOGY] Spontaneous Presence Technical Terms
**Analysis:** Lines 10406-10426 present the thogal (thod rgal) samaya explanation. The phrase rang bzhin lhun grub la ltos na (from the aspect of spontaneous presence nature) at line 10406 establishes the perspective shift from primordial purity to spontaneous presence. The term thod rgal (direct crossing/leap over) employs the technical term for the second main Dzogchen practice. The phrase yon tan lhun gyis grub pas (qualities spontaneously present) at line 10407 describes the intrinsic perfection of ground. The construction tshogs la ma ltos par (not depending on accumulations) at line 10407 distinguishes Dzogchen from sutra paths requiring merit and wisdom accumulations. The phrase rang ngo shes pas 'grub par thag bcad nas (determined that through self-recognition one is accomplished) at line 10407 establishes self-recognition as sufficient for liberation. The five lights ('od lnga) and four visions (snang ba bzhi) are standard thogal technical terms. The result is expressed as "sangs rgyas rang chas su grub ste" (buddhahood established as self-possession), not needing to seek from others (gzhan nas tshom mi dgos pa).

[10406-10426] [STRUCTURE] Completion of Unsurpassed Samaya
**Analysis:** Lines 10406-10426 complete the presentation of thogal samaya. The passage explains: from the aspect of spontaneous presence nature (rang bzhin lhun grub la ltos na), self-arisen wisdom (rang byung gi ye shes) has spontaneously present qualities (yon tan lhun gyis grub pas), not depending on accumulations (tshogs la ma ltos par), determined that through self-recognition one is accomplished (rang ngo shes pas 'grub par thag bcad nas), not separated from practice of four visions (snang ba bzhi'i nyams len dang mi 'bral bar byas pas), buddhahood established as self-possession (sangs rgyas rang chas su grub). Lines 10416-10426 present the characteristic Dzogchen poetic expression of completion: whatever appears or is aware (rkyen snang dang bde sdug byung tshor dang rnam rtog snang ba dang rig pa ci shar ci snang ci rig kyang), all determined as self-arisen wisdom (rang byung gi ye shes gcig pur thag chod pas), not moving from the intention of great spontaneous evenness where all is self-liberated (thams cad rang grol lhun mnyam chen po'i dgongs pa las mi 'da'). The passage concludes with the poetic expression: essence as dharmakaya primordial purity and spontaneous presence trekcho and thogal non-dual (ngo bo chos kyi sku ka dag dang lhun grub khregs chod dang thod rgal gnyis su med par), at the ground of exhausted dharmata (chos nyid zad sa la), sha-ra-ra 'ol-la-la ye-re-re sang-sang-sang, firmly established.

[10406-10426] [CONTEXT] Dzogchen View in Nyingma Tradition
**Analysis:** The passage contextualizes Dzogchen samaya within the broader Nyingma tradition. The distinction between trekcho (cutting through) and thogal (direct crossing) represents the two principal practices of Dzogchen Atiyoga. Trekcho corresponds to the view of primordial purity (ka dag)—the recognition that all phenomena are empty from the beginning; thogal corresponds to spontaneous presence (lhun grub)—the manifestation of wisdom through practice without accumulation. This context establishes that unsurpassed samaya is not an ethical code to be followed but the natural expression of recognition. The mention of four visions (snang ba bzhi) and five lights ('od lnga) references specific thogal practices involving light and subtle body meditation. The passage establishes that in Dzogchen, samaya is not maintained through effort but recognized as spontaneously perfect.

[10406-10426] [CONCEPT] Samaya as Recognition Rather Than Maintenance
**Analysis:** The text presents a paradigm shift from maintained to recognized samaya. In the lower vehicles, samaya consists of commitments to be maintained through vigilance and effort; in Dzogchen, samaya is the recognition of the natural state itself. Lines 10341-10342 establish this: the samaya of Great Perfection nature, self-arisen pristine awareness wisdom, primordially transcending maintenance and boundary (ye nas bsrung mtshams las 'das pa'i ngo bo). This concept reflects the Dzogchen view that enlightenment is not achieved but recognized as always already present. The phrase "las mi g.yo bar byed pa" (makes unmoving from that essence) indicates that unsurpassed samaya is the stability of recognition rather than the maintenance of commitment. This conceptual framework resolves the tension between graduated samaya (with its temporal degradation) and absolute realization—recognition is either present or absent, not subject to gradual deterioration.
