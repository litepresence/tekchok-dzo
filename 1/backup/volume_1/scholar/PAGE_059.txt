[1944-1974] [CONTEXT] Lokayata Materialism
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa presents the *rgyang 'phan pa* (Lokayata/Carvaka) school, representing Indian materialism. The school's fundamental tenet: denial of previous/future lives, karma, cause-effect, and liberation.

**Two Subdivisions:**

1. **Cause-Nihilism** (*rgyu chad par smra ba*)
2. **Result-Nihilism** ('*bras bu chad par smra ba*)

**Cause-Nihilism Position:**

The son of the naked one (*gcer bu pa gnyen gyi bu*) and others propose:
- Mind is not continuous from previous to present
- A "latent mind" (*bag la zhayi sems*) exists inherently in the four elements
- This latent mind, when compressed (*rgyas 'thums*) and meeting conditions of heat/moisture, arises
- New mind enters new body, becoming sentient being

**Pervasive Mind Theory:**

Earth contains latent mind, producing:
- Plants, trees, forests (*rtsi shing dang nags tshal*)
- Water: moistening, movement, sound
- Fire: blazing, burning
- Wind: movement and lifting

**Evidence Cited:**
- Wood and stones striking produce sound
- Trees wither at night, expand by day
- Peeling bark causes drying
- Spontaneous generation: worms from moisture + heat, termites becoming bees, worms becoming frogs

**Critique of Eternal Cause:**
If causes were eternal, wood/stones would have previous lives like sentient beings. Since they don't, causes must be adventitious (*glo bur ba*) like boils arising from accumulated conditions.

[1975-2004] [CONTEXT] Result-Nihilism
**Analysis:**

**Key Figures:**
- Katika's hunchbacked son (*ka ta'i bu nog can*)
- Mipam wearing hair blanket (*mi 'pham skra'i lva ba can*)

**Position:**
- No previous lives for present beings
- No latent cause producing arising mind
- Everything arises from nature itself (*ngo bo nyid kyis byung ba*)

**Natural Arising Examples:**
- Sharp thorns without makers
- Sunrise without cause
- Waterfalls falling naturally
- These phenomena display natural formation (*ye nas byung ba*)

**Death and Cessation:**
- Death ends all without continuation
- No future results whatsoever

**Scriptural Citation:** *Dbang phyug nag po'i rgyud* (Black Tantra of Ishvara):

```
The sun rises, rivers fall
Sharp, long thorns
Beautiful peacocks' tails
Beautiful kings' sons—
None made these; they arise from nature itself.
Cessation is not nonexistent, nor is the future existent.
All this is merely adventitious confusion, conceptually designated.
```

[2005-2012] [STRUCTURE] Defense Against Scriptural Meaninglessness
**Analysis:**

The text addresses the objection that nihilist views render spiritual practice meaningless.

**Defense of Cause-Nihilism:**
- Even without previous mind, present coarse mind exists
- When it ripens as sentient being, understanding non-existence leads to liberation
- The scripture has purpose: showing that at death, elements dissolve into outer elements
- Consciousness divides and destroys affliction-nature

**Defense of Result-Nihilism:**
- Knowing non-existent nature prevents being "carried away" by other scriptures
- Prevents meaningless effort (*ngal bar byed pa*)
- The scripture of "speaking nonexistence" has meaning for reversing this life's suffering
