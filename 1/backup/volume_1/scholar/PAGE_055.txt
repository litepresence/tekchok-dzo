[1782-1810] [CONTEXT] The Uttaratantra Citation
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa cites the *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttaratantra/Ratnagotravibhaga), the seminal treatise on buddha-nature attributed to Maitreya via Asanga. This citation provides the metaphysical grounding for the entire presentation.

**The Elemental Dependent Origination:**

```
Earth is in water and wind
Wind abides excellently in space
Space is not in wind, water,
Nor in the earth element
```

**Hermeneutical Structure:**

1. **The Elements as Support:** Earth relies on water and wind
2. **The Ultimate Support:** Wind relies on space (*nam mkha'*)
3. **The Unreliance of Space:** Space does not depend on the lower elements

**Application to Buddhist Phenomenology:**

```
Aggregates, elements, and faculties
Rely upon actions and kleśas
Actions and kleśas are not correct
Yet mental activities constantly abide
```

This presents a hierarchical dependent origination (*rten 'brel*):
- Form relies on action (*las*)
- Action relies on affliction (*nyon mongs*)
- Affliction relies on incorrect mental activity (*tsul bzhin min yid byed*)
- Incorrect mental activity relies on pure mind (*sems kyi dag pa*)

**The Ultimate Point:** *sems kyi rang bzhin chos rnams ni / thams cad yang gnas ma yin* — "the phenomena of mind's self-nature do not abide anywhere."

[1811-1822] [CONCEPT] The Three Types of Action
**Analysis:**

From the previous analysis emerge three types of action (*las gsum*):

1. **Meritorious Action** (*bsod nams kyi las*):
   - Produces pleasurable results of samsara
   - Includes ten virtues (*dge ba bcu*) and merit-compatible actions
   - Result: Higher realms, human/divine happiness

2. **Non-Meritorious Action** (*bsod nams ma yin pa*):
   - Ten non-virtues (*mi dge ba bcu*)
   - Five uninterrupted offenses (*mtshams med pa lnga*)
   - Result: Lower realms, suffering

3. **Immovable Action** (*mi g.yo ba'i las*):
   - Produces results in higher realms (*khams gong ma'i sa*)
   - *gzhar du mi g.yo bar 'bras bu 'byin pa'i phyir* — produces immovable results elsewhere
   - Associated with form and formless realm meditation

**Dzogchen Critique:** All three are still *'khor ba'i las* — actions of samsara. True liberation transcends even meritorious action.

[1823] [STRUCTURE] The Six Afflictions
**Analysis:**

The text introduces the six root afflictions (*nyon mongs pa drug*), which serve as the foundation for all contaminated actions. These are:

1. Desire/attachment (*'dod chags*)
2. Anger/aversion (*zhe sdang*)
3. Pride/arrogance (*nga rgyal*)
4. Ignorance (*ma rig pa* / *gti mug*)
5. Doubt (*the tshom*)
6. View (*lta ba*)

These six function as the proximate cause for the arising of action, which in turn produces the aggregates, elements, and faculties that constitute the ground of delusion.
