[373-374] [CONCEPT] The Self-Arisen Nature of the Three Emanations
**Analysis:** The text emphasizes the non-manufactured (*sus kyang ma byas pa*) nature of the three emanations. The particle *sus kyang* (by anyone whatsoever) with the negative *ma* indicates absolute non-origination through agency. This aligns with the *svayaṃbhū* (self-arisen) doctrine in tantric Buddhism: enlightened manifestation is not created but naturally emerges from dharmatā. The term *mi 'jigs pa* (fearless) indicates that because these emanations are not fabricated, they transcend all fear—they cannot be destroyed, altered, or obstructed.

[373-374] [PHILOLOGY] The Absolute Negation *sus kyang ma byas*
**Analysis:** The construction *sus kyang ma byas pa* (not made by anyone whatsoever) uses the interrogative-indefinite *su* (who) + *s* (emphatic) + *kyang* (even/also) to create a universal negative: not made by ANYONE, not even by the Buddha. The phrase *sus kyang ma byas pas* uses the instrumental *pas* to indicate that this non-creation is the CAUSE of fearlessness: BECAUSE they are not made, they are fearless.

[375-376] [PHILOLOGY] Immediate Liberation Through Contact
**Analysis:** The phrase *gang dang phrad pa* (meeting with whichever) uses the ablative/locative *dang* to indicate contact or conjunction. The construction *rang dengs su grol* (self-immediately liberated) employs *rang* (self) + *dengs* (immediate/on the spot) + *grol* (liberated)—a quintessential Dzogchen formulation indicating instantaneous liberation without gradual path. The instrumental *gyis* in *byed pa'i 'phrin las* indicates that this is the activity (*'phrin las*) performed through/by means of this meeting.

[375-376] [CONTEXT] # Contact Liberation (*Phrad Grol*) in Nyingma Tradition
**Analysis:** The concept of liberation through contact (*phrad grol*) appears in multiple Nyingma sources:
- **Zhi khro tantras:** Liberation through hearing (*thos grol*), seeing (*mthong grol*), wearing (*btags grol*)
- **Terma cycles:** Physical objects (*rten*) that confer liberation
- **Dzogchen:** Recognition (*rig pa*) as immediate liberation

Longchenpa's formulation here integrates these: the supports are physical (*rdo rje*, *yi ge*, *sku gzugs*), but their function is recognition-based.

[377-382] [STRUCTURE] # The Three Supports (*rten gsum*) for Liberation
**Analysis:** The text presents three supports corresponding to the three doors (*sgo gsum*) of liberation:

1. **Mind-support Vajra** (*thugs kyi rten rdo rje*) — function: disease-pacification to liberation
2. **Speech-support Self-arisen Letter** (*gsung gi rten rang byung gi yi ge*) — function: liberation through meeting and hearing
3. **Body-support Form** (*sku*) — function: liberation into clear light upon contact

These supports (*rten*) are not mere symbols but "power objects" (*byin brlabs can*) in Nyingma understanding—material forms infused with enlightened blessing that serve as gateways for recognition.

[377-382] [CONCEPT] The Three Doors of Liberation
**Analysis:** The three supports map onto the three doors (*sgo gsum*):
- **Body door:** Contact with form → liberation into light
- **Speech door:** Hearing sound → liberation through resonance
- **Mind door:** Recognition of vajra → liberation through insight

This is the *trikāya* applied to the individual practitioner: one's body, speech, and mind become the vehicles of liberation when they contact enlightened body, speech, and mind.

[383-392] [CONTEXT] # The Chronology of the Three Teachings
**Analysis:** The text presents a complex chronology correlating life-span with teaching modality:

**Body-taming teaching** (*sku'i 'dul ba'i bstan pa*): 3 × (5,500 years) = 16,500 years
- From Amitāyus life-span (*tshe lo dpag med*) to the time of the thousand Buddhas (*stong thub pa*)

**Speech-taming teaching** (*gsung gi 'dul ba'i bstan pa*): 5,500 years
- Until 70-year life-span

**Mind-taming teaching** (*thugs kyi 'dul ba'i bstan pa*): 5,500 years
- Until 10-year life-span

These numbers reflect the *kalpa* cosmology where human life-span gradually decreases from 80,000 years to 10 years before the next Buddha (Maitreya) appears. The phrase *dus ma yin gyi* (not time but) clarifies that these are pedagogical categories (*'dul ba'i lo grangs*) rather than literal historical periods.

[383-392] [PHILOLOGY] The Particle *zhing* as Contrast
**Analysis:** The construction *zhing gzhon las ches 'phags* (surpasses other [world-systems]) uses *zhing* (and/but) to create contrast. The superlative *ches* (most/very) with *'phags* (to be superior) establishes a hierarchy: Jambudvīpa excels all other worlds. The genitive *gi* in *dus kyi* creates a temporal dependency: the different times OF the teachings.

[393-397] [CONTEXT] # Locations of the Hidden Treasures
**Analysis:** The text identifies specific locations for the three supports:

1. **Vajra in Uḍḍiyāna** (*u rgyan gyi yul*) — the legendary land of the ḍākinīs (modern Swat Valley, Pakistan), "salty-taste ocean island" (*rgya mtsho lan tshwa'i ro dang ldan pa'i gling*)

2. **Letter in sky above Vajra-seat** (*rdo rje gdan*) — held by ḍākinīs at 500 leagues (*dpag tshad lnga brgya*) elevation

3. **Body abiding together** (*lhan cig bzhugs*) — co-present with the letter

These locations correspond to terma (*gter ma*) geography in Nyingma tradition—the Vajra is concealed in the earthly realm (Uḍḍiyāna), the letter in the aerial/celestial realm (sky ḍākinīs), and the body bridges both. The occasional emanations (*skabs su*) indicate that these are not static objects but dynamic manifestations appearing when conditions ripen.

[393-397] [STRUCTURE] # The Three Realms of Terma Concealment
**Analysis:** Nyingma terma geography recognizes three concealment realms:
- **Earth treasures (*sa gter*):** Concealed in physical locations
- **Mind treasures (*dgongs gter*):** Concealed in the mind-stream
- **Sky/space treasures (*nam mkha'i gter*):** Concealed in the aerial realm

The three supports here follow this schema: vajra in earth (Uḍḍiyāna), letter in sky (above Vajra-seat), body transcending both.

[393-397] [PHILOLOGY] The Term *skabs su*
**Analysis:** The phrase *skabs su 'od dang sgra dang dge slong...* uses *skabs su* (occasionally/at times) to indicate intermittent manifestation. This temporal marker distinguishes between the supports' continuous abiding (*gnas*) and their occasional active emanation ('*byung*). The instrumental *dang* (with) in *rdzu 'phrul dang ldan pa* creates an adjectival phrase: "possessing miraculous powers."

[393-397] [CONCEPT] The Temporal Structure of Revelation
**Analysis:** The distinction between continuous abiding and occasional emanation establishes a crucial Dzogchen principle:
- **Ground:** Always present, never changing
- **Path:** Intermittent recognition, gradual clarification
- **Fruition:** Continuous recognition, inseparable from ground

The supports abide continuously as the ground-nature but appear occasionally as the path-condition. This explains why terma revelation occurs at specific historical moments—when the conjunction of teacher, time, and trainee capacity creates the optimal conditions for transmission.

[393-397] [CONTEXT] # The Three Bodies as Supports
**Analysis:** The three supports correlate with the three bodies:
- **Vajra (mind-support):** Dharmakāya — indestructible emptiness
- **Letter (speech-support):** Saṃbhogakāya — spontaneous sound-display
- **Body (form-support):** Nirmāṇakāya — manifest physical form

This tripartite structure ensures that liberation is accessible through all three doors—mind recognizing the vajra-nature, speech hearing the self-arisen sound, body contacting the liberating form.
