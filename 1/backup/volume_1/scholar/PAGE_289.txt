[12047-12086] [STRUCTURE] Distinguishing Expansive Qualities and Buddha Qualities
This section continues the analysis of Samantabhadra's liberation, distinguishing: (1) expanse qualities (dbyings kyi yon tan) present but unmanifest in recognition (12066-12070), (2) buddha qualities (sangs rgyas kyi yon tan) that manifest at complete perfection through cessation-power (12071-12072), and (3) the alternative formulation distinguishing basis-lhungrub's buddha qualities from result-actualized buddha qualities (12073-12074). The section critiques the reified notion of "primordially liberated" (gzhi thog nas grol, 12053, 12057) as potentially misleading if interpreted as ordinary ground-state, clarifying that liberation occurs at the "lhungrub level's perfection" (mthar phyin lhun grub kyi sa grol ba, 12058). The six characteristics (chos drug, 12076-12082) are reiterated as defining awakened nature.

[12047-12086] [PHILOLOGY] Causative Terminology and Qualitative Distinctions
Key grammatical constructions: (1) The causative zer (assert/claim) with brtsings (erroneously constructed) introduces potential misunderstanding: gzhi thog tu grol zer brtsings te (12053), gzhi thog tu grol zer ba yang rtsings te (12057) - "saying 'liberated at the ground' is erroneous construction"; (2) The optative nam introduces rhetorical challenge: gzhi thog ma yin nam zhe na (12063) - "is the ground not a beginning? one might ask"; (3) The terminative te with gnas (12068) marks abiding state: gnas tshad la (in the state of abiding); (4) The emphatic particle ni establishes contrast: yod ni yod (12069) - "existing, yes existing [but unmanifest]"; (5) The causal particle phyir marks consequence: ma mngon pa'i phyir (12070) - "because unmanifest"; (6) The enumerative dang with so marks the six characteristics list; (7) The threefold "not arising from" construction: rgyu las ma byung/sems las ma byung/lung las ma byung (12083-12085).

[12047-12086] [CONTEXT] Philosophical Debates on Primordial Liberation
The passage addresses debates within Nyingma and between Nyingma and Sarma schools: (1) The critique of "primordially liberated" interpretation addresses potential reification - if ground-state is liberation, why practice? (2) The distinction between "beginning" (thog ma) in natural condition versus "first ground" (dang po'i gzhi) clarifies that while there is no temporal beginning in gnas lugs (natural state), there is an ordinal first in analysis; (3) The "ground not possessing delusion yet demonstrating delusion-mode for beings" (rdo rje sems dpa' la 'khrul pa mi mnga' yang sems can la 'khrul pa'i tshul ston pa) reflects Vajrasattva's skillful means; (4) The zag med (outflow-free) merit resolves the tension between "without virtue" and "ocean of merit" - recognition produces merit without accumulation (tshogs bsag med).

[12047-12086] [CONCEPT] The Ontological Status of Qualities: Latent vs. Manifest
The philosophical framework establishes a nuanced ontology of qualities: (1) Two types of qualities: (a) dbyings kyi yon tan - present but unmanifest (yod ni yod la ma mngon), like oil in sesame not yet pressed, (b) sangs rgyas kyi yon tan - manifest through sangs stobs (cessation-power), like oil released through pressing; (2) Recognition does not create qualities but liberates obstructing forces, allowing manifestation; (3) The paradox: Kun tu bzang po achieves buddhahood without gradual accumulation (dge ba rdul tsam ma byas par gzhi thog nas sangs rgyas) yet this is "outflow-free self-arisen merit ocean" (zag med rang byung gi dge ba rgya mtsho) - recognition itself is the accumulation; (4) Alternative distinction: gzhi lhun grub kyi sangs rgyas kyi yon tan (basis-lhungrub's buddha qualities) vs. 'bras bu mngon gyur grub sangs rgyas kyi yon tan (result-actualized manifest buddha qualities); (5) The six characteristics establish non-dependent arising: transcending basis (not remaining in neutrality), self-display (recognizing own manifestation), differentiation (wisdom discerning), liberation-upon-differentiation (immediate freedom), non-arising-from-other (not dependent on causes), self-abiding (natural presence).
