[8919-8946] [STRUCTURE] Yid and Sems: Functional Distinction

This section elaborates the functional distinction between yid (intellect) and sems (mind/consciousness), establishing how these two aspects of cognition operate differently in perception, conceptualization, and purification processes.

[8919-8934] [PHILOLOGY] Cognitive Function Terminology

The text employs precise psychological vocabulary:
- "Yid" (intellect): Analytical, conceptual mind
- "Sems" (mind): Basic awareness, alaya
- "Don sna phyi dang yid yul don spyi dpyod pa" (investigating external objects and intellect's general object)
- "Rang gi snang yul dngos po 'dzin pa" (grasping own appearing object)
- "Dngos med 'dzin pa" (grasping non-thing)

The particle "ces" marks definition: "de dang ma 'brel bar don sna phyi dang yid yul don spyi dpyod pa la yid ces bya'o" (unconnected with that, investigating external objects and intellect's general object is called yid). The quotative "bya'o" establishes terminology.

[8935-8958] [CONTEXT] Abhidharma and Yogacara Cognitive Theory

The distinction derives from:
- Abhidharma: Manovijnana (yid kyi rnam shes) vs alaya-vijnana (kun gzhi rnam shes)
- Yogacara: Three natures (mtshan nyid gsum) framework
- Pramana: Svalakshana (rang mtshan) vs samanyalakshana (spyi mtshan)

Key distinctions:
- Sems: Grasping particulars (svalakshana)
- Yid: Grasping universals (samanyalakshana)
- Sems: Direct perception
- Yid: Conceptual cognition

[8959-8984] [CONCEPT] Two-mode Cognition

The yid/sems distinction reveals two cognitive modes:
1. Sems mode (particular-grasping):
   - Rang gi snang yul (own appearing object)
   - Dngos po 'dzin pa (grasping thing)
   - Gsal ba (clear) perception
   - Direct, immediate

2. Yid mode (universal-grasping):
   - Don sna phyi (external object)
   - Don spyi (general object)
   - Mi gsal ba (unclear) perception
   - Conceptual, mediated

This corresponds to:
- Don dam (ultimate): Sems level
- Kun rdzob (conventional): Yid level

[STRUCTURE] Sixteen Divisions Complete

[8985-9010] [PHILOLOGY] Existential and Enumerative Particles

The text employs completion vocabulary:
- "Yod do" (exists): Existential assertion
- "Rang ngo'i dbye ba" (self-nature division): Intrinsic classification
- "Bzhi bzhi" (four each): Multiplicative distribution
- "Bcu drug" (sixteen): Complete enumeration
- "Ste" (establishing): Continuative particle

The particle "ni" marks existence: "rang ngo'i dbye ba re re la phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs bzhi bzhi ste bcu drug tu yod do" (in each self-nature division, four each of outer, inner, secret, perfect—established as sixteen—exist). The emphatic "do" confirms existence.

[9011-9036] [CONTEXT] Sixteen-fold Structure Authority

The sixteen divisions follow:
- Abhisamaya-alamkara: Sixteen aspects of knowledge
- Hevajra: Sixteen goddesses (da ka)
- Kalachakra: Sixteen shaktis
- Nyingma: Systematic completeness

The 4 x 4 structure:
- Ensures no omissions
- Mirrors mandala architecture
- Provides progressive path

[9037-9062] [CONCEPT] Exhaustive Systematicity

The sixteen divisions provide:
1. Complete coverage:
   - Every possible aspect addressed
   - No gaps in system
   - Total framework

2. Recursive depth:
   - Each level contains four
   - Consistent structure
   - Fractal-like organization

3. Practical utility:
   - Gradual practice stages
   - Progressive maturation
   - Complete realization

[STRUCTURE] Three Manifestation Topics

[9063-9088] [PHILOLOGY] Manifestation Enumerative Structure

The text employs three-fold vocabulary:
- "Rnam 'phrul" (manifestation): Display, emanation
- "Dag byed" (purifier): Agent of purification
- "Dag rgyu" (cause of purification): Purification basis
- "'Gyur dang bcas" (with transformation): Including change
- "Bstan pa" (show): Presentation, demonstration

The particle "ni" marks enumeration: "gsum pa rnam par 'phrul pa'i dbye bas shin tu rgyas par spro ba la gsum ste" (third, to the manifestation divisions' very extensive elaboration—three). The emphatic "ste" establishes count.

[9089-9114] [CONTEXT] Comprehensive Purification Framework

The three manifestation topics:
1. Dbang so so'i dag byed kyi dbye bas dag rgyu bcu drug 'gyur dang bcas pa bstan pa
   - Individual empowerment purifiers showing sixteen causes of purification with transformation

2. Lus kyi bya ba la brten nas nges pa'i dbye bas dbang gi gnas lugs bstan pa
   - Body activity reliance showing definitive division of empowerment's natural state

3. Grangs kyi dbye ba la brten nas las dang nyon mongs pa'i dag byed bstan pa
   - Number division reliance showing karma and affliction purifiers

[9115-9140] [CONCEPT] Triadic Purification Structure

The three topics form comprehensive framework:
1. Empowerment-specific (dbang so so):
   - Particular to each empowerment
   - Individual purifiers
   - Specific applications

2. Body-activity-based (lus kyi bya ba):
   - Physical foundation
   - Activity as method
   - Natural state result

3. Numerical-enumerative (grangs kyi dbye ba):
   - Systematic enumeration
   - Karma purification
   - Affliction purification

Together: Complete coverage of all purification types.

**Summary:**

Page 219 completes the yid/sems functional distinction, sixteen divisions enumeration, and three manifestation topics. Philologically, the text employs cognitive terminology for yid/sems, existential/enumerative particles, and three-fold manifestation vocabulary. Contextual sources include Abhidharma/Yogacara cognitive theory, sixteen-fold structures from various tantras, and systematic purification frameworks. Conceptually, the section demonstrates two-mode cognition (particular vs universal), exhaustive 16-fold systematicity through 4x4 recursion, and triadic purification covering empowerment-specific, body-activity-based, and numerical-enumerative approaches—all representing complete cognitive and systematic coverage for total purification.
