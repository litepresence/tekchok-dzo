[5989-6019] [PHILOLOGY] "Thus I Heard" Analysis
**Analysis:** Lines 5989-6019 analyze the grammatical and philosophical significance of the preamble formula "Thus I heard at one time" (*'di skad bdag gis thos pa dus gcig na*):

**Historical-Transmission Reading [5989-5994]:**
"Vajrapani himself, before teacher Samantabhadra Vajradhara, actually heard at that time" — indicating compiler (*sdud pa po*) received this dharma from former Buddhas, established in mind, enlightened.

**Three Establishments:**
1. Unbroken lineage (*brgyud pa bar ma chad pa*)
2. Dharma enumerations of three times meaning-concordant (*dus gsum gyi chos kyi rnam grangs don mthun pa*)
3. Generating certainty in retinue (*'khor la yid ches bskyed pa*)

**Citation from *Thal 'gyur* [5995-6002]:**
"For opening other vehicles' doors, by common preambles, compiler to own retinue, for generating certainty taught. Arising from taming object as taming agent, teaching abides."

**Dispelling Objections [6003-6019]:**

**First Objection [6004-6011]:**
Those without eye of intellect to see great wave dharmas' form, saying: "Other sutra-tantras say 'thus I heard,' 'taught' does not appear here, therefore fabricated."

**Response [6007-6011]:**
If "taught" makes fabricated, then *Bde mchog rtsa rgyud* saying "Then secret taught" would also be fabricated — absurd.

**Second Objection [6012-6015]:**
Twice showing preamble not possible.

**Response [6013-6015]:**
Melody section would not be possible — absurd. Title also twice shown would be absurd.

**Resolution [6016-6019]:**
Meaning-tantra arising shown by uncommon preamble; word-tantra arising shown by common preamble. Without contradiction, moreover extremely connected shown.
