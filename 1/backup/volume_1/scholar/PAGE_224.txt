[9141-9168] [STRUCTURE] Elaborated Empowerment: Outer Results and Prophecy

This section concludes the elaborate empowerment presentation with the outer dimension results, prophecies (lung bstan), and the systematic enumeration of defilements to be purified through the empowerment framework.

[9141-9158] [PHILOLOGY] Prophecy and Entrance Terminology

The text employs soteriological vocabulary:
- "Lung bstan" (prophecy): Prediction, authorization
- "'Jug pa" (entry): Engagement, initiation
- "Ngo shes pa" (recognition): Direct knowing
- "Gsang ba" (secret): Hidden, profound
- "Dkyil 'khor" (mandala): Sacred enclosure

The particle "ni" marks enumeration: "lung bstan pa dang gsum mo" (prophecy and three). The enumerative "mo" confirms count.

[9159-9184] [CONTEXT] Three Secret Dimensions

The three gsang ba (secret) dimensions:
1. Dkyil 'khor du 'jug pas:
   - Dbyings la rig pa gzhug pa'i gnad
   - Essential point of inserting awareness into space

2. Lha ngo bstan pas:
   - Dbyings rig ngo sprad pa
   - Introduction of space-awareness

3. Ming gi dbang bskur bas:
   - Sang rgyas kyi sras su bya ba
   - Making Buddha's spiritual son/daughter

These correspond to:
- Dbyings (space): Dharmadhatu
- Rig pa (awareness): Natural knowing
- Lha (deity): Yidam identity

[9185-9210] [CONCEPT] Three-fold Secret Initiation

The secret dimension operates through:
1. Space entry:
   - Dbyings la rig pa gzhug pa
   - Awareness enters space
   - Ground of being recognized

2. Deity introduction:
   - Lha ngo bstan pa
   - Divine identity revealed
   - One's nature as deity

3. Name empowerment:
   - Ming gi dbang bskur

[9211-9236] [PHILOLOGY] Perfection and Non-duality Terminology

The text employs completion vocabulary:
- "Yongs su rdzogs pa" (perfect): Complete, total
- "Phyi" (outer): External dimension
- "Yul" (object): Phenomenal target
- "Dbang po" (sense power): Cognitive faculty
- "Tshigs su bcad" (verse): Poetic formulation

The particle "ni" marks experience: "de'i yongs su rdzogs pa la phyi yul dbang po'i tshigs su bcad pas lung bstan pas shes pa dang yul gnyis med nyams su myong ba'i dbang" (in its perfection, outer object-sense power verse prophecy—empowerment experiencing two, knowing and object, as non-dual). The emphatic "ni" establishes nature.

[9237-9262] [CONTEXT] Three Perfect Dimensions

The three yongs rdzogs (perfect) dimensions:
1. Phyi yul dbang po'i tshigs su bcad pas lung bstan pa:
   - Outer object-sense power verse prophecy
   - Shes pa dang yul gnyis med nyams su myong ba'i dbang
   - Empowerment of experiencing consciousness and object as non-dual

2. Nang sems gsal ba'i tshigs su bcad pas dbugs dbyung ba:
   - Inner clear mind verse breathing-out
   - Skye med ngo gzung dang bral ba'i dbang
   - Empowerment free from birthless recognition and grasping

3. Gsang bzung 'jug ris med kyi tshigs su bcad pas gzengs btod pa:
   - Secret holding-entering without boundary verse praise
   - Dbyings rig gnyis med bde chen gyi dbang bstan pa
   - Empowerment of space-awareness non-dual great bliss

[9263-9288] [CONCEPT] Three-fold Non-dual Perfection

The perfect dimensions culminate in:
1. Subject-object non-duality:
   - Shes pa (consciousness)
   - Yul (object)
   - Gnyis med (non-dual)

2. Recognition-grasping freedom:
   - Ngo gzung (recognition)
   - Dang bral ba (free from)
   - Skye med (birthless)

3. Space-awareness bliss:
   - Dbyings (space)
   - Rig pa (awareness)
   - Bde chen (great bliss)

[STRUCTURE] Thirty-six and Forty-four Accomplishments

[9289-9314] [PHILOLOGY] Numerical Accumulation

The text employs enumerative vocabulary:
- "Bskur bas thob pa" (attainment through empowerment): Fruition
- "'Bras bu" (result): Fruit, consequence
- "Bzhi bcu rtsa bzhi" (forty-four): Complete number
- "Spros bcas" (elaborated): With constructs
- "Spros med" (unelaborated): Without constructs

The particle "ni" marks accumulation: "bskur bas thob pa'i 'bras bu bzhi bcu rtsa bzhi'o" (the result attained through empowerment is forty-four). The emphatic "o" confirms number.

[9315-9340] [CONTEXT] Accumulation Mathematics

The forty-four results from:
- Spros bcas kyi spros bcas: 16 (phyi nang gsang yongs rdzogs bzhi re)
- Spros bcas kyi rab tu spros med: 16 (similar)
- Plus additional accumulations
- Total: 44 accomplishments

Or alternative calculation:
- Base 36 + elaborations = 44
- Complete fruition enumeration

[9341-9366] [CONCEPT] Complete Fruition Framework

The forty-four accomplishments represent:
1. Spros bcas level: 16+ results
   - Conventional attainments
   - Observable qualities
   - Gradual development

2. Spros med level: 16+ results
   - Ultimate realizations
   - Non-observable qualities
   - Sudden recognition

3. Integration:
   - All levels included
   - Complete coverage
   - Total fruition

**Summary:**

Page 224 concludes the elaborate empowerment presentation with outer results and prophecies, perfect dimension non-dual experiences, and thirty-six/forty-four accomplishment enumeration. Philologically, the text employs soteriological vocabulary for prophecy, completion terminology for perfection, and enumerative vocabulary for accumulation. Contextual sources include standard abhisheka structures, non-dual yoga systems, and tantric fruition enumeration. Conceptually, the section demonstrates three secret dimensions of space entry, deity introduction, and name empowerment, three perfect dimensions culminating in subject-object non-duality and space-awareness bliss, and complete forty-four accomplishment framework—all representing elaborated empowerment as comprehensive transformation from ordinary being to realized master through systematic purification and recognition.
