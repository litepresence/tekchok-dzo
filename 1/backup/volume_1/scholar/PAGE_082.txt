================================================================================
[STRUCTURE] Architectural Mapping and Divisions
================================================================================

[3022-3048] [STRUCTURE] This page completes the Cittamātra presentation and transitions to Svātantrika Madhyamaka. The structural progression follows:

1. **Lines 3022-3027**: Completion of Pure Appearance (dri med dag pa ba) position—explaining how afflictions mixed with wisdom are removed to reveal pure non-dual wisdom

2. **Lines 3028-3034**: Elaboration of Pure Appearance view—appearances and consciousness have no true establishment even conventionally

3. **Lines 3035-3048**: Transition to Svātantrika Madhyamaka (dbu ma pa la rang rgyud pa), which further refutes Cittamātra's residual subtle realism

**Doxographical Architecture**:
- Cittamātra completes with assertion of self-cognizing wisdom as ultimately existent
- Svātantrika refutes even this residual essentialism
- Within Svātantrika, two branches introduced:
  * Illusion-like Ultimate (sgyu ma don dam du 'dod pa)
  * Complete Non-abiding (rab tu mi gnas pa)

[CONTEXT] Citations, History, and Doxography
================================================================================

[3022-3027] [CONTEXT] **Pure Appearance School (dri med dag pa ba)**: This sub-school of False Aspectarian Cittamātra holds that when the false portion of afflictions mixed with wisdom is removed, what remains is pure non-dual wisdom. This position is associated with Sthiramati (blo brtan) and some commentarial traditions. The "remainder" (lhag ma) refers to subtle traces of dualistic perception that persist even for āryas until Buddhahood.

[3024-3025] [CONTEXT] **Residual Defilements**: The examples of taste (ro) and sickness (rgyab snyung) illustrate how subtle defilements remain in advanced practitioners. The *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* and its commentaries discuss how āryas on the path still have subtle obscurations to be removed. These are not coarse afflictions but subtle habits of dualistic perception.

[3028-3034] [CONTEXT] **The Reflection (gzugs brnyan) Simile**: This is the key simile for the Pure Appearance view. Just as a reflection in a mirror appears clearly but has no substantial existence, so do all appearances arise while being empty of true existence. This differs from the "with stains" view which sees appearances as defiled; the pure view sees appearances themselves as naturally pure reflections.

[3035] [CONTEXT] **Svātantrika Madhyamaka (dbu ma rang rgyud pa)**: Founded by Bhāvaviveka (legs ldan 'byed, c. 500-570 CE) as a response to Dignāga's epistemology. The Svātantrikas accept that conventionally, things exist with their own characteristics (svalakṣaṇa), but ultimately they are empty of inherent existence. Key figures: Bhāvaviveka, Kamalaśīla, Śāntarakṣita.

[3037] [CONTEXT] **Svātantrika vs. Cittamātra**: The Svātantrika critique targets the Cittamātra assertion that self-cognizing wisdom ultimately exists. Svātantrikas argue that even this "ultimate" consciousness is empty of inherent existence. This represents a crucial shift from "mind-only" to "emptiness-of-all-phenomena."

[3038-3044] [CONTEXT] **Illusion-like Ultimate (sgyu ma don dam)**: This branch of Svātantrika (associated with later Bhāvaviveka followers) holds that the ultimate truth is like an illusion—it appears but has no true existence. This preserves the validity of conventional appearance while denying ultimate reality. The meditation on illusion-like appearance becomes the path to realizing emptiness.

[3045-3048] [CONTEXT] **Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Citation**: This famous verse appears in the "Middle" Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra (8000 lines). It establishes the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—both are dream-like and illusion-like. This sūtra, composed around 100 BCE - 100 CE, is the earliest Prajñāpāramitā text and foundational for all Mahāyāna philosophy.

[CONCEPT] Breaking Down Complex Ideas
================================================================================

[3022-3027] [CONCEPT] **Wisdom Mixed with Afflictions**: The text describes a profound condition: in ordinary beings, non-dual wisdom (ye shes) is present but mixed with afflictions (nyon mongs pa), like milk mixed with water. The defilements are not separate from wisdom—they are adventitious (glo bur) obscurations that cover the naturally pure nature.

**The Process of Purification**: The false portion (rdzun pa ba'i cha) of this mixture is removed, revealing the pure wisdom that was always there. This is not a "creation" of wisdom but a "revealing" of what was obscured. Like cleaning a dirty mirror—the mirror's reflective nature was never lost, only covered.

**With Remainder (lhag bcas)**: During the path, subtle traces remain—like the lingering taste of medicine or the residual effects of past sickness. These are not coarse defilements but subtle habits of dualistic perception that persist until Buddhahood.

[3028-3034] [CONCEPT] **The Pure Appearance View Explained**: This is one of the most subtle positions in Buddhist philosophy. It holds that:

1. All appearances (colors, forms, objects) are like reflections in a mirror
2. They appear clearly (gsal snang) — we cannot deny our experience
3. But they have no true existence (med bzhin du snang) — they are empty
4. The only thing that ultimately exists is self-cognizing wisdom

**The Mirror Analogy**: A mirror reflects your face. The reflection appears—it's not nothing. But does the reflection have true existence? Can you grasp it? Does it exist independently of the mirror and your face? The Pure Appearance view says: all phenomena are like this reflection—appearing but empty.

**Key Distinction**: Unlike the "with stains" view which sees appearances as defiled projections, the pure view sees appearances as naturally pure. The problem is not the appearances themselves but our grasping at them as truly existent.

[3035-3044] [CONCEPT] **The Svātantrika Revolution**: This is a watershed moment in Buddhist philosophy. The Svātantrikas say: "You Cittamātrins claim that self-cognizing wisdom is ultimately real. But we ask: does this wisdom exist inherently? If it truly exists (truly ultimate), it must have inherent existence. But inherent existence cannot be found!"

**The Three Natures Revisited**: The Cittamātra uses the three natures (trisvabhāva):
1. Imagined nature (parikalpita) — totally unreal
2. Dependent nature (paratantra) — conventionally real  
3. Perfected nature (pariniṣpanna) — ultimately real

Svātantrika says: Even the perfected nature is empty of inherent existence. The ultimate truth is not a "thing" that exists.

**Illusion-like Ultimate**: The Svātantrika proposes that the ultimate truth is like an illusion (sgyu ma). It appears (we have valid cognition of emptiness), but it has no inherent existence. This preserves the validity of appearance while denying essence.

[3045-3048] [CONCEPT] **The Equivalence of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa**: The Aṣṭasāhasrikā verse is revolutionary: even nirvāṇa is dream-like and illusion-like. This means:

1. There's no ultimately real nirvāṇa to attain
2. There's no ultimately real saṃsāra to escape from
3. The distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is conventional, not ultimate
4. Liberation is not a "place" or "state" but the recognition of the nature of appearance

**Why This Matters**: If nirvāṇa were truly existent, it would be a permanent phenomenon (śāśvata). If saṃsāra were truly non-existent, it would be nihilism (uccheda). The Middle Way avoids both extremes by showing the equivalence of appearance and emptiness in both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.

**The Dream Analogy Applied**: When you wake from a dream, the dream-horse and dream-ox cease. But did they "go" somewhere? No—they never truly existed. Similarly, when wisdom dawns, saṃsāra doesn't "go" somewhere—it is seen to have never truly existed. This is not nihilism because the appearance is valid conventionally; it's just not ultimately real.
