**PAGE SUMMARY:**
Page 369 continues channel practice instructions from 368, completing the four-element meditation and detailing seven channel manipulation techniques. The diagnostic system uses quantitative channel movement (64,800/day baseline) to assess health, lifespan, karma, and spiritual progress. The integration of medical diagnostics (wind/bile/phlegm) with yogic wisdom-temporal analysis exemplifies Tibetan Buddhism's synthetic approach to somatic spirituality.
