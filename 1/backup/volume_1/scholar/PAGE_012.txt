[351-355] [STRUCTURE] # The Four Outer Mind Activities
**Analysis:** The outer mind activities (*thugs kyi phyi'i mdzad pa*) are described through four specific samādhis:

1. **Non-composite clear samādhi** (*'du mi byed pa gsal ba'i ting nge 'dzin*) — knowing action and conceptual action
2. **Pure wisdom view samādhi** (*ye shes kyi mthong ba dag pa'i ting nge 'dzin*) — equipoise knowledge perfected
3. **Pure dharmatā samādhi** (*chos nyid rnam par dag pa'i ting nge 'dzin*) — knowing general and specific characteristics
4. **Exhausted defilements samādhi** (*zag pa zad pa'i ting nge 'dzin*) — pure play perfected

The phrase *mngon par 'du mi byed pa* (non-composite/not mentally constructed) refers to the *nirvikalpa* state in Yogācāra—the direct perception of reality without conceptual elaboration.

[351-355] [CONTEXT] # The Four Samādhis in Mahāyāna Sources
**Analysis:** These four samādhis derive from multiple sources:
- **Prajñāpāramitā sūtras:** The samādhi of non-attachment
- **Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra:** The samādhi of self-realization
- **Yogācārabhūmi:** Systematic classification of samādhi types
- **Dzogchen tantras:** Natural samādhi beyond cultivation

Longchenpa's presentation integrates these into the three-kāya framework, showing how each samādhi serves a specific pedagogical function.

[351-355] [PHILOLOGY] The Instrumental Construction *kyis*
**Analysis:** The repeated use of *kyis* (instrumental particle) indicates that samādhi is the MEANS of accomplishing each activity. The construction *bya dang rtog pa'i mdzad pa mkhyen par mdzad* uses *par* with the verb to create a resultative construction: "causes the knowing of activity and thought." This establishes samādhi as instrumental cause (*saṃprayayika-hetu*) rather than material cause.

[356-360] [CONCEPT] The Five Wisdoms at the Inner Level
**Analysis:** The inner activities (*nang gi bzhi*) present four of the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*):

1. **Mirror-like wisdom** (*me long lta bu'i ye shes*) — enjoyment of examples/analogies (*dpe*)
2. **Wisdom of sameness** (*mnyam pa nyid kyi ye shes*) — enjoyment of meaning (*don*)
3. **Discriminating wisdom** (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes*) — enjoyment through sense-faculties
4. **All-accomplishing wisdom** (*bya ba grub pa'i ye shes*) — enjoyment separate from/things (*chos dang bral ba*)

The standard fifth wisdom—Dharmadhātu wisdom (*chos dkyil gyi ye shes*)—is implied as the ground from which these four function. The instrumental *kyis* indicates that these wisdoms are the means by which enjoyment occurs.

[356-360] [CONTEXT] # The Five Wisdoms in Buddhist Tantra
**Analysis:** The five wisdoms (*pañca-jñāna*) systematize enlightened cognition:
- **Śrāvakayāna:** Five wisdoms not explicitly taught
- **Yogācāra:** Five wisdoms as transformation of five skandhas
- **Tantra:** Five wisdoms as five buddhas in maṇḍala
- **Dzogchen:** Five wisdoms as spontaneous display of rigpa

The *me long* (mirror) metaphor indicates that these wisdoms reflect all phenomena without modification, like a mirror reflecting images without being changed by them.

[361-365] [CONCEPT] The Four Secret Mind Activities: Non-dual Pairs
**Analysis:** The secret level presents four non-dual (*dbyer med*) abidings that dissolve dualistic fixations:

1. **Clarity-emptiness non-dual** (*gsal stong dbyer med*) — clears saṃsāra-nirvāṇa duality (*'khor 'das gnyis med*)
2. **Appearance-emptiness non-dual** (*snang stong dbyer med*) — performs object-wisdom non-duality (*yul shes gnyis med*)
3. **Awareness-emptiness non-dual** (*rig stong dbyer med*) — performs apprehension-apprehender non-duality (*gzung 'dzin gnyis med*)
4. **Object-mind non-dual** (*yul sems dbyer med*) — cuts the conceptual limit (*rtog mtha'*) of subject-object

This is the heart of Dzogchen view: all apparent dualities resolve in the recognition of non-duality. The term *mtha' chod* (cutting the limit/extreme) refers to transcending both eternalism and nihilism—the two extremes (*mtha' gnyis*) in Madhyamaka dialectic.

[361-365] [PHILOLOGY] The Term *dbyer med*
**Analysis:** The compound *dbyer med* (without difference/non-dual) combines *dbyer* (difference/distinction) with the negative *med*. This is more precise than *gnyis med* (without two), indicating not merely the absence of two but the impossibility of making distinctions. The particle *du* in *bzhugs pas* creates a continuative: "through abiding in the state of..."

[366-369] [STRUCTURE] # Transition to Nirmāṇakāya: The Third Kāya
**Analysis:** The text transitions (*gsum pa* = third) to the emanation-body (*sprul pa'i sku*) and its wheel-turning method (*'khor lo bskor ba'i tshul*). The enumeration "twelve earth teachers in twelve abodes" (*gnas ris bcu gnyis sa ston pa bcu gnyis*) refers to the standard presentation of twelve major Buddha-fields or the twelve deeds of a Buddha. The "five-five perfections" (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga lnga*) indicates that each teacher possesses all five perfections.

[366-369] [CONTEXT] # The Twelve Emanations
**Analysis:** The twelve emanations (*sprul pa bcu gnyis*) represent:
- **Twelve aspects of Buddhahood:** Pervading all directions and times
- **Twelve links of dependent origination:** Transformed into twelvefold wisdom
- **Twelve classes of scripture:** (alternative interpretation)
- **Zodiacal symbolism:** Twelve houses or months

In Nyingma doxography, the twelve emanations demonstrate that enlightened activity is omni-directional and omni-temporal.

[370-372] [CONTEXT] # The Threefold Emanation Structure
**Analysis:** The text presents three modes of emanation activity:

1. **Dharmakāya teaching** (*chos sku'i bstan pa*) — Great Perfection blessing, self-arisen, through Vajra Amitāyus (*rdo rje tshe lha*)
2. **Saṃbhogakāya teaching** (*longs sku'i bstan pa*) — Self-arisen teaching, single son's blessing, through letters and books
3. **Nirmāṇakāya teaching** — Implied continuation

This threefold structure (*sku gsum*) represents the complete pedagogical manifestation: the teaching exists as blessing (Dharmakāya), as scripture (Saṃbhogakāya), and as physical teacher (Nirmāṇakāya). The phrase "filling the hands of people" (*mi rnams kyi phyag gang ba*) indicates direct transmission—the teachings being held, practiced, and embodied.

[370-372] [PHILOLOGY] The Particle *las* as Blessing Source
**Analysis:** The phrase *byin rlabs las rang shar* (self-arisen from blessing) uses *las* to indicate origin. This establishes blessing (*adhiṣṭhāna*) as the source of manifestation rather than conventional causation. The term *rang 'khrungs* (self-born) emphasizes non-dependence on parents or conditions, paralleling the Buddha's "miraculous birth" (*upapāduka*) in mainstream Buddhism.

[370-372] [CONCEPT] The Hundred and One Jewels
**Analysis:** The "hundred and one jewels" (*rin po che brgya rtsa gcig*) likely refers to:
- **One hundred:** Completion, fullness
- **Plus one:** Transcendence of completion
- **Alternative:** 100 peaceful + 1 wrathful deities
- **Numerological:** 101 = divine number in various traditions

These serve as the causal basis (*rgyu*) for the self-arisen manifestations, though causality here must be understood conventionally: the jewels are conditions rather than true causes in the Madhyamaka sense.
