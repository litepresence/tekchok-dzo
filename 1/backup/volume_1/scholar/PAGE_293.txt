[12193-12226] [STRUCTURE] Sentient Beings' Delusion: Third Major Topic
This section presents the third major topic: "The delusion mode of sentient beings through non-recognition" (don gsum pa ma rig pa sems can gyi 'khrul tshul, 12205). The structure: (1) original basis without delusion (thog ma'i gzhi la 'khrul pa med kyang, 12206); (2) delusion arising when basis-manifestation appears without self-recognition (gzhi snang du shar dus rang ngo ma rig pa'i shes pa lung ma bstan pa rig pa'i rtsa ba can des, 12207); (3) individuation through division producing sentient being delusion (gzhi snang la ris su bcad pas sems can du 'khrul te, 12208). Scriptural citations: (1) *Mu tig 'phreng ba* (Pearl Garland, 12209-12214): from great distinctive appearance, existence/non-existence arise, called common ground of delusion, obscured by non-recognition, knowables appear as defilements; (2) "Dharmakāya like space" citation (12216-12221): sudden sentient beings obscure with clouds, non-deluded dharmatā appears as deluded mode to mind; (3) *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (Vajrasattva Heart Mirror, 12222-12226): all three realm beings delude from basis that is nothing into everything.

[12193-12226] [PHILOLOGY] Delusion Syntax and Citation Markers
Key grammatical constructions: (1) Contrastive kyang with negation: 'khrul pa med kyang (without delusion, yet..., 12206); (2) Temporal dus with locative: shar dus (when arisen, 12207); (3) Instrumental des marking agency: des (by that [non-recognition], 12207); (4) Terminative du with delusion: sems can du 'khrul te (deluded into sentient being, 12208); (5) Citation formula las: mu tig 'phreng ba las; (6) *Mu tig 'phreng ba* citation: yod dang med pa gnyis byung ste (existence and non-existence arise, 12211), spyi sa 'khrul gzhi (common ground of delusion, 12212), ma rig nyid dang sbags pa'i phyir (because obscured by non-recognition itself, 12213), shes bya nyid kyang dri mar snang (even knowables appear as defilements, 12214); (7) Dharmakāya citation: glo bur sems can sprin gyis bsgrib (sudden sentient beings obscure with clouds, 12217), ma 'khrul pa yi chos nyid kyang (even non-deluded dharmatā, 12218), blo la 'khrul pa'i tshul du snang (appears as deluded mode to mind, 12219).

[12193-12226] [CONTEXT] Pearl Garland, Heart Mirror, and Cloud-Space Metaphor
The passage draws on: (1) *Mu tig 'phreng ba* (Pearl Garland), major Dzogchen tantra in Sems sde (Mind Series) tradition, presenting cosmogonic emergence of duality from non-dual appearance; (2) Cloud-space metaphor: dharmakāya as space, non-recognition as clouds, sentient beings as obscuration - pervasive in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism; (3) *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (Vajrasattva Heart Mirror Tantra, 12222-12226): "All three realm sentient beings delude from basis that is nothing whatsoever into everything whatsoever" (gzhi ci yang ma yin pa las cir yang 'khrul lo) - establishes that delusion arises from empty ground through misrecognition; (4) Three characteristics of basis: essence as emptiness (ngo bo stong pa), nature as clarity (rang bzhin gyis gsal ba), compassion as appearing-power (thugs rje sems can la snang nus pa, 12227); (5) Apprehending cognition ('dzin byed kyi shes pa, 12228) arises from non-recognition's aspect, producing slight delusion (breng tsam) and dualistic cognition.

[12193-12226] [CONCEPT] Delusion as Adventitious Failure of Recognition
The philosophical framework: (1) Basis is absolutely without delusion - delusion is not inherent in ground; (2) Delusion arises only when basis-manifestation (gzhi snang) appears without self-recognition; (3) Neutral awareness (lung ma bstan pa) with root in awareness (rig pa'i rtsa ba can) is pivotal moment - neither fully deluded nor fully enlightened; (4) Individuation through division (ris su bcad pa) produces error: objectifying manifestation as "other" rather than recognizing as own-display; (5) Cloud metaphor: clouds (non-recognition) temporarily obscure space (dharmakāya) without affecting space's nature; (6) From nothing (ci yang ma yin) to everything (cir yang 'khrul) - the mysterious emergence of multiplicity through misrecognition; (7) Apprehending cognition wonders: "Did awareness arise from me or not from me?" (pha gi las nga byung ngam/nga las pha gi byung) - the fundamental error of grasping at self/other; (8) Non-recognition exists in mode/appearance, not basis - preserving ground's purity.
