[9672-9685] [STRUCTURE] Completion of Empowerment Superknowledges and Transitions to Samaya

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage completes the enumeration of superknowledges (*mngon shes*) arising from empowerments and transitions to the presentation of samaya (*dam tshig*). The organizational arc: (1) elaboration-with empowerments produce 180 clairvoyances, (2) elaboration-without empowerments produce 360 qualities, (3) totals reach 2,360 ground qualities + 660 wisdom actions + 3,120 dharmic synonyms, (4) colophon marking end of 6th section, (5) introduction to samaya as the crucial basis for Vajrayana practice.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *spros bcas kyi dbang* (elaboration-with empowerment), *spros med kyi dbang* (elaboration-without empowerment), *rab tu spros pa med pa'i dbang* (completely elaboration-without empowerment), *brgya brgyad cu* (one hundred eighty), *thos pa rnam par dag pa'i mngon shes* (clairvoyance of purified hearing), *bsgyur gzhi'i don shes pa* (knowing the meaning of transformation-basis), *ye shes su dag pa* (purified as wisdom), *myong byed dag pa* (purified experiencer), *reg byed dag pa* (purified toucher), *mdo shes pa* (sutra-knowing), *chos dag pa'i mngon shes* (clairvoyance of purified dharma).

- **[CONTEXT]** The numerical system reflects tantric numerology: 180 + 180 + 180 + 180 = 720; plus previous sets reaching 2,360 ground qualities, 660 wisdom actions, 3,120 dharmic categories. These constitute "Vajradhara's ground-clairvoyance transformations" (*rdo rje 'chang gi sa'i mngon shes kyi rnam par 'phrul ba*). The progression moves from elaborated (elaboration-with) to unelaborated (elaboration-without) to completely unelaborated empowerments, reflecting the Dzogchen trajectory from coarse to subtle.

- **[CONCEPT]** This section presents the soteriological mathematics of empowerment: each level of purification (hearing, thinking, experiencing, touching, dharma) produces 180 clairvoyances. The distinction between elaboration-with/without reflects the tantric hermeneutic of progressive refinement—from conceptual (*spros bcas*) to non-conceptual (*spros med*) to completely non-conceptual (*rab tu spros pa med*). The colophon marks this as the first door of Secret Mantra Vajra Vehicle's crucial basis.

[9686-9703] [CONTEXT] Colophon and Introduction to Samaya Presentation

**Analysis:**
- **[CONTEXT]** Standard colophon formula: *Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod las / gzhi'i don smin par byed pa dang dbang gi rnam par gzhag pa ste rim khang drug pa'o*—"From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the presentation of ripening the meaning of the basis and empowerment, the sixth section." This marks the closure of the empowerment chapter and pivot to samaya (*dam tshig*).

- **[STRUCTURE]** The samaya presentation is organized into three topics: (1) samaya nature generally demonstrated, (2) body-speech-mind samaya specifically explained, (3) unsurpassable samaya supreme demonstrated. First topic has eight subdivisions: essence, definite-term, division, support, benefit, fault, repair-method, protect-method.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *gzhi'i don smin par byed pa* (ripening the meaning of the basis), *dbang gi rnam par gzhag pa* (empowerment presentation), *rim khang drug pa* (sixth section), *dam tshig* (samaya/sacred pledge), *nges tshig* (definite-term), *rten* (support), *phan yon* (benefit), *nyes dmigs* (fault), *bskang thabs* (repair-method), *bsrung thabs* (protect-method), *sngags kyi sdom pas rgyud bsdams pa'i gnyen po'i dpung* (antidote army binding continuum by mantra vow).

- **[CONCEPT]** Samaya is defined as the non-emitting (*mi mda' bar byed pa*) through the antidote army binding the continuum by mantra vow. This reflects the Vajrayana understanding of samaya as active engagement (*dam tshig*)—not mere restraint but empowered commitment. The eightfold analysis (essence, term, division, support, benefit, fault, repair, protection) provides comprehensive coverage of samaya theory and practice.

- **[STRUCTURE]** The transition from empowerment to samaya follows tantric logic: empowerment (*dbang*) transmits authority; samaya (*dam tshig*) maintains that transmission through commitment. The phrase *bla na med pa gsang sngags kyi sgor zhugs so cog la dam tshig kho na gal che*—"for all who enter the door of unsurpassable Secret Mantra, samaya alone is crucial"—emphasizes the centrality of sacred commitment.
