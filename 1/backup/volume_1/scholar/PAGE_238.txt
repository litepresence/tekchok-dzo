[9623-9642] [STRUCTURE] Thirty-Two Major Marks and Wisdom Superknowledges

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** This passage establishes: (1) thirty-two major marks (*mtshan sum cu rtsa gnyis*) arise from thirty-two empowerments, (2) wisdom-view superknowledges (*ye shes kyi mthong ba rnam par dag pa'i mngon shes*) in sets of six, (3) thirty wisdom superknowledges from thirty-two empowerments.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *mtshan sum cu rtsa gnyis grub pa* (thirty-two marks complete), *shes rab kyi mthong ba rnam par dag pa'i mngon par shes pa drug* (six superknowledges of purified wisdom-view), *sbyangs pa'i shes rab* (trained wisdom), *bslab pa'i shes rab* (learned wisdom), *thos pa'i shes rab* (heard wisdom), *bsam byung gi shes rab* (thought-arisen wisdom), *sgom byung gi shes rab* (meditation-arisen wisdom), *tshig thams cad kyi brda don* (symbol-meaning of all words), *sems nyid chos nyid la 'jug pa* (mind itself entering dharmatā).

- **[CONCEPT]** The thirty-two major marks (major and minor marks of a Buddha) arise from thirty-two empowerments, establishing the somatic dimension of empowerment's effect. The wisdom-view superknowledges operate through five wisdom-types: (1) trained wisdom—understanding symbol-meaning of all words, (2) learned wisdom—special arising of entering dharmatā, (3) heard wisdom—knowing all sound and meaning, (4) thought-arisen wisdom—realizing aggregates of all dharmas, (5) meditation-arisen wisdom—knowing dharmas and mind mixed like sky. These thirty (6 × 5) arise from viewing the thirty-two qualities trained by Buddha.

**Analysis:**
- **[CONTEXT]** Extended citation of the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) each producing six superknowledges: (1) mirror-like wisdom, (2) equality wisdom, (3) discriminating wisdom, (4) accomplishing wisdom, (5) dharmadhātu wisdom, (6) non-abiding wisdom.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *me long lta bu'i ye shes* (mirror-like wisdom), *mnyam pa nyid* (equality), *so sor rtog pa* (discriminating), *bya ba grub pa* (accomplishing), *chos kyi dbyings* (dharmadhātu), *mi gnas pa'i ye shes* (non-abiding wisdom), *ye shes kyi mig* (wisdom eye), *rdul med dri ma dang bral ba* (dustless and without defilement), *chos kyi mtshan nyid dang dgongs pa* (dharma's characteristic and intention), *'khor 'das gnyis su med pa* (samsara-nirvana non-dual), *'gro ba drug gi dbang po* (six migrations' sense-powers), *sangs rgyas kyi zhing khams* (Buddha-fields), *sangs rgyas kyi yon tan* (Buddha-qualities), *chos gang la yang mi gnas pa* (non-abiding in any dharma).

- **[CONCEPT]** Each of the five wisdoms produces six superknowledges:
  - **Mirror-like:** knowing dharma characteristics and intentions directly
  - **Equality:** knowing samsara-nirvana as non-dual
  - **Discriminating:** knowing six migrations' sense-powers
  - **Accomplishing:** knowing all dharmas effortless and all Buddha-fields
  - **Dharmadhātu:** knowing all Buddha-qualities
  - **Non-abiding:** knowing non-abiding in any dharma
  
  The "wisdom eye" (*ye shes kyi mig*) is obtained—dustless and without defilement. These thirty wisdom superknowledges arise from thirty-two empowerments.

[9642] [STRUCTURE] Liberation Superknowledges Introduced

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Line 9642: *de rnam par grol ba'i mngon shes drug 'char te*—"From that, six liberation superknowledges arise." This marks the transition to the next major set of superknowledges (completed on page 239).

- **[CONCEPT]** The pattern establishes: each "view" (wisdom-view, liberation-view, reality-view, body-speech-mind view) produces six superknowledges, organized in sets of thirty. The numerical structure reflects tantric numerology: 32 empowerments → 30 superknowledges (with remainder 2), building toward the total of 180.
