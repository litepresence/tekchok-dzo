[2284-2315] [CONTEXT] Ascetic Practices and Eternalist Views
**Analysis:**

**Extreme Ascetic Practices:**

The text describes various forms of physical mortification mistaken as spiritual paths:

**Body Mortification:**
- Flesh mirrors (*sha'i me long*)—using one's body as reflective surface
- Shoulder, right, left, head, crown peel remove—systematic mutilation
- Earth hole placement—burying oneself
- Cemetery dwelling with worms—corpse-like existence

**Mimetic Practices:**
- Animal conduct (*srog chags kyi spyod pa*)
- Dog conduct (*khyi yi spyod pa*)—emulating animal behavior

**Agent-Cause View:**

Some hold (*byed pa rgyur smra ba*):
- Like skilled carpenter, man, woman do different actions
- Own clairvoyance, fortune, lordship determine birth
- Path consists of carrying agents (*byed pa lam du 'khyer ba*)

**Permanent Meaning Views:**

The text enumerates variations on eternalism:

1. **Great Permanent Meaning** (*rtag pa don mtshon chen po*):
   - Permanent, eternal (*ther zug*)
   - Unchanging (*'gyur med*)
   - Great nature not-definite

2. **Occasion-Based Permanence** (*gnas skabs rtag pa*):
   - Meaning changes on occasion
   - View of permanence regarding the occasion

3. **Cause as Permanent** (*rgyu la rtag pa*):
   - Causes are permanent
   - Results are permanent

[2316-2323] [CONCEPT] Eternalist Conduct Views
**Analysis:**

**Conduct as Permanent:**

Some practitioners wish to abide upon the path:
- Regarding conduct as permanent (*spyod pa rtag par 'dod pa*)
- Yet seeing cause and result as impermanent
- Taking conduct as permanent to seek liberation
- Viewing objects, homes, houses as permanent
- All appearances as eternal

**Critique:** This represents a fundamental confusion—seeking liberation through permanence while denying the permanence of causality.

**Nihilist Position:**

Those who view permanence where it does not exist are nihilists (*chad par smra ba*). They enact the tenet of permanence upon "this very ground" (*sa 'dir*), meaning they grasp at permanence in the midst of impermanence.
