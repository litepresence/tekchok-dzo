[1865-1867] [CONTEXT] Chapter Transition
**Analysis:**

The text marks the completion of the second major section with a citation from the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra: *de kun 'khor ba'i rgyu 'ba' zhig lags* — "all of these are merely the causes of samsara." This establishes that the preceding analysis of aggregates, elements, sense sources, and faculties serves as the foundation for understanding cyclic existence.

[1868-1880] [STRUCTURE] Chapter III: Detailed Division of Samsaric Phenomena
**Analysis:**

The chapter heading establishes the scope: *'khor ba'i chos rab tu dbye ba ste rim khang gsum pa* — "The detailed division of samsaric phenomena—third chapter."

**Epistemological Framework:**

Longchenpa introduces the vehicle classification (*theg pa'i rnam grangs*) with authority from the *Rig pa rang shar chen po'i rgyud* (Great Tantra of Self-Arisen Awareness):

```
Hold the secret vajra!
My vehicle is immeasurable.
It gathers all modes of explanation into two:
Samsara and nirvana.
```

**Two-fold Division:**

1. **Worldly Vehicle** (*'jig rten pa'i theg pa*)
2. **Transcendent Vehicle** (*'jig rten las 'das pa'i theg pa*)

[1881-1897] [CONCEPT] The Worldly Vehicle Analysis
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa applies the fivefold analysis (*lnga*) to the worldly vehicle:

**1. Essence (*ngo bo*):**
*'khor ba las mi 'phags pa'i yid dpyod kyi rnam grangs* — "the enumerations of mental investigation that do not transcend samsara"

**2. Definition (*nges tshig*):**
*'jig rten gyi legs par tsam la sbyor zhing 'god pa* — "engaging and establishing merely the excellence of the world"

**3. Division (*dbye na*):**
- *sor bzhag* — Fixated vehicle
- *phyin ci log* — Mistaken vehicle

**4. Purpose (*dgos pa*):**
*rang rang gi 'bras bu 'grub par byed pa* — "accomplishing one's own results"

**5. Result (*'bras bu*):**
The manifestation of one's particular result at a certain time

**The Fixated Vehicle of Gods and Humans:**

Longchenpa references the *Rdo rje sems dpa' sgyu 'phrul drwa chen po* (Great Magical Net of Vajrasattva):
*theg pa sna pa lha dang mi'i theg pa'o* — "the earlier vehicle is the vehicle of gods and humans"

This vehicle accumulates merit (*bsod nams*) through:
- Ten virtues (*dge ba bcu*)
- Ethical discipline (*gso sbyong*)
- Merit-compatible actions (*bsod nams cha mthun*)

**Technical Term:** *sor bzhag* (fixated/established separately) indicates that this vehicle establishes samsara as the basis (*rten*) without transcending it.

[1898-1901] [PHILOLOGY] Transition to Mistaken Vehicles
**Analysis:**

The text transitions to *phyin ci log gi theg pa* (mistaken vehicles), citing the *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen Tantra) as the authoritative source. These represent the non-Buddhist (*mu stegs*) philosophical systems that grasp at erroneous views.
