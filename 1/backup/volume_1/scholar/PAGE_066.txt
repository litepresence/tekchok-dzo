[2356-2391] [CONTEXT] Tirthika Classifications
**Analysis:**

**Mistaken Mind Views:**

Some declare:
- Severing life-force through mistaken mind (*log pa'i sems kyis srog chad*)
- From severing life-force, meaning arises
- Severance is emptiness—you and I are severed
- Therefore nothing exists

**Secret Vedas Positions:**

The "knowers speak secretly" (*rig byed gsang bar smra ba*):
- Meaning, like space, is emptiness
- Completely severed
- Existent as entity, nonexistent
- Slight parts exist, suitable for appearance to faculties

**Tirthika Typology:**

Those deviating from consistency (*cha mthun gol ba*) are called tirthikas.

**Buddhist Deviations:**

Buddhists deviating from consistency with Buddhists—merely flesh deviating through wrong tenet.

**Manifest Mind Views:**

Some declare:
- "Manifest appearance is mind's magic"
- All is magic (*sgyu ma*)
- These mistaken appearances are true because ultimate meaning is nonexistent

**Anger Producers:**

Some declare:
- Anger arising finishes spirits (*gdon*)
- Clan-sons should dwell in anger

**Activity and Mind Views:**

Some declare:
- This mind is self-arisen, thus uncorrectable
- Relying solely on meditating deity-body is sufficient

**Named Teachers:**

The text names specific proponents:
- **Kani-pa** (*ka ni pa*) — those wishing meaning indifferently
- **Sersnawa** (*ser sna ba*) — possessed of suffering, fearing diminished appearances
- **Sambhari** (*sam bha ri*)
- **Kabhisha** (*ka bhi sha*) — neither special nor common meaning exists
- **Sindha** (*sin dha*) — common meaning nonexistent, special meaning exists
- **Dhasimba** (*dha sim ba*) — meaning utterly nonexistent
- **Katipa** (*ka ti pa*) — meaning exists
- **Sangha** (*sang gha*) — until breath is cut, meaning persists
- **Shamkari** (*shang ka ri*)
- **Doshaka** (*do sha ka*)
