[8939-8964] [STRUCTURE] Mind Defilements: Fourfold Conceptual Patterns

This section presents the defilements of yid (intellect) and sems (mind), establishing the fourfold conceptual patterns that obscure direct recognition. The structure moves from discursive thought through attachment patterns, revealing how mental processes create obscurations.

[8939-8956] [PHILOLOGY] Conceptual and Mnemonic Terminology

The text employs cognitive vocabulary:
- "Yid" (intellect): Analytical mind
- "'Gyur ba" (change): Mental transformation
- "Dran bsam" (memory-thought): Recollection and consideration
- "Rtog pa" (conceptuality): Discursive thought
- "Dri ma" (defilement): Obscuration

The particle "ni" marks defilement: "yang yid 'gyur ba la'ang 'gyur ba dran bsam gyi rtog pa'i dri ma" (moreover, in intellect's change, the defilement of change-memory-thought's conceptuality). The emphatic "ni" establishes classification.

[8957-8982] [CONTEXT] Four Mind Defilements

The four mind defilements:
1. 'Gyur ba dran bsam gyi rtog pa'i dri ma:
   - Change-memory-thought conceptuality
   - Mental agitation

2. 'Gyur byed yul dang shes pa'i dri ma:
   - Changer-object and consciousness defilement
   - Subject-object duality

3. 'Gyus pa bag chags sna phyi'i dri ma:
   - Changed-latency former-latter defilement
   - Temporal sequencing

4. 'Gyus pa dngos la zhen pa'i dri ma:
   - Changed-thing attachment defilement
   - Grasping at results

[8983-9008] [CONCEPT] Temporal-Spatial Conceptual Defilements

The four defilements operate through:
1. Temporal processing:
   - Dran (memory): Past-oriented
   - Bsam (thought): Present-oriented
   - Rtog pa (concept): Future-oriented

2. Subject-object structure:
   - 'Gyur byed (changer): Subject
   - Yul (object): Object
   - Shes pa (consciousness): Perception

3. Latency accumulation:
   - Bag chags (latencies): Stored impressions
   - Sna phyi (former-latter): Sequential ordering
   - Accumulation over time

4. Grasping fixation:
   - 'Gyus pa (changed): Result state
   - Dngos (thing): Reified existence
   - Zhen pa (attachment): Binding emotion

[STRUCTURE] Sems Defilements: Fourfold Cognitive Patterns

[9009-9034] [PHILOLOGY] Consciousness and Projection Terminology

The text employs storehouse vocabulary:
- "Sems" (mind): Basic consciousness
- "Dran pa" (memory): Recollection function
- "Yul 'jug pa" (entering objects): Engagement with phenomena
- "Lung bstan" (prophecy): Predictive function
- "Ma bstan" (not prophesied): Uncertain future

The particle "ni" marks defilement: "yang sems kyi dran pas yul 'jug pa'i dri ma" (moreover, mind's memory's entering-objects defilement). The additive "yang" indicates continuation.

[9035-9060] [CONTEXT] Four Sems Defilements

The four sems (kun gzhi rnam shes pa) defilements:
1. Dran pas yul 'jug pa:
   - Memory entering objects
   - Past impressions activating

2. Bsam pas dge mi dge lung bstan ma bstan bzhi ka kun nas slong ba:
   - Thought's virtuous/non-virtuous prophecy/non-prophecy all completely projected
   - Moral evaluation

3. Rtog pas snyam byed dang yid gnyis dang the tshom dang yid dpyod kyi dri ma:
   - Conceptuality's assumption, doubt, hesitation, analysis defilements
   - Epistemic confusion

4. 'Dzin yul sna tshogs la rtog pa'i dri ma:
   - Grasping-objects' diversity conceptuality defilement
   - Multiplicity fixation

[9061-9086] [CONCEPT] Alaya Defilement Structure

The kun gzhi (alaya) defilements operate as:
1. Storage activation:
   - Dran pa (memory): Latencies surface
   - Yul 'jug (enter objects): Engagement occurs

2. Moral projection:
   - Dge mi dge (virtuous/non-virtuous): Evaluation
   - Lung bstan (prophecy): Predictive projection
   - Ma bstan (not prophesied): Uncertainty anxiety

3. Epistemic confusion:
   - Snyam byed (assumption): Uninvestigated acceptance
   - Yid gnyis (doubt): Uncertainty
   - The tshom (hesitation): Indecision
   - Yid dpyod (analysis): Over-intellectualization

4. Multiplicity fixation:
   - Sna tshogs (diversity): Many objects
   - 'Dzin yul (grasping objects): Holding phenomena
   - Rtog pa (conceptuality): Discursive elaboration

[STRUCTURE] Thirty-two Defilements and Their Purifiers

[9087-9112] [PHILOLOGY] Multiplicative Enumeration

The text employs mathematical vocabulary:
- "Dri ma de dag" (those defilements): All defilements mentioned
- "Dag byed" (purifier): Cleansing agents
- "Dbang bzhi" (four empowerments): Fourfold power
- "Bzhi bzhi" (four each): Distributed four
- "Bcu drug" (sixteen): Complete number

The particle "ni" marks calculation: "dri ma de dag gi dag byed dbang bzhi ste" (the purifiers of those defilements are four empowerments). The emphatic "ste" establishes identity.

[9113-9138] [CONTEXT] Thirty-two Defilement System

The complete defilement enumeration:
- 16 defilements (from previous sections)
- x 2 (brda'i spros bcas and don gyi spros bcas)
- = 32 total defilements

Or alternatively:
- 8 categories x 4 each = 32
- Complete coverage of all mental functions

Purification:
- 4 empowerments x 4 aspects each = 16 purifiers
- Each purifier addresses specific defilement

[9139-9164] [CONCEPT] Comprehensive Purification Coverage

The system ensures:
1. Complete enumeration:
   - All defilements identified
   - No obscuration overlooked
   - Total coverage

2. Corresponding purifiers:
   - Each defilement matched
   - Specific antidote applied
   - Targeted purification

3. Progressive refinement:
   - Gross to subtle
   - Outer to inner
   - Complete to incomplete

Result: Total purification revealing natural state.

**Summary:**

Page 222 presents mind (yid) defilements of temporal-spatial conceptual patterns, sems (kun gzhi) defilements of cognitive patterns, and the thirty-two defilement-purifier system. Philologically, the text employs cognitive terminology for mental functions, storehouse vocabulary for sems, and multiplicative enumeration. Contextual sources include Yogacara alaya-vijnana theory, pramana epistemology, and tantric purification systems. Conceptually, the section demonstrates fourfold temporal-spatial defilements of yid, fourfold storage-projection-confusion-multiplicity defilements of sems, and complete thirty-two defilement coverage with corresponding purifiers—all representing empowerment as exhaustive purification of all cognitive functions.
