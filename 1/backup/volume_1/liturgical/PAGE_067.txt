[2350] [2350] Some assert severance of cause, holding that mind cannot be grasped as an entity.
[2351] [2351] Others declare severance of effect, claiming neither life-force nor supreme power exists.
[2352] [2352] Moreover, some proclaim severance of path, stating there is nothing whatsoever.
[2353] [2353] Others assert severance of primordial wisdom, declaring there is no Buddha.
[2354] [2354] There are also those who say cause and effect do not exist, that emptiness is completely severed.
[2355] [2355] Some, through dwelling upon the path, declare severance, claiming effects are definitely cut off.
[2356] [2356] Through mistaken mind, they claim life-force is severed.
[2357] [2357] Some also assert that meaning arises from cutting the life-force.
[2358] [2358] Moreover, there are those who declare that severance is emptiness, and since you are severed and I am severed, therefore there is nothing whatsoever.
[2359] [2359] The secret speakers of the Vedas proclaim:
[2360] [2360] That meaning, like space itself, is completely empty and severed.
[2361] [2361] Existence as an entity does not exist.
[2362] [2362] Yet some slight portion exists.
[2363] [2363] They also claim that appearance to the faculties is possible.
[2364] [2364] These are called tīrthikas who deviate from partial agreement.
[2365] [2365] They deviate from partial agreement with the Buddhist teachings.
[2366] [2366] They deviate through wrong understanding of the Buddha's philosophical tenets—these are merely flesh.
[2367] [2367] Some think manifest appearance is mind's magical display.
[2368] [2368] They also teach that all is mere magical illusion.
[2369] [2369] Moreover, some claim these mistaken appearances are true,
[2370] [2370] While declaring there is no ultimate meaning.
[2371] [2371] There are even those who assert that through arising anger, spirits are destroyed, and therefore, son of the clan, one should abide in anger.
[2372] [2372] Some claim that since mind, as object, is self-arisen, it cannot be corrected.
[2373] [2373] Others declare that relying solely upon meditation on the deity's form is sufficient.
[2374] [2374] Some, being tīrthika practitioners, deviate from tīrthika debate-like speech.
[2375] [2375] Some assert that since only permanence exists, nothing whatsoever need be done.
[2376] [2376] Kani-pa is so called,
[2377] [2377] For he holds meaning to be indifferent.
[2378] [2378] Sersnawa is so called,
[2379] [2379] For he possesses suffering through fear that appearance will diminish and become empty.
[2380] [2380] Sambhari is so called.
