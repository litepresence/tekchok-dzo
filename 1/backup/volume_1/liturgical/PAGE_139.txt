[5309] [5309] The prefix and branch above [the letter] exist as karma and afflictions, aggregates and elements, sense-fields and elements, grasping and so forth—and are also explained thus.
[5310] [5310] When pure nirvāṇa is explained, that mother letter is self-arisen wisdom, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the three kāyas, five wisdoms, five lights, and ten powers.
[5311] [5311] When saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are both explained on one basis, that mother letter is awareness itself, and the prefix and branch are explained as the dharmas of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[5312] [5312] When the basis is explained, that mother letter is awareness, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the essential nature, compassion, and the five winds.
[5313] [5313] When the path is explained, that mother letter is the basis-nature, the essence of the heart, which is the nature of the threefold compassion; and the prefix and branch are also explained as the four lamps of basis-appearance and the four appearances.
[5314] [5314] When the result is explained, that mother letter is the Buddha's mind, self-arisen wisdom and branch are also; and the prefix explained as the kāyas, wisdoms, qualities, and activities.
[5315] [5315] In brief, whatever meaning is shown, the chief one is the mother letter at that time of explanation, and its retinue—the prefix and branch—should be explained.
[5316] [5316] The second, the sequence of long-short and heavy-light, is explained as follows, from Rigpa Rangdrol:
[5317] [5317] Sound is shown in four aspects: long, short, very long, and great. Thus the basis's sound is called.
[5318] [5318] The short is one letter; when expressed, it is recited for the duration of one expression.
[5319] [5319] The long equals two; depending on the occasion, it may be class-concordant, or when life-force is concordant even if class-discordant, there are stacked [letters] and those having a long portion.
[5320] [5320] The great is very long, arising for approximately the duration of three.
[5321] [5321] The basis's sound is the expanse of letters, namely the mother, branch, and prefix together. Those, when life-force is concordant, are recited as one.
