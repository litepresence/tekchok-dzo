[2726] [2726] Realizing that like reflections, they are without essence by nature and unarisen.
[2727] [2727] Furthermore, the two—outer grasping toward the self of dharmas
[2728] [2728] And inner knowledge grasping the antidote—are superimpositions of truth.
[2729] [2729] The self of the person is the knowledge of abandonment on the dharmas comprising the five aggregates, grasping at I and mine.
[2730] [2730] These are called the self of the person and the self of dharmas.
[2731] [2731] Though ārya hearers realize the selflessness of the person, they do not realize the selflessness of dharmas.
[2732] [2732] Self-enlightened ones realize above that the outer grasping of dharmas is non-existent, yet do not realize the non-existence of grasping.
[2733] [2733] From the Abhisamayālaṅkāra:
[2734] [2734] "In order to abandon thought of the grasped object,
[2735] [2735] "And in order not to abandon grasping,
[2736] [2736] "The rhinoceros-like path of support
[2737] [2737] "Should be known through correct summary."
[2738] [2738] Thus.
[2739] [2739] The time is through accumulating the collections comprising the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas.
[2740] [2740] "The rhinoceros through the cause of a hundred kalpas"
[2741] [2741] Is thus taught.
[2742] [2742] The crow-like:
[2743] [2743] Meditates on dependent origination in reverse order.
[2744] [2744] Going to the charnel ground, contemplating from "From what does this corpse arise?"
[2745] [2745] "It arises from death," thus from ignorance,
[2746] [2746] Based on realizing half and two of selflessness,
[2747] [2747] Through meditating on the five paths, they manifest the enlightenment of knowing weariness and non-arising.
[2748] [2748] Both of these teach Dharma through bodily signs, not through speech.
[2749] [2749] These methods are also from Rigpa Rangshar:
[2750] [2750] "A-ho, Secret Lord, listen!
[2751] [2751] "The sūtra vehicle of the self-enlightened:
[2752] [2752] "The door of entry is the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2753] [2753] "The realized view is the selflessness of the person,
[2754] [2754] "Holding half the power of the view of dharmas.
[2755] [2755] "Keeping the two hundred fifty disciplines of protection,
[2756] [2756] "Meditating on the stage of non-thought, the nature of dharmas,
[2757] [2757] "Outer and inner dependent origination,
[2758] [2758] "Becoming strength through habituation,
[2759] [2759] "Holding the measure of perfected fruit.
[2760] [2760] "These also are indicated by examples thus:
[2761] [2761] "For example, like a corpse in the charnel ground,
[2762] [2762] "Having gone to the charnel ground,
[2763] [2763] "This corpse, from what did it first arise?
[2764] [2764] "Now, what is the entity of this?
[2765] [2765] "Thus indicating by example.
[2766] [2766] "This also arises from ignorance.
[2767] [2767] "From ignorance, formative forces.
[2768] [2768] "Formative forces, consciousness.
[2769] [2769] "From consciousness, name arises.
[2770] [2770] "From name, the nature of form arises.
[2771] [2771] "From form, the six sense-bases arise.
[2772] [2772] "From the six sense-bases, contact arises.
[2773] [2773] "From contact, feeling arises.
[2774] [2774] "From feeling, craving arises.
[2775] [2775] "From craving, grasping arises.
[2776] [2776] "From grasping, existence arises.
[2777] [2777] "From existence, birth arises.
[2778] [2778] "From birth, aging arises.
[2779] [2779] "From aging, sickness arises.
[2780] [2780] "From sickness, death arises.
[2781] [2781] "Thus meditate on the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2782] [2782] "Through meditating thus with excellence,
[2783] [2783] "Obtain the fruit of the twelve grounds.
[2784] [2784] "Meditate on the eight types of unpleasantness.
[2785] [2785] "Having gone in the direction of the charnel ground,
[2786] [2786] "Thus contemplate upon one's own body.
