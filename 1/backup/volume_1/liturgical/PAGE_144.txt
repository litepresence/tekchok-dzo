[5535] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
[5536] Stacked letter five—annotation.
[5537] Thus it is called: NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KAYA SIDDHI BHĀRA.
[5538] Within these established sounds: DHARMA KAYA, SIDDHI, BHĀRA exist.
[5539] Their meaning:
[5540] The pure body is shown by actual sound;
[5541] the impure body is shown through establishment.
[5542] Therein, the pure wisdom-body:
[5543] This appearance, ceasing, immediately arises.
[5544] The impure sentient beings' body is this very appearance as concreteness.
[5545] The wisdom-body: rigpa at the heart, empty-cognizing, meaning-wisdom.
[5546] Dharmatā: permanent, unchanging—reversed from confusion.
[5547] Rigpa's wisdom reversed from the world.
[5548] Rigpa's compassion, unceasing, benefits beings.
[5549] Further, the stacked classes are shown:
[5550] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
[5551] Stacked letter six—annotation.
[5552] Thus it is: E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA; AD MA KO TSAG KRA BA LO KI.
[5553] Its meaning enters light:
[5554] rigpa's light, kāya's light, wisdom's light—these three gathered into dharmadhātu.
[5555] This too: from dharmatā's equality, not gone beyond.
[5556] For the non-dual meaning, wisdom's self-nature:
[5557] Emptiness stacked—emptiness of sambhogakāya's equality, meaning of complete enjoyment body.
[5558] Kāya beyond words,
[5559] pervaded by clear light,
[5560] whatever portion depends—nothing remains.
[5561] The path has three:
[5562] 1. The empty wisdom-path,
[5563] 2. The clear light-path,
[5564] 3. The unchanging rigpa's empty path.
[5565] First: the lamp of the bodhi path.
[5566] Second: wisdom's illusory body.
[5567] Third: the precious body.
[5568] These three too, in dharmadhātu's nature, are one taste:
[5569] Dharmatā's great equality's expanse, supreme, unchanging, not gone beyond.
[5570] Further stacked classes:
[5571] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
