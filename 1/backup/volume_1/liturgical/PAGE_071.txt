[2526] [2465] Herein, what are the two divisions?
[2527] [2466] First, explaining Vaibhāṣika:
[2528] [2467] They hold the four truths as directly realized,
[2529] [2468] And the aggregates, elements, and sense-bases as truly established.
[2530] [2469] They assert direct perception, inference, and scripture as valid cognitions.
[2531] [2470] The view of the path is established through three characteristics.
[2532] [2471] The effects are explained as four pairs of persons.
[2533] [2472] Thus explaining the Vaibhāṣika view.
[2534] [2473] Second, explaining Sautrāntika:
[2535] [2474] They hold the four truths as directly realized,
[2536] [2475] And emptiness and selflessness as the nature of realization.
[2537] [2475] Cognizing cognitions are twelvefold knowing.
[2538] [2476] Objects are established as the four truths.
[2539] [2477] Selflessness of persons is established through outer grasping.
[2540] [2478] Selflessness of dharmas is established through lack of true existence.
[2541] [2479] Thus explaining the Sautrāntika view.
[2542] [2480] Herein, how to explain the path cultivation?
[2543] [2481] The antidote for the three poisons is emptiness.
[2544] [2482] Individual antidotes: meditation on impurity for desire,
[2545] [2483] Meditation on love for anger, and dependent arising for delusion.
[2546] [2484] The faculties are dull, medium, and sharp.
[2547] [2485] Effort is made according to faculties.
[2548] [2486] Bodhisattvas' path is the five previously gone.
[2549] [2487] Thus explaining path cultivation in brief.
[2550] [2488] Herein, how to explain the effects?
[2551] [2489] Hearer effects: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and foe-destroyer.
[2552] [2490] Self-enlightened: solitary rhinoceros-like.
[2553] [2491] Bodhisattvas: the ten grounds of great joy.
[2554] [2492] Thus explaining the effects.
[2555] [2493] Herein, how to explain the self-enlightened vehicle?
[2556] [2494] They realize dependent arising through their own power,
[2557] [2495] Without relying upon a teacher in their final life.
[2558] [2496] Like a rhinoceros, they wander alone.
[2559] [2497] Thus explaining the self-enlightened vehicle.
[2560] [2498] Herein, how to explain the bodhisattva vehicle?
[2561] [2499] Generated bodhicitta, engaged in the six perfections,
[2562] [2500] Perfecting the two accumulations, attaining enlightenment for others' benefit.
[2563] [2501] Thus explaining the bodhisattva vehicle in brief.
