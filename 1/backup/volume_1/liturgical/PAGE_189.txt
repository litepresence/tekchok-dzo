[7777] [7777] Westward, Padma-heruka.
[7778] [7778] Northward, Karma-heruka.
[7779] [7779] Northward, Karma-heruka.
[7780] [7780] Thus at the peaceful head-ornament,
[7781] [7781] Five-by-five wrathful head-ornaments.

[7787] [7787] Wrinkles moving like a thousand lightnings.
[7788] [7788] Thunder sound and ru-lu sound,
[7789] [7789] Tiger skin and great elephant skin,

[7804] [7804] Thus it is spoken.

[7814] [7814] With elaboration and without elaboration,

[7816] [7816] Thus completely without elaboration,
[7817] [7817] By the manner of four distinctions,
[7818] [7818] Ripen the faith-possessing self-continuum."
[7819] [7819] Thus it is spoken.
