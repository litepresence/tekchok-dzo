[4005] [4005] Self-nature without multiplicity—dharmatā beyond the words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading.
[4006] [4006] Characteristic: pointed out, the cord of confidence is cut.
[4007] [4007] That divided, there are two:
[4008] [4008] The ear lineage and
[4009] [4009] The explanation lineage.
[4010] [4010] The essence of the ear lineage: connected one-to-one, especially near itself.
[4011] [4011] That too: self-nature connected to the ear faculty, without interruption by others,
[4012] [4012] Characteristic: without wavering, with confidence and the certainty of liberation.
[4013] [4013] Divided into many: with syllables and
[4014] [4014] Without syllables—the ear lineage of dharmatā's meaning and instruction.
[4015] [4015] The essence of the explanation lineage:
[4016] [4016] Dharmatā without action, without cause, without basis to reverse the three realms,
[4017] [4017] Self-nature:
[4018] [4018] Clear light without stain, knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms,
[4019] [4019] Characteristic: beyond thought and investigation, dwelling in the intention of the three bodies possessing the five wisdoms.
[4020] [4020] Divided, there are four:
[4021] [4021] The outer cycle,
[4022] [4022] The inner cycle,
[4023] [4023] The secret cycle,
[4024] [4024] The unsurpassable secret cycle.
[4025] [4025] The essence of the outer cycle:
[4026] [4026] Without abandoning afflictions, the five poisons dwell as path-vehicles,
[4027] [4027] Self-nature without effort or establishment—whatever appears arises as dharmatā,
[4028] [4028] Characteristic without parts—emptiness nowhere divided.
[4029] [4029] The essence of the inner cycle: not possessing form, the markless dharmatā,
[4030] [4030] Self-nature without coming or going, the wisdom always dwelling at all times,
[4031] [4031] Characteristic: from the aspect of solidity, arising like a root,
[4032] [4032] From the aspect of twisting, arising like a trunk, from the aspect of clarity, arising like a flower,
[4033] [4033] From the aspect of ripening, arising like a fruit.
[4034] [4034] The essence of the secret cycle:
[4035] [4035] Pointing out and
[4036] [4036] Realization attained simultaneously, depending completely on the three: hearing, contemplation, and meditation,
[4037] [4037] Self-nature: breath cessation and buddhahood simultaneously, depending completely on effort, establishment, and familiarization-power,
[4038] [4038] Characteristic: buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneously, depending completely on accumulation and merit.
[4039] [4039] The essence of the unsurpassable secret cycle:
