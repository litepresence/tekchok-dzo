[3950] [3950] Through self-nature without cause and fruition, without self-wish, there is no place to go,
[3951] [3951] Through characteristic not needing familiarization, not depending on other knowables.
[3952] [3952] Through the essence of the hidden and manifest being unobtainable,
[3953] [3953] Hope does not reach anywhere.
[3954] [3954] Through self-nature without direction, doubt is nowhere.
[3955] [3955] Through characteristic examined and not found, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten—so it is called.
[3956] [3956] When divided, there are two:
[3957] [3957] Concealing one, revealing and emerging two,
[3958] [3958] Concealing two, revealing and emerging one.
[3959] [3959] The first:
[3960] [3960] If view and conduct are revealed and emerge, and meditation is concealed,
[3961] [3961] That nature in union without beginning or end—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning and end are cut.
[3962] [3962] That nature's two are not different—in the bindu without outside or inside,
[3963] [3953] Without dependence on characteristic—causeless openness.
[3964] [3964] If conduct is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge,
[3965] [3965] Abiding in emptiness, purified through emptiness—so it is called.
[3966] [3966] If view is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge, through grasp-free knowledge arising directionlessly,
[3967] [3967] Awareness without object, liberation beyond concepts—so it is called.
[3968] [3968] The second: concealing two, revealing one:
[3969] [3969] If meditation is revealed and emerges, awareness free from aim arises—causeless fruition abides in itself—so it is called.
[3970] [3970] If conduct is revealed and emerges, body cast to the precipice, mind sent to dharmatā—so it is called.
[3971] [3971] If view is revealed and emerges, mind delivered to emptiness, body and speech brought to the essential point—so it is called.
[3972] [3972] The fourth: the essence of self-clarifying explanation—word-attachment's stream is cut, the established view does not dwell, the establishment is specially supreme,
[3973] [3973] Self-nature not perceived, completely pure, primordial purity's dharmatā that arises directionlessly—so it is called,
[3974] [3974] Characteristic not mind, self-pure movement, without done to the basis—so it is called.
[3975] [3975] That divided, there are three:
[3976] [3976] Speaking in the manner of error's messenger,
