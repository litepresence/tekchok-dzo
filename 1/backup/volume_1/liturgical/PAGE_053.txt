[1704] [1704] The aggregate of discipline, for the purpose of purifying manifest stains.
[1705] [1705] The aggregate of complete liberation, for the purpose of transcending all concepts.
[1706] [1706] Third: The distinctive characteristics of the sense sources.
[1707] [1707] That which arises from what and becomes expanded is called "sense source."
[1708] [1708] If divided:
[1709] [1709] From the aspect of objects, the eye's grasping object, form, and so forth—six things—arise and expand as the two knowings of the moment and the outer continuum.
[1710] [1710] From the aspect of knowing, there arise and expand six: eye consciousness and so forth, knowing forms as forms.
[1711] [1711] The twelve sense sources are:
[1712] [1712] These are:
[1713] [1713] The sense sources are two:
[1714] [1714] The grasped sense sources, and
[1715] [1715] The grasper sense sources.
[1716] [1716] The grasped sense sources: Thinking of form, sound, odor, taste, phenomena, and touch as perception.
[1717] [1717] The six portions of the grasped: eye, ear, nose, tongue, mind, and body.
[1718] [1718] The twelve are: eye grasping, ear grasping, nose grasping, tongue grasping, mind grasping, and body grasping. Thus it is taught.
[1719] [1719] Fourth: The essential nature of the faculties that grasp.
[1720] [1720] They are called "faculties" because they have power over grasping objects.
[1721] [1721] If divided:
[1722] [1722] Those arising from the first portion of form-possessing, and
[1723] [1723] Those arising from the portion of wisdom—these two.
[1724] [1724] First:
[1725] [1725] The coarse aggregates arising from the first condition of form-possessing.
[1726] [1726] Five: the eye faculty and so forth, which produce the capability of grasping forms.
[1727] [1727] The six: the mind faculty, arising from the first condition of form-possessing knowing.
[1728] [1728] Second:
[1729] [1729] The portion of knowing that arises, capable of engaging objects.
[1730] [1730] These are the six: faith and so forth.
[1731] [1731] As it is stated in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra.
