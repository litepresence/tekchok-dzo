[8669] [8669] Bliss whatever not different arise measure.
[8670] [8670] That bhaga fall wind power back consort bindu two swallowed measure.
[8671] [8671] Eleventh: thus view bliss arise sequence:
[8672] [8672] First joy,
[8673] [8673] Enter wisdom wind pull gather dwell.

[8676] [8676] Fourth experience, mind wisdom two not separate time.
[8677] [8677] Fifth emptiness, mind wisdom two where not open not close, two extremes difference not pass.
[8678] [8678] Thus said:
[8679] [8679] From before:
[8680] [8680] First joy only from,
[8681] [8681] Second feeling experience touch,
[8682] [8682] Third bliss itself called,
[8683] [8683] Fourth experience co-emergent,
[8684] [8684] Fifth emptiness called.
[8685] [8685] Thus.
[8686] [8686] Twelfth: that view join change measure:
[8687] [8687] First consort actually not use channel produce method time not,
[8688] [8688] Ordinary desire self not view change time called,
[8689] [8690] Self body rely bliss mind power not arise.
[8690] [8691] Then actual body release bodhicitta hold purify not purify time bliss special arise experience self not mixed emptiness mind not recognize,
[8691] [8692] Mind itself emptiness only know,
[8692] [8693] Ordinary thought self mind whatever not time view obtain time called.
[8693] [8694] Then bodhicitta purify release measure reach time,
[8694] [8695] Channels spread body mind non-dual great mudra mind-transcend experience time view stable time called,
[8695] [8696] However done bodhicitta power obtain change not itself.
[8696] [8697] Also from before:
