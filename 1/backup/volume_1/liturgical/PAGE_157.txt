[6139] [6139] By outcaste family for a thousand years,
[6140] [6140] Made this abiding and flourishing.
[6141] [6141] After that passed, darkness below,
[6142] [6142] Abides for five thousand years.
[6143] [6143] Then again descended here,
[6144] [6144] To the place called Vajra Seat,
[6145] [6145] This flourishing, light blazing,
[6146] [6146] For five hundred fifty years.
[6147] [6147] This is held by Lodrö Zangpo;
[6148] [6148] That patron, a ḍākinī,
[6149] [6149] Made cool and pure.
[6150] [6150] After that, this world,
[6151] [6151] Earth, water, fire, and wind clash and disturb,
[6152] [6152] Becomes the non-abiding great emptiness.
[6153] [6153] From the first called aeon,
[6154] [6154] The time of final destruction arises.
[6155] [6155] Thus it is spoken.
[6156] [6156] Lodrö Zangpo is all who hold this;
[6157] [6157] Five hundred years is a great year,
[6158] [6158] Passed in five hundreds.
[6159] [6159] That much appearing to humans from the first aeon to this interval of ten years of life, the primordial—
[6160] [6160] Others, not, do benefit in the abode of ḍākinīs.
[6161] [6161] Second, the particular explanation of flourishing and decline:
[6162] [6162] In this Jambudvīpa, now, until the primordial, the seven types of flourishing and decline arising in this interval of ten years of life are:
[6163] [6163] From the Great Arrangement of Ati:
[6164] [6164] Listen, fortunate Śāriputra,
[6165] [6165] The sacred teaching's vast, great arrangement,
[6166] [6166] The supreme essence repeatedly gathered,
[6167] [6167] This gold-essence sun-illuminator,
[6168] [6168] Does not flourish mixed with the common,
[6169] [6169] Appears to some possessing the great secret family.
[6170] [6170] In the time of degenerate strife-possessing, coarse affliction,
[6171] [6171] Factions, internal quarrels, all hermitages destroyed.
[6172] [6172] Royal law not abiding, self-pride, kingly conduct of desire,
[6173] [6173] Father and son quarrel, weapons protect bodies.
[6174] [6174] Accumulated groups lost, earth's essences exhausted,
[6175] [6175] Unsuitable views and conduct also many arise.
[6176] [6176] Five hundred degenerations, life years gradually decline,
[6177] [6177] Life of sixty years, little merit and fortune,
[6178] [6178] This essence abides for sixty years.
[6179] [6179] After that passed, in the interval of a hundred years,
[6180] [6180] This secret not abiding, conduct of reasoning.
[6181] [6181] After that passed, even in a thousand years,
[6182] [6182] From the person without study and contemplation,
[6183] [6183] This supreme secret becomes like the sun.
[6184] [6184] After that passed, becomes darkness for two hundred.
[6185] [6185] Then, when life years are forty,
[6186] [6186] This essence abides for the interval of a hundred years.
[6187] [6187] After that passed, becomes darkness for thirty.
[6188] [6188] After that passed, abiding for the interval of a hundred years,
[6189] [6189] When beings' life is thirty years,
[6190] [6190] This supreme secret declines, flourishes for eight hundred years of distant benefit,
[6191] [6191] This not arising when life is twenty.
[6192] [6192] When life is ten years, this essence arises;
[6193] [6193] Whoever meets this, arising self-dissolves.
[6194] [6194] The teaching's seed dissolved in sky, not appearing to people,
[6195] [6195] Again, the teaching's ember becomes other.
[6196] [6196] Thus it is spoken.
