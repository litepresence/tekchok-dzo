[13332] [13332] On the fourth day, by elemental power manifesting,
[13333] [13333] Eight-petaled wheels arise, clear lights and syllables illuminating—
[13334] [13334] Gathering wheels of taste like starlight radiantly resounding,
[13335] [13335] Wheels stacked like petals—thus the channel wheels are named.
[13336] [13336] Within these eight, at the center of five desire-objects, bliss-touch's support,
[13337] [13337] Warmth's essence, sheep-fat like, abides twelve sense-bases' basis,
[13338] [13338] The wheel of gathering and expanding, basis-of-all's karmic support.
[13339] [13339] Thus with syllables of the expanding wheel's abode.
[13340] [13340] Then from twenty-nine to thirty-two days, water gathers and holds,
[13341] [13341] Earth stabilizes and presses,
[13342] [13342] Fire blazes and expands,
[13343] [13343] Wind flames and moves—such is the work performed.

[13348] [13348] From the four above channels, four more channels expand,
[13349] [13349] At their center, Tip-of-Force Wind petal from star-light-like radiance gathering,
[13350] [13350] The actual power of the above element-basis exhausted,
[13351] [13351] Again by two elements gathering's work, from day thirty-four,
[13352] [13352] The basis-of-all's four supports with their groups solidified,
[13353] [13353] Affliction-gathering and coarse channel poison's vapor, like poison-vase gathering, abides—
[13354] [13354] Tip-Arranged Wheel thus it is named and abides.
[13355] [13355] On the thirty-fifth day, the King's Letter Tantra complete arises from this.
[13356] [13356] Thus seven by seven sections, existence body's channel wheels four produced—
