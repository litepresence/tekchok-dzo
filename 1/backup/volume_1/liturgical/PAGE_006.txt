[163] [163] From the Sutra of Entering the Buddha Realm and Wisdom Inconceivable:
[164] [164] The gods and humans of the three-thousand worlds are very few.
[165] [165] An outsider sage with clairvoyance seeing sentient-beings across an earth-extent of a single chariot-wheel—that is more numerous.
[166] [166] More than those seeing the three-thousand worlds, from the eight liberations of shravakas;
[167] [167] More than those seeing the three-thousand worlds, from the eight liberations of bodhisattvas; more, a single meditator seeing across a single chariot-wheel.
[168] [168] More than those seeing the three-thousand worlds, from the eight liberations of bodhisattvas; more, a single meditator seeing across a single chariot-wheel.
[169] [169] More than those seeing the three-thousand worlds,
[170] [170] More, the Tathagata's eye seeing across the earth-extent of a chariot-wheel—thus spoke the Bhagavan.
[171] [171] Thus, wherever sky pervades, in those places sentient-beings pervade.
[172] [172] Through Buddha's emanations pervading them, all purposes are accomplished.
[173] [173] Some directly accomplish purposes through Samantabhadra's emanation as teacher.
[174] [174] Some also accomplish purposes through Buddhas included in other tantras.
[175] [175] Having first received the path from Samantabhadra, generating bodhicitta, thus arose.
[176] [176] Thus Samantabhadra's purpose-accomplishment through tantra is called.
[177] [177] In certain treatises this sequence appears:
[178] [178] From Buddha comes dharma, from dharma come the arya hosts.
[179] [179] Such is the meaning of this order.
[180] [180] Second: Regarding Vajradhara's manner of obtaining peace in this field—
[181] [181] Some say from the first Protector
[182] [182] Beings of different tantras generate mind—this view is invalid,
[183] [183] For the Magical Vairotsana declares:
[184] [184] "First Buddha, Buddha of earth,
[185] [185] Great hero and great destroyer"—
[186] [186] Thus.
[187] [187] "This teacher is Vajradhara,
[188] [188] Buddha before all Buddhas"—
[189] [189] Thus spoke the Bhagavan, contradicting that view.
[190] [190] Therefore, for the purpose of beings in this field, in the first time, through Samantabhadra's own emanations, displaying as ordinary beings generating mind, then demonstrating Buddhahood and opening the great play of enlightened activity.
[191] [191] Such manner is also renowned in common sutras.
