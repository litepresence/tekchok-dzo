[6386] [6386] All treatises and sounds,
[6387] [6387] Become known as wished.
[6388] [6388] This unsurpassed supreme secret,
[6389] [6389] If worship, praise, and honor are made,
[6390] [6390] Supreme and common accomplishments
[6391] [6391] Arise as wished.
[6392] [6392] By merely carrying this,
[6393] [6393] Scripture and oral instructions are held.
[6394] [6394] The jewel-light dispelling the world's darkness,
[6395] [6395] This lamp making appear—
[6396] [6396] To whoever it appears,
[6397] [6397] Elements self-liberate;
[6398] [6398] Without doubt, becomes fortunate.

[6406] [6406] Vajradhara, and
[6407] [6407] That very teacher showing many other emanations of name-forms, arranged, and
[6408] [6408] From that blessing, having become Buddha, other arranged great Brahma aeons filling the sky's limit, numberless, expression-transcended—some empty, and

[6412] [6412] Up to this great Brahma arranged by Vajradhara,
[6413] [6413] Again, by the clear light aeon of the secret essence, the sequence of taming beings—sixty-four hundred-thousand, and
[6414] [6414] From that, between-between, other aeons numberless-transcended arisen,
[6415] [6415] Explained here as those arisen of clear light essence;
