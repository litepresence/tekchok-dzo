[13412] [13412] From formations, root and limb's afflictions increase,
[13413] [13413] From eighteen elements' proliferation-change, increase.
[13414] [13414] Then four elements' individual power strength exhausted,
[13415] [13415] Two-by-two elements gathering, upon gathering-memory wheel, from each channel spreads moving channels—sixteen increasing, showing sixteen empowerments' increase.
[13416] [13416] Within each of those, one nature channel-abode letter,
[13417] [13417] One five-light mass steadying that,
[13418] [13418] Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abide.
[13419] [13419] Thus also channels support body,
[13420] [13420] Body supports elements,
[13421] [13421] Syllable steadies wheel's dharma,
[13422] [13422] Light supports wisdom,
[13423] [13423] Samantabhadra yab-yum supports three bodies.
[13424] [13424] Wisdom and
[13425] [13425] Body and
[13426] [13426] Dharmata and
[13427] [13427] Light, abiding in own nature four—depending on these, four empowerments' result measure arrived.
[13428] [13428] Within gathering-memory wheel's sixteen channels,
[13429] [13429] Sixteen minds abide depending.
[13430] [13430] That also, mind and
[13431] [13431] Mind-itself's distinction from—
[13432] [13432] First, upon mind, gathering by water-mind holds mindfulness' thought-basis,
[13433] [13433] By steadiness, mind's collection gathers,
[13434] [13434] Radiating by fire-mind radiates to objects,
[13435] [13435] Light by wind-mind moves.
[13436] [13436] Upon mind-itself:
[13437] [13437] Unborn meaning's mind-itself,
[13438] [13438] Unceasing mindfulness's mind-itself,
[13439] [13439] Unchanging example-meaning-mixed mind-itself,
[13440] [13440] Self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated mind-itself.
[13441] [13441] Upon mindfulness, mind and
[13442] [13442] Mental two from—
[13443] [13443] Mind's mindfulness is as explained before.
[13444] [13444] Mental's mindfulness six are:
[13445] [13445] Thoroughly-searching mindfulness, pure—clear as god's body,
[13446] [13446] Impure—thrown into god's migration,
[13447] [13447] Perverted—thrown into wrong-attachment body.
[13448] [13448] Definitively-settling mental mindfulness, pure—awareness-holder obtained,
[13449] [13449] Impure—born as god-asura,
[13450] [13450] Perverted—into butcher's lineage.
[13451] [13451] Definitively-placing mental mindfulness, pure—space-dweller.
