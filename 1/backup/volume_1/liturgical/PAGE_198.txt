[8177] [8177] From three examinations through the door of family:
[8178] [8178] Outer family: by royal family accomplishing Buddha of Sugata family,
[8179] [8179] By minister family: vajra,
[8180] [8180] By commoner family: jewel,
[8181] [8181] By brahmin: lotus,
[8182] [8182] By outcaste family: accomplishing Buddha of karma family.
[8183] [8183] If thinking that whichever Buddha is accomplished by one, it is not so;
[8184] [8184] Without each knowledge-woman for each family, it is not accomplished.
[8185] [8185] Just as Buddhas arise in five families, certainly in five families.
[8186] [8186] Thus:
[8187] [8187] From the Great Empowerment Arrangement:
[8188] [8188] "By difference of Buddha family,
[8189] [8189] Knowledge-woman thus becomes different."
[8190] [8190] Thus it is spoken.
[8191] [8191] Inner family: daughter of yakṣa,
[8192] [8192] Daughter of god,
[8193] [8193] Son of nāga,
[8194] [8194] Daughter of Brahmā,
[8195] [8195] Five daughters of Indra are the karma mudra family.
[8196] [8196] From the Vajra Ḍākinī Samvara:
[8197] [8197] "God, demigod, or yakṣa,
[8198] [8198] Nāga, Indra, and Brahmā—
[8199] [8199] Blessed by mudra surpassing family.
[8200] [8200] Attract and well apply by self."
[8201] [8201] Thus it is spoken.
[8202] [8202] As the master of Kosala, Glorious Great Bliss, attained siddhi by empowering, having attracted daughters of Brahmā, Indra, and so forth.
[8203] [8203] Secret family: four.
[8204] [8204] Women do not transcend the channels of four family-possessed.
[8205] [8205] That: conch-possessed,
[8206] [8206] Elephant-nose-possessed,
[8207] [8207] Lotus-possessed,
[8208] [8208] Deer-possessed,
[8209] [8209] Cow-possessed.
[8210] [8210] Conch-possessed:
[8211] [8211] Black hair, good teeth, good arrangement.
[8212] [8212] Elephant-nose: bad hair, excess front teeth.
[8213] [8213] Lotus-possessed:
[8214] [8214] Yellow voice, right li.
[8215] [8215] Deer-possessed:
[8216] [8216] Bad hair, big forehead prominence.
[8217] [8217] Cow-possessed:
[8218] [8218] Good hair, wrinkle standing upward at forehead.
[8219] [8219] That lotus-possessed generates excess bliss, helper of dharmatā clarity.
[8220] [8220] As there is a channel like lotus open and not-open,
[8221] [8221] Instruction of opening channel mouth is most important.
[8222] [8222] Deer-possessed:
