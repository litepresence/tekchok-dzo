[13694] [13694] From those change-numbers, four hundred four common diseases branched.
[13695] [13695] Thus Peak-Arranged Wheel, three hundred sixty channels inside,
[13696] [13696] Ka ka ki ki
[13697] [13697] Etc. syllables seven hundred twenty abide,
[13698] [13698] Three hundred sixty light-spheres combined—one thousand eighty,
