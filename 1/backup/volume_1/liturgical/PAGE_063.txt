[2208] [2208] These speak of permanence.
[2209] [2209] Some speak of impermanence.
[2210] [2210] Some speak of both, gathering permanence and impermanence together.
[2211] [2211] From Rangshar:
[2212] [2212] This too is summarized as follows:
[2213] [2213] Permanence and impermanence.
[2214] [2214] The meaning of the view of impermanence is as follows:
[2215] [2215] The great tirthika emptiness of sudden cutoff.
[2216] [2216] Like the emptiness of space in continuous cutoff.
[2217] [2217] Viewing the nature of cutoff as nonexistent.
[2218] [2218] The cutoff of results as emptiness.
[2219] [2219] The permanence of the nonexistent emptiness.
[2220] [2220] The tenets of the permanent vehicle.
[2221] [2221] The tenets of eternal permanence.
[2222] [2222] As follows regarding permanent things:
[2223] [2223] From one's own citta mandala,
[2224] [2224] Not arising from father causes,
[2225] [2225] Not depending on mother conditions,
[2226] [2226] As large as beans,
[2227] [2227] As small as mustard seeds,
[2228] [2228] As tiny as hair tips,
[2229] [2229] Oily, smooth, white, and clear.
[2230] [2230] Thus, that nature of causes,
[2231] [2231] Exists permanently without change from the beginning.
[2232] [2232] This and habitual tendencies, aggregates,
[2233] [2233] Abiding inseparably as one,
[2234] [2234] Is held as the tenet of permanent causes.
[2235] [2235] As follows regarding permanent results:
[2236] [2236] The great lord of fortune itself,
[2237] [2237] Through virtues of reliance and worship,
[2238] [2238] Although abandoning this first body,
[2239] [2239] Produces births on one's own ground.
[2240] [2240] By the great lord of fortune,
[2241] [2241] Results are held as permanent.
[2242] [2242] The two natures of permanence and impermanence,
[2243] [2243] Do not accord with their own meanings.
[2244] [2244] Thus it is taught.
[2245] [2245] Second, explaining extensively the meaning of those sixty branches:
