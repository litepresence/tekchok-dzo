[192] [192] From the Meeting of Father and Son:
[193] [193] "Great hero, skilled in skillful-means,
[194] [194] For the complete ripening of sentient-beings,
[195] [195] Though becoming Buddha ten-million times,
[196] [196] Still you guide, O Teacher,
[197] [197] Demonstrating many Buddhas"—
[198] [198] Thus.
[199] [199] From the Flower Ornament:
[200] [200] "Having attained the ocean of supreme enlightenment,
[201] [201] For the complete ripening of the ocean of sentient-beings,
[202] [202] Demonstrating the ocean of bodhicitta generation,
[203] [203] Showing the ocean of conduct undiminished through all time—
[204] [204] Such is the emanation of the Sugatas."
[205] [205] Thus spoke the Bhagavan.
[206] [206] Therefore, the first Protector, intending to tame this realm, displayed through emanations that manner of mind-generation—
[207] [207] Regarding this Fortunate Eon, before immeasurable eons past,
[208] [208] In the field called "Self-Nature Completely Arranged,"
[209] [209] To Buddha Flower-Great-Beauty offered one golden vajra, generating supreme bodhicitta as the first mind.
[210] [210] Then in the second birth, in the north, "Wind-Movement Arranged," becoming householder Good-Give's son called Jewel-Garland,
[211] [211] Dwelt near Buddha Wheel-Well-Conduct, hearing Dharma.
[212] [212] Then passed beyond, born as a son called "Lightning-Light" in the Bliss-Intoxicated Island, the brahmin youth Good-Give.
[213] [213] At that time, heard Dharma from Buddha Good-Intelligence for five years, and for seven years abided in single-pointed samadhi.
[214] [214] At seventy-five years, demonstrated manifest complete Buddhahood upon the peak of the mountain called "Jewel-Precious-Heap-Arranged."
[215] [215] Having dwelt for one great eon in the meaning of dharma-body,
[216] [216] Then self-arose as the Victor's enjoyment-complete body in ornament and color wheel.
[217] [217] From the spreading-gathering of light-rays, arose thirty-six self-arisen tantras.
