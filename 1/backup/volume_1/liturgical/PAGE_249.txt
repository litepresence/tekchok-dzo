[10155] [10155] From the Tantra of the Supreme Trunk of Samaya Arrangements:
[10156] [10156] Promises must not be transgressed,
[10157] [10157] The guru's commitments must not be broken.
[10158] [10158] The guru's activities must not be wrong,
[10159] [10159] One's body, speech, and mind—all
[10160] [10160] Must not stray from Dharma.
[10161] [10161] Acting for the benefit of all beings,
[10162] [10162] Always respecting the guru,
[10163] [10163] Not transgressing supreme samaya.
[10164] [10164] Holding vajra and bell,
[10165] [10165] Holding substances suitable for mantra.
[10166] [10166] Generally, from root samaya:
[10167] [10167] What should be secret and entrusted,
[10168] [10168] Secret promises and pledges,
[10169] [10169] If wrong conduct with speech or mind,
[10170] [10170] This too will increase the uninterrupted continuum.
[10171] [10171] Distinctive Dharma arising from empowerment
[10172] [10172] Must not be revealed to others; join with mind.
[10173] [10173] The guru's mind—if harmed
[10174] [10174] By body, speech, or mind,
[10175] [10175] Wrong deeds must not be done.
[10176] [10176] Similarly, toward vajra siblings
[10177] [10177] Harm and injury must not be done.
[10178] [10178] Thus.
[10179] [10179] Thus, guarding the twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind distinctions is the distinctive Dharma here.
[10180] [10180] Furthermore, from Consequence:
[10181] [10181] Furthermore, samaya and discipline explained:
[10182] [10182] The guru is the basis of Buddha worship,
[10183] [10183] Dharma and Sangha, yi-dam deity,
[10184] [10184] Vajra sky-goers—to these
[10185] [10185] Gathering and worship must not cease.
[10186] [10186] Seeing a guru with proper characteristics,
[10187] [10187] Praise and worship should be complete.
[10188] [10188] Do not disparage women, do not be angry.
[10189] [10189] Do not disparage aggregates; rely on yi-dam.
[10190] [10190] Mandala, mantra, and deity,
[10191] [10191] Mudra reliance is indeed proper.
[10192] [10192] Do not break the faithful gathering,
[10193] [10193] Do not disturb the virtuous mind.
[10194] [10194] The discipline-possessed should dwell in samaya.
[10195] [10195] Furthermore, the training sequence:
[10196] [10196] Complete bodily conduct,
[10197] [10197] Speech must be strictly restrained.
[10198] [10198] Mind dwells, examines, and analyzes.
[10199] [10199] Enter sequence, do karma sequence.
[10200] [10200] Always hand and pill karma,
[10201] [10201] Place all channels in the drop-net.
[10202] [10202] Garland and necklace, even half,
[10203] [10203] Beautifully conduct the wheel.
[10204] [10204] Take the chief of supreme attainments,
[10205] [10205] Do with the wheel of six place-ornaments.
[10206] [10206] All these, without transgression or degeneration, must be earnestly done.
[10207] [10207] If these are exceeded, faults are measureless.
[10208] [10208] From the Tantra of the Jewel-Stacked Wheel:
