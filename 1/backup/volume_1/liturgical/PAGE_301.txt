[12500] [12500] Thus cyclic existence by name arises.
[12501] [12501] The inconceivable forms of beings arise.
[12502] [12502] Delusion's path and thought, however conceived, arise as such—thus it is said.
[12503] [12503] Therein Vajrasattva is Rigpa, Awareness Itself.
[12504] [12504] The Broad Expanse, field of display—
[12505] [12505] the Primordial Four.
[12506] [12506] Beautiful Abode,
[12507] [12507] gateway where basis-appearances spontaneously arise.
[12508] [12508] When time dissolves,
[12509] [12509] self non-recognition appears as other—the deluded basis-display.
[12510] [12510] Year of the Pig,
[12511] [12511] time when ignorance is fully conceptualized.
[12512] [12512] Emanated Sun,
[12513] [12513] clear thought-grasping of coarse appearances.
[12514] [12514] Star of the Bird,
[12515] [12515] attachment to objects arisen as desire.
[12516] [12516] The Elder Crone,
[12517] [12517] non-recognition consciousness arisen as deluded grasping.
[12518] [12518] Indeterminate lineage,
[12519] [12519] basis-appearance wherever arising and liberating—common ground of delusion and liberation.
[12520] [12520] Four companions,
[12521] [12521] Four conditions.
[12522] [12522] Five wild men,
[12523] [12523] Five poisons.
[12524] [12524] One back-support,
[12525] [12525] conceptualizing mind.
[12526] [12526] One thief,
[12527] [12527] anger.
[12528] [12528] One accumulating all,
[12529] [12529] delusion-appearance established as one.
[12530] [12530] That mind indeed grasps delusion-appearance.
[12531] [12531] From that, many afflictions arise—
[12532] [12532] hosts of armies.
[12533] [12533] Thus delusion from primordial purity, without samsara-basis, from incompleteness arisen.
[12534] [12534] Second,
[12535] [12535] practice lineage indicates delusion and
[12536] [12536] liberation—two revealed.
[12537] [12537] Again from self-arisen
[12538] [12538] HO! Listen, O pure ones of the expanse!
[12539] [12539] The Buddha intention—measure this all to be grasped.
[12540] [12540] Before, in the Broad Expanse,
[12541] [12541] Teacher Light-Spread existed.
[12542] [12542] He had two sons,
[12543] [12543] imprisoned in empty cave—thus the symbolic narrative.
[12544] [12544] Five soldiers arose, stone fortress destroyed—thus the symbolic narrative.
[12545] [12545] Two sons sent into hole.
