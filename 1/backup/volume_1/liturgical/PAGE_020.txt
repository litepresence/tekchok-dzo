[684] [684] Like scattered stars.
[685] [685] Thus from immeasurable fields,
[686] [686] This Sahā's sequence is explained:
[687] [687] From that itself:
[688] [688] External elements from wind also,
[689] [689] Connected with space's khams,
[690] [690] That water, that upper earth.
[691] [691] Extent breadth thick equal,

[698] [698] Mountain ranges and water ranges and
[699] [699] Definitely surrounded by seven jewels.
[700] [700] Internal thus formless first from,
[701] [701] Form's khams luminosity is:
[702] [702] In distance desire's khams also,
[703] [703] Moon stainless and
[704] [704] From sun greatly-illuminating,
[705] [705] World khams expanded is,
[706] [706] Paranirmitavaśavartin and so forth upper sequence.
[707] [707] Then asuras abodes,
[708] [708] Continents four's humans sequence.
[709] [709] By kleśas with self,
[710] [710] Lower realms abodes sequence arisen.
[711] [711] Thus and,
[712] [712] From Pearl garland's tantra:
[713] [713] Sky wind supports that water,
[714] [714] By hundred-thousand eleven,
[715] [715] Round coiled itself arisen.
[716] [716] Like cream arisen from milk,
[717] [717] Earth hundred-thousand twelve.
[718] [718] Wind's number hundred-thousand.
[719] [719] Wind gathering and contracting and

[727] [727] Terraces four and peaks great and
[728] [728] Play-lakes and mountains seven,
[729] [729] Continents and surrounding arisen.
[730] [730] Three-thousand and so forth khams are.
[731] [731] By desire and form and formless,
[732] [732] Supporting that three khams.
[733] [733] Non-existing anything without and
[734] [734] Consciousness slight without's
[735] [735] Formless khams arisen from that.
[736] [736] Abode pure and so forth embodied,
[737] [737] Drops manner from upper to below.
[738] [738] Akanistha and so forth desire.
[739] [739] Gods and asuras humans are:
[740] [740] High that from abodes three,
[741] [741] Animals pretas hell and
[742] [742] These beings birth four.
[743] [743] That also fortunate-aeon first's humans,
[744] [744] Possessing form and beauty marks-characteristics,
[745] [745] Body pervaded by own-light radiance,
[746] [746] Desire-food and so forth merit food.
[747] [747] Beings' life also eighty-thousand,
[748] [748] Without male and female faculties.
[749] [749] Then from delusion's cause two,
[750] [750] Kleśas desire and so forth,
[751] [751] Gradually became coarse itself.
[752] [752] That faculties and so forth gates,
[753] [753] Light and so forth decrease, reason merit exhausted.
[754] [754] Then sequence earth oil and
[755] [755] Eat rice and so forth food.
[756] [756] Thus and so forth taught thus:
