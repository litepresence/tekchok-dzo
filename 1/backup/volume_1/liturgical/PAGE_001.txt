[1] Yānāgratnakōśanāmavajrāhāra.
[2] Thus abides the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle, the Jewel Treasure.
[3] In the language of India:
[4] Yānāgratnakōśanāma
[5] In the language of Tibet:
[6] Treasury of Supreme Vehicle
[7] To Glorious Samantabhadra I prostrate.
[8] Samantabhadra, whose innate nature holds the five perfections, complete in dominion,
[9] Together with the regent of the five families, the Great Ocean, the sublime guide, the Teacher,
[10] The five vidyādharas, hosts of the aural lineage, ornament of the three worlds together with the gods,
[11] To that crown of all joy, the glorious source of excellence and auspiciousness, I offer homage.
[12] That which from the primordial is pure, where all elaborations cease into space, beautifully arrayed,
[13] Nature ever-abiding, clear light, seven horses, pervading all three bodies and qualities,
[14] Not dwelling in existence or peace, spontaneously entered, uncompounded and spontaneously accomplished—
[15] To that Vajra-point, supreme possessor of all, the Sugata-essence, I prostrate.
[16] From the Dharma-sun, stainless, vast, immeasurable, ornament of space,
[17] The unsurpassed secret vajra vehicle, supreme among all, glorious as the wish-fulfilling jewel,
[18] Among these, the most supreme, the holy nature, the pinnacle of the Great Perfection,
[19] Revealing the essence of suchness directly—by that, this day, protect the lotus-throne of my mind.
[20] The place of the teaching-ocean, the throne of the makara-holder,
[21] The sphere of the Vajra-essence, supreme among all,
[22] Clearly revealing the profound and vast abodes—
[23] The explanation of the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle I shall compose.
[24] When the nectar of the Dharma-body is obtained,
[25] And the Enjoyment-body complete,
[26] And the Emanation-body manifests,
[27] The ocean of Dharma-principles spoken by the Teacher,
[28] And the place,
[29] By the power of the teaching, arranged as three aspects through classification.
[30] The basis of perfect place, dharmatā luminous-clarity,
[31] In the precious field where appearance manifests spontaneously from the uncompounded display of qualities.
