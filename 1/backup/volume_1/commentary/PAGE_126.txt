Now Longchenpa explains the names and meanings of the eight sections. Listen, you who get lost in terminology! (lines 21-53)

Root: penetrated like roots—intends gathering into rigpa (line 23). Do you see? The root is not something to cling to. It is what gathers everything into the single nature of mind. Like tree roots drawing water from the earth, the root tantras draw all phenomena into the recognition of rigpa.

Explanation: spreading like leaves—intends merging words and meanings (line 25). Words and meanings merged—not separate! When you hear "rigpa," do you merge the word with the experience, or do they remain apart? This is the test.

Branch: coiled like a trunk—intends non-duality of space and awareness (line 27). The trunk supports everything. Space and awareness are not two things that need to be joined. They have never been separate, like a tree trunk and the space it occupies.

Scripture-logic: clear like a flower—intends holding and showing the lamp's self-face (line 31). A flower is beautiful, clear, unmistakable. When you see your true nature, it is like this—unmistakable, clear as a flower in bloom.

Upadesha: ripening like results—intends making three kāyas into paths (line 33). Ripening! This is not something you do. This is something that happens when conditions are present. The three kāyas are not destinations. They are the path itself.

Intention self-abiding: liberation path seeing—intends making results into paths (line 35). The result is already present, so it becomes the path. Do you understand? You are not going somewhere you are not. You are recognizing where you already are.

Entering self-liberation: mindfulness-awareness path cultivated, courageous ones—intends showing the lamp's very self-face (line 37). This takes courage! To look directly at your own mind without turning away. To see the lamp's own face—not the light it casts, but the lamp itself.

Expert ritual: complete upadesha scripture—intends protecting the holy teachings and abiding long (line 39). Protection, yes. But protection of what? The recognition in your own mind.

Then Longchenpa examines the letters (lines 41-53)—called "root"—dharma's root gathered into rigpa. Rigpa's root: emptiness, nature, grasped and freed (line 43). Holding that tantra: rigpa meets its own face (line 45). Worn: samādhi abides in itself (line 47). Read: expressed meanings appear in mind (line 49). Explained: supreme and common siddhis obtained (line 51). Meditated: samsara expelled (line 53).

Each word—root, holding, worn, read, explained, meditated—points to the same truth. The tantra is not outside. It is your own awareness, meeting its own face.
