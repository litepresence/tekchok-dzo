Watch the signs! Improvement arising—exert the primordial empowerment ritual. Accomplishment substance increasing—supreme siddhi obtained. Faith in equality meaning.

Entering empowerment, always see good signs. Common siddhis accomplished. Experience and knowledge possessed. Bliss and joy in conduct. Guru supreme, faith good—apply supreme mudra. See bliss in body, speech, self. This is Buddha's pure field.

Elaborationless empowerment—no particular year. Whoever knows the time. Summer and winter good. Waxing dates. Dawn when sounds clear. Five or six faith-possessing students—seven is too many for meaning to accomplish.

Faith-possessing son! Virtuous mind, praising guru with speech. At such empowerment time, if body bliss not, confess outer sins. Speech and mind too—start confession actions.

Very elaborationless—no elaborations at all. Supreme secret. Time and signs definite. Not particular year—self-suitable. Outer time: seed entering time, awakening seed supported. Grain and fruit gathering time. Wisdom fruit complete. Three kayas ground definitely go.

Inner time: waxing for increase, waning abandoned for stabilized experience. Blessing increasing. Sun tip risen—self-arisen wisdom arising. Or waning exhaustion middle—conception exhaustion.

Fortunate one or two only! Three is too many.
