[15476-15482] Listen, dear practitioner! At this time, place the mind into the net of four arisings—draw the wind inward, this is the oral instruction! Here, bliss arises, arises, stabilizes, special wisdom path obtained and so forth arises—from the effort stage.

[15483-15494] For women, do from the left. Relying on the channel location, taking into experience: pressing, holding, drawing, squeezing, binding, draining, hiding—these should be known. Hiding is ro ma's key point. Binding is rkyang ma's key point. Kun 'dar ma draining key point.

[15495-15502] Pressing minor channels, making into body's key point. Speech's key point, mind's key point. Dharmata arising, time holding. The certainty is no certainty. The no-certainty is your own face.

Do you see? You are trying too hard! Press, hold, draw—this is the path of effort. But recognize: the certainty you seek is no certainty! Stop grasping for results and recognize what is already present!

Emaho! No certainty is the supreme certainty!
