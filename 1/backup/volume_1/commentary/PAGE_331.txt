The construction continues. You're not off the hook just because you're already here.

When generation stage is properly practiced, the body's attachment-maker—the habit-energy that keeps you thinking "this is mine"—its definite action completes. The knot tightens. The construction firms up. Every moment you're not recognizing rigpa, you're adding another brick to the prison.

The Taste-Gathering Wheel starts spinning. Twelve sense-bases growing, expanding, accomplishing. Fire is the chief element here—heat, metabolism, transformation. What you eat becomes what you are. Food's taste-essence feeds the aggregates, fuels the elements, powers the sense-bases. And what doesn't serve? Excreted. Feces. Urine. The body takes what it needs and dumps the rest. You think you're more dignified than that? You're a processing plant wearing a human face.

Six tastes, six migrations completing in human form—this is the crucial point. Sweet builds complexion. Bitter sharpens radiance. Astringent produces majesty. Sour generates strength. Pungent sparks vitality. Salt awakens mind. Every flavor is medicine. Every sensation is pointing somewhere. You just need to stop flinching long enough to taste what you're tasting.

By day fifty-six, fire heat moves through the system. Wind spreads warmth. The body ripens like a frog developing in the egg—sense-powers clear but not yet strong. Limbs emerge. Movement becomes possible but coordination hasn't arrived. Eighty-five thousand fire-insects burning through the channels, igniting everything they touch. This is not metaphor. This is your nervous system lighting up.

To those of us with bodies, the body emanates. It just shows up. Complete. Functional. A universe of phenomena arising from "this is happening."

The numbers spiral: thirty-two channels, thirty-two syllables, sixty-four light-spheres, ninety-six. Samantabhadra father-mother principles multiplying into hundreds, then thousands. Six hundred sixty-six—the completion number, the fullness number. Not evil. Not conspiracy. Just completeness. The full inventory of what you are.

Here's what's being counted: every channel, every syllable, every light, every deity, every wisdom-being, every sense-base connection. All of it you. All of it already complete. All of it waiting for recognition.

You don't need to add anything. You need to stop subtracting from what was never divided.
