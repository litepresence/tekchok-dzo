Know meaning great penetrate thinking here well established (line 1). Second topic introduction definite enumerate explained two: generally shown and, particularly explained (lines 3-5). First is (line 6):

Secret unsurpassed tantras meanings minds types two bound explained, awareness self-appearance mind-possessors mind, tantra name-meaning division and, focus object mind-possessors mind tantra text definitely shown (lines 7-10).

Thus also from Talgyur (line 11): E MA tantra definite arisen, minds types two are, awareness self-appearance mind-possessors, tantra name-meaning divided, symbol sound meaning three by, reality direct path made, three realms saṃsāra continuum cut, outside reverse not, exhaustion characteristics know (lines 13-20). Focus object mind-possessors, tantra text meaning divided, whatever whatever certain key point, each key point inserted, not-separated completely realized, saṃsāra pure abide not, elaborations joy person, various means trained become, that also individual siddhis obtained (lines 21-29). Mind key point oral instruction, individual occasions know (lines 30-31). Thus it is spoken (line 32).

Here explanation manner four person's mind types liberated divided (line 33): mind elaborations with those introduction five perfections manner tantra outer explained, mind elaborations without those text meaning oral instruction definite inner explained, mind very elaborations without those name self-text realize secret explained, mind extremely elaborations without those tantra meaning condensed secret unsurpassed great perfection explained (lines 34-36). First is (line 37):

The tantra-body's introduction, which arises from the introduction-base, explains the meaning of the twofold introduction (lines 1-3 of next section). Second: those meanings are summarized through the eleven words of instruction, establishing the eleven categories of verbal meaning (lines 4-5). Third: thus the eleven are gathered into cutting-through and crossing-over, binding the two stages of practice, explained thus (lines 6-6). Fourth: all are gathered into the single meaning of direct awareness, suitable to awareness itself (line 7-7). Thus the fourfold Great Secret is established in meaning (line 8).

The root vajra's four bonds are named: the great Paṇḍita Vimalamitra's supreme view (lines 9-10). Second, explained particularly in three parts: the connection of the two introduction-bases, the individual meanings extensively explained, abandoning mistaken refutations (lines 11-14). First (line 15):

The tantra's meaning is summarized, the title shown, the twofold text. The body of the text arranged, the limbs extensively explained in two parts. The body extensively explained, briefly shown, gathered. Through the introduction-base, all tantras are shown to arise (lines 16-22).

From the Treasury (line 23): the clear sequence of words spoken, the title shown, and through the text, the minds of length and instant, variously. To be realized, variously explained. The twofold text-types distinguished. The body itself arranged, the limbs' meaning extensively divided. The body's introduction-base is twofold. Thus it is (lines 25-32).

Each of the two introductions: the teacher perfected, the place perfected, the retinue perfected, the dharma perfected, the time perfected, abiding as fivefold (lines 34-38).

From the Sun-Moon Union (line 39): the great secret tantras, possessing the five perfections. Common and uncommon, the seeds of the introduction-bases. Thus (lines 41-44).

Listen! Now we move from letters to the structure of tantra itself. Two types of mind—awareness self-appearance, and focus object. These are the two aspects: the subjective knower and the objective known. Yet in the tantra, they are not separate!

The four types of explanation: outer for those with elaborations, inner for those without, secret for those with very few elaborations, and secret unsurpassed great perfection for those with extremely few elaborations. This is the gradual approach, but also the direct approach. According to your capacity, so is the teaching given.

And the fourfold Great Secret—this is Vimalamitra's supreme view! The tantra's meaning summarized, the eleven categories, cutting-through and crossing-over, gathered into single meaning of direct awareness.

The five perfections again—teacher, place, retinue, dharma, time. But now we understand: these are not just formal elements. They are the very structure of how reality presents itself. When you recognize the five perfections, you recognize the mandala of your own experience.
