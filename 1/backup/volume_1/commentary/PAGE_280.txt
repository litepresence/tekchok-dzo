Dear practitioner, mark this distinction well! Lines [11648-11667] reveal the crucial difference between self-appearance and deluded-appearance!

Self appears to self—this is the natural display! Common world, common karma, teacher's activity arranged. But look! Self-appearance to self, though it seems like delusion, is actually the door of cyclic existence arranged by wisdom itself!

When the bundle of self-appearance transfers, it falls into common other-face—this is the bardo, the between! Now you exist in the common perception of others!

This distinction is most important! Nature awareness self-arises! Spontaneous presence manifests the six realms! Deluded-appearance, dream-like, primordially pure—this ground-appearance does not exist as self reversed! Send yourself back! This is the point!

In the bardo, self-face appears as emanations to benefit the six realms! But there are two aspects: impure cyclic existence not yet manifest—here self-appearance does not benefit because action and object do not appear! Once manifest from—benefit is needed!

If deluded-appearance is not empty, liberation is impossible! This point is subtle, most important!

The eight qualities generally shown, the fault-qualities divided by conditions—these are proof! Arise-cessation, appearance-mode, proof placed!

Like a mirror reflecting a face—the reflection appears but has no substance! Like a dream at night—you experience but nothing truly happens!

Know the difference between wisdom's display and delusion's trap!

Emaho! The subtle distinction between clarity and confusion!
