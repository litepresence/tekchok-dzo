From formations, root and limb's afflictions increase. From eighteen elements' proliferation-change, increase. Then four elements' individual power exhausted.

Two-by-two elements gathering, upon gathering-memory wheel, from each channel spreads moving channels—sixteen increasing, showing sixteen empowerments' increase.

Within each of those, one nature channel-abode letter, one five-light mass steadying that. Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abide. Thus also channels support body, body supports elements, syllable steadies wheel's dharma, light supports wisdom. Samantabhadra yab-yum supports three bodies—wisdom, body, dharmata. Light, abiding in own nature four—depending on these, four empowerments' result measure arrived.

Within gathering-memory wheel's sixteen channels, sixteen minds abide depending.

Mind and mind-itself's distinction: first, upon mind, gathering by water-mind holds mindfulness' thought-basis. By steadiness, mind's collection gathers. Radiating by fire-mind radiates to objects. Light by wind-mind moves.

Upon mind-itself: unborn meaning's mind-itself, unceasing mindfulness's mind-itself, unchanging example-meaning-mixed mind-itself, self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated mind-itself.

Upon mindfulness, mind and mental two from—mind's mindfulness as explained before. Mental's mindfulness six are:

First: thoroughly-searching mindfulness, pure—clear as god's body.

Second: impure—thrown into god's migration.

Third: perverted—thrown into wrong-attachment body.

Fourth: definitively-settling mental mindfulness, pure—awareness-holder obtained.

Fifth: impure—born as god-asura.

Sixth: perverted—into butcher's lineage.

Seventh: definitively-placing mental mindfulness, pure—space-dweller.

Here's the progression: from sixteen channels, sixteen minds. From sixteen minds, the nature of mind itself. The mind-itself is unborn, unceasing, unchanging, self-complete. This is what you are before confusion takes hold.

But then mindfulness starts. The first mindfulness is searching, pure, clear. If it remains pure, you become like a god, clear as a divine body. If it becomes impure, you're thrown into the realm of gods and asuras. If it becomes perverted, you fall into wrong attachment, butcher's lineage.

The next mindfulness: definitively settling. Pure—becoming awareness-holder, liberated. Impure—born among gods and asuras. Perverted—into the butchers.

The final mindfulness: definitively placing. Pure—becoming a space-dweller, fully liberated.

Same starting point. Same sixteen channels. Same sixteen minds. The difference is only whether mindfulness remains pure, becomes impure, or perverts.

You choose at every step. Each moment of mindfulness: will you search purely, settle definitively, place conclusively? Or will you slip into impurity, into perversion?

The results are certain. Pure path leads to liberation. Impure path leads to higher rebirth. Perverse path leads to lower realms.

Choose. Now. In this moment of mindfulness.
