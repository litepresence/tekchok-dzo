Sixty-two letters, one hundred twenty-four. Sixty-two lights, one hundred eighty-six. Samantabhadra father-mother combined—one hundred twenty-four.

Upon the producing-action wheel, three hundred ten distinctions of wisdom's movement. By pure wisdom's wind, jumping, dissolving, and so forth. The actions of calm-abiding and insight are certainly realized—thus "producing-action" is named. Being the basis of existence-body, thus "first" is named. Thus being the basis of all, thus "wheel" is named.

Special dharmas of elements, wind and so forth's enumeration. By affliction and action's work, by karmic wind's throwing—inhaling, laughing, holding. Thus day and night are determined.

Thus nine hundred thirty distinction-dharmas abiding are the basis of empowerment-path certainty, arose from this.

That also, from water-element wheel turning by twelve dependent-originations, eighty-five thousand insects abide. Each of those, within that many channels, that many letters—from each wind-throwing, none missing. Each body abiding, thus countless gathering-dharmas.

Basis-of-all is the basis of all. And also the basis of purification.

Then the basis-of-all body's support and these two mixed, the five sense-faculties' basis's empowerment support just abides. From day forty-six, by individual elements' action's power, the wheel of gathering-memory complete and gathered. Fire-particles increase. Bliss-suffering feelings increase. Perception and sense-bases. Consciousness entering objects' distinction increases.

The numbers are staggering. Sixty-two, one hundred twenty-four, three hundred ten, nine hundred thirty, eighty-five thousand, countless. You're made of numbers. Arranged, counted, calculated. Every part has its number, every letter its place.

But the numbers aren't you. The numbers are the construction. You're what counts the numbers. You're what knows the arrangements.

The basis-of-all is the basis of all—basis of purification too. Same thing. The ground of confusion and the ground of clarity are one ground. The path of suffering and the path of liberation are one path.

Which one you walk depends on recognition. The channels are the same. The letters are the same. The lights are the same. Only the recognition changes.

Recognize and it's purification. Don't recognize and it's contamination. The choice is always available.

Now. In this moment. Before the next moment's construction adds more numbers, more letters, more channels.

Recognize now. Or add another number to the count.
