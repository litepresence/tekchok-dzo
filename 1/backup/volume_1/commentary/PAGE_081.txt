[2994]

Listen, you who wish to know your own mind! Longchenpa shows you something here that you have never truly seen, though it is right in front of your face every moment of your life.

Look at lines 2994-3001: The holding consciousness arises from mind. Just as an egg splits and life emerges, your perception of outer objects and inner consciousness arises from a single source. You think there are two—outer object and inner perceiver—but this is the root of your confusion! When you look at a mountain, where is the boundary between the seeing and the seen? Can you find it?

Consider the monkey in the fortress, lines 3004-3006. Your consciousness rushes through the five doors of the senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body—like a monkey darting through four windows, looking here, looking there. But notice: it is ONE monkey, ONE consciousness that knows all these objects. At the moment of knowing, can you separate the knower from the known? They are not different in nature—like a dream appearance and the dreamer, both undifferentiated in a single sleep consciousness (line 3008).

You spend your life chasing false aspects, lines 3010-3014. You think the outer world is truly established, but it is merely a mistaken appearance, a false latent tendency. What you experience as "truth" is just your own imputation. The meeting of object and consciousness is itself false—neither truly exists as you believe.

The ultimate truth, lines 3019-3021: Non-dual primordial wisdom exists with its qualities. Nothing is established as consciousness. The dharmakaya of the Buddha has nothing remaining. Do you understand? This wisdom is not somewhere else—it is your own awareness when you stop grasping at duality.

Like clouds that seem solid but dissolve when you fly through them, your thoughts and perceptions appear real but have no substantial existence. Rest in the open sky of your own mind, free from the extremes of existence and non-existence. This is not a philosophy to think about—it is your immediate experience, right now, if you would only recognize it!

Do not seek this elsewhere. Look at your own mind. What is it? Where is it? When you search, you find nothing solid—yet awareness remains, clear and luminous. This is the dharmakaya, plain and simple. Why do you wander in samsara when liberation is already present?
