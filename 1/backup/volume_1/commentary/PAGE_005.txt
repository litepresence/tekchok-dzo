[112-114] Let me repeat this because it's so crucial: "All sentient-beings' realms exist. The training-field is very vast." Your life, right now, with all its problems and pleasures, is the training field. You're not waiting for some better circumstances to practice. You're not waiting until you finish this project or solve that problem. This very moment, with all its chaos and confusion, is the mandala of enlightenment. The question is: do you recognize it or not?

[115-125] "Numberless fields beyond measure appear even in one particle-place of sentient-beings' confused appearance." Think about this! In every tiny experience, infinite worlds are present. When you look at a speck of dust, Buddhas are teaching there. Pure lands are manifesting there. Hell realms and god realms are both present. How? Because these aren't physical locations—they're different ways that the display of awareness can be perceived based on different karmic conditioning.

The text describes how to pure karma, Buddha's activities appear variously—teaching, dwelling in nirvana, enjoying bliss-fruit. But to impure karma, the same space appears as lower realms, suffering, destruction. It's like how in a dream, the same room can appear as a palace or a prison depending on the dreamer's mind. The space itself doesn't change—only the perception changes.

[125-134] Now comes the quotation from the Arya Samadhi King Sutra, and you should read this as a direct description of your own experience, not as mythology. "Even in the extent of a hair-tip, many Buddhas, as many as the sands of the Ganga river..." Your body is filled with infinite Buddhas. Every cell is a Buddha-field. Every moment contains infinite eons. This is the actual nature of reality, not a poetic exaggeration. The reason you don't see it is because you're looking through the lens of conceptual mind, which collapses the infinite into finite categories.

The sutra describes how in the same space, hell-beings experience suffering while gods experience bliss, without mixing or becoming harmful. This is describing the interpenetration of all phenomena—the fact that multiple realities can coexist in the same space without contradiction when you drop the notion of solid, separate things. It's like how multiple radio stations can broadcast through the same space without interfering with each other—you just tune to different frequencies.

[135-161] "In that place, many mountains... unbearable hell-beings experiencing unpleasantness... gods' palaces... twelve leagues of pleasantness..." All of this is happening right now, in your direct experience. Not somewhere else, not in some other dimension, but right here. The same awareness that knows these words is the awareness that experiences all of these realms. There's no fundamental separation between you and any being in any realm. The only difference is the karmic perception—the particular way that awareness is manifesting based on causes and conditions.

"Humans in their own houses like dreams, intoxicated with joy in desire-qualities, waking after, not seeing that desire. That is known as dream by that." This is you! You're walking around in your own house, your own life, completely absorbed in the play of desire, not recognizing it as a dream. But the moment you wake up—when rigpa recognizes itself—you see that all of it was just the display of awareness, never separate from the nature of mind. The desire wasn't real. The grasping wasn't real. The suffering wasn't real. Only awareness is real, and it was never apart from you.

"Thus seeing, hearing, knowing, and distinguishing differences, all these are untrue, like dreams." Your entire world—everything you see, hear, think, feel—is like a dream. It appears, it functions, it has consequences, but ultimately it's empty of inherent existence. It's the play of awareness, manifesting in infinite forms, but never separate from its own nature. This isn't nihilism—it's not saying nothing exists. It's saying that what exists is the display of awareness, which is luminous and empty inseparably. And that display is happening right here, right now, as your own direct experience.
