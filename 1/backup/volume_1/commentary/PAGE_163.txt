The teachings continue through seven more stages, each with its protector buddha, each lasting through countless eons.

Third: Brahma thousand Yama, world protector. Fourth: Sun thousand king. Fifth: Jvalamukha, web protector buddha. Sixth: Light-rays thousand rim protector. Seventh: Saṃsāra-destroyer, the conquering king.

Across sixty-four thousand eons, the secret essence is held, beings benefit, until finally Vajradhara—the great holder—arranges the Brahma-great eon. The entire sequence spans what words cannot express, numbers cannot contain.

The lineage: first comes the secret conduct, the seed tantra. Then, in each eon, different buddhas appear, different retinues gather, different liberation paths unfold. Smṛti protector, the superior mindfulness. The mudra of self-awareness, the wheel of recognition. Distinctions beyond words.

In that first eon, seventy thousand times, the supreme mudra is held. Then wisdom exhausted, essence understood, lineages of nine or ten holders maintaining the definite mudra.

All of this arising from the blessing of buddhas, from the self-arisen great letters, from primordial purity. The teaching has been self-arisen since the beginning, maintained through blessing, passed down through many eons.

The Great Arrangement continues: primordial buddhas arranging thousand-fold maṇḍalas. Then the second teaching through Śikhin, world protector, the supreme mudrā. Then the third through Brahma thousand Yama. Fourth through sun thousand. Fifth through Jvalamukha. Sixth through light-rays. Seventh through all-pervading Saṃsāra-destroyer.

Sixty-four thousand eons, countless buddhas, the secret great held entirely. The definite teaching of the buddhas through nineteen hundred thousand essence mudrās.

The numbers are overwhelming—not to impress you, but to show you something: this teaching has been maintained across spans of time your mind cannot fathom. It hasn't failed. It hasn't disappeared. It's been held, passed down, preserved through eon after eon.

You're not the first. You won't be the last. The stream is vast. The lineage is unbroken. The holders before you number beyond measure.

Your job isn't to create something new. Your job is to receive what's already being transmitted, to become part of the unbroken stream. The teaching has survived a hundred thousand eons. It doesn't need you to fix it. It needs you to receive it.

That's all. Just receive.
