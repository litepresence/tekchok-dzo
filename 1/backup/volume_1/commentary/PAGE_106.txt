[3915-3925] Here's the punchline of dzogchen: essence has no dharma to hold onto. Even "buddha" becomes just a word, pointing at nothing you can grasp. The view and meditation aren't something you measure—they're the natural appearance of samsara and nirvana themselves. No characteristics to pin down, no positions to defend.

Afflictions? When you see them clearly, they release themselves. They don't need your rejection. Acceptance and rejection—both dissolve when there's no one holding either side. This is the path beyond paths: when the very idea of walking toward enlightenment is exhausted.

Longchenpa speaks of the "gtar-ka"—that membrane, that veiling, that translucent barrier between you and the view. When it clears, there's no longer samsara here and nirvana over there. The boundary was always just confusion. Clear seeing and the confusion it dissolves? Same energy. Not two.

[3926-3940] Now he breaks it down into view, meditation, and conduct—and you need to understand what "heat" (gtum mo) means here. It's not sexual energy. It's the burning intensity of non-distraction. When view becomes hot, samsara and nirvana fuse like water mixing with water. When you stabilize that heat, the distinction between them vanishes like an army dispersing.

For meditation: the movement is gathering—wind and mind condensing like entering a treasure house. The attainment is finding the path. The stability is empowerment itself—like a lineage holder receiving transmission.

[3941-3949] Conduct brings the outer display. When it's active, you see the knowing reach out like garuḍa spreading wings. When stable, the three bodies are fully present—not as concepts but as total engagement.

Notice the pattern: view purifies the view, meditation purifies the meditation, conduct purifies the conduct. No external antidote. No purification of something other than itself. That's dzogchen in a nutshell. You don't fix mind. You recognize mind never needed fixing. Whatever appears—mind doesn't conceptualize it because there's no separate mind to do the conceptualizing.

Rest there. Not doing view, not doing meditation, not doing conduct. Just resting in what's already uncontrived.
