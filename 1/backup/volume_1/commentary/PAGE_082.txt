[3022]

You who read these words—stop and look! What is this non-dual primordial wisdom that Longchenpa speaks of in lines 3022-3023? It is not something distant or difficult. It is the stainless suchness of your own mind, right here, right now.

You think that when slight stains of latent tendencies appear, like taste or sickness (lines 3024-3025), you are somehow polluted. But look closer! When mind is purified of the false part of affliction, what remains? The pure wisdom of the remainder manifests (lines 3026-3027). Like the sun hidden behind clouds—the sun was never damaged, never stained. Only your perception was obscured.

The Middle Way schools argue endlessly, lines 3035-3044. Some say all is illusion; others say nothing abides. But you—do not get caught in their net! Whether you call it illusion or call it empty, you are still playing with concepts. The reality itself is beyond all such names.

Look at the example Longchenpa gives, lines 3061-3062: When you awaken from a dream, the appearance of horse and ox stops. They were never truly there! So too with your waking life—all these appearances that seem so solid, so real, where do they go when you recognize their true nature?

The consequentialist Middle Way, lines 3078-3086, goes beyond all assertions. Not existence, not non-existence, not both, not neither. The wise one does not even abide in the middle! Why? Because the middle is also a concept, a position, a place to cling.

You want to know the truth? Stop looking with your intellect. The intellect is like a bird flying in the sky—it leaves no trace. The truth is not found by thinking; it is found by recognizing what has always been present. Like a mute tasting sugar—he knows the sweetness but cannot describe it. Your awareness knows itself, but words cannot capture it.

Rest in that which cannot be established by thought. This is the summit of the Buddhas' view. Not a view to hold, but a view that dissolves all holding.
