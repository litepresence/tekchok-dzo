Listen, you who would practice! Lines 8005-8012 describe the complete sequence—approach, accomplishment, close approach. You think these are activities to complete! But they are descriptions of how recognition deepens. Like a lotus opening—approach the light, accomplish the opening, close by fully blooming.

The preparation at lines 7904-7911—time ripened, earth ritual, deity, vase, student preparation. You prepare everything externally! But the real preparation is preparing your mind. Like cleaning a window—so the light can come through clearly.

Lines 7912-7933 detail the actual empowerment sequence—external, internal, secret, completely-perfect four. You want to receive these from someone! But the real giver is your own awareness. Like a light turning on—you don't receive light from outside, you simply remove the obstruction.

Śrāvaka occasion at lines 7913-7927—hair-cutting, robes, vows, bowl. You think these are just for monks! But they symbolize cutting attachment, wearing the Dharma, taking the vow of recognition, holding the bowl of wisdom. Like a costume that helps you play the role—until you realize you are the role.

The mantra vehicle three empowerment complete at lines 7927-7933—water, crown, vajra, bell earnest empower. You receive these and feel accomplished! But receiving is just the beginning. Like receiving a seed—you must plant and tend it for the fruit to come.

Lines 7934-7941: each external internal secret completely-perfect four-four twelve. You count the empowerments! But one moment of genuine recognition contains them all. Like a single drop of water contains the whole ocean's nature.
