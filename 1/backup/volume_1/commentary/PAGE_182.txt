[7364]
PAGE 182 COMMENTARY

You who read these words—stop and look! Lines 7364-7371 speak of glory, good qualities, Buddha fields manifest. Do you think these are somewhere far away, in some pure land you'll reach after death? Foolish! The field is right here, right now. Like the open sky that holds all clouds yet remains untouched, your own awareness is the Buddha field.

Look at lines 7373-7376: accumulations gathered, hundred-thousand increase great. You calculate merit like a merchant counting coins! This mind-meaning accomplishes all. Like a single lamp that lights a thousand other lamps without being diminished, the recognition of your true nature accomplishes more than eons of counting beads.

The root guru offerings at lines 7383-7387—food, drink, wealth, men, women—you think these are external things to give? The real offering is your own grasping mind released. Like opening your fist to find you've been holding nothing but air all along. That release is the offering.

Listen to lines 7388-7393: the guru as ten-direction Buddhas gathered, unsurpassed wheel turning. You search for gurus everywhere, traveling to distant mountains and caves. But who breathes in your body right now? Who knows these words as you read them? That is the guru, closer than your own heartbeat.

The empowerment time, celebration time—hundred-thousand increase great at line 7393. Every moment of recognition is this celebration. Like a spring that bubbles up fresh water endlessly, each instant of non-distraction is more precious than all the gold in the world.

What are you waiting for? The time is now. The place is here. Your own mind is the mandala.
