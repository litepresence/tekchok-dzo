[11392-11420] Listen here, dear practitioner! For example, clouds in the sky truly do not exist—clouds are adventitious, arisen and passing. Likewise, base, path, and awareness do not truly exist as separate things!

Compassion arises, yet non-recognition also arises. The base is called the state of spontaneous accomplishment—attach to this! That also is not determined; great appearance dwells as one. That also possesses the eight aspects of the arising way, called the state of the jewel casket.

The door of desire-objects does not cease—great establishment dwells as non-establishment. The door of compassion's arising does not cease. The enjoyment of primordial-wisdom's arising does not cease. The essence of form's arising does not cease. The view of non-dual arising is not determined. The method of liberation from limits does not cease. The gate of pure primordial-wisdom is thoroughly reached. The compassion of impure arising does not cease.

Desire-objects are like jewels—attach to form like that! The inner youth vase form is called extent-open. The outer state of spontaneous accomplishment dwells as that. At that time, your appearance spreads outward. Not clear, not unclear; not shattered, not unshattered; not scattered, not unscattered; not distracted, not undistracted—moving, flickering, spreading as variety. Then great attachment to spontaneous accomplishment's state!

[11421-11452] That primordial-wisdom's door does not cease—complete cause, enjoyment-appearance way attaches. Quality's door does not cease—nature's emanation form. Compassion's door does not cease—impure appearance.

The great dharma of appearance's limit is not thought, not reached. Light-form clear, spontaneously thick, arranged. Samsara-nirvana's gate of arising is vast. All contained in the great cavity!

Emaho! The great cavity of spontaneous accomplishment contains all!
