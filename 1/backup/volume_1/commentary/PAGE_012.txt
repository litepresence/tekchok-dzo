[366-374] Third, the method of turning the wheel through emanation-body: from the enjoyment-body appearance, gone to emanation-body, twelve earth teachers clearly emanated in twelve abodes, possessing five-five perfections. This is describing how the teaching manifests in the Nirmanakaya dimension—the dimension of physical form and ordinary perception. The twelve teachers in twelve abodes represent the complete display of enlightened activity in the world.

The three emanations of body, speech, and mind are "not made by anyone, fearless." This is important! The emanations aren't created by someone deciding to create them. They self-arise from the nature of awareness as natural expressions of compassion. They're fearless because they come from the recognition that there's nothing to fear—no separation, no threat, no real obstruction.

[375-382] By self-arisen blessing, miracles and immeasurable qualities—possessing the activity of immediately liberating birth when meeting with whichever. This is describing the power of the teaching. When recognition dawns, birth is liberated immediately. Not gradually, not eventually, but right now. The "meeting" isn't a physical encounter; it's the meeting of recognition—when the disciple's awareness recognizes its own nature.

The three supports are described: mind-support Vajra (for disease-free), speech-support self-arisen letter (liberated by meeting and hearing), and body-support (liberating into clear light when meeting). These are describing how the teaching manifests in form. The Vajra, the letter, the body—they're all supports for recognition. When you encounter them with recognition, liberation is instantaneous.

[383-397] The text explains where these exist and for how long. They abide in different places by the times of body, speech, and mind teachings. The durations are given in cosmic timeframes—thousand Buddhas, various five hundreds and thousands of years. Don't get caught up in the numbers! This is describing the longevity of the teaching, how it remains in the world for the benefit of beings. The Vajra exists in Uddiyana, the letter held by dakinis in the sky—these are descriptions of terma, of hidden treasures that manifest when the time is right. The teaching isn't lost; it's always present, waiting for the right conditions to reveal itself.
