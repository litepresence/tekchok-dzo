You who accomplish miracles! Lines 1-6 describe first ground's seven knower-miracles—emanating body hundred-thousand, limbs hundred-thousand, one body hundred-thousand heads, hundred-thousand bodies one head, one head emanating hundred-thousand different scattering five, emanating immeasurable heads limbs six, emanating various births seven. You emanate! But emanation is display. Like a magician—appears to create.

Second ground at lines 32-39—opening belly showing lung-heart, burning fire upper bubbling water lower, cutting limbs scattering, five senses falling, throwing mountain, lifting ocean, planets stars falling seven. You display powers! But powers are signs. Like strength—shown through action.

Third ground at lines 41-46—binding wind-rope, transforming beings' intention, liberating world-protecting god-kings, captivating dakinis' minds, healing hundred beings, playing gods' nāgas' yakṣas' maidens, diminishing great world-gods' power seven. You liberate and play! But liberation is freedom. Like releasing a bird—flies freely.

Fourth ground at lines 7-14—transforming sky vajra, fire water, water fire, earth fire, earth water, wind fire, fire wind seven. You transform! But transformation is mastery. Like an alchemist—changes lead to gold.
