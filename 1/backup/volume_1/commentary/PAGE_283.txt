COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 283

You who struggle with conditions! Longchenpa speaks at lines [11782-11788] of the emergence of appearance, individual path, pure primordial-awareness great door, direct manner three-as manifest. This not-exist self-potency not-complete-therefore. You think something is missing. You think if only you had better conditions, more time, less distraction, then you could practice. Foolish! The pure primordial awareness great door is always manifest. The three kayas are directly present. If you do not see this, it is not because conditions are bad. It is because your own potency is not recognized as complete.

At lines [11789-11801], second condition-by fault quality part divide-do is. Camphor that fever-to quality-as appearance-in, cold-to fault-as manifest-although, camphor essence-to fault and quality not-establish like. Base and base-appearance emergence-mode that-also self face know those-to liberation-condition-as appearance-therefore quality like manifest-in. Not-know-if part-only delusion base make-do fault like appearance-although. Base and that appearance fault quality-as establish not-exist. Condition divides fault and quality. But look at camphor—it appears as quality to fever, as fault to cold. Yet in the essence of camphor, neither fault nor quality is established. So too with the base and base-appearance emergence-mode. If you know your own face, it appears as liberation-condition, quality-like. If you do not know, only part-delusion, making the base into fault-like appearance. But base and appearance—fault and quality are not established in them. Fault itself quality-as manifests. Condition is a bad helper—fault self-pure liberates. Spontaneous presence potency appearance essence-from primordial-awareness like manifests.

At lines [11802-11817], delusion enter-mode like-in afflictions-by fault mode-as delude-in, spontaneous-presence instant desire delusion reverse potency-from, self as-it-is self-place-as appearance-therefore fault quality-as become-therefore, obstacle attainment-as become-therefore, middle cut-do demon and afflictions not-find-therefore, quality-also not-observed primordial-awareness four gathering direct manifest, spontaneous-presence appearance-mode part-from nondual-as manifest-in, delusion enter-mode like-in self other two-as become-in, delusion reverse-mode like-in self other two-as not-divide-by, not-modify-by self-place-as place-therefore, selfless emptiness quality-as establish-therefore fault seek-in not-find-therefore, cyclic-existence transcendence two nondual-as buddha. In delusion's enter-mode, afflictions delude by fault-mode. But spontaneous presence—instant desire, delusion's reverse potency—self as-it-is appears in self-place, therefore fault becomes quality, obstacle becomes attainment. Middle cut—demons and afflictions not found. Quality also not observed—primordial awareness four gatherings directly manifest. From spontaneous presence appearance-mode, nondual manifests. In delusion enter-mode, self and other become two. In delusion reverse-mode, self and other not divided by—not modifying, self-place as place. Selfless emptiness quality established—fault sought, not found. Cyclic existence and transcendence, two, nondual—as Buddha.

At lines [11813-11818], again spontaneous-presence appearance-mode-from extreme liberation like manifest-in, cyclic-existence enter-mode like-in thought collection fault-as downward delude-therefore, delusion reverse-mode like-in extreme two middle-as become-therefore extreme delusion self-liberate-therefore delusion primordial-awareness-as manifest-from buddha, again spontaneous-presence quality part-from pure primordial-awareness door become-in. Again from spontaneous presence appearance-mode, extreme liberation manifests. In cyclic existence enter-mode, thought collection fault-as downward deludes. In delusion reverse-mode, extreme two become middle—extreme delusion self-liberates, delusion manifests as primordial awareness, from Buddha. Again from spontaneous presence quality part, pure primordial awareness door becomes.

So do not blame your conditions. Do not say "I cannot practice because..." The camphor does not change. The fault and quality are your own projection. Know your own face, and the same condition becomes liberation. The same delusion becomes wisdom. The same appearance becomes the display of primordial awareness. This is the great secret. This is why Longchenpa is the treasure-revealer of your own mind.
