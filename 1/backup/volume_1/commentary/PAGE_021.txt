Listen, you who read these words about world-systems arising—do you think this is mere geography? Longchenpa is not giving you a map for your intellect to possess. He is showing you how your own mind fabricates worlds.

You read of space, wind, water, earth, fire, and sky—these five elements. But look at your own experience. When you sit in meditation, where does this "world" come from? Does it arise from outside, or does it dawn from the expanse of your own awareness? Like mist rising from a valley when the sun warms it—worlds appear, yet nothing has truly come from anywhere.

The text speaks of a triangle of space, the syllable E, the seed from which all manifests. You, practitioner—do you not see that your own mind is this triangle? Empty, clear, without obstruction, yet from it arise all appearances like rays from a lamp. You search for the world's beginning in ancient eons, but have you found the beginning of your own thought? Turn around and look—where does this very thought arise from? Trace it back, and you will find no starting point. No triangle. No seed. Only the natural state, wide open like the sky at dawn.

Longchenpa mentions twenty intermediate eons passed, elements arising from clear space. You think this happened long ago? It happens every moment. Each breath—worlds dissolve and arise. Each blink—aeons pass. The world you think you see right now is no more solid than a cloud formation. Look at a cloud: it appears, it takes shape, you give it names, and then—where does it go? Not to some cloud-cemetery. It simply returns to what it never left. Your world is like this.

Do not grasp at these cosmological descriptions as something to memorize. Instead, recognize what they point to: your own mind's power to manifest. The container-world and the essence-beings—are they two? Are they separate from the one who perceives them? You perceive hells and heavens, yet where are they located except in the expanse of your experience? A nightmare is terrifying while you dream, but upon waking, where has it gone? So too with all realms.

The victorious ones teach these cosmologies not that you might become a scholar of worlds, but that you might see through the world-making tendency of your own mind. When you recognize that all worlds are mind, then the need to flee from one realm to another falls away. Where will you go that is outside mind? What realm can you find that is not made of awareness?

So read these words, but read them as a finger pointing at your own face. The triangle, the seed-syllables, the aeons of formation—are any of them separate from the awareness that right now hears these words? Rest in that recognition. Let the intellect exhaust itself trying to measure worlds. You simply rest, open and clear, like space itself.
