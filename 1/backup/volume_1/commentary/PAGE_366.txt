[15264-15271] Two empty channels dwell in the mouth! One like a lotus—on the tongue's top it dwells. That also has two-by-two: pea-green color and hollow-green color—two aspects dwell. Those have thirty-thirty! The channel's moon-thousand—three with petals, possessing three!

[15272-15288] Black color, hook shape—three are spiraled! Those also have thirty-thirty! These channel forms—elements' method and vital-point cause—practitioners must know! Wind and bindu gathering vital-point, consciousness's horse and essence—know as five-by-five! Wind and bile, phlegm, gathering, and four aspects! Desire-aggregate, delusion, hatred—from these they transform! Those characteristics—each also three-three! Sphere, heat, dwelling...

Do you see, practitioner? Your tongue alone holds sixty channels! Sixty doorways to recognition! Every taste, every speech, every breath—channels dancing their dance! Don't let this knowledge become mere counting! Each number is a finger pointing—follow it to your own face! Emaho!
