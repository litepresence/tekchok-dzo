[9476]
PAGE 234 COMMENTARY

Ah, you who attain the qualities! Lines 9464-9469 describe through extremely unelaborate—mind purifying, samadhi, awareness, whatever contemplated appears reality, four times one time realizing, death-transition birth knowing. You purify and realize! But realization is recognition. Like waking from dream—suddenly clear.

Through completely unelaborate at lines 9470-9473—workable mind, clairvoyance, life's measure not existing blessing. You become workable! But workable means flexible. Like water—takes any shape.

Particularly four empowerments at lines 9473-9477—four appearances quality, elaboration reality direct appearance, unelaboration experience increase, extremely unelaborate awareness measure, completely unelaborate reality exhausted appearance. You obtain qualities! But qualities arise naturally. Like flowers in spring—appear naturally.

Those each-and-every at lines 9478-9483—outer appearance quality, inner experience samadhi, secret view-contemplation, complete teaching measure, contaminated not appearing, Buddha ground connect. You connect to ground! But ground is base. Like foundation—supports all.
