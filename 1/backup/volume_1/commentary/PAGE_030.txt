Now we enter subtle territory—the formless realm, the peak of existence. The text describes wind goddesses, water goddesses, naga power-possessing sons. Padma's speech sound radiating all directions, summoned by sound.

You read this and think of higher deities, more refined beings. But listen carefully: these are not beings separate from you. They are the subtle elements of your own mind when it approaches the formless absorptions. The wind goddesses are the subtle movements of conceptual mind. The water goddesses are the fluidity of awareness. The nagas are the powerful currents of energy that lie dormant until activated by practice.

The previous formless ripened consciousness, latency-abiding seeds, manifestly awakened. This is the ripening of your own karma, practitioner. The seeds you have planted through practice begin to sprout. The consciousness that was held in latency—hidden, potential—now manifests. But it is still consciousness. It is still formless, but it is still an ayatana, a base, a foundation. It is not liberation.

Samadhi's emanation body—consciousness accomplished as this body. Own appearance completely-piercing-through arisen. Body's portion without-not is. The text is describing the formless gods' bodies. But these are subtle bodies, made of consciousness alone. They are the most refined grasping at self. Even here, in the peak of existence, there is grasping. Even here, there is the thought "I am," "I exist," "I am conscious without end."

Subtle mind, coarse flesh-blood, clear light body three—whichever not-established, existing also not, thus existence non-existence's realms. This is the key. In the formless realm, the coarse body is abandoned. The clear light body is realized. But subtle mind remains. And where there is mind, there is existence. Where there is existence, there is non-existence. The duality remains.

Samadhi completely-emanating body that itself: part existing appears, part without appears, thus existence non-existence called. The formless gods exist in a state where they neither fully exist nor fully do not exist. They have transcended form, but they have not transcended consciousness. They dwell in peace, but it is the peace of suppression, not the peace of recognition.

Sūraṅgama samādhi—the heroic samadhi. Under mind completely-play wheel-possessing called sky, gold great vajra one upward arose. This is the highest absorption, where the vajra of consciousness stands upright, immovable. Light-rays immeasurable radiating. Extremely beautiful heroic manner possessing. The gods who achieve this see the vajra and enter it. They think they have reached the ultimate.

But then—the emanation vajra that mind extremely moved. From those realms' nature arisen realm that to, some drop-like surpassing cast. Upper Sūraṅgama samādhi from lapsed. "What also not" said. Even at the peak, the fall begins. Even the highest samadhi is impermanent. The mind moves. The vajra that seemed so stable begins to shake. The drop is cast down. The samadhi lapses. And from the peak of "nothing at all," the descent begins.

This is the tragedy of the formless gods. They achieve the highest peace within samsara, but they do not transcend samsara. They still move. They still change. They still fall. Only recognition of the nature of mind liberates. Only seeing that all these states—desire, form, formless—are equal in emptiness. Only that is true liberation.
