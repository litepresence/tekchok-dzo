You who practice deity yoga—look! Lines 3206-3208: Looking at the aspects of self, speech, and beings as master and servant, obstacles cease and accomplishments are obtained. Depending on common accomplishments, conventional truth is not abandoned. Depending on supreme accomplishments, ultimate truth is not established—thus surpassing.

This is the key! You do not abandon conventional truth—the forms, the rituals, the practices. But you do not establish ultimate truth as something separate either. Like a bird flying through the sky—it uses the sky but does not grasp it as "mine." It flies without leaving a trace.

The main activity of visualization, line 3209: Meditating on deity through the generation and completion stages, the subtle radiating and gathering. You visualize the deity's form, speech, and mind as the collection of forms, sounds, and thoughts (line 3210). But here is what you must understand: you are not creating something that does not exist. You are recognizing what has always been!

Now the fifth vehicle, Upāya, lines 3235-3245: Since one desires conduct as Kriyā and view as Yoga, it is called the neutral vehicle. Through bathing and purity, making the three doors pure. Accomplishing the supreme mandala and so forth through the five manifest enlightenments. View as Yoga, conduct as Kriyā. Therefore it is called the both tantra.

You see the progression? In Kriyā, you were servant to the deity. In Upāya, you balance—conduct like Kriyā, view like Yoga. You are moving closer to the recognition of non-duality. It is like walking up a mountain path—each step brings you higher, closer to the summit.

The sixth vehicle, Yoga tantra, line 3246: Through the five doors of manifest enlightenment, viewing self and deity as brothers and friends, conducting samaya and purity. Now you and the deity are equals! Brothers, friends—not master and servant. You have realized that the deity's nature and your nature are the same.

The five manifest enlightenments, lines 3270-3276: Through sun and moon, relying on means and wisdom. Through the door of completely perfect form adornment. Through the wheel of syllables and letters. Through the vajra of mind, signs, and embrace. Through doors such as wheels and jewels. Through the door of completely pure primordial wisdom beings.

These are not just rituals to perform. They are descriptions of your own nature! Sun and moon—method and wisdom. Form adornment—your body as deity. Syllables and letters—your speech as mantra. Mind and signs—your thoughts as wisdom.

Why do you search for enlightenment elsewhere when it is your own face?
