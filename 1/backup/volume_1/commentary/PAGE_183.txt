Listen, you fortunate one! Lines 7395-7402 speak of great celebration worship—guru and retinue, mother with all. But do you see? The guru is not outside. Like a dreamer creating the whole world of the dream from their own mind, the guru appears from your own awareness.

The feast celebration at lines 7406-7414—vajra siblings, one, two, three, hundred-thousand—you think this is about gathering people in a room? No! It's the gathering of all phenomena into the expanse of your own mind. Like rivers flowing into the great ocean, all experiences dissolve into the nature of mind.

Look at lines 7415-7418: great result food drink feast, yogis pleased, good accomplished, faults liberated. What food? What drink? The nourishment is recognition itself. Like a person dying of thirst finally finding water, this recognition satisfies completely. No other feast compares.

The yoginis gathering at lines 7419-7431—eight mothers, pig mother, feast offerings. You get confused by these forms! They are your own energies, your own channels and winds made manifest. Like seeing your own reflection and thinking it another person—foolish! It's you.

Lines 7436-7441 speak of world's desired meaning, wisdom sphere conduct, sky-goers siddhi. You want siddhis? The greatest siddhi is right here: your own awareness knowing itself. Like a mute person tasting sugar—cannot describe it, cannot show it, but knows it completely.

This celebration at line 7451—greatly done, special time, siddhi obtained. Don't postpone it! Like a person who says "I'll look in the mirror tomorrow"—why wait? Look now! See your own face! This is the great feast.
