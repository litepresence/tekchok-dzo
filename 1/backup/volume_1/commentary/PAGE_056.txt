PAGE 56 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa speaks of the Bodhisattva vehicle's stages [2802-2831], and you must hear this as your own potential! The bodhisattva is not some special being, some saint far beyond you. The bodhisattva is the nature of your own mind when it recognizes its connection to all beings.

What makes the bodhisattva vehicle superior? Great compassion as method, and wisdom realizing both selflessnesses [2802]. Method without wisdom becomes mere worldly virtue—you accumulate merit but remain in samsara's garden. Wisdom without method becomes cold isolation—you free yourself but leave everyone behind. But when method and wisdom unite in a single mind, this is the Great Vehicle, the path that leads to complete awakening.

From the Ratnavali: "Emptiness with compassion as essence—this accomplishes enlightenment for some" [2802]. This is the alchemical formula! Emptiness is not nihilism; it is the space in which compassion can function without limit. Compassion is not sentimentality; it is the natural response to suffering when you see no separate beings, only the play of conditions.

The bodhisattva's aspiration and dedication [2802] transforms everything. You do not practice to escape; you practice to return, to remain, to help. Even after you could enter cessation, you choose birth after birth, appearance after appearance, until all beings are free. This is the meaning of "foe-destroyer" in the Mahayana—not one who destroys outer enemies, but one who destroys the inner foes of affliction, and then continues to work for others.

The definition: "depending on whatever method, leading to the supreme great city of liberation" [2818]. Notice—methods are many! Skillful means are limitless. But the destination is one: the recognition of what has always been true, the liberation that was never bound.

And the fruit? The eleventh ground, All-Illumination [2818]—not separate from the first ground, not different from your present state. It is this very awareness, fully recognized, completely unobscured. You do not become something new; you simply see what has never been hidden.
