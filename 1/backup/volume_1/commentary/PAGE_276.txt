[11453-11459] *Rin po che spungs pa* tantra: "Kye ma! Teacher Samantabhadra! Ground's appearing mode how? Virtues' appearing door how much? From emptiness how virtues complete mode—tell me!" Then he spoke:

[11460-11477] "From birthless miracle, Buddhas' activity—primordially without division! Not ceasing, also not ceasing! Appearance itself primordially pure! In own face dwelling! From non-dividing great compassion! Spontaneous presence imputation uncertain! Eight appearing modes arisen! That appearance mode not ceasing! From compassion-like appearing mode! All beings' protection place! Appearance self-clear ceaseless from! Five lights' appearing mode appears! Knowing appearance aspect not ceasing! From wisdom pure gate! Appearance ceaseless path-like dawns! Self-appearance body all complete!"

Do you see? Every appearance is compassion's play! Every light is wisdom's face! Stop looking for purity—you're drowning in it! Emaho!
