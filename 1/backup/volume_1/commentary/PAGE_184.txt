Ah, you who would accomplish the path! Lines 7447-7453 speak of former gathering offering, siddhi cause types eight. You think accomplishment comes from external things? No! Like a tree growing from its own seed, siddhi grows from recognizing your own nature.

Look at lines 7454-7463: glory, fame, enjoyment, gathering relatives, world empowerment. These sound like worldly goals to your ears! But transformed through recognition, they become the play of wisdom. Like a magician's illusion—appearing, yet empty of substance.

The gathering types four at lines 7464-7475—humans, non-humans, wealth, food. You chase after these like a dog chasing a stick! But look: the gathering that matters is the gathering of your own scattered attention. Like gathering dispersed clouds back into the single sky.

Lines 7476-7484: non-humans at cemetery, night ḍākinīs thousand gathering. You fear these things! But they are your own mind's display. Like being afraid of your own shadow—foolish! Turn and face the light, and the shadow disappears.

The yogi at lines 7487-7490—great, good give, faults abandon, protect, save, hide. This yogi is you when you recognize. Like a lion who fears no other beast, when you know your own nature, you need protection from nothing.

Food gathering at lines 7493-7506—inner evening, pleasant taste, marvelous food. What is this food? It is the nourishment of meditation, the sustenance of recognition. Like a fire that burns brighter the more you feed it, this recognition grows with practice.

Wealth at lines 7502-7506—whatever desired, thought only gather. You search for wealth outside! But the greatest treasure is already yours. Like a poor person sleeping on a pot of gold, unaware—wake up! Look under you!
