[192-205] Longchenpa now quotes from the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra: "Great hero, skilled in skillful-means, for the complete ripening of sentient-beings, though becoming Buddha ten-million times, still you guide, O Teacher, demonstrating many Buddhas." Listen to this! The Buddha isn't someone who achieved enlightenment once and now rests in glory. From the perspective of absolute truth, the Buddha manifests countless times in countless forms for the benefit of beings. And here's the secret: your own awareness has this same capacity. When you recognize rigpa, you become an expression of this same enlightened activity.

The Flower Ornament Sutra continues this theme: "Having attained the ocean of supreme enlightenment, for the complete ripening of the ocean of sentient-beings, demonstrating the ocean of bodhicitta generation..." Notice the repetition of "ocean"—this is describing the vastness, the boundlessness of enlightened activity. It's not a finite thing that gets used up. It's inexhaustible, like the nature of awareness itself.

[206-217] Now comes a detailed account of how Samantabhadra manifested in this Fortunate Eon. Don't get distracted by the names and numbers! This is describing the continuity of the teaching, how the recognition of awareness has been transmitted through time. The first mind-generation—offering a golden vajra to Buddha Flower-Great-Beauty—symbolizes the commitment to recognize one's own nature.

The various births described (as Jewel-Garland, as Lightning-Light, demonstrating Buddhahood at seventy-five years) are showing the path of gradual awakening. But remember—in Dzogchen, this gradual path is ultimately unnecessary. It's skillful means for those who need it. The direct recognition can happen instantly, without going through all these stages. The stages are described for those who benefit from a gradual approach, not because they're ultimately necessary.

The description of thirty-six self-arisen tantras arising from light-rays, the sixty complete perfections, countless Buddha-bodies—this is describing the richness of the display when awareness recognizes itself. From the tongue-faculty of the five-family Buddhas, immeasurable light radiates as the sound of the six syllables (OM MANI PADME HUM). This isn't mythology—it's a description of how mantra functions. The six syllables are the natural resonance of awareness itself.
