COMMENTARY — Page 23 [807-841]

Waves from the ocean, atoms falling like snow—Longchenpa paints pictures of world-formation that captivate the intellect. But you, who seek liberation, must look deeper.

The text describes sky atoms falling, gathering, expanding like silk on the ocean. You imagine this cosmically, but have you watched your own mind when a thought arises? From where do these mental atoms fall? What sky do they drop from? One moment there is silence, the next—thoughts gathering like snow, covering the pure ground of awareness. But look closely: did they come from anywhere? Do they go anywhere? Like the text says, "by action of doing nature"—this doing is your own grasping, your own fabrication.

Four earth goddesses hold golden vases at four corners. Beautiful imagery, yes, but what are the four corners of your own mind? Are they not the four directions of past, future, self, and other? And who holds them? Who stabilizes your world? Look for this holder—can you find anyone? The goddesses vanish like mist when you search for them directly. The vases are empty. The corners dissolve into space.

The text speaks of naga sons holding from four sides. You think of serpent deities, but consider: what supports your world right now? What holds up the earth of your assumptions? It is held by the nagas of habit, coiled around the depths of your being, unconsciously supporting the structures you take for granted. Until you recognize them, they rule your world. But recognize them—recognize the habitual patterns that hold your reality in place—and they transform. They become guardians rather than binding forces.

Then comes the mandala of elements, stacked like stupa tiers. You read this and build a mental image. But drop the image and look at your own experience. Does your body not have its own tiers? The solid bones, the liquid blood, the heat of metabolism, the breath that moves, the space within the channels? Your body is the mandala. Your experience is the cosmology. What need to search elsewhere?

The commentary mentions fire ripening, water pervading, wind making sense-powers complete, sky opening the aperture of mind. These are not external processes—they are the subtle body mechanics of your own meditation. When fire ripens in the central channel, the red and white essences unite. When water pervades, the bindus flow freely. When wind enters the central channel, sense-powers transform into wisdom. When sky opens, the mind recognizes its own nature.

Do not be deceived by the grandeur of the description. The grandeur is meant to exhaust your ordinary thinking. When the mind cannot grasp the vastness, it gives up—and in that giving up, recognition dawns. So read these vast numbers, these immeasurable distances, and let them expand your mind beyond its limits. Then rest in that expansion, without boundary, without reference point. That resting is the practice.
