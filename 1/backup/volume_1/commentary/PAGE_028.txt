The description of the gods' realm continues—eyes-not-good, hearing's son, land-guarding, with their palaces and pleasure-groves. Sandalwood water, mandarava flowers, beautiful lakes filled to the level of their banks. You read this and think of paradise.

But look at the phrase: "Gods' son and daughter fill with song and cymbals." This is the realm of subtle attachment to bliss. The songs are the whisperings of conceptual mind. The cymbals are the clash of thoughts that seem harmonious but are still noise. The gods' sons and daughters are the proliferations of meditation—experiences, visions, states that arise and seem beautiful but are still fabrications.

Outside the main city, the text describes jewel mansions, flower rains, sweet bird voices, flying jewel boats. These are the subsidiary attainments, the siddhis that tempt the practitioner. You may develop abilities, perceptions, powers—but if you attach to them, you are still in the gods' realm. You have not transcended. The flying jewel boats are your own consciousness, moving through space, but still moving. Still going somewhere. Still not at rest.

The four gardens at the directions—chariot various, rough-change, enjoyment-mix, everywhere-joy. We encountered these before, but now we see their function. Chariot Various-park is the meditation on diversity, where the practitioner sees the variety of phenomena. Rough-change park is the meditation on transformation, where the practitioner sees how phenomena change. Enjoyment-mix park is the meditation on the blending of bliss and emptiness. Everywhere-joy park is the meditation on equanimity, free from sorrow.

These are valuable meditations. But the gods practice them with attachment to the experience. They want the joy. They want the bliss. They want the freedom from sorrow. And because they want, they are bound. The freedom from sorrow that depends on conditions is not true freedom. When the conditions change, the sorrow returns.

The tree at the northeast, Complete Gather Burst, with its roots five leagues down and branches spreading like an umbrella—this is the tree of your life, practitioner. Your roots go deep into past karma. Your branches spread wide into future possibilities. The jewel net hanging from it is the net of interdependence, the way all things are connected. The gods' cloth that hangs there is the fabric of your experience, woven from your own mind.

The white rock slab, fifty leagues wide, like jewel harmonig—this is the seat of meditation, the ground of practice. Indra's throne is the recognition of your own nature. The falling flower rain is the natural blessings that come when you rest in that recognition.

But even Indra falls. Even the king of gods is subject to impermanence. His throne is conditional. His city is made of merit that exhausts. Do not aspire to be Indra. Aspire to recognize the nature that is king of all, yet is no king. Aspire to find the throne that needs no support, the city that is not built, the enjoyment that does not depend on conditions.

The assembly-place Dharma Good, three hundred wide, nine hundred in circumference, with Indra's throne in the middle and gods' seats arranged—this is the mandala of practice. But the true mandala has no circumference. The true throne is everywhere. The true assembly is all beings, not just gods.
