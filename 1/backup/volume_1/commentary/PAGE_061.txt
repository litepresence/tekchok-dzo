Longchenpa speaks of the severance of cause and result [2013-2032], and you must beware of this nihilistic trap! Some say cause is severed—mind cannot be held as entity. Some say effect is severed—life-force and lordship nonexistent. Some say path is severed—withered, nothing exists. Some say primordial wisdom is severed—Buddha nonexistent [2350-2356].

This is the extreme of nihilism dressed as wisdom! They take the teaching of emptiness and turn it into nothingness. They say "all is severed, all is cut, all is empty of meaning." But this is not the Middle Way—it is a deviation into darkness.

When Longchenpa speaks of those who "declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut" [2335], he is warning you about your own mind! Have you not had moments of despair when you thought "nothing matters, nothing exists, why practice?" This is the severance view arising in you. It feels like liberation—no more responsibility, no more effort, no more path. But it is actually just another form of grasping, another extreme to be transcended.

The knowers who speak secretly [2359]—"Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent"—these are not realized beings! They are those who have misunderstood the teaching. They grasp at the words "emptiness" and "severance" without realizing their true meaning.

True emptiness is not severance. It is not the cutting of connections, the denial of appearances, the rejection of causality. True emptiness is the recognition that appearances and emptiness are inseparable, that cause and effect function without inherent existence, that the path is walked without a walker.

Those who deviate from consistency are called tirthikas [2364]—but Buddhists who deviate are merely flesh deviating through wrong tenet. The form remains Buddhist, but the essence has become heresy. Beware of this! You can wear the robes, practice the rituals, quote the scriptures, and still hold a view that contradicts the Dharma's heart.

The Middle Way avoids both extremes: not grasping at existence, not grasping at non-existence. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Emptiness appears as cause and effect. This is the recognition that liberates—not the severance that destroys.
