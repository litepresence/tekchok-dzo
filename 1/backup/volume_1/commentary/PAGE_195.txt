Ah, you who would recognize! Lines 8065-8070 describe mark-free wisdom empowerment—outer appearance mind play, inner meditation mind place, secret rigpa wisdom self-face. This is direct pointing! Like someone pointing at the sun—you look and see for yourself.

Rigpa introduction twenty-one at lines 8068-8070—faculty with example meaning sign three empower. You want to be introduced! But you can't be introduced to what you already are. Like introducing yourself to yourself—ridiculous! Just recognize.

Lines 8071-8095 from Realize wisdom empowerment—form three know: sentient-being appearance outer, meditation mind-hold inner, introduction twenty-one secret. You make three out of one! But it's all your own awareness. Like describing water as liquid, wet, and drinkable—one thing, three descriptions.

Rigpa wisdom introduction at lines 8081-8082—do, secret wisdom empowerment. This is the heart! Not something to get, but something to recognize. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life—take them off and see clearly.

Lines 8089-8098: object-free maṇḍala great, empowerment self exist, meaning untie say. The maṇḍala is object-free—no thing there! Yet empowerment exists. Like space—no object, but holds everything.

One untie two untie all untie at lines 8093-8095—liberation self-arisen other not. You think liberation comes from outside! But it arises from itself. Like a knot untying itself when you stop pulling on it.

Realize-if empowerment-supreme at lines 8099-8107—one arise two arise all arise, empty wisdom great-empowerment. If you realize, all is empowerment. Like a dreamer realizing it's a dream—all the dream becomes the play of awareness.
