Ah, you who would purify! Lines 8840-8853 describe each nature four—first elaborate power arrangement, elaborate body aggregate purify body vajra join. You join! But joining means uniting. Like two streams becoming one river—no longer separate.

That also elaborate at lines 8843-8852—body deity purify, speech mantra purify, mind samadhi purify, consciousness dharmatā purify, unelaborate appearance outside illusion empty, very unelaborate four activities join, utterly unelaborate body bliss speech clarity mind not-think consciousness union. You purify completely! But purification reveals. Like washing a dirty window—lets light in.

Second unelaborate at lines 8853-8857—four empowerments change measure, unelaborate elaborate capable mind change, unelaborate inside enter method show, very unelaborate mind change thought purify join, utterly unelaborate non-dual meaning obtain. You change and enter! But change is transformation. Like ice becoming water—same essence, different form.

Third very unelaborate at lines 8858-8867—four empowerments action limit liberate, elaborate action verse syllable thought purify, border separate conduct arise, unelaborate meaning self arrive dharmatā, very unelaborate emptiness mandala enter, utterly unelaborate six collections purify. You liberate! But liberation is freedom. Like a bird freed from cage—natural state restored.
