[16256-16258] Look here, practitioner! The empty bindu experiences increasing visions—seeing bliss self-held in awareness, mind turns back from that appearance! Completely pure expanse—seeing awareness reach full measure, mind turns back from impure confused appearance! Self-arisen prajna—seeing exhaustion appearance, mind turns back from grasping body and wisdom!

[16259-16263] Now the four lamps explained individually: Far-reaching water lamp, empty bindu lamp, completely pure expanse lamp, self-arisen prajna lamp. These four are not separate practices—they're four aspects of what you already see!

[16264-16280] First, nine aspects: essence, definitive term, division, characteristic, its location, how produced, appearing door-appearance, simile, measure determination. First, water lamp's essence: holding the aspect of both samsara-nirvana, the clear support of seeing pure appearance and confused appearance, and the light-channel depending on it. From the *Rin po che'i sgron ma 'bar ba* tantra: "Far-reaching water lamp's essence gathers both appearances; because seeing-holder grasping aspect not ceased, through holding both aspects..."

Do you see? These lamps are your eyes, practitioner! Not something to achieve. Turn back from grasping at what you see, and the lamp is already blazing! Emaho!
