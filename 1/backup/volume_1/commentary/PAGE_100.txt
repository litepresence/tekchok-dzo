[3693]

You who would cut through all doubt—look here! Lines 3950-3955: Through self-nature without cause and fruition, without self-wish, there is no place to go. Through characteristic not needing familiarization, not depending on other knowables. Through the essence of the hidden and manifest being unobtainable, hope does not reach anywhere. Through self-nature without direction, doubt is nowhere. Through characteristic examined and not found, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten—so it is called.

Without cause and fruition—no karma to accumulate, no result to achieve. Without self-wish—no one who wants, no one who attains. No place to go—you are already there! Not needing familiarization—you don't need to practice to become what you already are. Not depending on other knowables—your awareness knows itself directly.

The essence of hidden and manifest is unobtainable—you cannot find it, whether you look for hidden secrets or manifest appearances. Hope does not reach anywhere—your wanting, your seeking, takes you nowhere because you are already home. Self-nature without direction—no path to walk, no destination to reach. Doubt is nowhere—when you look for doubt, where is it?

The root of samsara and nirvana is rotten! This is shocking, but true. The very root, the basis of both bondage and liberation, is rotten—meaning it has no true existence. Like a tree that appears solid but whose core is hollow. All your samsara, all your seeking for nirvana—built on a rotten root!

When divided, there are two, lines 3956-3958: Concealing one, revealing and emerging two; Concealing two, revealing and emerging one.

This is the play of teaching! Sometimes one aspect is concealed while two are revealed. Sometimes two are concealed while one is revealed. The teacher skillfully shows and hides to guide you to recognition.

The first, lines 3960-3967: If view and conduct are revealed and emerge, and meditation is concealed, that nature in union without beginning or end—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning and end are cut. That nature's two are not different—in the bindu without outside or inside, without dependence on characteristic—causeless openness. If conduct is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge, abiding in emptiness, purified through emptiness—so it is called. If view is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge, through grasp-free knowledge arising directionlessly, awareness without object, liberation beyond concepts—so it is called.

Three possibilities: view and conduct revealed, meditation concealed—nature in union, without beginning or end. Conduct concealed, view and meditation revealed—abiding in emptiness. View concealed, conduct and meditation revealed—grasp-free knowledge, awareness without object.

The second, lines 3968-3971: Concealing two, revealing one. If meditation is revealed and emerges, awareness free from aim arises—causeless fruition abides in itself—so it is called. If conduct is revealed and emerges, body cast to the precipice, mind sent to dharmatā—so it is called. If view is revealed and emerges, mind delivered to emptiness, body and speech brought to the essential point—so it is called.

These are skillful methods! Different approaches for different temperaments. But all point to the same: your nature, free from aim, causeless, self-abiding. Cast your body to the precipice—let go completely! Send mind to dharmata—recognize its nature!

Do not get attached to any one method. They are fingers pointing at the moon. Once you see the moon, you no longer need the finger. But until you see it, you need the finger—so use it skillfully!
