PAGE 74 COMMENTARY

Now Longchenpa turns to the self-enlightened vehicle [2700-2781], the pratyekabuddhas who realize without depending on a teacher in their final life. This is a remarkable path! Not for everyone, but for those of independent disposition, sharp faculties, and deep karma from previous practice.

The five aspects: essence, definition, purpose, fruit, and divisions [2710]. Their essence is partial self-benefit, realizing both half and complete selflessness without a teacher. Their purpose is medium enlightenment. Their fruit is the two foe-destroyers (with and without remainder). Their divisions: rhinoceros-like and crow-like.

The rhinoceros dwells alone [2710], meditating on dependent arising in forward order, realizing person-selflessness and outer dharma-selflessness. They see that atoms and particles have no inherent existence [2731]—this is huge! They go beyond the hearers who still grasp at dharmas.

Yet even they do not fully realize inner dharma-selflessness [2731]. They grasp at the consciousness that knows, the antidote itself, the meditation. As the Abhisamayalankara says: "To abandon grasping of objects, yet not abandon grasping itself—the rhinoceros-like path of support is to be known through correct summary" [2733]. This is their limitation: they free themselves but do not fully transcend the subtlest grasping.

The crow-like self-enlightened ones [2742] meditate on dependent arising in reverse order, going to charnel grounds and contemplating how corpses arise from death, birth, existence, grasping, craving, feeling, contact, sense bases, name and form, consciousness, formative forces, and finally ignorance. This is profound meditation! Seeing the chain of causation that binds beings to samsara.

They teach through bodily signs, not words [2742]. Like a solitary sage who simply sits in silence, their presence itself teaches. This is powerful, but limited—how many beings can learn from silence alone? The bodhisattva uses words, concepts, methods, skillful means to reach countless beings.

Both types attain liberation in one hundred kalpas [2739]—a vast time, but inevitable once the path is entered. They manifest enlightenment of knowing weariness and non-arising [2742]—the exhaustion of karma, the non-production of new afflictions. Noble attainment! But incomplete, for they do not return for others.
