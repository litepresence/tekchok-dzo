The cycles continue. Vulture Peak, Kashmir, monks and teachers, each appearing for their span—three months, ten years, five hundred fifty years. Each one lights up the world briefly, then darkness returns.

Monks named Śobhya, Śākya Jīka—blazing like lamps in the darkness. Each brings a period of flourishing, then decline. Seven such cycles for Jambudvipa, the continent of our world.

After all seven cycles complete, after ten years pass between cycles, the teaching's seed-three field no longer abides here. The fertile ground is exhausted. The teaching cannot take root in this world any longer.

Then attention shifts. Southward to beautiful arranged fields. The same seven-fold pattern—flourish, decline, flourish, decline. The Saha world, this realm of endurance, becomes empty. The beings are gone, the conditions spent.

And beyond this world? Other worlds. Northward, to vast protector worlds. Buddha Utpala, holding beautiful flowers, bringing seven more cycles of flourish and decline. Tuṣita heaven, the contented realm, where future buddhas dwell before descending. Saṃsāra-destroyer, lasting for a hundred thousand times seven eons.

All of this arranged by Vajradhara, the vajra holder. In the Brahma-great eon, all beings return to their primordial ground, liberated. The vessel becomes empty—environment, beings, all dissolved back into space.

Eighty-five eons in the sky of oneness. That's how long the arrangement lasts before it begins again.

The seed-three of teaching: what does this mean?

First seed: Vajradhara's great deed completed. Reality itself, peaceful sphere, self-exhausted, not appearing as anything. The teaching doesn't come from somewhere—it arises from this completion.

Second seed: Beings appearing from that sphere, emanating into forms. The Brahma-great arrangement.

Third seed: The arrangement itself, displaying the teaching through flourish and decline, through birth and death, through darkness and light.

Here's what's really being said: all of this—the worlds, the beings, the cycles, the teachers—is the teaching. Nothing is outside the teaching. The darkness is teaching. The light is teaching. The arising is teaching. The dissolving is teaching.

You're not outside looking in. You're part of the pattern. Your own mind is one of these worlds, going through its own cycles of flourish and decline.

Which cycle are you in right now? That's the only question worth asking.
