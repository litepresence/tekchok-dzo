Each channel has eight petals, thirty-two channels abiding in the body. From the river of existence grasped by twelve limbs, the body's basis arose.

From thirty-two channels, thirty-two wisdoms' work arises. From essence, the four lamps' ultimate bindu ripening. Here's the crucial point: when bliss becomes the path, through forceful method, buddhahood is certain. When impurity arises, the conventional bindu forms. From four elements' ripening, suffering enters the self-continuum, samsara's seed increasing.

But—depending on the channel's vital point, when made the path—the excellent bliss of dharmata is directly realized. These channels become the path of primordial wisdom. Gone to the nature of bindu, doing the work of bliss and suffering's experience.

Then from thirty-five days, individual elements' work's power completing. Form gathers and expands into countless aggregates. The five aggregates' race manifestly projects.

Until forty-two days, eighty-two thousand water-insects' body increased. Upon that wheel, sixty-two channel-petals shown—the cause of sixty-two eons' birth and death arising.

Within each channel, special channel-abade letters, one light-mass supporting each. Samantabhadra father-mother, two by two, thus abiding. Sixty-two channel-tips.

The same channels, the same channels' letters, the same lights—they can become wisdom or they can become ignorance. Can become the path of liberation or the path of entanglement. Can manifest as thirty-two wisdoms or as eighty-two thousand defilements.

The construction is the same. The materials are identical. The difference is only how you use it.

When the channels' vital point is recognized, the impurities become wisdom. When the impurities are not recognized, wisdom becomes impurities.

You choose. Every moment, you choose. The channels are already complete. The wisdom is already present. The question is only whether you recognize it.

If you recognize: liberation, certain, now. If you don't recognize: continuation, suffering, more construction.

There's no middle ground. No gradual path. Either you see it or you don't. Either you recognize the channels as wisdom or you take them as self.

The body is built. The channels are arranged. The wisdom is present.

Will you recognize it?
