Dear practitioner, attend to these final instructions! Lines [12583-12602] point to the ultimate recognition!

Rigpa eye-in enter-from space-awareness-of appearance-to look! Five-doors overpower-from various experiences self-arise gather! Noble-lady advice make-from temple-to flee! Five-men cover under protect!

Rigpa-of primordial-wisdom introduction twenty-one-by demonstrate! Self-appearance meditate time! Thought dispersion gather! Self-cease meaning inner arise! Outer bindu light-five rim possessing! Unmoving focus-from arise! Thought-by gap not-find!

Mirror four-by sign look-from! Self-face know! Lamp four's primordial-wisdom-to look! Self-awareness self-place abide! Meaning inner arise! House door-eight see-from laugh lose! Spontaneous appearance see-from original space-to strong-ground seize!

Third is! Again that-from! Again realm great-circle named! Mud great some within-in! Lamp one not-extinguish dwell! Realm light possessing named! Teacher mirror-possessing named-by see!

That-to this word thus speak: Hey sentient-being light possessing you listen! I you-to prophecy give! Not-distracted listen!

Like entering a palace of mirrors and finally seeing your own face! Like finding the lamp that was always lit but never noticed!

The five doors overpowered—the five senses gathered into one taste! The noble lady's advice—rigpa's own instruction! The five men covering—protection of the five wisdoms!

Twenty-one demonstrations—the complete introduction! Thought dispersion gathered—self-liberated! Outer bindu lights—five wisdoms unmoving! Mirror four—self-face recognized! Lamp four—self-awareness abiding!

The eight doors of the house—eight consciousnesses seen through! Laughter lost at the absurdity of seeking! Spontaneous appearance—original space seized!

The great circle realm—mud within! The unextinguished lamp—light possessing realm! The teacher with mirror—showing you yourself!

Listen! Do not be distracted! The prophecy is given!

Emaho! The recognition of what was always so!
