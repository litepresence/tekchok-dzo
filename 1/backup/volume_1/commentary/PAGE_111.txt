You who would understand realization—listen! Lines 4393-4405: Realizing: entered the Buddha's tantra. Not-realizing: entered the sentient beings' tantra. Since that tantra itself is made the basis, the basis-tantra is established. The method-tantra too is this portion. That meaning itself is the basis for indication, so what is indicated becomes the method-tantra. Without basis-awareness as support, there are no Buddhas or sentient beings whatsoever. Those two who hold their tantras—regarding the tantra—that itself understood through entering: meaning realized—that is its purpose. Realized and liberated—that is its innermost result and fruit.

Two tantras: Buddha's tantra and sentient beings' tantra. But they are not different in nature! The basis is the same—awareness. Those who realize it are Buddhas. Those who don't are sentient beings. But the tantra itself, the nature itself, is the same for both.

Without basis-awareness, no Buddhas, no sentient beings. This awareness is the support, the ground, the basis of everything. Realize it—you are a Buddha. Don't realize it—you wander as a sentient being. But the basis never changes!

Such meaning, lines 4401-4405: If the guru's instruction does not indicate it, it is not realized. If indicated, realizing the indicating method: that is called the method-indicating tantra. That method transmitted one-to-one: thus called method-indicating. Through indication, rigpa must be seen—liberation itself must be gained.

The guru's instruction is essential! Without it, you might never recognize what is already present. The teacher points—the student looks. If the student sees, that is the method-indicating tantra. Rigpa must be seen—not intellectually understood, but directly recognized.

"Meaning unestablished anywhere, so no tantra"—if one thinks this, it is not so, lines 4405-4408. Since there is no awareness-continuum like that, meaning's tantra is properly imputed. The essence-nature tantra is awareness. Awareness's dharmatā seen directly: the continuum of one who has passed holds the tantra. Without the guru's instruction, not seen—transmitted through samsara, so it is tantra.

Some might think: if meaning is unestablished, there is no tantra. But this is wrong! The tantra is properly imputed because there is awareness. This awareness, its dharmata seen directly, is the tantra. Without the guru, it is not seen—so it continues to be transmitted through samsara, life after life.

The flower-nature tantra, lines 4410-4412: Four lamps: whoever sees and realizes dharmatā directly, that is rigpa—so it is the flower-tantra. Not seeing that, transmitted as the class of actions and kleśas—so also tantra.

The four lamps—inner light, lamp of the far-reaching water ray, lamp of the empty bindu, lamp of self-originated wisdom. See these directly, realize dharmata—that is rigpa, that is the flower-tantra. Don't see them—you remain in actions and afflictions, but this too is tantra, just not recognized.

The quintessence-nature tantra, lines 4413-4416: That practiced: essence condensed into quintessence—thus called. Seeing wisdom's appearance: since not destroyed in the three realms, it is tantra. That quintessence of indivisible space-awareness is also explained elsewhere among the seventeen great-secret definitive tantras.

Quintessence—the essence condensed, the most refined. Seeing wisdom's appearance—this is not destroyed, not lost, even in the three realms of samsara. It is always present. Space-awareness indivisible—this quintessence is explained in the seventeen tantras.

From the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras, lines 4417-4421: Buddha's all essence gathered, placed into all beings' hearts. That essence: the intestine-continuum. Since clarity not gathered, called "essence."

All Buddhas' essence is placed in all beings' hearts. Not somewhere else, not far away. In your heart, right now! The intestine-continuum—like the intestines, continuous, connected. Clarity not gathered—not collected, not accumulated, not made. Thus called essence—the essential, the basic, the fundamental.
