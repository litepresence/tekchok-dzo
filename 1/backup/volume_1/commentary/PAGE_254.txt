PAGE 254 COMMENTARY

Dear practitioner, wake up! Lines [10427-10446] shatter all your attempts to grasp spontaneous presence!

You try to seize what is already seized! You try to release what is already released! You place what is already placed! You meditate what is already meditated! You view what is already viewed! You traverse what is already traversed!

This is the madness of the dualistic mind! Like a dog chasing its own tail—round and round, never catching what was never lost!

Listen to the pointing-out: Do not dwell in doing! Do not need to do! Done—nothing to seize! Deed exceeded! No calculation of doing and not-doing!

Meditate? Not needed! Meditate? Nothing there! Meditate? Already exceeded! Meditated and exhausted!

Look? Not needed! Look? Nothing there! Look? Object exceeded!

What is there to look at? What is there to seek? Seeking itself is the obstacle! Finding is impossible because nothing was ever lost!

This is the great self-fall of spontaneous presence! Like waves on water—although they appear distinct, they are never separate from the ocean itself!

If you do not understand this, you will wander endlessly, grasping at what cannot be grasped, seeking what has always been present!

Stop! Release all effort! Let the mind rest in its natural state, like a river flowing effortlessly to the sea!

Emaho! The exhaustion of all seeking!
