Longchenpa continues, showing the remaining tantras like a craftsman displaying his tools. But do not mistake the tools for the craft, you! (lines 1-31)

The limb tantras—jewel heap and blazing body-relic (lines 71-73)—like a fence around a fort. What are they fencing in? Not something precious kept outside, but your own wisdom appearing self-manifest (line 3). The fence is not to keep things out—it is to show you the boundary between confusion and recognition.

The yogic liberation tantra—blazing lamp (lines 7-11). Like a king residing in a palace, all desires accomplished. What palace? The palace of your own body! What king? The king of your own awareness! You have been wandering like a beggar outside your own home, not knowing the door is unlocked, the treasures within are already yours.

The heart-like tantras—six spaces (lines 15-19). Like a closed door where thieves find no entry. What thieves? The thieves of deviation, obscuration, obstacles. They cannot enter when you abide in view-realization. But see clearly—the door has never been closed! The thieves have never existed! This is just a way of speaking to those who fear.

The secret self-position tantras (lines 21-23)—sudden sound arising, cutting all doubts like an iron fence. Sudden sound! This is rigpa snapping its fingers. In an instant, all conceptual mind is cut through. Have you experienced this? One moment lost in thought, the next—clarity, naked awareness. That is sudden sound.

And the weapon-like tantras (lines 25-31)—the black wrathful one, striking contradiction. Like a good doorkeeper. But who is the doorkeeper? Your own alertness, your own natural vigilance. Not something you must create, but something that arises spontaneously when recognition is present.

Then Longchenpa summarizes with beautiful metaphors (lines 37-79)—king, minister, subject gathered; reaching three mountains' peaks; three suns rising; fort's foundation well-set; reaching fort's peak; opening windows in four directions; fencing around; placing a king; fastening doors; iron fences; armored doorkeepers.

All these are pointing to one thing: the natural perfection of your own mind. Do not be distracted by the multiplicity! All these tantras, all these categories—they are like different fingers pointing at the same moon. Look at the moon, you, not the fingers!

The third topic follows (lines 83-86)—order determined, gathered at end. Like a shepherd gathering his flock. All these teachings, all these methods—they are gathered back into the single nature of mind. From the Pearl Garland (line 35), Vajra-holder certainly united.

United with what? With what has never been separate.
