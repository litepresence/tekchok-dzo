The system is complete. Now comes the multiplication.

Emptying, contracting, stabbing, coiling—the body elements never stop moving. Wind, bile, phlegm, combined diseases all taking their turns. Bliss and suffering ripening together. The inventory branches: sixteen divisions become thirty-two, then multiply into four hundred four common diseases. This is not bad news. This is just the full display of what's possible when awareness takes form.

At the Peak-Arranged Wheel, three hundred sixty channels inside you right now. Seven hundred twenty syllables: ka ka ki ki and so on. Three hundred sixty light-spheres spinning, combining into one thousand eighty points of luminosity. Samantabhadra father-mother principles multiplying into two thousand eight hundred bodies. Each one carrying body-speech-mind deities, three of each. From the heart-center, wisdom-beings emanate in forms fine as hair, multiplying into three thousand two hundred forty aspects.

Eighteen thousand five hundred insects. Each carrying syllables. Each syllable containing wisdom-seeds. Three hundred three thousand five hundred three individual wisdom seeds. Eighteen thousand five hundred hidden afflictions not found in any scripture. Four hundred eighteen thousand potential problems. Three thousand two hundred forty channel-growings above.

And yet it's called the basis-of-all. Not because it's problematic. Because it's everything. The enumeration has no measure. The inventory cannot be completed. Sense-powers, sense-basis dharmas, all gathering into one vast display.

Here's the structure: four body-wheels, channels like life-trees, taste multiplying through all trembling. Outside, body-speech-mind arise. Inside, body-speech-mind arise. Secret emanation body, enjoyment body, dharma body—three kayas produced, standing straight as pillars.

The father's bindu syllable: A-Om-Ah-Hung sounds forth. The mother's castle dissolves.

This is not happening somewhere else. This is your constitution right now. Three kayas already present. Three poisons already transformed. The question isn't whether you're ready for enlightenment. The question is whether you'll stop long enough to recognize what you've been this whole time.

The recognition is immediate. The recognition is complete.

Nothing more to add. Nothing to remove.

Rest now in what was never disturbed.
