[8312]
PAGE 201 COMMENTARY

Listen, you who would know colors! Lines 8312-8324 speak of not bright gold, nor crimson red, from extremes departed, gathered blue-green. You look for the perfect color! But it's the departure from extremes that matters. Like the middle path—not this shore, not that shore, but the crossing.

Wide eyes, brows unbroken at lines 8315-8317—white teeth, fine array, bliss-giver, Lotus-Born explained. You judge by appearances! But the Lotus-Born appears in many forms. Like water taking the shape of its container—same water, different forms.

Lines 8319-8334 from before: neither white nor black, long disposition, gentle conduct, good mind, vast scope, great shame, body mind conduct wide, however done slow itself, by this great bliss increases. You want the method! But it's in your conduct, your way of being. Like a gentle stream that wears away stone—soft, yet powerful.

These certainties extensively at lines 8336-8340—from Perfect Self-Arisen, secret-capable youths, secret empowerment wishing to bestow, dharani mind-suitable seek. You seek the suitable! But suitability is compatibility with your mind. Like a key fitting a lock—must match.

That characteristic examine at lines 8341-8352—families four explained, result four bodies obtain, color gait voice examine. You examine externally! But the real examination is of your own mind. Like testing gold—fire reveals the purity.

Lotus family at lines 8353-8362—face round, flesh-color dark, voice small, mind-pleasing, age fifteen. You look for these signs! But the lotus family is your own capacity for compassion. Like a lotus growing from mud—purity from impurity.
