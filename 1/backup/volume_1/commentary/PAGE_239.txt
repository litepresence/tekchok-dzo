[9643-9651] At this time, mind and mental factors cease! Then from first liberation's seeing purification, six clairvoyances arise—body's outflows exhausted! Second liberation's six exhaust speech's outflows! Third's six mind's outflows exhausted! Fourth's six consciousness's outflows exhausted! Fifth's six prajna-aggregate's obscuring outflows exhausted! Sixth's six dharmas and dharmatā's outflows exhausted! These thirty arise from outer-inner-secret complete empowerment!

[9652-9660] Then body-speech-mind's karma manifesting six clairvoyances appear—Buddha's knowing completely perfected! Actual body's seeing purification six arisen, seeing all Buddha-bodies and self-attaining! Body-appearance's six arisen, enjoying infinite light gatherings! Actual speech's six arisen, enjoying sixty speech-tones! Speech-appearance's six, enjoying various sound-tones! Actual mind's six, enjoying all samadhis! Mind-appearance's six, enjoying knowing others' minds! Thus these thirty arise from thirty-two deity recognitions of empowerment!

[9661-9662] Then dharmatā's seeing purification six clairvoyances appear—at this time, dharmatā's intent dwells without division. Do you see? One hundred eighty clairvoyances—and they're all your own face! Emaho!
