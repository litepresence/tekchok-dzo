Listen sharply, fortunate one! Lines [12001-12020] reveal the instant liberation—the path of no path!

Base appears—see it and instantly liberate! Liberate and abide in space! From this, benefit others! This is the method!

How? From primordial space, inner tone outward arises! Compassion-awareness, self-non-awareness aspect, merely arises! That base-appear outward looks! Self-appear self-is-know—inward realize, and instantly!

Non-awareness self-pure! Base-appear spontaneous appears! Self-dissolve pure! Ground self-place abides!

Instant in Buddha! Before coming teacher! Resultant-reversal! Samsara-nirvana primordial final! Buddha does not become through delusion!

Base transcended sense! Self-appear nature non-existent! Know this! Thought-investigate mind plural—outward not lose! Move self-rope decide!

Like a bird freed from a cage—no need to learn flying! Like ice melting into water—no need to destroy the ice!

The instant you see, you are liberated! Not gradually, not through stages, not through effort! Simply see the nature of what appears!

Do not look for buddha outside! Do not wait for realization in the future! It is here, now, in this very instant!

Like lightning flashing—if you blink, you miss it! Like an echo in the valley—hear it now or it is gone!

Emaho! The instant that contains all time!
