Longchenpa speaks of the stages of heat, patience, peak, and supreme dharma [2960-2978], and these are crucial markers on the path! These are not abstract concepts—they are experiences you will have as practice deepens.

Heat [2960-2971] is the first sign that something is working. Like warmth before sunrise, you feel the approach of realization. It has three aspects: outer, inner, and both together. The outer heat arises when you see entities as empty—when you look at the world and it no longer appears solid, real, graspable. The inner heat is the sixth—when you understand the pure knowable as empty, when even your understanding is seen through. The heat of both arises when outer and inner are recognized as one display.

Patience [2971-2972] comes next—not the patience of waiting, but the patience of not turning back. You have seen emptiness; now you can bear it. You no longer fear the void. You no longer need to reconstruct solidity. You can remain in the openness without panic.

Then the peak [2973]—the highest point of worldly realization. You are at the summit of conditioned existence. Beyond this lies the supramundane, the direct perception of the noble ones.

Supreme dharma [2974]—this is the final stage before the path of seeing. Your practice is refined, pure, unsurpassed within the world. You are ready for the direct realization that will change everything.

And the ten grounds [2974-2975]—from Great Joy to Cloud of Dharma—describe the maturing of that realization. Each ground dissolves deeper obscurations, manifests clearer wisdom. But remember: these are not places you go; they are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely you have released the illusion of a separate self.

Then Longchenpa begins the explanation of established tenet views [2979], starting with the Mind-Only school [2981-2995]. They assert that all appearances are aspects of consciousness, that there is no external reality separate from mind. This is a crucial insight! But they stop there, grasping at mind as truly existent. The Middle Way goes further, showing that mind too is empty. This is the path you must follow—not stopping halfway, not establishing anything, even emptiness, as the final truth.
