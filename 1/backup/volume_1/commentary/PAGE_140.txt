COMMENTARY ON PAGE 140

KAṂ KĀ is called. The root KA is KA alone; the head-circle is KAṂ. NA RO and so forth: each subsequent [letter] is read with its long portion. That is made the power of the branch tagged to the single [letter] (lines 1-4).

For the prefix with branch tags (line 6): "Please examine the classes of these letters carefully." Stacked letters, note 3 (lines 7-7).

For one KA-like: NA RO two, GU GU two, ZHENG BU two, foot-hook two, YA tag two, RA tag two—one affixing LA. If the head-circle and one long portion exist (lines 8-10):

The root KA and the affixing LA two are given half of the above and below NA RO and so forth. Given to the head-circle LA, this is the giving condition for both long portions to benefit (lines 11-13).

For example: KĪ LĪ KĀO LĀO KĒ LĒ KŪ LŪ KYŪ LŪ YA KRĀ LĀ RA LAṂ (line 15).

Thus, when LA and RA are life-discordant, the normal LA and RA tags are inserted in order and pronounced (line 17).

When many or few branches arise above and below, the remainder is given to the prefix letter and read (line 19).

The head-circle gives power to the prefix (line 21).

When the above NA RO and so forth consist of one without elongation, it is pronounced lengthened (line 23).

The NA RO and so forth—the four ornament letters—are given to the prefix (line 25).

When the below end-support, foot-hook, and so forth, each are not in a group, it is given to the root and the prefix is pronounced alone (line 27).

The example of these two: according to sequence, KMOṂ is called: KA MO KA MI KA ME MAṂ is read (line 29).

KACAR is called: KRA CA KYA CA KU CA is pronounced (line 31).

This also: the root letters are first led by the nose and pronounced before the prefix (line 33).

NA RO, GU GU, ZHENG BU, head-circle—the four ornament letters—are called "the four letters of ornament" (lines 35-37).

YA tag, RA tag, foot-hook—the three end-supports or "four support letters" (lines 37-39).

When GU GU is double-stacked on the single [letters], it is called "straight placement" (lines 40-42).

KĪ—one GU GU with long portion is called. NA RO double-stacked—arising upper and lower—is called "upper and lower." KOU—one foot-hook is called. ZHENG BU double-stacked—arising bent and curved—is called "ZHENG." KEI—one GU GU is called (lines 1-5 of next section).

The third, the expression manner of stacked [letters], is: when sounds are expressed similar to life-concordant, etc. (line 7).

"Please examine these letter classes carefully." Stacked letters, note 4 (line 9).

Called is: O KO ŚO MI TRĪ ṬAṂ (line 11).

Its meaning: the birthless pure dharma-kāya, the nature of wisdom, all phenomena non-dual, the eternal wisdom—empty, cessationless. From sphere, sphere arises; wisdom, non-dual, adorned. Therefore, the nature of the three-stacked sphere-wisdom (lines 13-13).

That also is the wisdom of awareness beyond the equality of dharmatā (line 15).

Two lights: the light of realized persons, and the light of sentient beings through non-realization (lines 17-17).

That also, for those endowed with realization, this very appearance freely arises as wisdom (line 19).

For the unrealized, though five lights exist, they are not seen and therefore not indicated (lines 20-22).

Thus, other abodes of stacked [letters]: OṀ is the nature of the three kāyas. HĪG is the nature of HŪṀ. These noble letters arise in the melody of these three. What is gathered by wisdom's palace is called "sound-arising"—the specific emanation of the three root letters (lines 23-27).

Do you see the intricacy? Each letter combination carries specific meaning, specific energy. O KO ŚO MI TRĪ ṬAṂ—birthless dharmakaya, nature of wisdom, non-dual, eternal wisdom, empty, cessationless. These are not just sounds. They are the very qualities of enlightenment encoded in syllables.

And notice the two lights—the light of the realized and the light of the unrealized. The same five lights exist for both! The difference is not in the lights. The difference is in the recognition. For the realized, appearance freely arises as wisdom. For the unrealized, the lights exist but are not seen, not indicated.

This is crucial! The nature of mind does not change. Awareness does not change. What changes is recognition. The lights are always there. The five wisdoms are always present. But without recognition, they appear as ordinary confusion. With recognition, they appear as wisdom.
