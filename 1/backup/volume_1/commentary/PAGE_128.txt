Now we come to methods of explanation. Listen, you who want to know how to understand these teachings! (lines 1-89)

Method divided: two (line 1). Nature divided: three, five sufficient (line 2). Excellent ones: meaning and word tantra two shown (line 3). Very excellent, elaboration-free, basis tantra awareness alone accomplishes (line 4). Awareness, tantra all complete reason (line 5).

Do you see the progression? From elaborate methods to direct recognition. For some, two methods; for others, three or five divisions. For the excellent, just meaning and word. For the very excellent, awareness alone accomplishes all. Where do you fall in this spectrum? Be honest with yourself!

From Thalgyur (line 11)—Also tantra's dharmatā explained (line 13). True dharmatā sound result (line 15). Self-nature letterless (line 17). Self-awareness wisdom lamp light blazing (line 19). Dharmatā pure, auspicious beautiful (line 21). View fear-free, lion power perfect (line 23). Self-awareness ripened, perfect self-arisen (line 25). Neck-thread connected, pearl string (line 27). Experience appearance wealth arranged (line 29). Self-abide empty, heart mirror (line 31). Error self-cut, mind mirror (line 33). Other not-arisen, self-arise itself (line 35). Self-arisen, thus self-liberated (line 37). Sphere one, thus six spaces (line 39). Qualities perfected, jewel pile (line 41). Self-awareness shown, face-show adorned (line 43). Appearance pure, sun moon joined (line 45). Awareness ripening, body-relic blazing (line 47). These all basis-arisen (line 49). Thus said (line 51).

This is a summary of all tantras in a few lines! Self-nature letterless—the true nature cannot be captured in letters or words. Self-awareness wisdom lamp light blazing—your own awareness is the lamp, blazing with light. Letterless yet illuminating everything.

Or elaboration-possess: basis heart tantra bindu all (line 53). Medium: seventeen (line 55). Excellent: self-arisen seed tantra alone (line 57). Peak: transcendent-future-three liberation explained (line 59).

From Ati Great Arrangement (line 61)—That meaning word various elaboration, elaboration-possess: basis-heart (lines 63-65). Elaboration-free: enumerate seventeen (line 67). Very elaboration-free (line 69). Very elaboration-free indeed, free from elaboration and its absence, transcendent-future-three liberated (lines 71-75). Thus it is spoken (line 77).

General meaning second, explanation method branch definite: three (line 79)—How explained manner, occasion basis definite enumeration, holy certain prophecy (lines 81-85). First: three, explanation method's summary establishing (lines 87-89).

The explanation method is threefold: how it is explained, the definite enumeration of occasion and basis, and holy certain prophecy. Do not rush through these! Understanding how the teachings are structured helps you enter them properly.

Remember—awareness alone accomplishes. All these divisions and enumerations are for those who need them. If you can recognize awareness directly, what need for elaboration?
