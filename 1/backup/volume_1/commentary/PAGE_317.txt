[13133-13136] Look at this madness, practitioner! The five races' power draws the father's consciousness inward, like iron to lodestone. Then, free from attachment, it goes to the mother's lotus—but because any race's drawing agent exists in the mother, there's no satisfaction with bliss. This is desire and attachment born from cause and condition!

[13137-13142] Desire and attachment—these two held as cause and condition. Samsara's body held by the ground wind. Knowing cause and condition as nondual, the result of bliss and great bliss interweaves as body and wisdom's result. Thus, on the first day's night from the mother's womb, father's cause and mother's condition become one external cause, while internally unmixed they dwell like a chick in an egg, holding the child's wind-mind. The four elements' binding cause—like a jewel shell—binds without opportunity for separation. This comes from when body completes without food from the mouth, life cannot remain.

[13143-13153] At that time, the wind holding the body—the inner wind's leaping power soars upward, like mercury drops rising, dwelling quivering. When body completes, whatever adventitious condition occurs to body-mind, there's fear and body trembling—from this. Then on the second day, earth mixes as one, pressing with weight—the child has suffering from the crown pressed down like a thousand. At this time, the body's cause is held as merely flesh, while condition channels are merely water moistening. From nondual ignorance cause-condition, non-conceptual wisdom liberates—the great perfection's key beyond acceptance and rejection! Above, the body's cause moistens, merely blood coagulating, while condition water merely flows down channels.

Emaho! See how samsara forms from confusion!
