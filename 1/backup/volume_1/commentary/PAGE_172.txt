Also bad vessel good content not hold, lion's milk clay vessel not like. If poured dharma's greatness lost, bad vessel from hell go, bad vessel such secret needed (lines 42-46). From that (line 47): oral instruction great perfection meaning, bad vessel generally pour not, faith possessing some content, bad vessel pour, content both ruin, therefore mind inferior secret (lines 48-53). Thus it is spoken (line 54).

Third common dharma three (line 55):

The qualities of the student! Faith, diligence, wisdom, humility. Mind not distracted, samaya possessed, accomplishment diligent. Urgency, longing, devotion! Direct spontaneous conduct, following master's words exactly.

Do not spread samaya to those who cannot hold it. Conduct suitable to others. Respect in manner, mind, and word. Follow one teaching—do not mix many. Aspire to the secret with patience. Do not transgress vajra meaning. Rely on the learned. Do not harm self or others. Speak gently, not with pride. Enter others' minds suitably.

See master and Tathagata as no different! This is the characteristic of the student who is a vessel for great perfection. Without these qualities, you are not a vessel—you are a broken pot.

Avoid the bad student! One without honor or humility, missing secret mantra conduct, concerned with family lineage rather than nature, small wisdom, disregarding kindness, speaking of own family, wearing adornments, spreading meaninglessly, not examined by master, not practicing—do not explain great perfection to such!

Lion's milk in a clay vessel breaks the vessel! Dharma's greatness lost, the bad vessel goes to hell. Both content and vessel ruined. Therefore—keep the secret from inferior minds. Protect the teaching. Only pour into vessels that can hold.
