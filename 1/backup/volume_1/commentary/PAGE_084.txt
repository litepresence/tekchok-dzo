You who wish to cross to the other shore—listen! These treatises are without distinction of teaching and difference, line 3131. Do not get caught in comparing, in thinking one vehicle is higher than another. The truth is one; the paths are many.

But now Longchenpa speaks of the vehicle of tantra, lines 3132-3144, and you should listen well. Through the vehicle of characteristics, you must strive greatly with difficulty, accomplishing through great perseverance. But through depending on causes, mantras ripen results with little effort, attaining Buddha, surpassing!

You have been grinding away at the path of characteristics for countless eons, practicing the five paths, the ten grounds, gathering merit and wisdom. And this is good! But there is a faster way. Mantra: Excellent life alone. The intermediate bardo. Through least birth, through Buddha, quickly surpassing (lines 3138-3140).

What is this secret? It is not some external power or magic. It is the direct recognition of your own nature. While the causal vehicle approaches emptiness gradually, step by step, mantra shows it directly in one moment, surpassing through freedom from obstacles and hindrances (lines 3143-3146).

The causal vehicle speaks of expedient meaning and definitive meaning, of hidden intention and arranged teaching. But mantra shows directly—no hidden meaning, no gradual unveiling. It is like the difference between reading a map and arriving at the destination. The map is useful, but why not just go?

Briefly, lines 3147-3158: Accomplishing the meaning desired by the mantra vehicle through the causal vehicle takes many means, much difficulty, much delusion. But mantra surpasses through sharp faculties accomplishing quickly. Even if one meaning is the same, non-delusion, many means, no difficulty, through control of sharp faculties—the excellent mantra vehicle surpasses.

Do you have sharp faculties? Can you recognize your own nature when it is pointed out to you? Then do not waste time with gradual paths! If you see the sun, why light a candle?

The essence is the self-arisen wisdom, the expanse of clear light, the truth directly realized, the supreme secret means (line 3160). This is not somewhere else. This is your own mind, right now, if you would only recognize it!
