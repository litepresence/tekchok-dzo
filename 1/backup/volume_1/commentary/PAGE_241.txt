COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 241

Ah, you who wish to enter the mandala! Listen well. Longchenpa speaks of samaya here, at lines [9704-9710], but do not think this is some external vow to be kept like a merchant's contract. Samaya is the bind that binds nothing—your own mind not breaking itself. You look for something to hold, something to protect, and all the while the vajra cross has always been right here, difficult to grasp because there's nothing to grasp.

At lines [9711-9718], he tells you samaya is breaking free from deception. But what deception? You deceive yourself every moment, taking this moving mind as solid, taking these shifting thoughts as "you." Samaya is simply stopping that deception—recognizing your own mind has never been broken, never needed mending. Like a conch shell that is white inside and out, your nature has never been stained. The stain is the thought that you are stained.

He speaks of root and branch samayas at lines [9719-9727]—twenty-five branches, three roots of body, speech, and mind. You think "I must keep these!" and you make lists, you check them twice like a nervous householder. Foolish! The root samaya is simply this: not abandoning the view, not abandoning your own nature. Everything else grows from that like branches from a living tree. If you cut the root, what use are the branches?

At lines [9745-9756], he speaks of the teacher and the student. You think the teacher is outside you, some glorious being to be worshipped from afar. And you think you are the poor student, lacking, needing. But look—teacher and student are mind's own display, siblings of one vajra family. The teacher appears because of your karma, your connection, your own mind's ripeness. The teacher is your own wisdom appearing in form to meet you. Do you see?

The vajra siblings at lines [9757-9763]—general, close, mixed, extremely mixed—you look for these categories like a scholar counting sand grains. Closer than close! When you enter the mandala together, when you share one vase, one lamp, one empowerment—this is not about the ritual objects. It is your own mind recognizing itself in another. The mandala is not painted on cloth. It is the expanse of your own awareness.

At lines [9764-9765], he warns seven objects become strict. You hear "strict" and you tighten up, you become rigid with rules. But "strict" here means natural, unyielding, like the sky that holds all clouds but is never moved by them. Honor all as teacher—this means do not divide. Do not say "this one is worthy, that one is not." Every appearance is the teacher's face showing you your own mind.

So you ask, "How do I keep samaya?" You keep it by not keeping it. You protect it by not protecting it. Let your mind rest as it is, and samaya keeps itself. This is the great secret Longchenpa points to. Do you understand? Samaya is not a chain to bind you. It is the recognition that you were never bound.
