Listen, you who would accomplish! Lines [11290-11309] reveal the effortless action of self-liberation!

Action accomplished! How? Not through effort! Not through striving! These self-cease! Dharmas all self-place! Self-liberate! Complete from the base of appearance!

Like dust settling on a mirror—the dust does not change the mirror! Like waves on the ocean—the waves do not change the water!

Subtle dust free! Impurity free! Attain what was never lost! Beyond conceptualization! Beyond objects! Dharmata cannot be opened by any means—it is already open!

Nature complete! Causes appear! Ends exhaust! Simultaneously realized! Desire-free accomplishment! No repetition! No reversion!

This is the meaning of primordial dwelling—not achieved, not cultivated, not fabricated! Knowledge itself manifests! Dharmas all exhaust! Reach the place that is no place!

Dharma-space vast! No limit perceived! No center found! Liberation's base is pure dharmata! Engage without engaging! Act beyond worldly action!

Nature clear and resounding! Like a bell struck in empty space—the sound arises without source, without obstruction!

Do not try to accomplish what is already accomplished! Do not strive for what has always been present! Simply recognize the self-liberated nature of all that arises!

Like a snake uncoiling itself—no one else needs to straighten it!

Emaho! The spontaneous completion of all action!
