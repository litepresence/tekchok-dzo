Now we're touching the uncommon transmission—the secret, direct introduction that doesn't rely on words. This is where ordinary teaching stops and real transmission begins.

The common transmission works through texts, through explanations, through "thus I taught." It's necessary for beginners, but it's a finger pointing at the moon.

The uncommon transmission: awareness-wisdom itself, dwelling in the five perfections naturally. No teaching happening—just the teaching being itself. This is what the clear light tantras begin with. "Thus I taught once"—but that teaching wasn't words. It was showing the ultimate truth of how things are.

This teaching surpasses all vehicles, all sutras, all ordinary approaches. Here's why:

**Abode perfection**: Reality itself, free from elaborations. No characteristics anywhere. Not words, not letters, not conceptual objects. Where does it abide? Everywhere and nowhere. Not established in any direction, any place, any thing.

**Teacher perfection**: The teacher isn't a person. It's how reality abides—self-arisen awareness, not based on words or concepts. No elaborations, no reference points. Just awareness being aware. The teacher is recognition itself.

**Retinue perfection**: The play of dharmata, the ocean of wisdom gathering. Those who receive aren't gathered as separate beings—they're the display of wisdom itself.

**Teaching perfection**: Great perfection, tathata, the ultimate nature of dharmadhātu. Not something taught but the very nature of what's taught.

**Time perfection**: Not ordinary time. Great luminous time, beyond one and many, beyond conception. All of it—beginning, middle, end—without any division. One moment that contains all moments.

From the Ratnaketu tantra: from the empty dharmadhātu that doesn't exist, from that very emptiness, the primordial Buddha turns the dharma wheel. Awareness and wisdom distinct yet inseparable. Reality empty, self-sound. The dharma wheel turning without beginning or end.

This is the uncommon transmission. Not something you learn—something you recognize. You've always been in it. You just didn't know.

Stop trying to understand it. Start recognizing that you're already inside it.
