The abodes are divided individually (line 17). From Rigpa Rangdrol: the long and short sounds are shown as follows (lines 19-21):

AA+A stacked—long; KA+KA tagged—long; BA+BA tagged—great; JA+JA tagged—thick; NYA+NYA tagged—long; SA+SA tagged—short; YA+YA tagged—great; MA+MA tagged—thick; GA+GA tagged—long; TSA+TSA tagged—short; HA+HA tagged—great; THA+CA tagged—thick; KHA+KHA tagged—long; NGA+NGA tagged—short; PA+BA tagged—great; THA+THA tagged—thick (lines 23-53).

These and other letters, the joined meanings of syllables should be known (line 55).

These are arranged as follows: KA+CA tagged—thick; THA+NA tagged—thick; JA+BA tagged—thick; MA+SHA tagged—thick; BA+A tagged—thick; NA+TA tagged—thick. These are the thick [letters] (lines 57-70).

The long letters are: YA+NGA tagged—long; GA+HA tagged—long; THA+DA tagged—long; A+KHA tagged—long; TA+NA tagged—long; SHA+ZHA tagged—long. These are the long [letters] (lines 73-87).

These are the great [letters]: SVA+LA tagged—great; YA+DU tagged—great; KA+SKRE tagged—great; HRA+HA tagged—great; NYA+RA tagged—great; NGA+TE tagged—great; YA+LA tagged—great; SMA+KHRU tagged—great. These are the great letters (lines 89-106).

The short letters are: NGA+YA tagged—short; GA+NGA tagged—short; DA+NGA tagged—short; KA+ZHA tagged—short; JA+SA tagged—short; YA+NI tagged—short; KHA+U tagged—short (lines 109-122).

Listen, you who are intimidated by Sanskrit phonetics! These details are not obstacles. They are the subtle vibrations of reality itself. Each combination—thick, long, great, short—carries a particular energy, a particular meaning. The thick letters are heavy, grounded. The long letters extend, pervade. The great letters are expansive. The short letters are concise, direct.

But do not get lost in classification! The point is not to become a scholar of Sanskrit. The point is to recognize that sound itself is sacred, that the very structure of language reflects the structure of mind. When you pronounce these sounds, you are not just making noise. You are engaging the energetic patterns of awareness.

The classifications serve a purpose—they help you understand what you are working with. But in the end, it is the recognition that matters. Recognize that all sounds arise from emptiness, display as sound, and dissolve back into emptiness. That is the real pronunciation.
