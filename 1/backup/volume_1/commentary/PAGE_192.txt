Ah, you who seek secret knowledge! Lines 7936-7940 speak of benefit power establish, secret empowerment, knowledge-woman earnest empowerment. You get excited by the secret! But the real secret is that there's nothing hidden. Like a "secret" door that was always open—you just weren't looking.

The conventional bodhicitta at line 7940—enjoy that itself empower. You think this is about ordinary pleasure! But it's about recognizing the bliss of awareness itself. Like the satisfaction of a job well done—not from outside, but from within.

Lines 7941-7957 describe elaborate substances and empowerments. You want to collect these practices! But they all point to one thing: knowing your own mind. Like many roads leading to one mountain peak—different paths, same destination.

Special substance seven at line 7950—existence seven stop. You think this is about external substances! But it's about stopping the sevenfold existence of dualistic grasping. Like stopping a spinning wheel—it slows, slows, then stops completely.

Lines 7957-7971: inner auspicious substance eight, outer kingdom seven-jewels, inner wisdom general-pour. You divide inner and outer! But they are not two. Like a mirror and its reflection—the reflection is not separate from the mirror.

The jewels seven at lines 7954-7955. You think these are royal treasures! But they are the seven aspects of enlightenment in your own mind. Like seven colors of the rainbow—all appearing from one light.

Secret essence substance seven at lines 7989-7995—secret mind enter action seven continuum cut. This is the real secret: cutting the continuum of ordinary mind. Like cutting a rope—suddenly, the束缚 is gone.
