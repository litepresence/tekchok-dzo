Former shown like beautiful arrangement etcetera field teaching's seed leaped beings all ripened benefit done (line 1). Eon good this thousand eon form destruction hundred passed, eon Saṃsāra-emptier called, buddha Wheel Lightning Garland supreme teaching held, beings saṃsāra liberated (lines 2-5).

Vajradhara arranged Brahma-great eon beings all primordial ground liberated teaching's seed-three reality sphere dissolved, saṃsāra emptied, here eon great thousand twenty beings not-appear (lines 6-8). Then again former like habitual tendencies arose beings' vessel environment appearance, method teacher also first Samantabhadra's power arisen (lines 9-10).

Thus Sound Great Talgyur Tantra (line 11): teaching essence secret this, thus teaching seven passed, fields seven definitely experienced, thus seven passed also, Vajra Seat's threshold, teaching all speech seed, self-arisen great letter, sound with descent, here eon hundred, Wheel Lightning Garland, Bhagavān appearance, then years hundred three, thus three passed below, teaching's mind vajra also, teacher that appearance, then years five hundred, teaching's kāya also there descended, thus teaching actual descended, again teaching's ember arises, teacher that retinue, Ārya Brahma-light called, miracle power perfect, greatly faithful aspiring, definitely held manifest (lines 12-35). That etcetera teacher's retinue, Ārya śrāvaka thousand two, vinaya teaching eon one... (lines 36-38).

The teaching moves! From field to field, from eon to eon. When one field is exhausted, the teaching leaps to another. Seven fields, seven experiences. Vajra Seat's threshold—the sacred site where all teachings originate.

The eon Samsara-emptier—when Buddha Wheel Lightning Garland holds the teaching, liberating all beings. Then samsara is emptied! The teaching's seed dissolves into the reality sphere. For twenty great thousand eons, no beings appear.

But then—habitual tendencies arise again. The vessel and environment appear. And Samantabhadra's power manifests once more as the teacher. This is the endless cycle of benefitting beings.

From the Sound Great Talgyur—the teaching descends through speech, through the self-arisen great letter, through sound itself. Mind vajra, then kaya, descending over hundreds of years. The ember rekindles. The lineage continues.

This is your lineage, you! Not just words in a book. Living transmission. The teaching is here now because of this continuous descent through countless masters. Do not waste it!
