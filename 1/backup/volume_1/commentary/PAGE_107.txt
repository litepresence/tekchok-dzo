You who would be shown the path—listen! Lines 4272-4276: Nature: The instruction of indicated meaning, awareness, realizing method. Definite term: Self-dwelling awareness's wisdom indicating, as realizing method, gathering the key of experience, shown in one direction—thus called indicating method tantra.

The indicating method tantra—the teaching that points to what is already present. Self-dwelling awareness—you don't create it, you don't make it. It's already dwelling in you. Wisdom indicating—this awareness is itself wisdom, and it indicates itself.

Gathering the key of experience—through practice, through familiarization, you gather the key that unlocks recognition. Shown in one direction—not many directions, not confused. Direct, straight to the point.

Generally, lines 4277-4279: Explanation tantras: words long, difficult. Instruction tantras: words clear, easy. Great Perfection tantras are called instruction tantras.

Explanation tantras are lengthy, philosophical, difficult. Instruction tantras are direct, clear, easy. The Great Perfection uses instruction tantras—pointing directly, not beating around the bush.

Divided, lines 4280-4293: Showing effortless primordial liberation; Showing with effort through sequence—two. First: Cutting through the basis; The sequence of instant faculties; Primordially liberated, again without basis, etcetera. Second: the path of leaping over, the gradual faculties, relying on the key of channels and winds, making liberation. Three preliminaries, bringing to natural place, directly bringing to the self-key, until. Body key, door key, object key, relying on the key of wind and awareness, taking experience. Going to the measure of four appearances, showing liberation.

Two approaches: effortless primordial liberation (for those with sharp faculties) and with effort through sequence (for those who need gradual methods).

Cutting through (trekcho)—the basis, primordially liberated. The path of leaping over (togyal)—using channels, winds, drops, light. Body key, door key, object key—keys to unlock the body, the sense doors, the objects of perception.

Also from that same, lines 4294-4301: Those directly realizing, called method—also distinction. Person's intellect's difference, how the sequence must be explained. Without effort and striving, self-liberation. With effort, experience must be taken. Effortless ones are self-pure.

Difference in persons' intellect—some can recognize instantly, some need gradual training. Without effort, self-liberation—if you can recognize directly. With effort, experience must be taken—if you need to work with methods, channels, winds.

Key: through three aspects, lines 4302-4310: That meaning: taking experience. Body, door, object. Body's key: these three—Lion's manner, elephant's manner, like a rishi, must be known. Door: that same, unmoved, clarifying two, unmoved, sky itself unmoved.

Three keys: body, door, object. Body's three manners: lion (majesty), elephant (steadiness), rishi (simplicity). Door unmoved—sense doors not wandering, stable, like the sky itself.

Object's key: three aspects, lines 4311-4318: Pure expanse, dwelling. Thus awareness's nature, dwelling. All appearances, dwelling. Mind changeless, self-abiding. Mind changeless, memory clear. Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear.

Three aspects of object key: pure expanse (object is empty), awareness's nature (object is mind), all appearances (object is appearance). Mind changeless—this is the key! Self-abiding, not manipulated. Memory clear—knowing without confusion. Three bodies clear—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya all present.
