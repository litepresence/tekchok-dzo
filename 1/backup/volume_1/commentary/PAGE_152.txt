From Talgyur (line 1): basis types five, abode types three desired. Thus meaning (lines 2-3).

Also from Ratnaketu (line 4): grasping self-pure dharmakāya by, elaborationless self-pure palace, self undifferentiated appearance retinue, signless speech by, elaborationless dharmas, not-abide self-exhausted mind arisen, not-spoke spoke not, equality great state shown (lines 6-13).

Nirmāṇakāya attachment without, dharma also disciple self-abode from, six families awake fortunate, elaborations word speech by, faculties whatever dharmas, memory self-clear mind from, faculties desire tongue spread, vehicle number dharma shown (lines 22-29).

Thus three kāyas speech explained, sentient beings bodhisattvas and, buddhas all mind satisfied, thus beings hopes fulfill (lines 30-33). Thus it is spoken (line 34).

Thus introduction two shown meaning and purpose arranged (line 35): thus I taught time once, Vajrapāṇi I before Samantabhadra heard complete retinue taught, or Vajrapāṇi tantra's teacher accepted retinue I taught (lines 36-38).

From Talgyur (line 39): teacher's speech retinue shown (line 40). Thus it is spoken (line 41).

Also Vajradhara Buddha is (line 42). From Śrīparamādi (line 43): buddhas all before Buddha, Vajradhara king vajra mind (lines 44-45). Thus spoken and (line 46):

From Training Tantra (line 1 of next section): buddhas all before Buddha, ignorance stains all destroyed. Vajra vajra-holder king, vajra vajra vajra-holder. Vajrapāṇi mahāmudrā (lines 2-7). Thus it is spoken (line 8).

Third mistaken refutations abandon (line 23): wisdom eye closed dharmas number waves form look opportunity without thinking, sūtra tantra other thus I heard spoke, taught this not arisen fabricated, taught fabricated become (lines 24-27).

From Cakrasamvara Root Tantra (line 28): then secret taught, thus spoke, that also fabricated defect, also answer two taught not suitable, melody expressed section whole not suitable, prose one verse one repeat teacher, name two taught also not suitable (lines 29-35).

Therefore meaning tantra arising shown uncommon introduction, word tantra arising shown common introduction, not-contradictory very connected shown (lines 36-38).

Those introduction definite meaning shown (line 39).

Listen carefully! Ratnaketu shows us the three kayas from the side of purity. Dharmakaya—grasping self purified, elaborationless palace, self-undifferentiated retinue, signless speech, elaborationless dharmas. Not-spoke, spoke not! This is the equality state.

Sambhogakaya—self-clear pure, five lights palace, elaborationless great bliss speech, five families retinue. Not-spoke, yet self-arisen great shown!

Nirmanakaya—without attachment, dharmas shown according to disciple's faculties, from memory self-clear mind. The appropriate teaching for each.

And all three satisfy the minds of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. All hopes fulfilled!

The introduction—"Thus I heard"—this is Vajrapani hearing from Samantabhadra, from Vajradhara. The lineage unbroken, the meaning suitable, generating faith in the retinue.

And the refutation of the mistaken view that these are fabricated! The Cakrasamvara Tantra answers: if it were fabricated, it would have defects. But the uncommon introduction shows meaning arising, the common shows word arising. Not contradictory! Very connected!
