PAGE 63 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa continues listing the mistaken views [2165-2245], and the sheer number should overwhelm you! Moon-dawners, sun-dawners, hand-eaters, heart-livers, possessors of three aggregates, those who live by two or three [2165-2175]—each name represents a whole philosophy, a complete worldview, held sincerely by beings who believe it leads to liberation.

And the seventy, eighty, ninety [2176-2207]—owls, forest dwellers, dog-possessors, dwellers on riverbanks, garment-piece possessors—on and on it goes. For every way of thinking, there is a school. For every limitation, there is a doctrine that turns that limitation into the path.

The Samkhyas hold that atoms, darkness, and three energies are permanent [2246-2254]. They believe that delusion is the basis of action, attachment produces happiness, anger turns back armies. This is strategic spirituality! Use the afflictions as tools. But does it work? Can you really control anger, use it precisely, and not be burned?

The Vaisesikas view outer aggregates as minute atoms [2255-2262]—the building blocks of reality. They count these atoms, analyze them, believe they have found the fundamental nature of things. This is the scientific impulse! Reduce everything to smallest parts, understand the parts, and you understand the whole. But who understands? What is the nature of the understanding itself?

Kumaralabha says mind is nonexistent, body is nonexistent [2263-2266]. When body is abandoned, all is empty. This is nihilism pure and simple. If all is empty and nonexistent, why practice? Why care? This view leads to despair, to the rejection of all meaning.

Karnaputra sees appearance as permanent through circumstances [2267-2271], yet holds ultimate appearance as impermanent. This is confusion! Mixing permanence and impermanence without clear understanding, creating a muddle that satisfies no one.

And the secret teachings of the five fires [2272-2283]—sending lamps, burning the body, cooking with sandalwood, wrapping in fire-cloth—these are not metaphorical! People actually did these things, believing extreme asceticism would purify karma. But you cannot burn away delusion with outer fire. Only the fire of wisdom, the flame of recognition, can do that.

All these views [2421-2425] gather into four types, then into two—permanence and interruption—and finally, all are wrong paths to avoid. But how do you avoid them? Not by adopting the opposite view! You avoid them by seeing through the one who holds views, the one who establishes positions, the one who believes and disbelieves. When that one is seen through, all views are simultaneously liberated.
