You who study the unelaborate! Lines 8755-8767 describe mandala unelaborate empowerment—syllable wheel verse bestow, speech place pure syllable channel press bliss introduce. You press and introduce! But this is direct. Like a key in a lock—opens directly.

This outer inner secret perfect four at lines 8757-8767—unelaborate outer body speech mind syllable purify, inner all dharmas birth not vase place certain, secret whatever thing nature not shine liberate borderless, perfect all dharmas empty self not mantra verse turn empowerment jewel. You purify through four! But they are one. Like four directions—one space.
