Listen, dear practitioner! Do you see how the Buddha adapts to each place, each time, each retinue? Vulture Peak for sravakas, Mongolian lands for bodhisattvas, different teachers, different teachings—but all are emanations of the same wisdom. Do not cling to one form, one place! The Buddha appears wherever beings need him. Grdhrakuta, turquoise lands, bodhi trees—where is the Buddha not present? Recognize this, and every place becomes the Pure Land!

Emaho! Twelve emanations to tame twelve types—all are your own mind's display!
