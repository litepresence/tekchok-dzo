You who would receive the secret empowerments! Lines 7941-7957 describe elaborate substances—peacock, mirror, arrow, sword, body tsaka-li, speech letter, mind hand-emblem. You collect these objects! But they are symbols pointing to your own body, speech, and mind. Like a finger pointing at the moon—don't bite the finger!

The seven substances, seven stops at line 7950. You think this is about external substances! But it's about the seven chakras, the seven energies in your own body. Like seven locks on a door—each must be opened for the door to swing wide.

Lines 7957-7971 speak of inner auspicious substance eight—empowerment desired object perfection. What is the desired object? Recognition! Like a thirsty person wanting water—finally receiving it and realizing thirst and water were never separate.

The system pour, line draw three at lines 7972-7976—common, protruding supreme, both attainment. You want the supreme! But common practice done with full recognition is supreme. Like a simple meal eaten with full awareness is better than a feast eaten mindlessly.

Lines 7977-7981: body Amitābha, speech Avalokiteśvara, mind great-empowerment gathering. These are not three separate deities! They are your own body, speech, mind when recognized. Like one person with three names—different contexts, same being.

Elaboration-with very elaboration-free at lines 7981-7995—sindhura, mirror, conch, skull-cup, bone ornament, great-ashes. You get lost in the details! But all point to one thing: the inseparability of bliss and emptiness. Like heat and fire—where there is one, there is the other.

Bodhicitta two at lines 7989-7995—white-red, mirror crown, tongue lion-thumb, vajra secret, space-secret non-dual. These are the red and white essences in your own body. Like two streams flowing into one river—separate sources, one water.
