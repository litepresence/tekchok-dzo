COMMENTARY ON PAGE 137

Now explained the sequence of long and short, heavy and light (line 1). The first is this: in whatever tantra, however letters of mantra may appear, whether stacked or single, the inverted letters are placed wherever appropriate at the root, and whatever prefix has arisen, the inverted [letter] is joined to the palate at the tip of the tongue, expressed directly without inversion, as it is called (lines 3-9). Like ṬA to TA, and so forth (line 11).

The branches are also joined appropriately to the mother [letter] and expressed (line 13). These are read combined together as one life-force and kindred class, like K+KA, like K+AÜ (lines 15-19). Not as single [letters] but each separately expressed, like G+HAJA and so forth (lines 21-23).

This also [comes] from Rigpa Rangdrol: the letters' mantra are thus: the inverted, the prefix, and the branches are all expressed here as they are, and each is pronounced as appropriate (lines 25-31). The inverted [letter] is tagged and becomes manifest. The mother herself is placed as basis. The branches are nirvāṇa letters. The prefix is only saṃsāra. Thus mantras and letters, each is pronounced as appropriate. Thus it is spoken (lines 33-41).

This also [comes] from Rangshar: the non-saṃsāric is explained, the prefix and branches are nirvāṇa's letters explained (lines 43-47). From Rigpa Rangdrol, the mother is not placed as basis: the prefix is saṃsāra and the branches are nirvāṇa—these two explanations are not contradictory but are understood according to context (lines 47-49).

At that time, when saṃsāra's sentient beings are pervaded by the Buddha's essence, and sentient beings are taken as basis, the letters' mother is made saṃsāric, so the prefix and branches are understood as saṃsāra (lines 51-53).

When the nature of awareness separates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the manner of distinction and completeness, that mother is shown as awareness and placed as basis: the prefix is explained as saṃsāra and the branches are expressed as the dharmas of nirvāṇa (lines 55-55).

In their nature they are always joined together, for they are designations without inherent existence (line 57). When impure saṃsāra is indicated, the root letter is taken as the mind of pride (lines 57-59).

The prefix and branch above [the letter] exist as karma and afflictions, aggregates and elements, sense-fields and elements, grasping and so forth—and are also explained thus (lines 61-63 of next section).

When pure nirvāṇa is explained, that mother letter is self-arisen wisdom, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the three kāyas, five wisdoms, five lights, and ten powers (lines 1-3 of next section).

When saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are both explained on one basis, that mother letter is awareness itself, and the prefix and branch are explained as the dharmas of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa (lines 5-5).

When the basis is explained, that mother letter is awareness, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the essential nature, compassion, and the five winds (lines 7-7).

When the path is explained, that mother letter is the basis-nature, the essence of the heart, which is the nature of the threefold compassion; and the prefix and branch are also explained as the four lamps of basis-appearance and the four appearances (lines 9-9).

When the result is explained, that mother letter is the Buddha's mind, self-arisen wisdom and branch are also; and the prefix explained as the kāyas, wisdoms, qualities, and activities (lines 11-11).

In brief, whatever meaning is shown, the chief one is the mother letter at that time of explanation, and its retinue—the prefix and branch—should be explained (lines 13-13).

The second, the sequence of long-short and heavy-light, is explained as follows, from Rigpa Rangdrol: sound is shown in four aspects: long, short, very long, and great. Thus the basis's sound is called (lines 15-19).

The short is one letter; when expressed, it is recited for the duration of one expression (line 20). The long equals two; depending on the occasion, it may be class-concordant, or when life-force is concordant even if class-discordant, there are stacked [letters] and those having a long portion (lines 21-21). The great is very long, arising for approximately the duration of three (line 22). The basis's sound is the expanse of letters, namely the mother, branch, and prefix together. Those, when life-force is concordant, are recited as one (lines 23-25).

When not concordant, they are recited separately (line 1 of next section).

Also, on some occasions, the short [letters] with prefix and branch, and single [letters] without any long portion, are expressed (lines 3-3). The "long" refers to those having the long portion of A (line 5). The "great" refers to K+KA and similar class-concordant stacked [combinations] (lines 7-7).

The basis's sound: KA with CA suffix, and so forth—these thick [letters] are renowned (lines 9-9). When joined with the musician, the duration of letters is counted as before; thus it should be known in Tibetan usage (lines 11-11). Joined with the tantra's own text, depending on purity and state, it is joined as below and explained accordingly (lines 13-13).

The definite heavy-light and long-short of these: the thick ones are heavy, the short ones are light (lines 15-15).
