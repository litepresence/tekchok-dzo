Fourth day: elemental power manifesting, eight channel wheels arise. Clear lights and syllables illuminating. Gathering wheels of taste like starlight. Wheels stacked like petals—the channel wheels are named.

Within these eight, at the center of five desire objects, bliss-touch's support. Warmth's essence, sheep-fat-like, the twelve sense bases' basis. The wheel of gathering and expanding, the karmic support of alaya.

Then from twenty-nine to thirty-two days: water gathers and holds, earth stabilizes and presses, fire blazes and expands, wind flames and moves. The work performed.

Thirty-second day: elemental power exhausted. Arises the wild wind of producing action. The four wind channels sent upward and outward. Upon the mustard-seed space of subtle particles, four more channels expand.

At their center, Tip-of-Force Wind petal, star-light-like radiance gathering. The power of the above element-basis exhausted.

Then thirty-four days: basis-of-all's four supports with their groups solidified. Affliction-gathering and coarse channel poison's vapor—poison-vase gathering. Tip-Arranged Wheel thus named and abides.

Thirty-fifth day: the King's Letter Tantra complete arises.

Seven by seven sections—forty-nine days, existence body's four channel wheels produced.

This is how a body is built. Forty-nine days of construction. Elements gathering, channels forming, winds moving, syllables resonating. All the apparatus of experience assembled piece by piece.

The body isn't you. The body is a construction site, still under construction from the moment of conception until death. Particles, channels, winds, syllables—all arranging themselves into this apparatus you call "me."

The construction has a purpose: to experience. To taste, to touch, to feel pleasure and pain. To gather the five desire objects through twelve sense bases. To perpetuate the wheel.

But the constructor—the awareness that set all this in motion—that was never constructed. That never formed from elements, never gathered from channels, never depended on winds.

You are not the construction. You are the constructor. The house is not the homeowner.

The house will fall. The construction will end. The forty-nine days will complete and then dissolve.

The constructor remains, never having been born, never having died, never having been formed.

Which are you? The house or the homeowner?
