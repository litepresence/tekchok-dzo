From above only perception exists, from that dwelling without any other. Immeasurable beings expand, also called "nothing at all," also called "slightly nothing." You read these names of the formless absorptions and think of high meditation states. But listen, you who would understand your own mind.

"Nothing at all" is not liberation. It is the suppression of perception so refined that there seems to be nothing. But the one who perceives nothing is still there. The subtle grasping remains. "Slightly nothing" is the recognition that even nothing is something, so one settles into a state where there is almost nothing, just a slight presence, a whisper of existence.

The text says these states arise from good concentration, but going increasingly bad below. This is crucial. From the highest formless state, when the karma that sustains it exhausts, one does not stay there. One falls. And because one has been in a state of such subtle grasping, the fall is long and the landing is hard. The formless gods, when they exhaust their merit, are often reborn in lower realms because they have not accumulated the causes for higher rebirth while dwelling in their absorption.

Emanation body arisen from that appearance, body size smaller than above, light brilliance also small. As one descends through the formless realms, the appearance of body returns, but it is less radiant than before. Labeled as sound denying low called "nothing at all." The denial itself becomes the label. The very negation becomes a kind of assertion.

Ayatana by arisen and increased from above appearance—afflictions not manifestly moving, dwell in subtle latency. This is the danger of high meditation without wisdom. The afflictions are not purified; they are merely suppressed. They dwell in latency, like seeds waiting for the right conditions to sprout. When the meditation ends, when the absorption lapses, the afflictions return, often stronger than before.

These dwell in concentration called jewel box. A beautiful name for a trap. The jewel box is precious, but it is still a box. It confines. It limits. The formless gods are trapped in their own achievement, unable to move forward because they think they have reached the end.

Then the text quotes the Secret Essence: "E ma ho from Sugata heart, self thought karma emanation." This is the truth. All these realms, all these absorptions, all these states—they are self-thought, karma-emanation. They are created by your own mind. The Sugata heart, the Buddha nature, emanates them as play, as expression, but they are not the nature itself.

From Condense: "When conditions gather, karma confusion wheel arises." This is the mechanism. When the conditions come together, when the causes and conditions align, the wheel of karma and confusion turns. Worlds arise. Realms appear. Gods and hell-beings manifest. It is all dependent arising, empty of inherent existence.

Not new born—obscuration is together born ignorance equal endow to awareness, to that space part. This is profound. The obscuration is not something new that is added to awareness. It is co-emergent with awareness itself. It is the other side of the coin. Where there is awareness, there is the potential for ignorance of that awareness's nature. They are together born.

Not confusion later, first pure, only made actually clear by adventitious condition. The nature is not confused and then purified. It is pure from the beginning. The confusion is adventitious, added on, like clouds covering the sky. The sky was never stained by the clouds. Remove the clouds, and the sky is clear. Remove the confusion, and the nature is seen.

But the formless gods do not see this. They dwell in their jewel box, thinking they have escaped. Until the conditions change, and they fall.
