Longchenpa explains the stages of heat, patience, peak, and supreme dharma [2960-2978], and these are signs you can recognize in your own practice! Heat is the first sign that realization is approaching [2960-2971]—like warmth before sunrise. You feel something changing, something opening, something becoming possible that seemed impossible before.

The outer heat: entities appear as empty [2964]. The world loses its solidity, its heaviness, its inevitability. You see through the illusion of substantial reality. The inner heat: understanding the pure knowable as empty [2968]. Not just outer objects, but inner knowing, the mind itself, is seen through. The heat of both: outer and inner recognized as one display [2969-2971].

Then patience [2971-2972]—not waiting, but bearing. You have seen emptiness; now you can endure it. You no longer panic when the ground dissolves. You no longer rush to reconstruct solidity. You can rest in openness without fear.

Then the peak [2973]—the highest point of worldly attainment. You have reached the summit of conditioned existence. Beyond this lies the supramundane, the direct perception of the noble ones. You are ready for breakthrough.

Then supreme dharma [2974]—the final refinement before the path of seeing. Your practice is pure, unsurpassed, completely prepared. The ground is ready; the seed of awakening will sprout.

The ten grounds [2974-2975]—from Great Joy to Cloud of Dharma—describe the maturation of buddhahood itself. Each ground dissolves deeper obscurations, manifests clearer wisdom. But these are not places you go! They are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely you have released the illusion of a separate self.

Then Longchenpa turns to established tenet views [2979], beginning with Mind-Only [2981-2995]. They assert appearances are aspects of consciousness, with no external reality. This is a crucial insight! But they stop there, grasping at mind itself. The Middle Way goes further, showing mind too is empty.

The example of the jewel in water [2984-2988]—the reflection appears, but is the jewel in the water? No. Does that mean there is no jewel? No. So with all appearances—they appear, but not as they seem. The Mind-Only view corrects materialism but risks idealism. The Middle Way transcends both.
