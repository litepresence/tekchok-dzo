PAGE 67 COMMENTARY

Longchenpa summarizes the classification of all views [2396-2428], gathering them into two, then four, showing how the countless philosophical positions all derive from grasping at permanence or interruption.

"Extreme view" refers to eternal permanence [2401]—the belief in something that lasts forever, unchanging, truly existent. This is the comfort of the ego! You want to believe you have a soul, a self, something that will persist. You want to believe in a God who is solid and reliable. You want to believe in truths that never change.

"Extreme end" declares permanent is permanent, impermanent is impermanent—both [2401]. This is the attempt to have it both ways, to acknowledge change while still grasping at permanence. It satisfies the intellect but leaves the heart confused.

"Distant benefit": half permanent, half interrupted [2401]. This is the compromiser, the one who says "some things last, some things don't." It seems reasonable, moderate, balanced. But it is still dualistic grasping!

"Indifference": completely interrupted [2401]. This is nihilism—the belief that nothing lasts, nothing matters, everything ends in annihilation. This is despair, the rejection of all meaning, the denial of continuity.

These four gather into permanence and interruption [2401-2421]. And these two are the fundamental error! The mind that divides reality into existing and not-existing, into lasting and ceasing, into being and non-being—this is the mind that suffers. For what exists can be lost. What does not exist can be regretted. What lasts must end. What ceases might have continued.

The Buddha's teaching transcends both! Not by mixing them, not by finding a middle point between them, but by seeing through the one who holds them. Who is it that believes in permanence? Who is it that fears interruption? Search for this one, and you cannot find it. The searcher itself is unfindable.

Thus the purpose of teaching these views [2425]: not entering through recognizing wrong paths. But the recognition must be direct, not merely intellectual. You must feel in your bones the futility of all positions, the impossibility of capturing reality in concepts. Then, and only then, do you stop grasping at views and rest in what is beyond all view.
