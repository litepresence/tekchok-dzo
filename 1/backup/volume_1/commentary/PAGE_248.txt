Listen well, you who hold the secret teachings! Lines [10042-10121] reveal the root samayas that bind practitioner to path like a lifeline to a drowning man!

The outer secret—never disparage your vajra siblings! These are not ordinary companions. They are manifestations of your own mind's purity. To speak ill of them is to cut your own tongue. From the Glorious Sky of Exhaustion Tantra: if bad mind arises toward them, you cut three hundred lifetimes! Your sin equals theirs! This is not mere metaphor—you bind yourself to aeons of suffering!

The inner secret—the guru's mudra, the consort of wisdom. This is not ordinary union! This is the meeting of emptiness and compassion, space and awareness. To violate this is to violate the very nature of reality itself!

The secret of secrets—the guru himself! The guru is not a person outside you. The guru is your own rigpa, appearing in form to guide you. To see the guru as ordinary is to see the ocean as merely water. To harm the guru is to drown in your own delusion!

Twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind—these are your armor against the demons of doubt and distraction. Break them and you stand naked before samsara's storms. Keep them and you walk as a vajra master among men!

Lines [10115-10121] warn: outer secret wrong view abandons the path. Inner secret disparages the dharma. Secret of secrets exceeds the root samaya. Each transgression cuts deeper than the last. Like a tree falling—first the branches, then the trunk, then the root!

Guard these secrets as you guard your own heart! For in them lies the path to liberation!

Emaho! The secret that cannot be told!
