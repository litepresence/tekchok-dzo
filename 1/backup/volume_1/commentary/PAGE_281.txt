[11682-11686] Listen! The tamer and what tames—both are your own mind playing. Secret Essence itself is great compassion. Six realms appear yet don't abide. Like clouds in sky—there, but never staying.

[11687-11690] Look! Light and sound awareness-base appear, yet the five elements have no separate existence. If you say they don't exist, awareness is not cut off inside. If you say the container-contents don't arise—you miss the point entirely.

[11691-11694] Three doors of body, speech, mind—three kayas of Buddha gather. No separation! Body appearing like body yet not existing as body—this is the nature. Do you see?

[11695-11698] Primordial wisdom appears yet is non-existent. If you claim transcendence from samsara joins path-wisdom, you fall into defect. Extremes liberated—appear yet Buddha doesn't return. Non-arising itself is the quality.

[11699-11702] Impure door appears—yet spontaneous arising doesn't exist there. Beings appear in samsara but awareness-face doesn't come for a purpose. Six realms individually appear—that's the nature.

[11703-11710] Great power from the base! Even playing in samsara's bad realms is primordial arising. Pure primordial-wisdom door non-existent—nirvana's appearance has no coming. Spontaneous eight appear-methods, eight qualities—suitable to count, suitable to see.
