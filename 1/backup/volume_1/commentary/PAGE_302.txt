Listen well, practitioner of symbols! Lines [12546-12565] unveil the profound meaning hidden in appearances!

Old-one heap-possess-by-means-of door close! Yacha! Then man four-by-means-of chase catch! Man five horse from separate! Yacha! Son two self-by-means-of self lose! Prison guard kill! Yacha!

Son two rain sun-possess-as flee! Subjects on tax gather! Queen twenty one-by-means-of counsel do! Samrudra god-house to flee! Man five armor five wear! Door guard-by-means-of! Who-also come not-capable! Yacha!

Then mirror four-by-means-of face look! Self-by-means-of self face know! Yacha! Then house one-to door eight exist see! Self to self laughter lose! Yacha!

Thus symbol appearance all! Indicate-by-means-of wisdom meaning to apply! Said! That teacher Light-Spread! Self arise-by-means-of wisdom! Son two! Awareness pure and spontaneous-by-means-of wisdom two! Cave-as prison grasp!

Like a coded message from a hidden king! Like a treasure map disguised as a child's drawing! The symbols point to what cannot be spoken directly!

The four men chasing—the four elements binding! The five horses separating—the five senses dispersing! The two sons losing themselves—pure awareness and spontaneous wisdom trapped in the prison of grasping!

The twenty-one queens counseling—the twenty-one demonstrations of primordial wisdom! The five armored guards—the five wisdoms protecting!

The four mirrors showing—the four lamps revealing self-face! The house with eight doors—the eight consciousnesses! Losing laughter—recognizing the absurdity of seeking what was never lost!

Read the symbols! Decode the message! The teacher has already shown you your own face!

Emaho! The secret language of realization!
