You who have come this far—do not stop! This page, like those before it, continues the systematic presentation of the Great Perfection teachings. The seventeen tantras, the three categories, the countless enumerations—all are laid out with precision and care.

But now, having read through all these pages, having studied all these classifications, you must ask yourself: What have I understood? Not intellectually, not as information to recall, but in my bones, in my being, in the depths of my heart?

The purpose of all this teaching is not to make you a scholar. It is to wake you up. Like someone shaking you from sleep—the words are the shaking, but the waking is up to you. No one can wake up for you. You must open your own eyes.

So look! Right now. What is aware of these words? What knows the reading? Is it far away? Is it difficult to find? Or is it present, immediate, unmistakable? That which knows—knows. That which is aware—is aware. This is it. This has always been it.

All the tantras point here. All the categories converge here. The Mind Category, the Space Category, the Instruction Category—all are ways of saying: look at your mind. The four cycles—outer, inner, secret, unsurpassable—are stages of looking more and more closely until there is nothing left to see but seeing itself.

Do not be satisfied with understanding. Demand recognition. Do not be content with belief. Demand direct knowledge. The Great Perfection is not a religion to adopt; it is a reality to recognize. Your own face, your own nature, your own primordial freedom.

So practice. Study if it helps. Contemplate if it inspires. Meditate if it clarifies. But always return to this: what is the nature of the one who studies, contemplates, meditates? Find that, and you have found everything.

Longchenpa has given you the treasury. Now spend it. Do not hoard these teachings. Do not let them become dust on a shelf. Live them. Breathe them. Be them. This is the greatest offering you can make to the lineage, to your teachers, to yourself.

May you recognize your own nature. May you be free. May all beings recognize their own nature and be free. This is the wish of all Buddhas. This is the purpose of all teachings. This is the truth that has no end.
