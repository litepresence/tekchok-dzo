COMMENTARY on Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume 1, Page 270

You who are fascinated by colors and lights! Longchenpa speaks to you at lines [11152-11169] of self-resound producing white part, depth clear great itself-as dwell, depth clear essence splendor producing, appearance self-dissolve yellow part, own-face attachment not resound produce, self bind free of, attachment self-dissolve red part, and so on. You hear "white, yellow, red, green, blue" and you think this is about seeing lights in meditation, about having visions. Foolish! These colors are not outside you. They are the display of your own awareness. White is the depth-clear essence producing its own splendor. Yellow is appearance self-dissolving into its own face. Red is attachment self-dissolving, freeing itself.

At lines [11170-11182], form appearance sign characteristic free, primordially self pure great-to, complete those-of peak-as dwell, this-to power appear not, heap possess sign mark self pure cause, depth clear great-of base-as dwell, pervade and pervade itself empty, open-from cut not appear, clear make appear part not cease, essence all extract gather-of, impurity not and own-place pure, Buddha all possession secret great at, nature possession part at abide. You look for form, for signs, for characteristics. But these are free—free from the beginning. Primordially pure. The great peak is where they dwell, yet no power appears there. Why? Because there is no heap to possess, no sign to mark. The depth-clear great base—itself empty, pervading and pervaded, open, cut, not appearing. Yet the clear making-appearance does not cease. The essence is extracted, gathered, impurity-free, own-place pure. This is the great secret possession of all Buddhas. The nature possession abides in its own part.

At lines [11184-11199], he speaks of nature spontaneous-presence appearance, jewel casket intention, inside wisdom jewel appearance clear at, outside limitless not-separate, youth vase body actual-state called. Third meaning gathering: essence primordially pure thing and mark not-exist, nature spontaneous-presence body and wisdom gather-separate not-exist intention abide, that two essence one appear empty two not-exist, that actual-state essence empty not-change body identity is, body three gather-separate not-exist sun center like inside clear although thing and mark not-established, nature primordial-resonance light clear although outside appear color marked not-exist, compassion awareness wisdom abide although form outside object not-investigate, essence nature compassion three abide. You think inside and outside are separate. You think wisdom is inside, appearance outside. But the jewel casket—inside is the wisdom jewel, clear. Outside is limitless, not separate. The youth vase body is the actual state. Essence and nature—are they one or two? They appear as one, yet empty of twoness. The three bodies are not gathered or separate—like the center of the sun, inside clear, yet thing and mark not established. Nature's primordial resonance is light-clear, yet outside no color marks exist. Compassion, awareness, wisdom abide, yet form outside is not investigated.

At lines [11200-11222], from the Rangshar Tantra: I not-exist earlier front at base thus abide, base primordially-pure great called, essence nature compassion form three-as abide, essence that not-change wisdom not-cease clear, youth vase body actual-state called, nature light five appearance not-cease, compassion appearance example like sky cloud not-exist like. From the Thalgyur: Essence primordially-pure wisdom at, ignorance called exist-name not-exist, one and two number not-exist, examine exist not-exist establish not-exist, where not-divide dharma-nature from, wisdom only also accomplish not-exist, word not-exist speech accomplish not-exist, end at not-abide self-aware pure, speech hold name end exhaust, cause not-exist condition number not-exist at, two appearance object and subject not-exist, characteristic where-also divide not-exist, subject coarse exhaust, primordially not-exist pure pure.

"I" does not exist earlier—yet the base thus abides. Called primordially pure great. Essence, nature, compassion, form—three aspects of one abiding. Ignorance is called, but the name has no existence. One and two—numbers do not apply. Examine existence and non-existence—neither is established. Where not divided from dharma-nature, wisdom only also does not accomplish. Words do not exist—speech accomplishes nothing. At the end, not abiding, self-aware pure. Hold speech, name, end—they exhaust. No cause, no condition, no number—at that, object and subject do not exist. Characteristics divide nowhere. Subject coarse exhausts. Primordially not existing—pure, pure.

So let the colors be. Let the lights be. They are your own display, self-dissolving, self-pure. Do not grasp at them. Do not chase them. Rest in the youth vase body, the actual state, and let appearances be the ornament of your own nature.
