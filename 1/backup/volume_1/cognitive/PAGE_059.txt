[1949-1961] The text distinguishes two types of nihilism regarding cause and result. The first, cause-nihilism, is held by Nirgranthas and others who deny the continuity of mind from past to present. They posit that mind inherently exists in the four elements, and when these condense through contact with warmth and moisture, the inherent mind awakens and enters the new body. This sophisticated materialism requires careful preservation of its internal coherence.

[1962-1973] The nihilists argue that mind exists in earth producing trees and forests, in water producing moisture and sound, in fire producing burning, in wind producing movement. They conclude that if beings have past lives and mind, so do trees and stones. Yet they deny this, holding instead that present aggregation produces results like curd from milk. The analogy requires preservation of its agricultural context.

[1974-1982] Evidence for their position includes seasonal transformations: from summer's heat and moisture, parts of horse-hoof leaves swell while others remain unchanged; ants become bees, frogs transform. Therefore cause is not permanent. Summer's ants' nests contain twigs and rice husks that become sentient beings. This empirical argumentation requires translation that preserves its observational basis without importing modern biological categories.
