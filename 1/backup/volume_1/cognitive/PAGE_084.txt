[3087-3113] From Kundika Sutra: Thus-gone always unborn dharma, all dharmas like Sugata. Childish minds grasp characteristics, in the world practicing nonexistent dharmas. From Root Wisdom: What dependently arises, unceasing therefore unborn, uncut therefore impermanent, uncoming therefore ungoing, not different meaning not same meaning, elaboration ceasing, peace shown. To that supreme of Perfect Buddhas' speakers, homage. From Refutation of Debate: If I had any thesis, at that time I would have this fault. Because I have no thesis, I am indeed faultless. Because nothing is to be refuted, I refute nothing. Therefore that accusation you made. Thus.

[3114-3130] This also, asserting no composed philosophical position because elaborations cease. Though various-appearances mere-worldly are established as term-knowledge's branch, because this also has no assertion, dharma-appearances transcend true-false, free from existence-nonexistence extremes and present time. This is Buddhists' established-philosophical-position speakers' peak. This's great texts are Middle Way's six reasoning collections: Root Wisdom, Sixty Reasonings, Seventy Emptinesses, Fine Analysis, Refutation of Debate, Establishment of Convention. This also, Arya Nagarjuna's former face: first teaching wheel's four truths' dharma-wheel commentaries, speech collections composed; middle characteristicless dharma-wheel's commentaries, reasoning collections composed; final ultimate discrimination's dharma-wheel's commentaries, praise collections composed. Therefore this master is Second Buddha, turning dharma-wheel.
