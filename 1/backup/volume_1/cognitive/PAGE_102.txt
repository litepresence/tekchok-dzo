[3764-3777]
Structural function establishes the two categories of klong dkar po related to vast action and view-meditation integration. View register positions these as expressions of the ocean-like expanse where primordial purity manifests without effort. Translation risks render "las rgya che ba" as mere magnitude rather than recognizing its technical sense of vast activity without causal origination. Preservation requirements maintain the distinction between the ocean expanse and sky expanse as separate categories with specific characteristics.

[3778-3785]
Structural function details the great ocean expanse through self-abiding emptiness and primordial liberation. View register emphasizes the single wheel of great transcendence dwelling in emptiness. Translation risks lose the technical precision of "yin rang 'das chen po" as a specific classification. Preservation requirements note the phrase "stong pas gang du yang grub pa med par" establishes the view of emptiness without established existence anywhere.

[3786-3796]
Structural function introduces the sky expanse with its two divisions of sun-moon expanse and jewel-white expanse. View register presents the essence of dharmatā as unalterable self-liberation. Translation risks misinterpret "rin po che'i klong dkar po" as metaphorical rather than technical terminology. Preservation requirements ensure the spontaneous perfection of qualities and self-purification of causes and conditions remains distinct from lower vehicle concepts.

[3797-3808]
Structural function presents the rab 'byams sde through the essence of appearance known by mind and non-appearance known by natural state. View register classifies four types of vastness: external, internal, secret, and suchness. Translation risks conflate these categories without recognizing their hierarchical relationship. Preservation requirements maintain the three essential points of causelessness, conditionlessness, and non-establishment of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as foundational to the external vastness.
