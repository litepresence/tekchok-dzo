[6065-6110] The verse from Sgra thal 'gyur establishes the mechanism of emanation resting in body, speech, and mind while appearing to disciples. The detailed explanation of how the teaching support emerged describes Vajradhara establishing the Tshangs chen realm and the subsequent passage of countless aeons before this world system formed. The seven periods of waxing and waning—snying po ldan, rdzogs ldan, rdzogs ldan chen po, nyis ldan, sum ldan, rtsod ldan, and rtsod ldan chen po—structure the temporal framework for understanding the duration and quality of teachings. The dark aeons between each period must be enumerated precisely to preserve the cosmological structure.

[6111-6138] The prophecy continues with the seven periods specified in detail, each lasting specific durations in the northern, southern, eastern, and western directions. The preservation of the names of the location holders, their patrons, and the exact durations in years maintains the predictive structure. The technical term bstan pa'i btsas refers to the supports of the teaching in a specific sense that differs from the teachings themselves, and this distinction requires careful terminology. The mention of the final dissolution into the great void establishes the temporal limits of this world system's capacity to sustain manifestation.
