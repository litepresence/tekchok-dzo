[19355] Conventional cause's bindu and
[19356] Abide ultimate's bindu
[19357] Thus said
[19358] First prior also extensively show
[19359] Slightly explain
[19360] That from
[19361] Conventional cause's bindu embodied all's channel within abide
[19362] Father's cause and mother's condition appear
[19363] That also elements essence gather mother bindu red become
[19364] Bodhicitta all's sediment gather from father's bindu white become
[19365] Therefore elements gather from form ripen
[19366] Bodhicitta gather from mindfulness-thought and feeling and awareness gather
[19367] That also miraculously-born and
[19368] Egg-born and
[19369] Warmth-moisture-born at also elements gather seed and
[19370] Bodhicitta gather seed two self-constituent gather from birth take
[19371] Thus embodied all at body gather do bindu white-red two self-constituent abide
[19372] That male at elements seed elements own-scope self-absorb manifestly not-appear
[19373] Female at bodhicitta seed ground unchange manifestly not-emerge
[19374] Therefore bun-without at bliss meditate suitable
[19375] Bindu and wind meditate even unliberated for
[19376] Thus seed two-by-means-of aggregates support do
[19377] Persons life's conditioning also this two-by-means-of do
[19378] Elements self-self awareness enemy-by-means-of temporarily condition
[19379] Elements state-by-means-of strength exhaust at
[19380] This two abide from transfer do is
[19381] Thus said
[19382] That male at bindu and
[19383] Elements seed two separate for
[19384] Seed first channel-view's support
[19385] End transfer-by-means-of life condition
[19386] Channel right's upper-tip crown hams essence
