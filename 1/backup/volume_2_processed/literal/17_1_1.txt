[6490] By-say etc. explained
[6491] That-from mind exist then
[6492] Entity form-possess-to exist or
[6493] Form not-exist-to exist
[6494] Form-possess-to not-exist exist then power direct-perception-to see suitable-from see suitable not observe direct-perception valid-cognition-by clear
[6495] Form not-exist-to exist then how know
[6496] Movement know by-say
[6497] Movement that need and direction part and
[6498] Past future present three meet examine-from not establish
[6499] Movement before and now movement meet then meet part memory-thought before that now not cease exist need and
[6500] Exist then before is contradict and
[6501] Now before and part that cease conclude and not meet then now memory-thought cause not-exist movement suitable not conclude-from stop
[6502] Movement one is or different
[6503] One then various-to movement lose and
[6504] Different then move-make one is-from lose
[6505] Thus mind exist-to not establish
[6506] Root separate sky like realize-from
[6507] Birth and birth-basis not-exist-from return place not-exist
[6508] Place not-exist then memory-thought before after interval-to face-introduce-from there dissolve-from mind-to basis not-exist recognize
[6509] That know-from return place not-exist faith
[6510] That know-from realm three name not-exist great-to decide
[6511] That dharma-from action virtue vice benefit harm not-exist mind happy
[6512] Also appearance know before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[6513] Mind-to cause and characteristic-to not establish recognize
[6514] That know-from mind itself empty-to identify grasp not-exist faith
[6515] That believe-from mind by-say cause condition-from not arise decide
[6516] That dharma-from memory-thought sudden thought-by benefit harm not-exist mind happy
[6517] Also mind happy
[6518] Also mind before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[6519] Mind-to root not-exist recognize
[6520] That know-from mind itself one wheel-to elaboration different not-exist faith
[6521] That believe-from made dharma-by buddha not become decide
[6522] That cut-from mind not-exist meaning-from not realize side not-exist-from mind happy
[6523] Also dharma-nature before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[6524] Mind-to birth not-exist recognize
[6525] That know-from propensity body all-ground-by not harm faith
[6526] That believe-from now mind birth not possible decide
[6527] That dharma-from now mind house cease and return place and return-support not-exist mind happy
[6528] Thus mind search time four measure grasp-from
[6529] Buddha not-exist-from buddha name only-to also not-exist
[6530] Result-to hope hold mind turn
[6531] That turn-from path effort exertion-to make dharma not-exist
[6532] Thus not-exist dharma-to what also not-exist-from samsara nirvana-to designate name only-from meaning-to not find-to liberate measure by-say
[6533] That-from mind itself not-exist-to what also not-exist-from
[6534] Mind-to cause reason not-exist-from see not-exist and
[6535] Thus not-exist face-introduce four turn and
[6536] Dharma-possessor sixteen-to realize
[6537] Mind house destroy
[6538] Example child house build destroy like
[6539] That also action-by action destroy iron-by iron destroy like and
[6540] Not permanent-by not permanent destroy illusion person-by illusion city destroy like and
[6541] Made-by not permanent destroy corpse-on corpse stack like and
[6542] Not permanent-by made destroy wisdom now-by ignorance before destroy like
[6543] Thus mind-by mind destroy-from both track not-exist-to dissolve water-on letter write like and
[6544] Not-exist-by not-exist search also not find poor house-in wish-fulfilling jewel not-exist search-also find place not-exist like equal
[6545] Mind not-exist-to destroy place not-exist
[6546] Example dissolve time water-to hold place not-exist like
[6547] That-from mind not-exist meaning not know-from
[6548] View meditation conduct mind-to search
[6549] Bliss great liberation doctrine find time not-exist
[6550] Boat sink-from water-to enter like
[6551] Mind not-exist-to exist-to support that itself-by deceive and bind by-say
[6552] Samantabhadra heart mirror-from also
[6553] Appearance dharma-body-to desire me-to obstruction
[6554] Whatever-appear mind-to desire me-to obstruction
[6555] Self-arise other desire me-to obstruction
[6556] By-say
[6557] Then mind dissolve by-say exist that not-exist-to gone not by-say
[6558] Dissolve before like examine-from not establish and
[6559] Not examine then-also sudden memory-thought thought dissolve-from
[6560] Mind self-continuum exist-from not-exist-to gone not-exist
[6561] Dissolve cause and dissolve condition where-to also not-exist
[6562] Then mind house destroy-to need not-exist destroy cause not-exist-from
[6563] Mind primordially not-exist-to
[6564] Not-exist nature realize-to make only-from
[6565] Mind house basis-or entity exist is not-exist
[6566] Memory source dharma-nature-to gone-from

[8910] Thus
[8911] Also empty-form rainbow-light bindu body etc. all
[8912] Outer intermediate-space-in exist widely say and
[8913] That-in exist think hold
[8914] Error by thus not indeed
[8915] Within body light-root clear-in exist all
[8916] Eye light-root clear-by inward empty-form see indeed
[8917] Also heart resonance-root all-pervade emanate indeed
[8918] Now base-appear arise time
[8919] Self face know self-glow-in clearly place-by
[8920] Increasingly clear go
[8921] Wind-mind pure time spontaneous appear what by body within see power-base dissolve-in within enter time
[8922] Measure reach cease go indeed
[8923] Again set time base-appear base-to dissolve primordially-pure free from
[8924] Appear that all expand appear time expand self-characteristic without
[8925] Within self-reverse from obscuration without
[8926] Here tantra and instruction-from outer sky-in exist say that
[8927] For-now intentional say condition outer sky-to eye place see portion and that-in exist like by
[8928] Nature outer-in exist other-by also see possible from
[8929] Outer-in without know
[8930] Other-by self empty-form not-see that body-by obscure by
[8931] Self-by see light-root pure gap-from within arise see hole-from within-in sun arise appear see like
[8932] Proof eye close-from empty-form see this-by also within-in exist know indeed
[8933] Therefore body etc. appear outer field-in without also exist like appear
[8934] Mirror-to look time face arise like
[8935] Within light-root clear mirror-in
[8936] Heart awareness face-like resonance appear that
[8937] Field-in without also within see reference pure light-root quality portion-from arise
[8938] Outer inner two portion mix appear only delusion also many all true
[8939] Manner thus understand person wisdom-possess great-perfection expanse-from arise called
[8940] Various self-free yogin I like
[8941] Manner this confident scripture-and join
[8942] Lion Power-Perfect great tantra-from
[8943] Body appear that all
[8944] Field appear not indeed
[8945] Example young girl-by
[8946] Mirror characteristic clear-to
[8947] Self face appear see like
[8948] Dharma-nature field sky-to
[8949] Awareness appear body-to arise
[8950] Self location-condition see indeed
[8951] Field-in exist not indeed
[8952] Reference pure manifest clear
[8953] Self center-and mandala with
[8954] Wisdom meaning-to field without
[8955] Sentient-being time-at field like appear
[8956] See field-to realize great
[8957] Understand field-in bliss great
[8958] Appear see experience great
[8959] Self-awareness one-only companion supreme
[8960] Appear field-in without by
[8961] Vajra nadi-thread itself-from
[8962] Portion body indeed think-not pervade
[8963] Thus
[8964] This understand-reason one exist by intelligence-possess all-by know must
[8965] Nature realize easy by body-appear say say contradiction without by
[8966] Outer sky-to space-awareness-and lamp-appear say confuse-possess all-to realize easy for explain must
[8967] Self within understand-reason former like indeed
[8968] Fifth special determine manner indeed
[8969] Awareness-to change without essential-point-by
[8970] First base-from transcend samsara-in delude also awareness bad-to go without
[8971] Then lama-by face-introduce that lose-from wander that later decide time joy and
[8972] First lose time delusion time awareness two-to good-bad distinction without
[8973] Not-meditate awareness and
[8974] Meditate time-to distinction without and
[8975] Wander time and
[8976] Pass time awareness-to good-bad without indeed
[8977] Sleep-to go time and
[8978] Wake time and
[8979] Go-come awareness-to good-bad distinction without like indeed
[8980] But appear manner good-bad dream joy-suffering only exist by
[8981] That-to depend-from path meditate indeed
[8982] Essence good-to go hope indeed not indeed
[8983] Awareness-to transfer-change without reason
[8984] That word also self-arise from
[8985] E ma ho
[8986] Jewel precious nectar this
[8987] Beginning without time time
[8988] I jewel precious lose
[8989] That time suffering wrong wander
[8990] Jewel precious nectar that
[8991] Search-by find place without indeed
[8992] Self-from self-arise self-by realize
[8993] Jewel precious nectar that
[8994] Lose not-feel find feel
[8995] Lose-by thing characteristic without
[8996] Find-by joy glow with
[8997] Find time and lose time
[8998] Distinction without one state-in realize
[8999] Thus
[9000] Also self-awareness state-in lose that self state-from find also
[9001] Self-awareness one wheel-from
[9002] Other-to enter without indeed
[9003] King treasure-in jewel lose-from jewel without-by suffering do indeed
[9004] Treasure-from find-by joy-bliss expand also two both treasure one-from not-move like
[9005] Awareness state-from samsara-nirvana two-as appear also thus like
[9006] This vast Dharma-nature expanse realize wish-fulfilling supreme self-essential-point determine secret-word indeed
[9007] Second that-from lamp experience demonstrate three indeed
[9008] Preliminary place characteristic
[9009] Actual lamp press-method
[9010] That-from appear arise-manner indeed
[9011] First indeed
[9012] Life this action all abandon
[9013] Lama holy please do
[9014] Very secluded place darkness decorate room-in immovable three-with sit
[9015] Lama yoga perfect meditate request heart-from place
[9016] Thalgyur from
[9017] Lamp press this-like indeed
[9018] Faith-possess samsara mind-free by
[9019] Lama offer-and giving do
[9020] Samsara connection all abandon
[9021] Secluded direction-or charnel-ground-in
[9022] Companion abandon one-only abide must
[9023] Thus
[9024] Second indeed
[9025] Ah-to place and
[9026] Clear enter two-from
[9027] First indeed
[9028] Cross-legged sit thumb finger press-by red-clear clear light round appear-to place experience take
[9029] Session short-to number many do
[9030] Thumb finger effort release slow look
[9031] Again press-by appear see Dharma-nature manifest appear called
[9032] That-from
[9033] Self thumb and finger-by
[9034] Bindu empty lamp press
[9035] Press that-from what arise
[9036] Dharma-nature manifest appear indeed
[9037] Thus
[9038] Clear enter indeed
[9039] Then light five appear-from first smoke like and
[9040] Dull illusion like and
[9041] Cloud hover like and
[9042] Fire spark emanate like and
[9043] Sun and moon and
[9044] Star form like and
[9045] Intermediate-space rainbow like and
[9046] Light white clear and
[9047] Yellow clear and
[9048] Red clear and
[9049] Green clear and
[9050] Blue and
[9051] Various and
[9052] Net pattern and
[9053] Ray arise and
[9054] Round gather and
[9055] Bindu and
[9056] Stupa and
[9057] God body and
[9058] Sentient-being form various there-here far-near self-appear time-at
[9059] Clear enter-by wind five arise appear measure without arise
[9060] Thalgyur from
[9061] That-from wisdom expand experience
[9062] Color and shape also
[9063] Outer and inner all clear pervade
[9064] Above-from above-to certain expand
[9065] This time body speech bliss sign
[9066] Appear measure and manner-with join
[9067] Thus
[9068] Third that-from appear arise manner indeed
[9069] First red-yellow round-from
[9070] Later light five rim-to appear indeed
[9071] Also wind essential-point-by move from
[9072] Outward hold slow essential-point
[9073] Then clear portion experience take-by
[9074] Lamp mirror like
[9075] Light slice like
[9076] Bindu bowl like-from body with expand indeed
[9077] That-from
[9078] Thus press appear indeed
[9079] First red pure
[9080] Empowerment complete round self-clear complete
[9081] Finger two pure-from three-to become
[9082] Then again again press-by
[9083] Wisdom five color indeed
[9084] White red green blue yellow
[9085] Field-to appear effort indeed
[9086] Then effort-without outer also
[9087] Wind portion-by go-come and
[9088] Mirror pure shape like-from
[9089] Two and three portion appear indeed
[9090] That itself always familiarity-from
[9091] Color five light-by also
[9092] Slice like-from edge cut appear
[9093] Field edge like-from see measure indeed
[9094] That-from familiarity measure find-from
[9095] Bindu center-to body with
[9096] Half body pure-to while abide
[9097] That-to five five pair-with
[9098] Very clear bindu-with connect
[9099] Father-mother body appear possess
[9100] Delusion-appear cease-from pure-field indeed
[9101] Thus
[9102] This all time-at formerly demonstrate measure and sign manner all arise
[9103] Wisdom perfect appear space and
[9104] Dharma-nature pure appear awareness and
[9105] Bindu ripen appear body-from mandala-to measure reach-from
[9106] Again Dharma-nature cease appear conduct
[9107] Thalgyur from
[9108] Wisdom perfect appear and
[9109] Dharma-nature first appear-from
[9110] Appear three perfect-from cease become
[9111] Thus and
[9112] This time body speech mind measure
[9113] Individual appear see time
[9114] Self-to ripen-by sign complete
[9115] Cease measure all manifest appear
[9116] Thus
[9117] Thus experience take-by effort supreme all year three
[9118] Middle all year five
[9119] Last all year seven month eleven
[9120] Day six Dharma-nature cease appear see light body free
[9121] That-from
[9122] This-to effort great-small-by
[9123] Day and month year all-by
[9124] Individual time-to certain accomplish
[9125] Move very without time all-from
[9126] Individual measure-to reach indeed
[9127] Thus
[9128] This experience take secret essential-point great indeed
[9129] Third day night wheel manner determine four indeed
[9130] Continuum-to sense-organ essential-point-to gather memory door close
[9131] Dawn know object vase-in put wisdom directly clear
[9132] Morning wisdom clear-to demonstrate arise-feeling all self-place pure
[9133] Day appear vast-by strike
[9134] Sign all suppress indeed
[9135] This formerly also explain though
[9136] Here also leap-over companion-as explain summary experience take
[9137] Little former-and not-different distinction exist
[9138] Day time elephant gaze-by manifest-to look
[9139] Delusion-appear self-cease release sign suppress indeed
[9140] Night time bindu empty lamp-to cognition place
[9141] Bindu that expand time cognition-also clear portion expand
[9142] Decrease time cognition increasingly subtle go-from end reference without go state cognition reference think emanate gather without equipoise
[9143] Sleep-to go time forehead center-in bindu empty dissolve manner mind place having
[9144] Sleep-of luminosity essence seize
[9145] Midnight-at heart within-of luminosity-to mind hold having sleep by
[9146] Dream luminosity-to liberate having habit-continuum cease indeed
[9147] Then morning lion gaze by bow-span-of sky-to AH white one-to consciousness place by
[9148] Clear-empty elaboration-from free-of meaning within-from arise
[9149] That manner-in how-much abide meditate indeed
[9150] Six-Expanse from
[9151] Body-of posture press having
[9152] Consciousness sky-of range-to cast
[9153] Like-that eye indeed space-between-to
[9154] Elephant-of gaze by
[9155] Memory-without great-spreading great-as place
[9156] Like-that awareness sky-to place
[9157] This-from separate without indeed
[9158] Yogin continuum-by what meditate
[9159] Daytime appear expand-spread indeed
[9160] Nighttime self-of place house-in
[9161] Time four equal-of measure hold for
[9162] Sense-organ door all self-gather having
[9163] Bindu empty-of lamp-to
[9164] Yogin endowed mind place by
[9165] Bindu itself indeed expand time
[9166] Consciousness itself-also expand place
[9167] Like-that bindu subtle become time
[9168] Bindu increasingly-subtle increasingly-subtle-to
[9169] Consciousness increasingly-subtle increasingly-subtle place
[9170] Sleep-and dream essential-point by indeed
[9171] Before attachment habit-continuum root-from extract
[9172] This-like nighttime-of time all-in
[9173] Yogin fortune-with endowed act
[9174] This-by appear self-expand reach
[9175] Thus
[9176] Like-that day-night wheel-continuum-by experience take having
[9177] Delusion-appear self-cease luminosity-to liberate indeed
[9178] That-from
[9179] Body-and field-and awareness by
[9180] Self-appear pure-of measure all hold
[9181] Like-that self-appear measure grasp having
[9182] Six-classes delusion-of appear cease
[9183] That cease time-at
[9184] Awareness measure-to reach indeed
[9185] Like-that measure-to when reach time
[9186] Self-of body-also not-appear
[9187] Elements-by produced-of flesh-blood body
[9188] Elements self-place-at pure-of cause
[9189] This field-as appear-of cause
[9190] Delusion-by grasped-of mind-of body
[9191] Elements self-place-at dissolve-of cause
[9192] This-also not-appear self-place-at dissolve
[9193] Awareness-by grasped-of light-of body
[9194] Water-moon mandala like indeed
[9195] This time Dharma-nature cease-and near
[9196] This-in what familiar Buddha-field
[9197] Then body three limit exhaust having
[9198] Action-free perfect-of body obtain
[9199] This time body-of limit all-and
[9200] Free-of near indeed
[9201] Base-at familiar yogin-by
