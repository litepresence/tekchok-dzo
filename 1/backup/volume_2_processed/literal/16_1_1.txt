[4540] /golden bird from/
[4541] Who dharmakaya abiding manner
[4542] Person who body main-point
[4543] That with compatible who knows
[4544] This dharmakaya great-bliss in
[4545] Yogin pure makes
[4546] Thus it is said
[4547] Thus three-bodies postures done three-bodies intent from not-transgressing
[4548] That also nirmanakaya hunched future time asceticism relying liberating sign
[4549] Sambhogakaya elephant future time doing-without spontaneous-completion mode liberating sign
[4550] Dharmakaya lion future time genuine fearlessness liberating sign
[4551] Elemental body gaze three-bodies gaze into liberating what
[4552] Three-bodies luminous-clear self-in existing heart-in abiding
[4553] Gaze done self-in thus existing intent three manifest making
[4554] Three-bodies self-constituent existing self gaze three-bodies gaze into going
[4555] Body elemental cold greater nirmanakaya with harmonize cold-warm balanced
[4556] Hot greater dharmakaya with
[4557] Balanced sambhogakaya with harmonize auspicious
[4558] Particularly vision increasing swift
[4559] Body posture not-bend body channels heart-in awareness self-resonance existing not-arising that not-raise outer sky-in awareness vision not-dawn therefore gaze precious
[4560] Ordinary like abiding awareness actually dawning impossible
[4561] Dawn time ordinary abiding increase impossible moreover again decreasing gaze precious
[4562] That also snake limbs body-in existing though not-manifest bend manifest like gaze main-point from awareness dawning also thus
[4563] Then posture three alone determined one or
[4564] Two or
[4565] Three or else hundred-thousands etcetera become what meaningful
[4566] Sentient-beings all afflicting-three by three-realms into lead cause that from liberating cause therefore three determined
[4567] Afflicting-three from body speech mind three ripening-by also three determined
[4568] That also first samsara karma wheel from
[4569] Desire impure from form into ripening
[4570] Bird form emerged action and doer speech chief becoming
[4571] Body into ripening time also speech in delight
[4572] Object chief making desire great
[4573] Desire in delight one comes
[4574] That same pure path into taking cause
[4575] Sambhogakaya posture shown
[4576] Sentient-beings such supreme sambhogakaya posture always do
[4577] Dharmata meaning supreme expert
[4578] Also samsara wheel from delusion impure from form into ripening is pig emerged
[4579] That same latency producing sentient-beings mind chief form into ripening
[4580] This form into ripening time mind change many intellect change conceptuality great
[4581] Speech in not-delight
[4582] Always sleep in delight comes
[4583] That dharmakaya posture in always abide
[4584] Dharmata time three abide determined
[4585] Also first aversion impure from form ripening
[4586] Snake ripening body action chief form into emerging
[4587] This body action in delight moving-desire
[4588] Body strength great body coarse
[4589] Body grooming in delight body emerged
[4590] This nirmanakaya posture in always abide buddha determined
[4591] Therefore posture three determined
[4592] Sentient-beings destiny body speech mind three into emerged
[4593] Those binding from liberating cause therefore three alone determined
[4594] That from more not-needed
[4595] Few incomplete therefore three alone determined
[4596] This time speech main-point speech cutting
[4597] From Thalgyur
[4598] Speech training and abiding and
[4599] Swallowing firm making
[4600] Thus said
[4601] First speech training
[4602] Speaking less ordinary speech cutting short sessions train
[4603] Then long train
[4604] Occasionally speech cause none though alone speak
[4605] Abiding mantra and utterance etcetera virtuous utterance not-deny
[4606] Other and word syllable one also not-mix
[4607] This time body sign meaning understand cause
[4608] Swallowing mantra etcetera utterance all not-do
[4609] Firm what also not-utter state-from not-transgressing cause
[4610] Body sign only also not-do
[4611] From Seed Tantra
[4612] Speech like how mute like
[4613] Who and sign only not-do
[4614] Thus who done person
[4615] Mind projecting gathering self-cut
[4616] Thus it is said
[4617] Speech speaking cutting inexpressible meaning mind-in arising
[4618] Sentient-beings other and speech not-mixed body purified purpose existing
[4619] Body purified buddhas and bodhisattvas and
[4620] Sky-goers dakinis blessing-from body illusory-body liberating
[4621] Then object blocked speech purified sign non-human and sign meet conversation say come
[4622] Speech utterance blocked mind purified
[4623] That sign previously non-human form seeing and
[4624] Then clairvoyance dum-bu arise
[4625] Thus speech main-point body mind connection cutting main-point instruction
[4626] Mind main-point sky expanse eye gaze-from thought what not-think
[4627] From Thalgyur
[4628] Mind dhatu into placed accomplish
[4629] Thus it is said
[4630] Thus chief body speech two bound mind secondary caught dhatu-awareness dawning elements into binding cut
[4631] From Seed Tantra
[4632] Thus body speech three bound
[4633] Dharmadhatu vision in
[4634] This habituation becoming
[4635] Thus said and
[4636] Body and speech and mind main-point
[4637] Know and rely samsara-from liberate
[4638] Thus it is said
[4639] Meaning second main-point three relying direct self-point deliver three
[4640] Main-point three vajra seal bind
[4641] Direct awareness self-face introduce
[4642] That-from vision dawning manner show
[4643] First two
[4644] Main-point three general seal show and
[4645] Particular self main-point point deliver
[4646] First gate and field and wind-awareness main-point three
[4647] From Thalgyur
[4648] Main-point three instruction separate not-do
[4649] That also gate and field itself and
[4650] Wind and awareness main-point itself seal
[4651] Thus said
[4652] Example like main-point hit weapon similar
[4653] Body channels or meaning-heart etcetera main-point hit what done not-feel dying similar
[4654] Main-point three also dharmata change ground not-existing
[4655] Gate main-point by see cause
[4656] Field main-point by not-change cause
[4657] Wind-awareness main-point sign measure deliver
[4658] That also gate main-point threshold similar
[4659] Field main-point escort similar
[4660] Wind-awareness main-point bandit similar
[4661] Arrow hit desire person change power not-existing captured and
[4662] Enemy come bandit hand into not-enter impossible like
[4663] Dharmata direct main-point not-hit impossible
[4664] That also field not-existing basis ground not-existing
[4665] Gate not-existing beings path lost
[4666] Wind-awareness main-point not-existing knowing-awareness inside not-penetrate therefore main-point three determined
[4667] That from more limitless main-point lose
[4668] Few meaning not-accomplish therefore three determined
[4669] Second particular self main-point point deliver
[4670] Main-point three general sequence determine and
[4671] Individual main-point point deliver
[4672] First body speech mind three not-moving gate and field and wind-awareness bound
[4673] Seeing lineage scripture by differentiate
[4674] Self-arising awareness tantra from
[4675] Thus body etcetera
[4676] Main-point all fully press cause
[4677] Awareness itself and direct
[4678] Guru instruction from know
[4679] Thus said and
[4680] From Thalgyur
[4681] Actual main self mind rely
[4682] Body main-point and speech and also
[4683] Mind main-point relying cause
[4684] Wind what slow made
[4685] Fully project from arising
[4686] Body and mind connection cut that
[4687] Three-realms in also reverse not
[4688] Thus said and
[4689] Gate three-bodies eye by look
[4690] Field obscuration-doer separate
[4691] Wind-awareness slow by wisdom accomplish
[4692] Thus it is said
[4693] Second gate and
[4694] Field and
[4695] Wind-awareness main-point three from
[4696] First
[4697] Ordinary gaze manner wisdom not-dawn
[4698] Three-bodies gaze manner three train
[4699] Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra from
[4700] Dharmakaya gaze manner
[4701] Three-realms samsara press extract
[4702] Sambhogakaya samsara ground not-destroy
[4703] Nirmanakaya buddha-field into liberate
[4704] Thus said and
[4705] From Letterless
[4706] Eye sky element gaze
[4707] Thus said and
[4708] From Secret Sound Tantra
[4709] Lower reverse corner three
[4710] Gaze manner type three famous
[4711] Thus it is said
[4712] That-also nirmanakaya lower buddha disciples look
[4713] Sambhogakaya corner look buddha field-realm look and
[4714] Dharmakaya reverse buddha base look
[4715] Yogin eye faculty bad nirmanakaya gaze manner harmonize eye not-dim purpose existing
[4716] Eye fault possess sambhogakaya harmonize eye clear purpose existing
[4717] Eye faculty good dharmakaya mode harmonize swift vision measure arrive purpose existing
[4718] Those from not-move three-eyes within realize determined
[4719] Dharmakaya in dharmata eye existing speech in
[4720] That blessing wisdom actually seeing this same certain
[4721] Sambhogakaya in wisdom eye existing body in
[4722] That blessing self-clear seeing knowledge expands
[4723] Nirmanakaya in discriminating-awareness eye existing heart in
[4724] That blessing sound word separate seeing hearing contemplation meditation all dharmata meaning within dawns
[4725] That also three-eyes gaze dharmata eye up reverse latency down remove main-point
[4726] Wisdom corner equal gaze samsara-nirvana taste equal mix main-point
[4727] Discriminating-awareness lower look wisdom vision actually deliver main-point
[4728] Gaze manner three determine what
[4729] Lazy one sambhogakaya
[4730] Diligent one nirmanakaya
[4731] Equanimity one dharmakaya gaze manner auspicious therefore three determined
[4732] Definitive-meaning gaze dharmata gaze pure obscuration exhaust
[4733] Mode samsara-from liberating cause
[4734] Second field main-point outer dhatu field sky empty cloud separate
[4735] Inner dhatu field eyebrow-center treasure-spot gaze dhatu-vision blue and that-from arise five self-resonance
[4736] From Thalgyur
[4737] Dhatu outer and inner
[4738] Outer cloud-separate sky gaze
[4739] Dust rain remove time
[4740] Expert direct main-point press and
[4741] Inner lamp path make
[4742] Thus it is said
[4743] That also outer awareness dawning field
[4744] Inner experience increase field
[4745] Awareness and experience two not-existing-from samsara-nirvana mixed called
[4746] That-also earth water fire wind entity coarse field gaze not-liberate
[4747] First vision dawn not-desire
[4748] Later dawn definite coarse entity like knowing also that-with compatible arise emptiness thought not-existing experience within not-dawn
[4749] Sky empty awareness empty gaze cause
[4750] Field sky compatible experience empty clear radiating-gathering separate vast one dawn cause
[4751] Entity characteristic separate purpose existing
[4752] From Mind Section
[4753] Yogin sky bird-path abide
[4754] Thus said and
[4755] From Collection
[4756] Meaning that what sky-only gaze make
[4757] Thus said and
[4758] From Middle Mother
[4759] Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
[4760] Sky yogin making said etcetera scripture immeasurable
[4761] That-also field outer-inner mixed equal limitless view called
[4762] Dhatu-awareness non-dual view called
[4763] Dhatu-awareness mixed samsara-nirvana taste equal view called
[4764] This same Instruction-Child from also
[4765] Dhatu and awareness gaze manner
[4766] Obscuration-doer separate sky-like
[4767] Thus spoken
[4768] Third wind-awareness main-point
[4769] Field and gate two meet time wind slow rely awareness capture called
[4770] That-also wind somehow slow outer far shoot outer hold place main-point
[4771] That also wind and slow cause
[4772] Outer yogin life extend helper become
[4773] Inner conceptuality cease cause make and
[4774] Secret awareness direct seeing action do
[4775] Actual contaminated not-seeing buddha make cause
[4776] That thus also from Thalgyur
[4777] Wind what slow make
[4778] Fully project from arising cause
[4779] Body and mind connection cut that
[4780] Three-realms in also reverse not
[4781] Thus said and
[4782] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[4783] Fully project from arising cause
[4784] Body and mind connection cut that
[4785] Three-realms in also reverse not
[4786] Thus said and
[4787] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[4788] Thus it is said
[4789] Awareness main-point hanging-cord dhatu fence place not-move make
[4790] That same from
[4791] Self-face awareness hanging-cord
[4792] Going-coming separate sky capture
[4793] Thus said and
[4794] From Instruction-Child
[4795] Dhatu inside hanging-cord
[4796] Place arrange separate not-do
[4797] Thus it is said
[4798] That-also wind slow rely action separate meaning mind-in arise
[4799] Awareness hanging-cord forehead gaze cause conceptuality source exhaust-from
[4800] Delusion base return wisdom mother-son meet
[4801] Awareness wind separate-from going-coming not-existing awareness self-arisen enter
[4802] That also guide cause body main-point rely days five-six do
[4803] Then gate practice that much only do
[4804] Then field seek days six seven make
[4805] Then direct self-point deliver experience take
[4806] That very purified meditation knowing arise
[4807] Other wrong not-wrong cause vision flickering see
[4808] Faith not-existing guide finish time what say not-thing divination various arise near therefore thus not-gone pure make
[4809] That general guide great-this apply time preliminary measure arrive diligence with purify cause actual main faith ordinary not-existing arise
[4810] Actual main point-deliver hit direct delight special arise
[4811] Subsequent support dharma end cut explain cause experience practice maintain capable know-from doubt and conceptuality end dharma other mind not-desire purpose existing
[4812] Second direct awareness self-face introduce
[4813] Awareness vajra hanging-cord golden thread sky hovering like dhatu luminous-clear vision with this not-deluded buddha pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance
[4814] State look cause concept-doer all pure elaboration-free sky-like resonance within dawn cause
[4815] Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom meet-face
[4816] First Samantabhadra capacity equal
[4817] This habituation measure arrive stone-with light liberating
[4818] Not-arrive also bardo or nature emanation field traverse
[4819] Six-realms delusion precipice cut
[4820] Thus introduce and
[4821] From Self-Arising Instruction
[4822] Thus who see person
[4823] First Samantabhadra and
[4824] Capacity itself equal
[4825] Thus said and
[4826] From Thalgyur
[4827] Hanging-cord nature
[4828] Conceptuality all pure cause
[4829] Not-deluded base buddha
[4830] Thus it is said
[4831] Third that-from vision dawning manner show
[4832] Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning and
[4833] Hanging-cord point tiny bind and
[4834] First white pure star scatter like from
[4835] Point color five possess and
[4836] Each-one and
[4837] Three-bind interval vision until that
[4838] Previous from
[4839] Then point see
[4840] Thus it is said
[4841] That-also outer luminous-clear look cause inner conceptuality separate equal limitless liberate
[4842] Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance and
[4843] Spontaneous-completion light-resonance two outer-inner pair connect cause
[4844] Dhatu-awareness gathering-separate not-existing intent called
[4845] Third vision four dawning sequence two
[4846] Essence briefly show and
[4847] Nature extensively explain
[4848] First
[4849] Vision four all time body posture abide
[4850] Eye gaze manner gaze
[4851] Wind-awareness mode slow three main-point harmonize
[4852] Particularly vision first two purify later two effort rely mode purify
[4853] Luminous-clear liberate therefore dhatu-awareness non-dual called
[4854] These main-point awareness vajra hanging-cord separate not-do main-point arise
[4855] That meaning explain
[4856] Awareness essence nature compassion three not-differentiable base-abide and that resonance light channel pure vision from golden thread like coil curve interval point bind
[4857] Vajra buddhas sentient-beings all essence good-bad not-existing equal unchanging abide part place
[4858] Lu example water channel good from water increase decrease not-existing emerge similar
[4859] Body and wisdom increase opening various path-vision complete until that from dawning cause
[4860] Gu that inside dharmata not-mistaken view and meditation pull cause
[4861] Rgyud samsara-nirvana pervade vision those collections from
[4862] Body and
[4863] Point radiate and
[4864] Arise and
[4865] Gather etcetera clear cause
[4866] From Thalgyur
[4867] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[4868] That-from vision four become
[4869] Dharmata direct vision cause
[4870] Intellect grasp view suppress
[4871] Experience-vision above increase cause
[4872] Delusion vision cease cause
[4873] Awareness measure arrive vision cause
[4874] Three-bodies realize path-vision transcend
[4875] Dharmata exhaust vision cause
[4876] Three-realms samsara stream cut
[4877] Thus it is said
[4878] That-also vision four number determine outer sun-moon time four increase decrease and
[4879] Inner body speech mind four binding-from liberate and
[4880] Secret empowerment four determination show and
[4881] Actual lamp four vision determine rely four determine
[4882] Sequence determine
[4883] First base dharmata direct not-see remaining three dawning base not-existing basis and supported base first dharmata direct vision dawning
[4884] That same dawn cause dharmas all meaning see self-arisen wisdom self-from find called
[4885] Then direct that experience not-experience word only fruit not-arise cause
[4886] Meaning experience cause that experience above increase arise
[4887] Thus experience arisen measure firm make need
[4888] Not-firm experience end not-existing dharmas possess not-existing and
[4889] Buddha expand cause not-arise cause
[4890] Experience firm measure arrive cause
[4891] Awareness measure arrive vision arise
[4892] Awareness vision measure arrive though that-from other not-change three-bodies fruit desire difference not-existing
[4893] Actual vision mark dharmas fruit meaning hope ordinary and difference not-existing cause
[4894] Vision experience base dissolve
[4895] Subtle coarse vision holding cease-from
[4896] Pure dharmata exhaust experience dharmata exhaust vision arise
[4897] Those also first two nirmanakaya
[4898] Measure arrive sambhogakaya
[4899] Exhaust dharmakaya vision path make three-bodies path-vision dawn fruit dharmata exhaust pure dhatu arrive cause
[4900] Self-vision potency three-bodies awareness mode dissolve cause
[4901] Awareness pure fruit

[5156] Second vision manner particular explain
[5157] Wisdom five color vision and
[5158] Shape vision two from
[5159] First
[5160] Vajra family fully purify cause

[5221] That beyond experience above increase vision
[5222] From Thalgyur
[5223] Color five light also
[5224] Victory-banner only boat-part vision
[5225] Field boat-only see measure
[5226] Thus said and

[5235] Heap same
[5236] Outer vision cease whatever
[5237] Moment sixteen
[5238] This also thus become
[5239] Thus it is said
[5240] Third awareness measure arrive vision vision manner general show and
[5241] Nature particular explain two from
[5242] First
[5243] Then point each-in body half each dawn nirmanakaya purify fully purify cause arise
[5244] Then body self only each dawn nirmanakaya vision dharmata direct see cause arise
[5245] Then body those father-mother five five become sambhogakaya wisdom measure arrive itself
[5246] Then individual heap mandala with vision

[5248] Dharmakaya purification fully pure measure arrive cause arise
[5249] This awareness measure-arrive vision
[5250] Preliminary time body action and
[5251] Do those connection measure later not arise sign
[5252] That-also purify object defilement each purify antidote preliminary etc. vital arrive cause vision those dawn although separation result and purify-object purify-agent cause-effect designate merely
[5253] That produce-from arise not

[5265] Thus
[5266] Second nature particular explain to
[5267] Measure-arrive definition general explain and
[5268] Measure three particular explain two from
[5269] First awareness measure-arrive by-saying
[5270] Awareness basis-abide awareness manifest become
[5271] Path enter-from

[5277] Those moon full form like
[5278] Waxing increase cease-from mandala complete self-essence fabricate-not-exist
[5279] Second measure three particular explain to three
[5280] Outer vision
[5281] Inner body measure
[5282] Secret awareness measure
[5283] First
[5284] Vision control lands light-clear complete
[5285] Thal 'gyur from
[5286] Thus arrive-from complete measure
[5287] Direct entity-vision cease and
[5288] Earth stone vision melt and
[5289] Self-know whatever enter and
[5290] That enter inert move and
[5291] Wind move measure grasp and

[5298] Go and come and sit vision
[5299] All awareness measure-arrive
[5300] Thus
[5301] Second
[5302] Body dust purify-from heart center-to white A from light-ray five coil heart-window sun-reflection like intermediate-space light star-window inside dawn pierce

[5311] Compassion door-from clairvoyance six sets and
[5312] Dharma all know wisdom dawn
[5313] Pure wisdom door-from Buddha field pure self-vision Sambhogakaya complete and
[5314] Mind defilement pure and dust doubt separation itself obtain-from
[5315] Ground and ground latencies self-pure Thal 'gyur from
[5316] Measure-arrive body also thus become
[5317] Individual body dust free-from
[5318] Intermediate-space light star-window vision
[5319] Then light-ray hook shape
[5320] Subtle and coil-through vision hold
[5321] Body dust self-cease-from
[5322] Copper-shining stainless light body
[5323] Center-in A mark and

[5331] This time self-body measure-to arrive
[5332] Copper-shining body three one coil
[5333] Thus
[5334] Third secret awareness measure
[5335] Subtle coarse move mind pure although
[5336] All-ground consciousness only mind exist
[5337] Awareness quality clairvoyance and eye-attachment not-exist dawn
[5338] That itself from

[5350] Thus
[5351] That-also vision above two-to affliction-mind and mind-consciousness defilement manifest become purify-from
[5352] This obtain time collections eight first seven pure-from

[5453] Exhaust is empty
[5454] Mind meditation object vision together self-reverse-from not-exist
[5455] Not observe by-say
[5456] That itself from
[5457] Thus dharmata certain definition
[5458] Dharma know aggregate gather-to

[5466] Thus
[5467] Nature
[5468] Outer inner vision mind exhaust sky blue-grey resonance like primordially-pure self-resonance merely-to activity
[5469] Rtsal rdzogs from
[5470] This time exhaust characteristic
[5471] Action-free sky like thus
[5472] Thus
[5473] Dharmata-to two-from
[5474] Vision dharmata
[5475] Outer inner dust together exhaust-from channel wind exhaust
[5476] That exhaust-from mind-to depend latency all-from arise characteristic defilement subtle seed part those also exhaust
[5477] Continuity samadhi-to abide-through dharmata wheel-from not pass
[5478] Eye and clairvoyance great control-through realms three dharma king regent-to power obtain
[5479] All-ground subtle knowable obscuration very cut white silk curtain merely-by cut except obscuration not-exist-from
[5480] Path dharma exhaust result by-say
[5481] That clear-from Buddha obscuration all separate-from inner expanse primordially-pure dharmakaya-to enter very peace
[5482] Thal 'gyur from
[5483] Self-Buddha cease dharmata
[5484] Element cease-from dust cease
[5485] Dust and particle end cease-from
[5486] Part merely also abide not
[5487] Affliction cease-from delusion and
[5488] Concept-free attachment not abide-from
[5489] Latency and all-from arise
[5490] Dust part merely also not abide
[5491] Thus subtle coarse cease-from
[5492] Aggregate five also end gradual subtle
[5493] Element four body exhaust-from
[5494] All wisdom Sambhogakaya
[5495] Concept-free samadhi self-abide
[5496] Fabricate aggregate-from exceed-from
[5497] Dharma by-say word-to not abide
[5498] Thus
[5499] Empty dharmata
[5500] Channel wind coarse exhaust-from mind mental-events exhaust
[5501] Body and wisdom vision aspect measure-arrive moon full like-also inner expanse-to set-from primordially-pure vision-to abide-from
[5502] Dharmakaya vision core result dharmata self-vision by-say express
[5503] Again before from
[5504] Cause and result dharmata
[5505] Conceptuality coarse source cease-from

[5513] Result dharmata is think
[5514] Thus
[5515] That-also word later this three-to delusion-from
[5516] Result primordially-pure-to body and wisdom not-exist think Nyingtigpa arise-from
[5517] That error great
[5518] Outer vision resonance body and wisdom crystal light inward return like part-to thus say that intention not understand merely
[5519] Meaning-to inner expanse-to not-exist spontaneous-accomplishment contradict and
[5520] Unconditioned is-from future not-exist completely perish-to go contradict and
[5521] Again expanse-from body and wisdom dawn basis-from beings benefit arise contradict and
[5522] Samantabhadra basis expanse pure end arrive-from beings and Buddha-to path show compassion and action show contradict etc. fault many exist-from
[5523] Fault such accept suitable not
[5524] Fifth boundary
[5525] Measure-arrive curtain-from exhaust begin time self hand foot four finger light five clear merely exist-from
[5526] Occasion this-from inner expanse-to outward enter and
[5527] Outer vision-to inward return boundary exist
[5528] That-also body form that now beings benefit actual extensive not arise
[5529] Finger light-to awareness focus-from
[5530] Outer vision and
[5531] Self body light-clear all inner expanse-to increasingly dissolve-to go
[5532] Direct entity-vision blue pure merely-from
[5533] Light body-to fade crystal light inward dissolve like
[5534] Body and vision self-resonance also reverse
[5535] Inner clear spontaneously-accomplish jewel shell-in body and wisdom depth resonance merely-to awareness abide
[5536] Outer vision blue-in vision part merely also not-exist crystal mirror self-lucid-to shadow like abide
[5537] Awareness dharmakaya-to Buddha coiled
[5538] Outer vision-to inward return body that Buddha action equal not accomplish sign
[5539] That-also birth and enter control-from awareness beings-to compassion focus-from whatever not-exist primordially-pure vision that self-reverse-from
[5540] Delusion vision vision this mirror reflection like vision
[5541] Self body that also water moon like wisdom illusion body-to self-vision copper-shining-from element harm separate vajra body obtain
[5542] Beings benefit-to transfer great body arise by-say
[5543] Other eye not-pure-from dust together merely-from copper-shining-to not see
[5544] Master great Vimala and
[5545] Padma like
[5546] Then birth and enter two control obtain-from
[5547] Momentary Buddha although delay exist
[5548] Beings benefit samsara not empty until do although self-power possess
[5549] Birth control
[5550] Inner expanse-to enter occasion beings three-thousand-to awareness enter all time one-to free power great obtain
[5551] Insects also light-to cease
[5552] Birth control obtain-from whatever desire emanate-from beings benefit spontaneously-accomplish do
[5553] Enter control
[5554] Inert-to awareness enter although move and sound make do
[5555] Lotus and wishing tree and jewel etc.-from dharma sound arise-from beings all ripen and
[5556] Food clothes rain make do
[5557] That-also birth and enter control this two exhaust follow inner expanse-to enter occasion not-there obtain-from
[5558] Beings benefit-to inward not return bardo beings three-thousand instantaneous free make-from expanse-to enter
[5559] Do birth control-from inward return gradual three-thousand free make-from
[5560] Birth enter many kalpa field dust number-to beings benefit whatever do
[5561] Earth treasure and
[5562] Jewel and
[5563] Dharma classification etc.-from time long some benefit accomplish although that means-to momentary also pass not-exist-from
[5564] Other-from compassion wonder arise and activity vision enter cause
[5565] Our guru holy Vimala and Padmakara very sublime such rely those this or bardo without-doubt free certain
[5566] Manner these secret conduct seed tantra from
[5567] Inner body exhaust ground arrive time
[5568] Finger etc. thus vision
[5569] This focus element self cease
[5570] Birth and enter difference-by
[5571] Dharma all exhaust self ground-to
[5572] What also hold not
[5573] Abide is emanation body
[5574] This-by enter power control
[5575] Birth self-power who obtain
[5576] That also that-to focus-from
[5577] Again time thus do time
[5578] Vision self-sound rustling
[5579] Manifest reverse delusion vision
[5580] This-by beings benefit all do
[5581] Awareness equal one cause
[5582] Thousand three beings
[5583] Transfer great this accomplish
[5584] Thus gradual and instantaneous
[5585] Body this-by accomplish
[5586] That all body exhaust measure-from free
[5587] This all result certain
[5588] Ground supreme mandala great accomplish
[5589] Thus
[5590] Thus vision four dawn that also path arise sequence by-say
[5591] Example ladder rung like
[5592] That also path abide part-from dawn agent not cease
[5593] Path obtain part-from what also not establish not-exist
[5594] Thus vision four measure arrive-from this itself contaminated not vision Buddha-from
[5595] Vehicle common those-from especially sublime-from
[5596] Dharma this meet-from diligence practice do-to effort do
[5597] That itself-to
[5598] Buddha accomplish desire person-by
[5599] This means possess thus thus
[5600] Other conduct pride do itself is-from
[5601] Entity see not
[5602] That cause this all rare word
[5603] Always jewel treasure this look
[5604] Thus
[5605] Meaning four extreme rely instruction four above those support back support or closely arise
[5606] That also unmoving three speech-to basis establish
[5607] Vow three measure hold
[5608] Obtain three nail strike
[5609] Confidence four free measure show those
[5610] Thal 'gyur from
[5611] That-to extreme rely faith do
[5612] Unmoving three-to basis establish-from
[5613] Wind mind vital-to arrive
[5614] Abide three measure hold-from
[5615] Dream reverse and body speech mind
[5616] Sign and measure certain hold
[5617] Obtain three nail strike-from
[5618] Contaminated aggregate not vision
[5619] Thus and
[5620] Mu tig phreng ba from
[5621] Measure is confidence four yogin itself
[5622] Thus
[5623] First unmoving three-by basis establish-from nirvana basis seal
[5624] Body unmoving three-by vital press and
[5625] Speech unmoving three-by path clear and
[5626] Mind unmoving three-by gorge wrap coil
[5627] First body unmoving three-to

[5828] Habituation special become cause arise
[5829] Great perfection momentary quick do measure mind life-to enter
[5830] Very elaboration all near cease-from not-exist-from power
[5831] This also example faith-to meaning connection cut
[5832] That also body basis is element four bind free do cause arise-from
[5833] Now element self continuum-to return not possible vital
[5834] Speech four is express basis
[5835] Express condition
[5836] Express object
[5837] Express agent four bind-from free-from
[5838] Now express word self continuum-to speak not possible
[5839] Mind four
[5840] Memory
[5841] Memory not
[5842] Arise not
[5843] Mind exceed four bind-from free
[5844] Now memory think object wheel-to enter not possible
[5845] Thus sign body-to dawn
[5846] Essence speech-to know
[5847] Confidence mind-to correct
[5848] Measure dream-by catch
[5849] Diligence sequence-by
[5850] Great-to dream completely cease
[5851] Habituation great cause arise-from action latency-by benefit harm not

[5853] Latency good bad conceptuality not-exist
[5854] Low dream good-to become is latency pure taste one-from abandon antidote cause effect action-to avoid need
[5855] Thus abide three
[5856] Mu tig phreng from
[5857] Pure expanse is abide and
[5858] Thus awareness essence abide
[5859] Vision all abide
[5860] Thus
[5861] Third obtain three nail strike
[5862] Outer vision-to power obtain-from vision condition field realm-to free
[5863] Inner illusion body-to power obtain-from dust together luminosity-to free
[5864] Secret awareness-to power obtain-from wind mind delusion exhaust
[5865] Meaning result-to power obtain-to near by-say
[5866] Again that itself from

[5868] Luminosity dawn-from subtle coarse cease
[5869] Expanse awareness dawn-from object mind cease
[5870] Thus
[5871] Fourth confidence four free measure hold
[5872] Hell hot cold suffering see or hear although fear dread not confidence and
[5873] Buddha quality hear although obtain hope and excitement not self place body three complete confidence and
[5874] Action affliction cause result hear although delusion vision samsara fall fear not-from cause result repeat confidence and
[5875] Nirvana self place see although free hope joy not-from primordially-pure self complete certain ground obtain confidence and four arise
[5876] Rinpoche spungs pa tantra from
[5877] Not change view confidence great four-by
[5878] Not return wisdom measure also hold
[5879] Thus
[5880] Thus extreme rely four addition-to
[5881] Vision sixteen-by conclusion gather
[5882] Vision and
[5883] Increase and
[5884] Obtain and
[5885] Near obtain four set each vision four-to enter-from
[5886] Ground sixteen vision complete
