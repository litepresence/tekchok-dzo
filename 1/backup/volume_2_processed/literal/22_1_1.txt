[13160] Eighth common not-is realm other show two
[13161] Yogin-of death-manner general show and
[13162] Elements dissolve manner difference explain
[13163] First faculty inferior middle and superior become death-manner three-from
[13164] Inferior above taught like world and accord die
[13165] Sick time also diviner and
[13166] Doctor and
[13167] Service various do supreme dharma truth characteristics not-see sign is and
[13168] Divination and ritual and medicine and astrology hope tirthika and difference not
[13169] Then die time also relatives and circle students and friends surround die
[13170] Die after also virtue and grief and lament do and
[13171] Seven-sections and corpse cremate etcetera do
[13172] Karma first-of ordinary those-of death-manner from
[13173] Dharma-of part even not-exist ordinary those and same
[13174] Middle and superior those thus examine
[13175] Thus not-die if meaning-of yogin not-is
[13176] That-to deer and
[13177] Lion and
[13178] Beggar and
[13179] Child like die four yogin middle-of death-manner
[13180] Condition without die like attached those solitude-to die
[13181] Example deer kill that human not-go cave or
[13182] Valley empty or
[13183] Forest edge or
[13184] Wilderness hermitage-to die like
[13185] Yogin that anyone see not die any-to fear from free sign
[13186] Beggar like die
[13187] Example beggar who is distinction not hole or
[13188] Market street or crossroads or shop etcetera-to die like
[13189] Yogin that also thus die realm-of attachment cease dharma-of sphere use sign
[13190] Also child all die not-die distinction not state-to die like
[13191] Yogin that also delusion some-from calculate not
[13192] Die condition and die place and die to fear and not-die joy also not ordinary just pass like die delusion-of appearance cease sign
[13193] Superior those-of death-manner
[13194] Sky-goer and
[13195] Knowledge-holder and
[13196] Fire-heap and
[13197] Sky like death-manner four-from
[13198] Yogin diligence superior this same aggregates not-exist depart is sky-goer die time corpse anyone not-see and same
[13199] Bardo not-exist buddha sign
[13200] Yogin supreme one other teach purpose-to people all see space light-heap center-in sound and light include vanish
[13201] Knowledge-holder those realm above-from above-to leap time aggregates include space-to sound and light include all see go like
[13202] Continent thought-not-pervade emanation thought-not-pervade-by benefit do sign
[13203] Yogin power lord great Lhetsun Lion-power like
[13204] Yogin practice end reach death-manner
[13205] Example cause fuel-wood finish-by fire-heap great exist those also self finish-from die like
[13206] Cause elements finish-by condition aggregates-of lump not-exist go is afflictions self-from liberate sign
[13207] Example Tsari holy Dgyer Mi Majo two cave-from light-heap-to blaze space-to go like
[13208] Yogin primordial-pure realm dust particle body-of vase break time before-after not one-in mix
[13209] Sky like death-manner
[13210] Body appear-of interval substance separate cut space and like
[13211] Realization primordial-pure body within heart-of light-clear abide and
[13212] Pot break-by outer space and pot-of space mix which is not-know like
[13213] Body-of dust particle departed aggregates this is and that-of within awareness this is not-know buddha
[13214] This primordial-pure realm sudden-through liberate sign
[13215] That-to sky and sky-goer-of death-manner two body-of dust particle departed primordial-pure break-through liberate death-manner is and
[13216] Fire-heap and knowledge-holder two leap-through spontaneous liberate death-manner
[13217] Death-manner thus who-from arise
[13218] Nature great-perfection-to faith sign common tradition year not-enter and
[13219] That same-of meaning enter sign direct meaning see-by intellect word purpose not-depend and
[13220] Primordial-pure-of realization enter-by self-of next migration place which is face know and
[13221] Die to difficulty and fear not life accomplish and die deceive service any not do and
[13222] Natural-state action-effort from free confidence obtain-by door three-of action any not do and
[13223] All basis not-exist primordial-emptiness great realize-by any-to entity characteristics-grasp from free nature-of state-from moment even not-separate meaning vast-expanse from arise
[13224] Thus yogin those-to death examine and
[13225] Deceive and
[13226] Clarify not need
[13227] View-meditation from surpass dharma-by benefit-harm not and
[13228] Self-appear primordial-pure and spontaneous arise-by liberation place self-nature as appear
[13229] Spontaneous primordial-pure-of expanse-into dissolve-from liberate because
[13230] Thus also
[13231] Sun-Moon-face-union from
[13232] Yogin this thus examine
[13233] Inferior faculty inferior
[13234] Existence bardo-to spread continue
[13235] Example rooster-cut like
[13236] Like-that faculty middle those
[13237] Deer like death-manner
[13238] Yogin death-manner
[13239] Like-that lion like and
[13240] Who beggar like and
[13241] Like-that child like die
[13242] Yogin middle-of die place
[13243] Who sky-goer death-manner and
[13244] Like-that knowledge-holder death-manner and
[13245] Fire-heap like self finish and
[13246] Not-see sky garuda like and
[13247] This all elements self finish
[13248] Not-see not-take thus
[13249] Yogin self-of sphere
[13250] This-to habituation-of self-momentum obtain
[13251] Die time this know-by
[13252] Body mind transference-of characteristics know
[13253] Thus abide yogin-to
[13254] Die condition permanent and impermanent not
[13255] Like-that fear all free and
[13256] Body-of attachment extreme also free
[13257] View itself and meditation-by also
[13258] Yogin possess-to benefit-harm free
[13259] Benefit free harm-of fruit not-exist-by
[13260] This-to abide sphere also not
[13261] Cause and effect-of ripening free
[13262] Therefore this-to habituation supreme
[13263] Self-arise self-liberate birth-not-exist expanse
[13264] Time not-change appear change
[13265] Spontaneous primordial-pure expanse-into dissolve
[13266] Hope fear two-of extreme from free
[13267] Cause effect two-of extreme finish-from
[13268] Sphere awareness two-not-exist primordial-pure expanse
[13269] Therefore this meaning realize-by sufficient
[13270] Do-not spontaneous great-perfection
[13271] Thus
[13272] Second elements dissolve manner difference explain two
[13273] Condition sudden by die bodhisattva breath transference manner and
[13274] Condition force sudden not gradual transference
[13275] First
[13276] Collapse and fire and water and cliff and weapon-by sudden sudden die those-to
[13277] Elements gradual dissolve trace not awareness transference
[13278] Karma bad those birth door bad-to enter and
[13279] Good those good migration-to birth and
[13280] This-of meditation see-from purified small those bliss possess see lineage supreme or nature emanation-to born
[13281] Second
[13282] Outer elements inner elements-to dissolve
[13283] Inner five secret five-to dissolve
[13284] Secret five perfectly complete elements five-to dissolve-from
[13285] Light-clear dharma-nature-of path great-to enter
[13286] First outer elements
[13287] Body-of part earth water fire wind space five
[13288] Appearance hold produce-by outer called sign
[13289] Outer appear object-of element form-to not-say
[13290] Body-of coarse-of elements five each-to dissolve manner also two
[13291] Outer elements inner elements-to dissolve and
[13292] Inner elements outer elements-to dissolve
[13293] First
[13294] Die time-of first elements five each-of power before like not
[13295] Earth earth-to dissolve-by power lose
[13296] Water water-to dissolve-by moist contract
[13297] Fire fire-to dissolve-by heat small
[13298] Wind wind-to dissolve-by breath draw difficult
[13299] Space space-to dissolve-by consciousness clear lose-from memory not clear
[13300] Second also outer inner two-from
[13301] Outer elements four
[13302] Inner elements first outer elements-to dissolve and
[13303] Very clear secret elements-to dissolve-from
[13304] First five-of first outer elements
[13305] Inner earth five outer earth five-to dissolve-by body-of power lose memory decline
[13306] Water five water-to dissolve-by body-of water drip silk moment nose mouth dry eye upward turn
[13307] Fire five fire-to dissolve-by body-of heat rise memory cease lamp not-see
[13308] Wind five wind-to dissolve-by body-of luster not and breath rough from silk moment-in cease
[13309] Then inner elements dissolve manner
[13310] Space five sphere awareness-to dissolve time-to face grasp
[13311] Then inner elements very clear five secret elements-to dissolve manner
[13312] Elements five-of part very subtle life-to dissolve-by
[13313] Life five heart center-of awareness-to enter
[13314] Light-channel and
[13315] That-of hollow space and
[13316] Drop and
[13317] Light five-of self-body awareness light-of mansion possess-to dissolve
[13318] Then secret elements five first life-wind-in abide those perfectly complete elements great basis-appear awareness-of self-resound heart-in light-power self-nature as awareness light-of mansion possess
[13319] Light end not object possess
[13320] Lamp four-of appearance with include-from

[13329] That also awareness-of wisdom-to clear dim not although power outward appear not able-by awareness latent
[13330] Fire fire-to dissolve time primordial-from self-of awareness wisdom essence-as abide although
[13331] Time that wind inner-to enter-by power outward appear not able
[13332] Wind wind-to dissolve time awareness power complete-by object-to not abide-by

[13337] That body inner-of basis-appear spontaneous-of part that time this bardo called
[13338] Elements five lump with there dissolve and
[13339] Awareness inner clear self-ground-in abide interval is because
[13340] Therefore body-to abide time heart inner power rely dharma-nature-of self-resound that body-from eye-to path arise emerge-by
