[658] Thus, having established elements' nature as basis,
[659] Now, the supported's fourfold purity: expanse and wisdom:
[660] Basis: kayas,
[661] Tone: light,
[662] Supported: wisdom,
[663] Activities: enlightened actions.
[664] First, basis-kayas' extensive division has two parts:
[665] Three kayas' expanse general presentation, and
[666] Five kayas' enumeration particular explanation.
[667] The first has: kayas' definition brief presentation, and
[668] Place extensive explanation.
[669] The first is:
[670] Though essence is one, three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects—
[671] From Self-Arisen:
[672] Three kayas, wisdom-appearance,
[673] Without obstruction to anything,
[674] Perceived objects being one,
[675] Essence appearing individually.
[676] Thus it is said.
[677] This is awareness-itself's appearance manner:
[678] From that same source:
[679] Thought-free awareness is dharmakaya's essence,
[680] Uncensored clear awareness is sambhogakaya,
[681] Whatever-appearing awareness is nirmanakaya.
[682] Thus it is said.
[683] In this, complete,
[684] Awakened.
[685] From threefold expansion:
[686] Completion is this:
[687] From Self-Arisen,
[688] In three kayas' pure appearance,
[689] One complete, two complete, all complete—
[690] Wisdom-appearing, unceasing and clear,
[691] Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating,
[692] In concept-free awareness, pure,
[693] Five light-rays, unceasing and clear,
[694] In non-grasping great self-liberation,
[695] Outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.
[696] In action-released awareness,
[697] Actor and acted, all dharmas complete in single moment.
[698] In mind-separated awareness,
[699] All appearance variety complete in single moment.
[700] In self-appearance's great clear purity,
[701] Deluded appearances complete in single moment.
[702] In great self-liberated self-appearance,
[703] Other-arisen dharmas complete in single moment.
[704] Such is three kayas' completion manner.
[705] Thus it is said.
[706] Awakening is being without dualistic-grasping aspect—
[707] From that same nature:
[708] Without action, delusion awakens,
[709] Without concept, afflictions awaken,
[710] Without grasping, self-arising awakens,
[711] Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens,
[712] Without attachment, ignorance awakens.
[713] Such is three kayas' awakening manner.
[714] Thus it is said.
[715] By expansion is meant this:
[716] Qualities, primordially spontaneously accomplished, are expansive—
[717] From Self-Arisen,
[718] In concept-free awareness,
[719] Five lights clear, wisdom expansive,
[720] In actor-acted-separated awareness,
[721] Without perceived object, three kayas expand,
[722] In object-free appearing awareness,
[723] Without grasping mind, five lights expand,
[724] In awareness, great wisdom,
[725] Meaning-possessing self-appearance, fruit expands.
[726] Such is three kayas' expansion manner.
[727] Thus it is said.
[728] Second: place expansive explanation.
[729] Dharmakaya,
[730] Sambhogakaya,
[731] Nirmanakaya—three places' expansive explanations.
[732] The first also has:
[733] Essence,
[734] Definition,
[735] Self-body,
[736] Metaphor,
[737] Sign,
[738] Appearance,
[739] Place,
[740] Characteristic,
[741] Object,
[742] Intent—ten in total.
[743] Essence is this:
[744] Empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence—
[745] From that same nature:
[746] Unchanging, cessation without, three-pervading—
[747] Dharmakaya essence.
[748] Thus it is said.
[749] Definition is this:
[750] Expanse, primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya being—essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion—
[751] Naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding—
[752] From that same nature:
[753] Fearless, empty, and clear,
[754] All actions complete—
[755] This is dharmakaya's definition.
[756] Thus it is said.
[757] Self-body is this:
[758] Freed from all elaboration extremes, without anywhere accomplishment—
[759] From Self-Arisen:
[760] Without outer, without inner, without within expanse—
[761] This is dharmakaya's self-body.
[762] Thus it is said.
[763] Metaphor is this:
[764] Like sun through clear-light awareness;
[765] Like ocean through depth;
[766] Like lotus, unstained by defects;
[767] Like mountain, unchanging;
[768] Like space, vast without boundary or center;
[769] Like lion, possessing from primordial the confidence surpassing all—
[770] From that same nature:
[771] Sun, ocean, lotus,
[772] Mountain, space, lion—three:
[773] These are dharmakaya's metaphors.
[774] Thus it is said.
[775] Transcending going and coming is the sign—
[776] From Self-Arisen:
[777] Without going, without coming, without abiding—
[778] This is dharmakaya's self-sign.
[779] Thus it is said.
[780] Appearance is like sky-expanse's empty-clarity—
[781] From that same nature:
[782] Unceasing, clear tone, empty by essence—
[783] This is dharmakaya's appearance.
[784] Thus it is said.
[785] Place is great pure memory-thought—
[786] From that:
[787] Without limit, without object, without grasping—
[788] This is dharmakaya's place.
[789] Thus it is said.
[790] Characteristic is this:
[791] Essence, nature, compassion—three inseparable—
[792] From that same nature:
[793] Essence, nature, compassion—three:
[794] This is dharmakaya's characteristic.
[795] Thus it is said.
[796] Object is self-clear awareness, empty without extremity cut,
[797] Five lights adorned within, spontaneously accomplished self-tone,
[798] In expanse-awareness great inseparability, aspects individually unmixed—
[799] From Self-Arisen:
[800] Clear, luminous, unmixed—three:
[801] This is dharmakaya's object.
[802] Thus it is said.
[803] Intent is this:
[804] View unsevered by direction or side,
[805] Meditation not established as entity or sign,
[806] Conduct transcending both apprehending and grasping—
[807] Spontaneously accomplished, primordially liberated—great fruition,
[808] Primordially established, all meanings complete—enlightened activity.
[809] Unsought, self-abiding excellence-qualities indeed—
[810] Moreover from that same nature:
[811] Free from cessation, free from fixation, free from attachment—
[812] This is dharmakaya's conduct.
[813] Crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering—
[814] This is dharmakaya's meditation.
[815] Unseen, seeing-complete—view perfected—
[816] This is dharmakaya's view.
[817] Unmade, unarisen, free from arising—
[818] This is dharmakaya's fruition.
[819] Nothing to accomplish, accomplished-complete—accomplishment perfected—
[820] This is dharmakaya's enlightened activity.
[821] One arisen, two arisen, all arise—
[822] These are dharmakaya's excellence-qualities.
[823] Thus it is spoken.
[824] Second: Sambhogakaya's basis—five expansive explanations:
[825] Essence,
[826] Definitive meaning,
[827] Characteristics,
[828] Appearance mode,
[829] Abiding mode—thus.
[830] First: Essence—from Rangshar:
[831] Birth exists, yet death-free, possessing vajra,
[832] Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear,
[833] Possessing five fathers, five fields, five clusters,
[834] Possessing five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations,
[835] Possessing five bases, five paths, five fruitions,
[836] Possessing five abodes, five fields, five essences—
[837] This is sambhogakaya's complete essence.
[838] Thus it is spoken.
[839] Though expressed as birth from expanse's self-appearance arising aspect,
[840] In meaning, birth lacks self-characteristic, thus death-free—for death-lord demon is conquered.
[841] From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges—
[842] Arisen wisdom transcends all arising,
[843] Realizing wisdom transforms within meaning,
[844] In vast kayas, outer-inner aspects clear.
[845] Thus it is spoken.
[846] Five lights: dark blue, white, yellow, red, green.
[847] Five kayas:
[848] Essence-expanse kaya,
[849] Unchanging vajra-kaya,
[850] Dharmakaya,
[851] Sambhogakaya,
[852] Nirmanakaya—five.
[853] Five fathers:
[854] Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.
[855] 
[856] 
[857] 
[858] 
[859] 
[860] 
[861] 
[862] 
[863] 
[864] 
[865] 
[866] Buddha-Lochana,
[867] Mamaki,
[868] Pandaravasini,
[869] Samayatara—five.
[870] Five clusters: surrounded by five—Akshobhya and others—periphery ornamented by five lights' enclosure.
[871] Five primordials:
[872] Five paths, primordially complete,
[873] Five kayas, primordially established,
[874] Rigpa, primordially arisen,
[875] Five lights, primordially resonant,
[876] Defilements, primordially liberated.
[877] Five knowledges:
[878] From realization's extent,
[879] Know as five kayas,
[880] Know as five wisdoms,
[881] Know as five lights,
[882] Know as self-appearance,
[883] Know as duality-free great liberation.
[884] Five realizations:
[885] Realize field as expanse,
[886] Realize beings as kayas,
[887] Realize appearance as light,
[888] Realize arise-liberation category-free,
[889] Realize wisdom as rigpa.
[890] Five bases:
[891] Light-clear basis: rigpa,
[892] Phenomena basis: kunzhi,
[893] Delusion basis: sems,
[894] Path basis: lamp,
[895] Thought basis: wisdom.
[896] Five common paths:
[897] Accumulation path,
[898] Application path,
[899] Seeing path,
[900] Meditation path,
[901] No-more-learning path—five.
[902] Five uncommon paths:
[903] Dharmata path: expanse,
[904] Rigpa path: knowledge,
[905] Light-clear path: two lamps,
[906] Trekcho path: arise-liberation,
[907] Thogal path: expanse-rigpa.
[908] Five fruitions:
[909] Wisdom fruition: liberated in rig,
[910] Light fruition: delusion-appearance ceases,
[911] Realization fruition: delusion-thought clears,
[912] Self-appearance fruition: brought to exhaustion,
[913] Final fruition: dissolves into expanse.
[914] Five abodes:
[915] Thigle abode: tsitta,
[916] Wisdom abode: crown,
[917] Lamp abode: eyes,
[918] Expanse-appearance abode: sky,
[919] Liberation-place abode: primordial purity.
[920] Five fields:
[921] Rigpa's field: expanse,
[922] Lamp's field: sky,
[923] Wisdom's field: bardo,
[924] Light's field: self-appearance,
[925] Sambhogakaya's field: cluster.
[926] Five essences:
[927] Rigpa's essence: primordial purity,
[928] Wisdom's essence: spontaneous accomplishment,
[929] Light's essence: five aspects,
[930] Wisdom's essence: realization,
[931] Lamp's essence: empty-clarity.
[932] Thus in five aspects appearing, some are sambhogakaya's essence.
[933] 
[934] Some are the field,
[935] Some are the method,
[936] Some are the appearance,
[937] Some are wisdom itself—thus Sambhogakaya is explained as one unified essence.
[938] Second, the etymology:
[939] Complete with qualities,
[940] Engaging in pure light-clarity,
[941] Both benefits spontaneously complete,
[942] Wisdom arrived at its full measure,
[943] With marks, signs, radiating light-rays body—the term "five" denotes Sambhogakaya.
[944] From Self-Arisen:
[945] Abiding in empty dharmata state—complete.
[946] Clear, unmixed, all-pervading—complete.
[947] In five wisdoms, gathering-separating not—complete.
[948] Unequal to all, individual marks endowed—complete.
[949] Method-wisdom, gathering-separating not, abiding—complete.
[950] Five appearances themselves, marks not abiding—engage.
[951] Without grasping, self-clear, playing in all—engage.
[952] Crystal-clear, lucid, all-equal abiding—engage.
[953] Vivid, soft, field-abiding, emanations distributing—engage.
[954] Two kayas intent, play arrived at extent—engage.
[955] Crystal-clear, lucid, all-equal abiding—engage.
[956] Vivid, soft, field-abiding, emanations distributing—engage.
[957] Two kayas benefit intent, play arrived at extent—engage.
[958] Grasping-free ground abiding, ten-directions emanations enacted—engage.
[959] All arising, producing, engaging arrived at extent—engage.
[960] Outer, inner, secret actions transcended—complete.
[961] Suddenly appearing reference-free benefit—complete.
[962] Not fallen toward any direction, without coming or going—complete.
[963] State-arisen, not made—complete.
[964] All actions transcended—complete.
[965] Emptiness-wisdom self-endowed.
[966] Emptiness unceased, individually clear.
[967] Wisdom unceased, method-playing.
[968] Clear without thought, grasping non-existent.
[969] Ornaments, forms, marks, characteristics held.
[970] Grasping-free, self-clear, essence-abiding—kaya.
[971] Individual colors, marks, characteristics held—kaya.
[972] Vajra-meaning itself, benefit-endowed—kaya.
[973] Meaning-signs themselves, marks-endowed—kaya.
[974] Without outer-inner, all-clear—kaya.
[975] Essence unchanging, color clear—kaya.
[976] Nature compassion, directions-arising—kaya.
[977] Thus it is spoken.
[978] Third, the characteristics:
[979] Five families' mandalas, unmixed, clear in tone:
[980] From Self-Arisen:
[981] Individual colors unmixed, marks held,
[982] Marks and exemplary features excellent, light-rays blazing,
[983] Father, mother, kaya-form held—
[984] These are Sambhogakaya's characteristics.
[985] Thus it is spoken.
[986] Fourth, appearance manner:
[987] From rigpa's single nature,
[988] From expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates to directions performing benefit;
[989] Rigpa-kaya, unmoving from expanse, without change or transformation—two completions in self-appearance light-clarity field, the inner-outer appearance manner.
[990] From that same nature:
[991] In one nature, two essences—
[992] This is Sambhogakaya's appearance.
[993] Thus it is spoken.
[994] Fifth, abiding manner: expanse without acceptance or rejection,
[995] Space without duality,
[996] Five complete lights' vast expanse,
[997] Abiding in emanations-radiating great continuity.
[998] From Self-Arisen:
[999] Correctly produced, without reference,
[1000] Without entering or liberation mind,
[1001] How could grasping and engaging exist?
[1002] Beyond attachment and fixation words,
[1003] Beyond object-abandoning and abandoner-two,
[1004] Beyond field, mind, intellect.
[1005] In reference-free field,
[1006] Self-appearance cuts through words—appearance.
[1007] Grasping-free, liberated in its own place,
[1008] Emanations enacted in ten directions.
[1009] In reference-pure field appearance,
[1010] Wisdom arises in one cut.
[1011] In reference-free field appearance,
[1012] Marks liberate in their own place.
[1013] From that, emanations widely arise.
[1014] Thus it is spoken.
[1015] Third: extensively explained, Nirmanakaya ground—five aspects:
[1016] Essence,
[1017] Etymology,
[1018] Characteristic,
[1019] Division,
[1020] Examination method.
[1021] First, Nirmanakaya essence: from expanse-kaya and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya and so forth, performing others' benefit.
[1022] The etymology:
[1023] From Self-Arisen:
[1024] Know these emanation-kaya etymologies:
[1025] Because appearing suitable to world-realms beings—emanation kaya.
[1026] Because able to perform emanation-kaya benefit—emanation kaya.
[1027] Because performing all actions—emanation kaya.
[1028] Because able to liberate numberless beings into expanse—emanation kaya.
[1029] Because brief in time in one field realm—emanation kaya.
[1030] Because compassion arising without direction—emanation kaya.
[1031] Because wrathful and fierce—emanation kaya.
[1032] Because peaceful and certain—emanation kaya.
[1033] Because beings see as beautiful—emanation kaya.
[1034] Thus it is spoken.
[1035] Third, the characteristics:
[1036] Performing disciples' two benefits completion:
[1037] From that same nature:
[1038] Emanation-kaya characteristics:
[1039] Actions completion performing,
[1040] Two aspects considered.
[1041] Thus it is spoken.
[1042] Fourth, divisions: generally explained as nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, and so forth;
[1043] On this occasion, depending upon two benefits' completion establishment,
[1044] Completed actions emanation-kaya
[1045] And performing actions emanation-kaya—these two held.
[1046] Moreover, completed actions emanation-kaya, self-benefit spontaneously established:
[1047] In this life or intermediate state, completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,
[1048] Through three connections emanation, benefit performed for those arising as impurity-gate six realms self-appearance,
[1049] Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful.
[1050] Samsara's self-appearance must emptied,
[1051] For delusion-appearance must emptied.
[1052] In common as well:
[1053] "May samsara's three lower realms be exhausted and emptied,"
[1054] Thus it is said, and
[1055] For all beings' liberation mind producing sake.
[1056] Particularly in intermediate state: able or unable emanations release, opening emanations thus Buddha-becoming—all actions,
[1057] When six realms' stations appear below in spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,
[1058] There, through Dharma teaching and so forth, benefit performed for that emptiness-appearing self-appearance,
[1059] By that cause, all samsara-appearing becomes empty,
[1060] When dissolving into pure nirvana expanse through spontaneous accomplishment gate,
[1061] It is called "Buddha entering nirvana."
[1062] This is crucially important to all wisdom-possessors.
[1063] Furthermore, that emptiness-appearing for self-benefit establishing, being self-arisen emanation that liberates self into expanse, is called completed actions emanation-kaya.
[1064] From Self-Arisen:
[1065] Completed actions emanation-kaya:
[1066] Liberating one's own continuum, manifestly awakened,
[1067] From that, distributing emanations.
[1068] Outer-inner actions complete—
[1069] Considered as completed actions emanation-kaya.
[1070] Thus it is spoken.
[1071] Emanations distributing manner:
[1072] When seeing spontaneously accomplished intermediate state's eight gates completion,
[1073] Liberated by knowing self-face,
[1074] In impure samsara's gate,
[1075] Oneself, from Sambhogakaya father-mother union's secret space, radiating light rays, entering individually into each station's pure father-mother womb, appearing to be born—through Dharma teaching, showing liberation.
[1076] This is like dream emanations opening example,
[1077] Summarized merely as self-appearance.
[1078] When channels and elements nearly pure, in this life also six realms appear inside thigle;
[1079] These bound by three inner crucial points binding, reaching exhaustion ground, not depending on emanations distributing.
[1080] This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, is my power.
[1081] Second, performing actions emanation-kaya:
[1082] To ground-abiders, Sambhogakaya;
[1083] To impure, supreme emanation-kaya;
[1084] To very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to individual stations, performing individual beings' benefit.
[1085] From that same nature:
[1086] Performing actions emanation-kaya:
[1087] Showing to each whatever tames them,
[1088] Appearing suitable to others—
[1089] That is like above.
[1090] Not deluded regarding others' benefit,
[1091] Able to transform into anything.
[1092] Appearing suitable to others,
[1093] Overwhelming beings.
[1094] Afflictions naturally non-existent,
[1095] Latencies appearing like body.
[1096] To time-arrived beings,
[1097] Showing great correct benefit.
[1098] To whatever beings are tamed,
[1099] Appearing suitable to that.
[1100] Thus it is said.
[1101] That emanation-kaya also performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges:
[1102] Teaching Dharma in each being's own language through all languages' individual correct knowledge;
[1103] Also knowing faculties and latencies, showing suitable to that thought;
[1104] Also great vehicle
[1105] And small,
[1106] And various,
[1107] And secret mantra: generation and completion;
[1108] Individual and
[1109] Mind and
[1110] Wisdom and
[1111] Alaya and
[1112] Alaya dharmakaya showing and so forth, though showing many,
[1113] Dzogpa Chenpo's nature appears to some fortunate ones at times and occasions, not universally.
[1114] From Self-Arisen:
[1115] All languages knowing,
[1116] In whatever language, that showing.
[1117] Harmonious gathering through harmony,
[1118] Sometimes through words' gate showing,
[1119] Sometimes through dependent arising's gate showing,
[1120] Sometimes through blessing-engagement's gate showing,
[1121] Sometimes through generation's gate showing,
[1122] Sometimes through both's gate showing,
[1123] Sometimes through five awakenings showing,
[1124] Sometimes through three concentrations showing,
[1125] Sometimes expanse and wisdom showing,
[1126] Dzogchen meaning is not contradictory.
[1127] Appears to some fortunate individuals.
[1128] That showing manner is thus:
[1129] Sometimes rigpa-emptiness showing,
[1130] Sometimes no-rigpa emptiness showing,
[1131] Sometimes rigpa matter showing,
[1132] Sometimes rigpa alone showing,
[1133] Sometimes alaya dharmakaya showing,
[1134] Sometimes virtue-lacking sin-lacking showing,
[1135] Sometimes meditation-possessor showing,
[1136] Sometimes no-meditation showing.
[1137] Thus showing emanation-kaya
[1138] Secret mantra supreme's
[1139] Meaning from some not spoken.
[1140] Not spoken, speaking does not occur.
[1141] Though occasionally becomes spoken,
[1142] Arhats, pratyekabuddhas, sutras,
[1143] Hinayana—name also non-existent inside,
[1144] Supreme vehicle proclaims.
[1145] Therefore hidden from other dull intellects.
[1146] That person possessing those,
[1147] Performing actions emanation-kaya is considered.
[1148] Thus.
[1149] Also though Dzogpa Chenpo possible to arise,
[1150] From mind-expanse and pith instruction's very secret cycle down,
[1151] This Nyingtik supreme from universal possibility does not arise, thus extremely rare dharma section—know thus.
[1152] Therefore like jewel, hold as cherished ornament;
[1153] From Uttaratantra:
[1154] Rare arising, stainless,
[1155] Powerful, and world's
[1156] Ornament becoming, thus jewel itself.
[1157] As spoken thus.
[1158] Fifth, emanation-kaya's examination method:
[1159] Teaching dharma with benefit-happiness to common world beings and
[1160] Through Buddha's emanation, two benefits appear somewhat similar;
[1161] That certain examination:
[1162] From Self-Arisen:
[1163] Know emanation examining method like this:
[1164] Even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere,
[1165] In crown ushnisha, one hair cluster curling right,
[1166] In heart center, vajra form,
[1167] Royal caste or high caste birth.
[1168] Conducting conduct suitable to whatever,
[1169] Following in that whatever spoken,
[1170] Not establishing own preferred desires,
[1171] Deed, effort, grasping naturally non-existent,
[1172] Clearing whatever beings desire doubt.
[1173] Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya—thus spoken.
[1174] Although these marks exist showing that as emanation,
[1175] Whether others suitable emanations or not uncertain;
[1176] With pure mind produced, strive to tame own continuum.
[1177] Second: individually explained, five kayas' enumeration—essence,
[1178] Etymology,
[1179] Appearance,
[1180] Division,

[1221] Thus spoken.
[1222] Fifth, meaning application—two aspects:
[1223] First, five families' meaning application:
[1224] From Self-Arisen:
[1225] In rigpa meaning, Thus-Come family explained by Thus-Come;
[1226] In reason meaning, vajra family explained because without birth and death;
[1227] In rigpa meaning, jewel family explained because various arise;
[1228] In rigpa meaning, lotus family explained because faultless and pure;
[1229] In rigpa nature, karma family explained because actions complete.

[1238] Second benefit: tone and light detailed division—two aspects:
[1239] General abiding manner showing,
[1240] And appearance manner individually explaining.
[1241] First:
[1242] Great chief's five lights, primordially great spontaneous accomplishment abiding,
[1243] Now in beings existing manner:
[1244] Inside jewel-heart like risen crest, in clear light channels' center,
[1245] In five lights' tone, rigpa's wisdom abides.
[1246] Also from Self-Arisen:
[1247] That great wisdom appearance
[1248] Abides in tsitta's center.
[1249] Thus spoken.
[1250] Second: individually explained, appearance manner—three aspects:
[1251] To path-untrained appearance manner;
[1252] To path-trained appearance manner;
[1253] Intermediate state appearance manner.
[1254] First:
[1255] Although light radiantly abides in oneself, to six realms not knowing own face, now lamp's self-light exists in subtle portions.
[1256] From that itself:
[1257] To all unrealized beings:
[1258] In humans, example-exists;
[1259] In gods, visible;
[1260] In demigods, subtly exists;
[1261] In animals, merely in own abode;
[1262] In hungry ghosts, flickers;
[1263] In hell realms, like sesame grain—
[1264] Thus six lights abide.
[1265] Thus spoken.
[1266] That light also merely tone existing inside heart.
[1267] By nature, ripening-result latencies' light exists in gods as distant visibility, etcetera;
[1268] Contaminated ripening-result virtue's light,
[1269] Not heart essence's self-light.
[1270] Second: to path-trained appearance manner—nine aspects: light abode,
[1271] Path,
[1272] Field,
[1273] Body,
[1274] Eye,
[1275] Essence,
[1276] Example and simile,
[1277] Time,
[1278] Liberation place.

[1287] Seen when measure arrives.
[1288] Path: Distant visibility arising;
[1289] Field: Empty sky;
[1290] Light body:
[1291] Five kayas and four wisdoms' upward appearances.
[1292] Eye:
[1293] Through wisdom's self-arisen lamp, knowing own face and moving to expanse.
[1294] Essence:
[1295] All-clear, non-ceasing wisdom.
[1296] Example and simile: Like crystal,
[1297] Although five lights in ground-abiding self not clear, they exist as arising ground.
[1298] When conditions experientially taken and intermediate state lamp, ground-appearance fills sky with five lights.
[1299] Time: If experientially taken, can also appear in this life;
[1300] Intermediate state naturally arising time.
[1301] Liberation place: To first primordially pure jewel secret cavity,
[1302] 
[1303] Drawing outer light inward, seizing the ground, gathering crystal light inward—abiding as arising's ground though clarity unclear.
[1304] In those words also, from Self-Arisen:
[1305] Light, kaya, and wisdom,
[1306] Mother, element, and aggregate,
[1307] Ground and family—thus explained.
[1308] Thus spoken,
[1309] And: to all beings, thus;
[1310] Each abiding in own body.
[1311] Thus spoken.
[1312] Appearance manner to this appearance:
[1313] That great wisdom appearance
[1314] Abides in tsitta's center.
[1315] Path: arising from ocean's inside;
[1316] Field: empty sky;
[1317] Body: kayas and wisdom;
[1318] Eye: wisdom's lamp;
[1319] Essence: all-clear mirror.
[1320] Example and simile: stainless lapis crystal kaya;
[1321] Time: dharmata intermediate;
[1322] Arrived at jewel cavity's extent.
[1323] To this appearance, this appearance manner.
[1324] Thus spoken.
[1325] If these appearances seen in this, called "pure one-cutting intermediate state appearance manner."
[1326] Also, when measure arrives—five aggregates' binding liberated portion,
[1327] Inside tone arising outside, five lights' great appearance arising in sky above.
[1328] From that itself:
[1329] Pure one-cutting appearance:
[1330] In pure wisdom's sky,
[1331] Five lights unchanging, clear—
[1332] Also five clusters of five,
