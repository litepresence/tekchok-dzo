[2459] First seven group self-mind ground dwell/
[2460] Second body-mind grasp attachment separate/
[2461] Third dharmata see show/
[2462] /First in seven: mind hold a white characteristic/
[2463] Sit body cross-legged comfortable cushion suitable ground mind/
[2464] From meditate one shine a white nose-tip/
[2465] Wind out go time a also out go/
[2466] Think in come time a also in draw—mix wind meditate/
[2467] /That also: a cold touch, body hot disease exist
[2468] /Think hot touch cold disease—train day-night by/
[2469] Arise experience common not free emanate-gather mind/
[2470] /Equal all pith wind pith body/
[2471] /That dull: put distract awareness one breath, mind hold letter pha/
[2472] Say fierce phat—awareness thought-free ha-de-ba one come, until thought not-arise hold mind, also phat day-night experience take—arise meditation self-resonance emptiness-clear mind/
[2473] /Also: mind hold wrathful pleasure laugh/
[2474] Say short fierce ha—place mind like before, arise experience clear resonance thought-free/
[2475] /Mind hold asura quarrel dispute/
[2476] Sit mountain-peak or rock-top etcetera/
[2477] Slow roll head first hunched body/
[2478] Do slow body move/
[2479] From do day three four thus/
[2480] By force roll element fierce move do/
[2481] /And turbid red blood outer appearance/
[2482] /And flicker yellow/
[2483] /And waver green/
[2484] /And dissolve/
[2485] /After become blue-clear/
[2486] See essence establish not what—self-cease outer appearance/
[2487] Arise experience self-liberate see appearance/
[2488] /This time rely food suitable wind/
[2489] /Place mind letter ram navel/
[2490] /Mind hold expel hum thought—hum long vowel with mix wind, not-distract other hold mind from that nature/
[2491] Occasion say short hum—arise experience purify thought dharmata/
[2492] /Likewise: meditate ram navel, accord pith body wind, and */
[2493] Meditate deity body/
[2494] Place mind do emanate subtle body pore gate nose-tip—arise experience great pure clear awareness/
[2495] /Second: seven pith forehead grasp attachment body-mind/
[2496] Like before pith body wind/
[2497] /Mind hold bindu white-red mix pea locket eyebrow-center/
[2498] /That arise wind experience/
[2499] /Hold wind exist nose-hole two nose skeleton—channel three straight like stick center body exist/
[2500] Purify sin obscuration demon obstacle—shoot like arrow
[2501] /Draw in like hook—enter mother-nose central/
[2502] Arise experience emptiness-clear rigpa—hold mind fill wisdom wind four wheel three channel/
[2503] /Mind hold come in go out two draw between distance mile—arrow white wind nose-tip, arise experience clear thought-free/
[2504] /Mind hold not-distract not-dissipate not-scatter not-blur clear—like rainbow fence five light body give, arise experience pure light-clear/
[2505] /From shoot sky space wind-mind/
[2506] By fixing the mind upon letters, orbs of light, or mandalas of sun and moon—rising ever higher until they sink into space, becoming invisible—an experience arises of emptiness utterly free from conceptual mind.
[2507] By placing the mind within the ear and holding it thus, simultaneous and one-pointed, arises the experience of sound-meditation.
[2508] By holding the mind upon the subtle divine form within the heart, arises the pure clear-light experience. Thus the bardo clear-light matures, and the divine form, ring-sel, and rainbow lights manifest.
[2509] Third: the seven sets demonstrating the seeing of dharmata.
[2510] Holding the mind upon gradual emptiness:
[2511] First, cool the body's many parts.
[2512] Analyze them with many names and so forth.
[2513] Upon the head alone, cool with many names.
[2514] When those names are examined for meaning and the meaning dissolves into atoms, seek where the name abides—
[2515] When not found, within that state where nothing moves in the mind—emptiness displayed in the depths—without searching, anger, remembrance or thought, place simultaneously. An experience of emptiness without duality arises.
[2516] Apply to all appearances exactly as the body is.
[2517] Holding the mind upon instantaneous emptiness:
[2518] Whatever appears, when intensely viewed, think "emptiness cleared, cleared, cleared away."
[2519] Train upon all form-appearances, sound-appearances, and so forth. An experience like placing upon a mirror arises.
[2520] Holding the mind upon impermanence: training appearances to be without fixation.
[2521] Whatever appears without fixation, without truth—appearing variously, thus not true—becoming without boundary, through impermanence—thinking thus and training—
[2522] Arises the experience of separation from planetary fixation.
[2523] Upon whatever appears of the five elements, awareness just-big, placed without distraction—
[2524] Liberation in that very place—experience like a dream arises.
[2525] Holding the mind upon non-thought: appearances whatever appears, awareness whatever becomes—the moment's continuum without parts—thought-free—primordially abides—recognizing that, gathering, reaching, training—arises great thought-free self-abiding meditation.
[2526] Holding the mind upon union.
[2527] When duality appears and duality-grasping arises, through intensely viewing that within oneself, arises the experience of great self-pure non-duality. And furthermore—
[2528] Through making father-mother bliss the path, arises the experience of bliss-emptiness non-duality.
[2529] Making intermediate space the path:
[2530] Meditate rigpa dissolving-dissolved into intermediate space, and—
[2531] Meditate all appearances and mind, within the space of sky, pervasive and full, without any support, and—
[2532] Meditate sky and all phenomena as equal.
[2533] Arises the experience of extreme-free great emptiness.
[2534] The meaning of these also from Sun-Moon Union:
[2535] By placing the mind upon the letter A—
[2536] Phenomena-fixation reverses to its own place.
[2537] By placing the mind upon the generated deity—
[2538] Purifies the body's impurity.
[2539] By means of the vajra-song of speech—
[2540] That satisfies the mind.
[2541] By placing the mind from the letter HUM—
[2542] That cleanses speech-impurity.
[2543] Who holds the mind upon RAM—
[2544] By that purifies all phenomena.
[2545] Who dwells upon the letter HA—
[2546] Exhausts all confusion.
[2547] Who dwells mind upon PHAT—
[2548] That abandons body-speech harm.
[2549] Who meditates upon the brow-center drop—
[2550] By this wind becomes familiarized.
[2551] Who holds mind upon the channels of the staff—
[2552] By that closes the doors of the senses.
[2553] Who familiarizes mind at the nose-tip—
[2554] Gathers vast elements to their own place.
[2555] Who meditated self-light body-support—
[2556] By this becomes familiarized with bardo ground.
[2557] Who projects mind to sky—
[2558] By this becomes familiarized with emptiness.
[2559] Who holds mind upon the ear—
[2560] By this freely uses all sounds.
[2561] Who holds mind upon the heart-center—
[2562] By this thought purifies to self-place.
[2563] Who dwells in emptiness—
[2564] By this stops phenomena-fixation.
[2565] Who meditates sudden emptiness—
[2566] Memories instantaneously empty.
[2567] Who trains impermanence in mind—
[2568] By this reverses samsara-fixation.
[2569] Who holds mind upon five elements—
[2570] By that body-signs arise.
[2571] Who meditates non-thought wisdom—
[2572] By this stops characteristics-fixation.
[2573] Who meditates union-bliss—
[2574] By this makes sense-objects the path.
[2575] Who makes intermediate-space the path—
[2576] By this obtains power over mind.
[2577] Thus it is.
[2578] Furthermore, as auxiliary to these, the method of holding mind upon the five objects of appearance—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch:
[2579] From the Thalgyur:
[2580] Eye, form, sound, smell, taste, and touch.
[2581] Train upon the ground of the five sense-objects, and—
[2582] Forms—face-shapes and forms, and—
[2583] Arts and illusions, different, and—
[2584] Eye-magic, etc.—various.
[2585] Sounds—lute, vase-drum, and—
[2586] Stringed instruments, clay-drum, flute, and—
[2587] Pheng, har, etc.
[2588] Smells—fragrance joined, and—
[2589] Do through pleasing dependent-arising profound.
[2590] Tastes—molasses with six, and—
[2591] Grape-wine mixtures—variously transformed.
[2592] Dependent-arising branches joined.
[2593] Touch—skilled one sits upon throne.
[2594] Scriptures mixed, joined elements, and—
[2595] By means of some tree leaves,
[2596] By touch alone upon dharmata,
[2597] Dwells with non-separated mind.
[2598] Thus it is.
[2599] Especially, the stages of making the four elements yoga:
[2600] From that is spoken:
[2601] The training stage of the three kayas itself,
[2602] Making the qualities of elements chief, and—
[2603] Supreme—earth, water, fire, wind.
[2604] Trained upon sounds—certainly accomplished.
[2605] Upon explanation of water's sound,
[2606] Holds dakini's sound-melody.
[2607] If always familiarized with this,
[2608] Certainly accomplishes emanation-body.
[2609] Earth's sound—cool and heavy,
[2610] Possesses Great Brahma's sound-voice.
[2611] If always hearing-training upon this,
[2612] Certainly accomplishes enjoyment-body.
[2613] Fire's sound—self-made, trained.
[2614] Shows Vishnu-great's speech-melody.
[2615] Who practices hearing upon this,
[2616] Certainly obtains dharma-body's qualities.
[2617] Wind's sound—cutting, resounding,
[2618] Garuda king's practice-speech.
[2619] If knowing this always reciting,
[2620] Common training of three kayas.
[2621] Thus, the sound-meaning of four elements,
[2622] Certainly apply to outer times.
[2623] Winter, spring, summer, autumn—
[2624] Water, earth, fire, wind—
[2625] Apply certainly to sequence of times, and—
[2626] If made suited to yoga body,
[2627] Accomplishment—without doubt in this.
[2628] Thus it is.
[2629] Thus, summarizing the meaning of gods' and humans' mind-holding.
[2630] From Rangshar:
[2631] Gods' and humans' mind-holding:
[2632] Having held mouth-nose breath, and—
[2633] Thought-free, unmoved mind—
[2634] Is the nature of one-pointed awareness.
[2635] Spoken to be without instantaneous thought.
[2636] Cannot indicate the great true meaning.
[2637] Thus it is.
[2638] Second: the bodhisattva's meditation—two:
[2639] Actual divisions, and—
[2640] Arisen as auxiliary.
[2641] First, from two:
[2642] Briefly taught.
[2643] From Rangshar:
[2644] The bodhisattva's meditation—
[2645] Is holding by mind, and—
[2646] Arises by manner or force.
[2647] Familiarized, becomes expanse, and—
[2648] Abandoning food-concept.
[2649] Practiced by ground-dwellers.
[2650] Thought by manner is without.
[2651] That also cannot indicate great meaning.
[2652] Thus it is.
[2653] That also—nature's meaning is rigpa clear-light, and—
[2654] Not merely thought-free dwelling—therefore cannot indicate great meaning.
[2655] Extensively explained—three from:
[2656] Nature-force meditation is—
[2657] Arises spontaneously-accomplished, non-thought manner, and—
[2658] Only placing body-speech relaxed-down.
[2659] Focused-support meditation is—
[2660] Meditate antidote of view—nature without afflictions subtle-coarse, and—
[2661] Only suppress afflictions' heads.
[2662] Ground-dwellers' meditation—ground's actual concentration—only purifying self-ground latencies.
[2663] That from Sun-Moon Union:
[2664] The Great Vehicle's meditation—
[2665] By nature-force meditation—
[2666] Unfabricated body-speech relaxed-down.
[2667] By focused-support meditation—
[2668] Suppress instantaneous afflictions' heads.
[2669] By ground-dwellers' meditation—
[2670] Sustains self-self continuum.
[2671] Thus it is.
[2672] Second: showing arisen-from-arising meditation—two:
[2673] Nature, and—
[2674] Fabricated meditation.
[2675] First, nature meditation is—
[2676] Sentient beings all—when awareness distracted—arises from slightly trembling abiding, and.
[2677] Exists upon archer's eye, and—
[2678] Upon sleeping eye within rabbit and eagle, etc.
[2679] Briefly: exists always during times when mind-consciousness is distracted.
[2680] Second is fabricated meditation:
[2681] Meditation, concentration, non-thought, thought-with deity generation-completion, etc.—all are fabricated deliberately by mind, and—
[2682] Because deliberately done by intellect.
[2683] Here, depending upon purpose, placed as three, and—
[2684] That—upon yogi, food and clothes immediately harm.
[2685] Ultimately, dream and latencies harm, because circulates through three realms.
[2686] Those antidotes—meditation session cutting food fixation.
[2687] Meditation session cutting clothes fixation.
[2688] Meditation session cutting dream and latencies fixation—train from three.
[2689] First is:
[2690] Depending upon various essence-extraction, and—
[2691] From two: depend upon wind.
[2692] Various essence-extraction is:
[2693] Five-elements essence-extraction, and—
[2694] Medicine, and—
[2695] Grass, nectar, etc.—many, yet precious-jewels essence-extraction—supreme profound.
[2696] Essence-extraction of gathered precious-jewels and five nectars is.
[2697] From Thalgyur:
[2698] By essence extraction wish.
[2699] Method of joining five nectars:
[2700] Upon equal elements at other times,
[2701] Skilled, well-joined proportions, and—
[2702] Place within precious-jewels vessel.
[2703] Then honey, ushira.
[2704] And well-close the mouth.
[2705] And gradually take mercury drops.
[2706] Like bean-stones inside.
[2707] If skilled ones use as food,
[2708] Also great essence-extraction.
[2709] Become without doubt.
[2710] Thus it is.
[2711] Wind upper-lower joined, and—
[2712] Drawn within roma's channel, and—
[2713] Think throat's wheel full of nectar taste, and—
[2714] Hide earth-water wind—appearances all become food.
[2715] Dissolve into throat and roma.
[2716] Meditate bliss of meditation pervading—accomplished food-yoga.
[2717] These from Thalgyur.
[2718] Essence extraction like this:
[2719] By depending upon precious jewels,
[2720] Lifespan equals sun and moon.
[2721] By practicing various stones,
[2722] Weapons strike not the body.
[2723] By practicing depending upon herbs,
[2724] Becomes without white hair and wrinkles.
[2725] By essence-practice, by essence-extraction,
[2726] Becomes youthful with splendor.
[2727] By practicing depending upon flesh,
[2728] Becomes with body essence, strength generated.
[2729] Moreover by depending upon wind,
[2730] Explained wonder-great essence-extraction.
[2731] Called elements continuum-cut.
[2732] By upper-lower wind know.
[2733] Skilled—hide in wind-place.
[2734] Or calculate wind-change.
[2735] Becomes food-yoga.
[2736] Thus by essence extraction,
[2737] Cut sentient-beings' suffering.
[2738] Thus it is.
[2739] That—austerity and,
[2740] Essence extraction distinction:
[2741] If little stones, water, etc. support, eaten, drunk, mantra, focus merely made path—this is austerity.
[2742] Pills, small-vessel, support exists or not—also suitable, and.
[2743] If yoga made of wind and essence—becomes called essence extraction.
[2744] Second, from three: train in meditation session cutting clothes fixation.
[2745] Dependent-arising profound, flesh practice, and—
[2746] Stone practice, and—
[2747] Herb practice, and—
[2748] Essence practice, etc.

[2754] Depending upon wind is.
[2755] Sit cross-legged, wind drawn within, pressed, stomach hot fire gone, time slowly hold, and.
[2756] Slowly released, and—
[2757] Wind's trace little held, also drawn by—
[2758] Heat arises, without sentient-beings, and—
[2759] Afflictions and thought cease by nature.
[2760] Also from Thalgyur:
[2761] Clothes yoga like this:
[2762] Do by profound dependent-arising of wind.
[2763] From wind extending and gathering,
[2764] Also by point of carrying going-coming.
[2765] Focus each element, and—

[2771] Thus it is.
[2772] Third: train in meditation session cutting dream and latencies fixation:
[2773] Channels-wind.
[2774] Dream.
[2775] Illusory-body.
[2776] Clear-light.
[2777] Transference.

[2782] Purify channel-wind drop water-one within cavity of four wheels.
[2783] Heat and wisdom arising from that—supreme means of actual path explained.
[2784] As branch of that, depending upon wisdom, make help as shown before, other-body means-path point, and.
[2785] If not depend, great-bliss drop blazing-flowing, and—
[2786] Know by experience of two bliss-channels slowly contracted, tongue little moved.
[2787] By entering certainty of equal clear-light point through wind practice.
[2788] That certainty from Thalgyur:
[2789] Depending upon wind, separate karma-mind.
[2790] Because cut three-realms escape-hole.
[2791] Reverse body-speech fixation from depth.
[2792] Because six-realms' precipice equal.

[2837] Power transfer upon other, or.
[2838] Do drive by body's yantra, and.
[2839] From Thalgyur:
[2840] Tantra other all not explained.

[2868] Know other-body dependent-arising practice.
[2869] Thus accomplish meaning made.
[2870] Thus it is.
[2871] That is three-gates' yantra.

[2907] Or mind's actions.
[2908] Transform various concentration.
[2909] Divide extreme from suffering.
[2910] Thus it is.
[2911] Transfer is.
[2912] Able to transfer upon self-sickness, human, animal, tree, stone, etc., by those well-mastered in wind, and—
[2913] Able to transfer other-sickness upon other.
[2914] This time, transfer guru's sickness upon other, and—
[2915] Do not transfer upon inanimate other than transfer upon inanimate.
[2916] Because contradicts abandoning harm to sentient-beings from mantra-samaya.
[2917] And do not transfer sickness in nature.
[2918] Born to purify self-other's obscurations, and—
[2919] Because transferred also arises again.
[2920] Because instant-transferred also karma not transferred, because arises from karma.
[2921] From Thalgyur:
[2922] Two types of transfer-action.
[2923] Actual itself, emptiness.
[2924] Actual included by form.
[2925] From mastering elements thus.
[2926] And made depending upon familiarized wind.
[2927] Upon whatever actual-form.
[2928] Able to move by placed awareness.
[2929] Then begin actual-transfer.
[2930] Chief is familiarized emptiness-mind.
[2931] Dharma-space, dharma-body.
[2932] Know by non-dual practice-emptiness.
[2933] Upon emptiness-clear nature.
[2934] Mind also within that's state.
[2935] By complete dependent-arising ritual.
[2936] Method of releasing point-transfer, and.
[2937] Know from voice-recitation.
[2938] By each element-body meeting.
[2939] Do transfer by seeing only.
[2940] By skilled wind-joined.
[2941] However, if reached upon actual-accomplishment.
[2942] Accomplish all actions by invisible-form.
[2943] If see substance of actual-attachment.
[2944] Take by transfer because offer to guru.
[2945] Do not do other.
[2946] Thus, mount, form, etc.
[2947] If hero-guru commands.
[2948] Take this also by familiarized wind.
[2949] By possessing attract-mind.
[2950] Do transfer by yogi.
[2951] Thus it is.
[2952] Accomplish transfer by mastering wind of all four elements in nature, and.
[2953] Accomplish by especially mastering karma-wind.
[2954] Transfer is also appearance-mind mixed, power obtained over elements.
[2955] Not only transfer sickness alone, bliss-suffering fixation, and.
[2956] Area and—
[2957] Transfer forests etc. not exists.
[2958] Transfer not exists.
[2959] Attract transfer here that exists within other area.
[2960] Project transfer to other that exists here.
[2961] Transfer like sentient-beings coming to inanimate-actual's self-place.
[2962] Draw mount, girl, etc. by wind to sky, transfer to self-place.
[2963] For example: great master Padma transferred Mangyul mountains, and—
[2964] Transferred Ne'u-thang and tree-forest within Samye, like exists until now.
[2965] This is supreme for accomplishing yogi's wishes.
[2966] From Thalgyur:
[2967] Yogi of great fortune wishes transfer.
[2968] Upon included rigpa-with mind.
[2969] Upon living that appears as form.
[2970] By inner-consistent karma change.
[2971] Transfer self-sickness etc. upon other.
[2972] By thus transferred, free from actual.
[2973] Do other by dependent-arising practice.
[2974] From four inanimate elements.
[2975] By dependent-arising become actual.
[2976] By numbers, code, sounds.
[2977] Transfer sickness etc. by transforming focus.
[2978] Wood, stones, pieces, and—
[2979] Grass, sticks, twists, etc.
[2980] Thus water, earth, sky also.
[2981] Hold certainly transfer-action.
[2982] Transform by yoga-mind-power.
[2983] Thus it is.
[2984] Second: dream—two:
[2985] Preliminary and—
[2986] Actual.
[2987] First, from three:
[2988] Training—day prostrations, circumambulations, recitation, mind's projection-gathering by force—purified body-speech-mind three—many flickering-flickering dreams arise—is measure of mastered.
[2989] Then from those dreams—examine latency subtle-thick—then day very relaxed, slightly trembling release—think hold and examine dream—made without distraction from one-pointed.
[2990] If much dream of before-fixation objects etc.
[2991] Because great before-fixation latency—difficult, easy, medium transform.
[2992] If much dream now—very easy—mastered in about three-four days.
[2993] And place not reached before.
[2994] If dream human etc. not-experienced meet—difficult to cut.
[2995] If three all mixed-mixed dream—three latencies combined—very difficult to cut.
[2996] Suppress is dream-hold.
[2997] Upon this—aspiration one-pointed only—oral-instruction point is.
[2998] By made sudden stable aspiration, certainty, thinking day-dream is here arose.
[2999] Night held certainly.
[3000] This time—cheat people, transform.
[3001] Emanate, transform, and—
[3002] By train capacity of area, realms, view, etc.
[3003] Is suppress appearance.
[3004] By made first great guru-devotion, aspiration upon that.
[3005] First—fear arise from fierce conditions water, fire, dog, enemy, etc.—think sit within dream—called harsh-hold, hold certainly.
[3006] Then all how-dreamed held come.
[3007] Held-time emanation.
[3008] By made emanation one-to-many—day mind's deity-form, sentient-beings, different appearances many—emanate.
[3009] See like emanation within dream.
[3010] Then mutual god-naga transform.
[3011] Transform male-female.
[3012] Certain is arise within dream—trained day without distraction from aspiration—transform one-to-many, many-to-one.
[3013] Then travel there within dream, hear dharma etc.—mind made before not-reached place, realms, etc.
[3014] If made these fierce aspiration—quickly mastered.
[3015] Yet explained dream meditation actual some.
[3016] Here suitable as preliminary—because not free from intellect truth-grasping—merely held dream, emanate-transform not dharmata meaning.
[3017] Before most not explained this exists—very important point said suppression explanation, dream point oral-instruction, and.
[3018] Is certainty taken self-experience.
[3019] Second, actual—three:
[3020] Dharmata-meaning point,
[3021] Means, and—
[3022] Focus point,
[3023] Channel-wind binding point.
[3024] From three: train, transform, cut.
[3025] Meditate all three—very difficult, and—
[3026] Yet also said whichever one enough—easy, two medium.
[3027] Train all in practice when do guide this—meditate all time.
[3028] First train dream—day appearances all—last night's dreamed dream—clear aspiration—made emanate-transform, and.
[3029] Train outer truth-without time—training-rigpa look—arise-arise base-without, root-free nature—naked, clearly meditate.
[3030] All fixation-without, truth-without, base-without, recognition-without—recognize appearances' nature—one-pointed—meditate without losing effort-force—appearances only—actually illusion-dream arise—karma, latency, deluded-appearance, deluded-grasping all cease.
[3031] And arise without distraction from that state within dream.
[3032] Day-night dharmata-wheel—not beyond.
[3033] Dream-transform from appearance-emptiness two.
[3034] Appearance-transform point—depend made upon showing deity-form in mirror, and.
[3035] Transform all appearances to deity's mandala, and—
[3036] Transform to Buddha's realm, and—
[3037] Do by fierce aspiration transforming illusion's eight-examples.
[3038] Transform emptiness—like smoke clearing, cloud gathering in sky.
[3039] Moment-emptiness deluded-appearance—wide flat flat meditate.
[3040] Become that thus within dream.
[3041] Upon this itself how appear time—dream cut.
[3042] Not establish rigpa-hold top intermediate-space.
[3043] Not hold appearance form-reflection top here-rig.
[3044] Not confused by thought of connection between appearance-mind two.
[3045] 
[3046] 
[3047] 
[3048] Whatever mind not do—vast release inner-clear self-clear rigpa.
[3049] Made thus—first dream coarse.
[3050] Then subtle.
[3051] Then fade.
[3052] Gone increasingly few, finally anything not dream—practice meaning day-night mixed self-clear rigpa concentration—meditation called day-night union.
[3053] Upon second means-focus point:
[3054] Stir, and—
[3055] Squeeze.
[3056] From three: throw point.
[3057] First point—dream use time, not held, not mastered—held mastered.
[3058] Easy mastered—train mixed-mixed by stirring mutual reverse of meditated.
[3059] Also accomplish by stirring sequence of placed wind-mind in wheels four's place.
[3060] Squeeze—throat hide mind, squeeze channel by lion-sleep way body-point, focus squeeze.
[3061] Dream squeeze—sleep without other-thought distraction.
[3062] Throw point—fierce aspiration reach oral-instruction point.
[3063] Think red-A white-lotus four-petals center in throat center sleep time, and.
[3064] Contract channel-waves, sleep that state, by.
[3065] Other not profound than this point—dream arise.
[3066] Train that, and—
[3067] Stir, and—
[3068] Transform, and—
[3069] Squeeze, and—
[3070] Supreme precious combine three—cut, point, throw.
[3071] Accomplish great experience this point—explained three stir squeeze point throw wheel channel place, occasion here.
[3072] Third, channel-wind binding point.
[3073] Precious companion all dream time.
[3074] Also point enter wind-drop net.
[3075] Think dissolve recollection-wheel nose all samsara-nirvana appearance-existence, project slowly wind lion-sleep way time, and.
[3076] Draw wind inner.
[3077] And place focus clear bright like mirror form-reflection heart bliss state all appearance fall drop HAM crown.
[3078] Train again-again, and.
[3079] Reverse upward all appearance to throat's wheel, and.
[3080] Hold mind become one red-A, and.
[3081] Secret great point this—sleep holding throat wind-essence.
[3082] Become wake delusion—finally cease dream-latency by thus point-bound.
[3083] Possible dream cease—though focus all complete not—great effort this time.
[3084] And quickly hold dream medium.
[3085] Finally cease—become virtue-latency finally.
[3086] Go finally few from many dream first—those.
[3087] Little fade dream first—great effort.
[3088] And very clear dream medium.
[3089] Arise many unclear finally.
[3090] Held first—those.
[3091] Become virtue middle.
[3092] Called dream clear-light wake—become sleep clear-light time finally dream cease.
[3093] From Thalgyur:
[3094] Dream-point path-take.
[3095] First place point empowerment.
[3096] First train body-speech-mind.
[3097] And depend mastered signs.
[3098] Suppress and examine.
[3099] Hold certainty latency three.
[3100] Time reach point then.
[3101] Cut and transform, train.
[3102] Throw point, squeeze, stir.
[3103] By made karma-point draw-reverse.
[3104] And finally cease karma-dream.
[3105] Extract root latency-delusion.
[3106] By self-effort this time.
[3107] Know medium, cease great.
[3108] Certainly change finally.
[3109] Many first dream—those.
[3110] Finally stop fade great.
[3111] Upon very clear medium.
[3112] Know is finally.
[3113] Change then unclear finally.
[3114] Reach measure all those.
[3115] Thus it is.
[3116] Instruction transform confusion to clear-light—this dream-point.
[3117] From that:
[3118] Who meditates sleep-yoga.
[3119] By this, confusion is made into the path.
[3120] Thus it is.
[3121] Third, the illusory body: making appearance-existence into the yoga of illusion.
[3122] Herein, daytime training of the illusory body upon reflection, and.
[3123] Nighttime training of the illusory body in dream—two aspects.
[3124] First: appearance of reflection arising in mirror, and.
[3125] Upon these outer-inner phenomena difference not existing.
[3126] Holding as true—what use?
[3127] All are illusion-reflection appearance—knowing this with non-distracted aspiration, meditate whatever appears as illusion-reflection, and.
[3128] Especially upon one's own form appearing in mirror.
[3129] Putting on clothes, and.
[3130] Putting ornaments, and.
[3131] Removing those, throwing outside, and.
[3132] Praising, and.
[3133] Disparaging, etcetera—doing these.
[3134] Though that form appears there, like meaning not established.
[3135] Upon this appearance—self-other.
[3136] Enemy-friend.
[3137] Food-clothing.
[3138] Enjoyment.
[3139] Pleasant-unpleasant.
[3140] Denial-affirmation.
[3141] Birth-death.
[3142] Happiness-suffering.
[3143] Sickness-pain.
[3144] Whatever arises, remembers, appears—all samsara-nirvana phenomena like reflections inside mirror, knowing essence not existent from time of appearance itself.
[3145] Mastering deluded-appearance truthless illusion-nature.
[3146] Seeing own body also as illusion-body, without doubt holding bardo illusory-body.
[3147] As said in the Ljonpa-asked Sutra:
[3148] Upon completely pure mirror-mandala.
[3149] Like face-reflection appearing.
[3150] How nature not established.
[3151] Ljonpa, know phenomena.
[3152] Thus said, and.
[3153] From Arya Samadhiraja Sutra:
[3154] How night-water-moon.
[3155] Though appearing in clear defilement-not-exist lake.
[3156] Water-moon empty hollow essence not exist.
[3157] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3158] How people many midst.
[3159] Illusionist by forms emanate and.
[3160] Horse elephant chariot various make.
[3161] Like various appearance not-true upon that.
[3162] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3163] How water-field moist tree.
[3164] 
[3165] Though person cuts that for desire of essence.
[3166] Inside and outside—all essence not exist.
[3167] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3168] Thus it is.
[3169] Second, nighttime training illusory-body in dream: knowing all appearance as dream like before, training mastery all appearance-existence as illusion-dream.
[3170] Mastering birth-death, denial-affirmation, all deluded-appearance as dream-illusion.
[3171] In dream also thus arising, attachment sesame-grain not exist.
[3172] Again from that:
[3173] How in young girl's dream.
[3174] Seeing son arise and die.
[3175] Joy upon arising, not-joy upon dying—like this.
[3176] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3177] Thus it is.
[3178] At this time path-application virtues arise in self.
[3179] From Abhisamayalankara:
[3180] In dream also all phenomena.
[3181] View as dream-like, etcetera.
[3182] Sign of application reaching peak.
[3183] Taught as twelve aspects.
[3184] Thus it is.
[3185] Thus training illusory-body daytime-nighttime.
[3186] True-attachment to deluded-appearance not exist, and.
[3187] Seeing body also as transparent, shadow-form-like appearance, truth-not-exist.
[3188] Shadow not exist upon body, and.
[3189] Holding bardo illusory-body, becoming final-existence person.
[3190] Like holy precious lama Gyalwa Zhangton and scholar Nyibum.
[3191] Those also from Thalgyur:
[3192] Train illusory-body dream.
[3193] By that mastery, body itself also.
[3194] Become like shadow-form.
[3195] By that intermediate body.
[3196] These become self-held.
[3197] Thus it is.
[3198] Fourth, practicing depending on instruction of four-times equal-application to clear-light.
[3199] Outer four-times equal-application holding channel-wind in channel.
[3200] Inner four-times equal-application instruction expression cease.
[3201] Secret four-times equal-application instruction mind unmodified settle.  [3198] That-ness four-times equal-application instruction clear-light mother-son unite.
[3202] From that:
[3203] From outer four times.
[3204] Train mastery yoga-body, and.
[3205] Point: hold all channels in source.
[3206] By inner four times.
[3207] Train mastery yoga-speech, and.
[3208] Point: cut all expression-ornaments.
[3209] Also by secret four times.
[3210] Train mastery yoga-mind, and.
[3211] Point is familiar with sleep.
[3212] By that-ness four times.
[3213] Gather body and speech-mind by that.
[3214] Mix great clear-light sleep.
[3215] Thus familiar, apply certainty to three kayas.
[3216] Yogi.
[3217] Thus it is.
[3218] Those practice methods extensive, clear in Four Times Equal Application.
[3219] Here, summarizing points of clear-light four-times equal-application to teach—four aspects.
[3220] Daytime: apply seal to appearance.
[3221] Dusk: gather senses to place.
[3222] Midnight: put knowable in vase.
[3223] Dawn: make wisdom clear.
[3224] First, from two: samadhi and post-meditation.
[3225] Samadhi: mixing sleep, hold wind gently with lion-sleep method, and.
[3226] Not blinking eye, holding mind on five-light mass inside heart, sleep by.
[3227] Time outer appearance gradually diminishing.
[3228] Sleep and dream gap, one clear thought-not-exist consciousness exists—that recognize as clear-light, and.
[3229] Sleep by not dull in that state, sleep clear-light arise.
[3230] Dream not exist.
[3231] Consciousness self-clear in samadhi state.
[3232] Gone to sleep, know near form-sound-smell aspects not cease, and.
[3233] Not gone, arise wake from that state by condition, and.
[3234] Day appearance, only thought cease, appearance aspect itself clear.
[3235] That also, six-aggregate mind-consciousness cease, and.
[3236] Five-door consciousness not cease, clear.
[3237] Time mind-consciousness dissolve into clear-light, wind enters central, and.
[3238] 
[3239] Five-door consciousness thought-not-exist, though object appears, not gone to grasp power.
[3240] Called clear thought-not-exist clear.
[3241] This time bliss clear-light exist in samadhi state.
[3242] Clear clear-light exist not-cease appearance.
[3243] Thought-not-exist clear-light, thought-not-exist self-abide exist in that state by.
[3244] In ground-nature clear-light primordially-pure.
[3245] Child self-clear clear-light mix two-not-exist, and.
[3246] Called clear-light mother-child mix by wisdom-clear also clear arise.
[3247] From Thalgyur:
[3248] By great clear-light transference.
[3249] Train sleep samadhi, and.
[3250] Outer appearance clear daytime-nighttime not-different by mastery.
[3251] This accomplishes great clear-light.
[3252] Thus it is.
[3253] Bliss clear-light exist in simultaneous-joy time of equipoise-nature.
[3254] Clear clear-light exist day-night mix samadhi time.
[3255] Thought-not-exist clear-light exist time mind grasp-thought dissolve.
[3256] Also exist other time, recognize difficult, and.
[3257] That time example clear, easy know meaning.
[3258] From bliss clear-light not able separate samadhi, experience arise appearance joy-bliss arise.
[3259] From clear clear-light: smoke, and.
[3260] Mirage, and.
[3261] Firefly, and.
[3262] Cloud, and.

[3273] See form though coarse cut, and.
[3274] Able go through meditation-hall wall fence, etcetera, and.
[3275] Many eye-clairvoyance arise.
[3276] Thought-not-exist clear-light samadhi sign-mix, and.
[3277] Whatever-appear look time, thought-not-exist ease go, and.
[3278] Any speech non-dual thought-not-exist go, and.
[3279] Arise immeasurable experience think always dwell sky state.
[3280] These profound points, experience certainty establish manifest by valid-cognition.
[3281] Samadhi not mix sleep, sit cross-legged, and.
[3282] 
[3283] Put blinking eye to space, consciousness half-essence time.
[3284] Little lower eye, direct look, one experience trace arise.
[3285] Recognize that, meditate in state.
[3286] Awareness self-clear sky-like clear, that is clear clear-light, and.
[3287] That experience: familiar in that state, appearance-mind pervade not-exist, become like one sky.
[3288] Think exist in sky space, and.
[3289] Arise immeasurable think body-mind separate sometimes, etcetera.
[3290] That time also arise countless rainbow-light drop form appearance.
[3291] Called color clear-light, wind-five clear self-essence outer.
[3292] See self body particle inner organ, appear like day-night, and.
[3293] See also other body inside, pure-land, country place, sentient-being action do, death-transition, birth take.
[3294] Second post-meditation, called rise from samadhi, is.
[3295] Rise from that state, view these outer appearances light-five form, instantly sentient-being grass-tree arise appearance.
[3296] View illusion eight-example, and.
[3297] View like sky, and.
[3298] Correct point: train one pervade grasp-not-exist empty-clear appearance, mix with now what experience.
[3299] Second, dusk: gather senses to place.
[3300] Sit cross-legged, from secret to Brahma-aperture, central inside white-A hollow piled like exist, all upward one one dissolve, meditate until Brahma son aperture, and.

[3306] By holding mind on one white-A hovering in sky bow-length from crown.
[3307] First clear A, then that also not-exist, other thought not-change, arise clear half-essence, meditate in that state.
[3308] These very important points by experience, very effort do.
[3309] Fifth, transference: three aspects.
[3310] Great: clear-light transference.
[3311] Medium: illusory-body transference.
[3312] Finally: body-speech transference.
[3313] That is not three transference places.
[3314] Three capacities of transference-doer.
[3315] Some apply three transference, other is.
[3316] Here, if self masters clear-light, death-time from that state extract awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmadhatu.
[3317] If master illusory-body, death-time from illusory-body state project awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmata meaning deity-form, hold bardo illusory-body, buddha.
[3318] If those two not mastered, depend body-speech-mind three points channel-wind, transference to Brahma-aperture, and.
[3319] From Thalgyur:
[3320] Three aspect transference types.
[3321] By sense distinction.
[3322] Clear-light and illusory-body and.
[3323] Upon finally body-speech mind.
[3324] Thus it is.
[3325] Support-have channel-wind dependent-origination action depend transference, and.
[3326] Two: support-not mind focus only transference, actual transference and actual-not transference said, and.
[3327] From Thalgyur:

[3333] By individual element internal harmony.
[3334] Accomplish body-speech-mind focus.
[3335] Actual-not: show mind familiar power.
[3336] Thus it is.
[3337] Brahma-aperture is transference path.
[3338] From Four Vajra Seats:
[3339] From upper nine apertures.
[3340] If immediately do mind transference.
[3341] Day like kill Brahmin, and.
[3342] Also do five borderless.
[3343] Without doubt become liberated this.
[3344] Thus it is.
[3345] Sixth, two: union bardo instruction.
[3346] Point of union realization by practicing this life, and.
[3347] Actual bardo instruction.
[3348] First is.

[3356] By familiar with bardo arise manner.
[3357] Certainty measure bardo liberate master in dream.

[3384] Whatever person not cut past trace.
[3385] Not raise future hope.
[3386] If put present consciousness place.
[3387] Mix not-exist before-after, and.
[3388] Called what essence one-gathered, yogi realize time-three equal.
[3389] Thus it is.
[3390] Second is actual bardo instruction.
[3391] Earth water fire wind space gradually dissolve, and.
[3392] Time space dissolve into clear-light.
[3393] Upward Ha and downward A two gather heart, bliss-clear thought-not-exist clear-light.  [3389] Appearance, and.
[3394] Increase, and.
[3395] Attain, and.
[3396] Four wisdoms: near-attain, moment one, and.
[3397] Two and three and.
[3398] Arise four, and.
[3399] Yogis familiar with clear-light before recognize that, clear-light mother-child mix, and.
[3400] Moment upward transparent in primordially-pure dharmakaya dharmadhatu.
[3401] For those not recognize there, existence bardo, medium senses arise deity illusory-body, liberate.
[3402] Finally continue good, and.
[3403] Certainty liberate meeting supreme dharma future.
[3404] From Mayajala:
[3405] Though not obtain liberation this birth.
[3406] Obtain liberation existence other birth.
[3407] Thus it is.
[3408] Also said future liberate those with faith in that-ness common path, and.

[3410] If know that here.
[3411] Though not obtain nirvana.
[3412] Effort not other birth.
[3413] Like law certainty obtain become.
[3414] Like thus said.
[3415] With elaboration of those, Mahayana samadhi explained complete.
[3416] Third, from two Sugata intentions.
[3417] Briefly teach is.
[3418] From Rangshar:
[3419] Sugata intention is.
[3420] Know sky expanse.
[3421] Also become familiar that.

[3427] Two Sugata intentions.
[3428] Sensation cease by not-modify place.
[3429] Obtain warmth measure by not-meditate look.
[3430] Thus it is.
[3431] That also: dharmata mother appearance, not spread gather hope, great boundary-not-exist samadhi-post-meditation intention, gap-not river-continuum yoga.
[3432] Is place one become space, not distracted not-distracted, nature end-middle not-exist sky.
[3433] This time called daytime-nighttime union meditation.
[3434] Daytime pass portion.
[3435] Nighttime samsara portion.
[3436] By arise not distinguish daytime-nighttime difference.
[3437] Daytime meditation experience clear cause not exist.
[3438] Is gradually gone nighttime unclear not exist.
[3439] Two meaning: that instruction ocean relax method.
[3440] Call ocean eye water essence.
[3441] Called ocean relax by place that not move.
[3442] That also: not meditate not meditate.
[3443] Point is gazing not blinking eye beyond meditate do.
[3444] By do thus, like ocean not stain by grasp object not exist, appear object exist spread relax all whatever appear reflection etcetera planet ocean example.
[3445] Though appear appearance face, outer appearance arise measure yogi eye path.
[3446] By not stain, grasp object not exist, consciousness not lose appearance moment.
[3447] Outer appearance not stain consciousness.
[3448] Inner consciousness not grasp appearance.
[3449] Called spontaneous meditation six-aggregate, liberate object grasp grasp-not-exist, cut relate appearance consciousness.
[3450] This actual meditation, and.
[3451] From two: cut error place.
[3452] Actual: gather wind-mind point, put consciousness self-place, is.
[3453] From Thalgyur:
[3454] Upon mind settle meditation called.
[3455] Is cut outer-inner move.
[3456] Grasp grasp cease.
[3457] Said, and.

[3460] Mind not modify appearance not change.
[3461] Show intention dwell dharmata sky.
[3462] Abandon all thought dharmakaya wisdom, and.
[3463] Is meditation intention move do not exist.
[3464] If not hold focus direction.
[3465] Like planet arise ocean.
[3466] Clear aspect grasp-not-exist not cease.
[3467] Intention dwell manner thus.
[3468] Thus it is.
[3469] Complete dharmata relax intention that time.
[3470] From Klongchenpa Six:
[3471] Upon mind itself pure exist.
[3472] As self-pure all objects door-five.
[3473] Like clear water not defile.
[3474] Complete self-place all appearance.

[3476] Second, cut error place is.
[3477] If that also go memory-not by cease six-aggregate.
[3478] Error place: go one direction shamatha.
[3479] Error place: go spread scattering.
[3480] Error place: not find self-essence depth clear.

[3492] Consciousness not practice appearance.
[3493] Without peg hold one-pointed clear half-essence nature.
[3494] Is self-arisen wisdom meditation: pervade pervade great self-liberate vast vast clear.
[3495] From that:
[3496] Is appearance-manner meditation characteristic.
[3497] Upon awareness empty-clear characteristic.
[3498] Not mix where nature.
[3499] And cease extreme grasp grasp.
[3500] Pure self-face dharmata.
[3501] Thus it is.
[3502] Is fault not-meditate incidental.
[3503] From that:
[3504] Is itself fault not-meditate.
[3505] By manifest appear samsara characteristic.
[3506] Self other object consciousness and.
[3507] And view with word.
[3508] And object with focus.
[3509] Become bind self affliction.
[3510] And lose also Buddha path.
[3511] And not-know result nature.
[3512] And ground not-exist equal all dharma.
[3513] And bind three-realms self-aware.
[3514] Become downfall with thought.
[3515] Thus it is.
[3516] Therefore effort do meditation.
[3517] Third is dharmata arise ground relax appearance-existence that intention.
