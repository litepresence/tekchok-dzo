[3922] Now, again, for those free from elaborations, the good path of rigpa self-appearance, the secret great vajra essence, is shown in two aspects:
[3923] The manner of being definitely superior through surpassing the common vehicle,
[3924] And explaining the path itself which possesses distinctions.
[3925] First:
[3926] Surpassing through seven piths.
[3927] Other paths, through great wisdom, quickly realize and liberate; those of small wisdom do not liberate. This path sees through the pith of sense-powers, and effort great or small alone—sense-powers sharp or dull—does not constitute the pith.
[3928] Others, through intellect confidence in self-dharmatā, throw emptiness meditation like a dark stone. This mind, not relying on intellect, directly exists like direct perception—thus not relying on intellect is the pith.
[3929] Others rely progressively on expressing words, hoping to primordially realize meaning. This, not relying on a single word-letter, directly sees meaning—thus words do not make Buddha, which is the pith.
[3930] Others, making the meaning of self-natural-state a mind-object, rely on time to distinguish ground, path, and fruit. This, directly becoming self-clear, does not rely on mind-made thought's ground and path—thus Buddha is the pith.
[3931] Others, relying before and after on cause-effect, seek enlightenment elsewhere. This, not relying on good or bad actions of cause-effect, self-dawns enlightenment—thus effort and accept-reject do not exist, which is the pith.
[3932] Others, relying on channels, winds, bindus, etcetera, spread youth-time to accomplish enlightenment. Aging, power exhausts, not liberating. This, self-arising clear light sun-moon dawning from within, possesses effort—thus aging old-young does not exist, which is the razor pith.
[3933] Others rely on regarding the final fruit as three bodies. This, the three bodies dawning as path-appearance, final clear light primordially-pure vastness spontaneously-accomplishes rigpa's definite establishment—this is the pith.
[3934] Others, through intellect confidence in self-dharmatā, throw emptiness meditation like a dark stone. This mind, not relying on intellect, directly exists—thus not relying on intellect is the pith.
[3935] Others rely progressively on expressing words, hoping to primordially realize meaning. This, not relying on a single word, directly sees meaning—thus words do not make Buddha, which is the pith.
[3936] Others, making self-natural-state meaning a mind-object, rely on time to distinguish ground, path, and fruit. This, directly becoming self-clear, does not rely on mind-made ground and path—thus Buddha is the pith.
[3937] Others, relying before and after on cause-effect, seek enlightenment elsewhere. This, not relying on cause-effect good-bad action, self-dawns enlightenment—thus effort and accept-reject do not exist, which is the pith.
[3938] Others, relying on channels, winds, bindus, etcetera, spread youth-time to accomplish enlightenment. Aging, power exhausts, not liberating. This, self-arising clear light sun-moon dawning within, possesses effort—thus aging old-young does not exist, which is the razor pith.

[4536] 
[4537] 
[4538] 
[4539] 
[4540] 
[4541] The manner of Dharmakaya's abiding—
[4542] Who knows this body's key point,
[4543] Compatible with that, the yogin
[4544] Becomes pure in great bliss of Dharmakaya.
[4545] Thus it was spoken.
[4546] By performing the three bodies' postures,
[4547] One does not transgress the intent of the three bodies.
[4548] The hunched nirmanakaya—sign of future liberation through asceticism;
[4549] The elephant sambhogakaya—sign of future spontaneous liberation through non-action;
[4550] The lion dharmakaya—sign of future genuine fearless liberation.
[4551] Why does the elemental body's gaze
[4552] Transform into the three bodies' gaze?
[4553] The three bodies, luminous and clear, dwell in the heart's innate presence.
[4554] By making the gaze thus,
[4555] One manifests the three intents abiding within.
[4556] Since the three bodies exist as one's own constituents,
[4557] One's own gaze goes into the three bodies' gaze.
[4558] When cold elemental body harmonizes with nirmanakaya—balanced warmth;
[4559] When hot—with dharmakaya;
[4560] When balanced—with sambhogakaya—auspicious.
[4561] Particularly, vision increases swiftly.
[4562] If posture is not bent, awareness's self-resonance in body's channels
[4563] Does not arise; without raising it, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky.
[4564] Therefore gaze is precious.
[4565] Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness.  When dawn comes, ordinary abiding cannot increase;  Moreover, it decreases again. Therefore gaze is precious.  As snake's limbs, though in body, are not manifest—  Bend them and they appear—  So awareness dawns from gaze's key point.  Are postures limited to three only?  If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?
[4566] All sentient beings, led by three afflictions into three realms—
[4567] From that, liberation.
[4568] Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—
[4569] Therefore determined as three.
[4570] From the wheel of samsaric karma:
[4571] Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges;
[4572] Action and doer, speech chief, becoming;
[4573] When ripening into body, delight in speech,
[4574] Object chief, desire great,
[4575] Delight in desire comes.
[4576] To take that into the pure path,
[4577] Sambhogakaya posture is shown.
[4578] Such beings, always performing supreme sambhogakaya posture,
[4579] Become supreme experts in dharmata's meaning.
[4580] From samsara's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—
[4581] Pig emerges;
[4582] That same producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.
[4583] When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great,
[4584] Not delighting in speech,
[4585] Always delighting in sleep comes.
[4586] Always abiding in dharmakaya posture,
[4587] Determined to abide in dharmata for three times.
[4588] First, aversion impure ripening into form—
[4589] Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;
[4590] This, delighting in body action, desire to move,
[4591] Body strength great, body coarse,
[4592] Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.
[4593] Always abiding in nirmanakaya posture, determined to become buddha.
[4594] Therefore posture is determined as three.
[4595] Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,
[4596] Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.  More than that not needed;  Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.  At this time, speech main-point: cutting speech.
[4597] From Thalgyur:
[4598] Speech—training, abiding, swallowing—
[4599] Must be made firm.
[4600] Thus it was said.
[4601] First, speech training:
[4602] Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech;
[4603] Then train long;
[4604] Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone.
[4605] Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying;
[4606] Not mixing even one syllable with others.
[4607] At this time, body's sign makes meaning understood.
[4608] Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance;
[4609] Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—
[4610] Not even body sign.
[4611] From Seed Tantra:
[4612] Speech like a mute,
[4613] Not making sign with anyone,
[4614] Thus, whoever does this—
[4615] Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut.
[4616] Thus it was said.
[4617] Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind.
[4618] Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists.
[4619] By body purified, buddhas and bodhisattvas and sky-goer dakinis
[4620] Bless, liberating body into illusory body.
[4621] Then, object blocked, speech purified—
[4622] Sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes.
[4623] Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—
[4624] That sign: first seeing non-human form,
[4625] Then clairvoyance arises.
[4626] Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection.
[4627] Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.
[4628] From Thalgyur:
[4629] Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished.
[4630] Thus it was said.
[4631] Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—  Dhatu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut.  From Seed Tantra.
[4632] Thus binding body, speech, and three—
[4633] In dharmadhatu's vision,
[4634] This becomes habituation.
[4635] Thus it was said, and:
[4636] Body and speech and mind's main-point—
[4637] Know and rely, liberate from samsara.
[4638] Thus it was said.
[4639] Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are:
[4640] Bind three main-points in vajra seal;
[4641] Introduce awareness's own face directly;
[4642] Show vision's dawning manner from that.
[4643] First, two are:
[4644] Show general seal of three main-points,
[4645] Deliver particular self's main-point to point.
[4646] First: three main-points—gate, field, and wind-awareness.
[4647] From Thalgyur:
[4648] Three main-points—do not separate from instruction;
[4649] That also: gate and field itself,
[4650] Wind and awareness main-point itself seal.
[4651] Thus said.
[4652] Example: like weapon hitting vital point—
[4653] Channels or heart-meaning etcetera main-point hit,
[4654] Whatever done, not feeling, dying similar.
[4655] Three main-points also: dharmata no ground for change.
[4656] Gate main-point: cause to see;
[4657] Field main-point: cause not to change;
[4658] Wind-awareness main-point: deliver to sign-measure.
[4659] That also: gate main-point like threshold;
[4660] Field main-point like escort;
[4661] Wind-awareness main-point like bandit.
[4662] Arrow hit, person cannot change power, captured;
[4663] Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand—
[4664] Impossible not to hit dharmata direct main-point.
[4665] That also: field not existing, no basis ground;
[4666] Gate not existing, beings' path lost;
[4667] Wind-awareness main-point not existing, knowing-awareness does not penetrate inside—
[4668] Therefore three main-points determined.
[4669] More than that: limitless, lose main-point;
[4670] Few: meaning not accomplished—therefore three determined.
[4671] Second: deliver particular self's main-point to point:
[4672] Determine general sequence of three main-points,  Deliver individual main-points to point.  First: body, speech, mind three not moving,  Gate and field and wind-awareness bound.
[4673] Seeing differentiated by lineage scripture:
[4674] From Self-Arising Awareness Tantra,
[4675] Thus body, etcetera—
[4676] By fully pressing all main-points,
[4677] Awareness itself and directly,
[4678] From guru's instruction, know.
[4679] Thus said, and:
[4680] From Thalgyur:
[4681] Relying upon actual main, self mind,
[4682] Body main-point and speech and also,
[4683] Relying upon mind main-point,
[4684] Making wind somehow slow,
[4685] Arising from fully projecting,
[4686] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4687] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4688] Thus said, and:
[4689] Gate: look with three-bodies' eye;
[4690] Field: separate from obscuration-doer;
[4691] Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness.
[4692] Thus it was said.
[4693] Second: from three main-points—gate,
[4694] Field,
[4695] And wind-awareness.
[4696] First: wisdom does not dawn with ordinary gaze manner;
[4697] Train in three bodies' gaze manners.
[4698] From Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra:
[4699] By dharmakaya gaze manner,
[4700] Press and extract three-realms' samsara;
[4701] Sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground;
[4702] Nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field.
[4703] Thus said, and:
[4704] From Letterless:
[4705] Gaze eye at sky element.
[4706] Thus said, and:
[4707] From Secret Sound Tantra:
[4708] Lower, reverse, corner—three;
[4709] Gaze manner types three, famous.
[4710] Thus it was said.
[4711] That also: nirmanakaya, lower, buddha, looking at disciples;
[4712] Sambhogakaya, corner look, buddha, looking at field-realm;
[4713] Dharmakaya, reverse, buddha, looking at base.
[4714] Yogin with bad eye faculty:
[4715] Harmonizing with nirmanakaya gaze manner, eye not dim purpose exists.
[4716] Eye possessing fault:
[4717] Harmonizing with sambhogakaya, eye clear purpose exists.
[4718] Eye faculty good:
[4719] Harmonizing with dharmakaya mode, swift vision arrives at measure purpose exists.  Not moving from those, determined to realize within three-eyes.  Dharmakaya: dharmata eye existing in speech.
[4720] By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—
[4721] This same, certain.
[4722] Sambhogakaya: wisdom eye existing in body;
[4723] By that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands.
[4724] Nirmanakaya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart;
[4725] By that blessing, seeing separate from sound word,
[4726] Hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmata's meaning dawns within.
[4727] That also: three-eyes gaze,
[4728] Dharmata eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point.
[4729] Equal gaze at wisdom's corner,
[4730] Equal mixing samsara-nirvana taste—main-point.
[4731] Look with discriminating-awareness lowered,
[4732] Actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point.
[4733] What is three gaze manners' determination?
[4734] Lazy one: sambhogakaya;
[4735] Diligent one: nirmanakaya;
[4736] Equanimity one: dharmakaya gaze manner—auspicious;
[4737] Therefore three determined.
[4738] Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmata,
[4739] Gaze pure, obscuration exhausted;
[4740] Mode: liberating from samsara.
[4741] Second, field's main-point:
[4742] Outer dhatu's field: empty sky, separate from clouds.
[4743] Inner dhatu's field: gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot,
[4744] Dhatu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.
[4745] From Thalgyur:
[4746] Dhatu: outer and inner;
[4747] Outer: gaze at cloud-separate sky;
[4748] When dust and rain removed,  Press direct main-point, expert,  Make inner lamp the path.  Thus it was said.  That also: outer awareness dawning field;  Inner: experience increasing field.  Awareness and experience, from two not existing,  Called samsara-nirvana mixed.  That also: earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse—  Gaze at field, not liberate.  First: not desire vision dawn;  Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like,  Knowing also compatible with that arises,  Emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.
[4749] Gaze awareness at sky empty—
[4750] Field compatible with sky, experience empty,
[4751] Clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns.
[4752] Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristic.
[4753] From Mind Section:
[4754] Yogin abides in sky's bird-path.
[4755] Thus said, and:
[4756] From Collection:
[4757] Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning.
[4758] Thus said, and:
[4759] From Middle Mother:
[4760] Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
[4761] Is making sky-yogin, said, etc.—scriptures immeasurable.
[4762] That also: field outer-inner mixed,
[4763] Called equal limitless view;
[4764] Called dhatu-awareness non-dual view;
[4765] Called dhatu-awareness mixed, samsara-nirvana taste equal view.
[4766] This same, from Instruction-Child also:
[4767] Dhatu and awareness gaze manner,
[4768] Sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.
[4769] Thus spoken.
[4770] Third, wind-awareness main-point:
[4771] When field and gate two meet,
[4772] Rely on slow wind, called capturing awareness.
[4773] That also: somehow slow wind,
[4774] Shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point.
[4775] That also: wind and slow cause—
[4776] Outer: become yogin's life-extending helper;
[4777] Inner: make cause for conceptuality to cease;
[4778] Secret: do action of awareness direct seeing;
[4779] Actual: make buddha, not seeing contaminated.
[4780] That thus, also from Thalgyur:
[4781] Make wind somehow slow,
[4782] Arising from fully projecting,
[4783] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4784] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4785] Thus said, and:
[4786] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom,
[4787] Arising from fully projecting,
[4788] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4789] Not reversing even in three realms.  Thus said, and:  Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom.  Thus it was said.  Awareness main-point: hanging-cord, place in dhatu fence, make not move.
[4790] From that same:
[4791] Self-face awareness hanging-cord,
[4792] Capturing sky, separate from going-coming.
[4793] Thus said, and:
[4794] From Instruction-Child:
[4795] Hanging-cord inside dhatu,
[4796] Arrange place, do not separate.
[4797] Thus it was said.
[4798] That also: relying on slow wind,
[4799] Action separate meaning arises in mind;
[4800] Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead,
[4801] Conceptuality source exhausted from;
[4802] Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet.
[4803] Awareness, separate from wind, going-coming not existing—
[4804] Self-arisen awareness enters.
[4805] That also: if guide, rely on body main-point,
[4806] Do five-six days;
[4807] Then practice gate, only that much;
[4808] Then seek field, do six-seven days;
[4809] Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience.
[4810] That: very purified, meditation knowing arises;
[4811] Other: wrong not-wrong cause, see flickering vision,
[4812] No faith—when guide finishes, what to say? Nothing.
[4813] Various divinations arise near,
[4814] Therefore make pure those not gone thus.
[4815] That: general, when apply great guide,  Preliminary measure arrives,  Purify with diligence,  Actual main: faith, not ordinary, arises.  Actual main: hit point-delivery,  Direct delight, special arises.  Subsequent support: explain dharma end-cut,  Knowing capable of maintaining experience practice,  Doubt and conceptuality end,  Purpose exists: mind not desiring other dharma.  Second: introduce awareness self-face directly:  Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like,  With dhatu luminous-clear vision—  This, not-deluded buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance.  Look at state: all concept-doers pure,  Elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within—  Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent,  Meet face of transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom.
[4816] First Samantabhadra, equal capacity.
[4817] When this habituation arrives at measure—
[4818] Liberating with stone into light;
[4819] If not arrived, traverse bardo
[4820] Or nature-emanation field;
[4821] Cut six-realms' delusion precipice.
[4822] Thus introduce, and:
[4823] From Self-Arising Instruction:
[4824] Thus, whoever sees—this person,
[4825] First Samantabhadra,
[4826] Capacity itself is equal.
[4827] Thus said, and:
[4828] From Thalgyur:
[4829] Hanging-cord nature is:
[4830] By all conceptuality pure,
[4831] Base-buddha, not deluded.
[4832] Thus it was said.
[4833] Third: show vision's dawning manner from that:
[4834] Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning,
[4835] Bind tiny point to hanging-cord,
[4836] From first white-pure star-scatter like,
[4837] Point possessing five colors,
[4838] Each one,
[4839] Three-bind interval vision until that.
[4840] From previous:
[4841] Then see point.
[4842] Thus it was said.
[4843] That also: look at outer luminous-clear,
[4844] Inner conceptuality separate,
[4845] Equal limitless liberating;
[4846] Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance,
[4847] And spontaneous-completion light-resonance,
[4848] Two—outer-inner pair connect;
[4849] Called dhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent.
[4850] Third: vision four dawning sequence, two are:
[4851] Briefly show essence,
[4852] Extensively explain nature.
[4853] First: when all four visions,
[4854] Body abiding in posture,
[4855] Eye gazing at gaze manner,
[4856] Wind-awareness mode slow,
[4857] Three main-points harmonize.  Particularly: first two visions purify,  Later two not relying on effort,  Mode purify,  Liberate into luminous-clear,  Therefore called dhatu-awareness non-dual.  These main-points: arise from not doing—  Separate awareness vajra hanging-cord—main-point.  Explain that meaning:  Awareness—essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable,  Base-abide and that resonance,  From light channel pure vision,  Like golden thread coil,  Curve interval point bind.  Vajra: all buddhas and sentient beings,  Essence not existing good-bad,  Equal, unchanging,  Place in abiding part.
[4858] Lu: like good water channel,
[4859] Water emerges without increase or decrease.
[4860] Body and wisdom increase-opening,
[4861] Various path-visions until complete,
[4862] From that, dawning cause.
[4863] Gu: inside that,
[4864] Pull not-mistaken dharmata view and meditation.
[4865] Rgyud: pervading samsara-nirvana,
[4866] From those vision collections,
[4867] Body and
[4868] Point radiating and
[4869] Arising and
[4870] Gathering etcetera, clear cause.
[4871] From Thalgyur:
[4872] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom;
[4873] From that, vision becomes four:
[4874] By dharmata direct vision,
[4875] Suppress intellect-grasping view;
[4876] By experience-vision increasing above,
[4877] Cause delusion vision to cease;
[4878] By awareness measure-arriving vision,
[4879] Transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision;
[4880] By dharmata exhausting vision,
[4881] Cut three-realms' samsara stream.
[4882] Thus it was said.
[4883] That also: vision four number determined—
[4884] Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease;
[4885] Inner: body, speech, mind four, liberating from binding;
[4886] Secret: showing empowerment four determination;
[4887] Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.
[4888] Sequence determined:
[4889] First, base dharmata direct not see,
[4890] Remaining three dawning base not existing—  Basis and supported base,  First: dharmata direct vision dawning.  That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning,  Called self-arisen wisdom self-found.  Then: direct that, if not experience experience,  Word only, fruit not arise;  Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise.  Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure;  If not firm, experience no end,  Not possessing dharmas,  Buddha not arising cause;  Arrive at firm experience measure cause.
[4891] Awareness measure-arriving vision arises.
[4892] Though awareness vision arrives at measure,
[4893] If not changing from that to other,
[4894] Not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit,
[4895] Not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit
[4896] From actual vision-mark dharmas.
[4897] Vision-experience dissolves into base;
[4898] Subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases;
[4899] Experience dharmata exhaustion,
[4900] Dharmata-exhausting vision arises.
[4901] Those also: first two—nirmanakaya;
[4902] Measure-arriving—sambhogakaya;
[4903] Exhausting—dharmakaya vision.
[4904] Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn,
[4905] Arrive at fruit dharmata-exhausting pure dhatu—cause.
[4906] Self-vision potency dissolves
[4907] Into three-bodies' awareness mode;
[4908] Awareness pure fruit,
[4909] Originally from awareness dhatu,
[4910] Self-potency three-bodies dawn,
[4911] Called functioning fruit.
[4912] Vehicle other: name also not hear essence;
[4913] Vehicle king: called intent.
[4914] This main-point: difficult to realize, is one.
[4915] Second: extensively explain individual nature, four are:
[4916] Dharmata direct,
[4917] Experience increasing above,
[4918] Awareness measure-arriving,
[4919] Extensively explain dharmata-exhausting vision.  First, two are:  General direct connection place,  Identify self-characteristic.  First: general direct—conventional term famous direct,  And ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—two from;  First: sense-power direct—form etcetera, object five, vision nature,  And mind direct—object near enjoy, cause certain, conceptuality object in vision,  And self-awareness direct—within pleasure pain etcetera experience called vision,  And yogin's direct itself—meaning near meet, actual point enter,  Particular correct awareness and that vision-object non-dual state,  Grasp-hold-separate experience certainty.
[4920] From Clear-Meaning:
[4921] Gathering mind from all,
[4922] Inner self unmoving,
[4923] Though abide, eye forms—
[4924] Seeing mind is sense-born.
[4925] Thus explained, like:
[4926] Ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—
[4927] Awareness essence dharmata
[4928] Existing in heart, determine;
[4929] That self-resonance, heart-to-eye connect cause,
[4930] Like sun and light-ray,
[4931] Certain cause-effect, reasoning faith meet.
[4932] That reason: from world and transcend two,
[4933] This is transcend direct.
[4934] Transcend: object-know mind chief,
[4935] Mind cause certain,
[4936] And main-point seal see chief,
[4937] Awareness direct—two from,
[4938] This called awareness direct.
[4939] Second: identify self-characteristic,
[4940] Called dharmata direct vision.
[4941] Apply dharmata word near, four from:
[4942] Samsara dharmas,
[4943] Called this dharmata nirvana dharmata;
[4944] Vision dharmas,
[4945] Called this dharmata empty;
[4946] Dharmas not liberating from non-existing main-point,
[4947] Famous dharmata this dharmata existing liberating certain;
[4948] Dhatu dharmas,
[4949] Awareness dharmata famous,
[4950] Desire non-dual both.
[4951] Direct: actually see existing in sense-power activity field;
[4952] That also: not rely on intellect—
[4953] Intellect wisdom, whatever seek, time not existing to find;  Seeker not eye-possess,  Cause not luminous-clear form-possess.  From Collection:  Investigate wisdom, aggregates' bottom not find.  Thus it was said.  This luminous-clear vision, term-famous, not form-possess—  Subtle particle and coarse entity,  Self-characteristic this not existing cause,  Element-four harm, destroy, crush not possible cause;  Form-possess: existing destroy crush possible,  That cause form's characteristic.  Three enumeration: outer body, speech, mind three,  Establish base with main-point three.
[4954] Inner: dharmata field main-point;
[4955] Dawn cause: gate main-point;
[4956] Wind abiding: three main-points clear path,
[4957] Secret: habituation measure sequence,
[4958] Ripen: sign sequence,
[4959] Ultimate end: exhaust sequence,
[4960] And take measure with three,
[4961] Supreme vision.
[4962] Ripen: point;
[4963] Complete: body and three fruit complete cause;
[4964] Three group: four determine,
[4965] Therefore called three.
[4966] Or: dharmata three-bodies spontaneous-completion existing,
[4967] Self-resonance vision three,
[4968] Outer dawn number;
[4969] Dharmakaya self-resonance: inner experience awareness-empty;
[4970] Sambhogakaya self-resonance: light five outer clear,
[4971] Wisdom self-clear;
[4972] Nirmanakaya self-resonance: dawn liberation,
[4973] Equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three,
[4974] Rely therefore called three.
[4975] That also: base three establish base,
[4976] Entity not-existing difference main-point,
[4977] And path three clear obstacle,
[4978] Path not-existing near far,
[4979] And measure three deliver measure,
[4980] Not-existing similar different random,
[4981] And fruit three exhaust end deliver,
[4982] Not-existing yes-no doubt,
[4983] Therefore called direct.  Ordinary time: see three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity,  Dawn three—pleasure, pain, middle;  Guru instruction experience take time:  Direct see three—dhatu, awareness, dharmas.  Dharmata direct: main-point not-existing add intellect word;  Habituation time: main-point self-cease delusion vision,  See three-bodies' light point;  Measure arrive time: direct see three—clear, empty, pleasure;  Main-point: dharmata self-exhaust.  Thus: three enumeration place other rely,  Determine simultaneous liberate fruit.  Vision: whatever dawn, dharmata dawn;  Field: whatever dawn, dhatu dawn;  Manner: whatever dawn, light, light-house,  Awareness hanging-cord with dawn.  Buddha: not-seeing with stone,  Fruit: take that vision experience.  Thus: dharmata direct vision essence—  Dhatu awareness luminous-clear vision.
[4984] From Letterless:
[4985] Direct buddhas without birth,
[4986] See vision pure without field.
[4987] Thus said, and:
[4988] From Illusion:
[4989] Jewel, wish-fulfilling, desire-glory—
[4990] All buddhas' direct.
[4991] Thus it was said.
[4992] Definitive-meaning: see three-bodies' vision.
[4993] From Jewel Heap Tantra:
[4994] Direct called see;
[4995] Three called three-bodies;
[4996] Certain arrival at field realm.
[4997] Thus it was said.
[4998] Purpose: liberate without error obscuration, this main-point.
[4999] That same, from:
[5000] Dharmata direct main-point not existing—
[5001] Similar to going to precipice without eye.
[5002] Thus it was said.
[5003] Main-point from Thalgyur:
[5004] Main-point: arrow not moving;
[5005] Apply three gaze manners this time.
[5006] Thus said, and:
[5007] From Letterless:
[5008] Make fully place eye;
[5009] Dhatu emerges from eye corner itself;
[5010] Gaze eye at sky element.
[5011] Thus it was said.
[5012] Vision is:
[5013] From Thalgyur:
[5014] Dharmata direct vision is;
[5015] Certain emerge from sense-power gate;
[5016] Clear in sky without clouds.
[5017] Thus said, and:
[5018] Also channel and delusion-wheel:
[5019] Five wisdoms abide in nature,
[5020] See bubble by eye.
[5021] Thus said, and:
[5022] From Self-Dawn:
[5023] Body of light possessing five wisdoms,
[5024] Fully clear in hanging-cord,
[5025] That also: go and come,
[5026] Move and shake.
[5027] Thus said, and:
[5028] From Lion Power Complete:
[5029] That entity of self-vision awareness
[5030] Abides in wisdom hanging-cord.
[5031] Thus said, and:
[5032] From Jewel Display:
[5033] Said: arrow, water lamp—fully perfect buddha,
[5034] Awareness hanging-cord body fully clear.
[5035] Manner of taking experience:
[5036] First: many number short sessions;
[5037] Second: extend session, extend duration;  Third: take experience without day-night,  Make awareness not move, place in dhatu fence.
[5038] From Blazing Lamp:
[5039] Dhatu makes awareness's self-field;
[5040] Vajra itself is hanging-cord;
[5041] Make place this inside.
[5042] Thus it was said.
[5043] Fruit is:
[5044] When outer dhatu-vision, eye not moving, self time;
[5045] Inner: awareness abiding in base,
[5046] Cause resonance to dissolve from self, circle;
[5047] Separate lung wind horse cause;
[5048] Wisdom sky dissolves into dhatu sky,
[5049] Cause equal limitless liberation;
[5050] Pure awareness, not moving in dhatu,
[5051] Abides in nature of luminous-clear intent,
[5052] Heart-in mode.
[5053] That yogin: called capturing original dharmata luminous-clear,
[5054] From samsara name empty,
[5055] Three-realms corpse cut is.
[5056] From Thalgyur:
[5057] That dharmata direct main-point:
[5058] Know by seeing only,
[5059] And realize by that knowing,
[5060] Become liberate by realizing only.
[5061] Liberate called: not untie.
[5062] Sky in sky,
[5063] Dissolve nature not-aim cause,
[5064] Equal limitless, not possessing part.
[5065] Capacity-possess find direct:
[5066] Three-realms samsara name empty cause,
[5067] Three-realms corpse cut.
[5068] Thus it was said.
[5069] Second: from two—experience increasing above vision:
[5070] Briefly show:
[5071] Above above purify dhatu awareness cause;
[5072] Outer: like non-dual abiding of awareness hanging-cord in dhatu-vision;
[5073] Inner: non-dual abiding of awareness dhatu,
[5074] Self-resonance in pure empty dhatu,
[5075] Cause luminous-clear mother-son mix;
[5076] Experience vision increases various.
[5077] From Thalgyur:
[5078] Experience vision increasing above is:
[5079] From wisdom color outer emerge,  Up-stand and wing dawn,  Various points, body itself,  Clear in coarse vision field.  Thus it was said.  Extensively explain:  Two are experience called experience increasing above—  Knowing experience,  And vision experience.  Knowing experience: worldly knowing experience,  Samadhi-obtained pleasure happiness,  Mind desiring song, dance, etcetera,  Heart desire.
[5080] Transcend knowing experience—
[5081] Empty, clear, extreme separate,
[5082] Realize measure with discriminating-awareness potency.
[5083] This same: from habituation of first, middle, end—
[5084] Knowing pleasure happiness experience,
[5085] And end change experience,
[5086] And vision experience, three arise.
[5087] First is:
[5088] Bind body speech main-point,
[5089] Wind mind relax from latency;
[5090] Inner samadhi pervades luminous-clear empty state,
[5091] And spacious knowing, grasp-hold not-existing,
[5092] Pleasure happiness vast, arise spread-desire,
[5093] Though not-existing attachment grasp, even hair-tip,
[5094] Arise from arriving at nature meditation main-point.
[5095] Fabricated meditation: pleasure happiness arise,
[5096] Great experience change,
[5097] Coarse throb or song dance desire arise,
[5098] Cause attachment grasp to go.
[5099] This: though dawn pleasure happiness,
[5100] Also self-power obtain pleasure happiness,
[5101] Grasp not-existing, knowing difference existing,
[5102] Fabricated meditate.
[5103] Know difference of meditation arriving at nature wind.
[5104] End change experience: wind experience vision part is:
[5105] Like firefly,
[5106] Like cloud,
[5107] Like smoke,
[5108] Like haze,
[5109] Like moon dawn,
[5110] Like star dawn,
[5111] Like sky brightening, blue vision existing,  Like sun dawn, outer inner unimpeded vision—  Eight.  Become clear dim and dawn cease cause:  Not firm, cannot stand, change go—  Called end change experience,  Cause is wind moving experience.  These do existing, need purify wind mind.  Vision experience is:  Great awareness self-resonance luminous-clear.  Occasion: outer vision increases,  From arriving at measure;  Self-resonance dissolves into base,  Reverse inner, only outer clear need;  Cause need dissolve into spontaneous-completion pure dhatu.  Inner clear: in self-light expanse,  Awareness body wisdom palace,  Originally abide spontaneous-completion great,  Not-existing change.  Therefore here: vision experience is chief.
[5112] Knowing experience: is intellect,
[5113] Change, cannot stand measure,
[5114] All-conceptual conventional appearance possessor,
[5115] Remember doer difference,
[5116] Near-side concept gather cause.
[5117] Do measure this: similar to bird
[5118] Doing hide cover, place measure in cloud.
[5119] Time not existing to realize meaning,
[5120] See self-point not arrive.
[5121] This: vision experience,
[5122] See wisdom five color vision,
[5123] Transcend half end of samsara action,
[5124] Grasp field vision.
[5125] See dhatu vision: that above,
[5126] Not existing grasp concept part half,
[5127] Grasp empty extreme wrong cause,
[5128] Transcend two-thirds samsara part.
[5129] Self-purify all-concept base ground,
[5130] Grasp part half,
[5131] Grasp vision self-characteristic wrong cause,
[5132] Called person and dharmas grasp-hold self not-existing concept.
[5133] Briefly: all vision experiences—
[5134] Wisdom five color vision,
[5135] And dhatu vision,
[5136] Two gather.
[5137] Above increase is:
[5138] Go those visions more beautiful, more good, more many.
[5139] General show this purify manner,
[5140] And particular explain vision manner—two from:
[5141] First is:
[5142] Apply samsara liberate manner from binding;
[5143] That vision: up-stand,
[5144] And wing dawn,
[5145] And boat-part,
[5146] And part,  And cloth vision—five complete,  From obtaining power of wisdom five color.  Liberate from binding:  Five manifest move—desire,  Aversion,  Delusion,  Pride,  Jealousy.  Cause not existing other than latency only,  Itself transcend samsara half.  Then: net form,  And net half,  And eye many line,  And like eye spot form,  And see like canopy tent house—  Transcend from self made by form etcetera aggregate five collection.  Transcend world self three two,  Pure blessing of dharmata view.  Then: wisdom entity pure shape vision.
[5147] Like wisdom palace shape,
[5148] And like sun-moon pair connect form,
[5149] And like lotus stack form,
[5150] And like stupa stack form,
[5151] And see like lotus thousand-possess form—
[5152] Transcend element five binding cause.
[5153] Those also: called experience one-arise one-cease;
[5154] That also: called above increase,
[5155] Cause become difference from previous.
[5156] Thus: awareness cause arise,
[5157] Arise from previously relying on empowerment sequence.
[5158] Second: particular explain vision manner:
[5159] From two—wisdom five color vision,
[5160] And shape vision.
[5161] First is:
[5162] Fully purify vajra family cause:
[5163] Mirror-like wisdom self-light,
[5164] Dawn white color form;
[5165] That same vajra unmovable resonance,
[5166] Pierce white, dawn.
[5167] Below that: fully purify tathagata family cause:
[5168] Dhatu wisdom, dawn blue color form;
[5169] Display resonance, dawn blue-black.
[5170] Fully purify jewel family cause:
[5171] Equality color yellow cloth,
[5172] And very pierce Jewel Source resonance,
[5173] Like refined gold, dawn.
[5174] Fully purify lotus family cause:
[5175] Discriminate wisdom color red cloth,
[5176] And very red Infinite resonance,  Like coral color, dawn.  Fully purify karma family cause:  Action accomplish wisdom,  Dawn green color cloth;  Very green Actual Accomplish resonance,  Like indranila form, dawn.  Those: outer sequence, blue vajra fence all surround is:  Show wisdom those not-existing difference.  That-from vision increase:  Five five clear, each chief color five light.
[5177] Arise from family and family difference.
[5178] Then: fully purify wisdom wind cause,
[5179] Mirror-like condition up-stand vision is;
[5180] Arise experience increase, rely that.
[5181] Equality wing dawn vision is:
[5182] Near itself, delusion vision exhaust.
[5183] Then: discriminate boat-part vision is:
[5184] Time element subtle cease.
[5185] Action accomplish victory-banner form only vision is:
[5186] Arise from wisdom self-resonance individual clear.
[5187] Then: dhatu wisdom field boat-only vision is:
[5188] Arise from coarse conceptuality cease.
[5189] Those path arise sequence is:
[5190] To great diligence: interval five five days;
[5191] To middle: seven seven days;
[5192] To low: twenty-one twenty-one days,
[5193] From previous vision ceasing,
[5194] Also form dawn below vision those.
[5195] Here interval color and shape: arise abide moment.
[5196] Then: from those ceasing,
[5197] Also dawn wisdom five shape form;
[5198] Become like mirror-like shape eye spot form.
[5199] Arise cause: very good increase that color.
[5200] Habituation that: dawn eye many line.
[5201] Arise cause: this preliminary measure arrive.
[5202] Then: dawn equality net half.
[5203] Arise cause: that wind purify pure.
[5204] That-from: arise preliminary pure complete net vision.
[5205] Then: dawn discriminate flower heap.
[5206] Arise cause: gaze manner effort.
[5207] That-from: dawn lotus thousand-possess,  Arise cause preliminary purify.  Then: dawn action accomplish weapon like.  Arise cause: nature not-fabricate.  That-from: arise various wheel etcetera form vision,  Arise cause preliminary complete.  Then: dawn dhatu wisdom palace.
[5208] Arise from drawing awareness from eye.
[5209] That-from: arise like canopy tent house,
[5210] Arise cause preliminary pure make.
[5211] Those also: difference of diligence,
[5212] Day three,
[5213] Seven,
[5214] Fourteen: one-arise one-cease.
[5215] That beyond: experience increasing above vision.
[5216] These: mind preliminary time,
[5217] Sign is that cease raise conceptuality difference.
[5218] Then: dawn awareness self-essence vision;
[5219] Light those dawn point,
[5220] Arise cause gather hanging-cord one.
[5221] Then: two points connect vision,
[5222] Arise cause fully purify method discriminating-awareness.
[5223] Then: five points connect vision,
[5224] Arise cause five wisdoms enter.
[5225] Direct: manner not different point connect,
[5226] Cause small existing.
[5227] That beyond: experience increasing above vision.
[5228] From Thalgyur:
[5229] Also light of color five:
[5230] Vision boat-part only victory-banner;
[5231] Measure see field boat-only.
[5232] Thus said, and:
[5233] From Self-Arising Tantra:
[5234] Thus see self-face:
[5235] From upper joint finger-four,
[5236] Separate good-capacity person—
[5237] How possible enter samsara?
[5238] Whatever dawn form boat-part,
[5239] This accomplish emanation quality;
[5240] Whatever dawn only field see,
[5241] Same is heap;
[5242] Whatever is outer vision cease,
[5243] Sixteen moment;
[5244] This also thus become.
[5245] Thus it was said.
[5246] Third: awareness measure-arriving vision,  General show vision manner,  And particular explain nature—two from:  First is:  Then: in each point, dawn each body half,  Arise cause nirmanakaya fully purify purify;  Then: dawn each body self-only,  Arise cause nirmanakaya vision, dharmata direct see;  Then: those bodies become father-mother five five,  Itself sambhogakaya wisdom measure arrive;  Then: vision with individual heap mandala.
[5247] The peripheral walls of that very mandala, together with the individual principal retinues that appear therein, arise through the purification of the Dharmakaya reaching its full measure.
[5248] These are the visions of awareness arriving at its measure—the signs that actions and activities of the body during the preliminary phase, together with their connections, will not arise again in future.
[5249] Although these visions appear through reaching the vital points of the preliminary phase and other antidotes that purify each defilement to be purified, they are merely designated as the causal result of separation and the causal relationship between what purifies and what is purified. They do not arise from being produced by that, for wisdom's self-existing resonance appears through the force of purifying the obscurations of defilement.
[5250] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5251] The vision of awareness arriving at its measure—
[5252] The marks and examples of Sambhogakaya clearly manifest
[5253] From the rainbow lights of indeterminate color
[5254] The five families appear as fathers and mothers.
[5255] From the Bstan bu:
[5256] From such bodies up to their limit,
[5257] Six, ten, and five-three—
[5258] Without doubt, this is Sambhogakaya.
[5259] Second, the explanation of the nature in particular has two parts:
[5260] The general explanation of the definition of "arriving at measure," and
[5261] The particular explanation of the three measures.
[5262] The first: "Awareness arriving at measure" means
[5263] The awareness of the basis-abide becoming manifest,
[5264] Having entered the path-tradition,
[5265] Through the body-visions of the spontaneously accomplished self-resonance of basis-vision dawning,
[5266] The path-visions approach exhaustion,
[5267] And the mandalas become complete.
[5268] "Measure" is from the first half-body up to the completion of the body-mandala.
[5269] "Arrive" means there is no place beyond that—complete manifestation.
[5270] These are like the form of the full moon,
[5271] The mandala complete through the waxing and waning, without fabrication upon self-essence.
[5272] Second, the explanation of the three measures in particular has three parts:
[5273] Outer visions,
[5274] Inner body measure,
[5275] Secret awareness measure.
[5276] The first is controlling the visions and the completion of the realms in luminous clarity.
[5277] 
[5278] 
[5279] 
[5280] 
[5281] 
[5282] 
[5283] 
[5284] 
[5285] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5286] The measure of completion having thus arrived—
[5287] Direct objective visions cease,
[5288] The vision of earth and stones melts away,
[5289] Self-knowing enters into everything,
[5290] Inert things move when directed,
[5291] The measure of wind's movement is grasped,
[5292] The body's dust-particles become visible.
[5293] Whatever appears becomes complete as form-bodies,
[5294] From that fathers and mothers embrace,
[5295] The five and five fathers and mothers unite,
[5296] All within the round periphery—
[5297] The yogin's body also luminous,
[5298] Appearing to go, come, and sit.
[5299] All is awareness arriving at its measure.
[5300] Second:
[5301] Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white A, five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window, piercing into the light-star-window within the intermediate space.
[5302] Rising through the crown, wisdom wind abides, appearing naturally uplifted.
[5303] From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly.
[5304] Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil.
[5305] Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth, outer and inner parts smaller than the scope of dust-particles, each containing numberless lands and realms, measureless Buddhas and beings appear—these are all visions of the spontaneously accomplished eight doors dawning here, appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.
[5306] In the crown-palace, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala.
[5307] In all parts of the body, natural emanations,
[5308] Emanations taming beings,
[5309] Various emanations appear, doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields.
[5310] Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and
[5311] The wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn.
[5312] Through the door of pure wisdom, the pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakaya.
[5313] The mind's defilements purified, obtaining the separation from dust and doubt,
[5314] The latencies of ground and grounds self-purify. From the Thal 'gyur:
[5315] 
[5316] The body arriving at measure also becomes thus:
[5317] Free from the dust of individual bodies,
[5318] The light-star-window of intermediate space appears.
[5319] Then light-rays in the shape of hooks,
[5320] Subtle and coiling, hold the vision.
[5321] The body's dust naturally ceasing,
[5322] The copper-shining stainless light-body.
[5323] The A mark in the center,
[5324] And the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure.
[5325] The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing.
[5326] From the peaceful body's fingers,
[5327] Light-garlands coil in form.
[5328] Activity of silent mind,
[5329] From the skull palace of the head,
[5330] Herukas manifestly arise.
[5331] At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—
[5332] The copper-shining three bodies coil as one.
[5333] Third, the secret awareness measure:
[5334] Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified,
[5335] There exists merely the all-ground consciousness mind,
[5336] Dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye.
[5337] From that itself:
[5338] At this time the mind is clear,
[5339] Together with the six clairvoyances,
[5340] Far and concealed
[5341] Dharmas become known in a moment.
[5342] Measureless Buddha-realms and
[5343] Likewise bodies appear to mind.
[5344] Defilements exhaust in empty mind,
[5345] Nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity.
[5346] Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse,
[5347] Through manifest clarity, not separate from the many.
[5348] Without parts, without elaboration.
[5349] That also: in the two upper visions, purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness,
[5350] At the time of obtaining this, through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections,
[5351] Free from subtle and coarse defilements,
[5352] The body-mind connection cut,
[5353] Outer visions' objects appear to awareness.
[5354] The investigating agent consciousness part, acting as self-condition through the power of all-ground consciousness,
[5355] Like a shooting star moving in the sky, the momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing, pure without looking to separate antidotes.
[5356] 
[5357] 
[5358] At the time of the two upper visions, wind is thrown outward and not held inward,
[5359] Arising through the ability to purify conceptuality not abiding in two moments,
[5360] The body copper-shining,
[5361] The all-ground consciousness part clear-vivid like fire-sparks of concept-free object-awareness emitting.
[5362] Seeing the two aspects of outer extending vision and inner self-vision, body and mind separate and cut,
[5363] Accomplishing the great mandala, the supreme ground of not returning outward to the three realms.
[5364] Again from the Thal 'gyur:
[5365] At all times of such vision,
[5366] The cutting of body-mind connection,
[5367] From the contaminated exhausted body also,
[5368] The mind with clear characteristics arising outward,
[5369] Like a shooting star emitting,
[5370] Clearly seen in the realm of space.
[5371] At the first times of that itself,
[5372] From separation from wind also,
[5373] Through the action of pure wind, effortful,
[5374] Arising from throwing outward from the body.
[5375] From the part of the two see-agents also,
[5376] The body luminous and pure,
[5377] The mind like fire-sparks emitting,
[5378] Not abiding as one, self-clear basis,
[5379] Arising in the manner of two vision aspects.
[5380] Through this, having cut body-mind connection,
[5381] There is no returning to the three realms.
[5382] At this time, the see-agent also, like a shooting star or fire-sparks, the all-ground consciousness part,
[5383] Together with the compassion-wisdom part of awareness,
[5384] Arise as the wisdom part seeing the two outer and inner objects.
[5385] At this time there is no intentionally setting gaze manner etc. through antidote,
[5386] For one never passes beyond the wheel of dharmata.
[5387] This is called "completion of practice measure."
[5388] Fourth, the dharmata-exhausting vision has two parts:
[5389] Brief showing of exhaustion manner, and
[5390] Extensive explanation of nature.
[5391] First:
[5392] From the vision like the full moon of previous measure-arrival,
[5393] The manner of self-resonance dissolving into the expanse,
[5394] Like the moon waning from that,
[5395] Again that body fading until reaching the bindu, certain vision to the first mind.
[5396] That applies in sequence to the manner of purifying the four visions through the fourfold sequence of container-contents' arising, abiding, destruction, and emptiness.
[5397] 
[5398] Similar to the increase and decrease of the four—birth, aging, sickness, and death—
[5399] The outer container's arising manner dissolves, and
[5400] The inner contents' beings' life measure rising and
[5401] Waning downward—the sign of exhaustion.
[5402] If these do not exhaust, the self is not free from the three realms.
[5403] Thus, through the exhaustion of the outer container world,
[5404] Support-ground not existing,
[5405] The vital point of no ground of return.
[5406] Through the exhaustion of inner contents' beings, the birth continuum cut,
[5407] Now awareness itself is separate from death.
[5408] Then, whatever essence vision may have, there is no establishment,
[5409] Difficult to express as "this is" or "this is not,"
[5410] Therefore called "dharmata exhaustion"—the meaningful result.
[5411] The result: difficult for a person to express "this is" or "this is not," for it is inconceivable.
[5412] Moreover, dharma exhaustion: at the time of measure-arrival, the dharmas of outer objects, inner body, together with dust, exhausted—here, the dharmas included by the all-ground consciousness mind exhausted,
[5413] And purifying the root non-awareness that abides as the dharmata of the three doors of the all-ground part.
[5414] Depending upon the dharmas of delusion,
[5415] That luminosity of vision without arising or destruction, abiding as ultimate dharmata,
[5416] Through the exhaustion of those two dharmatas, is called "dharmata exhaustion."
[5417] Vision: when that previous spontaneously accomplished vision, existing, dissolves inward, part by part going,
[5418] The primordially pure vision, like a cloudless sky, momentarily abiding naturally pure, is called "vision"—
[5419] Not like vision as entity and characteristic.
[5420] At this time, there is no reference even to mere dharmas—dharmata exhaustion.
[5421] The dharma-possessor object and
[5422] The dharmata's emptiness, the holding part, included by the object-possessor,
[5423] The time of return of the three realms' mind, mental-events, together with all-ground.
[5424] The manner of exhaustion:
[5425] Gradual and
[5426] Instantaneous, from the two.
[5427] Gradual exhaustion is at the time of the four visions arriving at measure.
[5428] Instantaneous exhaustion is through habituating having seen dharmata manifestly at first.
[5429] There is also exhaustion without the arising of visions of increasing experience and so forth—
[5430] This is called "supreme instantaneous mind."
[5431] Moreover, merely through each act of respect for the guru, greater than others, possessed of the potential of previously purified action—such an exhaustion manner merely exists.
[5432] Second, the extensive explanation of nature has five parts:
[5433] Essence,
[5434] Definition,
[5435] Nature,
[5436] Dharmata,
[5437] Boundary.
[5438] The essence of dharmata exhaustion:
[5439] Outer lights-five vision, together with bodies, exhausted;
[5440] Inner dust, together with concepts and aggregates, exhausted;
[5441] Experience vision objects exhausted,
[5442] Awareness abiding in a manner like the sky, the primordially pure vision.
[5443] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5444] The vision of dharmata exhaustion—
[5445] Experience vision emptying,
[5446] Body exhausted, sense objects also exhausted,
[5447] Free from concepts, aggregates, and delusion,
[5448] Separate from words of expressive basis.
[5449] Definition:
[5450] "Dharma" means the dharmas of body, speech, and mind aggregates, together with afflictions.
[5451] "Itself" is together with the part of meditating the luminosity vision of the purifying path.
[5452] "Exhaust" is "empty,"
[5453] Mind's meditation, together with object-vision, self-reversing, not existing—
[5454] Called "non-observation."
[5455] From that itself:
[5456] Thus the certain definition of dharmata—
[5457] To the gathering of dharma-knowing aggregates,
[5458] Doing actions and holding characteristics,
[5459] Making self-vision empty,
[5460] Holding individual families.
[5461] "Itself" is to the unfabricated,
[5462] Pervading the real through natural abiding,
[5463] To the unfabricated, original, continuous,
[5464] Exhausting the numbers of sounds, words, and names.
[5465] Nature:
[5466] Outer and inner vision-mind exhausted, activity merely upon primordially pure self-resonance like the resonance of blue-grey sky.
[5467] From the Rtsal rdzogs:
[5468] At this time, the characteristic of exhaustion—
[5469] Like the sky, free from action.
[5470] Dharmata has two parts:
[5471] The dharmata of vision:
[5472] Through the exhaustion of outer and inner dust, channels and winds exhaust.
[5473] Through that exhaustion, the subtle defilements, the seed-parts of latencies depending upon mind, with the characteristic of arising from all, also exhaust.
[5474] 
[5475] 
[5476] 
[5477] Abiding in the samadhi of continuity, not passing beyond the wheel of dharmata,
[5478] Controlling the great eye and clairvoyance, obtaining the power as regent of the dharma king of the three realms.
[5479] The all-ground subtle knowable obscurations very cut—except for being cut by merely a white silk curtain, there are no obscurations.
[5480] This is called "the result of path dharmas exhaustion."
[5481] Having cleared that, separation from all Buddha-obscurations, entering the primordially pure dharmakaya of the inner expanse, the very peace.
[5482] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5483] The dharmata of self-Buddha cessation:
[5484] Elements ceasing, dust ceases,
[5485] Dust and particles ultimately cease,
[5486] Not even a mere part abides.
[5487] Afflictions ceasing, delusion and
[5488] Concept-free attachment not abiding,
[5489] Latencies and all-arising
[5490] Not even dust-parts abide.
[5491] Thus through subtle and coarse cessation,
[5492] The five aggregates also gradually subtle at the end,
[5493] The body of four elements exhausted,
[5494] All is wisdom, Sambhogakaya.
[5495] Concept-free samadhi self-abiding,
[5496] Having exceeded the aggregates of fabrication,
[5497] "Dharma" does not abide in words.
[5498] The empty dharmata:
[5499] Through the exhaustion of coarse channels and winds, mind and mental-events exhaust.
[5500] The vision aspect of body and wisdom, like the measure-arrived full moon, also setting into the inner expanse, abiding in primordially pure vision,
[5501] This is expressed as "the dharmakaya vision, the core result dharmata, self-vision."
[5502] Again from the previous:
[5503] The dharmata of cause and result:
[5504] Coarse conceptuality source ceasing,
[5505] Memory self-pure from the continuum also,
[5506] Dependent-arising wind itself fully pure,
[5507] The dharmata arising from cause.
[5508] To the primordially pure nature,
[5509] The numbers of one and many exhaust,
[5510] Body and wisdom non-existent,
[5511] Arriving at the ground of exhausted dharmas—
[5512] Considered to be the result dharmata.
[5513] Moreover, delusion regarding these three later words.
[5514] 
[5515] 
[5516] Nyingtigpas who think that in the result primordially pure there is no body and wisdom having arisen—
[5517] That is a great error.
[5518] They have not understood the intention of that being said regarding the part like the resonance body and wisdom of outer vision, crystal light returning inward.
[5519] If in meaning there is nothing in the inner expanse, it contradicts spontaneous accomplishment;
[5520] Being unconditioned, it contradicts going to complete non-existence in the future;
[5521] It contradicts the arising of benefit for beings from the basis of dawn of body and wisdom from the expanse;
[5522] It contradicts Samantabhadra, having arrived at the end of pure basis expanse, showing the compassion and action of showing the path to beings and Buddhas—such faults exist in great number.
[5523] Such faults are not suitable to accept.
[5524] Fifth, the boundary:
[5525] At the time of beginning exhaustion from the measure-arrived curtain, there merely exists the clarity of five lights in the fingers of one's own four hands and feet,
[5526] The occasion from which there is outward entry into the inner expanse and
[5527] The boundary of inward return to outer vision.
[5528] Moreover, although that body form does not actually arise extensively as benefit for beings at this time,
[5529] Focusing awareness upon the light of the fingers,
[5530] Outer visions and
[5531] The luminosity of one's own body increasingly dissolve and go into the inner expanse,
[5532] From merely the pure blue of direct objective vision,
[5533] Like light-body fading and crystal light dissolving inward,
[5534] The self-resonance of body and vision also reverses,
[5535] Awareness abiding merely upon the depth resonance of body and wisdom within the shell of inner clear spontaneously accomplished jewel,
[5536] Like a shadow abiding in the self-lucidity of a crystal mirror, without even a mere part of vision in the blue of outer vision,
[5537] Awareness buddha-fied into dharmakaya, coiled.
[5538] If returning inward to outer vision, the sign that that body does not accomplish the equal of Buddha action,
[5539] Moreover, through control of birth and entry, awareness focusing compassion upon beings, that primordially pure vision without anything, self-reversing.
[5540] This vision of delusion-vision appears like a mirror's reflection,
[5541] And that self-body also, like the moon in water, self-appears as wisdom illusory body through copper-shining, free from elemental harm, obtaining the vajra body—
[5542] Called "arising as the great transfer body for the benefit of beings."
[5543] Others' impure eyes see merely dust together, not the copper-shining—
[5544] Like the great master Vimala and
[5545] Padma.
[5546] Then, having obtained control over birth and entry,
[5547] Although buddha-fied in a moment, there is delay,
[5548] Yet doing the benefit of beings until samsara is not empty, possessing self-power.
[5549] Control over birth:
[5550] At the occasion of entering the inner expanse, entering awareness into three thousand beings, obtaining the great power to free all simultaneously,
[5551] Even insects cease into light.
[5552] Having obtained control over birth, emanating whatever is desired, spontaneously accomplishing the benefit of beings.
[5553] Control over entry:
[5554] Although entering awareness into inert things, making them move and emit sound,
[5555] Through the dharma sound arising from lotus, wishing tree, jewel, and so forth, ripening all beings,
[5556] Making rain of food and clothes.
[5557] Moreover, having obtained these two controls over birth and entry following exhaustion at the occasion not-there of entering the inner expanse,
[5558] If not returning inward for beings' benefit, having made three thousand beings in the bardo free instantaneously, entering the expanse;
[5559] If doing, through control over birth, returning inward, gradually making three thousand free,
[5560] Doing whatever benefit for beings through many births and entries for kalpas numbering the dust of fields.
[5561] Through earth treasures,
[5562] Jewels,
[5563] Dharma classifications, and so forth—although benefit may be accomplished after a long time, there is not even a moment's passing in that means,
[5564] For compassion wonder arises from others and activity vision enters.
[5565] Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara, such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt in this life or the bardo.
[5566] This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra:
[5567] When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion,
[5568] Fingers and so forth appear thus.
[5569] Focusing this, elements naturally cease.
[5570] Through the difference of birth and entry,
[5571] Upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted,
[5572] Without holding anything whatsoever,
[5573] One abides—this is the emanation body.
[5574] Through this, the power of entry's force,
[5575] Who has obtained self-power over birth,
[5576] Also focusing upon that,
[5577] Again at times doing thus,
[5578] The self-sound of vision rustling,
[5579] Manifestly reverses, appearing as delusion.
[5580] Through this, doing all benefit for beings,
[5581] For awareness is equal and one,
[5582] The great transfer of three thousand
[5583] Beings is accomplished by this.
[5584] Thus through gradual and instantaneous,
[5585] The body is accomplished by this.
[5586] All that is free from body-exhaustion measure.
[5587] All this, certain result,
[5588] Accomplishes the great mandala, supreme ground.
[5589] Thus the dawning of the four visions is called "the sequence of path-arising"—
[5590] Like the rungs of a ladder.
[5591] That also: from the part of abiding in the path, the dawn-agent does not cease;
[5592] From the part of obtaining the path, nothing whatsoever is unestablished.
[5593] Thus, through the four visions arriving at measure, buddha-fying without contaminated vision in this itself,
[5594] Especially sublime from the common vehicles,
[5595] Having met this dharma, one should make effort to practice with diligence.
[5596] Upon that itself:
[5597] For a person desiring to accomplish Buddhahood,
[5598] If possessing this means, it is thus.
[5599] For other conduct is pride itself,
[5600] Not seeing entity.
[5601] Therefore this is all rare words—
[5602] Always look to this jewel treasure.
[5603] Fourth meaning: the four instructions of extreme reliance are the back-support or closely-arisen support of the above.
[5604] 
[5605] 
[5606] That also: establishing basis through three unmoving in speech,
[5607] Holding measure through three vows,
[5608] Striking nails through three obtains,
[5609] Showing measure of freedom through four confidences.
[5610] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5611] Upon that, one should have faith in extreme reliance.
[5612] Through establishing basis in three unmoving,
[5613] Wind-mind arrives at the vital point.
[5614] Through holding measure with three abidings,
[5615] Reversing dreams and body, speech, and mind,
[5616] Certain holding of signs and measure.
[5617] Through striking nails with three obtains,
[5618] Contaminated aggregates not visible.
[5619] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5620] Measure is the yoga of four confidences.
[5621] First, sealing the basis of nirvana through establishing basis with three unmoving:
[5622] Pressing the vital with three body-unmoving,
[5623] Clearing the path with three speech-unmoving,
[5624] Coiling wrapped in the gorge with three mind-unmoving.
[5625] First, to the three body-unmoving:
[5626] Bringing vital channels through pervading posture-unmoving,
[5627] Straightening the path through dawn-agent gaze-unmoving,
[5628] Blocking wind's going and coming through bind-draw unmoving.
[5629] First:
[5630] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5631] The body's vitals are these three:
[5632] The lion manner and elephant manner,
[5633] Know like a rishi.
[5634] Regarding the emanation body posture:
[5635] Sound explanation and
[5636] Meaning division, from the two.
[5637] First:
[5638] Body straight makes channels straight,
[5639] Stretching made unmoving, wind arises continuously,
[5640] Through that, various conceptualities cease.
[5641] The "like" is by example: like the manner of meditating samadhi of rishis Agastya and Vashistha at Meru's side.
[5642] Regarding meaning division, from the two:
[5643] First, the vital of setting continuity:
[5644] Pressing the two foot-heels draws the essence of method and wisdom,
[5645] Pressing the foot-soles to the earth empties the action of emitting and gathering wind, and makes wisdom-heat descend into the body.
[5646] Sitting with the body generally hunched closes the channel-mouth of consciousness entry.
[5647] 
[5648] 
[5649] 
[5650] Stretching the body parts makes the body consciousness naturally slow.
[5651] Joining knee and chest draws ability of wisdom from the body's elements.
[5652] Crossing the hands at armpit or atop the knee ends the limits of action and latency.
[5653] Second, the vital of resting wisdom:
[5654] If conceptuality emits and bliss does not arise, do thus:
[5655] Joining knee and chest, sitting hunched,
[5656] There is need to reverse the emitting action-wind.
[5657] Through that reversal, outer various bodies appear,
[5658] Mind abides inward.
[5659] Pressing the foot-soles to the earth reverses life-effort action-wind.
[5660] Through that reversal, heat arises in the outer body,
[5661] Experience of unborn dharmata arises inward.
[5662] Embracing and stretching the nape with the hands
[5663] Reverses navel action-wind.
[5664] Through that reversal, many conceptualities cease inward,
[5665] Increasing fully pure wisdom vision outward.
[5666] Such vitals are:
[5667] Body vital is ability,
[5668] Channel vital is to wind,
[5669] Wind vital is to mind.
[5670] Regarding Sambhogakaya posture also:
[5671] Sound explanation:
[5672] "Great elephant" expresses from the part of power and great vehicle, for that body vital lifts special wisdom.
[5673] Dividing meaning, from the two:
[5674] The vital of setting continuity:
[5675] Sleeping face-covered makes power to overcome the three existences.
[5676] Joining knee and chest makes basis for delusion to dawn as wisdom.
[5677] Extending the big toe outward to earth harms moving action-wind.
[5678] Pressing hand fingers to earth
[5679] Supports dharmata manifestly dawning.
[5680] Raising the nape a little makes conceptuality dawn as wisdom.
[5681] Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5682] Face-covering overcomes the existence of attachment-holding of three doors.
[5683] Placing four hands and feet to earth,
[5684] Pushing outward with the placed foot big-toe reverses conceptuality action-wind.
[5685] Through that reversal, outer delusion vision ceases,
[5686] Heat arises in body and mind inward.
[5687] Pressing both hand-palms to earth reverses moving action-wind.
[5688] Through that reversal, outer bindus and small bindus dawn,
[5689] Experience without day and night arises inward.
[5690] Bending the nape a little reverses grasping action-wind.
[5691] Through that reversal, seeing outer body-vision,
[5692] Exhausts wind's movement inward.
[5693] Regarding Dharmakaya posture also:
[5694] Sound explanation:
[5695] Like one with complete lion's three abilities not fearing anything,
[5696] That body vital clears the fears of the three realms.
[5697] Regarding dividing the manner of meaning:
[5698] The vital of establishing continuity:
[5699] Sitting in dog-curl makes expanse and awareness meet.
[5700] Pressing foot-soles to earth ceases various conceptualities.
[5701] Bending all hand-finger joints and placing inside the two feet empties the movement of action and affliction.
[5702] Resting the upper body in a gap makes always not separate from dharmata.
[5703] Carrying channels to the nape makes support without place to stick from dharmata's meaning.
[5704] Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5705] Placing both foot-soles to earth, pushing the knee a little outward, sitting in dog-curl
[5706] Reverses pervading action-wind.
[5707] Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5708] The continuum of affliction ceases cut inward.
[5709] Placing both hand-palms inward ceases grasping action-wind.
[5710] Through that ceasing, seeing outer wisdom vision,
[5711] The continuum of object-possessor grasping conceptuality ceases inward.
[5712] Resting the upper body in a gap and stretching the nape
[5713] Reverses emitting action-wind.
[5714] Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5715] The continuum of affliction ceases inward.
[5716] Moreover, pressing the Dharmakaya posture completes Buddha-wisdom in this itself.
[5717] Through pressing Sambhogakaya, in this itself one sees the three realms of Buddha-fields.
[5718] Through pressing Nirmanakaya, in this itself there is need to accomplish unobstructed benefit for beings.
[5719] Second, the three unmoving of dawn-agent gaze manner:
[5720] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5721] "The door is that itself unmoving."
[5722] Looking as Nirmanakaya gaze manner, enjoying the vision of awareness-compassion.
[5723] That also: relying on relaxed eye, impossible to separate from samadhi.
[5724] Placing mind a little downward holds the view separate from emptiness-thought.
[5725] Looking equally, impossible to come under affliction's power.
[5726] Looking as Sambhogakaya gaze manner, manifestly seeing the vision of awareness-nature.
[5727] Without moving body, looking equally with both eyes to the right,
[5728] All delusion ceases in one time.
[5729] Looking from the corner, impossible to separate from dharmata.
[5730] Looking to the left strikes the nail of expanse and awareness.
[5731] Pressing that itself a little to the corner ceases the nadi's going and coming.
[5732] Looking as Dharmakaya gaze manner, seeing the essence of awareness.
[5733] Reversing both eyes equally upward a little cuts the continuum of birth-places of the three lower realms.
[5734] Pressing between the eyebrows—no place for awareness to wander.
[5735] Focusing upon the sky space—no place to separate from expanse-awareness.
[5736] Eye relaxation is the same for all.
[5737] Third, the three unmoving of bind-draw:
[5738] Binding body limbs ceases the continuum of the delusion-wheel of six realms.
[5739] Bending all finger joints destroys body action.
[5740] Pressing the nape channel on occasion makes basis for light vision to dawn in self-manner.
[5741] Leaving body bind at fingers makes the three realms nameless.
[5742] Second, the three unmoving of speech:
[5743] Not mixing speech with anyone empties common action of six realms.
[5744] 
[5745] Cutting the return-mixing of words, words dawn as self-arisen wisdom.
[5746] Blocking even merely one's own expression, certain abiding in the manner of all dharmas inexpressible.
[5747] Third, the three unmoving of mind:
[5748] Not separating from the inert of focus, always abiding in Buddha's intention.
[5749] Having entered awareness into the expanse-manner, no place to wander from entity-manner.
[5750] Not separating always from that itself, certain arrival of four visions at measure.
[5751] That also is called "reversing from moving, moving, moving"—
[5752] The vital that frees from those.
[5753] Second, holding measure with three abidings has three parts:
[5754] Through three body abidings, separation from action;
[5755] Through three wind abidings, holding measure of non-arising;
[5756] Through three vision abidings, faith of non-returning.
[5757] First three:
[5758] Abiding not abiding in body action, impossible to increase samsara's delusion.
[5759] Abiding limb emitting and gathering, delusion-wheel continuum ceases.
[5760] Placing action at the basis, certain separation from accumulated action-ripening.
[5761] Second three:
[5762] Abiding wind not going outward, no harm from different condition-vision.
[5763] Abiding eye opening inward, no support for different conceptuality.
[5764] Abiding without outer-inner going and coming, empty basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two.
[5765] Third, three vision abidings:
[5766] Abiding without movement in light, recognition of not returning to three realms.
[5767] Abiding without movement in awareness, exhaustion of action and ripening end.
[5768] Abiding without shaking in body, body's contaminations naturally exhaust.
[5769] At this time, body four signs arriving at measure:
[5770] Arises through obtaining certainty at the basis of four powers.
[5771] Speech four measures arriving:
[5772] Arises through obtaining certainty on the path of four powers.
[5773] Mind four measures arriving:
[5774] Arises through the four powers' result becoming manifest.
[5775] That also: at the time of dharmata manifesting, the body like a tortoise put into a shell bowl,
[5776] Arises through the body's channels abiding relaxed.
[5777] That is the great perfection's meaning, free from action-effort, entering the body limbs.
[5778] Through the pure action of vase-empowerment,
[5779] Elaboration-together wisdom certainly arises self-arisen.
[5780] At the time of upper increase, the body going like a person tormented by sickness, arises through wind entering the central channel,
[5781] The great perfection's meaning without negation-establishment entering the general.
[5782] Through the pure action of secret empowerment,
[5783] Elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5784] At measure-arrival, the body like an elephant sinking in mud,
[5785] Arises through mind hitting channels and winds.
[5786] The great perfection's meaning without accepting-rejecting entering the heart.
[5787] Arising through body action purified by wisdom-yeshe empowerment,
[5788] Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5789] At exhaustion, the body going like dew on a dakini's ear,
[5790] Arises through mind entering the luminosity-net.
[5791] The great perfection's self-free equal meaning entering the body-eye, through word-empowerment body action purified,
[5792] Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5793] Those are shown nearby by examples—
[5794] The signs of body's delusions naturally ceasing in meaning.
[5795] The sign-measure letters are intended for the general manner of meaning;
[5796] Vimal said these are placed very upon meaning.
[5797] Speech basis also like the four visions and sequence:
[5798] Speech going like a mute manner, arises through consciousness entering inner channels.
[5799] This is the great perfection's expressive basis, self-pure, entering speech-symbols,
[5800] Cutting elaboration outward, clear in the manner of inner wisdom.
[5801] Speech going like a crazy person's self-words bursting forth:
[5802] Arises through purifying the self-essence of great perfection expressive words.
[5803] Through entering the resonance of pure certain freedom of great perfection expressive words,
[5804] Cutting elaboration-free meaning inward.
[5805] Speech going like an earthen jar child emerging from a rock gap,
[5806] Arises through compassion gathering into wisdom-yeshe power.
[5807] Through entering the transformation of speech with meaning exceeding great perfection's speak-think,
[5808] Cutting the end of holding words as very elaboration-free.
[5809] Speech arising like the manner of split rock,
[5810] Arises through letters abiding in channels entering wind bindus.
[5811] Through entering the sound of speech with inexpressible great perfection meaning,
[5812] Arises through leaving, exceeding the object of speech, very elaboration-free.
[5813] Expression arises as inexpressible meaning to example.
[5814] Mind's four signs also, to be known through the four visions and sequence:
[5815] Mind going like caught on a dakini's ear,
[5816] Arises through mixing awareness with luminosity.
[5817] Great perfection hold-free self-free, entering mind's vision,
[5818] Arises through completing elaboration-together empowerment.
[5819] Mind going like a person hit by poison thorns,
[5820] Arises through freeing into the expanse of unborn mind.
[5821] Great perfection unborn self-place free, entering mind's arising place,
[5822] Through completing empowerment of primordially non-existent elaboration.
[5823] Mind going without return basis like a person recovered from fever,
[5824] Arises through catching fully pure mind wind.
[5825] Great perfection primordially free without return basis, entering mind's abiding place,
[5826] Through very elaboration-free self-vision self-freeing.
[5827] Mind going like dying immediately after an arrow hits a person's heart,
[5828] Arises through habituation becoming special.
[5829] Great perfection momentary quick-doing measure, entering mind's life:
[5830] Power of all very elaboration near-ceasing and non-existing.
[5831] This also is faith through example, cutting meaning's connection.
[5832] Moreover, body's basis, arising as the doer of freeing the binding of four elements—
[5833] Now the vital point: impossible for elements to return to self-continuum.
[5834] Speech four: express basis,
[5835] Express condition,
[5836] Express object,
[5837] Express agent—free from the binding of four,
[5838] Now impossible to speak words in self-continuum.
[5839] Mind four:
[5840] Memory,
[5841] No memory,
[5842] Non-arising,
[5843] Mind-exceeding—free from the binding of four,
[5844] Now impossible to enter the wheel of memory-thought object.
[5845] Thus, signs dawning in body,
[5846] Known in essence-speech,
[5847] Confidence correcting mind,
[5848] Measure caught by dream,
[5849] Through diligence sequence:
[5850] Great: completely ceasing dreams,
[5851] Arising through great habituation, no benefit or harm by action and latency.
[5852] Middle: arising through certain habituation of knowing dream as dream,
[5853] No conceptuality of good or bad latency.
[5854] Low: becoming well-abiding in dream through single taste of pure latency, need to avoid cause-effect action of abandoning antidotes.
[5855] Thus the three abidings:
[5856] From the Mu tig phreng:
[5857] Abiding is the pure expanse,
[5858] Thus abiding is awareness essence,
[5859] Abiding are all visions.
[5860] Third, striking nails with three obtains:
[5861] Through obtaining power over outer vision, freeing vision-conditions into field-realms.
[5862] Through obtaining power over inner illusory body, freeing dust together into luminosity.
[5863] Through obtaining power over secret awareness, exhausting wind-mind delusion—
[5864] Called "near to obtaining power over the meaningful result."
[5865] Again from that itself:
[5866] Through awareness dawning, cause-conditions cease;
[5867] Through luminosity dawning, subtle-coarse cease;
[5868] Through expanse-awareness dawning, object-mind cease.
[5869] Fourth, holding measure of freedom through four confidences:
[5870] Confidence without fear or dread, although seeing or hearing the suffering of hot and cold hells;
[5871] 
[5872] 
[5873] Confidence of spontaneous three-kaya completion, without hope or excitement of obtaining, although hearing Buddha qualities;
[5874] Confidence of repeating cause-result, without fear of falling into samsara of delusion-vision, although hearing cause-result of action and affliction;
[5875] Four confidences arise: confidence of obtaining the certain ground of primordially-pure self-completion, without joy of hope for freedom, although seeing nirvana's self-place.
[5876] From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:
[5877] Through four great confidences of unchanging view,
[5878] Also holding the measure of non-returning wisdom.
[5879] Thus, in addition to the four extreme reliances:
[5880] Concluding gathering through sixteen visions:
[5881] Vision,
[5882] Increase,
[5883] Obtain,
[5884] Near obtain—four sets, each entering the four visions,
[5885] Completing the sixteen-ground vision:
[5886] Dharmata manifest vision: increase is eye;
[5887] Near increase: eye's that itself;
[5888] Obtain: seeing nadi;
[5889] Near obtain: obtaining habituation to that.
[5890] Experience increase vision: increase is light;
[5891] Near increase: bindu;
[5892] Obtain: bindu clear as five colors;
[5893] Near obtain: various rays emitting from moving and shifting.
[5894] Measure-arrive vision: increase is body;
[5895] Near increase: vision as father-mother;
[5896] Obtain: possessing five and five heaps;
[5897] Near obtain: mandala complete.
[5898] Exhaust vision: increase not abiding in body and wisdom;
[5899] Near increase: empty without focus;
[5900] Obtain: inexpressible;
[5901] Near obtain: dharmata not established anywhere, like non-existence—sixteen.
[5902] Thus, a person certain in sixteen visions, having obtained the time of ripening self-continuum into wisdom,
[5903] Is called "certain in sixteen visions by protector Vajradhara."
[5904] Thus, the sixteen sequences designated at the ground of cause and result, complete here in freeing as light-body and
[5905] Freeing in the bardo.
[5906] 
[5907] From the Rig pa rang shar:
[5908] "Ground" does not exist separately elsewhere.
[5909] In one person seeing truth, all grounds are complete.
[5910] That also: that person to whom introduction is shown—
[5911] First, at the time of seeing truth, joy arising to that is first ground: Very Joyful.
[5912] Recognizing that as self-vision is
[5913] Second ground: obtaining Stainless.
[5914] Then, habituation to that is
[5915] Third ground: obtaining Light-Doing Ground.
[5916] Then, habituating to that and seeing light-vision is fourth: obtaining Light-Emitting Ground.
[5917] Then, having habituated to seeing wisdom-vision,
[5918] Purifying all afflictions by nature,
[5919] Seeing wisdom is fifth: obtaining Difficult-to-Purify Ground.
[5920] Then, that effulgence body manifesting from light is sixth: obtaining Manifest Ground.
[5921] Then, habituation arriving at the end, afflictions gone far, is seventh: obtaining Far-Going Ground.
[5922] Then, unmoving from that manner is
[5923] Eighth: obtaining Unmoving Ground.
[5924] Then, qualities complete is
[5925] Ninth: obtaining Good Intelligence Ground.
[5926] Then, having caught self-knowing at wisdom-vision, vision dawning naturally,
[5927] Habituating seeing all dharmas like clouds is
[5928] Tenth: obtaining Dharma-Cloud-Like Ground.
[5929] That is obtaining without abandoning this very shell of truth-seeing.
[5930] Those persons who abandon the shell obtain thus.
[5931] Vision ceasing delusion-vision, dawning as heap-vision is eleventh: obtaining All-Light Ground.
[5932] Then, not attaching to that vision also, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas is
[5933] Twelfth: obtaining Non-Attaching Lotus-Possessing Ground.
[5934] Then, from self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner:
[5935] Thirteenth: obtaining Great Collection Wheel of Letters Ground.
[5936] Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is fourteenth: obtaining Great Samadhi Ground.
[5937] Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is fifteenth: obtaining Vajra-Holder Ground.
[5938] Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that, is
[5939] Sixteenth: obtaining Wisdom-Guru Ground.
[5940] Those are applied through similar aspects of vision manner, not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds.
[5941] Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness luminosity without purifying or traversing.
[5942] In meaning, it is one awareness ground.
[5943] For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed,
[5944] For they are applied thus to different entry-doors of path vitals.
[5945] The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and
[5946] Mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification.
[5947] From that itself:
[5948] Therefore, although inconceivable beings exist, there is not more than one wisdom essence.
[5949] "Ground" and "path" do not exist separately.
[5950] Know that there is no need to purify or traverse ground and path.
[5951] From the Kun byed:
[5952] Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified.
[5953] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[5954] Showing the summary of the Luminous Vajra Essence Path, the eighteenth chapter.
[5955] Thus, having shown the actual path,
