[5956] Now, regarding the path's difference: for great powers, the supreme means of freeing without meditation—bringing certainty to the secret instruction of cutting (Trekcho)—has three parts:
[5957] Cutting the path through bringing self-essence to the point,
[5958] Binding the summary through cutting connection-words at the point,
[5959] Clearing obstacles through cutting freedom-confidence at the point.
[5960] First has three:
[5961] Bringing certainty to the essence, sky-like, beyond accepting, rejecting, action, and effort in the nature of great perfection.
[5962] 
[5963] Introducing changeless wisdom, direct copper-shining, intention of exhausted dharmas beyond mind.
[5964] Cutting the path to great nameless samsara-nirvana in the manner without binding, freeing, accepting, or rejecting—all primordially transcended in the vast expanse of spontaneous equality.
[5965] First has three:
[5966] General explanation of the meaning, sky-like, without doing, in the nature of great perfection.
[5967] Cutting connection to great root-free emptiness of self-mind, without binding or freeing.
[5968] Vastly pervading the great equality of six aggregates, mirror of mind's object-vision.
[5969] First:
[5970] Great primordially empty, completely empty: all dharmas included by samsara-nirvana, outer vision, inner awareness, middle grasping, holding, vision, and signs.
[5971] Great empty by mind's vision-emptiness.
[5972] Great empty by purity, empty by freedom.
[5973] Not experiencing existence, not experiencing non-existence;
[5974] Not experiencing truth;
[5975] Not experiencing falsehood;
[5976] Not experiencing delusion, not experiencing freedom;
[5977] Not experiencing samsara;
[5978] Not experiencing nirvana;
[5979] Not experiencing "is," not experiencing "is-not";
[5980] Not experiencing vision, not experiencing emptiness.
[5981] All equally vast;
[5982] Pervasion leveled-vast;
[5983] "Is" and "is-not" direction-vast;
[5984] Existence and non-existence vision-vast;
[5985] Unmoving equal-vast;
[5986] Spontaneous-equal primordial-vast;
[5987] Manner-equal basis-vast.
[5988] Vast;
[5989] Leveled;
[5990] Buddha-ed;
[5991] Freed;
[5992] Exhausted;
[5993] Emptied;
[5994] Everywhere-leveled, buddha-ed;
[5995] Pervasively-vast, primordially buddha-ed;
[5996] Spontaneously-equal, expanse buddha-ed;
[5997] Word-vast, equally buddha-ed, unmoving.
[5998] Unmoving;
[5999] Unabiding;
[6000] Untaking;
[6001] Ungoing;
[6002] Uncoming;
[6003] Unthinking;
[6004] Unconceptualizing;
[6005] Unobserving;
[6006] Unequaling;
[6007] Unchanging.
[6008] Before: not experiencing delusion;
[6009] Now: not abiding in delusion;
[6010] End: delusion impossible.
[6011] Before: not experiencing freedom;
[6012] Now: not entering freedom;
[6013] End: freedom impossible.
[6014] Before: no transcendence;
[6015] Now: no abiding;
[6016] Future: no arising.
[6017] Limitless, leveled-buddha, empty;
[6018] Abiding-manner basis non-existent;
[6019] Is-manner path non-existent;
[6020] Free-manner result non-existent.
[6021] View-meditation name non-existent;
[6022] Direction-limit dharma non-existent;
[6023] Existence-non-existence end non-existent;
[6024] Sky-expanse non-existent.
[6025] Primordially buddha-ed, beyond action-effort;
[6026] Vastly buddha-ed, beyond view-meditation.
[6027] Freely buddha-ed, beyond reference and thought;
[6028] Cutting the path to nameless buddhahood everywhere, in all directions.
[6029] Nothing to look at, nothing looked at;
[6030] No viewer;
[6031] Not seen by looking.
[6032] Nothing to meditate;
[6033] Nothing meditated;
[6034] Beyond meditation;
[6035] Not freed by meditating.
[6036] Nothing to analyze;
[6037] Nothing analyzing;
[6038] No need to analyze;
[6039] Analyzing is useless effort.
[6040] No need to accomplish;
[6041] Already accomplished;
[6042] Nothing to accomplish;
[6043] Not accomplished by accomplishing;
[6044] No need for accomplishment.
[6045] Nothing to do;
[6046] No doer;
[6047] Already done;
[6048] Beyond doing;
[6049] Doing also limited;
[6050] No need to do;
[6051] Nothing to do to dharma;
[6052] Doing is not dharma;
[6053] Not-doing: nothing to accomplish.
[6054] Not abandoning samsara;
[6055] Not taking nirvana;
[6056] Accomplishment: direction placed.
[6057] Primordially equal, leveled-vast, original, nameless.
[6058] Whatever vision, abiding as primordially buddha-ed without basis from the ground—bind-free effort self-ceases.
[6059] Whatever dawn, everywhere limitlessly level-placed, primordially pure, self-empty, vastly.
[6060] Whatever buddha-ed, interior vastness of self-mind without doing, effort ceasing everywhere without equal level, abiding as primordially empty and self-pure without trace.
[6061] Applying scripture to the meaning realized by oneself—all dharmas primordially self-dawning in the abide-manner of great perfection nature.
[6062] From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:
[6063] The nature of great perfection:
[6064] All meanings enter the center of mind;
[6065] Non-vision, objectless, without conceptuality,
[6066] Uncut, naturally cutting at self-ground.
[6067] Non-awareness of not experiencing delusion severed,
[6068] Unexamined, primordially cutting, abiding.
[6069] Above, who has not felt all this?
[6070] All these coarse elements also,
[6071] Naturally ceasing from the first,
[6072] Without place to go, naturally going,
[6073] Self-body primordially non-existent,
[6074] Known here without before or after.
[6075] All this, timeless, vastly timed,
[6076] By one, two, and six-three:
[6077] Non-vision, vision, and half-vision,
[6078] In self-sound of non-vision doing,
[6079] Exceeding ground-holding ground.
[6080] Who has not felt primordial abiding?
[6081] Path without primordial traverse,
[6082] This path primordially near,
[6083] This also primordially abiding from self,
[6084] Not seen before—dull self-knowing.
[6085] Intention of non-abiding samadhi:
[6086] Primordially abiding without meditation.
[6087] This also: who did not know before?
[6088] The object of attachment to self and grasping:
[6089] From the very first, in dharmata,
[6090] All this self-vision by self—
[6091] Not knowing primordial vision before.
[6092] Five afflictions binding self-concept,
[6093] Primordially self-dawning awareness,
[6094] Abiding together, faces not meeting.
[6095] Four elements—earth, water, fire, wind—
[6096] Primordially self-body,
[6097] Dull eye of whoever has not seen.
[6098] Very secret gathering place, speech-essence,
[6099] Self-sounding without interval.
[6100] Whoever has not heard this itself—
[6101] Does ear-power not exist?
[6102] Self-abiding expanse and awareness-scent,
[6103] Self-samsara without occasion to separate.
[6104] Nose ceased from not experiencing feeling?
[6105] Three essences, one coiled instruction-taste,
[6106] Primordially body-mind essence—
[6107] Tongue cut from not experiencing this?
[6108] Self-pure vision, color-ornament,
[6109] Without separating from self-body,
[6110] Like body and shadow,
[6111] Abiding without day or night.
[6112] Inert body, untouched by anyone?
[6113] Dharma of bliss striking suffering everywhere,
[6114] Self-abiding without forgetting.
[6115] Dull mind of whoever has not known.
[6116] Piling again the latencies of samsara,
[6117] Primordially abiding as dharmakaya—
[6118] The place of compassion, unseen by whoever.
[6119] From self-concept object's dawning at powers,
[6120] Various memories, thoughts, and movements,
[6121] Primordially self-dawning as Sambhogakaya—
[6122] Worried forgetting, not remembering all this.
[6123] Do, doer, conduct, effort, accomplishment, and
[6124] All noise of gathered beings
[6125] Primordially as emanation body—
[6126] Dull capability of whoever has not known.
[6127] How thoughts and memories move,
[6128] Like a river's flow, without interval,
[6129] Always attracting self-mind.
[6130] Effortless self-place meditation—
[6131] Straying mind, not understanding experience.
[6132] This vision hearing existing container-contents,
[6133] Although natureless through examination,
[6134] Like cutting the continuum of village-city,
[6135] Not seeing primordial abiding.
[6136] Doors of powers closed?
[6137] From the Thal 'gyur:
[6138] 
[6139] This nature of delusion-vision—
[6140] Not seen before as wisdom,
[6141] From basis of delusion with concept not existing,
[6142] Realizing all-ground as great dharmakaya,
[6143] Delusion's self-concept continuum ceases.
[6144] Thus, non-deluded vision
[6145] Arises from the split vital point primordially.
[6146] Buddha-body of beings' aggregates,
[6147] Primordially existing—who did not know?
[6148] Aggregates as Buddha-lord,
[6149] Arising from letters abiding in channels.
[6150] Wisdom in bubbles and eyes—
[6151] Who has not seen as self-vision?
[6152] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[6153] Regarding nature-vision dharmas:
[6154] Subtle and coarse reversed through non-defilement;
[6155] Delusion reversed through non-grasping-holding;
[6156] Action-wind reversed through non-movement;
[6157] Entity reversed through copper-shining;
[6158] Emptiness reversed through clarity;
[6159] Generation stage reversed through primordial realization;
[6160] Conduct reversed through non-effort;
[6161] Meditation reversed through non-seeking placement;
[6162] Vision reversed through self-freedom;
[6163] View reversed through manifest vision;
[6164] Terms reversed through non-sound-words;
[6165] Attachment reversed through not experiencing existence;
[6166] Other-dependence reversed through not experiencing non-existence;
[6167] Mental examination reversed through non-grasping;
[6168] Number-end reversed through uniqueness;
[6169] Other arising and ceasing through all-pervading.
[6170] Darkness buddha-ed through self-dawning;
[6171] Dharmakaya pervading through essence;
[6172] Sambhogakaya expanding through clear vision;
[6173] Emanation body arising through mother-child meeting;
[6174] Method arising through existent realization;
[6175] Memory buddha-ed through thought-exceeding;
[6176] Establishment view complete through non-eternal-cut.
[6177] Again:
[6178] Exceeding ground, direction, and limit;
[6179] Non-existent existence, non-existence, and like-vision;
[6180] Not activity-field of all sounds and measures;
[6181] No field of counting one, two.
[6182] Accomplished by descending into great emptiness;
[6183] Not activity-field of scripture and reason;
[6184] Not indicated by tantra and instruction.
[6185] Through view, meditation, and conduct,
[6186] That meaning will not be known.
[6187] That meaning: no accomplishment as result;
[6188] Dharmas obscure that itself.
[6189] Not accomplished by thinking;
[6190] Not to be examined even by wisdom.
[6191] Through giving, ethics, and patience,
[6192] That itself separate from harm-benefit result.
[6193] Through hearing, thinking, and meditation,
[6194] Not seeing that, even examining supreme.
[6195] No mandala therein;
[6196] No deity, no generation seed;
[6197] What to do with mantra and mudra?
[6198] No need to elaborate offerings, etc.;
[6199] Where are power and vow?
[6200] No approach or accomplishment;
[6201] No wheel emanation;
[6202] No protection, no protectable field;
[6203] Exceeding harm and obstacle fields.
[6204] 
[6205] 
[6206] 
[6207] From the Self-Dawning:
[6208] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6209] No view, meditation, or conduct.
[6210] Yet hold well-taught in mind.
[6211] Without accomplishing, without wishing to move ability,
[6212] The meaning of that itself, spontaneously complete without doing, as before.
[6213] Where are doings and doers?
[6214] This self-arisen dharmata without conduct,
[6215] Not falling in any direction, like space,
[6216] Not existence—only oneness of emptiness,
[6217] Not non-existence—true bliss body,
[6218] Not made—self-arisen, concept-free.
[6219] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6220] Where is dharmata of meditation?
[6221] Dharma without sending or keeping,
[6222] Free from end of meditated and non-meditated.
[6223] What defilement of hold-free mind?
[6224] True awareness without defilement;
[6225] Upon stainless pure dharmakaya,
[6226] Nothing to meditate or be meditated.
[6227] Not finding true itself by meditating;
[6228] If found, self-awareness becomes non-existent.
[6229] Why? In self-awareness wisdom,
[6230] Without distracted or non-distracted.
[6231] Where there is holding,
[6232] Self-arisen wisdom does not exist.
[6233] That also: dharmas thus:
[6234] No ceasing from non-birth;
[6235] Free at self-place from non-holding;
[6236] No elaboration from non-reference;
[6237] Existing in all, not arisen from making;
[6238] Fully pure expanse through unconditioned;
[6239] Term of holding separate from dharmas;
[6240] Separate from expression through non-nature.
[6241] From the Nor bu phra bkod:
[6242] Ha ha!
[6243] Dharmata arising from non-dharma;
[6244] Object-like vision from non-object;
[6245] Dharma-free wisdom interiorly clear,
[6246] Memoryless: non-existent as object.
[6247] From the Seng ge rtsal rdzogs:
[6248] This entity-free dharmata without holding-attachment,
[6249] Supreme non-dual intention of all Buddhas.
[6250] Discrimination and marks, path of words,
[6251] Self-place pure dharmata without action-effort,
[6252] Ub chub samadhi entering dharmata-object.
[6253] Pure and impure terms non-existent as dharmas;
[6254] Primordially abiding meaning exceeding one and two,
[6255] Ub by one bindu in the manner of self-body.
[6256] 
[6257] 
[6258] 
[6259] 
[6260] 
[6261] From the Klong drug pa:
[6262] No reference in endless center;
[6263] No thinking, no objects;
[6264] No deity, no mantra either;
[6265] Beyond all designation of non-dharma;
[6266] No enemy, no friend either;
[6267] No body, no vision to powers;
[6268] Dharmas not visible by thinking;
[6269] No holding of what is non-existent where;
[6270] No I, no possessions of I;
[6271] No expanse, no awareness body either;
[6272] No ripening of virtue or evil;
[6273] No life, no reference to cut;
[6274] No collection, no field to accumulate;
[6275] No Buddha, no beings;
[6276] No abiding, no emptiness either.
[6277] From Samantabhadra's Mind Mirror:
[6278] To enlightenment essence without deviation or obstacle,
[6279] Where is holding deviation and obstacle?
[6280] Completely non-existent: deviation-free obstacles.
[6281] To dharmakaya separate from obstacles,
[6282] Holding deviation-obstacle as two is afflicted.
[6283] To unborn dharmakaya arising from self,
[6284] Capability-delusion of hoping to come from other.
[6285] To unborn awareness separate from thought,
[6286] Oh wonder, shown in words and letters!
[6287] From the Yi ge med pa:
[6288] Where is doer of unmade?
[6289] No lord of unfabricated fabrication;
[6290] Separate from view-doing dharmas of non-view;
[6291] Fully clear see-doer of non-seeing;
[6292] Separate from appear-direction of non-appear-doer;
[6293] Pervading ten directions, untouchable, of non-writing;
[6294] Separate from effort-accomplish dharmas of non-effort;
[6295] Separate from many dharmas of non-oneness;
[6296] Clear without outer-inner of non-outer-inner.
[6297] Also from the Common Secret Illusion:
[6298] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6299] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6300] All born from unborn,
[6301] Unborn from merely born.
[6302] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6303] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6304] All abiding from non-abiding,
[6305] Non-abiding from merely abiding.
[6306] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6307] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6308] Going and coming from non-going-coming,
[6309] Non-going-coming from going-coming itself.
[6310] 
[6311] 
[6312] 
[6313] 
[6314] Also from the Ratnakuta Sutra:
[6315] The Thus-Come always born,
[6316] Non-dharma,
[6317] All dharmas like the Blissfully-Come.
[6318] Childish intellects holding marks,
[6319] Practicing non-existent dharmas in the pure world.
[6320] Also from the Samadhiraja Sutra:
[6321] When this world realm arises and
[6322] Ceases after arising, abiding empty,
[6323] Like before, so also after—
[6324] Know all dharmas thus.
[6325] From the Arya Ratnakuta Sutra:
[6326] Non-awareness like space,
[6327] All dharmas without characteristics,
[6328] Without support, without abiding, without taking—
[6329] Fully know as like emanations.
[6330] From the Guhyasamaja:
[6331] These entities unborn,
[6332] Dharma and dharmata non-existent,
[6333] Selfless like space—
[6334] This manner of enlightenment shown.
[6335] Second: two parts regarding cutting connection to great root-free emptiness of self-mind without binding or freeing:
[6336] General explanation through examining three goings of arising-places, and
[6337] Particular certainty through examining one and different.
[6338] First:
[6339] Although essence is end-free like space,
[6340] Without inner examination by self, remaining in thought "is," going like a darkness-stone through empty meditation,
[6341] Through not thinking copper-shining directly, not separating the difference-edge of samsara-nirvana,
[6342] Need discriminating wisdom for realization dawning as certain knowledge.
[6343] From the Yi ge med pa:
[6344] Although awareness nature pervades all,
[6345] Said to reach dharma instruction.
[6346] Here, to be realized through guru's instruction, three parts:
[6347] Examining arising-place and arising-agent;
[6348] Examining abiding-place and abiding-agent;
[6349] Examining going-place and going-agent.
[6350] First, from the two:
[6351] Arising place: outer various objects appearing,
[6352] Inner: aggregates appearing as form.
[6353] 
[6354] 
[6355] 
[6356] 
[6357] When either of those two minds dawns:
[6358] Dawned outward: outer object;
[6359] Dawned inward: inner body.
[6360] Examining dust-particles without parts, dividing layer by layer,
[6361] Seeing arising-place's vision-object non-existent, recognizing mind did not arise from that—cutting connection to great root-free basis of concept holding grasped object.
[6362] If arising-agent sha-ra-ra o-la-la's mind and mental-events arise from themselves, momentary knowing becomes two substances;
[6363] Examining complete: not arising from self or other.
[6364] Now, thinking that arising-place arises self-arisen:
[6365] Color,
[6366] Shape,
[6367] Sign,
[6368] Characteristic,
[6369] Big-small,
[6370] Direction-part, etc.—examining what exists, not abiding anywhere.
[6371] Merely mind-examined, basisless, gone everywhere primordially pure,
[6372] Inner holding-concept, basisless like sky, realized by self,
[6373] All grasping-holding appearing as dharma and dharmata, realized at that time as great support-free without object.
[6374] Realizing today mind's primordial non-arising at first—understanding meaning of great elaboration-free dharmakaya.
[6375] Second: middle abiding-place and abiding-agent.
[6376] Third: likewise destroying and examining end going-place and going-agent two,
[6377] Touching intention of great self-luminous Sambhogakaya and
[6378] Self-free self-dawning emanation body.
[6379] Outer-inner objectless, unsupported awareness;
[6380] Grasping-holding basisless;
[6381] Understanding meaning of equal intention without interval.
[6382] Self-buddha great equality dawning interiorly as unmeditated river-flow samadhi.
[6383] From the Thal 'gyur:
[6384] Mind: first arising place,
[6385] Middle abiding place, end going place.
[6386] Thus examining and analyzing the three,
[6387] Purify mind, know mind's abiding manner.
[6388] At that time, all outer object-vision non-existent, suddenly basisless vision;
[6389] All inner mind-concepts dawn-free, without trace.
[6390] 
[6391] Called "dawning in mind-exhaustion the intention of dharma-exhaustion" through seeing great copper-shining without connection between vision and mind.
[6392] These are said in the Arya Ratnakuta:
[6393] Kashyapa, herein bodhisattvas mahasattvas begin the diligence of fully searching mind.
[6394] That mind is not observed outwardly,
[6395] Not observed inwardly,
[6396] Not existing and not observed in the interval of both.
[6397] Not blue,
[6398] Not yellow, and so forth.
[6399] Supreme among all diligences to that is the diligence of fully searching mind—thus said.
[6400] Second: examining one and different—
[6401] The instruction of destroying mind's house.
[6402] Moreover: if this called "mind" exists, from what cause does it arise?
[6403] If non-existent, what are this movement and memory-knowing wheel?
[6404] Upon what condition do these memory-knowing aspects depend to arise?
[6405] Without condition, these sudden memory-knowings are unsuitable.
[6406] If this mind exists as one with body, it would also be destroyed when body is destroyed;
[6407] If non-existent, with uncertain following-return, body-sickness would come to mind.
[6408] Unsuitable for before-after birth wheel to come.
[6409] If "mind" here is one, through one realm's powers ceasing, other realms should also die;
[6410] If not one, realm minds should differ like realm forms differ; if different, all those insects and beings inside one body
[6411] Should live when one person's life-time is done.
[6412] If one, what is this coming of numberless outer-inner beings to one body?
[6413] If this mind has a returning place,
[6414] First there must be a cause.
[6415] If cause exists, conditioned and impermanent, destroyed again—unsuitable for good or bad in actions.
[6416] Without returning place, the coming of numberless sentient being aggregates is unsuitable.
[6417] If that mind were various, self-other thoughts suddenly coming to realms is unsuitable.
[6418] Through mutual intermixing,
[6419] Self-conquest,
[6420] Non-death,
[6421] Absence of suffering,
[6422] Possession of retinue and enjoyments bringing happiness,
[6423] Defeat of others and all shared perceptions coming uniformly is unsuitable.
[6424] If they were different,
[6425] Since many realms exist,
[6426] It would be suitable for some to come with agreement with others through self-defeat, happiness, and so forth.
[6427] If one only thinks, would all die through one dying,
[6428] Or would all be born through one being born?
[6429] Thus, examining and searching one's own mind through the door of many aspects with the controversy of one and different,
[6430] Finding nothing is realizing with the power of wisdom the meaning of primordial purity of dharmata.
[6431] Mind having no cause, return is impossible—boundless faith in accumulation of actions.
[6432] Mind having cause, result must come.
[6433] If result is samsara, impure, liberation is impossible.
[6434] If transcended, samsara's coming is unsuitable.
[6435] If both,
[6436] Samsara and nirvana being different, mind also becomes different.
[6437] If different,
[6438] Like body and mind being different, desires gathered in one family of memory-thought would become many different—from
[6439] Knowing through gathering in one family.
[6440] Moreover: if mind has no cause, these minds are unsuitable.
[6441] These do not arise from mind's cause, for they are not intelligence.
[6442] Not arising from mind, there is no failure to realize mind's mere dwelling in itself.
[6443] These birth,
[6444] Death,
[6445] Abiding, and so forth neither exhaust
[6446] Nor increase—
[6447] From scripture:
[6448] "In this ignorance-illusion wheel, no exhaustion, no increase."
[6449] And:
[6450] "The nature of the realm of beings also has no end."
[6451] Thus said.
[6452] Thus, through causelessness, know increase not existing in mind.
[6453] 
[6454] Through non-increase, know non-birth.
[6455] Through non-birth, know non-death.
[6456] Knowing that, know also no evil in actions.
[6457] From the Condensed:
[6458] "This pair of existence and non-existence is the dharma of non-existence."
[6459] Thus, knowing self-empty from primordial beginning,
[6460] "How could beings be born, being pure from the beginning?"
[6461] Thus it is said.
[6462] Moreover, mind is conditionless:
[6463] If it existed, like appearances appearing variously, mind also would become various in color, etc., through conditions.
[6464] Mind having become different, memory-thought is unsuitable as one.
[6465] If mind had conditions, it would certainly be destroyed—
[6466] Concluding no action-result in mind.
[6467] Even if mind ceases, if its action exists,
[6468] This is greatly contradictory,
[6469] Equal to saying that body's color, sense-bases, good and bad all dwell even when body ceases.
[6470] Thus, clear through mere dwelling like illusion.
[6471] If conditionless, from what does this various memory-thought now arise?
[6472] This present memory-thought does not arise from conditions—
[6473] Like happiness and holding as true upon finding yesterday's dream jewel,
[6474] When waking, nothing exists.
[6475] Even though now's memory-thought is held as true and attached, after that nothing exists—there is no establishment from circumstance's true-false-like appearance.
[6476] For example: like sky's various clouds suddenly gathering, without trace of where they went, suddenly dissolving,
[6477] Though clouds do not exist in sky, they appear in its nature.
[6478] Though conditions and causes do not exist in mind, like appearing appearances, at the time of appearing, cause and condition do not exist—certain of non-existence through examination of one, many, and three times.
[6479] From the Root of Wisdom:
[6480] "From seed ceased and not ceased,
[6481] Sprout's birth does not exist.
[6482] You have shown all dharmas
[6483] Arising like illusions."
[6484] "The fifth condition is non-existent."
[6485] Thus said.
[6486] Also from the All-Creating:
[6487] 
[6488] 
[6489] "The supreme path of peace without cause and condition."
[6490] Thus explained, and so forth.
[6491] Therefore, if mind exists,
[6492] Does entity possess form,
[6493] Or exist formlessly?
[6494] It does not possess form—for if it existed, it would be suitable for sense-power's direct perception; clear through valid cognition of direct perception not observing the suitable-for-seeing.
[6495] If it exists formlessly, how is it known?
[6496] If known through movement,
[6497] That movement is merely needed, direction-part,
[6498] And past-future-present three meeting—unestablished through examination.
[6499] If former movement and present movement meet, the meeting-part's former memory-thought would need to exist now without ceasing;
[6500] If it existed, this contradicts being former.
[6501] If present's former and that part cease, and they do not meet, present memory-thought would have no cause—movement is unsuitable, thus stopped.
[6502] Is movement one or different?
[6503] If one, the becoming-various is lost;
[6504] If different, since move-maker is one, it is lost.
[6505] Thus, mind's existence is unestablished,
[6506] Realizing like rootless sky.
[6507] Birth and birth-basis not existing, no returning place.
[6508] Place not existing, memory-thought before-after interval facing-introduces, dissolving there—recognizing no basis in mind.
[6509] Knowing that, faith in no returning place.
[6510] Knowing that, deciding upon the great namelessness of three realms.
[6511] Through that dharma, mind's ease without benefit-harm of virtuous and vicious actions.
[6512] Moreover, appearance-knowing before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6513] Recognizing mind's non-establishment as cause and characteristic.
[6514] Knowing that, faith in no identifying-grasping of mind's emptiness itself.
[6515] Believing that, deciding mind does not arise from causes and conditions.
[6516] Through that dharma, mind's ease without benefit-harm from sudden memory-thoughts' thoughts.
[6517] Moreover, mind's ease.
[6518] Moreover, mind before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6519] Recognizing no root in mind.
[6520] Knowing that, faith in no different elaborations in mind's single wheel.
[6521] Believing that, deciding buddhahood not achieved through fabricated dharmas.
[6522] Cutting that, mind's ease without failure to realize from non-existent mind's meaning.
[6523] Moreover, dharmata before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6524] Recognizing no birth in mind.
[6525] Knowing that, faith that propensities are not harmed by body's all-ground.
[6526] Believing that, deciding mind's birth impossible now.
[6527] Through that dharma, mind's ease without returning place and returning-support, mind's house ceasing.
[6528] Thus, through grasping the measure of four times of mind-searching,
[6529] Buddha not existing, buddha also not even name-only.
[6530] Mind turning from holding hope for results.
[6531] That turning, no dharmas making path effort-exertion.
[6532] Thus, non-existent dharma having nothing, called "liberation's measure" through not finding meaning from mere names designated as samsara-nirvana.
[6533] Therefore, mind itself non-existent having nothing,
[6534] Mind having no cause-reason, not seen,
[6535] Thus turning four face-introducings of non-existence, and
[6536] Realizing sixteen dharma-possessors
[6537] Is destroying mind's house.
[6538] Like child's house built and destroyed;
[6539] Like that: action destroys action, iron destroys iron;
[6540] Impermanent destroys impermanent, like illusion-person destroys illusion-city;
[6541] Made destroys impermanent, like corpse stacked on corpse;
[6542] Impermanent destroys made, like present wisdom destroys former ignorance.
[6543] Thus, mind destroying mind, both dissolve without track, like letters written on water;
[6544] Not-exist seeking not-exist also not finding, like no finding-place though searching for wish-fulfilling jewel not existing in poor house.
[6545] Non-existent mind having no place to destroy
[6546] Is like no holding-place in water when dissolving.
[6547] Therefore, not knowing non-existent mind's meaning,
[6548] Searching mind for view-meditation-conduct
[6549] Great bliss liberation's doctrine finding-time not-exists—
[6550] Like boat sinking, entering water.
[6551] Non-existent mind's existing-support itself deceives and binds—thus said.
[6552] From Samantabhadra's Heart Mirror:
[6553] "Desiring appearance as dharmakaya is obstruction to me."
[6554] "Desiring whatever-appears as mind is obstruction to me."
[6555] "Desiring self-arising as other is obstruction to me."
[6556] Thus said.
[6557] Then: does "mind dissolving" mean existing becomes non-existent?
[6558] Dissolving: as before, unestablished through examination;
[6559] Even unexamined, from sudden memory-thoughts' thought dissolving,
[6560] Mind's self-continuum does not go from existence to non-existence.
[6561] Dissolve-cause and dissolve-condition nowhere exist.
[6562] Then: is destroying mind's house purposeless, since nothing to destroy?
[6563] To primordially non-existent mind,
[6564] Only making realize non-existent nature—
[6565] Not that mind's house's basis or entity exists.
[6566] Memory's source having gone to dharmata,
[6567] Making understand non-existence,
[6568] Conventionally called "destroying house."
[6569] Destroying the existent—nothing whatsoever.
[6570] Therefore, placing above whatever-appears object-vital-point of appearance—the so-called "term's result"—
[6571] Inert appearance without grasping there, result of non-dual object-mind;
[6572] Placing above whatever-knowing moves,
[6573] Mind's house self-destroying, movement-thought-liberated result;
[6574] Thus, identifying non-dual inert-knowing union wisdom's dissolving place, non-existent result.
[6575] Thus, result-three's times also upon four vital-points of dissolving-time facing-introduction,
[6576] Know sixteen non-existent dharmas as before.
[6577] This also: from Great Secret Certain Heart-Essence's Cutting-Through—mind primordially non-existent, self-liberated;
[6578] Movement sudden, primordially liberated;
[6579] Instruction other and mind ultimately non-existent;
[6580] Pretending conventionally existent.
[6581] Two: making path through view and meditation upon mind.
[6582] Though merely self-liberating, self-dawning, self-placing may seem discordant,
[6583] The meaning is not discordant:
[6584] Here, making primordially non-existent, and
[6585] Elsewhere desiring non-existence of the existent—thus.
[6586] Also union:
[6587] Desiring union where two existents connect one-to-one elsewhere, and
[6588] Here, no cause to enter union through primordial non-existence,
[6589] Non-existent essence having no different distinction—two not different, thus called "non-dual union."
[6590] This vital point, most crucial among all vehicles, extremely important and crucial:
[6591] From this, not desiring appearance as mind, and
[6592] Showing the great basis of buddhahood not experienced as existent mind.
[6593] Depending on this, face-introducing appearance as mind, and
[6594] Face-introducing mind itself as empty—know this as Heart Essence instruction intention.
[6595] If some instructions thus arise possibly, decide they are merely provisional below, not definitive meaning.
[6596] Third: objects appearing in mind's mirror dawning, aggregates six pervading expansive great equality:
[6597] Outer various appearances,
[6598] Inner sudden memory-thoughts,
[6599] All powers six appearances with objects,
[6600] Merely clear appearance of non-existence.
[6601] In meaning, nowhere outer-inner, like cataract-hairlines,
[6602] Illusion,
[6603] Eye-magic,
[6604] Emanation—appearing in mind although,
[6605] Know transcending exist-not-exist extremes from the very time of appearing.
[6606] From appearance's side, however designated, not contradictory;
[6607] Allow "is,"
[6608] Allow "is not,"
[6609] Allow "exists,"
[6610] Allow "not exists,"
[6611] Allow "appears,"
[6612] Allow "empty,"
[6613] Allow "deluded,"
[6614] Allow "liberated,"
[6615] Allow "good,"
[6616] Allow "bad,"
[6617] Allow "mind,"
[6618] Allow "other"—
[6619] However designated,
[6620] From empty's side, empty first by that itself which designates.
[6621] Designation is mind,
[6622] Mind is non-existent,
[6623] Like dream actions and illusion actions—no maker for non-existence.
[6624] 
[6625] Virtue, non-virtue, etc.—that itself sudden.
[6626] That essence: basisless, self-liberated.
[6627] Awareness's primordial tone exists in part—if identified, intention's dharmata direction has nowhere else to grasp.
[6628] All appearance-existence samsara-nirvana dharmas—great appearance of clear appearance of non-existence in awareness's nature, self-dawning, self-appearing:
[6629] Like four elements' appearances dwelling in sky's nature,
[6630] Like various dreams and sleep,
[6631] Not moving from sleep-awareness's nature.
[6632] Although all self-appear in awareness's nature,
[6633] Awareness does not see delusion-appearance samsara,
[6634] Does not see pure appearance transcended,
[6635] Samsara-nirvana does not see awareness.
[6636] All, unmoving in basisless great equal nature,
[6637] Transcending seer and seen through non-establishment of essence,
[6638] Dawning from awareness's nature—merely designated "samsara-nirvana awareness's self-tone or play."
[6639] Great liberation from exist-not-exist extremes,
[6640] Designation not contradictory,
[6641] Not established in meaning.
[6642] All appearance-existence samsara-nirvana dharmas dawn as merely clear appearance of non-existence.
[6643] From Space Six:
[6644] "To mind itself without stain,
[6645] Appearance separate from object-conditions
[6646] Is called 'great self-pure intention'—
[6647] Samantabhadra I have shown."
[6648] From Jewel Display:
[6649] "Entity of complete non-existence,
[6650] Not falling in any direction,
[6651] Entity of whatever delusion—
[6652] Merely appearing as harmonious appearance,
[6653] Yet that meaning does not arise,
[6654] Appearance like dharmadhatu ornament.
[6655] Great emptiness wisdom
[6656] Deludes from complete non-existence—"
[6657] From Pearl Garland:
[6658] "That is I, that is beings,
[6659] That is mind, arisen from mind,
[6660] Not many, singularly one,
[6661] Samsara-nirvana is myself,
[6662] Mandalas etc. are gradual entry,
[6663] Dharmas, appearing as dharmas,
[6664] Abiding, moving,
[6665] Sitting, sleeping, lying,
[6666] Life, also cutting,
[6667] Three worlds arise from that.
[6668] Briefly: as appears,
[6669] All dharmas arise from that—
[6670] Earth, water, fire, wind, space,
[6671] Great elements arise from that."
[6672] 
[6673] 
[6674] 
[6675] 
[6676] Thus to dwelling dharmata:
[6677] Delusion not-existing from the beginning,
[6678] In dharmakaya like sky,
[6679] Obscured by sudden beings' clouds.
[6680] Also non-deluded dwelling dharmata
[6681] Appears in mind as deluded manner.
[6682] Beings' five afflictions themselves:
[6683] In meaning, they do not exist—
[6684] Like clouds in sky,
[6685] Sudden, with conditions,
[6686] Clouds arise from sky itself.
[6687] Knowing thus dissolve into sky,
[6688] Called "non-different one nature."
[6689] Thus afflictions' stains themselves,
[6690] Knowing self-arising, self-ceasing,
[6691] How could beings be bound?
[6692] Appearance-manner unestablished like
[6693] Appearing as grasping, yet nowhere established—
[6694] Shown also as great placelessness.
[6695] From Heap of Jewels:
[6696] "This mind itself without dwelling place,
[6697] Without going place, wondrous!
[6698] To six minds entering all,
[6699] Without depending place, wondrous!
[6700] To all-gathering all-ground,
[6701] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6702] To circling-deluding ignorance,
[6703] Without changing power, wondrous!
[6704] To all object-attaching afflictions,
[6705] Without basis-root, wondrous!
[6706] To subtle and coarse stains,
[6707] Without grasping place, wondrous!
[6708] To coarse elemental forms,
[6709] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6710] To person's depending life-breath,
[6711] Without time-setting, wondrous!
[6712] To six aggregates' object appearances,
[6713] Without permanence, wondrous!
[6714] To person's arisen memory-thought feelings,
[6715] Without exhaustion, wondrous!"
[6716] "This basisless dharmata—
[6717] Great wonder, placed without searching!
[6718] To going-coming awareness—
[6719] Great wonder, without end!
[6720] To primordially dwelling great wisdom—
[6721] Great wonder, without antidote!"
[6722] Also from Arya Samadhi Raja, common vehicle:
[6723] "How in mid-space, little cloudless,
[6724] Momentarily cloud mandala appears,
[6725] Arising-ceasing, that cloud mandala—
[6726] Examine from what first it arose!
[6727] Know all dharmas thus.
[6728] How person dwells in rock mountain hollow,
[6729] From singing, speaking, laughing, crying,
[6730] Echoes arise depending on conditions,
[6731] Yet that tone from sound never moves.
[6732] Know all dharmas thus."
[6733] Extensively said.
[6734] Second meaning: face-introducing foundation primordial wisdom without move-change, copper-shining dharma-exhaust mind-transcend intention—three:
[6735] 
[6736] 
[6737] 
[6738] 
[6739] 
[6740] Direct face-introduction of copper-shining awareness through dharma-exhaustion and mind-transcendence:
[6741] Maintain the intention of self-clear nature-abiding in great pervasion-expansion,
[6742] Place the three vital points of dharmata's wheel in the great sky-equal space-clarity.
[6743] First:
[6744] Just place self-settled awareness in self-clarity,
[6745] Not sending outward,
[6746] Not gathering inward,
[6747] Look at self-nature without thinking in-between—
[6748] Outer, inner, and middle: non-existent;
[6749] Self-clear foundation:
[6750] Dharmakaya not confused by view-meditation,
[6751] Primordial wisdom not moved by concepts,
[6752] Intention not fabricated by elaboration-gathering;
[6753] In clarity: thought non-existent;
[6754] In abiding: grasping non-existent;
[6755] In vastness: losing non-existent;
[6756] In equality: interval non-existent.
[6757] Great self-tone without entering-maker;
[6758] Great great intention self-settled from primordial time:
[6759] Tone and empty like ocean,
[6760] Clear and pure like sun and moon,
[6761] Vast and pervading like sky,
[6762] Stable and abiding like king of mountains.
[6763] This meaning and all beings: though existing primordially in self, not experiencing separation even for a moment,
[6764] Yet through face-not-knowing, mixed in samsara by bad thought elaborations—
[6765] Now, through lama's instruction identifying, whether dawning or dwelling or whatever, just as face-introduction to self-settled place nature, make only nature-not-wandering.
[6766] From Lion Perfection:
[6767] E ma: path that lion crosses not;
[6768] Lion of action-effort non-existent:
[6769] To white snow of release-place non-existent,
[6770] Powers three of cleared darkness perfect.
[6771] I, lion of thought-non-existent tone:
[6772] To good snow of primordial purity, stain-not,
[6773] Powers three of cleared element perfect.
[6774] Thus said, and:
[6775] From Six Spaces:
[6776] To mind-itself of permanent-cease non-existent:
[6777] Appearance of separation from good-bad:
[6778] Intention of separation from abandon-accept—
[6779] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6780] To mind-itself of accept-reject non-existent:
[6781] Appearance of self-liberation direction-non-existent—
[6782] Intention of great pervasion-expansion—
[6783] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6784] To mind-itself of dull-excitement non-existent:
[6785] Meditation of great release-equal—
[6786] Intention of six aggregates spontaneous—
[6787] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6788] To mind-itself of concern non-existent:
[6789] Appearance of separation from hope-doubt—
[6790] Intention of primordial place, confidence-possessing—
[6791] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6792] Thus said.
[6793] From Perfection:
[6794] This dharma-nature, entity-separate, grasping-attachment non-existent—
[6795] Buddhas' intention dharma of non-duality;
[6796] Particular emptiness and signs' word path,
[6797] Dharma-nature of action-effort non-existent, pure in self-place;
[6798] Complete samadhi, entering from dharma-nature object.
[6799] Pure and impure: term dharmas non-existent;
[6800] Meaning primordially dwelling, transcending one and two;
[6801] Self-body in nature, entering single bindu;
[6802] Time non-existent realization: samadhi not-wandering clear;
[6803] Extreme and center non-existent: dharma-nature name-separate;
[6804] Change not: straight, pervading all;
[6805] Made not: spontaneously accomplished in arising place.
[6806] Thus it is said.
[6807] Second: maintaining that nature has three:
[6808] Maintaining view-meditation object-transcending great,
[6809] Maintaining samadhi self-settled great,
[6810] Maintaining intention mind-transcending great.
[6811] First:
[6812] In that face-introduction nature, without mind-grasping effort and purpose-meditation antidote entering—place awareness vast wide, primordially placed, height-top vast, interval non-existent, self-liberated.
[6813] From Jewel Display:
[6814] Vast: dharma-nature completely pure;
[6815] Great: view wonderful great;
[6816] Appearance face: mandala self-appearance itself;
[6817] Object and object-non-existent: completely pure;
[6818] Outer and inner non-existent: completely appear;
[6819] Empty and not-empty: transcending words.
[6820] Thus said, and:
[6821] From Lion Perfection:
[6822] To whatever place the first place is,
[6823] The last goes to that place;
[6824] Now: dwell in that meaning.
[6825] Thus said, and:
[6826] Also:
[6827] In sky of grasping-thought non-existent,
[6828] In sky of consciousness non-existent—
[6829] Consciousness mind unmoved:
[6830] Supreme samadhi of non-wandering,
[6831] Single Buddha grove manner.
[6832] Thus it is said.
[6833] Second has three:
[6834] Self-dwelling just-place:
[6835] Without making grasping-elaboration on aggregate-object appearance, outer-inner-middle non-existent, wide, self-liberated, vast place—
[6836] Even when going to sleep, sleeping in that nature, dreams dawn in clear light.
[6837] Great thunder is:
[6838] Identifying the nature: three doors spontaneously released, whatever dawns suddenly hit, self-liberated, vast vast gone.
[6839] Appearance expansion:
[6840] Body cross-legged, eyes staring at interval appearance,
[6841] Cut mind's sending-gathering, identify half-pure awareness nature—bind five winds to space,
[6842] Self-appearance pure clear light: outer smoke, mirage, rainbow light, etc., and inner dharma-nature empty clear appearance pure like dawn.
[6843] From Six Spaces:
[6844] Train thus in three samadhis:
[6845] Self-dwelling just-place samadhi:
[6846] Not stopping power doors,
[6847] Not using body actions,
[6848] Not abandoning sleep,
[6849] Not cutting apart with mind—
[6850] Brief: body speech in self-place,
[6851] Mind-arising parts outward not lost;
[6852] To power objects six,
[6853] Know-awareness action: mind unmoved;
[6854] To self-appearance not-thinking great,
[6855] Clear thought-non-existent: experience arises.
[6856] Great thunder samadhi:
[6857] Body from ordinary like,
[6858] Speech separate from spoken words,
[6859] Mind not bound tight,
[6860] Self-dawn to self: not wandering.
[6861] Appearance expand samadhi:
[6862] By body and object and awareness,
[6863] Grasp all pure self-appearance measures.
[6864] Thus it is said.
[6865] Third: maintaining intention mind-transcending has four:
[6866] Mountain just-place view,
[6867] Ocean just-place intention,
[6868] Awareness just-place instruction,
[6869] Appearance just-place method.
[6870] First:
[6871] Identify this self-clear awareness, whatever dawns—place in nature without move-change like mountain king view.
[6872] From Letter Non-Existent:
[6873] Mountain just-place view: secret itself;
[6874] Not doubt: change by nature non-existent.
[6875] Thus it is said.
[6876] Second:
[6877] Body cross-legged,
[6878] Eyes ha-re placed at interval appearance,
[6879] Clear place in nature like ocean unmoved by waves—half-pure consciousness.
[6880] From That Itself:
[6881] The intention of ocean just-place:
[6882] Not appearance, yet makes appear;
[6883] Not empty, yet not existent as empty;
[6884] Not clear, yet object of great clarity;
[6885] Not dull, excitement by nature non-existent.
[6886] Unmoved, immovable, not becoming moved;
[6887] Unstirred, not stirring, transcending all stirring—
[6888] See great method of place: not arisen by making;
[6889] Nature of just-place one: not making send-gather.
[6890] Not dwelling: no transcendence from that;
[6891] To ocean-like secret primordial wisdom,
[6892] Primordially spontaneously vast: unmoved, place in space.
[6893] From great ocean depth difficult to measure,
[6894] See peak of victory banner never setting;
[6895] Empty mind non-existent: great body not made,
[6896] By non-making conquer all making;
[6897] Just-place itself: primordially unarisen, unmade,
[6898] Appearance unchanged: not made by mind.
[6899] Dharma-nature dwell in sky: intention shown;
[6900] Dharmakaya primordial wisdom: completely abandon thought;
[6901] If no move-make: intention of meditation.
[6902] If not grasping appear-object and focus-direction,
[6903] Like planet-star dawning in ocean depth—
[6904] Grasping not on object, clear part not ceasing:
[6905] Thus is self-arisen intention dwell manner.
[6906] Thus it is said.
[6907] Third:
[6908] Identify wide wide wide self-clear foundation naked burst of clear-empty awareness primordial wisdom—cut samadhi mind-attachment mistake place, copper-shining foundation dharmakaya dawns from within.
[6909] From Lion Perfection: looking outward to many self-know objects—
[6910] Great thought-non-existent dharmakaya found within.
[6911] Thus it is said.
[6912] Fourth:
[6913] When widely looking at outer five-object appearance, place in nature of clear clear foundation self-clear dawning from within.
[6914] From That Itself:
[6915] Looking outward to awareness-clear dharmata object—
[6916] See inside awareness of separation from various.
[6917] Thus said, and:
[6918] From Letter Non-Existent:
[6919] Great method of appearance just-place awareness:
[6920] Appearance great: not basis of all;
[6921] Appear like five element Buddhas' path;
[6922] Five greats: mother itself clear as appearance;
[6923] In not-wandering nature: place great grasping-non-existent.
[6924] Thus it is said.
[6925] Third: placing three vital points of dharmata's wheel in great sky-equal space-clarity has three:
[6926] Instruction placing mind itself action-separate by nature of dharmata's separation from effort-exertion;
[6927] Instruction concepts dawning as primordial wisdom by vital point of dharmata's self-direct introduction;
[6928] Instruction appearance non-existent refute-establish by vital point of dharmata's liberation from self-place.
[6929] First:
[6930] That nature separate from action: not realized by action, realized by non-action place—place three doors self-settled vast.
[6931] From Thalgyur:
[6932] Also other action-separate dharmata:
[6933] Liberate-to liberate by action non-existent.
[6934] Thus said, and:
[6935] From Great Garuda:
[6936] Therefore if samsara-nirvana action-action itself separate,
[6937] What other doing exists from this great perfection?
[6938] Thus said, and:
[6939] From Six Objects:
[6940] Basis place by separating from action.
[6941] Second:
[6942] Face-introduce appearance as mind's play;
[6943] Face-introduce play basis-non-existent clear appearance;
[6944] Face-introduce as delusion if grasp clear appearance;
[6945] Face-introduce self-clear non-existent appearance by non-grasping—decide outer object appearance and mind other-to non-established, empty object of samsara birth.
[6946] Also face-introduce appearance-grasping mind that basis-non-existent;
[6947] Face-introduce basis-non-existent empty self-course;
[6948] Face-introduce self-course track-non-existent primordially liberated—
[6949] Circle-maker self-mind liberated basis-non-existent, echo in three realms name-non-existent dharmata.
[6950] From Perfection:
[6951] Nature dharma-nature peace: perception object-to non-existent;
[6952] Entity non-existent itself: appearance self-search self-appearance;
[6953] Self meaning dharma-nature: appearance mind separate;
[6954] Look self object: not making send-gather.
[6955] Thus it is said.
[6956] Here some face-introduce appearance to mind.
[6957] Face-introduce mind to empty, and
[6958] From decorated face-introduction:
[6959] E ma ho: by face-introducing appearance to mind, complete to mind;
[6960] By face-introducing mind itself to empty, spread happiness to empty;
[6961] By face-introducing empty to awareness—
[6962] That only dharmakaya, awareness itself and space non-dual, appears to attach words to meaning self-characteristic.
[6963] This has intended basis,
[6964] Need purpose,
[6965] Actually harm-making valid cognition—three exist, not approaching heart-essence intention direction.
[6966] Intended basis:
[6967] For provisional purpose of grasping outer object meaning not other-to, those words said;
[6968] From Self-Arising:
[6969] Sometimes show appearance to mind.
[6970] Thus it is said.
[6971] That also: designate from only appearance to deluded mind, appearance not other-to.
[6972] Need purpose: only abandon attachment to outer objects.
[6973] Actually harm-making:
[6974] If appearance is mind, mind would be certain color shape etc. by eye etc. powers, for appearance certain as form etc. shape and color; and
[6975] Appearance mind,
[6976] Mind empty,
[6977] Empty awareness—if these three, from mutual mixing:
[6978] Conclude awareness to delusion, and
[6979] Conclude appearance not seen by eye etc., and
[6980] Conclude mind not deluded—
[6981] For these three essence substance one.
[6982] This distinction explained in detail before, and
[6983] Not liberating by making appearance mind yoga,
[6984] From Self-Arising:
[6985] Appearance mind yoga:
[6986] All arise from my mind;
[6987] What doing exists if mind itself realized?
[6988] All expressing that word—
[6989] I said not liberated.
[6990] By that scripture also harm, and
[6991] Conclude appearance non-existent when realizing mind non-existent;
[6992] From conclude appearance ceasing at time mind ceases,
[6993] Also harm from appearance existing at mind non-existent occasion.
[6994] To mind non-existent occasion: five exist.
[6995] From Middle Extremes:
[6996] Mind non-existent: sleep and faint,
[6997] Absorption entering: two,
[6998] Always perception non-existent.
[6999] Thus it is said.
[7000] Briefly gathered:
[7001] This desiring appearance as mind—great darkness of wrong thought—needs clearing.
[7002] Third: instruction appearance non-existent refute-establish by vital point of dharmata self-place liberated:
[7003] Outer five objects non-existent empty self-pure like water moon: purify not needed;
[7004] Inner mind memory thought self-dissolve track-non-existent: destroy not by effort exertion two antidotes;
[7005] Appearance mind primordially liberated spontaneous: abandon-accept superimpose not needed.
[7006] To naked copper-shining awareness: not putting elaboration garment, complete complete complete, track-non-existent equal great, releasing inside—
[7007] Enter freeing to self-arisen primordial tone of five doors.
[7008] That also: burst awareness foundation naked, self-clear essence inner,
[7009] From that nature: know as self-tone of self-arisen primordial wisdom, distinguish-non-existent whatever dawns of memory thought good bad, not follow track.
[7010] Appearance mind rough not rough,
[7011] Clear not clear,
[7012] In this that manner, releasing to vast pervasion—self-dawn in Samantabhadra's intention space.
[7013] From Six Spaces:
[7014] Great self-appearance of all beings;
[7015] Place not existent for search from other;
[7016] By self power, self-knowing—
[7017] From wherever three-thousand world,
[7018] That itself: search also, find place non-existent.
[7019] Action object of all worlds:
[7020] That itself to appearance nature,
[7021] See not-existent by whoever—
[7022] Bliss field of appearance nature.
[7023] By yogi meditating this:
[7024] Body of I, Samantabhadra,
[7025] This one possessing fortune sees.
[7026] Thus said, and:
[7027] Also:
[7028] When self-dawning condition thought to object,
[7029] Knowing this all nature non-existent—
[7030] All appearances illusion or
[7031] Like dream and reflection,
[7032] Great reflection experience not-thinking—
[7033] That dawning in whoever's continuum:
[7034] All appearances thunder,
[7035] Appearance condition not dawning to continuum,
[7036] Obtain outward-not-returning samadhi.
[7037] Thus said, and:
[7038] From Letter Non-Existent:
[7039] All arising: delusion appearance my mind;
[7040] All abiding: delusion appearance my heart;
[7041] All appearing: delusion appearance my body;
[7042] All sounding: delusion appearance my speech.
[7043] Seeing not-ceasing: appear like my form;
[7044] Hearing not-ceasing: sound like my sound;
[7045] Smelling not-ceasing: feel like my smell;
[7046] Tasting not-ceasing: tone like my taste;
[7047] Feeling not-ceasing: quick like my mind;
[7048] Secret afflictions: my miracles;
[7049] Buddhas beings: my cemetery;
[7050] All-making I: great self-clear appearance.
[7051] Thus it is said.
[7052] Then: if allowing delusion appearance to self-place release, will delusion not go again?
[7053] Although ordinary beings delude by grasping as self,
[7054] Yogis: by knowing basis-non-existent, not delude by placing self-settled without correcting-changing.
[7055] From Pearl Garland:
[7056] Those beings in samsara
[7057] Bind by self concepts' actions;
[7058] Certain liberate by knowing nature non-existent.
[7059] Thus it is said.
[7060] Also: delusion and liberation rely on inner knowing,
[7061] For outer appearance makes no delusion and liberation—
[7062] Enough to place appearance straight.
[7063] By Tilopa:
[7064] Appearance not bind; grasping binds—
[7065] Cut grasping, Naropa.
[7066] Thus the instruction.
[7067] That also: only placing self-know that actual meaning in self-tone nature,
[7068] Not correctable to good by purposefully corrected view-meditation-action, for nature unchangeable, and
[7069] For self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes not true.
[7070] From Perfection:
[7071] By thought not find primordial wisdom meaning;
[7072] By thought finding primordial wisdom meaning—
[7073] Self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7074] By meditation not see dharmakaya;
[7075] By meditation seeing dharmakaya—
[7076] Self-appearance dharmata becomes false.
[7077] By looking not realize awareness meaning;
[7078] By looking realizing awareness meaning—
[7079] Ceaseless dharmakaya becomes false.
[7080] By dharma not cut ignorance trace;
[7081] By dharma cutting ignorance trace—
[7082] Primordially pure primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7083] Thus it is said.
[7084] Thus: whatever conduct manner made, not transcend dharmata by realizing appear-know to dharmata.
[7085] Whatever appearance manner appears: dawn in play non-ceasing,
[7086] Dawn in mandala of self-arisen meaning.
[7087] Eating-drinking: dharmata approaching;
[7088] Sleeping-sitting: enlightenment accomplishing;
[7089] Formations: abiding meditation;
[7090] Exhaling-inhaling: mandala accomplishing;
[7091] Three-thousand: spontaneously accomplished mandala.
[7092] Rain-water: drip drip of self-settling;
[7093] Path: great bindu of nature;
[7094] Foot: color powder;
[7095] Movement: mudra nature;
[7096] Speech: vajra recitation;
[7097] Memory-thought: generation stage wheel;
[7098] Whatever appears: deity play;
[7099] Self-body: empowerment vase;
[7100] Descending: continuum samaya;
[7101] Knowing-awareness: self-clear instruction;
[7102] Birth-death: dharmata familiarity measure;
[7103] Self-dawn realization of aggregate six object appearance.
[7104] Spontaneously accomplished in great intention of three realms completely liberated.
[7105] From Pearl Garland:
[7106] E ma: thus all appearances—
[7107] If delusion itself self-liberates,
[7108] By what non-existent delusion not liberate?
[7109] All speaking and doing actions:
[7110] Conduct of empty-aware clarity.
[7111] Good and bad thoughts:
[7112] Meditation is great river space;
[7113] Wrong view, right desire:
[7114] View of yogi without distinction;
[7115] Hope and doubt grasping:
[7116] Result copper spontaneously arisen;
[7117] Desiring apparent mahamudra:
[7118] Eating-drinking to approaching;
[7119] Sleeping-sitting is accomplishing;
[7120] Formations: abiding;
[7121] Exhaling-inhaling: mandala accomplishing;
[7122] All three-thousand: to mandala;
[7123] Rain and steam: drip drip established;
[7124] Going path object: great bindu;
[7125] Foot trace: powder;
[7126] Desire to go: manner itself;
[7127] Limb movement: mudra;
[7128] Whatever like speaking: mantra words;
[7129] Thoughts: generation stage;
[7130] Mind moving: offering;
[7131] Appearing as form: deity body;
[7132] Great sound speaking: music;
[7133] Self body: to vase;
[7134] Hair: leaf, mouth ornament beautiful;
[7135] Blood and yellow water: all water;
[7136] Filled by substance of heart-meaning etc.;
[7137] Self-to appearing empowerments: all given;
[7138] Not conferring: complete in itself;
[7139] Desire to pass: to samaya;
[7140] Desire to keep: bind;
[7141] Desire to liberate: decline;
[7142] Desire non-existence: supreme;
[7143] All seeing: have mudra;
[7144] Attaching to that: experience;
[7145] To know-awareness clear instruction:
[7146] Object mind two: object to place;
[7147] Birth-age-sickness-death: familiarity vital point;
[7148] Aggregate six non-ceasing: realization.
[7149] Thus it is said.
[7150] Thus: yogi whatever made, deity wheel generated in dharmata nature, with empower complete instruction.
[7151] From dharmata wheel complete, self-settled river-continuum samadhi bridge not cut,
[7152] Effort exertion,
[7153] Cause-effect not depending: obtain great wonderful wonder attainment by nature, supreme ground great mandala complete.
[7154] That also from Thalgyur:
[7155] Thus all by dharmata:
[7156] What to accept: not exist;
[7157] What to place: not exist even a little;
[7158] Dharmata non-existent wherever.
[7159] From self dharmata whatever appears:
[7160] Fabricated dharmata not exist side-to;
[7161] Whatever like made: not-thinking arise;
[7162] Abandon and accept non-existent: face self-appearance.
[7163] Thus said, and:
[7164] From Self-Arising:
[7165] Not attach to appearance;
[7166] Not establish non-existent;
[7167] Not abandon existent;
[7168] Not make desire to non-existent;
[7169] Not apparent attach to existent;
[7170] Not establish made;
[7171] Not stop arisen;
[7172] Not look to fault in arisen;
[7173] Not abandon affliction;
[7174] Not establish Buddha;
[7175] Not meditate meditation;
[7176] Not view view;
[7177] Not stop delusion appearance;
[7178] Not seek equal appearance.
[7179] From Jewel Display:
[7180] When know realizing object-to appear:
[7181] Appearance self-appearance;
[7182] That time: should release know wide-to mouth—extensively said.
[7183] Three meanings spontaneously equal in great vast space: all primordially transcended complete,
[7184] Echo bind-liberate abandon-accept non-existent in nature, great name-non-existent samsara-nirvana.
[7185] By twelve great vajra laughters of great vital points of nature complete great, with eight wonder words: three realms complete liberation great,
[7186] Great name-non-existent samsara-nirvana,
[7187] Great transcendence of cause-effect,
[7188] Great primordially complete not-made,
[7189] Great primordially liberate abandon-accept,
[7190] Echo to great power-shake non-doing—
[7191] Now: not doing to dharma,
[7192] Made also: not transcend death attachment.
[7193] Expand pervasion in vast space of primordially empty sky.
[7194] From Great Secret Jewel Heap Tantra:
[7195] Kye: vajra heart essence of all Buddhas' speech.
[7196] Kye Speech Vajra:
[7197] Look to self-arisen primordial wisdom of view—
[7198] Wonder: transcending virtue-sin, view-meditation;
[7199] Ha ha: separate from benefit-harm of virtue-sin, whatever body-speech actions made, basis unmoved.
[7200] Look to nature dwell manner of things—
[7201] Wonder: appearance, hair not changed, color not transformed;

[7204] Wonder: whatever various memory-thought conduct made, dawn as play;
[7205] Ha ha: birth-non-existent liberation in non-ceasing space, however made.
[7206] Look to all-pervading primordial wisdom of dharmata emptiness—
[7207] Wonder: birth-non-existent and primordially abiding together;
[7208] Although person taking sharp weapon liberates all beings at one time,
[7209] Ha ha: separate from benefit-harm in that person's continuum.
[7210] Look to all-appearing primordial wisdom of self-knowing emptiness—
[7211] Wonder: all appearances however like dawn as self-helper;
[7212] Ha ha: unmoved from self-basis, whatever appears.
[7213] Kye Speech Vajra Heart Essence:
[7214] Look to all-liberating appearance of awareness emptiness—
[7215] Wonder: self great as self-antidote;
[7216] Ha ha: afflictions self-liberated by self.
[7217] Look to essence of all awareness emptiness—
[7218] Wonder: result self-found without effort-exertion;
[7219] Ha ha: by holding one, all samsara-nirvana pure in non-duality.
[7220] Look to all-place measure of great essence emptiness—
[7221] Wonder: six migrations appear as three bodies;
[7222] Ha ha: all migrating beings become Buddha at one time, without meditating even dust.
[7223] Kye Speech Vajra:
[7224] Look to primordially complete result of three bodies great emptiness—
[7225] Wonder: dharmata of three times without gathering-separating.
[7226] 
[7227] 
[7228] 
[7229] 
[7230] 
[7231] Kye Speech Vajra:
[7232] Complete accumulations at one time without practicing six paramitas—ha ha!
[7233] Look to all-equal primordial wisdom of awareness just-place great emptiness—
[7234] Wonder: all actions dawn as ornament;
[7235] Ha ha: liberate all abandoning-accepting by view.
[7236] Look to primordially empty great of empty empty—
[7237] Wonder: all Buddhas abide again in place;
[7238] By doing-action meditating:
[7239] Ha ha: become downfall.
[7240] Look to thing-possessing empty of not-empty—
[7241] Wonder: vehicle grasping as self to non-existent;
[7242] Ha ha: obtain birth-non-existent by being born.
[7243] Thus said: just looking at self-know, twelve laughters abide in nature—effort exertion self-destroy.
[7244] Should echo in great dharma-exhaust mind-transcendence.
[7245] That also: explain complete great self-voice straight in nature, make confidence in mind-depth.
[7246] Thus: should echo also in intention of samsara-nirvana dharma-exhaust object-non-existent by eight great wonder words.
[7247] Also from Jewel Heap:
[7248] E ma ho:
[7249] You listen, speech vajra heart essence!
[7250] By vital point of self-know itself separate from birth-death:
[7251] Cutting million beings' lives and
[7252] To person always practicing ten paramitas—
[7253] I, Samantabhadra, show: not exist distinction even dust.
[7254] Kye Speech Vajra of All Buddhas:
[7255] By vital point of elaboration-non-existent in dharmata:
[7256] Person always familiarizing-meditating emptiness and
[7257] Two persons not making emptiness in mind even for moment—become Buddha: I, Samantabhadra, show not exist distinction even dust.
[7258] Kye Speech Vajra:
[7259] By vital point of awareness itself not condition-made:
[7260] Faith-possessor making conditioned virtues benefit-not-existent and
[7261] To two persons: one always happy cutting life.
[7262] 
[7263] 
[7264] I, Samantabhadra, show: not exist distinction even dust at door of complete accumulation.
[7265] Kye Speech Vajra:
[7266] By vital point of no going-coming in awareness primordial wisdom:
[7267] Person with various dharmata signs arising in body-speech and
[7268] Two persons not training mind even moment in hearing-thinking—
[7269] I, Samantabhadra, show: not exist distinction even dust in seeing things.
[7270] Kye Speech Vajra:
[7271] By vital point of no birth-ceasing in dharmata:
[7272] To person experiencing hot-cold hells and
[7273] Two persons experiencing bliss of all Buddhas—
[7274] I, Samantabhadra, show: not exist distinction even dust at realization door.
[7275] Kye Speech Vajra:
[7276] By vital point of no change in awareness:
[7277] Person cutting mind dharma elaborations and
[7278] Two persons viewing self as permanent—
[7279] I, Samantabhadra, show: not exist distinction even dust.
[7280] Kye Speech Vajra:
[7281] By vital point of dharmakaya existing in self:
[7282] Person making various outer offerings, praises, requests and
[7283] Two persons abiding separate from doing-actions—
[7284] I, Samantabhadra, show: not exist distinction even dust at result obtainment.
[7285] Kye Speech Vajra: Therefore, person practicing these self-arisen great words finds confidence enjoying experience without effort,
[7286] Buddha in non-separate appearance and three bodies—thus said.
[7287] These eight word kings, established by eight great reasons of unchangeable meaning:
[7288] Should explain literally to sharp minds,
[7289] For certain in awareness nature that-only.
[7290] Although explain divided into two truths for inferiors, make realize later;  [7290] If explain straight: become hated.
[7291] From Self-Arising:
[7292] Lion expressing self-voice: all wild animals faint and fear;
[7293] Complete Great speaking self-voice: all lower vehicles faint—thus said.
[7294] Therefore: secret instruction for those desiring definitive meaning of cause-effect without capacity:
[7295] From before that:
[7296] These words: to hearers and
[7297] Self-Buddhas etc.—inside, not speak even dust.
[7298] Why?
[7299] By all these hearing these words:
[7300] Fear,
[7301] Astonishment,
[7302] Become faint;
[7303] Not faithful to secret mantras, mind arising—
[7304] By that ripening: become experiencing great hell of beings.
[7305] What to say of showing and hearing?
[7306] Not speak even in wind direction—thus said.
[7307] Also from common Secret Mantra:
[7308] To beings not completely ripened,
[7309] Proclaiming secrets: seventh.
[7310] Thus said, and:
[7311] Also from Bodhisattva Grounds:
[7312] Showing emptiness to untrained mind—explained as root downfall: secret.
[7313] That also: eight great wonder words making eight consciousness aggregates pure, and
[7314] Twelve great unchangeable nail letters—echo dharma-exhaust non-doing great to instruction, heart not small explained.
[7315] Release mind to great name-non-existent samsara-nirvana at one time, without hope-doubt binding-attachment.
[7316] Great yogis arrived at nature: explain straight cause-effect virtue-sin non-existent, like Padma, Vimala,
[7317] Tilopa, etc.
[7318] Although we ourselves realize thus in mind, not arrive through familiarity—
[7319] Explain together with not fearing nature and avoiding slight cause-result.
[7320] Thus: twelve vajra laughters explained three times in three instructions become thirty-six—root afflictions, dependent-arising twelve entering manner, and
[7321] Reverse from manner, and
[7322] Completely disperse: thirty-six—understand together with pure places.
[7323] Briefly explain these meanings by certain instruction; enough elaborating word meanings.
[7324] Second general meaning: decisive cut at top, binding gathering has three:
[7325] Decisive cut view to self-arisen primordial wisdom;
[7326] Maintain intention time-three time-non-existent in nature;
[7327] Echo to actual meaning dharma-non-existent primordially complete.
[7328] First: this essence of self-know empty clear without move-change, copper-shining foundation essence decisive cut—make experience by great self-settled view-meditation of spontaneously accomplished great, not making whatever correct-change by mind dharma of view-meditation-action-result.
[7329] From Perfection:
[7330] Secret mantra awareness just-place:
[7331] Knot of view-meditation-action;
[7332] To outer inner secret discriminating-awareness,
[7333] By mind concept unmoved—
[7334] Desire secret view of secret mantra;
[7335] Victorious lion dharmakaya,
[7336] Abide samadhi separate from grasping-holding,
[7337] To view sign-non-existent,
[7338] Clear great discriminating-awareness of release-equal.
[7339] Thus said, and:
[7340] Also:
[7341] From dharmakaya all arising,
[7342] Dissolve in nature object-non-existent vast space;
[7343] If not accepting-correcting: action is;
[7344] If seeing self-appearance: view is;
[7345] Explain meditation not wandering to that.
[7346] Obtain samadhi without release-place;
[7347] Hold self-place without direction-falling;
[7348] Establish primordially self-arisen without making.
[7349] Thus said, and:
[7350] In self-arisen ocean not-limited dharmata:
[7351] Self-know concept-separate golden fish moves;
[7352] Obtain separation of empty-clear samsara-nirvana.
[7353] Thus it is said.
[7354] Second: maintaining intention time-three time-non-existent has two:
[7355] Essence self-clear in nature tone: not correct-change, place inside in nature of equal clear light, dense dense coiled, self-place clear clear;
[7356] Cut track-hold continue send of self-dawning thought concepts from I,
[7357] 
[7358] Instruction clear in space self-place: place outside in great vast river-space intention pure time-non-existent three times, wide self-liberated without interval.
[7359] First:
[7360] Together with body vital point and wind vital point: firm place in self-clear knowing, self-appearance appearance without grasping-holding.
[7361] From Six Spaces:
[7362] If not making that suchness,
[7363] Like sky not covered by clouds,
[7364] Part clear primordially from primordial tone,
[7365] Thus in clear sky
[7366] Like self-appearance of sun heart,
[7367] Body stain-non-existent essence,
[7368] Heart essence certain one-gathered,
[7369] Mandala of I itself is.
[7370] Thus it is said.
[7371] Second: making experience by ten great methods of cutting mind connection of three times:
[7372] Also from That Itself:
[7373] Person by what: not holding past track,
[7374] Not taking future hope,
[7375] Then placing now knowing in self-place,
[7376] From mixing all knowing before-after non-existent into one—
[7377] Called one-gathered essence one:
[7378] Awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7379] Also: not following after track of past habits,
[7380] Not welcoming hope of later-arising habits,
[7381] Not relying on continuum of now habits—
[7382] Called awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7383] Mixing samsara-nirvana non-dual by method of memory self-ending:
[7384] Cutting interval of all past memory, and
[7385] Suppressing itself of future memory, and
[7386] Releasing to self-dissolve all now memory—
[7387] Called awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7388] Also: not sending enter to past mind,
[7389] Not sending back to future mind,
[7390] Not sending mind to now mind—
[7391] Realizing yogi equal to three times.
[7392] Also: not throwing stone to past ignorance,
[7393] Not abandoning father to future ignorance,
[7394] Not taking to side to now ignorance.
[7395] Awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7396] Not attach attach to past anger,
[7397] Not take hook to future anger,
[7398] Not feed pride to now anger—
[7399] Called realizing yogi equal to three times.
[7400] Not gather clouds by past delusion,
[7401] Not cut earth by future delusion,
[7402] Not fall rain by now delusion—
[7403] Called realizing yogi equal to three times.
[7404] Not give answer to past Buddha,
[7405] Not give threatening look to future Buddha,
[7406] Not give blame to now Buddha—
[7407] Called yogi equal to three times.
[7408] Dispel itself of past desire,
[7409] Cut all of future desire,
[7410] Take out object of now desire—
[7411] Yogi equal to three times.
[7412] Not take tight of past jealousy,
[7413] Not gather mind of future jealousy,
[7414] Not put mind of now jealousy—
[7415] Realizing yogi equal to three times,
[7416] Called great yogi realizing samsara-nirvana non-dual.
[7417] That also: three-time Buddhas
[7418] Possess distinction experience of awareness primordial wisdom—instruction abandon grasp-attach to happiness-enjoyment, and
[7419] Appear to object of nine refute-establish and self-abide scripture-not-shown delusion—
[7420] Meditate identifying abiding in dharmata wide, interval cut track connect three times.
[7421] Third: echo to actual-meaning dharma-non-existent primordially-complete.
[7422] From Lion Perfection:
[7423] Virtue: not realize Buddha meaning;
[7424] If realize Buddha meaning by virtue—
[7425] Complete Great actual meaning becomes false.
[7426] Not become fall samsara by sin;
[7427] Not become fall samsara sin;
[7428] If become fall samsara by sin—
[7429] Three moments become false.
[7430] Not see right meaning by empty;
[7431] If see right meaning by empty—
[7432] Light-clear primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7433] Not see self-know meaning by sign;
[7434] If see self-know meaning by sign—
[7435] Self-liberated dharmata becomes false.
[7436] Not find spontaneously-complete meaning by making;
[7437] If find spontaneously-complete meaning by making—
[7438] Unchangeable essence becomes false.
[7439] Not become see appearance by grasping;
[7440] If become see appearance by grasping—
[7441] Ceaseless nature becomes false.
[7442] Not become liberate other side by analyzing;
[7443] If become liberate other side by analyzing—
[7444] All-pervading heart-feeling becomes false.
[7445] Not cover I by delusion appearance;
[7446] If cover I by delusion appearance—
[7447] Two lamps become false.
[7448] Show secret mantra intention.
[7449] Thus it is said.
[7450] This secret meaning: great awe at echoing to space, should not fear straight explanation.
[7451] Third general meaning: establishing at top of confidence-liberation, obstacle removing has three:
[7452] General show meaning of self-liberation:
[7453] Particular explanation of primordially liberated actual meaning,
[7454] Extensive speaking of self-liberated intention.
[7455] First:
[7456] Here at Ati Vajra Heart Essence, king of paths certain release from affliction:
[7457] By not abandoning affliction, pure in place—
[7458] Not like hearers abandoning,
[7459] Not like beings abandoning,
[7460] Not like lower mantra transforming generation stage,
[7461] Not like complete stage releasing self-dissolution,
[7462] Not like common vehicle generally taming by antidote,
[7463] Not like mind section placing in self-manner,
[7464] Not like space section purifying by making that itself dharmata.
[7465] Why?
[7466] If not knowing affliction that primordially exists without experiencing,
[7467] Not abandon by abandoning.
[7468] If abandoning affliction by mind,
[7469] Impossible to purify by two substance one of abandon-object abandon-agent;
[7470] If abandoning by primordial wisdom, mind not see primordial wisdom;
[7471] By primordial wisdom not seeing mind—impossible term of abandon-object abandon-agent at contradiction of non-abiding together, and
[7472] No abandoning by before-after, for past-future substance oppose;
[7473] One exist at time, one cease;
[7474] If time equal: conclude abandon-object to antidote by mutual mixing, and
[7475] Conclude antidote to abandon-object,
[7476] For one continuum mind time equal.
[7477] Also: no time to abandon by abandoning at body and shadow like of affliction arising from mind that itself.
[7478] Apply also to purifying etc.
[7479] From Sun-Moon Union:
[7480] If not realize suchness,
[7481] Like yogi body and shadow,
[7482] From that self-arising that itself—
[7483] Not abandon by abandoning.
[7484] Also not by thus purifying,
[7485] Also not change by transforming.
[7486] Not realize unchangeable heart essence:
[7487] Like crystal rock or turquoise stone,
[7488] Not capable to purify and melt.
[7489] By nature abide pure—
[7490] Investigate by possessing yogi.
[7491] Also not thus peace itself;
[7492] Not knowing direct insight:
[7493] Like Meru mountain king,
[7494] Not capable to break by whoever.
[7495] Not liberate by antidote;
[7496] Not knowing self-pure without searching:
[7497] Like desiring clear sediment in muddy water,
[7498] Not clear later-later.
[7499] Although that itself clear: not dharmata;
[7500] Not knowing spontaneous self-appearance: like ordinary fool appearance,
[7501] Not reverse apparent attachment.
[7502] By thus saying: should know vital point of self-by-self liberating like water trace.
[7503] This also: from two mind levels—
[7504] Self-liberation with effort:
[7505] Identify whatever arisen affliction, place in self-place—train power in great equal self-liberation of pure abiding-movement nature, self-liberating complete complete gone without wandering even moment.
[7506] Without effort:
[7507] That arisen incapable to bear, self-liberated dharmata—
[7508] Liberate by nature nature or force without needing abandon that view-method to that.
[7509] These two mind levels: first distinction and
[7510] Abide like before-after.
[7511] From That Itself:
[7512] These two mind levels:
[7513] All with effort and without effort.
[7514] Place all with effort in self-place,
[7515] All measures of familiarized appearance:
[7516] Itself pure primordial wisdom appearance.
[7517] When self-dawning to all outer-inner,
[7518] Not arise by that condition.
[7519] Although those arise-change until,
[7520] Liberate in self-place itself by self-place.
[7521] From that: yogi appearance.
[7522] All without effort thus:
[7523] Self-by-self liberated to self itself,
[7524] From self blank self self-liberated—
[7525] Like splitting all iron by iron, and
[7526] Like breaking all stone by stone:
[7527] Self antidote self itself great,
[7528] By realizing nature complete great.
[7529] Whatever familiarized thus:
[7530] Find all meanings of non-searching placing,
[7531] Spread great bliss without meditating,
[7532] Directly know in nature itself.
[7533] Through whomsoever this wisdom meets,
[7534] Even they who bear inexpiable misdeeds,
[7535] Through habituating but to this alone—
[7536] Doubtless, they attain liberation.
[7537] Thus it is proclaimed.
[7538] The second: specific explanation of primordially-liberated ground-body, having three parts:
[7539] First, the demonstration that since liberation is finished from the beginning, at present self-liberation occurs without need for antidote of effort or striving. Second, the instruction not to transgress from the nature of that abiding-reality. Third, resting without having experienced going elsewhere from merely basisless self-dissolution in natural condition.
[7540] First: From the Pearl Garland:
[7541] Not through effort is liberation attained,
[7542] */ From the beginning abiding liberated.
[7543] And further:
[7544] Through non-recognition itself self-occurred,
[7545] */ Cause of delusion from the beginning purified.
[7546] */ Kun-gzhi as dharmakaya self-appeared,
[7547] */ Stream of birth cut at the root.
[7548] */ Yid-bzhin dgongs-pa primordially abiding,
[7549] */ Movement-makers self-settled.
[7550] */ Breath from the beginning stream-cut,
[7551] */ Birth and death from the start nonexistent.
[7552] */ Desire's qualities primordially perfected,
[7553] */ Attachment's extreme is cultivation itself.
[7554] */ Limbs unmoved, primordially gone,
[7555] */ Beings' path from the beginning traversed.
[7556] */ Spoken speech inexpressible,
[7557] */ From the beginning beyond speech and thought's object.
[7558] */ Thought's emanation-gather primordially empty,
[7559] */ From the beginning abiding in great meditation.
[7560] */ Defilements self-purified,
[7561] */ Defilement-less great zang-thal abiding.
[7562] */ Through made-by not having arising-place,
[7563] */ From the very beginning free of action and actor.
[7564] */ From basis other-arisen dharma not existing,
[7565] */ From the beginning self-occurred single-alone.
[7566] */ One and two's number exhausted,
[7567] */ Thig-le free from moon.
[7568] */ Darkness from the beginning thoroughly purified,
[7569] */ Rig-pa's appearance luminosity-pervading.
[7570] */ Samsara changeless, ceased-finished,
[7571] */ From the beginning spontaneously-perfect buddha-ground.
[7572] */ Sign's entity empty-purified,
[7573] */ Self-grasping thought from the beginning exhausted.
[7574] */ Conditions by conditions self-liberated,
[7575] */ Reference-points are cog-bzhag.
[7576] Thus.
[7577] Second: From Thal-'gyur...
[7578] 
[7579] 
[7580] 
[7581] 
[7582] 
[7583] Nature of great perfection's extreme:
[7584] Dharmas settled in their own place,
[7585] Appearance-awareness dharmata unity—
[7586] Ye-grol reaches cog-bzhag itself.
[7587] Dgongs-pa beyond thought,
[7588] Marked settled in self-place purified,
[7589] Empty and entity extremes liberated,
[7590] Movement-exhausted, concept not existing,
[7591] Thought-exhausted, mind beyond.
[7592] Thus.
[7593] From the previous:
[7594] */ Elements five themselves primordially pure,
[7595] */ Appearance as luminosity itself liberated.
[7596] */ Sense-faculties five themselves cer-settled,
[7597] */ Grasping's objects five self-place liberated.
[7598] Thus.
[7599] Third: From Thal-'gyur:
[7600] Rang-mind liberation called—
[7601] */ From one to one gone not.
[7602] */ Mind not-existing who liberates,
[7603] */ Basis perfected, going-coming not.
[7604] */ Examined not-found, cause-reason not,
[7605] */ Basis-root not-existing, empty-luminosity abides.
[7606] */ That mind self-luminous abiding,
[7607] */ Liberated by essence, direction-partition not.
[7608] */ Liberated by time, reference-basis not.
[7609] */ Liberated effort-less, effort not.
[7610] */ Liberated by confidence, effort-striving not.
[7611] */ To that, liberation by confidence explained.
[7612] */ Ye-from liberated, returning-basis not.
[7613] */ Self-liberated, antidote not.
[7614] */ Cer-loosened at seeing-place also,
[7615] */ Completely liberated, effort-less.
[7616] Thus.
[7617] That also: gates-three ye-from liberated, from-beginning effort by liberation not-needed. Body's mudra-turning etc. whatsoever not-needed—elements self-essence liberated, six-realms back not-returning. Speech's effort, essence-recitation etc. do not-needed—expression clear-pure liberated, speaking all sound-meaning's essence liberated. Mind's effort, meditation cultivation etc. do not-needed—what thought, dgongs-pa's essence liberated. Other from arising not, self-liberated, antidote existing not-possible.
[7618] Thus self-liberation's essence: antidote not-existing.
[7619] To liberation called...
[7620] 
[7621] 
[7622] 
[7623] 
[7624] 
[7625] 
[7626] 
[7627] 
[7628] Settled-only by liberation,
[7629] Knowing-only by essence-peak liberated,
[7630] Ye-grol, rang-grol, cer-grol,
[7631] Completely-liberated and so forth—
[7632] Though many, this great rang-grol
[7633] Antidote not-existing, effort not-needed is shown.
[7634] Third: extensive explanation of rang-grol's dgongs-pa, having three:
[7635] Essence briefly shown, nature individually explained, meaning's conclusion.
[7636] First: From Pearl Garland:
[7637] To rig-pa without cessation,
[7638] */ Delusion-cause not-existing, returning-place not.
[7639] */ Ye-grol is definitely transcended,
[7640] */ Rang-grol is objects-conditions exhausted,
[7641] */ Cer-grol is appearances purified,
[7642] */ Extreme-liberation is four-extremes ceased,
[7643] */ Single-liberation is many emptied.
[7644] Thus: outer-inner non-dual zang-thal's rig-pa, direct like crystal without stain. To rig-pa basis-not-existing's essence by, delusion's cause not-existing, root separated—path not. Path not-existing, result three-realms returning-place not. That ye-from liberated-finished, sky-like dgongs-pa spontaneously-accomplished-finished. Great five liberation-manners with, common vehicles all from particularly transcended essence.
[7645] Second: five—ye-grol, rang-grol, cer-grol, mtha'-grol, gcig-grol's nature extensively explained.
[7646] First ye-grol: relying upon returning-basis not-existing's essence, view-meditation effort-striving dependent all shown. Ye-she pervading, generally released, made and altered not-existing's meaning. From-whence also not-arisen, to-where also not-gone, wherever not-abiding, change not-existing's meaning.
[7647] Liberation is not like untying—view-meditation by effort not-needed. Liberation called: from abiding in rang-lugs, accepting-rejecting not-existing's meaning.
[7648] Thus body-speech-mind three relaxed-settled in rang-lugs, mind itself naturally arrived—to liberation called. That also permanently thus abiding, from common vehicles transcended.
[7649] Example of ye-from liberated...
[7650] 
[7651] 
[7652] 
[7653] 
[7654] 
[7655] 
[7656] 
[7657] 
[7658] 
[7659] 
[7660] 
[7661] 
[7662] 
[7663] 
[7664] 
[7665] 
[7666] 
[7667] 
[7668] 
[7669] 
[7670] 
[7671] 
[7672] A-li-ka's fruit, primordially ripened—
[7673] Now ripening cause not-existing, like.
[7674] Ye-grol having three: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner.
[7675] Ye-grol's understanding: not adventitious, from beginning liberated-finished. Now again liberating cause not-existing's essence—rig-pa itself from delusion not-experienced arisen.
[7676] Ye-grol as placing's establishment, having three: reason by establishment, scripture by establishment, logical-reason by establishment.
[7677] Reason by establishment: ye-from rig-pa itself liberated's essence. Rig-pa to basis not-existing, returning-place not. Root not-existing, arising-place not. Characteristics not-existing, certainty not-reached. Birth not-existing, liberating cause not-existing.
[7678] That also as ye-grol sign: meditation-accomplishment whatsoever by characteristics seeing not. That also cause-effect sequence-not's reason by established. Rig-pa to continuum not-existing, result not—karma and ripening existing not-possible.
[7679] Scripture by establishment: From Brtson-pa-don-ldan:
[7680] */ Mind itself ye-from liberated,
[7681] */ Outside from liberated condition how possible?
[7682] Thus.
[7683] Logical-reason by establishment: gtad-yal-rag-gzhag's logical-reason by accomplished. Gtad-pa ye-from liberated, that itself self-place liberated—ye-from liberated because.
[7684] That also: mind from arising-place not-existing, abiding-place not-existing, going-place not-existing's essence—ye-from liberated known.
[7685] Liberation-manner: mind empty is liberation called, or not-liberated called convention-only not-designatable. Ye-from liberated-finished's sign: now that to again liberate not-needed—mind ye-from buddha-ed.
[7686] Ye-from liberated that to: liberating cause not-existing known.
[7687] Second rang-grol: relying upon antidote not-existing's essence, lama's instruction dependent all shown.
[7688] Thus: appearing-sounding dharmas all, arisen also self from arisen...
[7689] 
[7690] 
[7691] 
[7692] 
[7693] 
[7694] 
[7695] 
[7696] 
[7697] 
[7698] 
[7699] 
[7700] 
[7701] 
[7702] 
[7703] 
[7704] 
[7705] 
[7706] 
[7707] 
[7708] 
[7709] 
[7710] 
[7711] 
[7712] 
[7713] 
[7714] 
[7715] 
[7716] 
[7717] 
[7718] Liberated also self-liberated—
[7719] Example like sky and cloud.
[7720] Thus: object-other dependent cultivation, view and conduct defect-possessing like not. Liberation by meaning called: dharmas exhausted to.
[7721] Rang-grol having three: understanding, establishment, liberation-manner.
[7722] Rang-grol's understanding: antidote not-existing's meaning. Appearance itself from appearance self-liberated—apart from appearance, dharmata whatsoever not. Thus empty etc., itself by liberated, apart not.
[7723] Example: alcohol-sick by alcohol destroyed, poison by poison destroyed, iron by iron cut—etc. like. Afflictions itself, that itself by liberated—rang-grol called.
[7724] Rang-grol as placing's establishment, having three: reason by established, scripture by established, logical-reason by established.
[7725] Reason by established: dharmata's reason by established. Liberation all rang-grol is—other by untied like not established. If other-liberation is, entity one form different appearing not-possible like. Entity's characteristic, entity certainty reached like.
[7726] Scripture by established: From Sems-sde:
[7727] */ Liberation self-occurred, other from not.
[7728] Thus.
[7729] Logical-reason by established: rang-grol-chen-po controversy-basis not-existing's logical-reason by accomplished established. Thus appearance rang-grol is—antidote other dependent not.
[7730] Liberation-manner: self by self-liberated, apart not, other not. From other text also: desire-possessing desire path made liberation etc. explained. From Kye-rdo-rje:
[7731] */ Like fire by burned to,
[7732] */ Fire that itself by warm do.
[7733] Thus etc. spoken like.
[7734] Appearance appearance self's peak from liberated itself...
[7735] 
[7736] 
[7737] 
[7738] 
[7739] 
[7740] 
[7741] 
[7742] 
[7743] 
[7744] 
[7745] 
[7746] 
[7747] 
[7748] 
[7749] 
[7750] 
[7751] 
[7752] 
[7753] 
[7754] 
[7755] 
[7756] 
[7757] 
[7758] 
[7759] 
[7760] 
[7761] 
[7762] 
[7763] 
[7764] 
[7765] Apart from appearance, liberating-cause or liberated-condition other not.
[7766] That basis-not liberated, abiding's support not, basis-root not. That basis-root not-existing's mind itself—that: From Gsang-snying:
[7767] */ Basis-root not-existing's mind this,
[7768] */ Male female not, neuter not,
[7769] */ Color not, shape not,
[7770] */ Signless not, lineage not.
[7771] Thus: that itself self from apart returning-place not, going-place not, birth not-experienced. Whence arisen's place not that—itself self not-existing's dharma, apart not: rang-grol called.
[7772] Example: snake's knot, who by not-untied, self-liberated—like.
[7773] Third cer-grol: relying upon seeing-yal's essence, tantra scripture dependent all shown.
[7774] Cer by seeing only by, that itself liberated—mother-child meet, liberation is. Appearance that itself thought not-altered, appearance by not-cut settled, self-pure liberated.
[7775] Cer-grol seeing-yal four: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner, example.
[7776] Cer-grol's understanding: cer by seeing only by, that itself seeing liberated. Moment first self to see or hear, awareness only by liberated—that to dharmata direct's reckoning reaches.
[7777] Cer-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7778] Reason: gtang-yal where also not-perceived established. Appearance seeing-peak, appearance only liberated. Awareness moving-peak, moving only liberated. Empty self-place's essence by, form cer seeing—form slight-only shown, that itself liberated. Thus sound etc. also.
[7779] That liberated how known? Form as seeing, form not-existing elaboration cut. That to cer settled, that itself liberated...

[7817] Other to entering awareness not-arising by.
[7818] Scripture by established: From Gser-gyi-snying-po's tantra:
[7819] */ Cer-grol-chen-po's view-gaze by,
[7820] */ Buddhas beings two both liberated.
[7821] Thus.
[7822] Logical-reason: direction-free self-pure's logical-reason by established. Thus appearance cer-grol is—that itself cer-place settled, settled-place liberated, liberated-place yal because.
[7823] Liberation-manner: dharma-possessing part trained, part cer-place liberated. Wherever gone not, whence come not, wherever going-place not, wherever abiding change not. Dharma-possessing general trained, appearances all cer-grol gone.
[7824] Example: like blind-intellect temple gone, seeing-limit not.
[7825] Fourth mtha'-grol: relying upon reference apart basis-not-existing's essence. Reference what to also not-pointing essence—one's extreme from liberated is, two not-abiding, two from liberated one also not-abiding. Thus both, both not etc.
[7826] Extreme: existing's extreme appearance, not-existing's extreme not-appearance, both both not's extreme four cease—liberation called convention.
[7827] Mtha'-grol reference apart three: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner.
[7828] Mtha'-grol's understanding: existing, not-existing, appearing, empty's extreme—whatsoever reference not-pointing. Meaning by this is this not's reckoning beyond.
[7829] Mtha'-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7830] Reason: reference-free essence reason by established. Whatsoever not-referenced, extreme apart is—extreme whatsoever abiding not. Therefore extreme-free, center not-perceived view called.

[7870] 
[7871] From Rtsal-chen-yon-tan-rdzogs-pa's scripture:
[7872] */ Extreme apart, liberation called, thus.
[7873] Logical-reason: one knowing all liberated's logical-reason by established. One extreme apart knowing—thus appearance designation all from liberated is, reference whatsoever not-approaching because.
[7874] Liberation-manner: existing extreme not-abiding, not-existing extreme liberated. Not-existing extreme not-abiding, existing extreme liberated. Existing-not-existing both not-abiding, both liberated, both not by, both not liberated.
[7875] Fifth gcig-grol: relying upon peerless basis-not-existing's essence, means and wisdom dependent all shown.
[7876] One great-perfection thig-le single-alone, elaboration apart is—that's natural-condition liberated, many number's extreme all emptied.
[7877] Gcig-grol peerless basis four: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner, example.
[7878] Gcig-grol's gcod-ba: gcig-grol that not-established not—one one liberated, apart not-recognized whatsoever not. Therefore rig-pa to: ye-from liberated not-liberated convention beyond.
[7879] Gcig-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7880] Reason by established: liberation all different not—one other not-existing, liberation called. Single-one rig-pa itself—that also self-awareness single-alone, not-existing's dharma apart not.
[7881] Scripture by established: From Gser-gyi-snying-po:
[7882] */ Single liberation's dharmata is,
[7883] */ Many taste-one is because.
[7884] Thus.
[7885] Logical-reason by established: one knowing all-liberated by established. One awareness knowing—samsara-nirvana all liberated because.
[7886] Liberation-manner: dharmata as recognition, appearance-awareness all liberated.
[7887] Example: many taste-one knowing—salt one's taste, certainty reached if...
[7888] 
[7889] 
[7890]

[7920] 
[7921] 
[7922] 
[7923] Salt all's taste certainty reached, or molasses and fire—one recognition, knowing all knowing—like.
[7924] From Byang-chub-sems-'grel:
[7925] */ Fire's nature heat,
[7926] */ Molasses nature sweet like.
[7927] */ Thus dharmas all also,
[7928] */ Nature empty single.
[7929] Thus like.
[7930] Thus liberation-manner five, person one calculate not—faculties' difference by, what aspiration, liberation is.
[7931] Third: liberation-manner five's conclusion five show. That also here: liberation-manner five those reference-basis apart. Rang-grol is: grasping view, meditation, conduct dharma's reference apart. Conditions conditions by liberated—example like dirt by dirt washed. Condition bad, condition bad by liberated, ye-she's companion appear. Ka-dag ka-dag by liberated, rig-pa rig-pa by liberated.
[7932] Ye-grol: grasping-grasped unity reference apart. Objects objects by liberated—poison by poisons destroyed like.
[7933] Cer-grol: samsara-nirvana two not-referenced, cause causes liberated—example iron by iron cut like.
[7934] Mtha'-grol: convention word not-referenced, dharma dharma liberated's example—wood from arisen fire, that wood that burned like.
[7935] Gcig-grol: liberating-doer thought not-referenced, mind-itself mind liberated's example—stone by stones cut like.
[7936] From Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
[7937] */ Conditions conditions by liberated because,
[7938] */ Grasping dharmas to not-reference.
[7939] */ Objects objects liberated to,
[7940] */ Grasping-grasped two not-reference.
[7941] */ Cause cause liberated to,
[7942] */ Samsara-nirvana two not-reference.
[7943] */ Dharma dharma liberated to,
[7944] */ Convention word not-reference.
[7945] */ Mind-itself mind liberated to,
[7946] */ Indicating-doer thought not-reference.
[7947] */ Dirt by dirt washed like,
[7948] */ Thus pure pure liberated.
[7949] */ Poison's poisons destroyed,
[7950] */ Iron's irons cut,
[7951] */ Stone's stones severed,
[7952] */ Wood's woods burned like.
[7953] */ Self-self enemy self does,
[7954] */ Lineage not-different liberation not.
[7955] Thus.
[7956] That-also: all rig-pa complete not-existing's essence by, rig-pa liberated time, dharmas all liberated—support-basis destroyed, support-dharma destroy like...
[7957] 
[7958] 
[7959] 
[7960] 
[7961] 
[7962] 
[7963] 
[7964] 
[7965] Rang-grol self-destroy, basis expanse equalized is.
[7966] That from:
[7967] */ Therefore basis-abiding rig-pa to,
[7968] */ Self-appeared because appearance perfected.
[7969] */ Self-occurred because basis perfected,
[7970] */ Self-appearance because objects also perfected.
[7971] */ Rang-grol because delusion-basis perfected,
[7972] */ Rang-pure because path all perfected.
[7973] */ Rang-awareness because knowables perfected,
[7974] */ Rang-pervading because result perfected.
[7975] */ Rang-place because cause-conditions perfected,
[7976] */ Rang-realized because dharmata perfected.
[7977] */ Rang-reversed because samsara-nirvana perfected,
[7978] */ Rang-abiding because tantra scripture perfected.
[7979] */ Rang-perfected because time-one perfected,
[7980] */ Rang-known because instruction perfected.
[7981] */ Rang-settled because meditation perfected,
[7982] */ Rang-feature because expanse perfected.
[7983] Thus.
[7984] Thus perfected liberated rig-pa, that itself beginning from ka-dag is, dirt not-existing, heart is, continuum exhausted. Single-alone great-bliss, speech-thought expression beyond. Ye-from thoroughly-pure zang-ka, stone-with pure empty. General-appearance samsara-nirvana's projection-feature not-stained. Dharmas exhausted, movement-dissolved, inert-awareness beyond. Natural basis's buddha abiding.
[7985] From Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
[7986] */ E-ma rang-rdzogs-chen-po's dharmakaya:
[7987] */ Ka-from pure, dirt exhausted,
[7988] */ First arisen, continuum exhausted.
[7989] */ Moon apart, reckoning beyond,
[7990] */ Suffering cause-less, great-bliss.
[7991] */ Expression's cause-less, speech-thought beyond,
[7992] */ Ye-from self-awareness thoroughly-pure.
[7993] */ Outflows exhausted, stone-with not,
[7994] */ Entity exhausted, empty abiding.
[7995] */ Two's increase-not, essence,
[7996] */ Dharma apart, means beyond.
[7997] */ Concept-not clear, movement-dissolved,
[7998] */ Inert-awareness non-dual, accumulations-two perfected.
[7999] */ Rival moon-not, cog-bzhag rang,
[8000] */ Altered word-not, all-pervading.
[8001] */ Think-doer mind-not, mindfulness apart,
[8002] */ Fresh itself, natural natural-condition.
[8003] */ Unaltered supreme, natural abiding.
[8004] Thus.
[8005] Thus outer-appearance, inner-body-mind all not-existing, clear-appearance water-moon like, realized rtsal-manifested...
[8006] 
[8007] 
[8008] 
[8009] 
[8010] 
[8011] 
[8012] 
[8013] Rig-pa sky-like meaning relying-upon: dharmas exhausted, appearance body water-moon like manifested. Walls, fence etc. touch not—eye, clairvoyance measureless attained. Aryas' truth seeing, again existence completely liberated.
[8014] Ka-dag ground liberated: elements-four's atom power-not, ye-she's fire burned. Mist dissolved like, sky's space body miracle shown. Meaning become: ye-she's fire burned atoms, those body-relic, self-relic blessing confer. Not-become: self-dissolved peace made, rig-pa dharmakaya's expanse abiding. Form-body activities with, samsara not-empty until, beings' benefit do.
[8015] From Zangs-yig-can and Rtags-tshad: appearance four measure not-reached also, stone-with not-visible, from-beginning's place liberated existing. Khregs-chod as liberation's manner clearly—rin-po-che-spungs-pa's tantra from spoken:
[8016] Not-released self-place settled's,
[8017] */ Mind this word all.
[8018] */ Who by trained not,
[8019] */ Individual intellect understood appear.
[8020] */ This itself self intellect understood,
[8021] */ Not-visible concept not-existing by.
[8022] */ Appearances all self-pure from,
[8023] */ All zang-ma thal-byung.
[8024] */ Empty-luminosity great's kind become.
[8025] */ Earth water fire wind elements four,
[8026] */ Individual power not-visible.
[8027] */ Mist like wise dissolve.
[8028] */ Delusion's attachment varieties—
[8029] */ How thought, birth-not.
[8030] */ Grasping-grasped aspects self-ceased,
[8031] */ What not-visible self-exhausted.
[8032] */ Clarity-doer self experience,
[8033] */ Bodied all thus gone.
[8034] */ Body-less mention what-needed?
[8035] Thus.
[8036] Yogin this's realization measure reached if: atom part-not, body stone-with self-place dissolve...
[8037] 
[8038] 
[8039] 
[8040] 
[8041] 
[8042] 
[8043] 
[8044] 
[8045] 
[8046] 
[8047] 
[8048] 
[8049] 
[8050] 
[8051] 
[8052] Slight not-reached also, other from transcended is—if corpse that pound-one etc., weight-only even to light etc., rig-pa ka-dag dissolved.
[8053] This's essence: rig-pa's essence zang-thal stone-with pure, habituating's portion from arisen. Mind that's delusion-appearance not-existing, clear-appearance portion also, time that self-face thoroughly-pure, mind ye-she distinguished. Mind pure, ye-she's truth seeing, thought bliss.
[8054] From Seng-ge-rtsal-rdzogs:
[8055] */ Buddha truth see, jina's son,
[8056] */ Concept heart understand, always bliss.
[8057] Thus extensively spoken, peak reached time.
[8058] [### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle]
[8059] From Theg-pa'i-mchog-rin-po-che'i-mdzod:
[8060] */ Also excellent realization liberation instruction's chapter shown, order nineteen.
[8061] Thus khregs-chod's meaning certainty placed. Now: thod-rgal's essence from stone-with light-body pure method extensively explained, two.
[8062] Khregs-chod from particularly transcended manner, particular thod-rgal itself explained.
[8063] First: particular seven by transcended:
[8064] */ Appearance light's particular,
[8065] */ Experience technique connected particular,
[8066] */ Self-appearance direct seeing particular,
[8067] */ Body essence nerve's particular,
[8068] */ Appearance-making gate's particular,
[8069] */ Seeing faculty's particular,
[8070] */ Experience increase-appearance's particular—seven.
[8071] First: khregs-chod by outer delusion-appearance's earth, stone, mountain etc., purify able-not. Object made illusion, basis-not etc., addition intellect dependent. Mind's consciousness gathered dharma dependent, quick liberation-not itself.
[8072] Thod-rgal: light-five, expanse-awareness appearance object made. Delusion-appearance name-not, intellect addition not-needed. Mind's dharma-eye consciousness etc., self-ceased training...
[8073] 
[8074] 
[8075] 
[8076] 
[8077] 
[8078] 
[8079] 
[8080] 
[8081] 
[8082] 
[8083] Samsara name-only repeat—life that, light liberated particular entered.
[8084] From Thal-'gyur:
[8085] */ This self-object shown from,
[8086] */ Circumstantial-conditions entering not.
[8087] */ Zang-ma and thal-byung,
[8088] */ Object awareness appearance aspect from,
[8089] */ Straight self basis from liberated.
[8090] Thus.
[8091] Well: khregs-chod manifested also, appearance measure not-reached, aggregates liberated shown—particular what? Very great: khregs-chod by manifested also, atom part-not from, light go not-possible. Light gone-not, vajra-body not-established. Occasional illusion-body, final not-decide. Light-body not-attained, transference great body not-attained—other benefit vast, support that not-accomplish because. Light atom dissolve portion from: transference great benefit not-do, clairvoyance and miracle accomplish, vast small particular existing.
[8092] Second: rig-pa ye-from luminosity spoken, that khregs-chod by empty measure, self-light not-see that. Thod-rgal by essence-held, dharmata essence luminosity inside captured time, dharma-possessing self-resound luminosity outside appearance technique shown existing—transcended.
[8093] From Rang-shar:
[8094] */ Self-appearance rig-pa's king this,
[8095] */ All existing, realization not.
[8096] Thus.
[8097] Third: rig-pa's ye-she khregs-chod see-not, cover addition, see not one decide that. Thod-rgal ye-she's sight open, dharmata's sun-rays clear.
[8098] From Thal-'gyur:
[8099] */ Dharmata direct appearance by,
[8100] */ Intellect grasping view suppressed.
[8101] Thus.
[8102] Fourth: khregs-chod coarse nerve-wind dependent, thod-rgal light-nerve clear recognized, lamp actual path made.
[8103] That from:
[8104] */ Also nerve delusion-mandala by,
[8105] */ Nature appearance ye-she five,
[8106] */ Bubble eye see.
[8107] Thus.
[8108] Fifth...
[8109] 
[8110] 
[8111] 
[8112] 
[8113] 
[8114] 
[8115] 
[8116] 
[8117] 
[8118] 
[8119] 
[8120] 
[8121] 
[8122] 
[8123] 
[8124] 
[8125] 
[8126] Khregs-chod: faculties six's gate not-pure, mind's dharma clear-seek from. Thod-rgal: pure luminosity's gate, ye-she's wind moved, lamp four's appearance arise—transcended.
[8127] That from:
[8128] */ Gate how arisen is,
[8129] */ Entering wind moved by.
[8130] */ Lamp four, actions four arisen.
[8131] Thus.
[8132] Sixth: khregs-chod see-not, rig-pa self-clear faculty clear-seek from. Thod-rgal: outer-inner ye-she zang-thal faculty, expanse and ye-she gather-separate not appearance, direct examine particular entered.
[8133] From Thal-'gyur:
[8134] */ Pure expanse lamp to,
[8135] */ Thig-le body delusion-appearance pure,
[8136] */ Nature itself, essence itself,
[8137] */ Non-dual gather-separate not appear.
[8138] Thus.
[8139] Seventh: khregs-chod outer-object, inner-mind's delusion-appearance appear made, abandon-accept not condition addition, quick those liberation-not itself. Thod-rgal: essence-held moment from, outer-inner delusion-appearance, delusion-grasper with self-dissolved. Not-abandoned place pure, addition not-dependent. Ye-she's increase-appearance, moon waxing upward increase. Appearance four measure reached, quick liberated itself.
[8140] That from:
[8141] */ Appear manner delusion not,
[8142] */ Cause-conditions pure nature to.
[8143] */ Entity entity-not self-pure from,
[8144] */ Gates-five's object-attachment pure.
[8145] */ Elements coarse pure,
[8146] */ Ye-she pure increase-appearance show.
[8147] */ That exhausted dharmata.
[8148] Thus.
[8149] These particular: subtle distinguish thought beyond also, outline only spoken. Briefly: rig-pa's meaning direct seeing, see existing, delusion moment reverse. Intellect dependent delusion-appearance, path made not-deluded result seek—particular great, wisdom-eye possessing realize.
[8150] Dharma this: essence such existing, all's peak supreme called.
[8151] Meaning second: particular thod-rgal itself shown, three...
[8152] 
[8153] 
[8154] 
[8155] 
[8156] 
[8157] 
[8158] 
[8159] 
[8160] 
[8161] 
[8162] 
[8163] 
[8164] 
[8165] [8165-8167]
[8166] The wheel of dharmatā's three crucial points,
[8167] The wheel of day-night luminosity,
[8168] The vast wheel of face-expanse wisdom—
[8169] Thus the three wheels turn.
[8170] [8168-8173]
[8171] Four divisions present the first:
[8172] Body's three settling points,
[8173] Gate's three seeing points,
[8174] Expanse's three guiding points,
[8175] Object's three appearance points.
[8176] [8174-8176]
[8177] First: Body's posture, whichever three held,
[8178] Stomach relaxed, nerve-wind ease abiding—
[8179] This purpose exists.
[8180] If deliberately held, wind wrong, spread arise,
[8181] Nerve twist tight—the cause.
[8182] [8177-8184]
[8183] Gaze held, wind essence very slow,
[8184] From outer held, nose drawn—
[8185] This particular dharma, great gathering.
[8186] Common method: nose out-inhale,
[8187] Wheel four's inside filled,
[8188] Mind clear-clear, meditation produced.
[8189] Wind wrong, spread, coil, dull—
[8190] Four obstacles arise,
[8191] Delusion-appearance not appearing.
[8192] Here: wind purified, increase path not made.
[8193] 
[8194] 
[8195] Wind gather obstacle mind unhappy, affliction thought movement, heart ache—all clear. Time those fierce throw, essence supreme.
[8196] That-also: wind essence this not-know, cultivate appearance increase, sign measure arise—definitely not-become.
[8197] Second: seeing gate essence three. Gaze three whichever doing, effort held not, stomach relaxed self-arrive made. Eye not-move, gaze held essence that.
[8198] From Thal-'gyur:
[8199] */ Distant-settled move not essence,
[8200] */ This time gaze three apply.
[8201] Thus.
[8202] Third: guiding expanse essence three. Eye slow corner up-down, expanse appearance limit, eye not-move, recognition movement-not, awareness clear-empty piece piece settle—essence.
[8203] That from:
[8204] */ Expanse essence guiding is.
[8205] Thus.
[8206] From Rtsal-rdzogs:
[8207] */ Dharmata mindfulness dissipated sky to,
[8208] */ Clouds-five appear, golden garuda soar.
[8209] */ Grasping-attachment concept-extreme apart, condition coo.
[8210] */ Self-appearance direction-fall-not sky to,
[8211] */ Empty-luminosity elaboration apart garuda soar.
[8212] */ Appearance grasping not, condition coo.
[8213] */ Sign elaboration apart sky to,
[8214] */ Grasping-grasped apart dharmakaya garuda soar.
[8215] */ Dharmata self-appearance thig-le, condition coo.
[8216] Thus.
[8217] Fourth: outer object sky cloud dissolve gaze, rig-pa clear-dissolved portion, appearance increase quick. Inner object expanse lamp gaze, luminosity mother-child connect. Secret object rig-pa self-clear gaze, ka-dag dharmas exhausted dgongs-pa, self-place clear essence existing.
[8218] From Rang-shar:
[8219] */ Sky empty mandala in,
[8220] */ Unaltered lamp forms four,
[8221] */ Not-ceased meaning clear.
[8222] */ Rig-pa expanse lamp is,
[8223] */ Sky empty expanse-center in.
[8224] */ Expanse nature light body,
[8225] */ Not-ceased cease-not clear.
[8226] */ Ye-she five heart body,
[8227] */ Knot manner arise.
[8228] */ That also: go and come,
[8229] */ Move and flicker.
[8230] */ Rig-pa expanse lamp to,
[8231] */ Placed rig-pa not-move if,
[8232] */ Changeless realization excellent explained.
[8233] */ Wisdom self-occurred lamp is,
[8234] */ Superimposition all cut.
[8235] */ Thig-le empty lamp is,
[8236] */ Effort not shine become if,
[8237] */ Distant-ropes water lamp by,
[8238] */ That gaze not-distracted if,
[8239] */ Complete meditation measure spoken.
[8240] Thus.
[8241] 
[8242] 
[8243] 
[8244] 
[8245] 
[8246] 
[8247] 
[8248] 
[8249] 
[8250] 
[8251] From Thal-'gyur:
[8252] */ This object essence such:
[8253] */ Cloud apart outer object empty to,
[8254] */ Yogin sky bird-path abides.
[8255] */ This not-apart dharmata.
[8256] Thus.
[8257] Also: object appearance characteristic. Sky blue-green limit-not, light color form and, ye-she five self-appearance show.
[8258] To pure expanse lamp:
[8259] */ Thig-le body delusion-appearance pure,
[8260] */ Nature itself, essence itself,
[8261] */ Non-dual gather-separate not appear.
[8262] Thus.
[8263] This's time: nerve inside wind movement, thought subtle sha-ra-ra arise also, direct meaning harm not. Thought that itself, self self-hold not-possible, liberated clear-clear go—bird fledgling held fly like. Yal object emanate also, previous knot one one continuous, spread distraction that like not. Karma habitual-patterns not-accumulate, luminosity meditation not-destroy, rig-pa's rtsal manifest make, wisdom thol-byung arise open.
[8264] That also: gaze held effort, thought great self-cease. Great small subtle all, rang-grol gone is.
[8265] From Thal-'gyur:
[8266] */ Dgongs-pa one from move not,
[8267] */ Appearance appearance's thog clear.
[8268] */ Face mirror like from,
[8269] */ Liberated that, that itself liberated.
[8270] */ Awareness movement empty-yal,
[8271] */ Seeing-awareness rig-pa different not.
[8272] */ That itself self's thog liberated,
[8273] */ One knowing all liberated because.
[8274] */ Two three's number extreme exhausted,
[8275] */ Concept grasping object not-appear.
[8276] */ Movement grasping ye-from empty,
[8277] */ Empty dgongs-pa clear perfected.
[8278] */ Many's number extreme exhausted.
[8279] Thus.
[8280] This's time: view-meditation conduct three, dgongs-pa expanse-one gather.
[8281] From Rdo-rje-sems-dpa' heart mirror:
[8282] */ Extreme-cut direction-fall not, view measure possess.
[8283] */ Clear concept not, meditation measure possess.
[8284] */ Self-occurred altered not, conduct measure possess.
[8285] */ Great-bliss outflows not, enlightenment entity-not this.
[8286] */ Grasp not-get, water-moon like.
[8287] */ Desire-all self-occurred, rich treasure like.
[8288] Thus.
[8289] That-also: expanse-awareness appearance not-arise, eye corner equal gaze...
[8290] 
[8291] 
[8292] 
[8293] 
[8294] 
[8295] 
[8296] 
[8297] 
[8298] 
[8299] 
[8300] 
[8301] 
[8302] 
[8303] In viewing, the essential point is to gaze unmoving at the midst of the sky's expanse, like unto a waterfall's cascade. And thus, from the letterless state:
[8304] */ Rig-pa resting in equipoise—this upadesa itself,
[8305] */ This the secret thig-le of enlightened intent.
[8306] */ The eyes held steadfast in absorption,
[8307] */ And thus examined apart from gathering and dispersal.
[8308] */ From the very corner of the eyes the expanse emerges,
[8309] */ Light subtle and swirling arises.
[8310] */ Its nature: lu-gu-rgyud itself,
[8311] */ Subtle, flickering, and mobile.
[8312] */ The eyes examined as the element of space,
[8313] */ The thig-le of the Buddha-body dawns.
[8314] */ Attaining the warmth of that very dgongs-pa,
[8315] */ Rig-pa's body—lu-gu-rgyud itself—
[8316] */ Together with the body, appearance dawns.
[8317] Thus.
[8318] Furthermore, at this juncture, establishing the three points of luminosity: the manner of mind's obscurations being purified in the dgongs-pa of essence; the manner of resting evenly unmoving in the state; and from that, the manner of signs, measures, and definitive time dawning. Of these three, the first has three aspects: the dgongs-pa of essence itself; the metaphor demonstrating mind and habitual patterns; and the essential summary of the manner of separation from these.
[8319] Of the first, from the Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind:
[8320] */ In the unmoving sky, rig-pa clear like unto it,
[8321] */ Clear yet unwavering—depth unfathomable.
[8322] */ Empty-luminosity, vast and open, in the great bliss expanse I wander,
[8323] */ Single-pointed clarity in the state of dharmata expanse.
[8324] */ Unmixed and perfected, established in spontaneous presence.
[8325] Thus.
[8326] The nature of rig-pa, wherein the four wisdoms self-manifest as one's own rtsal, demonstrates the natural state of superior seeing. The four wisdoms, from Rang shar:
[8327] Furthermore, regarding the nature of rig-pa:
[8328] */ The fourfold wisdom it possesses,
[8329] */ These four wisdoms are thus:
[8330] */ The liberating wisdom—
[8331] */ Liberates all completely.
[8332] */ Liberates into the pure field of kleshas,
[8333] */ Liberates into the state free from concept and birth,
[8334] */ Liberates into the expanse of rig-pa from non-recognition,
[8335] */ Liberates conceptual wisdom into the state.
[8336] */ Therefore, the liberating wisdom.
[8337] */ The activating wisdom—
[8338] */ Activates the five bodies into pure expanse,
[8339] */ Activates the five lights into non-grasping expanse,
[8340] */ Activates rig-pa ye-shes into expanse,
[8341] */ Activates the lamp into space-expanse.
[8342] */ Therefore, the activating wisdom.
[8343] */ The gathering wisdom—
[8344] */ Gathers elements into the five lights,
[8345] */ Gathers space into the lamp,
[8346] */ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
[8347] */ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
[8348] */ Therefore, the gathering wisdom—
[8349] */ Gathers elements into the five lights,
[8350] */ Gathers space into the lamp,
[8351] */ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
[8352] */ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
[8353] */ Therefore, the gathering wisdom.
[8354] */ The discriminating wisdom—
[8355] */ Discriminates non-recognition and rig-pa as two,
[8356] */ Discriminates kleshas and ye-shes as two,
[8357] */ Discriminates pure and impure as two,
[8358] */ Discriminates samsara and nirvana as two,
[8359] */ Discriminates realization and non-realization as two,
[8360] */ Discriminates good and bad as two.
[8361] */ Therefore, the discriminating wisdom.
[8362] Thus.
[8363] Furthermore, the second: through the purification at that very time of mind and habitual patterns—the objects to be purified by dgongs-pa...
[8364] 
[8365] 
[8366] 
[8367] 
[8368] 
[8369] 
[8370] 
[8371] 
[8372] 
[8373] 
[8374] 
[8375] The metaphor for this is:
[8376] From the mirror of Vajrasattva's heart:
[8377] "A ho! Listen, Vajra holder!
[8378] Unripened conceptual samsara
[8379] Is like a corpse on a gibbet with irons inserted—
[8380] Without liberation, the time of liberation does not arise.
[8381] With the irons of ignorance inserted, one cannot become liberated.
[8382] Ignorance is like water—it gathers afflictions.
[8383] The fire of aversion is like a mass of fire at the end of an eon.
[8384] Attachment to entities is like drinking salt water.
[8385] Delusion's thickening is like darkness in an empty house.
[8386] Pride and arrogance are like overthrowing a mountain.
[8387] Jealousy and ill-will are like blindness in a narrow valley.
[8388] These five afflictions obscure wisdom.
[8389] The mind is like a thieving bitch.
[8390] Consciousness is like a forest monkey.
[8391] Mind is like impure mud and swamp.
[8392] The alaya is like a pig being.
[8393] Knowing is like a bird's feather carried by the wind.
[8394] Apprehending and grasping are like man and woman.
[8395] The distinction of karma is like a bird tangled in snares.
[8396] The distinction of suffering is like a whirlpool in water.
[8397] There is no method to endure the fruit of afflictions.
[8398] This fixated peg of apprehending and grasping, the suffering of samsara—
[8399] Through action one cannot exit; through release one becomes liberated.
[8400] Abandoning all done dharmas, easy accomplishment.
[8401] Abandoning all thought, supreme wisdom unmoving.
[8402] By the king of secret mantra, afflictions become wisdom.
[8403] Like raising a lamp in an empty house,
[8404] By the lamp of wisdom, ignorance becomes awareness.
[8405] Thus it is said.
[8406] Third, the summary of the way of separation from that has three parts:
[8407] The actual way of separation in one's own time through direct perception,
[8408] Establishing the proof of separation,
[8409] Speaking of other enumerations.
[8410] The first is:
[8411] By looking at the clear light of outer appearances,
[8412] Without delusion, when the meditation of inner self-tone is clear in its own place,
[8413] Mind and wisdom split instantly—the alaya with its eight collections is obscured by wisdom,
[8414] Samsara dharmas are not clear.
[8415] Spontaneously accomplished as one's own passed nature is—
[8416] From Samantabhadra's mind mirror:
[8417] Awareness separated from mind is actual buddhahood,
[8418] Wisdom separated from intellect is actual intent,
[8419] Light rays separated from interior are actual pure appearance.
[8420] Thus it is said, and
[8421] From Self-Arising:
[8422] Awareness separated from mind is actual buddhahood,
[8423] I, Vajrasattva, separated from intellect,
[8424] Know without concept in clarifying appearance,
[8425] Concept-free discriminating awareness equality is
[8426] Great self-liberation through itself.
[8427] Thus it is said.
[8428] Second, the proof is:
[8429] By placing unmoved in the nature of appearance, samsara dharmas go to self-awakening—like sediment self-awakening through unmoved water.
[8430] Showing intent difficult to measure in depth through the metaphor of a jewel in clear water—
[8431] From the previous:
[8432] This drop of self-arising nectar,
[8433] Like a jewel in clear water,
[8434] When possessing sediment is placed, the sediment clears.
[8435] Thus this heart pith instruction,
[8436] When applied, afflictions do not become stains.
[8437] Thus and:
[8438] Single and alone, easily appearing as companion,
[8439] In the unborn expanse, clear light wisdom,
[8440] Exists in all, yet seen by none.
[8441] Like the sky's expanse, immeasurable by measure,
[8442] Like the sun's light, clear and shining,
[8443] Like Mount Meru, king of mountains, unchanging,
[8444] Like the ocean's depth, deep and difficult to measure,
[8445] Like the lotus of mud, without stain,
[8446] Like the moon in water, without face-grasping,
[8447] Like the sky's miracle, appearing as whatever,
[8448] Like the rainbow, clear and complete.
[8449] Thus it is said.
[8450] Third, speaking of other enumerations is:
[8451] All intent such as expanse and awareness dissolving into the single expanse of root awareness, cutting and deciding—
[8452] Again from that same source:
[8453] Deliver all meaning into the expanse without arising,
[8454] Make recognize the lamp of the enlightenment path,
[8455] Gather all dharmas into the nature separated from speech,
[8456] Deliver all tantras into the great tantra without letters, the great tantra of one's own awareness.
[8457] Deliver all scriptures into the great root scripture without showing.
[8458] Deliver all oral instructions separated from the basis of speech.
[8459] Deliver all accomplishments separated from actor and acted.
[8460] Deliver all conduct into the great supreme unfabricated.
[8461] Deliver all meditations into the great clear without grasping.
[8462] Deliver all views wide open, not attached to anything.
[8463] Deliver all fruits into the great wisdom of single cut.
[8464] Gather all those into a single expanse of non-abiding.
[8465] Release all actions of samsara.
[8466] Constantly familiarize with the appearance of wisdom.
[8467] Recognize the time when wisdom arises.
[8468] Know all basis dharmas as essence, nature, and compassion—three.
[8469] Know all path dharmas as five kayas and five wisdoms.
[8470] Know all fruit dharmas as three kayas without returning.
[8471] Know all essence dharmas as empty.
[8472] Know all nature dharmas as clear.
[8473] Know all compassion dharmas as pervading all beings.
[8474] Know all wisdom dharmas as unmixed.
[8475] Know all light dharmas as without grasping.
[8476] Know all ray dharmas as without emanating or gathering.
[8477] Know all awareness dharmas as separated from self-concept.
[8478] Thus deliver all dharmas without conceptualizing or thinking anything.
[8479] Second, regarding the way of placing unmoved and equal in the nature, from two:
[8480] The brief presentation of placing in the nature of essence is:
[8481] From Thal 'gyur:
[8482] The characteristic of meditation, the way of appearing:
[8483] The characteristic of empty-clear awareness,
[8484] Nature unmixed wherever,
[8485] Apprehending and grasping extremes exhausted,
[8486] Dharmata's own face pure.
[8487] Thus it is said.
[8488] The extensive explanation of placing in the appearance of nature is:
[8489] From Six Expanses:
[8490] Direct the nose toward the three passed kayas.
[8491] Supporting the back toward the three kayas of the future,
[8492] Enjoying the three kayas of the present
[8493] Is making manifest the fruit of the buddhas,
[8494] Called abiding primordially in the equality of the three times.
[8495] Making the five wisdoms of the past the basis,
[8496] Directing the peak toward the five wisdoms of the future,
[8497] Making the five wisdoms of the present the path
[8498] Is called gathering the clear light of clarity,
[8499] The yoga of awareness in the equality of the three times.
[8500] Having confidence in the past awareness,
[8501] Holding the measure of the future awareness,
[8502] Making the present awareness the path
[8503] Is called the mother holding the son,
[8504] The yoga of awareness in the equality of the three times.
[8505] Holding the portion of the past thigle,
[8506] Directing the mind toward the future thigle,
[8507] Gathering the present thigles into one
[8508] Is called cutting the single unique root,
[8509] Called the yoga practitioner gathered in the equality of the three times.
[8510] Joining with the gap of the past expanse,
[8511] Expanding with the expanse of the future,
[8512] Abiding in one ground with the present expanse
[8513] Is called awareness entering the expanse,
[8514] Called abiding primordially connected in the equality of the three times.
[8515] Directing the nose toward the lamps of the past,
[8516] Holding in hand the lamp of the future,
[8517] Striking clarity upon the present lamps
[8518] Is the view of the self-pure lamp of the empty dhatu,
[8519] Appearance primordially in the equality of the three times.
[8520] Giving the path to the lights of the past,
[8521] Placing the mind upon the lights of the future,
[8522] Lowering the mind upon the present lights
[8523] Is called self-confidence reaching all appearances,
[8524] Primordially without gathering or separating in the equality of the three times.
[8525] Third, from that, the way signs, measures, and times certainly appear has three parts:
[8526] The signs of the three kayas of clear light,
[8527] The measure of spontaneously accomplished samadhi,
[8528] The time of unmoved equal placement.
[8529] The first is:
[8530] Again from that same source:
[8531] By direct placement in the first samadhi,
[8532] Through gradual familiarity with the three kayas,
[8533] In the yoga of the nature of entities,
[8534] This meaning becomes supremely near.
[8535] The samadhi experience of familiarity with the three kayas
[8536] Is not instantaneous arising—
[8537] All this is the gradual object of mind.
[8538] First, obtaining the nirmanakaya samadhi:
[8539] At that time, in one's own knowing,
[8540] All dharmas not seen before
[8541] Appear in the mind without thought.
[8542] The words of one's own pith instruction terms
[8543] Clear in the mind without being held.
[8544] For the person possessing good fortune,
[8545] The mind expanding by the taste of dharma,
[8546] For six or seven days the body
[8547] Does not feel what exists,
[8548] Rising above the earth,
[8549] The experience of going in mid-space
[8550] Arises as one's own activity field.
[8551] When awareness unfabricated is placed in the castle,
[8552] One obtains the nirmanakaya thus.
[8553] Passed that, by awareness unmoving,
[8554] The sambhogakaya itself also
[8555] In the continuum of one's own knowing,
[8556] Without all effort in self-appearance,
[8557] Arises thus as experienced taste.
[8558] Also the light appearances not seen before,
[8559] Who sees piece by piece—
[8560] This too trains toward the sambhogakaya.
[8561] For that yogi possessing fortune and family,
[8562] Each experience of self-clear knowing clears,
[8563] By familiarity with self-clear mind,
[8564] The inner clear, mind moving, is not cast outward,
[8565] Mind does not follow the traces of entities,
[8566] Worldly actions do not appear to mind.
[8567] By this one obtains the complete sambhogakaya.
[8568] Then, awareness in the sky,
[8569] By the view manner of great direct placement,
[8570] By equal placement without distraction,
[8571] Again the dharmakaya samadhi appears.
[8572] At that time, knowing clears from the depths,
[8573] Directly engaging like an infant,
[8574] This is the measure of increasing appearance.
[8575] By sharp and quick knowing,
[8576] One sees buddhas not seen before.
[8577] By this, at that time, people—
[8578] Hundreds of thousands of myriads appear to mind,
[8579] Crafts without knowing that the body's
[8580] Previous not-made actions,
[8581] All miracles and letters,
[8582] Signs, speech, and dependent arising,
[8583] Whatever was not seen before—
[8584] All this is experienced as taste,
[8585] Earth, water, fire, and wind.
[8586] Through this, sound too attains autonomy.
[8587] Summarily, the six clairvoyances as well
[8588] This fortunate one obtains,
[8589] And benefits both self and others—
[8590] This person shall accomplish.
[8591] Thus it is spoken.
[8592] Second, the measure of spontaneously accomplished samadhi:
[8593] From that very source:
[8594] The intention of the three self-arisen bodies
[8595] Is summarily found as experience-measures thus.
[8596] The yoga conduct of emanation-body—
[8597] Formerly nonexistent great compassion
[8598] Arises supreme within one's continuum.
[8599] At this time, emanation-body samadhi is obtained.
[8600] The experience of clear yet non-conceptual cognition
[8601] Is called enjoyment-body samadhi.
[8602] The uncontaminated emptiness bindu-body,
[8603] When self-arising without effort—
[8604] The samadhi of Dharma-body
[8605] This endowed yogin obtains.
[8606] Thus it is spoken.
[8607] Second, the measure of spontaneously perfect samadhi:
[8608] Again from that same source:
[8609] The self-arisen intention of the three bodies
[8610] Is found in summary as measures of experience thus.
[8611] Practicing the yoga of emanation-body,
[8612] Great compassion previously nonexistent
[8613] Arises supreme within one's own continuum.
[8614] At this time, the samadhi of emanation-body is obtained.
[8615] The experience of clear non-conceptual knowing
[8616] Is called the samadhi of enjoyment-body.
[8617] The bindu-body of uncontaminated emptiness,
[8618] When self-arising without effort—
[8619] The samadhi of Dharma-body
[8620] This yogin endowed obtains.
[8621] Thus it is spoken.
[8622] Third, the time of immovable equipoise has two aspects:
[8623] The time when luminosity appears manifestly,
[8624] And the time when instructions strike the arising-place.
[8625] First:
[8626] From that same source:
[8627] When all appearances become self-powered,
[8628] When awareness is demonstrated manifestly,
[8629] This is called the time of true-seeing intention.
[8630] When all appearances arise in self-direction,
[8631] When experience-seed increases,  [8617] This is called the time when awareness reaches balance.  [8618] When the power of arising persons ceases,  [8619] When cognition looks inward,  [8620] This is the time of striking awareness's arising-place.  [8621] When Dharma-nature, free from conditions, causes all appearances to spread wide in bliss,  [8622] This is called the time of mother-son Dharma-nature equality.  [8623] When the true light-rays of all Buddhas fill and expand one's body,  [8624] When body manifests enlightenment,  [8625] This is called the time of obtaining self-stability.  [8626] Thus it is spoken.  [8627] Second, the time of striking the instruction arising-place:  [8628] From Self-Arising:  [8629] When cognition-awareness arises in the continuum,  [8630] Recognize the face of body.  [8631] When realization arises in the continuum, recognize the face of awareness's field.
[8632] When samadhi becomes power, recognize the lamp's face of complete purity.
[8633] When special power arises,
[8634] Recognize the spreading of samadhi's path.
[8635] When seeing the body of awareness, know without desiring mind.
[8636] When special wisdom arises in the continuum, recognize demonic deception.
[8637] When difficulty-free conduct overflows the expanse,
[8638] Recognize wisdom's direction of entry.
[8639] When emptiness pervades the field, recognize light.
[8640] When lamp appears in the field,
[8641] Recognize space and field.
[8642] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8643] When appearance comes piece by piece,
[8644] The expert must thoroughly examine.
[8645] When extremely subtle and flickering,
[8646] Through familiarity, thoroughly settle.
[8647] When fluttering, subtle, and flickering,
[8648] Through seeing, thoroughly hold.
[8649] When round, subtle, and coiling,
[8650] The expert steadies samadhi without distraction.
[8651] When sinking, blazing, and hurling appear,
[8652] Through familiarity, hold the expanding appearance.
[8653] When truly appearing in every way,
[8654] The expert explains the gathering of appearance.
[8655] When without attachment and fixation,
[8656] The expert must know the method of holding.
[8657] This is the characteristic of secret mantra familiarity.
[8658] Thus it is spoken.
[8659] Second, the day-night luminosity wheel has three aspects:
[8660] Recognizing the space-luminosity arising-base,
[8661] Demonstrating lamp-experience from that,
[8662] Determining the day-night wheel manner of meditation.
[8663] First:
[8664] Although explained formerly,
[8665] Here it is thoroughly condensed, five clear demonstrations:
[8666] The manner of space,
[8667] The manner of lamp's location,
[8668] The manner of space-awareness arising,
[8669] The manner of taking experience,
[8670] The manner of special determination.
[8671] First:
[8672] The space-luminosity bliss-gone heart essence abides without difference in all sentient beings.
[8673] From Jewel Variegated:
[8674] Like butter spontaneously present within sesame or mustard seed,
[8675] Within sentient beings appearing as bodies,
[8676] The thus-gone seed
[8677] Abides with compatible light as self-nature.
[8678] 
[8679] From that abiding, through pure doors of entering the path,
[8680] Emerge variously and conduct benefit.
[8681] Sentient beings pervade like the sky—
[8682] The meaning of awareness is also just thus.
[8683] Thus it is spoken.
[8684] Where does it exist?
[8685] From that same source:
[8686] Ah! The location-condition of awareness
[8687] Abides within one's own heart center.
[8688] Holding the portions of father-mother two,
[8689] It abides as method and wisdom.
[8690] Holding the father's portion, method-body,
[8691] Holding the mother's, wisdom-body,
[8692] It abides as light and light-ray.
[8693] Thoroughly adorned by space and awareness,
[8694] It abides as spontaneously complete great bindu.
[8695] Thus it is spoken.
[8696] How do body and wisdom abide within awareness's expanse of light?
[8697] What are the determined locations?
[8698] From Power-Perfect:
[8699] Within each self, citta jewel,
[8700] Color-filled light blazes, vase-manner,
[8701] Within, wisdom-fire light blazes,
[8702] Measureless wisdoms many appear.
[8703] Upon each body essence,
[8704] Speech emanations numberless,
[8705] Mind intention unsurpassable, one.
[8706] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8707] The all-ground great dharma-arising treasure,
[8708] Awareness wisdom abides as mound,
[8709] Appearance hold-without, field-treasure,
[8710] Awareness wisdom abides in space.
[8711] Secret-assembly jewel eight-cornered treasure,
[8712] Awareness wisdom abides as mound,
[8713] Appearance hold-without, field-treasure,
[8714] Awareness wisdom abides in space.
[8715] Secret-assembly jewel eight-cornered treasure,
[8716] Awareness wisdom father-mother manner,
[8717] Life-assembly jewel four-cornered treasure,
[8718] Awareness wisdom abides in bindu,
[8719] Meaning-coil bandha measureless treasure,
[8720] Awareness wisdom abides as wrathful-body,
[8721] Cease-without clear two-door treasure,
[8722] Space and nadi-thread abide.
[8723] Emptiness sign-free sky treasure,
[8724] Awareness wisdom abides as light—
[8725] This is demonstrated as the secret treasure.
[8726] Thus it is spoken.
[8727] Moreover, that nature of awareness, base-heart location, abides within the five space-lights like a peacock egg.
[8728] When arising on the path-space, sky rainbow-light and
[8729] When reaching the end, like a fetus liberated from the eggshell.
[8730] From Power-Perfect:
[8731] The awareness abiding in the base
[8732] Perfects the three bodies in wisdom-space.
[8733] Like a peacock egg,
[8734] Within, light-wisdom clearly demonstrated.
[8735] The awareness arising on the path
[8736] Is demonstrated like a rainbow.
[8737] The awareness delivering to the end
[8738] Is like peacock chicks
[8739] Breaking through and emerging.
[8740] Thus it is spoken.
[8741] Moreover, when wisdom is unripe, all open;
[8742] At the time of appearance, light;
[8743] At the time of familiarity, body-appearance.
[8744] From that:
[8745] From the space without elaboration,
[8746] Unobstructed luminosity contact arises.
[8747] At the time of appearance, light appears;
[8748] At the time of perfection, self-appearance.
[8749] At the time of familiarity, becomes body.
[8750] By wisdom-method relation,
[8751] See the five ultimate mandalas.
[8752] Thus it is spoken.
[8753] The characteristics of thus-abiding body, awareness, space, and wisdom:
[8754] From that same source:
[8755] The characteristic of body is thus:
[8756] Unchanging, clear,
[8757] Empty, and free of concepts.
[8758] The characteristic of awareness is thus:
[8759] Subtle, emanating,
[8760] Nadi-thread, and moving.
[8761] The characteristic of space is thus:
[8762] Vast, spontaneously thick, infinitely empty,
[8763] Clear, warm, cool,
[8764] Holding the nature of flexibility and movement,
[8765] Pervading, rim-wall.
[8766] The characteristic of wisdom is thus:
[8767] Arising, arisen, self-clear,
[8768] From, knowing, and realizing.
[8769] Clear, blazing, infinitely pervading,
[8770] Appearing, dark, opening,
[8771] The supreme wisdom of emptiness-clear—
[8772] These are considered the characteristics of secret mantra.
[8773] Thus it is spoken.
[8774] Second, the manner of lamp's location:
[8775] For gods, one cubit.
[8776] For demigods, four fingers.
[8777] For humans, one color-point.
[8778] For animals, self-clear.
[8779] For pretas, like a sesame seed.
[8780] For hell-beings, like a horse-hoof.
[8781] For Buddhas, immeasurable.
[8782] Bodhicitta, one arrow;
[8783] For emanation-body, one fathom.
[8784] The existence of self-light wisdom-appearance
[8785] From that same source:
[8786] Wisdom locations, large and small,
[8787] From the six directions of appearance
[8788] Are thoroughly explained thus:
[8789] For those in Joyful, one cubit abides.
[8790] For those in Strife, four fingers abide.
[8791] For those with equal, one color-point.
[8792] For those with two, only self-clear.
[8793] For those with hunger, like sesame seed.
[8794] For those with suffering, like horse-hoof.
[8795] Thus it is explained they abide.
[8796] For Buddhas, immeasurable.
[8797] For Bodhisattvas, one arrow.
[8798] For emanation-bodies, one fathom abides.
[8799] For Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,
[8800] And emanation-bodies and gods,
[8801] They appear in manifest fields.
[8802] Below those, in five fields,
[8803] Undemonstrated, they are not seen.
[8804] Thus it is spoken.
[8805] Moreover, the great lamp-appearance of Buddha, Bodhisattva, and god triad self-appearing in intermediate space is due to vast fields; the other five are small because they are fields of one's own body.
[8806] 
[8807] Third, the arising manner of space-awareness has two aspects:
[8808] Space is the outer field-pervasion of great blue light, the self-glow of five lights existing within as five wisdoms; from that expanding, five-possessed great wisdom light two self-arise as field-appearance.
[8809] 
[8810] Awareness is the appearance of vajra nadi-thread with portion-body.
[8811] From Power-Perfect:
[8812] The view-essence of all Buddhas
[8813] Does not surpass space-awareness two.
[8814] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8815] From Vajra Nadi-Thread itself:
[8816] Portion-body is unthinkable.
[8817] To self-arisen space-lamp,
[8818] Self-appear light is unthinkable.
[8819] To bindu-empty lamp,
[8820] Ray-possessed bindu is unthinkable.
[8821] To the essence of five wisdoms,
[8822] Demonstrating words are unthinkable.
[8823] To condition-free field-appearance,
[8824] Cease-free arising is unthinkable.
[8825] Thus it is spoken.
[8826] Fourth, the manner of taking experience has two aspects:
[8827] Constriction by essential point, and
[8828] The experience-appearance arising from that.
[8829] First, also general placing-method, and
[8830] Particular essential-method, two:
[8831] First:
[8832] From Self-Arising:
[8833] In the sky of self-appearing Dharma-nature,
[8834] Awareness-wisdom without distraction,
[8835] When placed in hold-free state,
[8836] See pure wisdom's self-appearance;
[8837] Reverse non-awareness's delusion-appearances.
[8838] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8839] Upon the banner without setting,
[8840] The lamp without change is clear.
[8841] Upon wisdom without concepts,
[8842] The five lights without clear-obscure are clear.
[8843] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8844] Upon jewel precious nectar,
[8845] By doing and meditating, one does not find.
[8846] Upon lamp's space-appearance,
[8847] Examine without distraction, clear, without holding.
[8848] Thus, not distracted from meaning,
[8849] This is the precious nectar lamp.
[8850] Without release and placing, the supreme finding;
[8851] Without holding, self-liberation.
[8852] Thus it is spoken.
[8853] Second:
[8854] From Thalgyur:
[8855] Body's essential point is by resonance.
[8856] Wisdom's posture is by pure.
[8857] Bindu coils and stirs, accomplishing.
[8858] Light extends and gathers.
[8859] Connection-possessed restraining is wind's essential point.
[8860] Entering action is distinguished by end.
[8861] By that changer, wind ceases.
[8862] Join with delusion's encounter.
[8863] Awareness's essential point: releasing and
[8864] Coiling, placing in sky.
[8865] Space's essential point: gathering and
[8866] Drawing, joining element-overflow.
[8867] Appearance's essential point: increasing and ceasing,
[8868] Various self-liberations.
[8869] Thus it is spoken.
[8870] Moreover, when seeing body, look at that perfect essential point's resonance without changing.
[8871] When at wisdom-fortress-mouth etc., posture does not change.
[8872] When bindu does not expand, roll to eye-center and constrict light-root.
[8873] When light overflows, place at brow.
[8874] When concepts scatter, bind and emit wind.
[8875] Awareness's essential point: release nadi-thread to sky.
[8876] Space's essential point: gather to center, lead from eye-corners, look.
[8877] These are all essential points.
[8878] Second, thus when taking experience, the essential points of space-awareness gradually arising through experience:
[8879] From first experience-taking until perfect end.
[8880] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8881] That self-appearing awareness-thing
[8882] Abides in wisdom's nadi-thread.
[8883] Like swift-flying winged ones
[8884] Going everywhere in mere moments,
[8885] When reached by arrow,
[8886] Becomes like swift deer.
[8887] Then, not distracted from meaning,
[8888] Like bees circling nectar.
[8889] Then, when looking at self-appearance,
[8890] It abides like a mirage.
[8891] Then, not distracted from meaning,
[8892] Becomes only movement or fluttering.
[8893] Not distracted from that meaning,
[8894] Becomes sinking and blazing.
[8895] Therefore, when looking very carefully,
[8896] See light-appearance without going or coming.
[8897] When stable in that meaning,
[8898] See the bindu-empty lamp.
[8899] When truly looking at that,
[8900] See bindu with body.
[8901] Not distracted from that meaning,
[8902] Delusion-appearances become seen as enjoyment-body.
[8903] All those body-appearances
[8904] Are like illusion-rainbow.
[8905] Becoming thoroughly stable in that,
[8906] Day and night without—
[8907] Like the eye of a vixen,
[8908] Without day and night.
[8909] Self-appearing mandala is thus.
[8910] Thus it is spoken.
[8911] Moreover, all empty-form rainbow-light bindu-bodies etc.
[8912] Are widely said to exist in outer intermediate space, and
[8913] One holds that they exist there,
[8914] But this is error, not thus.
[8915] All exist within the clear light-root of the inner body.
[8916] By the clarity of eye's light-root, one sees empty-forms inwardly.
[8917] Moreover, the heart's resonance-root pervading all and emanating
[8918] Is now the time of base-appearance arising.
[8919] Knowing self-face and clearly placing in self-glow,
[8920] Going increasingly clear,
[8921] When wind-mind pure, seeing what spontaneous appearance is within body, when entering within as power-base dissolves,
[8922] Reaching measure, goes to cease.
[8923] When setting again, base-appearance dissolves into base, liberating into primordial purity,
[8924] When that appearance appears to expand, expanding without self-characteristic.
[8925] There is no obscuration from reversing inward.
[8926] Here, what tantra and instruction say exists in outer sky:
[8927] For now, said intentionally—when placing eye on outer sky condition, the portion seen and seeming to exist there.
[8928] Naturally, if it existed outside, others could also see it;
[8929] Know it does not exist outside.
[8930] That others do not see one's empty-form is due to body obscuration.
[8931] Self-seeing is like seeing sun-arisen appearance within the hole of seeing-arising through pure light-root's gap.
[8932] The proof: by seeing empty-forms with closed eyes, one knows they exist within.
[8933] Therefore, body-appearances etc. appear as if existing in outer fields, though not existing there—
[8934] Like face appearing when looking in mirror.
[8935] In the mirror of clear inner light-root,
[8936] That heart-awareness's face-like resonance-appearance
[8937] Arises from the portion of pure light-root's quality, seen within though not in field.
[8938] Outer and inner two portions mixing in mere appearance—delusions also, many are true.
[8939] Understanding manner thus, a person possessing wisdom, arisen from Great Perfection's expanse, is called
[8940] A yogin like myself of various self-liberation.
[8941] Joining these manners with confident scripture:
[8942] From the great Lion Power-Perfect Tantra:
[8943] All those body-appearances
[8944] Are not field-appearances.
[8945] Like a young girl
[8946] To the mirror's clear characteristic,
[8947] Seeing her own face appear—
[8948] To Dharma-nature's field-sky,
[8949] Awareness-appearance arises as body.
[8950] Seeing one's own location-condition
[8951] Does not exist in field.
[8952] Pure reference manifestly clear,
[8953] With one's own center and mandala.
[8954] Though wisdom-meaning has no field,
[8955] At sentient-being time, appears like field.
[8956] Great realization in seen field,
[8957] Great bliss in understood field,
[8958] Great experience in seen appearance,
[8959] Self-awareness alone, supreme companion.
[8960] Because not existing in the field of appearance,
[8961] From Vajra Nadi-Thread itself:
[8962] Portion-body is unthinkable.
[8963] Thus it is spoken.
[8964] This has a reason to be understood; intelligent ones should know it.
[8965] Naturally easy to realize, saying body-appear has no contradiction,
[8966] For the confused, it should be explained that space-awareness and lamp-appearance in outer sky are easy to realize.
[8967] The reason for understanding within oneself is as before.
[8968] Fifth, the manner of special determination:
[8969] By the essential point of awareness without change,
[8970] First, though transcending from base and deluding in samsara, awareness does not go bad.
[8971] Then, when the lama introduces the face, losing and wandering, later at deciding time there is joy.
[8972] At first losing, the two awarenesses of delusion-time have no good-bad distinction.
[8973] Awareness not meditated and
[8974] At time of meditating, without distinction,
[8975] At time of wandering and
[8976] At time of passing, awareness has no good-bad.
[8977] At time of going to sleep and
[8978] At time of waking and
[8979] At time of going-coming, awareness has no good-bad distinction, like thus.
[8980] However, there is only dream joy-suffering of good-bad appearance manner;
[8981] Depending on that, one meditates the path.
[8982] It is not hope that essence goes to good,
[8983] For awareness has no transfer-change.
[8984] Thus also from Self-Arising:
[8985] E ma ho!
[8986] This precious jewel nectar,
[8987] At the time of beginningless time,
[8988] I lost the precious jewel.
[8989] At that time, wandering wrongly in suffering.
[8990] That precious jewel nectar,
[8991] Has no place to find by searching.
[8992] Self-arisen from self, realized by self.
[8993] That precious jewel nectar,
[8994] Not feeling loss, feeling finding.
[8995] By losing, things without characteristics;
[8996] Possessing joy's glow by finding.
[8997] Time of finding and time of losing,
[8998] Realized in one state without distinction.
[8999] Thus it is spoken.
[9000] Moreover, that losing in self-awareness's state, though finding from self's state,
[9001] From self-awareness's one wheel,
[9002] Does not enter elsewhere.
[9003] Losing jewel in king's treasury, doing suffering by jewel's absence.
[9004] Though joy-bliss expands by finding from treasury, both do not move from one treasury, like thus.
[9005] Samsara-nirvana two appearing from awareness's state is also thus.
[9006] This is the secret word of determining the self-essential-point of supreme wish-fulfillment, realizing vast Dharma-nature's expanse.
[9007] Second, demonstrating lamp-experience from that has three aspects:
[9008] Preliminary characteristics of place,
[9009] Actual lamp-pressing method,
[9010] From that, manner of appearance-arising.
[9011] First:
[9012] Abandoning all actions of this life,
[9013] Making the holy lama pleased,
[9014] Sitting with three immovables in a room decorated by darkness in a very secluded place,
[9015] Perfecting lama-yoga, meditating, placing request from heart.
[9016] From Thalgyur:
[9017] Lamp-pressing is thus:
[9018] By faithful one, mind-free from samsara,
[9019] Do lama-offering and giving,
[9020] Abandoning all samsara connections,
[9021] In secluded direction or charnel-ground,
[9022] One must abide alone, abandoning companions.
[9023] Thus it is spoken.
[9024] Second:
[9025] Placing on AH, and
[9026] Entering clearly, two:
[9027] First:
[9028] Sitting cross-legged, placing on red-clear clear round light-appearance by thumb-finger pressing, taking experience.
[9029] Making sessions short, number many,
[9030] Releasing thumb-finger effort, looking slowly,
[9031] Seeing appearance by pressing again is called Dharma-nature manifest appearance.
[9032] From that same source:
[9033] By one's own thumb and finger,
[9034] Press the bindu-empty lamp.
[9035] What arises from that pressing
[9036] Is Dharma-nature manifest appearance.
[9037] Thus it is spoken.
[9038] Entering clearly:
[9039] Then from five-light appearance, first like smoke,
[9040] Like dull illusion,
[9041] Like hovering clouds,
[9042] Like emanating fire sparks,
[9043] Sun and moon,
[9044] Like star forms,
[9045] Like intermediate-space rainbow,
[9046] White clear light,
[9047] Yellow clear,
[9048] Red clear,
[9049] Green clear,
[9050] Blue,
[9051] Various,
[9052] Net pattern,
[9053] Arising rays,
[9054] Round gatherings,
[9055] Bindus,
[9056] Stupas,
[9057] God-bodies,
[9058] At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here-there, far-near,
[9059] By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.
[9060] From Thalgyur:
[9061] From that, wisdom-expanding experience,
[9062] Also of color and shape,
[9063] Pervading all outer and inner clearly,
[9064] Certainly expanding from above to above.
[9065] At this time, body-speech bliss signs;
[9066] Join with appearance measure and manner.
[9067] Thus it is spoken.
[9068] Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:
[9069] From first red-yellow round,
[9070] Later appears as five-light rim.
[9071] Also from moving by wind's essential point,
[9072] Essential point of holding outward slowly.
[9073] Then by taking clear portion as experience,
[9074] Lamp like mirror,
[9075] Light like slice,
[9076] Expanding with body from bindu like bowl.
[9077] From that:
[9078] Thus pressing appearance:
[9079] First pure red,
[9080] Complete empowerment, round, complete self-clear.
[9081] From two pure fingers become three.
[9082] Then by pressing again and again,
[9083] The colors of five wisdoms—
[9084] White, red, green, blue, yellow—
[9085] Appear in field, effort.
[9086] Then also outer without effort,
[9087] Go-come by wind's portion,
[9088] From mirror-pure shape like,
[9089] Appear as portions of two and three.
[9090] From constant familiarity with that itself,
[9091] Also by five-color light,
[9092] Edge-cut appears from mere slice,
[9093] See measure from mere field-edge.
[9094] From finding familiarity measure from that,
[9095] With body to bindu center,
[9096] Abide while in pure half-body,
[9097] To that with five-five pairs,
[9098] Connect with very clear bindu,
[9099] Possessing father-mother body-appearance,
[9100] Pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing.
[9101] Thus it is spoken.
[9102] At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise.
[9103] Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and
[9104] Dharma-nature pure appearance, awareness, and
[9105] Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala,
[9106] Again conducting Dharma-nature cease-appearance.
[9107] From Thalgyur:
[9108] Wisdom-perfect appearance and
[9109] From Dharma-nature first appearance,
[9110] From three appearances perfecting, become ceasing.
[9111] Thus it is spoken, and:
[9112] At this time, body-speech-mind measures;
[9113] When seeing individual appearances,
[9114] Signs complete by ripening in self,
[9115] Ceasing measures all manifestly appear.
[9116] Thus it is spoken.
[9117] Thus by taking experience, supreme effort ones: three years;
[9118] Middle ones: five years;
[9119] Last ones: seven years, eleven months,
[9120] Six days: seeing Dharma-nature cease-appearance, liberating into light-body.
[9121] From that same source:
[9122] By great-small effort in this,
[9123] By days, months, years,
[9124] Certainly accomplish at individual times,
[9125] From times without much moving,
[9126] Reach individual measures.
[9127] Thus it is spoken.
[9128] This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking.
[9129] Third, determining the day-night wheel manner has four aspects:
[9130] Gathering sense-organs to essential point of continuum, closing memory's door;
[9131] Putting knowable objects in vase at dawn, wisdom clear directly;
[9132] At morning, demonstrating clear wisdom, all arisen feelings pure in self-place;
[9133] Striking with vast appearance by day,
[9134] Suppressing all signs.
[9135] Though these were explained formerly,
[9136] Here also explained as leap-over companion, summarizing: taking experience,
[9137] There is distinction slightly different from former.
[9138] Daytime, looking at manifest by elephant-gaze,
[9139] Releasing to self-ceasing delusion-appearances, suppressing signs.
[9140] Nighttime, placing cognition on bindu-empty lamp;
[9141] When that bindu expands, cognition also expands clear portion;
[9142] When decreasing, cognition goes increasingly subtle, in the state of going to referenceless end, equipoise without thought of emanating or gathering references.
[9143] As sleep approaches, placing mind in the state of dissolving empty bindu at the forehead center,
[9144] Seize the essence of sleep-luminosity.
[9145] At midnight, holding mind to the luminosity within the heart and sleeping,
[9146] Dreams liberate into luminosity, the continuum of habits ceasing.
[9147] Then at dawn, by lion's gaze casting consciousness to a white AH in the bow-span of sky,
[9148] The meaning free of clear-empty elaboration arises from within.
[9149] Meditate abiding in that state for as long as possible.
[9150] From Six Expanses:
[9151] Pressing the bodily posture,
[9152] Cast consciousness to the range of sky.
[9153] Likewise, eyes to the space between,
[9154] By elephant gaze
[9155] Place in great spreading without memory.
[9156] Thus cast awareness to sky.
[9157] Without separating from this,
[9158] The yogin who meditates continuously
[9159] Expands appearances by day.
[9160] At nighttime, in one's own dwelling,
[9161] To hold the measure of four equal times,
[9162] Gathering sense doors oneself,
[9163] To the lamp of empty bindu,
[9164] The endowed yogin places mind.
[9165] When that bindu expands,
[9166] Place consciousness expanding as well.
[9167] When bindu becomes subtle,
[9168] Bindu increasingly subtle,
[9169] Place consciousness increasingly subtle.
[9170] By essential point of sleep and dream,
[9171] Extract root of former attachment habits.
[9172] Thus in all times of night,
[9173] The fortunate endowed yogin acts.
[9174] By this, reach self-expansion of appearances.
[9175] Thus it is spoken.
[9176] Thus by taking experience in the day-night wheel continuum,
[9177] Delusory appearances self-cease, liberating into luminosity.
[9178] From that same source:
[9179] By body, field, and awareness,
[9180] Hold all measures of pure self-appearance.
[9181] Having grasped the measure of self-appearance thus,
[9182] Appearances of six classes' delusion cease.
[9183] At the time of ceasing that,
[9184] Awareness reaches the measure.
[9185] When thus reaching the measure,
[9186] One's own body also does not appear.
[9187] The flesh-blood body produced by elements
[9188] Because elements are pure in their own place,
[9189] Because this appears as field,
[9190] The mind-body grasped by delusion
[9191] Because elements dissolve in their own place,
[9192] This also dissolves, not appearing in its own place.
[9193] The light-body grasped by awareness
[9194] Is like the water-moon mandala.
[9195] At this time, near Dharma-nature cessation,
[9196] Whoever becomes familiar with this, Buddha-field.
[9197] Then, having exhausted the three bodies' limits,
[9198] Obtain the action-free perfect body.
[9199] At this time, all limits of body
[9200] Are near to freedom.
[9201] The yogin familiar with the base
[9202] Also empties one's own place.
[9203] The yogin familiar with the path
[9204] Exhausts coarse elemental stains.
[9205] Whoever is familiar with the fruit
[9206] Reaches the non-return ground by this.
[9207] Thus it is spoken.
[9208] Moreover, the distinction between light-body and samadhi-body: the light-body, awareness's self-light without stain, is beyond the range of sentient beings' sight, visible only to Buddha-eye,
[9209] The samadhi god-body should be understood as having the distinction of appearing to those with god-eye among sentient beings possessing very clear, pervasive particles of the four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum.
[9210] Third, extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse has three aspects:
[9211] Briefly demonstrating the essence,
[9212] Extensively explaining the nature,
[9213] Summarizing the meaning by aspect.
[9214] First:
[9215] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[9216] Also, what are the five intentions?
[9217] By intention of mountain's general meaning, transcend through view.
[9218] By intention of wisdom's general filling, grasp the ground.
[9219] By intention of bindu's range-penetration, examine the manner of appearance arising.
[9220] By intention of sun-moon equal gap, deliver to meaning's end.
[9221] By intention of ocean expanse-penetration, deliver awareness to space. Thus it is spoken.
[9222] Second, from five:
[9223] First, the essence of mountain's general meaning intention is awareness of great perfect nature, luminosity without transfer or change, space and wisdom non-dual.
[9224] When realizing that by sense-power,
[9225] When space-awareness appears as field, view, intention, conduct, and fruit arise as four-fours for best, middle, and last three sense-powers of the person, thus twelve portions.
[9226] From Power-Perfect:
[9227] At the time when mountain's general meaning intention arises,
[9228] Reach the end of great perfect view.
[9229] For best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three views arise.
[9230] For best sense-power, the view of wisdom-appearance spontaneously arising
[9231] Is realizing awareness of self's wisdom without realization together with body.
[9232] At that time, intention is unmoving in clarity, like planets and stars arising on the ocean.
[9233] Conduct is ceaseless power-arising conduct, like casting sky-spear.
[9234] Fruit is seeing appearance of birthless self-arising.
[9235] The view of middle sense-power
[9236] Realizes only self's awareness without birth.
[9237] Intention is free from concept portions, like flags attaching to ocean.
[9238] Conduct is unblocked spontaneous, like mad-one.
[9239] Conduct without obstruction in any appearance.
[9240] Fruit:
[9241] Endowed with intention of self-place, conquering signs.
[9242] The view of last sense-power realizes this very appearance as like illusion or emanation.
[9243] Intention: demonstrating essence of self-appearance, understanding wisdom arising in the intermediate, like lion-chick free from womb-egg.
[9244] See interior wisdom obscured.
[9245] Conduct:
[9246] Endowed with conduct grasping samsara-nirvana two.
[9247] Fruit:
[9248] Having abandoned body, breath reaches nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[9249] Second, the essence of wisdom's general filling intention:
[9250] Realizing awareness's power-empowerment perfected from the beginning.
[9251] Different manners of realizing by three sense-powers:
[9252] From that same source:
[9253] At the time when wisdom's general filling intention arises,
[9254] Also, by best, middle, and last three sense-powers of the person, three view manners arise.
[9255] Best sense-power realizes only by demonstrating birthless fruit as self-nature through empowerment.
[9256] Intention:
[9257] Through wisdom practice, spreading to bindu, unmoving from sky-equal great bliss intention.
[9258] Conduct:
[9259] Conduct without pure-impure in white-red awakening mind.
[9260] Fruit:
[9261] Seeing suchness of Buddha-family ground.
[9262] The view of middle sense-power
[9263] Realizes only appearance becoming awareness's power.
[9264] Intention:
[9265] Abides undistracted in clarity, like sun-moon pair relating.
[9266] Conduct:
[9267] Conducting in true Dharma-nature yogin manner.
[9268] Fruit:
[9269] Obtaining birth-deathless suchness.
[9270] The view of last sense-power
[9271] Realizes empowerment qualities all expanding and arising.
[9272] Intention:
[9273] Meditating relying on god-body with signs.
[9274] Conduct:
[9275] Conducting in Dharma-nature's display.
[9276] Fruit:
[9277] Obtaining Buddha through the gate of qualities. Thus it is spoken.
[9278] Third, the essence of bindu range-penetration intention:
[9279] Buddha-hood through penetrating self-appearance's range by self-arising awareness wisdom of the intermediate, self-realizing.
[9280] Different by distinction of person's sense-power.
[9281] From that:
[9282] At the time when bindu range-penetration intention arises,
[9283] Also, for best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three view-signs arise.
[9284] The view of best sense-power:
[9285] Like a meteor moving in the sky,
[9286] Arising as wisdom-power quality,
[9287] Realizes liberation in three moments.
[9288] Intention:
[9289] Abides pervasive to all open clarity, like sun arising in space-between.
[9290] Conduct:

[9300] Conduct:
[9301] Conducts non-dual with self-heart's light-ray.
[9302] Fruit:
[9303] Seeing self-awareness's appearance as birthless Dharma-body.
[9304] The view of last sense-power:
[9305] In pure wisdom appearance,
[9306] Did I arise from that,
[9307] Or did that arise from me—realizes thus thinking.
[9308] Intention:
[9309] Abides without seeing agent in that very appearance.
[9310] Conduct:
[9311] Endowed with doubt and indecision conduct.
[9312] Fruit:
[9313] Obtaining fruit of breathing into nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[9314] Fourth, the essence of sun-moon equal gap intention:
[9315] Realizing appearance-emptiness as equality without ceasing.
[9316] Separated individually by sense-power.
[9317] From Power-Perfect:
[9318] At the time when sun-moon equal gap intention penetrates expanse,
[9319] For best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three view-signs arise.
[9320] The view of best sense-power:
[9321] Realizes wisdom as open.

[9329] Intention: abides in manner like sun-moon arising in space-between, nature of method and wisdom.
[9330] Conduct: conducts to white-red secret bindu of great bliss.
[9331] Fruit:
[9332] Obtaining fruit of Buddha-hood in womb of five Buddha-families' practice.
[9333] Three view-signs of last sense-power:
[9334] Realizes view indicating awakening mind seed by father-mother practice.
[9335] Intention:
[9336] Abides in clear samadhi manner, remembering god's nature heart-essence.
[9337] Conduct:
[9338] Conducts to five medicines, five nectars.
[9339] Fruit:
[9340] Seizing tutelary deity's illusory body in intermediate,
[9341] Obtaining fruit of pure appearance. Thus it is spoken.
[9342] Fifth, the essence of ocean expanse-penetration intention:
[9343] Abiding in force-samadhi of nature as Dharma-nature equal-clear state.
[9344] Separated by individual sense-power.
[9345] From Power-Perfect:
[9346] At the time of ocean expanse-penetration intention,
[9347] Also, three view-signs arise for three sense-powers.
[9348] The view of best sense-power:
[9349] Realizes whatever appears by great wisdom's activity as self-appearance itself.
[9350] Intention:
[9351] Like being intoxicated by alcohol with small attachment to appearance.
[9352] Conduct:

[9366] Intention:
[9367] Abiding in god and human mind-holding.
[9368] Conduct:
[9369] Endowed with fabricated two-grasping conduct.
[9370] Fruit:
[9371] Obtaining god and human status. Thus it is spoken.
[9372] Third, summarizing meaning by aspect:
[9373] These five intentions bind all secret heart-essence yogins.
[9374] Arising of yogin's experience:
[9375] By mountain general meaning, transcending view of great perfection without high-low, slack-tight equality.
[9376] By wisdom's general filling, grasp ground as self-abiding Dharma-nature in that manner.
[9377] By bindu range-penetration, examine awareness's liberation manner from space-appearance.
[9378] By sun-moon equal gap, deliver intention to Dharma-ceasing expanse.
[9379] By ocean expanse-penetration, stably hold ground at primordially pure ground of space-awareness.
[9380] Also, first: like lion's play conquering fear of delusory appearance destruction, washed high by view.
[9381] Second: like king-awareness empowerment obtaining self-power Dharma-nature.
[9382] Third: like peacock chick emerging from egg, reaching pure space.
[9383] Fourth: like equal sun-moon without two, expanding greatly all-equal vastness.
[9384] Fifth: establishing supreme secret bindu meaning gathered in intention like sun arising from mountain neck, self-appearance clear as wisdom.
[9385] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[9386] The intention of mountain's general meaning
[9387] Is like lion's play.
[9388] The intention of wisdom's general filling
[9389] Is like empowerment from king's head.
[9390] The intention of bindu's range-penetration is like peacock chick emerging from egg.
[9391] The intention of sun-moon equal gap is like entering equality without sun and moon two.
[9392] The intention of ocean's expanse-penetration
[9393] Is like sun arising from mountain's neck. Thus it is spoken.
[9394] Thus, dividing each of the five aspirations into three sense-powers makes fifteen; dividing each of these into view, intention, conduct, and fruit fours makes sixty Dharma enumerations—purifying sixty enumerations of eon's increase-decrease, sentient beings' affliction, and view.
[9395] Demonstrated as pure complete nature of wisdom experience, spoken by Vajra-Holder.
