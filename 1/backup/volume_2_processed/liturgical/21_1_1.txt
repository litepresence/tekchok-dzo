[11994] Thus having shown the sequence of signs, the method of liberation in this life for those of excellent faculties, effort, and places of the general instruction,
[11995] Now, for establishing extensively the Dharma arrangement of completely perfect buddhahood in the bardo for those of medium faculties, there are two:
[11996] The general establishment of the intermediate state and
[11997] The extensive explanation of individual natures.
[11998] First, regarding the essence of the intermediate state:
[11999] Definition,
[12000] Division,
[12001] Appearance pattern,
[12002] And ground boundary—five aspects.
[12003] First, the essence:
[12004] The situation of outer objects and inner mind appearing as dharmas.
[12005] Furthermore, all appearances other than inner space of primordial purity are the situation of the intermediate state.
[12006] The aspect of appearance of the face of self-arising activity through the two form bodies from the self-radiance of ground-appearance appearing as body and wisdom is the pure intermediate state of dharmatā,
[12007] While all impure dharmas of deluded appearance of the six realms are the intermediate state of delusion.
[12008] Between which of these two dharmas of pure and impure does it exist?
[12009] Since from the space of primordial purity it must dissolve back into primordial purity through outward movement, it exists in the interval of primordially pure nature.
[12010] First, that also arises from that.
[12011] The first also arises from that, the last also must be delivered to that nature's state. In the space of primordial purity there is no intermediate state; that self does not depend on other dharmas before or after, nor is entry into anyone's interval possible, for it transcends the limits of transfer-change and appearance-emptiness.
[12012] From the Thal-logical Result:
[12013] In the primordial purity of the beginning,
[12014] The ground of confusion cannot be expressed;
[12015] Likewise, what of the unconfused?
[12016] This point too, if wisdom exists, is of great import.
[12017] Second, the etymology: "intermediate" (bar) is expressed from the aspect of being the center dharma of any upper, lower, before, or after—like the intermediate state of dream existing between going toward sleep and waking. "Ma" indicates center. "Do" (two) dwells in the center like a connecting rope joining beginning and end—the connecting rope of the center of two.
[12018] Third, divisions: from common and uncommon. From some common vehicles, birth-death intermediate state, dream intermediate state, dharmata intermediate state, existence intermediate state, and so forth are desired. In this uncommon vehicle, the secret king, four are regarded: nature intermediate state, death-time intermediate state, dharmata intermediate state, and existence intermediate state.
[12019] From the Thal-logical Result:
[12020] Such is the dharmata of intermediate state,
[12021] The greatly secret dharmata explained;
[12022] Divided, from four aspects—thus.
[12023] Fourth, appearance-pattern: from two. First, as shown generally: appearance in the general aspect of the three realms is desired as the manifestation of grasping-grasped, attachment-aversion, and afflictions; the subtle, form, and formless.
[12024] Appearance in each of the six realms individually: in one cause-water, by gods as nectar, etc. From the Two Truths:
[12025] Mind alone differentiates things,
[12026] Thus sees objects as unestablished.
[12027] For an individual in the category of doors, to one donor many enemies and friends appear.
[12028] 
[12029] 
[12030] 
[12031] 
[12032] 
[12033] 
[12034] 
[12035] 
[12036] 
[12037] 
[12038] 
[12039] 
[12040] 
[12041] 
[12042] 
[12043] 
[12044] 
[12045] 
[12046] 
[12047] 
[12048] 
[12049] 
[12050] 
[12051] 
[12052] 
[12053] 
[12054] 
[12055] Ground-boundary of nature-remaining intermediate state.
[12056] Death-time intermediate state.
[12057] Dharmatā intermediate state.
[12058] Existence intermediate state.
[12059] First, ground-boundary of nature-remaining:
[12060] The nature remaining as the ground of all,
[12061] Primordially pure, spontaneously present.
[12062] Thus the ground-boundary of nature-remaining.
[12063] Second, death-time intermediate state:
[12064] From the moment of death until the clear light,
[12065] The dissolution of elements and consciousness.
[12066] Thus the death-time intermediate state.
[12067] Third, dharmatā intermediate state:
[12068] The clear light of dharmatā dawning,
[12069] Recognition brings liberation.
[12070] Thus the dharmatā intermediate state.
[12071] Fourth, existence intermediate state:
[12072] From the dharmatā clear light until conception,
[12073] The wandering in the bardo of becoming.
[12074] Thus the existence intermediate state.
[12075] Herein, the duration:
[12076] The death-time lasts until the clear light.
[12077] The dharmatā lasts a maximum of four days.
[12078] The existence lasts a maximum of forty-nine days.
[12079] Thus the duration of intermediate states.
[12080] Herein, the appearances:
[12081] In death-time: dissolution of elements.  [12028] In dharmatā: clear light dawning.  [12029] In existence: karmic visions arising.  [12030] Thus the appearances.  [12031] Herein, the liberation:  [12032] In death-time: through recognition of dissolution.  [12033] In dharmatā: through recognition of clear light.  [12034] In existence: through recognition of illusory nature.  [12035] Thus liberation in intermediate states.  [12036] Herein, the preparation:  [12037] Through hearing, contemplating, and meditating,  [12038] Recognition is prepared for death and bardo.  [12039] Thus the preparation.  [12040] Herein, the importance:  [12041] Without preparation, wandering continues.  [12042] With preparation, liberation is certain.  [12043] Thus the importance of preparation.  [12044] Thus the four intermediate states are explained.  [12045] Thus the instructions on intermediate states are complete.
[12082] By meaning, separating inanimate from consciousness, remaining in death-fearing suffering.
[12083] The appearance of the dharmata intermediate state: abandoning the support of aggregate self-grasping, body and wisdom's dharmata appears manifest; karma and latent-tendency's connection cut, enjoying the dharmata of nature-meditation; faculty grasp-doer's object empty, exercising in the dharmata of self-appearance clear-light.
[12084] The appearance of the existence intermediate state: outer body's existence as mind-body with all faculties complete goes unobstructed; inner mind's existence thinking in many think-doers, mind enters; body and mind's gathered existence goes unobstructed in all except the two supports, mind loose.
[12085] The two supports: the vajra seat accomplished from blessing, and the mother's womb.
[12086] Therein, most masters identify the vajra seat as that in India, but here it is desired as that in which all buddhas abide in the door of liberation from suffering in the supreme place of buddhahood in the inner space of primordially-pure unchangeable. The mother's womb is desired as the impure door of samsara in any of the six realms' birth-places; know that this is not the literal meaning.
[12087] Generally, sutra places have two: provisional meaning and definitive meaning; intention and indirect intention—bound by four manners. Tantra section places have two on top of that: literal and not literal—know these bound by six limits.
[12088] These too from the Thal-logical Result:
[12089] Intermediate state's appearance:
[12090] Nature-remaining aggregates and
[12091] Elements and afflictions appear as objects,
[12092] Death-time's mist-gloom rising,
[12093] Consciousness not remaining as one.
[12094] Dharmata intermediate state: body and
[12095] Wisdom, light and color,
[12096] Drops expanding and elements appearing,
[12097] Whatever appears: dharmata's measured palace.
[12098] Existence's appearance flickering,
[12099] Flashing like dream appearance,
[12100] True-appearance false, mind's object,
[12101] White-mist etc., six races' light,
[12102] Each individual's focused object appears—thus.
[12103] Fifth, ground-boundary: from four.
[12104] 
[12105] 
[12106] 
[12107] 
[12108] 
[12109] 
[12110] 
[12111] 
[12112] 
[12113] 
[12114] 
[12115] 
[12116] 
[12117] 
[12118] 
[12119] 
[12120] 
[12121] The ground boundary of the intermediate state of remaining in nature is from exiting the mother's womb until struck by the disease of the final death condition.
[12122] From there until breath is cut by gasping is the death-time intermediate state.
[12123] From inner breath being cut, clear light arises; the interval of spontaneously accomplished appearance is the dharmatā intermediate state.
[12124] From there, spontaneously accomplished dissolves, appearing like flashing dreams until entering the mother's womb is the ground boundary of the existence intermediate state.
[12125] These introductions shown at the final time of death are called the instruction of giving a robe-shake to the traveler crossing.
[12126] That traveler has entered the path of death.
[12127] The suffering of death is great,
[12128] And if the various path appearances are not known as own-appearance, there is danger of arising as enemies.
[12129] If known, there is danger of appearing as helpers.
[12130] To hit that shake at death,
[12131] Is called the instruction of hitting with robe-shake; the example and meaning fit.
[12132] These are the general establishment of the intermediate state.
[12133] There is need to divide in half for ease.
[12134] Second, regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are four:
[12135] For the intermediate state of nature, the tone-instruction like entering a box with rope cut, deciding the class of knowables,
[12136] For the death-time intermediate state, the instruction like looking in a beautiful woman's mirror, giving clarity to what is unclear,
[12137] For the dharmatā intermediate state, the instruction like meeting a familiar person or a child entering the mother's lap through confidence in own-appearance,
[12138] For the existence intermediate state, the instruction like inserting a fox into a broken fox hole through the continuity of karma.
[12139] First:
[12140] Before doing the entering-box, examine whether caught or not caught by the enemy of harm; without harm, with the box ready, whenever entering that box later, no need to cut superimpositions, without doubt,
[12141] And without obstruction or attachment, entering like that yogin, first desiring liberation from saṃsāra, examining which method is profound and which point is great, abandoning three—deciding the limit of that Dharma of self-confidence, entering with doubt, and not arriving at the beginning.
[12142] First, cultivate the mind through hearing.
[12143] In the middle, decide through contemplation.
[12144] Finally, repeating with meditation, making the mind at ease is like approaching the box.
[12145] Like entering the box, settling meanings, entering at death without danger or fear.
[12146] The meanings of these were extensively shown before.
[12147] Here, explaining slightly in condensed practice:
[12148] Looking at outer appearance, seeing the appearing object like an illusory confusion mandala,
[12149] When seeing only the self-form of groundless emptiness,
[12150] All dharmas appearing variously as the mirror of view, meditation, and conduct have arisen from the beginning.
[12151] For it is the self-power of dharmatā's ceaseless play arising.
[12152] Also, looking at the various white and red appearing like eating under a garment house,
[12153] When seeing whatever appears, whatever arises, whatever is heard, all as the play of self-dissolved emptiness, without hand to correct or discard the blockage of appearance,
[12154] Appearance liberates from the ground of appearance, confusion liberates as groundless, arising only as the peak of illusion, liberated from saṃsāra of grasping outer objects.
[12155] The dharmas—pieces of mountains, excellent-born women, etc.—whatever first arises as appearing object, cut in pieces, put greatly wherever it appears,
[12156] Without entering the great consciousness as investigator,
[12157] Appearance is not changed by mind.
[12158] Mind is not seized by appearance; dissolve in self-place.
[12159] Without preventing the six consciousness groups, putting in self-place, dharmatā appearance arises spontaneously.
[12160] Thus looking at outer dharmas, when knowing as the self-form of objectless emptiness, grasping is pure like objectless space.
[12161] This is called realizing grasping as without nature.
[12162] Thus looking at the consciousness of the outer looker,
[12163] Moving dissolves in emptiness without outline,
[12164] When realizing as self-clear without sudden dissolving,
[12165] Realizing inner dharmatā as great without birth, cessation, or ground,
[12166] Grasping spreads as self-dissolved in the nature of supportless sky-like state.
[12167] In supportless ye re.
[12168] Remaining in direct penetration,
[12169] Pervading without truth,
[12170] Fixed without root.
[12171] In the nature of the great equalness of dharmatā, smiling ge, put with joy.
[12172] There is need for the twist-nail of grasping mind to come out.
[12173] Thus when realizing object and mind as groundless and root-free,
[12174] The secret self-awareness of grasping-grasped, free from elaboration, goes to remaining.
[12175] When meditating in the nature of clear light without gathering or separating space-awareness through the four lamps of introduction by the master's word to the great self-clear primordial purity,
[12176] The five lights of outer space-appearance self-radiance are clear like form-reflections inside a mirror.
[12177] Though aspects appear outer, essence remains inner.
[12178] Knowing appearance-emptiness like water-moon form-reflections,
[12179] Do not do grasping attachment of joy-play in appearance.
[12180] Looking far in the clear light of outer appearance,
[12181] Inner awareness clear light clears near.
[12182] Awareness, free from meditation mind and antidote, wide view of pure vast nature,
[12183] Clear meditation of self-descended nature-remaining,
[12184] Without accepting or rejecting in clear light conduct,
[12185] Through obtaining the fruit of primordially pure self-clear,
[12186] Abandon delusion appearance without abandoning,
[12187] Block delusion thought without preventing,
[12188] Pure without training dual-grasping,
[12189] Pure from the beginning without abandoning faults,
[12190] Spontaneously accomplished qualities without seeking.
[12191] The meaning of complete liberation of the three realms,
[12192] Transcending the object of view,
[12193] Transcending the mind of meditation,
[12194] Transcending the calculation of conduct,
[12195] Transcending the Dharma of result,
[12196] In the fortune of emptying saṃsāra,
[12197] The field of dharmatā manifest appearance is spacious.
[12198] In the good circle of the land of the source of bliss,
[12199] Having obtained the self-arisen palace according to desire,
[12200] With the first lord, the King of Unchanging Light,
[12201] And the five-light spontaneously accomplished queen gathered,
[12202] The supreme inconceivable holy child-appearance meets his own father and mother.
[12203] It is called the time of obtaining the eternal establishment of inseparable joy-bliss.
[12204] The extensive scripture of these was shown before.
[12205] Doing certainty by clear situation, from Sun-Moon Union:
[12206] Exclamation! Conqueror, you listen:
[12207] By condensing all those,
[12208] The drop remaining as one is obtained.
[12209] And what and what are they?
[12210] By putting, self-spread is obtained;
[12211] By intentions, time is shown;
[12212] By exhaust-patterns, intention is shown;
[12213] By stable confidence, the not-turning sign.
[12214] Thus meanings are condensed.
[12215] These are that result:
[12216] Who sees the space-lamp
[12217] Manifestly exercises in dharma-space;
[12218] Who sees the drop-lamp
[12219] Obtains the hope-base of those with effort;
[12220] Who sees the wisdom-lamp
[12221] Realizes general and self-characteristic;
[12222] Who sees the water-lamp
[12223] Obtains power over faculties;
[12224] Who is habituated in lu-gu-rgyud,
[12225] Awarenesses obtain balance.
[12226] By that result of three bodies,
[12227] All these are self-awareness ground.
[12228] In the intermediate state of nature-remaining,
[12229] The birth-being habituated to these,
[12230] All elements as self-vanish,
[12231] Become in this without doubt.
[12232] These dharmas I proclaimed,
[12233] All sutras and tantras here condensed—thus extensively said.
[12234] Second, the eightfold instruction like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror for giving clarity to unclear in the death-time intermediate state: thinking the cause of certain death with many examples, examining death's signs, showing reversal methods, showing death-time appearance, showing giving instruction, showing birth-place signs, showing purifying rites, showing other uncommon places.
[12235] First has three: training in dharma without opportunity for leisure-freedom by thinking on the difficult-to-obtain manner; showing the rite of training; producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on continuous cause of certain decay; meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death.
[12236] 
[12237] 
[12238] 
[12239] 
[12240] 
[12241] 
[12242] 
[12243] 
[12244] 
[12245] 
[12246] 
[12247] 
[12248] 
[12249] 
[12250] 
[12251] Difficult to be born: born in the place of dharma exercise from karma-ground of Jambu-continent. Difficult to obtain: obtaining leisure with endowments. Difficult to meet: meeting master virtuous friend. Difficult to enter: entering the door of holy dharma jewel. Difficult to know: knowing unsurpassed instruction exactly not wrong. Difficult to abandon: abandoning samsara's suffering ocean, the time to go to liberation's buddha-continent—now if not accomplished producing effort and courage, later such favorable conditions complete are not possible. Therefore appropriate to meditate day and night in profound meaning without opportunity for leisure-freedom.
[12252] From the presence of Arya Nagarjuna:
[12253] Remaining in favorable land,
[12254] Relying on holy birth-beings,
[12255] Virtue arisen from before-training good prayers by self,
[12256] You possess the four great wheels—thus.
[12257] From the presence of Arya Shantideva:
[12258] This leisure endowment is greatly difficult to obtain;
[12259] For the birth-being who has obtained purpose accomplishment,
[12260] If effort is not made in this,
[12261] Where will proper obtainment be later?
[12262] Having obtained such leisure,
[12263] If effort is not made now,
[12264] Go to negative path as corpse of the dead;
[12265] In billions of hundred-thousand kalpas,
[12266] Not even hearing the sound of happy path,
[12267] What need to mention obtaining happy path?—thus said.
[12268] That too: all this present pleasure-pain and appearance become from before karma; later appearance is produced by present karma. Those who did evil karma before ripen here as incomplete faculties, crooked limbs, etc., ugly forms, poor, become under others' power. Those who gathered good karma before, here clear faculties, beautiful forms, pleasing to the mind when seen.
[12269] 
[12270] 
[12271] 
[12272] 
[12273] 
[12274] 
[12275] 
[12276] 
[12277] 
[12278] 
[12279] 
[12280] 
[12281] 
[12282] 
[12283] 
[12284] Possessing retinue, enjoyment, prosperity.
[12285] Where to be born depends on present thought-conduct.
[12286] Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation.
[12287] First, possessing retinue:
[12288] When possessing a retinue of disciples,
[12289] One has gathered the accumulations and benefits beings.
[12290] Thus possessing retinue.
[12291] Second, enjoyment:
[12292] The enjoyment of Dharma, the supreme bliss,
[12293] Not worldly pleasure, but the joy of liberation.
[12294] Thus enjoyment.
[12295] Third, prosperity:
[12296] The prosperity of virtue and wisdom,
[12297] The wealth of the seven noble riches.
[12298] Thus prosperity.
[12299] Fourth, where to be born depends on present thought-conduct:
[12300] The realm of rebirth is determined by present mind and action,
[12301] Virtuous conduct leads to higher realms,
[12302] Non-virtuous conduct leads to lower realms.
[12303] Thus where to be born depends on thought-conduct.
[12304] Fifth, Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation:
[12305] As stated in the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement:
[12306] "Through virtuous thought and conduct,  [12524] One attains the higher realms and liberation.  [12525] Through non-virtuous thought and conduct,  [12526] One falls into the lower realms of suffering."  [12527] Thus the quotation.  [12528] Herein, the importance of thought:  [12529] Thought is the forerunner of all actions,  [12530] Pure thought leads to pure results.  [12531] Thus the importance of thought.  [12532] Herein, the importance of conduct:  [12533] Conduct manifests thought in action,  [12534] Virtuous conduct purifies the mind.  [12535] Thus the importance of conduct.  [12536] Herein, the result:  [12537] Through pure thought and conduct,  [12538] One attains the higher realms and liberation.  [12539] Thus the result.  [12540] Herein, the summary:  [12541] Retinue, enjoyment, and prosperity arise from virtue.  [12542] Rebirth depends on present thought and conduct.  [12543] Thus the summary.  [12544] Thus possessing retinue, enjoyment, and prosperity is explained.  [12545] Thus the dependence of rebirth on thought-conduct is established.  [12546] Thus the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation is complete.
[12307] For dharma alone benefits; other than dharma, nothing reaches benefit. From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:
[12308] Here father, mother, relatives,
[12309] Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;
[12310] Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.
[12311] Except these quality-possessors,
[12312] No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.
[12313] From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:
[12314] As time's danger, king becoming to go,
[12315] Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;
[12316] Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,
[12317] Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.
[12318] Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay: having obtained such difficult leisure, yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded, like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation dharma.
[12319] Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion? From the Ratnagotra Tantra:
[12320] In coarse element forms,
[12321] Alas, no ground to sit;
[12322] To birth-being's stable life breath,
[12323] Alas, time does not strike;
[12324] In group six's object appearance,
[12325] Alas, nothing permanent;
[12326] In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,
[12327] Alas, nothing exhausts;
[12328] In suffering arisen from body,
[12329] Alas, nothing pure—thus.
[12330] Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused. Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others, enemies conquered, lands obtained—yet doing whatever, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.
[12331] 
[12332] 
[12333] 
[12334] 
[12335] 
[12336] 
[12337] 
[12338] 
[12339] 
[12340] 
[12341] 
[12342] 
[12343] 
[12344] 
[12345] From the presence of Glorious Atisha:
[12346] Exclamation! Looking far at world's conducts,
[12347] All doing is purposeless, cause of suffering;
[12348] Whatever is thought, benefit not reached—
[12349] Habituate looking at self's mind,
[12350] Like thus requested.
[12351] Third, instruction for meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death: generally, impermanent compounded dharmas resemble dream, illusion, etc. From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:
[12352] Exclamation! Compounded things are impermanent,
[12353] Characteristics of dharmas of arising and perishing;
[12354] Than becoming to perish after birth,
[12355] Therefore quick peace is bliss.
[12356] Like star, dust, eye-disease, lamp,
[12357] Magical-illusion, dew, water-bubble,
[12358] Dream, lightning, cloud—
[12359] Compounded dharmas resemble that—thus.
[12360] Especially, example of birth-being's impermanent life from the Great Secret Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[12361] Whatever body-possessing birth-beings,
[12362] Life is impermanent like dream,
[12363] By dream establishment not exists;
[12364] Life impermanent like rushing-water,
[12365] By falling-water not exist sitting as one;
[12366] Life like grasp-not wind,
[12367] By wind birth-being seize not;
[12368] Life like short-duration emanation,
[12369] By emanation always remain not;
[12370] Life like true-not magical-illusion,
[12371] By magical-illusion true ground seize not;
[12372] Life like not-staying traveler,
[12373] By traveler always sit not;
[12374] Life like not-certain rain-cloud,
[12375] By cloud time seize not.
[12376] Thus birth-being's life extent
[12377] Is thus not certain as one,
[12378] Sudden and thunder-fall,
[12379] Time thus not seized.
[12380] From the Extensive Play Sutra:
[12381] Life impermanent like play's cloud,
[12382] Like mountain-cascade falling-water goes quick fast—thus.
[12383] From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:
[12384] Some remain in womb then die,
[12385] Likewise some after birth...
[12386] 
[12387] 
[12388] 
[12389] 
[12390] 
[12391] 
[12392] Some at only stopping cough, likewise some completely running, some old and some young, some dying after descending into youth—in that, thus "this human is young," what pride-confidence of the alive?
[12393] Thus thinking certain quick death by impermanence: this life's activity—attachment-aversion, fight-quarrel, laziness, hoard-store, great year-wish difference, faction side-grasp, enemy-friend subdue-protect, hearing yet word-explain not fitting meaning, and all friends—what benefit? Thus must think from heart. To do speech:
[12394] Life duration short, knowable forms many;
[12395] Life's extent also not known how much;
[12396] Like goose taking milk from water,
[12397] Do accept self's desire.
[12398] Thus: from today, need effort in profound dharma. That too, also looking at outer object's appearance, continuous impermanent by sun-moon-time-four change; moment impermanent by day-night moment change; nature impermanent by thinking birth-death sequence-row; thinking on gathered-yet-separate like shop traveler; quickly die, certainly die, when die opportunity not exist, thus thinking dharma-not-by benefit not exist.
[12399] Inner self's illusion-body youth, mind's arise-door, pleasure-pain sequence-rows changing before-after, thus also thinking impermanent, not-stable, changing, transferring, as not having example of returning after death. Thinking death only without being distracted moment-instant.
[12400] From Conduct Entrance:
[12401] Day and night all in, by self,
[12402] Appropriate to think this only—thus.
[12403] That too, meditating samadhi in interval of mind not turned from this life, and though putting other dharma exercise of doing, need to think this only from heart, for no dharma more profound than this for turning mind from samsara.
[12404] From the presence of Master Great Padma also...
[12405] 
[12406] 
[12407] 
[12408] 
[12409] 
[12410] 
[12411] 
[12412] 
[12413] 
[12414] 
[12415] 
[12416] 
[12417] 
[12418] 
[12419] 
[12420] 
[12421] 
[12422] 
[12423] 
[12424] 
[12425] 
[12426] 
[12427] 
[12428] 
[12429] 
[12430] 
[12431] 
[12432] 
[12433] 
[12434] 
[12435] Give urge by death impermanent without distraction; day and night divided in sessions, always do meditation—like thus said.
[12436] Therefore, though thinking long in existence attachment-decay, life impermanent; though thinking in near moment-instant, life impermanent. Faculty and object impermanent, situation changes; retainer and wealth substance impermanent, now exist yet now not exist; father, mother, relative impermanent, not exist after passing; land person and neighbor impermanent, many separations; sun, moon, old, young impermanent, appearance changes; pleasure-pain and enemy friend impermanent, like traveler-house.
[12437] In short, all birth-beings put pillow in birth-death, wear pleasure-pain garment, spread grasping-grasped seat, take ignorance bed, sleep self-grasping sleep, dream latent-tendency dream. All goers exercising in five poisons' self-nature in three realms' samsara house, also sleeping and arising, in sleep and dream without beginning-end and wake time—think this.
[12438] Now from samsara's darkness-house, need to bring out effort in liberation's method.
[12439] Samsara-pa become by power of karma and affliction,
[12440] Though impermanent manifests, grasp as true;
[12441] Though fallen in birth-death's water-fall, liberation not known;
[12442] Though experience various sufferings, no time to forget;
[12443] True friend separate, no protector showing path,
[12444] Dharma's eye closed, wandering in ignorance darkness.
[12445] Thinking these, in difficult-to-obtain leisure,
[12446] Appropriate to produce joy-mind or accomplish dharma;
[12447] Supreme become guide showing true path,
[12448] Having met mark-possessing masters,
[12449] At this time obtaining profound dharma supreme nectar,
[12450] By effort accomplish, crossing supreme other-side of existence-three ocean.
[12451] Life impermanent like setting-mountain's shadow,
[12452] Like precipice-edge tree moved by wind,
[12453] Like cloud and lightning, grass-tip dew,
[12454] Think to die quickly as self.
[12455] If now "die" not remembered from heart,
[12456] Benefit not reached at die-time by laziness-distraction;
[12457] Therefore now like falling to beginning,
[12458] Train in essence-meaning by fear-terror.
[12459] From now, self also in flower forest,
[12460] Empty by birth-beings, hearing falling-water's sound,
[12461] Dwelling near solitary, mind-pleasing cliff-mountain,
[12462] Mind of "not existent essence in four times" virtue,
[12463] Cultivated by world person as ornament-cause,
[12464] Having obtained supreme nectar than all,
[12465] May proclaim great sound of impermanent empty!
[12466] 
[12467] 
[12468] 
[12469] 
[12470] 
[12471] 
[12472] 
[12473] 
[12474] 
[12475] 
[12476] 
[12477] 
[12478] 
[12479] 
[12480] 
[12481] 
[12482] There in beautiful medicine tree flower grove,
[12483] Possessing cloud canopy of peaceful dharma manner,
[12484] By flickering gold light of awareness-holder conqueror,
[12485] May one life's clear-light essence be accomplished!
[12486] From liberation's mansion jewel palace,
[12487] By resounding tone of peaceful dharma manner drum sound,
[12488] All goers not remaining wake from ignorance sleep,
[12489] May manifestly buddha in original ground!
[12490] The clear-natured one with weariness-mind,
[12491] Desiring to go one-along to peaceful forest,
[12492] Speaking tone of wished words from heart:
[12493] May quickly accomplish by pure faith virtue!
[12494] Thus called are interval verses.
[12495] Second, examining death's signs from the Thal-logical Result:
[12496] Death's signs also twenty-one;
[12497] Gone to solitary charnel-ground direction,
[12498] Do worship and give to master;
[12499] Also by eating and drinking,
[12500] Do please other goers;
[12501] From that, also examine outer, inner, secret death signs—thus said.
[12502] All ordinary not knowing when die,
[12503] Transcended in distinction from world outsiders examining by divination, pra, etc.;
[12504] Yogin's seizing time certainly:
[12505] Gone to person-not-exist valley empty, retreat, charnel-ground, forest-retreat, mountain valley, etc., doing life form examination, etc.
[12506] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12507] At the time of death-lord demon rising,
[12508] Thus examine death-time intermediate state;
[12509] In solitary place or valley empty,
[12510] Precious to seize death's time—thus.
[12511] Examining actual: from uncommon and common. First, from that self: form-reflection in sky's space, becoming impermanent and dissolving, moon-form not existing is death. Limb four break in four months; above that head break in three months; upper lower divide in two months; roll in fist in one month—know that time.
[12512] Sky-earth two's connection-rope: if becoming cut, not able more than nineteen days. From Meru's sides, not falling from white lion, not liberated by sixteen days. If at mountain and plain boundary, wish-fulfilling tree waist breaks—these also examine by wise one.
[12513] 
[12514] 
[12515] 
[12516] 
[12517] 
[12518] 
[12519] 
[12520] 
[12521] 
[12522] 
[12523] 
[12524] 
[12525] 
[12526] 
[12527] 
[12528] 
[12529] 
[12530] 
[12531] 
[12532] 
[12533] 
[12534] 
[12535] 
[12536] 
[12537] 
[12538] 
[12539] 
[12540] 
[12541] When the ocean's water vapor dissolves,
[12542] This too is divided by the wise in sequence.
[12543] In earth's villages and cities,
[12544] If the monk's smoke itself breaks,
[12545] In nine days he will thus perish.
[12546] On the peak of Meru mountain,
[12547] If the unchanging sun sets,
[12548] In three days he will also die.
[12549] Completely abandon rites,
[12550] Examine the meaning of self-awareness essence.
[12551] From inside the hollow of Meru,
[12552] If the ḍākinī's sound breaks,
[12553] In thirteen or five days.
[12554] If from the wish-fulfilling tree,
[12555] The demon of death-lords rises,
[12556] In seven days he cannot be liberated.
[12557] That will not become benefit.
[12558] Habituation to emptiness is precious.
[12559] Thus.
[12560] Second, the common:
[12561] Also from that itself,
[12562] If the luster of limb nails is gone,
[12563] In nine months he cannot but perish.
[12564] If the vapor of the birth-being's eyes dissolves,
[12565] In five months likewise.
[12566] If the death-lord Yama himself rises,
[12567] In twenty-one days he dies.
[12568] Nothing can benefit that.
[12569] If the ankle of the foot protrudes outward,
[12570] In one month likewise.
[12571] If examining another's body,
[12572] When the birth-being is struck by disease,
[12573] Tartar accumulates at the tooth root,
[12574] In nine days he will also die.
[12575] In various five days likewise,
[12576] In that way also death.
[12577] Limbs repeatedly move and contract,
[12578] That is in seven days.
[12579] When eyes look with sticking grains,
[12580] In three days tro-ta.
[12581] If the eye joints are greatly disturbed,
[12582] That is in half a month.
[12583] If the cheek channels break,
[12584] In nineteen days likewise.
[12585] The birth-being does life formation,
[12586] If breath is also agitated in gasping,
[12587] That is in six months.
[12588] If the nose ma-si-ka breaks,
[12589] In seven days he will perish.
[12590] If the eye ba-ra-na breaks,
[12591] In five days he will also perish.
[12592] If the left cheek flesh falls,
[12593] In one day he will likewise perish.
[12594] If upper and lower teeth become closed,
[12595] In three days he cannot but perish.
[12596] If black drops arise on the tongue,
[12597] In two days he will also perish.
[12598] If ears stick to the head,
[12599] That is at midnight of that night.
[12600] If the chest protruding nose collapses,
[12601] In half a month he cannot but perish.
[12602] If there is no root for falling asleep,
[12603] That is also in half a month.
[12604] Thus.
[12605] Third, showing the method of reversal.
[12606] Gathering accumulations in special lands,
[12607] And doing the wheel of elemental dependent origination,
[12608] Through the three—deceiving demons with ransoms—explained to reverse even from exhausted life.
[12609] From that itself:
[12610] When signs arise in the body thus,
[12611] The rite of deceiving death is explained.
[12612] Beginning the karma of reversing the birth-being,
[12613] With one's own master and virtue assembly,
[12614] Gathering accumulations in special lands,
[12615] Pleasing with gifts and feasts,
[12616] Begin these rites.
[12617] For equal portions of elemental sounds,
[12618] On the palm tree's leaf,
[12619] The wheel of the five elements,
[12620] With four calculations, center and rim,
[12621] Wheels of earth, water, fire, wind, and sky,
[12622] Make five wheels,
[12623] Divided by colors according to elements.
[12624] In the center wall and five,
[12625] Five letters of each self,
[12626] Surrounded by the group of Ali at the rim.
[12627] Having written wheels thus,
[12628] Worship, praise, and confess impurity,
[12629] Make prayers according to each individual's desire.
[12630] Thinking of the elemental god in the center,
[12631] Recite and insert the number of letters.
[12632] Then in a fitted clay vessel,
[12633] Inserting all those wheels,
[12634] Bind crosswise with five colored threads.
[12635] Wood, water, fire, and earth,
[12636] In the mouth-vapor of disagreeing races,
[12637] Mix all that with dough-food,
[12638] Make a form of one cubit in the mixture.
[12639] Letters on the five faculties,
[12640] Write on paper and put inside unfolded.
[12641] By that restore weak elements.
[12642] If seized by demons,
[12643] Dough-food the extent of the birth-being's age,
[12644] Change the color itself,
[12645] With cloth-pieces of one's own stains,
[12646] Also elemental substances like that,
[12647] Mix with food and form.
[12648] With wool-colors, silk, and feathers,
[12649] Adorn those forms.
[12650] Also tormas agreeing with those,
[12651] Those too are like that.
[12652] In the last of that form, the dough-food,
[12653] Surround by the yogin's number of years.
[12654] Having blessed, recite these words:
[12655] "Take, take, O powerful ones,
[12656] Craving, attachment, grasping,
[12657] Remembering, seizing, thinking, and touching.
[12658] Release, peace, and liberate—recite these words three times. From that, send to river's channel. In reversing from death, no doubt in naraka—thus.
[12659] Fourth, showing death-time's appearance: individual appearances of channel-wind disturbed at individual elements' dissolving times. Sign of earth dissolving in earth: body heavy, not able to rise. Sign of water dissolving in water: water flows outward from mouth and nose, then dries. Sign of fire dissolving in fire: heat lost from body's four edges, luster and complexion gathered. Sign of wind dissolving in wind: breath gasps not arising, body's strength lost.
[12660] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12661] Earth dissolving in earth,
[12662] Likewise water, fire, and wind,
[12663] Individual individual dissolving in self—
[12664] Thus come in birth-being's body.
[12665] By earth dissolving in self,
[12666] Body heavy, food not taken,
[12667] All strength of rising and going exhausted.
[12668] At time of water dissolving in water,
[12669] Water of mouth and nose drips.
[12670] Likewise by fire dissolving in fire,
[12671] Mouth and nose greatly dry,
[12672] Heat of body's edges lost.
[12673] Likewise by wind dissolving in wind,
[12674] Breath coarse-coarse, limbs move,
[12675] Eye also turns upward—thus.
[12676] Fifth, three in instruction of giving: putting space-awareness self-place in excellent habituated; middle purifying transfer; last relying on other conditions.
[12677] First: yogins dying alone, without gather-separate in clear-light's appearance, at that time also not depending on other, by clear self-appearance, putting without distraction from that nature. Body key-posture of three which-any, or cross-legged, or by lion's sleep-method, dying in awareness space-awareness placed nature, in that moment liberating as upward penetrate-through, without dharmata intermediate state.
[12678] Also from that self:
[12679] At that time, the fortune-possessing birth-being,
[12680] If appearance self self-clear,
[12681] Thus consciousness not-remaining in self-place—thus.
[12682] 
[12683] 
[12684] 
[12685] 
[12686] 
[12687] 
[12688] 
[12689] 
[12690] 
[12691] 
[12692] 
[12693] 
[12694] 
[12695] 
[12696] 
[12697] 
[12698] 
[12699] 
[12700] 
[12701] 
[12702] 
[12703] By lion's sleep-method of aggregates: placing awareness self in eye, doing mind little interval-space as path. If space and awareness not changing, that person without intermediate state, no doubt in buddha; dying one's breath also becomes slow—thus.
[12704] Space-awareness habituated ones: at death-time, in snow, cave, person, etc., dying without mind-distracted conditions is important. Also by peaceful god:
[12705] Whoever stays near,
[12706] Also not doing grief,
[12707] By this no one becomes distracted
[12708] In buddha remembering, etc.—
[12709] Like thus said.
[12710] Second, doing transfer's key as shown before. That also, at time of life-wind entering consciousness-wind, lifting place from heart, being time, awareness from heart, thinking self's master's body color-filled, throwing by seven or twenty-one hig sounds to brahma-opening, liberating as moment-by penetrate-through in primordially-pure ground.
[12711] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12712] Though four winds cease by sequence,
[12713] At time moved by one great wind—
[12714] From thus:
[12715] Consciousness riding wind, purifying in wind,
[12716] Also precious to send above;
[12717] Precious to gather and throw awareness;
[12718] That also throwing by hig,
[12719] That meeting to master's mouth—thus.
[12720] At time of awareness's wisdom wind entering consciousness, here transferring, instructions hit clear here. From that self:
[12721] At that time, master's instructions,
[12722] Familiarize in self's continuum;
[12723] Also hit clear by these meanings—thus.
[12724] Transfer entering place and place at breath transfer-time, and instruction of space-awareness entering body and wisdom, are two; also in space-awareness, not relying on other conditions of habituated, and relying—explained as two. That is the place of instruction's form becoming three.
[12725] Third, relying on other conditions: at that time, by one without stain in master or vajra brother existence samaya, hitting clear.
[12726] 
[12727] 
[12728] 
[12729] 
[12730] 
[12731] 
[12732] 
[12733] 
[12734] 
[12735] 
[12736] 
[12737] 
[12738] 
[12739] 
[12740] 
[12741] 
[12742] 
[12743] 
[12744] That also resembling now's clear-light send-ma, like intermediate-state's clear-light early-ma; for reason of joining those two middle, showing appearance like space-awareness send-ma:
[12745] Exclamation! Son of the race, this present clear-light is actual self-arisen wisdom; in this nature, put mind without fabricating, and you are buddha in upward penetrate-through. Also look at this appearance not changing; this present clear-light becomes mixed with dharmata mother's clear-light, all appearances arising in buddha-field. At that time, do recognize as self-appearance. At that time, you are buddha in primordially-pure ground.
[12746] If not recognized there, at time of clear-light dissolving in spontaneously-accomplished, body and wisdom's appearance arises. From that, wisdom four preparation's appearance arises. From that, spontaneously-accomplished's hundred doors arise—by you, do recognize as self-appearance. After recognizing self-face, recite three times "you are well gone to primordially-pure ground"; self also putting equally moment in that appearance, and also giving clear in that. Liberated certain by that.
[12747] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12748] If space-awareness not clear,
[12749] In dharmata bliss intermediate state,
[12750] For grasping awareness's appearance,
[12751] Do in mind lights shown before;
[12752] By that obtain true appearance.
[12753] If those not clear,
[12754] At self's master remaining,
[12755] Also hit clear above instruction;
[12756] If master not exist, vajra brother,
[12757] Also do hit clear of knowing—thus.
[12758] Like that, hitting instruction continue to dying, or showing benefit to other by three jewel-form instructions at death-time for others of not-agreeing dharma awareness. That also: at that time of outer breath cut, inner breath not cut, do remain in manifest dharmata meaning for moment's interval by self. From that, other person separating from breath, that gap's mouth-nose three and self's mouth-nose three joined, wind going upward in three pieces.
[12759] 
[12760] 
[12761] 
[12762] 
[12763] 
[12764] 
[12765] 
[12766] 
[12767] 
[12768] 
[12769] 
[12770] 
[12771] 
[12772] 
[12773] 
[12774] 
[12775] 
[12776] 
[12777] Here gathering in three from: there, first piece think white AOM and throw; second with red AH throw; last throw without thinking anything. Here all three think as HUM, that consciousness blue-green HUM pull to self's awareness. Also in speech thus HUM cause, forcefully pull to shoe-sole. At that time, producing body-speech-mind three strength of self, pulling inside shoe-sole shoe-sole, that one's wind warm pierce certainly arises to self's inside.
[12778] At that time, coming by HRIQ between that other person's eyes; from that, body also comes able to rise suddenly. Like that becoming, show eye's thusness dharmata manifest appearance. When eye becomes suddenly, putting like introducing drop-empty lamp by thumb-finger: clear-light existing in self, that is this; this self at time of coming out from body, dharmata intermediate state arising as self-possessive, this is self-appearance, not other—do recognize self-face, thus hitting three times. When saying "see that appearance" or "understand that instruction," if voice comes, good; even if sign arises, it is hit.
[12779] Obtain not-thinking samadhi in dharmata intermediate state, certain to become buddha. That also from Sun-Moon Ga-Union:
[12780] If doing other's benefit,
[12781] For grasping that self by compassion,
[12782] Open door three's doors,
[12783] Breath: hold, inhale, and throw;
[12784] By inserting syllable three letters,
[12785] For producing body, speech, mind strength,
[12786] Do with breath together by wise one;
[12787] By doing like that again and again,
[12788] That one's appearance like this:
[12789] If obtaining body's strength,
[12790] Do hit instructions;
[12791] Yet if consciousness becomes clear,
[12792] Put equally in meaning self;
[12793] Faculty doors in self near,
[12794] Put eye's thusness looking;
[12795] If mind of equal remaining arises,
[12796] Obtain not-thinking possessing samadhi—thus.
[12797] This instruction called "hitting as robe-shake" is one great-important point of this Great Completion. Like that, gathering faculties, also hitting clear by key of reversing death again.
[12798] 
[12799] 
[12800]

[12814] Important meditation producing effort in not dying now. Sixth, showing birth-place signs: warmth dissolving to crown, certainly giving breath as excellent primordially-pure, middle intermediate state, last emanation-body. Ordinary birth-beings giving breath by birth in high realms. That also: at death-time, eye doing dust-eye, warmth gathering to genitals, birth toward animal. Hand moving right, warmth gathering to crown, god. Word confused, warmth gathering in right armpit, asura. Left foot moving, striking earth, warmth gathering to foot-sole, hell. Body yellow, luster not existing, warmth gathering to throat, hungry ghost. Word clear, memory not losing, warmth gathering in eye, birth in human birth-place.
[12815] Also from that self:
[12816] Outer appearance like this:
[12817] If warmth dissolves upward,
[12818] Become giving great breath;
[12819] If eye not clear, dust-eye,
[12820] Birth toward negative-path places.
[12821] If hands move right,
[12822] That person in god's place;
[12823] If word confused from mouth,
[12824] Birth like that in asura place;
[12825] Left foot striking earth,
[12826] That in hell's place;
[12827] Body's color yellow, luster not exist,
[12828] That in hungry-ghost land;
[12829] If uttering birth-being voice from mouth,
[12830] That in animal place;
[12831] Also or mouth mute, teeth closed,
[12832] Animal birth-place like that;
[12833] If word clear, memory not losing,
[12834] That in human's place.
[12835] Outer signs are those, join these inner signs: warmth gathering in crown, that in god's place; like that warmth gathering in foot-sole, that in hell's place; warmth gathering in right armpit, that in asura land; like that warmth gathering in throat, that person birth in hungry-ghost place; like that warmth gathering in genitals, that animal birth-place; warmth gathering in eye, birth in human's place. Thus whoever possesses signs, this is certain only—thus.
[12836] From those, especially warmth gathering to genitals at birth toward animal.

[12861] Teeth closed, or various animal voices uttered from mouth, or eye covered by dust-eye appearance—these are explained as outer-inner signs meeting.
[12862] Seventh, three in birth-place purifying rite: purifying at death-time, purifying on corpse, purifying after. First, from Sun-Moon Union:
[12863] By preparation of letter A,
[12864] Join breath and that number;
[12865] If not dying in that interval,
[12866] By breath placing mouth in crown,
[12867] Also in body's center by consciousness,
[12868] Focus A and gather.
[12869] Thus: at time of possessing rite like that, if that person's breath not separated, by letter together with breath, purify remaining without doubt—thus. Explaining this method for pulling most goers not seeing this dharma's door toward high realms.
[12870] Put thinking white light's sphere like egg inside that person's heart; doing pair focus as that gone upward-to-upward; self also focusing on that consciousness become like that; reciting A with tone together for short time, joining with that person's age breath outward going long; at time of breath gasping-gasping, placing mouth in that crown, reciting A A thus twenty-one, steam comes whistle-ru-ru; even evil one, send to high realms; also intellect-possessive view meditation one, send to dharmata.
[12871] If one possessing sign of birth toward hell, at time of separating from breath, focus that consciousness A in heart place or navel, melting by fire as light five, remaining self's upper garment moment, send to place above. Hungry ghosts, animals, asuras, gods, and humans also, send from above to above; birth toward human, send to liberation.
[12872] Rite of giving benefit by method of obtaining above bliss without experiencing below suffering. That also: if dying focus continue, send to above.
