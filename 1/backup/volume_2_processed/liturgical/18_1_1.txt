[9398] Thus having demonstrated all methods of taking experience through guidance method,
[9399] Now, extensively explaining the sequence of how to take experience through introduction, has two aspects:
[9400] Establishing all Dharmas by general introduction sequence,
[9401] And extensively explaining mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction.
[9402] First, the preparation preceding introduction:
[9403] From two actual introductions,
[9404] First:
[9405] Prepare dwelling-place direction half with sun's light-ray together, crystal without stain.
[9406] From Introduction Ornament Tantra:
[9407] Dwelling direction indeed to half,
[9408] Aperture possessing sun's light-ray,
[9409] By extending mirror making clear,
[9410] See light's appearance coming outside.
[9411] Thus it is spoken.
[9412] From that, by teacher's blessing demonstrating mirror example of Vajra-Mind introduction previously arisen,
[9413] The manner of arising in this Jambu continent:
[9414] From Samsara Dong-Sprug Precious Secret Tantra:
[9415] Holding the lineage of five Buddhas,
[9416] Five crystal stupa thousand-spans,
[9417] Possessing the nature of five wisdoms,
[9418] Holding the lineage of five sky-expanses,
[9419] Expanding to pervade the sky without appearance,
[9420] Individually clear, colors unmixed,
[9421] Three: essence, nature, compassion.
[9422] Essence: pure ground without ceasing.
[9423] Nature: five great elements.
[9424] Compassion: completely demonstrated form-body.
[9425] From Vajra-space mandala,
[9426] Nature spontaneously complete body,
[9427] Water-moon body possessing five wisdoms,
[9428] Possessing self-nature of unclear-clear.
[9429] Five crystal stupa thousand-spans,
[9430] Descended to Vajra-Holder's left.
[9431] Possessing three aspects of tone,
[9432] Enters corner in north-east direction.
[9433] In nighttime direction, see daytime.
[9434] When wisdom placed near right corner,
[9435] Become seeing certain single Buddha.
[9436] Wisdom, superior-seeing wisdom,
[9437] Is single Buddha intention.
[9438] When applying meaning with nectar tongue,
[9439] Awareness cuckoo is one word.
[9440] Supreme of changeless vajra body,
[9441] Instruction commentary possessing corner-proceeding,
[9442] Is Vajra-Mind's testaments.
[9443] Thus it is spoken.
[9444] Then to the place of thirty-three,
[9445] Upper story of Complete Victory Palace,
[9446] Descended to Potalaka.
[9447] Then descended to peak of Five-Peaks Mountain,
[9448] Then descended to Vajra-Seat,
[9449] Then descended to Gangs-Ti-Se,
[9450] Then that great stupa emanated as light-ray,
[9451] Speaking "dispel sentient beings' concepts"—
[9452] From the beginning when this world formed, from Vajra-space mandala emanation, nature's blessing,
[9453] Teacher Vajra-Holder descended to the left of Joyful-Stacked who went for beings' benefit,
[9454] Thirty-three and
[9455] Five-Peaks Mountain and
[9456] Vajra-Seat and
[9457] Descended one to one for beings' benefit in the interval of Snow-mountain Ti-Se,
[9458] Now abiding in the jewel light-emanating house at Ti-Se's peak,
[9459] Sky-goers, accomplished ones, and many awareness-mantra holders worship and aspire.
[9460] Though there is no actual mirror like that,
[9461] For determining indicative examples: various jewels,
[9462] Or self-arisen crystal from snow, ocean continent, etc., should be made into introduction mirror.
[9463] From Introduction Ornament:
[9464] Jewel heart-essence jewel blazing light, or
[9465] Jewel lapis lazuli blue, water-crystal, or
[9466] Earth's heart-essence jewel eye-ma-phug,
[9467] By stone's heart-essence jewel crystal,
[9468] Establish all Buddhas' state.
[9469] Thus it is spoken.
[9470] From Jewel Intricate Display:
[9471] The indicative example of Vajra-Mind:
[9472] White without stain, moon's color,
[9473] Examine from interval of dark and appearance.
[9474] By jewel luminosity without stain,
[9475] Endowed with five colors of appearance,
[9476] Five bodies not individually separate,
[9477] Not separate to front and back.
[9478] Great light of appear-clear Dharma-nature,
[9479] Clear Dharma-nature blazing all-as.
[9480] Supreme lamp making appearance,
[9481] In sky-expanse of great emptiness,
[9482] All appearance arises as light.
[9483] That arising itself is not separate.
[9484] Cannot be grasped by anyone.
[9485] If possessing wisdom eye,
[9486] Like full moon of self-appear without stain,
[9487] See beautiful-face mandala,
[9488] Meditate great perfect without distraction.
[9489] Thus it is spoken.
[9490] Wash that mirror like that with mantra-water, with devotion to one's root guru,
[9491] Bless with OM AH HUM hundred thousand times, scatter flowers with dependent-origination heart-essence, speak auspicious words,
[9492] Request rule with seven branches,
[9493] Speak auspicious words again,
[9494] Offer garments imagining five colored silks and incense powder.
[9495] All examples should precede.
[9496] Second, regarding actual direct introduction:
[9497] Lineage and
[9498] Direct introduction—two aspects.
[9499] Lineage:
[9500] Lineage through the Buddha's intention,
[9501] Lineage through signs of awareness-holders,
[9502] And lineage through personal ear-whispered transmission—three are spoken.
[9503] Actual direct introduction:
[9504] The precious instruction of direct introduction, the single vehicle,
[9505] Single family,
[9506] Single bindu,
[9507] Single eye of primordial wisdom.
[9508] When shown through the mirror of Vajrasattva as a single example,
[9509] Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.
[9510] The vastness free from elaboration,
[9511] The body ornamented with merit,
[9512] To the emanation Vajra Light-Vitality,
[9513] The Bhagavān of Infinite Splendor,
[9514] From the vastness of pure non-birth,
[9515] Emitted three drops of the supreme enlightenment essence,
[9516] From the manifest body appearing like a water-moon mandala,
[9517] Bringing forth the body-drop, the crystal secret body, established as example wisdom.
[9518] From the vastness of speech free from elaboration,
[9519] The speech-drop, extracting the essence of enlightenment mind nectar,
[9520] Introduction to the wisdom of meaning.
[9521] From the state unchanging like the vajra mind,
[9522] The mind-drop, bringing forth the clear lamp of enlightenment mind essence,
[9523] Established with certainty through the wisdom of signs.
[9524] The body-drop ornamented with five self-arisen wisdoms,
[9525] Through primordial wisdom naturally completely pure and stainless, clear without front or back,
[9526] Great direct-penetration wisdom,
[9527] Clear without outside or inside,
[9528] Non-dual wisdom,
[9529] From the inside of non-inside,
[9530] Through condition-free wisdom parts intermixed and clear,
[9531] Non-intermixed completely perfect wisdom,
[9532] The supreme inconceivable child-appearance and time simultaneously arisen,
[9533] Simultaneously arisen wisdom,
[9534] Holding the lineage of the body of infinite appearance,
[9535] Eliminating the thoughts of beings,
[9536] Called the great bodily relics.
[9537] Through the example showing the three bodies and five wisdoms, the wisdom of Vajrasattva is clear.
[9538] Though there are many forms of showing examples, among examples, that which becomes supreme is called the precious crystal.
[9539] Through showing by means of the crystal, naturally completely pure, clear without outside or inside,
[9540] Recognize the dharmakāya.
[9541] Relying on the inner light of the crystal,
[9542] From the wind possessing four limbs that becomes the life of prajñā,
[9543] Recognize the manner of clarity as the body of prajñā.
[9544] Relying on the light of outer clarity,
[9545] Recognize the manner of arising of light as the emanation body.
[9546] Through showing by means of the crystal support, recognize the nature of ground-abiding wisdom.
[9547] Recognize the wisdom holding the characteristic of inner clarity.
[9548] Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through outer clarity.
[9549] Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through dissolving inside.
[9550] Through showing the various appearances of the crystal,
[9551] Recognize the manner of appearing.
[9552] Through showing the nature of the crystal itself, recognize the single abiding nature.
[9553] Through the crystal possessing its own light, recognize as Rigpa wisdom.
[9554] These also, when summarized from the definite aspect of showing examples:
[9555] From the Tantra of Arranged Lamps:
[9556] Through intention signs and ear-continuum lineage,
[9557] The valid cognition of secret mantra meaning arises.
[9558] Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.
[9559] Relying on signs, confidence is born.
[9560] Through deciding the essence of meaning,
[9561] The three wisdoms established in the ground,
[9562] Abiding in the manner of a seed,
[9563] Through prajñā arising from conditions,
[9564] Through ripening in the manner of fruit,
[9565] The darkness of non-recognition is cleared.
[9566] Through the self-purification of obstacles to the knowable,
[9567] The fruit not sought is seen by oneself.
[9568] The meaning thus spoken should be introduced in sequence.
[9569] To that, first the general ground of self-arisen nature body
[9570] Should be introduced.
[9571] In that, nature, nature, and compassion abide as three.
[9572] That single bindu possessing the essence of empty Rigpa,
[9573] The teacher holds a single clear mirror,
[9574] Shows the student,
[9575] And speaks these words:
[9576] "This mirror of Samantabhadra's clear appearance,
[9577] "Through appropriate examples, makes one recognize the nature.
[9578] "That meaning of recognition is the introduction to clear appearance.
[9579] "First, the introduction to Samantabhadra's abiding nature.
[9580] "Rigpa abiding in direct penetration is like crystal.
[9581] "Rigpa, thought-free and clear, is like crystal.
[9582] "Rigpa abiding in spontaneous presence is like crystal.
[9583] "Rigpa, unceasing and direction-free, is like crystal."
[9584] Thus it is said.
[9585] Though five lights are clear to outer eye,
[9586] Possessing nature of clear from within,
[9587] Nature:
[9588] White light also abides not separate from that, demonstrating compassion.
[9589] Though crystal essence demonstrates primordially pure and three,
[9590] By non-separation, understand through that example how single bindu meaning abides within.
[9591] Then demonstrating delusion-base:
[9592] Extend crystal to sun-ray,
[9593] Demonstrate outer two interior lights,
[9594] Condition of cause: ignorance of one self-nature at time of base-appear arising from base.
[9595] Field possessing five colors,
[9596] Demonstrate mind searching all for that subtle white.
[9597] That beginning move arises together with light,
[9598] Arises as knowable's obscuration: co-arising ignorance.
[9599] By wisdom's sense-power transcending from All-Good base, separate distinction in one moment,
[9600] Complete Buddha in one moment,
[9601] Is before Buddha as great-grandfather without common of all Buddhas.
[9602] By this liberation manner,
[9603] Should know all first Buddha's arising manner and arising manner.
[9604] First Buddha without cause,
[9605] Buddha without beginning or end,
[9606] One wisdom eye without stain.
[9607] Thus spoken from Manjushri.
[9608] Demonstrating All-Good's liberation base.
[9609] Also, having known base-appear arising from base and liberating, speaks that immeasurable Buddhas not deluded in samsara now also arise from space.
[9610] That base-appear, sentient beings not knowing as self-appear,
[9611] Arises as affliction-obscuration of all-imagined ignorance.
[9612] Thus,
[9613] Delusion various arises by awareness rise-sleep habit-continuum.
[9614] That also like placing hopes on various colored crystal cloth,
[9615] Or placing each white light on each white color etc.
[9616] There, awareness-wisdom and concept-collection net.
[9617] Entering body's interior,
[9618] Manner of four-holding awareness abiding in heart center,
[9619] Give introduction to manner pervading all sentient beings.
[9620] That is also introduction of nature's delusion manner.
[9621] Delusion arising from condition like crystal light.
[9622] Various things appearing like crystal light.
[9623] Appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal.
[9624] Without exhaust, without increase, like crystal light.
[9625] Make all thus spoken understood, well apply sign meaning.
[9626] Sign meaning of liberating deluded sentient beings:
[9627] From Lamp Blaze:
[9628] Base itself, wisdom making fruit ripen.
[9629] By ripening in wisdom-body,
[9630] That essence-itself Dharma-body
[9631] Ripens in wisdom Dharma-body.
[9632] From thus speaking.
[9633] From heart center, wisdom three-stack lung wind and wisdom's two tones meeting,
[9634] Power becoming mind,
[9635] Example of abiding unmoving dissolving in base manner.
[9636] Example of white mind, interior light emanating outer.
[9637] Called sixth mind.
[9638] Example of five lights wisdom.
[9639] Awareness holding base.
[9640] That example introduction of mind and wisdom two is suitable.
[9641] Intermediate introduction: sound, light, ray three,
[9642] And Vajra-Mind heart-interval nadi path introduction etc. appropriate all, produce certain knowing in crystal.
[9643] Yogin applying essence and knowing, making confidence, should be diligent in experience.
[9644] Liberation manner as fruit:
[9645] Though above interior-clear primordially pure liberation base is clear as self-arise essence-itself body,
[9646] Called outer-clear,
[9647] Give introduction to mixing five lights and white two.
[9648] This has great essential point if wisdom exists.
[9649] Path wisdom or
[9650] Desiring wisdom without extremely not abiding middle,
[9651] Or desiring wisdom without in our great perfect primordially pure,
[9652] Though delusion pure from root,
[9653] Arising without ceasing two bodies.
[9654] Wisdom must exist in space,
[9655] That mixing of five lights and white is mirror wisdom.
[9656] Example of white arising separately, emanation-body emanating from enjoyment-body.
[9657] Those are introduction of Buddha-hood as all-knowing in two-possessing purity.
[9658] Called "who superior passed from Buddha nirvana":
[9659] Emanation-body and enjoyment-body dissolving into Dharma-body,
[9660] By being free from crystal sun's condition,
[9661] Abiding undeluded having seized stable ground at beginning's primordially pure base,
[9662] Though liberated like that, essence not separate,
[9663] By distinction of aware and not-aware,
[9664] Called all-knowing: all abiding only in wisdom-body.
[9665] Mainly possessing two wisdoms.
[9666] Existing as interior-clear, that essence delivering to cease ground and first human's common-base self-arise essence-itself body are not separate.
[9667] However, like sun obscured by cloud,
[9668] From portion of realization becoming manifest by liberating from all obscurations, knowing self-essence like liberation,
[9669] Beginning base and
[9670] End liberation ground two—very great distinction.
[9671] Great essential point.
[9672] Wisdom swirling in space like crystal light.
[9673] Dharma-body arising clear-pure like crystal itself.
[9674] Thus it is spoken.
[9675] That Dharma-body of knowing self-essence, self itself abiding in self-bed,
[9676] If desiring to hold stable ground of undeluded Dharma-body now also,
[9677] Great essential point is keeping undistracted, clear, snap in manner of great open naked self-clear,
[9678] From glorious holy guru protector of beings' mouth:
[9679] Dharma-body of knowing self-essence is self-bed itself,
[9680] All who desire to hold stable undeluded ground,
[9681] Essential point is doing not-wrong, not-deluded, not-distracted,
[9682] Let wisdom-possessing know intention like ocean.
[9683] Thus well spoken.
[9684] At time of all this introduction, relaxing freshly, self also producing uncommon new confidence, should demonstrate to others.
[9685] Also from World Sun Dharma-Lord Guru's mouth:
[9686] Should carefully give introductions in sequence.
[9687] Ha-le!
[9688] Ho-le!
[9689] Without portion of what exists.
[9690] Not introduction.
[9691] Not introduced, do not.
[9692] Do not declare non-Dharma action.
[9693] Do not follow for delusion.
[9694] Do not do bad non-Dharma actions taking guru etc.'s name.
[9695] Thus making instruction: need to make name and meaning together.
[9696] Respectfully place in mind thus all who have entered this Dharma in future times.
[9697] Second meaning: extensively demonstrating mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction has two aspects:
[9698] Mind's introduction of delusion reversing manner from root awareness,
[9699] And self-appear wisdom's introduction of awareness with self-appear.
[9700] First:
[9701] From Introduction Ornament:
[9702] E-ma-ho!
[9703] Manner of coming to mind by giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[9704] Reach expanding bliss of empty by giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[9705] Giving introduction of empty as awareness,
[9706] Awareness itself without space and wisdom two. Thus it is spoken.
[9707] In this, three:
[9708] Establishing inner mind by outer field's essential point,
[9709] Establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point,
[9710] Establishing supreme awareness itself by secret space's essential point.
[9711] First, demonstrating deluded baseless appearance field,
[9712] From two: demonstrating self-mind empty of appearance-holding.
[9713] First: these various outer white-red appearances, clear in expanse gathered by five elements of container-contents,
[9714] Except appearing on face of self-mind's delusion, outer meaning thing,
[9715] And inner mind's thing, both not established,
[9716] Should understand as like deluded hair-shadow and dream illusion appearance, nature of clear-appear without base-without empty miracle.
[9717] From Six Expanses:
[9718] All appearance is illusion,
[9719] Like dream and reflection.
[9720] Thus it is spoken.
[9721] From Root Wisdom:
[9722] Like dream, like illusion,
[9723] Like gandharva city,
[9724] Like-that arising and like-that abiding,
[9725] Like-that also not destroyed. Thus it is spoken.
[9726] Appearing to mind whatever appears,
[9727] Like appearance to impure sense-power of eye-defect's hair-shadow.
[9728] From that same source:
[9729] To mind itself existing as object,
[9730] Various appearances self-arise.
[9731] Name and color individually
[9732] Complete as two aspects of form.
[9733] Thus it is spoken.
[9734] Though appearing to mind, these outer-clear appearance manners are not self's mind,
[9735] Existing also without self,
[9736] Abiding as field,
[9737] Color,
[9738] Because seeing as shape etc.
[9739] Not mind because those do not exist in mind.
[9740] Here, giving introduction like dream delusion of clear-appear, not existing: these appearances of outer appearance fields like form etc.,
[9741] "This is form,"
[9742] Thinking color etc., arising-arising, first the appearance-field of arising, holding that is called "mind of appearance,"
[9743] Called "mind of grasping,"
[9744] Having seized essence, called "mind of field."
[9745] Questioning if that mind of appearance exists: not true by holding clear-appear without field,
[9746] Also not existing by color not established as essence seize,
[9747] Also not existing by examining in three: arise, cease, abide.
[9748] Called "giving introduction of mind itself as empty,"
[9749] Give introduction as wisdom Buddha without self-dissolving place.
[9750] Therefore ordinary Dharma and
[9751] Great perfect ordinary's appearance,
[9752] Not separating appearance field,
[9753] Desiring outer appearance field self-characteristic as mind
[9754] Is mistake into odor-with various-true mind-only.
[9755] Here, at time of giving introduction of appearance as mind, mind holding as appear-not-appear,
[9756] Mind of appearance to mind first meeting field,
[9757] After, examining that distinction as mental event, desiring called "mind of holding,"
[9758] Called "samsara: delusion-hold, delusion-appear, purify, abandon."
[9759] 
[9760] In two truths,
[9761] Of mind and mental-event, three realms',
[9762] Superimposing aspect is concept.
[9763] Thus it is spoken.
[9764] From Treasury:
[9765] "Concept and examine coarse-subtle."
[9766] Thus explained as abandonment, entering together all meaning—this great essential point should be realized by those possessing supreme holy wisdom intelligence.
[9767] Also, need one like this for meeting baseless outer-inner.
[9768] Second, establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point:
[9769] When not seizing essence by examining mind,
[9770] Not becoming like inert,
[9771] Though declaring not knowing spread-spread clear without essence seize,
[9772] Give introduction as inner Dharma-space of Dharma-ceasing, arising primordially pure, stain-free space of self-clear empty self-tone manner,
[9773] Realization of limit-free, stain-free arises from within.
[9774] Seeing also secondary appearance of luminosity space-appear by familiarizing in that manner.
[9775] From Introduction Ornament:
[9776] By empty not-existing from-beginning,
[9777] Element self-ceasing, light-appearance ray.
[9778] By empty free of action-agent,
[9779] Obtain light-appearance indicating three bodies.
[9780] Thus it is spoken.
[9781] Third, establishing supreme awareness by secret space's essential point:
[9782] That mind-pure empty in space is not mere empty extreme,
[9783] Clear — snap,
[9784] Give introduction to Dharma-body free from stain, wisdom of awareness by individual self-clear self-clear.
[9785] Not going to extreme from awareness portion,
[9786] Not going to eternal by thing not-existing,
[9787] Placed in decided manner in great vast limit-free expanse of not-two-both and not-two-both by nowhere declaring.
[9788] Self-appear awareness self-tone nadi-thread with bindu.
[9789] From that same source:
[9790] By awareness abiding in base,
[9791] Meet space of gathered Dharma-nature.
[9792] By awareness holding characteristic,
[9793] Meet pure complete space.
[9794] By nadi-thread awareness,
[9795] Meet light space of nature.
[9796] Thus it is spoken.
[9797] Thus giving introduction to baseless appearance field.
[9798] Transcend samsara of appearance field's container-contents.
[9799] Giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[9800] Knowing object of self-dissolving arise-liberate.
[9801] Giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[9802] Cut root of grasp-hold delusion.
[9803] Giving introduction of empty as space-awareness,
[9804] Rolling experience of three bodies into one,
[9805] For obtaining perfect Buddha in one life,
[9806] Demonstrating introduction of delusion reversing manner from mind as very important.
[9807] By example introduction:
[9808] Meaning of wisdom of awareness existing in self,
[9809] Demonstrating sign confidence by awakening mind's lamp.
[9810] From that same source:
[9811] Holding measure of all Buddhas,
[9812] Examine example wisdoms.
[9813] Holding measure of sign wisdom,
[9814] Examine lamp of empty bindu.
[9815] Holding measure of meaning wisdom,
[9816] Examine clear manifest appearance.
[9817] Thus it is spoken.
[9818] Briefly summarized:
[9819] Outer appearance field baseless,
[9820] Giving introduction of mind of holding that appearance as empty,
[9821] Knowing samsara delusion as one groundless,
[9822] Not sufficient by that,
[9823] Giving introduction manifestly to meaning of root awareness, giving introduction without gathering-separation of space-awareness,
[9824] Instruction to supreme excellent intelligences: should deliver to primordially pure Dharma-body.
[9825] Second meaning: introduction of self-appear wisdom has two aspects:
[9826] Distinction of sense-power of instruction object,
[9827] And sequence of instruction introduction.
[9828] First:
[9829] Dividing best, middle, and last three sense-powers into sevens makes twenty-one.
[9830] Those all also: wisdom,
[9831] Purification,
[9832] Different liberation.
[9833] First, called "best":
[9834] Portion of wisdom and realization.
[9835] Also dividing that, seven:
[9836] Best's last and
[9837] Best's middle and
[9838] Best's best and
[9839] Best's advanced and
[9840] Best's supreme and
[9841] Best's peak and
[9842] Best's end reaching.
[9843] Placing those all from portion of easily realizing self-appear.
[9844] Also seven for middle:
[9845] Middle's last and
[9846] Middle's middle and
[9847] Middle's best and
[9848] Middle's advanced and
[9849] Middle's supreme and
[9850] Middle's peak and
[9851] Middle's end reaching.
[9852] Likewise, also seven for last:
[9853] Last's last and
[9854] Last's middle and
[9855] Last's best and
[9856] Last's supreme and
[9857] Last's advanced and
[9858] Last's peak and
[9859] Last's peak complete.
[9860] Second:
[9861] Thus twenty-one sense-powers arise, twenty-one introductions also arise.
[9862] That also, from individually giving introduction, two:
[9863] Common distinction,
[9864] Distinct indicative manner.
[9865] First:
[9866] To three: light, wisdom, awareness,
[9867] Giving introduction as seven groups.
[9868] From Vajra-Mind Heart Mirror Tantra:
[9869] Awareness transcends from base,
[9870] Should know twenty-one introductions—example meaning introduction etc.—for making known entering path.
[9871] Snow or
[9872] Conch or
[9873] One crystal without stain arising from ocean:

[9875] Five colors of light spontaneously arise.
[9876] Also, what are those?

[9879] Yellow and
[9880] Red and
[9881] Green.
[9882] That person following one crystal: hold right eye with right hand,
[9883] Place on eye's top, appearance will be seen; block left eye with left hand.
[9884] That is example introduction.
[9885] Meaning thus abides in self's heart center.
[9886] That is meaning introduction.
[9887] Press eye with self's thumb, sign: bindu of light arises like fish eye.
[9888] That is sign introduction.

[9894] Look eye to sky,
[9895] Enjoyment complete body possessing mouth, eye, ear will be seen.
[9896]

[9898] Make know essence: dharma-possessor appearing as sign is miracle of self-awareness.
[9899] Make know as mass of self's light rays on Dharma day.
[9900] Make know essence without abandoning this interior of concept habit-continuum.
[9901] That is emanation body's introduction.
[9902] That root bind method introduction of appearance arising in self-manner.
[9903] Thus seven aspects called "light introduction."
[9904] What is wisdom's introduction?
[9905] Examining essence of copper vessel: introduction of Dharma space's wisdom.
[9906] Fill copper vessel well with water,
[9907] Place clear-making mirror on eye's top, look:
[9908] Bindu and

[9912] That is Dharma space's wisdom introduction.
[9913] What is mirror-like wisdom's introduction?

[10080] 
[10081] 
[10082] 
[10083] 
[10084] 
[10085]

[10120] 
[10121] 
[10122] 
[10123] 
[10124] 
[10125] 
[10126] 
[10127] 
[10128] 
[10129] 
[10130] 
[10131] 
[10132] To all middling elaboration: at light, two—interior light and outer appearance.
[10133] At wisdom, three—essence, nature, compassion.
[10134] At body: self-single, father-mother.
[10135] Three collections.
[10136] At bindu: three—base, path, fruit.
[10137] At awareness: three—base-abiding, characteristic-holding, field-appearance.
[10138] At space: two—outer, inner; demonstrating by sixteen enumeration of introduction.
[10139] To all small elaboration: three—example, meaning, sign.
[10140] To all very free from elaboration: meeting essence by manifest single appearance.
[10141] From that same source:
[10142] For purpose of all great ones,
[10143] By twenty-one introductions,
[10144] Gather that from outer to inner.
[10145] Also gathered: these all.
[10146] At light, two; at wisdom, three.

[10148] Awareness, three; at space, two.

[10159] By self seeing self heart-essence,
[10160] What do by all other efforts?
[10161] Should familiarize with this itself.
[10162] Thus it is spoken.
[10163] Abandoning inner scriptural contradiction:
[10164] From Jewel Intricate Display:
[10165] Alas, Buddha-family son, after I completely pass from nirvana,
[10166] At the time of five hundred degenerations,
[10167] By those possessing deceiving child's nature,
[10168] The time arises of making confidence in Buddha's intention through example.
[10169] At that time, this secret tantra of self arises.
[10170] True awareness itself cannot be demonstrated by example.
[10171] To five lights of nature existing as self-nature,
[10172] Though demonstrating five lights of image, will not become Buddha.
[10173] Question: Is example introduction not blocked?
[10174] That is: without seeing meaning of manifest awareness, mind-examining-holding—some say awareness's example is like this, like sky;
[10175] Some say different elements;
[10176] Some say light;
[10177] Demonstrate by god's body.
[10178] Common vehicle general,
[10179] Making only pure nature of low for some portions of outer-inner secret,
[10180] To negate base of primordially pure awareness,
[10181] Is spoken for negating grasping at thing's self-characteristic.
[10182] At this occasion demonstrating meaning of secret heart essence,
[10183] However much demonstrating example, no deviation,
[10184] No grasping place.
[10185] Those seeing manifest awareness, though introduction only as that's helper,
[10186] Again essence,
[10187] Expansion,
[10188] By dissolve manner, like crystal, great open primordially pure—demonstrate by crystal above pure,
[10189] With suitability.
[10190] That tantra also demonstrates this little, speaks thus.
[10191] From that same source:
[10192] Indicative example of Vajra-Mind:
[10193] White color, moon's color,
[10194] Etc., thus demonstrating awareness by three: example, sign, meaning,
[10195] Demonstrating birthless, ceaseless, open expanse.
[10196] Then this introduction suitable to sense-power:
[10197] With experience-taking hand-guidance,
[10198] Without deviation place, without stagnate place,
[10199] Ear lineage and hand gesture together,
[10200] Confidence,
[10201] Cutting superimposition,
[10202] Connecting word and meaning.
[10203] Supreme introduction spoken for demonstrating place of Buddha's Dharma lineage.
[10204] ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[10205] Demonstrating by relying on difficult introduction of vajra place,
