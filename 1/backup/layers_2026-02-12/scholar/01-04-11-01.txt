Cittamatra Non-Dual Wisdom
**Analysis:**

**Holding Consciousness:**

The holding consciousness (*'dzin pa'i rnam shes*) arises from mind itself, not from external objects.

**Aspect-Consciousness Relation:**

When holding objects:
- Outer aspect consciousness (*phyi'i rnam pa'i rnam shes*) — the appearance
- Inner-holding consciousness (*nang 'dzin pa'i rnam shes*) — the apprehension

Both arise through beginningless latent tendencies.

**Self-Awareness Alone:**

*rang rig tsam las gzhan med par grub* — established merely as self-awareness, nothing else.

**Non-Dual Primordial Wisdom:**

*gnyis med ye shes* — non-dual wisdom is the stainless suchness (*dri ma med pa'i de bzhin nyid*).

**At Time of Remainder (*lhag ma'i dus*):**

- Slight stain of latent tendencies appears mistaken
- Taste, sickness, etc. exist conventionally
- When stain of mixed affliction and wisdom purified
- False part of affliction removed
- Pure wisdom of remainder manifests

**Pure Not Established as False:**

The pure is not merely false aspects and consciousness.

**Manifest Attachment:**

Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated in the small work of mind.

**Appearance as Reflection:**

Objects appear as various white and red aspects, like reflections.

Both measurer and measured non-existent, yet appearing.

This page completes the Cittamātra presentation and transitions to Svātantrika Madhyamaka. The structural progression follows:

1. **Lines 3022-3027**: Completion of Pure Appearance (dri med dag pa ba) position—explaining how afflictions mixed with wisdom are removed to reveal pure non-dual wisdom

2. **Lines 3028-3034**: Elaboration of Pure Appearance view—appearances and consciousness have no true establishment even conventionally

3. **Lines 3035-3048**: Transition to Svātantrika Madhyamaka (dbu ma pa la rang rgyud pa), which further refutes Cittamātra's residual subtle realism

**Doxographical Architecture**:
- Cittamātra completes with assertion of self-cognizing wisdom as ultimately existent
- Svātantrika refutes even this residual essentialism
- Within Svātantrika, two branches introduced:
  * Illusion-like Ultimate (sgyu ma don dam du 'dod pa)
  * Complete Non-abiding (rab tu mi gnas pa)

[3037-3044] [CONCEPT]
**The Svātantrika Revolution**: This is a watershed moment in Buddhist philosophy. The Svātantrikas say: "You Cittamātrins claim that self-cognizing wisdom is ultimately real. But we ask: does this wisdom exist inherently? If it truly exists (truly ultimate), it must have inherent existence. But inherent existence cannot be found!"

**The Three Natures Revisited**: The Cittamātra uses the three natures (trisvabhāva):
1. Imagined nature (parikalpita) — totally unreal
2. Dependent nature (paratantra) — conventionally real  
3. Perfected nature (pariniṣpanna) — ultimately real

Svātantrika says: Even the perfected nature is empty of inherent existence. The ultimate truth is not a "thing" that exists.

**Illusion-like Ultimate**: The Svātantrika proposes that the ultimate truth is like an illusion (sgyu ma). It appears (we have valid cognition of emptiness), but it has no inherent existence. This preserves the validity of appearance while denying essence.

[3040-3044] [PHILOLOGY]
**don dam par so so rang gi rig pa'i ye shes de yang rang bzhin gyis ngo bo nyid med pa'o zhes 'dod do**
- **rang bzhin gyis**: By nature, inherently (svabhāva-taḥ)
- **ngo bo nyid med pa**: Without inherent existence (niḥsvabhāva)
- **zhes 'dod do**: "Thus they assert" — introducing the Svātantrika position

[3040-3042] [PHILOLOGY]
**sgyu ma don dam du 'dod pa...ma grub pa rig pa'i ye shes smra bsam brjod med tsam zhig**
- **sgyu ma**: Illusion, magical display (māyā)
- **smra bsam brjod med**: Inexpressible, inconceivable, incommunicable
- **tsam zhig**: Merely, only — limiting particle

[3040-3044] [CONTEXT]
**Illusion-like Ultimate (sgyu ma don dam)**: This branch of Svātantrika (associated with later Bhāvaviveka followers) holds that the ultimate truth is like an illusion—it appears but has no true existence. This preserves the validity of conventional appearance while denying ultimate reality. The meditation on illusion-like appearance becomes the path to realizing emptiness.

[3045-3048] [CONTEXT]
**Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Citation**: This famous verse appears in the "Middle" Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra (8000 lines). It establishes the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—both are dream-like and illusion-like. This sūtra, composed around 100 BCE - 100 CE, is the earliest Prajñāpāramitā text and foundational for all Mahāyāna philosophy.

================================================================================

[3045-3048] [CONCEPT]
**The Equivalence of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa**: The Aṣṭasāhasrikā verse is revolutionary: even nirvāṇa is dream-like and illusion-like. This means:

1. There's no ultimately real nirvāṇa to attain
2. There's no ultimately real saṃsāra to escape from
3. The distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is conventional, not ultimate
4. Liberation is not a "place" or "state" but the recognition of the nature of appearance

**Why This Matters**: If nirvāṇa were truly existent, it would be a permanent phenomenon (śāśvata). If saṃsāra were truly non-existent, it would be nihilism (uccheda). The Middle Way avoids both extremes by showing the equivalence of appearance and emptiness in both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.

**The Dream Analogy Applied**: When you wake from a dream, the dream-horse and dream-ox cease. But did they "go" somewhere? No—they never truly existed. Similarly, when wisdom dawns, saṃsāra doesn't "go" somewhere—it is seen to have never truly existed. This is not nihilism because the appearance is valid conventionally; it's just not ultimately real.

Illusion and Ultimate Truth
**Analysis:**

**Dream and Illusion:**

All phenomena like dream, like illusion (*rmi lam sgyu ma lta bu*).

All phenomena merely various objects and consciousness.

**Nirvana Attains Form-Body:**

Nirvana works benefit through form-body.

**Excellent Dharma:**

One's own self-aware suchness and supreme dharma-body.

**Autonomous Lower (*rang rgyud 'og ma*):**

Those who assert:
- Illusion as established reasoning (*sgyu ma grub pa'i rigs pa*)
- Appearance as merely illusion (*snang ba sgyu ma tsam*)
- Merely illusion — various divisions beyond measure

**Second Position:**

In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides.
- No objects or aspects
- Self-aware experience does not exist
- Like barren woman's son
- No meeting consciousness

**Conventional Truth Not True:**

Since conventional truth is not true, ultimate truth is non-abiding.

**de yang rmi lam lta bu sgyu ma lta bu zhes so / chos thams cad ni yul shes sna tshogs pa thams cad do / mya ngan las 'das pa ni gzugs sku brnyes nas don mdzad pa'o**
- **de yang**: That also (emphatic continuation)
- **yul shes sna tshogs pa**: Various objects and consciousnesses
- **gzugs sku**: Form body (rūpakāya) — referring to Saṃbhogakāya and Nirmāṇakāya
- **brnyes nas**: Having attained, obtained (perfective aspect)
- **don mdzad pa'o**: Performs benefit/activity for beings

[3049-3052] [CONTEXT]
**Interpretation of Nirvāṇa**: The text clarifies that in the Illusion-like Ultimate view, "nirvāṇa" refers to the form bodies (gzugs sku = rūpakāya) through which Buddhas perform activities. Higher than this is the suchness of self-cognizing awareness and the supreme dharmakāya. This distinction reflects the trikāya (three bodies) doctrine: Nirmāṇakāya (emanation body), Saṃbhogakāya (enjoyment body), and Dharmakāya (truth body).

[3049-3052] [CONCEPT]
**The Form Body as Nirvāṇa**: The text makes a crucial distinction:

1. **Nirvāṇa as Activity**: When we say Buddhas "attain nirvāṇa," we often mean they manifest form bodies (rūpakāya) and perform activities for beings. This is the conventional meaning of nirvāṇa.

2. **Nirvāṇa as Suchness**: Higher than this is the suchness (de bzhin nyid) realized by self-cognizing awareness — the ultimate nature.

3. **Nirvāṇa as Dharmakāya**: Supreme is the dharmakāya itself, beyond all description.

**Why This Matters**: Many Buddhists think of nirvāṇa as a "place" or "state" to attain. This analysis shows that:
- The form bodies are manifestations, not the ultimate
- The ultimate is not "something else" but the nature of things as they are
- True nirvāṇa is not "attained" but recognized

[3050-3052] [PHILOLOGY]
**de bas lhag pa'i chos ni so so rang gi rig pa'i de bzhin nyid dang chos sku dam pa'o**
- **de bas lhag pa**: Superior to that, higher than that
- **dam pa**: Supreme, excellent, holy
- Construction: "What is superior to that is..."

**sgyu ma rigs grub tu 'dod pa dang / sgyu ma ltar snang du 'dod pa dang / sgyu ma tsam por 'dod pa...rab tu mi gnas pa gnyis las**
- **rigs grub tu 'dod pa**: Asserting establishment by reason/reality (yukti-siddha)
- **lta bu**: Like, similar to
- **ltar**: In the manner of
- **tsam por**: Merely, only as
- **rab tu mi gnas pa**: Complete non-abiding
- **gnyis las**: From/among the two

[3053-3056] [CONTEXT]
**Svātantrika Sub-classifications**: Tibetan doxographers identify multiple ways of asserting illusion-like nature:
1. **sgyu ma rigs grub tu 'dod pa**: Illusion established by reasoning/logic
2. **sgyu ma ltar snang du 'dod pa**: Appearing in the manner of illusion
3. **sgyu ma tsam por 'dod pa**: Only as illusion, mere illusion

These represent progressively more refined positions, with the "mere illusion" view being closer to Prāsaṅgika.

[3053-3058] [CONCEPT]
**Levels of Understanding Illusion**: The text reveals progressive understandings of the illusion analogy:

1. **Lower**: Illusion established by reasoning (rigs grub) — logically proven to be like illusion
2. **Middle**: Appearing as illusion (ltar snang) — directly perceived as illusion-like
3. **Higher**: Mere illusion (tsam po) — only illusion, nothing else at all

**Progression**: Like learning about fire:
- First, you read that fire burns (established by reasoning)
- Then you see fire from a distance (appearing as)
- Finally, you experience the burning (mere fire)

Each level is closer to direct realization.

[3057-3061] [CONTEXT]
**Higher Svātantrika (Rang rgyud gong ma ba)**: Also called "non-abiding Svātantrika" or "Prāsaṅgika-like Svātantrika." Associated with later Indian masters like Jñānaśrībhadra and some Tibetan interpreters. This school:
- Does not even abide in the illusion-like ultimate
- Refutes all positions including conventional establishments
- Is closer to Prāsaṅgika while still using svātantrika methods

[3059] [CONTEXT] **Son of a Barren Woman (mo gsham gyi bu)**: This is the classical Indian philosophical example of absolute impossibility. In the *Pramāṇavārttika*, Dharmakīrti uses this to illustrate that if the cause doesn't exist, the effect cannot exist. Here it's applied: if objects and aspects don't exist, the self-cognizing awareness that cognizes their absence also cannot be established.

[3059-3061] [PHILOLOGY]
**yul dang rnam pa med pas de med par myong ba'i so so rang rig kyang med pa ni / mo gsham gyi bu med pas de 'jal byed kyi shes pa med pa bzhin no**
- **mo gsham gyi bu**: Son of a barren woman (vandhyā-putra) — classic example of absolute non-existence in Indian philosophy
- **med pas**: Because of not existing (causal)
- **bzhin no**: Just like — equative simile particle

[3059-3061] [CONCEPT]
**The Logic of Non-existence**: This is one of the most sophisticated arguments in Madhyamaka:

**The Argument**:
1. If there is no object (yul med pa), there can be no consciousness of the object's absence
2. Example: If there is no son of a barren woman, there can be no cognition of "this is not the son of a barren woman"
3. Therefore, the self-cognizing awareness that supposedly knows the absence of objects cannot exist

**What's Being Said**: You cannot have a cognition of "non-X" unless X at least has some conceptual or conventional status. Absolute non-existence cannot be cognized. This undermines the Cittamātra's self-cognizing awareness that knows the emptiness of objects.

[3060-3061] [PHILOLOGY]
**kun rdzob la bden par med pas don dam la gang yang mi gnas te / rmi lam sad pa'i dus na rta glang gi snang 'gags kyang / dang po med pas don la 'gag rgyur ma grub pa bzhin no**
- **kun rdzob**: Conventional, relative (saṃvṛti)
- **'gags**: Cessation, stopping
- **dang po**: Beginning, origin
- **don la**: Ultimately, in reality
- **'gag rgyur ma grub pa**: Not established as something to cease

[3060-3061] [CONCEPT]
**The Dream-Waking Analogy**: When you wake up, the dream stops. But ask yourself:

- Did the dream "go" somewhere?
- Is there a "place" where dream-horses dwell after waking?
- Was there a moment when the dream "ceased"?

The answer to all is "no." The dream never truly existed, so there's nothing to cease. This is how saṃsāra is — it appears, but since it never truly existed, Buddhahood is not the "cessation" of something real but the recognition of what was always the case.

[3061-3061] [CONTEXT]
**Dream Analogy**: When you wake from a dream, the dream appearances (horse, ox) cease. But since they never truly existed from the start (dang po med pas), there is no real cessation (don la 'gag rgyur ma grub pa). This illustrates the Prāsaṅgika view that saṃsāra is not truly something that needs to be "stopped"—it never truly existed.
