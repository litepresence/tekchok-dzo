Page 353: Bardo State Liberation (*bar do sgrol ba*)
**Analysis:** This page (lines 14738-14780) presents 
sequential exposition of bardo (*bar do*) liberation pathways. The structural 
architecture follows progressive temporal markers (*zhag gcig*, *zhag gnyis*, etc.) 
mapping faculties to liberation timeframes.

[14753-14766] [CONTEXT]
Doctrinal Framework
**Analysis:** This section participates in Nyingma doxographical discourse,
presenting the *Thal 'gyur* (Thalgyur) class teachings on spontaneous

Philosophical Integration

1. Bindu (*tshom bu*) appearance and cessation dynamics
2. Wisdom light (*ye shes 'od*) recognition as liberation trigger
3. Spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*) in post-death states
4. Temporal progression (*zhag grangs*) as pedagogical device
