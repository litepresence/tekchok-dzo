[3929-3949]
:**

*View Three Stages:*
1. Moving: Samsara dharmatā recognized like thief [3931]

- Established tenet not abiding, superior establishment
- Nature unobserved, completely pure
- Primordially pure dharmatā directionless arises

[3977-3988] [STRUCTURE]
Two Approaches to Error Reversal

**Analysis:** Lines 3977-3988 introduce two methods of reversing error/delusion (*'khrul pa*), followed by three detailed approaches.

**Initial Presentation:**

| Method | Tibetan | Mechanism | Lines |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| First | *'khrul pa gzhi la zlog pa'i tshul du gsungs pa* | Reversing delusion to ground | 3977 |
| Second | *thig le rang gnad la phab te gsungs pa* | Placing thigle at its own crucial point | 3978 |

**Note:** Line 3979 begins detailed exposition of the first method — cutting the root of delusion.

[3979-3992] [PHILOLOGY]
Three Error Reversal Systems

**Analysis:** Lines 3979-3992 present the detailed terminology of three approaches to reversing fundamental ignorance.

**First Approach: Root Cut (*rtsad gcod*)

[3979-3992]
:**

**Essence

[3979-3981]
:**
- Delusion root = non-awareness (*ma rig pa*)
- Basis of three realm samsara (*khams gsum 'khor ba'i gzhi*)
- When driven to self = ignorance cut at root (*ma rig pa rtsad bcad*)
- Called: self-awareness (*rang rig pa*)

**Key Term:** *rtsad bcad* — "cut at root" — definitive severing, not gradual elimination.

**Nature Analysis

[3982-3983]
:**
- Nature arises variously (*rang bzhin sna tshogs su byung bas*)
- Therefore causal-conditional searching (*rgyu rkyen gyi ba ded pa*)
- Object's vital point cut (*dmigs pa'i gdar sha chod*)
- Samsara's delusion basis exhausted (*'khor ba 'khrul pa'i ltos zad*)
- Result: causeless-empty primordial purity (*rgyu med stong par ye dag pa*)

**Second Approach: Self-Liberated Placing

[3985-3988]
:**
- Delusion root cut, samsara-nirvana view reverse
- Delusion self-liberated placing, non-deluded dharmatā recognize
- Delusion basis confidence, delusion-wheel continuum severed

[3993-3993]
:**

| Aspect | Tibetan | Function |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Essence | *dang po 'khrul ma myong bas ma rig pa'i rgyud dag* | First not experienced delusion, ignorance continuum pure |
| Present | *da lta 'khrul pa la mi gnas pa* | Now not abiding in delusion |
| Future | *phyis 'khrul mi srid pa* | Future delusion impossible |
| Nature | *rang bzhin la dbyer med pas 'khor 'das gzhi gcig* | Without difference, samsara-nirvana ground one |

**Third Approach: Basis Confidence
