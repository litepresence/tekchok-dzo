[4401-4403] [STRUCTURE]
Textual Architecture and Sectional Organization
**Analysis:** The passage at lines 4393-4403 demonstrates the systematic presentation characteristic of Longchenpa's expository style. The structural markers (*rim pa*, *dbye ba*) indicate a graduated pedagogical approach, while the citation formulas (*zhes so*, *de las gsungs pa*) establish textual authority through tantric source validation. The section follows standard Nyingma doxographical conventions.

[4404-4405] [PHILOLOGY]
Terminological and Grammatical Analysis
**Analysis:** Key technical terms in this section require philological precision. The instrumental particles (*-kyis*, *-gis*) function variously as agency markers and means indicators. Causative constructions (*byed pa*) establish operational relationships between practices and results. Compound terminology follows standard Tibetan tantric conventions with occasional unique Dzogchen semantic extensions.
