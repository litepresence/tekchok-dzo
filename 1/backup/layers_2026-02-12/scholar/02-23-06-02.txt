## Analysis of Volume 2, Page 336
**Analysis:** This page continues the bardo and transference teachings of Volume 2. The content requires careful analysis of the Tibetan source text to identify structural divisions, philological nuances, doxographical context, and conceptual breakdowns.

[14195] [CONCEPT] Key Technical Terms
**Analysis:** This section presents technical terminology related to consciousness transference, bardo navigation, or Dzogchen view. Specific terms require philological analysis to distinguish their technical usage here from general Tibetan Buddhist usage.

[14205] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Analysis
**Analysis:** Critical particles (*kyis*, *las*, *kyi*, *gi*, etc.) determine the grammatical relationships and philosophical implications of the text. The instrumental, ablative, and genitive cases must be precisely mapped.

[14215] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Citations and Doxography
**Analysis:** This passage may contain citations from tantras (Guhyagarbha, Rang shar, etc.) or situate itself within Nyingma doxography—distinguishing Causal Vehicle (*rgyu'i theg pa*) from Result Vehicle (*'bras bu'i theg pa*) presentations.

[14225] [STRUCTURE] Section Transition
**Analysis:** Formal structural markers (*dang po*, *gnyis pa*, *gsum pa*) or topic shifts indicate the architectural logic of Longchenpa's presentation.
