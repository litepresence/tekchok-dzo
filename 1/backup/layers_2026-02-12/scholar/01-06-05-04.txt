Guhyasamaja and Three Vajra System

The three syllable generation follows Guhyasamaja (gsang ba 'dus pa) architecture:
- OM generates vajra body (sku rdo rje)
- AH generates vajra speech (gsung rdo rje)
- HUM generates vajra mind (thugs rdo rje)

This corresponds to the three mysteries (gsang ba gsum) of body, speech, and mind, and their purification into three vajras.

Causative Constructions and Instrumental Chains

The syllable generation employs causative morphology:
- "Bskyed pa" (causes to arise): Causative of skyed
- "Byas pa" (causes to become): Causative of gyur
- "Sbyar ba" (causes to join): Causative of 'phrod

The instrumental chain: "om gyis rdo rjer bskyed pa ni" (by means of OM, producing vajra). The emphatic "ni" marks result.

Guhyasamaja Three Vajra System

The syllable generation follows Guhyasamaja:
- OM: Sku rdo rje (vajra body) at rtsa ba (root)
- AH: Gsung rdo rje (vajra speech) at rked pa (waist)
- HUM: Thugs rdo rje (vajra mind) at rtsa mo (tip)

This creates sku gsum (three kayas) in the subtle body vajra.

Animal Posture Terminology

The postures employ animal metaphor vocabulary:
- "Stag mo'i 'gyur stangs" (tigress posture): Vigorous containment
- "Seng ge'i 'gying tshugs" (lion posture): Majestic stability
- "'Jag ma'i 'phyur stangs" (jackal posture): Flexible adaptation
- "Rtsa gnad kyi 'khor lo" (channel essential wheel): Complete rotation

The particle "ni" defines function: "stag mo ni bshang lam drag tu bsdams pas" (the tigress [posture] forcefully restrains the lower gate). The causative "skyed" indicates generation.
