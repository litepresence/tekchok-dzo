Introduction to Four Topics: Continuous Yoga

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Transition to four topics: (1) four continuous yogas (*rnal 'byor bzhi goms pa'i tshul*), (2) cutting deviations (*gol sa bcad tshul*), (3) gateway appearances (*sgo la snang tshul*), (4) temporal determination (*dus tshad ngos pa'i man ngag*).

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *rnal 'byor bzhi* (four yogas), *gol sa* (deviation/error), *sgo la snang tshul* (gateway appearance manner), *dus tshad* (temporal measure), *man ngag* (esoteric instruction).

- **[CONCEPT]** First topic: four continuous yogas:
  - View: looking with unmoving eye at vajra-intertwined.
  - Meditation: meditating without distraction in that state.
  - Conduct: conducting at vajra-intertwined appearance.
  - Result: expanse-awareness stability.

The Continuous Yoga Citation from Nor bu 'phra bkod

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Extended citation from *Nor bu 'phra bkod* establishing the practice of continuous yoga through the vajra-intertwined body.

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *lu gu rgyud* (vajra-intertwined), *mig gi mi 'gul* (eye unmoving), *ma yengs par* (without distraction), *chos can snang ba grangs med* (countless appearing dharmas), *chos nyid don la gcig las med* (nature meaning not one-from), *lta ba rgyun gyi rnal 'byor* (continuous view-yoga), *'gyur med lta* (changeless view), *dus bzhi* (four times), *rang rig bsgom pa'i rgyun med* (self-awareness meditation's continuum without).

- **[CONCEPT]** The citation presents:
  - View's meaning is vajra-intertwined.
  - Though dharmas appear countless, nature's meaning is not one-from-many.
  - Continuous view-yoga: changeless view of that meaning.
  - Vajra-intertwined body: appears directly, difficult to grasp.
  - Awareness's entity: ceaseless penetration resides.
  - Example: like planets and stars arising from clear ocean.
  - Not time of latent hatred: various great penetration resides.
  - Continuous view-yoga: not distracted from that meaning.
  - No latent hatred or non-hatred; day appearance and night cessation not-two appearing.
  - Continuous conduct-yoga: not separated from vajra-intertwined's entity at four times.
  - Though self-awareness meditation continuum not existent, meditation continuous yoga arises.
  - At all times and non-times: not separated from vajra-intertwined = meditation continuous yoga.

Recognition of Deviations: Three Deviations for Each Yoga

**Analysis:**
- **[STRUCTURE]** Second topic: recognition of deviations (*gol sa ngos gzung*). Three deviations for each of the three yogas (view, conduct, meditation).

- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *gol sa rnam pa gsum* (three deviations), *stong pa nyid* (emptiness), *gzugs med skye mched mu bzhi* (formless sense-bases four like space), *dngos po nyid* (thing-ness), *gzugs khams gnas ris bcu bdun* (seventeen form realm stations), *bems po* (material), *rtag pa* (permanent), *chags pa chen po* (great attachment), *smyon pa* (madman), *lha ma yin* (demigod), *don med tshig rengs* (meaningless stiff words), *'jig tshogs lta* (view of perishing aggregate), *lung ma bstan* (unrevealed/neutral), *btang snyoms bdag med* (equanimity selfless), *lteng nas mun snang* (dullness darkness appearance), *ting 'dzin yig 'bru* (absorption seed syllable), *mi rtog stong pa* (non-conceptual emptiness), *chad pa mu med* (unlimited nihilism).

- **[CONCEPT]** Three deviations for each:
  
  **View deviations:**
  1. Looking at emptiness → deviation into four formless sense-bases.
  2. Looking at thing-ness → deviation into seventeen form realm stations and materiality.
  3. Looking at permanence at vajra-intertwined appearance → bound by great attachment → deviation into six migrations.
  
  **Conduct deviations:**
  1. Conducting like madman at all appearances → deviation into demigod.
  2. Conducting meaningless stiff words → deviation into perishing-aggregate view.
  3. Conducting like child at six sense-objects → deviation into unrevealed state.
  
  **Meditation deviations:**
  1. Meditating equanimity selfless → deviation into dull darkness appearance.
  2. Meditating absorption seed-syllable → deviation into samsara through attachment.
  3. Meditating non-conceptual emptiness → deviation into unlimited nihilism.

Essential Point: No Deviations in the Vajra-Intertwined

**Analysis:**
- **[PHILOLOGY]** Technical terminology: *gol ba'i rgyu ni bsam yas* (deviation's causes are countless), *gol sa chen po de las med* (no great deviation from that), *lam pa'i rgyud la gol bar snang* (appear to deviate on path continuum), *don la gol sa gcig kyang med* (no deviation at all in meaning), *rgyu dang 'bras bur btags pa* (labeled as cause and result).

- **[CONCEPT]** Crucial point: Though deviation causes are countless, there is no great deviation from the vajra-intertwined itself. On the path-continuum, deviations appear; in actual meaning, no deviation exists at all. Cause and result are merely labeled; spoken to cut deviations.
