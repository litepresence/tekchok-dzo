[8675-8675] [CONCEPT]
Upper-Lower Integration and Power Generation

The posture creates integration through:
1. Lower contraction (smad bskums):
   - Activates lower gates
   - Seals energetic leaks
   - Generates ascending wind

2. Upper expansion (stod gseng):
   - Opens heart center
   - Releases constriction
   - Allows descending clarity

3. Unified effect:
   - Lus stobs rgyas (body power expands)
   - Byang sems rgyas (bodhicitta expands)
   - Las bag chags 'brel chod (karma-latency connection severs)
