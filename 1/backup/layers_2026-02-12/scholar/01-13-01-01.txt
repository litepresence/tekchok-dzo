# SA BCAD: Enumeration of the Four Lamps
**Analysis:** This section marks the transitional enumeration (*sa bcad*) of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) in the *thod rgal* exposition. Longchenpa lists the four lamps following the completion of the Three Movements of Mind-Turning in the preceding section. This structural placement reflects the Dzogchen architectural principle that *thod rgal* practice presupposes preliminary mind-turning.

[16259] [PHILOLOGY] The term *so so'i* (each/particular) functions as a distributive marker, indicating that each lamp will receive individual treatment. The particle *la* with the verb *bshad* (explain) establishes the locative sense: "in explaining the detailed nature of each."

[16260-16263] [CONCEPT]
The Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*):
1. *rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma* — Water Lamp of Far-Casting (holds both samsara and nirvana appearances)
2. *thig le stong pa'i sgron ma* — Lamp of Empty Bindus
3. *dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma* — Lamp of Completely Pure Sphere
4. *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma* — Lamp of Self-Arising Wisdom

Longchenpa here introduces the foundational *thod rgal* terminology following the *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Pradīpodyotana*) tantric tradition.

# Architectural Scheme of the Water Lamp Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes a ninefold analytical framework (*dgu*) for the Water Lamp:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*)
2. Definition (*nges tshig*)
3. Classification (*dbye ba*)
4. Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*)
5. Abode (*gnas*)
6. Manner of arising (*gang gis skyed tshul*)
7. Appearance of arising door (*'char sgo'i snang ba*)
8. Simile (*mthun dpe*)
9. Definite measure (*tshad nges pa*)

This ninefold schema reflects the *mdzod* genre's encyclopedic impulse and mirrors structural patterns found in Longchenpa's *Yid bzhin mdzod*.
