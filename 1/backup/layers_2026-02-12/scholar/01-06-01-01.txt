Vessel Analogy

Bad vessel cannot hold good essence—like lion's milk cannot be held in clay vessel. If poured, Dharma's greatness deteriorates and that bad vessel goes to lower realms. Therefore secrets must be kept from such bad vessels.

From *De nyid*:
"Essence of Great Perfection instructions
Don't pour into bad vessels generally
If poured into bad vessels
Both essence and vessel destroyed
Therefore keep from inferior intellects"

[6899-6950] [CONTEXT]

[6934-6950] [CONTEXT]
Dream Signs and Accomplishment Marks

During this time, with intense aspiration thinking "Must obtain whatever desired empowerment, etc.":
- Dreams of teaching Dharma
- Dreams of giving prophecies
- Signs of accomplished guru certainly arise

Definite result of this method:
Through previous supplication and serving guru, all desired aims accomplished like wish-fulfilling jewel and wish-fulfilling tree.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"From that serving, qualities
Wish-fulfilling tree and mind jewel
Like cow of desires
Immeasurable qualities obtained
Aiming at that, serve guru
To turn from cyclic existence battle"

[6941-6985] [STRUCTURE]
Empowerment Benefits and Prerequisites

[6941-6976]
**Certain Result of Proper Supplication:**
When preliminary supplication (*smon lam*) and service are performed properly with yearning to obtain empowerment, signs of accomplished guru appear in dreams:
- Explaining Dharma (*chos 'chad pa*)

Faults of Not Receiving Empowerment

From *Sgyu 'phrul gsang snying*:
"Not pleasing guru
Not obtaining empowerments
Listening, etc., beginning endeavors
Fruitless and lost"

From *Dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud*:
"Secret mantra without depending on empowerment, accomplishment won't occur
Like one without hand-ears
Cannot cross to river's other side"

From *Rang shar* comprehensive enumeration:
"Faults of not obtaining empowerment thus:
In bardo, wandering
Fear
Obstruction
Hindrance
Consciousness lost
Until karmic body not abandoned
Not seen as worthy of honor by beings
Little merit
Short life
Few enjoyments of livelihood
Narrow mouth
Many obstacles occur
All activities unaccomplished
This is fault of secret mantra practitioner not obtaining empowerment
Secret mantra practitioner should obtain empowerment
Without obtaining, even Buddha cannot turn Dharma wheel at Tathāgata level
Without turning wheel, compassion's emanation body cannot benefit beings
Therefore secret mantra practitioner should obtain empowerment"

[7012-7039]
**Faults of Not Receiving Empowerment:**
From *Sgyu 'phrul gsang snying*:
"Not pleasing guru
Not obtaining empowerments
Listening, etc., beginning endeavors
Fruitless and lost"

From *Dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud*:
"Without depending on secret mantra empowerment, accomplishment won't occur
Like one without hand-ears
Cannot cross to river's other side"

From *Rang shar*:
"Faults of not obtaining empowerment thus:
In bardo, wandering
Fear
Obstruction
Hindrance
Consciousness lost
Until impregnated karmic body not abandoned
Not seen as worthy of honor by beings
Little merit
Short life
Few enjoyments
Narrow mouth
Many obstacles occur
All activities unaccomplished
This is fault of secret mantra practitioner not obtaining empowerment"

Without empowerment, even Buddha cannot turn Dharma wheel at Tathāgata level; without turning wheel, compassion's emanation body cannot benefit beings.

[7024-7087] [CONTEXT]
Defects of Not Receiving Empowerment

**From *Rang shar*:**
Without empowerment:
- Bewilderment in bardo (*bar do la bred pa*)
- Fear (*spangs pa*)
- Terror (*rdugs pa*)
- Obstructions (*thogs pa*)
- Loss of perception (*'du shes shor ba*)

Until leaving the karmic body (*bag chags kyi lus*), one is:
- Not regarded as venerable by beings (*'gro ba rnams kyis bkur ba'i 'os su mi mthong*)
- Little merit (*bsod nams chung*)
- Short life (*tshe thung*)
- Few enjoyments (*'tsho ba'i longs spyod nyung*)
- Narrow mouth (*kha nyen*)
- Many obstacles (*bar chad mang po*)
- No accomplishment in activities (*bya ba thams cad mi 'grub*)

**From *Dbang rdzogs pa rang byung chen po'i rgyud*:**
"Without relying on Secret Mantra empowerment, accomplishment is impossible. Like a boatman without hands cannot ferry across the river."

**Critical Point:**
Without empowerment, even a Buddha cannot turn the Dharma wheel (*chos kyi 'khor lo bskor*) at the Tathāgata level, and without turning the wheel, compassionate emanation cannot benefit beings.

[7040-7057]
**Location for Empowerment:**
Isolated, delightful, near accomplishment places. Generally auspicious with good earth-examination, good forests, etc.

Specific locations:
- With elaboration: student's body-element—south-facing if earth, east-facing if water, west-facing if fire, north-facing if wind
- Without elaboration: thick forest, charnel ground, mountain ravine according to student's element
- Greatly without elaboration: excellent is peak of mountain where three valleys meet
- Utterly without elaboration: extremely isolated or hermitage—one *rgyang grags* from village

All four empowerment places: others fear, wild beasts dwell, poisonous snakes, charnel grounds, *spyang gi*—excellent charnel ground with very fierce ḍākinīs.

[7040-7057] [PHILOLOGY]
Empowerment Location Classifications

**Location Types:**
Isolated, delightful, near accomplishment places.

General location: Auspicious with good earth-examination, good forests, etc.

Four specific location categories:
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): Student's body element
   - Earth: south-facing, north protected
   - Water: east-facing, west protected
   - Fire: west-facing, east protected
   - Wind: north-facing, south protected

2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): Thick forest interior, mountain ravine matching student's element form and characteristics

3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): Peak of mountain where three valleys meet—excellent

4. **Utterly without elaboration** (*rab tu spras med*): Extremely isolated or charnel ground—one *rgyang grags* from village

All four empowerment locations:
- Where other beings fear
- Wild fierce beasts dwell
- Poisonous snakes
- Charnel grounds, *spyang gi*, etc.

Excellent charnel ground with extremely fierce ḍākinīs is supreme.

[7058-7086] [CONTEXT]
Location Characteristics from Tantras

From *Rdzogs pa rang byung*:
"This supreme empowerment shown
In great village's center
Yogin purpose not accomplished
Village and city's end
Forest or mountain rock empty valley
Yogin enters empowerment meaning"

And:
"Very isolated and delightful place
Examine location's characteristics
End of extensive village
Fruitful forest place
Various flowers born
West high, east facing
North protected, similar
South extensive, similar place
From self clear direction
Without holes and gaps
Without form in front
Without being-like form
Back leaning on rock
Sides various fruit trees blazing
Front river and pure water flowing
Or like life-sustaining place
Mountain ranges not completely cut
Various bird sounds proclaim"

[7087-7098] [CONCEPT]
Empowerment Timing Classification

Two aspects:
1. Generally explained
2. Specifically explained

**General:** When guru grants and dependent connections gather—auspicious time.

**Specific excellent time:**
- Autumn: bodhi fruit ripens
- Spring: liberation's seed planted
- Monkey year: auspicious
- Waxing eighth day: good
- Star *rgyal mchog*: good
- Planet Jupiter: good

From *De nyid*:
"Mouse, Dragon, Horse, Pig
Especially years, four
Empowerment ritual accomplished
Months, four first
For perfect fruit result, accomplished
Day count waxing from one
To moon full juncture
Confer time midday or midnight
Yogin body's particularities
Individual element year match
Empowerment ritual auspiciously becomes
This time commitment-holding student
Elements' bodies harmonious
Number immeasurable as measure
Hundred or fifty, etc.
Elements harmonious, no contradiction
If entering ritual
Lamp facing not matching
Commitment replenishing ritual do
If no fault, siddhi
Again and again take
Meaningless death, obstacles arise
Empowerment completion, strongly endeavor
If assembled relative sick
Body disease arisen
Mudrā and circumambulation do
Speech stammering, confusion
Think, recite hundred syllables
Mind hungry or memory lost
Enter generation and completion stage"

[7088-7098] [CONCEPT]
Places, Times, and Auspicious Connections

**Empowerment Locations:**
Four categories based on empowerment type:
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): Directions based on student's element
   - Earth: south-facing, protected north
   - Water: east-facing, protected west  
   - Fire: west-facing, protected east
   - Wind: north-facing, protected south

2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): Dense forest interiors matching student's element shapes and signs

3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): Confluence of three valleys at mountain peak ridge

4. **Utterly without elaboration** (*rab tu spras med*): Complete solitude (*rab tu dben pa*), hermitage one *rgyang grags* (distance of arrow-flight sound) from village

**General Requirements:**
All locations should have:
- Fierce creatures (*gcang gzan ma rungs pa*)
- Poisonous snakes (*sbrul gdug pa*)
- Charnel grounds (*dur khrod*)
- Violent ḍākinīs (*mkha' 'gro ma rab tu mi bsrung*)

Quoting *Rdzogs pa rang byung*:
"In great cities' centers, yogins cannot accomplish purpose. In villages and towns' border areas, forests or rocky valleys, yogins enter empowerment's meaning."

**Specific Site Characteristics:**
- West-facing, high in east
- South low like north
- Self's perceptual direction east
- No holes or sand
- No forms before
- No sentient-like appearances
- Back to rocks
- Fruit trees on sides
- Water flowing before
- Or like life-sustaining site (*tshe zan*)
- Complete mountain ranges
- Various bird calls
