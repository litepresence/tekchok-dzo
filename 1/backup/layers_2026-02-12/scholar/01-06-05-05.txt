Sequential and Simultaneous Practice Modes

The text presents two modes of thigle refinement:
1. Rim gyis (gradual/sequential): Moving from root (rtsa ba) to waist (rked pa) to tip (rtsa mo)
2. Cig car (simultaneous): All three locations at once

The gradual path develops stability; the simultaneous path requires advanced capacity. Both lead to the four mudras culminating in Great Mudra (phyag rgya chen po).

Guhyasamaja and Three Vajra Architecture

The three syllables follow Guhyasamaja Tantra structure:
- OM: Sku rdo rje (vajra body) - purification of physical karma
- AH: Gsung rdo rje (vajra speech) - purification of verbal karma
- HUM: Thugs rdo rje (vajra mind) - purification of mental karma

This corresponds to the gsang ba gsum (three secrets) of body, speech, and mind.
