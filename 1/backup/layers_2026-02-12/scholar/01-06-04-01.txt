Wisdom Gnosis Empowerment Categories

[8112-8143]
**Accomplished Guru Distinction:**
Accomplished gurus can complete empowerment with single isolated piece or lump—whatever is said is accomplished.
Unaccomplished gurus must combine all and confer to accomplish meaning.

**Empowerment Four Classification:**
1. Vase empowerment (*bum dbang*): colored powder maṇḍala, deities, vase, student preparation, auspicious eight substances, royal seven, peaceful/wrathful *cakrā*/image/statue, vajra name, command sign (*bka' rtags*), seal empowerment (*phyag rgya*), action completion
2. Secret empowerment (*gsang dbang*): giving two bodhicittas
3. Wisdom-gnosis empowerment (*shes rab ye shes*): attachment-free seal visualization, merely recognizing seal, attachment-possessing actual consort activity
4. Word empowerment (*tshig dbang*): realization wisdom, view, meditation, awareness

Physical Characteristics of the Four Families (Rigs Bzhi)

This section initiates the completion stage (rdzogs rim) presentation of inner tantra, specifically focusing on the examination of suitable consorts (gzhung ma) for secret mantra practice. The structure follows the traditional four-fold classification of families (rigs bzhi): Padma (lotus), Dung can (conch), Ri mo can (lined/marked), and Har ti. Each family exhibits distinct physical characteristics indicating karmic affinity with specific tantric attainments.

[8312-8317] [PHILOLOGY]
Color Terminology and Particle Analysis

The text employs precise chromatic terminology: ser (yellow), dmar (red), sngo (blue), and dkar (white). The particle construction "las thal drags pa ma yin par" (not extremely beyond/from) uses las as ablative particle indicating distinction from the extremes mentioned. The phrase "gtsa bo'i rigs nges par 'grub pa" employs nges par (definitely/certainly) as adverbial intensifier with 'grub pa (to be established/accomplished), establishing definitive classification through physical signs.

[8318-8341] [CONTEXT]
Guhyagarbha Tantra and Family Classifications

The presentation of four families derives primarily from the Guhyagarbha Tantra (gsang ba snying po), the root text of Mahayoga. The four families correspond to the four Buddha families (rigs bzhi):
- Padma family: Amitabha, lotus characteristics
- Dung can family: Vairocana, conch/white characteristics  
- Ri mo can family: Akshobhya, marked/vajra characteristics
- Har ti family: Amoghasiddhi, action/-green characteristics

The verse citation "dkar ba ma yin gnag min zhing" appears in the Thalgyur root text, establishing the non-dual coloration beyond extremes.

[8336-8385] [PHILOLOGY]

Har Ti Family and Methodology of Attainment

This section completes the presentation of the four families (rigs bzhi) with emphasis on the Har ti family characteristics and the four methods of attainment (sbyar bas 'grub, bsten pas 'grub, bsam pas 'grub, mthong bas 'grub). The structural progression moves from physical description to practical application.

[8390-8406] [PHILOLOGY]
Descriptive Particles and Body Terminology

The Har ti description employs precise anatomical terminology:
- "Byad" (physique/proportions): Root term for bodily form
- "Dkyus" (length/proportion): Linear measurement
- "Rked skabs" (waist interval): Specific anatomical landmark
- "Snying mthams" (between eyebrows): Ajna chakra location

The particle "ni" serves definitive function: "'di ni bde ba ster bas padma can zhes bshad do" (this is explained as lotus-holder because it bestows bliss). The emphatic "yang dag 'dod" (properly accepted) establishes authoritative classification.

[8398-8421] [PHILOLOGY]
Technical Terminology of Consort Qualities

Key terms for consort evaluation:
- "Gzhung ma" (consort/wisdom mudra): Root meaning "holder" indicating one who holds wisdom
- "Sbyar ba" (union/joining): Technical term for ritual union
- "Bsten pa" (reliance/practice): Indicates ongoing supportive relationship
- "Mthong ba" (seeing): Initial visual contact establishing connection

The particle "gis" appears throughout as instrumental marker: "bsten pa'i stobs kyis 'grub" (accomplished through power of reliance), establishing causal relationships between practice methods and results.

[8400-8472] [CONTEXT]
Consort Acquisition Methods

**Four Accomplishment Modes:**
1. **Connection** (*sbyar bas 'grub*): Line-marked
2. **Attendance** (*bsten pas 'grub*): Conch
3. **Contemplation** (*bsam pas 'grub*): Lotus

Bodhicitta Expansion and Five Family Channels

This section presents methods for expanding bodhicitta (byang chub kyi sems rgyas pa) and the channel characteristics of the five families. The structure follows alchemical preparation to subtle body application, establishing the connection between physical substances and energetic transformation.

[8435-8443] [PHILOLOGY]
Ritual Substance Terminology

The text employs specialized alchemical vocabulary:
- "Lug thug" (sheep intestine): Container for preparations
- "Bye'u rgya mchil" (sparrow tongue): Ingredient indicating speed/penetration
- "Dbyid" (barley): Base substance for fermentation
- "Bu ram" (molasses): Binding and sweetening agent
- "Tsha gong" (fever/feverishness): Heat of transformation

The particle "kyang" (also/even) appears in concessive function: "ri lu kyang rgyas par byed do" (even pills cause expansion). The instrumental "gis" marks preparation method.

[8437-8452] [CONCEPT]
Five-fold Classification of Channel Characteristics

The section introduces five family channels (rigs can lnga) with length variations:
- Ring ba (long): Extended pleasure, external generation
- Thung ba (short): Brief pleasure, immediate intensity
- 'Bring po (medium): Balanced, similar to taste experience

This classification relates to the five pranas (srog 'dzin, gyen rgyu, khyab byed, me dang mnyam, thur sel) and their respective channels.

[8437-8466] [CONCEPT]
Karmic Correspondence Theory

The four attainment methods operate through different karmic mechanisms:
- Sbyar ba (joining): Direct energetic union
- Bsten pa (reliance): Cumulative karmic connection
- Bsam pa (contemplation): Mental causation
- Mthong ba (seeing): Visual imprint

The hierarchy suggests that physical union yields highest results (dngos grub rab), reliance produces medium (dngos grub 'bring), and mental/seeing methods yield lesser results, though all serve as supports for each other.

Rasayana and Tantric Alchemy

The substances listed integrate:
- Traditional Tibetan medicine (sman): ram nye (costus root), mu zi (nutmeg)
- Ayurvedic rasayana: ldong ros (aloe), chang (fermented alcohol)
- Tantric power substances: Bya substances for vitality enhancement

These preparations follow the Tibetan medical principle of bdud rtsi (amrita/nectar) production through combination of ingredients with specific potencies (nus pa).

[8453-8472]
Presentation of methods for expanding bodhicitta (byang chub kyi sems rgyas pa) through:

- Substances: lug thug gi tshang ra (sheep intestine), bye'u rgya mchil (sparrow tongue), dbyid (barley), bu ram (molasses)
- Medicinal preparations: ram nye, mu zi, ldong ros with chang (alcohol)

[8467-8492] [PHILOLOGY]
Comparative Adjectives and Length Terminology

The five family channel classification employs comparative morphology:
- "Ring ba" (long): Superlative length
- "Thung ba" (short): Minimal length
- "'Bring po" (medium): Intermediate position

The particle "ni" appears as topicalizer: "ring ba ni bde ba kha sra la phyir nas" (as for long, [it produces] external superior bliss). The causal construction "las...skye" (arises from) establishes physiological causation.

[8467-8492] [CONCEPT]
Five-fold Energy Configuration

The five family channels correspond to:
- Long (ring ba): Extended subtle energy, Vairocana/Padma affinity
- Short (thung ba): Concentrated bursts, Akshobhya/Vajra affinity  
- Medium ('bring po): Balanced flow, Ratna family
- Configuration affects: Duration, intensity, and wisdom aspect activated

This typology maps onto the five elements (byung ba lnga) and their respective channels in the subtle body.

1. Lamb-throat composition (*lug thug gi tshang ra*)
2. Sparrow beak meat (*bye'u rgya mchil gyi sha*)
3. *Dbyid*
4. Molasses
5. Mix and eat seven pellets—expands

Or: *Ram nye*, *mu zi*, *ldong ros* with beer, made into pills—also expands.

**Consort Training:**
Explain cause-effect Dharma
Teach saṃsāra/nirvāṇa bliss/suffering
Give empowerment, establish vows/commitments

**Bliss Generation Method:**
- Slowly heat sun
- Make naked, bathe with fragrant water
- Apply scent bindus to three places
- Touch, ear with fingernail
- Press thirteenth spine joint
- Embrace without actual union
- Kiss
- Urge with "sṛi" sound
- Bone ornaments on body
- Sing lotus songs
- Lotus pistil bindu network
- Also six other places with bindus

From *Snga ma*:
"Thus in uninhabited house, naked, without clothes, examine."

**Channel Search and Holding:**
Instructions for arousing channels:
- Breast pressing
- Throat bindu network with bodhicitta bindu
- Speaking *ha ha hi hi ho ho*
- Various bile bindus on head
- Sixth left rib pressing with ring finger

This causes all channels to arise.

**Holding Key Points:**
- Vajra tip: dog excrement, *jāti* powder, *sindhūra*
- Applied: channel cannot escape
- Visualize self as yab-yum deity, vajra-lotus union

From *Hevajra*:
"Vajra-lotus joined—bliss surpasses."

From *Snga ma*:
"Wisdom place—arouse channels

Bodhicitta Production and Bindu Refinement

**Bodhicitta Production Sequence:**
From *Dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*:
"From secret lotus place
Bodhicitta born upward
Secret vajra hole
Mix with bodhicitta"

Four stages:
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): Entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Supreme joy** (*mchog dga'*): Wisdom wind held
3. **Non-joy** (*dga' bral*): Thought-free, beyond joy/sorrow
4. **Co-emergent joy** (*lhan cig skyes pa'i dga' ba*): Bliss-emptiness inseparable

**Bindu Refinement Process:**
Five lineages' bodhicitta—refinement three times:
- First: channel mouth sealed, bliss generated
- Second: bindu held, channels expand
- Third: wisdom wind enters central channel

From *Sgyu 'phrul*:
"Bodhicitta bindu refinement
Supreme and common qualities
Whatever desired in mind
This certainly accomplishes"

**Channel Locations:**
- Root: Dharmakāya bliss
- Waist: Saṃbhogakāya bliss
- Tip: Nirmāṇakāya bliss

[8521-8546] [CONCEPT]
Pleasure Typology and Wisdom Correlation

The channel length correlates with pleasure characteristics:
- Long channels: Extended duration, external focus, Kriya/Upa affinity
- Short channels: Brief intensity, immediate gratification, Yoga affinity
- Medium channels: Balanced integration, Maha/Anu affinity

This typology corresponds to the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) and their progressive unfoldment through tantric practice.

[STRUCTURE] Four Postures of the Lion, Tiger, and Jackal

[8630-8671] [PHILOLOGY]
Refinement Signs and Benefits

**Refinement Benefits:**
- Channel expansion: diseases don't arise
- Wind expansion: samādhi arises
- Can walk without feet touching ground
- See body's atoms as vajra
- Fly in space
- Life equal to sun and moon
- Free from food/clothing attachment

Conventional bodhicitta benefits.

**Ultimate Bodhicitta Benefits:**
- Special transference (*'pho ba khyad par can*) practice
- Consciousness entering other's city

From *Dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud*:
"Refining bodhicitta bindu
Supreme and common qualities
Whatever desired in mind
This certainly accomplishes."

**Holding Measure:**
Bindu falling into bhaga but wind-power returning to mother's bindu—not escaping measure.

**Bliss Generation Sequence:**
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Sensation** (*tshor ba*): enjoying resultant after experience
3. **Bliss** (*bde ba*): mind and wisdom disturbed time
4. **Experience** (*myong ba*): mind and wisdom inseparable
5. **Emptiness** (*stong pa*): neither mind nor wisdom distinguished, transcending extremes and distinctions

From *Snga ma*:
"First joy alone
Second sensation, contact, experience
Third called bliss
Fourth experience co-emergent
Fifth called emptiness"

[8631-8660] [STRUCTURE]
Lion Posture and Karma-Latency Severance

This section presents the lion posture (seng ge'i 'gying tshugs) and its function in severing the connection between karma and latencies (las dang bag chags kyi 'brel chod). The structure moves from postural description to energetic effects, establishing the mechanism for liberating accumulated patterns.

[8631-8650] [PHILOLOGY]
Postural Mechanics and Severance Terminology

The text employs action-oriented vocabulary:
- "Smad bskums" (lower contraction): Root lock engagement
- "Stod gseng la bor" (upper thrown to space): Chest opening
- "Lus stobs rgyas" (body power expands): Strength development
- "Byang sems rgyas" (bodhicitta expands): Essence increase
- "'Brel chod" (connection severed): Karmic pattern interruption

The particle "ni" marks mechanism: "smad bskums la stod gseng la bor bas" (by contracting below and throwing above to space). The causative "rgyas" indicates expansion.

[8639-8668]
Presentation of the five stages of blissful wisdom (dga' ba'i ye shes):
1. Dang po dga' ba (initial joy) - entry wisdom
2. Gnyis pa tshor ba (second sensation) - experiential engagement
3. Gsum pa bde ba (third bliss) - mind-wisdom disturbance
4. Bzhi pa myong ba (fourth experience) - non-dual integration
5. Lnga pa stong pa (fifth emptiness) - beyond extremes

[8639-8668] [PHILOLOGY]
Perfective Aspect and Resultative Constructions

The text employs perfective markers:
- "Sbyangs pa" (having refined): Completed action
- "'Byongs pa" (having released): Perfective aspect
- "Thob pa" (attained): Resultative achievement

The construction "sbyangs pas...'byung" (having refined...arises) establishes causation. The particle "ni" marks attainment: "nang du sems 'byongs te" (mind is released internally).

[8643-8668] [CONTEXT]
Signs of Thigle Mastery

The indicators of accomplishment include:
- Rtsa 'byongs (channel release): No illness arises
- Rlung 'byongs (wind release): Ting nge 'dzin (samadhi) arises
- Thig le 'byongs (drop release): Extraordinary capacities

These correspond to:
- Las kyi phyag rgya: External accomplishment
- Dam tshig gi phyag rgya: Internal stabilization
- Phyag rgya chen po: Secret realization

[8647-8670] [CONCEPT]
Three-level Benefit System

The benefits manifest on three levels:
1. External (phyi): Physical transformation
   - Skra dkar gnyer ma med pa (no grey hair or wrinkles)
   - Gzhon zhing dar la bab pa (youthful radiance)
   - Tshe nyi zla dang mnyam (solar-lunar lifespan)

2. Internal (nang): Energetic mastery
   - Rtsa 'byongs (channel release)
   - Rlung 'byongs (wind release)
   - Thig le 'byongs (drop release)

3. Secret (gsang): Wisdom realization
   - Rnam rtog nub pa (cessation of conceptuality)
   - Bde ba lhun grub (spontaneously present bliss)
   - Sems gnas pa (mind stabilization)

[STRUCTURE] Postural Methods and Thigle Containment

[8651-8671] [CONTEXT]
Guhyasamaja and Three Vajra System

The three syllable generation follows Guhyasamaja (gsang ba 'dus pa) architecture:
- OM generates vajra body (sku rdo rje)
- AH generates vajra speech (gsung rdo rje)
- HUM generates vajra mind (thugs rdo rje)

This corresponds to the three mysteries (gsang ba gsum) of body, speech, and mind, and their purification into three vajras.

[8651-8671] [PHILOLOGY]
Causative Constructions and Instrumental Chains

The syllable generation employs causative morphology:
- "Bskyed pa" (causes to arise): Causative of skyed
- "Byas pa" (causes to become): Causative of gyur
- "Sbyar ba" (causes to join): Causative of 'phrod

The instrumental chain: "om gyis rdo rjer bskyed pa ni" (by means of OM, producing vajra). The emphatic "ni" marks result.

[8651-8671] [CONTEXT]
Guhyasamaja Three Vajra System

The syllable generation follows Guhyasamaja:
- OM: Sku rdo rje (vajra body) at rtsa ba (root)
- AH: Gsung rdo rje (vajra speech) at rked pa (waist)
- HUM: Thugs rdo rje (vajra mind) at rtsa mo (tip)

This creates sku gsum (three kayas) in the subtle body vajra.

[8651-8671] [PHILOLOGY]
Animal Posture Terminology

The postures employ animal metaphor vocabulary:
- "Stag mo'i 'gyur stangs" (tigress posture): Vigorous containment
- "Seng ge'i 'gying tshugs" (lion posture): Majestic stability
- "'Jag ma'i 'phyur stangs" (jackal posture): Flexible adaptation
- "Rtsa gnad kyi 'khor lo" (channel essential wheel): Complete rotation

The particle "ni" defines function: "stag mo ni bshang lam drag tu bsdams pas" (the tigress [posture] forcefully restrains the lower gate). The causative "skyed" indicates generation.

[8651-8671] [CONTEXT]
Six Yogas and Karma Purification

The posture derives from:
- Six Yogas of Naropa: Postural stability for karma purification
- Cakrasamvara: Lion posture in deity yoga
- Guhyagarbha: Integration into Nyingma system
- Dzogchen rushen: Preliminary practices for recognizing rigpa

The karma-latency connection refers to:
- Las (karma): Active deeds
- Bag chags (latencies): Subtle imprints
- 'Brel (connection): Binding mechanism
- Chod (sever): Liberation method

[8669-8671] [CONTEXT]
Bliss Generation Sequence and View Integration

**Four Seals:**
1. **Action seal** (*las kyi phyag rgya*): Outer body refinement, effortless four activities
2. **Commitment seal** (*dam tshig gi phyag rgya*): Waist refinement, stainless four wisdoms' commitment inseparable
3. **Dharma seal** (*chos kyi phyag rgya*): Tip refinement, enjoying general/specific characteristics
4. **Great seal** (*phyag rgya chen po*): Holding bindu itself—bliss-emptiness non-dual non-abiding

**Bliss Generation Sequence:**
1. **Joy** (*dga' ba*): entering wisdom, wind expansion/contraction
2. **Sensation** (*tshor ba*): enjoying resultant after experience
3. **Bliss** (*bde ba*): mind and wisdom disturbed time
4. **Experience** (*myong ba*): mind and wisdom inseparable
5. **Emptiness** (*stong pa*): neither mind nor wisdom distinguished, transcending extremes and distinctions

From *Snga ma*:
"First joy alone
Second sensation, contact, experience
Third called bliss
Fourth experience co-emergent
Fifth called emptiness"

**View Integration:**
Not time for actual consort method, root-generation—ordinary desire without mental fabrication. View-oscillation time: self-body dependent bliss generated without mental control.

Through actual body refinement, holding bodhicitta, refined/unrefined time—extraordinary bliss arises, experience not mixed with mental fabrication. Only knowing mind as mere emptiness. When ordinary conceptions absent in mind—obtained view time.

Refined bodhicitta arriving at holding measure—channels spread, body-mind non-dual great seal beyond mind experienced. View stabilization time: however done, power over bodhicitta, no change/transformation.

[8669-8671] [PHILOLOGY]
Temporal and Sequential Markers

The text employs sequential indicators:
- "De nas" (after that/then) - temporal progression
- "Dang po...gnyis pa...gsum pa" (first...second...third) - ordinal enumeration
- "De ltar" (in that manner) - methodological continuity

The particle "ni" appears as emphatic marker: "bde ba gang dang yang mi 'dra ba ni tshad yin no" (the measure is bliss unlike any other).

[8669-8671] [CONTEXT]
Signs of Accomplishment (Dngos Gyi Rtogs)

The indicators of successful thigle release include:
- External: Skra dkar (white hair) and gnyer ma (wrinkles) absent
- Internal: Rnam rtog nub pa (cessation of conceptuality)
- Secret: Bde ba lhun grub (spontaneously present bliss)

These correspond to the three kayas:
- External: Sprul sku (emanation body) sign
- Internal: Longs sku (enjoyment body) sign
- Secret: Chos sku (truth body) sign

[8669-8671] [CONCEPT]
Ordinary and Extraordinary Accomplishments

The two levels of thigle practice yield:
1. Kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems (conventional bodhicitta):
   - Rkang pa sa la ma reg par 'gro nus (walking without touching ground)
   - Lus kyi rdul phran zang thal du mthong (seeing body atoms)
   - Nam mkha' la 'phur bar nus (flying through sky)
   - Tshe nyi zla dang mnyam (lifespan like sun/moon)

2. Don dam pa byang chub kyi sems (ultimate bodhicitta):
   - 'Pho ba khyad par can (special transference)
   - Rnam shes gzhan gyi grong khyer 'jug (entering other consciousness)
   - 'Chi ba rang grol (self-liberated death)

[STRUCTURE] Five Stages of Blissful Wisdom

[8669-8671] [STRUCTURE]
Five Stages of Blissful Wisdom and View Stabilization

This section presents the five stages of blissful wisdom (dga' ba'i ye shes) and the stabilization of view (lta ba brtan pa) through body, speech, and mind integration. The structure progresses from sequential bliss stages to non-dual view recognition, establishing the culmination of completion stage practice.

[8669-8671] [PHILOLOGY]
Bliss Stage Enumeration and Temporal Markers

The five stages employ systematic enumeration:
- "Dang po" (first): Dga' ba (joy) - 'jug pa'i ye shes (entry wisdom)
- "Gnyis pa" (second): Tshor ba (sensation) - Myong ba'i dngos rjes (experiential trace)
- "Gsum pa" (third): Bde ba (bliss) - Sems dang ye shes 'khrug pa'i dus (mind-wisdom disturbance time)
- "Bzhi pa" (fourth): Myong ba (experience) - Dbyer mi byed pa (non-dual)
- "Lnga pa" (fifth): Stong pa (emptiness) - Mtha' gnyis las ma 'das pa (beyond extremes)

The particle "ni" marks definition: "dang po dga' ba ni 'jug pa'i ye shes" (first joy is entry wisdom). The temporal "dus" indicates stage transition.

[8671-8671] [PHILOLOGY]
Postural Imperatives and Substance Terms

The postures employ imperative and descriptive language:
- "Stag mo'i 'gyur stangs" (tigress posture): Forceful restraint
- "Seng ge'i 'gying tshugs" (lion posture): Majestic stability
- "'Jag ma'i 'phyur stangs" (jackal posture): Flexible shaking
- "Rtsa gnad kyi 'khor lo" (channel wheel): Complete rotation

The particle "ni" defines function: "stag mo ni bshang lam drag tu bsdams pas" (the tigress forcefully restrains the lower gate). The instrumental "kyis" indicates method.
