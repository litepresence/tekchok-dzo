Refutation of Objections: Two-Part Architecture
The text transitions to dispelling objections (rtsod pa spang ba), organized into two major divisions: (1) objections and responses regarding counting (grangs)—whether the ground is eightfold or not; (2) objections and responses regarding the nature itself (rang ngo). This architectural structure follows the standard Indian śāstra format of anticipating and answering objections (pūrvapakṣa-uttarapakṣa). The first subsection further divides into objection and response.

Debate Terminology
The term "rtsod pa" (debate, objection, vitaṇḍā) indicates formal philosophical dispute. The phrase "gzhi brgyad du thal" (would absurdly follow that ground is eightfold) employs thal (absurd consequence, prasaṅga) in the prasaṅgika mode. The particle "ces pa'i lan ni" introduces the response (lan, uttara). The term "'du ba" (aggregation, compilation) appears in "gzhi bdun 'du bas," referring to the sevenfold ground compilation. The phrase "log pa mi 'dod" (do not assert the opposite) employs log pa (opposite, reverse).

[10775-10781] [CONTEXT]
The Eight Grounds Controversy
The objection that ground would absurdly be eightfold (gzhi brgyad) references a specific doxographic controversy in Dzogchen metaphysics. Longchenpa's system typically presents seven grounds (gzhi bdun), including: dharmakāya ground, radiance ground, vajra chain ground, etc. The potential eighth ground would arise from treating ka dag and lhun grub as separate grounds rather than aspects of a single ground. The response clarifies that Longchenpa asserts their non-duality (dbyer med), maintaining the sevenfold schema without addition.

[10775-10781] [CONCEPT]
Non-Duality Preserves Enumeration
The philosophical subtlety here concerns how asserting the non-duality of primordial purity and spontaneous presence preserves the sevenfold ground structure. If ka dag and lhun grub were separate grounds, the enumeration would expand to eight. But since they are dual aspects (rnam pa gnyis) of a single ground—essence and nature—the sevenfold structure remains intact. This exemplifies the Mādhyamika principle that non-duality does not obliterate conventional distinctions.
