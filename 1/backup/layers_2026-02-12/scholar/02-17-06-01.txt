Terminological and Grammatical Analysis
**Analysis:** Key technical terms in this section require philological precision. The instrumental particles (*-kyis*, *-gis*) function variously as agency markers and means indicators. Causative constructions (*byed pa*) establish operational relationships between practices and results. Compound terminology follows standard Tibetan tantric conventions with occasional unique Dzogchen semantic extensions.

[2782-2796] [CONTEXT]
Tantric Source Citations and Doctrinal Lineage
**Analysis:** The passage cites authoritative tantric sources (*Thal 'gyur*, *Rang shar*, *Nyi zla kha sbyor*) to establish doctrinal validity. These citations reflect the Nyingma emphasis on *bka' ma* (oral tradition) sources and demonstrate Longchenpa's synthetic methodology. The *zhes so* citation formula indicates transmission lineage rather than creative composition.

[2792-2802] [STRUCTURE]
Textual Architecture and Sectional Organization
