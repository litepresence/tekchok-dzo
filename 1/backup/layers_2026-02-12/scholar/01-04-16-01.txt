[3838-3840] [STRUCTURE]
Free-from-Action Expanse

**Analysis:** Lines 3838-3840 present the fourth of the expanse categories (*klong*) — the Free-from-Action Expanse (*bya ba dang bral ba'i klong*).

**Expanse Classification to this Point:**

| # | Expanse | Tibetan | Characteristic | Lines |
|---|---------|---------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | Natural | *rang bzhin gyi klong* | Spontaneously present | Prior |
| 2 | Letter | *yi ge'i klong* | Word methodology | Prior |
| 3 | Meaning | *don gyi klong* | Essence beyond words | Prior |
| 4 | Free-from-Action | *bya ba dang bral ba'i klong* | Unfabricated liberation | 3838-3840 |

**Line 3838 Analysis:**
*bya ba dang bral ba'i klong ni ma byas rang grol ba'i chos nyid du grol bas na* — "The expanse free from action is liberated in the dharmatā of uncreated self-liberation..."

**Key Terms:**
- *bya ba* — action/doing (what is to be done)
- *bral ba* — free from/separated from
- *ma byas* — uncreated/unfabricated
- *rang grol* — self-liberated
- *chos nyid* — dharmatā/nature of phenomena

**Confirmation

[3839-3840]
:**
*bya ba med pas grol bas grol* — "Liberated through liberation without action"

This confirms that no deliberate effort (*bya ba*) is required for liberation in Atiyoga.

[3841-3850] [STRUCTURE]
Chapter Conclusion
**Analysis:** Lines 3841-3850 would mark the end of the vehicle classification chapter, preparing for the next major section on Dzogchen proper.

**Note:** This page (100) continues the detailed presentation of the Expanse Section (*klong sde*) of Atiyoga, specifically covering the "Black Expanse" (*klong nag po*) subsection and its three divisions (activity, compassion, emanation). The text then proceeds to enumerate the other three main expanse section divisions (variegated, white, vast) before transitioning to the Instruction Section (*man ngag sde*), the pinnacle of Atiyoga teachings.

[3841-3858] [PHILOLOGY]
Three Additional Expanses

**Analysis:** Lines 3841-3858 present three more expanse categories with their associated scriptural quotations.

**Ornament Expanse (*rgyan gyi klong*)

[3841-3846]
:**

| Element | Tibetan | Translation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Definition | *snang ba sems kyi rgyun yin la* | Appearances are mind's continuum |
| Nature | *sems stong pa ngos gzung dang bral ba* | Mind emptiness without reference-recognition |
| Name | *rgyan zhes bya* | Called "Ornament" |

**Quotation

[3845-3846]
:**
*mi skye mi 'gag cir mi dgongs* — "Unproduced, unceasing, not thinking anything"

**Play Expanse (*rol pa'i klong*)

[3847-3852]
:**

| Element | Tibetan | Translation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Definition | *yin phyogs med kyi rol pa 'gag med du shar bas* | Play without existence aspect, unceasingly arises |
| Nature | *snang sems la 'gyur ba med pa* | Appearance-mind without change |
| Name | *rol pa'i klong* | Play Expanse |

**Quotation

[3851-3852]
:**
*rnam dag lam chen kun sgrol phyir* — "Completely liberating great pure path"

**Dharmatā Expanse (*chos nyid kyi klong*)

[3853-3858]
:**

| Element | Tibetan | Translation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Definition | *ma bcos rang shar bzhag pas gang nas kyang ma yin la* | Unfabricated self-arisen placing, from nowhere |
| Nature | *stong nyid ma bcos pa'i gzhi yin pas* | Unfabricated emptiness ground |
| Result | *mthong shes gnyis su med pa* | Seeing-knowing non-dual |

**Quotation

[3857-3858]
:**
*stong ngo kun tu bzang las 'das* — "Emptiness transcends Samantabhadra"

**Philological Note:** The progression shows increasing subtlety: ornament (appearances), play (activity), dharmatā (ground).

[3859-3869] [CONTEXT]
Introduction to Instruction Section

**Analysis:** Lines 3859-3869 transition to the Instruction Section (*man ngag gi sde*), establishing its superiority through simile.

- Directly speaking path (*lam drang thad du smra ba*)

**Key Metaphor:**
*ngo bo gnad du 'gro ba gnad la thebs pa* — "Essence going to crucial point, striking crucial"

This metaphor (*me btsa'* — cauterization/fire-fang) indicates the immediate, penetrating nature of direct pointing-out instructions.

**Three Divisions

[3861-3864]
:**

| # | Tibetan | Translation | Characteristic |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | *kha 'thor ba'i tshul du gsungs pa* | Spoken in scattered manner | Disconnected points |
| 2 | *kha gtam pa'i tshul du gsungs pa* | Spoken as advice/discussion | Conversational |
| 3 | *rgyud rang gzhung gi tshul du bka' sts pa* | Spoken as tantra own-text | Authoritative |

**Scattered Essence Subdivisions

:**

| # | Tibetan | Function |
|---|---------|----------|

| 2 | *grol ba stobs dag pa'i lam mngon du gyur pa'i man ngag* | Liberation-force-pure path manifest instruction |
