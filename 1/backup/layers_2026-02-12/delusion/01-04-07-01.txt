[2983-2985] [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The 'result' of the Sravaka path—Arhatship—is understood as final extinction (nirvana with remainder) that represents a lower goal than Buddhahood.


WHY IT ARISES:
Mahayana superiority complex. The practitioner believes bigger goal = better. Compassion for all beings seems superior to personal liberation.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner looks down on Arhats as 'selfish' while lacking their actual attainment. Pride without substance.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The profound attainment of Sravaka path is dismissed. The practitioner criticizes what they have not understood.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]



ERROR TYPE 5:

[2986-2988] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The systematic presentation of vehicles suggests a curriculum where each must be studied in sequence before advancing, creating 'vehicle-completion' anxiety.


WHY IT ARISES:
Educational conditioning. The practitioner assumes structured progression. Fear of missing prerequisites.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner defers genuine recognition while working through vehicle-stages. The path becomes endless preparation.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Each vehicle becomes another box to check. Recognition is perpetually deferred until 'completion' of current vehicle.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PREPARATION PARALYSIS] and [PROGRESSION MYTH]
