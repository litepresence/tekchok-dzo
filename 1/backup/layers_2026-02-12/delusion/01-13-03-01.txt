[16483-16498] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [SENSE-PERCEPTION AS REALITY]
MISREADING:
Sense perceptions (dbang po, yul) accurately represent external reality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Naive realism default. Perceptions seem to reveal objects.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Taking perceptions as evidence of external reality.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reification of perceived objects.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[16499-16514] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [HOOK AS INSTRUMENT]
MISREADING:
The hook (lcags kyu) is an actual instrument that grasps or pulls objects.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Hook" metaphor invites literalization. Agency attributed to tool.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Looking for hook as subtle structure.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that hook represents grasping nature itself.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[REIFICATION ERROR] metaphor literalism.

[16515-16530] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [SAMENESS AS IDENTITY]
MISREADING:
Samsara and nirvana are the same (mtshungs) in the sense of being identical or one thing.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Same" suggests identity. Unity mysticism conflates sameness with non-duality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Concluding that samsara IS nirvana without transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual bypassing and unethical behavior.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] "nothing matters."

---

[16531-16546] [REIFICATION ERROR] [MEASURE AS STANDARD]
MISREADING:
The three measures (tshad la gsum) are objective standards for valid cognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Measure" suggests quantification. Epistemological frameworks seek criteria.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Applying external standards to direct recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conceptual verification replacing direct seeing.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

---

[16547-16563] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SIZE VARIATION SUBSTANTIALISM]
MISREADING:
The bindu varies in size (thig le che chung) as a literal dimensional quality.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative language suggests measurement. Spatial cognition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Looking for large or small bindu experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Comparing and measuring experiences.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[16564-16571] [PRACTICE ERROR] [REALM-SPECIFIC BINDU PERCEPTION]
MISREADING:
Different beings perceive different bindu sizes because of their karmic realm.

WHY IT ARISES:
Descriptive text invites literal interpretation. Six realms seem like places.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Believing bindu perception depends on rebirth status.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fatalism about present capacity for recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[16572-16579] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [COLOR VARIATION OBSTRUCTION]
MISREADING:
The five colors appearing differently in different realms indicate different bindu types.

WHY IT ARISES:
Color description seems like taxonomy. Variation suggests classification.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Identifying bindu by color characteristics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Sensory discrimination replacing recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation on signs.

---

[16580-16588] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [THUMB-PRESS PRODUCTION]
MISREADING:
Pressing thumb and finger (mtheb mdzub) together physically produces lamp appearances.

WHY IT ARISES:
Instructional language suggests technique. Physical gesture seems causal.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Manipulating body to force experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that gesture is support for natural recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[16589-16596] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EFFORT-EFFORTLESS DICHOTOMY]
MISREADING:
Effortful (rtsol bcas) and effortless (rtsol med) approaches are mutually exclusive alternatives.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Or" (yang) suggests choice. Binary thinking default.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Choosing one approach and rejecting the other.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that both are pedagogical pointers.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] hardened positions.

---

[16597-16604] [REIFICATION ERROR] [CLEAR LIGHT AS EXPERIENCE]
MISREADING:
Clear light appearing at night (mtshan mo 'od gsal) is a special nocturnal experience.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Night" suggests time. Luminous experiences occur in darkness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Waiting for night practice for special experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Temporal conditioning of recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[16605-16613] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [MIXED APPEARANCE LIBERATION]
MISREADING:
Mixed appearance of light and darkness ('od mun 'dres pa) automatically liberates samsara-nirvana.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Liberated" suggests causal result. Description sounds like technique.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Seeking mixed appearance experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Chasing particular perceptual conditions.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation on signs.

[16614-16627] [PRACTICE ERROR] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The bindus falling at the life-channel during pressing and the mixing of wind and light rays are specific techniques to be performed to generate visionary experiences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical physiological descriptions suggest procedural instructions. Western achievement-oriented frameworks seek techniques to produce results.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes technique-driven practice focused on manipulating subtle body elements to force visions, rather than natural self-display of rigpa.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner develops obsession with "pressing" and physiological manipulation. Five lights become goal to achieve rather than self-arising display.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [REIFICATION ERROR] and [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].

---

[16628-16642] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [LITERALISM ERROR]
MISREADING:
The similes of peacock tail, vulture eye, fish eye, and cat eye describe literal anatomical structures or optical phenomena in the physical eyes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Comparative language suggests physical correspondence. Scientific materialist frameworks seek concrete anatomical correlates.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Four lamps are reduced to ophthalmological phenomena or retinal biology. Visionary experience becomes explainable as physical optics.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner examines own eyes seeking peacock-tail patterns or cat-eye reflections. Natural meditative experience is dismissed if not matching descriptions.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MEDICALIZATION ERROR] and [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

---

[16643-16656] [REIFICATION ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The blue five-petaled bindu with light-rim is an actual entity or structure located in the subtle body that can be found and observed.

WHY IT ARISES:
Detailed spatial descriptions suggest objective location. Substantialist frameworks interpret all references as pointing to existing things.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
"Lamp of pure sphere" is objectified as subtle body organ or chakra to be visualized or located. Rigpa is confused with bindu-appearance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner searches for "snake-noose fence" in body or visual field. The metaphorical description becomes literal map to be followed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR].

---

[16657-16671] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Whoever familiarizes" suggests that through repeated practice and familiarization, one can stabilize this vision and make it permanent.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Familiarization" (*goms*) interpreted as habituation or training. Psychological frameworks emphasize learning and conditioning.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition becomes skill to be developed through repetition. "Unfabricated essence" is pursued through deliberate fabrication.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner accumulates "familiarization time" believing quantity produces quality. Natural state is confused with conditioned attainment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] and [ETERNALISTIC ERROR].
