[578-583] [INSIDE-OUTSIDE VIEWING DUALISM] [PERSPECTIVAL PARADOX]
MISREADING:
"Looking from inside, outside clear; looking from outside, inside clear" interpreted as describing actual visual capacity—seeing through things, X-ray vision.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Inside" (*nang*), "outside" (*phyi*), "looking" (*bltas*), "clear" (*gsal*) suggest vision. The phrases describe unusual seeing. Paranormal abilities fascinate.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-duality of appearance-emptiness is reduced to supernatural sight. The actual meaning—non-obstruction of awareness—is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners seek clairvoyance. Meditation aims for penetrating vision. The natural clarity is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [CLAIRVOYANCE SEEKING] (X-ray vision), [PERSPECTIVAL PROJECTION] (inside/outside), [VISUAL PARANORMAL] (supernatural sight), [SEEING OBSESSION] (wanting to see), and [DUALISTIC VISION] (inner/outer duality).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 11 continues the thirty-six activities enumeration from Page 10, completing the "secret four" and beginning body/speech/mind activities. Lines 326-335 complete the body activities.

Line 336 begins speech activities which continue onto Page 12.

ERROR RISK: The detailed enumeration of marks and activities might be read as "what a Buddha has" rather than "ways to recognize uncompounded nature."

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands these enumerations as descriptive categories pointing to nature, not as checklist of accomplishments.

[584-593] [FIVE WISDOMS POSSESSION ERROR] [COGNITIVE ENTITIES]
MISREADING:
The five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) interpreted as five things to acquire or possess—cognitive achievements or mental powers.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Five" suggests list. "Wisdoms" (*ye shes*) suggests knowledge. The text lists them (mirror-like, equality, etc.). Achievement frameworks use checklists.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wisdom is commodified into possession. Practitioners try to "get" five wisdoms. The naturally present awareness is forgotten.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation aims at wisdom accumulation. Teachers sell "wisdom transmission." Recognition is replaced by acquisition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [WISDOM ACCUMULATION] (getting knowledge), [COGNITIVE POSSESSION] (having wisdoms), [ACHIEVEMENT CHECKLIST] (five items), [KNOWLEDGE FETISHISM] (wisdom as power), and [TRANSMISSION COMMERCE] (selling wisdom).

[594-603] [SAMADHI CONCENTRATION EFFORT] [MEDITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT]
MISREADING:
The samadhis (*ting nge 'dzin*)—non-composing, pure vision, pure dharmata, exhaustion of outflows—interpreted as meditative states to achieve through effort.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Samadhi" commonly means "concentration." "Achieving" (*mdzad*) suggests accomplishment. Buddhist practice includes samadhi cultivation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural stability is turned into technique. Practitioners try to "do" samadhi. Effortless recognition is replaced by effort.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation becomes struggle for concentration. Teachers judge students by samadhi depth. Simple awareness is overlooked.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Generates [CONCENTRATION EFFORT] (trying to stabilize), [SAMADHI HIERARCHY] (deeper is better), [MEDITATIVE STRUGGLE] (striving), [ACHIEVEMENT MEASUREMENT] (how concentrated), and [EFFORT PARADOX] (trying to be effortless).

[604-614] [EXHAUSTION OF OUTFLOWS PURIFICATION] [CONTAMINATION CLEANUP]
MISREADING:
"Exhaustion of outflows" (*zag pa zad pa*) interpreted as cleansing impurities—removing defilements, purifying contaminants.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Exhaustion" (*zad pa*) suggests depletion. "Outflows" (*zag pa*) suggests contamination. Purification frameworks dominate spirituality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Awakening is reduced to cleaning process. Practitioners focus on removing impurities. The already-pure nature is forgotten.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Endless purification practices develop. Self-purification becomes obsession. Recognition is replaced by cleansing.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PURIFICATION OBSESSION] (removing defilements), [CONTAMINATION ANXIETY] (being impure), [CLEANSING PRACTICE] (washing away), [DEFILEMENT FOCUS] (watching for outflows), and [NEVER CLEAN ENOUGH] (infinite purification).

[615-624] [EXAMPLE-MEANING DICHOTOMY ERROR] [DUALISTIC COGNITION]
MISREADING:
"Mirror-like wisdom enjoying examples" (*me long lta bu'i ye shes kyis dpe la longs spyod pa*) interpreted as wisdom using examples to understand meaning—cognitive process of learning from illustrations.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Example" (*dpe*) and "meaning" (*don*) suggest pedagogical relationship. "Enjoying" (*longs spyod*) suggests consumption. Learning uses examples.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-dual display is divided into example and meaning. Wisdom becomes cognitive faculty using illustrations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners seek "correct examples." Meditation uses visualizations as examples. Direct recognition is mediated.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Generates [EXAMPLE DEPENDENCY] (needing illustrations), [COGNITIVE MEDIATION] (indirect knowing), [PEDAGOGICAL DUALISM] (example vs. meaning), [REPRESENTATIONALISM] (symbols standing for reality), and [INTERPRETATION OBSESSION] (decoding examples).

[625-634] [EMPTINESS-CLARITY NON-DUAL SUBSTANTIALISM] [FUSION ENTITY]
MISREADING:
"Abiding as emptiness-clarity non-dual" (*gsal stong dbyer med du bzhugs pa*) interpreted as describing a special state where emptiness and clarity are fused together—like mixing two ingredients.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Non-dual" (*dbyer med*) negates duality but affirms something. "Emptiness" (*stong*) and "clarity" (*gsal*) sound like two things. Fusion suggests combination.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Non-duality is reified as "state of fusion." The inseparability is substantialized into special condition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners try to "unite" emptiness and clarity. Meditation seeks fusion experience. Natural inseparability is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [FUSION SEEKING] (mixing empty/luminous), [NON-DUAL SUBSTANTIALISM] (state of unity), [COMBINATION OBSESSION] (putting together), [SYNTHESIS FETISHISM] (resolving duality), and [ACHIEVED UNITY] (getting non-duality).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 12 continues from Page 11's speech activities, moving to mind activities and five wisdoms enumeration. Lines 351-355 describe mind's outer four activities. Lines 356-365 describe inner and secret four.

The page continues the thirty-six activities framework, shifting from body to speech to mind.

ERROR RISK: The progression (body → speech → mind) might be read as hierarchical ascent—mind wisdom "higher" than body marks—rather than simultaneous aspects.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands body, speech, and mind activities as equally uncompounded, not as ladder to climb.
