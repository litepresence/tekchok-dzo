[001-056] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ELEMENT REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
The five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space) are actual physical substances or building blocks of matter.

WHY IT ARISES:
Element terminology suggests chemistry or physics. Materialist worldview.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen physics mistaken for ancient chemistry.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Comparing with modern science; trying to "update" the system.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

[226-264] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [ELEMENT REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
The five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space) are actual physical substances or building blocks of matter.

WHY IT ARISES:
Element terminology suggests chemistry or physics. Materialist worldview.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

[265-313] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WIND AS PHYSIOLOGY]
MISREADING:
The five root winds and branch winds are actual physiological processes or breath patterns.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Wind" (rlung) translated as "air" or "breath" suggests physiology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reduction of subtle body to anatomical respiratory system.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pranayama-style techniques substituted for subtle body practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR].

[314-389] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WIND AS PHYSIOLOGY]
MISREADING:
The five root winds and branch winds are actual physiological processes or breath patterns.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Wind" (rlung) translated as "air" or "breath" suggests physiology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reduction of subtle body to anatomical respiratory system.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pranayama-style techniques substituted for subtle body practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR].

[390-407] [VIEW ERROR] [AWARENESS AS MIND]
MISREADING:
The "awareness" (rig pa) discussed here is the ordinary cognitive mind or consciousness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Awareness" in English suggests ordinary knowing or perception. "Completeness in awareness" sounds like psychological wholeness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's *rig pa* (pristine awareness beyond subject-object) mistaken for *sems* (ordinary dualistic mind).

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Meditation on ordinary mind-state mistaken for recognition of rigpa. Practices of calming and focusing taught instead of direct introduction.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[408-425] [EMPTINESS ERROR] [MERE IMPUTATION AS NIHILISM]
MISREADING:
"All dharmas are merely imputed/labelled" means nothing exists at all.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Merely" (*tsam*) suggests insignificance. "Imputed" (*btags pa*) suggests artificiality. Combined, they sound like "just imaginary."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's "primordially spontaneously complete" (*ye nas lhun grub*) interpreted as nothingness, contradicting the text's assertion of completeness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Denial of relative truth while failing to recognize absolute truth. Practitioners become stuck in blank meditation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[426-444] [SUBTLE BODY ERROR] [INNER ARISING AS PHYSIOLOGY]
MISREADING:
The "inner arising" five elements are the physical organs and systems (lungs, heart, digestion, etc.).

WHY IT ARISES:
"Inner" suggests interior of body. "Five elements" mapped to anatomy. "Channels" (*rtsa*) translated as veins/nerves.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices reduced to physical health exercises or subtle anatomy visualization.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Wisdom potential (*ye shes kyi gdangs*) sought through physical manipulation rather than recognition of nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[445-473] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WIND AS PHYSIOLOGY]
MISREADING:
The five root winds and branch winds are actual physiological processes or breath patterns.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Wind" (rlung) translated as "air" or "breath" suggests physiology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reduction of subtle body to anatomical respiratory system.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pranayama-style techniques substituted for subtle body practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR].
