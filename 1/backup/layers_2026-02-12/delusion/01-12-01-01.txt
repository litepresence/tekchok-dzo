The "sa bon" (seed/basis) is a physical entity that remains or drips, determining health outcomes.

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 14078: "sa bon mi 'dzag pa" (seed not dripping).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Materializing the subtle basis into physical substance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fixation on physical conservation.

[14406-14425] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [TRIPARTITE PURIFICATION MECHANISM]
MISREADING:
The three channels purify body, speech, and mind through a mechanical process of separation and filtering.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing purification as external process applied to channels.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Attempting to force purification through manipulation.
Missing that purity is the natural state, not achieved.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PURIFICATION PROJECT ERROR]

[14426-14445] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [CHANNEL INDICATION LITERALISM]
MISREADING:
The channels "indicate" or "represent" (mtshon) bliss, clarity, and union as if they were symbols pointing to something else.

WHY IT ARISES:
Lines 14091-14100: Extensive descriptions of what each channel "indicates."

WHY IT ARISES:
Line 14092: "rten 'brel gyi 'khor lo bskor bas" (by turning the wheel of dependent arising).

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing dependent arising as something to construct or manipulate.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Effort-based meditation rather than recognition.
Missing that dependent arising is self-arising and self-liberated.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[CONSTRUCTIVE MEDITATION ERROR]

[14466-14482] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [GENERATIVE CAUSALITY MECHANISM]
MISREADING:
Body, speech, and mind are generated sequentially through a causal chain: body produces channels, channels produce speech, speech produces mind.

[CAUSAL INVERSION ERROR]

[14483-14500] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PURE/DROSS DUALISM]

There are actually two substances - pure essence (dngas ma/dwangs ma) and impure dross (snyigs ma) - that need to be separated.

WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Viewing reality as containing inherently pure and impure parts.

Attempting to extract or cultivate the pure.
