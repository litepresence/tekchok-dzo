[3062-3065] [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The distinction between Sravaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles is interpreted as establishing rigid personality types, rather than recognizing fluid categories based on capacity and inclination.


WHY IT ARISES:
Typology fascination. The practitioner wants to identify 'which one am I?' Personality tests are popular.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner becomes fixated on vehicle-identity. 'I am a Pratyekabuddha type' becomes self-limiting belief.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Flexibility is lost. The practitioner follows a rigid path based on initial assessment rather than responding to circumstances.

MISREADING:
The 'result' of the Sravaka path—Arhatship—is understood as final extinction (nirvana with remainder) that represents a lower goal than Buddhahood.


WHY IT ARISES:
Mahayana superiority complex. The practitioner believes bigger goal = better. Compassion for all beings seems superior to personal liberation.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner looks down on Arhats as 'selfish' while lacking their actual attainment. Pride without substance.

WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner defers genuine recognition while working through vehicle-stages. The path becomes endless preparation.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Each vehicle becomes another box to check. Recognition is perpetually deferred until 'completion' of current vehicle.
