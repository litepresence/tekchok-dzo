WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual ambition seeks supreme teaching. 'Atiyoga' suggests pinnacle. Marketing emphasizes 'direct path.'

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues 'wisdom' as if it were a thing to acquire. Mind is rejected in favor of wisdom.

The practitioner attempts advanced practices without capacity. Recognition is claimed without substance.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]



ERROR TYPE 4:

[4584-4589] [VIEW COLLAPSE] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The Dzogchen distinction between mind (sems) and primordial wisdom (ye shes) is interpreted as establishing two different substances or entities.


WHY IT ARISES:
Dualistic thinking creates categories. The distinction invites reification. The practitioner wants clear ontological categories.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues 'wisdom' as if it were a thing to acquire. Mind is rejected in favor of wisdom.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The non-dual nature of the distinction is missed. The practitioner oscillates between rejecting and pursuing mind.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [PRACTICE ERROR]



ERROR TYPE 5:

[4590-4596] [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition is interpreted as bypassing all gradual preparation, encouraging immediate advanced practice without foundation.


WHY IT ARISES:
Impatience and spiritual ambition. 'Direct' suggests faster. The practitioner wants to skip to the end.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner attempts advanced practices without capacity. Recognition is claimed without substance.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes performative. The practitioner demonstrates ' Dzogchen view' as identity marker.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] and [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY]

================================================================================


MISREADING:
Dzogchen is understood as the 'highest' vehicle that makes all other vehicles obsolete, encouraging immediate abandonment of foundational practices.


WHY IT ARISES:
Spiritual ambition seeks supreme teaching. 'Atiyoga' suggests pinnacle. Marketing emphasizes 'direct path.'


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner abandons foundational practice for 'direct' methods without preparation.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Dzogchen practice fails due to lack of foundation. The practitioner claims Dzogchen view while remaining ordinary.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] and [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM]



ERROR TYPE 2:

[4604-4610] [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The Dzogchen teaching of 'primordial liberation' (ye grol) is interpreted as meaning no practice is necessary because one is already enlightened.


WHY IT ARISES:
Laziness finds confirmation in 'already perfect.' Nihilistic tendencies interpret liberation as license.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner stops all practice. 'Already enlightened' becomes excuse for non-engagement.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Ordinary mind remains unexamined. The gap between claim and reality widens. Spiritual narcissism develops.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY]



ERROR TYPE 3:

[4611-4617] [PROGRESSION MYTH] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The space/depth (klong) classifications of Dzogchen are interpreted as metaphysical realities to be accessed or inhabited, rather than pedagogical descriptions.


WHY IT ARISES:
Metaphysical thinking seeks ultimate ground. 'Space of dharmata' suggests transcendent realm.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner pursues 'entering the space' as goal. Meditative states are mistaken for realization.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spatial metaphors become reified. The practitioner talks about 'the space' as if it were a place.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]
