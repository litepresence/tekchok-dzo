[635-635] [EMPTINESS-CLARITY NON-DUAL SUBSTANTIALISM] [FUSION ENTITY]
MISREADING:
"Abiding as emptiness-clarity non-dual" (*gsal stong dbyer med du bzhugs pa*) interpreted as describing a special state where emptiness and clarity are fused together—like mixing two ingredients.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Non-dual" (*dbyer med*) negates duality but affirms something. "Emptiness" (*stong*) and "clarity" (*gsal*) sound like two things. Fusion suggests combination.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Non-duality is reified as "state of fusion." The inseparability is substantialized into special condition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners try to "unite" emptiness and clarity. Meditation seeks fusion experience. Natural inseparability is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [FUSION SEEKING] (mixing empty/luminous), [NON-DUAL SUBSTANTIALISM] (state of unity), [COMBINATION OBSESSION] (putting together), [SYNTHESIS FETISHISM] (resolving duality), and [ACHIEVED UNITY] (getting non-duality).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 12 continues from Page 11's speech activities, moving to mind activities and five wisdoms enumeration. Lines 351-355 describe mind's outer four activities. Lines 356-365 describe inner and secret four.

The page continues the thirty-six activities framework, shifting from body to speech to mind.

ERROR RISK: The progression (body → speech → mind) might be read as hierarchical ascent—mind wisdom "higher" than body marks—rather than simultaneous aspects.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands body, speech, and mind activities as equally uncompounded, not as ladder to climb.
