[TAGS: VIEW MISPLACEMENT]
MISREADING:
The three_kayas_ground is established as philosophical position to be adopted through study, creating view-accumulation model where intellectual understanding substitutes for direct recognition. The definitional precision of Tibetan scholastic presentation encourages reification of view as conceptual framework rather than immediate awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
Definitional language suggests possession and ownership. View presented as object of knowledge implies distance between knower and known. Philosophical framing implies view as proposition to be adopted rather than recognition to be immediate. Academic training privileges conceptual mastery over embodied wisdom. The very precision of terminology creates illusion that understanding words equals understanding reality.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
View substantialized as belief-system inventory. Study leads to view-possession mistaken for realization. Intellectual understanding masquerades as direct recognition. Conceptual clarity substituted for non-conceptual wisdom. The map becomes territory, description becomes experience, philosophy becomes prison.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
View-shopping across traditions creates spiritual consumerism. Philosophical pride masks underlying insecurity. Dialectical fixation generates endless debates without resolution. Conceptual imprisonment prevents direct seeing. The more views accumulated, the more obscured the viewless view.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Philosophy fixation → intellectual arrogance develops → condescension toward non-scholars → sectarianism based on view-adoption → polemics displace practice → tradition fragments into warring philosophical camps → living transmission dies in library dust.
