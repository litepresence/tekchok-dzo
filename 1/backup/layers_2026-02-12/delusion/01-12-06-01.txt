[15769-15773] [LIGHT CHASING] [BINDU MATERIALISM]
MISREADING:
The thigle meditation produces light experiences and bindu movements that practitioners should seek to intensify and stabilize—resting in thigle means dwelling in luminous phenomena, and familiarization extends light duration.

WHY IT ARISES:
The thigle terminology suggests light-phenomena. Practitioners habitually interpret "resting in bindu" as luminous experience to pursue.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen becomes light-dwelling practice. The practitioner focuses on generating, extending, and intensifying thigle-luminosity, treating light experiences as meditation object.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Materialism of luminosity reaches peak. The practitioner grasps at thigle-light as precious substance to possess, day-and-night familiarization becomes light-hoarding, and the "path" is now accumulation of luminous experience rather than recognition of nature beyond all phenomena.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
This error generates [LUMINOSITY DWELLING] staying in light, [THIGLE-LIGHT POSSESSION] holding experience, and [DAY-NIGHT ACCUMULATION] hoarding moments. The error creates grasping.

[15774-15777] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [EFFORTLESS APPROPRIATION]
MISREADING:
The distinction between effortful (rtsol bcas) and effortless (rtsol med) systems is a hierarchical progression from lower to higher.

WHY IT ARISES:
Natural assumption that "effortless" is superior. Common marketing of "direct path" over gradual methods.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Premature abandonment of effortful preliminary practices.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Lack of foundation for recognizing effortless state.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
