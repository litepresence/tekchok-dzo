MISREADING:
The practice of the six perfections is interpreted as requiring the accumulation of vast quantities of merit over countless lifetimes, making immediate recognition impossible.


WHY IT ARISES:

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is deferred to future lifetimes. The practitioner believes they are 'working toward' enlightenment.
