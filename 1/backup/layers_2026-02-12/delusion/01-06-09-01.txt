[8810-8817] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [BLISS DEVELOPMENT]
MISREADING:
The cultivation of bliss is interpreted as developing an experience over time through repeated practice, like building muscle or acquiring skill, with bliss as conditioned attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Conditioning and training frameworks impose development models. The language of "cultivation" suggests temporal growth. Fear that bliss won't happen without effort drives doing-obsession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that bliss is the natural expression of mind's nature, always present, never developed, is entirely obscured. Seeking replaces finding.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners chase increasingly intense experiences, becoming bliss-addicted. Disappointment when conditioned experiences fade leads to technique-switching. The unconditioned is abandoned for the conditioned.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Four joys will be misread as temporal progression rather than simultaneous aspects.

[8818-8826] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [SIGN COLLECTION]
MISREADING:
The signs of warmth (signs of successful practice) are treated as trophies or achievements to be collected and displayed, like merit badges certifying advancement.

WHY IT ARISES:
Credential-seeking psychology projects onto spiritual practice. The enumerative language suggests collectible items. Desire for external validation supports sign-fetishism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that signs are spontaneous expressions of recognition, not goals to achieve, is entirely lost. Practice becomes sign-production rather than recognition-cultivation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners fake or exaggerate signs to appear advanced. Competition around "who has more signs" poisons communities. The genuine is abandoned for the performed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on four visions will be approached as sign-accumulation sequence.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains subtle body practices (thigle, channels, winds). Preceding pages established empowerment-transaction errors that carry forward—practitioners believe these practices require prior empowerment. Following pages (206+) discuss the four joys which will be misunderstood through lens of sensation-development.

[8827-8836] [PRACTICE ERROR] [MUDRA MECHANISM]
MISREADING:
The four mudras (karma mudra, samaya mudra, dharma mudra, mahamudra) are interpreted as physical hand gestures and sexual positions that mechanically produce realization when performed correctly.

WHY IT ARISES:
Performative frameworks project onto mudra practice. The detailed physical instructions suggest choreographed causation. Desire for concrete techniques supports literal interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that mudras are expressions of realized view, not causes of realization, is entirely lost. Practice becomes physical performance rather than recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners obsess over precise positioning while neglecting view. Sexual technique replaces wisdom inquiry. The symbolic dimensions are reduced to mechanics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on thigle will be approached as hydraulic management.

[8837-8840] [VIEW ERROR] [LOCATION ESSENTIALISM]
MISREADING:
The specific locations (tip to root, root to navel, etc.) are understood as fixed anatomical points that must be precisely mapped and manipulated, like acupuncture points with guaranteed effects.

WHY IT ARISES:
Cartographic thinking projects spatial certainty onto subtle body. The precise anatomical language suggests objective geography. Scientific materialism supports literalization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that locations are conceptual designations for awareness-movement, not fixed points, is entirely obscured. The energetic becomes the cartographic.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners carry anatomical maps while missing the awareness that moves. Disappointment when locations don't match descriptions leads to doubt. The fluid becomes fixed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on channel opening become navigational challenges.
