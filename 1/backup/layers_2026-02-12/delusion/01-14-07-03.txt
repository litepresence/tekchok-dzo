[19404-19406] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The locations of bindus in citadel, dhūtī, conch-shell, etc., are interpreted as asserting that these bindus are literally present in all sentient beings as physical or energetic structures—universal anatomy claim.

WHY IT ARISES:
"All sentient beings" (*སེམས་ཅན་ཀུན་) triggers universalist reading. Anatomical specificity suggests literal claim. Western egalitarianism interprets this as "everyone has the same potential."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Buddha-nature is spatialized and localized in specific body parts. The all-pervading nature of rigpa is lost. "Everyone has bindus in these locations" becomes metaphysical biology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Bindu of pure kāya in citadel" is mapped anatomically. "Bindu of emptiness-symbols in dhūtī" becomes location claim. "Path bindu in channel-root" is treated as discoverable feature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [REIFICATION ERROR] triggers [PRACTICE ERROR] where students search for bindus in their bodies. [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] follows as Dzogchen anatomy is compared to other systems. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[19407-19417] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The cascade description—expanse's resonance produces vajra chain-linked, from that merit-kāya, from that kāya's display produces wisdom, etc.—is interpreted as literal cosmogony asserting how phenomena actually come into existence.

WHY IT ARISES:
Process language (*ལས་, *བྱུང་) triggers causal reading. "Produces" suggests generation. Western metaphysics interprets this as ontological account of creation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen is reduced to cosmological system. The cascade is taken as literal description of how things arise. The non-dual, non-originated nature of display is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"True rigpa exists in vajra chain-linked" becomes existence claim. "Merit produces kāya" suggests causal generation. "From wisdom's ornament comes light" is read as physics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR] where Dzogchen is treated as metaphysics. [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] follows as cascade levels are reified. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] proliferates.

[19418-19420] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The detailed progression of bindu visions—from upright to wings, from that various weapon-forms, reliquaries, lotuses—is interpreted as the actual stages of thodgal practice that all practitioners should sequentially experience.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential description triggers developmental reading. "Seeing" (*མཐོང་) suggests visual achievement. Western stage-theories project linear progression onto Dzogchen.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes standardized vision-sequence. Practitioners compare their experiences to this "map," believing they must see specific forms in order. Natural display is forced into prescriptive framework.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Upright bindu standing" becomes stage one requirement. "Rainbow-like" is intermediate. "Weapons and reliquaries" are advanced. Students become anxious about "not seeing the right things."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where specific visions become attainments. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as vision-stages are institutionalized. [EPISTEMIC ERROR] proliferates as students fake or force experiences.
