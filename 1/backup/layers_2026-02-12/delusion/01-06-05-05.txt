[8672-8678] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [ACHIEVEMENT FETISHISM]
MISREADING:
The description of "approach" bringing supreme, medium, and lesser siddhis is interpreted as a promise of guaranteed worldly attainments (wealth, power, influence) proportionate to practice effort.

WHY IT ARISES:
Commodity-exchange frameworks project onto spiritual practice. The transactional language ("contact brings accomplishment") suggests investment-return mechanics. Desires for worldly success are spiritualized.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The siddhis are misunderstood as worldly powers rather than signs of realization. Practice becomes investment strategy for spiritual ROI. Recognition is abandoned for acquisition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Disappointment when worldly results don't manifest leads to abandonment of practice or frantic technique-switching. Comparison and competition around "attainments" poison communities. The supreme siddhi (recognition) is sacrificed for lesser gains.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent descriptions of signs and indications are treated as promises to be collected rather than pointers to recognize.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains mantra and ritual substance instructions. Preceding page (201) established consort classification errors that carry forward—practitioners will combine consort-objectification with ritual-mechanism in dangerous ways. Following pages (203+) discuss subtle body practices that will be misunderstood through lens of substance-fetishism.

[8679-8679] [PRACTICE ERROR] [POSTURE FIXATION]
MISREADING:
The physical posture instructions (lion's leap, joints bent, chest hollowed) are interpreted as literal gymnastic requirements that mechanically produce realization when held correctly, like asanas in hatha yoga.

WHY IT ARISES:
Physicalist frameworks assume form determines consciousness. The detailed anatomical instructions suggest biomechanical causation. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports posture-obsession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that posture supports but does not cause recognition is entirely lost. Practitioners injure themselves forcing positions while neglecting the view that makes posture meaningful.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Flexibility competition replaces wisdom inquiry. Those with physical limitations believe themselves excluded from realization. The energetic dimensions of posture are reduced to muscular mechanics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on channel practices will be approached as physical manipulations rather than energetic recognitions.
