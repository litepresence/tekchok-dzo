[1671-1676] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SKANDHAS AND DHATUS]
This section presents the Dzogchen perspective on the traditional Buddhist analysis of skandhas (phung po) and dhatus (khams), demonstrating how these conventional categories are understood within the Great Perfection framework. The text enumerates the six consciousness dhatus—the visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, mental, and tactile consciousnesses—showing how each perceives its respective object domain. Crucially, the presentation maintains that these dhatus are "born from the aspect of delusion that grasps inwardly" ('khrul pa nyid nang du 'dzin pa'i cha las byung ba), indicating the Dzogchen view that all conventional phenomena emerge from the fundamental ground of rig pa yet remain essentially empty of inherent existence.

The distinction between "skandhas with conceptualization" (rtog pa dang bcas pa'i phung po) and "skandhas without conceptualization" (rtog pa med pa'i phung po) reflects the nuanced Dzogchen approach to the gradual vehicles. The former refers to the five contaminated aggregates of ordinary worldly beings, while the latter points toward the recognition of the aggregates as luminous emptiness. This stratification uses [DEFINITIVE MEANING] vs [PROVISIONAL MEANING] where the enumeration of aggregates serves as [DRANG DON] for those who need gradual training, while their recognition as the display of rig pa represents [NGES DON].

The five skandhas—form (gzugs), feeling (tshor ba), perception ('du shes), formations ('du byed), and consciousness (rnam par shes pa)—are here presented not as ultimately real entities but as functional categories for analyzing experience. In Dzogchen, these are understood as the "spontaneous self-display" (rang shar) of the ground, neither truly existent nor non-existent. The epistemic stance maintains [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH], where the aggregates appear conventionally but are empty of svabhava ultimately.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] applies here as the text establishes the ontological status of these phenomena, while [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] is implicit in how one is to understand these categories during practice—not as objects of rejection but as the natural display to be recognized. The section demonstrates how Dzogchen integrates and transcends traditional Abhidharma analysis, using it as a skillful means while pointing to the primordial purity (ka dag) of all phenomena.

The eighteen dhatus are understood as the self-display of awareness (rig pa'i rang shar), appearing yet empty, empty yet appearing—a union that transcends the extremes of eternalism and nihilism. This is the Dzogchen view of "appearances and mind as the dharmakaya" (snang sems chos sku), where conventional analysis serves as a doorway to ultimate recognition.

[1677-1700] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THEG PA DGU'I RNAM GZHAG]
This section introduces the classification of the nine vehicles (theg pa dgu), a systematic presentation that organizes Buddhist teachings according to their philosophical sophistication and meditative approach. From the Dzogchen perspective, this nine-fold classification represents a [PROVISIONAL MEANING] structure designed to accommodate practitioners of varying capacities. The three outer vehicles (phyi yi theg pa gsum)—Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva vehicles—are presented as the foundation upon which the inner vehicles are established.

The epistemic stratification here employs [DZOGCHEN VIEW] vs [PROVISIONAL VIEW], where the nine vehicles are taught as [PROVISIONAL VIEW] to guide beings progressively. The Sravaka vehicle emphasizes the four noble truths and the twelve links of dependent origination, presenting a view of radical impermanence and no-self that serves as a necessary foundation. The Pratyekabuddha vehicle adds deeper insight into dependent origination and the empty nature of phenomena. The Bodhisattva vehicle introduces the altruistic motivation of bodhicitta and the six perfections.

From the definitive Dzogchen standpoint, these vehicles are not ultimately distinct paths leading to different results but rather skillful means (thabs) that all converge in the recognition of rig pa. The text implicitly maintains [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH], acknowledging that while these vehicles are conventionally taught as separate paths, ultimately all phenomena are primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously present (lhun grub).

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] is primary here as the text categorizes and defines the philosophical positions of each vehicle. However, [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] is also present in how practitioners of each vehicle engage their respective paths. The section reflects the Dzogchen hermeneutic principle that the Buddha taught different vehicles according to the capacities of beings, with Atiyoga representing the culmination that transcends yet includes all previous vehicles.

The epistemic stance acknowledges that while the nine vehicles are presented systematically, from the perspective of primordial purity (gdod ma'i grol ba), no vehicles exist—there is only the self-recognition of awareness beyond all categorization. The classification serves as a pedagogical tool, organizing teachings from the coarse to the subtle, from the provisional to the definitive, guiding practitioners toward the direct recognition of the natural state (gnas lugs).

[1701-1724] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – NYAN THOS THEG PA ANALYSIS]
This section provides a detailed analysis of the Sravaka vehicle (nyan thos kyi theg pa), presenting it as the foundational approach to Buddhist practice focused on the realization of personal selflessness (gang zag gi bdag med). The epistemic framework here distinguishes between [PROVISIONAL MEANING] and [DEFINITIVE MEANING], where the Sravaka view is explicitly positioned as [PROVISIONAL MEANING] from the Dzogchen perspective. The text enumerates the Sravaka's philosophical tenets: recognition of the four noble truths, understanding of the twelve links of dependent origination, and meditation on the sixteen aspects of the four truths.

The stratification employs [VIEW ASSERTION] vs [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION], with the former predominating as the text outlines the Sravaka's ontological commitments. The Sravaka asserts the ultimate existence of dharmas while denying the existence of a permanent self—a position that represents a partial understanding from the Dzogchen view. The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] transcends this dualistic framework, recognizing that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence while being the spontaneous display of rig pa.

The section discusses the Sravaka's approach to the five skandhas, analyzing them as "not self, not other than self, not both, and not neither"—a fourfold analysis that deconstructs the notion of a permanent identity. However, from the definitive perspective, this analysis remains within the domain of conceptual elaboration (spros pa). The Dzogchen view holds that rig pa itself is beyond all such analysis, being naturally free from the extremes of existence and non-existence.

The epistemic category [ULTIMATE TRUTH] vs [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] is applied here, with the Sravaka understanding representing a conventional truth that prepares the ground for ultimate realization. The text maintains that while Sravakas achieve liberation from samsara through their realization of personal selflessness, they do not realize the full emptiness of phenomena (chos kyi bdag med), which remains the domain of the Great Vehicle.

The viewpoint tag [NGES DON] is absent here, replaced by [DRANG DON], indicating that this presentation serves as a skillful means leading toward the definitive Dzogchen view rather than being the final position itself. The Sravaka path functions as a necessary foundation, purifying the coarsest level of attachment and establishing the framework of impermanence and no-self upon which higher teachings are built. Without this foundation, the subtler Dzogchen teachings would be mere words without experiential basis.

[1725-1731] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RANG RGYAL THEG PA]
This section examines the Pratyekabuddha vehicle (rang rgyal gyi theg pa), positioned between the Sravaka and Bodhisattva vehicles in the nine-yana schema. The Pratyekabuddha's philosophical achievement lies in realizing not only personal selflessness (gang zag gi bdag med) but also partial phenomenal selflessness (chos kyi bdag med phyed), specifically understanding that external phenomena lack inherent existence. However, they maintain a subtle grasping at the perceiving consciousness, failing to realize its empty nature.

The epistemic stratification here uses [PROVISIONAL MEANING] vs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] to distinguish the Pratyekabuddha's view from the full realization of emptiness. The text cites the Abhisamayalankara: "In order to abandon grasping at objects, but not to abandon grasping at subjects—the path of the rhinoceros-like [Pratyekabuddha] is known through condensed meaning." This demonstrates that the Pratyekabuddha vehicle represents an intermediate position, transcending the Sravaka's external realism while not yet reaching the Madhyamaka's thorough emptiness.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] transcends even this subtle dualism, recognizing that subject and object are equally the display of rig pa, neither truly existent nor truly non-existent. The Pratyekabuddha's meditation on dependent origination in reverse order (rten 'brel lugs bzlog) serves as a [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] that prepares the practitioner for deeper insights, yet remains a [PROVISIONAL VIEW] from the definitive perspective.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] applies here as well. The Pratyekabuddha's realization of external emptiness represents a deeper penetration of ultimate truth than the Sravaka achieves, but still falls short of the complete emptiness taught in the Great Vehicle and fully realized in Dzogchen.

The two types of Pratyekabuddhas—those who live in groups (tshogs spyod) like cranes, and solitary ones like rhinoceroses—represent different approaches to the same philosophical view. Both, however, are classified under [DRANG DON] in the Dzogchen hermeneutic, serving as gradual paths that ultimately lead to the recognition of rig pa beyond all conceptual frameworks. The Pratyekabuddha accumulates merit for a hundred great eons (bskal pa chen po brgyar tshogs bsags), demonstrating the gradual nature of this path.

The section illustrates the progressive refinement of view from Sravaka through Pratyekabuddha to Bodhisattva, each level dissolving more subtle levels of reification. Yet from the Dzogchen standpoint, even the most refined conceptual understanding remains provisional, pointing toward the non-conceptual recognition that transcends all philosophical positions.
