<The *klong dkar po* (white space/expanse) category presents Dzogchen view through two modalities: (1) *las rgya che ba brjod med du bshad pa* (explaining great activity as inexpressible) and (2) *lta sgom kha sbyar* (view-meditation combined/joined). The essence (*ngo bo*) as *mthong ba cer grol* (seeing precisely/merely liberated) indicates *lta ba* (view) as immediate recognition without gradation—seeing itself IS liberation, not a cause for future liberation. This is *ye grol* (primordial liberation) versus *bsgrol* (liberating).>

<Ocean-space (*rgya mtsho'i klong*) and sky-space (*nam mkha'i klong*) represent the two primary classifications. Ocean-space's essence as *rtag mtha' rang grol* (eternal extreme self-liberated) transcends the extreme of eternalism (*rtag mtha'*). The division into great/small ocean-space distinguishes capacity: great (*chen po*) for those with thoroughly pure observation (*ltos pa yongs su dag*), small (*chung ba*) for those realizing conditions as primordially inexpressible. Both point to *chos nyid*—not different realities but different recognition capacities.>

<Sky-space (*nam mkha'i klong*) essence: dharmatā uncorrectable/unfabricable (*chos nyid bcos su med pa*) therefore mind-essence self-liberated (*sems nyid rang grol*). The two divisions—sun-moon space (*nyi zla'i klong*) and jewel white-space (*rin po che'i klong dkar po*)—represent luminosity (*gsal ba*) and purity (*dag pa*) aspects. The phrase *yon tan yongs su rdzogs pas* (qualities completely perfected) indicates *lhun grub* (spontaneous accomplishment): causes/conditions self-purified without mind's fabrication, dharmatā naturally accomplished.>

<The *klong rab 'byams* (vast expanse) category's essence: appearing as mind-known (*snang bar sems kyis shes*), non-appearing as abiding-mode-known (*mi snang bar gnas lugs kyis shes*). This is *sems sde* characteristic—relying on mind (*sems*) as knower. The fourfold division (outer, inner, secret, suchness vast expanse) corresponds to progressive subtlety. The three essential points of causeless irreversibility, conditionless non-harm, and cause-condition non-establishment progressively undermine reification until *'khor 'das gang yang ma grub* (samsara/nirvana nothing established).>

[3809-3816] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The *klong nag po* (black space/expanse) division presents three modalities: enlightened activity (*mdzad pa*), compassion (*thugs rje*), and emanation (*sprul pa*). The first—activity as appearing manifoldly causeless (*shar snang sna tshogs rgyu med du shar*)—demonstrates *chos can* (subject) without reference (*mi ltos pa*). This is not nihilistic absence of causality but *chos nyid* transcending cause-effect logic. The play (*rol pa*) without affirmation/negation (*dgag sgrub med pa*) is spontaneous display, not deliberate action.>

<The reasoning (*gtan tshigs*) of is/is-not extreme slumber (*yin min phyogs nyal*) establishes Dzogchen view free from limits (*mu mtha' dang bral ba*). Appearance-emptiness self-liberated from seeing (*mthong snang rang sar grol*) means *snang ba* (appearance) and *stong pa* (emptiness) are not sequential stages but simultaneous (*gcig char*) recognition. The non-dual wheel (*'khor lo gnyis med*) indicates *chos sku* (dharmakāya) and *longs sku* (saṃbhogakāya) as unified display.>

[3825-3832] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<Compassion (*thugs rje*) as black space: appearing as primordial wisdom therefore knowing not dependent on other (*shes pa gzhan la mi ltos*), liberating as mind therefore not reciting on causes/conditions (*rgyu rkyen la bzla ba*). The non-dual abiding of appearing-liberating (*shar grol gnyis su med du gnas pa*) indicates *'bras bu ye nas grol ba* (result primordially liberated). This is *sems sde* framing—using *sems* (mind) as access point to *rig pa* (awareness).>

[3833-3840] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<Emanation (*sprul pa*) black space: the reasoning of harmonious appearance self-purified (*mthun snang rang dag pa'i gtan tshigs*) establishes Dzogchen as liberated from appearance-place. The phrase *ye shes gsum shar bas chos sku'i zhing khams su sprul* (three wisdoms arisen emanate into dharmakāya field) indicates *'od gsal* (clear light) display—not creation but self-manifest recognition. This transcends emanation theory (*sprul sku*) of lower vehicles.>

[3841-3850] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The *klong dmar po* (red space/expanse) category presents the sixfold essential-point classification (*gnad drug*). The threefold division into mind (*sems*), wisdom (*ye shes*), and space (*klong*) maps onto the recognition topology: mind as conception-free (*rnam rtog med pa*), wisdom as obstacle-free (*gegs med pa*), space as changing-free (*'gyur med pa*). The essence of space as *chos nyid rang grol* (dharmatā self-liberated) indicates *ye nas grol* (primordially liberated) nature—not achieved but recognized.>

[3851-3860] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<The mind-space (*sems kyi klong*) threefold division: (1) undistracted essential-point (*yengs med kyi gnad*), (2) essential-point of mind-emptiness beyond observation (*sems nyid stong pa ltos med kyi gnad*), (3) essential-point of thought-free essence (*blo bral ngo bo'i gnad*). Each *gnad* (essential point) is not a technique to apply but a recognition to rest in. The *sems sde* framework uses progressive subtlety to undermine fixation on progressively subtler objects.>

---

[3861-3869] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<Wisdom-space (*ye shes kyi klong*) threefold: (1) wisdom-emptiness obstacle-free (*ye shes stong pa gegs med kyi gnad*), (2) play-emptiness without interruption (*rol pa stong pa bar chad med pa'i gnad*), (3) indemonstrable essential-point (*bstan du med pa'i gnad*). The phrase *chos nyid 'gyur med gegs su med pa* (dharmatā unchanging obstacle-free) indicates *ye shes* as *rig pa*'s knowing quality—not separate from emptiness but its luminous clarity.>
