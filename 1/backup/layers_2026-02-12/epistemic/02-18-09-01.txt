[5085-5095] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SENG GE]
<The *Seng Ge* (Lion?) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation from *Seng Ge* (*seng ge rtsal rdzogs las*): self-display (*rang snang*), phenomena (*rig pa'i dngos po de*) in vessel-hook-continuum, abiding (*ye shes gu lu rgyud du gnas*)—this establishes that awareness's phenomena abide within the vessel-hook-continuum of recognition-display. The citation from *Nor Bu Phra* (Precious-One who constructed?) (*nor bu 'phra bkod las*): suffering (*rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma*)—this is *sems-side* provisional describing how delusion manifests as suffering, like carrying heavy burden. The statement that also, in that, yang (*la yang dag par rdzogs pa'i sangs rgyas rig pa lu gu rgyud kyi sku yongs su gsal lo zhes so*)—establishes that the Fully-Awakening's awareness in vessel-hook-continuum is thoroughly shining. Risk of personification: treating "Seng Ge" and "Nor Bu Phra" as mystical beings rather than authoritative citations.>

[5085-5089] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – CESSATION-COGNITION]
<The cessation-cognition (*'das pa'i shes*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The description of cessation-cognition, empty, clear, beyond-limit's understanding-capacity and wisdom-qualities (*'das pa'i shes nyams stong gsal mtha' bral gyi rtogs tshad shes rab kyi rtsal dang bcas pa rnams te*)—this establishes that recognition (*rtogs*) is the capacity to understand emptiness, clarity, beyond-limit without adding wisdom-qualities. The statement from that, beginning and worn-out (*'di nyid thog ma bar dang mthar goms pa las*)—this indicates that recognition is not through gradual practice but primordial beginning. Risk of meditationism: treating "cessation-cognition" as meditative state to cultivate rather than recognition of what is already present.>

[5089-5108] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – EXPERIENCE-QUALITIES]
<The experience-qualities (*nyams*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The three qualities: (1) wisdom, pleasure, experience (*shes pa dga' bde'i nyams dang*); (2) worn-out experience (*mthar 'gyur gyi nyams dang*); (3) appearance, experience, three arising (*snang ba'i nyams dang gsum 'byung ba las*)—these are descriptions of recognition's modes, not stages to achieve. The gnad: body-speech gnad (*lus ngag gnad*)—accumulated wind, mind's object, separated (*gcun pas rlung sems bag la zha nas*)—this indicates that when wind is calmed and mind-object separation recognized, recognition rests naturally. Risk of pleasure-reification: treating "pleasure" as attainment rather than recognition's natural display.>

[5095-5112] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – EXPERIENCE METHOD]
<The experience method (*nyams su blang lugs*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured approach. The instruction that in affliction and ground, great-quantity (*dang po thun chung la grangs mang du bya*)—this describes that many recognitions (*grangs*) should occur within the context of affliction (*dang po*) and ground (*thun chung la*). The two, three (*gnyis pa la thun bskyed cing yun bsring*)—refers to recognition of two aspects or three aspects with consistency (*yun bsring*). The statement that three (*gsum pa la nyin mtshan med par nyams su blangs zhing*)—indicates that the three recognitions are distinguished without characteristics (*nyin mtshan med*). Risk of methodologism: treating "experience method" as graduated technique rather than recognition-framework.>

[5108-5119] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-NATURE]
<The self-nature (*rang bzhin*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Within that (*nang*) expanse-clear (*'od gsal stong pa'i ngang*)—this describes recognition's inner nature: clarity, emptiness, expanse. The statement that enjoying (*'byams pa dang*) wisdom also grasping (*shes pa bag yangs gzung 'dzin med pa'i dga' bde yangs pa khrol chags su skyes kyang zhen 'dzin spu nyag tsam yang med pa ni rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan gnad du phebs pa las byung ba'o*)—this establishes that even if pleasure arises, wisdom's grasping is never established; recognition's gnad (*bsam gtan gnad*) is already self-nature (*rang bzhin*). Risk of self-other dualism: interpreting "self-nature" as some essential entity rather than recognition's self-knowing quality.>

[5112-5124] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – AWARENESS-EXPANSE]
<The awareness-in-expanse-between (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcug pa las*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that awareness in expanse's between, not waver, make (*mi 'gul bar byed de*)—this is the definitive instruction on how recognition rests. The "between" (*ra bar*) does not refer to spatial location but to the recognition that awareness is neither grasping at display nor separate from it. The instruction to "make not waver" (*mi 'gul bar byed*)—this is not effort to stabilize something unstable but recognition of what has never moved. Risk of spatialization: treating "in expanse's between" as literal location rather than recognition-description of non-duality.>

[5112-5120] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – WISDOM'S EXPERIENCE]
<The wisdom's experience (*shes nyams*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured analysis. The statement that wisdom's experience is mind, because (*shes nyams ni blo yin pas*)—this establishes that wisdom's experience is ordinary cognition (*sems*), not separate awareness (*rig pa*). The analysis: imagination, all (*kun brtags kun rdzob kyi rnam pa can*)—arising (*dran byed tha dad pa*), spontaneously (*tshu rol gyi rtog pas bsdus pa'i phyir*)—this indicates that conceptual imagination (*kun brtags*) arises spontaneously and gathers (*bsdus pa*) through conceptual reasoning (*rtog pa*). Risk of experientialism: treating "wisdom's experience" as attainment rather than recognition of ordinary cognition.>

[5119-5124] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – PLEASURE-DERIVING]
<The pleasure-deriving (*dga' bder shar*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. From practice (*bcos ma'i bsgoms pa las*), pleasure-arising (*dga' bde byung ba ni*)—this describes that pleasure arises from practice but is provisional. The worn-out analysis (*nyams 'gyur ba shas che la rags pa 'khrab pa'am glu gar byed 'dod pa 'byung bas chags zhen du song la*)—indicates that when pleasure is worn-out (*nyams 'gyur*), the pursuit of external things (*rags pa*, *glu gar*) is seen as meaningless. The statement this is pleasure-deriving (*'di ni dga' bder shar*)—also attaining self-power's pleasure (*rang dbang thob pa'i dga' bde*), without artificiality (*zhen med*), distinguishing by intellect after meditating (*bcos nas bsgoms pa dang* shes pa'i khyad yod pa ni*)—this is *upāya* for distinguishing recognition from artificial states. Risk of attainment-mentality: treating "pleasure" as achievement rather than recognition's natural display.>

[5120-5124] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THOUGHT-POISON]
<The thought-poison (*tshod*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured practice. The instruction that this (*'di la*), poison, inserted (*tshod byed na*)—exhausted, settled (*tshod btsugs nas sbas skungs byed pa'i*), like (*'dra ste*)—this indicates that poison (*tshod*) refers to conceptual thought (*rtog pa*) that obscures recognition; the antidote is to exhaust and settle it. The statement that thought (*don rtog pa'i*) time, without, seeing (*dus med de mthong ba*), self-prime, not-placed (*rang thog tu mi phebs so*)—this establishes that recognition (*mthong ba*) sees thought as primordial (*rang thog*) and never established (*mi phebs so*). Risk of technicism: treating "poison-inserting" as formal technique rather than recognition's capacity to see through delusion.>
