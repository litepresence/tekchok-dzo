[10722-10723] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Sixth position (10716-10717): "essence everywhere arise cause appearance variegated variety arise accept"—essence arising everywhere, accepting variegated variety appearance. Refutation (10718-10723): "variety that outer-appearance-to accept or, inner-consciousness-to accept or, those two gather-to accept"—is variety outer appearance, inner consciousness, or both gathered? First option (10723): "appearance variety like base one-only that also variety-as outer arise-of fault exist"—if variety like base is one-only, fault of variety as outer arising. This begins analysis of *sna tshogs* (variety/multiplicity) as basis characteristic. The problem: one basis cannot produce manifold variety without losing unity.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GROUNDLESS GROUND]
[COMPLETION OF REFUTATION]

<Six positions refuted across pages 256-260:
1. Spontaneous presence (256)
2. Not-determined (257)
3. Determined (258)
4. Changeable (259)
5. Whatever-acceptance (260)
6. Variegated (260-261)

The exhaustive refutation demonstrates that NO conceptual characterization of basis is tenable. This is not nihilism but *sgrub 'gag* (establishing-negation): the basis cannot be established through conceptuality. Yet it IS experienced as *rig pa* (awareness). The key line 10710: "this all direction-of projection only"—all these positions are *phyogs kyi spros pa* (directional projections), conceptual elaborations. The actual basis is *spros bral* (free from elaboration). The six pages of refutation (256-261) are *shes bya'i sgrib pa* (obscuration of knowables)—clearing intellectual obstacles so *nyon sgrib* (afflictive obscurations) can be addressed through practice. Risk: Intellectual satisfaction with refutation, missing the pointing beyond. The refutation is finger, not moon. Recognition occurs when logic exhausts itself.>
