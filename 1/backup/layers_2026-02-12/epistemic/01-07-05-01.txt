[RISK: PRACTICE ABANDONMENT]

<The systematic negation of "do," "meditate," "look," "seek" presents serious pedagogical risk. Readers may conclude all practice should cease, missing the context: these negations apply from recognition (*rtogs pa*), not from confusion (*ma rtogs*). Lines occur AFTER extensive instructions on guru reliance, empowerment, and samaya. The negation is completion, not rejection—like discarding raft after crossing river. Risk of premature "everything is primordially accomplished" without foundation of view recognition. The text balances: "wide spontaneous-arising in dwell" (recognition) vs. "meaning not-understand one's person" (non-recognition). The teaching is discriminating, not universal—offered to those with connection, wasted on those without.>
