[5640-5644] [SUPREME GURUS & LINEAGE HISTORY]
<The supreme gurus (*rnal 'byor ma bstan pa*)—these are the ultimate authorities. The gnad that such ones have (*rin po che*)—establishes their supreme status (*grub mchog*) and authority (*gnas yod*). The gnad that one (*gcig*) relies (*ltar*)—indicates singular focus. The statement that "those who properly practice" (*dam pa'i slar bzhin pa yin*)—this sets up *upāya* for proper transmission without deviation. The gnad that liberation (*'bras pa*)—this indicates the goal is actual liberation (*'bras pa*), not just correct understanding. The statement that liberation "from such supreme ones" (*de yang rnal 'byor ma bstan pa las 'bras pa*)—this establishes that liberation comes from the lineage, not independently achieved. Risk of devotion-based attainment: treating "liberation from gurus" as grace-based rather than recognition of one's own nature.>

[5645-5645] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The recognition-view teaching (*snang ba gzugs su rdzogs pa'i tshad*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The gnad that recognition sees (*mthong ba*)—this establishes direct recognition without intervening conceptualization. The statement that recognition's appearance (*snang ba*) becomes exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this indicates that when recognition recognizes, delusion (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*) is exhausted (*zad*). The gnad that recognition rests (*drangs pa las*)—this establishes the non-dual state after recognition. The gnad that "not two but one" (*gnyis pa ma yin gcig*)—this indicates the ultimate non-duality (*gnyis pa*) of recognition and display. Risk of view collapse: mixing *rigpa-side* non-dual recognition with *sems-side* dualistic teachings about practice states.>
