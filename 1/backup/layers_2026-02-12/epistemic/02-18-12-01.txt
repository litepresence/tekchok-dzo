[5242-5242] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL RESTING]
<The non-dual resting teaching (*de nas thig le lnga sbrel du snang ba ni ye shes lnga la byan tshud pa las byung ba'o*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Five-thigle (*thig le lnga*) non-dual (*sbrel du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba ni*) wisdom (*ye shes*) five (*lnga la*)—this establishes recognition rests (*las byung ba*) in the union (*byan tshud pa*) of five-thigle and wisdom (*ye shes lnga*). Risk of dualism: treating "five-thigle" and "wisdom" as separate entities rather than non-dual recognition.>

[5242-5250] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION GATHERING]
<The recognition-gathering teaching (*mngon sum gyi thig le dang 'brel lugs mi 'dra ste chung yod pa'i phyir ro*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Recognition's (*mngon sum*) thigle and connection (*'brel*) are not different (*mi 'dra ste*)—this establishes non-duality. The statement that therefore (*de phan chad ni nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba ste*)—recognition's experience (*nyams*) unfolds (*'phel gyi*) like ordinary mind's (*mnyam pa nyid*) appearance (*snang ba*)—this indicates that recognition's experience appears ordinary yet contains (*chung yod pa*) the gnad (*phyir ro*) of resting in non-duality. Risk of reification: treating "thigle" as substance rather than recognition-display mode.>

[5247-5268] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<Masterful analysis:
That itself rim-enclosing wall and individual main retinue appearance—Dharmakaya's purification completely pure measure-reached arising. This is rigpa-measure-reached appearance: preliminary times body's actions and doings' connection measure, afterward non-arising sign. That also: though appearing those appearances from preliminary antidotes etc. crucial point, labeled arisen, they are labelers of separation-result and purification-purifier cause-effect, not produced from that arising—wisdom self-existing radiance's stain obscurations purified through power of appearance. The Dzogchen view: these "appearances" are not produced by practice but revealed through recognition. Risk of attainment-mentality: believing "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) is a goal achieved through antidotes rather than recognition of ever-present wisdom.

The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Rigpa-measure-reached appearance: Sambhogakaya's marks examples clear; uncertain color rainbow from; five families father-mother appearing." And *Bstan bu*: "Likewise body up to: six and ten and five-three; unerringly Sambhogakaya." The individual nature particular explanation: measure-reached definitive terminology generally shown and measure-three particular explained—two. First: rigpa-measure-reached means ground-abiding rigpa manifestly became, path-channel entered, ground-appearance's self-radiance spontaneous present arising-door body-appearance, path-appearance near exhaustion, mandala complete. Measure: first half-body to body's mandala complete. Reached: from that transcended without remainder clearly appearing. These like full moon form—waxing-waning mandala complete, self-face incontrovertible.

Second, measure-three particular explained: outer appearance, inner body measure, secret rigpa measure. First: power-over appearance, pure realm clear-light complete... [continues]. The Dzogchen integration: "measure" is not quantity but recognition's fullness; "reached" is not destination but the realization that there was never anywhere to go.>

[5250-5258] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – ORDINARY MIND EXPERIENCE]
<The ordinary-mind-experience teaching (*de phan chad ni nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba ste*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for structured path. The gnad that therefore cognition (*rtog pa*)—this is *upāya* indicating that practitioners recognize (*'di dag ni sems kyi sngon 'gro'i dus na*) that experience is not subject to time (*dus na*). The statement that not separate (*tha dad par bslang ba de 'gags pa'i rtags yin no*)—this establishes that delusion (*rtog pa*) and emptiness appear separate but are not different. Risk of experientialism: treating "ordinary mind experience" as state to achieve rather than recognition-description.>

[5258-5267] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THIGLE NON-DUAL]
<The thigle-non-dual teaching (*re lde tsam las gru chad snang ba*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The gnad that object gathering (*yul gru tsam las mthong tshad do*)—this indicates that when recognition (*mthong*) sees (*gru tsam la*) the object (*yul*), exhaustion (*tshad do*) occurs. The gnad that separation (*zhes pa dang*)—this is *upāya*: recognition (*rang byung gi rgyud las*) arises (*las*) from vessel-hook-continuum (*lu gu rgyud*). Risk of substantialism: treating "vessel-hook-continuum" as anatomical structure rather than recognition-display continuum.>

[5267-5268] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION SEEING]
<The recognition-seeing teaching (*rang ngo mthong bas 'di ltar ro*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Recognition (*rang ngo*) seeing (*mthong bas*) this (*'di ltar ro*)—this establishes that recognition (*mthong ba*) sees directly (*'di ltar*) and realizes (*ro*) the gnad. The statement that wisdom (*kha dog lnga yi 'od*)—wisdom's (*kha dog*) five (*lnga yi*) self-resonance (*'od kyi yang*)—this indicates that wisdom's luminosity (*'od*) also (*yang*) flows. The gnad that recognition (*yar mtshams las ni sor bzhi las*)—this is *upāya* for recognition to rest in recognition (*yar mtshams las ni*). Risk of reification: treating "five-lights" as external illumination rather than awareness's own luminosity.>
