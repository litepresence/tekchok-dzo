[4916-4919] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The fourfold extensive explanation (*gnyis pa so so'i rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa*) of individual natures operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The fourfold structure: (1) direct appearance (*chos nyid mngon sum*); (2) experience-increase (*nyams gong 'phel*); (3) rigpa-measure-reached (*rig pa tshad phebs*); (4) dharmata-exhaustion-appearance (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba rgyas par bshad pa'o*). The detailed analysis of direct appearance (*dang po la gnyis te*) includes two aspects: (1) general connection-establishment (*mngon sum spyi'i 'brel dgod pa dang*)—recognizing the fundamental connection between appearance and awareness; (2) individual characteristic ascertainment (*rang gi mtshan nyid dngos gzung ba'o*)—recognizing the unique characteristics of each appearance. The four types of direct appearance: (1) *dang po ni spyir mngon sum*—conventional direct appearance (*kun rdzob tha snyad la grags pa'i mngon sum*), which appears as five sense-objects (*dbang po'i mngon sum gzugs sogs yul lnga snang ba'i rang bzhin*); (2) *yid kyi mngon sum*—mental direct appearance (*nyid kyi mngon sum*), which appears as conceptual certainty in conceptual object (*yid kyi mngon sum yul nye bar spyod pa rgyu mtshan nges pa'i rtog yul na snang ba*); (3) *rang rig pa'i mngon sum*—self-awareness direct appearance (*rang rig pa'i mngon sum*), which experiences internal bliss/suffering (*nang du bde sdug la sogs myong ba ces pa'i snang ba*); (4) *rnal 'byor gyi mngon sum*—yogic direct appearance, which directly encounters suchness (*nyid kyi don nye bar mjal ba de kho na nyid*), entering suchness, individual correct rigpa and its appearance-object non-dual (*so so yang dag pa'i rig pa dang de'i snang yul gnyis su med pa*), free from grasping-grasped experience certainty (*'dzin dang bral bar myong ba'i nges pa ste*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of direct appearance classification: treating these "four types" as rigid categories rather than pedagogical presentation. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all four "direct appearances" are conventional designations (*tha snyad*) for what is ultimately single awareness-display (*rang snang*). The phrase "conventional direct appearance" (*kun rdzob tha snyad la grags pa'i mngon sum*) indicates that even "direct appearance" is ultimately conventional when spoken of as "type"—actual recognition transcends all classification. The phrase "self-awareness direct appearance" refers to awareness's self-knowledge (*rang rig*)—not separate knower and known. The phrase "yogic direct appearance" refers to recognition through yoga (union) of samsara-nirvana (*'khor 'das*), not a special achievement beyond ordinary experience. The definitive view transcends even these four: direct appearance is not "seen" (*mthong ba*) but recognized as awareness's own nature (*rang ngo*).>

[4920-4927] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The definitive teaching on relationship (*rnam 'grel*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The opening statement—from all phenomena, mind gathered and within that, self-nature ego-less (*thams cad las ni sems bsdus nas nang gi bdag nyid g.yo med par*)—establishes definitive ground: all dharmas are mind-display; within that display, self-nature is ego-less, not something to establish. The statement that seeing with eyes the body, and intention causes self-grasping's intention to arise (*gnas na'ang mig gis gzugs dag ni mthong ba'i blo de dbang skyes yin*)—this is *instructional provisionality* describing how ordinary cognition operates, not the definitive mode. The instruction that intention should settle into expanse (*don dam dbyings la 'jal ba'i mngon sum*) is skillful means (*upāya*) for redirecting self-grasping toward recognition. The crucial gnad: awareness's essence is dharmata itself (*rig pa'i ngo bo chos nyid snying ga na yod par nges te*)—this establishes that awareness is not some phenomenon but the nature of all phenomena. Risk of intellectualization: treating "mind gathering" as mental process rather than recognizing awareness's primordial state.>

[4927-4943] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-RESONANCE]
<The self-resonance (*rang gdangs*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The description that from its self-resonance, heart (*de'i rang gdangs snying nas*) connecting with eyes outer self-display and light-resonance (*mig tu 'brel ba'i phyir nyi ma dang 'od zer bzhin rgyu 'bras nges pa*)—this establishes that recognition is aware of its own display as itself (*rang snang*), not subject-object relationship. The "outer self-display" (*nyi ma*) refers to awareness's capacity to manifest; "light-resonance" (*'od zer*) refers to luminous quality. The citation from *Rang Byung* continues: from appearance and cessation two (*'jig rten pa dang 'das pa gnyis las 'di ni*) this is cessation-gnosis (*'das pa'i mngon sum mo*). Risk of reification: treating "self-resonance" and "light-resonance" as subtle energies to cultivate rather than descriptions of awareness's self-knowing quality.>

[4943-4953] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR TEACHINGS]
<The four-teaching presentation (*chos nyid kyi sgra nye bar sbyar ba la bzhi las*) operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured analysis. The four teachings are: (1) circle with phenomena (*'khor ba la chos*)—teaching within cyclic existence; (2) meditation (*myang 'das chos nyid*)—teaching on passing beyond; (3) emptiness with phenomena (*stong pa la chos nyid*)—teaching on emptiness of dharmas; (4) no gnad (*gnad med pas mi grol ba la chos*)—teaching on liberation. The statement that therefore exists liberation (*yod pas grol nges pas chos nyid du grags pa'i 'di chos nyid do*)—this is definitive declaration: liberation is not through gnad-accomplishment but through recognizing chos nyid. The gnad that awareness-grasping is non-separated (*rig pa la chos nyid du grags pa'i gnyis ka dbyer med du 'dod pa'o*) establishes that awareness never grasps at phenomena as other. Risk of substantialism: treating "four teachings" as separate doctrines rather than recognition-descriptions from different angles.>

[4953-4965] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – AFFLICTION-OBJECT]
<The affliction (*mngon pa*) analysis operates from two perspectives. First, definitive: affliction is affliction's object (*dbang po'i spyod yul la dngos su bltar yod pa'o*)—this describes delusion's function as grasping at phenomena as truly existent. Second, provisional: also not relying on intellect (*de'ang yid dpyod la ma ltos pa ste*) whenever wisdom analyzes (*yid dpyod kyi shes rab kyis gang du btsal yang rnyed pa'i dus med do*)—this is *upāya* describing the limitation of intellect: wisdom never finds anything to eliminate because nothing truly exists to eliminate. The statement that not possessing mind and light, possessing light is not (*tshol mkhan mig can ma yin 'od gsal gzugs can ma yin pa'i phyir te*)—this operates from *sems-side* to dispel clinging to form. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "nothing to eliminate" as mere absence rather than recognition of primordial state.>

[4954-4960] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – GNAD PRESENTATION]
<The definitive teaching on gnad (*gnad*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The opening gnad—within mind, dharmata-object (*nang du chos nyid yul gyi gnad*)—establishes that recognition's relationship to its own display (*chos nyid*) is not subject-object relationship but self-recognition. The gnad of practice's door (*'char byed sgo'i gnad*)—the path to enter. This is *instructional provisionality* describing how recognition recognizes itself through entering into practice. Risk of gnoblification: treating "gnad" as mystical point rather than recognition-key.>

[4960-4969] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – WIND-RESTING]
<The wind-resting (*rlung gi gnas pa'i gnad*) teaching operates from *sems-side* pedagogy for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The three gnads: (1) wind's dwelling-place (*rlung gi gnas pa'i gnad*)—where awareness abides; (2) path-eliminated by three (*lam bsal ba dang*)—what path eliminates; (3) resting, meditation (*gsang bar goms pa*) and practicing-capacity's sequence (*tshad kyi rim pa*)—how recognition stabilizes. The meditation sequences: meditation's sequence (*smin pa rtags kyi rim pa*), worn-out sequence (*mthar thug zad pa'i rim pa*), and three practicing-holding together (*gsum gyis tshad gzung ba dang*)—these are structural descriptions, not temporal stages. Risk of technicism: treating "meditation sequences" as graduated practices rather than recognition-descriptions.>

[4965-4984] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – FRAGILITY]
<The analysis of fragile (*phra ba rdul phran dang rags pa*) phenomena operating from definitive *rigpa-side* establishes that phenomena appear as fragile, impermanent, and without essence but are grasped at as having self-nature (*dngos po rang mtshan du 'di med pa'i phyir*). The teaching that from expanse (*sdud pa las*) wisdom analyzes (*shes rab kyis ni brtags na*) the affliction's basis (*phung po'i gting mi rnyed*)—this indicates that recognition sees through phenomena's lack of essence, it does not eliminate anything. The statement that light-display is not having form-possessing (*'od gsal gyi snang ba 'di tha snyad la grags pa'i gzugs can ma yin te*)—this is definitive: awareness's display never possesses form as inherent quality. Risk of view collapse: mixing sutric negation ("phenomena are fragile") with Dzogchen recognition ("awareness sees through lack of essence")—the former is provisional, the latter is definitive.>

[4969-4981] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE BODIES]
<The three-body teaching (*sku gsum*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that lamaless, appearing (*bla na med par snang ba'o*)—establishes that recognition's display is self-manifesting, not requiring external teacher. The citation from *Rang Byung*: resting thigle (*smin pa thig le*) and accomplishment by three, body, three (*rdzogs pa sku dang gsum gyis 'bras bu rdzogs pa'i phyir*)—this indicates that three kayas are not sequential attainments but simultaneous recognition-aspects. Three aspects determined (*gsum tshan bzhir nges pas gsum zhes bya'o*) refers to recognition's three modes of display. The statement that also, therefore (*yang na*) essence-body's self-resonance inner, appearance-awareness empty (*chos sku'i rang gdangs nang myong ba rig stong*)—establishes that essence-body (*chos sku*) is awareness's empty inner display. Risk of triplication: treating "three bodies" as separate entities rather than aspects of single recognition.>

[4981-4989] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE BODIES CONTINUED]
<The continuation of three-body analysis operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The description of Sambhogakaya-body's self-resonance outer, light-resonance clearly appearing, wisdom self-resonance (*longs sku'i rang gdangs 'od lnga phyir gsal ba ye shes rang gsal*)—establishes that enjoyment-body is recognition's luminous outer display. The emanation-body's self-resonance, liberating, difference-free wisdom-analysis three (*sprul sku'i rang gdangs shar grol ris med shes rab kyi rtsal dang bcas pa gsum la ltos nas gsum zhes bya'o*)—establishes that emanation-body (*sprul sku*) liberates through recognition's display. The gnad that basis by three established (*de'ang gzhi gsum gyis gzhi bcas pas dngos po la tha dad med pa'i gnad dang*)—this is definitive: recognition-basis is not established by three kayas but manifests as them. Risk of kāya trinitarianism: treating "three bodies" as ontologically distinct rather than recognition's three modes of display.>

[4984-5008] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE POINTS]
<The three-points gnad (*lus ngag yi gsum gyi gnad gsum gyis gzhi bca' ba*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The instruction that body, speech, and mind's three points establish the basis (*gzhi bca' ba*)—this is not to create basis but to recognize that recognition's expression through body-speech-mind is already the basis. The statement therefore (*phyir ro*)—form-possessing (*gzugs can*) is breaking, spoiling (*gzhig cing gzhom rung du yod de gzugs kyi mtshan nyid de yin pa'i phyir ro*)—establishes that phenomena's apparent self-nature is their fragility, not an intrinsic quality. The three points are recognition-coordinates, not techniques to apply. The gnad: form-possessing's essence is that (*gzugs kyi mtshan nyid de yin pa'i phyir ro*)—points to recognition of what form actually is (display) versus what it appears to be (possessing essence). Risk of technicism: treating "three points" as structural exercises rather than recognition-descriptions.>

[4984-4989] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – UNBORN-GNOSIS]
<The Unborn-Gnosis (*yi ge med pa*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The statement that Unborn-Gnosis, fully-awakening by wisdom (*sangs rgyas kun gyi mngon sum*)—establishes that recognition is wisdom's own awakening, not through accumulation. The instruction to see formless-emptiness's pure display (*yul med rnam par dag pa'i snang ba mthong*)—this is *upāya* pointing to recognition's capacity to see beyond form. The citation from *Vajra* (*sgyu 'phrul las*) and Precious-One (*nor bu rin chen*)—this connects to tantras that establish the definitive path. Risk of intellectualization: treating "seeing formless-emptiness" as visual meditation rather than recognizing awareness's formless nature.>

[4989-4995] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – PATH PRACTICE FRUITION]
<The threefold path-practice-fruition teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for structured recognition. The teaching: (1) path, three eliminated obstructions (*lam gsum gyis gegs bsal bas 'gro lam la nye ring med pa dang*)—path eliminates obstacles directly, no distance; (2) practice, three placed in ground, no-obstructions (*tshad gsum gyis tshad la phab pas 'dra min dang chal chol med pa dang*)—practice is grounded, no blocking; (3) fruition, three exhausted fully (*'bras bu gsum gyis zad sar bskyal bas*)—fruition is exhaustion of delusion, not addition. The statement that not-abiding, not-changing (*yin min dang tshom med pas*)—this indicates that recognition never enters or changes. Risk of sequentialism: treating "path-practice-fruition" as chronological progression rather than simultaneous recognition-aspects.>

[4989-5006] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE BODIES DISPLAY]
<The teaching that The Fully-Awakening all's cognition (*sangs rgyas kun gyi mngon sum pa*) sees three bodies' display (*sku gsum gyi snang ba mthong ba*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation from *Precious-One, completely-exhausted* (*rin po che rnam par brtsegs pa'i rgyud las*) seeing gnosis (*mngon zhes bya ba mthong ba la*)—this establishes that the three bodies are not attained separately but are seen together as single recognition-display. The statement that three, spheres (*gsum zhes bya ba sku gsum gyi zhing khams gtan la phebs pa'o*)—refers to recognition's capacity to see all dimensions simultaneously. Risk of substantialism: treating "three bodies" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition's display modes.>

[4995-5006] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – MALICIOUS TIME]
<The malicious-time (*tha mal pa'i dus*) description operates from *sems-side* provisional teaching on experience-quality. The teaching: displeased not-displeased, suffering, three appearing (*dga' mi dga' btang snyom gsum mthong bas bde sdug bar ma gsum 'char ba*)—this is *upāya* describing how ordinary cognition (*sems*) experiences samsara: both pleasure and suffering appear as three modes. The teacher's experience (*bla ma'i gdams pa*) citation—dharmata's display, within that, mind-awareness (*dbyings rig chos gsum mngon par mthong bas*)—this is definitive recognition: when teacher recognizes dharmata-display, awareness-cognition are seen as non-dual. The gnad of cognition-eliminated (*chos nyid mngon sum la yid dpyod tshig gi sgro gdags su med pa'i gnad*)—establishes that intellect (*yid dpyod*) cannot harm recognition. Risk of suffering-reification: treating "three sufferings" as ontological states rather than descriptions of ordinary experience.>

[5006-5020] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – MEDITATION TIME]
<The meditation-time (*goms pa'i dus na*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that whenever thigle, body, three sees (*'od thig le sku gsum mthong bas 'khrul ba'i snang ba rang 'gags pa'i gnad*)—establishes that recognition sees through delusion's apparent display directly. The gnad that delusion's apparent display (*'khrul ba'i snang ba*) spontaneously liberates (*rang 'gags pa'i gnad*) indicates that delusion was never truly established. The practice-time teaching—therefore clear light-emptiness-pleasure three, cognition-empty-appearing (*tshad du phyin pas dus na gsal ba stong pa bde ba gsum mngon par mthong bas*)—establishes that when recognition recognizes itself, the three qualities (clear light, emptiness, pleasure) appear as one taste. The final statement—therefore dharmata-cognition-empty-appearing (*chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba'i ngo bo dbyings rig 'od gsal snang ba ste*)—definitively establishes that dharmata and cognition's empty-appearing are not separate. Risk of stage-concretization: treating "clear light, emptiness, pleasure" as sequential stages rather than simultaneous recognition-manifestations.>

[5006-5020] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – GNAD-LIBERATION]
<The gnad-teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement of purpose (*dgos pa ni*): by this gnad, not obscured, liberation (*gnad 'dis gol sgrib med par grol te*)—this establishes that liberation is through recognition-key (*gnad*), not through effort. From that (*de nyid las*), if dharmata-cognition, no gnad (*chos nyid mngon sum gnad med na*)—this indicates that when recognition recognizes dharmata directly, there is no separate "gnad" to apply. The instruction that not having eyes, going to the sky (*mig med g.yang khar phyin pa 'dra*)—this is *upāya* describing recognition's lack of dependence on sensory faculties. Risk of gnad-objectification: treating "gnad" as some special technique rather than recognition-key.>

[5020-5034] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE VIEW-STANCES]
<The three view-stance (*lta stangs gsum*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured approach. The citation from *Thal 'Gyur*: suffering's grasping's destruction-impossible (*rgyang zhags 'gul ba med pa gnad*)—this is the definitive teaching that suffering cannot be destroyed because it never truly existed. The instruction to distinguish (*sbyar*) and that Unborn-Gnosis (*yi ge med pa las*) eyes not needing (*mig ni rab tu gnan bya ste*)—this is provisional: eyes don't need to "not see" because recognition never relies on them. From eyes side, expanse's self-born (*mig zur nyid las dbyings 'byung bas*)—this indicates that recognition's capacity to see is intrinsic to awareness, not acquired. Risk of view collapse: mixing definitive statement "suffering's destruction-impossible" with provisional "eyes not needing"—the former is ontological, latter is pedagogical.>
