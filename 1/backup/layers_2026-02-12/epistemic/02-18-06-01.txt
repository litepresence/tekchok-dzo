<The detailed instruction on door-gnad—the first of the three gnads—operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The opening statement: ordinary seeing-mode (*tha mal pa'i lta lugs*) does not dawn wisdom (*ye shes mi 'char bas*), therefore train in three-kaya seeing-modes (*sku gsum gyi gzigs stang gsum la bslab*). This establishes that ordinary perception is not wrong but incomplete for recognition; the three-kaya seeing-modes are not new ways to see but recognition of how awareness has always seen. The *Dpal nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud* (Glorious Space-Equal Tantra) citation describes three kayas' functions: (1) Dharmakaya seeing-mode (*chos kyi sku yi gzigs stangs*)—pressing the three realms' samsara (*khams gsum 'khor ba spyibs na 'don*), meaning seeing all samsara as already pressed into dharmata; (2) Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*)—samsara's basis not destroyed (*srid pa'i gzhi ma 'jig*), indicating that recognition sees without destroying appearances; (3) Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*)—liberating into buddha-fields (*sangs rgyas zhing du sgrol*), indicating manifestation-liberation. Additional citations: *Yi ge med pa* (Scripture Without Letters): "Eye is examined in space-element" (*mig ni nam mkha'i khams su brtag*), indicating that the eye itself is examined as space-expanse; *Gsang ba sgra rgyud* (Secret Sound Tantra): three seeing-modes—casting down, turning back, and glancing (*phab dang zlog dang zur gyis ni gzigs stangs rnam pa gsum du grags*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of visualization misunderstanding: treating "three-kaya seeing" as visualizations of forms to see rather than recognition of awareness's own seeing. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these "modes" are not sequential practices but descriptions of how recognition sees: all three kayas are simultaneously present in recognition.>

<The detailed application of three-kaya seeing based on practitioner's eye-quality operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The clarification—casting down Nirmanakaya awakening (*sprul sku phab nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at trainees (*gdul bya la gzigs la*); glancing at Sambhogakaya awakening (*longs sku la zur gzigs nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at realms (*zhing khams la gzigs pa*); turning back Dharmakaya awakening (*chos sku bzlog nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at basis (*gzhi la gzigs pa'o*)—indicates that each kaya-emphasis serves different pedagogical purpose: (1) Nirmanakaya casting-down (*phab*) directs gaze downward toward beings needing guidance; (2) Sambhogakaya glancing (*zur*) directs gaze sideways toward pure realms; (3) Dharmakaya turning-back (*bzlog*) directs gaze inward toward the basis. The instruction for different eye-qualities: (1) For those with poor eye-sight (*mig shas ngan pa*), following Nirmanakaya seeing-mode prevents eye-obscuration (*mig mi 'grib pa'i dgos pa yod*); (2) For those with eye-fault (*mig la skyon chags*), following Sambhogakaya mode makes eye clear (*mig gsal ba'i dgos pa yod*); (3) For those with good eye-sight (*mig shas bzang*), following Dharmakaya mode quickly places appearance onto measure (*myur du snang ba tshad la phebs pa'i dgos pa yod*). The definitive statement: "If not moving from those, three eyes certainly enter into interior (*de dag las ma g.yos na spyan gsum khong du chud par nges te*)"—establishes that without wavering from these modes, recognition occurs. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of ability-type determinism: treating eye-quality as fixed category rather than recognition-condition. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "three eyes entering interior" refers to recognition's self-introduction, not physical eye-training. The phrase "Dharmakaya has dharmata-eye" (*chos sku la chos nyid kyi spyan yod pas*) indicates that Dharmakaya seeing is recognizing dharmata, not looking at something called dharmata.>

<The threefold blessing-bestowal (*byin rlabs*) structure marks definitive Dzogchen transmission. The statement: through Dharmakaya's blessing (*de'i byin rlabs kyis*), wisdom is directly seen (*ye shes dngos su mthong bas*)—definite in this (*'di nyid la thag chod*); through Sambhogakaya's blessing, self-clarity is seen (*de'i byin rlabs kyis rang gsal du mthong bas*)—knowledge expands (*mkhyen pa rgyas*); through Nirmanakaya's blessing, seeing without sound-words (*de'i byin rlabs kyis sgra tshig dang bral bar mthong bas*)—all hearing-contemplating-mediating, dharmata's meaning dawns from within (*thos bsam sgom pa la rag ma lus par chos nyid kyi don khong nas 'char ro*). This is not sequential reception but simultaneous dimensions of single recognition. The "blessing" (*byin rlabs*) is not external infusion but the collapse of apparent separation between recognizer and recognized: when recognition occurs, it is not that something new appears but that what has always been present is recognized. The three eyes (*spyan gsum*) viewing: (1) Dharmata's eye turning upward (*chos nyid kyi spyan gyen la bzlog pas*) clears latencies downward (*bag chags thur la sel ba'i gnad*), indicating that transcending dualistic gaze naturally clears habitual patterns; (2) Wisdom's corner looking evenly (*ye shes kyi zur la mnyam por bltas pas*) balances saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as same taste (*'khor 'das ro mnyam du bsre ba'i gnad*), indicating that recognition sees samsara and nirvana as not two; (3) Prajñā's looking downward (*shes rab kyis phab nas bltas pas*) actually settles wisdom-appearance (*ye shes kyi snang ba dngos su 'bebs pa'i gnad*), indicating that wisdom-display naturally manifests without effort. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of blessing reification: treating "blessing" as external power transmission rather than recognition of what has always been present.>

[4728-4733] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE EYES]
<The determination of three seeing-modes (*gzigs stangs gsum*) operates from *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for different practitioner capacities. The question: "What makes three definite?" (*gzigs stangs gsum du nges pa ci yin zhe na*). The answer: lazy ones need Sambhogakaya (*le lo can la longs sku*), diligent ones Nirmanakaya (*brtson 'grus can la sprul sku*), equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture (*btang snyoms can la chos sku'i gzigs stangs*), therefore three are definite (*shis pas na gsum du nges so*). This establishes that the three seeing-modes are not sequential stages but skillful-means matching practitioner's predominant capacity (*dbang po*). The definition (*nges tshig*): by seeing, looking at dharmata (*gzigs pas chos nyid la gzigs pas*), obscurations are exhausted (*rnam dag sgrib pa zad pa'o*); by posture (*stangs kyis*), one liberates from samsara (*'khor ba las grol bar byed pa'o*). The phrase "obscurations exhausted" (*sgrib pa zad pa*) refers to recognition-elimination: when recognition sees dharmata, obscurations are not removed but recognized as never having existed. The phrase "liberates from samsara" (*'khor ba las grol*) refers to recognition-liberation: samsara is not exited but recognized as self-liberated display (*rang grol). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of capacity determinism: treating "lazy," "diligent," and "equanimous" as fixed categories rather than recognition-condition descriptions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all three seeing-modes are ultimately pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The three modes are different pedagogical approaches for different habitual patterns, not hierarchical stages of attainment.>

[4734-4742] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The detailed explanation of object-gnad (*yul gyi gnad*) operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The opening statement: object-gnad is (1) outer expanse's object (*phyi'i dbyings kyi yul*)—empty space free from clouds (*nam mkha' stong pa sprin dang bral ba*); (2) inner expanse's object (*nang gi dbyings kyi yul*)—the treasury between eyebrows (*smin mtshams kyi mdzod spu*)—expanse-appearance blue and the five radiating from it (*dbyings snang mthing ga dang de las mched pa rnam lnga'i rang gdangs*). The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Expanse is outer and inner—outer holds cloud-free sky (*phyi ni sprin bral mkha' la 'dzin*); when dust-rain clears, wise ones press the gnad (*bag rdul char gyis dengs dus su mkhas pa mngon gsum gnad gzir dang*); inner lamp makes path (*nang gi sgron ma lam du bya'o*)." This establishes the structure: (1) Outer object: sky without clouds—pure awareness-expanse; (2) Inner object: lamp between eyebrows—subtle energy focus; (3) The "pressing gnad" (*gnad gzir*) occurs when coarse defilements clear, not through effort. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of anatomical literalism: treating "treasury between eyebrows" as literal anatomical location rather than recognition-coordinate. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" (*phyi*) and "inner" (*nang*) are conventional designations, not actual separate spaces: both refer to dimensions of single awareness. The phrase "expanse-appearance blue and five radiating" (*dbyings snang mthing ga dang de las mched pa rnam lnga'i rang gdangs*) indicates the natural display of awareness as five colors, not visualizations to create.>

[4743-4746] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The definitive clarification of outer and inner objects operates from *rigpa-side* pointing to recognition's non-duality. The explanation: outer is the object where rigpa dawns (*phyi rig pa 'char ba'i yul yin la*), inner is the object where experience increases (*nang nyams 'phel ba'i yul te*); because rigpa and experience are non-dual (*rig pa dang nyams gnyis su med pa las*), it is called "saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixed" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa zhes bya'o*). This establishes that outer and inner are not separate: the object of recognition (*yul*) is not something other than recognition (*rig pa*) and experience (*nyams*). The warning: placing object on coarse earth-water-fire--air objects (*sa chu me rlung gi dngos po rags pa la yul du gtad pas*) will not liberate (*mi grol te*)—first, appearance does not want to dawn (*dang po snang ba 'char du mi 'dod*); later, when dawning, even knowing as coarse objects (*phyis shar dus gtan kyang dngos po rags pa ltar shes pa*), produces agreement with that (*de dang mthun pa skye bas*), so emptiness-unthinkable experience does not dawn from within (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams nang nas mi 'char la*). This is crucial: if one grasps at coarse physical objects as the object of gnad, recognition cannot occur because coarse objects are already solidified by dualistic perception. The phrase "emptiness-unthinkable experience" (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams*) refers to the direct recognition beyond concept (*rtog pa*) of emptiness (*stong nyid*). Risk of object-gnad dualism: treating "object" (*yul*) as something external to recognize rather than awareness's own display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" and "inner" are pedagogical designations pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The "mixing" of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*) is not a mixing of two separate things but the recognition that they were never truly separate.>
