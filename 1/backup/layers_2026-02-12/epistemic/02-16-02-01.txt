[1036-1041] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – NIRMĀṆAKĀYA AS BENEFIT-PERFECTION]
Longchenpa presents Nirmāṇakāya (*sprul sku*) as "tamed's two benefits perfected accomplishing" (*gdul bya'i don gnyis rdzogs par byed pa*). Citation: "Nirmāṇakāya body's marks: accomplishing completing deeds, two forms desired."

[CONTEXT] KĀYA TRIAD COMPLETION: The three-kāya structure concludes with Nirmāṇakāya as spontaneous benefit-activity. Unlike Sarma (*gsar ma*) presentations where Nirmāṇakāya represents "form body" (*gzugs sku*) as distinct from "truth body" (*chos sku*), Longchenpa's *snying thig* view asserts Nirmāṇakāya as Dharmakāya's self-recognition appearing as other-benefit (*gzhan don*). The "two benefits" (*don gnyis*)—self-benefit (*rang don*) and other-benefit (*gzhan don*)—are not sequential achievements but simultaneous perfections. This reflects the *'bras bu'i theg pa* (Result Vehicle) view that fruition is already-complete, not produced.

Epistemic precision: Nirmāṇakāya is not "vehicle for benefit" but spontaneous expression of perfected activity. Risk: Functionalism—viewing Nirmāṇakāya merely as method for benefiting beings, rather than recognizing inseparability from Dharmakāya's nature.

[1042-1065] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-APPEARANCE EMANATION]
Generally divisions: nature-emanation (*rang bzhin sprul pa*), taming-emanation (*'gro 'dul sprul pa*), but here relying on two-benefits' perfection: completing-deeds Nirmāṇakāya (*bya ba rdzogs pa'i sprul sku*) and doing-deeds Nirmāṇakāya (*bya ba byed pa'i sprul sku*). Self-benefit spontaneously accomplished completing-deeds Nirmāṇakāya—this life or bardo self-appearance spontaneous gate perfected, from impure gate six beings self-appearance dawned, three conjunctions' (*sbyor gsum*) emanations benefit done. Six families self-appearance merely recognized, dharmadhātu peace. Self-appearance's samsāra must be emptied because confused-appearance must be emptied.

[CONTEXT] BARDO DOCTRINE: The reference to "this life or bardo" (*tshe 'dam bar do*) invokes the *snying thig* teaching on recognizing self-appearance during the intermediate state (*bar do*). "Three conjunctions" refers to the simultaneous presence of location (*gnas*), teacher (*ston pa*), and retinue (*'khor*) in pure vision. The instruction that "self-appearance's samsāra must be emptied" distinguishes Dzogchen from eternalist views—samsāra is not ultimately real but must be recognized as empty display.

Generally: "May exhausted and emptied samsāra three lower realms"; generating mind to liberate all beings. Particularly in bardo, emanation able-unable and having emanated becoming Buddha—all depends on self-appearance spontaneous gate when six beings' locations appear, there self-appearance's emptiness self-appearance, teachings and so on benefit done. Therefore samsāra-appearance all emptied, spontaneous gate purified, nirvāṇa dharmadhātu dissolved—called "Buddha's parinirvāṇa." This is extremely important vital-point for all with prajna.

Risks: View collapse—reducing to lower vehicle gradual accomplishment; Soteriological confusion—misunderstanding "emptying samsāra" as nihilistic destruction rather than recognition of never-having-been-established.
