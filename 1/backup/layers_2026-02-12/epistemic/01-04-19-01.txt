[3994-4003] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The three subsystems progressively: (1) delusion root cut therefore samsara/nirvana view reversed—never experienced delusion (*'khrul ma myong*) from primordial; (2) delusion self-removed therefore non-deluded dharmatā recognized—affliction basis emptied, virtue/non-virtue continuum severed; (3) delusion-basis pierced therefore delusion-samsara continuum severed—falling/basis empty, fabrication not found, basis examined. The phrase *'khrul ma 'khrul las 'das* (transcended delusion/non-delusion) indicates recognition beyond both delusion and its correction.>

[4005-4015] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The *thig le rang gnad la phab pa* (drop established in self-essential-point) system's essence as singularly unique (*nyag gcig*), free from elaborations, without partiality—nature as non-multiple therefore dharmatā universally pervading beyond conceptual construction words; characteristics as introduction (*ngo sprod*) therefore confidence completely determined. This is *man ngag gi sde* (instruction series) pointing-out: direct introduction rather than philosophical argument. The division into *snyan rgyud* (oral/ear tantra) and *bshad rgyud* (explanation tantra) distinguishes transmission modes, not ontological categories.>

[4016-4029] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<The *bshad rgyud* (explanation tantra) fourfold cycle classification: outer (*phyi skor*)—afflictions without abandonment therefore five poisons (*dug lnga*) as path; inner (*nang skor*)—not material therefore signless dharmatā; secret (*gsang skor*)—introduction and realization obtained simultaneously therefore not dependent on hearing/contemplation/meditation (*thos bsam sgom gsum*); unsurpassed secret (*gsang ba bla na med pa'i skor*)—not depending on words therefore wisdom completely sufficient. These are progressive subtlety classifications for different capacities, not hierarchical truths.>

[4030-4039] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The three nature-characteristic correlations in secret cycles: breath-ceased and Buddhahood simultaneous therefore not dependent on effort/accomplishment or habituation-power; Buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneous therefore not dependent on accumulations/merit. This is *lhun grub* (spontaneous accomplishment) framing—recognition's natural qualities (*yon tan*) are not cultivated but self-manifest. The phrase *thabs dang shes rab* (means and wisdom) simultaneous indicates non-dual method-view, not sequential cultivation.>

[4040-4046] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The unsurpassed secret (*gsang ba bla na med pa*) essence: not depending on words (*tshig la ma brten pa*) therefore wisdom (*shes rab*) completely self-sufficient. Nature directly seen (*mngon sum du mthong ba*) therefore not abiding in investigative grasping view (*yid dpyod 'dzin pa'i lta ba*). Four appearances reaching measure (*snang ba bzhi tshad du phebs pa*)—this is the four visions (*snang ba bzhi*) of Dzogchen path, culminating in *'bras bu* (result) not dependent on three kāyas/five wisdoms because intrinsic perfection precedes result-structuring.>

[4047-4085] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The summary citation from *Thal 'gyur* (Consequence/Prasanga) presents Dzogchen textual statistics: nine spaces (*klong dgu*), 21,000 sections (*bam po*), three categories (*sde gsum*), 35,000 chapters (*le'u*), etc. These numbers encode completeness, not literal bibliographic data. The reconvergence into three series (*sems sde*, *klong sde*, *man ngag gi sde*) demonstrates Longchenpa's hermeneutical framework: all Dzogchen teachings organize by pedagogical approach—mind (*sems*), space (*klong*), or instruction (*man ngag*) as entry points. The phrase *rdzogs pa chen po de dag* (those great perfections) indicates all enumerations point to single *chos nyid*, not competing systems.>

[4086-4113] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The progressive reconvergence (*bsdus*) statistics map the nine spaces onto the three series: *sems sde* into 5,000 named tantras; *klong sde* into 3,000 named tantras; *man ngag gi sde* into 12,000 named tantras. These enumerations encode pedagogical completeness, not literal bibliographic counts. The divisions—outer/inner/secret spaces, meditation with/without, fabricated liberation/settled liberation/precise liberation—demonstrate hermeneutical flexibility: same teachings viewed through different recognition modalities.>

[4114-4121] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<The *man ngag gi sde* (instruction series) reconvergence into three spaces: play unceasing (*rol pa 'gag pa med pa*), mind not unliberated (*blo la ma grol ba med pa*), essence without good/bad (*ngo bo la bzang ngan med pa*). These characterize *man ngag* approach: pointing directly to spontaneous presence without structured meditation. The statistics (21,000 chapters, etc.) culminate in threefold classification of essential-point gathering/seeing/knowing—progressive recognition deepening.>

[4122-4146] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The final reconvergence statistics complete the corpus organization: obstacles (*gags*) 1,500, essential points (*gnad*) 87 (*gzer bu*), threefold spheres (*'phyong*) of essential-point gathering/seeing/knowing. The classification into teaching (*bka'*) and treatise (*bstan bcos*), then treatise into tantra/scripture/instruction, demonstrates Nyingma textual hierarchy. The fourfold *la bzla ba* (recitation/penetration) categories—meaning instruction, abiding-mode nature, philosophical words, samsara/nirvana nondual—provide progressive access points to same recognition.>

[4147-4171] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<Chapter transition: "Thus having established the general dharma arrangement, now explaining the unsurpassed vehicle particularly." This marks shift from Dzogchen doxography to tantric framework. The definition of tantra (*rgyud*) as "awareness and that which establishes it definitively, great secret adding/subtracting impossible, direct certainty" introduces tantric terminology. The etymology (*nges tshig*) as "continuous (*rgyud*) because showing family/lineage (*rigs*), producing birth in that family" indicates *rgyud* (tantra) as transformative continuity, not merely textual genre.>
