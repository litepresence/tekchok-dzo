[1582] The essential nature of basis and aggregates, wherein all conditioned phenomena are gathered and arranged as the support for cyclic existence and liberation alike.
[1583] The distinctive characteristics of the forms and sense-sources, which serve as the gateways through which consciousness engages with its objects.
[1584] The essential nature of the powers that grasp and apprehend, being the active forces that dominate their respective spheres of engagement.
[1585] The various forms of objects and their possessors, comprising the entire field of what is grasped and that which grasps.
[1586] First, regarding the elements: Due to their vast and extensive meaning, embracing all that can be known and experienced, these are termed "elements."
[1587] If one divides them for the purpose of clear understanding:
[1588] There are those gathered and comprehended through engagement with outer objects, and
[1589] Those gathered and comprehended through the activity of inner mind—these two categories encompass all.
[1590] First, regarding those gathered by outer objects:
[1591] There are five great elements that serve as the foundation of all form-possessing existence.
[1592] They produce the vessels and essences of the world and abide as the support for all that possesses form.
[1593] They serve as the cause, condition, basis, and fundamental nature for both arising and destruction.
[1594] Earth abides with characteristics that are firm and solid, providing the foundation upon which all rests.
[1595] Water abides with characteristics that are moist and flowing, cohering and holding all things together.
[1596] Fire abides with characteristics that are hot and burning, ripening and transforming all that it touches.
[1597] Wind abides with characteristics that move and uplift, animating and sustaining all activity.
[1598] Space abides with characteristics that are vast and open, accommodating all without obstruction.
[1599] Through the harmonious interaction of these five, vessels and essences are produced and maintained throughout the three realms.
[1600] From that very nature, the five elements gathered by outer objects manifest their functions thus:
[1601] The earth element produces and supports the basis of the body, giving it form and stability.
[1602] The water element holds and maintains names and designations, allowing cognition to occur.
[1603] The fire element ripens and matures objects, bringing them to completion.
[1604] The wind element sustains and animates the entire moving world, providing the vitality of breath and motion.
[1605] The space element holds and accommodates the powers and faculties, giving them room to function.
[1606] Thus it is taught by the Victorious Ones.
[1607] <tantra> The elements gathered by inner mind appear as vessel and essence, two aspects of a single nature:
[1608] <tantra> The vessel appears as objects, accumulated and projected through the power of past actions.
[1609] <tantra> If one divides these for the sake of clear exposition:
[1610] <tantra> There are those arising from the delusion of mind that appears as outer objects, and
[1611] <tantra> Those arising naturally from the luminous clarity of inner mind itself—these two.
[1612] <tantra> First: The latency of object-appearing mind manifests like a dream, without substantial nature yet clearly appearing.
[1613] <tantra> If one analyzes this dream-like display:
[1614] <tantra> There are the four desire-realm continents and their accompanying realms, appearing as solid yet empty.
[1615] <tantra> The five form-objects of the form realm—lights, self-arisen, appearing like rainbows in the sky.
[1616] <tantra> The formless objects: concentrations and absorptions, self-emanated yet invisible to others' perception.
[1617] Thus it is spoken in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra, the great seal of definitive meaning.
[1618] The elements gathered by inner mind are of two types:
[1619] The element of vessel that gathers and holds beings within the round of existence, and
[1620] The element that arises directly from mind itself, being the projection of awareness.
[1621] Regarding the element of vessel:
[1622] The form element arises from the vast basis of beings' mindfulness, accumulated through countless actions.
[1623] The formless element arises from excessive mindfulness that transcends form yet still grasps.
[1624] The desire element arises from limited mindfulness that fixates upon particular objects. Thus it is taught.
[1625] Second: Regarding that which arises naturally from the luminosity of the inner mind:
[1626] Awareness exists as the ground, and through its self-arisen potency comes the obscuration of the all-ground consciousness.
[1627] From that all-ground, arising as the basis-consciousness, comes the active mind that engages with objects.
[1628] From that mind, the five gates of perception and their faculties arise as knowing awareness.
[1629] Like a wish-fulfilling tree grown from a golden ground, with branches, flowers, and leaves spontaneously appearing.
[1630] Dividing this self-arisen display for the purpose of understanding:
[1631] There are objects that appear as what is known,
[1632] The faculties of cognition that apprehend them,
[1633] And feelings that arise from contact—these three encompass all.
[1634] Objects are designated as the six bases of faculties when the mere knowing of the six consciousnesses, arising in this moment, is taken as the object of cognition.
[1635] Thus the six bases of faculties are named according to their support.
[1636] The faculties of cognition are the six present knowings of eye and ear and so forth.
[1637] Feelings are the six types of future aspects, ripening from past contacts.
[1638] Whatever object consciousness enters and engages with,
[1639] The previous six knowings that maintain the continuum of experience are called "objects."
[1640] The knowing that grasps the nature of that in a single moment of clear apprehension is called "present knowing."
[1641] After that, feelings that gather as pleasure, pain, or neutrality are called "feelings of contact."
[1642] These arise from the gathering of object and knowing, which constitutes the essential nature of feeling.
[1643] Thus, dividing the six groups into three types results in eighteen distinct categories of experience.
[1644] From that very nature, the elements arising from mind itself are established as:
[1645] The eye element arising from the clear aspect of knowing, like a mirror reflecting form.
[1646] The ear element arising from single-pointed knowing that gathers sounds.
[1647] The nose element arising from limitless knowing that pervades all scents.
[1648] The tongue element arising from knowing gathered as one taste.
[1649] The mind element arising from knowing that enters all objects without obstruction.
[1650] The body element arising from knowing that serves as the basis for all the others.
[1651] <ornament> 
[1652] <ornament> 
[1653] Through holding name and form, the element of eye consciousness comes to be.
[1654] Through holding accomplished actions, the element of ear consciousness manifests.
[1655] Through holding others in succession, the element of nose consciousness arises.
[1656] Through actual experience of objects, the element of tongue consciousness is established.
[1657] Through pervading all objects and even the objectless, the element of mind consciousness functions.
[1658] Through gathering all meanings comprehensively, the element of body consciousness operates.
[1659] Through grasping objects incorrectly and accomplishing apparent objects, the eye gathers and there is the element of contact.
[1660] Through the ear holding sounds and dispersing attention, there is the ear's gathering and the element of contact.
[1661] Through superior knowings gathering as one and attracting other minds, there is the nose's gathering and the element of contact.
[1662] Through following and taking nearby objects as they appear, there is the tongue's gathering and the element of contact.
[1663] Through gathering all mindfulness and entering all objects, there is the mind's gathering and the element of contact.
[1664] Through holding coarse multiplicity and arising as embodied experience, there is the body's gathering and the element of contact.
[1665] Therefore, these elements also accomplish the holding and apprehension of objects through their distinct functions.
[1666] These arise from the part that holds within delusion itself, being the play of unawareness. Thus it is taught.
[1667] Second: The aggregates arise from the essential nature of basis and aggregates, gathered and assembled as one heap of experience.
[1668] This collection is called "aggregate" because it accumulates and amasses the aspects of existence.
[1669] If one divides them according to their nature:
[1670] There are the aggregates with thought, wherein conceptual cognition operates, and those without thought—these two.
