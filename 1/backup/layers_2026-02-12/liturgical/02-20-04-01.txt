[8972] At first, when losing, the two awarenesses of the time of delusion have no good-bad distinction.
[8973] Awareness not meditated and
[8974] At the time of meditating, without distinction,
[8975] At the time of wandering and
[8976] At the time of passing, awareness has no good-bad.
[8977] At the time of going to sleep and
[8978] At the time of waking and
[8979] At the time of coming and going, awareness has no good-bad distinction—it is like this.
[8980] However, there is only dream joy and suffering of good-bad appearance manner.
[8981] Depending on that, one meditates the path.
[8982] It is not that the essence goes to the good—
[8983] For awareness has no transfer or change.
[8984] Thus also, from the Self-Arisen:
[8985] <tantra> Emaho!
[8986] <tantra> This precious jewel nectar,
[8987] <tantra> At the time of beginningless time,
[8988] <tantra> I lost the precious jewel.
[8989] <tantra> At that time, wandering wrongly in suffering.
[8990] <tantra> That precious jewel nectar,
[8991] <tantra> Has no place to be found by searching.
[8992] <tantra> Self-arisen from self, realized by self.
[8993] <tantra> That precious jewel nectar,
[8994] <tantra> Not feeling loss, feeling finding.
[8995] <tantra> By losing, things are without characteristics.
[8996] <tantra> Possessing the glow of joy by finding.
[8997] <tantra> The time of finding and the time of losing,
[8998] <tantra> Realized in one state without distinction.
[8999] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9000] Moreover, that losing in the state of self-awareness, though finding from the state of self,
[9001] From self-awareness's one wheel,
[9002] Does not enter elsewhere.
[9003] Losing the jewel in the king's treasury, doing suffering by the jewel's absence.
[9004] Though joy and bliss expand by finding from the treasury, both do not move from one treasury—it is like this.
[9005] Samsara and nirvana, the two appearing from the state of awareness, are also like this.
[9006] This is the secret word of determining the self-essential-point of supreme wish-fulfillment, realizing the vast expanse of dharmatā.
[9007] Second: demonstrating lamp-experience from that has three aspects:
[9008] Preliminary characteristics of place,
[9009] Actual lamp-pressing method,
[9010] From that, the manner of appearance-arising.
[9011] First:
[9012] Abandoning all actions of this life,
[9013] Making the holy Lama pleased,
[9014] Sitting with the three immovables in a room decorated by darkness in a very secluded place,
[9015] Perfecting Lama yoga, meditating, placing requests from the heart.
[9016] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[9017] <tantra> Lamp-pressing is thus:
[9018] <tantra> By the faithful one, mind free from samsara,
[9019] <tantra> Do Lama offering and giving,
[9020] <tantra> Abandoning all samsaric connections,
[9021] <tantra> In a secluded direction or charnel ground,
[9022] <tantra> One must abide alone, abandoning companions.
[9023] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9024] Second:
[9025] Placing on AH, and
[9026] Entering clearly—two:
