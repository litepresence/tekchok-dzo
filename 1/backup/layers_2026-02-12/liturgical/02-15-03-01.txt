[669] The first is:
[670] Though essence is one, three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects—
[671] From Self-Arisen:
[672] Three kayas, wisdom-appearance,
[673] Without obstruction to anything,
[674] Perceived objects being one,
[675] Essence appearing individually.
[676] Thus it is said.
[677] This is awareness-itself's appearance manner:
[678] From that same source:
[679] Thought-free awareness is dharmakaya's essence,
[680] Uncensored clear awareness is sambhogakaya,
[681] Whatever-appearing awareness is nirmanakaya.
[682] Thus it is said.
[683] In this, complete,
[684] Awakened.
