[12004] The situation of outer objects and inner mind appearing as dharmas.

[12006] The aspect of appearance of the face of self-arising activity through the two form bodies from the self-radiance of ground-appearance appearing as body and wisdom is the pure intermediate state of dharmatā,

[12007] While all impure dharmas of deluded appearance of the six realms are the intermediate state of delusion.
