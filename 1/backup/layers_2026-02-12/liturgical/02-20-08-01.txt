[9223] First, the essence of the mountain's general meaning intention is awareness of the nature of Great Perfection, luminosity without transfer or change, space and wisdom non-dual.
[9224] When realizing that by sense-faculty,
[9225] When space-awareness appears as field, view, intention, conduct, and fruit arise as four-fours for the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties of the person—thus twelve portions.
[9226] <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[9227] <tantra> At the time when the mountain's general meaning intention arises,
[9228] <tantra> Reach the end of the Great Perfection View.
[9229] <tantra> For the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties, three views arise.
[9230] <tantra> For the best sense-faculty, the view of wisdom-appearance spontaneously arising
[9231] <tantra> Is realizing awareness of self's wisdom without realization together with body.
[9232] <tantra> At that time, intention is unmoving in clarity, like planets and stars arising on the ocean.
[9233] <tantra> Conduct is ceaseless power-arising conduct, like casting a sky-spear.
[9234] <tantra> Fruit is seeing the appearance of birthless self-arising.
[9235] The view of the middle sense-faculty
[9236] Realizes only self's awareness without birth.
[9237] Intention is free from conceptual portions, like flags attaching to the ocean.
[9238] Conduct is unblocked spontaneous conduct, like a mad-one.
[9239] Conduct without obstruction in any appearance.
[9240] Fruit:
[9241] Endowed with intention of self-place, conquering signs.
[9242] The view of the last sense-faculty realizes this very appearance as like illusion or emanation.
[9243] Intention: demonstrating essence of self-appearance, understanding wisdom arising in the intermediate, like a lion-chick free from the womb-egg.
[9244] See interior wisdom obscured.
[9245] Conduct:
[9246] Endowed with conduct grasping samsara-nirvana two.
[9247] Fruit:
[9248] Having abandoned body, breath reaches the nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[9249] Second, the essence of wisdom's general filling intention:
[9250] Realizing awareness's power-empowerment perfected from the beginning.
[9251] Different manners of realizing by three sense-faculties:
[9252] <tantra> From that same source:
[9253] <tantra> At the time when wisdom's general filling intention arises,
[9254] <tantra> Also, by the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties of the person, three view manners arise.
[9255] <tantra> The best sense-faculty realizes only by demonstrating birthless fruit as self-nature through empowerment.
[9256] <tantra> Intention:
[9257] <tantra> Through wisdom practice, spreading to bindu, unmoving from sky-equal great bliss intention.
[9258] <tantra> Conduct:
[9259] <tantra> Conduct without pure-impure in white-red awakening mind.
[9260] <tantra> Fruit:
[9261] <tantra> Seeing suchness of Buddha-family ground.
[9262] The view of the middle sense-faculty
[9263] Realizes only appearance becoming awareness's power.
[9264] Intention:
[9265] Abides undistracted in clarity, like sun-moon pair relating.
[9266] Conduct:
[9267] Conducting in true dharmatā yogin manner.
[9268] Fruit:
[9269] Obtaining birth-deathless suchness.
[9270] The view of the last sense-faculty
[9271] Realizes empowerment qualities all expanding and arising.
[9272] Intention:
[9273] Meditating relying on god-body with signs.
[9274] Conduct:
[9275] Conducting in dharmatā's display.
[9276] Fruit:
[9277] Obtaining Buddha through the gate of qualities. Thus it is spoken.
[9278] Third, the essence of bindu range-penetration intention:
[9279] Buddhahood through penetrating self-appearance's range by self-arising awareness wisdom of the intermediate, self-realizing.
[9280] Different by distinction of person's sense-faculty.
[9281] <tantra> From that:
[9282] <tantra> At the time when bindu range-penetration intention arises,
[9283] <tantra> Also, for the best, middle, and last of three sense-faculties, three view-signs arise.
[9284] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty:
[9285] <tantra> Like a meteor moving in the sky,
[9286] <tantra> Arising as wisdom-power quality,
[9287] <tantra> Realizes liberation in three moments.
[9288] <tantra> Intention:
[9289] <tantra> Abides pervasive to all open clarity, like sun arising in space-between.
[9290] <tantra> Conduct:
[9291] <tantra> Enjoys in pure complete wisdom-body.
[9292] <tantra> Fruit: Thus-come at primordially pure ground in three moments.
[9293] The view of the middle sense-faculty:
[9294] Realizes appearance of great leakless dharmatā bliss arising by gap.
[9295] Intention:
[9296] Seeing each special field of view in each moment,
[9297] Each special realization arises,
[9298] And seeing each dharmakāya appearance,
[9299] Abides in intention of heart's pure suchness.
[9300] Conduct:
[9301] Conducts non-dual with self-heart's light-ray.
[9302] Fruit:
[9303] Seeing self-awareness's appearance as birthless dharmakāya.
[9304] The view of the last sense-faculty:
[9305] In pure wisdom appearance,
[9306] Did I arise from that,
[9307] Or did that arise from me—realizes thus thinking.
[9308] Intention:
[9309] Abides without seeing agent in that very appearance.
[9310] Conduct:
[9311] Endowed with doubt and indecision conduct.
[9312] Fruit:
[9313] Obtaining fruit of breathing into nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[9314] Fourth, the essence of sun-moon equal gap intention:
[9315] Realizing appearance-emptiness as equality without ceasing.
[9316] Separated individually by sense-faculty.
[9317] <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[9318] <tantra> At the time when sun-moon equal gap intention penetrates expanse,
[9319] <tantra> For the best, middle, and last of three sense-faculties, three view-signs arise.
[9320] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty:
[9321] <tantra> Realizes wisdom as open.
[9322] <tantra> Intention: not separate from wisdom river's channel without ceasing.
[9323] <tantra> Conduct:
[9324] <tantra> Conducts display without ceasing by great wisdom conduct.
[9325] <tantra> Fruit:
[9326] <tantra> Obtaining fruit of method and wisdom two practice and release two, four aspects without gathering or separation.
[9327] Also, three view-signs of the middle sense-faculty:
[9328] Realizes view without method and wisdom two.
[9329] Intention: abides in manner like sun-moon arising in space-between, nature of method and wisdom.
[9330] Conduct: conducts to white-red secret bindu of great bliss.
[9331] Fruit:
[9332] Obtaining fruit of Buddhahood in womb of five Buddha-families' practice.
[9333] Three view-signs of the last sense-faculty:
[9334] Realizes view indicating awakening mind seed by father-mother practice.
[9335] Intention:
[9336] Abides in clear samādhi manner, remembering god's nature heart-essence.
[9337] Conduct:

[9344] Separated by individual sense-faculty.
[9345] <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[9346] <tantra> At the time of ocean expanse-penetration intention,
[9347] <tantra> Also, three view-signs arise for three sense-faculties.
[9348] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty:
[9349] <tantra> Realizes whatever appears by great wisdom's activity as self-appearance itself.
[9350] <tantra> Intention:
[9351] <tantra> Like being intoxicated by alcohol with small attachment to appearance.
[9352] <tantra> Conduct:
[9353] Conducting in samsara and nirvana.
[9354] Fruit: obtaining fruit of wisdom arising as one-cut not abiding in appearance.
[9355] Three view-signs of the middle sense-faculty:
[9356] Realizing view as clear-open wisdom-body.
[9357] Intention:
[9358] Endowed with fierce, short duration like waterfall.
[9359] Conduct:
[9360] Endowed with conduct-object like awareness-vision, not all's conduct-object.
[9361] Fruit:
[9362] Obtaining certainty of reaching end to empty wisdom's heart-essence.

[9366] Intention:
[9367] Abiding in god and human mind-holding.
[9368] Conduct:
[9369] Endowed with fabricated two-grasping conduct.
[9370] Fruit:
[9371] Obtaining god and human status. Thus it is spoken.
[9372] Third, summarizing meaning by aspect:
[9373] These five intentions bind all secret heart-essence yogins.
[9374] Arising of yogin's experience:
[9375] By mountain general meaning, transcending view of Great Perfection without high-low, slack-tight equality.
[9376] By wisdom's general filling, grasp ground as self-abiding dharmatā in that manner.
[9377] By bindu range-penetration, examine awareness's liberation manner from space-appearance.
[9378] By sun-moon equal gap, deliver intention to Dharma-ceasing expanse.
[9379] By ocean expanse-penetration, stably hold ground at primordially pure ground of space-awareness.
[9380] Also, first: like lion's play conquering fear of delusory appearance destruction, washed high by view.
[9381] Second: like king-awareness empowerment obtaining self-power dharmatā.
[9382] Third: like peacock chick emerging from egg, reaching pure space.
[9383] Fourth: like equal sun-moon without two, expanding greatly all-equal vastness.
[9384] Fifth: establishing supreme secret bindu meaning gathered in intention like sun arising from mountain neck, self-appearance clear as wisdom.
[9385] <tantra> From the Lion Power-Perfect:
[9386] <tantra> The intention of mountain's general meaning
[9387] <tantra> Is like lion's play.
[9388] <tantra> The intention of wisdom's general filling
[9389] <tantra> Is like empowerment from king's head.
[9390] <tantra> The intention of bindu's range-penetration is like peacock chick emerging from egg.
[9391] <tantra> The intention of sun-moon equal gap is like entering equality without sun and moon two.
[9392] <tantra> The intention of ocean's expanse-penetration
[9393] <tantra> Is like sun arising from mountain's neck. Thus it is spoken.
[9394] Thus, dividing each of the five aspirations into three sense-faculties makes fifteen. Dividing each of these into view, intention, conduct, and fruit fours makes sixty Dharma enumerations—purifying sixty enumerations of eon's increase-decrease, sentient beings' affliction, and view.
[9395] Demonstrated as pure complete nature of wisdom experience, spoken by Vajra-Holder.
[9396] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[9397] The twentieth chapter establishing the essential point of taking experience of spontaneous leap-over wisdom.
[9398] Thus having demonstrated all methods of taking experience through guidance method,
[9399] Now extensively explaining the sequence of how to take experience through introduction has two aspects:
[9400] Establishing all Dharmas by general introduction sequence,
[9401] And extensively explaining mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction.
[9402] First, the preparation preceding introduction:
[9403] From two actual introductions,
