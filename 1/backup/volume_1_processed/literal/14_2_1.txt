[19044] Awareness nature extensively explained
[19045] First at two brief-show and extensively explain
[19046] First is thus-result from
[19047] Mind's within body abide
[19048] Tone's body aspect five-by-means-of
[19049] Each family's characteristic hold
[19050] Light's body six-by-means-of also
[19051] Nature appearance's reality gather
[19052] Pure body three-by-means-of
[19053] Nirvana indicate hold
[19054] Aspect's body eight-by-means-of also
[19055] Ground-path perfect action do
[19056] Thus said
[19057] Mind at essence body arise-place exist that tone family five's body unmixed standard reach time at appearance
[19058] Body from light radiate-by-means-of channels within bindu light-tone and out spread and appearance's body minute aspect six appear
[19059] Abide-place's wisdom three liberate ground's body inner space exhaust standard hold
[19060] Aspect's body eight final spontaneous ground at body three nine division from
[19061] Dharma-body's dharma-body space pure all's arise-place is place make separate uncounted eight
[19062] Second body extensively explain at two common distinction and
[19063] Special distinction extensively explain
[19064] First at two
[19065] Awareness object-appearance's body and
[19066] Essence gather body sun-moon mouth-union from
[19067] Body two awareness object-appearance's body and
[19068] Essence gather body
[19069] First senses at appear and refute-establish without distinction senses and
[19070] Aggregates and
[19071] Object and subject pure body and three

[19274] That attachment-without self-liberate body said
[19275] These extensively explain clear infinite elaboration sufficiency
[19276] Second wisdom nature extensively explain at two abide-place's wisdom and
[19277] Characteristic hold wisdom
[19278] First essence nature compassion three from
[19279] Essence body appear
[19280] Nature light appear
[19281] Compassion action's activity appear
[19282] That word also sun-moon mouth-union from
[19283] Abide-place's wisdom three essence pure-from-birth wisdom and
[19284] Nature spontaneous wisdom and
[19285] Compassion self-appearance wisdom
[19286] Thus said
[19287] Second characteristic hold wisdom five
[19288] Body at space exist that capacity from arise self-arise from
[19289] Body unchange from wisdom cease without arise
[19290] That also this-like
[19291] Body at space exist for
[19292] Dharma-space wisdom and
[19293] Space at clear-aspect exist for
[19294] Mirror-like wisdom become
[19295] Clear two without exist for
[19296] Equality wisdom arise
[19297] Two without view exist for
[19298] Discriminate wisdom arise
[19299] View standard exist for
[19300] Accomplish-action wisdom arise
[19301] Thus said
[19302] Third light wisdom's own-tone is
[19303] Inner clear subtle depth-clear color beyond and
[19304] Outer clear coarse color hold light two from
[19305] First pure-from-birth space spontaneous own-tone crystal within-light like exist manifestly color clear without light five
[19306] Ground self-arisen awareness space within abide sun-moon mouth-union from
[19307] Not-abide wisdom ground pure color beyond light stain without white self-place pure appearance where also not-divide
[19308] Not-seek place yellow self-place pure object various not-appear
[19309] Attachment without red self-place pure knowledge this knowledge-object not-appear
[19310] Effort without green self-place pure do doer all beyond
[19311] Unchange vast blue self-place pure knowledge what essence also establish without abide
[19312] Thus said
[19313] This itself light all's arise-place and exhaust-ground two both
[19314] That also first space-appearance and
[19312] Now path-appearance and
[19313] Bardo self-appearance all's life this from light five out arise
[19314] Now or bardo or ground-appearance's set time this five's space self-dissolve
[19315] Brief inner body and wisdom abide pure
[19316] Out appearance body and wisdom appearance arise-place and exhaust-ground two both are
[19317] Second color hold light five
[19318] Self-arise from
[19319] Wisdom from light arise
[19320] Wisdom unchange for blue arise
[19321] Wisdom pure for white arise
[19322] Wisdom from quality arise for yellow arise
[19323] Wisdom control complete for red arise
[19324] Wisdom activity complete for green arise
[19325] Sentient-being all at also thus abide
[19326] Prior from
[19327] Self-appearance clear color hold light five
[19328] White and
[19329] Yellow and
[19330] Red and
[19331] Green and
[19332] Blue
[19333] Thus said
[19334] Fourth bindu at three
[19335] Sun-moon mouth-union from
[19336] Bindu three
[19337] Ground hold bindu and
[19338] Appearance path's bindu and
[19339] Fruit self-ripen bindu
[19340] Thus said
[19341] First heart within light five spontaneous bindu light-channel essence within abide
[19342] Light five's rim appear-by-means-of nature light's bindu named
[19343] That pure-from-birth awareness ornamentate-by-means-of all-good bindu named
[19344] That from
[19345] Ground hold bindu two
[19346] Nature light's bindu and all-good bindu
[19347] Thus said
[19348] This itself secret-gather unbreakable bindu say
[19349] Great-bliss unchange bindu named
[19350] Always heart at abide
[19351] Bindu one at change without
[19352] That meditate do person at
[19353] Definite wisdom arise become
[19354] Thus explained is
[19355] Second path's bindu at two
[19356] Sun-moon mouth-union from
[19354] Appearance path's bindu two
[19355] Conventional cause's bindu and
[19356] Abide ultimate's bindu
[19357] Thus said
[19358] First prior also extensively show
[19359] Slightly explain
[19360] That from
[19361] Conventional cause's bindu embodied all's channel within abide
[19362] Father's cause and mother's condition appear
[19363] That also elements essence gather mother bindu red become
[19364] Bodhicitta all's sediment gather from father's bindu white become
[19365] Therefore elements gather from form ripen
[19366] Bodhicitta gather from mindfulness-thought and feeling and awareness gather
[19367] That also miraculously-born and
[19368] Egg-born and
[19369] Warmth-moisture-born at also elements gather seed and
[19370] Bodhicitta gather seed two self-constituent gather from birth take
[19371] Thus embodied all at body gather do bindu white-red two self-constituent abide
[19372] That male at elements seed elements own-scope self-absorb manifestly not-appear
[19373] Female at bodhicitta seed ground unchange manifestly not-emerge
[19374] Therefore bun-without at bliss meditate suitable
[19375] Bindu and wind meditate even unliberated for
[19376] Thus seed two-by-means-of aggregates support do
[19377] Persons life's conditioning also this two-by-means-of do
[19378] Elements self-self awareness enemy-by-means-of temporarily condition
[19379] Elements state-by-means-of strength exhaust at
[19380] This two abide from transfer do is
[19381] Thus said
[19382] That male at bindu and
[19383] Elements seed two separate for
[19384] Seed first channel-view's support
[19385] End transfer-by-means-of life condition
[19386] Channel right's upper-tip crown hams essence
[19385] Manifestly not-appear and
[19386] Female at elements essence pure lower-tip
[19387] Secret-place space-protector wheel's within a's form abide manifestly not-appear
[19388] Bindu manifestly flow support also
[19389] This two action do
[19390] Bindu's seed is and elements essence gather seed named
[19391] This two's difference distinguish essential
[19392] Second abide ultimate's bindu heart within light-channel light five and that out arise snow
[19393] Sun-moon mouth-union from
[19394] Abide ultimate's bindu two
[19395] Self-abide cause's bindu breath male habituation from arise
[19396] Self-abide cause's bindu
[19397] Embodied all's heart within light essence gather bindu
[19398] Color five pellet gather like or
[19399] Fish-eye like or
[19400] Flock within sleep eye like or
[19401] Sky-goer mind move eye like
[19402] Sometimes channels within within move and abide
[19403] Male habituation from arise
[19404] First light curtain appear and
[19405] Second light ray-thread abide and
[19406] Third at bindu's rim arise
[19407] Thus said
[19408] That heart within bindu that color five clear color five pellet like
[19409] Size fish-eye like
[19410] Light standard flock within sleep eye like
[19411] Clear standard sky-goer mind move eye like
[19412] Sometimes wisdom wind move-by-means-of channels ro central all-tremor crystal blue within from move and abide
[19413] Habituation from arise bindu experience take-by-means-of
[19414] Wisdom manifest's appearance and
[19415] Wisdom direction slightly pure appearance arise
[19416] Characteristic hold wisdom's direction one pure from
[19417] Senses' sphere at first light curtain appear and
