[8010] At this occasion, certainty regarding the meaning of the four symbols;
[8011] Thus the thirty-six are the classification of great empowerment with elaboration.
[8012] The medium elaboration-with:
[8013] Condensed few from those.
[8014] From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[8015] "Teaching empowerment form of two:
[8016] Realization wisdom empowerment,
[8017] Not-realization sign empowerment."
[8018] Thus it is spoken.
[8019] Here there are two forms:
[8020] Empowerment with signs possessing marks,
[8021] Empowerment of mark-free wisdom.
[8022] First:
[8023] Arisen as method indicating meaning wisdom,
[8024] Relying on mark substance,
[8025] Relying on drawn powder,
[8026] From three: relying on yum bhaga.
[8027] Substance: eight auspicious,
[8028] Seven jewels,
[8029] Three tormas.
[8030] Powder maṇḍala—entering, vase doing preceding, empowering relying on peaceful-wrathful main-retinue body, speech, and mind.
[8031] Yum: space-secret great bliss empowerment,
[8032] Secret clear—those two empowerments.
[8033] Those also.
[8034] From the Rangshar:
[8035] "Not-realization sign empowerment:
[8036] Relying on mark substance,
[8037] Relying on powder maṇḍala,
[8038] Empowerment of yum bhaga.
[8039] Mark substance form three:
[8040] Auspicious substance eight empower-method,
[8041] Jewel vase empowerment,
[8042] Meat-blood torma empower-method.
[8043] Maṇḍala empower-method form three:
[8044] Retinue maṇḍala empower-method,
[8045] Tsaka-li empower-method,
[8046] Center palace empower-method.
[8047] Yum spoken as form three:
[8048] Mudrā door empowerment,
[8049] Bhaga and vajra,
[8050] Supreme empowerment, supreme.
[8051] White-red bodhicitta empower-method.
[8052] Not-realization sign empowerment."
[8053] Thus it is spoken.
[8054] Also:
[8055] "From the door of not-realization word,
[8056] Substance each, meaning each should be shown.
[8057] Generation peaceful empowerment,
[8058] Completion wrathful empowerment.
[8059] Secret-mark vajra empowerment also empower,
[8060] Command-sign scripture empowerment.
[8061] All those substances,
[8062] Should be empowered in sequence."
[8063] Thus it is spoken.
[8064] Second, the mark-free wisdom empowerment:
[8065] Empowering outer appearance as mind's play,
[8066] Empowering inner meditation as mind's placing method,
[8067] Empowering secret rigpa into wisdom's own face.
[8068] Empowering with twenty-one introductions of rigpa, together with faculty, as three: example, meaning, and sign;
[8069] Empowering rigpa only into self-clarity of five lights,
[8070] Empowering dawn liberation line-free great perfection beyond acceptance, rejection, and effort—spoken as three.
[8071] From that:
[8072] "Realization wisdom empowerment:
[8073] Should be known as form three.
[8074] Empowering outer: sentient beings' appearance,
[8075] Empowering inner: meditation mind-holding.
[8076] By twenty-one introductions,
[8077] Should be empowered as secret empowerment.
[8078] Introduction also form three:
[8079] By complete three—example, meaning, and sign,
[8080] Should empower great empowerment indicating.
[8081] Do introduction of rigpa wisdom.
[8082] Secret wisdom empowerment.
[8083] By introduction of rigpa only,
[8084] Do empowerment of form-body pure lands.
[8085] Realization wisdom empowerment supreme:
[8086] Know whatever appears as rigpa.
[8087] Rigpa free of negation and assertion,
[8088] Empowerments complete at one time.
[8089] Instructions liberating empowerments.
[8090] Great object-free maṇḍala,
[8091] Empowerment exists in self.
[8092] That also said by untying meaning:
[8093] One untie, two untie, all untie,
[8094] Liberation self-arisen, other not.
[8095] Thus self-arisen great empowerment.
[8096] Maṇḍala of supreme meaning empowerment:
[8097] One complete, two complete, all complete.
[8098] Indicating wisdom of meaning empowerment:
[8099] One non, two non, all non.
[8100] Great empowerment realizing vajra meaning:
[8101] One arise, two arise, all arise.
[8102] Great empowerment of empty wisdom:
[8103] One born, two born, all born.
[8104] If realized, thus empower supreme empowerment."
[8105] Thus it is spoken.
[8106] That also: conventionally said as "empowering" through guru's introduction to empowerment existing primordially in self.
[8107] Empower those meanings' realization into practice.
[8108] Gurus who have obtained siddhi, even with a single fragment, obtain complete empowerment for the student,
[8109] Accomplishing as said,
[8110] Those who have not obtained siddhi accomplish meaning by empowering that all combined.
[8111] From that arrangement of four empowerments:
[8112] First: colored-powder maṇḍala, deity,
[8113] Vase,
[8114] Student preparation complete,
[8115] Vase action preceding: eight auspicious substances,
[8116] Seven royal possessions,
[8117] Empowering peaceful-wrathful body with tsaka-li or protruding or statue image, blessing with vajra, name empowerment,
[8118] Empowering with poti of command and seal,
[8119] Completing activity with glory torma empowerment—called vase empowerment.
[8120] Then giving two bodhicittas—secret empowerment.
[8121] Then: attachment-free mudrā meditation,
[8122] Empowering merely by respecting mudrā,
[8123] Two: empowering the attached with actual action seal—
[8124] Prajñā-jñāna.
[8125] That is called not-realized cause-indicating empowerment.
[8126] Then fourth, word empowerment:
[8127] Realization wisdom empowerment,
[8128] External: view,
[8129] Internal: meditation,
[8130] Empowering three: secret rigpa.
[8131] Self-introducing rigpa through introduction,
[8132] Directly viewing meaning,
[8133] Called rigpa-potency empowerment: transmitting recognition by dividing into three—pressing essential point of arise-release.
[8134] Thus the definite four empowerments:
[8135] Arrangement of middling elaboration-with.
[8136] Condensed elaboration-with:
[8137] Called meaning-elaboration,
[8138] First: entering self and student into colored-powder maṇḍala indicating five rigpa wisdoms,
[8139] Vase,
[8140] Secret,
[8141] Prajñā-jñāna,
[8142] Empowering Dzogchen complete word empowerment with four signs, making festival.
[8143] This is the sequence of actual empowerment from Vimala to Legé-tsün.
