[4005] Self-nature without multiplicity—dharmatā beyond the words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading.
[4006] Characteristic: pointed out, the cord of confidence is cut.
[4007] That divided, there are two:
[4008] The ear lineage and
[4009] The explanation lineage.
[4010] The essence of the ear lineage: connected one-to-one, especially near itself.
[4011] That too: self-nature connected to the ear faculty, without interruption by others,
[4012] Characteristic: without wavering, with confidence and the certainty of liberation.
[4013] Divided into many: with syllables and
[4014] Without syllables—the ear lineage of dharmatā's meaning and instruction.
[4015] The essence of the explanation lineage:
[4016] Dharmatā without action, without cause, without basis to reverse the three realms,
[4017] Self-nature:
[4018] Clear light without stain, knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms,
[4019] Characteristic: beyond thought and investigation, dwelling in the intention of the three bodies possessing the five wisdoms.
[4020] Divided, there are four:
[4021] The outer cycle,
[4022] The inner cycle,
[4023] The secret cycle,
[4024] The unsurpassable secret cycle.
[4025] The essence of the outer cycle:
[4026] Without abandoning afflictions, the five poisons dwell as path-vehicles,
[4027] Self-nature without effort or establishment—whatever appears arises as dharmatā,
[4028] Characteristic without parts—emptiness nowhere divided.
[4029] The essence of the inner cycle: not possessing form, the markless dharmatā,
[4030] Self-nature without coming or going, the wisdom always dwelling at all times,
[4031] Characteristic: from the aspect of solidity, arising like a root,
[4032] From the aspect of twisting, arising like a trunk, from the aspect of clarity, arising like a flower,
[4033] From the aspect of ripening, arising like a fruit.
[4034] The essence of the secret cycle:
[4035] Pointing out and
[4036] Realization attained simultaneously, depending completely on the three: hearing, contemplation, and meditation,
[4037] Self-nature: breath cessation and buddhahood simultaneously, depending completely on effort, establishment, and familiarization-power,
[4038] Characteristic: buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneously, depending completely on accumulation and merit.
[4039] The essence of the unsurpassable secret cycle:
[4040] Not depending on words, completely depending on discerning wisdom.
[4041] Self-nature:
[4042] Directly seeing, not dwelling in the intellect-grasping view.
[4043] Characteristic: the measure of four appearances arrived at, the result of three bodies and five wisdoms not aimed at.
[4044] From that, this is the unsurpassed secret:
[4045] Below, through dharmatā's intellect-confidence reaching,
[4046] Here, through the guru's power, existing as the direct object of the senses—specially superior.
[4047] Thus shown, all cycles gathered into one sūtra, the definite sequence of division and summary:
[4048] These Great Perfections: nine in the expanse,
[4049] Twenty-one thousand volumes,
[4050] Three sections,
[4051] Thirty-five thousand chapters,
[4052] Eight great sections,
[4053] One hundred eighty sharp nails,
[4054] Fifteen hundred summaries,
[4055] Seven bundles of distinctions,
[4056] One and a half hundred-thousand enumerations,
[4057] Five thousand essential points,
[4058] Sixty-four hundred-thousand ślokas,
[4059] Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras dwelling as essences.
[4060] From the definitive conclusion,
[4061] From the nature of Great Perfection,
[4062] Word-distinctions emanate.
[4063] From the three sections, nine expanses become,
[4064] From the word summary, ślokas,
[4065] From fourteen hundred-thousand,
[4066] Thirty-five thousand chapters,
[4067] Twenty-one thousand volumes,
[4068] The spoken object equal to the sky's end,
[4069] Cutting the thoughts of disciples and beings,
[4070] From this, the spoken object abbreviated,
[4071] To one hundred eighty sharp nails,
[4072] Summaries one and a half thousand,
[4073] Three thousand great gathered essential points,
[4074] To forty thousand deviation-obstacles,
[4075] Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras,
[4076] The sequence of word-speaking clearly established.
[4077] Thus it is.
[4078] These too, when summarized:
[4079] Mind Section,
[4080] Expanse Section,
[4081] Instruction Section—gathered as three.
[4082] There: all of Mind Section—the inexpressible expanse of dharmatā,
[4083] The expanse of view's non-negation,
[4084] The expanse of conduct's non-affirmation—gathered as three.
[4085] That also gathered in five thousand name-affixed tantras.
[4086] That also gathered into eleven thousand chapters,
[4087] That also gathered into twenty-two hundred ślokas,
[4088] That also gathered into eleven thousand enumerations,
[4089] That also gathered into two bundles of distinctions,
[4090] That also gathered into five hundred summaries,
[4091] That also gathered into one thousand essential points,
[4092] That also gathered into fifty-one sharp nails,
[4093] That also gathered into two emanations of meditation's presence and absence,
[4094] And that, when made the vessel of the category,
[4095] Is called the Great Expanse's vessel, gathered into three categories.
[4096] And that is gathered into the two: command and treatise,
[4097] And those are gathered as the Mind Category.
[4098] The categories of the Expanse are gathered into three expanses:
[4099] The expanse of meditation's presence,
[4100] The expanse of self-nature's non-finding,
[4101] The expanse of characteristic's non-distinction—gathered as three.
[4102] That also gathered into three thousand name-affixed tantras,
[4103] And that gathered into eleven thousand chapters,
[4104] Those also gathered into twenty-two hundred ślokas,
[4105] Those also gathered into eight thousand enumerations,
[4106] And that gathered into two thousand bundles of distinctions,
[4107] Those also gathered into nine hundred summaries,
[4108] Those also gathered into two thousand essential points,
[4109] Those also gathered into fifty sharp nails,
[4110] Those also: liberation through action,
[4111] Liberation through placement,
[4112] Liberation through exactness—gathered as three emanations.
[4113] That also gathered into the category of expanse.
[4114] All categories of instruction also gathered into three expanses:
[4115] The expanse of play's non-cessation,
[4116] The expanse of mind's non-liberation,
[4117] The expanse of essence's non-good-non-bad,
[4118] Those also gathered into twelve thousand name-affixed tantras,
[4119] And those gathered into fourteen thousand chapters,
[4120] Those also gathered into twenty-one ślokas,
[4121] Those also gathered into eleven thousand enumerations.
[4122] Those also gathered into four thousand distinctions,
[4123] Those also gathered into two thousand five hundred summaries,
[4124] That also gathered into eighty-seven sharp nails,
[4125] Those also gathered into essential points,
[4126] Essential points of seeing,
[4127] Essential points of knowing—gathered as three emanations.
[4128] That also gathered into the two: command and treatise.
[4129] Treatise: many,
[4130] Tantra,
[4131] Scripture,
[4132] And instruction treatise—gathered as three.
[4133] Instruction treatise: very many,
[4134] Debate,
[4135] Establishment,
[4136] Intention,
[4137] And chiefly taking the treatise of enumeration—gathered as four.
[4138] Enumeration too:
[4139] The enumeration of meaning and instruction,
[4140] The enumeration of abiding nature,
[4141] The enumeration of established view's words,
[4142] The enumeration of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa non-duality—gathered as four.
[4143] Those all: essential points emanating,
[4144] Summary gathering,
[4145] Pointing out,
[4146] Directly bringing to the essential point—gathered as three.
[4147] Those gathered as one: the great general summary of dharma, well explained.
[4148] From the Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury,
[4149] The thorough division of established views, the fourth chapter.
[4150] Thus establishing the general manner of dharma's enumeration,
[4151] Now explaining the unsurpassable vehicle in particular,
[4152] Through knowing the nature of the tantra section,
[4153] And the definite basis arising from that—these two must be realized.
[4154] The nature of the tantra section: three,
[4155] Briefly showing the summary of tantra,
[4156] Extensively explaining that nature,
[4157] The definite branches of explanation.
[4158] First: six,
[4159] The essence of tantra,
[4160] Definite terms,
[4161] Divisions,
[4162] Rising measures,
[4163] Examples,
[4164] Validities.
[4165] First, the essence of tantra:
[4166] Awareness and that certainty brought to certainty—the great secret, cannot add or remove, definite.
[4167] Definite terms:
[4168] For the purpose of indicating lineage, tantra,
[4169] Making whatever lineages arise—thus tantra,
[4170] Definite and unbroken middle, continuous—thus tantra.
[4171] Divided: the tantra of meaning and nature,
[4172] The tantra of indicating words, two:
[4173] The tantra of meaning:
[4174] Mind itself, naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought,
[4175] Always abiding in all, thus tantra,
[4176] Being the lineage of buddha, thus from tantra,
[4177] Holding the characteristic of buddha, thus placed in tantra.
[4178] The tantra of words:
[4179] That same indicating basis—name, word, letter's nature, chapter, etc.—divided,
[4180] The chief method of the creation sequence,
[4181] The chief discerning of the completion sequence,
[4182] Both equal parts: the non-dual union,
[4183] Showing beyond all: the key points of Great Perfection.
[4184] The rising measure: chief of the great creation sequence, ten:
[4185] First: basis empowerment and samaya—two,
[4186] Deity and mantra—two,
[4187] Maṇḍala and offering—two,
[4188] Samādhi and conduct—two,
[4189] Activity and view—two. Ten complete: the chief tantra of the creation sequence.
[4190] The rising measure of the completion sequence:
[4191] View and fruition—two,
[4192] Conduct and meditation—two,
[4193] Mind and wisdom—two,
[4194] Experience and instruction—two. Eight complete: the chief rising measure of the completion sequence.
[4195] The non-dual union:
[4196] Both must complete—eighteen.
[4197] The completely perfect Great:
[4198] From creation and completion, the completion sequence.
[4199] The completion sequence: showing the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu with small elaboration,
[4200] Showing the sequence of great clear light wisdom—two.
[4201] Great—that entering the rising measure through the door of empowerment and samaya—two,
[4202] Path and enumeration—two,
[4203] Fruition and five complete.
[4204] Examples: like the warp,
[4205] Depending on many threads of cause, rolling like cloth,
[4206] Depending on different words, extracting one meaning.
[4207] Valid: tantra dwelling in self, indicating, thus
[4208] Valid as tantra.
[4209] That also, depending on the key of words, bringing meaning's basis to certainty without error, making it realized, thus placed in tantra.
[4210] Second, extensively explaining that nature: two.
[4211] Meaning tantra and word tantra extensively explained.
[4212] First: two,
[4213] Method tantra,
[4214] Nature tantra.
[4215] First:
[4216] Awareness and that meaning's experience-taking instructions.
[4217] Divided: indicated method tantra,
[4218] Indicating method tantra, two.
[4219] First, nature:
[4220] Awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment.
[4221] Definite term: that same indicating meaning and realizing basis and liberating method, thus
[4222] Called indicated method tantra.
[4223] Divided:
[4224] Emptiness,
[4225] Clarity, two.
[4226] Emptiness: awareness's nature, all empty of things and marked dharmas, primordially dwelling in great liberation from elaboration's end.
[4227] Clarity:
[4228] That too, not gone to the extreme of emptiness, self-illuminating five wisdoms' appearance,
[4229] Warm, cool, light,
[4230] Vast nature's chief great elements five, primordially spontaneously accomplished,
[4231] Compassion's tone unceasing, arising as capacity, awareness primordially pervading.
[4232] That too, awareness clear-empty great wisdom pervading all beings,
[4233] Called indicated method tantra.
[4234] From the Pearl Garland:
[4235] All buddhas' method tantra,
[4236] From the distinction of one basis nature,
[4237] Indicated and indicating,
[4238] Indicated tantra, one, all-pervading,
[4239] All that connected to its trace,
[4240] Pervading aspects two:
[4241] Pervading by emptiness, pervading by clarity,
[4242] One cause of emptiness, without thing,
[4243] Beyond all things' dharma,
[4244] Things empty, without appearance, one-pervading,
[4245] Becoming the basis of all, one nature,
[4246] Pervading lord itself gathered,
[4247] Birthless, memory exhausted,
[4248] From the distinction of nature itself,
[4249] Empty and appearing, appearing and empty,
[4250] Things, without things, also are,
[4251] Exhausted, primordially dwelling in emptiness,
[4252] Cause and condition separated, emptiness's object,
[4253] Pervading vast, without thing, empty by nature,
[4254] Without stain, unmixed, perfect,
[4255] Thoughtless, empty nature,
[4256] Pervading by emptiness, thus called tantra.
[4257] Clear, nature unceasing,
[4258] Illuminating appearance, all-pervading,
[4259] Clear, warm, cool,
[4260] Vast, moving, nature holding,
[4261] Pervading, primordial tone, self-clear,
[4262] Liberating, ripening seed,
[4263] Reverse from emptiness, clear pervading,
[4264] Instant, self-liberation,
[4265] Self-arising clarity, body connected,
[4266] Without stain, particularly clear,
[4267] Graspless, clear object appearing,
[4268] Five doors' knowledge, self-clear, perfect,
[4269] Body clear pervading, thus called tantra.
[4270] Thus.
[4271] Second, indicating method tantra: three.
[4272] Nature:
[4273] The instruction of indicated meaning, awareness, realizing method.
[4274] Definite term:
[4275] Self-dwelling awareness's wisdom indicating,
[4276] As realizing method, gathering the key of experience, shown in one direction—thus called indicating method tantra.
[4277] Generally, explanation tantras: words long, difficult,
[4278] Instruction tantras: words clear, easy,
[4279] Great Perfection tantras are called instruction tantras.
[4280] Divided:
[4281] Showing effortless primordial liberation,
[4282] Showing with effort through sequence, two.
[4283] First:
[4284] Cutting through the basis,
[4285] The sequence of instant faculties,
[4286] Primordially liberated, again without basis, etcetera.
[4287] Second: the path of leaping over, the gradual faculties, relying on the key of channels and winds, making liberation,
[4288] Three preliminaries, bringing to natural place, directly bringing to the self-key, until,
[4289] Body key,
[4290] Door key,
[4291] Object key,
[4292] Relying on the key of wind and awareness, taking experience,
[4293] Going to the measure of four appearances, showing liberation.
[4294] Also from that same:
[4295] Those directly realizing,
[4296] Called method—also distinction.
[4297] Person's intellect's difference,
[4298] How the sequence must be explained,
[4299] Without effort and striving, self-liberation,
[4300] With effort, experience must be taken.
[4301] Effortless ones are self-pure.
[4302] Key: through three aspects,
[4303] That meaning: taking experience,
[4304] Body, door, object.
[4305] Body's key: these three,
[4306] Lion's manner, elephant's manner,
[4307] Like a rishi, must be known.
[4308] Door: that same, unmoved,
[4309] Clarifying two, unmoved,
[4310] Sky itself unmoved.
[4311] Object's key: three aspects,
[4312] Pure expanse, dwelling,
[4313] Thus awareness's nature, dwelling,
[4314] All appearances, dwelling.
[4315] Mind changeless, self-abiding,
[4316] Mind changeless, memory clear,
[4317] Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear,
[4318] Mind, mind, slow—memory stream ceases.
[4319] Body and speech slack, free from suffering.
[4320] Awareness slack, five bodies arise.
[4321] Awareness arisen, conditions cease.
[4322] Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease.
[4323] Thus indicated method's tantra.
[4324] Self's tantra, unproduced and perfected.
[4325] Indicating, thus method is.
[4326] Dwelling in the stream, thus called tantra.
[4327] Thus.
[4328] Second, nature's tantra:
[4329] The meaning of basis, path, and fruition.
[4330] From that same:
[4331] Basis, path, fruition,
[4332] Determined holding, nature's tantra.
[4333] Thus.
[4334] This essence:
[4335] Empty-clear awareness's essence, basis, path, and fruition gathered.
[4336] Definite term: pervading all, accomplishing buddha-nature, thus called nature's tantra.
[4337] Divided:
[4338] Basis,
[4339] Essence,
[4340] Quintessence nature's tantra—three.
[4341] Basis nature's tantra: the first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion—three.
[4342] That too: essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent,
[4343] Delusion imputed only, not experienced,
[4344] Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear,
[4345] Compassion all-pervading, manifesting, unceasing,
[4346] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.
[4347] Essence nature's tantra:
[4348] Primordial wisdom three-stacked, in the heart-essence manner, arisen—basis nature's tantra, that power, basis appearance, eye, four lamps arisen,
[4349] The path's four appearances actually seen.
[4350] Quintessence nature's tantra:
[4351] Awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened.
[4352] That too: essence empty, marks awareness non-gone,
[4353] Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established,
[4354] Empty self-appearance arisen, cut, cut-off non-existent,
[4355] Empty-clear, indivisible—that awareness's quintessence,
[4356] That too: measured, ripened, quintessence gathered, thus called.
[4357] Clarity three and
[4358] V. CLEARING, STABILITY, APPEARANCE, AND EMPTYING
[4359] 4358. Clear three, etcetera: three kāyas, phenomena of path-appearance that have reached their end.
[4360] 4359. Knowledge, directionless: clear—so not emptiness cut off.
[4361] 4360. Entity, markless: clear—so not gradual.
[4362] 4361. Self-aware ultimate: those three are indivisible.
[4363] 4362. Permanent and cut, liberated from the four extremes: the mind of the indivisibility of body and primordial wisdom—thus called.
[4364] Now the three clear aspects:
[4365] 4364. When outer realms appear,
[4366] 4365. awareness appears kāya-clear, dimension color-clear.
[4367] 4366. Sky, dimension-awareness, appear indivisible.
[4368] Now the three stabilities:
[4369] 4368. Thus arisen, faith: the stability of view.
[4370] 4369. Nose-held: the stability of realm.
[4371] 4370. Delusion ceased: the stability of decision.
[4372] Now the three non-returns:
[4373] 4372. When samsara itself is known as primordially Buddha,
[4374] 4373. awareness has no continuum—so no return.
[4375] 4374. Awareness kāya appears manifestly; delusion-appearances fall into pure-appearances—so appearances do not return.
[4376] 4375. Dharmatā appears as manifold.
[4377] 4376. That: realization's confidence gained—so no return.
[4378] Now the three appearances:
[4379] 4378. Dimension: appearance without day or night.
[4380] 4379. Awareness: appearance without clear-dimming.
[4381] 4380. Dharmatā: appearance without transformation.
[4382] 4381. Thus liberated: delusion's appearances, self-pure, have no cause for samsara.
[4383] 4382. That very purity of appearance, self-arisen, conditions of samsara cease of themselves.
[4384] 4383. Even offering here, dharmatā's appearance in the intermediate state is decided—samsara's result dissolves of itself.
[4385] Now the three emptinesses:
[4386] 4384. At that time:
[4387] 4385. Awareness without comparison—delusion emptied.
[4388] 4386. Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied.
[4389] 4387. Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied.
[4390] 4388. Thus, basis, essence, flower-tantra: shown individually even.
[4391] 4389. Only a matter of reversal distinction; one essential nature.
[4392] 4390. How these three tantras proceed:  4391. As for what is shown as the basis-tantra regarding reality's actual state:  4392. Buddha and all sentient beings arise from that—so the outer tantra or the basis-tantra is established.
[4393] 4393. Realizing: entered the Buddha's tantra.
[4394] 4394. Not-realizing: entered the sentient beings' tantra. Since that tantra itself is made the basis, the basis-tantra is established.
[4395] 4395. The method-tantra too is this portion.
[4396] 4396. That meaning itself is the basis for indication, so what is indicated becomes the method-tantra.
[4397] 4397. Without basis-awareness as support, there are no Buddhas or sentient beings whatsoever.
[4398] 4398. Those two who hold their tantras—regarding the tantra—
[4399] 4399. That itself understood through entering: meaning realized—that is its purpose.
[4400] 4400. Realized and liberated—that is its innermost result and fruit.
[4401] 4401. Such meaning: if the guru's instruction does not indicate it, it is not realized.
[4402] 4402. If indicated, realizing the indicating method: that is called the method-indicating tantra.
[4403] 4403. That method transmitted one-to-one: thus called method-indicating.
[4404] 4404. Through indication, rigpa must be seen—liberation itself must be gained.
[4405] 4405. "Meaning unestablished anywhere, so no tantra"—if one thinks this, it is not so.
[4406] 4406. Since there is no awareness-continuum like that, meaning's tantra is properly imputed.
[4407] 4407. The essence-nature tantra is awareness.
[4408] 4408. Awareness's dharmatā seen directly: the continuum of one who has passed holds the tantra.
[4409] 4409. Without the guru's instruction, not seen—transmitted through samsara, so it is tantra.
[4410] 4410. The flower-nature tantra:
[4411] 4411. Four lamps: whoever sees and realizes dharmatā directly, that is rigpa—so it is the flower-tantra.
[4412] 4412. Not seeing that, transmitted as the class of actions and kleśas—so also tantra.
[4413] 4413. The quintessence-nature tantra:
[4414] 4414. That practiced: essence condensed into quintessence—thus called.
[4415] 4415. Seeing wisdom's appearance: since not destroyed in the three realms, it is tantra.
[4416] 4416. That quintessence of indivisible space-awareness is also explained elsewhere among the seventeen great-secret definitive tantras.
