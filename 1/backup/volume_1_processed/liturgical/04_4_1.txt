[6630] This is the supreme one, possessing the mole-mark of A on the nose-tip,
[6631] The definite key point of oral instructions excelling others,
[6632] Prophesying the future by clairvoyance,
[6633] Clearly showing the definite difficult points,
[6634] And filling the world with definite, exceeding marks even at the time of parinirvāṇa.
[6635] Whoever meets this, liberated without effort from the town of saṃsāra, has arisen as the ornament of Jambudvīpa.
[6636] Protector of beings, extremely compassionate,
[6637] Having become the world's guru-ornament, now arisen,
[6638] Having clearly shown the teaching of Clear Light Essence,
[6639] Gone to the peaceful sphere—to you, respectful prostration.
[6640] Always holding all of saṃsāra with compassion,
[6641] Although not passing to one-sided nirvāṇa peace,
[6642] By final deed, seeing beings' benefit,
[6643] Pervading the world with wonder—to you, respectful prostration.
[6644] In the first month of autumn, peaceful,
[6645] Having relinquished body-life in the supreme forest-retreat,
[6646] Again, what marvelous blessing-compassion,
[6647] Excelling others—to you, respectful prostration.
[6648] Where the protector became parinirvāṇa,
[6649] At that time, this earth with forests moved;
[6650] The appearance of five lights pervaded the sky,
[6651] Music's sweet sound played—to you, respectful prostration.
[6652] From melting body-relics, light-rays blazing in the sky,
[6653] Adorned by ḍākinīs' offering-clouds and music,
[6654] All beings obtained non-conceptual meditation—
[6655] To the one showing limitless emanations, respectful prostration.
[6656] Siddhas, mantra-holders, and ḍākinī gatherings,
[6657] Completely surrounded by arrangements of immeasurable offering-clouds,
[6658] Gone to the field of vidyādhara-victors,
[6659] To the sky-goer who obtained siddhi, respectful prostration.
[6660] For future beings, as a supreme merit-field,
[6661] From placed body-relics, the five families came,
[6662] From the crown, the fields of five families like rainbows,
[6663] Adorned with five lights, come—to you, respectful prostration.
[6664] Wherever body-relic fragments were invited,
[6665] Even when stūpas were erected and charity was done,
[6666] Five lights' appearance pervaded the sky,
[6667] Greatly moving beings' minds—to you, respectful prostration.
[6668] Vimalamitra, protector, compassionate,
[6669] By many emanations acting for beings' benefit,
[6670] Gone as emanation-ornament to the land of Tibet,
[6671] To Kumārarāja, the teacher, respectful prostration.
[6672] This clearly expresses the prophecy of our holy master as the emanation of vidyādhara.
[6673] Thus, in Jambudvīpa, by the gathering of vidyādhara-victors holding the supreme teaching, seven generations of flourishing passed,
[6674] From passing of ten years of life:
[6675] As shown before, the teaching's seed leaped to fields such as the Beautiful Arrangement, and acting for the benefit of ripening all beings.
[6676] When, from this good eon's thousand, passed a hundred million eons of formation and destruction,
[6677] At the eon called "Saṃsāra-Emptier,"
[6678] Buddha Wheel Lightning Garland completely holding this supreme teaching,
[6679] Having liberated beings from saṃsāra,
[6680] All beings of the great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara are liberated in the primordial ground, and the three seeds of the teaching also dissolve into the sphere of reality;
[6681] Saṃsāra is emptied;
[6682] From here, in twenty thousand great aeons, embodied ones do not appear.
[6683] Then again, as before, from the arising of latent tendencies, when the vessel and environment of beings appear,
[6684] The teacher of method also arises from the power of primordial Samantabhadra.
[6685] As said in the Sound Great Thalgyur Tantra:
[6686] "This secret heart-essence teaching,
[6687] Thus, from the passing of seven teachings,
[6688] From definitely experiencing seven fields,
[6689] Thus, from the passing of seven also,
[6690] On the threshold of Vajra Seat,
[6691] The seed of all teachings' speech,
[6692] The very self-arisen great syllable,
[6693] Descends with sound;
[6694] Here, in a hundred-million aeons,
[6695] By Wheel Lightning Garland,
[6696] Will appear to the Bhagavān.
[6697] Then, three hundred years,
[6698] Thus, below the passing of three,
[6699] The teaching's mind-vajra also
[6700] Will appear to that teacher.
[6701] Then, in five hundred years,
[6702] The teaching's kāya also descended there;
[6703] Thus, from the actual descent of teaching,
[6704] Again the teaching's ember arises.
[6705] Even in that teacher's retinue,
[6706] Called Ārya Brahma-Light,
[6707] To miraculous-power-possessing perfection,
[6708] Extremely faithful, aspiring,
[6709] Definitely held, manifestly appeared.
[6710] That, etc., the teacher's retinue:
[6711] Ārya śrāvakas, twenty thousand,
[6712] Vinaya teaching, one eon
[6713] Placed in the arhat result itself;
[6714] Then six dark aeons,
[6715] After that passed, two hundred-thousand arhats,
[6716] Gathered in one's own retinue;
[6717] Sūtra teaching, eight aeons,
[6718] Placed at the end of provisional-definitive action.
[6719] From miraculous power and control,
[6720] Definitely propelled, the teaching complete,
[6721] Again showing the manner of parinirvāṇa.
[6722] Then two dark aeons,
[6723] Then from the teacher's body born,
[6724] The retinue of great bodhisattvas,
[6725] Eight thousand gathered,
[6726] Supreme aspiration, Excellent-Terror-Glory,
[6727] Greatly showing, the teaching gathered.
[6728] Abhidharma teaching, a hundred aeons,
[6729] All obtaining result in one life.
[6730] At this time, saṃsāra is eradicated;
[6731] By beings, Buddhahood is obtained;
[6732] The appearance of six migrations is not possible.
[6733] In twenty thousand aeons,
[6734] From the continuity of beings' saṃsāra ceasing,
[6735] Embodied ones do not appear.
[6736] Then, by the distinction of karma,
[6737] Although beings have no former afflictions,
[6738] By the power of arisen latent tendencies,
[6739] Forms taking extremely subtle,
[6740] From extremely subtle, many in number,
[6741] Form-possessing beings' bodies will grow.
[6742] Thus inexpressible by words,
[6743] The end of the teaching, inconceivable—
[6744] Briefly indicated by words.
[6745] Thus it is spoken.
[6746] Here, some masters
[6747] Consider that all beings in Samantabhadra's abode are emptied,
[6748] Some consider that all beings of the great Brahma arranged by Vajradhara are liberated;
[6749] "The end of the teaching is inconceivable,"
[6750] Thus it is considered that in Samantabhadra's abode, still immeasurable.
[6751] However, there is no contradiction,
[6752] For by Samantabhadra's compassion, all are liberated, and
[6753] Arising from the sphere, still immeasurable latent tendencies—the two are not contradictory;
[6754] Even if recognized as the measure of vast liberation, it is supreme good.
[6755] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[6756] Showing the difficult points from the definitive meaning of the great secret—the fifth chapter.
[6757] Thus, having established from the tantra's abode of knowing, the branch of confidence,
[6758] Now, from that abode, whatever meanings arise are to be shown;
[6759] First, the gate of entering the unsurpassed vehicle is empowerment,
[6760] Here, for the definite arrangement of that abode, three:
[6761] The basis for entering empowerment,
[6762] The path of actual empowerment,
[6763] The result of completed empowerment.
[6764] First, four:
[6765] The characteristic of the guru who bestows-accomplishes,
[6766] The self-nature of the student who is bestowed,
[6767] The Dharma to be done in common,
[6768] The activity of empowerment, how bestowed.
[6769] First:
[6770] Completing all qualities suitable for guru, free from all faults, great waves of compassion—
[6771] From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[6772] "The vajra-meaning-possessing guru,
[6773] Of good nature and skilled in teaching,
[6774] Having obtained empowerment, applies the meaning of secret mantra,
[6775] Knows all outer and inner actions,
[6776] Without gathering and separation from the yi-dam deity,
[6777] Without distraction from samādhi,
[6778] Possessing the meaning of Dzogchen instructions,
[6779] Skilled in the tantra of secret mantra secrets,
[6780] Does all outer and inner accomplishments,
[6781] Not transgressing from the meaning of view,
[6782] Has released outer and inner secret actions.
[6783] Like a jewel of qualities,
[6784] Engaging the inexhaustible treasure."
[6785] Thus it is spoken.
[6786] From the Thalgyur:
[6787] "The great Vajradhara guru's
[6788] Sequence is to be explained;
[6789] The guru of complete characteristics
[6790] Is the source of all qualities,
[6791] The holder of the basis of perfect awakening."
[6792] Thus it is spoken.
[6793] Here, possessing six characteristics:
[6794] Discarding saṃsāra's dharmas behind,
[6795] Few desires and knowing contentment,
[6796] Skilled in application and possessing experience,
[6797] Skilled in the tantra's word-meaning and earnest in accomplishment,
[6798] Skilled in the meaning of view and complete in capability,
[6799] Great compassion and joy in giving.
[6800] Completing these is called "Glorious Vajradhara."
[6801] Having emptied the seeds of the student's six families,
[6802] Purifying the six afflictions,
[6803] The meaning of the six wisdoms arises,
[6804] For that itself possesses that capability.
[6805] Also, dividing the guru, there are root and
[6806] Branch, two from:
[6807] First, the root guru:
[6808] Completing four characteristics, having established empowerment as the basis,
[6809] Explains the tantra,
[6810] Shows oral instructions,
[6811] Now also practices the oral instructions shown by that guru.
[6812] The oral instruction guru, having established empowerment as the basis,
[6813] Explains the tantra, possessing two;
[6814] If oral instructions are transmitted, becomes the branch guru possessing three.
[6815] Incidentally, the master who trains:
[6816] From the Rangshar:
[6817] "Great ignorance and pride,
[6818] Foolish words attached outward,
[6819] Not mindful of secret mantra's meaning,
[6820] Arrogant speech criticizing others,
[6821] Entered wrong path,
[6822] Face of empowerment's maṇḍala not seen,
[6823] Samaya spread,
[6824] Unable to answer questions,
[6825] Little learning, great pride—
[6826] The student's demon, master not examined,
[6827] Not a secret mantra teaching master,
[6828] Cannot teach Great Perfection Ati;
[6829] Do not associate with that."
[6830] Thus it is spoken.
[6831] Second, the student's self-nature:
[6832] Mind reversed from saṃsāra's dharmas,
[6833] Great devotion and longing-mind toward guru, Dharma, and companions,
[6834] Faith firm, mind not entering other than Dharma,
[6835] Desiring the definitive meaning, great giving-capability and diligence,
[6836] Few attachments, good nature,
[6837] Great wisdom, abiding in samaya and vows,
[6838] Accord with others' minds, transforming through Dharma,
[6839] Listening to guru's speech, not confusing the secret door,
[6840] Great study and contemplation, self-nature tamed,
[6841] Especially possessing devotion to guru as Buddha or surpassing that,
[6842] Possessing ten dharmas,
[6843] A good student of supreme liberation,
[6844] Definitely obtaining supreme liberation from saṃsāra quickly.
[6845] Thus also:
[6846] From the Rangshar:
[6847] "Great power of faith and diligence,
[6848] Great wisdom and without attachment,
[6849] Great humility and secret mantra conduct,
[6850] Mind without concept, not distracted,
[6851] Possessing samaya, diligent in practice,
[6852] Possessing steady, clear, longing devotion,
[6853] Conducting meditation lucid and natural,
[6854] Conducting as the guru spoke,
[6855] Not abandoning samaya casually,
[6856] Conduct agreeable with others' conduct,
[6857] Mind gentle through manner of respect,
[6858] Following and holding even one word of teaching,
[6859] Conducting thus for one's own benefit,
[6860] Making the secret-seeking place endure,
[6861] Not transgressing from the vajra's meaning,
[6862] Relying on the person of great learning,
[6863] Not transgressing from one's own benefit,
[6864] Speaking gently without arrogant words,
[6865] Making agreeable entry with others' minds,
[6866] Making guru and Tathāgata
[6867] Without difference, of one manner—
[6868] That is the student's characteristic.
[6869] Thus possessing student
[6870] Is spoken as a vessel of Great Perfection."
[6871] Thus it is spoken.
[6872] Incidentally, the student to be abandoned:
[6873] From that itself:
[6874] "Not doing honor and humility,
[6875] Conducting secret mantra carelessly,
[6876] Without family lineage and without natural lineage,
[6877] Having become small in wisdom,
[6878] Disregarding kindness,
[6879] Speaking one's own family lineage,
[6880] Putting good ornaments on the body,
[6881] Having become spread without meaning,
[6882] Master's enemy, student not examined,
[6883] To person not taking into practice,
[6884] The meaning of Great Perfection not explained."
[6885] Thus it is spoken.
[6886] Also, that bad vessel cannot hold good content,
[6887] Like lion's milk cannot be held in a clay vessel.
[6888] If poured, the greatness of Dharma is lost, and
[6889] From that bad vessel, that one goes to lower realms;
[6890] To such bad vessel, it must be secret.
[6891] From that itself:
[6892] "The meaning of Great Perfection oral instructions,
[6893] Do not pour generally into bad vessel;
[6894] The essence of some possessing faith,
[6895] If poured into bad vessel,
[6896] Makes both content and vessel ruined.
[6897] Therefore, secret to those of inferior mind."
[6898] Thus it is spoken.
[6899] Third, the Dharma to be made common, three:
[6900] Dharma for master and student to contemplate in common,
[6901] The manner of relying and making supplication,
[6902] The result of definite purpose.
[6903] First:
[6904] That master, seeing that student with steady compassion, timely benefit, care, Dharma,
[6905] Even merely with food and drink giving benefit,
[6906] That student, contemplating that guru's qualities, making continuous longing devotion.
[6907] From the Rangshar:
[6908] "Compassion's connection rope, not cut—how?
[6909] Longing, continuous,
[6910] Is the connection of guru and student."
[6911] Thus it is spoken.
[6912] Second:
[6913] From the Thalgyur:
[6914] "To complete characteristics of each,
[6915] Kingdom and own body,
[6916] By retinue and possessions serve,
[6917] By pleasing body, speech, and conduct,
[6918] Rely on guru and Buddha equal in union;
[6919] Possessing faith and wisdom,
[6920] Faithful and without delusion,
[6921] Without error in expressed objects,
[6922] By clear faculties, rely on guru."
[6923] Thus it is spoken.
[6924] That student,
[6925] Possessing aspiration for empowerment of elaborations, etc., and
[6926] To request instructions, is not entering suddenly;
[6927] Even for common invitation, a former message must be sent.
[6928] Therefore, from former times of five, seven, or three years, offering maṇḍalas of accumulations, gold, etc., to the guru, when self is this age,
[6929] "This empowerment," or
[6930] "This instruction," requesting permission by asking, supplicating again and again,
[6931] At the beginning of one's own virtue-practice session, contemplating that guru's yoga day and night, six times, should make supplication.
[6932] The guru also: "Son, if you ask for empowerment, for removing obstacles and purifying sins in that interval, contemplating the guru on the crown, day and night, six times, obtain supplication"—giving permission, causes to make supplication.
[6933] That purpose: ripening the body into deity-kāya, and
[6934] 
[6935] Ripening speech into the self-sound of ali and kali, and
[6936] There is the purpose of ripening mind free from emptiness meditation-face.
[6937] At that time, by making fierce aspiration, thinking "Whatever empowerment I desire, etc., I must obtain,"
[6938] Explaining Dharma in dreams,
[6939] Prophecy, etc.—signs of guru accomplishment definitely arise.
[6940] Third, the result of definite purpose:
[6941] Thus, having supplicated before and relied on the guru,
[6942] Whatever is desired all accomplished, arising like a wish-fulfilling jewel and wish-fulfilling tree.
[6943] From the Thalgyur:
[6944] "From relying on that, qualities—
[6945] Wish-fulfilling tree and wish-fulfilling jewel,
[6946] Like a cow of desires,
[6947] Obtain immeasurable qualities;
[6948] Aiming at that, rely on the guru,
[6949] To reverse from saṃsāra's battle."
[6950] Thus it is spoken.
[6951] Fourth, the activity of empowerment, how to confer, five:
[6952] Benefit of empowerment,
[6953] Defect of not being empowered,
[6954] Place where to empower,
[6955] Time when to empower,
[6956] Sequence of making celebration.
[6957] First:
[6958] From the Rangshar:
[6959] "Qualities, particularly these:
[6960] Great wisdom appearance,
[6961] Becoming without obstacles,
[6962] Self-appearance shown as helper,
[6963] Becoming doing all actions."
[6964] Thus it is spoken.
[6965] From the Empowerment Jewel Tantra:
[6966] "By abandoning guru's desire,
[6967] If empowerment ritual is completed,
[6968] By the sequence of how empowerment is conferred,
[6969] Even great Vajradhara,
[6970] Definitely becomes in this life."
[6971] Thus it is spoken.
[6972] From the Secret Essence:
[6973] "If empowered by five essences,
[6974] After this time, Buddha's son,
[6975] All lower realms not,
[6976] Becomes master of higher liberation."
[6977] Thus it is spoken.
[6978] Also from the Rangshar:
[6979] "Benefits of empowerment are like this:
[6980] In the intermediate state, self-appearance will be recognized;
[6981] Having recognized, also obtains stability in that itself,
[6982] Able to dissolve the emanation-kāya in twenty-one days.
[6983] Even one of excellent faculty completion, suffering, fear, etc., do not come.
[6984] At the time of practice also, wisdom appearance clearly does not cease.
[6985] That is called 'special quality.'
[6986] Common qualities are obtained like this:
[6987] Knowing the ḍākinī's voice, and
[6988] Making the ḍākinī's blessing, and
[6989] Being seen as a place of honor by humans through blessing, and
[6990] Loving-kindness toward all beings, and
[6991] Beautiful form, lovely to see, and
[6992] Great merit increasing, and
[6993] Even after death, birth in the body of a cakravartin king, and
[6994] Great qualities arising like a precious jewel, and
[6995] Conducting pure Dharma like a lotus, and
[6996] Being seen as worthy of being surrounded by all like a stūpa, and
[6997] Overpowering common beings like a parasol, and
[6998] Able to liberate beings by wisdom like a mass of fire, and
[6999] Able to do benefit like a sword, and
[7000] Able to hold beings with compassion like a vajra hook, and
[7001] Realizing the meaning of sphere and wisdom without gathering and separation like a Dharma cloud;
[7002] Doing all outer and inner actions.
[7003] From those, etc., one hundred eight qualities are obtained.
[7004] By that, whatever actions are done, all are obtained.
[7005] By that, not harmed by obstacles and wrong-leadings.
[7006] Many children and great enjoyment are signs of obtained empowerment.
[7007] Former and later lifetimes are remembered.
[7008] Beings taking birth are also seen.
[7009] Others' minds are known.
[7010] Associates with non-humans.
[7011] From those, etc., one hundred eight qualities are obtained.
[7012] Second, the defect of not being empowered:
[7013] From the Magical Display Secret Essence:
[7014] "Not pleasing the master,
[7015] Not obtaining empowerments,
[7016] Beginning to listen, etc.,
[7017] Becomes without result and ruined."
[7018] Thus it is spoken.
[7019] From the Empowerment Complete Self-arisen Great Tantra:
[7020] "Not relying on secret mantra empowerment, does not accomplish;
[7021] Like a ferryman without hands,
[7022] Unable to cross to the other shore of the river."
[7023] Thus it is spoken.
[7024] From the Rangshar:
[7025] "The defect of not obtaining empowerment is like this:
[7026] Fainting in the intermediate state,
[7027] Fear,
[7028] Suffocation,
[7029] Obstacles,
[7030] And losing perception arise.
[7031] Even until not abandoning the body of latent tendencies, not being seen as worthy of honor by beings,
[7032] Little merit,
[7033] Short life,
[7034] Few enjoyments of livelihood,
[7035] Close mouth,
[7036] Many obstacles arise;
[7037] All actions are not accomplished.
[7038] That is the defect of not obtaining empowerment for secret mantra practice.
[7039] The yogi of secret mantra practice should obtain empowerment.
[7040] If empowerment is not obtained, even a Buddha is unable to turn the Dharma wheel on the ground of the Tathāgata.
[7041] If the wheel is not turned, by the compassion-emanation-kāya, unable to do benefit for beings.
[7042] Therefore, the practitioner of secret mantra should obtain empowerment."
[7043] Third, the place where to confer:
[7044] Secluded, pleasing, and near to siddhi.
[7045] Here, general abode—auspicious, with good earth examination, good forest, etc.;
[7046] From four particular abodes:
[7047] The abode of elaborations—if the student's body is earth, protect north from south expanse.
[7048] If water, protect west from east expanse.
[7049] If fire, protect east from west expanse.
[7050] If wind, protect south from north expanse.
[7051] The abode without elaboration:
[7052] In dense forest ravines, follow shapes and marks suitable to the student's elements.
[7053] For extreme without elaboration, the peak of a mountain where three valleys gather is supreme good.
[7054] For complete without elaboration, very secluded or hermitage, beyond one league from town.
[7055] For all four empowerments, abodes where other beings fear, wild carnivores reside,
[7056] Poisonous snakes,
[7057] Cemeteries and charnel grounds, etc.
[7058] A cemetery abode where very wild, untamed ḍākinīs reside is supreme auspicious.
[7059] Thus also:
[7060] From the Great Perfection Self-arisen:
[7061] "This supreme empowerment is shown—
[7062] In the center of great towns,
[7063] The yogi does not accomplish the purpose;
[7064] At the end of towns and cities,
[7065] In forests or empty mountain ravines,
[7066] The yogi enters the meaning of empowerment."
[7067] Thus it is spoken.
[7068] Also, for very secluded and pleasant,
[7069] The characteristics of the abode should be examined:
[7070] At the end of wide town valleys,
[7071] In places of ripe fruit forests,
[7072] Where various flowers arise,
[7073] West high, east expanse,
[7074] North like a protector,
[7075] Abode like south valley,
[7076] From self-manifest direction,
[7077] Without holes, empty, and vacant,
[7078] Without forms in front,
[7079] Without being-like forms,
[7080] Back supported by rock,
[7081] Side where various fruits blaze,
[7082] Front where clear water flows with sandalwood,
[7083] Or abode like food,
[7084] Mountain ranges all complete, not cut,
[7085] Where various bird voices call.
[7086] Thus it is spoken.
[7087] Fourth, the time when to empower, two:
[7088] Generally shown,
[7089] Particularly explained.
[7090] First: the auspicious time of gathered dependent origination, granted by the guru;
[7091] However, the special time:
[7092] Autumn, ripening the fruit of awakening,
[7093] Shown as planting the seed of liberation in spring.
[7094] The year of the monkey is auspicious.
[7095] The eighth of the waxing moon is good;
[7096] The star is supreme;
[7097] The planet Jupiter is good.
[7098] Second, from four:
[7099] First, time and signs of elaborations:
[7100] From showing the key point of the time for sequentially entering empowerment,
[7101] The empowerment of elaborations:
[7102] "Rat, dragon, horse, and pig—
