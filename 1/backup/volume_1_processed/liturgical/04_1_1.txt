[4417] From the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras
[4418] 4417. Buddha's all essence gathered,
[4419] 4418. Placed into all beings' hearts.
[4420] 4419. That essence: the intestine-continuum.
[4421] 4420. Since clarity not gathered, called "essence."
[4422] 4421. Thus,
[4423] From the Diligent Meaning-Possessing Tantra:
[4424] 4423. All teachings' supreme essence:
[4425] 4424. Dharmatā direct-path called.
[4426] 4425. Thus,
[4427] From the Vajra-Sky-Equality Tantra:
[4428] 4427. Basis, essence, flower:
[4429] 4428. All Buddhas' nature-tantra.
[4430] 4429. Supreme secret distinguished, essence gathered.
[4431] 4430. This to samsara's far shore,
[4432] 4431. Like an arrow-shot person.
[4433] 4432. Thus,
[4434] From the Supreme Golden Light:
[4435] 4434. Basis, nature, methods:
[4436] 4435. Relying, even to the Buddha-field,
[4437] 4436. Effortless, easy—so placed as tantra.
[4438] 4437. Thus.
[4439] The Determination of These Meanings
[4440] From the Pearl Garland:
[4441] 4440. Nature-tantra is this:
[4442] 4441. Basis, essence, quintessence itself.
[4443] 4442. Basis: essence, nature,
[4444] 4443. Compassion pervading all, arisen,
[4445] 4444. Possessing self-nature of three primordial wisdoms,
[4446] 4445. Primordially pure from stains,
[4447] 4446. The unique one of indivisibility.
[4448] 4447. All Buddhas' great secret.
[4449] 4448. Kāya: perfected essence-awareness.
[4450] 4449. Kāya's tantra: pervading emptiness.
[4451] 4450. Clarity itself is self-appearance.
[4452] 4451. Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature.
[4453] 4452. Perfect essence's nature-tantra.
[4454] 4453. All appearances are tantra,
[4455] 4454. All interconnected and clinging.
[4456] 4455. In the mandala of natural citta,
[4457] 4456. Unproduced, perfected—great essence.
[4458] 4457. Thus, gathered: essence,
[4459] 4458. Since become life's breath of all.
[4460] 4459. Explained as essence-tantra.
[4461] From the Tantra of All Buddhas' Blissful Secret
[4462] 4460. All Buddhas gathered into one,
[4463] 4461. All essences extracted,
[4464] 4462. Essence gathered—thus called essence,
[4465] 4463. Gathered into empty-clear awareness's essence.
[4466] 4464. All Buddhas' great blissful secret,
[4467] 4465. Possessing basis, essence, flower,
[4468] 4466. The very essence of all self-awareness.
[4469] 4467. Called the Great Perfection's essence,
[4470] 4468. Renowned among other tantras.
[4471] 4469. The secret tantra explained:
[4472] 4470. Scripture held by definite ones.
[4473] 4471. Nature empty, all-pervading.
[4474] 4472. That too: essence's nature.
[4475] 4473. Essence gathered, three clarities,
[4476] 4474. Three clarities, pervading cognition.
[4477] 4475. Three confidences, three non-returns—
[4478] 4476. Obtain definiteness of unchanging essence.
[4479] 4477. Three appearances, three emptinesses:
[4480] 4478. Essence: pure nature.
[4481] 4479. Established as tantra.
[4482] 4480. Basis, path, result—
[4483] 4481. Held definitively: nature-tantra.
[4484] 4482. Thus explained, tantra established.
[4485] 4483. Established through natural descent.
[4486] 4484. Thus called nature-itself tantra.
[4487] Thus,  4486. From the single nature of basis-awareness,  4487. Come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method.
[4488] THE SEVENTEEN TANTRAS
[4489] 4488. From nature: basis and essence.
[4490] 4489. Three quintessences, though designated with five different names,
[4491] 4490. Are not beyond one meaning-essence.
[4492] 4491. From that itself:
[4493] 4492. From the distinction of the single basis's essence,
[4494] 4493. Are called method and nature tantra.
[4495] 4494. Though they appear merely as designations,
[4496] 4495. The essence: single basis, empty nature,
[4497] 4496. Are not different, have no variation.
[4498] 4497. For example, a person—
[4499] 4498. If many names exist,
[4500] 4499. However called, appears so,
[4501] 4500. Meaning unchanged, likewise.
[4502] Thus,
[4503] SECOND: THE WORD TANTRAS, EXPLAINED EXTENSIVELY
[4504] Three: Enumeration, Purpose, Order.

[4526] These eighteen wrathful black ones are taught to protect the teachings, arisen from the tantra.
[4527] The other sixteen arise from the root of sudden sound.
[4528] From the cause of great sudden sound:
[4529] Twenty-seven refined lights taught.

[4540] Thus,
[4541] The Abode of These, Determined:
[4542] From the Pearl Garland:
[4543] Word tantras, clearly divided in sequence.
[4544] To cut elaboration, samsara's

[4635] Thus,
[4636] THIRD: ORDER, DETERMINED, GATHERED AT END
[4637] From order's eight sections:
[4638] 
[4639] FIRST: TWO ROOT TANTRAS
[4640] Relying on the eight root scriptures of perfect self-arisen:
[4641] Empowers and ripens those who enjoy elaborations through outer elaborations.
[4642] Relying on the six chapters of letterless tantra:
[4643] Shows the complete point of upadesha that ripens and liberates.
[4644] SECOND: EXPLANATORY MOTHER AND CHILD TANTRAS
[4645] Relying on the eighty-six chapters of explanatory tantra of rigpa self-arisen:
[4646] Shows the special clarity of the four: view, meditation, conduct, and result.
[4647] Relying on the nine chapters of rigpa self-liberated:
[4648] Shows the elimination of the mother's ground's object.
[4649] THIRD: TWO LIMB TANTRAS
[4650] Relying on the five chapters of jewel heap:
[4651] Shows qualities complete in themselves.
[4652] Relying on the three chapters of blazing body-relic:
[4653] Shows signs of body, speech, and mind, past and present.
[4654] FOURTH: TWO SCRIPTURE-LOGIC CLEAR TANTRAS
[4655] Relying on the six chapters of sudden sound:
[4656] Shows the root of all scriptural collections.
[4657] Relying on the seven chapters of auspicious beauty:
[4658] Identifies delusion's time, etc.
[4659] FIVE: FOUR UPADESHAS TANTRAS
[4660] Relying on the eight chapters of vajra-sattva heart-mirror:
[4661] Shows introduction and meeting,
[4662] Shows empowerment, samaya, etc.
[4663] Relying on the seven chapters of samantabhadra mind-mirror:  Shows the distinction and elimination of deviation and obscuration.  Relying on the three chapters of introduction adorned:  Shows examples, meanings, and signs with faith.  Relying on the eight chapters of pearl garland:  Shows instruction collected, causing awakening.  SIX: THREE INTENTION SELF-POSITION TANTRAS  Relying on the six chapters of six spaces:  Shows the purification of the six consciousnesses' birth-places and the emptying of the three realms.  Relying on the four chapters of blazing lamp:  Shows the four actual lamps.
[4664] Relying on the four chapters of sun-moon-joined:
[4665] Shows carrying the four intermediate states on the path.
[4666] SEVEN: TWO ENTERING SELF-LIBERATION TANTRAS
[4667] Relying on the thirteen chapters of lion-power dzogchen:
[4668] Supports bringing out the form of view.
[4669] Relying on the fourteen chapters of jewel arrangement:
[4670] Shows entering the yogi's path and tradition.
[4671] EIGHT: EXPERT RITUAL TANTRAS
[4672] Relying on the one hundred eight chapters of the glorious black wrathful tantra:
[4673] Protects the supreme teachings.
[4674] These too, from the Pearl Garland:
[4675] Ah! Thus all tantras—
[4676] Supreme wonder, great!
[4677] Thus all meanings explained.
[4678] The tantra sequence:
[4679] The two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence.
[4680] The two explanatory mother and child tantras explain as leaves spreading.
[4681] The two limb tantras explain like planets and stars arising from oceans.
[4682] The two scripture-logic clear tantras explain like flowers opening.
[4683] The four upadesha tantras explain as ripening results.
[4684] The three intention-self-abiding tantras explain as seeing the peak.
[4685] The two entering-self-liberation tantras explain as mindful basis and heart.
[4686] The expert ritual tantras explain like a dog that does the messenger's work.
[4687] Thus,
[4688] The Reason for Establishing Eight Sections:
[4689] If the two root tantras are lacking:
[4690] Like a trunk with rotten roots—branches cannot arise.
[4691] If the two explanatory mother and child tantras are lacking:
[4692] Like no leaves from that—no flowers arise.
[4693] If the two limb tantras are lacking:
[4694] Like climbing a cliff without limbs—one falls.
[4695] If the two entering-self-liberation tantras are lacking:
[4696] Like a corpse without a heart—cannot benefit others.
[4697] If the two scripture-logic clear tantras are lacking:
[4698] 
[4699] 
[4700] 
[4701] 
[4702] If no flowers exist, results do not ripen in time—like so.
[4703] If the four upadesha tantras are lacking:
[4704] If no results, agriculture is meaningless—like so.
[4705] If the three intention-self-abiding tantras are lacking:
[4706] Like a person without eyes not knowing the way, unable to enter a city.
[4707] If the expert ritual tantra is lacking:
[4708] Like a watchdog gone, wealth lost to thieves.
[4709] Thus, lacking those eight: the condition of the teachings is incomplete.
[4710] If they exist, complete: appropriate and certain in eight.
[4711] If more than that: not needed.
[4712] The Name and Meaning of the Eight Sections Explained:
[4713] Root: penetrated like roots—intends gathering into rigpa.
[4714] Explanation: spreading like leaves—intends merging words and meanings.
[4715] Branch: coiled like a trunk—intends non-duality of space and awareness.
[4716] Scripture-logic:
[4717] Clear like a flower—intends holding and showing the lamp's self-face.
[4718] Upadesha: ripening like results—intends making three kāyas into paths.
[4719] Intention self-abiding: liberation path seeing—intends making results into paths.
[4720] Entering self-liberation: mindfulness-awareness path cultivated, courageous ones—intends showing the lamp's very self-face.
[4721] Expert ritual: complete upadesha scripture—intends protecting the holy teachings and abiding long.
[4722] Examining their letters: called "root"—dharma's root gathered into rigpa.
[4723] Rigpa's root: emptiness, nature, grasped and freed.
[4724] Holding that tantra: rigpa meets its own face.
[4725] Worn: samādhi abides in itself.
[4726] Read: expressed meanings appear in mind.
[4727] Explained: supreme and common siddhis obtained.  Meditated: samsara expelled.
[4728] Listening, exercising the wisdom of the state.
[4729] Upadesha elaboration, word-upadesha cast into words—meaning does not reach immediately.
[4730] Essence-gathered meaning-upadesha, without depending on words—buddhahood.
[4731] Upadesha expression depending:
[4732] Inexpressible awareness-meaning arises in tantra.
[4733] Explanation words:
[4734] Depending on elaboration of words—demonstrates wisdom free of elaboration.
[4735] Intention:
[4736] Dharmatā transcending intervals, without gap.
[4737] That self-abiding, not arising from other.
[4738] Scripture:
[4739] Unchanging, stable—confidence arises.
[4740] Awareness:
[4741] Depending on that meaning—liberates to the Buddha level.
[4742] Clarity:
[4743] Knowledge clear—abides nowhere.
[4744] Faculty clear—distinguishes dharma and non-dharma.
[4745] Five faculties placed in themselves—the six aggregates merely tremble.
[4746] Holding those—transcend the three realms.
[4747] Entering emptiness, entering appearances—appearance-mind mouth-joined.
[4748] Entering appearance-emptiness—object and mind non-dual.
[4749] Self-liberated—uncontrived.
[4750] Expert:
[4751] Expert in time and crucial points: merely thinking accomplishes destruction.
[4752] Expert in action and completion: merely examining mind accomplishes without need for mantra and samādhi—steals life-force.
[4753] Expert in time mantra and samādhi: deity approaches, siddhis arise.
[4754] Expert in time approach-accomplish action-application: accomplishes self-wished benefits.
[4755] Expert in substance and offering: increases prosperity, accomplishes actions.
[4756] Thus established, from those:
[4757] For those liking mental elaboration—all shown.
[4758] For middling ones, those gathered into eight sections—accomplished by eight tantras.  For excellent ones, those transformed—tantra's meaning condensed.
[4759] Method divided: two.
[4760] Nature divided: three, five sufficient.
[4761] Excellent ones: meaning and word tantra two shown.
[4762] Very excellent, elaboration-free, basis tantra awareness alone accomplishes.
[4763] Awareness, tantra all complete reason.
[4764] From Thalgyur:

[4767] Self-nature letterless.
[4768] Self-awareness wisdom lamp light blazing.

[4773] Experience appearance wealth arranged.
[4774] Self-abide empty, heart mirror.
[4775] Error self-cut, mind mirror.
[4776] Other not-arisen, self-arise itself.
[4777] Self-arisen, thus self-liberated.

[4779] Qualities perfected, jewel pile.
[4780] Self-awareness shown, face-show adorned.
[4781] Appearance pure, sun moon joined.
[4782] Awareness ripening, body-relic blazing.
[4783] These all basis-arisen.
[4784] Thus said.
[4785] Or elaboration-possess: basis heart tantra bindu all.
[4786] Medium: seventeen.
[4787] Excellent: self-arisen seed tantra alone.
[4788] Peak: transcendent-future-three liberation explained.
[4789] From Ati Great Arrangement:
[4790] That meaning word various elaboration,
[4791] Elaboration-possess: basis-heart.
[4792] Elaboration-free: enumerate seventeen.
[4793] Very elaboration-free.
[4794] Very elaboration-free indeed,
[4795] Free from elaboration and its absence,
[4796] Transcendent-future-three liberated.
[4797] Thus it is spoken.
[4798] General meaning second, explanation method branch definite: three,
[4799] How explained manner,
[4800] Occasion basis definite enumeration,
[4801] Holy certain prophecy.
[4802] First: three,

[4804] THUS IS THE DEFINITIVE MANNER OF EXPLANATION ESTABLISHED,
[4805] The arising-basis of letters, their sounds and meanings hereby declared.
[4806] FIRST:
[4807] Though explanation methods are manifold, in summary they are established as three.
[4808] From Rigpa Rangdrol:
[4809] The King of Teachings' manner of explanation also
[4810] Is expounded according to this very occasion.
[4811] Scripture-style explanation and tantra-style explanation,
[4812] Instruction-style explanation—these three.
[4813] Through the gate of entry they are to be known.
[4814] Thus it is spoken.
[4815] There, scripture-style explanation is shown by means of the five perfections,
[4816] Tantra-style explanation is declared by means of the three definite abodes,
[4817] Oral instruction is explained by basis, path, and result—these three, from which
[4818] Here the main tantra-style explanation has three abodes:
[4819] For the sharp-facultied, by mentioning names, toward realization's face the tantra's name-meaning is expressed;
[4820] For the middling, by mentioning types only, toward realization's face the five perfect complete-abidings are shown; and
[4821] For the dull, with example and meaning, toward realization's face the body is extensively explained.
[4822] FIRST:
[4823] From that itself:
[4824] That also name explained is like this:
[4825] Name, homage, and promise.
[4826] Thus it is spoken.
[4827] SECOND:
[4828] Also from that itself:
[4829] The introduction shown is like this:
[4830] Teacher, Mother, and the retinue, and
[4831] Father's request—all are to be known.
[4832] Thus it is spoken.

[4839] Extremely great extensive explained.
[4840] That is shown by the text's words.
[4841] Conclusion's meaning is like this:
[4842] Oral instruction meaning untied explained,
