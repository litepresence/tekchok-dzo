[2903] Manifesting the path of the non-learner.
[2904] Third: the fruit of complete perfection.
[2905] Upon the ground of all-illumination, for self-purpose, the dharma-body,
[2906] Having obtained the two supreme form-bodies for the benefit of others,
[2907] Beholding all that is and the extent of all with the two wisdoms,
[2908] Working for the benefit of beings until samsara is emptied.
[2909] As the Entrance states:
[2910] "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
[2911] Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought,
[2912] Working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained.
[2913] This is appearance free from elaboration."
[2914] Thus it is taught.
[2915] The manner of these, extensively:
[2916] From self-appearing awareness.
[2917] The bodhisattva vehicle:
[2918] The doors of entry are the two truths: the ultimate and the conventional.
[2919] The manner of protection: the limbs of discipline—
[2920] Eighty-four vows,
[2921] View and wisdom of emptiness.
[2922] The ultimate and conventional are thus:
[2923] The conventional is conceived in two aspects: the false and the truly correct.
[2924] The false conventional is thus: all imputed appearances.
[2925] They appear in accord but possess the power to function.
[2926] When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence;
[2927] Meaning appears as if non-existent.
[2928] This is the false conventional.
[2929] The truly conventional is thus: the actions of the ten virtues,
[2930] The thoughts that become white,
[2931] The thoughts of faith to whatever extent—
[2932] Conceived as the truly conventional great:
[2933] Generosity, discipline, and so forth,
[2934] And concentration and so forth.
[2935] The truly conventional great.
[2936] The ultimate also has two aspects:
[2937] The nominal ultimate and the verbal ultimate,
[2938] The truly mental ultimate.
[2939] By the nominal ultimate, all are refuted and debated.
[2940] That also is the reasoning of valid cognition:
[2941] Whatever that nature is, it appears as such.
[2942] The great emptiness of words—
[2943] The meaning is empty, yet not realized.
[2944] The nominal ultimate.
[2945] The truly mental ultimate:
[2946] Emptiness utterly without anything, one thinks to meditate—
[2947] Like the empty sky,
[2948] The meaning of emptiness is just suchness itself.
[2949] Emptiness is unceasing, limitless.
[2950] Thus one acts and attaches.
[2951] The path is thus conceived,
[2952] One thinks to purify upon the ground.
[2953] That also has heat, patience arises—
[2954] Peak, world, supreme dharma.
[2955] 
[2956] 
[2957] 
[2958] 
[2959] 
[2960] Through three aspects of heat, it is taught.
[2961] The outer, the inner, and both together.
[2962] The outer heat arises thus:
[2963] The second: from the stainless.
[2964] Entities appear as empty.
[2965] That is the practice of concentration.
[2966] It is taught to arise in the two pure grounds.
[2967] The inner heat is the sixth.
[2968] Understanding the pure knowable as empty.
[2969] The heat of both is thus.
[2970] Seventh: it is taught to arise from the pure.
[2971] Eighth: patience is attained.
[2972] Ninth: the peak is reached.
[2973] Tenth: supreme dharma of the world.
[2974] Similarly, the ten grounds are obtained.
[2975] This is the vehicle of enlightenment.
[2976] Emptiness beyond words and letters.
[2977] Utterly without, one thinks emptiness.
[2978] Thus it is said.
[2979] Second: The explanation of established tenet views, divided into two.
[2980] The explanation of the mind-only and middle-way traditions.
[2981] First: All these appearing as white and red various appearances with consciousness, asserted by the mind-only school as truly real in the aspect of one's own mind—the true aspect of mind-only.
[2982] The false aspect of consciousness asserted by mind-only as false—these two.
[2983] First: Appearing to meaning, the aspect of one's own consciousness arises only outwardly.
[2984] As for example: When the image of a golden jewel hung upon a tree branch on the pond's bank appears in the water, the aspect of the jewel appears outwardly—just so.
[2985] In this, there is division.
[2986] The number of aspects is asserted to be the same as the number of consciousnesses.
[2987] Or asserting aspects and consciousnesses as split like an egg.
[2988] Or asserting aspects and consciousnesses as various and non-dual—these three.
[2989] First: When sound is heard, only the sound-holding consciousness arises.
[2990] As with form and so forth, the holding consciousness does not arise.
[2991] When consciousness enters an object, only that consciousness arises, others do not arise.
[2992] Whatever the number of aspects, that many consciousnesses are asserted.
[2993] Second: Appearances also arise from consciousness in various outer forms.
[2994] The holding consciousness also arises from mind.
[2995] As an egg is split, aspects and consciousnesses possessing objects appear in a single mind.
[2996] When holding objects now, outer aspect consciousness and inner-holding consciousness both arise.
[2997] Through beginningless latent tendencies, both appear thus.
[2998] Self-awareness alone, nothing else is established—like an egg is split.
[2999] If one says: "When outer aspect consciousness holds, at that time holding consciousness arises, two thoughts simultaneously"—it does not become.
[3000] It does not change.
[3001] That aspect consciousness is without thought—for this reason.
[3002] Third: When outer objects appear as various aspects,
[3003] A single inner-holding consciousness knows.
[3004] As when a monkey quickly enters a fortress,
[3005] Appearing in four apertures, entering and entering, looking and looking,
[3006] Entering through the five doors, a single consciousness knows the object.
[3007] At the moment of knowing, both aspect and consciousness are not different in the nature of a single mind.
[3008] Like a dream appearance and the self-appearing holder—both are undifferentiated in a single sleep consciousness.
[3009] Second: The false aspects.
[3010] The outer meaning aspect appearing mistakenly to consciousness is a false latent tendency.
[3011] Not true to consciousness.
[3012] The meeting consciousness also measures falsity.
[3013] Experience measures truth—no measurement exists.
[3014] Both object and consciousness are merely the nature of mistaken false appearance.
[3015] In this, there is division: the false with stain, the false intermediate, and that which is wished.
[3016] The stainless, the pure, and the intermediate—these two.
[3017] First: Now as various aspects appear,
[3018] Both meeting consciousnesses appear merely as the stain of intellect.
[3019] In ultimate truth, non-dual primordial wisdom exists with its qualities.
[3020] Nothing is established as consciousness.
[3021] The dharma-body of the Buddha has nothing remaining.
[3022] That non-dual primordial wisdom.
[3023] Is the stainless suchness.
[3024] At the time of the remainder, when a slight stain of latent tendencies appears mistaken.
[3025] And it is said that taste, back sickness, and so forth exist.
[3026] When now in mind, the stain of mixed affliction and wisdom is purified, removing the false part of affliction.
[3027] One wishes to manifest the pure wisdom of the remainder.
[3028] The pure is not established merely as false aspects and consciousness.
[3029] Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated in the small work of mind.
[3030] When is thinking unnecessary?
[3031] Like that likeness, appearing as non-appearing yet clear luminosity.
[3032] Therefore, objects appear as various white and red aspects.
[3033] Appearing like reflections, as if both measurer and measurer were non-existent.
[3034] It is said that in ultimate truth, only the self-aware wisdom of one's own experience exists.
[3035] Second: The middle-way school and the autonomous.
[3036] These two consequences.
[3037] First: Thus, various appearances appear, aspects and measurers non-apparent, merely clarity; in ultimate truth, not only the self-aware wisdom of one's own nature is non-existent by its very essence.
[3038] In this, there is division: those who assert illusion as ultimate.
[3039] And those who are completely non-abiding—these two.
[3040] First:
[3041] Nothing is established as objects.
[3042] Through unestablished awareness and wisdom, beyond speech and thought, merely in ultimate truth, existing as the manner of illusion.
[3043] The qualities of meditation and the grounds of the path.
[3044] Through the result at the end, obtaining the wisdom of Buddha like illusion, from the nature of dharma-body, working benefit like illusion.
[3045] From the intermediate mother.
[3046] All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion.
[3047] Nirvāṇa is also like a dream, like an illusion.
[3048] If something more excellent than nirvāṇa exists.
[3049] That also is like a dream, like an illusion.
[3050] All phenomena are merely various objects and consciousness.
[3051] Nirvāṇa attains form-body and works benefit.
[3052] Therefore, the excellent dharma is one's own self-aware suchness and the supreme dharma-body.
[3053] In this, there are those who assert illusion as established reasoning.
[3054] And those who assert appearance as merely illusion.
[3055] And those who assert merely illusion—various divisions beyond measure.
[3056] This is called the autonomous lower.
[3057] Second: In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides.
[3058] Since there are no objects or aspects, even the self-aware experience does not exist.
[3059] Like a barren woman's son, there is no meeting consciousness.
[3060] Since conventional truth is not true, ultimate truth is non-abiding.
[3061] When awakening from a dream, the appearance of horse and ox stops.
[3062] Since there is no beginning, meaning stops like unestablished cause.
[3063] From the intermediate mother.
[3064] In ultimate truth, samsara does not exist.
[3065] Nirvāṇa does not exist.
[3066] Emptiness does not exist.
[3067] It is merely designated by words—it is said.
[3068] In this, conventional truth is completely non-abiding.
[3069] Cause is non-abiding.
[3070] Distinction is non-abiding.
[3071] The distinguisher is non-abiding.
[3072] One is non-abiding.
[3073] Many is non-abiding.
[3074] Beyond one and many is non-abiding.
[3075] Mere appearance is completely non-abiding—various divisions beyond measure.
[3076] This is called the autonomous middle-way higher.
[3077] The consequentialist middle-way.
[3078] Thus, in ultimate truth, nothing is established.
[3079] All is negated: conventional appearance as merely illusion established, and so forth.
[3080] Asserting beyond nature from the extremes of existence and non-existence, free from all claims.
[3081] As the Noble King of Samadhi states:
[3082] Permanent and impermanent—this is also an extreme.
[3083] Existence and non-existence—both are extremes.
[3084] Therefore, both extremes are completely abandoned.
[3085] The wise one does not even abide in the middle.
[3086] Thus.
[3087] From the Ratnakuta Sutra:
[3088] The Tathagatas are permanent dharmas without birth.
[3089] All dharmas are like the Sugatas.
[3090] Since childish intellect grasps at signs,
[3091] One engages in the dharma that does not exist within the world.
[3092] Thus.
[3093] From the Root Wisdom:
[3094] Whatever depends and connects,
[3095] Through non-cessation, there is no birth.
[3096] Through non-annihilation, there is no permanence.
[3097] Through non-coming, there is no going.
[3098] Not different meaning, not single meaning.
[3099] Showing the cessation of elaboration, peace.
[3100] The perfect Buddhas speak.
[3101] Homage to that supreme one.
[3102] Thus.
[3103] From the Refutation of Refutations:
[3104] If I were to assert something exists,
[3105] Then I would have this fault.
[3106] Since I assert nothing,
[3107] I am only without faults.
[3108] Thus.
[3109] Since there is nothing to refute,
[3110] I refute nothing.
[3111] Therefore, it is said that one refutes.
[3112] You have imposed that imputation.
[3113] Thus.
[3114] And this also, since no view is established by intellect, one wishes for the cessation of elaboration.
[3115] Although placed as various mere appearances in the branch of conventional symbol-knowledge as worldly convention,
[3116] This also is not asserted.
[3117] One wishes to be free from the extremes of existence and non-existence and from the present time, beyond true and false appearance of dharma.
[3118] This is the summit of the established views of the Buddhas who assert suchness.
[3119] This great treatise is the six collections of middle-way reasoning.
[3120] The Root Wisdom.
[3121] The Sixty.
[3122] The Seventy on Emptiness.
[3123] The Fine Analysis.
[3124] The Refutation.
[3125] The Conventional Establishment.
[3126] Also this, from the speech of the noble Nagarjuna:
[3127] Composed the collection of words on the explanation of the first teaching, the dharma-wheel of the four truths.
[3128] Composed the collection of reasoning on the explanation of the dharma-wheel of the middle, characteristic-less dharmas.
[3129] Composed the collection of praise on the explanation of the dharma-wheel of the ultimate, distinguished dharmas.
[3130] Therefore, this master turns the dharma-wheel with the second Buddha.
[3131] These treatises are without distinction of teaching and difference.
[3132] The four divisions: establishing the vehicle of tantra as action, divided into two.
[3133] The presentation of the excellent mode of the causal vehicle.
[3134] And the explanation of the excellent vehicle itself.
[3135] First: Through the vehicle of characteristics, one must strive greatly with difficulty, accomplishing through great perseverance.
[3136] Through depending on causes, mantras ripen results with little effort, attaining Buddha, surpassing.
[3137] Through causes, the path of five, the ten grounds with great difficulty, over countless eons, to the Buddha.
[3138] Mantra: Excellent life alone.
[3139] The intermediate bardo.
[3140] Through least birth, through Buddha, quickly surpassing.
[3141] Even seeing the first truth of cause requires boundless collections and so forth.
[3142] Even accomplishing through subtle mantras, mandalas, offerings, and so forth, surpasses.
[3143] Not making emptiness in the direct path of cause.
[3144] Expedient meaning and definitive meaning.
[3145] Showing intention and hidden intention, arranging.
[3146] Mantra, shown directly in one moment, surpasses through freedom from obstacles and hindrances.
[3147] Briefly:
[3148] Accomplishing the meaning desired by the mantra vehicle through the causal vehicle.
[3149] Many means.
[3150] No difficulty.
[3151] Non-delusion.
[3152] Surpassing through sharp faculties accomplishing quickly.
[3153] From the lamp of the three modes.
[3154] Even if one meaning, non-delusion.
[3155] Many means, no difficulty.
[3156] Through control of sharp faculties.
[3157] Surpassing the excellent mantra vehicle.
[3158] Thus.
[3159] Second, from the five:
[3160] The essence is the self-arisen wisdom, the expanse of clear light, the truth directly realized, the supreme secret means.
[3161] The divisions of meeting the spontaneous expanse of generation and completion.
[3162] The definition is mantra, praised as supreme for quickly accomplishing enlightenment and protecting from affliction.
[3163] The purpose is to liberate the sharp sharpness of faculties.
[3164] The result is accomplished as supreme by Vajradhara in one life, the intermediate state, or through the path.
[3165] Divided into two.
[3166] The outer vehicle of Muni's tantra.
[3167] And the inner vehicle of means tantra.
[3168] Thus it is said.
[3169] From self-arisen awareness.
[3170] The vajra vehicle has two aspects.
[3171] The outer Muni tantra.
[3172] And the inner means tantra.
[3173] Thus.
[3174] If one asks what is placed as tantra in mantra:
[3175] When the main person's continuum meets the clear light of expanse, it is called "thus."
[3176] The first is divided into three.
[3177] The action tantra vehicle, Kriyā.
[3178] The both tantra vehicle, Upāya.
[3179] The yoga tantra vehicle, Yoga.
[3180] Thus it is said.
[3181] From that itself.
[3182] The outer tantra has three aspects.
[3183] Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga.
[3184] Thus.
[3185] First:
[3186] Accomplishing through the three purifications and pure conduct as self and deity, master and servant, attaining accomplishment.
[3187] This divides into two.
[3188] The main activity of purification.
[3189] The main activity of visualization.
[3190] First: Entering through bath and pure sound, meditating on the body as pure deity form.
[3191] Performing the three baths.
[3192] Changing the three garments.
[3193] Relying on the three whites.
[3194] And relying on the three sweets, etc.
[3195] From the lower, this surpassing manner.
[3196] Not establishing as true in the capacity of conventional appearance.
[3197] Through the three objects of meditation—visualizing forms, statues, images—all appearances become clear as deity forms.
[3198] Without abandoning form, not abiding in the extremes of one and many.
[3199] Meditating on speech syllables and letters, all sounds become clear as deity sounds, reciting mantras.
[3200] Not abiding in the four extremes of birth and cessation.
[3201] The sound extent is no other than the deity of sound.
[3202] Meditating on the mind's signs, all thoughts become clear as concentration deities.
[3203] Not departing from all thought through meditation, not abiding in great dependent origination.
[3204] Not even conventionally arising or born.
[3205] In ultimate truth, commitment deities, primordial wisdom beings.
[3206] Looking at the aspects of self, speech, and beings as master and servant, obstacles cease and accomplishments are obtained.
[3207] Depending on common accomplishments, conventional truth is not abandoned.
[3208] Depending on supreme accomplishments, ultimate truth is not established—thus surpassing.
[3209] The main activity of visualization is meditating on deity through the generation and completion stages, the subtle radiating and gathering.
[3210] Meditating on the deity's form, speech, and mind as the collection of forms, sounds, and thoughts.
[3211] The main activity of purification is through the purity of body and speech.
[3212] The main activity of the object is the meditation of mind.
[3213] Thus it is said.
[3214] From self-arisen awareness.
[3215] The established view of the Kriyā vehicle.
[3216] The door of entry is the three purifications.
[3217] Entering through bath and purity.
[3218] The samaya of protection is thus:
[3219] Not drinking even one cup of water.
[3220] Conducting without distraction.
[3221] Performing the three purifications of action.
[3222] The three purifications are:
[3223] The purification of deity and mandala.
[3224] The purification of substance and enjoyment.
[3225] The purification of mantra and concentration.
[3226] The view of realization is thus:
[3227] The two purifications of deity and yogi.
[3228] Viewing as master and servant.
[3229] The stage of abandonment is thus:
[3230] Abandoning meat, fish, onions.
[3231] And likewise alcohol, etc.
[3232] Attachment to concentration.
[3233] Such is the Kriyā vehicle.
[3234] Thus.
[3235] The fifth: The both tantra vehicle, Upāya.
[3236] Since one desires conduct as Kriyā and view as Yoga.
[3237] It is called the neutral vehicle.
[3238] Also this: Through bathing and purity, making the three doors pure.
[3239] Accomplishing the supreme mandala and so forth through the five manifest enlightenments and so forth.
[3240] Also this from self-arisen awareness.
[3241] Upāya is thus.
[3242] View as Yoga.
[3243] Conduct as Kriyā.
[3244] Therefore it is called the both tantra.
[3245] Thus.
[3246] The sixth: The yoga tantra vehicle.
[3247] Through the five doors of manifest enlightenment, viewing self and deity as brothers and friends, conducting samaya and purity.
[3248] Desiring to obtain through the great collection of the result wheel.
[3249] Divided: The main activity of action.
[3250] The main activity of concentration.
[3251] First: Performing ritual actions.
[3252] The supreme action king.
[3253] From the two supreme mandala kings.
[3254] Action, and scattered actions.
[3255] From the two: relying on the supreme action king.
[3256] Scattered actions rely on any ritual aspect, desiring enlightenment.
[3257] Offerings.
[3258] Tormas.
[3259] Fire offerings.
[3260] Continuous effort in recitation and so forth.
[3261] The supreme action king is practiced through all aspects of mandala accomplishment.
[3262] Desiring enlightenment through five or six means: tormas, fire offerings, and so forth.
[3263] The supreme mandala king:
[3264] Through ground rituals, relying on empowerment until one becomes a Buddha.
[3265] The main activity of concentration:
[3266] The first stage of preparation.
[3267] If relying on completely pure concentration.
[3268] One may meditate on a single deity.
[3269] Or meditate on the mandala wheel.
[3270] Generating through the five manifest enlightenments.
[3271] Through sun and moon, relying on means and wisdom, manifest enlightenment arises from meditating on the lotus, stacked high.
[3272] Through the door of completely perfect form adornment, manifest enlightenment in the completely pure sense fields.
[3273] Through the wheel of the syllables and letters Ālī Kālī, manifest enlightenment in the aspects of sound, words, and names.
[3274] The vajra of mind, signs, and embrace.
[3275] Through doors such as wheels and jewels, manifest enlightenment as Buddhas of each family.
[3276] Through the door of completely pure primordial wisdom beings, manifest enlightenment in the completely pure nature of reality through the five meditations.
[3277] The completely pure outer aggregates and elements.
[3278] The inner five actions and afflictions are completely purified.
[3279] The five secret objects and faculties are completely purified.
[3280] The five families become Buddhas as one's own self.
[3281] Meditating on commitment deity and self as brothers and friends.
[3282] Knowing no good cause for deity.
[3283] Accomplishment arises from oneself.
[3284] Realizing no bad cause for self, now as clear deity form in the illusion body—surpassing the lower.
[3285] Also this: Realizing the generation deity and self as non-dual.
[3286] Neither ultimate nor conventional name exists.
[3287] These also:
[3288] From self-arisen awareness.
[3289] The established view of yoga is thus.
[3290] The doors of entry are the five manifest enlightenments.
[3291] The view of realization as deity and friend.
[3292] Keeping the three samayas of protection without shame.
[3293] Pure conduct neither refutes nor establishes.
[3294] The five enlightenments are thus.
[3295] Enlightenment through the door of seat.
[3296] Enlightenment through the door of form.
[3297] Enlightenment through the door of emblem.
[3298] Enlightenment through the door of generation.
[3299] Enlightenment through the door of syllables and letters.
[3300] Thus the five enlightenments are practiced.
[3301] The three shameless ones—what are they?
[3302] Shamelessness through commitment deity.
[3303] Shamelessness through master, disciples, and friends.
[3304] Shamelessness through one's own mind.
[3305] Deity and yogi are also oneself.
[3306] Desiring the manner of brother and friend.
[3307] Meditating on deity and mandala as non-dual with self.
[3308] Deity also arises from self and dissolves into self.
[3309] Desiring the radiation and gathering of self and deity.
[3310] Thus.
[3311] The seventh: The presentation of the mahāyoga tantra vehicle—surpassing the lower.
[3312] The explanation of the supreme vehicle itself, divided into two.
[3313] First:
[3314] Relying on the outer three and the five whites, etc.
[3315] Conducting bath, purity, fasting, and dwelling, tormenting.
[3316] Conducting the inner five meats and five nectars, etc.
[3317] Relying on rigma and so forth, accepting and rejecting, purity and impurity—surpassing.
[3318] The lower cannot meditate on deity face union.
[3319] The inner surpasses through ability.
[3320] The outer does not realize the indivisible true view.
[3321] The inner surpasses through realization.
[3322] Second: From the five.
[3323] The essence:
[3324] The indivisible true, pure, equal primordial wisdom, liberation attained in one life through its play.
[3325] The etymology: Accomplishing great purpose through slight effort—the inner means vehicle.
[3326] The purpose: Obtaining the two accomplishments in one life.
[3327] The result: Reaching the level of Vajradhara in this life.
[3328] Divided: Mahāyoga tantra.
[3329] Anuyoga scripture.
[3330] Atiyoga instruction—three.
[3331] From self-arisen awareness.
[3332] The inner is divided into three.
[3333] Mahā, Anu, Ati.
[3334] Thus.
[3335] That: The mahāyoga tantra vehicle.
[3336] Meditating through the three doors of concentration, the main means of the generation stage, on the indivisible true, great clear empty light primordial wisdom.
[3337] Divided:
[3338] The main basis, path, and result.
[3339] The main accomplishment.
[3340] Three traditions desiring various paths to become.
[3341] First: The basis, cause of clarity.
[3342] The mind itself is the ultimate, free from elaboration, great distinguished, without effort—the great itself.
[3343] That essence: The basis mind and gold and its color—neither are dual.
[3344] Relying on the divisions of analyzed basis names, establishing definite situations.
[3345] The basis to be accomplished, accomplishing—realizing near the mind's characteristics.
[3346] That also distinguished by the concentration of basis abiding and self-liberation.
[3347] Clarifying the path.
[3348] Establishing through the path of manifest realization, pindārtha.
