[13831] Channel's nature generally shown,
[13832] Enumeration particularly explained,
[13833] Practice manner shown.
[13834] First is:
[13835] From Pearl Garland,
[13836] From channels bindu,
[13837] Subtle and quick essence-possessing,
[13838] By light rays itself beautiful.
[13839] That also three parts,
[13840] Right and left and middle.
[13841] Thus said,
[13842] Here those meanings explained—
[13843] Channel's chief three are:
[13844] Roma,
[13845] Kyangma,
[13846] Kun'darma.
[13847] That-also Roma is:
[13848] Taking all's taste, like salt,
[13849] Depending on bindu's bliss, experiencing uncommon enjoyment arises, thus called taste,
[13850] That also cause from desire-attachment arose, thus called ma,
[13851] Desire-attachment-possessor depending on that becomes buddha.
[13852] Or taste is few action-do, depending on bindu's confusion, experiencing enjoyment difficult to express, thus called ma.
[13853] From that's inside, relative bindu moving, method's nature-possessing.
[13854] Kyangma is:
[13855] Not crooked and branched, straight hollow called.
[13856] Nature-as from ultimate bindu and relative bindu both's cause,
[13857] Ultimate element and
[13858] Relative element mature and separate cause-do.
[13859] Straight is, thus unchanging.
[13860] All's basis is, thus called mo.
[13861] Depending on this, without effort becomes buddha.
[13862] Kun'darma called is:
[13863] All gathering,
[13864] Depending on this, bindu and
[13865] Channel's bliss and
[13866] Wind's bliss all arise, thus ku called,
[13867] That pervading general, thus called darma.
[13868] That-also Roma is:
[13869] From navel's left, coils all from right move,
[13870] Kyangma is:
[13871] From heart peak's left exit,
[13872] From throat channel's net exit,
[13873] From cranium's inside return-enter, left eye door open.
[13874] Roma is:
[13875] From right eye.
[13876] Kun'darma is:
[13877] Center straight abides,
[13878] Three peaks branched, door central crown Brahma-aperture light making,
[13879] Then awareness thought-free body arises.
[13880] Right peak right ear light,
[13881] Karma wind moves,
[13882] Its branch subtle two nostrils two pierce, karma wind doing and together moves,
[13883] Wind Avadhuti enters and wind concentration meditation support does.
[13884] Left ear one peak pierced, from that wisdom wind arises.
[13885] Left channel nature bindu,
[13886] Right channel conventional bindu.
[13887] That also right conventional bindu depending, body ripening does.
[13888] That itself body bliss and suffering and equanimity and
[13889] Elements growing and deteriorating etc. action does.
[13890] Upon that, four subtle knots exist—
[13891] Navel and
[13892] Memory and
[13893] Tastes and
[13894] Peak four.
[13895] First cause producing channel produced, channel's inside father's cause bindu white mustard-seed ten-divided portion only abides.
[13896] Depending on that, body upward growing born, thus "cause" called.

[14005] Impure body-speech-mind three ripening basis does,
[14006] Perverted three poisons arising door opens.
[14007] That also Roma called—
[14008] Sealed supreme food like taste experience does,
[14009] Nature placed dead taste like, thus unable to benefit.
[14010] This itself male's right, female's left exists.
[14011] Some tantras reversed shown, but intention different only.
[14012] Kyangma is:

[14085] Kun'darma both's center not-changing abiding—
[14086] Uncontrived meaning basis great perfection all pointing.
[14087] Second, special channels three's purifier:
[14088] Roma's vital point skilled, body's action all purifies,
[14089] Kyangma speech and
[14090] Kun'darma mind action done purifies.
[14091] Third, those channels' indication:
[14092] Roma bliss thought-free indicates, that itself dependent-origination wheel turned, memory exhausted taste form like becomes, thus Roma called.
[14093] Kyangma:
[14094] Clear many tastes one indicates, bindu single meaning abides, thus Kyangma called.
[14095] Kun'darma union non-dual indicates, method bliss and wisdom emptiness union and

[14110] Its branch breast peak from gathered.
[14111] Those branches sixteen sutra-gathering on exists.
[14112] Male's ribs between exists.
[14113] Those body attachment and abiding and destruction action near-taking does.
[14114] Kyangma:

[14136] 
[14137] 
[14138] left-in exists always doubt and uncertainty in dwell
[14139] tip that change always suffering many and mind unhappy
[14140] rtsa that slip always mind light virtue in engage
[14141] rtsa that mouth open always effort great and engage complete
[14142] that-also body-by rtsa produce
[14143] rtsa-by speech produce
[14144] speech-by mind produce
[14145] mind-by chos-nyid produce
[14146] chos-nyid-by yogi-to produce produce called
[14147] five rtsa those-by action what does is

[14206] Word-syllables secret-mantra's self-sound.
[14207] Kun'darma mind's movement memory-thought pure dharmata joined, thought before-after self-ceased self-liberated self-arisen wisdom joined, object-condition dharmata liberated,
[14208] Memory-thought self-exhausted dharmata's intention arises.
[14209] Thus:
[14210] Body three-body mandala body,
[14211] As spoken mantra words,
[14212] As thought meditation itself.
[14213] Thus Pearl Garland Tantra spoken.
[14214] That also channel's ripeness divided, channel's own characteristic definite,
[14215] Abode place sought, channel arising dharmata known,
[14216] Channel's leap time known, death-transference and birth-place known,
[14217] Channel's nature sealed, mind concentration wheel not-separated,
[14218] Channel coiled heat measure held, always food yoga becomes,
[14219] Channel transference calculation followed, clothes yoga becomes,
[14220] Channel sent vital point followed, latencies stream-cut purpose channels' vital point very profound.
[14221] Second, four wheels' distinction two:
[14222] Four wheels' establishment and
