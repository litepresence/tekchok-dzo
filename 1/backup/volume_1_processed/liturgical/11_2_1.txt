[13332] On the fourth day, by elemental power manifesting,
[13333] Eight-petaled wheels arise, clear lights and syllables illuminating—
[13334] Gathering wheels of taste like starlight radiantly resounding,
[13335] Wheels stacked like petals—thus the channel wheels are named.

[13350] The actual power of the above element-basis exhausted,

[13352] The basis-of-all's four supports with their groups solidified,
[13353] Affliction-gathering and coarse channel poison's vapor, like poison-vase gathering, abides—
[13354] Tip-Arranged Wheel thus it is named and abides.
[13355] On the thirty-fifth day, the King's Letter Tantra complete arises from this.
[13356] Thus seven by seven sections, existence body's channel wheels four produced—
