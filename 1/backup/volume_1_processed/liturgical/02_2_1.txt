[1504] That also: certain birth to new lower-realms by misdeed performed, exist this, go other land lower-realms, empty not-born here.
[1505] Then humans destroy: gradually decrease life year, die by disease eon at ten life year,
[1506] Passed three small eons harm by weapon famine,
[1507] One human obtained concentration two without taught by anyone this Jambu continent,
[1508] From arose that, said speak extremely bliss this joy arisen from seclusion,
[1509] Effortless all heard, equipoise accomplished, born light god,
[1510] Like Jambu continent empty,
[1511] Body-elevated continent and cow-enjoyment also became that-like.
[1512] Sound-not-heard thirty-three born.
