[3730] third
[3731] Free from the extremes of is and is-not, beyond directional fixation,
[3732] Self-nature without reliance, causeless, primordially pure—
[3733] Beyond fabrication and correction, through primordial liberation the great expanse beyond extremes is set forth.
[3734] The great primordial wisdom of self-purified abiding, liberated from the beginning, is called "the exhaustion of self-basis."
[3735] This too, through the reasoning that engages deluded mind, is intended as self-liberation.
[3736] The essence is the nature of khra-bo (the variegated space).
[3737] Speaking of manifold existence:
[3738] Free from negation, directionless, self-arising everywhere—
[3739] In spontaneous play, beyond affirmation and negation, this is intended.
[3740] These divide into three:
[3741] Assertion of existence corresponds to the Mind School, the khra-bo category;
[3742] Assertion of non-existence corresponds to the Self-Essential Point, the khra-bo category;
[3743] Assertion of both existence and non-existence corresponds to Supreme Instruction, the khra-bo category.
[3744] The first:
[3745] The essence of self-purified abiding, nowhere divided, not established as affirmation or negation, transcends conceptual construction.
[3746] Without duality in characteristic, it does not depart from the single wheel of mind's existence.
[3747] Through that very activity, unceasingly radiant—
[3748] It is called "the liberation of appearance and mind without duality."
[3749] This too, through the reasoning of thought-free self-nature, intends the primordial liberation of all phenomena, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated from their own ground.
[3750] The second:
[3751] Through the self-nature of appearance-emptiness liberated from its own ground, dharmatā of mind is radiantly displayed in manifold forms.
[3752] Through liberation of non-appearance from its own ground, action is freed from virtue and non-virtue.
[3753] This too, through the reasoning of transformation into emptiness, establishes non-appearance as self-purified.
[3754] The third:
[3755] Through self-emptiness, primordially pure, not relying on action's cause and effect—
[3756] Through fabrication, it arises;
[3757] Through arising as emptiness, it liberates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in all directions.
[3758] Through appearance and concept as ground, the reasoning of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's non-establishment appears.
[3759] Through inexpressibility, the essential point beyond thought;
[3760] Through being beyond comparison, the essential point beyond meditation;
[3761] Through liberation from the two of abiding and transformation, the essential point of mind free from transformation—
[3762] Through these three, the manifestation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's true form is intended.
[3763] The essence of white space, through the self-liberation of appearance and conditions, without fabrication, pure cause, not to be established in any mode of abiding.  [3764] Divided—
[3764] From action's vast expanse, the White Space of ineffable teaching,
[3765] From the union of view and meditation, the two White Spaces:
[3766] The first:
[3767] The essence is liberated through direct seeing of the nature.
[3768] The abiding is self-purified.
[3769] When divided:
[3770] Ocean Space and
[3771] Sky Space—these two.
[3772] The essence of Ocean Space, eternally self-liberated beyond extremes,
[3773] Liberated through non-action, it is liberation itself.
[3774] Without the two extremes of multiplicity.
[3775] These divide into two:
[3776] Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space.
[3777] The first:
[3778] Mind's self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated,
[3779] When relied upon, mind-emptiness is thoroughly purified,
[3780] The self-purified dharmatā of appearance-emptiness, from the beginning inexpressible,
[3781] Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness's transcendence, it is empty—
[3782] By emptiness, nowhere is anything established—this is the intent.
[3783] The Small Ocean Space:
[3784] Through self-purified reliance, the mind is without stain,
[3785] Through the particular abiding in purity, conditions are from the beginning inexpressible—this is the intent.
[3786] The essence of Sky Space:
[3787] Dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated.
[3788] When divided, these are two:
[3789] Sun-Moon Space and
[3790] Jewel White Space—these two.
[3791] The first:
[3792] The essence is utterly pure emptiness,
[3793] Self-nature unborn, primordially liberated.
[3794] The second:
[3795] Qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions self-purified,
[3796] Through non-action toward the mind, dharmatā is spontaneously accomplished—this is the intent regarding causes and conditions.
[3797] The essence of the Infinite Space expanse, when appearing to the mind, is known,
[3798] When not appearing, it is known by the mode of abiding.
[3799] When divided, there are three:
[3800] The Outer Infinite Space free from action,
[3801] The Inner Infinite Space of the view's own position,
[3802] The Secret Infinite Space of radiance and obstacle-removal,
[3803] The Infinite Space of that-which-is itself.
[3804] The first:
[3805] Through causelessness, no reversal—this is the key point,
[3806] Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed—this is the key point,
[3807] Through the absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nowhere established—this is the key point.
[3808] Also, through uncontrivance toward the mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcending non-samsāra.
[3809] Through mind without cause-sign, the non-dual object of desire.
[3810] The second:
[3811] Through not relying on the eight vehicles, the exertion of progression is abandoned,
[3812] Though appearances arise in manifold forms, liberation comes from the one—not-ceased self-nature arising, so it is called.
[3813] That also, the ultimate of the great perfection's accomplishment:
[3814] Self-appearance, directionless, all-pervasively self-arising,
[3815] Whatever is not rejected is completely perfected,
[3816] The basis of all phenomena, in whatever direction, is not exceeded.
[3817] Dharmatā arising in manifold forms, even in India, is not exhausted.
[3818] The third:
[3819] Appearance, when drawn into mind, the rays of self-awareness clearly manifest,
[3820] Appearance not rejected, completely perfected,
[3821] The rays of mind's continuity, through recollection and meditation clearly manifest—recollection and meditation perfected in dharmatā, thus continuity emptied and purified, so it is called.
[3822] Perception and awareness entering, through severance of non-dual connection, saṃsāra's essence is completely liberated, so it is called.
[3823] The great perfection of self-arising desire:
[3824] Through view being non-existent, beyond conceptual imputation,
[3825] Through meditation being non-existent, without acceptance, rejection, negation, or establishment,
[3826] Through conduct being non-existent, action is liberated in dharmatā,
[3827] Through result being non-existent, non-attainment abides in itself.
[3828] Among these, when divided:
[3829] Enumeration is beyond measure.
[3830] The spreading of key-points—that very suchness's vast compassion:
[3831] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's dharmas, arising in the käya and jñāna of appearing-awareness, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa wherever not divided—dharmatā, so it is called.
[3832] That also, through dual proliferation of the non-changing mark and appearing-awareness, saṃsāra is reversed.
[3833] The key-point of clearly seeing one's own face, through self-and-other proliferation of recollection and meditation, thought is completely purified, so it is called.
[3834] Through non-existence of outer and inner objects, bliss without concepts, awakening—so it is called.
[3835] Through freedom from action, mind is beyond,
[3836] Through self-knowing examination, bliss and suffering have equal taste—so it is called.
[3837] These too, when gathered, are collected into three.
[3838] The space free from action, through non-doing, is liberated into the dharmatā of self-liberation—
[3839] Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation.
[3840] Thus it is said.
[3841] The space of ornament:
[3842] Appearance is the continuity of mind,
[3843] The ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty, so it is called.
[3844] Furthermore:
[3845] Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived.
[3846] Thus it is said.
[3847] The space of play:
[3848] The play without direction, unceasing, arises,
[3849] The transformation of appearance and mind does not occur, so it is called.
[3850] Furthermore:
[3851] For the sake of liberating all into the completely pure path.
[3852] Thus it is said.
[3853] The space of dharmatā:
[3854] Abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not,
[3855] The basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing and knowing are non-dual.
[3856] Furthermore:
[3857] The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond all.
[3858] Thus it is said.
[3859] The section distinguishing the threefold teaching—the supreme complete teaching of the path that is distinctive—is:
[3860] The essential point of the path is the essential point of entering the essence, like a spark striking flint.
[3861] This is divided into three:
[3862] Taught in the manner of oral transmission,
[3863] Taught in the manner of symbolic instruction,
[3864] Taught in the manner of self-arisen tantric scripture.
[3865] Among these, the essence of oral transmission is:
[3866] The path of action, beyond the intellect, is practiced.
[3867] The division:
[3868] The instruction that cuts the extremes of fixation,
[3869] The two instructions that manifest the confidence of liberation and the purity of means.
[3870] The first:
[3871] At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, without relying—when distinguishing from the basis,
[3872] Even the mere word of elaboration is not established,
[3873] The elaboration of designation does not exist,
[3874] In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter—so it is said.
[3875] Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted,
[3876] The ultimate meaning of cessation.
[3877] The second:
[3878] From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur,
[3879] At the time of the three käyas appearing on the path,
[3880] Whatever is not liberated does not exist,
[3881] At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.
[3882] The essence of symbolic instruction: non-deluded, thought-free.
[3883] Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping.
[3884] Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping.
[3885] When divided, there are two:
[3886] The oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness,
[3887] The oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.
[3888] The first:
[3889] Through the vital-point wind abiding in the channels, the mind's own diligence through instruction—from the very source of dharmatā, the activity of averting harm,
[3890] Through that spreading, the essential point of severing the debate between buddhas and sentient beings,
[3891] Through the wind vital-point descending into the body, the essential point of severing the connection between body and mind,
[3892] Through the root wind exhausted in the extreme, the essential point of arising's self-liberation.
[3893] The second:
[3894] Through the vast expanse's aspect—never departing anywhere—the pervasion and estimation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3895] Through essence-grasping being free in dharmadhātu's emptiness, the estimation of phenomena's transformation,
[3896] Through non-fabrication in the expanse, that-which-is-called self-arisen wisdom.
[3897] The essence of the self-arising tantra's instruction—all commands' source—is clear in the arising ground.
[3898] The unique is cut by the axe of distinctive knowing.
[3899] Through non-duality in self-nature, the cessation of saṃsāra's reliance,
[3900] Through characteristic not established as words or letters,
[3901] Emptiness is free from the ground of dispute.
[3902] When divided, there are four:
[3903] Commanded in the manner of view's thorough investigation,
[3904] Commanded in the manner of removing obscurations,
[3905] Commanded in the manner of bringing forth the hidden to manifestation,
[3906] Commanded in the manner of self-clarifying explanation.
[3907] The first:
[3908] Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground,
[3909] Action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation,
[3910] Through self-nature's emptiness arising in all aspects—action, virtue, and non-virtue not abandoned—buddhas and sentient beings do not exist.
[3911] Through characteristic not established as words or letters, the dharma of all vehicles—through non-transcendence—is the essential point of the single sovereign's path.
[3912] When divided: the view clinging to appearance and concept—non-arising,
[3913] The investigation of mind's realization—all doubts released—these are two.
[3914] The first:
[3915] Through essence being without dharma, even the name of buddha does not exist.
[3916] Through self-nature radiating as energy, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear as the view.
[3917] Through characteristic not established as one, view and meditation are without measure.
[3918] The second:
[3919] Through essence being unproduced and completely purified, afflictions are self-liberated,
[3920] Through self-nature being unceasing and pervasively arising, acceptance and rejection do not exist at all,
[3921] Through characteristic being causeless and self-liberated, the path of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is exhausted.
[3922] Through the essence of gtar-ka's obstacle-clearing, the essential point of dharmatā is clarified,
[3923] At the boundary of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa:
[3924] Through self-nature being unobstructed, the ground-basis is without the stain of ignorant mind,
[3925] Through characteristic being causeless and the basis being pure, confusion is self-pacified.
[3926] When divided, there are two:
[3927] The removal of obstacles in the heat and clarity of view and meditation,
[3928] The removal of obstacles in the manner of abiding of phenomena.
[3929] The first:
[3930] The heat of view is the connection between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3931] That also: when view moves, the dharmatā of cyclic existence settles as the non-dual equality of movement and stillness.
[3932] At the time of view's attainment, heat arises in body and speech,
[3933] Like fire blazing in wood.
[3934] At the time of view's stability, the distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is:
[3935] Like an army conquering a fortress.
[3936] At the time of meditation's movement, wind and mind are gathered,
[3937] Like entering the treasure-house of the body's channels.
[3938] At the time of meditation's attainment, mind enters the path,
[3939] Like a wild boar being tamed.
[3940] At the time of meditation's stability, the strength of awareness is found—
[3941] Like the royal lineage bestowing empowerment from the universal sovereign.
[3942] At the time of conduct's movement, the distant reach of knowing, with heart-wind rising,
[3943] Like a garuḍa's complete wings or a companion flying into the sky.
[3944] At the time of conduct's stability, the heat and clarity of the three bodies is attained,
[3945] Like the absorption of Brahmā.
[3946] Also, through conduct, appearance is purified, so the dharmatā of appearance and conditions is without path of effort.
[3947] Through the removal of obstacles in meditation's movement, the path of recollection, samādhi, and concentration is without path of effort.
[3948] Through the removal of obstacles in view's dharmatā, the path of buddhahood beyond reliance on phenomena is without path of effort.
[3949] Through the removal of obstacles in the manner of abiding of phenomena, the essence of dharmatā is without fabrication—whatever appears, mind does not conceptualize.
[3950] Through self-nature without cause and fruition, without self-wish, there is no place to go,
[3951] Through characteristic not needing familiarization, not depending on other knowables.
[3952] Through the essence of the hidden and manifest being unobtainable,
[3953] Hope does not reach anywhere.
[3954] Through self-nature without direction, doubt is nowhere.
[3955] Through characteristic examined and not found, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten—so it is called.
[3956] When divided, there are two:
[3957] Concealing one, revealing and emerging two,
[3958] Concealing two, revealing and emerging one.
[3959] The first:
[3960] If view and conduct are revealed and emerge, and meditation is concealed,
[3961] That nature in union without beginning or end—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning and end are cut.
[3962] That nature's two are not different—in the bindu without outside or inside,
[3963] Without dependence on characteristic—causeless openness.
[3964] If conduct is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge,
[3965] Abiding in emptiness, purified through emptiness—so it is called.
[3966] If view is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge, through grasp-free knowledge arising directionlessly,
[3967] Awareness without object, liberation beyond concepts—so it is called.
[3968] The second: concealing two, revealing one:
[3969] If meditation is revealed and emerges, awareness free from aim arises—causeless fruition abides in itself—so it is called.
[3970] If conduct is revealed and emerges, body cast to the precipice, mind sent to dharmatā—so it is called.
[3971] If view is revealed and emerges, mind delivered to emptiness, body and speech brought to the essential point—so it is called.
[3972] The fourth: the essence of self-clarifying explanation—word-attachment's stream is cut, the established view does not dwell, the establishment is specially supreme,
[3973] Self-nature not perceived, completely pure, primordial purity's dharmatā that arises directionlessly—so it is called,
[3974] Characteristic not mind, self-pure movement, without done to the basis—so it is called.
[3975] That divided, there are three:
[3976] Speaking in the manner of error's messenger,
[3977] Speaking in the manner of reversing error at its basis,
[3978] Speaking of the bindu brought to its own vital point.
[3979] The first essence: error's root, ignorance, laid as the basis of saṃsāra in the three realms,
[3980] That same one pursuing itself, ignorance's root is cut.
[3981] Called "first self-awareness."
[3982] Self-nature arising as manifold, through the messenger of cause and condition pursuing,
[3983] The focus on objects severed, saṃsāra and error's basis exhausted—causeless emptiness, primordially pure, so it is called.
[3984] Through error being self-purified in characteristic, the path of error's knowledge is exhausted, so it is called.
[3985] That divided, there are three:
[3986] The manner of cutting error at the root, reversing the view of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3987] The manner of leaving error to itself, recognizing the dharmatā of non-error,
[3988] The manner of embracing the basis of error, cutting the stream of error's wheel.
[3989] The first essence:
[3990] Error's root—awareness that is the same, knowing itself as self-liberated—primordial error that is not experienced, seal obtained, beyond error and impurity,
[3991] Self-nature as different error, the measure of all imagination obtained, beyond object and subject.
[3992] Characteristic: knowing error as error, the heat and measure of non-error obtained.
[3993] The second essence:
[3994] First, through error not experienced, ignorance's continuum is pure,
[3995] Now, not dwelling in error, the basis of action and affliction is empty,
[3996] Later, error becomes impossible, the cord of action's virtue and sin is cut.
[3997] Self-nature without difference—the basis of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is one,
[3998] Error is completely pure,
[3999] Characteristic: without error's cause, the three realms are tossed like a sack.
[4000] The third essence:
[4001] The basis of falling-doers empty, the unobtainable basis is held,
[4002] Self-nature beyond calculation—even as merely non-error, without establishment,
[4003] Characteristic: duality not established, error and non-error separated.
[4004] The third: the essence of bindu brought to self-abiding—alone, free from elaboration, without many parts,
