[17644] Meaning second mind and jnana difference on two
[17645] Essence briefly-shown and
[17646] Each own-nature extensively-explained
[17647] First is
[17648] Pearl garland from
[17649] Mind and jnana distinction
[17650] Scholars through of know should
[17651] Thus arise through of
[17652] Mind is
[17653] Root non-Awareness and equal-possessing stain possessing Dharma samsara self-same jnana sun obscuring through of cloud like
[17654] Jnana is
[17655] Dharmakaya and equal-possessing stain not-possess and mind recollection-thought together nonabiding sun like
[17656] That same from
[17657] Mind is latencies all basis
[17658] Embodied beings stain
[17659] Grasp object on hold mind
[17660] That reason samsara Dharma-nature
[17661] Thus and
[17662] Again
[17663] Jnana recollection-basis itself and separate
[17664] Thus
[17665] Six-expanse from also
[17666] Mind and jnana self essence not-distinguish if
[17667] Sun cloud-masses through of obscured and like outer appearance meaning do impossible thus
[17668] That-also mind
[17669] Karma and afflictions and latencies all basis and source and accumulate-do and all from arise and
[17670] Non-Awareness house in always abide through of jnana sun and oppose and obscure
[17671] Self-arisen from
[17672] Mind is latencies all gather
[17673] Mind is afflictions all accumulate
[17674] Mind is latencies all basis
[17675] Latencies that also cut difficult through of
[17676] Self appearance obscure do
[17677] Nescience equal as abide through of
[17678] Thus and
[17679] Mu-tig string from
[17680] Mind indeed gather-assembly arise through of purpose
[17681] Defilement itself and also coat through of
[17682] Alaya gather through of mind to etcetera
[17683] Defilement through of number as become through of indeed
[17684] Thus
[17685] That-also Rigpa to obstruct-do mind that exist as possess through of sentient beings called
[17686] Mind that through of karma accumulate through of delusion itself delusion one from one to samsara through of karma do
[17687] Mind that Rigpa from liberate
[17688] Pure exhausted purify if Buddha called
[17689] Rigpa defilement and free through of purpose
[17690] That through of from free-object defilement through of assembly true indeed
[17691] Mind only indeed
[17692] That itself from
[17693] Mind that free if Buddha
[17694] Body-possess all through of defilement exhausted
[17695] Migrate beings indeed mind that through of migrate
[17696] That not-if migrate as able is nonexistent
[17697] That purpose migrate delusion-wheel like
[17698] Thus
[17699] Mind that also object appear this and this called symbol and name and universal grasp through of grasp object through of mind and
[17700] That through of distinction to investigate and detail as analyze grasp through of subject through of mind two as gather indeed
[17701] Grasp object to grasp mind
[17702] Thus explain indeed
[17703] These need from common gi text from also
[17704] Mind cease that body through of directly do
[17705] Thus and
[17706] Tshig-gsal-to
[17707] Mind and mind from arise through of enter also continuous break and
[17708] Dkon-mchog pile from
[17709] Mind and mind and consciousness and also free
[17710] Samadhi through of abode also not-abandon
[17711] This indeed tathagata through of heart through of secret thought through of not-fathomable called
[17712] Pristine-awareness indeed
[17713] Space like elaboration cease and Buddha through of Dharma measureless through of ground and source wheel pristine awareness ocean through of assembly and together chos-kaya through of home in always abide through of affliction and habit through of thicket all burn through of fire like abide
[17714] Pearl garland from
[17715] Conceptions all burned through of
[17716] Jnana itself fire like consume
[17717] Space itself and equal
[17718] Empty-luminous Awareness-possess itself
[17719] Thus
[17720] Here not-know some
[17721] Mind not-possess if inanimate or darkness like become thus also learning small
[17722] Mind not-possess though jnana exist through of Awareness cease not through of reason
[17723] That-also non-Awareness delusion mind cease through of
[17724] Jnana clear sun arise
[17725] Night dawn through of day rise like
[17726] Some is
[17727] Non-Awareness Awareness pervader is through of
[17728] Mind cease time Awareness cease think also very mistake great
[17729] Awareness through of non-Awareness outward pervade though
[17730] Non-Awareness inward not-pervade Buddha jnana like
[17731] Mind on non-Awareness through of pervade through of
[17732] Mind pervader as suitable
[17733] Awareness on not-pervade through of
[17734] Non-Awareness Awareness expanse from cease or continuum break think
[17735] Therefore mind cease time basis non-Awareness part possessing cease though
[17736] Awareness unceasing cease basis Awareness is through of reason
[17737] Awareness-also not-possess if what top on cease think suitable
[17738] Here non-Awareness mind part possessing cease through of Awareness jnana expand and two-knowledges on enjoy
[17739] Pearl garland from
[17740] Mind is movement all separate through of
[17741] Inanimate like not
[17742] Know and Awareness on clear do appear
[17743] Thus spoken
[17744] There mind and jnana each-other
[17745] Common body from also
[17746] Mind and mind-itself nature through of pure two distinguish
[17747] That on mind is all-conception samsara Dharma
[17748] Mind-itself is elaboration and free nirvana Dharma
[17749] Arya prajnaparamita eight-thousand from also
[17750] Mind on mind nonexistent
[17751] Mind nature luminosity is thus spoken
[17752] Mind on thus is basis gather essence nature show through of
[17753] Mind elaboration-possess thought defilement through of Dharma emanate gather and one-pointed higher-realms enter like indeed nature nonexistent
[17754] Sems-by-means-of nature
[17755] Sems-by-means-of natural-state
[17756] Mind itself called name through of enumeration that itself through of character luminous pristine awareness as abide thus arise
[17757] Mind and mind-itself distinguish as not-know through of fool through of also pitaka know as arrogant indeed display arrogance-possess as only
[17758] Thus mind and pristine awareness well separate from common object-possess through of vehicle to mind to ground path fruit as do although
[17759] That all meaning directly not-arrive through of
[17760] Vehicle this to pristine awareness to Buddha through of ground path fruit as enumerate through of

[17766] Thus say
[17767] Err manner indeed

[17772] Desire from Buddha not-accomplish and accomplish although reverse result
[17773] Grasp-grasp from not-liberated through of purpose
[17774] Also mind habit and karma various gather like
[17775] Ground path fruit also that to result
[17776] Desire if delusion as result through of flaw exist indeed
[17777] Opponent through of this thus
[17778] Mind nonexistent if that through of also Buddha not-reason
[17779] Buddha that bya-mind through of distinction through of done as you also desire through of purpose
[17780] Answer say
[17781] Mind nonexistent and exist through of Buddha become not-thing

[17919] Thus spoken like
[17920] Impure mind distinction if two
[17921] Briefly-shown and
[17922] Extensively-explained
[17923] First is expanse on impure nonexistent though
[17924] That from move time basis-appearance from cut impossible what also arise
[17925] Non-Awareness play from mind
[17926] Mind ornament from intellect
[17927] Intellect from affliction arise
[17928] That also play is capacity or power or ray like that from arise tone just
[17929] Seed from sprout and
[17930] Face form from that reflection mirror in arise like
[17931] Ornament is that from ripen arise grain portion just seed flower and mark like
[17932] That like also self-arisen from
[17933] Completely pure primordial-pure appearance on non-Awareness nonexistent
[17934] Mind not-exist
[17935] Intellect nonexistent though
[17936] Spontaneous-accomplishment power from
[17937] Non-awareness arise
[17938] Non-Awareness play from mind arise
[17939] Mind ornament from intellect arise
[17940] Intellect object from five-poisons arise
[17941] Five-poisons from afflictions sixteen arise
[17942] Sixteen from twenty-five arise
[17943] That from fifty-one arise
[17944] That from thousand eight ten four arise thus
[17945] Second extensively-explained on three
[17946] Root ignorance genitive division
[17947] That from arisen mind genitive division
[17948] That from arisen affliction genitive division extensively explained
[17949] First is again that itself from
[17950] Ignorance this like
[17951] Root mind genitive ignorance and
[17952] Confusion object genitive ignorance and
[17953] Confusion-basis basis genitive ignorance and
[17954] Grasping thought genitive ignorance and
[17955] Artificial path genitive ignorance and
[17956] Not-knowing delusion genitive ignorance and
[17957] Thus ignorance form six as arisen and self genitive appear not-see go says
[17958] That also sequence like
[17959] First rigpa self face not-know through of self on other as confused delusion and
[17960] Appear object genitive essence nature not-have as not-know genitive delusion and
[17961] Condition from confusion scarecrow man as confused like delusion and
[17962] Rigpa essence on self not-have although form on self as delusion self genitive house says like delusion and
[17963] Path like artificial and
[17964] Antidote poison as become and free not give genitive delusion and
[17965] Nature through of light-clear genitive meaning not-know through of always samsara in delusion
[17966] Second that from arisen genitive mind genitive division
[17967] Self-shine from
[17968] Mind genitive division this like
[17969] Mind genitive division this like
[17970] Various gather water-like mind and
[17971] Clean-unclean not-have pig-like mind and
[17972] Brave timid great tiger-like mind and
[17973] Light feather-like mind and

[17978] Expand branch-like mind and
[17979] Stop difficult garuda-like mind and
[17980] Planet-tether not-have madman-like mind and eleven are says
[17981] Those also sequence like object and latencies various gathered through of water and
[17982] Accept-reject on deluded through of pig and
[17983] Anger and pride coarse through of tiger and
[17984] Object many on enter from focus one on not-decide superimposition and
[17985] Move on obstacle nonexistent wind and
[17986] Object desire through of intoxicate mire and
[17987] One from many conceptions spread fire and
[17988] Object accept desire bird and
[17989] Knowledge power expand through of meaning examine branch and
[17990] Object through of Awareness grasp that power into gone actor and
[17991] Not-diverge object knowledge direction not-give waver mad like mind
[17992] These all also object and condition through of virtuous non-virtuous unspecified mind three gather
[17993] Mind from intellect arise
[17994] All search intellect etc six
[17995] Third that from arise affliction distinction on three
[17996] Six root afflictions
[17997] Sixteen proximate afflictions
[17998] Subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions
[17999] First is sun-moon union from
[18000] Afflictions is six
[18001] Non-Awareness thus called basis delusion-conception part grasp
[18002] Delusion is Wisdom part from delusion
[18003] Anger is produce sequence from delusion
[18004] Pride is view part from delusion
[18005] Desire is appearance part from delusion
[18006] Jealousy is nonrealized part from delusion thus
[18007] That-also sequence like object subject delusion-conception part delusion and
[18008] Wisdom Awareness from reverse just not-know and
[18009] Object on hate part-possess and
[18010] I-am pride and
[18011] Object desire and
[18012] Meaning nonrealized through of other on anger
[18013] Second sixteen proximate afflictions
[18014] Self-arisen from
[18015] Sixteen what say
[18016] Non-awareness and
[18017] Mind and
[18018] Intellect and
[18019] Grasp and
[18020] Conception and
[18021] Not-know and
[18022] Not-see and
[18023] Not-realize and
[18024] Not-understand and
[18025] Self that impure and
[18026] I as grasp and
[18027] Other on jealousy do and
[18028] Desire and
[18029] Attachment and
[18030] Pride and
[18031] Spread and sixteen thus
[18032] These all also sequence like
[18033] That alone not-know delusion through of all affliction make and
[18034] Object on mind grasp and
[18035] Subject on grasp intellect and
[18036] Both on self as grasp and
[18037] All conception and
[18038] Meaning non-Awareness and
[18039] Nature aim not-see and
[18040] Word meaning nonrealized and
[18041] General-specific not-understand and
[18042] Delusion know after promise meaning before wrong form and
[18043] Object I as grasp and
[18044] Other excellence on not-happy and
[18045] Object take and
[18046] Object on special desire and
[18047] Slightly puff pride and
[18048] Object on spread anger
[18049] Third subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions on three
[18050] Twenty-five
[18051] Fifty-one
[18052] Thousand eight ten four
[18053] First is root non-Awareness pervader exist through of separately not-counted
[18054] Pervaded five-poisons on five distinguish through of twenty-five
[18055] Self-arisen from
[18056] Delusion on five
[18057] Very-dull delusion and
[18058] Not-know delusion and
[18059] Not-see delusion and

[18077] Brave brave great tiger like pride and
[18078] I-am think vulture like pride and
[18079] Unequal equal elephant like pride and five
[18080] Jealousy also five
[18081] Subtle jealousy and
[18082] I from arise jealousy and
[18083] Very-harsh jealousy and
[18084] Coarse jealousy and
[18085] View jealousy and five
[18086] That is afflictions twenty-five thus
[18087] Second fifty-one is that like twenty-five on object grasp afflictions twenty-five
[18088] Subject grasp afflictions twenty-five fifty
[18089] Root non-Awareness and root one arise
[18090] Third thousand eight ten four
[18091] Desire from become twenty-one thousand
[18092] Anger from become twenty-one thousand
[18093] Delusion from become twenty-one thousand
[18094] Part equal from become twenty-one thousand
[18095] Sum thousand eight and four
[18096] Afflictions eighty-four thousand also clear limitless distinguish if measure nonexistent mind not-comprehend
[18097] That-also arise from
[18098] That from mind not-comprehend speech not-utter
[18099] Count impossible arise thus
[18100] These all also mind and
[18101] Intellect and
[18102] Recollection and
[18103] Latency and
[18104] Doubt through of produce and all from arise and affliction influence through of imprint through of samsara affliction do action-possess
[18105] Sun-moon union from
[18106] These etc afflictions is thought all follow hold mind and
[18107] Recollection all follow hold intellect and
[18108] Interval connect latency and
[18109] Doubt all basis become conception and
[18110] Object and thing grasp part etc measure nonexistent thus
[18111] That like karma and afflictions all three-realm mind mental-factors on depend through of
[18112] That also consciousness group eight
[18113] Basis-all consciousness object not-think appear cause become consciousness conception-nonexistent clear and
[18114] That from spread door five knowledge from
[18115] Eye consciousness form grasp conception-nonexistent
[18116] Ear consciousness sound grasp conception-nonexistent
[18117] Nose consciousness smell grasp conception-nonexistent
[18118] Tongue consciousness taste grasp realize-nonexistent
[18119] Body consciousness touch grasp conception-nonexistent
[18120] That from grasp-holder intellect-consciousness two
[18121] Object first general grasp intellect-consciousness and
[18122] After particular grasp affliction-intellect
[18123] Grasped and grasper
[18124] Intellect-consciousness this two on
[18125] Virtuous non-virtuous unspecified three exist and
[18126] Conception-possess conception-nonexistent each suitable exist
[18127] Door five and basis-all consciousness conception-nonexistent
[18128] Thus three-realm mind and mental-factors fifty-one all abandon object superimposition only
[18129] Two-truths from
[18130] Mind and mental-factors three-realm
[18131] Superimposition form-possess conception
[18132] Thus
[18133] These abandon object
[18134] Non-Awareness nature is reason
[18135] Here mind path make Buddha desire great-text madhyamaka etc tradition through of also
[18136] Mind and mind-itself two distinguish through of mind group eight or seven or six nature abandon object gather through of
