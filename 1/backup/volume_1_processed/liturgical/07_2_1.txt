[11340] Gate form two exist.
[11341] That base spontaneous-presence called.
[11342] Base not-certain called.
[11343] Base various arise called also.
[11344] That below reverse ground exist.
[11345] That below base appearance great called exist.
[11346] That below enjoyment-body appearance exist thus spoke.
[11347] Here that meaning elaborate explain if,
[11348] Beginning expanse youth vase body inside essence body-as abide.
[11349] Nature speech-as abide.
[11350] Compassion mind-as abide.
[11351] That-also life-wind limb four possession wisdom wind five essence awareness abide resonance outside appear from.
[11352] Youth vase body limitless not-separate spontaneous-presence resonance from light five appearance flame each arise and together.
[11353] Compassion awareness resonance form investigate knowledge arise that also.
[11354] Self-face not-know just part from awareness depend ignorance called abide.
[11355] That word base not-change although base appear arise change change similar become is.
