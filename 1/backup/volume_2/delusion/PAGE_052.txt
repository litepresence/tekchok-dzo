[VIEW COLLAPSE] [MIND AS CONSCIOUSNESS]

MISREADING:
Mind (sems) and consciousness (rnam shes) are equivalent terms for ordinary awareness.

WHY IT ARISES:
English "mind" covers both. Lack of distinction.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Missing the crucial distinction between dualistic mind and non-dual rigpa.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Rigpa reduced to "being conscious" or "mindful."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VIEW COLLAPSE] and [PRACTICE ERROR].
