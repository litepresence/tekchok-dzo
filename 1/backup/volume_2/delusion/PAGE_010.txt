[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WIND AS PHYSIOLOGY]

MISREADING:
The five root winds and branch winds are actual physiological processes or breath patterns.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Wind" (rlung) translated as "air" or "breath" suggests physiology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reduction of subtle body to anatomical respiratory system.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pranayama-style techniques substituted for subtle body practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR].
