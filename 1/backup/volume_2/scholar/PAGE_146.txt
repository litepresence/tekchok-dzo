[STRUCTURE]
This page continues the citation-based structure with extensive quotations from major Nyingma tantras: *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arising Awareness), *Nor bu 'phrul bkod* (Magical Display of Jewels), and *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs* (Lion's Perfected Power). The structure alternates between verse citations (*zhes pa*) and the connecting tissue of Longchenpa's commentary. The *Rig pa rang shar* verses establish the impossibility of view, meditation, and conduct (*lta sgom spyod med*), then paradoxically enjoin the reader to "hold in mind the excellent teaching" (*legs bstan yid la zung*). This dialectical structure - negating then affirming - is characteristic of Dzogchen's "beyond yes and no" (*yin min las 'das*). The verses from *Nor bu 'phrul bkod* present a five-line revelation formula: reality emerges from no-thing, appears as object without object, is known by wisdom-without-dharmas, and remains without object in non-recollection.

[PHILOLOGY]
Key terms: *rtsal sgrugs* (power display), *smon pa* (aspiration), *byar med* (nothing to do), *lhun rdzogs* (spontaneously complete), *ye yengs* (primordially non-distracted). The particle *kyang* (also/even) appears in concessive function: *'on kyang legs bstan yid la zung* (nevertheless, hold the excellent teaching in mind). The term *yang dag* (authentic) modifies *rig pa* (awareness), distinguishing authentic awareness (*yang dag rig pa*) from mind (*sems*). The construction *gla yod* (how could there be?) appears repeatedly: *bya dang byed pa gla yod* (how could there be action and agent?). The compound *sgeg pa'i* (*sgyu 'phrul*) indicates the magical display/illusion nature of phenomena. The term *'ub* (swirl/unite) in *thig le gcig tu 'ub* describes the coalescence of all phenomena into a single sphere.

[CONTEXT]
The *Rig pa rang shar* is one of the Seventeen Tantras (*rgyud bcu bdun*) of the Upadesa (Men Ngag De) category, attributed to the eighth-century transmission to Vimalamitra. The *Nor bu 'phrul bkod* and *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs* are also among these seventeen. The phrase *rdzogs chen a ti yo ga* (Great Perfection Atiyoga) explicitly identifies the vehicle. The negation of *bsgom pa* (meditation) while affirming a natural state that is "neither meditated nor not meditated" (*bsgoms dang ma bsgoms*) reflects the *advaya* (non-dual) logic applied to practice. The critique of *sbyin pa dang tshul khrims bzod pa* (generosity, discipline, patience) - the first three perfections (*pha rol tu phyin pa*) - demonstrates Dzogchen's transcendence of the six perfections (*sad paramita*).

[CONCEPT]
The concept of *snying po* (essence/heart) as *chos sku* (dharmakāya) pervading all indicates the immanence of enlightenment. The threefold classification of kāyas - *chos sku* (dharmakāya) through essence (*snying po yin pas*), *longs sku* (sambhogakāya) through clarity (*gsal bar snang bas*), and *sprul sku* (nirmāṇakāya) through mother-child meeting (*ma bu 'phrad pas*) - presents the "resultant" view of Dzogchen: the kāyas are not achieved but recognized as spontaneously present. The term *yang dag* (authentic) applied to *rig pa* creates a technical distinction between ordinary mind (*sems*) and pure awareness (*rig pa*), a hallmark of the *sems sde* tradition. The phrase *bsam dang bral ba'i rig pa* (awareness free from thought) establishes the non-conceptual nature of recognition. The "excellence" (*mchog*) of buddhas' intention (*dgongs pa*) refers to the highest teaching of Atiyoga, which is "beyond one and two" (*gcig dang gnyis las 'das*).
