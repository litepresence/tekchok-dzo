[10900] [STRUCTURE] # RIM_KHANG: Fourth Section - Kaya (sku)
**Analysis:** Major transition to fourth topic: the three kayas. Marked by "bzhi pa sku la" (fourth, on kayas). Maintains the fivefold analytical framework established in previous sections.

[10906] [PHILOLOGY] Kaya Essence Definition
**Analysis:** "rtag par gnas pa'i rang bzhin mya ngan las 'das pa'i chos rnams kyi rten du gnas pa'o" — essence defined as the support for all nirvana dharmas, possessing the nature of permanent abiding. The term "rtag par gnas pa" (permanent abiding) requires careful analysis: in Dzogchen, this indicates unconditioned stability (gnas lugs) rather than eternalist permanence.

[10908] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology: Dri med zang thal rang rdzogs chen po
**Analysis:** Definition as "stainless transparent-penetrate self-complete great" — dri med (stainless) negates afflictive obscurations, zang thal (transparent-penetrate) indicates unimpeded manifestation, rang rdzogs (self-complete) indicates spontaneous perfection without effort, chen po (great) indicates universality.

[10910-10912] [STRUCTURE] Three Kaya Division
**Analysis:** Standard triad: chos sku (dharmakaya), longs sku (sambhogakaya), sprul sku (nirmanakaya). This division appears across all Mahayana schools but receives distinct interpretation in Dzogchen.

[10913-10918] [CONTEXT] Dzogchen Distinction: Path Appearance vs. Result
**Analysis:** Critical doxographical distinction: common vehicles consider three kayas as fruition ('bras bur 'dod), while Great Perfection considers them as path appearances (lam gyi snang bar 'dod). This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on recognition during the path of what is ultimately the case.

[10915-10918] [CONCEPT] Dharmakaya as Self-Appearance
**Analysis:** Chos sku rang snang yin — dharmakaya is one's own appearance. The reasoning: as long as dharmas exist, mind exists, therefore it is path; as long as kayas exist, body exists, therefore it is path appearance. Not ultimate (mthar thug ma yin). This subordinates kayas to the path process rather than treating them as ontological endpoints.

[10919-10921] [CONCEPT] Exhaustion Appearance
**Analysis:** "dngos gzhi tshad phebs rdzogs nas / zad pa'i snang ba ste / ka dag la thim du nye ba" — when the main practice reaches complete measure, exhaustion appearance (zad pa'i snang ba) approaches dissolution into primordial purity. This technical term indicates the stage where phenomena no longer appear as solid/obstructing.

[10922-10924] [CONCEPT] Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya as Path Appearance
**Analysis:** These kayas are also path appearances because while various appearing dharmas exist in stages, they are not the final extreme of markless equality (mtha' bral ris med mnyam pa'i mthar thug ma yin).

[10925-10928] [CONCEPT] Spontaneously Accomplished Appearance
**Analysis:** At the time of measure-reach, from spontaneously accomplished appearance arise kayas, fields (zhing), and teachers. This indicates the natural unfolding of display (rol pa) without fabrication.

[10930] [PHILOLOGY] Lam snang 'od gsal stong pa'i rang bzhin
**Analysis:** Path appearance characterized as clear-light empty nature. 'Od gsal (clear light) indicates luminous clarity, stong pa (empty) indicates lack of inherent existence, rang bzhin (nature) indicates this is not an attribute but the fundamental character.

[10931-10933] [CONCEPT] Result as Secret Jewel Interior
**Analysis:** Result described as ka dag rin po che gsang ba'i sbubs (primordially-pure jewel secret interior) where movement produces only the arising-basis of inner-clear three kayas. This spatial metaphor (sbubs = inside) suggests kayas are always present but obscured.

[10934-11025] [CONTEXT] Extended Relic Tantra Citation
**Analysis:** Lengthy citation from Sku gdung 'bar ba enumerating signs of three kaya familiarity: dharmakaya signs include body invisible to others while yogin plays freely; sambhogakaya signs include playing in five kayas and five wisdoms; nirmanakaya signs include speaking untaught dharma and displaying miraculous powers. The verses employ distinct dzogchen technical terminology.
