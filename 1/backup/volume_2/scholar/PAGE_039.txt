[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2017-2050]
Page 39 initiates the third major subdivision (gsum pa) of the conduct section: "the actual meaning of taking into experience" (nyams su blangs pa'i don dngos). This section marks a transition from preparatory conduct discussions to systematic presentation of actual practice modalities. The structural organization follows the canonical fourfold division found in the Nor bu 'phra bkod (lines 2022-2027): conduct-progressive-yogin (spyod pa rgyun gyi rnal 'byor), meditation-progressive-yogin (sgom pa rgyun gyi rnal 'byor), view-progressive-yogin (lta ba rgyun gyi rnal 'byor), and result-progressive-yogin ('bras bu rgyun gyi rnal 'byor). This tetradic structure reflects the standard soteriological progression in Tibetan Buddhist doxography.

The page is framed by two scriptural citations: the Man ngag rin po che'i 'khor lo (lines 1991-1994) at the opening and the Thal 'gyur (lines 2011-2016) toward the close. Between these citations, Longchenpa presents the "deer-like accomplishment" (ri dwags ltar bsgrub pa) as the second of two conduct modalities, following the "beggar-like accomplishment" (sprang po lta bu'i tshul) discussed in the preceding section.

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: sprang po] - Wylie: sprang po. Technical term referring to an ascetic beggar or wandering renunciant. In the context of Tibetan religious practice, this denotes the lifestyle of total dependence on alms, without fixed abode. The term carries connotations of authentic spiritual poverty rather than mere material deprivation. Philologically related to sprang (to beg, request alms).

[TERM: dben ba] - Wylie: dben ba. Etymologically derived from the verb dben pa (to be empty, secluded). In Buddhist technical vocabulary, denotes physical and mental solitude, the foundational condition for advanced meditation. The intensifier rab tu (greatly, thoroughly) compounds this to indicate total withdrawal from social and sensory engagement.

[TERM: yengs pa] - Wylie: yengs pa. Verb meaning to be distracted, dispersed, scattered. The negative construction ma yengs pa (undistracted) is a technical descriptor of proper meditative absorption. The causative form yengs su gzhug (to cause distraction) appears in instructions for cutting through dullness.

[TERM: rtse gcig] - Wylie: rtse gcig. Literally "one-pointed," "one peak." A central technical term in Tibetan meditation theory denoting single-pointed concentration. The phrase rtse gcig tu (in a one-pointed manner) modifies the verbal action of practice.

[PARTICLE ANALYSIS: -ng] - The instrumental particle -ng (often reduced to -s or -ng in orthography) appears frequently: dben ba'i (genitive), lta bu'i (genitive of comparison), spyod pa'i (genitive). These genitive constructions establish relationships between conduct types and their defining characteristics.

[TERM: gdams ngag] - Wylie: gdams ngag. Literally "sacred word of advice" or "personal instruction." In the Nyingma tradition, this refers to the pith oral teachings transmitted from guru to disciple, distinguished from general scriptural teachings (lung). The term appears with the honorific dam pa (sacred, sublime).

[TERM: rlung sems] - Wylie: rlung sems. Compound technical term combining prana/wind (rlung; Skt. prana) and mind (sems; Skt. citta). This denotes the subtle wind-mind continuum central to tantric physiology and Dzogchen practice. The compound functions as a singular concept in Tibetan Buddhist subtle body theory.

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Man ngag rin po che'i 'khor lo] - "From the Precious Wheel of Instructions: In the direction of abandoned enemy and friend, accomplish with beggar-like manner." This citation establishes the scriptural authority for the beggar conduct modality. The text is classified among the Nyingma tantric corpus, though specific textual identification requires further philological investigation.

[CITATION: Thal 'gyur] - "By possessing faith and separating from samsara's mind, one should offer worship to the guru and give. Having abandoned all samsara's connections, one should dwell alone, abandoning companions." This citation from the Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Result) tantra emphasizes the prerequisites for authentic practice: faith (dad ldan), separation from samsara ('khor ba'i yid bral ba), and solitude (grogs spangs gcig pur gnas pa).

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Nyingma-Sarma Distinction] - The page exhibits characteristic Nyingma organizational structures. The fourfold division of yogic practice (conduct, meditation, view, result) appears in Sarma presentations but is here integrated with specifically Nyingma terminological preferences. The emphasis on "own instructions" (rang gi gdams ngag) rather than received textual authority reflects the Nyingma emphasis on direct transmission lineages. The citation from the Nor bu 'phra bkod—a Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class—exemplifies this textual preference.

[CONCEPTUAL MAPPING: Deer Conduct Parameters] - The page establishes seven environmental parameters for deer-like retreat practice: (1) mountain-side rock with bird-shelter (ri ngogs brag gi bya skyibs can), (2) forest grove (nags khrod), (3) mountain peak (ri rtse), (4) snow slope (gangs 'dabs), (5) great empty valley (lung stong chen po), with the abandonment of three actions (bya ba gsum spangs). This typology of solitary locations reflects the standard Tibetan reclusive taxonomy found across retreat manuals (sgrub yig).

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Threefold Abandonment Mechanism] - The text presents a hierarchical causal chain: body relaxed (lus dal bas) → channels relaxed (rtsa dal bas) → wind-mind naturally relaxed (rlung sems rang bzhin gyis dal) → thought-force ceases (rnam rtog shugs kyis 'gag cing) → non-thought samadhi arises (mi rtog pa'i ting nge 'dzin rgyud la skye'o). This represents the Dzogchen presentation of progressive physiological and mental pacification, distinct from sutra-based gradualist approaches.

The fourfold causal progression operates through the following mechanism: (1) Physical relaxation of the body eliminates coarse physical tension; (2) Channel relaxation follows as the nadis (subtle channels) are no longer constricted by physical holding patterns; (3) Wind-mind relaxation occurs naturally (rang bzhin gyis) as the pranic currents flow unimpeded; (4) Thought-force naturally ceases without suppression. This results in the arising of non-conceptual samadhi (ting nge 'dzin; Skt. samadhi).

[ANALYSIS: Speech and Mind Relaxed] - Parallel structures govern speech and mind: (1) Speech relaxed (ngag dal bas) → inexpressible meaning arises in the mindstream (brjod du med pa'i don rgyud la skye); (2) Mind's memory discards emanation-gathering (sems kyi dran pas 'phro 'du spangs pas) → samadhi arises in its own manner (ting nge 'dzin rang lugs su skye ba). The "inexpressible meaning" (brjod du med pa'i don) corresponds to the ineffable nature of realization in Dzogchen discourse.

[LIST ANALYSIS: Progressive Yogin Categories] - The four categories of progressive yogin establish a comprehensive framework:
1. Spyod pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor - Conduct-progressive-yogin: emphasis on behavioral transformation
2. Sgom pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor - Meditation-progressive-yogin: emphasis on meditative stabilization
3. Lta ba la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor - View-progressive-yogin: emphasis on cognitive understanding
4. 'Bras bu la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor - Result-progressive-yogin: emphasis on actualization of fruition

Each category receives extensive treatment in subsequent pages, with the present page establishing the structural framework. The term rgyun du byed pa (doing continuously, progressive doing) indicates that these are not static attainments but ongoing processes of cultivation.
