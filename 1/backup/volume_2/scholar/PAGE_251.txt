[10810-10824] [STRUCTURE] # Section: Signs of Nirvana Preceding
**Analysis:** This section concludes the enumeration of signs indicating approach to complete nirvana. The structure follows the standard fivefold analytical framework (ngo bo, nges tshig, dbye ba, mtshan nyid, 'bras bu) established earlier. The passage lists thirteen distinct signs of spiritual maturation before transitioning to the third major topic: bindu (thig le) familiarity signs.

[10810-10824] [CONCEPT] Preliminary Liberation Signs
**Analysis:** The enumerated signs include: (1) disinterest in human association, (2) sensation of flying in space, (3) joy at the thought of appearances ceasing, (4) non-attachment to body and life, (5) non-engagement with phenomena, (6) clarity without dullness, (7) natural spaciousness of awareness, (8) comfort in association, (9) inability of afflictions to arise, (10) non-grasping of arisen afflictions, (11) non-attachment to beautiful forms, (12) non-aversion to ugly forms, (13) absence of hunger/thirst perceptions through samadhi power, (14) discord with others' minds. These function as diagnostic indicators of progression toward yongs su mya ngan las 'da' ba (complete nirvana).

[10825] [STRUCTURE] # RIM_KHANG: Third Section - Bindu Familiarity Signs
**Analysis:** Major structural transition marked by "gsum pa" (third). The text moves from wind (rlung) and channel (rtsa) signs to bindu (thig le) analysis, maintaining the sequential progression through subtle body components.

[10826-10830] [STRUCTURE] Fivefold Analytical Framework
**Analysis:** Standard scholastic structure: (1) ngo bo (essence), (2) nges tshig (definition), (3) dbye ba (division), (4) mtshan nyid (characteristic), (5) 'bras bu (result). This framework derives from Indian pramana traditions adapted in Tibetan doxography.

[10831-10832] [PHILOLOGY] Bindu Essence Analysis
**Analysis:** "tha dad ma yin zhing gcig tu gnas pas zla dang bral ba" — The essence is defined through double negation: non-different (tha dad ma yin) yet not establishing oneness either (gcig tu gnas pas), resulting in freedom from both extremes (zla dang bral ba, literally "free from moons" or dualistic reference points).

[10834-10835] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of Thig-le
**Analysis:** The term is analyzed as "thig mi 'gyur ba" (the undrawn/unwavering dot) plus "le gdal ba chen pos kun la khyab pa" (the great vastness that pervades all). This represents a Dzogchen-specific etymology distinct from tantric bindu concepts of essence-drops.

[10836-10839] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Bindu Division
**Analysis:** (1) lus gnas rtsa'i thig le (body-dwelling channel bindu), (2) rang bzhin lam gyi thig le (nature path bindu), (3) mthar phyin 'bras bu'i thig le (complete result bindu). This tripartite structure maps bindu across ground, path, and fruition.

[10840-10842] [CONCEPT] Conventional and Ultimate Bindus
**Analysis:** First level subdivides into: (a) kun rdzob rgyu'i thig le dkar dmar gnyis (two conventional causal bindus, white and red), and (b) don dam ye shes kyi thig le lnga (five ultimate wisdom bindus). This reflects the standard two-truth framework applied to subtle body anatomy.

[10843-10860] [CONTEXT] Thalgyur Citation on Wisdom Bindus
**Analysis:** Citation from Thalgyur (Thal 'gyur) tantra enumerates six wisdom bindus: (1) chos nyid thig le, (2) kun tu bzang po'i thig le, (3) dbyings thig le, (4) dbyings rnam dag thig le, (5) ye shes thig le, (6) ye shes chen po'i thig le. These correspond to progressively refined levels of realization.

[10844] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Term: Gzhi'i thig le bzang po
**Analysis:** "Ground bindu of excellence" refers to the non-moving (mi g.yo) presence within the general channels of the body, described as 'od kyi gong bur (a sphere/ball of light). The term "bzang po" (excellent/good) distinguishes this from lower bindu manifestations.

[10846-10849] [CONTEXT] Thalgyur Quotation on Body Locations
**Analysis:** Verse citation: "spyi dang tsit+ta rtsa yi nang / ma bcos dag pa'i chos nyid gnas" — identifies the crown (spyi) and heart (tsitta) channels as locations where unfabricated pure reality dwells. Tsitta (Skt. citta) represents the heart-center as mind-ground in subtle body physiology.
