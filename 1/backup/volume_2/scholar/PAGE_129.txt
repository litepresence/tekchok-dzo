[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes mastery over birth and manifestation [5540-5557] through simile [5540-5542], scriptural authority [5543-5545], and functional description [5546-5557]. The structure employs analogical reasoning (mirror, water-moon), causal markers (pas/bas), and enumerative logic (two powers). The passage concludes with teleological implications for benefitting beings.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5540-5542]: me long gi gzugs brnyan (mirror image): simile for delusory appearance—apparent yet insubstantial. chu'i zla ba (water-moon): classical metaphor for reflection-emptiness. ye shes sgyu ma'i sku (wisdom illusion-kāya): nirmāṇakāya as wisdom-display. zang thal (unimpeded): quality of realized manifestation. rdo rje'i sku (vajra-kāya): indestructible body of awakening.

Line [5543-5545]: slob dpon chen po bi ma la (great teacher Vimalamitra): Indian master who transmitted Dzogchen to Tibet. padma bzhin no: Padmasambhava, "Like Padma," indicating equivalent attainment.

Line [5546-5557]: skye ba la dbang ba (power over birth): capacity to emanate at will. 'jug pa la dbang ba (power over entry/engagement): capacity to interact with phenomena. sems can gsum stong (three thousand sentient beings): standard Buddhist numerical expression for vast numbers.

[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the soteriological result of Dzogchen practice—attainment equivalent to Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava. The "great transference body" ('pho ba chen mo'i sku) represents the highest Nyingma classification of realization, where the practitioner leaves the body as light without remainder. The two powers (over birth and engagement) correspond to nirmāṇakāya capacities—spontaneous emanation and skillful interaction. The emphasis on others' vision (gzhan gyi mig ma dag pa) explains why ordinary beings perceive the master's physical body while realized beings perceive the light-form.

[CONCEPT]
• Attainment equivalence:
  - Mirror-like delusory appearance
  - Water-moon wisdom-illusion body
  - Unimpeded vajra-kāya
  - Great transference embodiment

• Two powers (dbang):
  - Power over birth (skye ba): emanation at will
  - Power over engagement ('jug pa): interaction with phenomena
  - Simultaneous liberation of three thousand beings
  - Insects also dissolve into light

• Somatic markers:
  - Others' impure vision sees only physical body
  - Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava as exemplars
  - Self-power mastery (rang dbang 'byor ba)
  - Benefitting beings until samsara empties
