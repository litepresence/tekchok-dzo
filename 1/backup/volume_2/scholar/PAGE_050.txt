[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2480-2505]
Page 50 completes the asura dispute meditation section and presents additional mind-holding techniques, particularly the seven piths for separating body-mind grasping-attachment (lus sems 'dzin zhen dbral ba'i gnad bdun; lines 2495-2505). The structural organization:

1. Completion of asura dispute meditation with visionary results (lines 2480-2487)
2. Dietary recommendation for wind element (line 2488)
3. Navel RAM meditation (lines 2489-2494)
4. Seven piths for body-mind separation (lines 2495-2505)
   - Eyebrow-center bindu (lines 2497-2498)
   - Three channels wind-holding (lines 2499-2502)
   - Nose-tip white wind (line 2503)
   - Body light-fence visualization (line 2504)
   - Wind-mind space-throw (line 2505, incomplete)

The page marks the transition from the first seven characteristics (placing on ground) to the second set (body-mind separation), demonstrating the systematic progression of mind-holding training.

[CONTEXT]
[VISUAL PROGRESSION: Five-Phase Dissolution] - Lines 2481-2486 describe the visionary progression in asura dispute meditation:
1. Red blood turbid (dmar khrag khrug)
2. Yellow flickering (ser lhang lheng)
3. Green wavering (sngo gya gyur 'gyur)
4. Dissolving (thim thim)
5. Blue-clear (skya sang seng)

This sequence reflects the progressive dissolution of the elements and the emergence of pure awareness. The colors correspond to the five elements and five wisdoms in tantric cosmology.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Visionary Experience] - The page presents specific visionary results (snang ba) as markers of meditation progress. These are not fantasies or hallucinations but recognized stages in the systematic transformation of perception. The Nyingma tradition distinguishes such experiences from delusion ('khrul snang) through the presence of wisdom-recognition.

[TANTRIC PHYSIOLOGY: Channel-Wind System] - The page extensively employs the subtle body framework:
- Three channels (rtsa gsum)
- Four wheels ('khor lo bzhi)
- Wind-holding (rlung 'dzin)
- Wisdom wind (ye shes kyi rlung)

This reflects the integration of tantric physiology with Dzogchen meditation. The channels and winds are not ultimately real but serve as skillful means for stabilizing awareness.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Visionary Result Interpretation] - Lines 2486-2487 describe the culmination of asura meditation:
"See essence establish not what—self-cease outer appearance, arise experience self-liberate see appearance."

This indicates that the visionary colors are not the goal but the path. The goal is the recognition that outer appearances self-cease and that seeing and appearance self-liberate. The visions serve to break fixation on ordinary perception.

[ANALYSIS: Wind-Diet Correlation] - Line 2488 recommends "food suitable for wind" (rlung la shis pa'i kha zas) during this practice. This reflects the Tibetan medical principle that meditation affects and is affected by the three humors (wind, bile, phlegm). Wind-balancing foods support the energetic practices described.

[ANALYSIS: Navel RAM Meditation] - Lines 2489-2494 present a fire-element technique:
1. Visualize RAM at navel (lte bar yi ge raM)
2. Mix with long vocalized HUM and breath
3. Hold mind undistracted from that nature
4. Occasionally say short HUM
5. Result: Experience of thoughts purified into dharmata

This demonstrates the wrathful/fire method for purifying conceptual mind.

[ANALYSIS: Eyebrow-Center Bindu Technique] - Lines 2497-2498 present a higher technique:
1. Location: Eyebrow-center (smin mtshams)
2. Object: White-red mixed bindu, pea-locket size
3. Result: Wind experience arises

The eyebrow-center (ajna chakra) is associated with wisdom and vision. The mixed-color bindu represents the union of opposites.

[ANALYSIS: Three Channels Wind-Holding] - Lines 2499-2502 present an advanced pranic technique:
1. Three channels visualized as straight sticks in body center
2. Nose-holes imagined as skeleton channels
3. Hold wind and shoot like arrow → purifies illness, demons, sin, obscuration
4. Draw in like hook → enters central channel
5. Fill four wheels with wisdom wind
6. Hold mind → experience rigpa emptiness-clear

This reflects the classical completion stage (rdzogs rim) technique of tummo (gtum mo) or inner fire, here integrated into Dzogchen practice.

[ANALYSIS: Nose-Tip White Wind] - Line 2503 presents a simpler technique:
- White wind at nose-tip like an arrow
- Draw in and out to a distance of a mile
- Result: Thought-free clear experience

This is a calming (zhi gnas) technique to counter agitation.

[ANALYSIS: Five-Light Body Fence] - Line 2504 presents a protective visualization:
- Body as five-light fence (like rainbow)
- Without dissipating, scattering, blurring, breaking
- Hold mind undistracted
- Result: Pure light-clear experience

This creates a sacred space for meditation and protects against distraction.
