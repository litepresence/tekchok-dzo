[6416-6425] [STRUCTURE] Analysis of One and Many Applied to Mind
**Analysis:** This section applies the classical Buddhist logical dilemma of one (*gcig*) and many (*tha dad*) to the nature of mind (*sems*). The structure presents a trilemma: (1) if mind were singular, absurd consequences follow (all beings would die simultaneously); (2) if minds were multiple, shared perception would be impossible; (3) the body-mind analogy demonstrates the impossibility of consciousnesses uniting into a single stream. This follows the standard Madhyamaka deconstructive methodology applied to the specific case of mind.

[6416] [PHILOLOGY] *Ldog pa med na*
**Analysis:** The phrase *ldog pa med na* (if there is no reversal/return) introduces a conditional analysis. The term *ldog pa* denotes logical reversal or return to a previous state. Without such reversal, the aggregates (*phung po*) of beings would arise in absurd ways. The particle *na* marks the protasis (if-clause) of a conditional construction.

[6417-6423] [CONCEPT] Consequences of Plural Minds
**Analysis:** If minds were various/plural (*sna tshogs pa*):
- Self and other thought (*rang gzhan gyi rtog pa*) would arise simultaneously (*thang cig tu*)
- Mutual intermingling (*phan tshun 'chol ba*) would prevent distinct experiences
- Self-conquest (*rang rgyal ba*), not dying (*ma shi ba*), absence of suffering, and defeat of others would all be impossible
- The entire structure of samsaric experience would collapse

[6424-6428] [CONTEXT] Classical Buddhist Debate
**Analysis:** The *gal te tha dad pa yin na ni* construction engages with the classical Indian philosophical debate between:
- Ātmavādins (eternalists asserting a singular self)
- Buddhist *anātmavādins* (denying both singular and plural self)

The argument that one dying implies all die (*gcig shi bas kun shi ba*) references the standard critique of universal self theories found in Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*.

[6429-6431] [STRUCTURE] Search and Non-Finding
**Analysis:** Having exhausted logical analysis (*rgal bas brtags te btsal bas*), the text arrives at the quintessential realization: not finding anything (*gang yang ma rnyed pa*) constitutes the realization (*rtogs pa*) through wisdom-power (*shes rab kyi dbang pos*) of the meaning pure from the beginning in reality (*chos nyid ka nas dag pa'i don*).

[6430] [PHILOLOGY] *Chos nyid ka nas dag pa*
**Analysis:** The phrase *chos nyid ka nas dag pa* (pure from the beginning in dharmatā/reality) employs *ka nas* (from the primordial) to indicate timeless purity, not achieved through purification. The term *chos nyid* (dharmatā) denotes the ultimate nature of phenomena, distinct from conventional characterizations.

[6431-6439] [CONCEPT] The Causal Dilemma
**Analysis:** The text presents a trilemma regarding mind's causation:

1. **If mind has no cause** (*sems la rgyu med*):
   - Return/reversal (*ldog pa*) is impossible
   - Karma-accumulation (*las kyi bsags pa*) becomes endless without resolution

2. **If mind has cause** (*sems la rgyu yod na*):
   - Results (*'bras bu*) must follow
   - If result is samsara (*'khor ba*), impurity prevents liberation
   - If transcended (*'das pa*), samsara's arising becomes illogical

3. **If both** (*gnyis ka yin na*):
   - Samsara and nirvana would be different (*'khor 'das tha dad pa*)
   - Therefore mind would also become different
   - Memory and thought-streams could not unite into one family (*rigs gcig tu 'dus pa*)

The resolution: *rigs gcig tu 'du bas shes so* (known through gathering into one family) transcends the dilemma.

[6440-6453] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Citations from *Kun byed rgyal po*
**Analysis:** The citations from the All-Creating King (*Kun byed rgyal po*) establish the Dzogchen view:
- *Ma rig 'khrul 'khor 'di la zad med 'phel ba med* (This ignorance-illusion-wheel has no exhaustion, no increase)
- *Sems can khams kyi rang bzhin de yang ma mtha' med* (The nature of the realm of beings is also without end)

These establish the non-arising (*skye ba med pa*) and non-increase (*'phel ba med pa*) of mind, foundational to the self-liberation (*rang grol*) view.
