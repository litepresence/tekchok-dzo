[11412-11431] [CONCEPT] Detailed Emanation Mechanics
**Analysis:** The wrathful body liberation process continues:
- Luminosity essence essence dawns in spontaneous presence base-appearance (*lhun grub kyi gzhi snang shar ba*)
- Pauses for a moment (*dar cig sdod pas*)
- After twenty-one absorption days (*bsam gtan gyi zhag nyi shu rtsa gcig*)
- From impure self-appearance (samsara's six realms), through pure gate (*dag pa'i sgo*), Nirmanakaya emanates to tame beings
- Functions like illusion performing illusion's benefit (*sgyu mas sgyu ma'i don byed pa*)
- Self-appearance benefits self-appearance (*rang snang la rang snang gis don byed*)

[11417-11419] [CONCEPT] Prior Liberation Requirement
**Analysis:** After emitting emanation, prior liberation already accomplished. Without self-liberation (*rang ma grol*), self-benefit incomplete (*rang don ma rdzogs*), other-benefit circumstances (*gnas skabs*) cannot arise.

[11420-11421] [CONCEPT] Emanation Duration Variability
**Analysis:** Emanation duration compared to shooting star (*skar mda' rgyug pa*), longer or shorter, indefinite duration explained.

[11422-11425] [CONCEPT] Common Error on Buddha Activity
**Analysis:** Confusion (*'khrul nas*) regarding emanation capacity focuses attention on whether buddhas can benefit others after awakening. This is called "great fierce error" (*rnor ba rngams che*).

[11424-11425] [CONTEXT] Mahayana Rejection of Inactive Buddhas
**Analysis:** Buddhas not performing benefit neither desired (*mi 'dod*) nor possible (*mi srid*) in Mahayana.

[11426-11431] [CONCEPT] Emanation Absence in Complete Liberation
**Analysis:** Those liberated into transparent primordial purity without bardo spontaneous presence gate-opening lack emanation because:
- Impure taming-fields (*gdul zhing ma dag pa*) not visible at that time
- From spontaneous presence gate-appearance, impure appearances visible
- If emanation doesn't benefit there, samsara-appearance not dissolved
- Buddha-activity accomplished as self-appearance completion through emanation
- After benefiting, samsara empties, emanation reabsorbs into spontaneous presence eight gates, goes to primordial purity ground

[11432-11433] [CONCEPT] Non-Dual Kayas
**Analysis:** Primordial purity ground transcends visible/invisible distinction. Three kayas' appearance-basis only, no separate three kayas. From there, base-appearance other-benefit arises.

[11434-11435] [CONTEXT] Secret Vajra Pledge
**Analysis:** This place (*gnas 'di*) is the difficult supreme vajra pledge (*dka' ba'i mchog rdo rje'i chings*), great secret. If from now (*da phan chad*) one can speak without error, know it as this author's power.

[11436] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Relics Section
**Analysis:** Line 11436 initiates the second major section (*gnyis pa*): extensive explanation of relics (*gdung*), structured in three parts (*gsum ste*).

[11426] [PHILOLOGY] Negative Existential: *Med de*
**Analysis:** *Med de* (there is no) marks absence of emanation for those completely liberated.
