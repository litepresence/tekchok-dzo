[1108-1113] [CONCEPT] Multiple Teachings, Single Nature
**Analysis:** Though nirmanakaya teaches "individual individuals, mind, wisdom, kunzhi, showing kunzhi as Dharmakaya" (*re re ba dang / sems dang / ye shes dang / kun gzhi dang / kun gzhi chos skur ston pa*) in many ways (*du mar ston yang*), "the nature of Great Completion does not appear in all infinitely through the path for only some capable ones" (*rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po ni skal ba can 'ga' la dus rgya lam na snang ba las thams cad du ma yin te*).

This establishes the esoteric principle that Dzogchen is not universally taught but appears only to those with the appropriate capacity (*skal ba can*).

[1114-1127] [CONTEXT] Citation on Teaching Methods
**Analysis:** From *rang shar*, the Buddha's pedagogical flexibility:

**Correct Knowledge of Languages:** "Knowing all languages, showing that in whichever language" (*thams cad skad ni shes pa ste / gang gi skad la de ston pa*)

**Pedagogical Gates (*sgo*):**
- Words (*tshig gi sgo*)
- Dependent arising (*rten 'brel sgo*)
- Aspiration and application (*smon 'jug sgo*)
- Generation stage (*bskyed pa'i sgo*)
- Both generation and completion (*gnyis ka'i sgo*)
- Five enlightenments (*byang chub lnga*)
- Three samadhis (*ting 'dzin gsum*)
- Expanse and wisdom (*dbyings dang ye shes*)

The key principle (line 1126): "Great Completion meaning is without place of contradiction" (*rdzogs chen don ni 'gal sa min*)—all these methods are ultimately harmonious.

[1128-1141] [CONTEXT] Apparent Contradictions in Teaching
**Analysis:** The citation continues with apparent contradictions that are actually skillful means:

| Teaching A | Teaching B | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Rigpa as empty (*rig pa stong par ston*) | Absence-of-rigpa as empty (*rig med stong par ston*) | Different entry points |
| Rigpa-not as inert (*rig pa med bems por ston*) | Rigpa alone (*rig pa rkyang par ston*) | Refuting extremes |
| Kunzhi as Dharmakaya | Without virtue or non-virtue | Ethical vs. ultimate view |
| Possessing meditation | Without meditation | Gradual vs. instantaneous |

Lines 1137-1141 emphasize that the unsurpassable secret mantra meaning "was not spoken to some" (*'ga' las ma gsungs*) and "what was not spoken does not become spoken" (*ma gsungs gsung bar mi 'gyur*). This maintains the esoteric boundary—Dzogchen is not taught to those without capacity.

[1142-1148] [CONCEPT] Transformation of Lower Vehicles
**Analysis:** Even when spoken (*skabs su gsung bar gyur na yang*), within the teachings of "arhats, solitary realizers, and sutras"—within which "the name 'lower vehicle' does not exist" (*theg dman ming yang med*)—these become "proclaimers of the unsurpassable vehicle" (*bla med theg pa sgrogs par 'gyur*).

Therefore (*des na*), it is "hidden from others of inferior mind" (*blo dman gzhan la gsang*), and "that person possessing those [qualities] is considered the emanation-kaya of performing actions" (*de rnams ldan pa'i skyes bu de / bya ba byed pa'i sprul skur 'dod*).

[1149-1151] [CONTEXT] Rarity of Heart Essence Teachings
**Analysis:** "Although Great Completion may arise" (*rdzogs pa chen po byung srid na'ang*), from among the "secretmost cycle of instructions" (*yang gsang skor*) of mind-vastness and oral instructions, "this unsurpassable Heart Essence" (*snying tig bla med 'di*), "not arising from the existence of the infinitely long path" (*rgya lam srid pa las ma 'byung bas*), is a "very rare enumeration of Dharma" (*rab tu dkon pa'i chos kyi rnam grangs*).

This emphasizes that Dzogchen Heart Essence (*snying thig*) is distinct from and superior to other Dzogchen teachings that do arise through the long path.

[1152-1157] [CONTEXT] Citation from Uttaratantra
**Analysis:** Longchenpa quotes the *Uttaratantra* (*rgyud bla ma*), the classic treatise on Buddha-nature:

"Because arising is rare (*'byung ba dkon phyir*),
Because stainless (*dri med phyir*),
Because possessing power (*mthu ldan phyir*),
And because becoming the ornament of the world (*'jig rten gyi rgyan gyur phyir*)—
Therefore jewel itself (*rin chen nyid*)."

This compares Dzogchen teachings to a jewel (*nor bu* / *rin chen*) that should be "held as a precious treasure" (*gces spras su 'dzin*).

[1158-1159] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Examination Method
**Analysis:** "Fifth, the method of examining emanation-kaya" (*lnga pa sprul pa sku'i brtag thabs ni*)—preparing to present the criteria for recognizing nirmanakaya activity.
