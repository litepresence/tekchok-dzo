[STRUCTURE]
This page executes the threefold analysis of mind's source, location, and destination as introduced in the previous page. The structure follows a rigorous logical examination: (1) analysis of external appearances (*phyi sna tshogs yul du snang ba*) and internal aggregates (*nang phung po gzugs su snang ba*), (2) reduction to atomic insubstantiality (*rdul phran cha med*), (3) recognition that mind does not arise from these (*sems ma byung*), (4) analysis of the arising-agent (*byung mkhan*), (5) recognition of baseless, rootless awareness (*gzhis med rtsa bral*). The structure then applies this analysis to location (*gnas sa*) and destination ('gro sa), concluding with recognition of the three kāyas. The page culminates in a citation from the *Thal 'gyur* (Consequence/Prasaṅgika) tradition, demonstrating Nyingma's synthesis of Madhyamaka analytical method with Dzogchen's direct recognition.

[PHILOLOGY]
The term *shar* (dawn/arise) appears repeatedly as the operative verb for both external appearances and internal thoughts: *phyi ru shar na* (if it dawns externally), *nang du shar na* (if it dawns internally). The compound *tshal pa tshal par* (part by part/particle by particle) indicates analytical reduction. The term *rdul phran* (subtle atom) references the *paramāṇu* of Abhidharma and the consequent *anavasthā* (infinite regress) argument if atoms are divisible. The phrase *gzhis med rtsa bral* (baseless, without root) becomes the concluding formula for the collapse of dualistic perception. The term *sha ra ra 'o la la* is onomatopoeic for mind's chattering/fluctuating quality. The construction *...rang las rang...* (from itself to itself) appears in *khong rang las khong rang byung* (it arose from itself to itself), indicating self-arising without external cause. The term *sangs seng* (suddenly clear) or *sang sang* suggests instantaneous recognition.

[CONTEXT]
The analysis of *byung sa* (source) draws on Abhidharma and Madhyamaka methods of examining the origin of phenomena, here applied specifically to the mind. The reference to *rdul phran* (atoms) and their partlessness (*cha med*) engages with the historical Buddhist debate on the ultimate constituents of matter, resolved here through the recognition that mind does not arise from matter at all. The *Thal 'gyur* (Prasaṅgika) citation demonstrates Nyingma's acceptance of Candrakīrti's analytical tradition while going beyond it to direct recognition. The threefold analysis (*byung gnas 'gro gsum*) mirrors the *trikāla* (three times) analysis in Indian philosophy: where does the mind come from, where does it stay, where does it go? The phrase *sems sbyangs sems kyi gnas lugs shes* (purifying mind by knowing mind's natural condition) indicates that "purification" is not a process but a recognition.

[CONCEPT]
The concept of *gzhis med rtsa bral* (baseless, without root) is the Dzogchen resolution of the Madhyamaka *niḥsvābhāva* (without inherent existence): not merely that phenomena lack inherent existence, but that awareness itself has no ground or foundation (*gzhis med*) - it is "groundless" in the sense of being spontaneously self-arisen. The analysis of *byung sa* (source) and *byung mkhan* (ariser) resolves the subject-object dichotomy: neither does mind arise from external objects (*phyi yul*) nor from internal form (*nang gzugs*), nor does it arise from itself as a substantial entity. The three kāyas are recognized as spontaneously present: *chos sku spros bral chen po* (dharmakāya free from elaborations), *longs sku rang gsal chen po* (sambhogakāya self-clear), *sprul sku rang grol rang shar* (nirmāṇakāya self-liberated, self-arisen). The phrase *ma bsgoms chu bo rgyun gyi bsam gtan* (non-meditated samādhi of river-flow) describes the natural continuity of awareness without deliberate meditation.
