[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2123-2168]
Page 42 completes the twenty-one conducts section with the remaining animal metaphors (lines 2123-2145) and transitions to the detailed exposition of vajra song and dance (rdo rje'i glu gar; lines 2147-2168). The structural organization follows the threefold division established in the previous page:

1. Time of song dance (glu gar gyi dus; line 2148)
2. Song dance actual (glu gar dngos; line 2149)
3. Song dance benefit (glu gar gyi phan yon; line 2150)

The twenty-one conducts conclude with eleven additional animal metaphors, bringing the total to twenty-two enumerated forms (lines 2146 note: "though twenty-two enumeration exist, although two deer like conduct gather as one—explain as twenty-one"). This numerical adjustment reflects the organic development of the conduct system rather than rigid categorical imposition.

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: ru shan] - Wylie: ru shan. Technical term meaning "boundary," "dividing line," or "demarcation." In the phrase 'khor 'das ru shan (samsara-nirvana boundary), this denotes the conceptual and experiential divide between cyclic existence and liberation. The boundary-divide conduct ('khor 'das ru shan 'byed pa'i spyod pa) represents the advanced capacity to distinguish without dualistic fixation.

[TERM: tshogs] - Wylie: tshogs. In tantric context, denotes the "accumulation" of merit and wisdom (bsod nams dang ye shes kyi tshogs). In the context of song dance timing (line 2153), this refers to the preliminary practice phase of tantric ritual.

[TERM: dbang bskur] - Wylie: dbang bskur. "Empowerment" or "initiation." The standard Tibetan translation for Sanskrit abhisheka. The term appears in the context of five pure times (rnam lnga dag pa'i tshe) for vajra song practice.

[TERM: dkyil 'khor] - Wylie: dkyil 'khor. "Mandala" or "circle." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit mandala. In the context of song dance, this refers to the creation and visualization of the mandala as a context for practice.

[TERM: ting nge 'dzin] - Wylie: ting nge 'dzin. "Samadhi" or "meditative absorption." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit samadhi. The compound indicates deep meditative stabilization, distinct from ordinary concentration.

[TERM: rnal 'byor] - Wylie: rnal 'byor. "Yogin" or "practitioner." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit yogin. In Nyingma contexts, this specifically denotes tantric practitioners who have received empowerment and engage in the two stages (bskyed rim, rdzogs rim) or Dzogchen practices.

[TERM: skal ldan] - Wylie: skal ldan. "Fortune-possessor" or "suitable vessel." Technical term indicating a practitioner who possesses the karmic fortune (skal ba) to encounter and successfully practice the dharma. The term combines skal (portion, fortune) with ldan (possessing).

14. Dred mo (bear) - not spread samsara seed
15. Bram ze (brahmin) - abandon other enjoy food
16. Dpa' mo (heroine/dakini) - divide samsara-nirvana boundary
17. Chu yig (water-letter) - place memory support self-place
18. Nam mkha'i mdung skor (sky-dagger) - completely use phenomena
19. Bar snang rlung 'dra (mid-air wind-like) - abandon grasp hold thought
20. Bya khyung (garuda) - cut abyss waves
21. Ri bo (mountain) - above use unchanging self-pure

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Nyi zla kha sbyor - Song Dance Section] - Lines 2156-2168 cite the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra on the vajra song practice. The passage describes five specific occasions for vajra song:
1. Time of samsara-nirvana boundary-divide conduct
2. Accumulation (tshogs)
3. Empowerment (dbang bskur)
4. Mandala accomplishment time
5. Samadhi upward-spread time

These five pure times (rnam lnga dag pa'i tshe) represent formal ritual contexts where vajra song serves as an auxiliary practice. The instruction emphasizes secrecy: "ordinary not-see, secret do" (tha mal pas ma mthong bar gsangs te bya ba).

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Conduct Numerology] - The explanation in line 2146 clarifies the enumeration: though twenty-two forms are mentioned (rnam grangs nyer gnyis yod kyang), two deer-like conducts are gathered as one (ri dwags lta bu'i spyod pa gnyis gcig tu phyogs sdebs pas), resulting in the standard enumeration of twenty-one (nyer gcig tu bshad do). This reflects the organic, non-rigid nature of tantric categorical systems.

[RITUAL CONTEXT: Vajra Song] - The vajra song (rdo rje'i glu) represents a distinctive Nyingma practice form combining vocalization (glu) with movement (gar). Unlike ordinary singing, vajra song is non-conceptual (mi rtog) and serves as a support for meditative stabilization (bsam gtan gnas pa'i grogs). The practice is specifically associated with charnel-ground (dur khrod) retreat contexts.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Tortoise Conduct] - The rgya mo (tortoise) conduct (lines 2125-2126) exemplifies contentment: "decide desire content time" ('dod pa'i chog shes dus tshod bcad). The tortoise withdraws into its shell, representing the practitioner's withdrawal from external desire-objects while remaining content. This reflects the paramita of contentment (chog shes) integrated into tantric conduct.

[ANALYSIS: Bear Conduct] - The dred mo (bear) conduct (lines 2127-2128) addresses karmic propagation: "not spread samsara seed" ('khor ba'i sa bon spel mi bya). The bear hibernates, representing cessation of activity that produces karmic seeds (sa bon; Skt. bija). This conduct emphasizes non-action as the cessation of samsaric perpetuation.

[ANALYSIS: Brahmin Conduct] - The bram ze (brahmin) conduct (lines 2129-2130) addresses sustenance ethics: "abandon other enjoy food" (gzhan gyi longs spyod zas rnams spang). This represents the abandonment of food and enjoyments obtained through exploiting others, reflecting the ethical dimension of tantric conduct.

[ANALYSIS: Heroine/Dakini Conduct] - The dpa' mo (heroine) conduct (lines 2131-2132) addresses the samsara-nirvana relation: "divide samsara-nirvana boundary" ('khor 'das rnams kyi ru shan dbye). The feminine dpa' mo (Skt. virya, dakini) represents dynamic wisdom that cuts through the apparent dichotomy between cyclic existence and liberation.

[ANALYSIS: Water-Letter Conduct] - The chu yig (water-letter) conduct (lines 2133-2134) addresses memory support: "place memory support self-place" (dran pa'i rten nyid rang sar gzhag). The water-letter represents fluid, non-grasping mindfulness that requires no external support but rests in its own place (rang sar gzhag).

[ANALYSIS: Sky-Dagger Conduct] - The nam mkha'i mdung skor (sky-dagger) conduct (lines 2135-2136) represents complete utilization: "completely use phenomena" (dngos po rnams la zang thal spyad). The phurba (mdung skor) ritual dagger represents the ability to penetrate and completely engage with all phenomena without obstruction.

[ANALYSIS: Thunder Conduct] - The thog chen (great thunder) conduct (lines 2143-2144) represents unidirectional application: "use appearance outward not-turn" (snang ba phyir mi ldog par spyad). Thunder travels in one direction without returning, representing the irreversible application of wisdom toward liberation without regression.

[ANALYSIS: Vajra Song Pedagogy] - The song dance section (lines 2147-2168) presents vajra song as a method that:
1. Precedes all conduct (spyod pa kun gyi sngon du 'gro)
2. Supports non-conceptual meditation (mi rtog bsam gtan gnas pa'i grogs)
3. Captures dakini minds (mkha' 'gro ma yi yid rnams 'phrog)
4. Turns six-type samsara clinging (rigs drug 'khor ba'i zhen pa bzlog)

The practice requires reliance on the non-conceptual mind (mi rtog rgyud la bsten dus su) and should be taken as the occasion ('di nyid skabs su blang bar bya). This framing integrates vocal/musical practice into the comprehensive conduct system.
