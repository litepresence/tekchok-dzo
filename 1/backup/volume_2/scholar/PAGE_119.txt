[STRUCTURE] This page transitions from the four-visions framework to concrete visionary phenomena and their interpretation. The passage employs analogical reasoning (like.../lta bu) and causal analysis (las/byung). Structural elements include quotative markers (zhes bya ste) defining technical terms, and comparative analysis distinguishing ordinary vs. awakened perception.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5126-5130]: nang snang (inner vision): subjective meditative appearance distinguished from outer objects. phyir snang (outer vision): objective manifestation. 'phel zhing tshad la phebs (increasing to measure arriving): technical description of vision maturation.

Line [5131-5135]: rgyan drug (six ornaments): decorative visionary phenomena—sgra (sound), 'od (light), thig le (spheres), sku (bodies), yid 'ong (attractive), grol (liberation). chos sku'i rgyan (dharmakāya ornaments): ultimate nature appearances.

Line [5136-5140]: zung 'jug (union): integration of appearance-emptiness, bliss-emptiness, awareness-emptiness. gzhi (ground/basis): primordial state preceding samsara-nirvana bifurcation. gdangs (resonance/radiance): self-display of awareness without external cause.

[CONTEXT] The six ornaments (rgyan drug) derive from tantric classification systems, particularly the Guhyagarbha and Māyājāla cycles, adapted for Dzogchen presentation. The distinction between inner and outer vision (nang phyir snang) reflects epistemological debates in Tibetan Buddhism about the status of meditative experiences—are they purely subjective (nang) or do they possess objective ontological status (phyir)? Longchenpa's position affirms the non-dual nature of these appearances as self-display (rang snang) of awareness, neither purely inner nor outer.

[CONCEPT]
• Six ornaments phenomenology:
  - Sounds: dharmatā resonance (chos nyid kyi sgra)
  - Lights: five-colored radiance (lnga ldan gyi 'od)
  - Spheres (thig le): concentrated luminosity
  - Bodies (sku): manifestation of three kāyas
  - Attractive (yid 'ong): naturally pleasing without attachment
  - Liberation (grol): self-liberated upon arising

• Threefold union (zung 'jug):
  - Appearance-emptiness union (snang stong zung 'jug)
  - Bliss-emptiness union (bde stong zung 'jug)
  - Awareness-emptiness union (rig stong zung 'jug)

• Vision maturation stages:
  - Increasing ('phel): quantitative multiplication
  - Arriving at measure (tshad phebs): qualitative fullness
  - Self-liberation (rang grol): automatic purification
