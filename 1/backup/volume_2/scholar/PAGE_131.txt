[STRUCTURE] This page continues the synthesis of four visions as path stages with scriptural citation [5600-5615], structural markers defining diligence (brtson 'grus) [5616-5645], and concluding exhortation. The passage employs enumeration (seven branches), quotative authentication, and teleological reasoning.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5600-5615]: Verse citation on 'gro ba'i don (beings' welfare), pha rol phyin (pāramitā), dngos grub (siddhis), tshogs gnyis (two accumulations), lam 'di (this path), snying po (essence), gces pa (precious), zad pa'i lus (exhausted body), dngos med (non-substantial), gsang sngags (secret mantra), rdzogs rim (completion stage), blo yi yul (mind's object), sbyor drug (six applications), yon tan (qualities), dgos 'dod (needs and desires).

Line [5616-5620]: brtson 'grus (diligence/vīrya): defined as dam pa'i chos la dga' ba (joy in sublime dharma) + nyams su len pa (putting into practice).

Line [5621-5645]: Seven branches (yan lag bdun): snyan ngag (poetry/kāvya), brda' gsang (secret symbols/sandhabhāṣa), grub mtha' (philosophical systems), bsdus don (condensed meaning), mchan 'grel (annotations), le'u 'grel (chapter commentary), gal mdo (critical analysis)—the complete scholarly apparatus for textual study.

[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the practical requirements for Dzogchen realization—diligent practice supported by comprehensive study. The seven branches represent the complete Tibetan monastic curriculum applied to Dzogchen texts. The emphasis on "this life's body" (tshe 'di'i lus) reflects Nyingma assertions about attainability of full awakening in a single lifetime, distinct from gradualist paths requiring countless eons. The reference to six applications (sbyor drug) of Guhyasamāja completion stage demonstrates Dzogchen's integration of classical tantric methodology while transcending it.
