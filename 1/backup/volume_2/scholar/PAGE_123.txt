[STRUCTURE] This page presents the secret awareness measure (gsang ba rig pa'i tshad) through citation [5316-5332] and definition [5333-5350]. The structure employs verse quotation followed by prose exegesis, with concluding synthesis using des na (therefore). The passage connects physiological transformation with cognitive perfection.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5316-5332]: Citation on body transformation: rdul dang bral (free from atoms), bar snang 'od kyi skar khung (sky light apertures), lcags kyu'i dbyibs (hook shapes), zang thal dri med 'od kyi lus (unimpeded stainless light body), A yi mtshan ma (A mark/sign), thor tshugs rlung gis 'deg (crown wind elevates), zhi sku (peaceful kāya), thod pa'i gzhal yas (skull palace), he ru ka mngon 'byung (Heruka manifest).

Line [5333-5340]: gsang ba (secret): hidden dimension beyond outer/inner. phra rags 'gyu ba'i sems (subtle-gross moving mind): range of mind from coarse to refined. kun gzhi rnam shes (all-base consciousness): ālayavijñāna as reference point. mngon shes (clairvoyance): five or six superknowledges.

Line [5341-5350]: spyan chags pa (attachment): cognitive obstacle even at advanced stages. rang gis shes pa zin (self-knowing grasped): subtle duality. snang ba lhug par shar (vision freely dawn): unobstructed manifestation. chos kyi sprin (cloud of dharmas): tenth bhūmi metaphor.

[CONTEXT] This passage operates at the intersection of tantric subtle body completion and Dzogchen awareness perfection. The citation describes rainbow body ('ja' lus) formation through light-transformation. The distinction between outer, inner, and secret measures reflects the trikāya structure—nirmāṇakāya (body), sambhogakāya (perception), dharmakāya (awareness). The critique of mngon shes without spyan chags liberation reflects Nyingma concerns about siddhis without realization.

[CONCEPT]
• Secret awareness measure dimensions:
  - Subtle-gross mind purification (phra rags 'gyu ba'i sems dag)
  - Beyond all-base consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes tsam)
  - Without attachment to awareness qualities (rig pa'i yon tan spyan chags med)

• Clairvoyance classification:
  - Six superknowledges (mngon shes drug tshan)
  - Near/far knowledge (ring lkog)
  - Instantaneous knowledge (skad cig shes)

• Transformation markers:
  - Stainless light body (dri med 'od kyi lus)
  - Three kāyas as one entwined (sku gsum gcig 'dril)
  - Body exhausted to measure (lus zad tshad las grol)
