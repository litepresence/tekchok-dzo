[6625-6675] [STRUCTURE] Appearances as Self-Display
**Analysis:** This page presents appearances (*snang ba*) as spontaneous self-display (*rang shar rang snang*) within awareness. The structure emphasizes that virtue/non-virtue (*dge ba/mi dge ba*) are adventitious (*glo bur*), their essence baseless and self-liberated (*gshis med rang sangs*). Multiple citations establish that all phenomena arise from awareness's display.

[6625-6627] [PHILOLOGY] Key Terminology
**Analysis:** 
- *Glo bur ba* (adventitious): appearances arise temporarily, not inherent to awareness
- *Gshis med rang sangs* (baseless, self-liberated): without essence yet spontaneously free
- *Rig pa'i ye gdangs cha la yod* (exists as the dynamic display of awareness): appearances are awareness's expressive energy

[6628-6631] [CONCEPT] Mirror of Mind
**Analysis:** The phrase *snang srid 'khor 'das kyi chos so cog rig pa'i ngang na med pa gsal snang gi snang ba chen po* (all phenomena of appearance-existence, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, as great clear appearance of non-existence in awareness's state) captures the Dzogchen view:
- Phenomena appear (*snang*) yet do not exist (*med*)
- They are clear (*gsal*) appearances
- Self-arisen (*rang shar*), self-display (*rang snang*)

[6632-6636] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Non-Seeing
**Analysis:** The "threefold non-seeing" (*ma mthong gsum*):
1. *Rig pas 'khrul snang 'khor ba ma mthong* - Awareness does not see confused appearance as saṃsāra
2. *Dag snang 'das pa ma mthong* - Does not see pure appearance as transcended
3. *'Khor 'das kyis rig pa ma mthong* - Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa do not see awareness

This indicates complete nonduality where neither awareness nor appearances are established as separate.
