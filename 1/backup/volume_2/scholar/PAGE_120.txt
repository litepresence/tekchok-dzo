[STRUCTURE] This page presents the four visions through detailed phenomenological description, employing structural markers "first...second...third...fourth" (dang po...gnyis pa...gsum pa...bzhi pa). The passage alternates between technical definitions and metaphorical illustrations, concluding with synthesis statements using "therefore" (des na).

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5141-5145]: chos nyid snang ba (dharmatā vision): vision of nature-of-things, first of four. snang la zhen med (vision without attachment): non-grasping perception. rang byung (self-arisen): arising without cause/conditions.

Line [5146-5150]: nyams gong 'phel (increasing experience): second vision characterized by multiplication. yid la byed (mental engagement): conceptual involvement to be transcended. bskyed rim (generation stage): reference to tantric preliminary practices.

Line [5151-5155]: rig pa tshad phebs (awareness arriving at measure): third vision of complete recognition. sgyu ma lta bu (like illusion): standard simile for appearance-emptiness. rtsis med (without calculation): non-conceptual spontaneity.

Line [5156-5160]: chos zad pa (exhaustion of phenomena): fourth vision where phenomena dissolve into ground. spros pa (elaboration): conceptual proliferation. sgrub pa (accomplishment): achieved without effort.

[CONTEXT] This page contains the classical presentation of the four visions (snang ba bzhi) that defines Tögal practice. The schema derives from the Thod rgal section of the Snying thig ya bzhi and Longchenpa's own Mthong ba don ldan commentary. The progression mirrors the classical Buddhist stages of insight but reconceived within Dzogchen's spontaneous framework: (1) recognition of nature (chos nyid), (2) maturation through repetition (nyams gong 'phel), (3) complete measurement (tshad phebs), (4) exhaustion into ground (chos zad). Each vision builds on the previous while representing distinct qualitative shifts in perception.

[CONCEPT]
• Four visions progressive schema:
  1. Dharmatā vision: Initial recognition, like recognizing one's face in mirror
  2. Increasing experience: Visions multiply spontaneously, like stars filling sky
  3. Awareness at full measure: Complete non-dual recognition, like illusion
  4. Exhaustion of phenomena: Liberation into ground, like dreams dissolving

• Characteristics of each:
  - First: Natural (rang byung), uncontrived (ma bcos)
  - Second: Increasing ('phel), expansive (rgyas pa)
  - Third: Measure complete (tshad phebs), illusion-like (sgyu ma lta bu)
  - Fourth: Elaboration ceased (spros pa zad), spontaneously complete (lhun grub)

• Teleological structure:
  - Progressive yet non-gradual (rim pa yin yang cig car)
  - Each stage contains previous yet transcends it
  - Culmination in "beyond practice" (sgom pa las 'das)
