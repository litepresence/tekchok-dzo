[STRUCTURE] This page transitions from Tögal practice analysis to the relationship between Dzogchen and classical bodhisattva bhūmis. The structure presents a structural marker [5976-5980], followed by detailed enumeration of ten bhūmis [5981-6020], concluding with synthesis statements. The passage employs comparative reasoning and teleological analysis.

[CONTEXT] This passage addresses the crucial question of Dzogchen's relationship to classical Mahāyāna soteriology. Rather than rejecting the ten bhūmis, Longchenpa integrates them as descriptive categories for stages of recognition. Each bhūmi corresponds to specific Dzogchen phenomenology: first bhūmi to initial truth-seeing, second to recognizing self-display, and so forth. This integration demonstrates Nyingma's synthetic approach—affirming the validity of gradual paths while asserting Dzogchen's superiority as direct recognition.

[CONCEPT]
• Ten bhūmi-Dzogchen correspondence:
  1. Perfect Joy: truth-seeing, joy arises
  2. Stainless: recognizing self-display
  3. Luminous: familiarization with light
  4. Radiant: wisdom vision seen
  5. Difficult: afflictions purified
  6. Manifest: body from light ashes appears
  7. Gone Far: afflictions distanced
  8. Immovable: stable in nature
  9. Perfect Intellect: qualities complete
  10. Cloud of Dharma: all dharmas like cloud

• Integration strategy:
  - Not rejecting gradual stages
  - Reinterpreting through recognition
  - Bhūmis as descriptive not prescriptive
  - All stages present in single recognition
