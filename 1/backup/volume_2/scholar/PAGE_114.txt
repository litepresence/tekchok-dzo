[4984-5011] [STRUCTURE] Essence, Definition, and Purpose
**Analysis:** The section presents the classical *mtshan nyid* (definition) structure for dharmata direct perception:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*) at 4984-4991: Unborn direct, object-pure vision
2. Definition (*nges tshig*) at 4992-4997: Seeing three bodies' vision, arriving at field-realm
3. Purpose (*dgos pa*) at 4998-5002: Liberation without obstacle
4. Pith (*gnad*) at 5003-5011: Scripture citations for practice

This mirrors the *laksana* (characteristic), *vyakti* (definition), and *prayojana* (purpose) structure from Indian philosophical texts.

[4984-5011] [PHILOLOGY] Scriptural Citations and Technical Definitions
**Analysis:** Multiple scriptural sources are cited:
- *Yi ge med pa* (Letterless): Unborn direct, object-pure (4984-4987)
- *Sgyu 'phrul* (Maya): Jewel, desire, glory—all buddhas' direct (4988-4991)
- *Rin po che rnam par brtsegs pa'i rgyud* (Ratnakuta): Direct = seeing; three = three bodies (4993-4997)
- *Thal 'gyur*: Rope without movement is pith (5003-5006)
- *Yi ge med pa*: Eye pressed, eye-corner dhatu arises (5007-5011)

The definition at 4992 uses *mtshan nyid* (definition) in the technical sense: seeing three bodies' vision (*sku gsum gyi snang ba mthong ba*). The term *rgyang zhags* (rope/snare) at 5004 appears in Dzogchen as a metaphor for immovable awareness.

[4984-5037] [CONTEXT] Multiple Tantric Sources
**Analysis:** The section integrates sources from various classes:
- *Atiyoga* (*Yi ge med pa*, *Thal 'gyur*): Highest yoga
- *Yoga tantra* (*Sgyu 'phrul drva ba*): Illusion Net
- *Sutra* (*Rin po che brtsegs pa*): Ratnakuta collection

This reflects Longchenpa's encyclopedic approach, integrating sources across the *nine vehicles* (*theg pa dgu*). The voice alternates between citation and commentary, with *zhes so* marking quotations and *zhes bya* marking definitional statements.

[5012-5037] [CONCEPT] Vision Characteristics and Practice Methods
**Analysis:** The section presents the characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) of dharmata direct perception vision:

1. From *Thal 'gyur* (5013-5017):
   - Exits certainly from sense-power gate
   - Clear in cloudless sky

2. From other sources (5018-5033):
   - Channels and delusion-mandala: Five wisdoms seen as bubbles
   - *Rang shar*: Five wisdoms, light body, clear in hanging-cord
   - *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs*: Self-vision rigpa entity abides as wisdom hanging-cord
   - *Nor bu 'phra bkod*: Perfect buddha rigpa lu gu rgyud body fully clear

The practice method at 5034-5037 presents a graduated approach:
1. First: Short sessions, many repetitions
2. Second: Extend sessions, prolong duration
3. Third: Day-night without distinction, placed in dhatu-fence, unmoving

This mirrors the standard *bsgom rim* (meditation stages) but adapted to Dzogchen's direct approach.
