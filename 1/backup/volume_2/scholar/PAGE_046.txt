[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2311-2334]
Page 46 presents the detailed exposition of the seven primary conducts from the twenty-one, forming the core practical instruction of the section. The structural organization follows a coordinated progression where each conduct serves as a "companion" (grogs su) to the previous, creating an integrated practice system. The seven conducts are:

1. Peacock conduct (thi bya tshang du 'jug pa) - lines 2315-2316
2. Deer conduct (ri dwags lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2317-2318
3. Mute conduct (lkugs pa lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2319-2320
4. Madman conduct (smyon pa lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2321-2322
5. Dog-pig conduct (khyi phag lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2323-2324
6. Lion conduct (seng ge lta bu'i spyod pa) - lines 2325-2327
7. Appearance-power-transform conduct (snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa) - lines 2328-2333

The section concludes with the transition to the instruction section (de'i man ngag; line 2334), setting up the next page's content.

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: sgro 'dogs] - Wylie: sgro 'dogs. "Superimposition" or "conceptual overlay." Technical epistemological term from Madhyamika philosophy denoting the projection of inherent existence onto phenomena. The phrase sgro 'dogs bcad pa (cutting superimposition) indicates the wisdom that eliminates conceptual proliferation.

[TERM: 'dzal 'dzol] - Wylie: 'dzal 'dzol. "Confusion" or "mix-up." Term indicating the disorder that arises when superimpositions have not been thoroughly cut. The negated form 'dzal 'dzol med par indicates the clarity that follows proper preparation.

[TERM: the tshom med pa] - Wylie: the tshom med pa. "Without doubt." Technical term indicating the decisive confidence that arises from having cut through superimpositions. Doubt (the tshom) is one of the five obscurations (sgrib pa lnga) obstructing meditation.

[TERM: gnong gis mi mi rgyu ba] - Wylie: gnong gis mi mi rgyu ba. "People not going out of fear." The phrase gnong gis indicates the fear (gnong; perhaps from gnod pa, harm) that prevents ordinary people from entering solitary retreat locations.

[TERM: rma'i gnong] - Wylie: rma'i gnong. "Hunter's fear." Technical phrase describing the deer's fear of hunters, serving as the metaphorical basis for the practitioner's fear of samsara.

[TERM: yan gar ba] - Wylie: yan gar ba. "Hiding alone" or "solitary concealment." Term describing the deer's behavior and, by extension, the hermit practitioner's retreat.

[TERM: dran pa rengs pa] - Wylie: dran pa rengs pa. "Memory becomes rigid" or "mindfulness freezes." Technical phrase describing the state when conceptual memory (dran pa) ceases its normal associative function. This "freezing" is a precursor to non-conceptual wisdom.

[TERM: gza' gtad] - Wylie: gza' gtad. "Planetary attachment" or "astrological fixation." Technical term indicating conventional constraints, including astrological concerns about planetary influences. The phrase gza' gtad med pa indicates transcendence of such conventional limitations.

[TERM: shugs las 'byung] - Wylie: shugs las 'byung. "Arising from force/power." Technical phrase indicating spontaneous emergence from the force of practice, distinct from deliberate fabrication.

[TERM: 'dem kha med pa] - Wylie: 'dem kha med pa. "Without picking and choosing." Technical phrase describing the dog-pig conduct's transcendence of preferences. The term 'dem kha (choice, selection) indicates the ordinary discriminatory mind.

[TERM: zil gyis mi non] - Wylie: zil gyis mi non. "Not overwhelmed by splendor/power." Technical term indicating the mastery state where others cannot dominate or intimidate the practitioner. The term zil (splendor, power) indicates the imposing presence of advanced realization.

[TERM: phar gnon pa] - Wylie: phar gnon pa. "Suppressing the far shore" or "overpowering the other side." Technical phrase indicating the lion-like capacity to overcome all opposition.

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Nyi zla kha sbyor - Three Wisdoms] - Lines 2311-2314 cite the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra on the three wisdoms for cutting superimpositions:
1. Thos pa'i shes rab kyis phyi'i sgro 'dogs bcad pa - hearing wisdom cuts outer superimpositions
2. Bsam pa'i shes rab kyis nang gi sgro 'dogs bcad pa - contemplation wisdom cuts inner superimpositions  
3. Sgom pa'i shes rab kyis gsang ba'i sgro 'dogs bcad pa - meditation wisdom cuts secret superimpositions

This tripartite structure reflects the progressive deepening of insight: external phenomena, internal thoughts, and most subtle conceptual patterns.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Conduct as Sequential System] - The page presents the seven conducts not as alternatives but as a coordinated progression. Each conduct "serves as a companion" (grogs su) to the previous, indicating that they support and enhance each other. This integrated approach distinguishes Nyingma conduct theory from elective practice menus.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Progressive Conduct Logic] - The seven conducts follow a sophisticated developmental logic:

1. PEACOCK (2315-2316): Superimposition-cutting preparation. The peacock eats poison (afflictions) after the three wisdoms have cut conceptual overlays. This is the foundation—transformation requires preparation.

2. DEER (2317-2318): Solitude-seeking. Having tasted the poison of samsara through the peacock's transformation, the practitioner seeks isolation like a deer fleeing hunters. Fear of samsara (gnong) motivates retreat.

3. MUTE (2319-2320): Speech cessation. In solitude, external communication ceases. This silences the verbal dimension of conceptual proliferation.

4. MADMAN (2321-2322): Conceptual freeze. When speech ceases, memory/mindfulness "freezes" (rengs pa)—the associative mind stops. This produces spontaneous (shugs las 'byung) conduct beyond social convention.

5. DOG-PIG (2323-2324): Beyond pure/impure. With conceptual mind frozen, the practitioner transcends the pure/impure dichotomy, accepting whatever sustenance appears without preference ('dem kha med pa).

6. LION (2325-2327): Fearless mastery. Having transcended conventional categories, the practitioner becomes fearless like a lion, overpowering (gnon pa) all opposition. This produces the siddhis: mind-control, revivification, miracles, dharmata-blazing, element-control.

7. APPEARANCE-POWER-TRANSFORM (2328-2333): Integrated capacity. The lion's mastery manifests as the capacity to transform appearances at will—this is the conduct that gives its name to the entire category.

[ANALYSIS: The Six Siddhis] - Lines 2329-2333 enumerate six attainments from lion conduct:
1. Able to overpower others' minds (gzhan gyi mi dbang bsgyur nus)
2. Able to kill and restore (bsad pa slar gso nus pa)
3. Accomplishing miracles (rdzu 'phrul grub)
4. Dharmata experience blazing (chos nyid kyi nyams 'bar ba)
5. Free from fear in all directions (phyogs yan re dogs dang bral)
6. Able to transform four elements ('byung bzhi la dbang bsgyur nus pa)

These correspond to the classical siddhis of tantric tradition, here presented as natural byproducts of conduct completion rather than goals to be achieved.

[ANALYSIS: The Appearance-Power-Transform Mechanism] - The final section (lines 2334) introduces the instruction method (man ngag): seeing whatever appears as mind-itself directly placed (gang snang snang gi thog tu sems nyid cer bzhag tu bltas pas). This represents the essence of Dzogchen practice—direct recognition that appearances are mind, mind is empty, and emptiness is spontaneous presence.
