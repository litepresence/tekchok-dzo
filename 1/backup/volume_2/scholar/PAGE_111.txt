[4891-4905] [STRUCTURE] Vision Completion and Soteriological Results
**Analysis:** The section presents the completion dynamics of the four visions and their soteriological results. The structure:
1. Third vision dynamics (4891-4894): Awareness arriving at measure
2. Fourth vision (4894-4896): Dharmata exhausting
3. Integration with three bodies (4897-4902): Mapping visions to kayas
4. Unique fruition formulation (4902-4905): Vehicle-king's intent

The term *thug pa* (arriving at/concluding) at 4899 indicates the terminus of the path, distinguishing Dzogchen's "path of exhaustion" (*zad lam*) from gradualist paths.

[4891-4905] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Functions in Vision Dynamics
**Analysis:** The particle *yang* in *de dag kyang* (4897) marks continuation from previous discussion. The locative *la* in *lam du byas pa* (4899) indicates instrumental usage: made into path. The term *thim pa* (dissolution) at 4894, 4900 appears with both transitive and intransitive senses—vision dissolves into base, potency dissolves into awareness mode. The phrase *theg pa gzhan nas* (from other vehicles) at 4903 uses ablative *nas* to mark exclusion: this essence not even heard of (*ming yang mi grag*) in other vehicles.

[4891-4905] [CONTEXT] Kaya-Vision Correspondences
**Analysis:** The text establishes the classical Nyingma correspondence:
| Vision | Kaya | Characteristic |
|--------|------|----------------|
| First two (*dang po gnyis*) | Nirmanakaya | Preliminary manifestation |
| Measure-arriving (*tshad phebs*) | Sambhogakaya | Stable clarity |
| Exhausting (*zad pa*) | Dharmakaya | Complete liberation |

This differs from Sarma presentations where the four visions typically map to four kayas (including *svabhavikakaya*). The voice at 4902-4905 is Longchenpa's authoritative summary: this is the *snying po* (essence) and *theg pa rgyal po* (vehicle-king's) intent, using royal metaphor for Dzogchen's supremacy.

[4906-4931] [CONCEPT] Direct Perception: Conventional and Ultimate
**Analysis:** The section transitions to the second subtopic (*gnys pa*): individual natures. The analysis of *mngon sum* (direct perception) at 4914-4931 presents four types:
1. **Sense-power direct** (*dbang po'i mngon sum*): Forms, etc., five objects
2. **Mind direct** (*yid kyi mngon sum*): Object near enjoyment, certain cause
3. **Self-awareness direct** (*rang rig pa'i mngon sum*): Within pleasure, pain, etc.
4. **Yogin's direct** (*rnal 'byor gyi mngon sum*): Particular correct awareness, grasp-hold separate

The Yogin's direct is distinguished from the others by its object (*yul*): entry into *de kho na nyid* (thusness/thatness). This reflects the *yogipratyaksa* (yogi perception) concept from *Pramana* (epistemology) traditions, particularly Dharmakirti's *Pramanavarttika*.

The citation from *Rnam 'grel* (Pramanavarttika) at 4920-4925 establishes epistemic authority for direct perception, with Longchenpa's commentary adapting pramana theory to Dzogchen realization.
