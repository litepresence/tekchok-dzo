[584-589] [CONCEPT] Qualities of Dharmakaya
**Analysis:** This section describes the dharmakaya (*chos sku*) as:
- Beyond alteration and transformation (*bcos shing bsgyur ba*)
- Not able to be grasped or designated (*ngos gzung zhing brdar gdags mi btub pa*)
- Like earth and sky (*sa gzhi dang nam mkha' lta bu*)
- Clear and subtle, like sparks behind five lights (*gsal bal cha phra bas sla lnga'i rgyab kyi me stag bzhin*)
- The heart essence of expanse (*dbyings kyi snying po*)
- Abiding as awareness itself, holding the basis of all

[584] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology: *Bcos shing bsgyur ba*
**Analysis:** *Bcos* (alter/fabricate) + *bsgyur* (transform/change) are standard terms for conditioned modification. Their negation indicates the unconditioned nature of dharmakaya.

[590-599] [CONTEXT] Dharmadhatu as Abiding Place
**Analysis:** The citation describes the dharmakaya's palace (*pho brang*):
- The dharmadhatu (*chos kyi dbyings*), empty and all-pervading like space
- When abiding in the precious interior (*rin po che'i sbubs*), it is called:
  - Pure original tone of dharmata (*chos nyid dag pa'i ye gdangs*)
  - House possessing light of awareness (*rig pa 'od gyi khang pa can*)
  - Abiding in light display (*'od kyi snang ba la bzhugs*)
- This is the primordial common basis (*thog ma'i spyi gzhi*) called "expanse of awareness" (*rig pa'i dbyings*)
- The meaning of establishing connection with five winds

[596] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology: *Ye gdangs*
**Analysis:** *Ye* (primordial) + *gdangs* (tone/resonance/potential) refers to the primordial sound-potential or luminous resonance of dharmata—the "original tone" of reality.

[598] [CONCEPT] Primordial Common Basis
**Analysis:** *Thog ma'i spyi gzhi* (primordial common basis) is a fundamental Dzogchen concept indicating the ground that is common to all beings before the split into samsara and nirvana. It is called "expanse of awareness" (*rig pa'i dbyings*).

[600-612] [CONTEXT] Five Fires from Rang Shar
**Analysis:** The Self-Arisen tantra enumerates five fires:

1. **Pervading all outer and inner** (*phyi nang kun gyi khyab byed kyi me*)
2. **Illuminating all outer and inner** (*phyi nang kun gsal gyi me*)
3. **Equalizing all outer and inner** (*phyi nang kun tu mnyam pa'i me*)
4. **Concept in outer and inner actions** (*phyi nang gi bya ba rtog pa'i me*)
5. **Accomplishing actions of outer and inner** (*phyi nang gi bya ba grub pa'i me*)

**Locations:**
- Lungs (*glo ba*)
- Eyes and five limbs (making six locations)
- Flesh gaps (*sha lpags bar*)
- Two soles of feet
- Two palms of hands
- These produce warmth (*drod skyed*)

[613-626] [CONTEXT] Five Earths from Rang Shar
**Analysis:** Five types of earth element:

1. **All-illuminating earth** (*kun tu snang ba'i sa*)
2. **Unchanging vajra earth** (*mi 'gyur ba rdo rje'i sa*)
3. **Precious earth from which all arise** (*thams cad 'byung ba rin po che'i sa*)
4. **All-pervading earth showing appearances** (*snang ba ston pa kun tu mtha' yas pa'i sa*)
5. **Earth of perfected accomplishment** (*sgrub pa mthar phyin pa'i sa*)

**Associations:** These abide together (*lhan cig*) with:
- Awareness (*rig pa*)
- Lamp (*sgron pa*)
- Thigle (*thig le*)
- Wisdom (*ye shes*)
- Discriminating awareness (*shes rab*)

[617] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology: *Rdo rje'i sa*
**Analysis:** *Rdo rje* (vajra/diamond) indicates the indestructible, unchanging nature of this earth aspect. "Vajra earth" suggests the adamantine ground of being.

[627-635] [CONTEXT] Five Waters from Rang Shar
**Analysis:** Five types of water element:

1. **Unchanging water** (*'gyur ba med pa'i chu*)
2. **Peaceful, clear, pure water** (*zhi ba gsal dag gi chu*)
3. **Water of extensively arising qualities** (*yon tan 'byung ba rgyas pa'i chu*)
4. **Water without attachment** (*chags pa med pa'i chu*)
5. **Water of completion without grasping** (*'dzin med rdzogs pa'i chu*)

These are associated with all channels (*rtsa thams cad*), indicating the fluid, pervasive nature of water in the subtle body.

[632] [CONCEPT] Non-Attachment and Non-Grasping
**Analysis:** The distinction between:
- *Chags pa med pa* (without attachment) - freedom from emotional clinging
- *'Dzin med* (without grasping) - freedom from cognitive fixation

These represent progressive refinements of freedom, from affective to cognitive liberation.
