[RISK: FRUITION REIFICATION]

<The *Sgron ma 'bar ba* (Blazing Lamp) citation—"Expanse makes awareness's own field (*dbyings kyis rig pa'i rang yul byed*); vajra is hanging cord (*rdo rje nyid ni lu gu rgyud*); this placed within (*'di nyid nang du gzhag par bya*)"—establishes definitive Dzogchen view through tantric imagery. The phrase "hanging cord" (*lu gu rgyud*) refers to the self-coiled nature of awareness, never requiring unknotting. The statement "this placed within" (*'di nyid nang du gzhag par bya*) indicates that recognition is not production of something new but recognition of what has always been present within. The term "fruition" (*'bras bu*) in Dzogchen does not mean future attainment but recognition of ever-present ground (*gzhi*). This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of fruition reification: treating "fruition" as something to attain rather than recognition of what has always been present. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "vajra" (*rdo rje*) refers to awareness's indestructible nature, not an external implement. The "hanging cord" (*lu gu rgyud*) is metaphorical description of awareness's self-arisen and self-coiled nature, not an actual cord to untangle.>

[RISK: SUBTLE BODY REIFICATION]

<The detailed explanation of fruition (*'bras bu*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The explanation: when outer expanse-appearance (*phyi'i dbyings snang la*) eye does not move in its own time (*mig mi 'gul ba'i rang dus na*), inner rigpa abides in ground (*nang du rig pa gzhi la gnas pas*), radiance self-dissolves (*gdangs rang thim la*) returning (*'khor nas*), separated from spleen-wind's horse (*glo ba'i rlung gi rta dang bral bas*), wisdom's sky (*ye shes kyi nam mkha'*) dissolves into expanse's sky (*dbyings kyi nam mkha' la thim nas*), liberating as equal-limitless without category (*ngo mnyam ris med du grol bas*). This describes not attainment but recognition of ever-present nature. The phrase "spleen-wind's horse" (*glo ba'i rlung gi rta*) refers to subtle energy riding wind—the apparent movement of subtle energy when not recognized. The phrase "separated from" (*dang bral bas*) indicates that when recognition occurs, apparent separation between energy and awareness ceases. The conclusion: primordial purity's rigpa (*ka dag gi rig pa*) not moving from expanse (*dbyings la ma g.yos par*), heart-center naturally (*snying ga na*) clear-light intention (*'od gsal ba'i dgongs pa*) self-naturally abides (*rang bzhin gyis gnas te*). The yogi (*rnal 'byor pa*) is called (*zhes bya bas*) "dharmata primordial clear-light captured" (*chos nyid gdod ma'i 'od gsal zin pa*), samsara name-empty (*'khor ba ming med du*), three realms corpse cut (*khams gsum gdar sha chod pa yin te*). The phrase "primordial clear-light captured" (*gdod ma'i 'od gsal zin pa*) does not mean capturing something but recognizing what has always been present. The phrase "samsara name-empty" (*'khor ba ming med du*) indicates that samsara was never truly existent as name-entity. The phrase "three realms corpse cut" (*khams gsum gdar sha chod pa*) refers to recognition that cyclic existence was never truly real—the "corpse" is the death of apparent reality through recognition. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of subtle body reification: treating "spleen-wind's horse" as anatomical entity rather than metaphorical description of energy-movement. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all descriptions point to recognition: awareness has never moved from expanse, heart-center is naturally clear-light, and samsara was name-empty from the beginning.>

[RISK: LIBERATION PROGRESSIVE MISUNDERSTANDING]

<The *Thal 'Gyur* citation on direct-appearance gnad (*chos nyid mngon sum gnad*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation: "Therefore (*des ni*) dharmata direct-appearance gnad (*chos nyid mngon sum gnad*)—seeing merely knows (*mthong ba tsam gyis shes pa dang*), knowing realizes (*de shes pa yis rtogs pa dang*), realizing merely liberates (*rtogs pa tsam gyis grol bar 'gyur*), liberation is not separate (*grol zhes bkrol ba ma yin te*)—sky dissolves into sky (*nam mkha' dag ni nam mkha' la*), dissolves (*thim nas*), self-nature unobservable (*rang bzhin dmigs med pas*), without category (*ris med cha shas yod ma yin*), without parts (*mngon sum rnyed pa'i skal ldan pa*), three realms samsara name-empty (*khams gsum 'khor ba ming med pas*), three realms corpse cut (*srid gsum gdar sha chod pa'o*)." This is definitive pointing: liberation is not result of practice (*grol bkrol ba ma yin*) but recognition of nature's already-liberated state. The phrase "seeing merely knows" (*mthong ba tsam gyis shes pa*) indicates that recognition is not intellectual understanding (*rtogs pa*) but immediate knowing (*shes pa*). The phrase "knowing realizes" (*de shes pa yis rtogs pa*) indicates that recognition (*shes pa*) naturally realizes without effort. The phrase "realizing merely liberates" (*rtogs pa tsam gyis grol bar 'gyur*) establishes that liberation is not produced by realization but recognized as ever-present. The phrase "sky dissolves into sky" (*nam mkha' dag ni nam mkha' la thim nas*) indicates that recognition is not transformation but revelation of what has always been. The phrase "self-nature unobservable" (*rang bzhin dmigs med pas*) refers to awareness's self-nature being beyond objectification, not that it cannot be recognized. The phrase "without category without parts" (*ris med cha shas yod ma yin, mngon sum rnyed pa'i skal ldan pa*) indicates that recognition transcends all classification, not that it is featureless. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of liberation progressive misunderstanding: treating "liberation" as progressive process rather than recognition of ever-present state. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "three realms corpse cut" (*khams gsum gdar sha chod pa*) refers to recognition that cyclic existence was never truly real, not destruction of something real.>

[RISK: EXPERIENCE INCREASE ACCUMULATION]

<The experience-increasing appearance (*nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba*) section presents experiential dimension of recognition. The brief teaching (*mdor bstan pa ni*): expanse-rigpa upwardly increasingly purified (*dbyings rig la gong nas gong du sbyangs pas*), outer expanse-appearance (*phyir dbyings snang du*) rigpa-snake-knot non-dually abides (*rig pa lu gu rgyud dbyer med du gnas pa bzhin*); inner primordial purity empty-expanse (*nang du ka dag gi stong dbyings la*) self-radiance (*rang gdangs kyi*) rigpa-expanse (*rig dbyings*) non-dually abides (*gnyis med du gnas pas*), clear-light mother-child meet (*'od gsal ma bu 'dres te*), various appearance-experiences increase (*snang nyams sna tshogs su 'phel ba ni*). This describes the natural unfoldment of recognition when dualistic confusion dissolves: not accumulation of experience (*nyams 'phel*) in conventional sense but revealing of what was always present. The phrase "upwardly increasingly purified" (*gong nas gong du sbyangs pas*) indicates progressive clearing of obscurations, not progressive building of recognition. The phrase "rigpa-snake-knot non-dually abides" (*rig pa lu gu rgyud dbyer med du gnas pa*) refers to awareness's self-coiled nature never separate from expanse, not an actual knot. The phrase "clear-light mother-child meet" (*'od gsal ma bu 'dres te*) refers to primordial wisdom (mother) and recognition wisdom (child) meeting—not two things meeting but recognition of their inseparability. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of experience increase accumulation: treating "experience increase" (*nyams 'phel*) as accumulation of special experiences rather than natural unfoldment of recognition. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "increase" (*'phel*) refers to clearing of obscurations revealing what was always present, not building something new.>

[RISK: EXPERIENCE QUALIFICATION]

<The *Thal 'Gyur* citation on experience-appearance increase (*nyams kyi snang ba gong 'phel ni*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation: "Experience-appearance increase upward is (*nyams kyi snang ba gong 'phel ni*)—wisdom color outwardly arising (*ye shes kha dog phyir byung nas*), upright-standing and spokes arise (*gyen 'greng ba dang rtsibs shar dang*), various thigle as body (*thig le sna tshogs sku nyid du*), clear to appearing object's field (*rags par snang ba'i yul la gsal*), it is said (*ces so*)." The phrase "wisdom color outwardly arising" (*ye shes kha dog phyir byung nas*) indicates that wisdom-display naturally manifests outwardly when recognition occurs. The phrase "upright-standing and spokes arise" (*gyen 'greng ba dang rtsibs shar dang*) refers to the natural manifestation of five-color energy as awareness-display. The phrase "various thigle as body" (*thig le sna tshogs sku nyid du*) indicates that subtle energy-drops manifest as body without separation. The phrase "clear to appearing object's field" (*rags par snang ba'i yul la gsal*) indicates that recognition clears apparent objects by recognizing them as awareness-display. The extensive explanation (*rgyas par bshad pa ni*): experience-increase's experience two (*nyams gong 'phel ces pa'i nyams la gnyis te*), knowing's experience (*shes pa'i nyams dang*) and appearance's experience (*snang ba'i nyams so*). This is not dualistic separation but pedagogical presentation of recognition's experiential aspects: knowing (*shes pa*) refers to awareness's self-knowing nature; appearance (*snang ba*) refers to awareness's self-display. The phrase "knowing's experience and appearance's experience" indicates that recognition involves both self-knowing and self-displaying as experiential dimensions. The continuation: knowing's experience arises from reliance (*shes nyams la 'jig rten pa'i shes nyams*... [text continues]). This establishes that knowing-experience depends on reliance on recognition-basis. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of experience qualification: treating "knowing's experience" and "appearance's experience" as separate categories rather than dimensions of single recognition. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "experience" (*nyams*) is not achievement but natural radiance of recognition when confusion self-liberates.>
