[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: EMPTINESS AS VOID]

<Dharmas exhausted intellect-transcended meaning zinc-tin reliance wisdom change-change not recognition! Effortless vast great expanse all primordially transcended, bondage liberation abandon-accept not-existing manner samsara nirvana nameless great roll! Three: nature Dzogchen byar not sky-like meaning, bondage liberation non-dual own-mind emptiness root-free great thig-decided, object-vision mind's mirror collection six great pervade! First: outer vision inner awareness grasping-holding vision signs samsara nirvana gathered dharmas all—primordial emptiness universal emptiness great! Appearance-emptiness, intellect-emptiness, pure-emptiness, liberation-emptiness great! The three great emptinesses are not void but freedom from extremes. Risk of emptiness as void: nihilistic interpretation rather than emptiness as luminous clarity.>
