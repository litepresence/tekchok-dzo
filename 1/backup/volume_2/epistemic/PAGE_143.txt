[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND MEDITATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ANTI-MEDITATION NIHILISM]

<Object-thought transcended liberation arisen! Direction-limitless nameless arisen roll! Not-look look not, look-doer not, looked not see! Not-meditate meditated not, meditate transcended, meditated also not liberate! Not-analyze analyzed not, analyzed not see! Spontaneous self-liberation is view! Effort-free self-established meditation! No-activity conduct! Result not-hope! The transcendence of meditation is not rejection but recognition of natural completion. Risk of anti-meditation nihilism: rejecting all practice rather than recognizing practice and non-practice as non-dual.>
