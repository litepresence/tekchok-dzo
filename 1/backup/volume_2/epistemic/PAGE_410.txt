[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MEANING WITHOUT WORDS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: LINGUISTIC LITERALISM]

<Meaning actually not aspect appearance, tamed's merit and Buddha's blessings gathering from sound also syllables self-characteristic not. From Tantra Supreme Continuation: "Victorious ones' speech that, echo like letters not. As echo's sound, other's consciousness from arose, concept not and made not, thus Tathagata's speech, other's consciousness from arose, concept not and remember not." The Buddha's speech is not linguistic communication. Risk of linguistic literalism: treating these as descriptions of actual speech rather than pointing to transmission beyond words.>
