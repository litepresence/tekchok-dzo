[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WRATHFUL MANDALA ARCHITECTURE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TANTRIC LITERALISM]

<Great charnel ground Ye-ri blazing called this exists, also palace thus exists: skull house four stories possessing exists, also thus: dry skulls fruit made, flesh and blood walls made, bandha Tushita tongue made, width and height immeasurable, sky-iron lightning struck, blood rain falls, sun-moon seat made, crocodile mouth bridge made, eight great gods pillars adorned, great supreme lintel exists. Day wind whistles. The wrathful architecture uses tantric symbolism (skulls, blood, charnel ground) which is instructional, not literal. Risk of tantric literalism: mistaking these symbols for actual practices or places rather than recognition of impurities' purity.>
