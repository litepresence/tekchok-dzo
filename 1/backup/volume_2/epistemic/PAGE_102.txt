<The threefold classification of beings according to affliction ripening operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The opening statement establishes the karmic structure: sentient beings (*'gro ba*) are led into three realms (*khams gsum*) by three afflictions (*nyon mongs pa gsum*), and liberation occurs through the same three doorways—body, speech, and mind (*lus ngag yid gsum*). This presents a precise karmic taxonomy: the three poisons (desire, confusion, anger) ripen as three forms (bird, pig, snake), each emphasizing one of the three doors (speech, mind, body) as predominant. The first elaboration—desire-unpurified (*'dod chags ma dag pa*) ripening into bird-form (*bya'i gzugs su byung ba*) with action and speech predominant (*bya ba dang byed pa ngag gtso che ba*), love of speaking (*smra ba la dga' ba*), focus on speech objects (*brjod bya la gtsor byed*), great desire (*'dod pa che*), and desire-joy (*'dod chags la dga' ba*)—serves diagnostic function. The Sambhogakaya posture (*longs sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for desire-types: when one always maintains this posture, one becomes skilled in dharmata meaning (*chos nyid kyi don la mchog tu mkhas pa*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*), meeting practitioners through their predominant karmic pattern. Risk of determinism: interpreting these correlations as fixed destinies rather than recognition-entry points. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "desire," "confusion," and "anger" are modalities of single awareness; the "postures" are not corrective therapies but pointing-devices revealing that all three poisons are wisdom-display when recognized. The phrase "certainly become buddha" (*sangs rgya bar nges*) refers to recognition, not temporal attainment.>

[RISK: PATH-ESSENCE CONFUSION]

<The second elaboration—confusion-unpurified (*gti mug ma dag pa*) ripening into pig-form (*phag tu byung ba*) with mind predominant (*'gro ba'i yid gtso che ba*), many mind-changes (*sems kyi 'gyur ba mang*), mental dullness (*blo 'gyur*), great conceptual thought (*rnam rtog che*), dislike of speech (*brjod pa la mi dga'*), and love of sleep (*gnyid la dga' ba*)—continues the diagnostic framework. The phrase "waking the sleeper" (*bag la nyal slong bar byed pa*) is significant: this affliction-type is characterized by dormant tendency (*bag la nyal*) that requires awakening. The Dharmakaya posture (*chos sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for confusion-types: when one always abides in this posture, one definitely abides in dharmata throughout three times (*chos nyid la dus gsum du gnas par nges so*). The phrase "three times" (*dus gsum*)—past, present, future—indicates that recognition transcends temporal becoming: it is not that one will attain something in future, but that one recognizes what has always been abiding. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners whose confusion manifests as mental dullness and conceptual proliferation. Risk of path-essence confusion: treating "abiding in dharmata" as progressive attainment rather than recognition of primordial abiding. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "confusion" is itself a display of awareness; the Dharmakaya posture is not a method to eliminate confusion but a pointing-device that reveals confusion as self-arisen wisdom.>

[RISK: ESSENTIALISM]

<The third elaboration—anger-unpurified (*zhed sdang ma dag pa*) ripening into snake-form (*sbrul du smin pa*) with body-action predominant (*lus kyi byed pa gtso che ba*), love of body-action (*lus kyi bya ba la dga' ba*), wish to move (*'gro 'dod*), great body-power (*lus stobs che*), coarse body (*lus bong rags*), and love of physical adornment (*lus kyi byi dor la dga' ba*)—completes the threefold taxonomy. The snake-form is characterized by movement and physicality: the being loves to move, has great bodily power, and loves physical adornment (*byi dor*—refining/adorning the body). The Nirmanakaya posture (*sprul pa sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for anger-types: when one always abides in this posture, one certainly awakens (*sangs rgya bar nges so*). The phrase "certainly awakens" (*sangs rgya bar nges*) appears here without the qualification "skilled in dharmata meaning" that appeared for the desire-type. This is significant: for the anger-type, the connection to nirmanakaya (manifestation body) points directly to awakening as activity-display. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners whose anger manifests as physical restlessness and aggression. Risk of essentialism: treating "anger-types" as ontologically separate category rather than recognition-pattern description. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "anger" is a manifestation of awareness's energy (*lung*); the Nirmanakaya posture is not anger-management therapy but revelation that anger-energy is itself the display of wisdom when recognized.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CATEGORIZATION]

<The definitive statements about posture completeness operate from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The declaration—"three postures are certain" (*bzhugs stangs gsum du nges so*)—establishes pedagogical completeness: there are exactly three postures, not more (superfluous) nor fewer (incomplete). The rationale—sentient beings' aspirations (*'gro ba'i smon so*) appearing in body, speech, and mind, and liberation occurring through the bondage of those same three—indicates that the three postures precisely correspond to the three bondage-structures. The phrase "not more" (*de las mang na mi dgos*) addresses the danger of proliferation: adding more postures would miss the precise recognition-coordinate. The phrase "not fewer" (*nyung na ma tshang bas*) addresses the danger of incompleteness: fewer postures would miss some practitioners' predominant patterns. The final line—"at this time, cutting off speech about the speech-point" (*'di'i dus ngag gi gnad smra ba bcad pa ste*)—marks the transition from karmic-structural teaching to direct introduction. The "speech-point" (*ngag gi gnad*) refers to the esoteric transmission that cannot be expressed in words; "cutting off" (*bcad pa*) indicates that the definitive teaching now goes beyond conceptual elaboration. Risk of categorization: treating the three postures as rigid categories rather than skillful-means (*upāya*) that point beyond all categories. The Dzogchen view recognizes that body, speech, and mind are never truly separate; the three postures are recognition-facilitating devices, not ontological divisions. The "cutting off of speech" marks the definitive recognition: awareness is beyond all descriptions, including the threefold classification itself.>
