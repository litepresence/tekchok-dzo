[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL APPEARANCE WITHOUT MARKS]
[DECLERATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CONCEPTUALIZATION]

<Actual wherever established not, that itself from: nature's appearance, marks holding not at all, color not self-clear, knowing and rigpa's aspects merely, holding's object whatever not, therefore conceptualization's holding aspect not. Light transcended self-resonance, primordially distinction abides. Body transcended self-resonance, pure great mudra abides. The natural appearance transcends all conceptual marks. Risk of conceptualization: attempting to mentally grasp or categorize the transcendent nature.>
