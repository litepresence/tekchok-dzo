[RISK: HEDONISM]

<Years five hundred fifty sustained. Field that hunger and thirst mind remember merely satisfied. There anxiety not, supreme bliss. Birth existence also water eight limbs possessing drank, dispelled. Flowers various emanation body that offering great do. Palace four corners pearl composed stupas four exist, those four between bell silver net thread connecting. Thread wind moved, bell sounds mind-pleasing various arise. Four directions flags various banners four exist, wind moved fragrance pleasant various arise. Palace this from east direction five hundred yojanas passed above exists. There born bodhisattvas those thirty-three gods and enjoyment equal. East direction emanation body field that likewise exists. The spontaneous fulfillment in pure realms is not hedonistic pleasure but freedom from craving. Risk of hedonism: mistaking these descriptions as endorsing sensory indulgence rather than recognizing craving's cessation.>
