[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION RESTING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The recognition-resting teaching (*rig pa mig nas drangs pa las byung ba'o*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *rigpa-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The gnad: recognition sees and rests (*rig pa mig nas drangs pa las*)—this indicates that recognition (*rig pa*) looks into (*mig*) and rests (*drangs pa*) through which it arises (*las byung*). This is not gradual stabilization but direct recognition of awareness's nature. The statement that therefore za 'ogur khyim lta bu ni sngon 'gro dag par byas pa las byung ba'o*—establishes that when recognition rests, appearance (*snang ba*) becomes like looking at (*lta bu*) za 'ogur (hermit) that goes (*sngon 'gro dag*) doing (*byas pa*). Risk of reification: treating "recognition-resting" as technique rather than awareness's own capacity to recognize.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE QUALITIES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: QUALITY-REIFICATION]

<The five-qualities teaching (*brtson 'grus kyi khyad kyis zhag gsum dang*) operates as *instructional provisionality* for structured understanding. Therefore (*de dag kyang*) established (*brtson 'grus*) five qualities (*khyad*)—this indicates that recognition establishes five essential qualities. Also (*bdun dang*)—one, precious (*bcu bzhi na gcig skye gcig 'gag pa'o*)—this indicates that recognition is one (*gcig*) precious (*bcu bzhi na*) that arises (*skye gcig*) simultaneously. The gnad that therefore ordinary mind (*phan chad ni nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba ste*)—this describes that recognition's experience (*nyams*) unfolds (*'phel gyi*) like ordinary mind's (*mnyam pa nyid*) appearance (*snang ba*). Risk of quality-reification: treating "five qualities" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition-descriptions.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DELUSION RESTING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: DELUSION-REIFICATION]

<The delusion-resting teaching (*de phan chad ni nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba ste*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. The gnad that therefore (*de dag ni sems kyi sngon 'gro'i dus na*)—this indicates that recognition's experience (*nyams*) is not subject to time (*dus na*). The statement that cognition (*rtog pa*) not separate (*tha dad par bslang ba de 'gags pa'i rtags yin no*)—this is *sems-side* provisional teaching that delusion (*rtog pa*) and emptiness are not separate (*tha dad par*). Risk of delusion-reification: treating "delusion" as entity to eliminate rather than recognition of its non-existence.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION APPEARANCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: APPEARANCE-REIFICATION]

<The recognition-appearance teaching (*de nas rig pa rang gi ngo bo'i snang ba 'char te*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Recognition (*rig pa*) sees its own essence (*ngo bo*) appearing (*'char te*)—this establishes that recognition's appearance is seeing its own essence directly. The gnad that thigle (*thig le*) arises (*ler 'char ba ni lu gu rgyud gcig tu 'dus pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that thigle (*thig le*) appears from (*ler*) vessel-hook-continuum (*lu gu rgyud*) as one (*gcig tu*) from which recognition arises (*las byung*). Risk of appearance-reification: treating "thigle" as subtle energy rather than recognition-display mode.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL APPEARANCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DUALISM]

<The non-dual appearance teaching (*de nas thig le lnga 'brel du snang ba ni thabs dang shes rab rnam par dag pa las byung ba'o*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that five-thigle (*thig le lnga*) non-dual (*'brel du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba ni*)—this establishes that five-thigle (*thig le lnga*) and recognition (*snang ba ni*) are not separate. Through method (*thabs dang*) and wisdom (*shes rab*) recognition (*byung ba'o*)—this indicates that recognition arises through method and wisdom. Risk of dualism: treating "five-thigle" and "recognition" as separate rather than non-dual.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL RESTING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DUALISM]

<The non-dual resting teaching (*de nas thig le lnga sbrel du snang ba ni ye shes lnga la byan tshud pa las byung ba'o*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Five-thigle (*thig le lnga*) non-dual (*sbrel du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba ni*) wisdom (*ye shes*) five (*lnga la*)—this establishes recognition rests (*las byung ba*) in the union (*byan tshud pa*) of five-thigle and wisdom (*ye shes lnga*). Risk of dualism: treating "five-thigle" and "wisdom" as separate entities rather than non-dual recognition.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The recognition-gathering teaching (*mngon sum gyi thig le dang 'brel lugs mi 'dra ste chung yod pa'i phyir ro*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Recognition's (*mngon sum*) thigle and connection (*'brel*) are not different (*mi 'dra ste*)—this establishes non-duality. The statement that therefore (*de phan chad ni nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba ste*)—recognition's experience (*nyams*) unfolds (*'phel gyi*) like ordinary mind's (*mnyam pa nyid*) appearance (*snang ba*)—this indicates that recognition's experience appears ordinary yet contains (*chung yod pa*) the gnad (*phyir ro*) of resting in non-duality. Risk of reification: treating "thigle" as substance rather than recognition-display mode.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ORDINARY MIND EXPERIENCE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: EXPERIENTIALISM]

<The ordinary-mind-experience teaching (*de phan chad ni nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba ste*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for structured path. The gnad that therefore cognition (*rtog pa*)—this is *upāya* indicating that practitioners recognize (*'di dag ni sems kyi sngon 'gro'i dus na*) that experience is not subject to time (*dus na*). The statement that not separate (*tha dad par bslang ba de 'gags pa'i rtags yin no*)—this establishes that delusion (*rtog pa*) and emptiness appear separate but are not different. Risk of experientialism: treating "ordinary mind experience" as state to achieve rather than recognition-description.>

[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<The thigle-non-dual teaching (*re lde tsam las gru chad snang ba*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The gnad that object gathering (*yul gru tsam las mthong tshad do*)—this indicates that when recognition (*mthong*) sees (*gru tsam la*) the object (*yul*), exhaustion (*tshad do*) occurs. The gnad that separation (*zhes pa dang*)—this is *upāya*: recognition (*rang byung gi rgyud las*) arises (*las*) from vessel-hook-continuum (*lu gu rgyud*). Risk of substantialism: treating "vessel-hook-continuum" as anatomical structure rather than recognition-display continuum.>

[5267-5278]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION SEEING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The recognition-seeing teaching (*rang ngo mthong bas 'di ltar ro*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Recognition (*rang ngo*) seeing (*mthong bas*) this (*'di ltar ro*)—this establishes that recognition (*mthong ba*) sees directly (*'di ltar*) and realizes (*ro*) the gnad. The statement that wisdom (*kha dog lnga yi 'od*)—wisdom's (*kha dog*) five (*lnga yi*) self-resonance (*'od kyi yang*)—this indicates that wisdom's luminosity (*'od*) also (*yang*) flows. The gnad that recognition (*yar mtshams las ni sor bzhi las*)—this is *upāya* for recognition to rest in recognition (*yar mtshams las ni*). Risk of reification: treating "five-lights" as external illumination rather than awareness's own luminosity.>

The statement that therefore (*skad cig ma ni bcu drug la*)—this is the gnad: recognition (*skad cig ma*) one (*gcig*) precious (*bcu drug la*). The gnad that (*bral ba'i skyes bu skal bzang ba*)—separation's (*bral ba*i*) born child (*skyes bu*) capacity (*skal*) pure (*bzang ba*)—this indicates that when recognition rests, the born child (*skyes bu*) of separation (*bral ba*i*) has capacity (*skal*) to be pure (*bzang ba*). Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "born child" as literal birth rather than recognition-metaphor for arising display.>

The gnad that therefore (*bral ba'i skyes bu skal bzang ba*)—separation's (*bral ba*i*) born child (*skyes bu*) capacity (*skal*) pure (*bzang ba*)—this indicates that recognition rests as separation-born purity. The gnad that (*gru chad rnam par gang snang ba*)—appearance (*snang ba*) whatever (*gang*) exhausted (*chu chad*) appears (*snang ba*).
