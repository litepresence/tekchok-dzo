[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO TEMPORAL STRUCTURE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: LITERALIZATION]

<Appearance's birth manner twenty this seven days completed, intermediate existence that life seven days passed ceases. Life that not? Also latency force previous appearance awakened, mind's body taken, seven times die, seven times birth appearance dream birth-death like. Seven births also miraculously born, death and birth all moment do. Virtue's power apply, seven seven seven collections done, benefit great. That also birth seven abiding appearance seven dying appearance seven—twenty-one first one, body taking duration extreme. Seven seven forty-nine days, that class karma different, body individual taken. Generally intermediate existence life short extreme seven days, long extreme forty-nine. The temporal structure (7 days, 21 moments, 49 days) is instructional scaffolding, not literal temporal physics. Risk of literalization: treating these numbers as ontological facts rather than pedagogical tools for structuring practice.>
