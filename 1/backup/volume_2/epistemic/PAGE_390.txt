[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COMPASSION WISDOM GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DUALISTIC FUNCTIONALISM]

<Compassion wisdom two's dawning ground do, object and aspect actual meet not. From Spontaneous Liberation: "That also essence body abiding, dharma and sambhogakaya enjoyment emanation's part, not divided doing not manner, momentum established from, body color etc. mind object not, nature dawning light's manner, white red yellow and green blue, marks appearance not, appearance not knowing's momentum established, compassion dawning various from." Compassion and wisdom are non-dual, not functional complements. Risk of dualistic functionalism: treating compassion and wisdom as separate functions that work together rather than inseparable aspects of the ground.>
