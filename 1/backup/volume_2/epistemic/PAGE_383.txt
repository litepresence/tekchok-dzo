[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DEEP CLARITY GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<From that itself: "Primordially self-pure great, perfected peak abides, stone-with marks self-pure, deep clarity great ground abides." From Self-Arisen: "Jewel variously arranged net, balanced." Fourth, clear light dharmadhatu coiling four: dissolving not-dull. The deep clarity is the ground's nature, not a substantial entity. Risk of substantialism: treating clarity as a thing rather than the empty luminosity of awareness.>
