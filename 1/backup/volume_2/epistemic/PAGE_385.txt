[RISK: ATTRIBUTION ERROR]

<Unchanging completely vast great, subtle holding difficult great, great seeing not great, round shape not great, moving breath not great, clear color black great, not-existing soft great, appearance examining difficult great, empty appearance great. These paradoxical qualities describe what transcends ordinary categories. Risk of attribution error: applying ordinary conceptual attributes to the transcendent ground.>
