[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DELUSION AS WISDOM]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DELUSION AFFIRMATION]

<Vision delusion's nature this, wisdom is previously not seen! Concept-with delusion's basis not-existing, alaya dharmakaya great realized! Delusion's self-concept continuity ceased! Thus delusion-free vision, primordially fallen main-point from arising! Beings' aggregates buddha body, primordially is who not awareness! Aggregates buddha possession-lord, channels abiding letters completely arise! Vision delusion is wisdom when recognized. Risk of delusion affirmation: mistaking this as permission to remain deluded rather than urgent call to recognize.>
