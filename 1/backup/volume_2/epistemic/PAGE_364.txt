[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KARMIC OBSTRUCTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DETERMINISM]

<Going desire also obstruction possessing, powerless. Cause: above dharmata truth mind not believing. Twenty examples: grass fire holding like, karma and latency force womb abode holding; mud swamp birth or jewel or wood etc. holding like, samsara self-rigpa's wisdom holding; bird egg holding like, father's samadhi's rtsis intermediate existence's being holding; summer's rotting flesh bees gathering like, father's samadhi's womb gate intermediate existence beings immeasurable gathered, father's bliss taste merely there birth karma possessing, powerless womb enter—mother's excrement path enters. These sun-moon union from, this scripture not accorded, beings' entering. The karmic process binds beings through habitual patterns. Risk of determinism: believing karma is absolute rather than recognizing recognition can liberate.>
