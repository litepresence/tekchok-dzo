[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TRIUNE GROUND AS NON-TRINITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: THEOLOGICAL MISTAKEN FOR ONTOLOGICAL]

Longchenpa presents the ground (*gzhi*) through the triad of essence (*ngo bo*), nature (*rang bzhin*), and compassion (*thugs rje*)—yet immediately subverts trinitarian reading. Essence abides as body, nature as the five-light display basis within life-force wind, compassion as self-arisen awareness-wisdom. The two knowledges (*mkhyen pa gnyis*) appear: knowing-all (*thams cad mkhyen*) referring to dharmata's inner clarity, and knowing-all-aspects (*rnam pa thams cad mkhyen*) referring to phenomena's outer clarity. Epistemic precision: these are not two different knowledges but one wisdom viewed from two perspectives—like one face seen in mirror or directly. Risk: readers may construct a "trinity" theology (Father-Son-Spirit analogue) rather than recognizing these as descriptive pointers to what's already singular and nondual.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WIND AS WISDOM-VEHICLES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PHYSIOLOGICAL REDUCTION]

The five winds are explained as emerging from life-force wind's compassion-awareness-wisdom aspect. When pure: Buddha-wisdom; when impure: sentient being's conceptual aggregates. This is not "winds becoming wisdom" but winds AS wisdom-display, impure AS conceptual-confusion. The four branch winds emanate from compassion-power like rays from sun—rising horse of prajna, descending prajna-ray-light, fire-equal ripening power, and pervasive completion power. Epistemic stance: these are not subtle body practices to manipulate but descriptions of how awareness already moves. Risk: practitioners may reduce this to pranayama or energetic techniques, missing that "wind" (*rlung*) here refers to dynamic awareness-display, not respiratory physiology.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-EMANATION AS PERFECT DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORAL SEQUENCE]

The text states that although these exist in life-force wind's aspect, "in the expanse they have not emanated" (*dbyings su ni ma 'phros*). This is crucial: "not emanated" does not mean "pre-emanation" (temporal priority) but "never separated from source." The basis of emanation never ceases—this is the heart-essence alone (*snying po tsam*). The Kun-gyal citation reinforces: body abiding like a reflection in clear water, speech as four branch winds like fire sparks. Epistemic precision: "like" (*bzhin*) indicates simile without identity—the reflection is not the face, yet without face, no reflection. Risk: readers may think this describes a chronological process (first ground, then emanation) rather than atemporal co-presence.
