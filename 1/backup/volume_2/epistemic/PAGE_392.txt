[DZOGCHEN VIEW – APPEARANCE WITHOUT PROLIFERATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

<Self-face existence non-existence's proliferation ceased, body and wisdom even not established, other-appearance Buddha's compassion and, tamed's aspiration form body activity with appearance, space bird's offering pillar and jewel and wish-fulfilling tree like desire. From Avatamsaka: "Peace body wish-fulfilling tree like clear becomes, mind-jewel as non-conceptual, liberation in between world benefit always, this proliferation free appearance is." Here also kadag's self-face that like, subtle wisdom dharmadhatu exists from body and wisdom dawns. The freedom from proliferation is not non-existence. Risk of nihilism: interpreting non-establishment as utter void rather than freedom from conceptual extremes.>
