[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

<Masterful analysis:
The seven greatnesses (*chen po*) establish superiority through comparative doxography spanning Hīnayāna (*nyan thos*) through outer/inner nine levels (*phyi nang rim dgu*) of tantra. The rhetorical question—"If this is also Ati, is it superior to Ati?"—initiates internal Dzogchen polemics. The Wylie term *'phags* (superior/transcendent) operates technically here, distinguishing not merely "better than" but indicating ontological transcendence of limitations. This is *sems*-side pedagogical framing: establishing supremacy within a hierarchical map before dissolving the hierarchy itself through *rigpa*-side recognition.>

[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

<Masterful analysis:
The critique of the three Ati sections (*sems klong man ngag gi sde gsum*) focuses on Mind-section (*sems sde*) limitations: its "ground-free confidence" (*gzhi bral la gdeng du byed pa*) operates through deliberation without direct seeing (*yid dpyod tsam*), merely establishing that mind flashes self-clear (*sems dar cig rang gsal du 'dug*) without the ninefold change/unchange (*mi 'gya dgu 'gyur*) arriving at ultimate meaning. The key distinction: this system sees *rig pa* directly (*mngon sum du mthong*), whereas Mind-section only gains certainty (*gnad nges pa*) conceptually. The Wylie phrase *don la dngos su bltar med pa* (no direct seeing of meaning) identifies the limitation: conceptual certainty versus immediate recognition.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Masterful analysis:
The Instruction-section (*man ngag gi sde*) critique targets its temporal reliance: depending on the three bardos (*phyi nang gsang ba'i skor gsum bar do'i dus*) implies waiting for death or specific opportunities. This system's "light-body liberation" (*'od lus su grol ba*) transcends such temporal dependency. The *upāya* of establishing superiority functions pedagogically: reassuring practitioners that the present instructions represent the pinnacle of the path, yet the Dzogchen view ultimately dissolves all comparative hierarchies as conventional (*tha snyad*). The *gnad* (crucial point) being "unspeakable" (*brjod kyis ming lang*) indicates definitive meaning beyond comparative discourse.>

[RISK: MEDITATION AS DOING]

<Masterful analysis:
The crucial distinction regarding channels and winds (*rtsa rlung*): common approaches use conventional coarse channels-winds (*kun rdzob rag pa*) as path, requiring body-training (*lus sbyong*) and effortful cultivation (*rtsol bcas*), creating many obstacles and deviations. This system uses the "three unmovable crucial points" (*gnad mi gyo ba gsum*) without making them the path, instead employing ultimate wisdom channels-winds (*don dam ye shes kyi rtsa rlung*) beyond grasping and effort. The body trains as light-purity (*lus 'od du dag par sbyong*) without relying on common purification obstacles. Risk: treating this as "effortless effort" still implies doing; definitive recognition transcends even the distinction between effort and effortlessness.>

[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Masterful analysis:
Deviations (*gol sa*) arise for those depending on intellect and deliberation (*blos byas yid dpyod*) who have not seen meaning—confusing path and experience-appearance, making knowledge-experience (*shes nyams*) primary, thus not transcending deviation-obscuration. This system has no deviation because sense-faculties see directly (*dbang pos mngon sum du mthong*), arriving definitively at meaning. The phrase *don tan la dngos su phebs zin* (already arrived at meaning) indicates atemporal completion, not future achievement. Risk of temporalization: reading "arrived" as sequential progress rather than recognition of ever-present ground.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The assertion that there is no confusion-ground (*'khrul sa*) here because knowledge-experience is not unstable/changeable (*ra ma ri skad cig 'gyur ldog can*) and does not measure path-standards establishes definitive Dzogchen view. The "confusion" of other systems is not a place one falls into but unrecognized stability itself. When recognition is unstable—momentarily arising and reversing—one is still operating within conventional path frameworks. The definitive view recognizes that awareness never moves from its own nature; apparent "instability" is merely unrecognized continuity.>
