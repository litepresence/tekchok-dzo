[RISK: SIMILE REIFICATION]

<The three similes establishing Dzogchen view operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The vessel simile (*lu ni dper na*): like a good water vessel (*chu'i lu ma bzang po*), water increases and decreases without arising (*chu 'phel 'grib med par 'byung ba*), spontaneous presence without effort (*dang 'dra bar*), body and wisdom increase (*sku dang ye shes kyi 'phel*), various path appearances (*sgo sna tshogs su lam snang*) appear without completion (*ma rdzogs kyi bar la*), arising from that (*de las 'char bar byed pa'o*). The hook simile (*gu ni*): within that very one (*de nyid kyi nang du*), dharmata's non-mistaken view and meditation (*chos nyid phyin ci ma log pa'i lta ba dang sgom pa*) are drawn (*'gugs par byed la*). The continuum simile (*rgyud ni*): pervading samsara-nirvana (*'khor 'das la khyab cing*), from those gathered appearances (*snang ba de'i tshogs rnams las*), clarifying (*gsal bar byed pa'o*) bodies (*sku*), thigle dispersion (*thig le 'phro ba*), increase (*mched pa*), gathering (*'du ba*) and so forth. These similes operate as *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) to point toward recognition. Risk of simile reification: treating "vessel," "hook," and "continuum" as actual entities rather than metaphorical descriptions of awareness's nature. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "water increases and decreases without arising" points to awareness's self-display not being truly caused; "non-mistaken view and meditation drawn" points to recognition being drawn into dharmata; "pervading samsara-nirvana" points to awareness's non-dual nature never truly separate from appearances.>

[RISK: FOURFOLD APPEARANCE ESSENTIALIZING]

<The *Thal 'Gyur* citation on fourfold appearance operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation: "Slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom (*rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub*); from that (*de las*) appearance becomes four (*snang ba bzhir 'gyur te*)—(1) dharmata actual appearance (*chos nyid mngon sum snang ba yis*) destroys intellectual grasping-view (*yid dpyod 'dzin pa'i lta ba bsnubs*); (2) experience-appearance increase upward (*nyams snang gong du 'phel ba yis*) causes delusion-appearance to disappear (*'khrul pa'i snang ba nub par byed*); (3) rigpa measure-reached appearance (*rig pa tshad phebs snang ba yis*) transcends three-kaya realization-path-appearance (*sku gsum rtogs pa'i lam snang 'das*); (4) dharmata exhaustion-appearance (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba yis*) cuts three-realm samsara continuum (*khams gsum 'khor ba'i rgyun thag bcad*)." These four appearances are not sequential stages but simultaneous modalities of recognition-deepening: (1) direct appearance (*mngon sum*)—recognition itself; (2) experiential increase (*nyams 'phel*)—recognition's deepening; (3) measure-completion (*tshad phebs*)—recognition's fullness; (4) exhaustion (*zad pa*)—recognition's consummation. The phrase "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) indicates that recognition reaches its natural measure without exceeding or falling short. The phrase "exhaustion" (*zad pa*) refers to exhaustion of dualistic perception, not exhaustion of awareness itself. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of fourfold appearance essentializing: treating these "four" as mandatory sequential progression rather than recognition-descriptions. The Dzogchen view recognizes these as awareness's own display (*rang snang*), never departing from primordial purity (*ka dag*), spontaneously self-liberating (*rang grol) without effort (*lhun grub*).>

[RISK: FOURFOLD DIVISION REIFICATION]

<The detailed enumeration of fourfold appearance divisions operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The statement: "The four appearances are definitely (*snang ba bzhir grangs nges pa ni*)" then lists: (1) external (*phyir*) sun-moon four-times increase-decrease (*nam zla dus bzhi'i 'phel zad pa*); (2) internal (*nang du*) body-speech-mind-consciousness four bindings liberation (*lus ngag yid sems bzhi'i bcings pa las dgrol ba*); (3) secret (*gsang bar*) four-empowerments definitive showing (*dbang bzhi'i nges pa ston pa*); (4) suchness (*de kho na nyid du*) four-lamp appearances definitive (*sgron ma bzhi'i snang ba nges pa*), therefore looking at that (*la ltos nas*) four are definite (*bzhir nges so*). This establishes that the "four appearances" manifest on multiple levels: external (cosmic cycles), internal (subtle body), secret (empowerment), and suchness (ultimate). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from structural mapping. Risk of fourfold division reification: treating these "four" as rigid categories rather than pedagogical presentation of the same recognition from different angles. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "external sun-moon," "internal four bindings," "secret four empowerments," and "suchness four lamps" all refer to the same recognition displayed through different modes: the cosmic, the energetic, the empowering, and the ultimate. All four point to awareness's self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated nature.>

[RISK: SEQUENTIAL STAGE FETISHISM]

<The explanation of definite sequence (*go rims nges pa*) operates from *sems*-side pedagogy. The explanation: without seeing first ground dharmata-directly (*dang po'i gzhi chos nyid mngon sum ma mthong na*), the remaining three have no arising-basis (*lhag ma gsum gyi 'char gzhi med pas*), therefore first dharmata-direct-appearance arises as support-base (*rten dang brten pa'i gzhir dang po chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba 'char ba'o*). When that itself (*de nyid shar bas*) dawns, seeing all dharmas' meaning (*chos thams cad kyi don mthong bas*), obtaining self-arisen wisdom from self (*rang byung gi ye shes rang las rnyed pa zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that recognition is not attainment of new wisdom but recognition of what has always been self-arisen (*rang byung*). The crucial instruction: that appearance (*de nas mngon pa de*) if not taken as experience (*nyams su ma myong na*), no fruit arises from mere words (*tshig tsam la 'bras bu mi 'byung ba las*), but experiencing the meaning (*don nyams su myong bas*) causes that experience to increase upward (*de'i nyams gong 'phel du byung ba'o*). Therefore, the measure of experience-arisen (*de ltar nyams skyes pa'i tshad*) must be stabilized (*brtan par byed dgos te*): without stabilizing (*ma brtan na*) no confidence enters experience (*nyams la thug pa med pas*), not holding dharma (*chos la zin pa med*), and no warmth arises (*sangs la rgya rgyu mi 'byung ba las*)—when reaching the measure of experience-stabilization (*nyams brtan pa'i tshad la phebs pas*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of sequential stage fetishism: taking the "first...then..." structure as mandatory temporal progression rather than pedagogical presentation of logical dependence. The Dzogchen view recognizes that the "sequence" describes recognition's logical structure, not its temporal unfolding: recognition must first recognize its own nature before "deepening" can occur, but in actual recognition, all four aspects are simultaneously present.>
