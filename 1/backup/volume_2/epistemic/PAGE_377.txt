[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LIBERATION AS ORIGINAL PURITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

*Mu-tig-phreng-ba*: "Liberation place itself is primordial!" Primordial primordial purity, awareness self-recognition, now cause not return, confusion-basis exhausted, result called name becomes! Detailed above ground's section explained, particularly stain-free divided, know!

[CONTEXT] FRUITION TERMINOLOGY: The shift from "ground" (*gzhi*) to "result" (*'bras bu*) is nominal, not ontological. Longchenpa establishes that "result" is merely a name for recognition of what was never other than primordially pure. This reflects the *snying thig* view that path and fruition are non-dual.

Second, three: expanse liberation actual; expanse dwelling nature; expanse dharmatā's intent how coiled! First: faculties sharp-dull-medium three liberation time, result difference not, time three Buddhas all intent exhausted Dharmakāya expression-free that itself one, face-equal difference-free nature thigle essence single Buddha! Also this life spontaneously accomplished or bardo self-appearance recognized, or emanation field breath sent, path-appearance's body and wisdom's appearance outer-clear aspects, spontaneous presence dissolution manner stages expanse into dissolve, crystal-light inside gathered like time, appearance emptiness liberates! Wisdom expanse dissolved, form-body Dharmakāya's expanse parinirvāṇa, entity and sign not, space-like dharmatā taste one—space space into dissolve like!

Risk: Temporalization—reading dissolution as chronological process rather than atemporal recognition.
