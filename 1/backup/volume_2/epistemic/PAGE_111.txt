[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: FRUITION DEFERRAL]

<The arising of awareness-measure-reached appearance (*rig pa tshad phebs kyi snang ba byung ba*) marks definitive Dzogchen view. The crucial distinction: even when rigpa-appearance reaches measure (*rig pa'i snang ba tshad la phebs*), if it does not change into something other than that (*kyang de las gzhan du mi 'gyur na*), it is not different from considering three kayas as fruition (*sku gsum 'bras bur 'dod pa dang khyad med la*), and from apparent marks/signs (*dngos snang mtshan ma*) one does not hope for meaning's fruition (*chos la don gyi 'bras bu re ba thun mong ba rnams dang khyad med pa las*)—this indicates that Dzogchen view does not treat three kayas as goals to attain in future but as recognition of what is present. The explanation: appearance-experience (*snang nyams*) dissolves into ground (*gzhi la thim ste*), subtle-coarse appearance-grasping ceases (*phra rags kyi snang 'dzin nub nas*), and through engaging in primordial purity dharma-exhaustion (*ka dag chos zad la spyod pas*), dharmata-exhaustion-appearance arises (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba byung ba'o*). This establishes that recognition is not progressive but revelatory: when experience dissolves into its ground, grasping ceases, and one abides in primordial purity (*ka dag*), what arises is dharmata-exhaustion—not dharmata destroyed but recognition that dharmata has never been obscured (*zad pa*). The detailed structure: first two (*de dag kyang dang po gnyis*) are Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*), measure-reached (*tshad phebs*) is Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*), exhaustion (*zad pa*) is Dharmakaya (*chos sku*). Through making them path-appearance (*chos sku'i snang ba lam du byas pas*), three kayas appear as path-appearance (*sku gsum lam snang du shar bas*), and fruition dharma-exhaustion primordial purity reaches expanse (*'bras bu chos zad ka dag gi dbyings la thug pa'i phyir*). The conclusion: self-appearance's potency-three kayas (*rang snang gi rtsal sku gsum*) dissolve into rigpa's state (*rig pa'i ngang du thim pas*)—this is rigpa-primordial-purity's fruition (*rig pa ka dag gi 'bras bu*). From rigpa's expanse (*rig pa'i dbyings nas*), primordially self-potency-three kayas arise (*gdod kyis rang rtsal sku gsum shar bas*) and perform benefit (*don byed pa*), which is called (*zhes bya ste*) "essence not even heard by name from other vehicles" (*g pa gzhan nas ming yang mi grag pa'i snying po*) and "King of Vehicles' intention" (*g pa rgyal po'i dgongs pa*). This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of fruition deferral: interpreting "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) as a goal to achieve rather than recognition's own self-display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that fruition was never separate from ground of recognition: three kayas are not attained but recognized as self-display (*rang snang*).>

[ORDINARY COGNITION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: DIRECT APPEARANCE CLASSIFICATION]

<The fourfold extensive explanation (*gnyis pa so so'i rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa*) of individual natures operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The fourfold structure: (1) direct appearance (*chos nyid mngon sum*); (2) experience-increase (*nyams gong 'phel*); (3) rigpa-measure-reached (*rig pa tshad phebs*); (4) dharmata-exhaustion-appearance (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba rgyas par bshad pa'o*). The detailed analysis of direct appearance (*dang po la gnyis te*) includes two aspects: (1) general connection-establishment (*mngon sum spyi'i 'brel dgod pa dang*)—recognizing the fundamental connection between appearance and awareness; (2) individual characteristic ascertainment (*rang gi mtshan nyid dngos gzung ba'o*)—recognizing the unique characteristics of each appearance. The four types of direct appearance: (1) *dang po ni spyir mngon sum*—conventional direct appearance (*kun rdzob tha snyad la grags pa'i mngon sum*), which appears as five sense-objects (*dbang po'i mngon sum gzugs sogs yul lnga snang ba'i rang bzhin*); (2) *yid kyi mngon sum*—mental direct appearance (*nyid kyi mngon sum*), which appears as conceptual certainty in conceptual object (*yid kyi mngon sum yul nye bar spyod pa rgyu mtshan nges pa'i rtog yul na snang ba*); (3) *rang rig pa'i mngon sum*—self-awareness direct appearance (*rang rig pa'i mngon sum*), which experiences internal bliss/suffering (*nang du bde sdug la sogs myong ba ces pa'i snang ba*); (4) *rnal 'byor gyi mngon sum*—yogic direct appearance, which directly encounters suchness (*nyid kyi don nye bar mjal ba de kho na nyid*), entering suchness, individual correct rigpa and its appearance-object non-dual (*so so yang dag pa'i rig pa dang de'i snang yul gnyis su med pa*), free from grasping-grasped experience certainty (*'dzin dang bral bar myong ba'i nges pa ste*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of direct appearance classification: treating these "four types" as rigid categories rather than pedagogical presentation. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all four "direct appearances" are conventional designations (*tha snyad*) for what is ultimately single awareness-display (*rang snang*). The phrase "conventional direct appearance" (*kun rdzob tha snyad la grags pa'i mngon sum*) indicates that even "direct appearance" is ultimately conventional when spoken of as "type"—actual recognition transcends all classification. The phrase "self-awareness direct appearance" refers to awareness's self-knowledge (*rang rig*)—not separate knower and known. The phrase "yogic direct appearance" refers to recognition through yoga (union) of samsara-nirvana (*'khor 'das*), not a special achievement beyond ordinary experience. The definitive view transcends even these four: direct appearance is not "seen" (*mthong ba*) but recognized as awareness's own nature (*rang ngo*).>
