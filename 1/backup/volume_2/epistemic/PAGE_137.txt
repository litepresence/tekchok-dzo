[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DHARMAKAYA POSTURE THREE UNMOVING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: POSTURAL OBSESSION]

<Dharmakaya's posture speech explained: three unmoving essence realized, three bindings measure obtained, three confidences liberation shown, four fearlessnesses. Body like three perfected lions' strengths, whoever without fear, body's key point dispels three realms' fear. Continuous sitting key point—body dog's crouch dharmadhatu and rigpa meet. The posture is support for recognition, not recognition itself. Risk of postural obsession: fixating on physical position rather than recognizing mind's nature.>
