[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMOTIONAL PROJECTION MECHANISM]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PSYCHOLOGIZATION]

<Enemy chasing, refuge seen, hiding there mind moment attachment, birth taken. All desire realm birth mind desire-attachment surge arising, object passionate longing especially great arises. Form realm born, coarse appearance hatred, light passionate longing arises. Formless born, appearance whatever passionate longing not, nothing-at-all mind abiding merely, joy arises. Container-contained appearance also moment merely, then latency great force ceases. Here clairvoyance arising cause from what arose: dharmata seed existing, here obstructing body self-power not, dharmata above seen blessings arose. The mechanism of rebirth is presented through emotional projection—desire, hatred, and delusion driving the process. Risk of psychologization: reducing this to mere psychology rather than recognizing the ontological force of emotional latencies.>
