[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIX REALMS CYCLING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: COSMOLOGICAL LITERALISM]

<Karma's power: joy-possessing, dispute-possessing, equal-possessing, two-possessing, hunger-possessing, great suffering possessing abodes, whirlpool-like one to one going, beings six called. From Self-Arisen: "Conceptualization samsara only, great crying abode and, extreme hunger abodes and, dull and intoxicated great abode." The six realms are presented as states of mind driven by karma, not as geographical locations. Risk of cosmological literalism: reading these as actual places rather than modes of confused consciousness.>
