[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GNAD PRESENTATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: GNOBLIFICATION]

<The definitive teaching on gnad (*gnad*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The opening gnad—within mind, dharmata-object (*nang du chos nyid yul gyi gnad*)—establishes that recognition's relationship to its own display (*chos nyid*) is not subject-object relationship but self-recognition. The gnad of practice's door (*'char byed sgo'i gnad*)—the path to enter. This is *instructional provisionality* describing how recognition recognizes itself through entering into practice. Risk of gnoblification: treating "gnad" as mystical point rather than recognition-key.>

[4960-4969]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WIND-RESTING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TECHNICISM]

<The wind-resting (*rlung gi gnas pa'i gnad*) teaching operates from *sems-side* pedagogy for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The three gnads: (1) wind's dwelling-place (*rlung gi gnas pa'i gnad*)—where awareness abides; (2) path-eliminated by three (*lam bsal ba dang*)—what path eliminates; (3) resting, meditation (*gsang bar goms pa*) and practicing-capacity's sequence (*tshad kyi rim pa*)—how recognition stabilizes. The meditation sequences: meditation's sequence (*smin pa rtags kyi rim pa*), worn-out sequence (*mthar thug zad pa'i rim pa*), and three practicing-holding together (*gsum gyis tshad gzung ba dang*)—these are structural descriptions, not temporal stages. Risk of technicism: treating "meditation sequences" as graduated practices rather than recognition-descriptions.>

[4969-4981]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE BODIES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TRIPLICATION]

<The three-body teaching (*sku gsum*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that lamaless, appearing (*bla na med par snang ba'o*)—establishes that recognition's display is self-manifesting, not requiring external teacher. The citation from *Rang Byung*: resting thigle (*smin pa thig le*) and accomplishment by three, body, three (*rdzogs pa sku dang gsum gyis 'bras bu rdzogs pa'i phyir*)—this indicates that three kayas are not sequential attainments but simultaneous recognition-aspects. Three aspects determined (*gsum tshan bzhir nges pas gsum zhes bya'o*) refers to recognition's three modes of display. The statement that also, therefore (*yang na*) essence-body's self-resonance inner, appearance-awareness empty (*chos sku'i rang gdangs nang myong ba rig stong*)—establishes that essence-body (*chos sku*) is awareness's empty inner display. Risk of triplication: treating "three bodies" as separate entities rather than aspects of single recognition.>

[4981-4989]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE BODIES CONTINUED]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: KĀYA TRINITARIANISM]

<The continuation of three-body analysis operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The description of Sambhogakaya-body's self-resonance outer, light-resonance clearly appearing, wisdom self-resonance (*longs sku'i rang gdangs 'od lnga phyir gsal ba ye shes rang gsal*)—establishes that enjoyment-body is recognition's luminous outer display. The emanation-body's self-resonance, liberating, difference-free wisdom-analysis three (*sprul sku'i rang gdangs shar grol ris med shes rab kyi rtsal dang bcas pa gsum la ltos nas gsum zhes bya'o*)—establishes that emanation-body (*sprul sku*) liberates through recognition's display. The gnad that basis by three established (*de'ang gzhi gsum gyis gzhi bcas pas dngos po la tha dad med pa'i gnad dang*)—this is definitive: recognition-basis is not established by three kayas but manifests as them. Risk of kāya trinitarianism: treating "three bodies" as ontologically distinct rather than recognition's three modes of display.>

[4989-4995]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PATH PRACTICE FRUITION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SEQUENTIALISM]

<The threefold path-practice-fruition teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for structured recognition. The teaching: (1) path, three eliminated obstructions (*lam gsum gyis gegs bsal bas 'gro lam la nye ring med pa dang*)—path eliminates obstacles directly, no distance; (2) practice, three placed in ground, no-obstructions (*tshad gsum gyis tshad la phab pas 'dra min dang chal chol med pa dang*)—practice is grounded, no blocking; (3) fruition, three exhausted fully (*'bras bu gsum gyis zad sar bskyal bas*)—fruition is exhaustion of delusion, not addition. The statement that not-abiding, not-changing (*yin min dang tshom med pas*)—this indicates that recognition never enters or changes. Risk of sequentialism: treating "path-practice-fruition" as chronological progression rather than simultaneous recognition-aspects.>

[4995-5006]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MALICIOUS TIME]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SUFFERING-REIFICATION]

<The malicious-time (*tha mal pa'i dus*) description operates from *sems-side* provisional teaching on experience-quality. The teaching: displeased not-displeased, suffering, three appearing (*dga' mi dga' btang snyom gsum mthong bas bde sdug bar ma gsum 'char ba*)—this is *upāya* describing how ordinary cognition (*sems*) experiences samsara: both pleasure and suffering appear as three modes. The teacher's experience (*bla ma'i gdams pa*) citation—dharmata's display, within that, mind-awareness (*dbyings rig chos gsum mngon par mthong bas*)—this is definitive recognition: when teacher recognizes dharmata-display, awareness-cognition are seen as non-dual. The gnad of cognition-eliminated (*chos nyid mngon sum la yid dpyod tshig gi sgro gdags su med pa'i gnad*)—establishes that intellect (*yid dpyod*) cannot harm recognition. Risk of suffering-reification: treating "three sufferings" as ontological states rather than descriptions of ordinary experience.>

[5006-5020]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MEDITATION TIME]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: STAGE-CONCRETIZATION]

<The meditation-time (*goms pa'i dus na*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that whenever thigle, body, three sees (*'od thig le sku gsum mthong bas 'khrul ba'i snang ba rang 'gags pa'i gnad*)—establishes that recognition sees through delusion's apparent display directly. The gnad that delusion's apparent display (*'khrul ba'i snang ba*) spontaneously liberates (*rang 'gags pa'i gnad*) indicates that delusion was never truly established. The practice-time teaching—therefore clear light-emptiness-pleasure three, cognition-empty-appearing (*tshad du phyin pas dus na gsal ba stong pa bde ba gsum mngon par mthong bas*)—establishes that when recognition recognizes itself, the three qualities (clear light, emptiness, pleasure) appear as one taste. The final statement—therefore dharmata-cognition-empty-appearing (*chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba'i ngo bo dbyings rig 'od gsal snang ba ste*)—definitively establishes that dharmata and cognition's empty-appearing are not separate. Risk of stage-concretization: treating "clear light, emptiness, pleasure" as sequential stages rather than simultaneous recognition-manifestations.>
