[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LIBERATION IN ONE BIRTH]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<There abiding bodhisattvas birth one only takes. Years thousand sustained. Field that food and drink mind remember merely satisfied. Then phlegm arisen and, wind arisen and, bile arisen and, gathering arisen disease not. Flowers various emanation body that offering extensively do. Bodhisattvas those color green. Horses and mounts and green. Boys and girls' forms appearance. All also mind's conceptualization not. Field that beings three types not. Six consciousnesses not. Six afflictions not. The attainment in one birth is definitive—not gradual development. Risk of temporalization: treating "one birth" as literal temporal duration rather than instantaneous recognition.>
