[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CESSATION-COGNITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: MEDITATIONISM]

<The cessation-cognition (*'das pa'i shes*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The description of cessation-cognition, empty, clear, beyond-limit's understanding-capacity and wisdom-qualities (*'das pa'i shes nyams stong gsal mtha' bral gyi rtogs tshad shes rab kyi rtsal dang bcas pa rnams te*)—this establishes that recognition (*rtogs*) is the capacity to understand emptiness, clarity, beyond-limit without adding wisdom-qualities. The statement from that, beginning and worn-out (*'di nyid thog ma bar dang mthar goms pa las*)—this indicates that recognition is not through gradual practice but primordial beginning. Risk of meditationism: treating "cessation-cognition" as meditative state to cultivate rather than recognition of what is already present.>

[5089-5108]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EXPERIENCE-QUALITIES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: PLEASURE-REIFICATION]

<The experience-qualities (*nyams*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The three qualities: (1) wisdom, pleasure, experience (*shes pa dga' bde'i nyams dang*); (2) worn-out experience (*mthar 'gyur gyi nyams dang*); (3) appearance, experience, three arising (*snang ba'i nyams dang gsum 'byung ba las*)—these are descriptions of recognition's modes, not stages to achieve. The gnad: body-speech gnad (*lus ngag gnad*)—accumulated wind, mind's object, separated (*gcun pas rlung sems bag la zha nas*)—this indicates that when wind is calmed and mind-object separation recognized, recognition rests naturally. Risk of pleasure-reification: treating "pleasure" as attainment rather than recognition's natural display.>

[5108-5119]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-NATURE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SELF-OTHER DUALISM]

<The self-nature (*rang bzhin*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Within that (*nang*) expanse-clear (*'od gsal stong pa'i ngang*)—this describes recognition's inner nature: clarity, emptiness, expanse. The statement that enjoying (*'byams pa dang*) wisdom also grasping (*shes pa bag yangs gzung 'dzin med pa'i dga' bde yangs pa khrol chags su skyes kyang zhen 'dzin spu nyag tsam yang med pa ni rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan gnad du phebs pa las byung ba'o*)—this establishes that even if pleasure arises, wisdom's grasping is never established; recognition's gnad (*bsam gtan gnad*) is already self-nature (*rang bzhin*). Risk of self-other dualism: interpreting "self-nature" as some essential entity rather than recognition's self-knowing quality.>

[5119-5130]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PLEASURE-DERIVING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: ATTAINMENT-MENTALITY]

<The pleasure-deriving (*dga' bder shar*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. From practice (*bcos ma'i bsgoms pa las*), pleasure-arising (*dga' bde byung ba ni*)—this describes that pleasure arises from practice but is provisional. The worn-out analysis (*nyams 'gyur ba shas che la rags pa 'khrab pa'am glu gar byed 'dod pa 'byung bas chags zhen du song la*)—indicates that when pleasure is worn-out (*nyams 'gyur*), the pursuit of external things (*rags pa*, *glu gar*) is seen as meaningless. The statement this is pleasure-deriving (*'di ni dga' bder shar*)—also attaining self-power's pleasure (*rang dbang thob pa'i dga' bde*), without artificiality (*zhen med*), distinguishing by intellect after meditating (*bcos nas bsgoms pa dang* shes pa'i khyad yod pa ni*)—this is *upāya* for distinguishing recognition from artificial states. Risk of attainment-mentality: treating "pleasure" as achievement rather than recognition's natural display.>

[5130-5145]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WIND-EXPERIENCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PHYSIOLOGICAL REDUCTION]

<The wind-experience (*rlung nyams*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Self-nature, wind, entering (*rang bzhin gyis rlung du phebs pa'i bsam gtan gyi khyad du shes par bya'o*)—this establishes that recognition enters into wind through self-nature's samadhi (*bsam gtan*). The worn-out experience (*mthar 'gyur gyi nyams ni*) wind experience's appearance (*rlung nyams kyi snang cha ste*)—this indicates that recognition's experience through wind is described as seeing various displays like child (*rin bu me khyer lta bu dang*). Risk of physiological reduction: treating "wind-experience" as subtle-body technique rather than recognition's capacity to manifest through subtle energy.>

[5145-5159]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CHILD-LIKE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VISUALIZATION-INTERPRETATION]

<The child-like (*lta bu*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for recognition description. The series of seeing child-like (*lta bu dang*) appearing as: fire-maker (*rin bu me khyer*), seeing (*sprin lta bu*), poison (*du ba*), peacock (*smug zil*), flowering (*zla ba shar ba*), star (*skar ma shar ba*), circling (*nam sros pa*), eye-born (*nyi ma shar ba*)—these are recognition-descriptions, not visual objects to create. The analysis: outer (*ltar phyi*), inner expanse (*nang zang thal bar snang ba lta bu dang brgyad de*), clouds arising (*'char nub dang gsal 'grib tu byung bas*), not stable (*mi brtan tshugs mi thub 'gyur 'gro bas mthar 'gyur gyi nyams zhes bya ste*)—this indicates that recognition sees outer and inner display simultaneously, with clouds (*'grib*) obscuring and clearing continuously. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "child-like displays" as meditation objects rather than recognition's natural manifestation.>

[5159-5175]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WIND-MIND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<The wind-mind (*rlung sems*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that therefore, wind mind's object (*'di dag byar yod de rlung sems dag dgos pa'i phyir ro*)—this establishes that the wind and mind (*rlung sems*) that appear have purpose (*dgos pa*) of recognition, not independent existence. The appearance's experience (*snang ba'i nyams ni*)—this indicates that appearance's experience is the context for understanding wind-mind relationship. The analysis: awareness's self-resonance, light-clear, essence (*rig pa'i rang gdangs 'od gsal chen po ste*)—this is the definitive description of recognition: self-resonance (*rang gdangs*), luminosity (*'od gsal*), essence (*chen po*). Risk of substantialism: treating "wind-mind" as subtle entities rather than recognition's display modes.>

[5175-5190]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AWARENESS-BODY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: KĀYA REIFICATION]

<The awareness-body (*rig pa sku*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The instruction that ground, resting, inward (*gnas skabs su phyir snang 'phel zhing tshad la phebs nas*)—this is *upāya* for recognition to settle into ground (*gzhi*) with inward (*nang du*) placement. The statement that self-resonance, ground, abiding (*rang gdangs gzhi thim la nang du bzlog pas phyir gsal du zad dgos te*)—this establishes that self-resonance abides in ground, abiding (*gzhi thim*), and through inward resting (*nang du bzlog*), clarity-emptiness (*gsal*) exhausts (*zad*). The final statement: spontaneous (*lhun grub ka dag gi dbyings su thim dgos pa'i phyir ro*)—definitively establishes that awareness-body and wisdom-lamp spontaneously rest in expanse. Risk of kāya reification: treating "awareness-body" as metaphysical entity rather than recognition's display mode.>

[5190-5200]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – INNER CLEAR-LIGHT]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIALIZATION]

<The inner clear-light (*nang gsal*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that inner clear-light (*nang gsal du rang 'od kyi klong na*) awareness-body (*rig pa sku*) and wisdom-lamp's (*ye shes kyi pho brang*) self-abiding, spontaneity without (*ye bzhugs lhun grub chen por 'pho 'gyur med pa'o*)—this establishes that recognition's inner clear-light is awareness-body and wisdom-lamp abiding together, without arising or cessation (*'pho 'gyur med pa*). The statement that therefore (*des na*)—in this (*'dir*), appearance's experience, main (*snang ba'i nyams gtso ba ste*)—indicates that the main teaching on appearance's experience is the inner clear-light resting. Risk of spatialization: treating "inner clear-light" as some subtle location rather than recognition's self-knowing quality.>
