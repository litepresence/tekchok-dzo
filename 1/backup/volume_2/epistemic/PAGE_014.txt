[685–704]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: GRADUALISM]

Longchenpa establishes completion (*rdzogs pa*) through the Self-Arisen (*rang shar*) tantra as the spontaneous presence of the three kayas' pure vision. The epistemic structure here is not progressive achievement but immediate recognition of what is already complete (*g.rdzogs*).

The text presents seven aspects of completion through mirror-like wisdom (*me long lta bu'i ye shes*): one complete, two complete, all complete—wisdom vision unceased clear; pure wisdom light-rays radiate; concept-free pure awareness; five light-rays unceased clear; grasping-free great self-liberation; outer inner secret dharmas clear; deed-abandoned awareness; doer-deed dharmas simultaneous complete; mind-free awareness; various vision simultaneous complete; self-vision clear pure great; delusion vision simultaneous complete; self-liberated self-vision great; other-arisen dharmas simultaneous complete; three kayas completion manner thus!

[RISK: GRADUALISM] The enumeration (seven completions) must not be read as sequential stages. The Wylie *g.rdzogs* appears repeatedly to emphasize simultaneity (*dus gcig*), not accumulation.

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY] The refrain "simultaneous complete" (*dus gcig rdzogs*) functions as epistemic closure—there is nothing to add, nothing to cultivate.
