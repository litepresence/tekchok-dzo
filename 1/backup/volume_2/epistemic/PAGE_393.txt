[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE KAYA LUMINOSITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: HIERARCHICAL TRIPARTITION]

<Essence nature compassion's self, wisdom body three light clear, sky sun dawn darkness dispels, wisdom five's marks clear, Buddha emanation immeasurable arise. Body two divisions: ground kadag and spontaneous presence non-dual rigpa, path dharmadhatu and wisdom two experience, result dharmakaya aspect two dawned benefit completion. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Dharmakaya form body clear." The three kayas are descriptions of one nature, not hierarchical levels. Risk of hierarchical tripartition: treating the three kayas as graduated stages rather than simultaneous aspects.>
