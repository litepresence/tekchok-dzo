[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SENSES AND ELEMENTS INTERACTION]
[DECLERATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REDUCTIONISM]

<Senses complete unobstructed possessing three. Elements wind's action function seed from karma wind unobstructedly lifted, all looking desiring entering, unobstructed possessing; entering existence called—four. These cause from what arose: above four wisdoms' conjunction power arose. Twelve body measure: unpurified karma child about eight years, purified sixteen years body measure, dream form like, self-characteristic not. Cause spontaneous presence's dawning manner eight seen arose. Thirteen birth abode which class: womb-born, egg-born, heat-moisture-born, miraculously-born four—miraculously-born class. The interaction of senses and elements creates the conditions for rebirth. Risk of reductionism: reducing this complex process to mere mechanical causation rather than recognizing the wisdom-display nature of all appearances.>
