[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-APPEARANCE GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SOLIPSISM]

<Self and holding's attachment object, first itself dharmadhatu, this all self self-appearance! From Jewel Garland. The self-appearance is not solipsistic projection but the ground's natural display. Risk of solipsism: interpreting "self-appearance" as individual mind's creation rather than the non-dual play of awareness.>
