[584-589] Listen—what's being described here can't be fixed or altered. You can't grab it by the face, can't mark it with labels. Like trying to catch sky in your hands! Like trying to pin down the earth under your feet! It's clear yet subtle, like fire sparks dancing behind the five lights. This is dharmakaya, the heart essence of dharmadhatu itself. And where does it abide? As awareness itself, holding the basis of everything. Don't look for it somewhere else—it's what's reading these words right now!

[590-599] The palace where it abides—that's dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space. When dharmakaya abides in the precious cavity, it's called the pure original tone of dharmata. Awareness possessing the house of light, abiding in light's display. Longchenpa calls this the primordial common basis, the expanse of awareness—this is how the five winds connect and establish meaning. Not separate from you, friend. Never was.

[600-612] Now five fires—from the Self-Arising Tantra. Listen to this carefully:
- Fire pervading all outer and inner
- Fire illuminating all outer and inner  
- Fire equalizing all outer and inner
- Fire of concept in outer and inner actions
- Fire accomplishing outer and inner actions

Where do these fires live? In your lungs, your eyes, your five limbs—that's six locations. In the gaps of your flesh, the soles of your feet, your palms. They produce warmth. Feel your hands right now—that warmth? That's it! Not philosophy, this is your own body speaking.

[613-626] Five earths now, from the same source:
- All-illuminating earth
- Unchanging vajra earth
- Precious earth from which all arise
- All-pervading earth showing appearances
- Earth of perfected accomplishment

These aren't separate things somewhere else. Together with awareness, together with lamp, together with thigle, together with wisdom, together with discriminating awareness—they abide in reliance. Everything interconnected, everything supporting everything else. Like a net of jewels reflecting each other!

[627-635] Five waters from Self-Arising:
- Unchanging water
- Peaceful, clear, pure water
- Water of extensively arising qualities
- Water without attachment
- Water of completion without grasping

These connect with all the channels. Your whole body is a mandala, friend—every part resonating with these elemental wisdoms!

Emaho! What a wonder this body of yours!
