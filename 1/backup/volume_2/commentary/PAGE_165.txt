Listen—you want to know when mind doesn't exist? Here are the five occasions: deep sleep without dreams, fainting, and the two types of absorption (entering meditative equipoise), plus the state of being without any conception at all. In all these, where is your "appearance is mind" view then? Mind is gone, yet appearances still exist! This alone refutes that view.

To sum up: believing appearance is mind is great darkness of wrong conception—you must eliminate this!

[7002-7012]
Now the third point—the crucial instruction that appearances are free from assertions and denials through self-liberation in their own place within dharmata:

The five outer elements don't exist—they're empty, naturally pure like the moon's reflection in water. No need to purify them! Inner mind's memories and thoughts naturally dissolve without trace—no need to destroy them with antidotes! Appearance and mind are spontaneously liberated from the start—no need to add acceptance or rejection! Rigpa is naked and bare—don't clothe it in elaborations!

Just release into great evenness without leaving a trace, and the five gates naturally enter as self-arisen self-liberation.

From the Sixth Treasury (Klong Drug Pa)—listen to this!

"The great self-appearance of all sentient beings—no place to search elsewhere. By their own power, self-knowing..."

This is Samantabhadra's intention self-arising in the expanse! When you let go into the vast swaying of "khral ma khrol, sang ma seng" (unfabricated, unconstructed), everything becomes the mandala of spontaneously arisen meaning.

From the same text: appearances are all like illusions, dreams, reflections—unthought great image. Whatever arises in one's stream, appearances fall like rain, not remaining in the condition-stream. One obtains irreversible samadhi!

Emaho! When appearances self-liberate as delusion, how could non-delusion not liberate?
