Listen here, you who think three kayas are something you achieve one after another! Longchenpa explains something profound about gradual recognition - not gradual attainment!

First samadhi: "resting, three bodies gradually familiarized, reality nature yoga, by this meaning becomes supreme." This isn't about improving yourself step by step! "Gradually familiarized" means awareness becomes accustomed to its own natural state. Like getting used to sitting in your own home - you don't build it, you recognize you've always been there!

"Three bodies familiarized samadhi experience, not arising simultaneously" - The key teaching: they're not different experiences to collect! They're awareness recognizing its own natural expressions in different ways. Don't grasp at dharmakaya recognition thinking you've "attained" something!

"First samadhi obtains nirmanakaya" - When awareness rests in its own nature, the emanation body manifests naturally. Not something you create, not something you achieve through effort!

Now, listen to this about "knowing time, previously unseen dharmas, without thinking mind dawns!" This is crucial: When you truly recognize rigpa, you don't need scriptures or teachings anymore. "Previously unseen dharmas" - all the wisdom you thought was hidden suddenly becomes obvious! "Without thinking mind dawns" - wisdom arises by itself, not through intellectual effort.

"Own instruction conventional words, without holding mind spread" - Longchenpa isn't dismissing teachings! He's saying they become natural expressions rather than rigid rules. "Without holding mind" - awareness doesn't cling to concepts anymore.

"For person with fortune, dharma taste mind satisfied, body six seven days, existence not felt, above ground risen, mid-space going experience, own object arises." These are the signs of natural settling, not achievements to boast about! "Body six seven days" - when awareness rests naturally, the physical body lightens. "Existence not felt" - not because you've died, but because you've transcended attachment to feeling separate!

"Above ground risen, mid-space going experience, own object arises." This describes how recognition unfolds naturally - like clouds dispersing to reveal the sky. Not something you do, but something that happens when you stop trying!

[8576–8587]
"Rigpa uncontrived placed, thus obtains own nirmanakaya." The most profound teaching in these lines! "Uncontrived placed" means awareness rests without artificial arrangement. "Thus obtains own nirmanakaya" - your own enlightenment is already present, just unrecognized!

Emaho! You've been obtaining your own nirmanakaya all along - you just didn't recognize it!
