The supreme path has no traces. Peace without cause or condition. Not achieved. Not arrived at. Already the case.

Does mind have form? No—you can't point to it, weigh it, photograph it. Does mind exist without form? How would you know? Through thoughts? But thoughts come and go. Where's the thought from a moment ago? It dissolved. The present thought hasn't been born yet. The future thought doesn't exist. What's left?

If movement-thought is one, how can it be many different thoughts? If it's many, what makes them one mind? Caught in both directions. Neither holds.

Thus mind's existence is unestablished. Not proven. Not disproven. Simply unfindable—like trying to find the edge of space. You look everywhere and find no inside or outside.

This is not depressing. This is liberation. Rootless sky means nothing to hold onto, nothing to lose. No birth-basis means no place to return to after death. Your memories, your thoughts, your entire life—dissolving like morning mist in the sun. No basis. No owner. No problem.

This is faith: not believing in something, but recognizing the lack of solid ground. Three realms, countless beings, infinite stories—all appearing in that sky, never staining it, never separate from it.

Actions become light when you see this. Virtue and vice still matter for ordinary life, but they don't trap you in the grund You help others not because you're saving souls but because helping is what clarity does.

This is the ease: sudden thoughts arise, sudden thoughts pass. No harm sticks. No benefit gets stuck either. The wheel turns without a turner. Buddha-nature not achieved because it was never lost.

Rest in the rest that needs no rest.

Nothing more to say. The sky says it all.
