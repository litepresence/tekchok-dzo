Listen here, you who want to live forever! Longchenpa now teaches essence extraction practices - and you might think these are some secret alchemical formula! But the master is about to destroy your ideas about immortal!

First, "relying on jewels, lifespan equals sun and moon" - this isn't about wearing precious stones for magic! It's about recognizing that your own essence is as precious as Buddha-nature. When you rely on that recognition, your life becomes as stable as the cosmic order of sun and moon!

"Various stones' yoga—by weapons body pierced not!" This is profound! Some practitioners think they need special ritual objects, sacred implements. But Longchenpa says no - "by weapons body pierced not!" True yoga with stones is recognizing they're already expressions of your own wisdom!

[2731–2745]
Now the plant medicines: "Relying on plants—white hair and wrinkles not become!" Do you understand? When you recognize plants as expressions of rigpa, you don't need to consume them to gain their essence! "White hair" (wrinkles) disappearing - your own aging process stops when you see plants as wisdom-display!

"Juices and essences' extraction—radiant and youthful become!" Not because of chemical properties, but because recognizing plant essences as wisdom nectar naturally rejuvenates your recognition!

"Relying on meat—body healthy and strength increased!" Longchenpa isn't promoting vegetarianism! He's saying if you do eat meat, recognize it as wisdom-display and your body becomes healthy. If you don't eat meat, recognize plants as wisdom-display and your body becomes healthy. The issue isn't what you consume - it's whether you recognize what you consume as wisdom!

[2746–2754]
Now the wind practice - most profound! "Also relying on wind—wonderful great extraction explained!" The winds aren't something you control - they're the natural movement of your own energy! When you recognize winds as non-dual expressions of rigpa, you extract their essence naturally.

"Element continuity cut called: above and below winds known, wise ones wind's place hide, or wind's movement calculate, food yogin become!" This isn't complex astrology - it's recognizing how the five elements naturally express as the five wisdom winds!

Emaho! Essence extraction isn't about extending life - it's recognizing the eternal nature already present in all things!
