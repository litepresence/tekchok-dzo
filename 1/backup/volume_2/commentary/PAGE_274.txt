Listen, you fortunate one! Now specific instructions for each bardo [12414-12440]: nature-abiding bardo—entering the nest like a bird certain the hunter won't harm; death-point bardo—clearing the unclear like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror; dharmata bardo—confidence in self-appearing like meeting a familiar person or a child entering mother's lap; samsara bardo—guiding continuation like putting a stake in a narrow crack.

First [12441-12460]: like a bird checking if the hunter has left before entering its nest, without harm, established without need to eliminate elaborations, without doubt or obstruction—you too first desire liberation from samsara, examine which method is profound, which crucial point great. Whatever Dharma you have confidence in, do not reach final limit, doubt-enter, or not arrive at goal—abandon these three.

First hearing trains mind [12461-12470]; middle thinking decides; finally meditation practices—like building a nest comfortable, like entering without fear of danger or anxiety.

These extensively taught before; here briefly summarized [12471-12495]: looking at outer appearances, seeing objects like illusory deception—baseless empty self-form only. Though various phenomena appear, they are view-meditation-conduct's mirror, dharmata's play unceasingly appearing.

Like looking at a single poppy's stem [12496-12515]—white, red, various colors—all are your own mind's empty play. Seeing thus, appearances are liberated where they appear, confusion baselessly liberated, illusion's peak only appearing, liberated from outer objects' grasping samsara.

Emaho!
