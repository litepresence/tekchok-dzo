Ah, listen well! The text now reveals rigpa—your own awareness [11075-11087]. Like a vajra chain, awareness appears as your own appearing. Through the guru's pith instructions, previously unrecognized awareness becomes recognized.

Threefold rigpa [11088-11096]: base-establishing rigpa is the natural state beyond good and bad; path-appearing rigpa goes by various names—mind-nature, unborn, co-emergent wisdom, beyond intellect, dharmakaya; lhaktong rigpa sees the vajra chain's kaya directly, free from conceptual investigation.

The character [11097-11103] is this: naturally clear, naked, spontaneously perfected—just this! The result is liberation into ka-dag's spontaneity through practicing just this. Not practicing something else, not going somewhere else—resting in what is already present!

See the signs [11104-11124]: wherever you direct attention, awareness enters there; body follows like a shadow; you can transform others' faith; conceptual fixation ceases. One who recognizes this directly dwells in the self-liberated ground. Like a garuda circling higher with each wing-beat, recognition deepens naturally.

The text quotes [11125-11135]: "Body light and spontaneously clear, touching earth without obstruction, speech's power perfected, words exhausted of elaboration, mind able to transfer consciousness." These are not fairy tales! They are the natural display when rigpa matures.

Emaho!
