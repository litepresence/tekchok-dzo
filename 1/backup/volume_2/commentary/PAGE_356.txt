Listen! Spontaneously accomplished three days abiding's end, own appearance seeing, stability obtained. Emanation also fifty days capable of benefit. End's middle: Nineteen days needed. Again gathered, twelve days needed. Four pristine awarenesses abide. Sentient beings' faculties all Buddha ground obtained. Those bardos also dream-like.

End's end, that nature emanation birth, here liberation's category explained. Those faculties' liberation manner—crucial point great, should be known.

Fourth general meaning: Existence intermediate, karma's continuation yawning gap fox inserting-like pith instruction in two: Pith instruction's indication manner briefly shown. Intermediate's own face extensively explained.

First: Existence intermediate dream-like appearance, instant unobstructed object entering, instant former self-ceasing, dissolving, not identified. Now direct appearance clear, yet wavering confused dissolving, wherever thought object, instant traveling miracle existing time. This door seeing ones, intermediate's self-appearance recognizing coming, ten directions emanation field mind-made merely, suchness truth's blessings there born, bardo without Buddha.

This's preliminary pith instruction: Now awareness eye or Brahma's aperture from light's ball focusing, shooting star running-like projecting. That time's pith instruction: Field remembering, east etc., awareness naturally projecting.

This door not seen's migrating beings usual, Dharma trained ones, illusory body grasping. Non-existence training. Pure field mind-making, liberation possible, individual's practice texts arising like. Not Dharma habituated ones, pure field aspiration praying.

Emaho! Even in the bardo there's hope! If you recognize self-appearance, you can still be liberated or reach a pure realm. The "yawning gap" is the bardo—don't fall into it unconsciously! Train now to recognize awareness, and the transition becomes liberation, not just another rebirth!
