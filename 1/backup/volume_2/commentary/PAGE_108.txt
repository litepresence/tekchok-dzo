[4790-4793] Listen here, dear practitioner! From that itself: "Self-face awareness hanging-cord, going-coming free, sky held!" From Instructions: "Within dharmadhatu hanging-cord, placed not separate!"

[4794-4801] Also wind slow rely, deed-free meaning tantra arises! Awareness hanging-cord A placed, conceptuality source exhausted, delusion base return, wisdom mother-son meet! Awareness wind free, going-coming not—awareness self-matured!

[4802-4804] Guiding: rely on body main-point, do five-six days! Then gate use, only that much! Then field seek, six-seven days!

Do you see? The hanging-cord is your own awareness! Not separate from dharmadhatu! Place the A, exhaust conceptuality, mother-son meet! This is direct!

Emaho! Hanging-cord of awareness—direct path!
