[5685-5692] Listen, dear practitioner! Through that returning, outward delusion-vision ceases, inward body and mind warmth arises. Two palms' ends pressed to earth, moving action wind returns. Through that returning, outward thigle and thigle-particles dawn, inward day-night without experience arises. Chin mind slightly raised, grasping action wind returns. Through that returning, outward body's vision sees, inward wind's movement exhausts!

[5693-5696] Dharmakaya's posture also explained in speech: Like three perfected lion's strengths, whoever is without fear, body's key point dispels three realms' fear.

[5697-5699] Also on meaning's flow distinctions: Continuous sitting key point—body sitting in dog's crouch causes dharmadhatu and rigpa to meet.

Do you see? Your body is the path! Press palms to earth, raise the chin—winds reverse, vision dawns! Do not think this is just exercise. These postures are wisdom's gateway! The body you drag around all day is actually the dharmakaya's throne!

Emaho! Reversing the winds through body postures!
