Listen, you fortunate one! In short [13401-13420]: all sentient beings sleep on birth-death, wear happiness-suffering clothes, spread grasping-fixation's bed, sleep self-grasping's sleep, dream habitual patterns' dreams. Three realms' samsara house where five poisons feast—beings too, sleeping then rising, no beginning-end or awakening time.

Thus thinking [13421-13450], now must exert effort for liberation means from samsara's dark house! Karma and afflictions controlled, samsara person; though impermanence manifest, grasping truth; fallen into birth-death river, not knowing liberation; experiencing sufferings, no weariness time.

Separated from true friends [13451-13480], no path-showing protector, wandering in ignorance darkness. Thus thinking, this difficult leisure—produce joyful mind or practice Dharma. Supreme guide, captain—meeting qualified gurus, obtaining profound supreme Dharma nectar, now with effort cross samsara ocean's further shore.

Life impermanent like sunset mountain shadow [13481-13500]; cliff tree wind-moved; cloud-lightning like grass-tip dew—quickly going to death. If now not thinking "I will die," lazily distracted, death-time no help.

Thus now as fallen from above [13501-13520], fear-terror-panic, practice essence meaning. From now I too, forest flowers, empty of people, waterfall sound, solitary pleasant cliff mountain dwelling, thinking "essenceless four times," virtue as ornament, world-built, supreme nectar obtained.

Emaho!
