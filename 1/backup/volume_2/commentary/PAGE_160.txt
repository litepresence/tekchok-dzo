This dharma-nature—grasping at it is already wrong. It's not something to hold onto. Buddhas' intention is non-dual, beyond concepts of one and two. Pure and impure are just words. The path of words and signs points at something beyond words.

The great maintaining: maintaining view-meditation beyond objects, maintaining self-settled samadhi, maintaining intention transcending mind. But maintaining doesn't mean trying hard. It means resting in what's already the case.

In that face-introduction, no grasping at methods or antidotes. Just place awareness vast and wide, primordially set, no top or bottom, no distance to cover. Self-liberated.

The old texts keep pointing: whatever place the first place is, the last goes there. So just dwell in that meaning now. Not later. Not after you finish reading. Now.

In sky of non-grasping, in sky of non-consciousness—consciousness unmoved, supreme samadhi of non-wandering. Single buddha, single grove, single nature.

Self-dwelling: not making grasping elaboration on anything that appears. Outer, inner, middle—all empty. Wide open, self-liberated, vast place. Even when you sleep, sleep in that nature and dreams become clear light.

The thunder of recognition shakes everything but leaves nothing disturbed.

Rest now. The rest is already complete.
