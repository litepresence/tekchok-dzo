Here are the actual instructions. Not philosophy—practice.

Three doors of spontaneous release: whatever appears, let it go. Don't chase, don't push away. Identify the nature: vast open gone, all self-liberated.

Body posture: cross-legged, eyes open, staring at the space in front. Cut the mind's habit of grasping and rejecting. Identify awareness's half-pure nature—already clear, already present. Let the five winds settle into space.

What appears: outer visions like smoke, mirage, rainbows—inner dharma-nature empty clear like dawn. Both are the same display, self-appearing, self-pure.

Train in three samadhis:

First: self-dwelling just-place. The power doors don't stop—sense experiences keep arising. But you don't use them, don't abandon them. Body stays natural, speech natural, mind unmoved. When objects appear, just know without moving. Clarity without thought.

Second: great thunder samadhi. Body like ordinary person, speech like ordinary speech, mind not tightened. Self-arisen awareness, not wandering anywhere.

Third: appearance expand samadhi. Body, objects, awareness—grasp all as self-appearing purity.

Then maintaining intention beyond mind has four aspects:

Mountain-just-place view: stable, unmoved like a king of mountains. Ocean-just-place intention: vast, unmoved by waves. Awareness-just-place instruction: clear, direct. Appearance-just-place method: whatever appears, let it be.

Don't doubt. The nature doesn't need to change.

Sit. Eyes soft, gazing at space. Identify clarity without moving.

That's the practice. Done.

Rest in that. No further instructions needed.
