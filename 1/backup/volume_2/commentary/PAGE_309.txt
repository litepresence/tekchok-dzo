Finding confidence in the natural state free from fabrication of the natural state, not doing any activities of the three gates; realizing all as the great emptiness without ground, free from objectifying reification and conceptual fixation, never separating from the natural state for even an instant—these come from Longchenpa's words! For such yogins, no need to examine death, cheat it, or make it clear! Transcending view and meditation, there's no benefit or harm from phenomena. Self-appearing primordial purity and spontaneous presence dawn, liberation-destinations appear as self-established, dissolving into the expanse of spontaneous primordial purity and liberating!

As said in Sun-Moon Union: "Yogins should examine thus: those with least faculties at the end continue to flow into existence and bardo, like a broken-neck fox!" The death-manner like a deer is the yogin's death-manner! Likewise like a lion, whoever like a dog, likewise dying like a child—these are the middle yogin's death-places!

[13252-13269]
Whoever has the dakini death-manner, likewise the vidyadhara death-manner, self-exhausting like a fire-mass, invisible like garuda sky—all these elements self-exhausting, invisible and ungraspable like this—these are the yogin's own activity! Through habituation to this, self-habit is obtained! Knowing these at death-time, you know the characteristics of body and mind's transference! Thus abiding, the yogin has no permanent or impermanent death-circumstances, free from all fear, free from the extreme of body attachment!

Emaho! To die without fear—what freedom!
