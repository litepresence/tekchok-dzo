You want to understand mind? Forget everything you think you know. That's the problem—you already have a mind full of concepts about mind. Can't find a clean surface in a dirty room.

The Buddha said it clearly: mind is not outside. Not inside. Not between. Not blue. Not yellow. Not any color you can point to. What does that leave? You. Looking. Confused.

Kashyapa asked the right question—how do you search for something that has no edges? The diligence of fully searching mind isn't about finding something. It's about exhausting the search itself. When you stop looking for mind, what's left? That's the question. Don't answer it intellectually. Sit with it until the question dissolves.

Now here's where it gets uncomfortable. If mind exists, where did it come from? If it doesn't exist, what is this thinking right now? You can't say "it doesn't exist" because something is clearly happening. You can't say "it exists" because you can't find it anywhere.

The arguments pile up: If mind is one with body, when body dies, mind dies. But you know there's continuity—you've been born before, you'll be born again. If mind is different from body, where does it go between lives? And why do you forget everything when you're born? If mind is one single thing, why do you have contradictory thoughts? If mind is many, why do you feel like one person?

These are not puzzles to solve. They're koans to break you open. Stop trying to answer. Let the questions burn through your conceptual cage.

The deepest cut: if there's a place for mind to return to, there must be a cause. But causes are impermanent—they arise, they pass. How could permanent awareness depend on impermanent causes?

Here's the punchline you're not going to like: you're asking the wrong question. Mind isn't something that can be found because mind isn't a thing. Mind is the looking. Mind is what's aware of these words. Mind is the space in which "mind doesn't exist" appears.

Stop searching. Rest in what's already looking.

That's not an answer. That's the end of questions.
