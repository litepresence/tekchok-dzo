Not biting at past aversion. Not hooking future aversion. Not feeding present aversion.

Not gathering past delusion's clouds. Not cutting ground with future delusion. Not raining with present delusion.

Not answering past Buddhas. Not inviting future Buddhas. Not offering to present Buddhas.

Exposing past desire itself. Cutting future desires. Removing present desires from objects.

Not holding tight past jealousy. Not gathering mind with future jealousy. Not placing mind in present jealousy.

This is the yogin realized in time-three equality, called great yogin realizing samsara-nirvana nondual!

Emaho! Rest beyond all effort and achievement!
