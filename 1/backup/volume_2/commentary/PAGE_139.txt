[5873-5880] Listen, fortunate practitioner! Having heard the Buddha's qualities, do not obtain hope and thrill—the three self-established bodies, complete confidence! Having heard also of action and afflictions' cause and effect, do not fall into delusion-vision samsara fear—confidence beyond cause and effect!

[5881-5885] Having seen nirvana's own place, do not thrill with hope of liberation—primordial purity self-complete, strong place obtained, confidence! Four arising!

[5886-5889] From the Jewel Heap Tantra: "Four great confidences of unchanging view, non-returning wisdom measure also taken!" Thus aside from the four extreme reliances, sixteen visions conclude!

Dear practitioner, these four confidences are your own mind's nature! Do not seek them outside. Do not hope for them in the future. They are complete right now, primordially present. The three kayas are not somewhere else—they are your own body, speech, and mind when recognized. Rest in this confidence!

Emaho! Four great confidences—recognize them now!
