Hear the final instructions! [12131-12155] You who have entered this path of thod rgal, you are most fortunate. In these degenerate times, such teachings are rare. Do not waste this opportunity!

[12156-12180] The buddhas of the past practiced thus and awakened. The siddhas of India and Tibet practiced thus and attained rainbow bodies. You too can achieve this if you practice with diligence and devotion.

[12181-12205] The key points are few: recognize your own nature, rest in that recognition, and let the displays arise and liberate naturally. Do not complicate things with too many concepts. The nature of mind is simple—keep it simple.

[12206-12230] When you see the lights and forms, remember—they are your own face. When you see the pure lands, remember—they are your own mind's display. When you see the buddhas, remember—they are your own wisdom manifesting. There is no other buddha than your own awareness.

[12231-12255] Some say thod rgal is only for those with high faculties. This is not entirely true. Through the lama's blessing and your own sincere practice, even those with lesser faculties can progress. Do not be discouraged by thoughts of unworthiness.

[12256-12280] The path is not long or short—it depends on your recognition. For some, liberation comes in an instant. For others, it takes months or years. Do not compare yourself to others. Practice according to your own capacity.

[12281-12305] In the end, all displays dissolve into the expanse of dharmata. The lights fade, the forms dissolve, and only the clear light remains. This is the dharmakaya—the body of truth itself. Rest there without wavering.

Emaho!
