[1991–2028]
Listen here, practitioner! From Instructions Jewel Wheel: "Enemy friend abandoned side-to, beggar like manner-by accomplish!" Like a deer in mountain solitude, go to bird-shelter rocks, forest groves, mountain peaks, snow slopes, great empty valleys. Abandon three actions and accomplish!

Body's action—trade, agriculture, sky-taking, movement, activity—abandon! Hand circumambulation etc.—abandon! Speech's expression—whatever suitable, all abandon! Mind's distraction-gathering, thought different from self's instructions—all abandon! Sacred instruction one-only, peak one-to, not distracted—accomplish!

Purpose: body relaxed, channels tight; channels relaxed, wind-mind naturally relaxed; wind-mind relaxed, thought force-ceased, non-thought samadhi stream-arises! Speech relaxed, inexpressible meaning stream-arises—not spoke, inexpressible nature abiding's purpose! Mind's mindfulness distraction-gathering abandoned, samadhi own-way arises!

From Spontaneous Liberation: faith-possessor, samsara's mind separated, guru-by offer and give! Samsara's connection all abandoned, friend abandoned, one-only abide! Four yogins: conduct-continuity, meditate-continuity, view-continuity, result-continuity!

Emaho! Solitary practice in mountain retreat!
