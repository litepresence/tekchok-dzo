Listen here, you who wait for some spectacular vision! Longchenpa explains measure-arrived awareness - and you might miss the revolutionary simplicity!

"When awareness reaches its full measure, vision arises—not as something new, but as what has always been." Do you understand this? You're looking for three kayas as some future attainment, but Longchenpa says they're your path itself! Like standing in a lake searching for water - you're missing that you're already standing in it!

"Like searching for water while standing in a lake, you miss what is under your feet!" The visions of the three bodies don't come from elsewhere. When coarse and subtle grasping ceases, dharmata exhausts itself into pure vision. This isn't gradual improvement but immediate recognition!

[4896–4905]
The three kayas dawn as path-vision, leading to pure expanse where all dharmas are exhausted—this is primordial purity itself. Your own self-vision dissolves into awareness, and from expanse of awareness, three kayas spontaneously function. This is the heart-essence that other vehicles do not even hear named—the intent of the king of vehicles!

Now, the crucial distinction: "Conventionally, you speak of direct perception—senses meeting objects, mind engaging conditions, self-awareness experiencing sensation." But yogic direct perception is different! It enters the actual point, particular correct awareness and its vision-object without duality, free from grasping and holding.

This isn't philosophy—this is your own experience when recognition dawns! When awareness directly meets its own nature, there's no separation between seer and seen, no knower and known!

[4906–4919]
Now, four aspects of nature explained in detail. First: direct perception of dharmata. When conceptual mind ceases, the senses don't stop functioning - they function as natural display of wisdom! But there's no grasping, no holding, no "I am experiencing this."

The second aspect: luminous clarity - not intellectual brightness but the natural radiance of awareness itself!

The third: unobstructed capacity - awareness flows freely without conceptually imposed limitations!

The fourth: non-conceptual self-recognition - rigpa knowing its own nature without any mediation of concepts!

Emaho! Measure-arrived vision reveals what was never hidden - your own face, finally seen directly!
