Third: completeness in awareness itself. This is the highest level—rigpa contains everything.

From the tantra: in whatever face of self-appearing awareness, all however-appearing dharmas are complete. This is the crucial point: it's not just that things are in your body or mind—they're in awareness itself, which is more fundamental than both.

The correspondences continue but at the awareness level:
- Sun and moon: method and wisdom
- Male: base, Female: path (the union)
- Planet: measure of realization
- Star: dharma
- Cloud: compassion pervading all
- Tree: path of expanding dharma-nature
- Mountain: view without change
- Rock: dharmakaya free from birth and destruction
- Root: one cause of all dharmas
- Branch: branch of awakening
- Trunk: one taste in emptiness
- Leaf: pervading dharmadhatu
- Flower: lamp of wisdom
- Fruit: three kayas self-complete
- Sound: sound of dharma-nature
- Smell: fame of buddha's speech
- Taste: taste of bliss of experience
- Touch: great concentration
- Music: complete mandala of five
- Canopy: potential of clear color
- Parasol: wisdom that protects
- Upper-canopy: great essential point of instruction
- Banner: buddha of manifest realization

Then the key verse: "All dharmas in the face of mind itself abide in the manner of primordial spontaneous completion. Therefore, dharmas of mind and entity are all merely imputed."

This is the ultimate Dzogchen view: everything is spontaneously complete in rigpa. Body, mind, world—all are imputed, mere labels, while awareness is the fundamental reality.

Now transitioning to the second major topic: extensive explanation of inner arising. This has two parts: the common division and individual natures.

First: inner arising means the five elements of essence (subtle) rely upon the five coarse elements of the body. Wind, fire, earth, water, and space—each of the five abides as five, making twenty-five limbs (components).

The definite suitability: they're definite as five based on five different functions. From the Self-Arisen: the five great arising are complete in one's own body. Five winds make wisdom potential; five fires make wisdom potency; five earths make wisdom essence; five waters make wisdom object; five spaces make wisdom abode.

So each element has its subtle dimension that supports wisdom. This is describing the subtle body—the channels, winds, and essences that are the basis for completion stage practice.
