Listen! At that time, samsara itself is called "cut from beginning and end." Thus. Like space mixed, or external appearance self-light rays dissolving into expanse, sun setting, rays gathering into themselves. Like water dissolving into water, butter into butter. From Blazing Body Relic: "Then in essence primordially pure, like sun's rays gathering, self-appearance including emanation, own essence self-dissolved, without division, without dividing becomes. Like water dissolving into water, thus butter into butter, space dissolving into space, non-dual, without certain grasping becomes." Thus.

At that time, dissolving into primordially pure internal expanse, awareness holds own place, becoming Victor Unchanging Light Buddha, perfect authority teacher Samantabhadra Pristine Awareness Spontaneously Accomplished Protector Vajra Holder. Path dharmas exhausted by obtaining result. Result dharmas, like full moon's increase and decrease, completely perfected, no going beyond that, reaching exhaustion place.

From Self-Arising: "Realized person with intelligence, dissolving into unchanging equality state. Conception-free wisdom self-dawns. In that great piled bliss ground, like unarranged jewel heap, variously arising and naturally dissolving. All Buddhas' ancestor, unchanging light, universally renowned." Thus.

From Six Expanses: "Memory-knowings, when passing beyond sorrow, expression's extremes all self-self-dissolved. Aggregates, ayatanas, elements passing beyond sorrow, all apparent existence appears as bliss field. Faculties and objects passing beyond sorrow, supreme mudra's great enjoyment self-appears. Sounds and words, at passing beyond sorrow time, transcending all appearance. View-meditation-action result, at passing beyond sorrow time, effortful memory self-dissolved. Dharmas and wisdom passing beyond sorrow, divine bodies unobservable, covered by seal."

This is the completion! Everything dissolves into its true nature—not destroyed, but recognized. Samsara was never other than nirvana. The apparent world becomes the pure field. This is not future—it's the nature right now!
