My devoted students, listen! In natural ground, though various appear, they do not exist as appearance. Gather into one all-knowing pure luminosity, self-clear self-arising wisdom, and meditate with repetition [14286-14288].

That grasping also liberates—nothing else to do. This is the essential instruction of light-appearance liberating into dharmata [14289-14290].

Looking outward, clear inward rigpa, instantaneously naked essence—this is the second crucial great essential instruction [14291-14295].

Compassion's crucial point: Though various external objects to be tamed arise as conditions, and many rigpas to tame appear radiating, do not cut the outward radiating traces, do not examine your own face, do not negate inwardly—whatever arises, leave it in its own place, directly settled, boundless naked clear rigpa, grasping that, seeing liberation place truly [14296-14302].

That very clear free rigpa, without gaps, directly settled, exhausted, pure "ka"—this and bardo awareness arising unceasing are grasped, then ka-pure compassion rigpa is known and liberated [14303-14304]. This is the third crucial great essential instruction [14305].

These three are secret heart essence amrita, extremely pure, extremely secret [14306]. Words few but meaning great, sutra-tantra few but crucial great, depth essential but importance great. To heart-sons supreme, not others, seal of essential instruction [14307-14310].

Emaho!
