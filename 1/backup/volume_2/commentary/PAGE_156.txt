View and meditation are paths, but what are they path to? Self-liberation, self-dawning, self-placing—sounds contradictory until you see the point. Making the primordially non-existent, desiring non-existence of what was never there. The union isn't joining two things. There's nothing to join. Non-dual union is just recognizing that two never existed.

Here's the most crucial teaching across all vehicles: don't desire appearance as mind. Don't hold mind as something that exists. The great basis of buddhahood isn't found by grasping at experiences. It's there when you stop looking.

Objects appearing in mind's mirror—that's all there is. Six aggregates, everything that appears, all just clear appearance of non-existence. Outer appearances, inner thoughts, all the senses—just like cataract-hairlines you think you see, like illusions, like magic tricks. They appear but have no real basis.

Here's freedom: at the very moment of appearing, you're already beyond existence and non-existence. Nothing to hold onto, nothing to push away. You can say "it's" or "it's not," "exists" or "not exists," "appears" or "empty," "deluded" or "liberated," "good" or "bad," "mind" or "other." All designations work because none of them capture anything real.

Empty first. Then designation. The emptiness is prior. The labels come later. Like dreaming—there's no dreamer doing the dreaming. Like magic—no magician behind the illusion.

Rest in that prior space. The designations keep themselves company.

Nothing to add. Nothing to subtract. Just this.
