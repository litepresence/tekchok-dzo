Fortunate child, understand! Shop, traveler, gathering-separation thinking—quickly die, certainly die, when die unknown; non-Dharma doesn't help!

Inner magic body's age [13301-13320]: mind's dawning door, happiness-suffering sequence—previous-later changing, impermanent, unstable, changing, moving. No example of dying then returning.

Think only death [13321-13340], not wandering even instant-moment. Bodhicaryavatara: "Day and night, I should only think this."

This life's mind not reversed until practicing concentration [13341-13360]—other Dharma activities aside, only this heart-thinking needed. Nothing deeper for reversing samsara!

Great master Padma [13361-13380] also stated: "Impermanence without distraction, death spur—day-night intervals always meditate." Thus though far, think samsara's formation-destruction, life impermanent; though near, think instant-moment, life impermanent.

Faculties and objects impermanent [13381-13400]—situations change; retinue and possessions impermanent—now exist, now gone; parents and relatives impermanent—gone then none; land and neighbors impermanent—much separation; time and age impermanent—appearance changes; happiness-suffering, enemy-friend impermanent—like traveler's inn.

Emaho!
