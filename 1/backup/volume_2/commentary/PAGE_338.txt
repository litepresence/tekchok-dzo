My heart-sons and daughters, listen! Cutting-birth wisdom vision: see samsara's phenomena causes [14130]. With pure, see their conditions—the afflictions' characteristics [14131]. With extremely pure, see their times and characteristics [14132]. With supremely pure, see liberation from them [14133].

Free of characteristics wisdom vision: understand the measure of your mind's changes [14134]. With pure, see mind's characteristics as merely seeing; with extremely pure, see other beings' mind changes; with supremely pure, simultaneously see time-three beings' mind changes, conceptual and non-conceptual, and thought distinctions [14135-14140].

Thus wisdom clairvoyance six, divided into four groups, makes twenty-four [14141].

The fourth, pure wisdom vision clairvoyance six: With dharmadhatu wisdom manifest clairvoyance, know future beings' birthplaces simultaneously [14143]. Mirror-like knows past [14144]. Equality knows present [14145]. Discriminating knows future beings' death and transition [14146]. All-accomplishing knows past. Non-abiding wisdom pure vision knows present beings' death and transition [14147].

The fifth, seeing dharmata unmistakenly clairvoyance six: When born, since your own purpose is complete, you engage in others' benefit activity [14149]. With clairvoyance realizing all phenomena free of elaboration, see hell realms simultaneously and can emanate countless millions there [14150-14151].

Emaho!
