Ah, precious disciple! When peaceful kaya arises [11443-11486], appearances cease and clear light's self-appearance dawns; within five samadhi days one is liberated. When wrathful kaya arises [11487-11505], from the eyes Vajrasattva's nose-thread appears, sound-light-ray three self-appear, and liberation comes in five moments!

The text quotes extensively [11506-11526]: "If both arise, without bardo one becomes Buddha." This is the measure of confidence in great ka-dag! Whether through five days or five moments, recognition is the key—not the duration but the depth of seeing.

Peaceful kaya's arising [11527-11540] connects through clear light to ka-dag, so spontaneous presence's emanation does not arise from bardo. But wrathful kaya [11541-11571]—through sound-light-ray self-appearing—allows emanation after twenty-one samadhi days.

This distinction [11572-11597] is profound: peaceful dissolves completely into ka-dag; wrathful maintains the basis for emanation. Like a lamp extinguished versus a lamp covered, the result differs though both are light.

The place [11598-11613] is the crucial point of difficult Döndam Wangchuk's great secret seal—understand this well! Not even skilled teachers should speak of it casually; recognize it as my blessing.

Emaho!
