Listen, child of good lineage! Three realms completely liberated's meaning [12601-12620]: view beyond view's object, meditation beyond meditation's mind, conduct beyond conduct's calculation, result beyond result's phenomena. Samsara expelling's fortune, dharmata manifest appearance's pure land wide, joy's source good country, nine desires' self-arising palace found.

Original protector King Unchanging Light [12621-12640] and five lights' spontaneous presence queen gathered, supreme boy light inconceivable meeting his own parents—this is called the time of joy-bliss inseparable's eternal fortune.

These extensively taught before [12641-12660]; now specifically: Sun and Moon Union states, "Listen Sugata! These are all included, obtaining one abiding thigle." What is that? Placing various, self-arrived; intentions show timing; exhaustion shows intention; stable confidence non-reversing signs.

Thus matters are included [12661-12680]: space's lamp who sees directly practices dharmadhatu; thigle's lamp who sees obtains support of all with effort; wisdom's lamp who sees realizes general and specific characteristics; water's lamp who sees obtains power over faculties.

Who matures vajra chain [12681-12700]: rigpa arrives at the capital. The result: these three kayas are self-awareness's ground. Nature-abiding bardo who matures these, all elements self-exhaust, changing without doubt.

Emaho!
