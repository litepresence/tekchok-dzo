Attend to the conduct of the yogin! [11956-11980] In thod rgal practice, conduct is crucial. Do not fall into the extreme of formal discipline, nor into the extreme of recklessness. Like a madman, be free from convention, yet like a wise one, be free from harm.

[11981-12005] Eat what comes to you, wear what is given, sleep wherever you are. Do not be attached to comfort or averse to hardship. The displays of light arise whether you are comfortable or not—recognition is what matters.

[12006-12030] Practice in solitary places—mountains, forests, charnel grounds. The disturbances of the world fade, and the inner displays become clearer. Yet do not think 'I must have solitude!' The true solitude is the nature of mind itself.

[12031-12055] Some practitioners think they must have perfect conditions—proper diet, proper place, proper time. This is attachment to method. The displays arise from your own awareness, not from external conditions. Yet do not completely abandon method either—these are skillful means.

[12056-12080] When practicing, do not force the gaze. Let the eyes rest naturally in space. The bindus will appear on their own. If you strain, you will develop headaches and eye problems. Be gentle, be natural.

[12081-12105] The duration of practice should be moderate. Too short, and you make no progress. Too long, and you exhaust yourself. Many short sessions are better than a few long ones. Find your own measure.

[12106-12130] Above all, maintain the recognition of your own nature. This is the life-force of the practice. Without this, you are merely staring into space. With this, every display becomes the path to awakening.

Emaho!
