Listen! Without that pristine awareness, there would be no benefit for sentient beings and no immeasurable Buddha dharmas at all. From Samcaya: "Without pristine awareness, virtues don't increase, enlightenment and ocean-like Buddha dharmas also become non-existent." Thus.

That too, "without pristine awareness" statements are the perspective that essence is nowhere established. "Pristine awareness exists" statements speak of spontaneously accomplished nature aspect—no contradiction, primordially pure and spontaneously accomplished non-dual.

Emaho! This is the Great Perfection view! Not existence, not non-existence—beyond both! Like space: you can't say it exists (where is it?), you can't say it doesn't exist (it's undeniable). Pristine awareness is the same—don't make it a thing, don't deny its vivid clarity!

Second, extensive explanation of nature: In primordially pure expanse's Dharmakaya state, pristine awareness spontaneously accomplished abides as subtle nature. Ground-abiding pristine awareness actually abides subtly. From its aspect, five characteristics-holding pristine awarenesses and knowable-knowing pristine awareness actually exist as ground-appearance aspect, not yet manifest.

From Thal 'gyur: "That too when mind ripens, abides as Dharmakaya's ground. Primordially pure, stains exhausted. Essence primordially without confusion. Appearance-maker unceased spontaneously accomplished." Thus.

Don't think ripening is becoming something new! It's like ice melting into water—it was always water, just temporarily solid. Your mind is always pristine awareness, just temporarily obscured. Ripening is recognition, not manufacture!

That too, in primordially pure expanse, spontaneously accomplished abiding causes essence-nature-compassion aspects to actually appear subtly. Those three ground-abiding pristine awarenesses serving as ground-appearance for other two pristine awarenesses—from that itself: "Thus in liberated mind itself, not without compassion. By ground-abiding pristine awareness, natural dynamic ground-appearance made. By characteristic-holding pristine awareness, purified by conditions, ripening made. By knowing and knowable pristine awareness, to faithful ones, siddhi given." Thus.

The manner of those three ground-abiding ones making ground-appearance: Essence making three kayas' ground-appearance, yet three kayas different-appearance aspect not established. Nature making five lights' ground-appearance, yet colors self-characteristics not established.

This is subtle! The three kayas appear different, yet their ground is the same. The five lights appear different colors, yet they're not truly separate. Like different notes from one flute—distinct, yet from one source!
