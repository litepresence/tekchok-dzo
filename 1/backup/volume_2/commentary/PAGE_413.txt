Listen to this dedication! "Possessing a garland of lightning of the great cloud of excellent explanation, the rain of nectar of words and meaning falls from the path of the mind's sky." Longchenpa is saying: this text is like a storm of blessings!

The excellent explanation (*legs bshad*) is the great cloud (*sprin chen*). The hearing (*thos pa*) is the lightning (*glog*) that illuminates. From the sky of mind (*yid mkha'*), the rain of nectar (*bdud rtsi'i char*) falls. This fulfills the hopes of all beings without exception, increases the merit and harvest, and with the prosperity of the Victorious Ones, fills all beings with satisfaction, dispelling the poverty of existence and peace.

This is how you close a Dharma text—not with "The End" but with "May all benefit!" Every word written, every page composed, becomes an offering to all beings. This is the bodhisattva vow in action.

[17231-17238]
The elements of all directions, as long as embodied beings remain—may this treasury of holy Dharma remain and accomplish limitless benefit and happiness! May the world and all beings, blissful and prosperous like the god realms, all abide on the path of liberation and simultaneously attain Buddhahood!

These aren't empty wishes. When a master like Longchenpa dedicates merit, it has power. He's not just hoping—he's establishing a connection, a field of merit that extends through time and space to benefit beings far into the future. Including you, right now, reading this.

[17239-17242]
May all sentient beings, completely victorious over existence, without effort attain nirvana! May samsara be emptied and the grove of peace expand! May they become Dharma Kings of spontaneously accomplished twofold benefit!

The twofold benefit (*don gnyis*) is benefit for self and benefit for others. This is the mark of a Buddha—not just personal liberation, but the capacity to liberate all beings. And Longchenpa dedicates his work toward this end for all.

[17243-17246]
Through this supreme virtue, the source of benefit and happiness, may the Buddha's teachings spread and expand! May the glory of the jewel of limitless qualities blaze! May the holy Dharma of luminosity-heart essence expand!

He's dedicating to the preservation and spread of the teachings. Not just his own text, but the entire Dharma. This is vast mind—beyond personal achievement, beyond sectarian concerns, toward the welfare of all beings through the preservation of the teachings.

[17247-17250]
Leading limitless beings to the ground of near-peace with limitless life, beautified by forests, lakes, islands, flower-medicine realms everywhere, possessing eyes, clairvoyance, and concentration that discover unprecedented Dharma treasures, may they be filled with the fame and praise, the sound of drums, worshipped by Brahma and others, kinnaras!

This is pure land imagery—the vision of a world transformed by Dharma. But it's not just imagination; it's the result of practice. When you cultivate virtue, when you dedicate merit, you create the causes for such a world to manifest. This is how reality is shaped—through intention, through dedication, through the power of virtue.

[17251-17258]
Transcending the path of the thousand-light-ray doer, infinitely vast, praised by the Victorious Ones as the ornament of the world, the supreme medicinal eye—through whatever auspiciousness beautifies all beings, falling like rain as praise-songs and flowers, may this supreme Dharma system fill the realms with an ocean of auspiciousness!

May my activity, establishing an ocean of bliss-joy completely, be like that, maturing the ocean of beings dwelling in hundreds of oceans, pleasing them all!

Longchenpa is dedicating his merit to span countless realms, countless eons, countless beings. This isn't modesty—this is the natural expression of realized mind. When you realize the nature of reality, your benefit for beings becomes as vast as space itself.

[17259-17262]
Those whose wisdom and concentration are as vast as the sky-expanse, whose thought and conduct are vast oceans, immeasurable, vast in benefiting others, whose luminosity sun-moon appearance is vast, whose activities are vast, whose unchanging dharma-nature appearance enters the vast dharmadhatu—may they all!

This is the final dedication. Vastness upon vastness. The realized mind isn't small, isn't limited, isn't constrained by ordinary conceptions. It's as vast as space, as deep as the ocean, as luminous as the sun and moon.

This is what you've been reading. This is what Longchenpa offers. Don't let it be just words—let it transform your mind into this same vastness!
