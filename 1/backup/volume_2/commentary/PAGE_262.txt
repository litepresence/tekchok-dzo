Listen, fortunate one! The text now explains relics extensively [11437-11476]—the common distinctions, specific distinctions, and the difference between relics and ringsel.

Generally, all beings are buddhas from the beginning [11477-11505]—the five elements in their nature, the five kayas' essence. Unmatured relics exist potentially; through practice they mature into five types: shariram (bone essence), chariram (flesh), churiram (blood), beriram (body), nyariram (karma). These are not ordinary remains—they are wisdom essence manifesting!

From the Blazing Relics Tantra [11506-11536]: "The supreme being who passes beyond sorrow—relics of all buddhas arise. From distinctions of buddha families, relics arise five by five." This is your potential made manifest!

The specific distinctions [11537-11571] explain colors: blue-black Vajra family, white Buddha family, yellow Ratna, red Padma, green Karma. These indicate the pure realm of liberation—Vajrasattva's realm for blue, Vairochana's for white, and so forth.

Shariram [11572-11586] is the size of a mustard seed, white and radiant—like a tiny sun containing infinite light. This is bone's essence purified, appearing when the channels' wind has matured the dharmakaya nature.

Emaho!
