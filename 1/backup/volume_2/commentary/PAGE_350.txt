You who seek liberation, listen! From Union of Sun and Moon: "Twenty-one faculties' individual stability obtained also exists. Those not understanding their own knowledge and without lama's teaching become bewildered at that appearance—surprise, fear, confusion, terror, losing perception, and so forth—taking samsara's near appropriation again. Thus twenty-one faculties' individual delusion also exists" [14466-14474].

Thus three faculties: Supreme liberate in three instants. Medium may obtain stability in five days [14475-14477]. Twenty-one instants obtain stability. Finals are born in natural nirmanakaya realm, breathing out without bardo, becoming Buddha [14478-14479].

Here three: twenty-one faculties' delusion manner, liberation manner, and reversing delusion about difference manner [14480-14483].

First: Those who haven't seen this teaching's gate, though seen, influenced by cowardice, laziness, and distraction—final of finals not obtaining power over dharmata bardo's self-display, greatly bewildered, not finding certainty, greatly appearing, wondering what lineage they come from, not recognizing face so frightened, not practicing even an instant directly, wondering if this is delusion or faculties' delusion, perception mistaken, and so on—taking samsara's near appropriation again, wandering through bardo, twenty-one faculties' delusion exists [14484-14494].

Emaho!
