My heart-sons and daughters, understand! Thus abiding in own face, knowing thus, afflictions cannot arise in rigpa. Liberated from samsara's karmic ripening. Since afflictions cannot abide in rigpa's own face, secret rigpa dharmata—existence, non-existence, permanence, nihilism, thing and emptiness aspects do not fall anywhere. Outer objects and subjects, inner various thoughts holding as different, secret rigpa itself grasping also none—knowing own face [14370-14334].

Third, completion face knowing crucial point: Rigpa reaching spontaneous accomplishment precious jewel's own place, abiding in nondual original purity and spontaneous accomplishment, knowing that [14380-14381].

All samsara's phenomena purified at that time, so previous delusion not experienced is decided. Now impossible to delude, obtaining body of no-return, rigpa itself no-return place [14382-14384].

Samsara's deluded appearance, nirvana's pure appearance, when both dissolve into that dharmadhatu, existence and non-existence, permanence and nihilism not established anywhere, so samsara-nirvana equal, gone to ground liberation—at that time of spontaneous accomplishment dissolving, know thus [14384].

This is rigpa own face's great crucial point [14385].

Second, method essential instruction has two: previous essential instruction and this time's sharp-dull difference [14386-14387].

Emaho!
