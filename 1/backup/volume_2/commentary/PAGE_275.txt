Ah, listen with full attention! Looking at the perceiver [12516-12535]: moving-empty beyond partiality, har-sang without clarity, self-clear recognizing—great dharmata beyond arising-abiding-ceasing is recognized. Grasping without support, sky-like nature, self-liberated vastness.

Without support, ye-re! Spontaneous, zangthal! Without truth, bun-ne! Beyond root, khre-se! In great dharmata's equal nature, smile with joy, gle-ge! Resting thus, inner grasping mind's stake is extracted—this has purpose!

When object-mind are recognized baseless rootless [12536-12560]: secret self-awareness free from grasping-fixation elaboration goes. Rigpa self-clear ka-dag great, guru's instruction introduces, four lamps cause space-awareness non-separation, clear light nature meditating.

Outer space's appearing self-radiance's five lights clear [12561-12580]—like mirror's reflections, appearing externally but essence internally dwelling. Appearance-emptiness like moon in water—know thus! Do not attachment-grasp to appearances.

Looking at outer appearance's clear light [12581-12600]: inner rigpa's clear light is clear back. Rigpa free from meditation-concept's antidote, vast view of natural clarity; resting in natural presence's clear meditation; clear light conduct without accepting-rejecting; ka-dag self-clear result found.

Without abandoning confused appearance, it is abandoned; without blocking confused thought, it ceases; without training duality, it is purified; faults without abandoning are pure from ka; qualities without seeking are spontaneously accomplished.

Emaho!
