In the lower direction is the pure land called Immovable, where the Bhagavan Mahakashyapa exists. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—from him you have the empowerment called Self-Aware Appearance! Take that empowerment and proceed into the self-appearing space of dharmata! In the center of the ten directions is the great charnel ground called Blazing Fire Mountain—a place of utter horror, terrifying and dreadful, frightening and hair-raising! There is the Bhagavan Padma Wang, Lord of Power! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—from him you have the empowerment called Rigpa Self-Abiding! Take that empowerment and proceed without fear, without terror, without fright into the self-appearing space of dharmata!

Kye ma! Bodhisattva who has passed away, listen! In the western world-system is the Bhagavan Amitabha's pure land called Inconceivable! Son of noble family, proceed there with the lion's posture! Look with the elephant's gaze! In the grove called Abhirati is the bodhisattva called Arya Akashagarbha, the Lion's Roar—terrifying and frightening! Don't be afraid, proceed there! Beyond the passed-away one, outside, is the Buddha Dipaṃkara Bhadra, adorned with the mound of light rays. You will see him! Son of noble family, at the time of seeing him, he teaches the Dharma that liberates through form—the Sambhogakaya with marks and signs, inseparable, he will completely pass into parinirvana!

Kye ma! Bodhisattva who has passed away, listen! Son of noble family, beyond the great Dharma-display of light-mind of the deceased, there exists the self-rigpa-appearance inconceivable!
