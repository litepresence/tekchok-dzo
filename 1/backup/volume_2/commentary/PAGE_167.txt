However appearances appear, they dawn as unceasing display—naturally arisen meaning's mandala! Eating and drinking become dharmata's approach. Sleeping and sitting become bodhi's practice. Activities become deity's abiding meditation. Stretching and bending become mandala practice. The three thousand worlds become spontaneously accomplished mandala.

Look at this!
- Rain falling by itself—splashing, sprinkling
- Roads and paths—the great natural line
- Footprints—colored sand of the mandala
- Movements—nature of mudra
- Speech—vajra recitation
- Thoughts—creation stage wheels
- Whatever appears—deity's display
- Your own body—the empowerment vase
- Descent—the continuous samaya
- Clear knowing—self-dawn instruction

Birth and death become dharmata's familiarity. The six collections' object-appearances self-arise as realization!

From the Pearl Garland—marvel at this!

"Emaho! If appearances thus deluded also self-liberate, how could non-deluded not liberate? Whatever speech and activities—conduct of empty-aware-clear. Good and bad thoughts—meditation of river's great depths. Wrong view and right desire—yogin's view without distinction. All hope and doubt holding—uncontrived spontaneous result."

The Great Seal—by eating and drinking, approach. By sleeping and sitting, practice. Activities are deity abiding. Stretching and bending are mandala practice. The three thousand worlds are all mandalas where rain and steam sprinkle down.

Paths seen by beings are the great line. Footprints are colored sand dust. Those wanting to walk—posture itself! Moving limbs are mudra. However spoken—mantra words. Thoughts are creation stage. Mind movements are offerings. Form-appearances are deity body. Great sound speech is music. Your own body is the vase. Hair is the year's leaves, ornaments beautiful. Blood and water-essence waters are entrusted with essence substances. Self-appearing empowerments are given—perfect in un-transferred! Those wanting to transcend—samaya itself. Those wanting to protect—binding itself. Those wanting liberation—deviation! Those wanting non-existence—Supreme Sage!

All views are mudra's scope. Attachment to them is deviation experience. Clear knowing awareness is the instruction. Object and mind as two—field for that. Birth, aging, sickness, death—familiarity key. Six collections unceasing—realization!
