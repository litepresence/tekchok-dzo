Those abiding in meaning like sky rigpa—dharma-exhausted, appearance and body water-moon-like, unobstructed by walls and fences, obtain immeasurable eyes and superknowledges. Seeing noble truth, liberated from further existence.

Primordial purity ground liberation—four elements' particles powerless, burned by wisdom fire, like mist dissolving, showing body's miracle in sky. If meaningful, wisdom fire burns particles, blessing as relics and ringsels. If not meaningful, self-dissolves into peace, rigpa abides in dharmakaya expanse, form body with activities, benefiting beings until samsara not empty.

From Copper Letters and Signs Measures: "Appearance four measures not reached, yet stone-enclosed not appearing, primordial ground liberation exists."

Thus meaning clearly explained in khregs chod liberation manner, from Heap of Jewels Tantra: "Untransferred self-place placed mind—all these words too, no one trained, each mind understands appearing. This itself understood by own mind..."

[8038-8049]
"...Inconceivable unthought, all appearances self-pure, all uncontrived spontaneous, become empty-luminous great rigpa's kind. Earth water fire wind four elements, each power not appearing, like mist dissolve for skilled. Delusion's various graspings, however thought unborn, grasping-grasped parts self-ceased, whatever not appearing self-exhausted. Clear-illuminator self-experienced, embodied all thus gone, disembodied needless to mention."

Emaho! Liberation into the natural state!
