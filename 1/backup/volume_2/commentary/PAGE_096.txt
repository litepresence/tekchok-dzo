Listen here, you who think wisdom is something you can find! Longchenpa destroys your worldly concept with just one phrase: "Later also meeting this difficult, world behind throwing away!" 

What does this mean? The master is saying: When you encounter difficulties in Dzogchen practice, the tendency is to look for some exotic solution, some profound technique from another tradition! But Longchenpa laughs at this - "world behind throwing away" means abandoning ordinary conceptual frameworks entirely!

Don't you see? When practice becomes difficult, your mind immediately starts planning: "Maybe I need a different empowerment, maybe I need special mantra, maybe I need secret technique from ancient text." This is exactly what Longchenpa calls "throwing away the world" - abandoning this very world for some other world!

Now the crucial teaching: "Rigpa natural settling actually introduced, vajra hanging-cord's vision seeing called!" What is "natural settling"? It's when awareness simply rests in its own nature, without any effort to maintain or improve it. Like water settling when you stop stirring - clarity happens by itself!

The "vajra hanging-cord" vision - this is profound! When awareness naturally settles, it sees through subtle channels directly. Not some visualization you create, not some technique you practice - it's the natural capacity of rigpa when not disturbed by conceptual mind.

"Also actually cannot be shown, rigpa said common ones expressed but foremost not arrived" - Oh, how this shatters your spiritual materialism! You think realization is something special that only advanced practitioners attain? Longchenpa says NO - rigpa has been expressed to everyone, but "foremost" (most realized) haven't recognized it because they're looking for something else!

"Like Vajra Seat not seeing telling its history, like blind color explaining to others" - This is devastatingly precise! A blind person trying to explain colors reveals their complete misunderstanding. But isn't this exactly what you do when you talk about enlightenment without having recognized it yourself?

Listen to this about thoughts! "Sometimes unborn empty rigpa thought, sometimes various dawns thought" - Longchenpa is describing how conceptual mind continues even after recognition! It creates "unborn empty" thoughts and "various dawns" experiences - all still conceptual overlay.

"These two word instruction nicely explained essence empty sky-like, dawning manner not ceasing, like mirror's reflection explained, but now existing-existing!" - The danger here is subtle: You might think "sky-like" means some experience, "mirror reflection" means some realization. Longchenpa says these are just explanations - but awareness itself "now existing" is beyond all concepts!

Do you understand? Natural settling isn't an achievement - it's the cessation of seeking. Vajra vision isn't a technique - it's the natural clarity when seeking stops. Rigpa isn't something to be expressed - it's what's already present, unrecognized!

Emaho! Stop explaining Dzogchen and just let awareness settle!
