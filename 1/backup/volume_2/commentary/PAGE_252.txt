Ah, precious one, listen well! Here we come to the essence of the path thigle—six aspects that illuminate the nature of mind like the sun dispelling darkness [10855-10860].

The root text [10855] speaks of the "unfabricated, all-pervading dharmata thigle." You must understand: this is not something you create through effort, like a potter shaping clay. It is already present, like the sky that needs no painting to be blue! When you rest without fabrication, this thigle naturally dawns.

Line 10856 describes Samantabhadra's thigle that appears without good or bad, large or small. Think of a clear mirror—it reflects a beautiful face or an ugly one without preference or judgment. Your awareness is exactly like this! It does not discriminate between pure and impure appearances; all are equally the play of dharmata.

The dharmadhatu thigle of line 10857 is clarity without inside or outside. Have you ever looked at the ocean on a calm day? The water and sky meet without a clear boundary. So it is with the dharmadhatu—where is the division between your mind and the universe? There is none!

Line 10858 speaks of the thigle of pure dharmadhatu, free from extremes and partiality. Like a bird flying through the sky leaving no trace, the pure dharmadhatu leaves no mark of going or staying, coming or going. It is beyond all conceptual pigeonholes!

The great wisdom thigle of line 10860—"unfabricated from the beginning, appearing directly unobscured by any affliction"—this is your true face! Afflictions are like clouds in the sky; they never truly touch or taint the sky's nature. Similarly, anger, desire, and ignorance never truly obscure your innate wisdom.

Then the text turns to the signs of maturation. Line 10877 speaks of external signs: "From the burning relics, the thigle becomes a sphere." When a realized master passes, sometimes the body transforms into light, leaving only relics—round, like bindus. This is not magic, you understand? It is the natural result of having recognized and stabilized the nature of mind.

Line 10882 says: "All these are signs of your own experience." Do not look outside for confirmation! When you recognize rigpa, you know it yourself, like tasting honey—you don't need someone else to tell you it is sweet.

The text warns [10884-10891]: "The mind does not engage with others even for an instant." This does not mean becoming cold or indifferent! It means your mind is so content in its own nature that it does not grasp at external distractions. Like a mountain hermit who has found inner peace, you are complete within yourself.

The final lines [10892-10899] promise: even in two years, if you know the measure of rigpa, you will dwell inseparable from the self-appearance of dharmadhatu and awareness. This is not mere philosophy! It is the living experience of ground, path, and fruition as one.

Emaho!
