Continuing with the third body—this is crucial, so listen closely! "Empty circle self-appearance as agent"—this means the mandala-circle is empty yet appears, and this appearance is self-arising, performing its own function without anyone doing it. The teaching is completely pure of observed objects. Not established by time, therefore great equal great expansive!

Do you see? This is not a creation by some deity. The mandala appears spontaneously from the nature of reality itself. Like a rainbow appearing in the sky—no one paints it, yet it's vividly there. This is how Sambhogakaya manifests: self-arising, self-sustaining, without any external cause or creator!

[16470-16477]
Now the Nirmanakaya of Dharmakaya—the Emanation Body emerging from the Body of Reality! Field and realm, emptiness without break or limit. Abiding as the great self-radiance of the clear depth of the ground-appearance of all abodes. Samadhi without cessation, self-clear. Circle without hierarchy, pure appearance-manifestation. Teaching unaltered nature. Time appearing as the essence itself.

This is describing how the Buddha appears in the world—not by leaving some heaven and traveling here, but as the spontaneous display of the ground itself. Like the sun's rays naturally illuminating everything without the sun deciding to shine. The Nirmanakaya is not a downgrade from Dharmakaya—it's Dharmakaya's own self-expression!

[16477-16487]
These are all designated from the aspect of Dharmakaya as primordially pure self-abiding. From Ratnakuta (the Heap of Jewels):
"By Dharmakaya self-pure of grasping, in the measureless pure of elaboration, to the appearance-circle not different from itself, by signless speech, words without elaboration, released self-dissolved non-abiding, emerge from mind. Without speaking, without spoken, in the state of great equality demonstrated."

This verse is profound! It describes how teaching occurs without a teacher, how words appear without being spoken, how manifestation happens without leaving the nature. Don't think of three bodies as three different things—it's one awareness showing three faces like a jewel reflecting differently in different lights!

[16488-16510]
These too are merely designated aspects—in reality, nowhere established, abiding as great completely perfect free from extremes. Again from that same source:
"This abode is called 'this'—the object with characteristics famous as names. Since appearance-form nowhere manifests, from the emptiness of non-existence, dharmodaya, in the great secret self-expanse, primordially abiding, without apprehending, as the mode of abiding, great play primordially emerged. In this, no one abides. By nothing made as abode. In this, no perfections. Free from abiding and coming. Thus the place of great primordial emptiness. From non-existence, the expanse-grove. In this, neither outside nor inside. Looking above and below—nothing. In directions and intermediate points—nothing. In this, not the slightest thing to grasp."

Emaho! What liberation! Longchenpa is demolishing every place you might try to stand. No abode, no inside or outside, no directions, nothing to grasp. This isn't nihilism—it's the freedom of recognizing that the nature transcends all location and limitation. You're not "in" the nature—the nature is what you are!

[16510-16514]
Fourth: Extensive explanation of enumerations. From the five—body, speech, mind, qualities, activity—Dharmakaya's body: empty, clear, signless. Speech: beyond expression, sound, words. Mind: free from memory, thought, elaboration.

Don't compartmentalize! These are not separate departments in a cosmic bureaucracy. Body is emptiness-clarity, speech is spontaneous expression, mind is unobstructed awareness—all three are your own nature, right now, if you would just stop looking elsewhere!
