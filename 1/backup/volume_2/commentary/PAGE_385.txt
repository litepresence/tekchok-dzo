Listen to these "great perfections"! Unchanging completely expansive great perfection. Subtle, difficult to grasp, great perfection. Vast, without seeing, great perfection. Round, without shape, great perfection. Shaking, without breath, great perfection. Clear, black color, great perfection. Non-existent, soft, great perfection. Appearing, difficult to examine, great perfection. Empty, appearing, great perfection. One, without break, great perfection. Appearing like two, completely perfect great perfection. Beautiful, without ornament, great perfection. Full, empty, great perfection. Ripened, not completed, great perfection. Body-like appearance, without coming-going, great perfection.

Emaho! What is Longchenpa doing? He's exploding all your concepts! Each pair of opposites—both are "great perfection." Not one or the other—both, neither, beyond! This is not philosophy—this is a direct pointing to the nature that can't be pinned down by any concept!

That too, expanse and pristine awareness appearing as two, in Dharmakaya's state, appearing as ground-appearance to clear depth body. Second, extensive explanation of aspects has two: Essence, measured as empty—primordially pure, sky-like, nowhere established, free from extremes, great perfection, Dharmakaya's vast expanse. Aspects, measured as clear—in Dharmakaya expanse' depths, internally clear spontaneously accomplished pristine awareness, inexhaustible body-speech-mind ornament wheel's source, abiding as clear depth in subtle aspect.

From that side, divided: Pristine awareness mandala of five pristine awarenesses, primordially clear. Nothing above that pristine awareness, so high depth. Pristine awareness palace spontaneously accomplished, so vast, etc. From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Jewel-arranged mandala, unwritten, clear. Pristine awareness stable mountain king, unconstructed, high depth. Pristine awareness expansive palace, unmade, vast. Pristine awareness vast expanse ocean, unmuddied, self-radiance. Pristine awareness clear sun, unmade, without rising-setting. Emptiness expansive plain, unarranged, even. Pristine awareness unchanging path, untrained, without near-far. Awareness unchanging horse, running, without cessation. Awareness objectless river, without interruption."

Don't take these literally! The "palace," "mountain," "ocean" are metaphors for aspects of awareness. Unmade, untrained, unwritten—your nature is not a construction. It's naturally perfect, naturally clear, naturally expansive!
