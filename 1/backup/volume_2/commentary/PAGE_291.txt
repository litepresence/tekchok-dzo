Listen, you fortunate one! Wind upward going, three dum-bu [14381-14400]: outward first dum-bu white om contemplated, thrown; second red ah with thrown; last whatever not contemplated, thrown. Returning three all hum contemplated, that awareness blue hum own rigpa drawn.

Speech also hum [14401-14420] reciting, drawn to gap under foot, strongly drawn. That time own body-speech-mind three strengthened, drawn inside gap, his wind warm completely inside comes out—certain.

That time other person's eyes hri-gi comes [14421-14440]; then body also har rising able comes. Thus arisen, eye's thusness dharmata direct appearance shown; eyes arisen, thigle empty space lamp thumb-index showing, like placed, clear light self-existing this is; from body exiting time, dharmata bardo self-equipped dawning, self-appearance this is, not other—recognize self.

Three times struck [14441-14460], appearance seen or instruction heard, saying, voice emerging good; sign arisen also succeeded. Dharmata bardo non-conceptual samadhi obtained, becoming Buddha certain.

Sun-Moon Union [14461-14480]: "If benefiting others, that compassion mind-grasping, three doors door-opened, breath blocked, inhaled, thrown; three syllables entering, body-speech-mind strengthened, breath with skilled do. Thus repeatedly done, that person's appearance like this: if body's strength obtained, instructions strike; awareness clear, intention equally placed; faculties' doors self-near, eye's thusness look; equally abiding mind arisen, non-conceptual samadhi obtained."

This instruction [14481-14500] is crucial provision-striking, great perfection's crucial vital point. Thus faculties gathered, again death reversed by crucial, now not dead effort crucial!

Emaho!
