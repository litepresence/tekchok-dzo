Listen here, you who try to measure your spiritual progress! Longchenpa explains why this is impossible - and you'll be relieved!

"Knowledge-experience is intellect, changing, measure not possible—conceived conventional aspects, memory-making, different, near-side conceptuality gathered." Do you understand? Ordinary knowledge builds concepts, stores memories, creates categories. But Longchenpa says "measure not possible" - like trying to measure clouds with a ruler!

"If you measure this, like a bird hiding in clouds—you cannot!" How perfect! The bird is awareness itself, and clouds are concepts trying to contain it. You can't measure the sky!

"No time for realizing meaning; seeing does not directly arrive." When you stop intellectualizing and just look directly, meaning arrives immediately - not through some gradual process!

[5131–5146]
"This is vision experience—seeing five wisdoms' color vision, transcending samsara's karmic end, grasped as object." These aren't achievements to collect! They're natural displays of awareness recognizing its own wisdom-nature!

"Seeing dhatu's vision, above that grasping conceptuality's portion missing, empty severed, grasping wrong, transcending samsara's three-fourths." Listen carefully! The vision isn't something you attain - it's awareness recognizing the natural purity of phenomena!

"Conceptuality's base-heap self-purified, grasping portion's half appearance self-characterized grasping wrong—this is called person and dharmas selflessness realization!" When conceptual thinking completely self-purifies, what remains is direct recognition without any grasping at all!

[5147–5170]
"In short, vision experiences are five wisdoms' color vision and dhatu vision gathered as two." The five wisdom colors aren't separate attainments - they're how rigpa naturally displays itself! Blue like space, yellow like earth, red like fire, white like water, green like wind - not elements to master but natural expressions of wisdom!

"First: joined with liberation manner from samsara's bondage—vision also upward-standing, rising side, boat-cut, pieces, cloth vision." These aren't techniques but descriptions of how recognition naturally manifests!

Emaho! Vision transcending karmic bondage - not through achievement but through recognition of what has always been free!
