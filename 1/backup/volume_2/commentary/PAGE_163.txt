The great method of appearance is just-place awareness. Appearances great, yet not basis of all. The five elements appear like Buddha paths. The five greats—mother herself clear as appearance. Place in not-wandering nature, grasping non-existent.

Three vital points of dharmata's wheel in sky-equal space-clarity:

First: Instruction placing mind itself, action separate from dharmata's nature—realized not by action but by non-action place. Three doors self-settled vast.

Second: Instruction concepts dawning as primordial wisdom—dharmata's self-direct introduction.

Third: Instruction appearances non-existent, refute-establish—dharmata's liberation from self-place.

That nature separate from action is not realized by action. Realized by non-action. Place the three doors self-settled vast.

From the Great Garuda: if samsara and nirvana are action-action itself separate, what other doing exists from this great perfection?

Face-introduce appearance as mind's play. Play basis-non-existent clear appearance. Face-introduce as delusion if grasping clear appearance. Face-introduce self-clear non-existent appearance by non-grasping—outer object appearance, mind other non-established, empty object of samsara birth.

Face-introduce appearance-grasping mind basis-non-existent. Face-introduce basis-non-existent empty self-course. Face-introduce self-course track-non-existent primordially liberated—circle-maker self-mind liberated basis-non-existent, echoing in three realms name-non-existent dharmata.

Nature dharma-nature peace: perception object non-existent. Entity non-existent itself: appearance self-search self-appearance. Self meaning dharma-nature: appearance mind separate. Look self object, not making send-gather.

Rest there. The rest needs no further words.
