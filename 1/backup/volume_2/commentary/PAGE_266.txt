Listen well! Earth-shaking's essence [11721-11725]—the container world's foundation, support of sentient beings. Cause: the passing being's power moving wind. Distinctions: great shaking, greater shaking, completely great shaking, and universal great shaking—four types.

The result [11726-11747]: ordinary beings achieve bodhisattva grounds and so forth. When breath separates, if it shakes in the center, shravaka's ground of white appearance attained, then abiding in seven trainings. This includes eight lower grounds: rigs, eighth, seeing, thinning, done knowing, shravaka, pratyekabuddha.

Three days after death [11748-11758], if east shakes—pratyekabuddha ground. Six days, south—bodhisattva grounds: joy, stainless, light-maker, light-radiating, difficult to purify, manifest, far-going, immovable, excellent intelligence, dharma cloud—these ten cause grounds plus universal light result ground, eleven total.

Nine days [11759-11763], upward shaking—vidyadhara ground: maturation ground, life-control ground, great seal ground, spontaneously accomplished ground—four. These are not ordinary places! They are recognition's stages made manifest.

The text warns [11764-11793]: merely reaching these grounds quickly is insufficient; one must complete their full training. Like a traveler who reaches a city's gate but must still enter and explore, reaching is not completion.

Emaho!
