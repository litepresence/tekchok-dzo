[1108-1113] Individual individuals, mind, wisdom, kunzhi—showing kunzhi as dharmakaya and so forth, though shown in many ways, the nature of Great Completion does not appear infinitely to all through the path, but only to some capable ones.

[1114-1137] From Self-Arising: knowing all languages, showing that in whichever language. Gathering suitable with suitability—some through words, some through dependent arising, some through aspiration and application, some through generation, some through both, some through five enlightenments, some through three samadhis, some showing expanse and wisdom. Great Completion meaning is without contradiction place, appearing to some persons with karma. Thus showing: some showing rigpa as empty, some showing absence-of-rigpa as empty, some showing rigpa-not as inert, some showing rigpa alone, some showing kunzhi as dharmakaya, some showing without virtue or non-virtue, some showing possessing meditation, some showing without meditation. Thus by emanation-kaya that shows.

[1138-1148] The unsurpassable secret mantra meaning was not spoken to some; what was not spoken does not become spoken. Though on occasion it becomes spoken, arhats, solitary realizers, and sutras—within which the name 'lower vehicle' does not exist—become proclaimers of unsurpassable vehicle. Therefore hidden from others of inferior mind, that person possessing those is considered emanation-kaya of performing actions.

[1149-1157] Although Great Completion may arise, from up to secretmost cycle of instructions of mind-vast and this instruction, know that this unsurpassable Heart Essence, not arising from existence of infinitely long path, is very rare enumeration of Dharma. Therefore similar to jewel, it should be held as precious treasure. In Supreme Sutra: because arising is rare, because stainless, because possessing power, and because becoming ornament of world—therefore jewel itself.

Emaho! Rare and precious Heart Essence!
