[5745-5746] Listen, dear practitioner! Through cutting the word's reversal, the word self-arisen wisdom dawns! Through blocking merely one's own speech, dharmas all abide in the inexpressible state—certain!

[5747-5752] Third, mind's three unmoving: Through not separating from focused stiffness, always abiding in Buddha's intent. Through entering awareness dharmadhatu's scope, not straying from entity's nature. Through always not separating from that itself, four visions measure arrived—certain! Also, moving by moving-turned returning is called—key point of liberating from those!

[5753-5761] Second, taking measure of three abidings: Three body's abidings free from action. Three wind's abidings taking measure of non-production. Three appearance's abidings confidence in non-reversal. First three: Abiding without dwelling in action, samsara's delusion cannot increase. Abiding in projecting and gathering limbs, delusion's wheel continuity ceases. Placing action in the ground, certain separation from accumulated action's ripening.

[5762-5764] Second three: Wind not going outward abiding, conditioned appearances various—no harm. Inward not blinking abiding, no support for various conceptual thought. Without going-coming outside-inside abiding, basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two—empty.

Do you see? Not moving is the key! When you stop chasing, wisdom dawns. When you stop blinking, concepts have no place to land. This is not doing something new—this is stopping the doing!

Emaho! Three unmoving, three abiding—liberation without moving!
