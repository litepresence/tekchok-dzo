Now we enter the detailed presentation of inner arising, starting with wind (*rlung*). This has two parts: root division and branch division.

Root division—five principal winds from the Self-Arisen:
1. Life-holding wind (*srog 'dzin*)—abides in the life channel (heart area)
2. Color-and-radiance-producing wind (*bkra gzi mdangs skyed*)—abides in the chest
3. Fire-equal wind (*me mnyam*)—abides in the navel
4. All-pervading wind (*kun khyab*)—pervades the whole body
5. Karma wind without compassion (*snying rje med pa bsKal pa las*)—abides between heart and heart-membrane

Their functions in sequence:
- Life-holding: maintains life
- Color-producing: produces radiance/complexion
- Fire-equal: digests food
- All-pervading: enables going and sitting (movement)
- Karma: performs life-transference (death process)

These winds aren't just physiological—they're the subtle energy that carries consciousness and supports the meditative experiences.

Second, branch division: each of the five winds subdivides into five, making 25 winds total.

First, the five life-holding winds:
1. Root-holding life
2. Protecting life
3. Spreading life
4. Impure life
5. Shattering life

Their functions:
1. Producing awareness potential
2. Producing bindhu (essence) potential
3. Producing light potential
4. Holding the root of non-awareness (ignorance)
5. Acting as helper to mind

The life wind potential relies on and abides in awareness potential. This is crucial: the vital energy and awareness are intimately connected.

Second, the five fire-equal winds:
1. Wind separating clear from impure
2. Wind producing warmth
3. Wind of clear-change (transforming clarity)
4. Wind gathering distinctions
5. Wind making praise

These support the digestive fire and transformative processes.
