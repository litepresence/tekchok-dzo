Listen to these seven aspects of awareness-pristine awareness! Awareness pristine awareness seed—no increase or decrease. Awareness empty-clear pristine awareness—not divisible. Awareness non-grasping pristine awareness—free from identification extremes. Awareness conception-free pristine awareness—completely clear in non-cessation. Awareness all-clear pristine awareness—unmixed, completely perfect. Awareness all-appearing pristine wisdom—clear without grasping. Awareness all-clear pristine awareness—clear and spontaneously dense. Thus.

From Self-Arising: "Jewel measureless palace well-arranged. Jewel variously spread queen, good ornaments. Jewel beautiful horse, swift as wind. Jewel various plains inexhaustible." Thus.

Emaho! These aren't descriptions of some celestial realm—they're describing your own awareness! The "palace" is the expanse of rigpa. The "jewels" are its qualities. Everything is complete, nothing needs to be added. Like a king in his palace—you're already enthroned in the kingdom of awareness!

Third, summarizing meaning-result: To Buddha of non-dual expanse and pristine awareness, virtue accumulations are immeasurable. From Jewel Array: "Perfectly completed Buddha's miracles immeasurable, uncalculable, ungraspable, immeasurable. Buddha's appearance transcends big-small extremes, like space. Buddha's power transcends is-isn't extremes, like great elephant. Buddha's capacity transcends abandonment-obtainment extremes, like lion. Buddha's virtue transcends empty-full extremes, like wish-fulfilling jewel. Buddha's nature transcends self-conception extremes, all-pervading pristine awareness itself. Buddha's abiding mode transcends faculties and objects, self-appearance itself. These are self-arisen intent's own words."

From Self-Arising: "Perfectly completed Buddha's intent has no limit. Buddha's realization immeasurable. Wisdom without calculation. No good-bad in abodes. No is-isn't in view. No edge-limit in ground. No transfer-change in path. No cause-return in result. Pristine awareness without clear-obscure. Wisdom without mind."

Thus, Buddha actual ground, result perfected, no path for self to traverse. Buddhas Bhagavans are explained from the object as "path-cutter, entry-cutter, elaboration and existence guide cutter."

Emaho! What completion! Buddha has nowhere to go, nothing to become, nothing to do—yet benefits flow like a river. This is the perfection that's not achieved but recognized. Don't look for it elsewhere—it's the very awareness reading these words!
