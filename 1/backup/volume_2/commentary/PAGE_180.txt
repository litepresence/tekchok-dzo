Liberation by just placing, liberation by just knowing key, primordial liberation, self-liberation, naked liberation, complete liberation, etc.—many, but here showing great self-liberation has no antidote, no effort needed.

Third: extensive explanation of self-liberation's intention has three: brief showing of essence; particular explanation of nature; conclusion of meaning.

From Pearl Garland: "To unceasing rigpa, no delusion cause so no return place. Primordially liberated, definitely transcended. Self-liberated, objects-conditions exhausted. Naked liberated, appearance pure. Extreme liberated, four extremes ceased. One liberated, multiplicity empty."

To nondual outer-inner wide-open rigpa—like crystal palace without stain—no ground key, no delusion cause, rootless rigpa without path. No path, no result-return place to three realms—primordially liberated like space, spontaneously complete intention.

Five great liberation modes, surpassing all common vehicles.

Five: primordial liberation, self-liberation, naked liberation, extreme liberation, one liberation. First primordial liberation depending on no-return key, showing all view-meditation effort-dependence unnecessary.

Wisdom pervasive generally spread—no doing, no fabrication. Not arisen from anywhere, not gone anywhere, not abiding anywhere—unchanging meaning.

Liberation not like untying, so view-meditation effort unnecessary. Liberation called abiding in own system—no acceptance-rejection meaning.

Emaho! Five liberations transcending all vehicles!
