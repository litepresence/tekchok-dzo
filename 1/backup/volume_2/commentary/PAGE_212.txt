[9103-9207] Listen well, dear yogin! That-from: effort great-small-by, day and month year all-by, individual time-to certain accomplish! Move very without time all-from, individual measure-to reach indeed—thus!

This experience take secret essential-point great! Third day night wheel manner determine four: continuum-to sense-organ essential-point-to gather, memory door close! Dawn know object vase-in put, wisdom directly clear! Morning wisdom clear-to demonstrate, arise-feeling all self-place pure! Day appear vast-by strike, sign all suppress! This formerly also explain, here also leap-over companion-as explain summary experience take, little former-and not-different distinction exist!

Day time elephant gaze-by manifest-to look, delusion-appear self-cease release sign suppress! Night time bindu empty lamp-to cognition place: bindu expand time cognition clear portion expand, decrease time cognition increasingly subtle go-from, end reference without go state, cognition reference think emanate gather without equipoise!

Sleep-to go time forehead center-in, bindu empty dissolve manner mind place having, sleep-of luminosity essence seize! Midnight-at heart within-of luminosity-to mind hold having sleep by, dream luminosity-to liberate having, habit-continuum cease! Then morning lion gaze by, bow-span-of sky-to AH white one-to consciousness place by, clear-empty elaboration-from free-of meaning within-from arise!
