My devoted ones, understand that this dharmadhatu wisdom has two aspects: the objects of knowledge with their specific and general characteristics, and the experienced phenomena that appear directly [13755-13756]. The dharmadhatu itself has outer and inner aspects—the outer is the empty sky with no substantial existence, while the inner is the pure lamp of awareness manifesting directly [13757-13758].

Wisdom here means recognizing what has always been present, the characteristics becoming certain at that very moment [13759-13760]. This wisdom holds without abandoning the characteristics of color, form, and the individual dharmata of each thing.

Then upon that, without touching or mixing, appears the white cloth of mirror-like wisdom, clear like a mirror's surface, equal to the scope of your senses, distinct from others [13764-13765]. Upon this are clear thigles with five lights, like an overturned mirror, radiating with the deep glow of wisdom [13766-13769].

Mirror-like wisdom is illustrated by how a mirror makes forms appear. Whatever reflection appears in it is not the actual form but the mirror making that reflection visible—this is the example [13770-13774]. When you recognize that the reflection is your own radiance, that is wisdom.

Then appears a yellow cloth with clear thigles of five lights [13776-13783]. This is the deep glow of equality wisdom arising.

Emaho!
