[1711-1720] Look here, you who seek liberation! Longchenpa now reveals the four enlightened activities (*'phrin las rnam pa bzhi*) through the four bardos. This isn't some abstract theory—this is the road map for your own death and rebirth!

[1711-1712] First, the **pacifying activity** in the **first bardo of clear light**: When the ground clear light dawns after death, you see the sphere of light (*'od gsal gyi tshom bu*)—like the sky at dawn. This is your chance! Not tomorrow, not in the next life—RIGHT THEN. If you recognize this as your own nature, you are liberated on the spot. If you miss it, you fall into the next bardo.

[1713-1714] Second, the **enriching activity** in the **second bardo**: The four wisdoms linked together appear—this is like finding treasure in your own pocket. The four wisdoms are: mirror-like, equality, discriminating, and all-accomplishing. They're not somewhere else—they're the nature of your own confusion!

[1715-1716] Third, the **power activity** in the **third bardo**: You see the eight gates of spontaneous preciousness (*lhun grub rin po che'i sgo brgyad*). This is like standing before eight doors, all leading to liberation. The power activity means you have the capacity to choose—but only if you recognize!

[1717-1720] Fourth, the **fierce activity** in the **fourth bardo**: Self-appearance liberates itself in primordially pure ground. This is the fierce truth—there's nothing to do! No meditation, no practice, no effort. Just recognize and you're free.

From the *Rang Shar* Tantra—don't look for these four activities outside. They're your own mind's display. The path is complete right here.

Emaho! Four activities, four opportunities!
