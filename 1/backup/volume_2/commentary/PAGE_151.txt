Keep digging. The hole goes deeper than you think.

If mind has no returning place, how do beings keep coming back? If mind is many different things, why does your experience feel unified? Here's the paradox: if all minds were truly separate, your thoughts would interfere with mine. You'd conquer me. I'd defeat you. We'd merge into some mongrel consciousness with no clear owner. But you have your suffering. I have mine. We don't share it. So mind isn't many.

If mind is one single thing, when you die, do I die too? When you wake up, do I wake up? But your memories aren't my memories. Your fears aren't my fears. So mind isn't one.

Caught. Neither one nor many. Neither exists independently nor depends on causes. What do you do with that?

The search exhausts itself. You look for mind through every door—inside, outside, between, one, many—and find nothing to grab onto. That finding nothing is the realization. The emptiness isn't empty of meaning—it's full of primordial wisdom that can't be grasped by concepts.

But wait—if mind has no cause, how does anything happen? If mind has causes, those causes must produce results. If results are samsara, they're impure—how can liberation come from impurity? If results are liberation, samsara never arose in the first place. Caught again.

The scriptures say it plain: ignorance's wheel has neither exhaust nor increase. Being's realm has no end. The nature of mind isn't born, doesn't die, doesn't increase or decrease. What does that leave?

You. Looking. Not finding. Resting in not-finding.

That's not nihilism. That's freedom from conceptual boxes. Mind can't be caught because mind is the catching itself.

Stop trying to figure it out. The figuring is the trap. Rest in the space before questions arise.

Silence is the answer that asks nothing.
