Listen closely, you who would be free! With pure vision, you see others' speech; with extremely pure, their mind; with supremely pure, all three simultaneously [14088-14090].

With invisible-becoming-path mind vision, in an instant you know the number of dust particles in three thousand great thousand-worlds [14091-14092]. With pure, you simultaneously know the number of sentient beings in each of those dust particles and how their minds change [14093]. With extremely pure, you know the nature of vessel and contents [14094]. With supremely pure, you see dharmata emptiness [14095].

With beings-completely-perfected mind vision, you simultaneously see how many winds moved when you took bodies in the past [14096-14097]. With pure, you simultaneously see how many non-virtuous minds arose [14097]. With extremely pure, virtuous numbers [14098]. With supremely pure, both virtue and non-virtue simultaneously [14099].

With faculties-liberated-from-perversion mind vision, you see the characteristics of places where you took countless past lives [14100-14101]. With pure, see others' past birthplaces [14102]. With extremely pure, know what conduct of body, speech, and mind was done then [14103]. With supremely pure, simultaneously know both self and others' past birthplaces and three doors' conduct [14104].

Thus mind clairvoyance six, divided into four each, makes twenty-four categories [14105].

Emaho!
