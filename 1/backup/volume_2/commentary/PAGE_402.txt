Essence, definitive terminology, division, enumeration—four. Essence: various, not fixed. Manner of abiding of that essence: free from attachment and fixation, samadhi mind non-conceptual nature, abiding evenly.

Definitive terminology: Emanating whatever tames whomever, thus "emanation." That itself, harmonious appearing form perfectly complete, thus "kaya."

Divided: common and uncommon systems—two. Common vehicle's famous three: from the Sutralankara:

"Craft and birth and supreme awakening—
Supreme awakening's emanation,
This Buddha emanation kaya,
Great method of liberation."

This describes nirmanakaya—the form body that appears to ordinary beings. Not fixed, not permanent, but appearing according to what's needed.

[16692-16714]
Craft: paintings and so forth.

Birth: Buddha emanating as various forms for beings—horses, great fish, and so forth.

Supreme awakening's emanation: twelve deeds. From the Gyud Lama:

"From dharmakaya not moving,
By emanation's nature various,
Birth manifest birth,
Transferring from Tushita abode,
Entering womb and birth,
Skilled in craft abodes,
Enjoying play with queen's retinue,
Leaving home difficult practice,
Going to awakening heart,
Defeating mara hosts, perfecting,
Awakening Dharma wheel,
Together with all gods,
Always showing parinirvana,
In impure realms,
Showing abiding as long as existence."

These are the twelve deeds of the Buddha—emanations that appear according to the needs of beings, not bound by any fixed form or time.

[16715-16721]
In this uncommon vehicle: impure emanation kaya, taming beings' emanation kaya, nature emanation kaya—three. First: hunters, butchers, and so forth, emanations.

This is profound! The Buddha appears not just in pure forms, but in impure forms too—appearing as hunters, fishermen, even criminals—to benefit beings who can only be reached in those forms. This is ultimate compassion—not holding to purity, but appearing wherever needed.

Emaho! Emanations everywhere, benefiting all!
