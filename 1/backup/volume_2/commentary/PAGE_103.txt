Listen here, you who talk too much! Longchenpa now teaches about speech - and you might not like what he has to say! The Great Perfection isn't about fancy prayers or elaborate mantras. It's about cutting through the very habit of talking!

First, speech training: "speaking less, ordinary speech cutting" - this means stop your ordinary chatter! Not just减少 quantity but cutting the very tendency to explain everything, to justify yourself, to fill silence with words. Short sessions train, then long train - this isn't about duration but about depth. Ten minutes of mindful silence beats hours of distracted chatter.

"Occasionally speech cause none, alone speak!" - this is profound! When you truly have something to say, speak. When not, remain silent. But silence isn't emptiness - it's pregnant with meaning. Alone doesn't mean lonely - it means resting in non-duality!

[4611–4625]
Now abiding - listen carefully! "Mantra and utterance etc., virtuous utterance not-deny" - Longchenpa isn't telling you to reject mantras! He's saying don't get stuck in them. When you abide in nature of mind, all virtuous utterances arise naturally. "Other word syllable not-mix" - this means don't corrupt your natural expression with forced techniques.

"This time body sign meaning understand!" - The body will show signs when your speech aligns with truth. Not dramatic miracles, but subtle shifts: lightness, clarity, effortless flow. When your speech comes from silence rather than from thinking, the body responds!

[4626–4631]
And swallowing - the crucial point! "Mantra etc. utterance all not-do" - This is the secret: when you recognize mind's nature, you don't need to do anything with mantra or speech! The mantra completes itself. "Firm: what not-utter, state not-transgressing" - When you rest in this non-doing, you naturally maintain samaya without effort.

"Body purified buddhas and bodhisattvas, sky-goers dakinis blessing" - When speech ceases into natural silence, the body becomes a pure vessel for wisdom. Buddhas recognize this purity, bodhisattvas admire it, dakinis are drawn to it!

Emaho! The Great Perfection's speech seals are not about saying more - they're about recognizing when silence says everything!
