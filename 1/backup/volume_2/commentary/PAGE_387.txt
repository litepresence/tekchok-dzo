Listen! With reference to compassion's path body guiding trainees, pristine awareness and activity appearing externally, accomplishing benefit, this is explained as "path of no-more-learning." Third: Ascertaining body and pristine awareness ground-appearance in two parts: Identifying ground-appearance. Extensive explanation of nature.

First has ground-appearance itself and refuting wrong understandings. First: Dharmakaya of abandonment-realization ultimate, primordially pure spontaneously accomplished jewel womb—that is body and pristine awareness ground-appearance. That too, essence empty-clear self-arising pristine awareness, nowhere established as anything, nowhere divided, without making, without division, transcending speech, thought, expression, liberated from samsara-nirvana extremes, like sky nowhere established, yet becoming ground-appearance of all immeasurable virtues arising like sun, moon, planets, stars—therefore called pristine awareness perfection body.

From Thal 'gyur: "Buddhas' suchness—undivided, non-dividing, equal—how can sound, words, names exist? Reference-basis self-pure confusion pure, samsara-nirvana not famous as names. Unarisen, unborn, without cessation, all-arising pristine awareness, what is not?" Thus.

Emaho! This is your nature! Not established anywhere, yet the source of all virtues. Like space containing all worlds, yet not confined by them. Don't make it a thing, don't deny its function—let it be naturally perfect!

[16023-16044]
"Suchness self-dissolved: Elements dissolved, dust and atoms finally ceased, even particles don't abide. Afflictions dissolved, confusion and conception-free attachment not abiding, latencies and all-arising, even dust-particles don't abide. Thus by dissolving coarse and subtle, five aggregates too gradually subtle. Four elements' body exhausted, all pristine awareness perfection body. Concept-free samadhi self-abiding, transcending artificial dharmas, therefore 'dharma' doesn't abide as word." Thus.

Second has three: Positing the position. Refuting it. Establishing correct system. First: Some early masters say...

Don't be shocked by "dissolved" and "ceased"—this isn't destruction! It's the recognition that all these "things" were never solid to begin with. Like waking from a dream—the dream didn't go anywhere, you just recognized it was a dream. The aggregates don't need to be destroyed—they need to be recognized as the display of awareness!
