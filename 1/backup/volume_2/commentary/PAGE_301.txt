Listen here, you who would guide the dead! This wisdom-water of great equality—pour it forth like a waterfall that doesn't choose where it falls. That vase at the armpit? It's not some fancy ritual object to polish. It's the gateway where consciousness can slip through, cleansed by the streaming water of yeshe. You wash away the god realms, empty them out completely, and even they obtain the happy state of human birth. Don't you see? This isn't about magic—it's about directing the stream of consciousness with certainty!

When the six signs appear before death, you visualize the letters of those realms and draw the breath upward—no vase needed while they're still breathing! But once dead, at the charnel ground, you visualize those same letters and wash with the vase. Even if they've already taken birth elsewhere, the ritual's blessing power acts like a dream that dissolves upon waking. The hell realms, all of them—their lifespan becomes like a nightmare that lasts only an instant, a moment, a finger-snap, and then they're born human!

Now you might ask: "Aren't gods the lords of beings?" Ha! The lord of beings is the human! With human support, if you apply yourself, you find liberation in one lifetime and choose higher and higher realms. But gods? They fall from high to low. They don't get liberation in one life. They can't even become monks or take ordination! If they can't accomplish even common excellent virtues, how could they accomplish the uncommon excellent virtues of the supreme vehicle? Killing a god creates only a minor fault—killing a human creates the heaviest karma! That's why the human body is called the lord of beings.

The third topic: the post-death purification. After the body is gone, the sequence of seven-day periods—this is how you work it. As it says in the Sun-Moon Union:

Emaho! The human body—a precious vase filled with the nectar of immortality!
