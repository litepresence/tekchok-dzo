Listen! From Pearl Garland: "Liberation place itself is primordial." Thus. In primordial primordial purity, awareness knowing own face, not returning to cause, confusion ground exhausted, name changes to 'result.' From previously explained ground context in detail, should be known as distinguished by being free from stains.

Second has three: Actual mode of liberation in expanse. Nature of abiding in expanse. How suchness intent expanse coils in expanse. First: When sharp, dull, medium faculties liberate, no difference in result. All three times' Buddhas, Dharmakaya beyond expression, intention exhausted, one in that, face-equal without difference nature, sole bindu Buddha. Whether in this life with remainder, or in bardo self-appearance held, or exhaling breath in emanation field. Path-appearance body and pristine awareness appearance external clear aspects, spontaneously dissolving into expanse, like light gathering inside crystal, appearance liberated into emptiness, pristine awareness dissolving into expanse, form body passing beyond sorrow in Dharmakaya expanse, thing and mark non-existent sky-like suchness, one taste like space dissolving into space.

Example: Awareness cut separate from expanse, abiding in body like space inside vase, related to great space through vase's opening. Four Lamps connect with primordial primordially pure. When vase breaks, external-internal-intermediate three spaces non-dual, one essence abiding. Body-mind separated, five awarenesses without external-internal gap, great internal expanse primordially pure great abiding.

From Six Expanses: "In Samantabhadra state, all elaborations completely pacified, unrivaled Buddha, all dharmas' eye dust free." Seeing fields everywhere limitless, external-internal appearance non-dual mixed, obtaining completely pure expanse intent.

Emaho! This is the great liberation! The five awarenesses become the five wisdoms. The body becomes the mandala. Space inside and outside the vase is never different—only the walls made it seem separate. Your nature and the nature of all Buddhas is the same space!
