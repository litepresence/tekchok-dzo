[5774] [5774] Arises through the four powers' result becoming manifest.
[5775] [5775] That also: at the time of dharmata manifesting, the body like a tortoise put into a shell bowl,
[5776] [5776] Arises through the body's channels abiding relaxed.
[5777] [5777] That is the great perfection's meaning, free from action-effort, entering the body limbs.
[5778] [5778] Through the pure action of vase-empowerment,
[5779] [5779] Elaboration-together wisdom certainly arises self-arisen.
[5780] [5780] At the time of upper increase, the body going like a person tormented by sickness, arises through wind entering the central channel,
[5781] [5781] The great perfection's meaning without negation-establishment entering the general.
[5782] [5782] Through the pure action of secret empowerment,
[5783] [5783] Elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5784] [5784] At measure-arrival, the body like an elephant sinking in mud,
[5785] [5785] Arises through mind hitting channels and winds.
[5786] [5786] The great perfection's meaning without accepting-rejecting entering the heart.

[5791] [5791] The great perfection's self-free equal meaning entering the body-eye, through word-empowerment body action purified,
[5792] [5792] Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5793] [5793] Those are shown nearby by examples—
[5794] [5794] The signs of body's delusions naturally ceasing in meaning.
[5795] [5795] The sign-measure letters are intended for the general manner of meaning;
[5796] [5796] Vimal said these are placed very upon meaning.
[5797] [5797] Speech basis also like the four visions and sequence:
[5798] [5798] Speech going like a mute manner, arises through consciousness entering inner channels.
[5799] [5799] This is the great perfection's expressive basis, self-pure, entering speech-symbols,
[5800] [5800] Cutting elaboration outward, clear in the manner of inner wisdom.
[5801] [5801] Speech going like a crazy person's self-words bursting forth:
