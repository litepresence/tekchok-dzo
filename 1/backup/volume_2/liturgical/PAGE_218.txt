[9354] [9354] Fruit: obtaining fruit of wisdom arising as one-cut not abiding in appearance.
[9355] [9355] Three view-signs of middle sense-power:

[9357] [9357] Intention:
[9358] [9358] Endowed with fierce, short duration like waterfall.

[9363] [9363] Three view-signs of last sense-power:

[9372] [9372] Third, summarizing meaning by aspect:
[9373] [9373] These five intentions bind all secret heart-essence yogins.
[9374] [9374] Arising of yogin's experience:
[9375] [9375] By mountain general meaning, transcending view of great perfection without high-low, slack-tight equality.
[9376] [9376] By wisdom's general filling, grasp ground as self-abiding Dharma-nature in that manner.
[9377] [9377] By bindu range-penetration, examine awareness's liberation manner from space-appearance.
[9378] [9378] By sun-moon equal gap, deliver intention to Dharma-ceasing expanse.
[9379] [9379] By ocean expanse-penetration, stably hold ground at primordially pure ground of space-awareness.
[9380] [9380] Also, first: like lion's play conquering fear of delusory appearance destruction, washed high by view.
[9381] [9381] Second: like king-awareness empowerment obtaining self-power Dharma-nature.
[9382] [9382] Third: like peacock chick emerging from egg, reaching pure space.
[9383] [9383] Fourth: like equal sun-moon without two, expanding greatly all-equal vastness.
[9384] [9384] Fifth: establishing supreme secret bindu meaning gathered in intention like sun arising from mountain neck, self-appearance clear as wisdom.
