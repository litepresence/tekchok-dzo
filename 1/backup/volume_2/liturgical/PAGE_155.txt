[6549] [6549] Great bliss liberation's doctrine finding-time not-exists—
[6550] [6550] Like boat sinking, entering water.
[6551] [6551] Non-existent mind's existing-support itself deceives and binds—thus said.
[6552] [6552] From Samantabhadra's Heart Mirror:
[6553] [6553] "Desiring appearance as dharmakaya is obstruction to me."
[6554] [6554] "Desiring whatever-appears as mind is obstruction to me."
[6555] [6555] "Desiring self-arising as other is obstruction to me."
[6556] [6556] Thus said.
[6557] [6557] Then: does "mind dissolving" mean existing becomes non-existent?
[6558] [6558] Dissolving: as before, unestablished through examination;
[6559] [6559] Even unexamined, from sudden memory-thoughts' thought dissolving,
[6560] [6560] Mind's self-continuum does not go from existence to non-existence.
[6561] [6561] Dissolve-cause and dissolve-condition nowhere exist.
[6562] [6562] Then: is destroying mind's house purposeless, since nothing to destroy?
[6563] [6563] To primordially non-existent mind,
[6564] [6564] Only making realize non-existent nature—
[6565] [6565] Not that mind's house's basis or entity exists.
[6566] [6566] Memory's source having gone to dharmata,
[6567] [6567] Making understand non-existence,
[6568] [6568] Conventionally called "destroying house."
[6569] [6569] Destroying the existent—nothing whatsoever.
[6570] [6570] Therefore, placing above whatever-appears object-vital-point of appearance—the so-called "term's result"—
[6571] [6571] Inert appearance without grasping there, result of non-dual object-mind;
[6572] [6572] Placing above whatever-knowing moves,
[6573] [6573] Mind's house self-destroying, movement-thought-liberated result;
[6574] [6574] Thus, identifying non-dual inert-knowing union wisdom's dissolving place, non-existent result.
[6575] [6575] Thus, result-three's times also upon four vital-points of dissolving-time facing-introduction,
[6576] [6576] Know sixteen non-existent dharmas as before.
[6577] [6577] This also: from Great Secret Certain Heart-Essence's Cutting-Through—mind primordially non-existent, self-liberated;
[6578] [6578] Movement sudden, primordially liberated;
[6579] [6579] Instruction other and mind ultimately non-existent;
[6580] [6580] Pretending conventionally existent.
