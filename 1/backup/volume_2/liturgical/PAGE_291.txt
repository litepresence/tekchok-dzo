[12541] [12541] When the ocean's water vapor dissolves,
[12542] [12542] This too is divided by the wise in sequence.
[12543] [12543] In earth's villages and cities,
[12544] [12544] If the monk's smoke itself breaks,
[12545] [12545] In nine days he will thus perish.
[12546] [12546] On the peak of Meru mountain,
[12547] [12547] If the unchanging sun sets,
[12548] [12548] In three days he will also die.
[12549] [12549] Completely abandon rites,
[12550] [12550] Examine the meaning of self-awareness essence.
[12551] [12551] From inside the hollow of Meru,
[12552] [12552] If the ḍākinī's sound breaks,
[12553] [12553] In thirteen or five days.
[12554] [12554] If from the wish-fulfilling tree,
[12555] [12555] The demon of death-lords rises,
[12556] [12556] In seven days he cannot be liberated.
[12557] [12557] That will not become benefit.
[12558] [12558] Habituation to emptiness is precious.
[12559] [12559] Thus.
[12560] [12560] Second, the common:
[12561] [12561] Also from that itself,
[12562] [12562] If the luster of limb nails is gone,
[12563] [12563] In nine months he cannot but perish.

[12566] [12566] If the death-lord Yama himself rises,
[12567] [12567] In twenty-one days he dies.
[12568] [12568] Nothing can benefit that.
[12569] [12569] If the ankle of the foot protrudes outward,
[12570] [12570] In one month likewise.
[12571] [12571] If examining another's body,
[12572] [12572] When the birth-being is struck by disease,
[12573] [12573] Tartar accumulates at the tooth root,
[12574] [12574] In nine days he will also die.
[12575] [12575] In various five days likewise,
[12576] [12576] In that way also death.
[12577] [12577] Limbs repeatedly move and contract,
[12578] [12578] That is in seven days.
[12579] [12579] When eyes look with sticking grains,
[12580] [12580] In three days tro-ta.
[12581] [12581] If the eye joints are greatly disturbed,
[12582] [12582] That is in half a month.
[12583] [12583] If the cheek channels break,
[12584] [12584] In nineteen days likewise.
[12585] [12585] The birth-being does life formation,
[12586] [12586] If breath is also agitated in gasping,
[12587] [12587] That is in six months.
[12588] [12588] If the nose ma-si-ka breaks,
[12589] [12589] In seven days he will perish.
[12590] [12590] If the eye ba-ra-na breaks,
[12591] [12591] In five days he will also perish.
[12592] [12592] If the left cheek flesh falls,
[12593] [12593] In one day he will likewise perish.
[12594] [12594] If upper and lower teeth become closed,
[12595] [12595] In three days he cannot but perish.
[12596] [12596] If black drops arise on the tongue,
[12597] [12597] In two days he will also perish.
[12598] [12598] If ears stick to the head,
[12599] [12599] That is at midnight of that night.
[12600] [12600] If the chest protruding nose collapses,
[12601] [12601] In half a month he cannot but perish.
[12602] [12602] If there is no root for falling asleep,
[12603] [12603] That is also in half a month.
[12604] [12604] Thus.
[12605] [12605] Third, showing the method of reversal.
