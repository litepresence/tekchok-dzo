[12205] Doing certainty by clear situation, from Sun-Moon Union:
[12206] Exclamation! Conqueror, you listen:
[12207] By condensing all those,
[12208] The drop remaining as one is obtained.
[12209] And what and what are they?
[12210] By putting, self-spread is obtained;
[12211] By intentions, time is shown;
[12212] By exhaust-patterns, intention is shown;
[12213] By stable confidence, the not-turning sign.
[12214] Thus meanings are condensed.
[12215] These are that result:
[12216] Who sees the space-lamp
[12217] Manifestly exercises in dharma-space;
[12218] Who sees the drop-lamp
[12219] Obtains the hope-base of those with effort;
[12220] Who sees the wisdom-lamp
[12221] Realizes general and self-characteristic;
[12222] Who sees the water-lamp
[12223] Obtains power over faculties;
[12224] Who is habituated in lu-gu-rgyud,
[12225] Awarenesses obtain balance.
[12226] By that result of three bodies,
[12227] All these are self-awareness ground.
[12228] In the intermediate state of nature-remaining,
[12229] The birth-being habituated to these,
[12230] All elements as self-vanish,
[12231] Become in this without doubt.
[12232] These dharmas I proclaimed,
[12233] All sutras and tantras here condensed—thus extensively said.
[12234] Second, the eightfold instruction like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror for giving clarity to unclear in the death-time intermediate state: thinking the cause of certain death with many examples, examining death's signs, showing reversal methods, showing death-time appearance, showing giving instruction, showing birth-place signs, showing purifying rites, showing other uncommon places.
[12235] First has three: training in dharma without opportunity for leisure-freedom by thinking on the difficult-to-obtain manner; showing the rite of training; producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on continuous cause of certain decay; meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death.
