[5685] [5685] Through that reversal, outer delusion vision ceases,
[5686] [5686] Heat arises in body and mind inward.
[5687] [5687] Pressing both hand-palms to earth reverses moving action-wind.
[5688] [5688] Through that reversal, outer bindus and small bindus dawn,
[5689] [5689] Experience without day and night arises inward.
[5690] [5690] Bending the nape a little reverses grasping action-wind.
[5691] [5691] Through that reversal, seeing outer body-vision,
[5692] [5692] Exhausts wind's movement inward.
[5693] [5693] Regarding Dharmakaya posture also:
[5694] [5694] Sound explanation:
[5695] [5695] Like one with complete lion's three abilities not fearing anything,
[5696] [5696] That body vital clears the fears of the three realms.
[5697] [5697] Regarding dividing the manner of meaning:
[5698] [5698] The vital of establishing continuity:
[5699] [5699] Sitting in dog-curl makes expanse and awareness meet.
[5700] [5700] Pressing foot-soles to earth ceases various conceptualities.
[5701] [5701] Bending all hand-finger joints and placing inside the two feet empties the movement of action and affliction.
[5702] [5702] Resting the upper body in a gap makes always not separate from dharmata.
[5703] [5703] Carrying channels to the nape makes support without place to stick from dharmata's meaning.
[5704] [5704] Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5705] [5705] Placing both foot-soles to earth, pushing the knee a little outward, sitting in dog-curl
[5706] [5706] Reverses pervading action-wind.
[5707] [5707] Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5708] [5708] The continuum of affliction ceases cut inward.
[5709] [5709] Placing both hand-palms inward ceases grasping action-wind.
[5710] [5710] Through that ceasing, seeing outer wisdom vision,
[5711] [5711] The continuum of object-possessor grasping conceptuality ceases inward.
[5712] [5712] Resting the upper body in a gap and stretching the nape
[5713] [5713] Reverses emitting action-wind.
[5714] [5714] Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5715] [5715] The continuum of affliction ceases inward.
[5716] [5716] Moreover, pressing the Dharmakaya posture completes Buddha-wisdom in this itself.
