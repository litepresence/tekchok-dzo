[11072] Awareness self-liberating without grasping,
[11073] Small grasping at outer-inner dharmas,
[11074] No attachment or clinging to body.
[11075] Fifth, awareness—five aspects:
[11076] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[11077] Essence: appearing as vajra chain.
[11078] From Lion Power Complete:
[11079] Own-appearance awareness thing that,
[11080] Dwells as wisdom chain.
[11081] Definition: previously not-aware, aware by guru pith-instruction, therefore awareness.
[11082] Division: three—ground-dwell awareness beyond virtue-defect fault, path-appearance awareness famous in respective philosophical systems, insight awareness.
[11083] Mind-itself, unborn, co-emergent wisdom, mind-beyond, meaning alaya, bodhicitta called—whatever name, pervading all buddhas and beings, self-awareness wisdom self-clear empty naked this.
[11084] Insight awareness: direct appearance of vajra chain kaya, free from thought word cage, without bright-dim of virtue-defect fault-merit, if diligence not distracting from that view, accomplishes light-body transparent-penetrate.
[11085] Characteristic: this naked self-clear.
[11086] Result: liberates into primordially-pure transparent-penetrate by practicing that.
[11087] Though commonly considering three kayas as result, here making path, not establishing primordially-pure extreme-free great as kaya and wisdom, considers result like crystal not-ceasing arise-basis—great distinction.
[11088] Signs of training such awareness:
[11089] From Blazing Relics:
[11090] Who familiar with awareness,
[11091] These signs upon that body:
[11092] Able to insert self-awareness there,
[11093] Wherever thing is placed,
[11094] Body follows that
[11095] Wherever ground dwells,
[11096] As same as awareness,
[11097] Able to change others' faith,
[11098] Self-ceasing thought-continuum clinging,
[11099] Possessing inner signs—
[11100] Who knows directly,
[11101] This goes to elements' own-place,
[11102] This fortunate one dissolves,
[11103] Gains supreme unborn siddhi.
