[11274] Signs of yogin liberating and obtaining enlightenment, and showing signs of six beings taking birth through confusion.
[11275] Of the first, two aspects:
[11276] Brief showing of signs,
[11277] Extensive explanation.
[11278] Of the first:
[11279] Even meditating reality direct meaning, if diligence inferior, measure not reached. At time of separating solid-awareness with stone, signs of liberating from defilements without taking existence—complete buddhahood by great appearance of self-relics, sound, and light.
[11280] That also: Great Perfection's system has two buddha ways—complete buddha by appearing signs is nirvana with remainder, stone with residue; perfectly complete buddha by excellent diligence, pure stone with, is nirvana without aggregates' remainder.
[11281] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror Tantra:
[11282] Nirvana that also two:
[11283] Perfectly complete buddha and
[11284] Complete buddha.
[11285] Of that, perfectly complete buddha is
[11286] Buddhahood without aggregates' remainder.
[11287] To complete buddha person,
[11288] Light and
[11289] Sound and
[11290] Relics and
[11291] Kaya and
[11292] Earth move etcetera arise, said.
[11293] From Blazing Relics:
[11294] Excellent wisdom-power person,
[11295] Elements dissolve to self-place
[11296] From confusion appearance this,
[11297] To essence result,
[11298] Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[11299] Result becomes self-ground.
[11300] Thus outer signs,
[11301] What from nirvana,
[11302] To that kaya and relics and
[11303] Likewise light and sound and
[11304] Earth moves.
[11305] Second, extensive explanation—five:
[11306] Kaya, relics, light, sound, and earth move.
[11307] Of the first, essence, division, cause, place, and result.
