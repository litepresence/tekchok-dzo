[4720] By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—
[4721] This same, certain.
[4722] Sambhogakaya: wisdom eye existing in body;
[4723] By that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands.
[4724] Nirmanakaya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart;
[4725] By that blessing, seeing separate from sound word,
[4726] Hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmata's meaning dawns within.
[4727] That also: three-eyes gaze,
[4728] Dharmata eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point.
[4729] Equal gaze at wisdom's corner,
[4730] Equal mixing samsara-nirvana taste—main-point.
[4731] Look with discriminating-awareness lowered,
[4732] Actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point.
[4733] What is three gaze manners' determination?
[4734] Lazy one: sambhogakaya;
[4735] Diligent one: nirmanakaya;
[4736] Equanimity one: dharmakaya gaze manner—auspicious;
[4737] Therefore three determined.
[4738] Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmata,
[4739] Gaze pure, obscuration exhausted;
[4740] Mode: liberating from samsara.
[4741] Second, field's main-point:
[4742] Outer dhatu's field: empty sky, separate from clouds.
[4743] Inner dhatu's field: gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot,
[4744] Dhatu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.
[4745] From Thalgyur:
[4746] Dhatu: outer and inner;
[4747] Outer: gaze at cloud-separate sky;
[4748] When dust and rain removed,  Press direct main-point, expert,  Make inner lamp the path.  Thus it was said.  That also: outer awareness dawning field;  Inner: experience increasing field.  Awareness and experience, from two not existing,  Called samsara-nirvana mixed.  That also: earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse—  Gaze at field, not liberate.  First: not desire vision dawn;  Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like,  Knowing also compatible with that arises,  Emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.
