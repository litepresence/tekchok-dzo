[10173] [10173] Question: Is example introduction not blocked?
[10174] [10174] That is: without seeing meaning of manifest awareness, mind-examining-holding—some say awareness's example is like this, like sky;
[10175] [10175] Some say different elements;
[10176] [10176] Some say light;
[10177] [10177] Demonstrate by god's body.
[10178] [10178] Common vehicle general,
[10179] [10179] Making only pure nature of low for some portions of outer-inner secret,
[10180] [10180] To negate base of primordially pure awareness,
[10181] [10181] Is spoken for negating grasping at thing's self-characteristic.
[10182] [10182] At this occasion demonstrating meaning of secret heart essence,
[10183] [10183] However much demonstrating example, no deviation,
[10184] [10184] No grasping place.
[10185] [10185] Those seeing manifest awareness, though introduction only as that's helper,
[10186] [10186] Again essence,
[10187] [10187] Expansion,
[10188] [10188] By dissolve manner, like crystal, great open primordially pure—demonstrate by crystal above pure,
[10189] [10189] With suitability.
[10190] [10190] That tantra also demonstrates this little, speaks thus.
[10191] [10191] From that same source:
[10192] [10192] Indicative example of Vajra-Mind:
[10193] [10193] White color, moon's color,
[10194] [10194] Etc., thus demonstrating awareness by three: example, sign, meaning,
[10195] [10195] Demonstrating birthless, ceaseless, open expanse.
[10196] [10196] Then this introduction suitable to sense-power:
[10197] [10197] With experience-taking hand-guidance,
[10198] [10198] Without deviation place, without stagnate place,
[10199] [10199] Ear lineage and hand gesture together,
[10200] [10200] Confidence,
[10201] [10201] Cutting superimposition,
[10202] [10202] Connecting word and meaning.
[10203] [10203] Supreme introduction spoken for demonstrating place of Buddha's Dharma lineage.
[10204] [10204] ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[10205] [10205] Demonstrating by relying on difficult introduction of vajra place,
[10206] [10206] The twenty-first chapter.
[10207] [10207] Thus having extensively demonstrated sequence of taking experience,
[10208] [10208] Now, demonstrating sequence of determining signs of yogin experience-taker has three aspects:
[10209] [10209] Generally demonstrating meaning of how purifying signs in former life now abide in body, speech, mind;
