[4566] All sentient beings, led by three afflictions into three realms—
[4567] From that, liberation.
[4568] Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—
[4569] Therefore determined as three.
[4570] From the wheel of samsaric karma:
[4571] Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges;
[4572] Action and doer, speech chief, becoming;
[4573] When ripening into body, delight in speech,
[4574] Object chief, desire great,
[4575] Delight in desire comes.
[4576] To take that into the pure path,
[4577] Sambhogakaya posture is shown.
[4578] Such beings, always performing supreme sambhogakaya posture,
[4579] Become supreme experts in dharmata's meaning.
[4580] From samsara's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—
[4581] Pig emerges;
[4582] That same producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.
[4583] When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great,
[4584] Not delighting in speech,
[4585] Always delighting in sleep comes.
[4586] Always abiding in dharmakaya posture,
[4587] Determined to abide in dharmata for three times.
[4588] First, aversion impure ripening into form—
[4589] Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;
[4590] This, delighting in body action, desire to move,
[4591] Body strength great, body coarse,
[4592] Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.
[4593] Always abiding in nirmanakaya posture, determined to become buddha.
[4594] Therefore posture is determined as three.
[4595] Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,
[4596] Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.  More than that not needed;  Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.  At this time, speech main-point: cutting speech.
