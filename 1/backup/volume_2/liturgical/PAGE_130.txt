[5565] [5565] Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara, such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt in this life or the bardo.
[5566] [5566] This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra:
[5567] [5567] When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion,
[5568] [5568] Fingers and so forth appear thus.
[5569] [5569] Focusing this, elements naturally cease.
[5570] [5570] Through the difference of birth and entry,
[5571] [5571] Upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted,
[5572] [5572] Without holding anything whatsoever,
[5573] [5573] One abides—this is the emanation body.
[5574] [5574] Through this, the power of entry's force,
[5575] [5575] Who has obtained self-power over birth,
[5576] [5576] Also focusing upon that,
[5577] [5577] Again at times doing thus,
[5578] [5578] The self-sound of vision rustling,
[5579] [5579] Manifestly reverses, appearing as delusion.
[5580] [5580] Through this, doing all benefit for beings,
[5581] [5581] For awareness is equal and one,
[5582] [5582] The great transfer of three thousand
[5583] [5583] Beings is accomplished by this.
[5584] [5584] Thus through gradual and instantaneous,
[5585] [5585] The body is accomplished by this.
[5586] [5586] All that is free from body-exhaustion measure.
[5587] [5587] All this, certain result,
[5588] [5588] Accomplishes the great mandala, supreme ground.
[5589] [5590] Thus the dawning of the four visions is called "the sequence of path-arising"—
[5590] [5591] Like the rungs of a ladder.
[5591] [5592] That also: from the part of abiding in the path, the dawn-agent does not cease;
[5592] [5593] From the part of obtaining the path, nothing whatsoever is unestablished.
[5593] [5594] Thus, through the four visions arriving at measure, buddha-fying without contaminated vision in this itself,
[5594] [5595] Especially sublime from the common vehicles,
[5595] [5596] Having met this dharma, one should make effort to practice with diligence.
[5596] [5597] Upon that itself:
[5597] [5598] For a person desiring to accomplish Buddhahood,
[5598] [5599] If possessing this means, it is thus.
[5599] [5600] For other conduct is pride itself,
[5600] [5601] Not seeing entity.
[5601] [5602] Therefore this is all rare words—
[5602] [5603] Always look to this jewel treasure.
[5603] [5605] Fourth meaning: the four instructions of extreme reliance are the back-support or closely-arisen support of the above.
