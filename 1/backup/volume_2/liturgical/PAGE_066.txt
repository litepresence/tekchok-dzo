[3119] [3116] By this, confusion is made into the path.
[3120] [3117] Thus it is.
[3121] [3118] Third, the illusory body: making appearance-existence into the yoga of illusion.
[3122] [3119] Herein, daytime training of the illusory body upon reflection, and.
[3123] [3120] Nighttime training of the illusory body in dream—two aspects.
[3124] [3121] First: appearance of reflection arising in mirror, and.
[3125] [3122] Upon these outer-inner phenomena difference not existing.
[3126] [3123] Holding as true—what use?
[3127] [3124] All are illusion-reflection appearance—knowing this with non-distracted aspiration, meditate whatever appears as illusion-reflection, and.
[3128] [3125] Especially upon one's own form appearing in mirror.

[3130] [3127] Putting ornaments, and.
[3131] [3128] Removing those, throwing outside, and.
[3132] [3129] Praising, and.
[3133] [3130] Disparaging, etcetera—doing these.
[3134] [3131] Though that form appears there, like meaning not established.
[3135] [3132] Upon this appearance—self-other.
[3136] [3133] Enemy-friend.
[3137] [3134] Food-clothing.
[3138] [3135] Enjoyment.
[3139] [3136] Pleasant-unpleasant.

[3141] [3138] Birth-death.
[3142] [3139] Happiness-suffering.
[3143] [3140] Sickness-pain.
[3144] [3141] Whatever arises, remembers, appears—all samsara-nirvana phenomena like reflections inside mirror, knowing essence not existent from time of appearance itself.
[3145] [3142] Mastering deluded-appearance truthless illusion-nature.
[3146] [3143] Seeing own body also as illusion-body, without doubt holding bardo illusory-body.

[3148] [3145] Upon completely pure mirror-mandala.
[3149] [3146] Like face-reflection appearing.
[3150] [3147] How nature not established.
[3151] [3148] Ljonpa, know phenomena.
[3152] [3149] Thus said, and.
[3153] [3150] From Arya Samadhiraja Sutra:

[3155] [3152] Though appearing in clear defilement-not-exist lake.
