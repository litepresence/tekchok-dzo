[7358] [7358] Instruction clear in space self-place: place outside in great vast river-space intention pure time-non-existent three times, wide self-liberated without interval.
[7359] [7359] First:
[7360] [7360] Together with body vital point and wind vital point: firm place in self-clear knowing, self-appearance appearance without grasping-holding.
[7361] [7361] From Six Spaces:
[7362] [7362] If not making that suchness,
[7363] [7363] Like sky not covered by clouds,
[7364] [7364] Part clear primordially from primordial tone,
[7365] [7365] Thus in clear sky
[7366] [7366] Like self-appearance of sun heart,
[7367] [7367] Body stain-non-existent essence,
[7368] [7368] Heart essence certain one-gathered,
[7369] [7369] Mandala of I itself is.
[7370] [7370] Thus it is said.
[7371] [7371] Second: making experience by ten great methods of cutting mind connection of three times:
[7372] [7372] Also from That Itself:
[7373] [7373] Person by what: not holding past track,
[7374] [7374] Not taking future hope,
[7375] [7375] Then placing now knowing in self-place,
[7376] [7376] From mixing all knowing before-after non-existent into one—
[7377] [7377] Called one-gathered essence one:
[7378] [7378] Awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7379] [7379] Also: not following after track of past habits,
[7380] [7380] Not welcoming hope of later-arising habits,
[7381] [7381] Not relying on continuum of now habits—
[7382] [7382] Called awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7383] [7383] Mixing samsara-nirvana non-dual by method of memory self-ending:
[7384] [7384] Cutting interval of all past memory, and
[7385] [7385] Suppressing itself of future memory, and
[7386] [7386] Releasing to self-dissolve all now memory—
[7387] [7387] Called awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7388] [7388] Also: not sending enter to past mind,
[7389] [7389] Not sending back to future mind,
[7390] [7390] Not sending mind to now mind—
[7391] [7391] Realizing yogi equal to three times.
[7392] [7392] Also: not throwing stone to past ignorance,
[7393] [7393] Not abandoning father to future ignorance,
[7394] [7394] Not taking to side to now ignorance.
