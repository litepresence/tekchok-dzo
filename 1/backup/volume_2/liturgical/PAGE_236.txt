[10132] [10132] To all middling elaboration: at light, two—interior light and outer appearance.
[10133] [10133] At wisdom, three—essence, nature, compassion.
[10134] [10134] At body: self-single, father-mother.
[10135] [10135] Three collections.
[10136] [10136] At bindu: three—base, path, fruit.
[10137] [10137] At awareness: three—base-abiding, characteristic-holding, field-appearance.
[10138] [10138] At space: two—outer, inner; demonstrating by sixteen enumeration of introduction.
[10139] [10139] To all small elaboration: three—example, meaning, sign.
[10140] [10140] To all very free from elaboration: meeting essence by manifest single appearance.
[10141] [10141] From that same source:
[10142] [10142] For purpose of all great ones,
[10143] [10143] By twenty-one introductions,
[10144] [10144] Gather that from outer to inner.
[10145] [10145] Also gathered: these all.
[10146] [10146] At light, two; at wisdom, three.
[10147] [10147] At body, three demonstrated; at bindu, three.
[10148] [10148] Awareness, three; at space, two.
[10149] [10149] For meaning of gathering those all.
[10150] [10150] Very gathered: these all.
[10151] [10151] By three: example, sign, meaning,
[10152] [10152] Obtain fruit of abiding self-nature.
[10153] [10153] Enter god's yogin mudra,
[10154] [10154] For meaning of sign-possessing.
[10155] [10155] Intention of single elaboration-free:
[10156] [10156] Free holding of all those.
[10157] [10157] Make ripening having ripened as path.
[10158] [10158] To abiding by manifest continuum,
[10159] [10159] By self seeing self heart-essence,
[10160] [10160] What do by all other efforts?
[10161] [10161] Should familiarize with this itself.
[10162] [10162] Thus it is spoken.
[10163] [10163] Abandoning inner scriptural contradiction:
[10164] [10164] From Jewel Intricate Display:
[10165] [10165] Alas, Buddha-family son, after I completely pass from nirvana,
[10166] [10166] At the time of five hundred degenerations,
[10167] [10167] By those possessing deceiving child's nature,
[10168] [10168] The time arises of making confidence in Buddha's intention through example.
[10169] [10169] At that time, this secret tantra of self arises.
[10170] [10170] True awareness itself cannot be demonstrated by example.
[10171] [10171] To five lights of nature existing as self-nature,
[10172] [10172] Though demonstrating five lights of image, will not become Buddha.
