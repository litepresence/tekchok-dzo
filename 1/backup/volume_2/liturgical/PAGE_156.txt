[6581] [6581] Two: making path through view and meditation upon mind.
[6582] [6582] Though merely self-liberating, self-dawning, self-placing may seem discordant,
[6583] [6583] The meaning is not discordant:
[6584] [6584] Here, making primordially non-existent, and
[6585] [6585] Elsewhere desiring non-existence of the existent—thus.
[6586] [6586] Also union:
[6587] [6587] Desiring union where two existents connect one-to-one elsewhere, and
[6588] [6588] Here, no cause to enter union through primordial non-existence,
[6589] [6589] Non-existent essence having no different distinction—two not different, thus called "non-dual union."
[6590] [6590] This vital point, most crucial among all vehicles, extremely important and crucial:
[6591] [6591] From this, not desiring appearance as mind, and
[6592] [6592] Showing the great basis of buddhahood not experienced as existent mind.
[6593] [6593] Depending on this, face-introducing appearance as mind, and
[6594] [6594] Face-introducing mind itself as empty—know this as Heart Essence instruction intention.
[6595] [6595] If some instructions thus arise possibly, decide they are merely provisional below, not definitive meaning.
[6596] [6596] Third: objects appearing in mind's mirror dawning, aggregates six pervading expansive great equality:
[6597] [6597] Outer various appearances,
[6598] [6598] Inner sudden memory-thoughts,
[6599] [6599] All powers six appearances with objects,
[6600] [6600] Merely clear appearance of non-existence.
[6601] [6601] In meaning, nowhere outer-inner, like cataract-hairlines,
[6602] [6602] Illusion,
[6603] [6603] Eye-magic,
[6604] [6604] Emanation—appearing in mind although,
[6605] [6605] Know transcending exist-not-exist extremes from the very time of appearing.
[6606] [6606] From appearance's side, however designated, not contradictory;
[6607] [6607] Allow "is,"
[6608] [6608] Allow "is not,"
[6609] [6609] Allow "exists,"
[6610] [6610] Allow "not exists,"
[6611] [6611] Allow "appears,"
[6612] [6612] Allow "empty,"
[6613] [6613] Allow "deluded,"
[6614] [6614] Allow "liberated,"
[6615] [6615] Allow "good,"
[6616] [6616] Allow "bad,"
[6617] [6617] Allow "mind,"
[6618] [6618] Allow "other"—
[6619] [6619] However designated,
[6620] [6620] From empty's side, empty first by that itself which designates.
[6621] [6621] Designation is mind,
[6622] [6622] Mind is non-existent,
[6623] [6623] Like dream actions and illusion actions—no maker for non-existence.
