[11318] Essence: appearing as deity forms—single kaya, half-kaya, father-mother, mass, great mandala; according to that direction, stupa, wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, cross, sword, etcetera.
[11319] From not reaching creation-completion, letters, hand-symbols, half-kaya, self-single appear; from complete, father-mother, mass, mandala appear.
[11320] Division: peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya two.
[11321] From Blazing Relics:
[11322] To race-possessing nirvana,
[11323] That remainder contaminated,
[11324] Aggregates' trace burned purified,
[11325] To that kaya two—
[11326] Peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya.
[11327] From Self-Arisen:
[11328] Kaya form two exist,
[11329] Peaceful and wrathful said,
[11330] Wrathful thus-gone,
[11331] Peaceful cannot power emanation.
[11332] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11333] Kaya also two,
[11334] Peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya.
[11335] Continuum: two from essence cause—all beings primordial clear-light kaya; from existing relics, here creation-completion clearly shows manifest cause, arising from gathered pure elements.
[11336] Latency exists, not-ripe nature;
[11337] Manifest ripe, appearing as relics.
[11338] From former:
[11339] Beings primordial,
[11340] Self-place great ground dwell,
[11341] By ripe not-ripe distinction,
[11342] Manifest and latency.
[11343] Place: much arising from head or spine, though also from other. Here clear-light familiar arising kaya shown arising from those two.
[11344] From Blazing Relics:
[11345] Likewise kaya from head,
[11346] Or from spine vertebrae joint.
[11347] Result: rank of obtaining liberation.
