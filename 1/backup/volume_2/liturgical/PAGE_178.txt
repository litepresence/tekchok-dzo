[7533] Through whomsoever this wisdom meets,
[7534] Even they who bear inexpiable misdeeds,
[7535] Through habituating but to this alone—
[7536] Doubtless, they attain liberation.
[7537] Thus it is proclaimed.
[7538] The second: specific explanation of primordially-liberated ground-body, having three parts:
[7539] First, the demonstration that since liberation is finished from the beginning, at present self-liberation occurs without need for antidote of effort or striving. Second, the instruction not to transgress from the nature of that abiding-reality. Third, resting without having experienced going elsewhere from merely basisless self-dissolution in natural condition.
[7540] First: From the Pearl Garland:
[7541] Not through effort is liberation attained,
[7542] */ From the beginning abiding liberated.
[7543] And further:
[7544] Through non-recognition itself self-occurred,
[7545] */ Cause of delusion from the beginning purified.
[7546] */ Kun-gzhi as dharmakaya self-appeared,
[7547] */ Stream of birth cut at the root.
[7548] */ Yid-bzhin dgongs-pa primordially abiding,
[7549] */ Movement-makers self-settled.
[7550] */ Breath from the beginning stream-cut,
[7551] */ Birth and death from the start nonexistent.
[7552] */ Desire's qualities primordially perfected,
[7553] */ Attachment's extreme is cultivation itself.
[7554] */ Limbs unmoved, primordially gone,
[7555] */ Beings' path from the beginning traversed.
[7556] */ Spoken speech inexpressible,
[7557] */ From the beginning beyond speech and thought's object.
[7558] */ Thought's emanation-gather primordially empty,
[7559] */ From the beginning abiding in great meditation.
[7560] */ Defilements self-purified,
[7561] */ Defilement-less great zang-thal abiding.
[7562] */ Through made-by not having arising-place,
[7563] */ From the very beginning free of action and actor.
[7564] */ From basis other-arisen dharma not existing,
[7565] */ From the beginning self-occurred single-alone.
[7566] */ One and two's number exhausted,
[7567] */ Thig-le free from moon.
[7568] */ Darkness from the beginning thoroughly purified,
[7569] */ Rig-pa's appearance luminosity-pervading.
[7570] */ Samsara changeless, ceased-finished,
[7571] */ From the beginning spontaneously-perfect buddha-ground.
[7572] */ Sign's entity empty-purified,
[7573] */ Self-grasping thought from the beginning exhausted.
[7574] */ Conditions by conditions self-liberated,
[7575] */ Reference-points are cog-bzhag.
[7576] Thus.
