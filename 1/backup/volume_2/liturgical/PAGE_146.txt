[6207] [6207] From the Self-Dawning:
[6208] [6208] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6209] [6209] No view, meditation, or conduct.
[6210] [6210] Yet hold well-taught in mind.
[6211] [6211] Without accomplishing, without wishing to move ability,
[6212] [6212] The meaning of that itself, spontaneously complete without doing, as before.
[6213] [6213] Where are doings and doers?
[6214] [6214] This self-arisen dharmata without conduct,
[6215] [6215] Not falling in any direction, like space,
[6216] [6216] Not existence—only oneness of emptiness,
[6217] [6217] Not non-existence—true bliss body,
[6218] [6218] Not made—self-arisen, concept-free.
[6219] [6219] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6220] [6220] Where is dharmata of meditation?
[6221] [6221] Dharma without sending or keeping,
[6222] [6222] Free from end of meditated and non-meditated.
[6223] [6223] What defilement of hold-free mind?
[6224] [6224] True awareness without defilement;
[6225] [6225] Upon stainless pure dharmakaya,
[6226] [6226] Nothing to meditate or be meditated.
[6227] [6227] Not finding true itself by meditating;
[6228] [6228] If found, self-awareness becomes non-existent.
[6229] [6229] Why? In self-awareness wisdom,
[6230] [6230] Without distracted or non-distracted.
[6231] [6231] Where there is holding,
[6232] [6232] Self-arisen wisdom does not exist.
[6233] [6235] That also: dharmas thus:
[6234] [6236] No ceasing from non-birth;
[6235] [6237] Free at self-place from non-holding;
[6236] [6238] No elaboration from non-reference;
[6237] [6239] Existing in all, not arisen from making;
[6238] [6240] Fully pure expanse through unconditioned;
[6239] [6241] Term of holding separate from dharmas;
[6240] [6242] Separate from expression through non-nature.
[6241] [6244] From the Nor bu phra bkod:
[6242] [6245] Ha ha!
[6243] [6246] Dharmata arising from non-dharma;
[6244] [6247] Object-like vision from non-object;
[6245] [6248] Dharma-free wisdom interiorly clear,
[6246] [6249] Memoryless: non-existent as object.
[6247] [6251] From the Seng ge rtsal rdzogs:
[6248] [6252] This entity-free dharmata without holding-attachment,
[6249] [6253] Supreme non-dual intention of all Buddhas.
[6250] [6254] Discrimination and marks, path of words,
[6251] [6255] Self-place pure dharmata without action-effort,
[6252] [6256] Ub chub samadhi entering dharmata-object.
[6253] [6257] Pure and impure terms non-existent as dharmas;
[6254] [6258] Primordially abiding meaning exceeding one and two,
[6255] [6259] Ub by one bindu in the manner of self-body.
