[10607] Know demonic deception at that time.
[10608] Of the second, uncommon supreme secret signs made manifest—three aspects:
[10609] General showing of body, speech, and mind signs of preliminary training;
[10610] Particular explanation of clear-light signs of main training;
[10611] Expression of other distinctions of signs, grasping the measure of the path.
[10612] Of the first, from three aspects:
[10613] Signs of nose-training of three kayas, preliminary training of four elements' sound and meaning.
[10614] From Blazing Relics:
[10615] What sounds of elements,
[10616] Who is familiar with sounds of six races,
[10617] Elements do not harm this,
[10618] Likewise fire does not burn,
[10619] Water does not drown nor carry away,
[10620] Foot not touching ground,
[10621] Able to go through mid-space,
[10622] Wind does not chill nor shake—
[10623] Thus in whom these arise,
[10624] Is familiar with four elements' sounds.
[10625] Signs of mind nose-training, preliminary training measure of body, speech, and mind:
[10626] From that:
[10627] Knowing in an instant
[10628] Beings appearing and not appearing,
[10629] Because six races do not take form,
[10630] Know sounds of six beings,
[10631] Because six beings' mind-continuum is self-cut,
[10632] Know all their thoughts,
[10633] Because confusion thought is exhausted—
[10634] Briefly, six clairvoyances arise,
[10635] Six beings' appearance
[10636] Abides in own nature,
[10637] Cutting later birth-continuum.
[10638] Thus this person cuts,
[10639] All these own signs arise.
[10640] Signs of awareness nose-training, separating samsara-nirvana border:
[10641] From that also:
[10642] Before separating samsara-nirvana border,
[10643] Body, speech, and mind go,
[10644] Familiar in conduct,
[10645] Thus tantra signs arise.
[10646] Body attachment self-reverses,
[10647] Confusion attachment continuum cuts,
[10648] No attachment to own body,
[10649] Conduct in sky,
[10650] Likewise able to enter ground,
[10651] Knowing thought and non-thought meaning,
[10652] Dharma also speaks from mouth.
[10653] Thus in whom these arise,
[10654] By body, speech, and mind,
[10655] Is liberated from all
[10656] Samsara realization bondage,
[10657] Later body, speech, mind connection cuts.
