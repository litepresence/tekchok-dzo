[12307] For dharma alone benefits; other than dharma, nothing reaches benefit. From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:
[12308] Here father, mother, relatives,
[12309] Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;
[12310] Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.
[12311] Except these quality-possessors,
[12312] No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.
[12313] From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:
[12314] As time's danger, king becoming to go,
[12315] Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;
[12316] Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,
[12317] Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.
[12318] Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay: having obtained such difficult leisure, yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded, like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation dharma.
[12319] Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion? From the Ratnagotra Tantra:
[12320] In coarse element forms,
[12321] Alas, no ground to sit;
[12322] To birth-being's stable life breath,
[12323] Alas, time does not strike;
[12324] In group six's object appearance,
[12325] Alas, nothing permanent;
[12326] In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,
[12327] Alas, nothing exhausts;
[12328] In suffering arisen from body,
[12329] Alas, nothing pure—thus.
[12330] Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused. Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others, enemies conquered, lands obtained—yet doing whatever, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.
