[2912] [2912] Able to transfer upon self-sickness, human, animal, tree, stone, etc., by those well-mastered in wind, and—
[2913] [2913] Able to transfer other-sickness upon other.
[2914] [2914] This time, transfer guru's sickness upon other, and—
[2915] [2915] Do not transfer upon inanimate other than transfer upon inanimate.
[2916] [2916] Because contradicts abandoning harm to sentient-beings from mantra-samaya.
[2917] [2917] And do not transfer sickness in nature.
[2918] [2918] Born to purify self-other's obscurations, and—
[2919] [2919] Because transferred also arises again.
[2920] [2920] Because instant-transferred also karma not transferred, because arises from karma.
[2921] [2921] From Thalgyur:
[2922] [2922] Two types of transfer-action.
[2923] [2923] Actual itself, emptiness.
[2924] [2924] Actual included by form.
[2925] [2925] From mastering elements thus.
[2926] [2926] And made depending upon familiarized wind.
[2927] [2927] Upon whatever actual-form.
[2928] [2928] Able to move by placed awareness.
[2929] [2929] Then begin actual-transfer.
[2930] [2930] Chief is familiarized emptiness-mind.
[2931] [2931] Dharma-space, dharma-body.
[2932] [2932] Know by non-dual practice-emptiness.
[2933] [2933] Upon emptiness-clear nature.
[2934] [2934] Mind also within that's state.
[2935] [2935] By complete dependent-arising ritual.
[2936] [2936] Method of releasing point-transfer, and.
[2937] [2937] Know from voice-recitation.
[2938] [2938] By each element-body meeting.
[2939] [2939] Do transfer by seeing only.
[2940] [2940] By skilled wind-joined.
[2941] [2941] However, if reached upon actual-accomplishment.
[2942] [2942] Accomplish all actions by invisible-form.
[2943] [2943] If see substance of actual-attachment.
[2944] [2944] Take by transfer because offer to guru.
[2945] [2945] Do not do other.
[2946] [2946] Thus, mount, form, etc.
[2947] [2947] If hero-guru commands.
[2948] [2948] Take this also by familiarized wind.
[2949] [2949] By possessing attract-mind.
[2950] [2950] Do transfer by yogi.
[2951] [2951] Thus it is.
[2952] [2952] Accomplish transfer by mastering wind of all four elements in nature, and.
[2953] [2953] Accomplish by especially mastering karma-wind.
[2954] [2954] Transfer is also appearance-mind mixed, power obtained over elements.
[2955] [2955] Not only transfer sickness alone, bliss-suffering fixation, and.
