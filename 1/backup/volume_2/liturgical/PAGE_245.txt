[10551] Dreaming of the gods' lord placing one upon a four-footed jewel throne, lifting into sky and traveling;
[10552] Dreaming of naga lords raining jewels upon oneself;
[10553] Dreaming of bardo visions arising;
[10554] Dreaming of sitting upon an elephant, four powerful men lifting by the four feet, rising through sky's depths;
[10555] Dreaming of dwelling atop a golden wheel, leaping three times into sky.
[10556] Thus spoke the Blazing Relics Tantra Commentary.
[10557] Of the third, signs of obstacles:
[10558] Knowing emanation of body into various forms;
[10559] Light emanating from the body;
[10560] Sounds arising in whatever direction one goes;
[10561] Power entering others;
[10562] Gatherings assembling;
[10563] Crafting superimpositions of words.
[10564] When these signs greatly manifest in a person, they indicate obstacles arising. In such times, sit in water mandala, insert a sixteen-finger wooden stick into the nape, smear the body with sandalwood oil, and meditate coarsely upon outer and inner things—this certainly dispels.
[10565] When knowing emanation from demonic blessings, examine and see the second reflection. Wash the body with dharani water, utter PHAT, and meditate on emptiness like sky—this dispels.
[10566] Moreover, when a yogin thinks they have realized reality without truly realizing it, demons of bliss enter. Realizing all as empty, entering the profane, thinking action and result cannot harm—know this is demonic deception.
[10567] When flesh-eating dakinis prophesy before one, when gatherings and the like accomplish small siddhis, when dakinis converse and formless sounds speak of good and bad, expound dharma—these come with subtle clairvoyance and conceit.
