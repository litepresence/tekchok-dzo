[8126] Khregs-chod: faculties six's gate not-pure, mind's dharma clear-seek from. Thod-rgal: pure luminosity's gate, ye-she's wind moved, lamp four's appearance arise—transcended.
[8127] That from:
[8128] */ Gate how arisen is,
[8129] */ Entering wind moved by.
[8130] */ Lamp four, actions four arisen.
[8131] Thus.
[8132] Sixth: khregs-chod see-not, rig-pa self-clear faculty clear-seek from. Thod-rgal: outer-inner ye-she zang-thal faculty, expanse and ye-she gather-separate not appearance, direct examine particular entered.
