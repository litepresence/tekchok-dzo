[12055] [12001] Ground-boundary of nature-remaining intermediate state.
[12056] [12002] Death-time intermediate state.
[12057] [12003] Dharmatā intermediate state.
[12058] [12004] Existence intermediate state.
[12059] [12005] First, ground-boundary of nature-remaining:
[12060] [12006] The nature remaining as the ground of all,
[12061] [12007] Primordially pure, spontaneously present.
[12062] [12008] Thus the ground-boundary of nature-remaining.
[12063] [12009] Second, death-time intermediate state:
[12064] [12010] From the moment of death until the clear light,
[12065] [12011] The dissolution of elements and consciousness.
[12066] [12012] Thus the death-time intermediate state.
[12067] [12013] Third, dharmatā intermediate state:
[12068] [12014] The clear light of dharmatā dawning,
[12069] [12015] Recognition brings liberation.
[12070] [12016] Thus the dharmatā intermediate state.
[12071] [12017] Fourth, existence intermediate state:
[12072] [12018] From the dharmatā clear light until conception,
[12073] [12019] The wandering in the bardo of becoming.
[12074] [12020] Thus the existence intermediate state.
[12075] [12021] Herein, the duration:
[12076] [12022] The death-time lasts until the clear light.
[12077] [12023] The dharmatā lasts a maximum of four days.
[12078] [12024] The existence lasts a maximum of forty-nine days.
[12079] [12025] Thus the duration of intermediate states.
[12080] [12026] Herein, the appearances:
[12081] [12027] In death-time: dissolution of elements.  [12028] In dharmatā: clear light dawning.  [12029] In existence: karmic visions arising.  [12030] Thus the appearances.  [12031] Herein, the liberation:  [12032] In death-time: through recognition of dissolution.  [12033] In dharmatā: through recognition of clear light.  [12034] In existence: through recognition of illusory nature.  [12035] Thus liberation in intermediate states.  [12036] Herein, the preparation:  [12037] Through hearing, contemplating, and meditating,  [12038] Recognition is prepared for death and bardo.  [12039] Thus the preparation.  [12040] Herein, the importance:  [12041] Without preparation, wandering continues.  [12042] With preparation, liberation is certain.  [12043] Thus the importance of preparation.  [12044] Thus the four intermediate states are explained.  [12045] Thus the instructions on intermediate states are complete.
