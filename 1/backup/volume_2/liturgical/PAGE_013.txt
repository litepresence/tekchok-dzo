[636] [636] Together with all bones,
[637] [637] Together with all blood,
[638] [638] Together with all lymph,
[639] [639] Abiding within two eyes, moistening without essence-holding.
[640] [640] Fifth, the five spaces:
[641] [641] Again, from Self-Arisen it is taught:
[642] [642] The five spaces are:
[643] [643] All-common-pervading space,
[644] [644] Object-free clear-tone space,
[645] [645] Pure unmixed space,
[646] [646] Meaning-indicating space,
[647] [647] Pure-field liberating space—thus.
[648] [648] These also, in sequence,
[649] [649] Together with actual awareness,
[650] [650] Together with five lights,
[651] [651] Together with pure-expanse lamp,
[652] [652] Together with signs' wisdom,
[653] [653] Together with twenty-one pointing-out instructions, example-meaning certain confidence.
[654] [654] Thus, five elements' awareness summarized attributes are the great elements,
[655] [655] While their basis is the small elements.
[656] [656] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[657] [657] The fifteenth division: Showing the Elements' Place.
[658] [658] Thus, having established elements' nature as basis,
[659] [659] Now, the supported's fourfold purity: expanse and wisdom:
[660] [660] Basis: kayas,
[661] [661] Tone: light,
[662] [662] Supported: wisdom,
[663] [663] Activities: enlightened actions.
[664] [664] First, basis-kayas' extensive division has two parts:
[665] [665] Three kayas' expanse general presentation, and
[666] [666] Five kayas' enumeration particular explanation.
[667] [667] The first has: kayas' definition brief presentation, and
[668] [668] Place extensive explanation.
[669] [669] The first is:
[670] [670] Though essence is one, three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects—
[671] [671] From Self-Arisen:
[672] [672] Three kayas, wisdom-appearance,
[673] [673] Without obstruction to anything,
[674] [674] Perceived objects being one,
[675] [675] Essence appearing individually.
[676] [676] Thus it is said.
[677] [677] This is awareness-itself's appearance manner:
[678] [678] From that same source:
[679] [679] Thought-free awareness is dharmakaya's essence,
[680] [680] Uncensored clear awareness is sambhogakaya,
[681] [681] Whatever-appearing awareness is nirmanakaya.
[682] [682] Thus it is said.
[683] [683] In this, complete,
[684] [684] Awakened.
