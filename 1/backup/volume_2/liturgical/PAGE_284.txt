[12251] Difficult to be born: born in the place of dharma exercise from karma-ground of Jambu-continent. Difficult to obtain: obtaining leisure with endowments. Difficult to meet: meeting master virtuous friend. Difficult to enter: entering the door of holy dharma jewel. Difficult to know: knowing unsurpassed instruction exactly not wrong. Difficult to abandon: abandoning samsara's suffering ocean, the time to go to liberation's buddha-continent—now if not accomplished producing effort and courage, later such favorable conditions complete are not possible. Therefore appropriate to meditate day and night in profound meaning without opportunity for leisure-freedom.
[12252] From the presence of Arya Nagarjuna:
[12253] Remaining in favorable land,
[12254] Relying on holy birth-beings,
[12255] Virtue arisen from before-training good prayers by self,
[12256] You possess the four great wheels—thus.
[12257] From the presence of Arya Shantideva:
[12258] This leisure endowment is greatly difficult to obtain;
[12259] For the birth-being who has obtained purpose accomplishment,
[12260] If effort is not made in this,
[12261] Where will proper obtainment be later?
[12262] Having obtained such leisure,
[12263] If effort is not made now,
[12264] Go to negative path as corpse of the dead;
[12265] In billions of hundred-thousand kalpas,
[12266] Not even hearing the sound of happy path,
[12267] What need to mention obtaining happy path?—thus said.
[12268] That too: all this present pleasure-pain and appearance become from before karma; later appearance is produced by present karma. Those who did evil karma before ripen here as incomplete faculties, crooked limbs, etc., ugly forms, poor, become under others' power. Those who gathered good karma before, here clear faculties, beautiful forms, pleasing to the mind when seen.
