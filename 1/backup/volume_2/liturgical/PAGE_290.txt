[12482] There in beautiful medicine tree flower grove,
[12483] Possessing cloud canopy of peaceful dharma manner,
[12484] By flickering gold light of awareness-holder conqueror,
[12485] May one life's clear-light essence be accomplished!
[12486] From liberation's mansion jewel palace,
[12487] By resounding tone of peaceful dharma manner drum sound,
[12488] All goers not remaining wake from ignorance sleep,
[12489] May manifestly buddha in original ground!
[12490] The clear-natured one with weariness-mind,
[12491] Desiring to go one-along to peaceful forest,
[12492] Speaking tone of wished words from heart:
[12493] May quickly accomplish by pure faith virtue!
[12494] Thus called are interval verses.
[12495] Second, examining death's signs from the Thal-logical Result:
[12496] Death's signs also twenty-one;
[12497] Gone to solitary charnel-ground direction,
[12498] Do worship and give to master;
[12499] Also by eating and drinking,
[12500] Do please other goers;
[12501] From that, also examine outer, inner, secret death signs—thus said.
[12502] All ordinary not knowing when die,
[12503] Transcended in distinction from world outsiders examining by divination, pra, etc.;
[12504] Yogin's seizing time certainly:
[12505] Gone to person-not-exist valley empty, retreat, charnel-ground, forest-retreat, mountain valley, etc., doing life form examination, etc.
[12506] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12507] At the time of death-lord demon rising,
[12508] Thus examine death-time intermediate state;
[12509] In solitary place or valley empty,
[12510] Precious to seize death's time—thus.
[12511] Examining actual: from uncommon and common. First, from that self: form-reflection in sky's space, becoming impermanent and dissolving, moon-form not existing is death. Limb four break in four months; above that head break in three months; upper lower divide in two months; roll in fist in one month—know that time.
[12512] Sky-earth two's connection-rope: if becoming cut, not able more than nineteen days. From Meru's sides, not falling from white lion, not liberated by sixteen days. If at mountain and plain boundary, wish-fulfilling tree waist breaks—these also examine by wise one.
