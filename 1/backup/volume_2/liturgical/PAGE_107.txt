[4749] Gaze awareness at sky empty—
[4750] Field compatible with sky, experience empty,
[4751] Clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns.
[4752] Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristic.
[4753] From Mind Section:
[4754] Yogin abides in sky's bird-path.
[4755] Thus said, and:
[4756] From Collection:
[4757] Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning.
[4758] Thus said, and:
[4759] From Middle Mother:
[4760] Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
[4761] Is making sky-yogin, said, etc.—scriptures immeasurable.
[4762] That also: field outer-inner mixed,
[4763] Called equal limitless view;
[4764] Called dhatu-awareness non-dual view;
[4765] Called dhatu-awareness mixed, samsara-nirvana taste equal view.
[4766] This same, from Instruction-Child also:
[4767] Dhatu and awareness gaze manner,
[4768] Sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.
[4769] Thus spoken.
[4770] Third, wind-awareness main-point:
[4771] When field and gate two meet,
[4772] Rely on slow wind, called capturing awareness.
[4773] That also: somehow slow wind,
[4774] Shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point.
[4775] That also: wind and slow cause—
[4776] Outer: become yogin's life-extending helper;
[4777] Inner: make cause for conceptuality to cease;
[4778] Secret: do action of awareness direct seeing;
[4779] Actual: make buddha, not seeing contaminated.
[4780] That thus, also from Thalgyur:
[4781] Make wind somehow slow,
[4782] Arising from fully projecting,
[4783] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4784] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4785] Thus said, and:
[4786] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom,
[4787] Arising from fully projecting,
[4788] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4789] Not reversing even in three realms.  Thus said, and:  Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom.  Thus it was said.  Awareness main-point: hanging-cord, place in dhatu fence, make not move.
