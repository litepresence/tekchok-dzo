[3018] [3018] Is certainty taken self-experience.
[3019] [3019] Second, actual—three:
[3020] [3020] Dharmata-meaning point,
[3021] [3021] Means, and—
[3022] [3022] Focus point,
[3023] [3023] Channel-wind binding point.
[3024] [3024] From three: train, transform, cut.
[3025] [3025] Meditate all three—very difficult, and—
[3026] [3026] Yet also said whichever one enough—easy, two medium.
[3027] [3027] Train all in practice when do guide this—meditate all time.
[3028] [3028] First train dream—day appearances all—last night's dreamed dream—clear aspiration—made emanate-transform, and.
[3029] [3029] Train outer truth-without time—training-rigpa look—arise-arise base-without, root-free nature—naked, clearly meditate.
[3030] [3030] All fixation-without, truth-without, base-without, recognition-without—recognize appearances' nature—one-pointed—meditate without losing effort-force—appearances only—actually illusion-dream arise—karma, latency, deluded-appearance, deluded-grasping all cease.
[3031] [3031] And arise without distraction from that state within dream.
[3032] [3032] Day-night dharmata-wheel—not beyond.
[3033] [3033] Dream-transform from appearance-emptiness two.
[3034] [3034] Appearance-transform point—depend made upon showing deity-form in mirror, and.
[3035] [3035] Transform all appearances to deity's mandala, and—
[3036] [3036] Transform to Buddha's realm, and—
[3037] [3037] Do by fierce aspiration transforming illusion's eight-examples.
[3038] [3038] Transform emptiness—like smoke clearing, cloud gathering in sky.
[3039] [3039] Moment-emptiness deluded-appearance—wide flat flat meditate.
[3040] [3040] Become that thus within dream.
[3041] [3041] Upon this itself how appear time—dream cut.
[3042] [3042] Not establish rigpa-hold top intermediate-space.
[3043] [3043] Not hold appearance form-reflection top here-rig.
[3044] [3044] Not confused by thought of connection between appearance-mind two.
