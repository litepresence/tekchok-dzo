[8303] In viewing, the essential point is to gaze unmoving at the midst of the sky's expanse, like unto a waterfall's cascade. And thus, from the letterless state:
[8304] */ Rig-pa resting in equipoise—this upadesa itself,
[8305] */ This the secret thig-le of enlightened intent.
[8306] */ The eyes held steadfast in absorption,
[8307] */ And thus examined apart from gathering and dispersal.
[8308] */ From the very corner of the eyes the expanse emerges,
[8309] */ Light subtle and swirling arises.
[8310] */ Its nature: lu-gu-rgyud itself,
[8311] */ Subtle, flickering, and mobile.
[8312] */ The eyes examined as the element of space,
[8313] */ The thig-le of the Buddha-body dawns.
[8314] */ Attaining the warmth of that very dgongs-pa,
[8315] */ Rig-pa's body—lu-gu-rgyud itself—
[8316] */ Together with the body, appearance dawns.
[8317] Thus.
[8318] Furthermore, at this juncture, establishing the three points of luminosity: the manner of mind's obscurations being purified in the dgongs-pa of essence; the manner of resting evenly unmoving in the state; and from that, the manner of signs, measures, and definitive time dawning. Of these three, the first has three aspects: the dgongs-pa of essence itself; the metaphor demonstrating mind and habitual patterns; and the essential summary of the manner of separation from these.
[8319] Of the first, from the Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind:
[8320] */ In the unmoving sky, rig-pa clear like unto it,
[8321] */ Clear yet unwavering—depth unfathomable.
[8322] */ Empty-luminosity, vast and open, in the great bliss expanse I wander,
[8323] */ Single-pointed clarity in the state of dharmata expanse.
[8324] */ Unmixed and perfected, established in spontaneous presence.
[8325] Thus.
[8326] The nature of rig-pa, wherein the four wisdoms self-manifest as one's own rtsal, demonstrates the natural state of superior seeing. The four wisdoms, from Rang shar:
[8327] Furthermore, regarding the nature of rig-pa:
[8328] */ The fourfold wisdom it possesses,
[8329] */ These four wisdoms are thus:
[8330] */ The liberating wisdom—
[8331] */ Liberates all completely.
[8332] */ Liberates into the pure field of kleshas,
[8333] */ Liberates into the state free from concept and birth,
[8334] */ Liberates into the expanse of rig-pa from non-recognition,
[8335] */ Liberates conceptual wisdom into the state.
[8336] */ Therefore, the liberating wisdom.
[8337] */ The activating wisdom—
[8338] */ Activates the five bodies into pure expanse,
[8339] */ Activates the five lights into non-grasping expanse,
[8340] */ Activates rig-pa ye-shes into expanse,
[8341] */ Activates the lamp into space-expanse.
[8342] */ Therefore, the activating wisdom.
[8343] */ The gathering wisdom—
[8344] */ Gathers elements into the five lights,
[8345] */ Gathers space into the lamp,
[8346] */ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
[8347] */ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
[8348] */ Therefore, the gathering wisdom—
[8349] */ Gathers elements into the five lights,
[8350] */ Gathers space into the lamp,
[8351] */ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
[8352] */ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
[8353] */ Therefore, the gathering wisdom.
[8354] */ The discriminating wisdom—
[8355] */ Discriminates non-recognition and rig-pa as two,
[8356] */ Discriminates kleshas and ye-shes as two,
[8357] */ Discriminates pure and impure as two,
[8358] */ Discriminates samsara and nirvana as two,
[8359] */ Discriminates realization and non-realization as two,
[8360] */ Discriminates good and bad as two.
[8361] */ Therefore, the discriminating wisdom.
[8362] Thus.
[8363] Furthermore, the second: through the purification at that very time of mind and habitual patterns—the objects to be purified by dgongs-pa...
