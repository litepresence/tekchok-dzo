[7491] [7491] Also not thus peace itself;
[7492] [7492] Not knowing direct insight:
[7493] [7493] Like Meru mountain king,
[7494] [7494] Not capable to break by whoever.
[7495] [7495] Not liberate by antidote;
[7496] [7496] Not knowing self-pure without searching:
[7497] [7497] Like desiring clear sediment in muddy water,
[7498] [7498] Not clear later-later.
[7499] [7499] Although that itself clear: not dharmata;
[7500] [7500] Not knowing spontaneous self-appearance: like ordinary fool appearance,
[7501] [7501] Not reverse apparent attachment.
[7502] [7502] By thus saying: should know vital point of self-by-self liberating like water trace.
[7503] [7503] This also: from two mind levels—
[7504] [7504] Self-liberation with effort:
[7505] [7505] Identify whatever arisen affliction, place in self-place—train power in great equal self-liberation of pure abiding-movement nature, self-liberating complete complete gone without wandering even moment.
[7506] [7506] Without effort:
[7507] [7507] That arisen incapable to bear, self-liberated dharmata—
[7508] [7508] Liberate by nature nature or force without needing abandon that view-method to that.
[7509] [7509] These two mind levels: first distinction and
[7510] [7510] Abide like before-after.
[7511] [7511] From That Itself:
[7512] [7512] These two mind levels:
[7513] [7513] All with effort and without effort.
[7514] [7514] Place all with effort in self-place,
[7515] [7515] All measures of familiarized appearance:
[7516] [7516] Itself pure primordial wisdom appearance.
[7517] [7517] When self-dawning to all outer-inner,
[7518] [7518] Not arise by that condition.
[7519] [7519] Although those arise-change until,
[7520] [7520] Liberate in self-place itself by self-place.
[7521] [7521] From that: yogi appearance.
[7522] [7522] All without effort thus:
[7523] [7523] Self-by-self liberated to self itself,
[7524] [7524] From self blank self self-liberated—
[7525] [7525] Like splitting all iron by iron, and
[7526] [7526] Like breaking all stone by stone:
[7527] [7527] Self antidote self itself great,
[7528] [7528] By realizing nature complete great.
[7529] [7529] Whatever familiarized thus:
[7530] [7530] Find all meanings of non-searching placing,
[7531] [7531] Spread great bliss without meditating,
[7532] [7532] Directly know in nature itself.
