[11619] Self-clear five colors.
[11620] Continuum: from beyond two gathering of pure elements and familiar awareness own-tone, arises at time.
[11621] Division: by occasion—upward-stand, wing-arise, rim three; or like ladder sky-piercing insert, reaching sky center appearing as light house.
[11622] Result: if rim arises, liberate in first bardo; if upward-stand sky-pierce like arises, liberate without reality bardo by primordially-pure transparent-penetrate; if wing-arise, liberate at last bardo life.
[11623] If light ladder like inserts around died body or house or crematorium, liberates in wisdom four union in samadhi seven days; if light house like arises, liberates in five days upon mass appearance.
[11624] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11625] Light two:
[11626] Light arising as house way,
[11627] Light upward-stand ladder way.
[11628] That light house like obtains stability from five days, complete buddha.
[11629] That light ladder like complete buddha in seven days.
[11630] From Blazing Relics:
[11631] Light form three:
[11632] With rim around,
[11633] From whatever trace arises,
[11634] This in first bardo,
[11635] Obtain certain result.
[11636] If upward stand,
[11637] This bardo not appearing,
[11638] Buddha in instant.
[11639] If light appears from wing,
[11640] This in last bardo,
[11641] Obtain complete awakening.
[11642] That spontaneously-accomplished appearance emanation spreads, from that state emanation out-emanates to world ten directions also for beings' benefit—own-appearance reflection beings six and other-appearance self-character beings two fields, two emanations doing benefit.
