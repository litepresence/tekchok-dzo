[6489] [6489] "The supreme path of peace without cause and condition."
[6490] [6490] Thus explained, and so forth.
[6491] [6491] Therefore, if mind exists,
[6492] [6492] Does entity possess form,
[6493] [6493] Or exist formlessly?
[6494] [6494] It does not possess form—for if it existed, it would be suitable for sense-power's direct perception; clear through valid cognition of direct perception not observing the suitable-for-seeing.
[6495] [6495] If it exists formlessly, how is it known?
[6496] [6496] If known through movement,
[6497] [6497] That movement is merely needed, direction-part,
[6498] [6498] And past-future-present three meeting—unestablished through examination.
[6499] [6499] If former movement and present movement meet, the meeting-part's former memory-thought would need to exist now without ceasing;
[6500] [6500] If it existed, this contradicts being former.
[6501] [6501] If present's former and that part cease, and they do not meet, present memory-thought would have no cause—movement is unsuitable, thus stopped.
[6502] [6502] Is movement one or different?
[6503] [6503] If one, the becoming-various is lost;
[6504] [6504] If different, since move-maker is one, it is lost.
[6505] [6505] Thus, mind's existence is unestablished,
[6506] [6506] Realizing like rootless sky.
[6507] [6507] Birth and birth-basis not existing, no returning place.
[6508] [6508] Place not existing, memory-thought before-after interval facing-introduces, dissolving there—recognizing no basis in mind.
[6509] [6509] Knowing that, faith in no returning place.
[6510] [6510] Knowing that, deciding upon the great namelessness of three realms.
[6511] [6511] Through that dharma, mind's ease without benefit-harm of virtuous and vicious actions.
[6512] [6512] Moreover, appearance-knowing before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6513] [6513] Recognizing mind's non-establishment as cause and characteristic.
[6514] [6514] Knowing that, faith in no identifying-grasping of mind's emptiness itself.
[6515] [6515] Believing that, deciding mind does not arise from causes and conditions.
[6516] [6516] Through that dharma, mind's ease without benefit-harm from sudden memory-thoughts' thoughts.
[6517] [6517] Moreover, mind's ease.
[6518] [6518] Moreover, mind before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6519] [6519] Recognizing no root in mind.
[6520] [6520] Knowing that, faith in no different elaborations in mind's single wheel.
[6521] [6521] Believing that, deciding buddhahood not achieved through fabricated dharmas.
