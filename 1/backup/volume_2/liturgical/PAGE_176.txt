[7452] [7452] General show meaning of self-liberation:
[7453] [7453] Particular explanation of primordially liberated actual meaning,
[7454] [7454] Extensive speaking of self-liberated intention.
[7455] [7455] First:
[7456] [7456] Here at Ati Vajra Heart Essence, king of paths certain release from affliction:
[7457] [7457] By not abandoning affliction, pure in place—
[7458] [7458] Not like hearers abandoning,
[7459] [7459] Not like beings abandoning,
[7460] [7460] Not like lower mantra transforming generation stage,
[7461] [7461] Not like complete stage releasing self-dissolution,
[7462] [7462] Not like common vehicle generally taming by antidote,
[7463] [7463] Not like mind section placing in self-manner,
[7464] [7464] Not like space section purifying by making that itself dharmata.
[7465] [7465] Why?
[7466] [7466] If not knowing affliction that primordially exists without experiencing,
[7467] [7467] Not abandon by abandoning.
[7468] [7468] If abandoning affliction by mind,
[7469] [7469] Impossible to purify by two substance one of abandon-object abandon-agent;
[7470] [7470] If abandoning by primordial wisdom, mind not see primordial wisdom;
[7471] [7471] By primordial wisdom not seeing mind—impossible term of abandon-object abandon-agent at contradiction of non-abiding together, and
[7472] [7472] No abandoning by before-after, for past-future substance oppose;
[7473] [7473] One exist at time, one cease;
[7474] [7474] If time equal: conclude abandon-object to antidote by mutual mixing, and
[7475] [7475] Conclude antidote to abandon-object,
[7476] [7476] For one continuum mind time equal.
[7477] [7477] Also: no time to abandon by abandoning at body and shadow like of affliction arising from mind that itself.
[7478] [7478] Apply also to purifying etc.
[7479] [7479] From Sun-Moon Union:
[7480] [7480] If not realize suchness,
[7481] [7481] Like yogi body and shadow,
[7482] [7482] From that self-arising that itself—
[7483] [7483] Not abandon by abandoning.
[7484] [7484] Also not by thus purifying,
[7485] [7485] Also not change by transforming.
[7486] [7486] Not realize unchangeable heart essence:
[7487] [7487] Like crystal rock or turquoise stone,
[7488] [7488] Not capable to purify and melt.
[7489] [7489] By nature abide pure—
[7490] [7490] Investigate by possessing yogi.
