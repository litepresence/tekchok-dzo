[7923] Salt all's taste certainty reached, or molasses and fire—one recognition, knowing all knowing—like.
[7924] From Byang-chub-sems-'grel:
[7925] */ Fire's nature heat,
[7926] */ Molasses nature sweet like.
[7927] */ Thus dharmas all also,
[7928] */ Nature empty single.
[7929] Thus like.
[7930] Thus liberation-manner five, person one calculate not—faculties' difference by, what aspiration, liberation is.
[7931] Third: liberation-manner five's conclusion five show. That also here: liberation-manner five those reference-basis apart. Rang-grol is: grasping view, meditation, conduct dharma's reference apart. Conditions conditions by liberated—example like dirt by dirt washed. Condition bad, condition bad by liberated, ye-she's companion appear. Ka-dag ka-dag by liberated, rig-pa rig-pa by liberated.
[7932] Ye-grol: grasping-grasped unity reference apart. Objects objects by liberated—poison by poisons destroyed like.
[7933] Cer-grol: samsara-nirvana two not-referenced, cause causes liberated—example iron by iron cut like.
[7934] Mtha'-grol: convention word not-referenced, dharma dharma liberated's example—wood from arisen fire, that wood that burned like.
[7935] Gcig-grol: liberating-doer thought not-referenced, mind-itself mind liberated's example—stone by stones cut like.
[7936] From Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
[7937] */ Conditions conditions by liberated because,
[7938] */ Grasping dharmas to not-reference.
[7939] */ Objects objects liberated to,
[7940] */ Grasping-grasped two not-reference.
[7941] */ Cause cause liberated to,
[7942] */ Samsara-nirvana two not-reference.
[7943] */ Dharma dharma liberated to,
[7944] */ Convention word not-reference.
[7945] */ Mind-itself mind liberated to,
[7946] */ Indicating-doer thought not-reference.
[7947] */ Dirt by dirt washed like,
[7948] */ Thus pure pure liberated.
[7949] */ Poison's poisons destroyed,
[7950] */ Iron's irons cut,
[7951] */ Stone's stones severed,
[7952] */ Wood's woods burned like.
[7953] */ Self-self enemy self does,
[7954] */ Lineage not-different liberation not.
[7955] Thus.
[7956] That-also: all rig-pa complete not-existing's essence by, rig-pa liberated time, dharmas all liberated—support-basis destroyed, support-dharma destroy like...
