[8415] [8415] Spontaneously accomplished as one's own passed nature is—
[8416] [8416] From Samantabhadra's mind mirror:
[8417] [8417] Awareness separated from mind is actual buddhahood,
[8418] [8418] Wisdom separated from intellect is actual intent,
[8419] [8419] Light rays separated from interior are actual pure appearance.
[8420] [8420] Thus it is said, and
[8421] [8421] From Self-Arising:
[8422] [8422] Awareness separated from mind is actual buddhahood,
[8423] [8423] I, Vajrasattva, separated from intellect,
[8424] [8424] Know without concept in clarifying appearance,
[8425] [8425] Concept-free discriminating awareness equality is
[8426] [8426] Great self-liberation through itself.
[8427] [8427] Thus it is said.
[8428] [8428] Second, the proof is:
[8429] [8429] By placing unmoved in the nature of appearance, samsara dharmas go to self-awakening—like sediment self-awakening through unmoved water.
[8430] [8430] Showing intent difficult to measure in depth through the metaphor of a jewel in clear water—
[8431] [8431] From the previous:
[8432] [8432] This drop of self-arising nectar,
[8433] [8433] Like a jewel in clear water,
[8434] [8434] When possessing sediment is placed, the sediment clears.
[8435] [8435] Thus this heart pith instruction,
[8436] [8436] When applied, afflictions do not become stains.
[8437] [8437] Thus and:
[8438] [8438] Single and alone, easily appearing as companion,
[8439] [8439] In the unborn expanse, clear light wisdom,
[8440] [8440] Exists in all, yet seen by none.
[8441] [8441] Like the sky's expanse, immeasurable by measure,
[8442] [8442] Like the sun's light, clear and shining,
[8443] [8443] Like Mount Meru, king of mountains, unchanging,
[8444] [8444] Like the ocean's depth, deep and difficult to measure,
[8445] [8445] Like the lotus of mud, without stain,
[8446] [8446] Like the moon in water, without face-grasping,
[8447] [8447] Like the sky's miracle, appearing as whatever,
[8448] [8448] Like the rainbow, clear and complete.
[8449] [8449] Thus it is said.
[8450] [8450] Third, speaking of other enumerations is:
[8451] [8451] All intent such as expanse and awareness dissolving into the single expanse of root awareness, cutting and deciding—
[8452] [8452] Again from that same source:
[8453] [8453] Deliver all meaning into the expanse without arising,
[8454] [8454] Make recognize the lamp of the enlightenment path,
[8455] [8455] Gather all dharmas into the nature separated from speech,
[8456] [8456] Deliver all tantras into the great tantra without letters, the great tantra of one's own awareness.
