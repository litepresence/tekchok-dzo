[6676] [6676] Thus to dwelling dharmata:
[6677] [6677] Delusion not-existing from the beginning,
[6678] [6678] In dharmakaya like sky,
[6679] [6679] Obscured by sudden beings' clouds.
[6680] [6680] Also non-deluded dwelling dharmata
[6681] [6681] Appears in mind as deluded manner.
[6682] [6683] Beings' five afflictions themselves:
[6683] [6684] In meaning, they do not exist—
[6684] [6685] Like clouds in sky,
[6685] [6686] Sudden, with conditions,
[6686] [6687] Clouds arise from sky itself.
[6687] [6688] Knowing thus dissolve into sky,
[6688] [6689] Called "non-different one nature."
[6689] [6690] Thus afflictions' stains themselves,
[6690] [6691] Knowing self-arising, self-ceasing,
[6691] [6692] How could beings be bound?
[6692] [6694] Appearance-manner unestablished like
[6693] [6695] Appearing as grasping, yet nowhere established—
[6694] [6696] Shown also as great placelessness.
[6695] [6697] From Heap of Jewels:
[6696] [6698] "This mind itself without dwelling place,
[6697] [6699] Without going place, wondrous!
[6698] [6700] To six minds entering all,
[6699] [6701] Without depending place, wondrous!
[6700] [6702] To all-gathering all-ground,
[6701] [6703] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6702] [6704] To circling-deluding ignorance,
[6703] [6705] Without changing power, wondrous!
[6704] [6706] To all object-attaching afflictions,
[6705] [6707] Without basis-root, wondrous!
[6706] [6708] To subtle and coarse stains,
[6707] [6709] Without grasping place, wondrous!
[6708] [6710] To coarse elemental forms,
[6709] [6711] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6710] [6712] To person's depending life-breath,
[6711] [6713] Without time-setting, wondrous!
[6712] [6714] To six aggregates' object appearances,
[6713] [6715] Without permanence, wondrous!
[6714] [6716] To person's arisen memory-thought feelings,
[6715] [6717] Without exhaustion, wondrous!"
[6716] [6720] "This basisless dharmata—
[6717] [6721] Great wonder, placed without searching!
[6718] [6722] To going-coming awareness—
[6719] [6723] Great wonder, without end!
[6720] [6724] To primordially dwelling great wisdom—
[6721] [6725] Great wonder, without antidote!"
[6722] [6727] Also from Arya Samadhi Raja, common vehicle:
[6723] [6728] "How in mid-space, little cloudless,
[6724] [6729] Momentarily cloud mandala appears,
[6725] [6730] Arising-ceasing, that cloud mandala—
[6726] [6731] Examine from what first it arose!
[6727] [6732] Know all dharmas thus.
[6728] [6733] How person dwells in rock mountain hollow,
[6729] [6734] From singing, speaking, laughing, crying,
[6730] [6735] Echoes arise depending on conditions,
[6731] [6736] Yet that tone from sound never moves.
[6732] [6737] Know all dharmas thus."
[6733] [6738] Extensively said.
[6734] [6739] Second meaning: face-introducing foundation primordial wisdom without move-change, copper-shining dharma-exhaust mind-transcend intention—three:
