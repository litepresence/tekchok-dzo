[10900] Fourth, kaya—five aspects:
[10901] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[10902] Essence: abiding as support of nirvana dharmas, nature always dwelling.
[10903] Definition: stainless transparent-penetrate, great self-complete.
[10904] Division: dharma-kaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya—three.
[10905] Though common vehicles consider three kayas as result, Great Perfection's system considers three kayas as path appearance. Dharma-kaya is own-appearance—as long as dharma exists, mind exists, this is path. As long as kaya exists, body exists, this is path appearance—not final.
[10906] This main reaching complete measure is exhaustion appearance, dissolving near primordially pure.
[10907] Sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are path appearance—various appearing dharmas exist in rank, not final extreme-free mark-free equality.
[10908] At measure-reaching time, kayas, fields, and teachers appear from spontaneously accomplished appearance.
[10909] Characteristic: path appearance clear-light empty nature.
[10910] Result: when primordially pure jewel secret inside moves, inner clear three kayas dwell only as arise-basis.
[10911] Familiarizing with such path appearance kaya reality, obtained appear-experience three kaya signs.

[10930] Plays in five kayas, five wisdoms,
[10931] By gaze of great play—
