[7965] Rang-grol self-destroy, basis expanse equalized is.
[7966] That from:
[7967] */ Therefore basis-abiding rig-pa to,
[7968] */ Self-appeared because appearance perfected.
[7969] */ Self-occurred because basis perfected,
[7970] */ Self-appearance because objects also perfected.
[7971] */ Rang-grol because delusion-basis perfected,
[7972] */ Rang-pure because path all perfected.
[7973] */ Rang-awareness because knowables perfected,
[7974] */ Rang-pervading because result perfected.
[7975] */ Rang-place because cause-conditions perfected,

[7980] */ Rang-known because instruction perfected.
[7981] */ Rang-settled because meditation perfected,
[7982] */ Rang-feature because expanse perfected.
[7983] Thus.
[7984] Thus perfected liberated rig-pa, that itself beginning from ka-dag is, dirt not-existing, heart is, continuum exhausted. Single-alone great-bliss, speech-thought expression beyond. Ye-from thoroughly-pure zang-ka, stone-with pure empty. General-appearance samsara-nirvana's projection-feature not-stained. Dharmas exhausted, movement-dissolved, inert-awareness beyond. Natural basis's buddha abiding.
[7985] From Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
[7986] */ E-ma rang-rdzogs-chen-po's dharmakaya:
[7987] */ Ka-from pure, dirt exhausted,
[7988] */ First arisen, continuum exhausted.
[7989] */ Moon apart, reckoning beyond,
[7990] */ Suffering cause-less, great-bliss.
[7991] */ Expression's cause-less, speech-thought beyond,
[7992] */ Ye-from self-awareness thoroughly-pure.
[7993] */ Outflows exhausted, stone-with not,
[7994] */ Entity exhausted, empty abiding.
[7995] */ Two's increase-not, essence,
[7996] */ Dharma apart, means beyond.
[7997] */ Concept-not clear, movement-dissolved,
[7998] */ Inert-awareness non-dual, accumulations-two perfected.
[7999] */ Rival moon-not, cog-bzhag rang,
[8000] */ Altered word-not, all-pervading.
[8001] */ Think-doer mind-not, mindfulness apart,
[8002] */ Fresh itself, natural natural-condition.
[8003] */ Unaltered supreme, natural abiding.
[8004] Thus.
[8005] Thus outer-appearance, inner-body-mind all not-existing, clear-appearance water-moon like, realized rtsal-manifested...
