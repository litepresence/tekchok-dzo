[11125] From Result Exposition:
[11126] Thus from practice,
[11127] Signs and measure this-like:
[11128] Body light, appearing transparent-penetrate,
[11129] Without touch, without obstacle to ground,
[11130] Speech power complete, speech pair exhausted,
[11131] Mind able to transfer,
[11132] Eye, form, nose, tongue,
[11133] All body sense-faculties cease—
[11134] Measure of becoming without nature.
[11135] Third: grasping well path measures by saying other distinctions of signs—three aspects:
[11136] General showing of unborn obtaining signs,
[11137] Particular explanation of qualities signs,
[11138] Separate saying of distinction of three mixed signs.
[11139] Of the first:
[11140] Yogin entering confidence in primordially-pure realization, signs of not taking birth again in existence—no insects on body, hair and fingernails not growing. Then in three months, seen by others, five lights center, five race kayas, rising in sky and dissolving.
[11141] From Blazing Relics:
[11142] Who, by whom, unborn
[11143] Root-cut person that,
[11144] Signs like this also arise.
[11145] Who possesses this sign,
[11146] Is equal fortune with me.

[11148] All these birth continuum ceases.
[11149] Who hair and fingernails,
[11150] All these not growing, continuum ceases—
[11151] This is without birth.
[11152] Thus possessing signs,
[11153] Even in three months,
[11154] This dissolves elements to self,
[11155] Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[11156] Own body in light tone center,
[11157] With race this becomes.
[11158] This is exhaustion time yogin, great fortune.
[11159] Second: praise of that qualities—appearance body speech qualities, immeasurable awareness empty qualities not.
