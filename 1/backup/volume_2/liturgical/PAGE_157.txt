[6625] [6625] Virtue, non-virtue, etc.—that itself sudden.
[6626] [6626] That essence: basisless, self-liberated.
[6627] [6627] Awareness's primordial tone exists in part—if identified, intention's dharmata direction has nowhere else to grasp.
[6628] [6628] All appearance-existence samsara-nirvana dharmas—great appearance of clear appearance of non-existence in awareness's nature, self-dawning, self-appearing:
[6629] [6629] Like four elements' appearances dwelling in sky's nature,
[6630] [6630] Like various dreams and sleep,
[6631] [6631] Not moving from sleep-awareness's nature.
[6632] [6632] Although all self-appear in awareness's nature,
[6633] [6633] Awareness does not see delusion-appearance samsara,
[6634] [6634] Does not see pure appearance transcended,
[6635] [6635] Samsara-nirvana does not see awareness.
[6636] [6636] All, unmoving in basisless great equal nature,
[6637] [6637] Transcending seer and seen through non-establishment of essence,
[6638] [6638] Dawning from awareness's nature—merely designated "samsara-nirvana awareness's self-tone or play."
[6639] [6639] Great liberation from exist-not-exist extremes,
[6640] [6640] Designation not contradictory,
[6641] [6641] Not established in meaning.
[6642] [6642] All appearance-existence samsara-nirvana dharmas dawn as merely clear appearance of non-existence.
[6643] [6643] From Space Six:
[6644] [6644] "To mind itself without stain,
[6645] [6645] Appearance separate from object-conditions
[6646] [6646] Is called 'great self-pure intention'—
[6647] [6647] Samantabhadra I have shown."
[6648] [6649] From Jewel Display:
[6649] [6650] "Entity of complete non-existence,
[6650] [6651] Not falling in any direction,
[6651] [6652] Entity of whatever delusion—
[6652] [6653] Merely appearing as harmonious appearance,
[6653] [6654] Yet that meaning does not arise,
[6654] [6655] Appearance like dharmadhatu ornament.
[6655] [6657] Great emptiness wisdom
[6656] [6658] Deludes from complete non-existence—"
[6657] [6660] From Pearl Garland:
[6658] [6661] "That is I, that is beings,
[6659] [6662] That is mind, arisen from mind,
[6660] [6663] Not many, singularly one,
[6661] [6664] Samsara-nirvana is myself,
[6662] [6665] Mandalas etc. are gradual entry,
[6663] [6666] Dharmas, appearing as dharmas,
[6664] [6667] Abiding, moving,
[6665] [6668] Sitting, sleeping, lying,
[6666] [6669] Life, also cutting,
[6667] [6670] Three worlds arise from that.
[6668] [6671] Briefly: as appears,
[6669] [6672] All dharmas arise from that—
[6670] [6673] Earth, water, fire, wind, space,
[6671] [6674] Great elements arise from that."
