[5247] [5247] The peripheral walls of that very mandala, together with the individual principal retinues that appear therein, arise through the purification of the Dharmakaya reaching its full measure.
[5248] [5249] These are the visions of awareness arriving at its measure—the signs that actions and activities of the body during the preliminary phase, together with their connections, will not arise again in future.
[5249] [5252] Although these visions appear through reaching the vital points of the preliminary phase and other antidotes that purify each defilement to be purified, they are merely designated as the causal result of separation and the causal relationship between what purifies and what is purified. They do not arise from being produced by that, for wisdom's self-existing resonance appears through the force of purifying the obscurations of defilement.
[5250] [5255] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5251] [5256] The vision of awareness arriving at its measure—
[5252] [5257] The marks and examples of Sambhogakaya clearly manifest
[5253] [5258] From the rainbow lights of indeterminate color
[5254] [5259] The five families appear as fathers and mothers.
[5255] [5261] From the Bstan bu:
[5256] [5262] From such bodies up to their limit,
[5257] [5263] Six, ten, and five-three—
[5258] [5264] Without doubt, this is Sambhogakaya.
[5259] [5266] Second, the explanation of the nature in particular has two parts:
[5260] [5267] The general explanation of the definition of "arriving at measure," and
[5261] [5268] The particular explanation of the three measures.
[5262] [5269] The first: "Awareness arriving at measure" means
[5263] [5270] The awareness of the basis-abide becoming manifest,
[5264] [5271] Having entered the path-tradition,
[5265] [5272] Through the body-visions of the spontaneously accomplished self-resonance of basis-vision dawning,
[5266] [5273] The path-visions approach exhaustion,
[5267] [5274] And the mandalas become complete.
[5268] [5275] "Measure" is from the first half-body up to the completion of the body-mandala.
[5269] [5276] "Arrive" means there is no place beyond that—complete manifestation.
[5270] [5277] These are like the form of the full moon,
[5271] [5278] The mandala complete through the waxing and waning, without fabrication upon self-essence.
[5272] [5279] Second, the explanation of the three measures in particular has three parts:
[5273] [5280] Outer visions,
[5274] [5281] Inner body measure,
[5275] [5282] Secret awareness measure.
[5276] [5283] The first is controlling the visions and the completion of the realms in luminous clarity.
