[6838] [6838] Identifying the nature: three doors spontaneously released, whatever dawns suddenly hit, self-liberated, vast vast gone.
[6839] [6839] Appearance expansion:
[6840] [6840] Body cross-legged, eyes staring at interval appearance,
[6841] [6841] Cut mind's sending-gathering, identify half-pure awareness nature—bind five winds to space,
[6842] [6842] Self-appearance pure clear light: outer smoke, mirage, rainbow light, etc., and inner dharma-nature empty clear appearance pure like dawn.
[6843] [6843] From Six Spaces:
[6844] [6844] Train thus in three samadhis:
[6845] [6845] Self-dwelling just-place samadhi:
[6846] [6846] Not stopping power doors,
[6847] [6847] Not using body actions,
[6848] [6848] Not abandoning sleep,
[6849] [6849] Not cutting apart with mind—
[6850] [6850] Brief: body speech in self-place,
[6851] [6851] Mind-arising parts outward not lost;
[6852] [6852] To power objects six,
[6853] [6853] Know-awareness action: mind unmoved;
[6854] [6854] To self-appearance not-thinking great,
[6855] [6855] Clear thought-non-existent: experience arises.
[6856] [6856] Great thunder samadhi:
[6857] [6857] Body from ordinary like,
[6858] [6858] Speech separate from spoken words,
[6859] [6859] Mind not bound tight,
[6860] [6860] Self-dawn to self: not wandering.
[6861] [6861] Appearance expand samadhi:
[6862] [6862] By body and object and awareness,
[6863] [6863] Grasp all pure self-appearance measures.
[6864] [6864] Thus it is said.
[6865] [6865] Third: maintaining intention mind-transcending has four:
[6866] [6866] Mountain just-place view,
[6867] [6867] Ocean just-place intention,
[6868] [6868] Awareness just-place instruction,
[6869] [6869] Appearance just-place method.
[6870] [6870] First:
[6871] [6871] Identify this self-clear awareness, whatever dawns—place in nature without move-change like mountain king view.
[6872] [6872] From Letter Non-Existent:
[6873] [6873] Mountain just-place view: secret itself;
[6874] [6874] Not doubt: change by nature non-existent.
[6875] [6875] Thus it is said.
[6876] [6876] Second:
[6877] [6877] Body cross-legged,
[6878] [6878] Eyes ha-re placed at interval appearance,
[6879] [6879] Clear place in nature like ocean unmoved by waves—half-pure consciousness.
