[11803] To proceed toward buddhahood, there are five paths: the path of accumulation, the path of application, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, and the path of completion.
[11804] The path of confusion leading to birth as a sentient being also has five continua: the path of dreams, the path of latent tendencies, the path of the limits of karma, the path of the uncertain confusion-mandala, and the path where cause and result are each uncertain.
[11805] Regarding results, the distinctive buddha-fruits are twofold: the fruit of buddhahood just-as-it-is, and the fruit of buddhahood with manifest realization.
[11806] The results of birth as a sentient being are six: hell, hungry ghost, animal, human, god, and asura—beyond these, no destination exists.
[11807] Second, regarding actual signs, from among six:
[11808] First, the sign of birth in hell: at the time of death, the sky gathers with black clouds, and one proceeds as if darkness were kindled. When rain, steam, great wind, hail, and dust-whirlwinds swirl, one takes birth among the eight hot hells, the eight cold hells, the intermittent hells, the neighboring hells, the unbearable birth-being hell, and the seven vajra hells.
[11809] The latter two, although included in the category of the eight hot hells, are distinguished separately due to their long lifespans and great suffering.
[11810] Moreover, by the karma of immediate actions and so forth, all who take birth in the last of the hot hells dwell for one intermediate kalpa, while those who have abandoned the Dharma remain billions of hundreds of thousands of kalpas longer—hence it is called the Unbearable Birth-Being Hell. As proclaimed in the Noble Sutra of the Transcendence of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines:
[11811] Through the ripening of the karma of abandoning Dharma,
[11812] One takes birth in the great unbearable birth-being hell,
[11813] Experiencing unbearable suffering.
[11814] Even when the great fire-gathering kalpa arises there,
[11815] One takes birth where the great birth-being hell exists
[11816] In the eastern worlds—thus it is proclaimed
[11817] To extend throughout the ten directions, limitless and boundless.
