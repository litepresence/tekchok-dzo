[9495] [9495] All examples should precede.
[9496] [9496] Second, regarding actual direct introduction:
[9497] [9497] Lineage and
[9498] [9498] Direct introduction—two aspects.
[9499] [9499] Lineage:
[9500] [9500] Lineage through the Buddha's intention,
[9501] [9501] Lineage through signs of awareness-holders,

[9505] [9505] Single family,
[9506] [9506] Single bindu,
[9507] [9507] Single eye of primordial wisdom.
[9508] [9508] When shown through the mirror of Vajrasattva as a single example,
[9509] [9509] Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.
[9510] [9510] The vastness free from elaboration,
[9511] [9511] The body ornamented with merit,
[9512] [9512] To the emanation Vajra Light-Vitality,
[9513] [9513] The Bhagavān of Infinite Splendor,
[9514] [9514] From the vastness of pure non-birth,
[9515] [9515] Emitted three drops of the supreme enlightenment essence,
[9516] [9516] From the manifest body appearing like a water-moon mandala,
[9517] [9517] Bringing forth the body-drop, the crystal secret body, established as example wisdom.
[9518] [9518] From the vastness of speech free from elaboration,
[9519] [9519] The speech-drop, extracting the essence of enlightenment mind nectar,
[9520] [9520] Introduction to the wisdom of meaning.
[9521] [9521] From the state unchanging like the vajra mind,
[9522] [9522] The mind-drop, bringing forth the clear lamp of enlightenment mind essence,
[9523] [9523] Established with certainty through the wisdom of signs.
[9524] [9524] The body-drop ornamented with five self-arisen wisdoms,
[9525] [9525] Through primordial wisdom naturally completely pure and stainless, clear without front or back,
[9526] [9526] Great direct-penetration wisdom,
[9527] [9527] Clear without outside or inside,
[9528] [9528] Non-dual wisdom,
[9529] [9529] From the inside of non-inside,
[9530] [9530] Through condition-free wisdom parts intermixed and clear,
[9531] [9531] Non-intermixed completely perfect wisdom,
[9532] [9532] The supreme inconceivable child-appearance and time simultaneously arisen,
[9533] [9533] Simultaneously arisen wisdom,
[9534] [9534] Holding the lineage of the body of infinite appearance,
[9535] [9535] Eliminating the thoughts of beings,
[9536] [9536] Called the great bodily relics.
[9537] [9537] Through the example showing the three bodies and five wisdoms, the wisdom of Vajrasattva is clear.
