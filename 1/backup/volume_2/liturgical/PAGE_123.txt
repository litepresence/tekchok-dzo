[5316] [5316] The body arriving at measure also becomes thus:
[5317] [5317] Free from the dust of individual bodies,
[5318] [5318] The light-star-window of intermediate space appears.
[5319] [5319] Then light-rays in the shape of hooks,
[5320] [5320] Subtle and coiling, hold the vision.
[5321] [5321] The body's dust naturally ceasing,
[5322] [5322] The copper-shining stainless light-body.
[5323] [5323] The A mark in the center,
[5324] [5324] And the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure.
[5325] [5325] The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing.
[5326] [5326] From the peaceful body's fingers,
[5327] [5327] Light-garlands coil in form.
[5328] [5328] Activity of silent mind,
[5329] [5329] From the skull palace of the head,
[5330] [5330] Herukas manifestly arise.
[5331] [5331] At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—
[5332] [5332] The copper-shining three bodies coil as one.
[5333] [5334] Third, the secret awareness measure:
[5334] [5335] Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified,
[5335] [5336] There exists merely the all-ground consciousness mind,
[5336] [5337] Dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye.
[5337] [5338] From that itself:
[5338] [5339] At this time the mind is clear,
[5339] [5340] Together with the six clairvoyances,
[5340] [5341] Far and concealed
[5341] [5342] Dharmas become known in a moment.
[5342] [5343] Measureless Buddha-realms and
[5343] [5344] Likewise bodies appear to mind.
[5344] [5345] Defilements exhaust in empty mind,
[5345] [5346] Nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity.
[5346] [5347] Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse,
[5347] [5348] Through manifest clarity, not separate from the many.
[5348] [5349] Without parts, without elaboration.
[5349] [5351] That also: in the two upper visions, purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness,
[5350] [5352] At the time of obtaining this, through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections,
[5351] [5353] Free from subtle and coarse defilements,
[5352] [5354] The body-mind connection cut,
[5353] [5355] Outer visions' objects appear to awareness.
[5354] [5356] The investigating agent consciousness part, acting as self-condition through the power of all-ground consciousness,
[5355] [5357] Like a shooting star moving in the sky, the momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing, pure without looking to separate antidotes.
