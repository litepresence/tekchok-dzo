[9002] [9002] Does not enter elsewhere.
[9003] [9003] Losing jewel in king's treasury, doing suffering by jewel's absence.
[9004] [9004] Though joy-bliss expands by finding from treasury, both do not move from one treasury, like thus.
[9005] [9005] Samsara-nirvana two appearing from awareness's state is also thus.
[9006] [9006] This is the secret word of determining the self-essential-point of supreme wish-fulfillment, realizing vast Dharma-nature's expanse.
[9007] [9007] Second, demonstrating lamp-experience from that has three aspects:
[9008] [9008] Preliminary characteristics of place,
[9009] [9009] Actual lamp-pressing method,
[9010] [9010] From that, manner of appearance-arising.
[9011] [9011] First:
[9012] [9012] Abandoning all actions of this life,
[9013] [9013] Making the holy lama pleased,
[9014] [9014] Sitting with three immovables in a room decorated by darkness in a very secluded place,
[9015] [9015] Perfecting lama-yoga, meditating, placing request from heart.
[9016] [9016] From Thalgyur:
[9017] [9017] Lamp-pressing is thus:
[9018] [9018] By faithful one, mind-free from samsara,
[9019] [9019] Do lama-offering and giving,
[9020] [9020] Abandoning all samsara connections,
[9021] [9021] In secluded direction or charnel-ground,
[9022] [9022] One must abide alone, abandoning companions.
[9023] [9023] Thus it is spoken.
[9024] [9024] Second:
[9025] [9025] Placing on AH, and
[9026] [9026] Entering clearly, two:
[9027] [9027] First:
[9028] [9028] Sitting cross-legged, placing on red-clear clear round light-appearance by thumb-finger pressing, taking experience.
[9029] [9029] Making sessions short, number many,
[9030] [9030] Releasing thumb-finger effort, looking slowly,
[9031] [9031] Seeing appearance by pressing again is called Dharma-nature manifest appearance.
[9032] [9032] From that same source:
[9033] [9033] By one's own thumb and finger,
[9034] [9034] Press the bindu-empty lamp.
[9035] [9035] What arises from that pressing
[9036] [9036] Is Dharma-nature manifest appearance.
[9037] [9037] Thus it is spoken.
[9038] [9038] Entering clearly:
[9039] [9039] Then from five-light appearance, first like smoke,
[9040] [9040] Like dull illusion,
[9041] [9041] Like hovering clouds,
[9042] [9042] Like emanating fire sparks,
