## REPLACEMENT STRATEGY

**For each overused opening:**
1. Identify the file and line number
2. Check if it's within quota (2x per chapter max)
3. If over quota → Replace with alternative from pool
4. If under quota → Keep but track for next occurrence

**Preserve:**
- All middle content
- All ending content  
- All line range markers [start-end]
- All doctrinal precision
- All fresh metaphors

**Change only:** First sentence of overused patterns
