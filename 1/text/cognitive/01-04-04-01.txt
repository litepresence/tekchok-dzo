[2836-2843]
All phenomena included within samsara and nirvana are of the nature of the two truths. Conventional and ultimate. The Buddhas taught the Dharma relying on the two truths. The conventional truth of the world, the ultimate truth of meaning. This is the framework.

[2844-2853]
False conventional: all phenomena designated by mind, appearing to confused perception, having functional efficacy, but empty of inherent existence. Like dream, like illusion, like city of gandharvas. Appearing while empty, empty while appearing.

[2854-2861]
The eight examples demonstrate this nature. Dream, illusion, city of gandharvas, mirage, echo, magical display, reflection, water-moon. All appearing yet without inherent existence. This is the nature of all phenomena.

[2862-2869]
True conventional: virtuous phenomena that produce results. Ten virtuous actions, six perfections, path of seeing and meditation. Functionally effective for higher rebirth and liberation. All compounded, all conventional, all ultimately empty.

[2870-2872]
Ultimate truth: the nature of phenomena, emptiness. Known through wisdom, peaceful, free from elaboration. The nature to be recognized beyond all concepts and divisions.
