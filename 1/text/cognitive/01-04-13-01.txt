[3317-3321]
Buddhist superiority in doxographical analysis. No acceptance-rejection or purity-filth divisions like outsiders. Lower vehicles cannot practice deity union as in higher tantras. Buddhist realization of inseparable truth superior to partial outsider views. Not sectarian polemic but recognition of progressive subtlety. Preserve evaluative stance without modernizing into relativism.
