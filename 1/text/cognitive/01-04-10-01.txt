[3037-3039]
Madhyamaka critique of Mind-Only. The various appearing aspects without perceiver are clear appearance only, but ultimately the self-aware primordial wisdom is also naturally empty of essence. This is the Svatantrika-Prasangika distinction.

[3037-3039]
Two positions: those who hold illusion as ultimate, and those who hold non-abiding. The first maintains some ultimate existence in appearance; the second transcends all positions completely.

[3037-3039]
The non-abiding position does not rest in any extreme—existence, non-existence, both, or neither. This is the Prasangika approach, using consequences rather than assertions.

[3037-3039]
Beyond all positions, all elaboration. This is the approach that leads to Dzogchen—recognition beyond conceptual mind, beyond all philosophical constructions.
