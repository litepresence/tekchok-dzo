Mind-Only presentation. All appearing objects are aspects of one's own consciousness, appearing externally like a jewel's reflection in water. This is the Cittamatra view—no external reality, only mind and its aspects.

[2989-2996]
Three positions on aspects and consciousness: equal number, contained like shell and kernel, or non-dual. Each represents a variation of the basic Mind-Only position, all denying external objects while affirming consciousness.

[2997-3008]
The non-dual explanation: consciousness alone perceives, entering the five doors like a monkey in a tower. Both aspect and consciousness are one nature in non-dual wisdom. Like dream—appearance and perceiver are non-dual in sleep consciousness.

[3009-3016]
False aspectarians: external objects do not exist, aspects are false habit-energy. Perceiving consciousness also not truly existent. Only experiencing self-awareness is ultimately existent. This is Mind-Only's subtle reification.
