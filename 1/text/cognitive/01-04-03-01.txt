[2833-2835]
Recognition of the two truths framework. Conventional and ultimate as the basis of Mahayana understanding. The Buddhas taught relying on these two truths. Conventional truth of the world, ultimate truth of meaning. This is the entry point for all further analysis.

[2836-2843]
Conventional truth as appearance to confused mind. All phenomena that appear to the intellect, appearing as objects of mind. Divided into false and true conventional. False conventional is deluded appearance. True conventional is virtuous action.

[2844-2861]
Detailed explanation of false conventional. Like dream, like illusion, like city of gandharvas. Appearing but not truly existent. Having functional capacity but empty of inherent nature. The eight examples of illusion demonstrate this nature.

[2862-2869]
True conventional as path phenomena. Ten virtuous actions, six perfections, path of seeing and meditation. These produce results—good rebirth, liberation. Functionally effective but ultimately empty. All path truths are compounded, all compounded is conventional.

[2870-2872]
Ultimate truth as emptiness, as nature of phenomena. With the wisdom that follows upon it, peaceful aspect free from elaboration. Divided into nominal and non-nominal. This is the nature to be recognized.
