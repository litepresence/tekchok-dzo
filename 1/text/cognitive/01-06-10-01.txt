Four kayas spontaneous recognition, not bestowed from outside. Elaborate: body aggregate Dharmakāya, never other than awareness. Speech: mantra spontaneous sound, no speaker no spoken. Mind: samādhi natural presence, no meditation no meditator. Consciousness: dharmatā own face, never obscured. Unelaborate: appearance outside illusion-empty, this perception is kaya. Very unelaborate: four activities spontaneous recognition. Utterly unelaborate: body bliss natural awareness, speech clarity unobstructed, mind not-think perfectly knowing, consciousness union power-possessing naturally doing.

Four kayas naturally recognized, mind changes not. Capable mind recognizes: this thought is Dharmakāya. Inside enters: recognition shows no method. Mind-change thought purifies, recognition joins itself. Utterly unelaborate: non-dual meaning obtained, not found but recognized. Four kayas action-limit spontaneously liberates. Elaborate action verse syllable thought, body speech mind consciousness four bliss. Recognition arises, conduct self-arises, meaning self-arrives, dharmatā never goes never comes. Emptiness maṇḍala, three doors three realms pure recognition. Six collections purify: this recognition is purification. Four kayas naturally recognized utterly certain. Attachment-aversion self-liberates. Nirmāṇakāya: aggregates elements sense-sources empty yet appearing. Saṃbhogakāya: mind come-go not, meaning realizes itself. Dharmakāya prophecy: saṃsāra-nirvāṇa attachment knowledge obscuration, subtle recognition purifies all. Four kayas not achievements, recognition of what already is.
