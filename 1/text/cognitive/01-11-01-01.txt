Gandharva mind entering nearby, seeking body, manner of coming. Father and Mother joining dissolving in wisdom-space, from mother's birth passage entering. Father's white essence size of mustard seed, clear small eye like quicksilver, absorbed into mother's red essence lineage channel. In mother's womb like blood and milk mixed, becoming one. Body formation support: four elements empty, space like sky abiding. Parents' self-nature afflictions and channels' leaves' wind, desire-mind moved. Channel-abode's letter wind's self-sound YAM, fire desire blazing. RAM sound moves, blazing changing appearance. Desire becoming attached, desire cause and attached condition joined. Entering water desire, looking at one another, smiling, embracing, attached by KHAM sound. Embracing sense-faculties joined, earth stability of body, bliss experienced, SAM sound arises. Mother's lineage five channels twisted, moon-time seven-day period becoming. Red like iron hook drawing, wind power possessing. Father's essence cause's self-nature from crown drawn, like iron gathering in magnet. Father's twenty-eight vertebrae passed through, white channel-path emerged from white shell-like cavity. Seven days four times in mother's womb, body's basis held, son bodhicitta white arising. Vajra channel-base great bliss path opened, navel bliss poured, tip bliss ripened, directly emerging to mouth, mother's lineage channel nose inside red tone absorbed. Womb like blood and milk mixed, one absorbed into one, two lineages possessing. Lineage five's power, father's consciousness drawn inside. Later free from attachment, going by vomit. Mother whatever lineage pulling-possessing, bliss contentment not-knowing. Desire-attachment cause-condition arisen, desire and attachment two, cause and condition two held. Existence body's basis wind holds, cause-condition non-dual known, bliss and great bliss result. Body and wisdom's result rolled. Mother's womb one night's night, father-mother cause-condition outer cause one becoming. Inside not-mixed like mustard seed in ga'u abiding, son wind-mind held abiding, four elements binding-cause vajra-like jewel-shell binding, separation no opportunity. Body complete time food element not, life not abiding, from that arisen. Elements wind body held, wind up-blown power up-arising, like mercury drops upward flickering. Body complete time body-mind sudden condition arisen, bright-aware body trembling. Second day earth one compressed, weight pressed, son crown pressed suffering. Body's cause flesh just ripened held, condition channel just water grown, delusion cause-condition non-dual. Non-conceptual wisdom liberated, great perfection acceptance-rejection beyond. Above body's cause dried, blood becoming, condition water flowing down. Third day wind-mind cause-condition dust-fine burned, fire red furnace entered suffering. Body's cause wind before, condition foot down twisted. Fourth day wind mercury dust-fine scattered, chopper limbs piece carried suffering, from hatred arisen. Body's cause dust-fine ripened, condition radiant clear made. Outside four elements action done, inside elements four held. Body complete time outside sun-moon season four.
