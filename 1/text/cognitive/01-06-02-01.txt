Empowerment without elaboration. No year distinction. Summer and winter both good. Waxing fortnight dates. Dawn empowerment when sounds clear. Simplified approach for advanced practitioners. Four empowerments condensed. Direct transmission tradition from Vimalamitra to Legé-tsün. Guru Jo-ber lineages interrupted. Symbolic indication preceded direct transmission. Treasure teachings difficult for hand-blessing. Meaning elaboration sufficient. No contradiction in bestowal.
