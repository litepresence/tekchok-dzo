[2850-2860]
Five paths exposition: accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, no-more-learning. Progressive stages but not merely sequential. Accumulation: merit and wisdom gathering. Preparation: four aids to penetration (heat, peak, forbearance, supreme dharma). Seeing: first direct realization of emptiness. Meditation: familiarization with realization. No-more-learning: buddhahood. Thirty-seven factors distributed across paths. Standard Mahayana structure preserved without reduction to linear progression.
