## Usage Notes

1. **Capitalization**: Proper names (Buddhas, schools, tantras) are capitalized. Technical terms are lowercase unless they begin sentences.

2. **Sanskrit vs. Tibetan**: When available, Sanskrit terms are preferred for Buddhist philosophical concepts (e.g., "dharma" not "chos").

3. **Consistency**: Once a term is glossed here, it should be used consistently throughout all translation layers.

4. **Context Sensitivity**: Some terms have different meanings in different contexts (e.g., "awareness" as vidya vs. ordinary awareness). Context should always be clear.

5. **Layer-Specific Rendering**: Some terms have different renderings in different layers (e.g., **Lugu Gyud** in literal layer, **Spiral Continuity** in liturgical layer). The glossary documents the base form; context determines the appropriate rendering.

| ** \*/ ** | closing symbol | \*/ | (shad at line end) |

### Usage Notes

1. **For Scholars:** The Wylie layer maintains EWTS standard throughout. For IAST (academic standard) equivalents, consult this glossary or the Scholar layer analysis.

2. **For Practitioners:** Capital letters in Wylie indicate Sanskrit loanwords. They do not affect pronunciation or meaning—simply recognize them as Tibetan renderings of Sanskrit terms.

3. **Reversibility:** EWTS maintains 1:1 reversibility with Tibetan Unicode. Converting to IAST would lose this reversibility.

4. **Standard:** This project uses THL Extended Wylie as the authoritative standard for transliteration. See THL documentation for complete specification.

## APPENDIX: QUALITY METRICS (5th Draft - BYTE RATIOS)

### Target Byte Ratios for A++ Quality

Quality is measured by **content-to-source byte ratios** - comparing dynamic layer byte counts to Tibetan source byte counts per section.

**Reference:** Byte ratio targets at `/protocol/byte_ratios.md`

| Layer | Minimum | Target | Maximum |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| Commentary | 0.6x | 0.8-1.5x | 2.0x |
| Scholar | 1.0x | 1.5-3.0x | 4.0x |
| Delusion | 0.7x | 1.4x | 2.5x |
| **Epistemic** | **0.4x** | **0.6-1.0x** | **1.5x** |

**Example:** A section with 50,000 Tibetan bytes needs:
- Commentary: 40,000-75,000 bytes (0.8-1.5x byte ratio)
- Scholar: 75,000-150,000 bytes (1.5-3.0x byte ratio)
- Delusion: 50,000-90,000 bytes (1.0-1.8x optimal, up to 125,000 max/2.5x)

### Why Byte Ratios vs Line Ratios

1. **Line counts vary** with formatting (wrapping, paragraph breaks)
2. **Byte counts reflect** actual content density
3. **Small files** (<500 bytes) have extreme line-ratio distortions

### Validation Commands (BYTE-BASED)

**Check Commentary byte ratio for a section:**
```bash
section="01-01-02-01"
tib=$(stat -c%s text/frozen/tibetan/${section}.txt)
comm=$(stat -c%s text/dynamic/commentary/${section}.txt)
echo "Byte Ratio: $(echo "scale=2; $comm/$tib" | bc)"
```

**Find all Commentary sections below minimum (byte ratios):**
```bash
cd text
for f in frozen/tibetan/*.txt; do
  section=$(basename $f .txt)
  tib=$(stat -c%s $f)
  comm=$(stat -c%s dynamic/commentary/${section}.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  ratio=$(echo "scale=2; $comm/$tib" | bc 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  if (( $(echo "$ratio > 0 && $ratio < 0.6" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "EXPAND: $section (Tib=$tib Comm=$comm ByteRatio=${ratio}x)"
  fi
done
```

### Quality Tiers (Byte Ratios)

| Tier | Commentary Byte Ratio | Action Required |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Disaster | <0.3x | 300-500% expansion |
| Critical | 0.3-0.5x | 100-200% expansion |
| Low | 0.5-0.7x | 50-100% expansion |
| Good | 0.7-1.2x | Polish |
| Excellent | >1.2x | A++ Standard |

### Section ID Format

Sections use VV-CC-SS-SS format:
- **VV:** Volume (01 or 02)
- **CC:** Chapter (01-25)
- **SS:** Section number (01-20+)
- **SS:** Subsection (01, 02, etc.)

Example: `01-04-12-01` = Volume 1, Chapter 4, Section 12, Subsection 1
