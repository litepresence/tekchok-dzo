[9518-9519] [VIEW ERROR] [VISIONARY OBSESSION]
MISREADING:
Reader adopts Thogyal - self-existing awareness as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Thogyal - self-existing awareness is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION]. View becomes position rather than recognition.

[9520-9528] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [STAGE HIERARCHY]
MISREADING:
Reader interprets Thogyal - self-existing awareness through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Thogyal - self-existing awareness is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Thogyal - self-existing awareness is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.
