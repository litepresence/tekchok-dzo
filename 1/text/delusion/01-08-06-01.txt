[10775-10779] [VIEW ERROR] [PHILOSOPHICAL FIXATION]
MISREADING:
Reader adopts Completion - signs and indications error as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Completion - signs and indications error is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION]. View becomes position rather than recognition.

[10780-10781] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [EMPTINESS NIHILISM]
MISREADING:
Reader seeks Completion - signs and indications error as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Completion - signs and indications error is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.
