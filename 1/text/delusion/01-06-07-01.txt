[8680-8688] [PRACTICE ERROR] [POSTURE FIXATION]
MISREADING:
The physical posture instructions (lion's leap, joints bent, chest hollowed) are interpreted as literal gymnastic requirements that mechanically produce realization when held correctly, like asanas in hatha yoga.

WHY IT ARISES:
Physicalist frameworks assume form determines consciousness. The detailed anatomical instructions suggest biomechanical causation. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports posture-obsession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that posture supports but does not cause recognition is entirely lost. Practitioners injure themselves forcing positions while neglecting the view that makes posture meaningful.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Flexibility competition replaces wisdom inquiry. Those with physical limitations believe themselves excluded from realization. The energetic dimensions of posture are reduced to muscular mechanics.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on channel practices will be approached as physical manipulations rather than energetic recognitions.

[8689-8698] [VIEW ERROR] [CAUSAL SUBSTANTIALISM]
MISREADING:
The "key points" (gnad) are understood as mechanical switches that automatically cut samsara or liberate bliss when properly executed, like pressing buttons on a spiritual machine.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technological causation models project onto subtle body. The imperative language ("cuts the root," "liberates") suggests automatic efficacy. The desire for guaranteed results without recognition supports mechanism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that key points only work when informed by view is entirely obscured. Practice becomes technique-collection rather than recognition-deepening.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners accumulate "key points" without understanding their purpose. Guru devotion degenerates into technique-transmission seeking. The causal chain of dependent origination is replaced by push-button causality.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent descriptions of bliss will be treated as automatic physiological responses rather than recognition-based experiences.

[8699-8708] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [BLISS REIFICATION]
MISREADING:
The three blisses of the three kayas (held at root = dharmakaya bliss, at navel = sambhogakaya bliss, at tip = nirmanakaya bliss) are treated as substantially different physical sensations to be pursued and accumulated.

WHY IT ARISES:
Somatic mapping frameworks project subtle body geography onto physical anatomy. The localization language suggests discrete, graspable experiences. Desire for variety and accumulation drives differentiation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that all bliss is the single taste of dharmakaya is entirely lost. Practitioners chase location-specific sensations while missing the non-local essence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Competition around "which bliss have you experienced" replaces recognition. Practitioners manipulate physical conditions seeking specific sensations. The ground of bliss is abandoned for bliss-fragments.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on four joys will be approached as sensation-accumulation sequence.

[8709-8718] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [SYLLABLE SEQUENCING]
MISREADING:
The progression through Oṃ (body vajra), Āḥ (speech vajra), and Hūṃ (mind vajra) is interpreted as a temporal sequence requiring systematic development, with Hūṃ as advanced attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Developmental psychology frameworks impose sequential learning models. The distinct syllables suggest progressive curriculum. Fear of skipping "basics" drives sequential obsession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The simultaneous presence of all three vajras is obscured. Practitioners get stuck in "body practice" indefinitely, deferring "mind practice." The non-dual essence is abandoned for graduated approach.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Elitist hierarchies form around which syllable one is "working with." The unity of body-speech-mind is never recognized because they are kept separate in practice. Fragmentation replaces integration.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. The trekcho framework will be misread through sequencing lens.

[8719-8723] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [SYMBOL ACCUMULATION]
MISREADING:
The generation of lotus (E), bell (Hrīḥ), and pistil (Ha) is interpreted as building up complex visualizations piece by piece, with each component adding to the final accomplishment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Architectural construction metaphors project onto visualization. The additive language ("generating," "building") suggests accumulation mechanics. Desire for impressive, detailed visualizations supports complexity-obsession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that all symbols are simultaneously present as the display of awareness is lost. Practice becomes visualization-construction project rather than recognition of what already is.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners spend years "perfecting" visualizations without recognizing their nature. Pride in complexity replaces simplicity of recognition. The symbol is fetishized over the symbolized.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [VIEW ERROR]. Subsequent pages on deity yoga will be approached as construction projects rather than recognition practices.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains subtle body posture and syllable practices. Preceding pages established ritual mechanism errors that carry forward—practitioners will combine mantra-mechanism with posture-fixation. Following pages (204+) discuss empowerment processes that will be misunderstood through lens of mechanical efficacy.
