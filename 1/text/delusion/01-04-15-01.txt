[3721-3727] [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] <view-collapse>


**Misreading:**
The bodhisattva vow to save all beings is interpreted as a literal commitment that creates overwhelming burden and guilt when the practitioner cannot accomplish it.

**Why it arises:**
Literal interpretation of metaphor. The practitioner takes vows as contractual obligations. Sense of duty creates anxiety.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner develops savior complex or guilt complex. 'I must save all beings' becomes crushing burden.

**Secondary consequences:**
Burnout and despair. The impossibility of the task creates depression. Or, the practitioner claims impossible attainments.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-error> and <view-collapse>

ERROR TYPE 4:

[3728-3739] <practice-error> <view-collapse>


**Misreading:**
The emptiness teachings of the Prajnaparamita are interpreted as nihilistic denial of all phenomena, leading to dismissal of conventional practice and ethics.

**Why it arises:**
Nihilistic tendencies find confirmation in emptiness language. 'Form is emptiness' is taken as 'nothing exists.'

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner denies validity of all conventional practice. 'All is empty' becomes excuse for non-practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ethics are dismissed as conventional. Harmful behavior is justified by 'emptiness.' Spiritual libertinism develops.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> and [SUTRA DISMISSAL]

ERROR TYPE 5:

[3740-3751] <ontological-error> <view-collapse>


**Misreading:**
The perfection of wisdom is understood as an intellectual achievement requiring extensive study of Madhyamaka texts, rather than direct recognition of mind nature.

**Why it arises:**
Intellectual bias. The practitioner equates understanding with realization. Scholarly achievement signals competence.

**Primary consequence:**
Study replaces practice. The practitioner masters Chandrakirti without recognizing mind nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Scholastic pride develops. 'I understand emptiness' replaces 'I recognize rigpa.'

**Cascade effects:**
<view-collapse> and <pedagogical-error>

[3752-3760] <practice-error> <view-collapse>


**Misreading:**
The ten stages (sa bcu) of the Bodhisattva path are understood as mandatory sequential progression that every practitioner must complete in order, rather than fluid descriptions of realization.

**Why it arises:**
Linear thinking. The practitioner wants clear roadmap. Stages suggest developmental psychology.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes stage-obsession. 'Which stage am I at?' replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner compares themselves with others based on apparent 'stage.' Hierarchy develops.

**Cascade effects:**
[PROGRESSION MYTH] and [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM]

ERROR TYPE 2:

[3761-3765] <ontological-error> <view-collapse>


**Misreading:**
The practice of the six perfections is interpreted as requiring the accumulation of vast quantities of merit over countless lifetimes, making immediate recognition impossible.

**Why it arises:**
Quantitative thinking. The practitioner believes more merit = better result. 'Countless aeons' suggests temporal distance from goal.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is deferred to future lifetimes. The practitioner believes they are 'working toward' enlightenment.

**Secondary consequences:**
Present moment availability of recognition is ignored. Practice becomes future-oriented accumulation.

**Cascade effects:**
[DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY] and [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION]
