[TAGS: GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION]
MISREADING:
The three_kayas_ground is presented as sequential stages where ground precedes path which precedes fruition, establishing temporal hierarchy requiring progressive development. The Tibetan grammatical structure with its sequential presentation unconsciously triggers developmental psychology, causing readers to project Western progressive models onto the threefold structure.

WHY IT ARISES:
The grammatical structure suggests sequence through particle chains and verbal ordering. Temporal particles trigger developmental thinking in readers conditioned by evolutionary and progressive educational models. The threefold division implies implicit hierarchy to minds trained in linear causality. Historical Buddhist pedagogical presentations often employ progressive frameworks, reinforcing this misreading even when the actual Dzogchen view is non-temporal.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Progressive model institutionalized as authentic Buddhism. Ground becomes past origin requiring recovery. Path becomes present effort demanding optimization. Fruition becomes future goal justifying current sacrifice. The entire framework shifts from spontaneous presence to developmental achievement, fundamentally betraying Dzogchen's core insight of timeless perfection.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Stage anxiety manifests as relentless self-assessment. Progress measurement becomes obsession with quantifiable markers. Achievement orientation corrupts practice into performance. Completion fixation creates chronic dissatisfaction with present state. Ground remains always already lost, path extends infinitely, fruition perpetually deferred.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Progressivism infects all practice aspects → spiritual materialism commodifies realization → comparison with others becomes default mode → competition corrupts sangha harmony → samaya ruptures multiply → teacher-student exploitation becomes normalized → entire tradition degenerates into spiritual capitalism.
