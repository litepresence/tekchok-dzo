[8810-8817] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [BLISS DEVELOPMENT]
**Misreading:**
The cultivation of bliss is interpreted as developing an experience over time through repeated practice, like building muscle or acquiring skill, with bliss as conditioned attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Conditioning and training frameworks impose development models. The language of "cultivation" suggests temporal growth. Fear that bliss won't happen without effort drives doing-obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that bliss is the natural expression of mind's nature, always present, never developed, is entirely obscured. Seeking replaces finding.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners chase increasingly intense experiences, becoming bliss-addicted. Disappointment when conditioned experiences fade leads to technique-switching. The unconditioned is abandoned for the conditioned.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Four joys will be misread as temporal progression rather than simultaneous aspects.

[8818-8826] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [SIGN COLLECTION]
**Misreading:**
The signs of warmth (signs of successful practice) are treated as trophies or achievements to be collected and displayed, like merit badges certifying advancement.

**Why it arises:**
Credential-seeking psychology projects onto spiritual practice. The enumerative language suggests collectible items. Desire for external validation supports sign-fetishism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that signs are spontaneous expressions of recognition, not goals to achieve, is entirely lost. Practice becomes sign-production rather than recognition-cultivation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners fake or exaggerate signs to appear advanced. Competition around "who has more signs" poisons communities. The genuine is abandoned for the performed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on four visions will be approached as sign-accumulation sequence.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains subtle body practices (thigle, channels, winds). Preceding pages established empowerment-transaction errors that carry forward—practitioners believe these practices require prior empowerment. Following pages (206+) discuss the four joys which will be misunderstood through lens of sensation-development.

[8827-8836] <practice-error> [MUDRA MECHANISM]
**Misreading:**
The four mudras (karma mudra, samaya mudra, dharma mudra, mahamudra) are interpreted as physical hand gestures and sexual positions that mechanically produce realization when performed correctly.

**Why it arises:**
Performative frameworks project onto mudra practice. The detailed physical instructions suggest choreographed causation. Desire for concrete techniques supports literal interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that mudras are expressions of realized view, not causes of realization, is entirely lost. Practice becomes physical performance rather than recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners obsess over precise positioning while neglecting view. Sexual technique replaces wisdom inquiry. The symbolic dimensions are reduced to mechanics.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on thigle will be approached as hydraulic management.

[8837-8840] [VIEW ERROR] [LOCATION ESSENTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The specific locations (tip to root, root to navel, etc.) are understood as fixed anatomical points that must be precisely mapped and manipulated, like acupuncture points with guaranteed effects.

**Why it arises:**
Cartographic thinking projects spatial certainty onto subtle body. The precise anatomical language suggests objective geography. Scientific materialism supports literalization.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that locations are conceptual designations for awareness-movement, not fixed points, is entirely obscured. The energetic becomes the cartographic.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners carry anatomical maps while missing the awareness that moves. Disappointment when locations don't match descriptions leads to doubt. The fluid becomes fixed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on channel opening become navigational challenges.
