**Why it arises:**
Lines 14633-14637: "bcu ni las kyi rlung yin te...lhag ma drug brgya ye shes rlung" (ten are karma wind...remainder 600 are wisdom wind).

**Primary consequence:**

**Cascade effects:**
[PATH AVOIDANCE ERROR]

[15033-15035] <reification-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) exist as actual entities residing in specific physical channels, like water in pipes, and can be "accessed" or "activated" through proper manipulation of the throat chakra channels.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed anatomical description of channels and their correspondence to wisdoms suggests a literal, spatial relationship. Western readers habitually reify abstract qualities into concrete substances that can be located and manipulated.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes a physicalist enterprise of "opening channels" to "release wisdoms." The practitioner seeks energetic experiences as proof of wisdom manifestation, confusing somatic sensation with realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fixation on physiological manipulation replaces view-based recognition. Practitioners pursue channel-opening techniques as ends in themselves, measuring progress by bodily sensations rather than diminishing fixation.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [CHANNEL OBSESSION] where practitioners accumulate ever more subtle anatomical knowledge, [SOMATIC MATERIALISM] reducing mind to bodily processes, and [EXPERIENCE HUNTING] chasing energetic sensations. The error cascades into therapeutic appropriation of Dzogchen as somatic healing modality.
