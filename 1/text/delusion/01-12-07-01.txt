[15778-15781] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [EFFORTLESS APPROPRIATION]
MISREADING:
The distinction between effortful (rtsol bcas) and effortless (rtsol med) systems is a hierarchical progression from lower to higher.

WHY IT ARISES:
Natural assumption that "effortless" is superior. Common marketing of "direct path" over gradual methods.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Premature abandonment of effortful preliminary practices.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Lack of foundation for recognizing effortless state.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15782-15789] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [BINDU SUBSTANTIALISM]
MISREADING:
The bindu (thig le) is a physical substance or energetic particle that can be manipulated through technique.

WHY IT ARISES:
Descriptions use physical language ("hold," "reverse," "drop"). Modern subtle-body discourse conflates symbol with physiology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Treating thigle practices as bioenergetic manipulation rather than recognition of nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fixation on sensation and localized experience.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15790-15797] [PRACTICE ERROR] [POSTURAL LITERALISM]
MISREADING:
Specific sitting postures ('dug stangs) and gazes (gzigs stangs) mechanically produce realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
Prescriptive language suggests causality. Physical interventions offer tangible handles.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Obsession with correct posture over recognition of nature.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Body tension and fixation on form.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR] distracts from direct pointing.

---

[15798-15805] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [VERSE ONTOLOGIZATION]
MISREADING:
Poetic verse citations (mu tig phreng ba las) assert literal anatomical and metaphysical truths.

WHY IT ARISES:
Canonical authority of quotations. Beautiful language taken as descriptive fact.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
System-building around poetic images.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Elaborate symbolic interpretation disconnected from direct recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

[15806-15817] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [THREE PARTS SUBSTANTIALISM]
MISREADING:
The three parts (right, left, center) of the bindu correspond to literal physical locations in the body.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical language (ro ma, rkyang ma, dbu ma) suggests physical channels.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Mapping bindu locations onto Western anatomical structures.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Disappointment when physical manipulation fails to produce realization.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15818-15829] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [METHOD-WISDOM DUALITY]
MISREADING:
Father-mother (yab yum) union of method and wisdom is a literal sexual practice or energy exchange.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sexual symbolism invites literalization. Karmamudra traditions exist in parallel.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Confusing symbolic union with physical or energetic technique.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Moral confusion or fixation on sexual methods.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15830-15841] [REIFICATION ERROR] [DHARMAKAYA BINDU LOCATION]
MISREADING:
The dharmakaya bindu in the center is an actual place or container where something resides.

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial language ("dwells," "center," "basis") suggests location.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Searching for bindu as object of meditation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that "center" is metaphor for non-dual nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[MEDITATIONISM ERROR].

[15842-15854] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [GRADUALISM MISATTRIBUTION]
MISREADING:
The progression from relative to ultimate bindu is a gradual cultivation path requiring time.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential presentation implies temporal process. Ordinary cognition requires time.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Approaching recognition as achievement to be developed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deferral of present recognition to future attainment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15855-15868] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [LIGHT AS PHENOMENON]
MISREADING:
The clear light ('od gsal) is a visible light phenomenon or altered state of consciousness.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Light" language invites visual interpretation. Meditation experiences produce luminosity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Cultivating light experiences as goal.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fixation on signs (mtshan ma) rather than nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] confused for [DZOGCHEN VIEW].

---

[15869-15882] [PRACTICE ERROR] [LAMP MANIPULATION]
MISREADING:
The four lamps (sgro ma bzhi) are objects to be cultivated or intensified.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Blazing" (bar ba) and "lamp" suggest active process. Effort-based conditioning.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Attempting to create or improve lamp experiences.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that lamps are self-arising display of nature.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15883-15896] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [BARDO SPATIALIZATION]
MISREADING:
The bardo (bar do) is a literal intermediate state or place between death and rebirth.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Intermediate" (bar) suggests spatial/temporal between-state. Popular Buddhist discourse.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Anxiety about navigating post-death geography.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that bardo is present moment of not recognizing.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15897-15911] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [APPEARANCE-EMPTINESS DUALITY]
MISREADING:
Appearance and emptiness are two aspects that need to be combined or unified.

WHY IT ARISES:
Grammar of "union" (zung 'jug) suggests two things joining.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Intellectual synthesis project rather than direct recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Endless philosophical elaboration.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].

---

[15912-15926] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [SIX LOCUS LITERALISM]
MISREADING:
The six loci ('khor lo drug) are fixed anatomical locations for specific energies.

WHY IT ARISES:
Anatomical mapping satisfies desire for concrete reference points.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Rigid fixation on channel locations.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that loci are pedagogical pointers, not geography.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15927-15937] [REIFICATION ERROR] [CHANNEL SUBSTANTIALISM]
MISREADING:
The central channel (dbu ma) is a physical tube or conduit for subtle energies.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Channel" (rtsa) suggests plumbing. Anatomical correlations available.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Physical manipulation of posture and breath to "open" channels.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Tension and strain seeking energetic flow.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15938-15949] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WIND AS ENTITY]
MISREADING:
Winds (rlung) are actual moving energies or forces within the body.

WHY IT ARISES:
Respiratory and energetic sensations seem to move. Physics uses "wind" metaphorically.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Wind-control practices as end in themselves.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that winds are movements of mind.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation.

---

[15950-15961] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [CAUSAL INVERSION]
MISREADING:
The bindu causes or produces the clear light as an effect.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential description implies causality. Ordinary logic requires causes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Seeking to produce clear light through bindu manipulation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Causal framework obscures spontaneous presence.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SUTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] applied to [DZOGCHEN VIEW].

[15962-15974] [PRACTICE ERROR] [MINDFULNESS FIXATION]
MISREADING:
Mindfulness (dran pa) and introspection (shes bzhin) are states to be cultivated and maintained.

WHY IT ARISES:
Conventional meditation instruction emphasizes mindfulness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Effortful maintaining of attention as practice.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing that natural awareness is prior to mindfulness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SUTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] mistaken for [DZOGCHEN VIEW].

---

[15975-15987] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [CONVENTIONAL-ULTIMATE CONFUSION]
MISREADING:
Conventional (kun rdzob) and ultimate (don dam) are two different realities or levels.

WHY IT ARISES:
Two-truth framework deeply embedded in Buddhist thought.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Privileging "ultimate" over "conventional" experience.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Devaluing everyday perception or seeking special states.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[15988-16000] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PURE VISION SUBSTANTIALISM]
MISREADING:
Pure perception (dag snang) means seeing things as actually pure rather than impure.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Pure" suggests evaluative hierarchy. Visualization practices train this.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Cultivating positive interpretations as spiritual progress.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Spiritual bypassing of difficult experiences.

CASCADE EFFECTS:

[16001-16014] [REIFICATION ERROR] [SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
MISREADING:
Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is an automatic result that happens without effort.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Spontaneous" suggests ease. Effort-fatigue seeks effortless alternatives.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Passive waiting for realization to occur.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Avoiding necessary engagement with recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] "nothing to do."

---

[16015-16024] [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] [PRIMORDIAL PURITY OBSCURATION]
MISREADING:
Primordial purity (ka dag) means inherently pure so no need for recognition or practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Logical inference from "already pure." Anti-effort movements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dismissal of path and practice as unnecessary.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Confusion when suffering continues.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
