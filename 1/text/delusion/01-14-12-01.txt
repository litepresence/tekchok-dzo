[20212-20215] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The "measure and time certainty" (tshad dang dus ngas pa) is interpreted as precise phenomenological standards to achieve.

**Why it arises:**
Technical terminology suggests precision. "Certainty" suggests requirement. The practitioner assumes standards indicate necessities.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural recognition is suffocated by standard-matching. The practitioner worries: "Is my measure correct? Is my timing certain?" Conformity-anxiety replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Standard-orthodoxies proliferate. Teachers who validate "correct" measures gain authority. The authentic recognition that measures are pedagogical tools is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Standards are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "measured" without recognition.

[20216-20222] <epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The conditional verses—"when this, then that"—are interpreted as causal laws governing practice-outcomes.

**Why it arises:**
Conditional language triggers determinism. "When...then" suggests prediction. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate laws.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured by causal anxiety. The practitioner believes specific conditions produce specific results. Recognition is replaced by condition-manipulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Condition-anxiety consumes practice. Teachers promising "correct conditions" gain authority. The authentic recognition that recognition is not condition-produced is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 475's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by condition-optimization.

[20223-20229] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate appearance-catalog is seen as "near the end" triggering "just get through this" mentality.

**Why it arises:**
Density of content creates resistance. Proximity to end creates momentum. The practitioner wants "done."

**Primary consequence:**
The profound appearance-pointing is missed. The practitioner has "read" appearances without recognition. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern. Final sections are skimmed. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "final wrap-up."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 475's completion is not integrated. Arriving at PAGE 479 without absorption, the practitioner misses dedication's power.

[20230-20236] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "wisdom moving the five elements" is interpreted as special power accessible to advanced practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Power-language triggers ability-association. "Moving elements" suggests mastery. The practitioner wants elemental-power.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical nature of elemental language is lost. Elemental-mastery becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is insufficient.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Element-mover" becomes exclusive identity. Those without elemental-experiences are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that elements are metaphors is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Elemental distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "moved elements" conceptually.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The appearance-catalog on this page carries to PAGE 475's completion. By PAGE 476's deity yoga comparison, appearance-hierarchy determines evaluation. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with appearance-history.

[20237-20242] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The first fifteen examples (dpe bco lnga) comparing Buddha-sentient beings to head-horns, recognition-ignorance to water-drawing and water-bubbles, wisdom-mind to gold-copper, and alaya-dharmakaya to ocean-boat are interpreted as ontological claims about metaphysical structures.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative language triggers literal interpretation. Examples suggest ontological parallels. The practitioner assumes analogies indicate realities rather than recognition-pointers.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-pointer function of examples is lost. Examples become metaphysical claims. The practitioner literalizes all analogies, creating example-ontology.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Head-horns" becomes structural theory about Buddha-nature. "Water-drawing" becomes ontological hierarchy. The practitioner collects example-interpretations as doctrine rather than recognizing what they point to.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 475-476's remaining examples. Each becomes another ontological claim. By PAGE 477-478's 'dra'o 'dra'o verses, all metaphors are substantialized.

[20243-20248] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The examples are interpreted as establishing subtle phenomenological distinctions accessible only to superior practitioners who can "see through" the examples.

**Why it arises:**
Subtle example-usage suggests sophistication. "Fifteen" implies comprehensive coverage. The practitioner wants superior example-mastery.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-without-example-mastery nature is lost. Example-comprehension becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition lacks example-sophistication.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Example-master" becomes exclusive identity. Those missing example-nuance are deemed coarse. The authentic recognition that examples are pedagogical tools is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 475-476's remaining examples. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "mastered" examples without recognition.

[20249-20254] <epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The examples comparing liberation-delusion to sleep-waking, or recognition-wisdom to wax-sun contact, are interpreted as establishing correct versus incorrect experiences.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative structure triggers evaluation. "Sleep-waking" suggests clarity-levels. The practitioner assumes examples indicate experience-requirements.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is replaced by example-matching. The practitioner seeks "gold-like" versus "copper-like" experiences. Achievement-anxiety consumes practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Example-orthodoxy emerges. Teachers validating specific example-experiences gain authority. The authentic recognition that examples don't matter is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 475-476's examples. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by example-chasing.

[20255-20260] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The first fifteen examples section triggers "halfway through examples" mentality. The practitioner wants to "get through" all examples and reach colophon.

**Why it arises:**
Example-density creates fatigue. Sequential structure suggests curriculum. The practitioner wants "done with examples."

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-function of examples is missed. The practitioner has "read" examples without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern. Remaining examples are skimmed. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "after examples."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 475-476's remaining examples are not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's power.

[20261-20267] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "sleep and waking" comparison for delusion and liberation is interpreted as literal claim about consciousness-states rather than recognition-metaphor.

**Why it arises:**
Sleep-waking is familiar framework. "Waking" suggests clarity. The practitioner assumes familiar metaphors indicate literal processes.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical nature of sleep-comparison is lost. Liberation becomes "waking up" literally. The practitioner seeks literal awakening-experiences.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Awakening experiences" become goals. Teachers promising "waking" validation gain authority. The authentic recognition that waking is metaphorical is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 475-476's remaining examples. Sleep-metaphor is reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "awakened" conceptually without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The example-literalism on this page carries to PAGE 475's remaining examples and PAGE 476's comparisons. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with example-knowledge but without recognition.

[20268-20273] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The fifteen examples (dpe bco lnga) comparing Buddha-sentient beings to head-horns, recognition-ignorance to water-drawing and water-bubbles, wisdom-mind to gold-copper, etc., are interpreted as ontological claims about metaphysical structures.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative language triggers literal interpretation. Examples suggest ontological parallels. The practitioner assumes analogies indicate realities.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-pointer function of examples is lost. Examples become metaphysical claims. The practitioner literalizes all analogies, creating example-ontology.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Head-horns" becomes structural theory. "Water-drawing" becomes ontological hierarchy. The practitioner collects example-interpretations as doctrine.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Examples there are also literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "mastered" examples without recognition.

[20274-20280] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The "similar-but-mistaken" ('dra'o 'dra'o) pairs are interpreted as establishing fine phenomenological distinctions accessible only to superior practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Subtle distinction suggests sophistication. "Mistaken" suggests error-avoidance. The practitioner wants superior discernment.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-nature of distinction is lost. Fine-discernment becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition lacks subtlety.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Discerning practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Those missing distinctions are deemed coarse. The authentic recognition that distinctions are pedagogical is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 476's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "discerned" distinctions without recognition.

[20281-20284] <epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The examples of wisdom-dissolving into light like "rainbow into space" or water-rivals into ocean are interpreted as literal processes to be experienced.

**Why it arises:**
Natural imagery triggers literal expectation. "Dissolving" suggests transformation. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate required experiences.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical nature of natural analogies is lost. The practitioner seeks literal dissolution-experiences. Phenomenological achievement replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Dissolution experiences" become goals. Teachers promising such experiences gain authority. The authentic recognition that dissolving is metaphorical is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 476's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by experience-seeking.
