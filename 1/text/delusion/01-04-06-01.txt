[2956-2962] [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The Sravaka vehicle is understood as a preliminary or inferior path to be transcended by superior practitioners, rather than recognizing it as a complete path appropriate for certain capacities.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking assumes later = better. The practitioner wants to be 'advanced.' Vehicle numbering suggests ranking.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner dismisses Sravaka teachings as 'too basic' without having understood their profound purpose.

**Secondary consequences:**
Foundation is skipped in rush to 'higher' vehicles. The practitioner becomes a Mahayana snob who lacks basic virtue.

**Cascade effects:**
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [SUTRA DISMISSAL]

ERROR TYPE 2:

[2963-2970] <ontological-error> [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The Hinayana/Sravaka path is interpreted as requiring aeons of solitary practice, making it impractical for modern practitioners who therefore must skip to faster methods.

**Why it arises:**
Impatience and spiritual materialism. The practitioner wants quick results. 'Three countless aeons' seems impossibly long.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner rejects gradual paths in favor of 'direct' methods without proper foundation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practice becomes superficial. The depth developed through gradual training is missing. 'Direct' methods fail due to lack of preparation.

**Cascade effects:**
[TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] and [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY]

ERROR TYPE 3:

[2971-2977] [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The distinction between Sravaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles is interpreted as establishing rigid personality types, rather than recognizing fluid categories based on capacity and inclination.

**Why it arises:**
Typology fascination. The practitioner wants to identify 'which one am I?' Personality tests are popular.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner becomes fixated on vehicle-identity. 'I am a Pratyekabuddha type' becomes self-limiting belief.

**Secondary consequences:**
Flexibility is lost. The practitioner follows a rigid path based on initial assessment rather than responding to circumstances.

**Cascade effects:**
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [PREPARATION PARALYSIS]

ERROR TYPE 4:

[2978-2982] [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The 'result' of the Sravaka path—Arhatship—is understood as final extinction (nirvana with remainder) that represents a lower goal than Buddhahood.

**Why it arises:**
Mahayana superiority complex. The practitioner believes bigger goal = better. Compassion for all beings seems superior to personal liberation.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner looks down on Arhats as 'selfish' while lacking their actual attainment. Pride without substance.

**Secondary consequences:**
The profound attainment of Sravaka path is dismissed. The practitioner criticizes what they have not understood.

**Cascade effects:**
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]
