[10471-10477] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [POSTURE RIGIDITY]
MISREADING:
Reader understands Integration - meditation session error as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.

WHY IT ARISES:
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Integration - meditation session error is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.

---

[10478-10487] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [DOGMATISM]
MISREADING:
Reader interprets Integration - meditation session error through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Integration - meditation session error is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.

[10488-10496] [PRACTICE ERROR] [BLISS ADDICTION]
MISREADING:
Reader treats Integration - meditation session error as a technique to be mastered through repeated application, believing that correct execution automatically produces realization.

WHY IT ARISES:
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Integration - meditation session error is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice becomes doing rather than being.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Technique accumulation replaces wisdom cultivation. Practitioners collect methods while missing the view that animates them. Practice becomes performance.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING] and [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. All practice becomes technique-accumulation.

---

[10497-10506] [VIEW ERROR] [ADVANCEMENT FANTASY]
MISREADING:
Reader adopts Integration - meditation session error as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

WHY IT ARISES:
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Integration - meditation session error is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION]. View becomes position rather than recognition.

---

[10507-10516] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [FUTURE ORIENTATION]
MISREADING:
Reader seeks Integration - meditation session error as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Integration - meditation session error is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.
