[2689-2717] [VIEW COLLAPSE] [MIND AS CONSCIOUSNESS]
**Misreading:**
Mind (sems) and consciousness (rnam shes) are equivalent terms for ordinary awareness.

**Why it arises:**
English "mind" covers both. Lack of distinction.

**Primary consequence:**
Missing the crucial distinction between dualistic mind and non-dual rigpa.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rigpa reduced to "being conscious" or "mindful."

**Cascade effects:**
[VIEW COLLAPSE] and <practice-error>.

**Misreading:**
Alaya is a container or storehouse that holds seeds and impressions.

**Why it arises:**
"Storehouse" metaphor taken literally.

**Primary consequence:**
Alaya-vijnana reified as metaphysical container.

**Secondary consequences:**
Confusion about how seeds are "stored."

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error>.
