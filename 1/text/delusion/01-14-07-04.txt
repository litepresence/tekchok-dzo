[19421-19432] [MEDITATIONISM ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The detailed progression of bindu visions—from upright to wings, from that various weapon-forms, reliquaries, lotuses—is interpreted as the actual stages of thodgal practice that all practitioners should sequentially experience.

WHY IT ARISES:
Sequential description triggers developmental reading. "Seeing" (*མཐོང་) suggests visual achievement. Western stage-theories project linear progression onto Dzogchen.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Thodgal becomes standardized vision-sequence. Practitioners compare their experiences to this "map," believing they must see specific forms in order. Natural display is forced into prescriptive framework.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Upright bindu standing" becomes stage one requirement. "Rainbow-like" is intermediate. "Weapons and reliquaries" are advanced. Students become anxious about "not seeing the right things."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [PRACTICE ERROR] produces [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where specific visions become attainments. [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR] follows as vision-stages are institutionalized. [EPISTEMIC ERROR] proliferates as students fake or force experiences.

[19433-19440] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The statement that "at the time of kāya-maturing, awareness matures as kāya" is interpreted as asserting a literal transformation process where awareness actually becomes or turns into forms—substantial change metaphysics.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Maturing" (*སྨིན་པ་) triggers developmental reading. "Awareness matures as kāya" suggests transformation. Western process metaphysics interprets this as actual becoming.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Rigpa is treated as substance that transforms. The formless awareness "becomes" form through practice. The unchanging nature of rigpa is contradicted by transformation-ontology.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Shes rab maturing as kāya" is interpreted as actual change. "Body of wisdom" becomes produced form. The spontaneous display (*རྩལ་) is confused with causally-produced transformation.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] triggers [ETERNALISTIC ERROR] where kāyas are reified as produced entities. [PRACTICE ERROR] follows as transformation is sought. [VIEW COLLAPSE] occurs when Atiyoga becomes cause-effect system.
