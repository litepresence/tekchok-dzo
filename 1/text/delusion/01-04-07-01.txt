[2983-2985] [VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The 'result' of the Sravaka path—Arhatship—is understood as final extinction (nirvana with remainder) that represents a lower goal than Buddhahood.

**Why it arises:**
Mahayana superiority complex. The practitioner believes bigger goal = better. Compassion for all beings seems superior to personal liberation.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner looks down on Arhats as 'selfish' while lacking their actual attainment. Pride without substance.

**Secondary consequences:**
The profound attainment of Sravaka path is dismissed. The practitioner criticizes what they have not understood.

**Cascade effects:**
[VEHICLE HIERARCHY ELITISM] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]

ERROR TYPE 5:

[2986-2988] <ontological-error> [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The systematic presentation of vehicles suggests a curriculum where each must be studied in sequence before advancing, creating 'vehicle-completion' anxiety.

**Why it arises:**
Educational conditioning. The practitioner assumes structured progression. Fear of missing prerequisites.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner defers genuine recognition while working through vehicle-stages. The path becomes endless preparation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Each vehicle becomes another box to check. Recognition is perpetually deferred until 'completion' of current vehicle.

**Cascade effects:**
[PREPARATION PARALYSIS] and [PROGRESSION MYTH]
