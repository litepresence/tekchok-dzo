The space/depth (klong) classifications of Dzogchen are interpreted as metaphysical realities to be accessed or inhabited, rather than pedagogical descriptions.

**Why it arises:**
Metaphysical thinking seeks ultimate ground. 'Space of dharmata' suggests transcendent realm.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner pursues 'entering the space' as goal. Meditative states are mistaken for realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spatial metaphors become reified. The practitioner talks about 'the space' as if it were a place.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> and [VIEW COLLAPSE]

================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The Dzogchen distinction between mind (sems) and primordial wisdom (ye shes) is interpreted as establishing two different substances or entities.

**Why it arises:**
Dualistic thinking creates categories. The distinction invites reification. The practitioner wants clear ontological categories.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner pursues 'wisdom' as if it were a thing to acquire. Mind is rejected in favor of wisdom.

**Secondary consequences:**
The non-dual nature of the distinction is missed. The practitioner oscillates between rejecting and pursuing mind.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> and <practice-error>

ERROR TYPE 5:

[4590-4596] [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition is interpreted as bypassing all gradual preparation, encouraging immediate advanced practice without foundation.

**Why it arises:**
Impatience and spiritual ambition. 'Direct' suggests faster. The practitioner wants to skip to the end.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner attempts advanced practices without capacity. Recognition is claimed without substance.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practice becomes performative. The practitioner demonstrates ' Dzogchen view' as identity marker.

**Cascade effects:**
[TANTRA SUBSTITUTION] and [DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY]

**Misreading:**
Dzogchen is understood as the 'highest' vehicle that makes all other vehicles obsolete, encouraging immediate abandonment of foundational practices.

**Why it arises:**
Spiritual ambition seeks supreme teaching. 'Atiyoga' suggests pinnacle. Marketing emphasizes 'direct path.'

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner abandons foundational practice for 'direct' methods without preparation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen practice fails due to lack of foundation. The practitioner claims Dzogchen view while remaining ordinary.

[4604-4610] [PREPARATION PARALYSIS] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The Dzogchen teaching of 'primordial liberation' (ye grol) is interpreted as meaning no practice is necessary because one is already enlightened.

**Why it arises:**
Laziness finds confirmation in 'already perfect.' Nihilistic tendencies interpret liberation as license.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner stops all practice. 'Already enlightened' becomes excuse for non-engagement.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ordinary mind remains unexamined. The gap between claim and reality widens. Spiritual narcissism develops.

**Cascade effects:**
