[474-496] <ontological-error> [WIND AS PHYSIOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The five root winds and branch winds are actual physiological processes or breath patterns.

**Why it arises:**
"Wind" (rlung) translated as "air" or "breath" suggests physiology.

**Primary consequence:**
Reduction of subtle body to anatomical respiratory system.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pranayama-style techniques substituted for subtle body practice.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-error>.

[552-583] <ontological-error> [CHANNEL ANATOMY]
**Misreading:**
The three main channels (central, left, right) are actual physical nerves or blood vessels.

**Why it arises:**
"Channel" suggests plumbing or wiring. Anatomical curiosity.

**Primary consequence:**
Looking for channels in cadavers or MRI scans.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing the non-physical nature of subtle body.
