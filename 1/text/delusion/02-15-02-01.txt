[474-496] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [WIND AS PHYSIOLOGY]
MISREADING:
The five root winds and branch winds are actual physiological processes or breath patterns.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Wind" (rlung) translated as "air" or "breath" suggests physiology.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reduction of subtle body to anatomical respiratory system.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Pranayama-style techniques substituted for subtle body practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR].

[552-583] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [CHANNEL ANATOMY]
MISREADING:
The three main channels (central, left, right) are actual physical nerves or blood vessels.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Channel" suggests plumbing or wiring. Anatomical curiosity.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Looking for channels in cadavers or MRI scans.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the non-physical nature of subtle body.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR].
