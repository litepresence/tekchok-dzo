[13104-13105] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The "jewel house with eight doors" is interpreted as an actual dwelling place or palace to be entered or achieved.

WHY IT ARISES:
Architectural metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The desire for a stable place supports reification.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The eight doors of spontaneous display (lhun grub) become eight entrances to a palace. The teaching on the eight modes of appearance is lost.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practice becomes about reaching or entering rather than recognizing what already displays. The immanence of realization is obscured.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SPATIALIZATION ERROR] and [ATTAINMENT ERROR].

[13106-13112] [REIFICATION ERROR] [PRACTICE ERROR]
MISREADING:
Riding sunbeams, wearing rainbow garments, and carrying crystal spears are understood as actual siddhis or magical powers to be achieved.

WHY IT ARISES:
Magical imagery triggers siddhi-seeking. The desire for extraordinary powers supports literal reading.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Dzogchen's simple recognition is replaced by pursuit of magical abilities. The symbolic language pointing to direct experience becomes goal-oriented practice.

Practitioner becomes distracted by magical thinking. The teaching that the path is recognition, not acquisition, is entirely lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [SIDDHI-SEEKING ERROR] and [ACQUISITION ERROR].

[13113-13119] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The symbolic correspondences—"Field Broad is samsara," "mud is body, speech, and mind"—are treated as poetic metaphors without technical meaning.

WHY IT ARISES:
Correspondence lists suggest allegorical reading. The distinction between technical terminology and poetic language is not recognized.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The precise Dzogchen anatomy being taught is dismissed as poetic fancy. Technical terms become literary devices.

[13120-13126] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
The parents sending children to two different realms is interpreted as parental abandonment or bad parenting rather than teaching on the two aspects of appearance.

WHY IT ARISES:
Family narrative triggers psychological/parenting interpretation. Modern family values influence reading of ancient symbolic text.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching on dbyings snang (expanse appearance) and thig le (sphere) as two modes of rig pa's display is entirely missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Reader judges the narrative morally rather than recognizing its technical content. The pointing to the two lamps of bar do instruction is lost.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [MORALISTIC ERROR] and [PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR].

---

[13127-13133] [HERMENEUTIC ERROR] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR]
MISREADING:
"Not listening to instructions" is understood as moral failure of disobedience rather than indicating how dull faculties fixate on appearance.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Not listening" suggests moral fault. Ethical frameworks interpret narrative events as moral lessons.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The technical teaching about dbang po rtul ba (dull faculties) and fixation on appearance is replaced by moral exhortation to obey.

[13134-13140] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [REIFICATION ERROR]
MISREADING:
The three messengers (mi gsum) and their journey is understood as literal travel narrative rather than pointing to the three baskets (sde snod gsum) of teachings.

WHY IT ARISES:
Travel narrative triggers geographical reading. The concrete imagery of journey obscures symbolic reference.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The three baskets as aspects of the path become a travel story. The integration of scripture, reasoning, and instruction is missed.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioner misses how the three baskets serve as supports for recognition. The unity of the three vehicles is lost.

MISREADING:
The "bar do of unarranged appearance" (yul ma bkod par snang ba) is interpreted as an actual intermediate state place between death and rebirth.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Bar do" commonly refers to after-death state. Popular Buddhist cosmology supports literal spatial interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition that bar do is the nature of present experience is lost. Practice becomes preparation for future death rather than present recognition.
