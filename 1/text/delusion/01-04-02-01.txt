[2539-2548] <sravaka-vehicle-misunderstanding>
**Misreading:**
The Śrāvakayāna is understood as a "lower vehicle" (*theg dman*) to be transcended, with its emphasis on personal liberation seen as selfish rather than appropriate for certain temperaments.

**Why it arises:**
The term "lower" (*dman*) suggests inferiority. Mahāyāna rhetoric about compassion can make the Śrāvaka's "self-liberation" seem selfish.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners dismiss the foundational teachings on renunciation, impermanence, and selflessness as "Hinayana," missing that these are prerequisites for all Buddhist paths.

[2549-2579] <vaibhasika-atomism>
**Misreading:**
The Vaibhāṣika view that atoms (*rdul phran*) are ultimately real is rejected as crude materialism without recognizing that their analysis serves a purpose: establishing impermanence and non-self.

**Why it arises:**
Atoms sound like physics. The assertion that atoms "truly exist" seems like materialism to be refuted.

**Primary consequence:**
Missing the pedagogical value: by analyzing gross objects into atoms, the Vaibhāṣika establishes that nothing permanent or unitary exists. This is a crucial step toward subtler emptiness.

[2580-2587] <sautrantika-momentariness>
**Misreading:**
The Sautrāntika view of momentary cognition (*skad cig shes pa*) is seen as simply wrong about the nature of mind, rather than a sophisticated analysis of experience that prevents reification.

**Why it arises:**
Momentariness seems to create problems: if each moment is separate, how does memory work? How is there continuity?

**Primary consequence:**
Either rejecting the analysis (leading to reification of consciousness) or accepting it nihilistically (no continuity possible). Missing the middle way: dependent origination provides continuity without permanence.

[2710-2718] <pratyekabuddha-isolation>
**Misreading:**
The Pratyekabuddha's solitary practice (*bse ru lta bu*) is interpreted as misanthropic withdrawal, rather than a temperament that realizes emptiness through observing nature's interdependence.

**Why it arises:**
Solitary practice seems to lack compassion. The emphasis on self-liberation appears selfish.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners force social engagement when their temperament suits solitary practice, or conversely, isolate themselves without genuine realization. Missing that the rhinoceros-like practitioner has unique insights into causality.
