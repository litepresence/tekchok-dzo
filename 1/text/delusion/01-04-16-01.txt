[3766-3769] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The practice of the six perfections is interpreted as requiring the accumulation of vast quantities of merit over countless lifetimes, making immediate recognition impossible.


WHY IT ARISES:
Quantitative thinking. The practitioner believes more merit = better result. 'Countless aeons' suggests temporal distance from goal.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is deferred to future lifetimes. The practitioner believes they are 'working toward' enlightenment.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Present moment availability of recognition is ignored. Practice becomes future-oriented accumulation.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY] and [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION]



ERROR TYPE 3:

[3770-3778] [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The bodhisattva vow to save all beings is interpreted as a literal commitment that creates overwhelming burden and guilt when the practitioner cannot accomplish it.


WHY IT ARISES:
Literal interpretation of metaphor. The practitioner takes vows as contractual obligations. Sense of duty creates anxiety.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner develops savior complex or guilt complex. 'I must save all beings' becomes crushing burden.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Burnout and despair. The impossibility of the task creates depression. Or, the practitioner claims impossible attainments.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTICE ERROR] and [VIEW COLLAPSE]



ERROR TYPE 4:

[3779-3787] [PRACTICE ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The emptiness teachings of the Prajnaparamita are interpreted as nihilistic denial of all phenomena, leading to dismissal of conventional practice and ethics.


WHY IT ARISES:
Nihilistic tendencies find confirmation in emptiness language. 'Form is emptiness' is taken as 'nothing exists.'


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner denies validity of all conventional practice. 'All is empty' becomes excuse for non-practice.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Ethics are dismissed as conventional. Harmful behavior is justified by 'emptiness.' Spiritual libertinism develops.


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[NIHILISTIC ERROR] and [SUTRA DISMISSAL]



ERROR TYPE 5:

[3788-3796] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The perfection of wisdom is understood as an intellectual achievement requiring extensive study of Madhyamaka texts, rather than direct recognition of mind nature.


WHY IT ARISES:
Intellectual bias. The practitioner equates understanding with realization. Scholarly achievement signals competence.


PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Study replaces practice. The practitioner masters Chandrakirti without recognizing mind nature.


SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Scholastic pride develops. 'I understand emptiness' replaces 'I recognize rigpa.'


CASCADE EFFECTS:
[VIEW COLLAPSE] and [PEDAGOGICAL ERROR]

[3797-3805] [PRACTICE ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
The kriya_upa_yoga presentation is understood as establishing fixed ontological categories rather than pedagogical skillful means.

[3806-3815] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

[3825-3834] [PRACTICE ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================

[3835-3844] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [VIEW COLLAPSE]
================================================================================


MISREADING:
