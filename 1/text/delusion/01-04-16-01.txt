================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The practice of the six perfections is interpreted as requiring the accumulation of vast quantities of merit over countless lifetimes, making immediate recognition impossible.

**Why it arises:**
Quantitative thinking. The practitioner believes more merit = better result. 'Countless aeons' suggests temporal distance from goal.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is deferred to future lifetimes. The practitioner believes they are 'working toward' enlightenment.

**Secondary consequences:**
Present moment availability of recognition is ignored. Practice becomes future-oriented accumulation.

**Cascade effects:**
[DIRECT RECOGNITION DELAY] and [CAUSAL/RESULT CONFUSION]

================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The bodhisattva vow to save all beings is interpreted as a literal commitment that creates overwhelming burden and guilt when the practitioner cannot accomplish it.

**Why it arises:**
Literal interpretation of metaphor. The practitioner takes vows as contractual obligations. Sense of duty creates anxiety.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner develops savior complex or guilt complex. 'I must save all beings' becomes crushing burden.

**Secondary consequences:**
Burnout and despair. The impossibility of the task creates depression. Or, the practitioner claims impossible attainments.

================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The emptiness teachings of the Prajnaparamita are interpreted as nihilistic denial of all phenomena, leading to dismissal of conventional practice and ethics.

**Why it arises:**
Nihilistic tendencies find confirmation in emptiness language. 'Form is emptiness' is taken as 'nothing exists.'

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner denies validity of all conventional practice. 'All is empty' becomes excuse for non-practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ethics are dismissed as conventional. Harmful behavior is justified by 'emptiness.' Spiritual libertinism develops.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> and [SUTRA DISMISSAL]

================================================================================

**Misreading:**
The perfection of wisdom is understood as an intellectual achievement requiring extensive study of Madhyamaka texts, rather than direct recognition of mind nature.

**Why it arises:**
Intellectual bias. The practitioner equates understanding with realization. Scholarly achievement signals competence.

**Primary consequence:**
Study replaces practice. The practitioner masters Chandrakirti without recognizing mind nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Scholastic pride develops. 'I understand emptiness' replaces 'I recognize rigpa.'

**Misreading:**

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner compares themselves with others. Judgment replaces compassion.

**Secondary consequences:**

Scriptural citations supporting kriya_upa_yoga are taken as proof of absolute authority rather than skillful means for specific capacities.

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
Citations become weapons in debate. Living recognition is subordinated to textual authority.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner is overwhelmed by detail. Practice is deferred until 'mastery' is achieved.

**Secondary consequences:**
