[2051-2074] <ontological-error> [INTERNAL-EXTERNAL DUALISM]
**Misreading:**
External elements are physical world; internal elements are body/mind—two separate domains.

**Why it arises:**
Subject-object dualism.

**Primary consequence:**
Missing the non-dual nature of inner-outer.

**Secondary consequences:**
Environment seen as separate from practitioner.

**Cascade effects:**
[DUALISTIC ERROR].

[2075-2122] <ontological-error> [PURIFIED ELEMENTS LITERALISM]
**Misreading:**
"Pure" elements are cleaner or better versions of regular elements.

**Why it arises:**
Moral language of "pure" and "impure."

**Primary consequence:**
Purification understood as cleaning or refining.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing the ontological transformation.

[2311-2334] <ontological-error> [SUBTLE BODY MATERIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The subtle body (channels, winds, essences) is a subtle physical body, like an energetic anatomy.

**Why it arises:**
"Body" suggests physical structure. New age subtle anatomy.

**Primary consequence:**
Reification of subtle body as quasi-physical.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing the wisdom-dimension of subtle body.

[2506-2526] [VIEW COLLAPSE] [MIND AS CONSCIOUSNESS]
**Misreading:**
Mind (sems) and consciousness (rnam shes) are equivalent terms for ordinary awareness.

**Why it arises:**
English "mind" covers both. Lack of distinction.

**Primary consequence:**
Missing the crucial distinction between dualistic mind and non-dual rigpa.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rigpa reduced to "being conscious" or "mindful."
