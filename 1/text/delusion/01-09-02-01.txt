[12478-12481] [12268-12287]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, TIME ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text states "Time to certainty not-possess-by-means-of time before after mutually conflict-by-means-of equal immediate condition self place liberate." A reader might think: "Time is uncertain and conflicting. I need to transcend time into the immediate condition where past and future don't conflict."

WHY IT ARISES:
Time anxiety is universal. The mention of time's uncertainty triggers desire for timelessness. "Equal immediate condition" sounds like an eternal present to escape to.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner seeks to escape time into an "immediate condition" of eternal present. They reject temporal experience for timelessness.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Time is rejected as obstacle
2. "Immediate" is reified as timeless state
3. Natural time is denied
4. Escapism replaces recognition

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates TIME ERROR (escaping temporality) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking timelessness) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (immediate as escape). The practitioner tries to stop time.

[12482-12495] [12288-12312]
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, BODILY ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text describes dependent origination through body-mind: "Body mind with together that also moment first to delude this self samsara first is." A reader might think: "Samsara starts with the body-mind connection. I need to work with my body to liberate my mind, or transcend the body-mind complex entirely."

WHY IT ARISES:
Body-mind language triggers somatic approaches. Western somatic practitioners want to work with embodiment. "First" suggests origin in the body to address.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner creates body-based practices to address "first delusion," seeking somatic liberation. They reify body-mind as the locus of samsara to work through.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Body becomes obstacle to transcend
2. Somatic practices replace recognition
3. Embodiment is rejected for disembodied rigpa
4. The non-dual body-mind is split

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates BODILY ERROR (somatic fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (body-based methods) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (body-mind dualism). The practitioner tries to escape their body.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, LINEAR ERROR]
MISREADING:
The text lists the twelve links: "Samsara all-by-means-of first not-distinguish make-not-possess nature from object grasp-by-means-of object arise and thought grasp from different appear object grasp connection twelve-as samsara first." A reader might think: "These are the twelve stages of samsara I need to understand in sequence. If I can trace them backward, I can reverse samsara."

WHY IT ARISES:
Lists trigger sequential thinking. Western linear minds want to follow the chain. Reversibility suggests the chain can be undone through understanding.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The practitioner traces the twelve links linearly, seeking to reverse them through understanding. They treat dependent origination as a reversible process.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
1. Twelve links are memorized sequentially
2. Reversal strategy is planned
3. The circular nature is missed
4. Dzogchen becomes linear problem-solving

CASCADE EFFECTS:
This generates LINEAR ERROR (sequential thinking) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding chain) → PRACTICE ERROR (reversal strategy). The practitioner tries to walk backward up the chain.
