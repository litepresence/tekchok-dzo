[999-1106] [FORM REALM ATTAINMENT ADDICTION] [DHYANA INTOXICATION]
**Misreading:**
The four great kings (*'phags skyes po*, *spyan mi bzang*, *rnam thos kyi bu*, *yul 'khor srung*) with their palaces, pleasure groves, and divine cities interpreted as literal celestial paradises to be attained through meditation—like booking a room in heaven.

**Why it arises:**
The elaborate descriptions of golden grounds, sandalwood water, wish-fulfilling trees, and flower-filled lakes sound like luxury resorts. The four directional guardians seem like powerful allies.

**Primary consequence:**
Meditation becomes reservation system for heavenly accommodations. The form realm is reified as destination rather than recognition-state.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners visualize palaces to manifest them. Merit is calculated as vacation points. Suffering is escaped rather than recognized.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [HEAVENLY TOURISM] (booking accommodations), [PALACE PROJECTION] (building mind-real estate), [GUARDIAN DEPENDENCY] (seeking protection), [DIVINE ELITISM] (special access), and [GOLDEN GROUND GRASPING] (attachment to beauty).

[1020-1106] [COSMIC ARCHITECTURE FETISHISM] [MERU MATERIALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate description of Indra's palace (*dbang po'i pho brang 'khor*), the thirty-three gods' city, pleasure groves (*skyed mos tshal*), and the cosmic tree (*yongs 'dus brtol*) interpreted as literal structures to be visited or visualized into existence—like cosmic real estate development.

**Why it arises:**
Specific measurements (150 yojanas, 50 yojanas), architectural details (stacked houses, jewel trees), and geographical features create sense of tangible place. The "see-beautiful" (*blta na sdug*) descriptions appeal to aesthetic desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmology is literalized as geography. Visualization practice becomes architectural drafting. Recognition is confused with visiting special locations.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners build mental palaces. Merit is measured in square yojanas. Enlightenment becomes address-specific.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [MEASUREMENT OBSESSION] (counting yojanas), [ARCHITECTURAL FANTASY] (designing heavens), [LOCATION SPIRITUALITY] (where matters), [STRUCTURAL RIGIDITY] (fixed forms), and [COSMIC TOURISM] (visiting realms).

[1080-1106] [FORMLESS REALM SUBSTANTIALISM] [NOTHINGNESS REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The formless realms (*gzugs med khams*)—infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception—interpreted as actual places or states to be attained and inhabited—like renting an apartment in the void.

**Why it arises:**
"Nothingness" (*ci yang med pa*) and "neither perception nor non-perception" (*'du shes med 'du shes med min*) sound like advanced achievements. The lifespan measurements (60,000, 80,000 kalpas) suggest duration equals depth.

**Primary consequence:**
Formlessness is reified as special location. Meditation aims at blank states. Recognition is confused with absence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek void-experiences. Ordinary awareness is rejected as too coarse. "Nothing" becomes something to get.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [VOID FETISHISM] (chasing emptiness), [BLANKNESS ADDICTION] (need for absence), [SUBTLE GRASPING] (seeking nothing), [NON-PERCEPTION OBSESSION] (avoiding experience), and [FORMLESS RIGIDITY] (fixation on no-form).
