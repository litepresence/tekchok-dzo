[999-1008] <guardian-deity-dependence> <protective-externalization>
**Misreading:**
The Four Great Kings (*'phags skyes po*, etc.) interpreted as actual protective deities who guard practitioners and directions—external powers to rely upon.

**Why it arises:**
"Guardian" suggests protection. Directional symbolism is universal. Fear seeks external security.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharma practice becomes seeking divine protection. Kings are worshipped for safety. Self-reliance is abandoned.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rituals for invoking guardians proliferate. Fear of "unprotected" directions. The natural protection of awareness is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <guardian-worship> (deity reliance), <directional-fear> (unprotected quarters), <external-protection> (seeking safety outside), <ritual-security> (ceremonies for protection).

[1009-1022] <solar-lunar-palace-fetish> <celestial-tourism>
**Misreading:**
The elaborate descriptions of Sun and Moon palaces (51 yojanas, fire-crystal base, etc.) interpreted as literal destinations to visit or be reborn in—cosmic luxury resorts.

**Why it arises:**
Specific measurements create tangibility. "Palace" suggests opulence. Celestial residences appeal to desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Sun/Moon become rebirth goals. Practitioners visualize palaces to manifest them. The empty nature of light is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Astronomical bodies are personified. Solar/lunar worship develops. Natural phenomena are replaced by palace-fantasies.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <celestial-palace-obsession> (seeking sun/moon residence), <light-reification> (palaces instead of luminosity), <astronomical-fetishism> (worshipping planets), <rebirth-aspiration> (wanting celestial birth).

---

[1023-1035] <indra-kingship> <divine-monarchy>
**Misreading:**
Indra (*dbang po*) as king of gods interpreted as confirming divine monarchy—hierarchical power structure to be revered or emulated.

**Why it arises:**
"King" suggests sovereignty. Thirty-three gods resemble court. Monarchical structures feel natural.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual hierarchy is projected onto cosmos. Indra's rule becomes model for human hierarchy. Democratic/egalitarian insights are lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Indra worship develops. Spiritual teachers claim "Indra-like" authority. The non-hierarchical nature of awareness is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <divine-monarchism> (hierarchical cosmos), <indra-cult> (worshipping celestial king), <authority-projection> (king as spiritual model), <hierarchical-spirituality> (ranking by divine proximity).

---

[1036-1048] <measurement-precisism> <cosmic-geometry>
**Misreading:**
The specific measurements (150 yojanas, 4500 yojanas, 80,000 leagues) interpreted as establishing precise cosmic scale—Buddhist equivalent of astronomical distances.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers create authority. Precision suggests knowledge. "Leagues" and "yojanas" sound scientific.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmology becomes quantified geography. The immeasurable nature of awareness is reduced to calculable dimensions.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners memorize cosmic measurements. Comparisons with modern astronomy ensue. The metaphorical function is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <cosmic-calculation> (measuring universe), <numerical-authority> (numbers as truth), <scientific-comparison> (Buddhism vs. physics), <quantification-obsession> (counting the infinite).

---

[1049-1062] <grove-romanticism> <paradise-escapism>
**Misreading:**
The four pleasure groves (*skyed mos tshal*) with specific characteristics interpreted as literal paradises—ideal vacation destinations to aspire to.

**Why it arises:**
"Pleasure" appeals to desire. "Grove" sounds like garden. Paradise narratives are universal.

**Primary consequence:**
Heavenly groves become rebirth goals. Practitioners visualize pleasure gardens. The emptiness of pleasure is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Escapism from worldly difficulties. "Real life is in the groves" becomes belief. Present circumstances are devalued.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <paradise-aspiration> (seeking pleasure groves), <escapist-fantasy> (fleeing reality), <grove-obsession> (visualizing gardens), <pleasure-spirituality> (enjoyment as goal).

---

[1063-1079] <wish-tree-materialism> <arbor-calitalism>
**Misreading:**
The cosmic wish-fulfilling tree (*yongs 'dus brtol*) with roots reaching down 5 yojanas, branches spreading 100 yojanas interpreted as actual tree producing desired objects—cosmic vending machine.

**Why it arises:**
"Wish-fulfilling" suggests magic. Specific measurements create tangibility. Trees are universally symbolic.

**Primary consequence:**
The tree is substantialized into object-producer. Practitioners seek "wish-fulfillment" through tree meditation. Desire is indulged, not recognized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism intensifies. "Get what I want" becomes practice. The empty nature of desire and fulfillment is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <wish-tree-worship> (venerating cosmic tree), <desire-gratification> (getting what I want), <arbor-fetishism> (tree as provider), <materialization-magic> (manifesting objects).

---

[1080-1095] <formless-samadhi-addiction> <blankness-chasing>
**Misreading:**
The formless realm attainments (*gzugs med khams*)—infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception—interpreted as advanced meditation goals to achieve through effort.

**Why it arises:**
"Formless" sounds superior. "Infinite" suggests profundity. The four attainments appear progressive.

**Primary consequence:**
Formlessness is substantialized as special state. Meditation becomes blankness-seeking. Recognition is confused with absence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners chase void-experiences. "Nothingness" becomes something to get. The natural clarity is obscured by seeking blankness.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <void-chasing> (seeking emptiness), <blankness-addiction> (need for absence), <formless-fixation> (obsession with no-form), <absence-fetishism> (valuing lack).

---

[1096-1110] <neither-nor-paradox> <cognitive-exhaustion>
**Misreading:**
The "neither perception nor non-perception" (*'du shes med 'du shes med min*) interpreted as ultimate cognitive achievement—transcending all categories through mental gymnastics.

**Why it arises:**
Paradox sounds profound. "Neither-nor" suggests transcendence. Philosophical sophistication appeals.

**Primary consequence:**
The attainment is intellectualized into conceptual puzzle. Practitioners try to "think neither-nor." The natural simplicity is replaced by cognitive strain.

**Secondary consequences:**
Mental exhaustion from attempting paradox. "I can't grasp it" becomes pride. The obvious nature is obscured by complexity.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <paradox-fetishism> (valuing contradictions), <cognitive-strain> (mental exhaustion), <neither-nor-obsession> (obsessive negation), <intellectual-spirituality> (thinking as meditation).

---

[1111-1125] <samadhi-emanation-materialism> <meditation-body-fetish>
**Misreading:**
The "samadhi emanation body" (*ting nge 'dzin gyi sprul pa'i lus*) interpreted as actual subtle body produced by meditation—something to develop and possess.

**Why it arises:**
"Emanation body" suggests creation. "Samadhi" implies power. Subtle bodies fascinate.

**Primary consequence:**
Meditation becomes body-building. Practitioners try to "create" emanation bodies. The emptiness of all bodies is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Subtle body obsession develops. "My samadhi body" becomes identity. The formless nature is replaced by subtle form.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <subtle-body-obsession> (building light body), <emanation-fetishism> (creating forms), <samadhi-materialism> (meditation produces things), <possessive-spirituality> (my emanation body).

---

[1126-1140] <existence-nonexistence-confusion> <ontological-exhaustion>
**Misreading:**
The "existence-nonexistence" (*yod min med min*) realms interpreted as describing actual ontological categories—beings who both exist and don't exist simultaneously.

**Why it arises:**
Paradox invites interpretation. "Neither exist nor not exist" sounds like quantum physics. Ontological speculation appeals.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmology becomes quantum mysticism. Practitioners try to "be neither existent nor nonexistent." The pedagogical point is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Confusion over "what they actually are." Philosophical debates about existence-status. The empty nature of all categories is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <quantum-mysticism> (Buddhism as physics), <ontological-confusion> (what exists), <paradox-paralysis> (cognitive freeze), <existential-anxiety> (being or not being).

---

[1141-1155] <higher-realm-escalation> <spiritual-altitude>
**Misreading:**
The hierarchy of formless realms (infinite space → infinite consciousness → nothingness → neither-nor) interpreted as ladder to climb—higher is better, more advanced.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchy feels natural. "Higher" suggests superiority. Progressive development is expected.

**Primary consequence:**
Formless attainments are moralized into stages. Practitioners compete over "how high." The equality of all appearances is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
"I'm in infinite consciousness" becomes boast. Lower realms are devalued. The groundlessness of all realms is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <altitude-competition> (climbing higher), <formless-elitism> (higher is better), <hierarchy-fixation> (ranking attainments), <stage-obsession> (tracking progress).

---

[1156-1170] <peaceful-samadhi-complacency> <tranquility-trap>
**Misreading:**
The "peaceful samadhi" (*ting nge 'dzin zhi ba*) interpreted as ultimate goal—blissful tranquility as highest achievement.

**Why it arises:**
"Peaceful" sounds desirable. "Bliss" appeals to pleasure. Tranquility contrasts with worldly stress.

**Primary consequence:**
Samadhi is substantialized as blissful state. Practitioners seek peaceful experiences. The dynamic clarity is replaced by tranquil dullness.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Peace" becomes avoidance. Challenging experiences are rejected. The natural brilliance is obscured by seeking comfort.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <tranquility-addiction> (seeking peace), <bliss-complacency> (enjoying comfort), <peace-fetishism> (avoiding disturbance), <samadhi-stagnation> (stuck in tranquility).

---

[1171-1185] <sprul-pa-ontology> <emanation-metaphysics>
**Misreading:**
The "emanation bodies" (*sprul pa'i lus*) appearing in various forms interpreted as establishing ontological category—actual type of body that exists.

**Why it arises:**
"Body" suggests entity. "Emanation" implies production. Typology invites categorization.

**Primary consequence:**
Emanation is substantialized into body-type. Practitioners study "three bodies" as metaphysics. The empty display is replaced by ontological classification.

**Secondary consequences:**
Body-ontology debates ensue. "Which body am I experiencing?" becomes obsession. The seamless nature is fragmented.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <body-typology> (categorizing forms), <emanation-ontology> (bodies as real), <metaphysical-obsession> (debating categories), <experiential-labeling> (naming experiences).

---

[1186-1200] <yid-lus-materialism> <mind-made-body-fetish>
**Misreading:**
The "mind-made body" (*yid las byung ba'i lus*) interpreted as actual subtle body created by mind—something to develop and perfect.

**Why it arises:**
"Mind-made" suggests power. "Body" implies something to have. Creation appeals to agency.

**Primary consequence:**
Mental creation is substantialized into body-building. Practitioners try to "make" subtle bodies. The emptiness of all forms is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
"My mind-made body" becomes identity. Comparison of "body quality." The formless nature is replaced by subtle materialism.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <mind-made-body-obsession> (building mental body), <subtle-materialism> (having light body), <creative-ego> (I made this), <bodily-identity> (my emanation form).

---

[1201-1215] <gnas-gsum-hierarchy> <triple-world-stratification>
**Misreading:**
The three realms (desire, form, formless) interpreted as rigid vertical hierarchy—spiritual caste system with formless at top as "best."

**Why it arises:**
Three suggests progression. "Formless" sounds advanced. Vertical metaphors dominate.

**Primary consequence:**
Realms are moralized into classes. Practitioners seek "higher" rebirth. The equality of all phenomena is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Form realm practitioner" becomes identity. Lower realms are pitied. The non-dual ground is obscured by hierarchy.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <realm-caste> (higher/lower birth), <vertical-competition> (climbing realms), <formless-elitism> (top is best), <rebirth-ambition> (seeking higher realms).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 999-1215 presents the most elaborate descriptions of celestial realms, palaces, measurements, and formless attainments in the text. This is peak cosmological detail covering the Four Kings, Indra's heaven, thirty-three gods, formless realms, and samadhi bodies.

**ERROR RISK:** The sheer density of architectural detail, measurements, and hierarchical structure makes literalization almost inevitable. Readers will almost certainly treat this as "the actual cosmology" unless carefully guided.

**SCHOLAR CHECK:** Ensure reader understands that all these descriptions—palaces, groves, measurements, bodies—are conventional designations (*tha snyad*) for awareness-display, not empirical geography or metaphysical claims.

**CONTINUITY NOTE:** Lines 1216+ continue with form realm elaboration and transition to the beings who inhabit these realms. The cosmological framework continues but shifts from structure to inhabitants.
