[18274-18275] <practice-error> [TECHNIQUE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18584-18606 mention specific practices: "wisdom arises from the eyes," "gazing upward," "turning the eyeballs upward," "sun and moon union," "gazing at space." The reader reduces Dzogchen to these physical techniques or takes them as essential methods.

**Why it arises:**
The concrete, specific instructions resemble yoga or physical practice. The technical detail suggests these are the actual methods; the surrounding text appears as philosophical explanation. Specificity implies importance.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen is reduced to physical technique—eye positions, gazes, postures. The understanding that these are merely supports for those who need them, skillful means rather than essence, is lost. The techniques become the path itself rather than supports for recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may obsess over proper technique—exact eye position, precise gaze, correct duration. They may believe doing the technique "correctly" produces realization. The effortless nature of recognition is obscured by effort to "do it right."

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [TECHNIQUE FIXATION ERROR] where method replaces recognition, [CORRECT PERFORMANCE ERROR] where doing it "right" becomes goal, [PHYSICALISM ERROR] where practice is reduced to body, [DURATION ERROR] where time spent is measured, and [PERFECTIONISM] where technique is polished.

[18276-18286] [UPWARD GAZE ERROR] [DIRECTION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18589-18596 specifically describe "gazing upward," "turning the eyeballs upward toward the brows," "gazing at space," and similar directional practices. The reader understands these spatial directions as essential to the practice.

**Why it arises:**
The specific directional language (upward, toward brows, at space) suggests precise technique. Spatial orientation feels concrete and doable. The association of "up" with spiritual, heavens, transcendence is culturally reinforced.

**Primary consequence:**
The directional gaze is literalized as necessary for realization. Practitioners may believe looking upward somehow activates wisdom or connects to higher states. The metaphorical function—interrupting ordinary perception, creating slight disorientation—is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may develop fixation on upward gaze, believing it essential. They may judge their practice by whether they maintain upward gaze sufficiently. Physical strain or headache may develop. The natural, effortless recognition is replaced by forced technique.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [DIRECTION FIXATION] where spatial orientation is grasped, [POSTURE ERROR] where body position becomes essential, [STRAIN ERROR] where physical effort increases, [DURATION OBSESSION] where gaze must be maintained, and [SPATIAL ERROR] where "up" has spiritual significance.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 433 continues the wisdom enumeration with twenty-five-fold elaboration and introduces light imagery and specific practices. The spatial metaphors (expanse, pervasion) invite reification. The directional practices (upward gaze) establish technique fixation. Page 434 will describe object wisdom and progress signs, amplifying objectification and developmental errors. The light imagery will continue and must be recognized as metaphor for clarity, not literal visual phenomena. The twenty-five wisdom structure maintains the enumeration pattern from previous pages. The specific techniques mentioned here (eye gaze, etc.) will be referenced in subsequent pages and must be understood as provisional supports. The spatial language throughout risks geometric interpretation of non-duality.

[18287-18295] [OBJECT ERROR] [EXPERIENCE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18607-18641 describe three types of object wisdom (yul gyi ye shes): "wisdom of appearances" (snang ba'i ye shes), "wisdom of emptiness" (stong pa'i ye shes), and "wisdom of objects" (yul gyi ye shes). The reader understands these as different experiences or states to be achieved through practice.

**Why it arises:**
The threefold classification (gsum) suggests a complete typology of wisdom types. The object-oriented language (yul gyi) suggests wisdom is about objects, has objects, or takes objects. The distinct names imply distinct phenomena.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom is completely objectified as having content, being about something, or being directed toward objects. The non-referential, non-objectifiable nature of recognition is obscured by the very description of wisdom's "types" and "objects."

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may cycle through seeking "appearance wisdom," then "emptiness wisdom," then "object wisdom." They may try to have experiences corresponding to each type. New forms of temporal practice and goal-orientation develop around experiencing each wisdom-type.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [OBJECTIFICATION ERROR] where wisdom becomes content of experience, [CYCLING ERROR] where practitioners move between states, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where types become goals, [ACCUMULATION ERROR] where all three must be collected, and [TYPE FIXATION] where categories are reified.

[18296-18304] [GRADUATION ERROR] [PROGRESS ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18643-18660 describe how experience "increases like the waxing moon" from new moon to full moon, and mentions "signs" (rtags) and "marks" (mtshan) of progress. The reader understands this as describing necessary developmental stages that all practitioners must pass through.

**Why it arises:**
The developmental language (increase, waxing, progress) naturally suggests gradual growth over time. The lunar metaphor implies predictable, natural progression. We are habituated to understanding spiritual growth as developmental. Signs and marks suggest measurable indicators.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is completely temporalized as a process with stages, phases, and progress indicators. What is actually timeless and immediate appears as something that develops gradually over time with practice, like a moon waxing from new to full.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may constantly evaluate their practice by whether they experience "progress" or see "signs." Self-evaluation and comparison with others become ongoing activities. The simplicity of recognition is complicated by developmental frameworks.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [STAGE ERROR] where path is reified as stages, [SELF-EVALUATION ERROR] where practitioners assess progress, [COMPARISON ERROR] where others are measured, [EXPECTATION ERROR] where signs are awaited, and [DEVELOPMENTAL FIXATION] where growth is assumed.

[18305-18313] [MOON ERROR] [PHASE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18643-18652 specifically compare wisdom's increase to "the waxing moon"—from "new moon not seen" to "one day to fifteen days gradually arising" to "full moon complete." The reader literalizes this as describing actual phases of practice development.

**Why it arises:**
The lunar metaphor is vivid, culturally resonant, and suggests natural, inevitable progression. The specificity (one day to fifteen days) suggests precise mapping. The comparison to moon phases implies universal pattern.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphor is literalized as actual description of practice stages. Practitioners may believe they should experience "new moon" phase, then gradually advance through "waxing" phases, eventually reaching "full moon" completion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may evaluate themselves by which "moon phase" they are in. They may believe staying in "new moon" means failure, while reaching "full moon" means success. The metaphor that should liberate becomes new prison.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PHASE FIXATION] where lunar stages are mapped to practice, [CALENDAR ERROR] where days are counted, [COMPLETIONISM] where full moon is awaited, [SELF-ASSESSMENT] where phase is identified, and [NATURALIZATION] where progression is assumed inevitable.

[18314-18322] [SIGN ERROR] [INDICATOR ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18653-18660 describe "signs" (rtags) and "marks" (mtshan) of wisdom—bodily, verbal, and mental signs that indicate wisdom's presence. The reader understands these as reliable indicators that can be recognized and cultivated.

**Why it arises:**
The language of signs and marks suggests objective indicators. The specificity (bodily, verbal, mental) implies systematic observation. We naturally seek confirmation that practice is working.

**Primary consequence:**
Signs become objectified as reliable indicators of wisdom. Practitioners may watch for signs, believe they indicate progress, or try to produce them. The understanding that signs are provisional, may be mistaken, and are not wisdom itself is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may become obsessed with sign-watching—monitoring their body, speech, and mind for indicators. They may fake signs or interpret ordinary phenomena as special. The natural recognition is replaced by sign-production.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SIGN FIXATION] where indicators are watched, [INTERPRETATION ERROR] where phenomena are analyzed, [PRODUCTION ERROR] where signs are manufactured, [SELF-MONITORING] where constant checking occurs, and [CONFIRMATION SEEKING] where validation is needed.

[18323-18332] [TATHAGATAGARBHA ERROR] [BUDDHA-NATURE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18661-18685 extensively quote tathagatagarbha scriptures—Tathagatagarbha Sutra, Uttaratantra, Saraha's Doha—stating "all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature" and "all sentient beings are Buddhas." The reader reifies Buddha-nature as an actual entity, essence, or latent capacity within beings.

**Why it arises:**
The term "Buddha-nature" (sangs rgyas kyi snying po) and phrases like "all sentient beings are Buddhas" suggest possession of an inner essence, seed, or potential. Language naturally substantializes. The scriptural authority makes these claims difficult to question.

**Primary consequence:**
Buddha-nature becomes reified as a hidden treasure, true self, permanent essence, or latent capacity waiting to manifest. The emptiness of Buddha-nature—even Buddha-nature is empty—is completely missed in favor of eternalistic interpretation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may search for their "inner Buddha," creating subtle self-grasping. They may assume they are "already perfect" and need do nothing, missing the distinction between basis and recognition. Or they may believe they must "actualize" their Buddha-nature through effort.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [TREASURE HUNTING ERROR] where Buddha-nature is sought as object, [ETERNALISM ERROR] where emptiness is reified as essence, [LATENT ERROR] where potential is grasped, [ACTUALIZATION ERROR] where nature must be made manifest, and [PASSIVITY ERROR] where "already Buddha" justifies inaction.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 434 introduces object wisdom types and developmental progress markers. The waxing moon metaphor particularly invites temporalization. The tathagatagarbha citations set up Buddha-nature errors that continue through page 435. Page 435 will elaborate Buddha-nature and obscuration. The signs and marks language establishes indicator fixation. The three object wisdoms maintain the typological approach of previous pages. The moon phases metaphor will be referenced in subsequent discussions of progress. The extensive scriptural citations on this page require hermeneutical awareness. The tathagatagarbha theme will be central to page 435's discussion.

[18333-18344] [SPONTANEITY ERROR] [NATURALNESS ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18314-18349 extensively describe self-perfected wisdom (rang bzhin lhun grub kyi ye shes) as "spontaneously present from the beginning," "without accepting or rejecting," "naturally perfected," "effortless," "without deliberate action," and "without hope or fear." The reader interprets this as license for complete passive inaction and abandonment of all practice.

**Why it arises:**
Terms like "spontaneous" (lhun gyis grub), "natural" (rang bzhin), "without effort" (rtsol sgrub med), "without deliberate action" (bya bral), and "without accepting or rejecting" (blang dor med) strongly suggest that doing nothing is the practice. This appeals powerfully to the desire for easy liberation without difficulty, discipline, or structure.

**Primary consequence:**
The crucial distinction between natural spontaneity (which recognizes its own nature) and habitual patterning (which continues unconsciously) is completely missed. All behavior is reified as "natural," eliminating the need for recognition or any practice whatsoever.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners abandon all effort, discipline, and structure, mistaking ordinary habits, neuroses, and confusion for spontaneous wisdom. "Just be natural" becomes justification for continuing unconscious patterns. Naturalness rationalizes lack of transformation.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [LAZY ERROR] where "natural" justifies inaction, [SPIRITUAL BYPASSING ERROR] where recognition is claimed without transformation, [HABIT ERROR] where conditioning is indulged, [RATIONALIZATION ERROR] where confusion is justified, and [DISCIPLINE DISMISSAL] where structure is rejected.

[18345-18357] [FIVE WISDOM ERROR] [NUMBER ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18350-18404 enumerate the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga)—mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, and dharmadhatu wisdoms—with detailed characteristics for each. The reader treats these as five distinct psychological faculties or ontological realities to be individually cultivated or experienced.

**Why it arises:**
The fivefold structure (rnam pa lnga) suggests a complete, systematic description of enlightened awareness. The detailed characteristics appear to map out distinct aspects. Buddhist teachings on five wisdoms train us to accept this enumeration.

**Primary consequence:**
The unity of the five wisdoms is completely missed. What are actually five aspects of single recognition appear as separate attainments. The understanding that all five are simply rigpa recognized from different angles is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate each wisdom separately—developing mirror-like clarity, then equality, etc. They may seek experiences corresponding to each. The natural presence of all five is obscured by cultivation efforts.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become things to develop, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific experiences are sought, [SEQUENTIAL ERROR] where wisdoms are pursued one by one, and [COLLECTION ERROR] where all five must be gathered.

[18358-18369] [POETIC ERROR] [METAPHOR ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18405-18427 present extensive verse descriptions using poetic imagery: "like the sun's orb" (nyi ma'i dkyil 'drar), "like space" (nam mkha' ltar), "like a wish-fulfilling jewel" (yid bzhin nor bu ltar), "like the moon's reflection in water" (chu zla ltar). The reader literalizes these into required experiences or metaphysical claims about wisdom's nature.

**Why it arises:**
The poetic language is beautiful, evocative, and memorable. Our minds naturally grasp at vivid imagery. The metaphors seem to describe what wisdom is "like," suggesting experiential qualities.

**Primary consequence:**
The pointing function of poetry is completely missed. What should evoke recognition becomes object of aesthetic appreciation or metaphysical speculation. Metaphor is mistaken for meaning.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may seek "sun-like" clarity, "space-like" openness as experiences. They may judge meditation by correspondence to images. The natural recognition is obscured by pursuit of poetic qualities.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [AESTHETIC ERROR] where beautiful descriptions become goals, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific qualities are sought, [COMPARISON ERROR] where practice is measured, and [IMAGERY DEPENDENCE] where recognition requires poetic language.

[18370-18382] [KNOWABLE ERROR] [OBJECT ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18425-18464 distinguish wisdom "encompassed by knower" (shes pas bsdus pa) and wisdom "encompassed by knowables" (shes byas bsdus pa). The reader understands these as two different types of knowledge or cognitive modes requiring separate understanding.

**Why it arises:**
The grammatical structure suggests classification into types. The distinction between knower and known appears to create two categories of wisdom.

**Primary consequence:**
The unity of knowing and knowable in wisdom is completely missed. What are two ways of describing wisdom's all-pervasiveness appear as separate categories.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate "knower wisdom" or "knowable wisdom" separately. The natural inseparability of subject and object is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SUBJECT-OBJECT ERROR] where knower and known remain dualistic, [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become objects of practice, and [SEPARATION ERROR] where unity is divided.

[18383-18395] [VEILING ERROR] [OBSCURATION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18686-18705 describe how Buddha-nature isn't seen because it is "covered by bodily obscurations" (sgrib g.yogs) and compare it to the sun covered by clouds. The reader understands this as describing real veils that must be removed through practice.

**Why it arises:**
The metaphor of covering/obscuring naturally suggests layers to be peeled away. The sun/cloud comparison reinforces sense of something hidden behind something else.

**Primary consequence:**
The co-emergent nature of ground and ignorance is completely missed. What is actually co-emergent appears sequential: first Buddha-nature, then covering, then uncovering.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may attempt to "remove veils" through various practices, creating new forms of doing. The effortless nature of recognition is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PURIFICATION ERROR] where practice becomes cleansing, [LAYERS ERROR] where reality appears stratified, [REMOVAL ERROR] where obscurations are eliminated, and [EFFORT ERROR] where doing increases.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 435 continues the five wisdom elaboration with detailed poetic imagery. The spontaneity language invites laziness errors. The veiling language sets up purification errors. Page 436 will present twenty-five wisdom enumeration and expanse metaphors. Page 437 will continue with light imagery and specific practices. The tathagatagarbha theme continues through these pages. The extensive imagery throughout requires recognition as pointers, not prescriptions.

[18396-18410] [POETIC ERROR] [METAPHOR ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18405-18427 present extensive poetic verse descriptions of the five wisdoms using rich imagery: "like the sun's orb" (nyi ma'i dkyil 'drar gsal), "like space" (nam mkha' ltar yangs), "like a wish-fulfilling jewel" (yid bzhin nor bu ltar), "like the moon's reflection in water" (chu zla ltar snang). The reader literalizes these into required experiences or metaphysical claims about the essential nature of wisdom.

**Why it arises:**
The poetic language is exquisitely beautiful, evocative, and memorable. Our minds naturally grasp at vivid imagery, especially when enhanced by literary translation. The metaphors seem to describe precisely what wisdom is "like," suggesting specific experiential qualities. Vivid imagery appears to capture truth more accurately than abstract language.

**Primary consequence:**
The pointing function of poetry is completely missed. What are meant to evoke recognition through resonance, suggestion, and beauty become objects of aesthetic appreciation, metaphysical speculation, or experiential pursuit. The metaphor is mistaken for the meaning, the finger for the moon.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may actively seek "sun-like" clarity, "space-like" openness, "jewel-like" fulfillment, or "moon-reflection-like" purity as meditation goals. They may compare their meditation experiences to these images, judging success by aesthetic correspondence. The natural, unadorned recognition is obscured by pursuit of poetic qualities.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [AESTHETIC ERROR] where beautiful descriptions become goals, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific qualities are sought, [COMPARISON ERROR] where practice is measured against imagery, [POETIC FIXATION] where metaphors are literalized, and [IMAGERY DEPENDENCE] where recognition requires poetic language.

[18411-18425] [KNOWABLE ERROR] [OBJECT ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18425-18464 distinguish between wisdom "encompassed by knower" (shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes) and wisdom "encompassed by knowables" (shes byas bsdus pa'i ye shes). The reader understands these as describing two fundamentally different types of knowledge, cognition, or wisdom requiring separate understanding and cultivation.

**Why it arises:**
The grammatical structure (shes pas vs. shes byas + bsdus pa) naturally suggests a classification into distinct types. The explicit distinction between knower and known appears to create two separate categories of wisdom. Academic training encourages identifying, distinguishing, and cataloging types of knowledge.

**Primary consequence:**
The profound unity of knowing and knowable in wisdom is completely missed. What are actually two ways of describing wisdom's all-pervasiveness—wisdom as that which knows all phenomena, and wisdom as that which is the nature of all known phenomena—appear as separate categories or types.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may attempt to cultivate "knower wisdom" or "knowable wisdom" as separate projects. They may debate the relative importance of each or pursue one as primary and the other as secondary. The natural inseparability of subject and object in recognition is obscured by categorical thinking.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SUBJECT-OBJECT ERROR] where knower and known remain dualistic, [CULTIVATION ERROR] where wisdoms become objects of separate practice, [TYPOLOGY ERROR] where types are grasped, and [SEPARATION ERROR] where unity is divided into categories.

[18426-18441] [CALCULATION ERROR] [MULTIPLICATION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18465-18495 present the elaborate system where each of the five wisdoms is subdivided into five aspects, creating twenty-five wisdoms total (5 × 5 = 25). The mathematical precision suggests this represents the actual structure of enlightened awareness.

**Why it arises:**
The systematic multiplication (five wisdoms × five aspects each) suggests rigorous, complete classification. The mathematical precision (5 × 5 = 25) implies accuracy and systematic knowledge. The thoroughness of enumeration appears to provide comprehensive coverage of wisdom's varieties.

**Primary consequence:**
The single essence of wisdom is completely obscured by its multiple descriptions. What is actually one recognition appearing in various contexts or described from different perspectives appears as twenty-five different wisdoms to be understood, cultivated, and experienced individually.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of twenty-five wisdoms or, conversely, collect knowledge about them as a form of spiritual accomplishment. They may study elaborate charts mapping the twenty-five wisdoms. The simple fact of recognition is lost in elaborate taxonomy.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [COMPLEXITY ERROR] where the path appears unnecessarily complicated, [CATALOGING ERROR] where wisdom-knowledge replaces recognition, [OVERWHELM ERROR] where quantity defeats practice, and [MULTIPLICITY ERROR] where one becomes many.

[18442-18456] [EXPANSE ERROR] [SPACE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18496-18511 describe dharmadhatu wisdom using spatial metaphors: "vast expanse of dharmadhatu" (chos dbyings klong yangs), "great expanse of clear light," "dharmadhatu of outer and inner," "all-pervading like space" (nam mkha' ltar khyab). The reader reifies dharmadhatu as a vast container, cosmic field, or infinite space.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial language (klong, dbyings, khyab pa) naturally suggests extension, vastness, pervasion, and containment. Our embodied cognition interprets "expanse" literally as something with dimensions in which phenomena occur. The pervasion metaphor suggests something that extends everywhere, containing all things.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharmadhatu is objectified as a vast space, container, field, or cosmic matrix in which phenomena arise, dwell, and cease. The non-dual nature of dharmadhatu—neither container nor contained, neither space nor what fills space, neither vast nor small—is completely missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may seek "vastness" or "spaciousness" as experiences of dharmadhatu. They may try to "expand into" the expanse, "merge with" space, or "rest in" vastness. Altered states of expanded awareness, openness, or boundlessness are mistaken for recognition of dharmadhatu.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SPATIAL ERROR] where non-duality is understood geometrically, [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR] where specific sensations become dharmadhatu, [CONTAINER ERROR] where dharmadhatu holds phenomena, and [MERGING ERROR] where union with space is sought.

[18457-18472] [INNER-OUTER ERROR] [DIRECTION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18511-18569 describe "inner wisdom" (nang gi ye shes) and "outer wisdom" (phyi'i ye shes), "wisdom of the body" (lus kyi ye shes) and "wisdom of dharmadhatu." The reader understands these as describing actually distinct domains or locations of wisdom.

**Why it arises:**
The spatial distinction between inner and outer is fundamental to ordinary experience. The classification suggests wisdom exists in different locations or domains. The body/dharmadhatu distinction appears to create categories.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom is objectified as existing in different places—inside, outside, in body, in dharmadhatu. The understanding that these are simply different ways of pointing to the same recognition is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may seek "inner wisdom" through introspection or "outer wisdom" through observation. They may believe body wisdom is different from dharmadhatu wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [LOCATION ERROR] where wisdom is sought in places, [INTROSPECTION ERROR] where looking inward is privileged, [DOMAIN ERROR] where categories are reified, and [DIRECTION ERROR] where spatial orientation matters.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 436 presents the twenty-five wisdom enumeration and spatial metaphors. The inner/outer distinction maintains spatial errors from previous pages. Page 437 will present light imagery and specific practices. Page 438 will describe object wisdom and progress signs. Page 439 will elaborate tathagatagarbha. Page 440 will conclude this section. The extensive enumeration throughout these pages requires recognition as pedagogical tools. The spatial language must be understood metaphorically.

[18473-18491] [MANIFESTATION ERROR] [LIGHT ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18570-18606 describe "wisdom-pervading objects" (yul la khyab pa'i ye shes) as "inner light rays" (nang gi zer) and their external projection as "appearances of wisdom"—with five colors, like sun, firefly, butter lamp, moon, and stars. The reader sees this as describing actual visual phenomena or metaphysical optics.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed phenomenology of light—colors, sources, characteristics—resembles descriptions of visionary experiences. Technical terms like "light rays" (zer), "projection" ('phro ba), "clarity" (gsal ba) suggest physical or energetic phenomena.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical nature of light imagery is completely missed. What describes the clarity, luminosity, and cognizance aspects of awareness becomes literalized as actual visual phenomena to be experienced.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may seek light experiences, interpret visions as wisdom-appearances, or become attached to specific visual phenomena. The natural clarity of ordinary awareness is overlooked.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [VISION ERROR] where experiences are reified as signs, [CHASING LIGHT ERROR] where specific phenomena become goals, [COLOR ERROR] where five colors are sought, and [LUMINOSITY FIXATION] where brightness is pursued.

[18492-18510] <practice-error> [TECHNIQUE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18584-18606 mention specific practices: "wisdom arises from the eyes," "gazing upward," "turning the eyeballs upward," "sun and moon union," "gazing at space." The reader reduces Dzogchen to these physical techniques.

**Why it arises:**
The concrete instructions resemble yoga or physical practice. The technical detail suggests these are the actual methods.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen is reduced to physical technique. The understanding that these are merely supports for those who need them is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may obsess over proper technique, creating new forms of grasping. The effortless nature of recognition is obscured by effort to "do it correctly."

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [TECHNIQUE FIXATION ERROR] where method replaces recognition, [CORRECT PERFORMANCE ERROR] where doing it "right" becomes goal, and [PHYSICALISM ERROR] where practice is reduced to body.

[18511-18530] [UPWARD GAZE ERROR] [DIRECTION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18589-18596 describe "gazing upward," "turning the eyeballs upward toward the brows," "gazing at space." The reader understands these spatial directions as essential to the practice.

**Why it arises:**
The specific directional language suggests precise technique. Spatial orientation feels concrete and doable.

**Primary consequence:**
The directional gaze is literalized as necessary for realization. The metaphorical function—interrupting ordinary perception—is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may develop fixation on upward gaze, believing it essential. Physical strain or headache may develop.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [DIRECTION FIXATION] where spatial orientation is grasped, [POSTURE ERROR] where body position becomes essential, and [STRAIN ERROR] where physical effort increases.

[18531-18549] [FIVE COLOR ERROR] [PHENOMENAL ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18596-18606 describe five colors (white, blue, yellow, red, green) as manifestations of wisdom. The reader literalizes these as actual visual phenomena to be seen.

**Why it arises:**
The specificity of five colors suggests precise phenomenology. The association of colors with wisdom elements appears systematic.

**Primary consequence:**
The colors are objectified as real manifestations. Practitioners may seek to see these colors in meditation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Color experiences are interpreted as signs of wisdom. Ordinary visual perception is devalued.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [COLOR FIXATION] where specific hues are sought, [PHENOMENAL ERROR] where appearances are reified, and [INTERPRETATION ERROR] where visions are analyzed.

[18550-18569] [SUN MOON ERROR] [UNION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18589-18590 mention "sun and moon union" (nyi zla kha sbyor). The reader understands this as describing an actual practice or metaphysical state.

**Why it arises:**
The sun-moon symbolism is powerful and ubiquitous in tantra. "Union" suggests special integration.

**Primary consequence:**
Sun-moon union is literalized as technique or goal. The understanding that this points to non-dual recognition is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may seek sun-moon experiences or believe this describes subtle body physiology.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SYMBOL LITERALISM] where metaphors are techniques, [ENERGETIC ERROR] where subtle body is manipulated, and [GOAL ORIENTATION] where union is pursued.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
Page 437 concludes the wisdom section with light imagery and specific practices. The errors established here continue themes from previous pages. Page 438 will transition to new topics.

[18570-18583] [OBJECT ERROR] [EXPERIENCE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18607-18641 describe three types of object wisdom (yul gyi ye shes): "wisdom of appearances" (snang ba'i ye shes), "wisdom of emptiness" (stong pa'i ye shes), and "wisdom of objects" (yul gyi ye shes). The reader understands these as different experiences or states to be achieved.

**Why it arises:**
The threefold classification suggests a complete typology. The object-oriented language suggests wisdom is about objects.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom is objectified as having content or being about something. The non-referential nature of recognition is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may cycle through seeking different wisdom-types. New forms of goal-orientation develop.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [OBJECTIFICATION ERROR] where wisdom becomes content, [CYCLING ERROR] where practitioners move between states, and [TYPE FIXATION] where categories are reified.

[18584-18598] [GRADUATION ERROR] [PROGRESS ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18643-18660 describe experience "increasing like the waxing moon" and mention "signs" and "marks" of progress. The reader sees this as describing necessary developmental stages.

**Why it arises:**
The developmental language suggests gradual growth. The lunar metaphor implies predictable progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is temporalized as a process with stages. What is timeless appears as developing over time.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners evaluate practice by "progress" and "signs." Self-evaluation and comparison develop.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [STAGE ERROR] where path has stages, [SELF-EVALUATION ERROR] where progress is measured, and [EXPECTATION ERROR] where signs are awaited.

[18599-18609] [MOON ERROR] [PHASE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18643-18652 compare wisdom's increase to "the waxing moon" from new to full. The reader literalizes this as practice phases.

**Why it arises:**
The lunar metaphor suggests natural progression. The specificity implies precise mapping.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphor is literalized as actual practice stages.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners evaluate themselves by "moon phase."

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PHASE FIXATION] where lunar stages map to practice and [CALENDAR ERROR] where days are counted.
