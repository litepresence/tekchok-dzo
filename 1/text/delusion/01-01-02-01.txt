[175-182] [COSMOLOGICAL LITERALISM ERROR] [GEOGRAPHIC REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The descriptions of twenty-five fields, Mount Meru, seven seas, four continents, and specific locations (Akanishta, Dense Array) interpreted as actual cosmic geography—physical places existing somewhere in the universe.

**Why it arises:**
The text uses concrete spatial language ("fields," "above," "below," "pervading"). Modern readers alternate between two false options: (1) accepting as literal geography (fundamentalism) or (2) rejecting as ancient superstition (scientific dismissal). Both miss the mandalic function.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen cosmology becomes either literal cosmography to be believed or outdated mythology to be ignored. The rich symbolic meaning is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners visualize these fields as actual places during meditation, trying to "go there" through imagination. The "field of Dense Array" becomes a destination rather than recognition-state.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SPATIAL DUALISM] (here vs. there), [FUNDAMENTALIST ACCEPTANCE] (believing impossible geography), [SCIENTIFIC DISMISSAL] (rejecting entire teaching), [MEDITATION TOURISM] (visualizing travel to pure lands), and [SYMBOLIC BLINDNESS] (missing metaphorical richness).

[183-193] [SHAPE SYMBOLISM OVERSIMPLIFICATION] [MANDALIC REDUCTION]
**Misreading:**
The round, four-cornered, crescent, and semi-circular fields understood as merely symbolizing psychological states—round = wholeness, square = stability, etc.—reducing them to Jungian archetypes.

**Why it arises:**
Modern psychology teaches that symbols "represent" inner states. The geometric descriptions invite symbolic interpretation. Academic Buddhist studies often reduce mandalas to psychological symbolism.

**Primary consequence:**
The fields become metaphors for mental states rather than descriptions of how awareness actually appears when recognized. The ontological claim is softened into phenomenological metaphor.

**Secondary consequences:**
Round fields become "feeling complete," square fields become "seeking stability." The specific details (number of fields, arrangement) are dismissed as cultural ornamentation.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [PSYCHOLOGICAL REDUCTION] (Buddhism as therapy), [SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION] (metaphor over reality), [DETAIL DISMISSAL] (missing specificity), [JUNGIAN PROJECTION] (archetypal framework), and [ONTOLOGICAL WEAKENING] (what is becomes what seems).

[194-203] [BODY-SPEECH-MIND ENUMERATION ERROR] [ATTRIBUTE AGGREGATION]
**Misreading:**
The fivefold pervasion (body, speech, mind, qualities, activities) interpreted as listing attributes that the Buddha possesses—like listing qualities on a resume.

**Why it arises:**
The enumeration (*sku dang gsung dang thugs dang yon tan dang 'phrin las*) resembles lists of attributes. Western theological tradition catalogs divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, benevolence).

**Primary consequence:**
Awakened nature is substantialized into a being with parts and properties. The Buddha becomes an entity possessing body, speech, mind—reinforcing personification.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners try to develop these five attributes through practice. Body pervasion becomes physical presence, speech pervasion becomes eloquence, etc. Natural display is turned into acquisition goals.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [ATTRIBUTION ERROR] (attaching properties to emptiness), [ACQUISITION PRACTICE] (trying to get five attributes), [SUBSTANTIALIST BUDDHA] (entity with parts), [THEOLOGICAL MAPPING] (Christian/Buddhist hybrid), and [PROGRESS TRACKING] (measuring development of attributes).

[204-214] [ETERNALISM ERROR] [BEGINNINGLESSNESS MISUNDERSTOOD]
**Misreading:**
"Having come in beginningless time" (thog ma med pa'i dus su byon nas) interpreted as meaning that Samantabhadra has existed eternally—without beginning and therefore without end.

**Why it arises:**
"Beginningless" (thog ma med pa) sounds like "eternal" in English. Theistic traditions have eternal deities. Philosophical traditions debate eternalism vs. nihilism.

**Primary consequence:**
Samantabhadra is reified as an eternal entity, contradicting the core Buddhist teaching of anatman (no eternal self). Dzogchen ground becomes a permanent substratum.

**Secondary consequences:**
If Samantabhadra is eternal, then enlightenment is eternal too, creating logical paradoxes about samsara's origin. The "beginningless wheel" becomes cosmic cycles rather than timeless immediacy.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [ATMAN DOCTRINE] (eternal self), [METAPHYSICAL SUBSTRATUM] (ground as permanent base), [PARADOX CONFUSION] (how does samsara arise from eternal purity?), [ETERNALISTIC EXTREME] (one of the two extremes Buddha avoided), and [ONTOLOGICAL FIXATION] (thing that exists timelessly).

[215-225] [FIELD NAME SUBSTANTIALISM] [THREE KAYA PLACES]
**Misreading:**
The three specific field names—Luminous-Clarity Vajra-Essence Field, Brahma's Drum-Sound Field, Great Brahma Eon Field—understood as three distinct locations, each associated with a different kaya level.

**Why it arises:**
The text names specific fields for each kaya. "In the time of Dharma-body, it's called..." suggests temporal phases and spatial locations. The names sound like place-names.

**Primary consequence:**
The three kayas are spatialized into three realms or dimensions one can access. Practitioners try to "reach" the Dharmakaya field as highest, then descend to emanation fields.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen becomes a cosmic geography with travel routes between fields. The "field of luminous-clarity" becomes a meditation goal—trying to "get to" that field through practice.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SPATIAL HIERARCHY] (higher and lower fields), [TRAVEL METAPHOR] (going to Dharmakaya), [LOCATION FIXATION] (specific fields as destinations), [KAYA SEPARATION] (three places vs. three aspects), and [MEDITATION NAVIGATION] (trying to move between fields).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 4 continues the cosmological exposition from Page 3, now describing the five-family mandala and fields. Line 111 continues onto Page 5 with "...and those teachers who came in the three times..."

The three field names (lines 106-109) might appear to complete the three-kaya framework, but Pages 5-6 will elaborate on how these fields function and their relationship to practitioners.

ERROR RISK: Readers may treat the three field names as a complete taxonomy, missing that Longchenpa will complicate this simple mapping in subsequent pages (e.g., showing how all three are simultaneously present).

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands Pages 4-6 as continuous exposition of the "perfect place" (gnas phun sum tshogs pa), not a self-contained cosmological chapter.

[226-232] [NUMERICAL LITERALISM ERROR] [MAGNITUDE MISUNDERSTANDING]
**Misreading:**
The numerical claims (Buddhas as numerous as Ganges sand-grains, twelve yojana palaces, thousands of gods) interpreted as precise quantitative assertions about objective reality, to be accepted literally or rejected as unscientific exaggeration.

**Why it arises:**
The text uses specific numbers (twelve, thousands, "as many as"). Scientific worldview treats numbers as empirical claims. Buddhist texts often use hyperbolic numbers ("innumerable," "countless"), which modern readers parse as either literal or false.

**Primary consequence:**
The "hair-tip containing countless Buddha-fields" becomes either an absurd claim requiring suspension of disbelief or poetic exaggeration to be dismissed. The actual point—that appearance is non-local and unbounded—is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Skeptical readers reject the text as pre-scientific mythology. Believing readers accept impossible cosmology as test of faith. Both miss that these numbers point to the unquantifiable nature of awareness, not cosmic geography.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [FUNDAMENTALIST ACCEPTANCE] (believing impossible numbers), [SCIENTIFIC REJECTION] (dismissing as unscientific), [QUANTIFICATION FALLACY] (treating boundless as countable), [POETIC DIMINISHMENT] ("it's just metaphor"), and [EPISTEMIC CONFUSION] (uncertainty about what claims mean).

[233-240] [SPATIAL COEXISTENCE PARADOX] [HELL/HEAVEN CO-LOCATION]
**Misreading:**
The description of hell realms, god palaces, and Buddha-fields all existing "in the space of a hair-tip" without mixing or interfering interpreted as describing actual spatial paradox—physics-defying co-location.

**Why it arises:**
The text explicitly states they coexist "without mixing" ('dres pa med cing) and "without harm" (gnod par gyur pa med). This sounds like physical impossibility. Quantum physics enthusiasts may map this onto quantum superposition.

**Primary consequence:**
The simultaneity of realms is spatialized into paradoxical physics. The text's actual meaning—that these are different modes of perception, not locations—is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Buddha-fields become parallel dimensions. Hell and heaven are "actually" in the same space, accessed through different vibrational frequencies or dimensional shifts.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [QUANTUM MISAPPROPRIATION] (Dzogchen as quantum physics), [DIMENSIONAL PROLIFERATION] (many worlds interpretation), [PARADOX FETISHISM] (valuing contradictions), [PHYSICALIZATION ERROR] (experiential into physical), and [CO-LOCATION CONFUSION] (places in same place).

[241-248] [DREAM ANALOGY DIMINISHMENT] [ONTOLOGICAL REDUCTION]
**Misreading:**
The dream analogy ("like a dream," "like an illusion") understood as meaning "not real" in the sense of "fake," "unimportant," or "should be dismissed"—reducing all appearances to insignificance.

**Why it arises:**
"Dream" and "illusion" in English carry connotations of unreality, insignificance, "just a dream." The negative prefix "un-" suggests privation. Academic treatments often emphasize emptiness as negation.

**Primary consequence:**
The dreamlike nature of appearances is interpreted as nihilistic denial—nothing matters, nothing is real, so why bother? This inverts the teaching, which uses dream analogy to show appearances are free, spontaneous, ungraspable.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners dismiss everyday life as "just illusion," developing spiritual bypass. Relationships, work, and responsibilities are devalued. "It's all a dream" becomes excuse for inaction.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [NIHILISTIC EXTREME] (denial of reality), [SPIRITUAL BYPASS] (avoiding life), [DISENGAGEMENT] ("nothing matters"), [PASSIVE RESIGNATION] (acceptance through dismissal), and [EMPTINESS MISUNDERSTOOD] (as nothingness).

[249-256] [SUTRA QUOTATION AUTHORITARIANISM] [SCRIPTURAL PROOF-TEXTING]
**Misreading:**
The extended quotation from the Samadhiraja Sutra (*Ting nge 'dzin rgyal po'i mdo*) interpreted as proof-texting—invoking canonical authority to validate claims, treating the sutra as unchallengeable evidence.

**Why it arises:**
"As the Buddha said in the X Sutra" is standard religious citation format. In literalist traditions, scripture proves doctrine. The elaborate quotation with exact line references resembles biblical citation.

**Primary consequence:**
The sutra quotation becomes evidence for a proposition about cosmology. Longchenpa's use of citation is misunderstood as scholarly proof rather than resonant echo or pedagogical illustration.

**Secondary consequences:**
Readers seek the Samadhiraja Sutra as authoritative source to verify claims. The quotation is extracted and analyzed independently. Textual authority is located in the cited source's antiquity.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [CANONICAL FUNDAMENTALISM] (sutras as proof-texts), [SOURCE ANXIETY] (needing to verify quotations), [SCRIPTURAL HIERARCHY] (some texts more authoritative), [FRAGMENTATION ERROR] (separating citation from context), and [SCHOLASTIC AUTHORITARIANISM] (authority through scripture).

[257-264] [PERCEPTUAL LEVEL CONFUSION] [REALM SUBJECTIVISM]
**Misreading:**
The different realms (hell, heaven, Buddha-fields) interpreted as different subjective perceptions of the same objective reality—like different people seeing the same cloud as different shapes.

**Why it arises:**
The text describes how pure and impure perception see differently (*las dag pa'i snang ba* vs. *ma dag pa*). Buddhist teachings often emphasize perception-dependence. This invites subjective idealist interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen is reduced to subjective idealism—reality is mind-dependent projection. The objective pole is lost; everything dissolves into personal perception.

**Secondary consequences:**
If realms are "just perception," then changing perception changes reality. This supports magical thinking—"if I think positively, hell becomes heaven." The actual meaning—perception and perceived are non-dual—is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SUBJECTIVE IDEALISM] (mind-only philosophy), [MAGICAL THINKING] (thinking changes reality), [SOLIPSISM RISK] (only my perception exists), [PERCEPTUAL RELATIVISM] (all views equally valid), and [YOGACARA REDUCTION] (reducing Dzogchen to mind-only).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 5 continues from Page 4's cosmological exposition, now focusing on the immeasurability of fields and the dream analogy. The Samadhiraja Sutra quotation (lines 125-161) is extensive and continues the cosmological description.

Line 162 begins a new section: "Thus, in the world-continent of a single atom..." which continues onto Page 6 with further elaboration of the interpenetration of realms.

ERROR RISK: The dream quotation (lines 155-161) might be read as the final word on cosmology, when actually it's preparing the ground for the more profound pointing in Pages 6-7 about how samsara and nirvana are not different locations but modes of recognition.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands the dream analogy not as dismissal of appearance but as showing its ungraspable, luminous nature. Page 6 will develop this further.

[265-273] [PERCEPTUAL HIERARCHY ELITISM] [CAPACITY SUPERIORITY]
**Misreading:**
The graduated scale of perception (gods < sages < shravakas < bodhisattvas < Buddhas) interpreted as a spiritual hierarchy where higher beings are "better" and lower beings are defective or inferior.

**Why it arises:**
The text explicitly compares capacities using "more than" (ches mang) and "than" (bas ni). The structure resembles developmental psychology, evolutionary advancement, or spiritual elitism. "Buddha sees most" sounds like "Buddha is superior."

**Primary consequence:**
Perceptual capacity is moralized into spiritual superiority. Practitioners develop arrogance about their Dzogchen view or shame about their limited perception.

**Secondary consequences:**
The hierarchy is read as ladder to climb. Teachers are ranked by "level of perception." Students feel inadequate for not seeing infinitely. Dzogchen becomes competition of perceptual powers.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SPIRITUAL ELITISM] (hierarchy of beings), [CAPACITY SHAME] (feeling inadequate), [COMPETITIVE PERCEPTION] (trying to see more), [TEACHER RANKING] (better/worse teachers), and [DEVELOPMENTAL FIXATION] (climbing perceptual ladder).

[274-283] [OMNISCIENCE PROJECTION ERROR] [BUDDHA AS ALL-SEER]
**Misreading:**
"Buddha's eye sees infinitely more" interpreted as describing omniscience in the sense of knowing all facts, possessing complete information about everything.

**Why it arises:**
"Buddha eye" (*sangs rgyas kyi spyan*) and "seeing" (*gzigs pa*) suggest perceptual capacity. Western conceptions of God include omniscience as total knowledge. The comparative "more than" suggests quantitative difference.

**Primary consequence:**
Buddhahood is understood as epistemic achievement—knowing everything that can be known. This turns enlightenment into information accumulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners try to expand their "perception" through psychic development. Meditation becomes attempt to see more, know more, perceive subtle realms. The simplicity of direct recognition is buried under paranormal pursuit.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [OMNISCIENCE FIXATION] (wanting to know all), [PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT] (siddhi chasing), [INFORMATION ACCUMULATION] (knowledge as awakening), [EPISTEMIC MATERIALISM] (facts as treasure), and [PARANORMAL OBSESSION] (special powers).

[284-293] [SUTRA QUOTATION HIERARCHY] [SCRIPTURAL COMPETITION]
**Misreading:**
The multiple sutra quotations (Samadhiraja Sutra, Magical Display Vajra/Guhyagarbha) understood as competing authorities—using one sutra to refute another, establishing which text is "right."

**Why it arises:**
Line 182-189 explicitly refutes one view using another text. This resembles theological debate where scripture is used to prove/disprove positions. Academic Buddhist studies analyze "sutra vs. sutra" conflicts.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes scriptural debate—accumulating quotations to win arguments. Practitioners quote texts at each other to establish authority.

**Secondary consequences:**
The actual meaning—different teachings for different capacities—is lost. Sutras become evidence in scholastic disputes. Longchenpa's integration is read as partisan defense of Nyingma against Sarma.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SCHOLASTIC DEBATE] (arguing with quotations), [SCRIPTURAL PARTISANSHIP] (my text vs. yours), [AUTHORITY COMPETITION] (which sutra wins), [NIHILISM/ETERNALISM DEBATE] (proving positions), and [DOXOGRAPHICAL WARFARE] (school vs. school).

[294-303] [LINEAGE ORIGIN MYTH ERROR] [SAMANTABHADRA AS FIRST]
**Misreading:**
"Samantabhadra as the first, from whom all Buddhas arose" interpreted literally as historical claim about lineage origins—all teachers descend from Samantabhadra in temporal succession.

**Why it arises:**
Line 175 says Buddhas "arose from" (*byung ba*) Samantabhadra having shown the path. This sounds like genealogical origin. "First" (*dang po*) suggests temporal priority.

**Primary consequence:**
Samantabhadra is historicized as primordial teacher who taught the first generation of students. Lineage becomes traced back to this original event.

**Secondary consequences:**
The "first Buddha" concept emerges—who was first, how did lineage begin? Questions about origin plague the tradition. Practitioners seek "original" teachings closer to the source.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [GENEALOGICAL HISTORICIZATION] (lineage as family tree), [ORIGIN OBSESSION] (what happened first), [TEMPORAL PRIORITY] (earlier is better), [PRIMORDIAL TEACHER CULT] (worshipping first Buddha), and [LINEAGE ANXIETY] (authenticity through descent).

[304-313] [REFUTATION AGGRESSION ERROR] [POLEMICAL READING]
**Misreading:**
Longchenpa's refutation of other views (lines 182-189: "this is incorrect... contradicts the Magical Display Vajra") interpreted as aggressive polemic—attacking opponents, defending territory, winning debate.

**Why it arises:**
The language is confrontational: "not correct" (*mi rigs*), "contradicts" (*'gal ba*). Academic Buddhist studies categorize Tibetan literature by polemical debates. Readers import competitive frameworks.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen study becomes identification of who is "right" (Longchenpa) and who is "wrong" (others). The text is read as refutation of opponents rather than clarification for practitioners.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners develop sectarian attitudes—"we Nyingma are right, they are wrong." The actual pedagogical purpose (showing different views for different needs) is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SECTARIANISM] (us vs. them), [POLEMICAL POSTURE] (debate mentality), [REFUTATION OBSESSION] (finding errors in others), [DEFENSIVE IDENTITY] (protecting Dzogchen), and [AGGRESSIVE CORRECTNESS] (being right as goal).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 6 continues from Page 5's cosmological exposition, now focusing on perceptual capacity and sutra quotations. Line 190 introduces how Samantabhadra's emanations benefit beings, which continues the theme.

Line 191 begins: "Such a manner is also renowned in common sutras..." indicating that Page 7 will show how Dzogchen cosmology is not unique but shared with sutra teachings.

ERROR RISK: Readers may treat the refutation section (lines 177-190) as the main point, missing that it's a digression to clarify a specific doctrinal point before returning to the main exposition in Page 7.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands that Longchenpa's refutations are pedagogical clarifications, not sectarian polemics. Page 7 will return to the cosmological framework.

[314-328] [EMANATION NARRATIVE HISTORICIZATION] [HAGIOGRAPHIC LITERALISM]
**Misreading:**
The narrative of Samantabhadra's emanations and the "meeting of father and son" interpreted as describing actual historical events—literal lineages and incarnations occurring in time.

**Why it arises:**
The text uses narrative conventions ("then," "thereupon," "became"). Hagiographic literature describes events. The "Father and Son Meeting Sutra" (*Yab sras mjal ba*) is a narrative text. Historical consciousness assumes events happened.

**Primary consequence:**
Emanation is temporalized into historical succession. Samantabhadra "becoming" various teachers is understood as literal biography. The atemporal nature of emanation is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners trace lineage as historical genealogy. Debates arise about which emanation happened when. The "first" Samantabhadra is historicized as original teacher.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [LINEAGE HISTORICIZATION] (genealogy as history), [EMANATION TEMPORALIZATION] (time-bound emanations), [HAGIOGRAPHIC LITERALISM] (believing saint stories), [ORIGIN QUESTIONS] (who came first), and [BIOGRAPHICAL PROJECTION] (Buddhas as historical persons).

[329-343] [SUTRA QUOTATION DOGMATISM] [SCRIPTURAL PROOF-ARMOR]
**Misreading:**
The extensive quotations from Flower Ornament Sutra (*Phal po che*) and Meeting of Father and Son Sutra treated as authoritative proof-texts—invoking scripture as unchallengeable evidence.

**Why it arises:**
"As it is said in the X Sutra" is standard religious citation. Lines 192-206 quote extensively with line references. Academic Buddhist studies analyze sutra authority. Scripture functions as evidence in theological debates.

**Primary consequence:**
Longchenpa's point—that emanation is spontaneous display, not historical event—is obscured by the apparatus of quotation. Readers focus on verifying sources rather than understanding meaning.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek the "original" sutras to verify claims. The cited passages are extracted and debated. Textual authority trumps direct recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [CANONICAL FUNDAMENTALISM] (sutras as proof-texts), [SOURCE VERIFICATION OBSESSION] (checking citations), [FRAGMENTATION ERROR] (citations out of context), [SCHOLASTIC DEBATE] (arguing quotations), and [AUTHORITY EXTERNALIZATION] (truth in texts).

[344-358] [BODHICITTA EMERGENCE TEMPORALIZATION] [AWAKENING MOMENT]
**Misreading:**
"First aroused bodhicitta" (thugs dang po byang chub tu sems bskyed) interpreted as describing the historical moment when Samantabhadra first generated enlightenment-mind, like a conversion experience.

**Why it arises:**
"First" (*dang po*) and "aroused" (*bskyed*) suggest temporal origin. Buddhist narratives describe bodhicitta generation as significant event. Conversion narratives describe "when I first decided."

**Primary consequence:**
Bodhicitta is temporalized into something that happens at a specific time. The timeless nature of compassionate intent is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek their own "first bodhicitta" moment. Lineage stories focus on "when Buddha first vowed." The continuous, unoriginated nature of compassion is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [CONVERSION NARRATIVE] (awakening as event), [TEMPORAL ORIGIN] (when it started), [BODHICITTA AS ACHIEVEMENT] (generating compassion), [MOMENT HUNTING] (seeking first experience), and [DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRESS] (maturing bodhicitta).

[359-373] [KALPA CALCULATION ERROR] [COSMOLOGICAL TIME LITERALISM]
**Misreading:**
References to "Good Kalpa" (*bskal pa bzang po*), "countless kalpas ago" interpreted as actual temporal measurements—calculable ages, historical periods.

**Why it arises:**
The text uses specific kalpa names and says "countless kalpas before." Buddhist cosmology includes kalpa calculations (20 small kalpas = 1 medium, etc.). Sounds like historical dating.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmological time is literalized into calculable duration. Questions arise about how long ago events occurred. The atemporal nature of ground is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners try to calculate "when" Samantabhadra emanated. Buddhist cosmology becomes literal history. The metaphorical function of "countless" is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [CHRONOLOGICAL OBSESSION] (when did it happen), [COSMOLOGICAL CALCULATION] (measuring kalpas), [TIME LITERALISM] (kalpas as years), [ORIGIN DATING] (how long ago), and [TEMPORAL FOUNDATIONALISM] (ground in time).

[374-389] [OFFERING SUBSTANTIALISM] [GIFT EXCHANGE MODEL]
**Misreading:**
"Offered a golden vajra" (*gser gyi rdo rje cig phul*) understood as describing actual material exchange—giving physical object as offering.

**Why it arises:**
"Offered" (*phul*) and "golden vajra" (*gser gyi rdo rje*) suggest ritual offering. Religious traditions involve material offerings. Line 210 describes specific offering.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-dual gesture of offering/receiving is materialized into transaction. The symbolic meaning—recognition of nature—is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners focus on material offerings to teachers. Elaborate rituals of offering develop. The simplicity of recognition is buried under ritual exchange.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [MATERIAL OFFERING OBSESSION] (giving things), [RITUAL TRANSACTION] (exchange model), [SUBSTANTIALIST GIFT] (objects carry power), [ECONOMIC PROJECTION] (spiritual capitalism), and [EXTERNAL RITUALISM] (forms over recognition).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 7 continues from Page 6's discussion of Samantabhadra's emanations, now providing specific sutra quotations and narratives. Line 210-211 describes the first bodhicitta generation and continues into birth narratives on Page 8.

The page shifts from general cosmological principles to specific hagiographic narratives, which might lead readers to treat these as "the details" of what was previously described in general terms.

ERROR RISK: The narrative details (golden vajra offering, specific birth stories) might be read as "the real story" while the cosmological descriptions on previous pages are dismissed as "just theory."

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands that all levels—cosmological, narrative, and descriptive—are equally conventional designations pointing to the same non-dual recognition.

[390-400] [MANDALA ENUMERATION OVERWHELM] [QUANTITY FETISHISM]
**Misreading:**
The innumerable Buddhas, countless mandalas, immeasurable retinues interpreted as quantitative claims about cosmic population density—like astronomical statistics about stars.

**Why it arises:**
The text uses extreme quantifiers (*dpag tu med*, *grangs med*, *brjod kyis mi lang*). Numbers impress. Buddhist cosmology describes "trichiliocosm." Readers want to grasp the scale.

**Primary consequence:**
The boundless nature of awareness is reduced to "very big numbers." The actual meaning—that enumeration itself is transcended—is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners try to visualize "immeasurable" quantities. Meditation becomes attempt to expand to cosmic scale. The ordinary nature of awareness is overlooked.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [NUMERICAL OBSESSION] (counting the uncountable), [SCALE INFLATION] (bigger is better), [QUANTIFICATION OF INFINITE] (measuring boundless), [COSMIC GRANDIOSITY] (vastness fixation), and [ORDINARY DIMISSAL] (missing simplicity).

[401-411] [LIGHT RAY PROJECTION ERROR] [PHYSICAL OPTICS MAPPING]
**Misreading:**
"Light rays emanating from tongues" (*ljags kyi dbang po las 'od zer dpag tu med pa 'phros pa*) interpreted as describing physical light emission—photons, radiation, luminescence.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" (*'od*) and "rays" (*zer*) suggest optical phenomena. The description resembles physical processes. Modern physics discusses light emission. Tantric iconography shows figures with light rays.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical function of light as wisdom-display is literalized into physics. The actual meaning—compassionate activity manifesting as awareness—is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners try to "see" light rays during meditation. Visualizations focus on optical effects. The cognitive-emotional dimension of compassion is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [OPTICAL LITERALISM] (light as photons), [VISUALIZATION MATERIALISM] (seeing lights), [PHYSICS PROJECTION] (quantum optics), [SPECTRAL OBSESSION] (colors and rays), and [SENSORY REDUCTION] (wisdom as visual).

[412-422] [SAMANTABHADRA ENJOYMENT POSSESSION] [CONSUMPTION METAPHOR]
**Misreading:**
"Gathered as Samantabhadra's enjoyment" (*kun tu bzang po'i longs spyod du 'dus pa*) interpreted as describing ownership or consumption—Samantabhadra possessing or experiencing mandalas as possessions.

**Why it arises:**
"Enjoyment" (*longs spyod*) suggests pleasure, consumption, possession. "Gathered" (*'dus pa*) suggests collection. Western economics frames enjoyment as consumption.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-dual display of awareness is commodified into possession. Samantabhadra becomes owner of mandalas rather than their nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek "enjoyment" as spiritual wealth. Mandalas become objects of aesthetic appreciation. Recognition is replaced by accumulation.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [POSSESSIVE ENJOYMENT] (having experiences), [CONSUMPTION MODEL] (spiritual materialism), [AESTHETIC APPRECIATION] (beauty over recognition), [WEALTH ACCUMULATION] (spiritual richness), and [EXPERIENTIAL OWNERSHIP] (my realization).

[423-433] [NON-ACTION PARADOX CONFUSION] [NEGATIVE THEOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The "four non-" qualities (not moving, not arising, not abiding, not ceasing) interpreted as apophatic negation—describing what Dharmakaya is NOT, leaving positive content empty.

**Why it arises:**
The pattern "not X" (*mi...*) resembles negative theology (apophatic discourse). Christian mysticism describes God by negation. Madhyamika uses negation extensively.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharmakaya is understood as voidness defined by privation—an emptiness lacking positive qualities. The positive, luminous nature is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners cultivate "non-action" as dissociation. Meditation becomes blankness. The dynamic, compassionate display is suppressed.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [NIHILISTIC EXTREME] (denial of all qualities), [DISSOCIATIVE PRACTICE] (not-doing as goal), [APOPHATIC OBSESSION] (negation only), [POSITIVE REPRESSION] (suppressing experience), and [EMPTINESS MISUNDERSTOOD] (as void).

[434-444] [SPONTANEOUS SELF-ARISEN LITERALISM] [AUTO-GENERATION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
"Self-arisen" (*rang byung*), "spontaneously arisen" (*lhun gyis grub pa*) interpreted as meaning "happens automatically" like self-running software or automated processes.

**Why it arises:**
"Self-" (*rang*) suggests auto-. "Arisen" (*byung*) suggests generation. Modern technology includes self-running systems. Spontaneous means automatic.

**Primary consequence:**
The uncaused nature of awareness is mechanized into automatic process. The ontological category of "uncaused" is reduced to "without effort."

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners wait for "spontaneous" experiences. Non-action becomes passivity. Recognition is replaced by hoping something will happen.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [AUTOMATION PROJECTION] (self-running mind), [PASSIVE WAITING] (doing nothing), [EXPERIENCE EXPECTATION] (waiting for spontaneous events), [MECHANISTIC VIEW] (automatic processes), and [CAUSAL CONFUSION] (uncaused vs. automatic).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 8 continues the mandala descriptions from Page 7, focusing on the sixty perfections and specific mandala details. The page transitions from general emanation narrative to detailed mandala enumeration.

Line 238 continues onto Page 9 with description of retinues and activities.

ERROR RISK: The detailed mandala descriptions (lotus stems, stacked worlds, colors) might be read as "the actual cosmology" while the previous page's narrative is dismissed as "mythological framing."

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands that all descriptions—narrative, enumerative, and apophatic—are equally conventional, pointing to the same non-dual ground.

[445-454] [THIRTY-SIX ACTIVITIES CATALOG ERROR] [BUDDHA AS PROJECT MANAGER]
**Misreading:**
The thirty-six activities (*mdzad pa sum cu rtsa drug*) interpreted as a catalog of things a Buddha does—a checklist of powers, accomplishments, or ongoing projects.

**Why it arises:**
The enumeration (*sku'i phyir mdzad pa bzhi*, *nang gi bzhi*, *gsang ba'i bzhi*) suggests categories. "Activities" (*mdzad pa*) implies action. The list resembles resume or project portfolio.

**Primary consequence:**
Buddhahood is reduced to achievement of specific functions. The thirty-six become siddhis to acquire. Recognition is replaced by capability accumulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners count their own "activities" as progress markers. Meditation aims to develop powers. The uncompounded nature is forgotten.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [ACTIVITY ACCUMULATION] (doing things), [CAPABILITY CHECKLIST] (power inventory), [PROJECT MANAGEMENT] (Buddha as executive), [SIDDHI CHASING] (seeking powers), and [ACHIEVEMENT ORIENTATION] (accomplishments as goal).

[455-464] [INNER/OUTER/SECRET SPATIALIZATION] [TRIPARTITE ARCHITECTURE]
**Misreading:**
The division into outer four, inner four, secret four, and so on interpreted as spatial or hierarchical architecture—levels of secrecy like classified information or layers of a building.

**Why it arises:**
"Outer" (*phyir*), "inner" (*nang*), "secret" (*gsang*) suggest spatial/temporal layering. The text lists them sequentially. Esoteric traditions use secrecy hierarchies.

**Primary consequence:**
The activities are spatialized into compartments. "Secret" becomes "advanced" or "restricted." The non-dual nature is fragmented.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek "secret" teachings as higher. Outer practices are dismissed as beginner-level. The unity of all activities is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [SECRECY HIERARCHY] (levels of initiation), [SPATIAL COMPARTMENTALIZATION] (inner vs. outer), [ELITIST EXCLUSION] (secret = better), [ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTION] (building layers), and [FRAGMENTED VIEW] (dividing what is whole).

[465-475] [UNCOMPOUNDED SUBSTANTIALISM] [THING-THAT-IS-UNCAUSED]
**Misreading:**
"Uncompounded" (*'dus ma byas*) interpreted as describing a special kind of thing—an entity that lacks parts or causes, but still exists as something.

**Why it arises:**
"Uncompounded" negates compounding but affirms existence. Buddhist philosophy debates compounded vs. uncompounded dharmas. Sounds like ontological category.

**Primary consequence:**
The Dharmakaya is reified as "uncaused thing." The negation of causality is treated as positive attribute of a metaphysical entity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek "uncompounded" experience. Analysis focuses on what lacks parts. The emptiness of all categories is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [SUBSTANTIALIST EMPTINESS] (thing called empty), [ONTOLOGICAL FIXATION] (uncaused existence), [NEGATION REIFICATION] (not-X as something), [CATEGORY RETENTION] (keeping Buddhist categories), and [METAPHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION] (building systems).

[476-485] [PERFECTION FIVE ENUMERATION] [CHECKLIST SPIRITUALITY]
**Misreading:**
The five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*) interpreted as five things to achieve or acquire—five qualities that must be present for enlightenment.

**Why it arises:**
"Five" suggests list. "Perfections" (*phun sum tshogs*) suggests completeness. The text lists them (teacher, place, retinue, teaching, time). Achievement frameworks use checklists.

**Primary consequence:**
The five perfections become acquisition targets. Practitioners try to "get" perfect teacher, perfect place, etc. The already-perfect nature is forgotten.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual shopping for perfect conditions. Waiting for perfect teacher before practice. Dismissing current circumstances as imperfect.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [CONDITION SHOPPING] (seeking perfect circumstances), [ENUMERATION OBSESSION] (checking off lists), [ACHIEVEMENT CHECKLIST] (five items to get), [PERFECTIONISM] (nothing is good enough), and [DELAY TACTICS] (waiting for conditions).

[486-496] [SIX SYLLABLE AUTO-GENERATION ERROR] [MANTRA MECHANISM]
**Misreading:**
"Self-arisen six syllables" (*rang byung gi yi ge drug*) interpreted as describing automatic mantra generation—a mechanical process where wisdom spontaneously produces sound.

**Why it arises:**
"Six syllables" (*yi ge drug*) suggests mantra (Om Mani Padme Hum = six). "Self-arisen" (*rang byung*) suggests automatic. Mantras are associated with power.

**Primary consequence:**
The natural resonance of awareness is mechanized into mantra-production. The ontological claim becomes technological claim.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek "self-arisen" mantras. Chanting becomes attempt to trigger automatic process. Recognition is replaced by mantra mechanics.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [MANTRA MECHANISM] (automatic sound), [TECHNOLOGICAL PROJECTION] (self-running systems), [SYLLABLE OBSESSION] (counting sounds), [AUTO-CHANTING] (mechanical recitation), and [ACOUSTIC MATERIALISM] (sound as power).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 9 continues from Page 8's mandala descriptions, now focusing on the thirty-six activities of Dharmakaya. The page enumerates specific activities (not moving, not arising, not abiding, not taking, etc.).

Line 268 ends mid-list: "Secret four are..." which continues onto Page 10 with the remaining activities.

ERROR RISK: The detailed enumeration of activities might lead readers to memorize the list as "what Dharmakaya does" rather than understanding that these are negations of conventional action, not positive functions.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands the thirty-six activities as descriptions of uncompounded nature through negation, not as a Buddha's project list.

[497-507] [SAMADHI MEDITATION OBJECTIFICATION] [TECHNIQUE FETISHISM]
**Misreading:**
The samadhis (*ting nge 'dzin*)—Overpowering Mudra, Great Blaze Equality, Dharmata Variegated, etc.—interpreted as meditation techniques to practice, states to achieve, or mental exercises to perform.

**Why it arises:**
"Samadhi" is commonly translated as "meditation" or "concentration." The names sound like technique titles. Buddhist practice includes many samadhi cultivation methods.

**Primary consequence:**
The natural stability of awareness is turned into technique repertoire. Practitioners try to "do" these samadhis through effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation becomes samadhi shopping—trying different techniques. Teachers sell "advanced samadhis." The simplicity of recognition is buried under method proliferation.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [TECHNIQUE ACCUMULATION] (collecting methods), [SAMADHI CHASING] (seeking states), [MEDITATION INDUSTRY] (selling techniques), [EFFORTFUL STABILITY] (trying to concentrate), and [STATE SEEKING] (wanting special experiences).

[508-518] [MUDRA GESTURE MATERIALISM] [RITUAL MOVEMENT OBSESSION]
**Misreading:**
"Mudra" (*phyag rgya*) interpreted as referring to hand gestures, ritual movements, or symbolic positions—physical techniques to perform.

**Why it arises:**
In common Buddhist parlance, "mudra" means hand gesture. Tantric practice includes extensive mudra systems. The text mentions "overpowering mudra" (*phyag rgya zil gyis gnon pa*).

**Primary consequence:**
The symbolic-semiotic dimension of mudra (as seal, mark, gesture) is reduced to physical movement. The ontological meaning—awareness as seal of reality—is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners learn complex hand positions. Mudra performance becomes ritual requirement. Recognition is replaced by choreography.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [GESTURE OBSESSION] (hand positions), [RITUAL CHOREOGRAPHY] (physical performance), [MUDRA MATERIALISM] (form over meaning), [SOMATIC REDUCTION] (body movements), and [TECHNIQUE EXPERTISE] (mastering forms).

[519-529] [LOTUS STEM ARCHITECTURE ERROR] [BOTANICAL LITERALISM]
**Misreading:**
The description of lotus stems (*pad ma'i sdong po*), petals (*'dab ma*), and stacked worlds (*brtshegs ma*) interpreted as botanical description or architectural blueprint—actual physical structure.

**Why it arises:**
Detailed spatial description invites literalization. "Stem," "petal," "stacked" suggest physical structure. Buddhist art depicts such mandalas literally.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical architecture is literalized into cosmic engineering. The actual meaning—interdependent arising as lotus-mandala—is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners visualize physical lotus structures. Art becomes blueprint. The empty, luminous nature is obscured by form.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINT] (literal structures), [BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION] (plant anatomy), [VISUALIZATION MATERIALISM] (seeing forms), [COSMIC ENGINEERING] (building mandalas), and [FORM OBSESSION] (structure over emptiness).

[530-540] [FRAGRANT WATER STREAM SUBSTANTIALISM] [OLFACTORY MATERIALISM]
**Misreading:**
"Stream of fragrant water" (*spos chu'i rgyun*) interpreted as describing actual scented liquid flowing—physical perfume, sensory pleasure.

**Why it arises:**
"Fragrant water" (*spos chu*) suggests perfumed liquid. "Stream" (*rgyun*) suggests flow. Sensory language invites sensual literalization.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphor of blessing-flow is substantialized into olfactory experience. The actual meaning—continuous blessing as naturally perfumed—is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek fragrant experiences. Rituals use actual perfume. Recognition is replaced by sensory stimulation.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [OLFACTORY OBSESSION] (smells and scents), [SENSORY MATERIALISM] (physical pleasures), [PERFUME RITUALISM] (using fragrances), [BLESSING SUBSTANTIALISM] (liquid grace), and [SENSUAL PROJECTION] (pleasure seeking).

[541-551] [STACKED WORLD DISCRETE ENTITIES] [MANDALA ATOMISM]
**Misreading:**
The twenty-five stacked fields (*zhing khams nyi shu rtsa lnga re brtshegs mar*) interpreted as distinct, separate worlds—discrete entities piled like pancakes or stacked plates.

**Why it arises:**
"Stacked" (*brtshegs ma*) suggests piling. "Twenty-five" suggests countable units. "Fields" (*zhing khams*) suggest locations. Discrete entities are easier to conceptualize.

**Primary consequence:**
The interpenetrating nature of fields is fragmented into separable units. The non-dual display is atomized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners visualize separate worlds. Counting replaces recognizing. The seamless nature of appearance is divided.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [DISCRETE ENTITIES] (separate things), [MANDALA ATOMISM] (dividing whole), [COUNTING OBSESSION] (enumerating worlds), [STACKING METAPHOR] (literal piling), and [FRAGMENTATION ERROR] (breaking unity).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 10 continues from Page 9's enumeration of activities, now shifting to Sambhogakaya emanations and detailed mandala architecture. The page describes specific samadhis and mandala structures.

Line 318 continues onto Page 11 with further mandala elaboration.

ERROR RISK: The architectural details (lotus stems, petal arrangements, stacked configurations) might be read as "the actual structure of the pure land" rather than metaphorical descriptions of awareness-display.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands all these descriptions—activities, samadhis, and architectures—as conventional designations (*tha snyad*) for what transcends description.

[552-557] [THIRTY-TWO MARKS ANATOMICAL LITERALISM] [PHYSIOLOGICAL PERFECTIONISM]
**Misreading:**
The thirty-two major marks (*mtshan sum cu rtsa gnyis*) and eighty minor signs (*dpe byad brgyad cu*) interpreted as literal anatomical features—physical characteristics of an ideal body.

**Why it arises:**
The text lists specific marks (wheel-feet, long tongue, etc.) and signs. Iconographic conventions depict these literally. Hindu/Buddhist traditions describe divine physiques.

**Primary consequence:**
Buddhahood is reduced to physical perfection. Practitioners seek bodily transformation. Statues are worshipped as anatomical ideals.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation focuses on visualizing perfect bodies. Self-image issues arise from comparison. The formless nature is forgotten.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [BODY PERFECTIONISM] (ideal physique), [ANATOMICAL LITERALISM] (physical marks), [ICON WORSHIP] (statue veneration), [PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION] (changing body), and [FORM OBSESSION] (appearance over essence).

[558-563] [FACE-HAND ACTIVITIES SPATIALIZATION] [FACIAL CHOREOGRAPHY]
**Misreading:**
"Wisdom face-hand complete" (*ye shes kyi zhal phyag rdzogs pa*) interpreted as describing actual facial expressions and hand gestures—physical performance.

**Why it arises:**
"Face" (*zhal*) and "hand" (*phyag*) suggest body parts. "Complete" (*rdzogs pa*) suggests perfect form. Performance traditions use facial/hand expression.

**Primary consequence:**
The symbolic meaning is reduced to physical theater. Practitioners practice facial expressions. Recognition is replaced by acting.

**Secondary consequences:**
Mudra and expression become ends in themselves. Ritual performance prioritizes form. The natural display is choreographed.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [CHOREOGRAPHED EXPRESSION] (practiced faces), [PHYSICAL THEATER] (performance), [GESTURE OBSESSION] (hand positions), [FORMALISM] (correct expression), and [ARTIFICIALITY] (posed vs. natural).

[564-570] [LIGHT RAY BUNDLE MATERIALISM] [PHOTON ACCUMULATION]
**Misreading:**
"Host of light rays emanating" (*'od zer gyi tshogs 'phro ba*) interpreted as describing physical light emission—radiation, photons, luminescence.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" (*'od*) and "rays" (*zer*) suggest optics. "Emanating" (*'phro*) suggests projection. Modern physics discusses radiation.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphor of wisdom-radiance is literalized into physics. The actual meaning—compassion extending universally—is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek luminous experiences. Meditation aims for light visualization. The cognitive dimension is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [OPTICAL LITERALISM] (light as photons), [LUMINOSITY CHASING] (seeking light), [RADIATION PROJECTION] (physical energy), [SPECTRAL OBSESSION] (colors), and [VISUAL REDUCTION] (seeing vs. knowing).

[571-576] [FRONT-BACK DIRECTIONAL LITERALISM] [SPATIAL ORIENTATION]
**Misreading:**
"Abiding without front or back" (*mdun dang rgyab med par bzhugs pa*) interpreted as describing physical orientation—having no front or back side.

**Why it arises:**
"Front" (*mdun*) and "back" (*rgyab*) are spatial terms. "Without" (*med*) negates directionality. Sounds like physical description.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphor of omnidirectional awareness is spatialized into anatomy. The actual meaning—non-partiality—is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners visualize beings without fronts. Spatial paradoxes become focus. The non-dual nature is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates [SPATIAL PARADOX] (directionless form), [ANATOMICAL ODDITY] (no front/back), [ORIENTATION OBSESSION] (facing all directions), [PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY] (impossible body), and [GEOMETRIC CONFUSION] (spatial paradox).

[577-577] [INSIDE-OUTSIDE VIEWING DUALISM] [PERSPECTIVAL PARADOX]
**Misreading:**
"Looking from inside, outside clear; looking from outside, inside clear" interpreted as describing actual visual capacity—seeing through things, X-ray vision.

**Why it arises:**
"Inside" (*nang*), "outside" (*phyi*), "looking" (*bltas*), "clear" (*gsal*) suggest vision. The phrases describe unusual seeing. Paranormal abilities fascinate.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-duality of appearance-emptiness is reduced to supernatural sight. The actual meaning—non-obstruction of awareness—is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek clairvoyance. Meditation aims for penetrating vision. The natural clarity is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [CLAIRVOYANCE SEEKING] (X-ray vision), [PERSPECTIVAL PROJECTION] (inside/outside), [VISUAL PARANORMAL] (supernatural sight), [SEEING OBSESSION] (wanting to see), and [DUALISTIC VISION] (inner/outer duality).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 11 continues the thirty-six activities enumeration from Page 10, completing the "secret four" and beginning body/speech/mind activities. Lines 326-335 complete the body activities.

Line 336 begins speech activities which continue onto Page 12.

ERROR RISK: The detailed enumeration of marks and activities might be read as "what a Buddha has" rather than "ways to recognize uncompounded nature."

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands these enumerations as descriptive categories pointing to nature, not as checklist of accomplishments.
