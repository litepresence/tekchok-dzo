[001-056] <ontological-error> [ELEMENT REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space) are actual physical substances or building blocks of matter.

**Why it arises:**
Element terminology suggests chemistry or physics. Materialist worldview.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen physics mistaken for ancient chemistry.

**Secondary consequences:**
Comparing with modern science; trying to "update" the system.

**Cascade effects:**
<scholarly-collapse-error>.

[265-313] <ontological-error> [WIND AS PHYSIOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The five root winds and branch winds are actual physiological processes or breath patterns.

**Why it arises:**
"Wind" (rlung) translated as "air" or "breath" suggests physiology.

**Primary consequence:**
Reduction of subtle body to anatomical respiratory system.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pranayama-style techniques substituted for subtle body practice.

**Cascade effects:**

[390-407] [VIEW ERROR] [AWARENESS AS MIND]
**Misreading:**
The "awareness" (rig pa) discussed here is the ordinary cognitive mind or consciousness.

**Why it arises:**
"Awareness" in English suggests ordinary knowing or perception. "Completeness in awareness" sounds like psychological wholeness.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen's *rig pa* (pristine awareness beyond subject-object) mistaken for *sems* (ordinary dualistic mind).

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation on ordinary mind-state mistaken for recognition of rigpa. Practices of calming and focusing taught instead of direct introduction.

**Cascade effects:**
[408-425] [EMPTINESS ERROR] [MERE IMPUTATION AS NIHILISM]
**Misreading:**
"All dharmas are merely imputed/labelled" means nothing exists at all.

**Why it arises:**
"Merely" (*tsam*) suggests insignificance. "Imputed" (*btags pa*) suggests artificiality. Combined, they sound like "just imaginary."

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen's "primordially spontaneously complete" (*ye nas lhun grub*) interpreted as nothingness, contradicting the text's assertion of completeness.

**Secondary consequences:**
Denial of relative truth while failing to recognize absolute truth. Practitioners become stuck in blank meditation.

**Cascade effects:**
[426-444] [SUBTLE BODY ERROR] [INNER ARISING AS PHYSIOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The "inner arising" five elements are the physical organs and systems (lungs, heart, digestion, etc.).

**Why it arises:**
"Inner" suggests interior of body. "Five elements" mapped to anatomy. "Channels" (*rtsa*) translated as veins/nerves.

**Primary consequence:**
Completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices reduced to physical health exercises or subtle anatomy visualization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Wisdom potential (*ye shes kyi gdangs*) sought through physical manipulation rather than recognition of nature.
