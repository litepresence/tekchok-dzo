[1182-1206] <ontological-error> [BINDU MATERIALISM]
**Misreading:**
Essences (thig le, bindu) are actual physical substances (semen, hormones, etc.).

**Why it arises:**
Sexual imagery interpreted literally. Physicalist reduction.

**Primary consequence:**
Sexual practices literalized or rejected as "primitive."

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing the subtle energetic dimension.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-error>.

[1303-1376] <ontological-error> [LUMINOSITY AS LIGHT]
**Misreading:**
Luminosity ('od gsal, prabhasvara) refers to actual physical light or electromagnetic radiation.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" terminology suggests physics. "Clear light" invites literalization.

**Primary consequence:**
Experiences of light literalized as physical phenomena.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing the metaphorical nature of light imagery.
