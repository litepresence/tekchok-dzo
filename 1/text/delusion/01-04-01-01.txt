[1902-1905] <extreme-views>
**Misreading:**
The "erroneous vehicles" (*log pa'i theg pa*) are interpreted as completely false paths to be rejected, rather than limited but functional approaches that eventually lead to correct understanding.

**Why it arises:**
The term "log pa" (erroneous/wrong) suggests complete falsehood. Buddhist polemics against "non-Buddhist" (*mu stegs*) views can seem to dismiss them entirely rather than acknowledging their partial validity.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners develop an attitude of superiority toward non-Buddhist traditions, missing the pedagogical point that even extreme views serve a purpose in the gradual training of minds.

[1906-1935] <eternalism-misunderstanding>
**Misreading:**
Eternalist views (*rtag par lta ba*) like Sāṃkhya are interpreted as simply wrong about a permanent self, rather than accurately describing a level of experience (subtle mind) but misidentifying it as ultimately real.

**Why it arises:**
The critique of ātman seems to apply to all concepts of permanence. However, the Sāṃkhya "self" (*bdag*) is actually the ālaya-vijñāna or subtle mind—not a soul in the Western sense.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners fail to recognize that Sāṃkhya describes genuine meditative experience (accessing the storehouse consciousness) but reifies it. This leads to either dismissing valid experience or fearing any experience of continuity.

[1943-1984] <annihilationism-misunderstanding>
**Misreading:**
Annihilationist views (*chad par lta ba*) are interpreted as nihilism—the belief that nothing exists and morality doesn't matter.

**Why it arises:**
The term "chad pa" (cut/break) suggests complete destruction. The Lokāyata view that consciousness ends at death seems to justify hedonism.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners fail to see that annihilationism accurately perceives the impermanence of gross phenomena but misses subtle continuity. This leads to either nihilistic despair or reactive eternalism.

[1985-2032] <causal-annihilationism>
**Misreading:**
The distinction between cause-annihilationists (*rgyu chad par smra ba*) and result-annihilationists ('*bras bu chad par smra ba*) is seen as hair-splitting among nihilists rather than a sophisticated analysis of different levels of subtlety.

**Why it arises:**
Both deny continuity, so they seem the same. The distinction requires understanding subtle body theories and the difference between denying causal continuity versus denying resultant continuity.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners miss the nuance that some "nihilists" actually describe genuine aspects of the subtle body (*srog* system) but fail to recognize mind's nature.

[2033-2376] <sixty-wrong-views>
**Misreading:**
The 360 wrong views are catalogued as a list of errors to memorize and avoid, rather than a map of possible deviations that helps identify one's own subtle fixations.

**Why it arises:**
Doxographic literature appears to be about categorizing "others' mistakes." The purpose—recognizing how one's own view may be limited—is missed.

**Primary consequence:**
Intellectual pride in knowing all the wrong views. Practitioners catalog others' errors while remaining blind to their own subtle materialism, eternalism, or nihilism.
