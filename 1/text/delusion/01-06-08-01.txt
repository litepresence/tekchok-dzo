[8770-8770] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [WISDOM SEQUENCING]
MISREADING:
The wisdom-prajna empowerment (shes rab ye shes dbang) and word empowerment (tshig dbang) are interpreted as advanced stages requiring preparation through previous empowerments, forming a temporal curriculum.

WHY IT ARISES:
Educational progression models impose sequential learning frameworks. The numerical ordering suggests prerequisite structure. Fear of "incomplete foundation" drives deferral.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that all four empowerments are simultaneous aspects of single recognition is entirely lost. The highest empowerment is deferred indefinitely while lower ones are obsessively repeated.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners accumulate empowerments like academic degrees without recognizing their nature. Elitist hierarchies form around empowerment-status. The simplicity of direct introduction is abandoned for complexity.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. Trekcho/thogyal will be approached as advanced curriculum rather than direct recognition.

[8771-8781] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [PURIFICATION METRICS]
MISREADING:
The 64, 128, or 512 bodies/purifications are interpreted as measurable quotas to be completed, like items on a spiritual checklist, with completion guaranteeing attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Quantification provides illusion of progress. The mathematical precision suggests calculable achievement. Anxiety about "enough" practice drives counting-obsession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that these numbers point to recognition, not quantities to accumulate, is entirely lost. Practice becomes spreadsheet management rather than wisdom cultivation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners compete over numbers completed while neglecting quality of recognition. Burnout from obsessive counting leads to abandonment of practice. The symbolic becomes the literal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on signs of warmth will be treated as completion certificates rather than natural expressions of recognition.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains empowerment instructions. Preceding pages established posture and mantra errors that carry forward. Following pages (205+) discuss subtle body bliss practices that will be misunderstood as empowerment-dependent techniques rather than universally available recognition.

[8782-8790] [PRACTICE ERROR] [THIGLE MANIPULATION]
MISREADING:
The bindu/thigle practices are interpreted as physical manipulations of actual substances within the body, like moving fluids or energy through hydraulic mechanics.

WHY IT ARISES:
Physiological reductionism projects onto subtle body. The liquid-like descriptions suggest material substances. Desire for tangible, controllable practice supports hydraulic interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that thigle is the luminous nature of mind, not a substance to move, is entirely lost. Practice becomes body-manipulation rather than recognition-cultivation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners force physical movements seeking "thigle flow," causing injury. The wisdom aspect of bliss is abandoned for sensation-seeking. Technique-accumulation replaces view-grounded practice.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on four joys will be approached as thigle-management techniques.

[8791-8799] [VIEW ERROR] [CHANNEL SUBSTANTIALISM]
MISREADING:
The channels (rtsa) and chakras are treated as anatomical structures with fixed locations, like the cardiovascular system, that can be mapped, manipulated, and developed.

WHY IT ARISES:
Medical anatomy models unconsciously project onto subtle body. The spatial language suggests fixed geography. The desire for objective, scientific certainty supports literalization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that channels are conceptual designations for the movement of awareness, not fixed structures, is entirely obscured. The energetic becomes the physical.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners obsess over precise anatomical locations while neglecting the awareness that moves. Disappointment when "channels" can't be objectively verified leads to skepticism. The symbolic is reduced to the literal.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on channel-opening will be approached as anatomical development.

[8800-8808] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [WIND CONTROL]
MISREADING:
The winds (rlung) are understood as actual energies or forces that can be captured, directed, and controlled through breathing techniques, like capturing and directing a physical current.

WHY IT ARISES:
Physics models of energy projection onto prana. The kinetic language suggests controllable forces. Desire for power-over experience supports control-interpretation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that winds are the movements of mind, not forces to control, is entirely lost. Practice becomes manipulation rather than recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Breathing obsession replaces recognition. Practitioners develop anxiety about "correct" breathing while missing that awareness is never breath-dependent. The natural becomes forced.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PRACTICE ERROR]. Subsequent pages on wind-mind union will be approached as fusion of two substances.

---

[8809-8809] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [BLISS DEVELOPMENT]
MISREADING:
The cultivation of bliss is interpreted as developing an experience over time through repeated practice, like building muscle or acquiring skill, with bliss as conditioned attainment.

WHY IT ARISES:
Conditioning and training frameworks impose development models. The language of "cultivation" suggests temporal growth. Fear that bliss won't happen without effort drives doing-obsession.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that bliss is the natural expression of mind's nature, always present, never developed, is entirely obscured. Seeking replaces finding.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Practitioners chase increasingly intense experiences, becoming bliss-addicted. Disappointment when conditioned experiences fade leads to technique-switching. The unconditioned is abandoned for the conditioned.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Four joys will be misread as temporal progression rather than simultaneous aspects.
