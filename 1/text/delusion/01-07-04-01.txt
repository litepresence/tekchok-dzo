[10086-10106] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [LEVEL COMPARISON]
MISREADING:
Reader understands Ground - essence, nature, capacity as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.

WHY IT ARISES:
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Ground - essence, nature, capacity is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.

[10107-10131] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [PRESENT NEGLECT]
MISREADING:
Reader interprets Ground - essence, nature, capacity through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

WHY IT ARISES:
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Ground - essence, nature, capacity is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.

MISREADING:
Reader adopts Ground - empty essence, clear nature, pervasive compassion as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Ground - empty essence, clear nature, pervasive compassion is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The teaching that Ground - empty essence, clear nature, pervasive compassion is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.
